So he does what he knows Cas can't stand--he braces against his bonds, looks at him through lowered eyelashes, and lets a note of pleading creep into his voice. "Cas,
"...I understand. I'll go warm the water for you."
"I love you, Dean."
, then moving, down, down; he's dropping his head and flattening his tongue and drawing me in--
the thought. He'd never have picked himself as the jealous type, but he doesn't want anyone else to see this side of Castiel. The naked side. The rippling physique, muscles taut and bulging with the strain of holding back the fire and flood of his superhuman lust. The power in him, and the way he controls it. Luckily, by Cas' own admission, Dean is the only one who can satiate him.
As I speak, something changes in his gaze. There is a heat to it that was not there before. Such simple words of affirmation, and yet they transform him.
I lie still for a little while, trying to adjust--to the dark; to the feelings; to the sense of secondary satisfaction I get from his orgasm. A good few minutes go by, and then reclaim my hand again, wiping a little of the stickiness off onto the bedclothes. I wriggle forward so that I can rest my forehead on his cheek; feeling him smile as I do.
In the space of a breath, he changes modes. Suddenly, he's smiling at me in a way that is decidedly not angelic. Sometimes he goes from servant to master so fast I get whiplash.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Cas, that wasn't--that wasn't a
For a little while, he does not meet my eyes.
"Dean, I don't understand."
"Why?"
He is visibly uncertain how to proceed. Taking his clothes off, I suppose, is something he knows how to do. It is his 'comfort zone'. Any further, though, and he is stepping into unfamiliar territory.
made to feel pleasure. It is only because I inhabit a human vessel that such a thing is possible.
him. I want to feel that sensation, the way he wraps tight around my fingers, through my cock. I want him to strain against me like he's doing now, but I want to feel it from the inside. I wait, and once I feel the shuddering begin to abate, I withdraw my fingers.
Dean was nervous, not because he was scared of the haunted house, but this dude was… sort of hot.  Okay, really hot.  Would he be able to keep his eyes off of him long enough to help him out?
“Ready to help out?” Castiel asked, as Dean nodded and followed him up the stairs and to one of the closed doors.  Castiel opened the door and walked inside, and inside said room was a Queen sized bed, with art on the walls, mostly of Vincent Van Gogh.  Dean could admire that.  He liked the starry night painting the most.  He had a walk in closet, a tall white dresser, and a decent sized television hanging on the wall with a table below it with some game systems and a stack of games.  On his bed was a few suitcases full of clothes and other random belongings.
“I like your room so far.” Dean said, as he looked around.  Castiel smiled at that.  He was glad someone could appreciate his interest in art.  “Thank you, Dean.  You really don’t have to help me unpack, instead we could play a game or something?” Castiel suggested as Dean blinked but walked over to a suitcase and sat down on the bed and smirked.  “Nah.  I’m here to help, but we have all night and I see you have Mario Kart and I’m going to kick your ass at it.” He grinned cheekily, as Castiel shook his head.  “No one has beat me yet, Dean.” Castiel smiled at the other guy, who was already grinning at him.  “Keyword being, yet, Cas.” Dean said back, as he got up off the bed and clapped his hands together.  “Okay!  Where to start?” Dean asked, as Castiel smirked further and hummed to himself, as he walked up to the bed and grabbed a few tee shirts from his suitcase and tossed them to Dean.
Sam felt a little guilty for not providing much in the way of entertainment for his brother while he was locked up in his room. Jack seemingly taking his role of ‘Cas’s security guard’ much better than he was, managing to bring him a laptop, some comic books and even a crossword puzzle, which Cas apparently finished in record time. Maybe they had some playing cards or something around here that he could borrow, at least that might keep him amused for 5 minutes. “Yeah, that might be a good idea.”
“Did it just get really cold,” Jack asked, Dean looking up just in time to catch the small puff of air that escaped his mouth as he spoke.
And as proud as he was of the place, Sam couldn’t help but agree with his older brother. They had seen places like this over the years with the halls filled with spectres, apparitions, so of course, it was the first thing he looked into after he was given the ok. But it came as a surprise to find out that no one in their network had ever done a job at this place.
“Out for a walk?” he replied unconvincingly with a small shrug. Sam stood a little taller, arms coming across his chest as he glowered at the kid. “he’s…. he’s with Dean.”
One ring. Two Rings. Three Rings.
“Will you take Dean’s to him?” Eileen asked looking over her shoulder towards Jack and Jody. Any frostiness of her earlier comment seemingly melting away as she offered him a sweet smile. “I’ll go see Cas and take him his.”
Sucking in a breath, Dean drummed his fingers on the wheel. This could be bad,
If Dean was truthful- which he never is- he’d indulge and say he’s cool with everything. But that would reveal too much and Dean needed to keep his head as clear. He could hear Dad in the back of his head, screaming at him to focus on the job. “First of all, we're literally supposed to be husbands. Secondly, I'm only doing the small stuff: handholding, sitting together, pet names, just couple stuff.” He poked Castiel in the stomach, trying to distract from the awkwardness that was creeping into his veins. “Try not to fall in love with me.”
“Die then.”
“You wanna hear another fun fact about this place’s carvings?” Leo continued.
“You keep calling me that. Is it an endearment?”
“Dude, for real?”
“It’s for failing relationships, Cas.” Dean explained, “So… what? Some marriage counselor get tired of playing 'Love Doctor' for people with a fifty percent divorce rate?” Dean huffed, sipping his coffee. The tip of tongue stung, the bitter brew still scalding. Fuck, still too hot.
The pit in his stomach was still there when Dean finally found his little brother. Sam was setting a tray of mac n’ cheese under a heat lamp when he walked into the dining area. The wood theme carried on, floor and ceiling both paneled with oak and the tables made of sturdy pine on all except the side that led to a patio and lake. Dark greens and reds made up the large area rug in the middle of the dining room. About four large birch tables were spaced around the room- each with an ornate wooden carving. One table held an elephant, the other a fox, another had a swan, a bear, and an inhabited table had a cedar wolf as the centerpiece. A small group of six people- probably other patrons- were seated furthest away from the meal counter where Sam was stationed. They were engaged in conversation, completely illuminated by the warm fireplace next to them and the moonlight that streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows that lined the wall.
Castiel had dropped in weeks after revealing to them that he was sent from Heaven as a ‘bodyguard’, said something about helping them with hunts. Something something helping out, protecting the Michael Sword, preventing the apocalypse, blah blah blah. Dean was still processing the whole ‘Angels are real thing’, especially after Sam had just joined him on the road. Castiel was way better than that dickhead angel in the suit. Seemed like Heaven liked Earth enough to beat back doomsday with a broom. Dean didn’t like to think about if they hadn’t liked Earth.
“Mechanic.” He responded curtly- easy and close to the truth. “My old man gave me his garage when he retired.”
Dean had already started to walk away, jaw clenched and rolling his eyes. “I fucking hate you.” Sam just laughed. Man, fuck little siblings. Sam didn’t even truly grasp what the issue was here. He probably thought Dean felt off about pretending to be gay- he never
Ivy giggled at Dean’s blank stare, a light tone that made her seem younger than she was. Pointing at herself, she clarified, “Investment banker.” She pointed to Ximena, who was looking away- almost as if she was embarrassed. “Heart surgeon.”
“Language.”
“It’s probably a hereditary thing or something, but that’s not the one I met. That’s a different one, I promise.”
Andrew nods, “Okay, fair.”
powers. The warding around this place is nuts.” Sam stared, disbelieving. “He got
“Alright, well since Cas chucked the first brick at Stonewall, I’d say he’s fine with it.” Dean cranked the volume up, drowning out Sam’s ensuing laugh and his own swirling thoughts. All he needed to do was act natural, but not too natural so he didn't raise any suspicions. There was no reason for a guy with issues spanning his entire life- a guy destined to be a weapon of destruction- to fall in love with one of the purest beings in the world. A man so determined and
“That’s what you’re focused on? Not the fact that I can see it too?”
Dean gritted his teeth. “Something like that.” Maybe her nosiness could be beneficial. "Hey,” He got the attention of the rest of the table. “Do you guys know what those carved thingies on the service elevators are?"
. They only have one open position for a temp job and you and Castiel share that,” He screwed his face into a poor impression of Castiel’s serious expression, he continued with an overexaggerated gravelly voice, “
“Boys.” Bobby turned to the trio on the couch.
, Leo.” Another man- probably Dean’s height- with jet-black hair and dark aviators pushed into his hair waved, showing off a stunning smile. Leo was
"You don't happen to have pie, do you?" The woman grinned, gesturing for him to follow her over to a glass case.
Front Desk Lady chuckled, “It sure does feel like that sometimes, huh? Well, Mr….” She glanced down at the card, “Beretta, you are in luck because we have a suite open for the weekend. It comes with amenities." The woman sing songed, trying to entice them. Internally, Dean grimaced. A suite? That was way more that they could afford right now. But then again, it wasn’t
“I have enough power to heal minor injuries, but not enough to teleport out if needed. I’ve been somewhat reduced to a human with healing powers.”
“Oh my god.”
"Dean, are you scared of loving Castiel?”
bad. Not because he was repressed or anything- Dean knew he liked dudes, chicks were just safer to hook up with- but because pretending with Cas was way too close to the truth. But people were dying and he needed to keep the job front and center as first priority, personal feelings came second. “What do you think about this Cas?”
“I hold no traditional military rank.”
Nicole clicked her tongue, “That’s what the newspapers said, but I don’t know. They seemed a bit fishy for my tastes.”
"Oh my god, cherry,
“Precisely. Because of this, I’m afraid I’m not at my full power.”
This was straight ass.
Sam nodded, recognition flashing across his face. “Yeah… yeah I noticed them earlier. Every floor has them on every service elevator entrance. Check up on the lo-” And Sam couldn't get anything else before a redhead with a blinding white smile walked up behind him. She was wearing a beige pantsuit and white blouse with a nameplate that read Heather. Her hair was brown- long and braided down her back with a long strand tucked behind her ear.
. Is that a nickname I shouldn’t use?” This chick was weird. And just jumped to the top of his suspect list.
It’s a ball of swirling yellow and red light with feathery wings flared out and black rings surrounding it. There’s one face in the middle of it with an empty smile staring straight forward. It sets their food down and then shifts. Everything peels away and reveals a kid- not that much older than Liv- holding an empty tray. He looks like he just finished laughing at a really good joke and tearily asks if they need anything else. They both shake their head no and the kid leaves. Andrew turns slowly towards his daughter and sees a mirror expression on her face.
The angel starts talking in the croaky, deep voice Liv imitated earlier. “I am an angel of the lord. Angels are cosmic light and wavelengths wrapped into one being, you both have the ability to see angelic true forms- what angels truly look like. Typically, angels are in vessels- humans that donate their bodies to be inhabited.”
we?” The glass case was an absolute treasure trove in terms of pie flavors. Buttery, golden crusts framed various different fillings. Little paper cards were tented in front of groups of slices; apple and cranberry, key lime, pecan, cherry were only a few among the slices present. Dean could feel his heart giving out, he hadn't seen a selection like this in years. His mouth was watering at the sight; which should he choose? Cherry, a classic and solidly his favorite? Or key lime, just to spice it up a bit from his usual slices. “Oh and they’re homemade by yours truly.”
Sam shrugged, “Godspeed?”
“Like hallucinations?”
She sighed- overexaggerated and flamboyant- and grinned, “You caught me. Takashi and I own a clothing company, real avant-garde stuff. Probably wouldn’t find it in your neck of the woods.” Dean was trying so hard to be civil, “By the way, Dean, what
Sam puffed his cheeks, “That throws a wrench into things.”
chapter name: Good Days - SZA
Castiel averted his eyes, opting to look at his scuffed dress shoes instead. “Before we continue with the farce, I think it would be beneficial to set boundaries. I, as I’ve said before, have no qualms about pretending to be your lover. However, you seemed to be uncomfortable.” He shifted his gaze to Dean- those blue,
He cleared his throat, dispelling the silence in the air. Clapping a hand on Cas’ shoulder, Dean sighed. “Alright angel, why don’t you take a nap and I scope this place out? Sound good?”
,” Leo began again, huffing at the interruptions. “All the people who died supposedly had freaky dreams, right? If you see this wolf in your dreams and it dies, that’s a death omen. What if the statues are haunted?” He raised his hands, fluttering the fingers together, making stereotypically spooky noises from children’s movies.
i told y'all it was longer!! anywho chapters will come a bit slower now. enjoy
Dean blinks, caught off guard. “Like, now, Cas go pack it up for them please.” Castiel nods and slides out of the booth to the back room. He turns back to Andrew and Liv. “It’s weird and it’s going to take some adjusting. But if you ever run into something strange, don’t hesitate to call our number.” He hands thick cardstock to Andrew. It reads: Dean, Sam, & Cas. 785-555-2131. That must be who the Sammy Burger is named after. Castiel comes back with the containers and hands them to Liv and Andrew.
“Oh my god.”
They were made out of cedar, stained with a honey brown finish. They were two creatures- mouth drawn in a vicious snarl and eyes mocking, but all-knowing. Glittering rosaries were clutched in their jaws, almost like they were protecting them. Thin, wooden fur was texturized onto the creatures, it covered the whole body- all the way up to their bat-like ears. Its’ arms were curled inwards, tucked against its body, and Dean noticed that the creatures’ thumbs were held in their mouths. He stepped to the left, the eyes followed him. He stepped to the right, the eyes followed him. It was unsettling. These things were not normal carvings. They knew something. Dean didn’t know what.
Castiel finally finished reading the article, “They specialize in…
The light melts away and reveals another man, from Liv’s unsurprised reaction, Andrew assumes it’s the one from the gas station. The young Harrison Ford gestures for all of them to sit down; Andrew and Liv on one side, them on the other. Belatedly, Andrew realizes their food is taking awhile.
Whipping out his phone, Dean dialed Bobby's number. He noticed that the cell reception was marginally better in his room. Was there a jammer downstairs? He made a mental note to ask Sam about the employee only areas. The gruff voice crackled through the speaker. "Yeah?"
“Dean!” Sam called as a second shotgun blast rang through the forest. He took off, heading for the tree line as fast as his legs could carry him, forgoing anything he had seen on the map. It was near pitch-black under the tree canopy, the only source of light was the built-in torch on Sam’s cell. A third shot gun blast echoed around them.
He was just left with that tiny little voice in the back of his head. The tiny insignificant gnat-like buzzing that he had been trying to ignore the moment he was locked up in solitary confinement, the only problem was, that
And while your there, go give me a follow :)
“So do you.”
“So, you’ve been texting. You haven’t seen him?”
As soon as they were given the keys to their respected rooms Sam had them both on lockdown. Neither he nor Cas was allowed to help with the preparation for tomorrow (which, Dean was glad of, to be honest) but he soon realised that meant he wasn’t allowed to see anyone. Especially Cas.
“No, no, no” Dean cut him off knowing exactly where he was going, and Dean didn’t want to hear it. But he charged into that gateway and burst right through it. “Listen to me, listen. It wasn’t… you didn’t do anything, you understand that? … and
Keeping to the shadows, he reached the landing watching the pair as they had a brief chat and departing in opposite directions.  Jack headed towards the banquet hall, a doorway that led from the right of the main hotel lobby, while Sam headed towards a corridor that led under the staircase. Castiel sprang from his hiding place towards the stairs, hurriedly taking the steps and dashing across the main lobby towards the large oak front door of the establishment.
Castiel breathed a sigh of relief, if Dean was to be waiting on him to get intel, he’d be waiting a long time. At least Jack was quicker at this stuff. Moving away from the bathroom finally, he aimed to go sit beside Jack on the bed, but his attention was drawn to a knock at their room door.
“You’re bleeding again,” Castiel gruffed, as he came to crouch in front of him, hands resting on his knees as wide worried blues stared up at him.
Dean could have lay there all morning, hell, he could have laid there all day. But nature was calling. He tried to shift his weight gently, not wanting to wake him, but his efforts were cut short as the arm around him gripped tighter and a soft grumble rumbled into his chest. “Noooo” Cas muttered, gripping his shirt in emphasis.
God, he needed a drink right now. Stupid Sammy and his stupid rules.
Sam patted at his pockets, checking to find his phone. “Message? What message? I didn’t send-”
He’s right, this wasn’t the reason for his call. Now or never. “Here’s the thing… um … Can I tell you something? Even if it sounds really weird.”
Castiel adjusted the shotgun that rested on his shoulder while juggling the flashlight in his free hand, grateful that Dean had offered to carry the duffle bag, unsure that he would have been able to manage it. The beam from the torch bounced from tree to tree, casting misshapen shadows around them as the pair kept in step following the small path. A path that they hoped led to the crypt. The map Cas had found was dated. There was no way of even knowing if the crypt was still there, maybe it got demolished years ago when the place was turned into a resort, which would explain the state of the path they walked on. But if her body wasn’t there to burn, then that would lead to bigger problems. They walked for what felt like an eternity when something caught Cas’s eye through the trees.
“Dude!” Dean looked up, the crowbar once again wedged between the headstone and the wall. Cas offered a shrug in the way of an apology.
“Because I’m not pissed at her for going out on a ghost hunt last night and not telling me about it.” She said with a scowl that flicked between him and Jack. Making the pair shared a cautious glance at one another.
Castiel did all he could to not show his excitement at being left alone again. This was the escape he needed. Jack nodded, sliding off the bed to follow Sam. But before he left the room fully, he turned to Cas, “I found some interesting stuff.” He whispered, trying not to let Sam hear, all while offering him that endearing smile of his.
Dean sighed, taking his fiancé's hand. His fingers slipping into the space between empty digits like they were meant to fit there. “Look, I just never thought I would get this, y’know, this opportunity. And it scares me man, like, what if I screw everything up, or, you realise you can do better. If it all goes wrong, I… I just don’t want to end up like dad.” As soon as the words fell from his lips the realisation slapped him harder in the face than any sorned lover ever had. John Winchester would never win father of the year, torn up by so much trauma that he became a bitter resentful man. He had seen what true heartbreak could do first-hand, and he never wanted to experience that.
A distinct clatter came from behind him, one that made Castiel turn to examine. His fiancé had fetched the duffle bag from outside and dumped it unceremoniously on the floor in the centre of the room, hands digging around inside as he crouched over the opened bag. “Bring that light over here would ya.”
“No!” Dean called turning to half yell at the phone, the salt canister clutched to his chest. “Kid, Sam can’t know about this, he’s got enough on his plate with all the wedding crap.”
“Shhh”
Her smile never faltered. “Don’t worry. Everything will look wonderful for your brother’s big day.”
“Why would there be unhappiness before a wedding?” Castiel asked
Dean stopped pouring abruptly, turning to face his brother, the glass pot still in hand.
“Cas seems to be enjoying the comic books I bought him. Maybe I’ll take some to Dean.”
“You’re scared?”
“I think it’s best,” Cas muttered in reply, his voice raw with emotion. “You guys don’t need me hanging around here.”
Cas seemed to completely relax, giving Sam a reassuring smirk, “He makes that very difficult.”
Dean’s head was fuzzy, his ears ringing, and the dull ache that spread throughout his skull was getting more intense the quicker he was made to move. But he kept moving. The bright lights of the hotel burned his eyes, he was surprised he had the wherewithal to find the room key in his pocket. Sliding it into the lock and pushing the door open, practically falling into the room. Castiel’s arm was hooked under his elbow as he led him towards the bed forcing him to sit.
really who Cas wanted to spend the rest of his life with? That didn’t seem right. A low-key raging alcoholic with so much baggage that they would need to charter their own cargo plane. And let’s not forget their unhealthy helping of emotional ineptitude, after all, it to him 12 fucking years and the act of Castiel sacrificing himself to even tell the guy how he really felt. Seriously?! This was who Cas was into?
“’bout what?”
, the Grey Lady. Lady Windemere.”
“Cas, No…” Deans legs relaxed, pushing himself away from his headboard, trying to get closer to him, wanting to reach out to him. “I’m… I didn’t… I’m sorry.”
“I’m not being a Bridezilla!” Sam frowned, arms coming to fold across his chest.
Cas huffed. Could still hear that smile. “We’ve been through much together you and I, been so lost and now, we're not lost anymore. Because I love you.”
“So, you’ve been texting. You haven’t seen him?” Sam’s eyebrow raised in a questioning fashion.
“You’re shaking.” He observed. Dean hadn’t even noticed, but his entire body felt like it was vibrating. A strong mixture of adrenaline and fear coursing through every inch of him.
The faint rustle of fabric brushed down the receiver, imagining Cas rolling over in bed. “It’s the middle of the night.”
watched him. Watched his Adam's apple bob as he swallowed, glossed over his messy bed hair, his darkening 5’oclock shadow, his pleased smile and closed eyes as he savoured the taste of his drink. “I really did miss the taste of coffee.”
Castiel reached for his collar, popping the thing up as he adjusted the blue strand around his neck, “It's just about practise. You’ll get there.” he said, and before he knew it the tie was in perfect proportion, perfectly aligned. Turning him back around to face the mirror Jack adjusted the collar of his shirt and smoothed down the tie.
“And you’ll show them to your staff to make sure they get them perfect?”
His eyes lifted from the carrier to the cocky smirk of his partner, the barrel of the sworn off rested casually on his right shoulder. “You’ve already seen me in
Castiel took a moment to consider his offer, but he moved from the door. Walking passed the laundry Dean forgot to do earlier and sat tentatively on the edge of his bed with enough space between them to park a speed boat. “I… I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.” He admitted, his gruff timbre voice sounding more horse than it ever did.
“Knew you’d like it.” Dean smirked “Didn’t even get to show you the TV in the bathroom.”
Castiel sprang into action, with his camera phone he snapped a picture of the last image and slammed the lid to the laptop shut. Darting across the room to pull on his boots and swiping the room key from the top of the dresser. He hesitated slightly as his hand reached the door handle. Creaking the door open just enough to poke his head out, he checked each direction of the hallway to make sure the coast was clear. To his left nothing but an empty hallway and the cleaning maid’s cart. To the right, the backs of Jack and Sam grew smaller as they headed towards the grand staircase that led towards the main reception. As they rounded a corner and disappeared towards the stairs Castiel made his move. Slipping quietly out the room he hurried down the hallway following the path his family had taken.
“You sure that’s wise?” Sam asked, his attention flicking up towards his brother, fresh round in his hand primed and ready to insert. “We don’t want to draw attention to us. Or, y’know. Get arrested the night before the wedding.”
“It looks beautiful Sam.” Castiel had cooed, patting his shoulder.
He was a jumbled mix of emotions. Anger, hatred, but most gripping was the fear. The fear of admitting something that he had kept buried deep down inside him for years. Because if he didn’t. He was going to lose him all over again.
He was talking with the concierge of the hotel, going over all the last-minute details of the big day tomorrow. Melissa had been super helpful with everything, helping Sam plan everything down to the most ridiculous minor detail, but even now, his patience was starting to wain thin.
“It’s Cas. He’s gone.”
“I got it,” Jack muttered, Castiel stepped aside as the Nephilim took his spot, with two fingers raised he pressed them to Dean’s forehead. The familiar warming glow emanated through his body, like liquid gold spreading and washing through every limb, eroding the pain away like it was nothing. In a blink of an eye Dean’s head was cleared of any ounce of pain, any fuzzy woolliness he was feeling along with any physical scratch, cut or tiny little bruises faded into nothingness.
“You mean, like this one?”
proud of that. Chuck was gone. Jack was the new force to be reckoned with, and everything is how it should be… right?
“yeah
The duffle bag was yanked from his shoulder as Castiel rummaged around inside, tossing the canister of salt to his brother and Sam catching it with ease. He moved to the door, pouring a deliberate line of salt beyond the threshold, while moving swiftly to the window he pours another line with precise accuracy.
“What the hell is going on!” He demanded, lowering the gun and glaring at the pair of them. Castiel and Jack were helping Dean to his feet, groaning in pain and annoyance as he reached his full height. His hand still clamped to the back of his head.
Sure, it would have been super simple to just ‘magic’ the tie into place, but since Castiel’s return, Jack felt complied to not use his powers so much around him. He knew first-hand what it felt like to feel powerless, unhelpful, watching Cas able to perform simple tasks with just the flick of a wrist always gave him a sense of uselessness and dare he says, jealousy. He didn’t want anyone to feel that way around him. Besides, learning to do things the “human” way was kind of fun to learn.
Up and out of bed, natures call taken care of, he wandered through the halls towards the kitchen. Unsurprised to find his brother at the table, phone to his ear and that look of worry etched across his face. His wide stare met Deans as he stepped down into the kitchen, wrapping is robe a little tighter around his waist. “What?” he asked in passing, noticing a fresh pot already brewed and helping himself to two mugs.
amazing work <3
Sam threw his head back with a bark of a laugh, knowing his brother he would leave everything to the last minute and would probably have them marry in some run-down mom and pops diner off the highway that quoted having the ‘Best Pie in the State’. “We could ask Cas?” Sam suggested with a shrug, “at least he would make some kind of effort.”
“But why? What did you do to piss it off?”
“Hey, whoa their cowboy.” Dean butted in before he could even finish that thought. A hand raising in defence, “I never said that.”
The man shrugged “That doesn’t mean I don’t enjoy seeing it.” He replied with a downright wolfish grin and a wink. This man was insatiable.
amazing work <3
Dean just sat there, knees drawn to his chest, forearms resting atop his knees, hand clutching his phone, his wrists hanging over into the empty space. It had only been three days. But they felt like three of the longest days in Dean’s life. They had saved the world. Dean should be proud of that, hell, he
With a spring in his step, he headed to the reception. Sure enough, Melissa was waiting behind the desk with three small white boxes sitting beside her. “Sorry,” she said sheepishly as Jack approached, pushing the boxes towards him. “I would have brought them up myself, but I’m technically not allowed to leave the desk until my cover arrives.”
Turning towards his
He found his stare, as blue as the mid-morning sky but watery, tears threatening the corners of them. He entered his room, closing the door gently behind him and standing awkwardly, trying desperately to avoid all eye contact, and not straying any further away from the door. “You jus’ gonna stand there?” Dean found himself saying, but Cas didn’t move.
Jack couldn’t place the bubbling sensation he felt in his stomach. He was excited, that was a given, he had never been to anything like this, ever. But he also felt nervous, or maybe he was just picking up on whatever Castiel was currently going through. He currently stood in the entrance hall of the hotel, chewing his lips. His wide-eyed stare trained on the door in front of him waiting for the moment Melissa will walk back through, letting him know it was time.
, Dean.” He retorted playfully.
He checked the large antique wardrobe, to find nothing but empty space and a few wire hangers that clicked together softly, he lifted the covers to check under the bed, even returned to the bathroom just in case he missed it. But no. His overnight bag was gone.
“Seen? Seen who?” Dean asked, trying to conceal the fire poker as best he could from the maid while simultaneously wiping away another fresh trickle of blood from his forehead.
“You did the right thing, Jack. Where are they?”
A future with a century’s old ex-angel of the lord and whatever time he had left in his
She appeared, eyes wide staring down at the hat, looking back up at Dean as her translucent shape started to take on a new orange glow. “No!” she screeched. Imitated flames spread up her torso as she continued to scream, and within seconds the spectre burned up quicker than a piece of paper.
Turning his attention back to the maid, she already began busying herself reloading more towels into the closet. “So, you’ve seen her too?” he found himself asking.
“Pretty. I’m all done with the chairs. Just need to add the flowers.”
Two of the three boxes looked identical, both containing buttonholes for the grooms and their best men. One was made with a single white rose and a fancy leaf as a backdrop, the handwritten sticker on the box indicating it for the ‘Best Man’. While its box partner was still made from a similar rose it had extra greenery and smaller blue/purplish and white flowers decorating it making it look incredibly flamboyant. Those were for the ‘Groom’. However, in the third box was something called a corsage. A similar arrangement to grooms flowers, but instead of being pinned to a jacket, this one would be worn on Eileen’s wrist.
However brief his relief had been at seeing Dean safe and well was quickly tarnished by the flecks of dried blood that was sticking to his fiancé’s temple, clotting in his short hair. “You're still bleeding” Castiel observed reaching for his partner and stroking a tentative thumb over the small wound.
“Bridezilla huh?” He announced to the room. “I’ll show you Bridezi-” he trailed off, realizing that he was talking to an empty room. “Dean?” The honeymoon suite looked as it had when he left Dean in there over an hour ago, untouched. Walking through the room he headed into the open bathroom, unsurprised to find it empty, he hung his suit on the clothes hook a little more harshly than he probably should have. His jaw clenching as he glared and retrieved his phone from his pocket. [You had one job Dean! Where are you?!] he texted feverishly, a fresh bubbling rage stirring in the pit of his stomach. Like he didn’t have enough to worry about right now.
“Woah. Woah Sammy, chill. It's to early for a freakout.” Dean said returning to make the pair of them coffee.
Cas wrung his hands nervously. “Can I –
Ducking back down into the hallway he had just come from he did the only thing he could think of. Hide. Pressing his back closest to the wall as he could manage hoping that neither of them saw him. When he was certain that the alarm hadn’t been raised, he dialled Cas’s number.
Sam’s features seemed to relax at Castiel’s half-truth. A small smile and shake of his head relaxed him, seemingly satisfied with Castiel’s response that Dean was pressuring him to go swimming together. As he headed to leave the room, taking the tension out of Cas’s shoulders with him, he stopped, door half open with the handle in hand as he addressed Jack. “Could you go give Eileen and Jody a hand downstairs. I might be a while.”
And while your there, go give me a follow :)
As suspected no alarm bells sounded, no police dogs trained by his brother came charging after him and unsurprisingly the world didn’t end when he crossed that threshold. He knew he could have left anytime he wanted. And yes, eventually Dean would have got bored and tried to push his luck against his brother, but for the most part, he just wanted to keep Sam happy. But this was serious business. Trust his brother to pick the only venue with a vengeful spirit. His brain working overtime, he needed to figure out a plan, and quickly.
Jack flinched at Sam’s outburst. He moved from the dresser to sit beside the laptop on his bed, turning the computer so Sam could look at the screen. It was a map, that was clear enough to see, but as Sam took a step closer it was clear that it wasn’t just any old map, it was a simple looking schematic of this hotel and its grounds. “Dean was attacked. By a ghost. They’re salting a burning her right now”
His eyebrows raised. Sam said that none of the couples had been there for all of the deaths, but a couple of regulars could pay off the staff, right? Ximena threw her head back and chuckled, brushing nonexistent crumbs off her pristine white blouse. “Ivy and I just happen to be well off. I work as a cardiothoracic surgeon and she’s a managing director for J.P Morgan.”
Dean looked in the rearview mirror, locking eyes with Castiel. “Cas, don’t encourage this. What if this resort, uh, doesn’t like the taste of the rainbow?” He didn’t want to get run out of town before they could save these people’s lives. Although, he wouldn’t especially care at that point.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, no shit.” Dean glanced back to check on Cas, he was almost at the front desk. “Listen, I gotta catch you later.”
“No? I don’t think? I mean they only look racist because of that army surplus look they have going on. The only people who shop there are white supremacists. But I’m ninety-nine percent sure Old Logan Lerman is in a relationship with the angel. The other one, not the younger one.” Andrew quirks his head at this one. Liv nods again, “Yeah like relationship relationship.”
Andrew leans back and gestures for Liv to start talking. She flies into a flurry of hand gestures. “Okay so I go to Gas N Sip, right? And I’m just trying to get my usual and then I see this guy. He’s cute, but older, a Bradley Cooper type. Except, he’s decked in army surplus stuff and flannel. So immediately, I’m thinking: racist, but I notice this really bright light next to him. And when I say bright, I mean bright, like football stadium bright. I turn to look at the light and it’s this real big thing, like passing through the aisles, doesn’t fit in the building type of big. It has a bunch of faces that are all talking, it has rings with symbols around it, but the biggest thing was that it. had. wings. And it’s holding hands with the Bradley Cooper guy.”
Sam had ditched the two of them already, going to the employees-only area for his interview, so Dean had no distraction from Castiel walking so close to him. Damn his inability to respect personal space. Dean started to zone out and listen to the white noise in the hotel, eyes unfocused on a golden lion ornament adorning a large Christmas tree. Cas leaned into his ear, a puff of breath teasing the tips of Dean’s ear. He just barely suppressed a full body shudder. “There are enochian wards carved into the windowsills, I believe I saw a devil’s trap under the entrance rug, too.”
He kept them in his peripheral as he knocked on the table twice as a greeting. “Heya Sammy, we have a bit of an issue.”
you do for a living?”
He shook off the unease, opting to return to the public elevator and check in with Sam. They were dealing with something different. Something odd.
“We disagree on the fate of the world.” Dean took it back, Cas wasn’t anywhere close to a good actor. What the hell was he doing?
"Not to. Anyways, Dad, listen to me. I'm gonna sound insane, but just listen."
“Okay, Cupid, how do you suppose we do that? None of us are in a relationship and I sure as hell ain’t pretending with you.” Dean shuddered at the thought, maybe they could be temp workers or something.
. Drool pooled in the corner of his mouth where it rested on the pillow and his breaths were long and deep. Slowly, Dean took off each of his dress shoes to make him more comfortable. The trenchcoat was a whole other challenge.
It was quiet for a second- Bobby's hums and papers shifting being the only noises that registered through the receiver. "Alright, Alps- German folklore. They're mischievous sons of bitches; they mess with dreams, cause bad luck, and other really annoying things. Close relative of the vampire, but can only be injured by sticking a lemon in its mouth." Dean could hear the papers being set down when Bobby puffed out a breath. "These things are extinct, Dean. There's only a couple things about them post medieval age. A group of Germans supposedly hunted every last one of them down. That can't be your baddie, kid."
“Are you scared of loving Castiel?”
“So what’s the theory? Racist angels?”
“Well, two things really.” He held up a ringed finger, “One, Cas is human, basically. Dude’s like an X-Men, has some powers but not
It wasn’t cold, like a pool, or warm, like a Florida swamp. Just comfortable. He didn’t have clothes on, but he wasn’t cold. Dean lifted a hand up, the water slid off of him like oil and shone in the moonlight as it fell. He sat up completely, forcing himself against an impossible weight. He was in a sort of abyss- there was nothing but liquid around him- the sky was a dark green and blue hue and a full moon hung above. The water smelled salty, like a beach they visited on Sammy’s ninth birthday. Splashes could be heard from his left, he turned towards the noise. It felt like slow motion- or something heavy was tied around his neck. It took all his effort to turn, leaving his chest tight.
Dean covered a chuckle with a cough, shaking his head profusely. "Nah,
A figure was taking in their surroundings like they had just been dropped in a foreign place like him. He blinked and there he was. Castiel was in front of him in a similar state undress, his eyes dark in the green light. Dean reached a hand up- he felt lighter, lighter than he had ever been- and ran a hand over Cas’ cheek. It was smooth- freshly shaven- and soft. The angel leaned into the touch, letting out a soft breath that tickled Dean’s fingers. Dean swallowed, noting how Castiel watched the movement before looking back into Dean’s eyes. The angel raised his hands to cradle Dean’s face, his biceps flexing with the effort.
Trying to break out of a high-security prison would be easier than breaking out of a deal with the Empty it would seem. For Castiel to be able to return to the mortal plane he and Jack had to make a decision that wouldn’t be taken lightly. Castiel would be allowed to return, but his grace, essentially what made him an angel, would remain in the Empty. And the big dumb baby in a trench coat agreed. And now he’s back. And Dean didn’t know how to cope.
“I know.” Jack sighed. “Sam will be very angry at me.”

Rounding the large Victorian building he headed to where he was sure the parking lot was. The high gloss black paint and chrome was hard to miss by any standards, the Impala wasn’t exactly your average car. But to Castiel, it was like seeing a familiar face in a crowded room, and it always brought him that same sentiment of comfort. Or maybe it had something to do with the cars’ owner who was currently bent over, digging around inside the open trunk. His steps crunched across the gravel lain parking lot causing his fiancé to look up in surprise. His expression softened as he returned to rummaging, “Took you long enough” he quipped with a slight smirk. “What'd you find?”
Dean swallowed hard, but his lips twitched at the sight that stood before him. Familiar dark hair looking dishevelled and slept in more than usual. A dark grey t-shirt hugged strong shoulders and torso nicely in all the right places, but what made Dean smile the most was the familiar hotdog endorsed pyjama bottoms that he lent Cas on his first night back. They were a little long in the leg, 10 pink toes sticking out from under the hem. But Dean had to admit they suited him.
“S-sorry” he muttered.
“You guys look great” Sam commented, roughly drying his hair with the towel as he wandered over to the dresser to examine the flowers as Jack tentatively placed them on the wooden surface, while casually swapping out the towel for the white button-down shirt that lay on the bed.
His brother was the one to make a move. Like a bullet out of a gun, he charged at the man, scooping him up into a Sam Winchester bear hug. But Dean didn’t move, in fear that his legs would give out from underneath him. Limbs turning to jelly as he stared into eyes that a few hours ago, he was saying goodbye to. Tears streaming down tanned cheeks with a haunting smile as he welcomed his fate. The pride Dean stored in his chest dissolved quicker than sugar into a hot cup of coffee, replaced with an emotion that Dean couldn’t quite figure out. Castiel. He was back.
Jack shrugged. “That’s what they told me. Cas had me look up the info on this Lady Windemere. She’s buried somewhere in the woods.”
Go check out
“I’m fine. Just a little rattled . Did Jack bring his laptop? I need you to look up something for me.”
“I know.” Sam scoffed “I never thought I’d see the day. Not that she needs it anyway.”
for the sake of the Winchesters. With Chuck gone and no one to pull the strings anymore, they were free to do whatever they wanted, finally. But did
“I would never-”
Sam swung his weapon again, soon followed by Jack. She seemed to be reappearing quicker and each attempt was one step closer to Dean. She was a breath away from Dean when Castile swung the fire poker, inches away from hitting Dean square in the chest. “Careful with that!”
“That I can’t bear children and give you a family.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel groaned, his head rolling back to look at the ceiling. “Where are you now?”
“Dean, I’m not mad at you. You understand?”
She smiled sweetly, returning to her work. “You’re not the first one to come running out of these rooms after seeing her. Shoot, the number of couples I’ve seen demanding refunds for their weddings, looking white as a sheet. At least you’re not screaming.” She chuckles deeply again.
“Dean?” Sam bellowed, his voice echoing off the building.
Jack hummed in agreement, “Sam did say there were a few,” he replied with a nod and a small smile. “But nothing anyone could confirm.”
Eileen pulled a face, her nose scrunching looking both adorable and disgusted. “We could get Dean to plan it… it’s only fair.”
His fiancé stepped forward, eyes wide, questioning. Clearly trying to force his lips not to frown. “d-do you not want to-”
Sam stood on the opposite side of the closed door, greeting him in kind Cas stepped aside to let him in. Sam did not look happy right now, the stress of the day starting to get to him. His usually flawless hair was looking ragged and shapeless, his cheeks flushed, and his face seemed to be fixed with a hardening scowl. Passing a confused glance towards Jack who just shrugged in response, as Castiel answered unusual questioned proposed to him, as he watched the youngest Winchester seemingly examine the room like he was a drill sergeant during inspection.
“He didn’t
“Your right.” And with that, his eyes returned to the screen, and he began to type away.

Sam moved, his keen hunter instincts kicking in, swiping up the gun from the floor and firing a salt round straight through her head. The apparition dissolving into the darkness around them.
“Shit, ok.” Dean groused, scrubbing a hand across his face “Plan stays the same, just gotta make sure I don’t get got by the ghost or my brother.”
Castiel chuckled. “I think were beyond that by this point.”
Dean chuckled “yeah well I like your… Wait, is that?” His hand reached out, his thumb and forefinger tracing down the fabric of Castiel’s tie eyes widening.
His room was a far cry from the ratty motel rooms they were used to. The king-sized bed was clean for starters and had no magic finger coin slot insight. It was tastefully decorated too, with pale cream walls, lush floral-patterned carpet. And a bathroom that was big enough to fit more than two people in. “How the other half live” Sam mused as he hung his garment bag in the bathroom next to the silky teal coloured dress that belonged to his fiancée. He had yet to see her in the dress. He was so used to seeing her in layers of plaid and denim that it was almost worth the wait.
had been growing louder and louder and was making it exceedingly difficult to disregard.
“And that’s my cue. See you boys down there.”
“Does Dean know about this?” Sam questioned. But given Castiel’s lack of reply, it was all the answer his brother and Dean needed to hear. “Let me talk to him. Maybe I can-”
The End.
Jack was quick off the draw, closing the door and lining the floor with salt then onto the windows, mimicking Sam’s earlier work. “Ok. Start lookin’” Sam muttered quietly, but the hight of the room carried his voice like he had practically shouted his command. The four of them splintered off into different corners of the room. His eyes scanned the shelves, cabinets glancing over knickknacks when his brother piped up.
“Of course you were,” Dean muttered with a chuckle, “well, better than nothing.” Taking Cas’s discarded gun beside him on the bed he cocked the chamber, one salt round left, reaching for the duffle he reloaded the gun with more rounds.
“Thank you. The tie was difficult.”
“They told me not to,” Jack argued back, his body slouched against the dresser, “they said they didn’t want you to know. They’re going to be so mad at me.”
The ghost dispersed before his eyes in a grey mist and Dean crashed to the solid stone hearth knees first, the iron cast fire poker clattering to the ground beside him. He gasped for air, clutching at his throat as he desperately tried to take in lungs full of oxygen. Something warm oozed down his forehead, irritating the skin with an uncomforting tickle. Wiping it away he winces at the sudden flare-up of pain. His head had been cut open; his palm smeared with fresh blood. But he had no time to recuperate or assess his injuries, she could be back any moment. Swiping up his makeshift weapon he scrambled to his feet and towards the door.
Dean chuckled. “I gotta pee.” With a groan, Cas let go of him, flipping over and settling his head back down onto the pillow with a disgruntled flop. Dean beamed, he really needed to stop smiling so much. He lent across and planted a soft kiss on the back of messy hair, which warranted a pleased murmur. “You want coffee?” he asked trailing a hand up his arm, tracing the goose flesh that rose over his bicep.
A large velvet sofa with a matching armchair sat angled in the centre of the room, giving a view of the small TV that was perched on a low-down table and the iron cast fireplace. Beside that was the large floor to ceiling bay window where Dean currently stood, filling the room with light and a nice view of what would later be the sunrise that they could watch from the comfort of their big ass fancy bed. The bathroom alone was bigger than Dean’s room at the bunker. Separated from the main room by a brick archway it had all the main necessities, sinks, vanity unit, separate shower cubical and a deep roll top bathtub that had another TV mounted into the tiled wall at the tap end.
“Yeah, they're not coming till tomorrow.” Sam sighed as he reached Jack. The four beige coloured bags came with individual tags, the top two visible from where Sam stood. ‘D. Winchester – Groom.’ ‘S. Winchester – Best Man’. Carefully scooping the top two from Jack's arms he lay them across his own, the contents feeling a lot heavier than he was expecting. “Take yours and Cas’s to your room. I’ll take Dean’s.”
“Thank you, Jack.” He replied sharing the gesture, as he watched the younger man disappear into the hallway. Scooping up the laptop he glanced briefly at the page Jack had found. It seemed to be a historian piece, more about the history of the hotel than anything, but the words Mausoleum jumped out at him. Following the linked page, it loaded up a slide show of three images. The first was of the exterior of the tomb, a box-like marble structure surrounded by dense trees, the name Windermere engraved in the frontage. The second, was the interior, the pale grey marble carrying on inside with at least 4 obvious gravesites. The third was a map, that seemed to depict the manor house in its former glory (before it was turned into the hotel) and the location of where the Mausoleum is said to be.
Planting another kiss on his cheek Eileen turned and walked through one of the many archways the branched from the entrance. Jody stepped forward briefly to squeeze Sam’s shoulder and whisper “Stop stressing out. Everything is going to be fine” in his ear before moving away to follow his fiancée. “And go check on your brother,” she called over her shoulder before disappearing out of slight.
They made it out of the forest, the glowing light from the hotel greeting them like a welcoming beacon but it didn’t stop them running. They crunched across the gravel parking lot, straight to the front door. Out of breath and panicked, he and Cas tried to stow the weapons as best they could as they tried to
“Jack. I’m going to put you on speaker.” Cas stated, not hearing his reply as he pressed the speaker icon and placed his phone on a nearby shelf in amongst some dusty stone urns.
“There’s a stairwell at the end of this hallway.” Sam answered as Dean re-joined the gathering, “should take us straight up there.”
After being handed the lighter fluid by his fiancé, Castile squirted copious amounts of it into the hole making sure to saturate the whole body, while Dean tossed in the salt. “Yes. She attacked Dean in his room. We’re salting and burning the body right now”
…::::::…
, and that sweat on your forehead is just because it's hot in here, right?” instinctively Dean drew his hand up to wipe at his brow, making Jody chuckle. “You’ll be fine.”
The lighter burst into life, the small orange flame was a welcomed sight. Holding it to the hat he was hoping it would catch quickly. It did. Dean tossed the hat into the fireplace as he watched the orange heat lap up the material hungrily.
Dean raised an eyebrow stepping aside and letting them both enter. “And it takes two of you to deliver it?”
pretty scary stuff.” He smiled “But a good scary … ‘cause, we’ll be ok.”
Dean was the first to pull away completely, walking in amongst the display cases. Navigating through tall glass houses containing everything from ancient garden tools, toys, even handwritten letters but everything seemed pretty mundane, nothing eye-grabbing. Until he came across a cabinet of what looked like old family photos.
“Gunshot” Sam finished. A shotgun blast if he wasn’t mistaken. The sound sounded close by, but in the echo of the forest, it would be hard to pinpoint exactly where.
Sam snorted “Does he ever? I think cabin fever might be setting in.”
“Well, we wouldn’t be very good hunters if we didn’t at least look into the lore.” He bluffed. Feeling his insides sag with relief when Jack looked up at him beaming over the edge of the screen. That boyish grin plastered from ear to ear.
With his suit deposited, Sam left, returning towards the staircase and towards the pricier rooms the hotel had to offer. This corridor had fewer doors on either side, only 4 rooms were located down this hallway. All suites, mostly used for the ‘Honeymooning’ couples.  He fumbled in his pocket again to retrieve the other room key he had in his possession. A key, which will be given to Cas after tomorrow. The door clicked with a familiar electronic whirring and Sam pushed open it open.
“Dean?”
Jacks cell phone buzzed in his pants pocket. Slipping the phone out he saw Sam’s name flash up across the caller ID and accepted the call. “Hey, the flowers have arrived. Could you head down and collect them for me.” He asked, “I’ve just got out the shower and Eileen’s putting on her make-up.”
“Mine?” Dean questioned as he stood stock still while Jody attached the flower, “Oh, they're peachy.”
Dean lifted his stare to the ceiling. “I mean… everything. I get what I’ve been doing lately, you know, with the yelling and the... acting like I’m a prison guard it's just, it’s not me. And I’m sorry, I really am.” He closed his eyes, hating the deafening silence that rang over the phone line.
“Well… where is he?”
“Exactly. So, we need to figure out what that is.”
The question seemingly making the man jump, as he quickly tried to calm his composure, crossing his arms as he leant casually against the door frame towards their shared bathroom. “Me. I’m fine Cas. Say, you haven’t by chance spoken to Dean, have you?”
His eyes circled the room expecting to see… something. But nothing seemed out of place. The evening sun was starting to set, spreading a warming orange-gold hue to everything the light touched. A complete contrast to the icy chill that hung in the air around him. Instinctively Dean reached for his gun tucked into the waistband of his jeans, but mentally cussed himself out when he remembered Sam’s other stupid rule of ‘No Guns at the wedding’. He just needs to get to the Impala, load up on rock salt. The car keys sat on a small end table near the room’s door, but as Dean moved forward the flickering apparition appeared less than a foot away from him, blocking his only way in or out of the room.
’ worthy. It does appear that she may be buried somewhere on the grounds.” Fishing out his phone he showed Dean the map “If it hasn’t been demolished there should be Mausoleum.” he smiled in return.
“No! He wanted me to go with him for a swim, but I refused. I knew that would break
Cas spun on the spot, seeing that the laptop was now firmly situated on Jack’s lap. His head tilting to the side as he stared at the screen.
More silence, a silence that was cutting deeper into Dean more than any blade or bullet ever had. “That’s so good to hear.”
“Not a lot really. Says she took her own life after she was left at the altar. Her husband-to-be ran off with one of the maids. Most of the eyewitness accounts come from brides and grooms the night before their weddings. But it says she’s more frequently seen during times of discontent.”
“Well, I guess we find where she’s buried. Go salt and burn the bitch and we will be back in time for the nuptials. Piece of cake.” He said slamming the truck and locking it with a flourish.
The same five people all depicted within the sepia-toned print. An elderly regal-looking gentleman, even more stately looking wife and (what Dean assumed) their three children, two boys and a girl. The girl couldn’t have been much older than 6 and was the youngest of the trio, long dark hair rolling over her shoulders. It had to be her, a much younger her. Sure enough, the same girl was seen in many other photos, like looking through a timeline of her life, growing from a small child to a beautiful young lady. It was her alright. She seemingly wore the same unamused expression in every photo making her almost impossible to miss. As she got older, she seemingly kept to a very similar fashion style, a strikingly similar outfit to the one in the painted portrait that hung above the main staircase. Every image looking damn near identical, flowing white dress, ringlets of black hair cascading over her shoulder, tucked under a large floppy black sun hat. An idea struck him as he gazed upon the photos. “Look for a hat,” Dean called over his shoulder, still studying the photographs.
Sam breathed. That common throaty sound his brother always gave when he was figuring out a case. Dean’s attention flicking to his lanky-ass brother. Watching with mild annoyance as the penny slowly dropped and Sam’s vision slowly flicked between the pair. “Y’know… come to think of it…” he admitted, the ghost of a smirk pulling at his cheeks, “there was only
But the ex-angel never met his stare, concentrating on a patch of carpet by his feet. “Cas?” Sam provoked. “It’s ok if you have. I-I just need to know.”
“If you hit him, make sure it doesn’t bruise. Y’know, for the photos,” Sam joked with a smirk. As he took his tie and fastened it around his neck with annoying ease.
“Dearly Beloved. We are gathered here today-”
“Well don’t be. That’s why I’m here,” Jack said with a broad smile. “And as your best man I command you to stop being nervous.”
He knew it was ridiculous, he had heard the man himself say he was fine but seeing him standing there and sassing him let a small wave of relief wash over him. Dean was strong-willed; it would take a lot for him to admit defeat. Still keeping a watchful eye out about the place his pace quickened towards the car. “A few eyewitness accounts, but nothing ‘
“You got the rings, right?” Dean asked looking towards Jack. He smiled brightly, padding his jacket where the box currently sat in his pocket.
They reached the top of the landing, a squared strip of walkway that rounded the entrance hall like a balcony which splintered off into 3 different directions towards the guest rooms. He followed Jack down the narrow corridor, numbered doors on either side of them as their muffled footfalls met with the scarlet carpet. Sam managed to reach his room first, bidding a brief “see you in a sec” to Jack as he continued down towards his room. He managed to fumble his room key out his back pocket, trying hard to juggle the suits and not to drop them while sliding the card key into the electronic lock.
Dean cautiously sipped from his mug, as he pondered that thought. A thought that, in theory, should send him running to the Impala, hitting the gas and never looking back. But it didn’t. In fact, it made Dean’s chest filled with unexpected warmth.
“Are we sure about this?” Sam asked coming up behind his brother to gaze into the case. “This room is full of her stuff; she could be linked to anything.”
“W-well… Cas is sleeping.” He said in a hushed tone, “Yeah, he’s pretty tired” Sam’s eyes narrowed. Jack was a terrible liar; his bright boyish facade wasn’t fooling him. “s-so if you want to come back a little bit later-” he said starting to retreat from the door. Sam’s hand flew to the wood, stopping the slow swing.
“How do we get to the library?” Cas asked
“oh –erm– she’s just the subject of some ghost stories I heard about the place” Castiel replied quickly.
“Don’t care, it’s bad luck. You can’t see him until tomorrow.”
“It’s Jack” he announced, reading the name flashing across the screen.
… I’d like to…” He lifted his head from the floor, eyes finding him again and practically staring deeply into Dean’s soul.
The pounding in Dean's chest grew with intensity. “Y-yeah, yeah. Course.”
“Fine.” Jack answered, perching on the edge of the large and comfy bed “Although he seems quiet”
“Put a shirt on Winchester. You should be ready by now.” Jody quipped as she barged past into their room and ignoring the sudden blush that spread across Sam’s cheeks. Jack smiled showing him the boxes as he followed in behind.
“Where do you need me?”
Go check out
“Castiel it is.” Eileen beamed, reaching up onto her tiptoes to plant a kiss on his cheek.
The lock clicked open, Dean sliding the picks into his jacket pocket as he wrenched the glass panels open and reached for the hat. Running to the furthest side of the room where a grand old fireplace sat, he fumbled in his pocket for his silver lighter, snapping open the lid with a click and flicked the flint. Nothing happened, why did it never light first time round when he was in a hurry?! “Come on you son of a bitch” he muttered flicking it again, and again.
The mid-morning sun shone brightly in a clear and beautiful blue sky; the soft music suddenly changed as the procession neared the seated guests. The only input Dean was allowed to have in the whole day. Every seat was filled with faces Jack recognised, unsurprisingly all of them hunters. He smiled as Charlie winked at him as they walked past, Bobby curt upward nod, and Donna already had tears streaming down her cheeks. But then his eyes found The Winchesters. Sam stood proudly in the centre of the fairy light strewn gazebo, a black leather-bound book held tightly to his chest, beaming with pride as the pair approached. Dean stood to his right, taking a visible deep breath and smiling wildly, however his attention was solely on his soon to be husband. Peaking a quick glance to his left Jack could see Castiel’s watery-eyed attention was also fixed on Dean as he beamed. Reaching the wooden steps Jack took his position, as instructed, to the left on the bottom of the steps, looking across to Eileen who was situated at the right and passed him a small smile and a wink.
Castiel knew there was no way that Jack was sitting by the door, most likely sat on one of the comfortable beds. But the loud audible knock that came through the speaker was as clear as day. “Crap,” Jack muttered, the alarm in his voice obvious, “I think that’s Sam”
Enough! Dean pushed himself up from the bed. His heart was racing inside his chest, feeling every beat thump against his ribs. He needed air. He needed to get out of here. Dragging himself off the bed he stomped his feet back into his boots, swiped his jacket from where it lay across the back of the armchair and headed for the door. He didn’t even make it halfway through the room before he stopped dead in his tracks. His frantic breath coming up short and quick, and fogging on the air around him. He pushed out a deep long breath, much like a child would do whilst imitating a dragon on the first snow day of the year, and once again, it misted in front of him before disappearing into the air.
As he reached the landing one of the guest rooms closest to him opened suddenly as Jody Mills stepped out. “My, my.” She said her gaze casting up and down Jack’s frame “Don’t you look handsome.”
“A fireplace? Like, a real one?”
Their footfalls echoed around the hollowed marble chamber. The inside of the crypt was small compared to how grand it had looked outside, with the smell of damp strong in the air around them. The beam bouncing off nameplates and a row of urns that were all fixed to the four walls around them. There were 5 main tombs that they could see, each one of them housing a black marble headstone with golden lettering. Two on their left, three on the right. Cas brushed past Dean examining the tombs more closely, flashing the beam across each headstone until he found hers.
There was a small flurry of movement, Sam reaching the door first. Poking his head out through a thin crack of the door opening before stepping out, Jack flowing close behind, then Cas, then Dean, making sure the door was shut behind him.
Sam let out a long deep breath, the extra pair of hands would be beneficial. He ran his fingers through his hair before following Jody’s orders turning to head up the stairs. His foot met the bottom step as the door to the entrance hall opened again with Jack striding in.
Soaking the pad he lifted it to Dean’s head, wiping away any remains of blood. Wincing slightly as the pad contacted his skin, but he never said a word, letting Castiel clean away any remnants of his earlier encounter. “What happened?” He asked finally, satisfied there was no blood left marring his partners face and discarding the dirtied pad back into the med bag.
“Ok, let’s do this.”
“Good morning”
Another gunshot ricocheted through the trees followed by the command of “Keep going!” It was Dean’s voice, distant, but unmissable. Picking up speed again, the pair followed the path through the trees. Up ahead was a light that grew brighter, a wielding bouncing stream of it, unable to focus on one thing. Suddenly the light burst into the open stretch of the path before them, blinding them both as they skidded to a stop.
Dean’s eyes widened slightly, like a child who had just been caught with their hand in the cookie jar. His mouth dropping open to make his case, but instead, a strange, garbled noise escaped his lips. He offered him a small sheepish half-smile with a hint of a laugh. “I-I don’t … Not like that … Y-you know what I mean.”  Clearing his throat his eyes fell on the cell in Castiel’s hand. “Look, Jack, it’ll be an easy job. We’ll be back in our rooms in no time.”
“I know that” Dean swallowed, “and I do too. But, still, promising yourself to someone for the rest of your life. It’s pretty fuckin’ scary.”
“No, not right now, everything’s fine,” Sam said, his eyes darting around the vicinity to see if he could spot anything that would give his brother away. There was no wardrobe in this room, just a small dresser, the door to the bathroom was wide open, but shrouded in darkness. “Just wanted to come check on you,” he said, patting Castiel’s shoulder as he gravitated towards the darkened space. “See how you are.”
“More than usual?” Dean replied as he walked back into the room, tugging on the jacket and fiddling with the collar. Dean and Sam’s suits were a similar style to his and Cas’s but different in colour. There’s were a deep charcoal grey, a nice complement to the emerald green tie accessories.
Dusting his hands off Castiel stepped back over towards the phone scooping it up, while Dean moved back towards the duffle. “I may not have been fully honest with you Jack. That research I had you do… It was to help Dean”
The heavy weight on his chest was what woke him, he was pretty sure it had been there all night, but with his body slowly and unwillingly coming into consciousness he was very aware of it. A splay of dark hair under his chin along with an arm draped across him. Castiel’s body pressed tightly up against Dean’s, clinging onto him like a life preserver as soft snores escaped him. He smiled, his own arm wrapping around Cas’s torso, sliding over the fabric of his t-shirt. His trail stopping dead at the feel of bare skin and the jut of a hipbone. His shirt had ridden up in his sleep. Softly and carefully Dean extended his fingers, half still in the land of fabric sleep ware, while his pinkie and ring finger lay in unknown territory. He felt warm, soft, Dean wanting to explore more. But there was time for that later. And god, was Dean looking forward to it. But… baby steps. Sure, they may have spent the night together, fully clothed and in Deans bed. But that next step, while exciting as hell, was also really freakin’ terrifying.
“Long story.” He grumbled with a strain as they tried to move the stone. “We’ll be back soon though.”
Sam knew the place was perfect the moment he laid eyes on it. The large Neo-Gothic manor house looked like it had fallen straight out of the pages of a Fairy-tale. Sure, the place seemed like an odd eccentric building, that happened to be surrounded by woodland in the middle of nowhere. The Architecture alone was like nothing he had ever seen before, inspired by European design (which explained a lot). The outer shell had been aged by the elements turning it a sandy colour, and making the decorative brickworks around the arched windows and doorways stand out even more. The tall grey slate roof pointed with prominence into the skyline in sharp lines and spires, each peak adorned with ornate iron decoration. It even had a freakin’ turret with a spiral staircase inside leading to an observatory. This place just didn’t even compare to the others he had been scouting. There was something about this positively Victorian dwelling that drew the youngest Winchester to it.
“On my way”
Dean threw a glare towards his brother, but Sam’s goofy smile made any animosity he was harbouring fall away. Flicking his glance back to Cas, his wide blue stare considering him worryingly he shot him a playful wink to let him know everything was fine.
Sam’s quick thinking on his behalf when making the suit purchases. When the tailor had asked for a surname for the order, Castiel had frozen. Wasn’t sure what to say nor could he even think of a fake one off the top of his head. But Sam had jumped right in there with the reply. Good thing too, it made the ordering for the wedding much easier. It was pretty easy to pass off to strangers that Jack was his son, because, in a way, he already was.
Running a hand through his hair he practically ran back out the room. He wouldn’t. Would he? Sam checked his phone, there was no response from his brother.
“But that’s cheating” Jack replied with a whine, watching Castiel’s fingers work effortlessly, “I wanted to do it properly.”
Castiel swung the flashlight back towards the tomb on the furthest right-hand side of the pair. The name Catrina Windermere written in gold glinted in the bright light of the torch. As Dean moved forward positioning the crow by between the headstone and the wall the pair of them startled when Cas’s cell started to ring. Dean glowered at him, annoyed that the sound had spooked him. Cas offered a meek apology as he juggled the flashlight and gun in his possession, resting both of them by his feet while he slipped the phone out of his pocket.
“So, you want to tell me what’s going on?”
“We know you do,” Jody added, squeezing his chin lovingly. “But you’re running yourself ragged. So let me help. Give me a glue stick and some glitter and point me in the direction you need me.” She said waving her hands out to the sides as if waiting for the said glue stick and glitter to be placed in her palms.
“Yes. I believe so.” Cas smiled, taking the mug in two hands, inhaling the hearty bean scent deeply before taking a timid sip of the hot coffee. Dean watched him,
“No” he muttered as a concerning chill trailed up his spine.
The walk was quick, all four of them taking the stairs two steps at a time. Their eyes peeled for any sign of movement, ears on check for any unusual sounds. But so far, everything seemed quiet. The top floor of the hotel was solitary with an uneasy quiet draping over the place. The room Sam led them to was unlike anything Dean had ever seen. To say the place was elegant would be a massive understatement. Glass cases filled the long narrow space of the room, where dusty trinkets and knickknacks were held on display. Dark mahogany panelled walls curved into a point to form the ceiling making the space feel more like a cathedral than anything else. A heavy-looking glass lantern hung from the centre of the room, casting a dull glow about the place. While the term library had probably been a stretch, the one wall of the room did house bookshelves, specific slots built into the wood panelling displaying a wide collection of old worn leather-bound books and scriptures. But what really took Dean’s breath away were the large floor to ceiling stain glass windows, three of them to be exact sat opposite the wall of books casting an array of shapes and beautiful moonlit colours across the room.
“Cas.” Dean sighed seemingly relieved “Are you alright? You’re not hurt or anything.”
“Hey” Sam protested as he pulled on his white button-down. “Why does she get a thank you and all I got was a middle finger?”
“Please, just one minute”
“On a hunt”
Screwing his eyes shut and wiggling further into the comforter he tried desperately to drown out that voice.  He started humming Led Zeppelin’ Ramble On as loud as he could to drown it out.
“No way. You’re in charge of ours.”
“Yes.” His reply was instant. And Dean felt like the entire world had been lifted off his shoulders.
He let out a deep sigh, eyes lifting from the floor to consider him, “I told him you’d get mad,” he replied quietly after a beat. “He’s been texting me constantly since we arrived.” Cas met his gaze sheepishly “I wasn’t sure if it was against the not seeing each other rule.”
Dean sighed rolling his eyes “Oh, and you wait till now to tell me?” his whispered tone coming out sharp and snappy.
“Will you just… Sit. Please.” He shifted on the bed again, wanting to make more room for them both to sit.
“You weren’t supposed to know.”
He was never expecting to see those eyes again. Not that he had made peace with that fact of course, but he knew, once the Empty came for him there was no coming back. Not that Dean wouldn’t have tried, however, but it seemed like he wouldn’t even need to.
“Say… you haven’t by chance spoken to Dean, have you?”
“Nervous?”
“I don’t even know you.” Dean quipped in return, his feet finally working, stepping backwards and trying to keep some distance between them.
“I know the feelin’,” Dean huffed, shifting back onto his bed feeling a little more at ease, “it's ok to be scared you know. This, right here… you and me. I have faith.”
Castiel’s heart plummeted. He can’t have heard his conversation with Dean surely, that was impossible. Unless humans really did possess those ridiculous superpowers Jack’s comics flaunted. Unable to even look the brother in the eye his gaze found the floor, trying to think of anything to throw Sam off the trail. “No-No I haven’t”
Sam slammed his phone on the table, running two hands over his face and brushing his long hair back. “Yesterday he… He said he was leaving. I-I went by his room this morning and he was gone. I’ve been calling him but it’s just going to voicemail and-”
“Thanks, Jack,” he smiled at the kid. He swiftly turned his attention to Cas, just catching the look that burned across his face, a look that he had seen many a time after his grace had been removed. Longing. He knew that his fiancé could no longer do such angelic tasks like healing him, and even though he would never admit it, it hurt him to watch Jack do what he couldn’t. The small, forced smile that replaced his look of disappointment didn’t convince Dean any other way, he simply reached out for his hand, squeezing it, hopefully conveying a look that read,
“You can tear me a new one later,” his brother grumbled “but right now we gotta keep moving. Go. Back to the hotel.”
The view from Dean’s window was, in a word that he would never use, picturesque. From his vantage point, he had a full view of the stunning rose garden, winding and swirling in perfectly manicured borders that directed a cobbled pathway up to a hexagonal wooden gazebo. The place where, tomorrow, he would be married. Beyond that was the treeline of dense pine and conifers trees, perfectly segregating the property line of the manor house and the edge of the forest beyond. When Dean had driven them here, he was almost certain Sam was sending him on a wild goose chase, how can anything possibly be in the middle of this thick forest. But his ideas were soon squashed when they turned into the long stretch of driveway leading up to the front of the hotel. The sight of the old building slowly coming into view under a canopy of curving vegetation was overly dramatic, but even he had to admit, Sammy had done a great job finding this place. The look of admiration and wonder on Cas’s face alone when they stepped out of the Impala was enough to know that this was perfect. However, if he knew what was in store for the rest of the evening, he would have got back into the car and driven home.
“Who’s Lady Catrina?”
“Hey, this is on Dean, not me,” Sam said raising his hands in defence. “
shoulder, “Ready?”
“Yeah. I’ve looked everywhere. I didn’t want to say in front of Cas, but I went to his room. He and all his stuff was gone. I’m worried”
were fine. And with that, and no further word was said on the matter. And the three of them slipped comfortably into what would now be considered their normal lives.
I mean-”
Sam huffed, letting his hands fall to his sides. Ok, so maybe he was going a little overboard with the whole planning, and maybe the stress of everything was starting to get to him a little. But he wanted this day to run as smoothly as possible. If that meant he had to run around like a headless chicken for a few weeks beforehand, then so be it. “I just want everything perfect.”
“Can I come see you?” Castiel asked, cutting Dean off mid-sentence.
“Maybe when we're done,
Sam moved towards him. “Awesome. How’s the Gazebo lookin’?”
“What is she tethered to,” Jack muttered, finishing his sentence
“Why? You don’t think he’s got those cold feet do you? I’ve seen that a lot on TV.”
Dean and Castiel’s attention shot towards Jack. He was standing in front of a large display that was set up to look like an antique wardrobe. Rectangular in length and as wide as it was tall, 3 wooden sides and 2 glass fronted doors with a golden keyhole keeping them shut. Inside were 3 different mannequins, all sporting a different type of outfit from seemingly the same period. One wore a very ostentatious looking maroon coloured smoking jacket, another looked like it was geared up as a maid, and the third wore a strikingly similar white dress that Dean recognised in an instant. And on top of that mannequins head, a large black sun hat. “Yep, that’s the one,” Dean muttered gazing up at the mannequin.
“Then enlighten me,”
Castiel’s face dropped in an instant. His eyes shifting from the younger brother away to the floor. His shoulders sagging as he leant against the dresser. “No-No I haven’t”
century and from the outset, it seemed like that kind of place that would be rife with the unexplained or paranormal. However, Sam had done extensive research on the place. There were a few stories that also came as no surprise, but nothing that should raise alarm. The previous owner and his dog are said to wander the halls and grounds at Christmas, spirits of children seen playing on the grand entranceway staircase and the repeated story of a ‘Grey Lady’ had been seen wandering the guest rooms, but he could happily debunk them all as just stories. Most likely told by the owners to gather more custom.
“What does it say about her?”
Castiel did just that, lifting the phone to his ear, “Hello Jack”
She was tall, her height exaggerated by the long flowing gown she wore and would probably once have been considered beautiful. But the scornful sneer she possessed coupled with the smeared stains of makeup made her look almost wicked. Her hair once neatly pinned to the side with spiralling curls now looked wrecked, misshapen, much like Sam’s does after a long heavy night’s sleep. She glided closer, feet seemingly not even making contact with the carpet, but Dean didn’t move, not even a flinch. His scowl permeating through the near translucent spectre.
Brushing passed again Jack walked into the main room, reaching for Cas’s bag “Sam said we should hang this with the suits. That way when we shower in the morning, the steam will take any creases out.” He said as he continued to dig through Cas’s belongings, not that he minded, of course, considering he just helped himself to the boys' laptop without permission. But when he pulled out the blue silk tie he stepped in, taking it from his pseudo son’s hands. It had been a long while since he had worn this thing. Hunting in a suit became cumbersome when you couldn’t instantly clean or fix it with an instant touch of grace. It also made him very hot too, working out in so many layers, he could see why the Winchesters kept to undershirts and flannel.
Sam beamed as Jody Mills strode towards him, her wide smile greeting them, matching Sam’s in verbatim. “What are you doing here?” He asked pulling away from his fiancée, stepping around her to pull Jody into a hug, rocking her side to side. “You’re not supposed to be here until tomorrow.”
“’bout freakin’ time” Sam countered with a soft murmur. That cocky shit-eating grin spreading wider, eyebrows raised with the same amount of speed as his mug rose to his lips.
“You know it was just an excuse to see you in next to nothing right?”
Cas sighed deeply. “There’s something you’re not telling me.”
Castiel let out a small huff of a laugh, “No. In fact, I’m quite excited.”
“That without my grace I’m practically useless to you all-”
He was incredibly proud to learn of this building’s existence, practically running to gather the troops in the bunker’s library after his initial discovery. Setting his laptop on one of the long wooden tables and skimming through picture after picture to show off his latest wedding plans.
“Dean!”
“No, but I came to give you one of these.” Raising her hand Jody swatted him hard across the shoulder. “That’s for keeping us out the loop last night.” She said pointing an accusing finger in his face and walking further into the room, Dean rubbing his now sore shoulder and following her with a displeased look. Jack shuffled past with an apologetic shrug and handed him the box with the final flower inside. His eyes scanning up and down him and he let out a low whistle. “Lookin’ sharp kid. You scrub up well,” he said, letting the door close and following them into the room.
walk through the lobby, not wanting to direct any unwanted attention. Sam was still on a vigilant lookout for another attack, but seemingly all he encountered was an elderly couple walking out of the saloon with a perplexed look. Sam greeted them warmly with a nod following the trio up the stairs and to the right, heading towards Dean’s room.
That grating detached voice chided.
(See the end of the chapter for
There came a loud slam somewhere in the near vicinity, grabbing Cas’s wrist Dean pulled him into cover behind the Impala just as two sets of footsteps crunched across the gravel path. Tentatively peaking through the windows of the car he saw Sam stood to attention at the top of the parking lot, with Jack’s shadow in tow. “Crap” Dean muttered under his breath.
The sadness melted from Castiel’s eyes, replaced with a small wobbly smile. “You are nothing like him, Dean.” His free hand coming up to cup at his jaw, fingers warm against his cheek as Dean lent into the touch. “And I love you. More than anything in this world.”
“I’ll see you in a sec.”
More silence, Dean taking a moment to collect himself, basking in it. “Dean I…” Cas started, but he sighed deeply, “everything feels different.”
“The room is very nice,” Cas muttered as they followed the others towards the staircase at the furthest end of the hall.
Dean taking that as a cue, his hands shifted from there resting places and brought them to capture his cheeks, tilting his head to make him look him in the eye. Bright blues filled with happy tears, not the first time he’d seen him like this, but this time Dean was determined to get it right. “I freakin’ love you to Cas.” A half-laugh sob broke from Cas as he beamed even brighter, leaning in again for another deep kiss.
Familiar voices drifted up the staircase which made Dean freeze. Their conversation was too far away to make out, but their voices and soft footfalls drifted down the acoustic halls like he was in an echo chamber. He’d recognise his brother and the kids' voices anywhere. Peaking over the ornate bannister he watched his sasquatch baby brother and the Nephilim exchange what looked like beige body bags.
“To the left” Jack called as he took off running,
“Okay,” he choked out, that damn sob finally breaking free.
The sound split through the silence like a whip crack, birds scattering from the nearby trees where they had come to roost for the evening. Sam's head darted up, akin to a gazelle expecting a lion-shaped ambush, his eyes scanning the tree line expecting to see the perpetrator at any moment.
“Probably just nerves,” Jody commented. Moving towards the bed to pluck the flower out of the box “Speaking of, how are yours holding up?”
“Shut Up,” Dean mumbled, hiding his own pleased grin behind the lip of his mug.
“A hat?” Sam repeated.
Dean let out a deep sigh, he loved it when they got things right first-time round, “Everyone ok?” Pleased when there were resounding mumbles of agreeance from the other three men.
But he was tired of running. Running from monsters, his past, himself. It’s just cold feet right, that’s totally normal. Ironic to think that standing in a room full of his closest friends and family telling them all how he felt about the man standing across from him, was more terrifying to him than any hunt, monster or apocalypse he had ever encountered.
“Need help with that bowtie?” Sam asked, lifting his hands to help, but Dean batted them away with a huff.
It wasn’t that Castiel wasn’t enjoying the comic books Jack provided him. He very much liked the art style, but it was the stories that he couldn’t seem to get into. The plot seemed to be a little on the nose for his liking and the characters were completely unbelievable. He was not sure how someone could claim to be a Spider-man when their ‘spider’ abilities were synthesized and were nothing more than a high school student. And the one that turned big and green was just a preposterous notion, Castiel had seen first-hand when people ’got angry’ but no one ever doubled in size nor turned green. And why was everyone so obsessed with the purple man and his golden oven mitt when he clearly had an ideal notion? The world is incredibly overpopulated as it is, seems like a logical step to take really. However, he had to commend the writer for their portrayal of Thor and Loki. Very realistic to their real-life counterparts.
Dean chuckled. “Well… maybe later, I can make you a PB & J sandwich.” Cas’s eyes lit up like a Christmas tree and damnit if it wasn’t the most adorable thing Dean had ever witnessed.
“Thank you,” she smiled, offering her wrist to Jody as she attached the corsage from the box she was carrying.
Sam vaguely remembers reading about the mausoleum, it did belong to the main house once upon a time, but most of the surrounding land around the hotel was sold to help pay for the hotel renovations. There was no way that crypt still existed in the forest. “Why didn’t he tell me?”  Sam heard himself ask, a small pang of something close to hurt blooming in his chest.
“Is the car still here?”
He stared at his closed bedroom door, hoping the wooden grain would give him the answers he needed, but he already knew what he had to do. The guy had saved the world from countless apocalypses, slayed vampires, exterminated demons, hunted ghosts. And yet this, right now, was the most terrifying thing he had ever encountered.
“It’s ok if you have.” Sam retorted; his voice soft, gentle, “I-I just need to know.”
“Of course,” Cas breathed, could almost hear the small smile in his voice.
Castiel sighed deeply as another faint rustle of fabric caught his attention and the distinct click of a bedside lamp flicking on. There it was again, the words on the tip of Dean’s tongue, dying out as soon as he opened his mouth to speak.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean scrubbed a hand down his face. “Dammit, so we have an Einstein monster on our hands and you can’t get it up. Just great. I’ll text Sam.” He flipped out his phone, the signal was horrible, he needed to go find Sam. Dean turned to Castiel, “Stay here, I’ll be back. If something happens, just- something better not happen. Hold my duffel.”
than ever before.”
“With consent.” Dean adds.
Or at least a little sleep deprived. When she had come home and bolted straight upstairs, he had been a bit confused. His baby was obviously going through something- Andrew's duty as a father was needed. So he waited. Liv had a test and she was very particular about who enters her room, he was being respectful. He also needed a fresh fade and lineup, so really it benefitted both of them. He was just coming off a client call when she came barreling downstairs. Liv plopped on the old leather chair next to him and huffed. She buried her face into her sweatshirt. Wait.
Ivy frowned, “I thought those were, like, sex-gone-wrong type of things. Or, like, drugs.”
“Sure why not.” It couldn’t hurt.

the aristocrats, no matter what Nicole likes to say about others.”
An older woman- about fifty, with dark brown skin and long curly hair- smiled. Her crows feet crinkled and she patted a tall East Asian man next to her. “We’re regulars here, Takashi and I, it’s a nice retreat from the real world. I’m Nicole.” She pointed to an even taller man with golden rod hair underneath a grey flat cap. He lifted a steaming porcelain mug from his lap in greeting. “That’s Mikhail and his
Heather shot Sam a scolding look, prompting him to duck his head and Dean to bite his cheek to keep from laughing, and plastered her smile back on. An unsettling customer service smile that hid everything about the person it was on. "Hello, sir. He wasn't giving you any trouble, was he? Samuel here is a new hire."
Nicole pointed to another couple, two women- one with dark, olive skin and a long braid, the other with pale skin and striking curly, red hair. "That's Ximena and Ivy." Nicole raised a slender hand to the side of her mouth, mock whispering to Dean. "They're
It took Dean a moment, blinking away his confusion momentarily. “Did you just…
“Thank you, Captain Obvious.”
“And get yourself killed? What about me?”
“How much of your mojo have you lost?” This was proving to be one of the worst hunts he’s been on. God shits in his dinner once again.
“Yeah, I noticed a devil’s trap shaped chandelier earlier, which is pretty smart.”

They were in the car- Zeppelin playing softly and Castiel in the backseat- when Sam unfurled the newspaper some more. “Okay, get this, all of the victims supposedly had secrets-” Dean quirked an eyebrow at that information. How’d this random newspaper know? Wasn’t that classified or something between the therapist and patient? “- well, according to the other guests. Some long term ones, short term ones, none of them there for all of the murders.
"Get outta here before I give the hunt to someone else." Bobby huffed, sitting in a chair. He waved a hand towards the door. "Go on."
“Am I what?”
“You know what? I’m gonna speak to the manager.”
people had dreams that they remembered for weeks after, and it happened every night.” He picked up the paper, eyes scanning for a specific quote. “Listen, quote: ‘‘Colby always talked about his dreams being super realistic,’ says Whitney- primary investor of the Halcyon Couples’ Resort- ‘He said they always told him to be free with himself, and then boom! He’s dead. I always thought he was just on drugs or something, maybe I should’ve reached out.’’ We’ll get the whole story if we’re
“I hold no traditional military rank.”
Sam scrunched his face, “Ew dude, no,
Castiel froze. A myriad of emotions flickered across his face, he squinted in confusion. “Dreams are strange.” What? “If only you would actually tell me this.” The green light dimmed, plunging everything into moss-colored darkness.
Sam pointed to the fineprint describing the resort- ignoring the confused ‘why does the rainbow matter’ from Cas, “Look, it says discrete
“Oh hush dear, you’re going to scare away the new guest.” Takashi patted his wife on the thigh, not even looking up from the paper.
The angel accepted the bag, nodding at the instructions. Dean caught sight of Sam from across the room- newly clad in a white polo and khakis- and jogged over. They nodded their greetings before Dean cut right to the chase, “Listen, there’s wards all over this place.”
“That should be fine, I don’t require-” Castiel yawned, stunning the two of them into silence. He looked at Dean, shell shocked and confused.
“I support having a little summer fling, you know what I mean?” Andrew grinned as his daughter’s cheeks grew darker.
it’s Massachusetts. They’re, like, third in gay friendly states.”
“Did it seem like…?”
“Sorry. But he says- in this real croaky, deep voice- ‘I am an angel of the Lord. Sorry for showing you my true form’ or whatever.”
“It must be the sigils, they must’ve turned me more human than I thought. I’d have to study them some more.” Castiel yawned again, mouth opening wide and body stretching all over. His usual wrinkled, white dress shirt lifted with the movement and showed Cas’ skin just above his waistband. And, huh, is that real wood on the roof? And also wow, has his duffel always been this stained?
Dean eyed the woman, she was extremely passionate about the work being done here. Heather would know everything about this resort, all he had to do was ask. “I’m a bit of a mythology buff and I noticed some really intricate carvings on one of the elevators. What kind of creature is that?"
He slides in across from his daughter and peeks at the laminated menu taped to the peeling table. A whole page is dedicated to the burgers at this place. There are five versions of the black and bleu, swiss and mushrooms, a vegetarian one called “The Sammy”, and tons of other ones. Similarly, there’s a half-page filled with pie options on the backside. All of them have different nicknames and ingredients. The joint seems like a real Mom and Pop kind of place. But he shouldn’t be paying attention to the menu, he needs to figure out what’s up with his daughter.
Captain Obvious.”
Dad would probably deny it to Hell and back but what was Dean supposed to think? Seventeen years old and Dad sends him on a gay nun salt and burn- right after Dean went on his first hunt with Lee. There was no way Dad could’ve known that they had fooled around in Lee’s broken down ‘98 Jeep Cherokee. High off of cosmic brownie edibles and cheap beer that tasted like dirt but did the job. Lee was the only one outside of Cassie and Castiel that Dean could see himself staying with for a long time.
The waiter comes over, a teenaged blonde girl with heavy eyeliner and a weird look on her face, carrying a notepad. She looks between Andrew and his kid and then back to his kid and pulls the pad up to jot down their orders. She looks at him expectantly and Andrew finally catches on. He orders the spicy Hellhound Black and Bleu and Liv gets the shrimp and grits and the girl walks off. It’s quiet at their table for a moment until Liv purses her lips.
