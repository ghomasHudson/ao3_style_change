Cas looked up at him through dark lashes as he reverently kissed his way from one hip to the other, bracing himself above Dean on the mattress.
“Now that the threads that tied me to heaven are being cut, I can’t help but understand, on some level, the rage that Lucifer felt. The loss that would drive him to annihilate everything he once loved.” The chair squeaked as Cas turned his body towards the hunter. He stared into the tea light between them for a moment before bringing his eyes up to meet Dean’s. He looked ethereal, sitting in a broken chair on a rotting porch in South Dakota, with nothing more than a cheap candle lighting his face. Dean almost laughed—maybe he should have taken Sam up on his offer and gotten some sleep tonight. “But I am not my brother,” Cas finished, as Dean tried to refocus.
Sometimes they spoke of Castiel and the three strange humans he loved. But he was always just
“What took so long?” Sam asked, sleepy in his chair—one of those old, padded rocking chairs old people would do their crosswords in.
“My manager.”
“Where’s the angel?” Dean repeated, his voice raw and dangerous.
It was Sammy’s idea, the two-hose system, after Dean threw up the third or fourth time from getting a mouthful of gasoline. They hit up both of the abandoned cars, and though there wasn’t plenty of fuel, they found enough for the time being.
“Cas, I know you’re basically invincible but that doesn’t mean I love it when you stand directly in the line of fire,” he whispered harshly. Adrenaline pushed him forward—he couldn’t stand around talking about tape when there were so many questions that needed answering. Dean didn’t give Cas time to respond before he turned towards the door and kicked it in.
“Yes.” Cas’ moved again, growing more confident. He gripped Dean’s thigh and pushed his fingertips against the faded denim inseam. Dean jumped at the change in pressure, at the intimacy of it, and grabbed Cas’ arm to hold him still. He turned his head a fraction to look at the angel, who sat unmoving with wide, searching eyes. He started to pull away and Dean almost let him retreat. Wanted to.
“If you have homes, what’s with the tent city?” he asked, crossing his arms and wishing their store of weapons wasn’t buried beneath all the shit in the trunk.
“I’m driving, and so is Dean, so everyone grab a ride and make sure we’re all accounted for,” Bobby said as they headed over to the cars. The sky was fading. It took longer than Dean had thought to get their shit together and they’d taken some time to make a quick run to the houses close by to grab a couple of hoodies and t-shirts that weren’t matted with grime.
Dean’s hands twisted in the sheets as he writhed beneath Cas and his damn mouth and strong hands. “Yeah, Cas, fuck.”
He rolled over and focused on trying not to puke, but he knew from experience the liquor still in his system was holding back the worst of the hangover.
“We need to fuel up,” Sam said suddenly. Dean was startled out of his reverie, or as close to a reverie as an anxious, sober hunter could get. He looked at the gas gauge. So that’s what Sam had been looking at—they were running on empty. “Dean, pull over.”
He heard the familiar grating of metal as Cas pushed the door of their trailer open, and a few moments passed as he made his way over to Dean, footsteps getting louder as he approached, which seemed even louder in the still, quiet of the air.
“In the shower, or, when I can… thought of you. I thought of you fucking me, just like this, I never thought—” Dean broke off with a breathy moan as Cas pulled slowly out of him and then back in, before adding a second finger to join the first.
They all climbed back in the car and started their slow drive over the bridge. It wasn’t far, but it was narrow, and whoever had built the barricade had left enough obstructions in the road that Dean couldn’t hit the gas like his gut was telling him to.
The area around them was barren. The trees they were barely using as cover were hardly more than tall, knotted columns rising from the forest floor, but Dean figured there were enough of them that they’d be fine for a while. It was so quiet in the already small town, and he just needed a couple of hours to close his eyes and forget.
Dean couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen anything so aggressively domestic. He shifted to climb out of the car, but Cas stopped him with a light touch on his arm.
“I’m sorry, Sam. I— I underestimated his attachment to the house.”
“Happy to hear from me?” she laughed, crackling, somehow seeing through him despite the uneven signal.
“It is what it is,” is all Dean offered in reply. He took his silver flask out of his pocket and took a drink before offering it to Cas, who took a sip with a slight grimace, like he was just doing it to fit in.
“Guess not,” Bobby said.
Dean watched him go then turned back to Charlie.
“We don’t have the fuel,” Sam pointed out, ever reasonable. Frustratingly reasonable. But his voice cracked, and Dean looked over to him to stop what he knew his brother was going to say next.
“Is it—” Cas managed to say, “Does it always feel like this?” His skin was flushed.
Bobby and Sam moved fast, grabbing Dean under his arms to drag him back into the safety of the bunker. He choked on the pain of it, but let himself be carried.
“Hey.” Not a good start.
When he woke up, Cas was driving and it was still light outside.
Taking in the carnage around him clearly for the first time reminded him of the pulsing throb in his head.
“Yes, I retrieved it all. There wasn’t enough for it to be much of a burden.”
Cas broke the kiss and ran his lips across Dean’s collar bone, sending tight sparks of electricity to the base of his spine. He leaned his head back to bear his throat for the angel.
He did, after a moment.
Dean tried to hold back a smile at Cas’ directness. “You’re saying what we’re all thinking, Cas.”
“Oh fuck,” Dean said, letting his head fall back and hit the wall. His legs were shaking. He tried to come back down to Earth. “Yes, yeah, definitely yeah,” he rushed when he noticed Cas was still waiting for an answer.
?!” Turiel hissed at the other angel. “Our brothers and sisters are dying,” he grabbed the front of her shirt, his thin fingers tearing the threadbare fabric. “Time is different here, you know that. Every moment we spend on Earth, even more time has passed in Heaven.”
“So then what did you want to say to me,” and after a beat, he added, “Buddy?”
, Dean thought. That meant he’d have to drive at a reasonable speed. Conserve more gas. He was really hoping to shave a couple of hours off their time.
“What the hell happened? Are you hurt?” He reached for his brother’s side, where the sticky blood was thickest. Dean slapped his hands away but knew it would be easier to get a hellhound off their trail than it would be to avoid Sam’s questions.
He stood and stretched his back. He was barely thirty-one but he felt like an old man these days. His muscles were always sore, but he wasn’t sure if it was because he wasn’t moving enough or he was moving too much. Looking down at Cas he asked, “Ready?” and the angel stood and followed him down the steps.
“Yeah,” Afriel agreed, but did it with a frown. “Might be nice to help out a little around here, though.”
“You’ve got nothing to apologize for. You’re going through some serious shit. Even more than the rest of us,” Dean kept his eyes on the road but hoped Cas understood he was being sincere. It would all be fine. It would all go back to being the best kind of normal they could scrape together.
“Yes. I’d like that. Shame there’s only one left.”
“Dude. Did you really think we were the only group of good guys left?”
“It might be easier to sleep if you’re a little more casual and a little less business casual.”
“Whoa, whoa, whoa, shouldn’t we draw straws or something here?” Dean asked, stepping between Sam and the door, his hands up with palms facing his brother.
“Alright, bu— Cas.”
Dean could feel the vibrations of Cas’ moan as he dragged his mouth along Dean’s length, his tongue leaving damp patches on the fabric. Dean almost choked when Cas flicked his eyes up to look at Dean through his lashes. This is the hottest fucking thing I’ve ever seen, he thought through the haze.
“Mornin’, Cas,” he said. Dean stopped to stand by the fire and looked at the angel out of the corner of his eye trying to measure his mood, figure out where it was on a scale from one to wrath of Heaven.
Afriel didn’t answer but made how she felt known by sitting down and resolutely not looking out of the window. Instead, she picked up a dusty copy of something called Us Weekly and read quietly.
“Come in, Winchester. Can you take the case?”
“And their uncle Bobby,” Bobby added with a frown.
He stalked over to the Impala and climbed in without a word. Sam followed him, his body language speaking volumes.
“This is how I’ve wanted you,” Cas whispered against his throat. “Dean—” He didn’t finish, choosing instead to test how it would feel to pull Dean’s collar aside and bite gently into the salty curve where his neck met his shoulder.
He wouldn’t let them get cornered again. And he couldn’t let them get pushed out again. They needed to find somewhere safe, and if that meant driving Baby as far as she could get on fumes and walking the rest of the damn way he’d do it.
He moved to the trunk to grab a snack before they had to hit the road and suddenly, Sam was beside him.
“Should you really be doing that?” Sam was worried, they all were.
“I’ve existed for millennia and the concept of ‘a day’ is still relatively new to me,” Cas said carefully. “Yet I can say without a doubt that this is the longest day I’ve ever experienced.”
“Of course we have a ham. What d’you think we are? Amateurs?”
(See the end of the chapter for
The next few days in the bunker were awkward. Spatially, Cas was having difficulty manoeuvring through some of the smaller rooms, and they all felt considerably smaller with the enormous expanse of his wings filling up every space and sucking the air out of Dean’s lungs.
**********
Cas bit down on the skin he’d been lapping at, growling something deep and guttural that Dean couldn’t hear.
He looked at his customary spot on the couch and couldn’t bring himself to relax enough to fall into it. He walked into the tiny kitchenette instead and started opening and closing cupboards, not looking for anything in particular but hoping to find something that would pull him away from the conversation that was about to happen.
“Cas, you picking up anything?” Sam asked.
“You sure about this?” he asked. He would trust the guy, trust him with his life, but this whole thing was a little overwhelming.
Cas squeezed Dean’s knee, “I’ll be right back.”
“In 1958, my fellows were slaughtered in this very room,” Henry said, ignoring Dean’s push for fast answers. “By one of the Knights of Hell, a demon named Abaddon. She was after the same thing you’re after—the key to the bunker.”
“Yeah, well, with any luck this will be the last stop,” Sam said weakly.
flashed through his mind, but that wasn’t right.
, Dean thought,
Here it is—the second part of chapter 11. Known to some as "Chapter 12." This is a big chunk of the plot of this fic, and from here on out it's going to be wild. We've got the key to the bunker, we've got Abaddon, we've got *Dean feelings*.
He shrugged. He was too tired to care about the placid reception to his shitty joke.
“Sammy,” Dean pulled himself out of the sleep that was threatening to drag him under. “Sam,” he grabbed at his brother, “I need him back, okay?” He tried to wipe the wetness away from his face but he couldn’t lift his free arm up far enough. “I need him.”
Cas patted his front pockets, his movements slow and exaggerated. “Yes.” He pulled the flashlight from his jacket and held it up like it was the Olympic torch. “I do.”
When he got himself together, he slid on his boots and went to go find Bobby and Cas, hoping neither of them had cursed themselves into oblivion.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean,” he said quietly, gently holding the side of Dean’s face. Dean leaned into the touch, and he wanted to let his eyes slip closed again—to stay that way forever.
He pulled him close again, pushing against him and desperate for friction.
The hunters were basking in the, not normalcy of it, but the strange comfort. Cas was standing close by, as if on guard, attempting to lock eyes with the people in the room he considered a threat but who weren't paying him a bit of attention.
“I shouldn’t want you like this,” Dean whispered.
He groaned, the early-morning sound of someone who hadn’t gotten enough rest.
Dean took a steadying breath and turned his head, letting his mouth rest against Cas’ so gently it could barely be called a touch. But it shot something electric down his spine and that small, quiet brush stopped being enough the moment it started.
“You need to go see Rowena?” he asked the incredibly non-human and absolutely made-for-him angel that was breathing heavily against his salt-sticky skin.
“Holy
They got into the small sedan—Cas in the backseat, and Sammy in the front. Dean left tire marks on the asphalt as he drove too quickly out of the parking lot, eager to leave behind the charred corpses of the small family and the fire that continued to spread.
, Dean. You’re always going on about how Cas is your best friend, how you need him—”
“Could have been a demon,” Dean offered, not helping.
Cas curled into him, still hot and smelling of the coffee he’d spent the last week making. Dean closed his eyes and let himself breathe in.
As he struggled to sit up, his brother was already there, wrapping an arm behind Dean’s back and helping him sit up.
“Hey, don’t,” he said quietly, “Save your juice for when you need it.” He released Cas, and the angel moved back to sit back on the edge of his own bed. He dropped his head, and when he looked back up, Cas’ eyes were shining in the dim light cast by the lantern.
“Not, uh,” Dean interrupted, rasping. “Not necessarily. Cas, show ‘em the… thing.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He’d been playing it cool all day, managing to push what Cas had said to him that morning out of his head. But standing huddled together with the guy was putting him on edge.
“Oh my God,” Sam said, words falling from his mouth like he couldn’t control them. He lowered his face to breathe in the smell of spiced beef, warm bread, and cheese. Bobby made a sound like a sob and covered his face with his hand. Dean was frozen in place and just stared at the meal in front of him.
They took a few more detours on the way, Cas leading them down two-lane highways and backroads that avoided the bigger cities. They passed into Illinois and headed south to Normal without hitting any trouble.
But still.
But now he was lying there, uncomfortable, tired, and longing for the safe space of his own mattress.
“Not yet,” Sam sighed and rested his face in the palms of hands.
“Yeah,” Bobby said, adjusting his grip on the shotgun. “I’m gonna.”
Why was Cas making this so friggin’ complicated? He’d fucked up. He got it. Sam wasn’t letting him forget it. But if the guy would just answer him they could move on. He knew Cas was stubborn, but this was taking it too far. They were friends—hell, they were more than friends, they were brothers.
Cas cringed at the word,
Dean looked over at Sam and Bobby and they looked back at him silently—unwilling to get in the middle of an angelic dick-measuring contest, but willing to stand up for Cas if it seemed like he needed it.
“Fuck you,” Dean spat, and stood in front of Cas without thinking. Cas grabbed his elbow and moved him to the side, a little more harshly than he normally would.
“If you’re coming with us, get in,” he said. “We’re going back to Bobby’s.”
“Nah, Sammy. You had precious cargo to protect. We have any water left?” Dean asked, thinking of the rye within reach.
behind.” He looked quizzically up at Cas. “Any idea, feathers?”
across his chest for everyone to see.
Dean made an impressed sound and pulled the curtain closed behind him so he could strip down and enjoy the coldest and absolutely most luxurious shower he’d had in weeks. It brought him to life a little bit, and it definitely made him feel a little more human.
“Oh, you didn’t hear?” Dean yelled, letting a smile break out on his face. “We’ve got an angel of the Lord on our side. Angel with a capital ‘A’. You know, wings, harp, enough celestial energy to blow you off the map.”
He didn’t remember taking off his jeans, which didn’t mean he didn’t kick them off at some point, but he also couldn’t help but wonder if Cas had pulled them off. He really wished he’d been conscious the first time Cas peeled his clothes off, but there was always next time.
He had the front of Cas’ jacket dripped tightly in one fist, like a sick pantomime of how they’d stood the night before. Dean's face twisted as he dragged Cas to the edge of Sam’s bed and pointed at his brother.
“I don’t think so, Sam. I’m good.”
There was no avoiding it—they’d all have to carry on with the work they started yesterday. The thought of it made Dean’s head hurt. He just hoped that they could all keep it together today. No fighting. No bickering. Just keep their focus on finding the damn tablet so they could give it to Afriel and Turiel and end this shit once and for all.
As they approached the park, Cas slowed the car. Bobby pulled up beside them and Dean undid his window. “What’ya think?” Bobby called.
Bobby approached the door. “No better time than the present,” he said, and turned the brass knob to test the lock. With a click, it opened, and as the four men walked into the once-empty building, it came to life in front of them.
“So, what do we need?” Dean asked, finally giving in and taking a seat.
Dean stood back and kept his eyes locked on Cas, his jaw clenched. Cas finally broke his eyes away, and turned to look at Sam, pulling down the blood-stained blanket down to his waist. He laid a hand on the dying Winchester’s chest, and suddenly the room was aglow with white light.
“Not really,” he said, grimacing around the burn.
Dean grinned, pulling him forward by his new, unbuttoned flannel and kissed him.
Thank you to my glorious Beta Tardimaid, who has been so good to me. And my Alpha Stu, because without him I'd never have gotten through this.
“We’ve intruded,” Cas said beside him, “We shouldn’t have come.” He put his hand on Dean’s arm, a sign for them to leave.
When he looked over and saw Cas opening the passenger’s side door instead of Sam, he almost protested. But when Cas turned to him with his eyebrows raised and a small quirk pulling on one side of his mouth, Dean grinned back at him.
He listened to Cas, who explained more about the spell, what went wrong, and what would happen if Dean didn’t leave. And he listened to Dean, who told him that there was a survivor from Rufus’ group, and people knew where they were, and they couldn’t put themselves through that again.
He walked slowly to the library with Sam trailing behind him—like he was waiting to catch Dean if he collapsed. Bobby was already there, sitting at his typical spot with a book open in front of him.
Dean tipped the mug back, not caring that the cooling foam was making a home in the stubble over his upper lip. He looked at Cas, who was standing at the counter explaining to a customer that her husband’s infidelity wasn’t his fault but was probably the root of her displeasure with the dairy-free beverage she’d ordered, and every wire in his body, every twist that Dean tried so impossibly to undo, bundled into a knot under his ribs.
Without another word, they climbed out of the Impala. Dean took a second to crack his back before joining the group where they stood in the road between the two cars.
“Oh my god.” Dean bit into his forearm to stop himself from crying out completely. Was his room soundproof? He fucking hoped so. He’d never hear the end of it if it wasn’t.
He clenched his jaw, pissed at Sam for being right.
“So glad you finally made it,” Abaddon said, crossing her arms over her chest.
He swore under his breath, but he was too hungover to actually say anything out loud. He started kicking the back of his boot against the base of the bed frame in an attempt to loosen it. He got it half-way off then pried it the rest of the way off with his socked-foot. He wasn’t even able to enjoy the feeling of freedom before he peeled his sore, dry tongue off the roof of his mouth.
Or if it was, it was fucking premium.
He felt the deep thrum in his stomach twist and his thighs tensed and shook. “I’m close, Cas, fuck, I’m gonna—” Dean’s breathing was shattered, his throat raw. Cas didn’t move away, and his lips fell open as Dean pulled his head back by the hair so he could watch as he covered Cas’ mouth and chin with come.
Sam looked at Dean in horror. “That might not be too far in our future if we don’t ration properly.” As he moved to grab the bag back, Dean quickly moved it out of his reach.
None of them moved. They could all see the pistol in her belt. When she realized what they were looking at, she moved one hand down slowly to unbuckle the holster and toss the weapon towards them.
Cas let his hand drop and quirked his head to the side. “I’ve never been to a party,” he said.
Dean almost dropped him.
He shoved over, away from Cas and closer to Charlie, wiping the last few minutes from his memory. “Tell me about all of this. Your group.”
“I know Dean. We had this conversation last night.” She scrunched up her face and patted his knee, looking at him like he was a lost puppy.
After a few hours, their lungs filled with dust, they’d both had enough. The cement box of a room was cold enough that it settled into Dean’s joints. And Cas was still annoyed with Bobby, so he’d been extra snappy with Dean for the rest of the afternoon, barking orders at him and slapping his hands away from things he’d cleared but considered “irrelevant to their search.”
Cas let out a small laugh, his breath a puff of vapour in the cold air.
“Dean, you chose freedom. You refused to be ruled by fate, and I believe that’s something worth fighting for. Even now.”
“As Sam said, my family is ‘busy upstairs’, and I doubt they are capable, or willing, to detract from the power of the host in their battle with Lucifer’s army.”
“Whatever you’ve got in those beauties of yours,” she said, pointing to the cars. “We’ve got supplies, but we can’t exactly go to the mall these days. Plus, I dunno, you seem alright.”
On the way to the Impala, Dean tossed his keys to Cas.
“No,” Sam said, rubbing his eyes. “I think it’s in one of the storerooms we found. Cas said some of them had even more protective spells on them than the rest of this place.”
“Yes,” Cas answered. “I have to work tomorrow.”
Dean dropped his mug to the bench beside him and dumped a little of the amber liquid from his flask into it. He winced as he took a sip. What Cas had made him was warm and acidic and smooth. He’d ruined it—turned it lukewarm and bitter.
“A little help, Cas?” He stepped back as the angel approached the door. With a single push, the wood fell back and collapsed on the floor with a crash.
Ever since they’d found the slab, the angel had been on edge, and Dean had caught him more than once running his fingers over the foreign engravings, like he was trying to find an answer in God’s Word. But it didn’t matter how intensely he stared at it; it was just as indecipherable to him as it was to the three humans.
Dean tried to control his breathing—his eyes closed tightly in an attempt to dull at least one of his senses. The rest of him was alight, and although it was almost impossible to form a single coherent thought, what Cas said dragged him back down to Earth.
Through desperate, convincing tears, she promised the hunters she’d give up witchcraft, magic, all of it. Dean paced as he listened to her. She was young, new to the occult, and didn’t seem totally corrupted by her powers. He figured she needed a timeout and probably a therapist—which was saying a whole hell of a lot coming from him.
be good?” Dean asked, looking at his brother. He knew he didn’t have to say more, Sam knew what he meant.
“Hey, if I swung both ways, I’d add both of you to my harem.”
“I dunno if he’s gonna feel like talkin’,” Dean answered quietly. “You sure you don’t need me? Want something to eat?”
He stalked across the room and pushed into Cas’ space, throwing the useless flat-screen TV off balance as he grabbed Cas and captured his mouth in a kiss. Cas made a deep noise in the back of his throat and leaned into it, opening his mouth to let Dean in while his hands found their way beneath layers of clothes to dig fingers into the dip of Dean's back.
“Bobby, you’ve got—” Dean pointed to his own forehead, and Bobby wiped again, trying to get the dirt off.
Dean winced. He was searching his mind for the right words to fix this, to make Cas understand where he was coming from, how it wasn’t about
Cas looked at Dean questioningly, but followed him inside. Dean closed and locked the door, and watched Cas walk over to the chest of drawers to perch on the edge of it the way he’d sat on the edge of Bobby’s desk a hundred times what felt like a hundred years ago. He looked drawn, like he was catching his breath, and that was it for Dean.
Cas’ eyes opened a fraction in surprise.
“Sounds great,” he said, about to close the door in Sam’s face but his brother blocked it with his foot.
Dean ignored Cas and his looks and his concern, instead turning to address Bobby. “We give her a hunter’s funeral,” Dean confirmed. “This house is more of a hunter than any of us. We don’t leave her here to get moved in on.”
Something flashed across Cas’ face, and he looked over his shoulder at the wings like they’d betrayed him.
Sam had been standing awkwardly near the table, practically hovering as he stared at his brother, but when Dean stood he pulled out a chair to sit.
**********
Cas pulled his fingers free and dropped back between Dean’s thighs, lower than before. He pulled Dean’s hips forward and used his thumbs to spread him open, pushing his mouth against the tight swirl of muscle and opening him up with his lapping tongue.
“Yes, Dean?” He still sounded pissed.
“Alright. If Bobby’s in, we’re all in.”
Cas leaned back into the touch, the rigid lines of his expression relaxing, just a little.
“I like it when you make that sound,” he said, dropping his face back into the curve of Dean’s neck and biting down.
As Dean finally pulled off the highway and into the small, red-bricked town, he felt something like a shovel against his throat. He didn’t know what they were hoping to find here, but he had some idea that it wouldn’t be any good. How could it be.
“Alright,” Cas said simply. He obviously wasn’t buying it.
A small laugh escaped Dean’s lips. “You alright there, buddy?”
, he wrote. He glanced quickly around him. His back was to a wall, but even that one word, that one small plea that felt more like an admission than a request, made Dean feel like every eye in the place was aimed directly at his screen.
When Dean rubbed his hands over his face and through his hair, his scalp was tender. He dug his fingers into the sensitive skin there just for a second, even as his gut churned around the Folgers.
“Cas, fuck, I need—” Dean’s words were lost to a quiet moan as he ran his hands through messy hair.
Dean felt like he could spit sparks, and as Cas continued exploring with his lips and tongue, a throb of blood pooled low in his stomach. He fell back against the pillow and dug his fingers deeper into dark hair and forcibly held himself back from pushing the angel lower.
Dean’s knees were finally about to give out, so he walked over to the couch and let himself sit, hands still in his pockets. He stared at the puddle of sludge in the corner of the room, the one that no matter how often they’d tried to sop up, persisted and continued to rot through the carpet.
“So, what d’you boys think?” Bobby asked, already reaching into his car to pull out Sam’s map.
Leaving Cas standing by the cars, the three hunters set off to see what they could scavenge.
“You know, for some reason, the GPS ain’t working. Check the map.”
So they went back in and Dean sat on that uncomfortable bench he couldn’t get used to. He was cold and wet but he felt like maybe he was allowed to stare and smile at the angel serving coffee behind the counter and that was enough.
Bobby shook his head. “Can’t be easy, all I’m saying.”
When Dorothy and Shaggy-Man were about to meet Polychrome, the strange group finally exited the house. They’d taken long enough that it was already starting to get dark—which wasn’t good. She sighed and shoved the book in her pack without marking her spot as they made their way back to the cars, distracted enough they still hadn’t seen her in the low light.
for doing what you needed to do.” Dean searched his face, looking for any sort of sign he believed him. He let go of his wrists and leaned against the car instead, crossing his arms over his mist-damp jacket. He fucking hated angels.
Sam kicked the flimsy door of the abandoned factory open and Dean pushed past him. It was a cavernous, dead space. Lumbering, broken machines lined the walls and forgotten tools were scattered on the filthy cement floor. It was cold, even colder than it was outside. If it was sunny, light would be pouring in from the broken windows—but the sky was dark, and inside was only dimly lit by the industrial lights hanging from the ceiling.
It took Cas a second to figure out what was happening, which is why Dean mentally explained away the small smile and hand that ghosted over his hip.
“Cut it, kid,” Bobby said, taking a long, slow drink from his mug.
As the three hunters watched him climb the stairs, Sam’s eyes darted to Dean. “Is he gonna be okay?”
“When Lucifer brought his army into heaven,” Cas said, not letting himself get deterred by Dean’s feigned indifference, “I wasn’t there when my brothers and sisters were being slaughtered. Without my Father, no one had the power to keep him out. Not Michael, not any of the archangels. And I was being held in chains powerless to protect my family.”
“Why don’t you, uh—?” he asked, gesturing to his own face.
Dean picked up a dirt-crusted bottle of whiskey that was sitting beside his chair, chasing his breakfast with a light lunch.
“Did you find anything?” Sam asked, his eyes bloodshot from where he was still going line-by-line through the ledger.
He grabbed whatever t-shirt was within reach, hoping it wasn’t the one he’d been wearing because it was one of his favourites, and wiped them both down.
He looked over at the three other men, all grim reflections of each other as they surveyed the damage in front of them.
“Alright, so we have a couple of options,” Dean said to the group.
Cas stopped at the edge of the driveway. “I need your blood,” he said, grabbing Dean’s hand. “May I?” he asked as he pulled a knife from his pocket.
“I’m sorry, Dean. I shouldn’t.”
“How’re
Dean squinted at Bobby through the flames, but the old hunter wasn’t looking back.
“You’re right. I’ll grab ‘em.”
“Let’s go, Chewbacca,” he said to his co-pilot as he pressed the gas pedal and steered the car towards the exit of the park.
“I guess playtime is over,” Bobby sighed. They all stood with obvious reluctance and followed Henry into the dark.
Instead, held his hand in place, covering it for a moment with his own to keep those fingers pressed against him.
Dean didn’t flinch. “You’re supposed to be dead,” he spat, his mouth pulled into a line as hard as his shoulders.
“We’re here for the key,” Cas continued. “We should find it and go.”
As Dean ran through the inventory of what they had in the trunk, trying to figure out how much it would last them, Sam cleared his throat.
“Pong?” Cas was completely lost.
“Yeah,” Sam said. “A lot more. The Men of Letters couldn’t kill her. Cas told me what he read in their journal, and they took her at face value like she was a regular demon. But if she’s still alive, and one of Lucifer’s most powerful demons, we’ll need something with a lot more firepower. Maybe even more than the Colt.”
“I enjoy it. We call our team the Hustle Fam,” he said with a small smile.
“Make him better,” and nothing in his tone said both men would leave the room alive if Cas didn’t comply.
“Sixteen. Is that really what you wanted to ask?”
“Music, yes I know,” Cas finished for him with a sigh. “But I need to apologize if anything I did crossed a line, or,” he paused, “wasn’t welcome.” Dean could hear how difficult it was for him to get those words out, and he hated himself for making Cas doubt himself like that.
“I wouldn’t,” Abaddon said, sharp and tinny and stopping him in his tracks. “If I die, the angel dies. And his death will be much more,” she searched for the word, “
Another shove, this one knocking the wind out of him. “I hear what you said to me over and over again. But then I look at you, and everything gets confused. I don’t know how to push it away like you do.”
“Are you guys serious right now?” They’d brought their bad mood with them, and Sam was already looking fed up with their bickering.
Bobby reached forward and rapped his knuckles against the wooden frame.
Dean went upstairs to change, finally stripping off the blood-encrusted clothes he’d been wearing for the last two days, and washed up with some of the water they kept upstairs. He looked at himself in the bathroom mirror, mind blank, and left the room to go find Cas.
Dean’s cock twitched at the simplicity of the command and opened his mouth to whorl his tongue around the fingers, moving up onto his elbows to suck them deeper. He loved it—the way Cas talked to him in moments like these, how his voice burned into Dean’s chest and made him want to
“I would very much like to expend some energy with you.”
“This was their nerve centre,” Sammy said beside him, stopping at the metal railing to try and take it all in. Their voices echoed, and even in the dark, Dean could sense how big it was inside.
The way Cas’ shoulders moved as he cut the head off the last stinking ghoul made Dean’s blood quicken.
He resisted the temptation to dig his nose into the black hair that was pressed against his face.
“I’ll give you to the count of three to get the hell off my lot,” Bobby said with venom. Dean focused on Rufus’ hateful smirk, seeing almost nothing else, and imagined driving a fist right down his throat.
Dean focused on the road ahead. It looked the same as all the other interstates they’d been forced to take. The same yellow lines, the same empty cars, the same grey landscape. There wasn’t anything to distract him.
Bobby looked particularly uneasy, but it turned out he could trust Charlie, too—after a short conversation with Cas.
Sam grabbed his arm as he walked past him and Dean jerked away, pulling his arm out of his brother’s grasp.
“Do that again,” he said.
Dean turned away when Cas’ face dropped.
No one cared about cash except for those who couldn’t shake the habit. People needed to feed their families, so those in power put them to work and paid them in food. There were raids on those with stockpiles, under the precedent of taking from the rich to give to the poor, to spread what few resources there were left amongst the many, but most people never saw any of that—unless they volunteered to go work in the hot zones.
Dean paused, unwilling to interrupt his momentum, unsure if he’d be able to keep going if he let himself rest. “Sounds like we’ll need more than the demon blade.”
He squared his shoulders and waited impatiently, and before Sam even had his door closed, Dean was backing out of the small lot. Of course, Sam had to huff about it like a princess.
They all moved to Bobby’s heap of junk, Dean lying prone in the backseat. He cursed Bobby about every thump and jolt the car took on the ruined road—unevenness that Dean hadn’t noticed on the way in, but now rocked his side with every small divot. He slowed his breathing and tried to focus on what would come next.
When he was done, which, based on what his stomach was currently doing, was too quickly, he looked up at Afriel and Turiel. “You feathered dicks have jerked us around enough,” he said, still swallowing. “What’s one more round?” He leaned back to take some of the pressure off his gut.
“Cas, this is getting to me, man,” He hoped he didn’t sound as exposed as he felt. “It’s too… close. It’s not something I—” Dean stopped, unsure of how to finish his thought.
“What the hell, Cas?” Dean snapped, before noticing their car was swinging a little too close to the metal guardrail. "Goddamn it.”
Dean rubbed his hands over his face and sighed. It should have been an impossible choice, but at the time he’d made it, and he made it pretty damn clear that he valued Sam’s life over Cas’. But Sam was his brother, and there was nothing in this world or the next that would stop Dean from protecting him.
“You,” Cas rasped. “You told me you didn’t care that I was broken, that you didn’t care if I died,” he finally reached out and shoved Dean once, angelic strength forcing him back to hit the wall harder than a normal push would. “And then you don’t talk to me for days. You can’t even look at me.” He looked lost, like he was trying to find answers where Dean didn’t have any.
“Give it to me,” Abaddon said, her hollow voice still managing to radiate from her chest. Dean winced at the sound.
“All clean?” She asked.
Bobby didn’t race over to where he was sitting, didn’t push Dean away to deliver some miracle cure, which is what Dean had been hoping would happen—that he would come in here and
Dean let Sam come to his own conclusions, giving in and laughing at the look on his brother’s face. Sam turned back around and went back to bed, defeated, as Dean gathered up what he might need for the walk to the car. Gun. Knife. Lighter. Flask. Check and check.
“Legacies? Interesting. Who was your father?”
“Yeah. I mean Cas seems like he’s doing better, too. But we should wait until he gives us the green light. I don’t want to take any more out of him.” Dean could hear the remorse in Sam’s voice, which only piled on top of his own.
“If this was angels,” Cas said, “they’re very likely after me. I can make the trip alone. Make sure it’s safe.”
“Thank you, Charlie,” he said quietly into her ear. Stepping back, he said, “If you’re ever in Lebanon, look me up. Do you have a pen?” She handed him a Sharpie from her pocket and he grabbed her hand to write a set of numbers on her palm. “We’ll keep our radio set at this frequency, so if you got a ham, you got us.”
When he finished, he wiped off his chin and broke protocol by using a bit of it to rinse off his face. He needed to feel a little bit of freshness this morning to get his head straight. If Bobby and Sam saw him do it, he’d never hear the end of it.
“You prayed to me,” Cas said slowly. His eyes burned into Dean’s, like he was trying to force the words out of his mouth with nothing but the colour blue.
Thank you again to my lovely beta Tardimaid! I reworked this chapter a bit so it would be longer, and I'll be posting every week on Monday and Thursdays.
“I see,” Cas said.
“Cas is right.” Dean had to force the words out of his mouth, the throb in his head getting deeper with every word. The angel’s face was drawn tight and his eyes were shining as he stared blankly at the scene around him.
“Sammy! We gotta move!” Dean called as he opened the driver’s door, putting the last bottle of whiskey behind the passenger’s seat.
“So, this bunker. Any chance whatever’s inside includes a tablet?”
“Get us as close as you can, and I’ll be able to get you home. With both of you and the supplies, but not the car,” Cas said, looking somewhat judgmentally at the cheap fabric upholstery.
Bobby focused his eyes on Dean. “Sure thing, son. Do what you gotta do,” he said, without stepping away to clear Dean’s path to the door.
“Only one way to find out.”
“It’s what… happened. What my brothers caused. The devastation, the radiation. I’m not sure. But since I’ve been back to Earth, things are… fuzzy.”
“Cas?”
Dean grabbed him to straighten him out. “Sorry, sorry, I got you,” he chuckled.
When Sam sat down, Dean passed a filled glass down the line to him, Cas carefully handing it over. He’d waited until the whole group was together to fire up the music, not wanting to waste the batteries.
“Guys!” Sam yelled from his corner of the room. The other three men poked their heads into the centre aisle like meerkats before following the sound of Sam’s voice.
“No. I only know as much as I told you. I swear it, Dean. I only knew what my superiors felt they needed to tell me or what I heard on ‘angel radio’.”
Sam raised his hands like he was waving a white flag. “Dude, I didn’t say anything.”
John would scoff—or worse—if he could see the tough hunter he’d barely raised standing in line at some ritzy coffee joint, tapping his thigh nervously as he thought about steamed milk and hot coffee and what Cas’ hand looked like when he held a pen.
The words struck something inside Dean he didn’t like, and at that moment, he hated his brother and how well he knew him. He made a mental note to press a few of Sam’s buttons later as he stood, kicking the dirt off his boots on the steps under the doorway, and swore under his breath as he struggled to wrench the damn thing open.
Cas settled back into his spot in the backseat.
“It’s very irritating,” Cas said between clenched teeth, “being stuck between two forms. It’s exhausting. Painful.”
Cas just sighed, obviously unsure of what to say.
“Come for me, Cas. Come on, sweetheart,” he muttered against the shell of Cas’ ear.
“I think so,” he said. And then, “Yes.”
He took his flask out of his pocket and drained half of it in a few long pulls. The best part of the apocalypse? No one was around to tell him drinking before noon might not be such a good idea.
None of them had mentioned the fact that Cas was eating more often, or that he was sleeping regularly, or occasionally misread one of the items that were locked away by the Men of Letters. Dean was trying to give him all the space he needed, too. He hadn’t slept in Dean’s room since the one night they’d spent together, not that Dean hadn’t made it clear that he could. He left his door open every night until he was ready to turn in, but hadn’t gotten more than a quiet goodnight as Cas walked past his room to his own.
Charlie laughed, a real one, from deep in her chest. “Dude, you have it bad.”
Two men and an angel stood outside of a Honda Accord, stopped where the road met the massive metal frame of the bridge. Their path was blocked by an enormous wall of sandbags, scrap metal, and barbed wire.
Dean scoffed. “Cas, don’t.” He was still unsteady on his feet and walked with as little of a limp as he could to the closest seat to him, which was the bench that circled the low table near the kitchenette.
**********
Together, they stepped back out into the cold grey of the nuclear winter.
He didn’t take the time Cas had. He didn’t have the finesse or the patience, he just wanted to show Cas how much he fucking loved him—needed to get his mouth on him. So, he tugged Cas’ jeans down his hips, flicking his tongue against the head of Cas’ cock before he’d even fully pulled him out of his boxers.
**********
“You are everything to me,” he whispered.
He shifted and put his hand on the small of Cas’ back to get his attention. “What do ya think? Is it safe to hand this thing over to Michael?”
Dean laughed. He felt good. Clean. His clothes were even in a washing machine. An actual, honest-to-god washing machine. And after making their trades with Charlie’s people they had enough food to last them a couple weeks, if they didn’t mind supplementing real food with energy bars. He was even drinking coffee he didn’t have to dig twigs out of.
“Dean?” Cas asked, low, dark—like it was coming from the pit of his stomach.
It was getting darker, and if they were going to make it to Lebanon in decent time, they needed to leave. They didn’t have time to make friends. It wasn’t
Back then, when Bobby’s house was still burning, the demon that had crawled outside of the warded gates of the yard was still re-settling into the meat suit. She shook out her arms and legs, rolling her shoulders as she regained control of the limbs that she abandoned when Castiel turned his power on them. It wasn’t her first time inhabiting a body, but she wished she still had the first one she had. It was smooth, beautiful—even for a human. But the Men of Letter had seen to that.
Around the fire was where they spent most of their evenings—it was their only source of real warmth. But every night it was too quiet, all of them eating automatically and lost in thoughts that didn’t need dwelling on.
There were some signs of life, of other people who had passed through, but nothing was left that didn’t have four or more legs.
“They have showers,” Sam said simply, sounding defeated.
“What? No. All my stuff is in Bobby’s car. We’ll keep the rides the same.”
That’s how they carried on, free to start living beyond the ways necessary for survival, surrounded by a small, extended family they could rely on to save people and each other.
There was no one in the house. He worked his way down the hall, holding on to the wall for a bit of support, and made his way downstairs. He struggled with the door until he realized the bolt was turned. Swearing under his breath he unlocked it and stumbled onto the porch where he could see tents he recognized from the night before.
“I could… smite the blockage if you prefer,” Cas said.
A few of the trespassers dropped their arms. Of course they’d heard of Castiel, the Winchester’s signature angel. And most of them knew what he and his kind were capable of. It was probably the worst-kept secret of the pre-apocalypse.
“Yeah.” Dean shifted where he stood, balling his hands into fists to stop himself from shoving them in his pockets. “I think, I mean, I
They were looking for something. A black car.
“I need to tell you something, both of you,” Cas said, looking at his hands instead of meeting Dean’s gaze in the rear-view mirror. “I wanted to come back to you sooner but it was… made very clear that was against Heaven’s wishes. My sister, Naomi, went to great lengths to ensure that I wouldn’t return.”
THANK YOU to everyone who has been reading. Y'all seriously make my day <3
“Drop it. He’ll be fine,” Dean warned.
The hem of Cas’ coat flicked behind him as he pulled the door of the bunker closed. “He’ll be okay,” Dean said, not even convincing himself as he went back to his task.
Dean had barely crossed the threshold of their bedroom before Cas was on him, wrapping his arms around his waist from behind and pressing his mouth against the nape of his neck. Dean sighed as he dropped his head back and pulled him closer.
When Dean saw the large, fabric-wrapped square that Sam was trying to undress with his eyes, he said, “Guess this is shelf 2B,” and reached out to grab it.
Dean pushed on the wood blocking his passage and swore under his breath. His hand left a print behind, smudging through the thick, grey dust that coated nearly everything. He wiped the residue off on his hip, but his hand was still lined with muck. The dust and ash weren’t as dangerous as it had been a few weeks ago, the levels of radiation had dissipated over time—but by then, most of the damage had already been done.
They stood, the world around them silent except for the gentle rumble of the car’s engine.
Cas hadn’t said a word since admonishing him earlier, which wasn’t really helping with the clenching.
“I came to you as soon as I could, and if I hadn’t been taken by Naomi, I would have never left. I heard every word of your prayers yet I was powerless to answer them.” Cas finally turned towards Dean. He slid his hand behind the hunter’s neck, fingers grazing the soft hairs at the back of his head, to gently force Dean to look at him. “My true form doesn’t have a heart the way humans understand it, but it still felt like it was being ripped from my chest.”
“I’ve been trying to find an appropriate way to express how sorry I am about what happened. It was a horrible mistake, and I’ve been struggling with the lack of consequences.”
“I like you this way,” Cas said, pulling the jeans off completely and getting rid of his pants at the same time. He grabbed Dean’s leg to press a kiss to the inside of his thigh—and he did it like it was no big deal, like it wasn’t the end of the fucking world.
“Morning,” Sam answered, standing up where he was leaning over open books.
“Those weren’t novels, Afriel, they were magazines,” Turiel snapped. He adjusted his beret and glared back at them all.
The first thing Cas did was drink about a pot of coffee to get his bearings and eat the oatmeal Sam had made that morning for breakfast, grimacing at the texture of the flavourless paste. Dean added some canned peaches to make it more palatable and Cas hummed as he ate, remarking on the sweetness of the soft fruit.
He shook his head and let both of his hands fall on the table. He looked at the food in front of him then over at his brother and uncle. “Goddamn it,” he sighed, exhausted from fighting, and grabbed the cooling burger. He didn’t even see Sam and Bobby start, but from the moans he was hearing, he figured they dove in as soon as he did.
When the ruse was over, when he knew there was nothing else to hide his face in (Cas’ hair, he thought, before shoving the idea away), he took the few steps to cross into the living room. Dean wasn’t sure what to do with his hands, so he shoved him in his pockets and closed them into tight fists and looked at Bobby.
Bobby was the first out the door, and he came face-to-face with an old friend.
He played the scene again and again in his head—Cas moving next to him on the bench, the press of Cas’ hand. Dean felt nauseous when he thought about how goddamn weak he’s been. Cas barely knew what he was doing. He should have stopped him, should have been there for him instead of using him like some cheap date.
**********
“I don’t need help. It’s not a large property, and most of it I can do alone,” Cas said, pushing himself up from where he sat.
This might be a good time to try to get through that apology he’d started a few days ago, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. It was done. Buried. And as far as he could tell, if he didn’t fuck up too badly again, Cas was going to let it stay dead, too.
!” A familiar voice yelled from outside.
Finally, they were in Missouri. They left the bridge behind and Dean pulled onto Route 61, which would keep them off the main highway but take them north through the state. Only a day’s drive away from Bobby’s, and Dean, not for the first time in the last few months, couldn’t wait to get off the road.
Another big thank you to the world's best Beta Tardimaid and to everyone who is reading and showing their love.
“Gross, Dean,” he said, wrinkling his nose and wiping the residue off of his face.
“He left, Dean.”
But as he moved to close the distance between them, Cas dropped down to his chest, kissing his way down the taught planes of his stomach. He paid special attention to the dip of Dean’s hip, gently digging his teeth into it and sucking at the sensitive skin as he ran his hand up the length of Dean’s cock.
So instead, he turned off the light, and whispered in the dark things he’d said before, and things he was saying for the first time, and fell asleep breathing Cas’ air and happy.
Dean blanched, and before he could stop himself, swung his head around to look at the angel. Cas was looking back at him with an unreadable expression that made his throat go dry.
“Alright. Let’s do it,” Dean said, squinting into his coffee. There was something floating in there. He swore quietly when he burned his finger struggling to drag whatever it was against the side of the mug.
“Great.” Dean didn’t know where to go from here. He was fidgeting like a kid in math class. “Let’s go get Sam. Maybe he can help.”
Cas shifted, where once he would have stood soldier-still. He sat down, his weight dipping the cheap spring mattress.
“We don’t know. But I thought maybe… these would work.” He pulled a canvas bag out of his pocket and poured its contents on the table. Bullets.
“You have first lookout tonight. Do you want me to take it so you can get some rest after the drive?”
It kept him up at night sometimes. He’d lie in bed in the upstairs room, listening to himself inhale and exhale and watching the walls around him flex and relax in response.
“Never better,” he said. “Now get out of my room. I’ll meet you in the library in ten.”
He tapped his foot on the floor for a minute, feeling a little frantic, then rubbed tears out of his eyes with the ball of his hand.
He groaned and turned away from Sam.
Dean unzipped the top of his jacket, the warmth of the larger fire he’d built was adding to the warmth in his belly and making him feel overheated. He leaned back in the plastic Adirondack chair to enjoy his buzz. He couldn’t even bring himself to care that a pretty big chunk of the top of the chair had been melted away at some point. The smell of burning plastic barely registered anymore. Bliss.
**********
“You’ve arrived,” he said. Dean closed his eyes.
“Yes, I’m ready to leave. I hate it here.”
The half-full bottle he’d brought with him from the Impala was long gone, but Dean had already grabbed another one from the trunk. He found if he kept booze in the kitchen it would disappear too quickly. Plus, the walk didn’t hurt. It gave him something to do most days—a little privacy.
“I don’t—” He tried to push himself up again, but Sam held him back, just enough to press him back against the bed. He needed to get up, but he could barely move.
At the sound of the plate dragging across the Formica, he heard the other two men sigh in unison. Then, they each pushed their own plates away, Bobby a little bit slower than Sam.
“This reminds me of the bridge,” Cas said, looking around as he followed Dean along the perimeter.
Bobby grunted in agreement.
“Hey,” he shook him gently, “Hey, Sammy. Buddy.” His hands were shaking as he looked at his gaunt face, and the wounds he could see forming around his mouth and nose. Sam wasn’t waking up, and Dean was frozen as his brain raced through everything he’d learned as a hunter that could fix someone. Stitches, pills, alcohol, spells, crossroad demons… Fuck.
By the time Turiel stepped away, the colour had returned to Dean’s pallid, clammy skin and he breathed in his first deep breath in hours.
“Even now,” Cas’ face shadowed, “you had to lock the door to hold my hand.”
He heard the stairs squeaking as someone came down to join him, and he closed his eyes to listen.
to make friends.
Getting his bearings, Sam found their location on the fading map. “He’s right,” he said again. “We stopped here for a night before heading north.”
?” Dean challenged. He knew they knew, at least part of him did, but it was pissing him off how they were acting around him. His eyes returned to the pistol in his hands, looking for spots to polish although it was already shining its brightest silver. He needed a way out; this wasn’t the time. Not before their big potential meet and greet with two feathery dicks. He glanced at the door.
“Jesus, Dean.” Sam’s face twisted, but he didn’t turn his face away from the book it was buried in.
“I’m losing everything I am,” he said, small and unsure. He looked so goddamn it human it broke Dean’s heart.
“We can probably pull it down. It’s not exactly stable.”
Cas. He sighed. He couldn’t see from where he was lying down, but Dean assumed he was outside sitting by the fire, where he usually was in the mornings. Maybe he’d even gotten the coffee started.
“What type of artifact?” Cas asked, his voice as cold and sharp as his weapon.
“She was a Knight of Hell. Nothing in this realm is capable of killing her. I figured that would at least slow her down.”
Cas groaned, his mouth falling open as he flexed his hips and ground his cock into the bend of Dean’s groin. He rested his forehead against the hunter’s. “Tell me what you want,” he said, his breath warm against Dean’s lips.
All things considered, it wasn’t too far off from what they usually did.
“Into… princesses. Princes. You know what I mean.” It was the first time he’d said it out loud to someone outside of Cas, and in his stupor, he felt something close to relief but it still made his jaw clench. Charlie hadn’t done anything more than listen, but he still looked up at her with a pinched face, fearing her reaction.
He swallowed back bile.
is going on?” Dean asked. His eyes were darting between all of the pieces of chaos painted into the scene in front of him.
“Like, eight more hours? Maybe a bit more.”
“Put on some music, would ya? Something loud,” he said without opening his eyes.
But he’d fucked up with Sam, too. And Bobby.
. “Come with me,” the man directed. “You can bring your drinks.”
Cas’ breath was hot against his neck then, suddenly, he was back on Dean’s mouth, swallowing him whole and letting out desperate noises as his hips jerked forward, rutting against the bend of Dean’s hip.
Cas shook his head, lost for words. Dean wanted to shake him.
“Look. I don’t care who sits on what,” Dean interjected, flexing his fingers around Cas’ thigh one more time before letting his hand slip away. “How will you fix all this if we help you.”
Cas stayed quiet for a moment. He rolled his shoulders and lifted a hand to knead at the sore muscles in his neck before dropping it back in his lap in defeat.
“Should we take another walk around the perimeter, Dean?”
“What the
“It’s around here,” he said finally. “We should take the cars. You guys follow us.”
“There shouldn’t be any permanent effects of breaking the spell, but the only way to do so is by removing him from this place permanently or destroying the structure to which he’s bound.”
“Dude, would you move?” He tried to shake the feeling off.
, he thought,
Some of the people in town had reported seeing a couple of strange cars in Lawrence. They stuck pretty closely to the outskirts and didn’t seem like they’d be trouble, but she still needed to keep an eye on anyone who wasn’t driving straight through. She watched as they pulled up to an old farmhouse just outside of city limits.
Sam invited them to take it by pointing at the half-unwrapped tablet on the ground, still lying where it landed when Abaddon attacked them.
“I kind of love it, too.”
“I’m sorry, you’re right. Maybe we should get some rest.”
“Welcome to mi casa! Consider it su casa—at least for the night,” she said, leaning against her moped without seeming at all like she was surprised they’d actually showed up. Once his eyes adjusted to the light, Dean could see tents set up outside of the houses, green and blue tarps supported by scrap wood and metal outside of the houses, lining the street.
They hammered out the details of their plan until things started to make sense, even to Dean, who was struggling to focus through his fugue.
“So what are we walking into exactly?” Bobby asked.
“Great. Now come on, you could use some fresh air,” Dean said as he grabbed Cas by the hands and pulled him out of his chair.
Sam looked out of his window and Dean heard him sigh deeply. There were always bodies there, people who hadn’t made it far enough inland in time or had been stupid enough to start driving when the air was still poison.
“It seems empty, but I don’t see how we could find anything liveable,” Sam said, squinting sceptically at their surroundings.
“That’s where you’ll find the key,” he said, sitting back down and settling back into the same position he’d been in the entire conversation. “It’s hidden in a Men of Letters safehouse. Very few members of our organization knew of its existence, and it’s been protected so the building will still be intact.”
“I’m sorry, that took longer than I’d anticipated. I found more water.” He had a lap full of squeaking, plastic bottles and he was covered in dirt—different than the soot he’d already cleared away from the fire in the megastore. It was streaked along his jaw and his black hair was covered in a soft down of ash.
“Yeah, we’ll be alright. As long as I have my angelic EMF meter over there,” Dean said.
“Goddamn it!” Bobby yelled, and Dean picked up his pace, running down the hallway into the room where the commotion was coming from.
After a few moments of silence, except for Dean’s laboured breathing and the brush of skin against denim, Cas whispered, “Good,” so deep and close that Dean could feel it under his skin.
“Cas please, please move.” Dean pulled him closer and dragged him down for a kiss, promising him without words that he was fine, that he needed it.
“So, you’re here,” the old man said, his voice papery with age. “I’m Larry Ganem. Please, come in.”
Dean shook his head, wishing he had the answer. “I’m betting worst-case scenario.”
“Hold… tighter—” He couldn’t say it, but put his hand over Cas’ where it had settled at the bend of his hip. “Yeah, like that,” he sighed as Cas gripped Dean tight enough to bruise.
And with that, Cas’ body tensed and shook and he came into Dean’s waiting mouth, covering his lips and chin in a hot, sticky mess.
“We need to get you back to bed,” Dean said, ignoring Sam’s question, but Sam shrugged Dean’s hand off of his shoulder.
Dean and Cas piled into the back seat as Bobby and Sam sat up front. Dean let his head roll against the back of the bench and lazily looked at Cas.
“Dean—” Cas started, pulling Dean out of his thoughts. He almost would have forgotten the guy was beside him if it weren’t for the strip of warmth running down his arm from where it was resting against Cas. The hood of this car is too damn narrow, he thought.
"All yours," he said, pushing past the angel to walk back to the trailer alone.
“That blows,” he said. It wasn’t enough, but it’s all he could muster.
“Watch it,” Dean said, pointing a finger in his face as he stepped away. “And get the flashlight. We need to check the pharmacy.”
Her face lit up and she grabbed the front of his grey jacket and shook it, “Mais oui! We met those nice people last time, the ones who didn’t try to kill us.”
“This way,” Dean said, cocking his head. His boot hit the dirt and dead leaves that acted as Bobby’s driveway and it helped him feel closer to shore. He led Cas to the side of the house and through the stacks of cars that filled the yard, ignoring the dead, dry grass that had once been the only colourful thing that grew between the old tires and cinder blocks. “We have it pretty good out here,” Dean explained as they walked, “which might bite us in the ass if we aren’t careful about it. We can’t start feelin’ too safe.”
“That’s all you talked about last night. ‘Oh the world’s hottest angel is so funny and cool and I’m not good enough for him,” she imitated Dean at his most pathetic, dropping her voice an octave. “At first I thought it was a nickname, but then you started babbling about celestial wavelengths and the Chrysler Building and I kinda put it together.”
That thought was enough to peel him off the flattened cushions he called a bed and get him into his boots. He blinked at the brightness of the morning and tried to focus his eyes, getting to the firepit more by memory than sight.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m Bobby,” the old hunter admitted, sounding as irritable as ever.
Sam was completely passed out by the time Dean was ducking his head to walk through the short entrance to the trailer.
He blinked, face burning at the thought. He had to clear his head. That, as good as that sounded, wasn’t what he needed to be focused on.
“Jesus,” Bobby said with weight, breaking the tension.
?” Dean spluttered. But on the white wrap-around porch, there they were. Two small wicker baskets filled with soft-looking, purple flowers, a burst of colour against the neutral tones of the home and the stark landscape it seemed almost painted into.
“All aboard,” he said, gesturing with his head for Castiel to climb in.
“Enough. One of you at a time,” Cas said, in the commanding voice that sent sparks from Dean’s chest to the soles of his feet. He ignored it, mostly, and tried to stay focused.
Cas’ gaze could have melted glass, and Dean was surprised the mug didn’t turn to liquid in his hands as he focused on the slow pour of the espresso and seemed to count every second of every step of making Dean’s coffee.
Afriel sighed and straightened her clothes once Turiel released them. “Yeah, okay, maybe you’re right. But the last war went on for eons. Let’s just take a few hours,” she appealed. “We’ve been here for weeks and all we’ve done is follow those idiots across the country and sit around in this room. Let’s see a little bit more of the planet before it burns up completely.”
because of some asshole God’s asshole kids. But they had a real clue this time. A direction. No more weird hints or hunting down Horsemen, no more trials or tricksters or pushing from both sides. And if they could find the tablet and deliver the goods, maybe they had a chance—maybe they could succeed at what they’d failed so enormously at the first time.
“We can’t touch any of this until we get back to Bobby’s. There are energy bars in the car.”
Okay, a little progress. Maybe not good progress, but it was something.
The wind picked up haggard hems the rags the two strange angels were wearing, just like Dean knew it would do to Cas’ coat.
Cas didn’t laugh, but he didn’t frown either. Dean’s smile faded from his face as he lost his grip on the Charming Dean Winchester persona, that mask slipping a little. He looked over to the trees and into the pitch-black beyond them.
Dean remembered. He remembered asking his dad what monster they were after in Normal. John hadn’t answered. He’d just said, “Not a monster, son.” And after dumping them in a motel just outside of some small town, he came back two days later and they got back on the road. Dean never asked him about it again.
“I’m up for it,” Sam answered. “Cas?”
The bell rang, drawing Cas’ attention to the door. He was standing behind the counter with his sleeves rolled, like they’d been yesterday, and he would have almost looked casual if it weren’t for the blue tie he wore tucked under his apron.
“Hey, my word is all I got,” Dean said, smiling right back. “How about we have a little family bonding time before solving the Great Sigil Mystery of 2011? Dip into the emergency reserves? We can make it a… party. Or whatever.”
. I’m not good at it, never have been.”
“Mind getting the other one, then?” Dean asked, pointing to the lock on the room beside the first.
“We’re not safe here.” It was barely more than a whisper, but they heard it. Cas squatted down to touch the face of one of the dead hunters. “Rufus said more will come. That people know where we are. I can’t provide that kind of protection.”
Dean lunged forward but Sam held him back by his elbow, shooting pain up his side that Dean could barely feel.
The headache that he’d woken up with was getting worse with every step he took, like his brain was loose and cracking against the sides of his skull. He wished they had extra painkillers. Sam had finally put his foot down and determined hangovers were a waste of the precious pills, although Bobby and Dean fought him on it. He knew they’d traded some to Charlie last night—maybe she’d take pity on him and share a couple.
“You know something about this we don’t, Cas?” He was trying to keep his voice measured. He knew Cas wouldn’t lie to them on purpose. Not again.
Cas ran his hands up Dean’s sides. “I took more pleasure than I should have marking your ribs, claiming you as my own,” he said, before leaning forward to flick his tongue over the peak of Dean’s nipple, measuring the hunter’s response before closing his mouth around it.
“I just wanted to say I’m sorry for all the dumb shit I said before about… the wings. I actually think they’re, uh, pretty cool. And I shouldn’t have gone off like that. I shouldn’t have let you go either, but it was easier than admitting I’m a total dumbass.” It was always embarrassing talking to no one, but it was even worse when he was getting stonewalled. “Yeah,” he finished lamely. “Okay.”
“That?” He pointed to the bar. “Made all of
, he thought.
“Jesus, sorry Charlie.”
He grabbed a few bottles of brown liquor off of the shelf and cradled them in his gloved hands as he slowly made his way back over to his brother, scanning the shelves for anything useful as he went. This close to the coast, the pickings were slim.
“You’re tired,” Cas said, his fingers resting on the side of Dean’s face, waiting for permission. Dean didn’t have it in him to fight, to tell Cas to save it for the bigger and badder things they’d need him for.
“Roughly 2pm,” he said, obviously not distracted.
“What’s wrong?” Cas asked when he saw the look on Dean’s face.
“Damned, fucking, stupid music box ballerinas,” Bobby said, stamping on a few more pieces of the plastic carnage for good measure. “How many more of these rooms left?” he asked, red and out of breath.
But when Cas said, “We’ll need to ready our weapons and formulate a plan. Normal isn’t a large town, but it’s sizeable enough that we can’t search it entirely,” and slowly, painfully slowly, slid his hand over Dean’s half-hard cock, his mind went blank.
“Why do I feel like you mean that literally,” Dean let out a breathy laugh and followed Cas’ eye-line to the phones against the wall. “Haven’t really needed those lately.”
is not an option,” Turiel spat. “You would sacrifice the lives of your brothers and sisters—for what? For this reeking planet?”
“Yeah? Yeah, I’m good,” Dean said, finally opening his eyes. He could feel the aching in his scalp from where the crescents of his blunt nails had dug in. That was real, he was here.
“So they’ve finally bothered to show up,” Turiel said, watching the two classic cars drive past the window. “We should go,” he decided, gathering himself up.
Anyone who wasn’t dead felt like it was just a waiting game until they were. The burns, sickness, lesions… it was hard to live with. But those who could—and few could—persisted, as humans are so insistent on doing. Even if the only way of living meant they might have to kill someone else to do it.
“Hey,” he tried to keep Cas awake. “You okay, buddy? You with me?” When the angel didn’t answer, Dean held him tighter and dropped his head to press his face into Cas’ hair. “Come on, Cas, come on. Come back to me,” he begged, prayed, as he twisted a fist into the fabric of his coat.
Sam looked at Cas’ tattoo and blinked in surprise.
As he walked towards the storeroom they’d agreed to meet in, Dean heard a loud crash.
“What’re you talking about?” Dean felt that same painful bubble growing inside him, the one he felt when Sammy threw his jacket over the shelf or when Bobby put his dishes in the sink without cleaning them and putting them away. It made no sense, but he couldn’t shake it.
“No, Dean.”
“Do, what d’we think?” Dean addressed the group, looking away from the cat and into the line of trees that surrounded the park.
But Dean didn’t see any of that. He didn’t notice the rusted machinery or see the vapour of his breath or the group of demons standing across from him. He wiped the sweat out of his eyes and scanned the room looking for a beige trench coat.
“Alright,” Dean said. “Alright. This is obviously a trap, right? We go to Normal, we end up angel chow.”
He kept his eyes focused on the road in front of him. The dark asphalt was still wet with morning dew, flat and smooth—a stark contrast to the twisted, grey landscapes that lined the highway.
Classic Dean Winchester, adding another body to the pile of people he hurt and left behind.
“Yeah, it sucked, but now I always get the house to myself.” She shrugged her way through a half-laugh, trying to brush things off with a joke, but her smile wasn’t quite authentic as she said it.
Dean nodded. He blinked up at the door, Sam or Bobby could come in at any second.
“Comfort me?” Cas asked with his back turned to him. “Make me feel better about my deformation?”
“Hello Dean,” a gravelly voice said at his shoulder, and he almost jumped out of his skin.
“Hey, Cas,” Charlie said, grinning.
There was always something brilliant about Cas, something bright that shone through his stoic, serious exterior. Not his grace or his true form, just him. But lately, every time he came back from whatever weird angel mission he’d been on, it seemed like he was dimmed. He was losing that glistening edge and becoming so much more like the human version of himself that Dean wanted to forget.
“Are you redecorating?” he asked, openly curious.
Dean grinned as Cas ran his lips along the skin at the collar of Dean’s t-shirt. He made a small, impatient sound and pulled the fabric roughly aside to uncover more flushed skin.
“Thanks,” he said, taking it. “You might want to clean up a little, too,” He was looking at Dean like he wasn’t sure what had happened, and Dean realized Sammy probably didn’t remember spitting blood all over his face. He found a clean spot on the cloth and gave his own face a wipe, if only to comfort Sam.
Sam pointed at the two angels. Dean blinked, almost surprised to see them. As he turned, he and Cas leaned against each other, arms around waists to hold themselves up.
“Awesome.”
“Sammy,” he yelled over to his brother, “Give her… whatever.”
Cas nodded, but as Dean dropped one hand to cup the front of his jeans, his hand flew into Dean’s hair to pull his head back and look at him, his eyes dark and his mouth slack.
His heart jumped into his throat as he started running through the hazy, incomplete clip show of his memories from the night before. He kept his arms wrapped around Cas’ waist and his head buried in his hip, hoping he wasn’t giving himself away as awake. He remembered… fuck what did he remember? He said something stupid to Charlie that was for sure. The cold, crushing pressure of anxiety settled into his chest as he scrambled to piece together why he felt like such an asshole.
“This is it?” he asked. “The key to the bunker?”
Eventually, they ran out of people able to work. The system broke apart, with the hungry taking back what had at one time been theirs. The leaders that rose from the ashes, who founded communities and communes, well, they always had a way of finding the means—and meat—to feed their people. It just so happened a lot of people were happier to stay ignorant about where it came from.
Dean finished his beer and put the empty bottle on the table. He opened the second one with his lighter.
“Yeah, I know.” Dean checked his rearview, through the gaps in the supplies piled in the backseat and saw Bobby and Sam climbing out of the Chevelle, looking at the house with matching looks of apprehension on their faces. “But we don’t have much choice. Look, we’re in the home stretch. We deal with whatever’s in there, we find the bunker, we finish it.”
“I’ve never, uh” he started.
“What? With the sigil?” Playing dumb had gotten him out of a few difficult conversations in the past, and he was really hoping this could be one of those times.
Breaking the red seal and pulling out the note, he squinted as he read the looping handwriting. He handed the note to Sam without a word.
**********
One of the men was already trying to lift a woman through the ground-floor window they’d been using as a makeshift flue.
Bobby gave him a tired look but went back to his book without saying a word back.
Forget the pep talk, just for once.
Dean bit his lip and watched Cas’ reaction as he palmed his dick. “You like that more?”
**********
She smiled and reapplied the red lipstick she’d taken from a pillaged drug store. Afriel and Turiel were making her job so much easier.
“He may lose himself completely to this place,” Cas said.
That was it. That was the moment Dean Winchester could have finally turned on his brother. Shot him. Left him for dead. Abandoned him to the wanderers or the devil or both. And Sam must have been able to see it written all over his face because he just looked at him and said, “Oh, what’re you gonna
Cas dropped his hand
Without another word, they all climbed back into their cars and headed back from where they came—a little closer to the highway, a little further away from the heart of town—and pulled into the parking lot of the motel.
“Dean, lay off,” Sam said. “You’re being an asshole.”
“How much longer we got?” Dean asked.
This wasn’t the weirdest thing Sam and Dean had experienced by a longshot. They’d both been jerked around by enough angels in the past to recognize when they were dealing with their weird obsession with
Cas still hadn’t moved from where he was standing. “Come here,” he said, with a voice that sounded like it was rolling over the sharp edges of broken stone.
“So, are you going to tell me what the hell happened in there?” Sam asked as they flew down the highway.
Cas leaned up to kiss him softly and, to Dean, it kinda felt like the beginning of a promise.
“My name is Castiel.” Dean was pretty sure if he was at full power his eyes would be shooting sparks trying to get a read on this chick.
Sam wrenched open the trailer door and put their loot inside as Bobby sat groaning into his chair beside Dean’s.
Afriel and Turiel smiled in unison. It was creepy, and made Dean instantly regret what Sam had said. “You good with this, Cas?”
He turned towards the voice so abruptly he almost wrenched his neck.
The telltale crunch of slow footsteps behind him alerted him to Sam’s approach, and he turned to meet his brother. He looked like death warmed over, but made it to the car nonetheless.
When Cas sat on the edge of the bed and leaned down to press his lips to the exposed skin, the smile disappeared from Dean’s face as his mouth fell open. His hand flew into Cas’ hair—not pulling, just letting the soft slip of it run between his fingers—as he lifted himself up on one elbow.
“He’s my best man— er, my best friend.” Dean’s tongue was thick in his mouth. Too thick. He looked around for some water and settled for grabbing the bottle Sam was fiddling with, ignoring his brother’s protests.
The mystery had gotten under his skin and Dean’s blood thrummed with the need to get out of the park and get started on the case.
Bobby shrugged his shoulders. “Alright, so let’s hang onto it. At least until we figure out what we’re gonna do with the thing. There’s still a chance Michael will keep his word, and I’d like to steer clear of the wrong end of an angel blade.”
**********
Cas stood, looking at him with his eyebrows drawn together and his head tilted to the side. His lips were pursed, and he didn’t look like he was about to say anything, so Dean spoke to break the uncomfortable silence, pulling his eyes away to look anywhere else.
Dean wanted to laugh, tried to. But that morning—things were still too fresh in his mind. Instead, he bit off a mouthful of the mushy noodles. “Welcome to paradise,” he said.
“What’s going on?” Dean shouted as he burst into the room.
It took a lot for Dean to walk back out through the door, and once he did, he wished he could go back in and forget any of it had ever happened.
“Of course, Dean,” Cas answered, the discomfort fading from his face fading as Dean relaxed. The wing he was resting on twitched, and Dean felt the long feathers that fanned across the bottom of it brush down his arm.
He lost his breath as Abaddon slammed him hard into the metal door of the bunker, once, then again when he got up to grab the gun where it had fallen. He felt something, a rib maybe, crack on the second hit. His head was ringing and his vision blurred. He slid to the ground but gathered himself up to advance on her again, half crawling up the stairs towards the demon wearing a hunter’s corpse.
“Yeah. And it’s not gonna get any warmer.”
“I do not trust Afriel and Turiel,” Cas said gravely, “and I think we would be foolish to blindly trust these Men of Letters. I read their journal and they were collectors of very powerful artifacts—any of which could be used against us.” He glanced back over at the house, an odd, shining beacon in the apocalypse.
“I said I’m good,” he said, and although he tried to muster the energy to sound pissed, it was impossible from his place on the couch.
Sam pulled Cas up to help him move to the debris-covered couch. Dean stood, trying to keep steady until giving up to collapse next to Cas, wiping the sweat and dirt from his face with the hand that wasn’t covered in blood. He felt Sam’s weight land beside him.
Inside, the smell of mildew hit him with the same weight that it did every time he walked in. He drained the dregs of the whiskey he’d brought in him with and tossed the bottle in the sink. He leaned over it for a second, watching a cockroach disappear down the drain at the noise.
He didn’t know what to do with his hands, so he shoved them in his pockets and settled for bumping his shoulder against Cas’ again as they stood outside and waited for everyone to get their heads together after what just happened.
Between shots, they traded a few other things. Some tomato-based canned food for some  non-tomato-y canned food. A few of their unused masks for a flashlight (Dean felt Bobby’s eyes on him when he made that trade). They even got some fresh bottled water for a few packages of Advil. Charlie told them showers were on the house, but they’d have to wait until the next day if they wanted warm water.
“Dean?” Bobby called, raising his arm to block the glare.
Dean was scanning their faces, trying to make them out in the weak beam of light and through the smoke that lingered in the fetid air. He was running through the list of monsters that would eat like this, would live like this.
-type shit.
“Stop being so fucking irresistible,” he said, close to his mouth.
As he closed the front door, Sammy appeared in the hall from the living room. “All good?”
Dean could feel Cas start to move forward but stopped him with a quick look. The cold air made the hair raise on Dean’s arms—he hadn’t had time to grab his jacket from where Sam had thrown it and all he was wearing was a black t-shirt. A drop of sweat ran down his neck but he held still, keeping his weapon pointed at the leader of the group.
“Bad how?” Dean had been to hell. He’d faced Lucifer, and killed Death, and worked with his own dead father to end Azazel. He wasn’t worried about a binding spell. Not really.
“Dean, I’ll—”
“Mornin’,” he said casually, clearing his throat.
“Alright buddy, rub it in,” Dean said, as he and Sam grabbed some of the bags from Cas’ arms and pushed their way inside.
They were moving on Cas as a group, like animals backed into a corner, driven by fear and desperation. Dean coughed a wet laugh as he saw the weapons they were using. Kitchen knives and cleavers they’d pilfered from the shelves of the store against a freakin’ angel. He could barely breathe.
Dean tucked himself back into his underwear without bothering to do up his jeans. Cas rolled over and wrapped his arm around Dean’s middle, digging his nose into the crook of Dean’s neck and settling in, letting out little satisfied sounds that were muffled by Dean’s shoulder.
Cas didn’t reply with anything more than a quiet groan, but his shoulders rolled back and the wings shook and spread around him, almost pushing Dean off the bed. He was lost for a moment in a blanket of soft, impenetrable darkness until they settled quietly down. It was hypnotizing, watching them move as if they were liquid, and Dean couldn’t stop himself from combing his fingers through the black feathers and then pressing up to bury into the soft down underneath.
Cas fell back in his chair, outside of the light. Dean could still see the outline of his face and leaned into the small amount the heat the candle was giving off to warm his side.
That twisted thing inside him was tightening, winding up his insides until he couldn’t sit still any longer.
“Awesome,” Dean said. “Nice to get some good news around here.”
Dean was lost in his work. It was something he enjoyed, something that cleared his mind. He looked up with surprise when he realized Cas occupied the chair next to him.
Back in the warm, well-lit library, Dean scowled at Bobby. “Have a nice afternoon?” he asked, still brushing cobwebs off of his shirt.
“We’ve got showers set up,” she said, wiggling her eyebrows. “The water even stays hot for a couple of minutes.”
So, no one was happy, which sort of made them all feel a little bit more at home.
Dean knew the place. “Think it’ll be empty?”
“More like friggin’ luxury. I should have set that damn couch on fire before we left the park,” he said, relaxing into the musty pillows. He twisted, trying to get comfortable, but the headache that had started earlier wasn’t helping him any.
“Nah, it’s a—” he stopped again, waiting for the burn in his face to subside. “It’s a sigil or a spooky… thing.” Dean was mad at himself, frustrated because he was looking for a case to get moving, for the first time in so long he felt like
“Enochian,” Dean clarified. “Might come in handy one day.”
Dean lifted the hem of his shirt to show him where the oil was staining the dark cotton even darker. “This stuff. Is it angel sweat, or something?”
And here it is. The final chapter.
“I like it, Dean. It makes me stand out,” she said. She sounded tired of explaining it, and for some reason, Dean felt bad for asking.
Castiel moved on Turiel, grabbing him by the throat and lifting him until he was on his feet. The three hunters stood and moved back, but Dean knew each of them were formulating some sort of plan of attack in their heads.
It was too much, it was overwhelming. Heat calloused hands were skimming and digging into every soft piece of flesh they could find, sending shockwaves of bright lightning down his thighs and into the deepest part of him. As those hands pushed his legs back and apart, and as Cas slowly sunk in deeper and harder than he’d ever hoped, his back arched and he found himself praying again—maybe this time out loud.
Cas made a small, needy sound that made blood pool heavy in the pit of Dean’s stomach. He opened his mouth a little more, and Cas slid his thumb inside. Dean closed his lips and sucked, swirling his tongue to taste more of the earthy spice that coated it.
He reached an unsteady hand out to run down the centre of Cas’ back where the wings were fused with his spine. The skin there was hot, too hot, and Cas’ gasp turned into a pained hiss as Dean’s fingertips brushed carefully against him. The sound almost made Dean pull his hand away, but instead, he pressed his palm against the angry twist of muscle to help soothe it.
“May I continue?” Turiel asked.
Fucking Cas.
**********
“That’s better,” Dean whispered.
“And, their uncle Bobby,” Turiel added, looking him up and down with disdain.
“Do we need an occasion to unwind a little, Sammy?” The music had been playing quietly, a habit from trying to remain undetected, but Dean clicked the volume button twice to help make things a little livelier. A little more normal.
“Alright, Castiel. How uh… how many miles until our turnoff?”
“Fine. Later it is,” he said.
Cas moved away, lavishing the inside of his thigh with hungry, open-mouthed kisses, and gently ran one slick finger—Dean wondered if Cas used grace it was so wet and warm—in small circles over the muscle where his tongue had just been.
The four of them moved forward together into the husk of the park, each pulling out their weapon as they crossed under the rusted sign.
As Dean’s blade cut through the bone and tendons holding the Bangungot’s head to her body, he looked up at Cas, who was watching as he grunted through the hack job. He had a tiny alarm go off in his head after he was done. Would this be the moment he left again, going God knows where to do who the fuck knows what? Or would he stick around a while?
He took one last look behind him, then hit play on the car’s disk player. Dean couldn’t even be picky about the fact he had to use CDs—finding them had been one of the only good things that had happened since the world went to hell. Sam still made fun of the sound he’d made when he pulled the old book full of them out from the backseat of the car.
Dean laughed as the air was knocked out of him, but it was bitten off with a small moan as Cas leaned in to brush his nose behind his ear, breathing him in.
“No. Nope. TMI! TMI!” She screamed a laugh and covered her ears. The other people under the tent looked over at the commotion. “Nothing to see here, people,” she said when she finally composed herself and dismissed them with a wave.
“Sammy,” Dean said, slapping his hand away from the machine. “Tomorrow you can have all the quiet you want. You can even wear that bitchy little look on your face all day. But tonight, we’re gonna enjoy some R n’ R. Drink?”
“This is hardly ‘third degree,’ I’m just wondering how you are. The protection spell I used was,” he paused, “old magic. I wouldn’t have used it if I didn’t believe you had the strength to handle it, but I’m just trying to be—a good friend.”
“What the hell, Sam?” Dean said, surprised at his brother’s candour. Sam just shrugged his shoulders, like he hadn’t known what else to say.
“Hey Cas, take a load off. You’re making me nervous.” The angel sat down wordlessly beside him and rested his hands on his knees. “Long day?” Dean asked.
As they were rolling down the desolate highway, Dean still felt pretty good despite the depressing scenery. It felt right to finally be moving.
“I’m just, uh, I was trying to—”
Dean pursed his mouth, thinking.
Dean swore when he saw it. But he also wondered if he’d ever seen Cas’ handwriting before. He couldn’t remember, but it was so easy to imagine Cas carefully printing the straightforward, blocky letters with one of his small, private smiles.
“We’re all trying to figure it out, Cas. That’s why we’ve got family.”
Cas looked like he was about to reach out again, but he stopped himself, hand instead balling into a fist at his side.
“That curse. I believe the witch tried to bring my angelic form into this plane of existence. To… expose me.”
“Michael cannot be permitted to take God’s seat.” His presence filled up more of the large space, shrinking even Afriel and Turiel as he carefully walked towards them.
**********
The top of the water wouldn’t twist off until it did, Dean’s firm hold on the flimsy bottle pushing water all over the mattress. He closed his eyes and took a grateful mouthful and swished it around in his mouth until his swollen cheeks felt somewhat hydrated.
It had been two months since the blasts when Dean and Sam had ventured too close to the coast to try and find any of the dwindling supplies there were left to pilfer. When Sam had gone back into the Gas n’ Sip with his mask around his chin to grab some warming pads for their hands. When he had gotten a face full of toxic dust that kicked up when he knocked the display over in his haste. A total fluke.
Like the other rooms, there weren’t any obvious signs that other people were currently living here—no useable supplies, no bags, no clothes. Dean went into the bathroom and, with little hope, tried the knobs in the shower. Nothing. He was glad he got in a quick wash that morning. Who knew when the next one would be?
Comments are very welcome. I'd love to hear what people think : )
“Yeah,” Dean responded. “This whole mess is probably a dead end.”
“I like the way you taste.” He pulled down the waistband of Dean’s jeans and opened his mouth to bite at the sensitive skin he found there, sucking until the surface was wet and crimson and then scraping his teeth over the mark.
Sam’s position at that moment happened to echo Dean’s own, his long neck bent to rest his head against the itchy cushion of the headrest. Of course, it was set to the tallest setting, which Dean would have made fun of if he hadn’t already.
The angel unceremoniously dropped the plastic container he’d been inspecting, and they both pushed past what had at one point been the fresh food section. The buzzing sound of flies was the only thing Dean could hear—it was so loud it seemed to fill the store. He ignored his tightening in his gut and the niggling thought that Sam might have been right.
Dean rolled his eyes and started towards the house, ignoring the protestations of the others. But as he turned with a shrug, they started to follow.
Sam cleared his throat but poured himself another one, and Dean watched him with his signature smile on display.
“Being human ain’t all bad. Let’s see how that tolerance of yours has adjusted,” he said with a crooked grin.
“Paris, then?” he asked her.
, he thought.
“You carried me?” Dean blanched.
They all sat down to eat at the long table in the library, preferring the more comfortable chairs there to the hard, unmoving stools attached to the table in the kitchen. They hadn’t talked about it since that night—about Dean kissing Cas like he was the only thing in the whole damn universe that mattered—and he wasn’t sure Bobby and Sam would ever expect him to say anything about it, and he appreciated that. It made things easier.
“You were,” Cas sighed, “unable to stand, so I carried you to Charlie’s spare bedroom.”
Guilt pierced Dean’s stomach. Cas was in danger because of him. He could die because of him. He clenched his teeth, trying to focus on the abomination in front of him. He was moving towards her and reaching for the gun before he could stop himself.
“Roger that,” he said.
“Hello, Dean.”
“You get everything?” Dean asked, not thinking about the rye.
“Well, we did. A group of us got rid of them but they pop back up every so often. I guess people from Lawrence are the most delicious of the post-apocalyptic survivors. But the point is, I’ve seen some shit, and I’ve killed some shit, and honestly, your dream man being a dream angel isn’t really that crazy.” She leaned back in her chair with a shrug.
, he thought, as his brother shook his head and left him alone.
“Oh hell yes,” Dean said, walking over to her and grabbing one of the bottles before he could stop himself. He twisted off the cap and lifted it to his lips before seeing the look on her face.
Dean didn’t know how many days had passed, but it was another normal afternoon. Sam was moping behind a tower of books with his laptop balanced on his lap. Dean watched him from the kitchen, reading a book that was open on a stack of others, comparing it to their dad’s journal that was lying open on another stack, with the harsh blue light of the screen lighting up his face.
The male-bodied angel spoke first.
**********
Cas’ eyes moved to meet Dean’s when he heard the metal cap twisting off the bottle.
Dean’s jeans chaffed and his socks felt damp in his boots. They’d been on the road almost a week, and he couldn’t remember the last time he’d changed into clean clothes. Or ate a meal that wasn’t wrapped in plastic. On the long list of things Dean Winchester would never admit to his brother, one was that he was getting pretty friggin’ tired of processed food.
Sam hadn’t stayed, he’d gone back to the bunker in Cas’ hideous Lincoln Continental. Dean had insisted Cas needed someone there, that he should have someone around to keep an eye on him. Sam had just given his brother a look, and Dean told him exactly where he could shove that look and ignored him when he left.
“What’re you, twelve?” Dean shot at him. “What is it?”
Dean pushed everything sitting just below the surface, right at the back of his throat, all the way down and locked it away.
“Alright, so, shoot. What’re we looking at here?” Dean asked.
“Get your asses out of bed,” Bobby yelled from outside, “We need to get moving.”
**********
“Thanks,” Dean said darkly, and stuffed the envelope into his pocket. The boot was back, pressing on his chest.
Dean was looking to his uncle for something—anything—to take some of the guilt off of his shoulders. And Bobby seemed to know it, and he wasn’t going to crack.
Larry turned his head towards Sam’s voice. “You’re Henry’s grandchildren?”
Sam sighed and dropped his gun to his side, scratching his head like Bobby had just done. “The door?” he asked, confused from sleep.
Taking another long drink of water, he turned his attention back to the road, driving past the cars that had been left behind—long-empty—resolutely avoiding looking too far beyond the shoulder.
“I still have enough strength left to be useful in battle,” he said carefully. “And we have an angel blade and a reserve of holy oil, so we’ll be prepared to face whomever is waiting for us.” His hand slid up further, until the soft side of it was pressed into the bend of Dean’s hip.
“Head between those two houses and you’ll find stalls set up in the backyard,” She said, tossing him a bar of soap and a damp towel that had been drying by the fire.
He didn’t get it. How could he? He wasn’t even from this plane of existence.
He was answered with a scowl. Dean raised his eyebrows and laughed as Cas reached behind himself to try and physically fold them back into place, but it was like trying to hold down an angry cat—the more he fought against the wings, the more they rebelled. And the more flustered Cas became, the deeper the lines on his forehead furrowed. Eventually, his brows were knotted so tightly together Dean was pretty sure his face was going to get stuck that way.
**********
The sticky rice burger was freakin’ delicious, but they started rationing a little more carefully after that.
Dean shook the mostly-empty can when it was passed back to him, lifting it in a sarcastic cheers before draining the rest.
Suddenly, he was gone. Sam jumped when Cas appeared beside him, grabbing the tablet out of his hands and smashing it to the ground.
Cas smiled against his skin. “Good.”
Cas grabbed his arm to steady him, but Dean shook him off, frustrated.
Dean let go of the journal to dig his fingers into the dark, messy hair at the Back of Cas’ head. He needed to touch.
Dean started, the subject matter putting him more on edge than the guy appearing out of nowhere.
“Cas?” Dean asked.
“Nah,” Dean said, quickly turning to flash a smile into the backseat—not managing to catch blue eyes with his own, “It’s gonna be good to get home. I never thought I’d say it, but this is one road trip I’m looking forward to the end of.”
“Mornin’,” Dean greeted, full of the casual charm he’d typically throw at a stranger he needed something from. “I’ll take a,” he faltered, looking at the chalkboard menu on the wall above Cas’ head. He didn’t know what half of it was. “Uh, a coffee.”
fix him.” He stood from the bed, raising himself to his full height and squaring his shoulders.
When the Chevelle pulled past them on the rutted, paved path to park behind a unit closer to the back of the lot, Dean and Cas were sitting outside of the trailer in front of a small fire. They’d spent the rest of the day setting a tarp around the patchworked wall of the bedroom to help keep out the wetness and rain and making dinner so it would be ready when Sam and Bobby got back. They cooked pork and beans, and Dean laughed when Cas tried some and called it “lumpy sugar paste.”
“Hey, Cas,” he said, distracted as he dropped it into place on the left side of the bed. He shifted it around a little, trying to get it to sit right. Satisfied, he stood back and turned to face Cas.
Dean reached his arm into the back seat. “Cas, water.” He twisted the cap off with his teeth after Cas placed a bottle in his hand.
But a moment later, Cas hit the floor in front of him, the impact of his hard landing casting dust into Dean’s eyes.
“You aren't good, and neither is your brother.” Bobby left it at that. The old bastard was always good at just saying enough to make you feel like you needed to say more. He’d been dragging shit out of Dean his whole life, and not once had Dean appreciated it until after it was all over.
“Are those fucking
Dean, meet doghouse. Doghouse, meet Dean. Something tells me they'll work it out, though.
“I know you understand how serious this is, Dean. At least wipe down the bag first.”
“Thank you,” Cas said, looking back down at the map in his lap. “Take this turn, it will keep us off the interstate.”
,” Dean said.
Cas disappeared almost instantly, and the three hunters didn’t speak as they spread out. They moved quickly and quietly through the rows of destroyed metal boxes and cinder block frames, stepping over the dead potted plants and broken window shutters that littered their path. Their senses were on high alert, but they didn’t see anything move other than some rodents and their own shadows—the whole place was quiet.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Well, sounding like that, you can stay here and split up the supplies, Louise Armstrong.”
“Aren’t you going to change?” Sam asked him, looking through the window at the bloody mess of his shirt and jacket.
Henry was waiting for them at the top of the stairs in a room as lavishly decorated as the bar below, and he stood with his hand resting on the back of one of the same over-stuffed armchairs they’d seen downstairs. Dean scanned the room but didn’t find anything that set off any alarm bells—but he knew that could change in a second.
“I do, and thinking is making it worse.”
Dean backed up to admire their work, jumping as he backed right into the firm shape of Cas, who he didn’t notice was standing behind him. “Jesus, dude,” he muttered, as he put some distance between them. He looked over at Bobby to make sure he didn’t notice Dean’s reaction, but he was struggling with the door and not paying them any attention.
Because seriously, fuck Bobby Singer.
**********
Talking to Bobby about it was probably one of the shittiest things he’d ever had to do, all things considered. They yelled at each other, the older hunter pushed all the books off the pine desk in his anger, and Dean ignored the pull in his gut to pick them up. Bobby threatened him. Sam intervened. A glass was thrown and shattered. Whiskey dripped down the wall. People were shoved and did shoving of their own. At one point, Dean was pretty sure he was disowned. But in the end, Bobby understood, although Dean was sure he’d understood from the beginning—he just couldn’t give in easy and no one blamed him for that.
Dean slammed the music off, Zeppelin cutting out halfway through a song he hadn’t been listening to.
Cas shared what he thought they’d find in Normal, and how it might take some time to track down whatever they were looking for (if it didn’t find them first). And if it wasn’t a dead end, they had what they needed to deal with it.
“Where’s—”
“I’m sorry. I know your childhood isn’t something you enjoy reflecting on.”
Sam and Bobby were banging around in the kitchen behind them, putting away the chips, Twinkies, and canned food they’d gathered. Cas turned to Dean and narrowed his eyes.
“Without hesitation, yes.”
Cas leaned back and put his hand on his shoulder, over the handprint he knew was still branded into Dean’s skin. “The Word of Dean Winchester,” he said with a small smile.
we talkin’ about here, Cas?”
Cas wrapped a hand around Dean’s thigh, the one thrown over his shoulder, as he opened Dean up. Dean wasn’t sure how much further his spine could bend but he couldn’t remember another time he felt this fucking good, this unhinged.
After cleaning up and taking a few stabilizing breaths he reached for his silver flask, but his coat pocket was empty. His first clear thought was the memory of tossing it to Cas.
But his face lit up when he remembered what they’d found the day before.
“I used a binding spell to tie Dean to this house—a protection spell. It was meant to keep Dean and his family, and this home, safe.”
“Your little,” Dean circled his own face with a finger, “looks.”
Bile bubbled in Dean’s gut as Cas’ hand lifted to weakly cover his own and his head rolled back against Dean’s shoulder.
“No, I mean yeah. But I’ve been human for like, ever. I’m used to it.” He breezed past the confused look on Charlie’s face. “But I’ve never been, you know.”
Dean adjusted his position in his seat. “I’ve never— with someone—” He was already losing what little steam he’d started this conversation with. “Are you going to make me say this?”
Turiel grabbed her arm. “
“Nothin’,” Dean tossed back, going for casual but sounding defensive.
“Yes.”
“Cas, fuck, oh my god…”
“Uh,” Sam started, “we’re still figuring that out.”
It wasn’t dark yet, but it was getting there. Although they were all tired, it was still too early to sleep and Dean knew the rest of them were as eager as he was to get this shit over with. So, they’d keep moving.
“Be right there!” His voice was rough. He grabbed a bottle of whiskey and slammed the trunk shut, walking towards Bobby’s flashlight without a glance in Cas’ direction.
Before Cas handed it back, he looked at the round, engraved flask with a small line between his brows.
“If you don’t, you’ll lose him.”
“Looking for work? One of our outposts in Falls City is dealing with a nasty nest of ghouls and could use some backup.”
, Samuel and Dean Winchester.”
His brother was holding another cup of coffee, the steam rising from the speckled, tin camping cup he used every morning. Dean usually made fun of how ridiculous his giant fingers looked looped through the tiny handle, but he let it drop this time.
“This manifestation of my wings are more communicative than I would prefer them to be. They’ve been reacting to you, calling for you in ways my vessel does not.”
Dean blinked at the empty seat behind him and tried to ignore the spike of panic that cut through him at the sight. Cas would be back or he wouldn’t. He had to stop hanging every last shred of hope he had on the angel. Hell, he didn’t even know if Cas wasn’t on their side anymore. Team Free Will had officially been disbanded when two of them had been left for dead.
Dean was surprised when Bobby started to laugh. It started as a surprised chuckle but grew into one of those full-body laughs that Dean barely remembered ever having.
Sensing his discomfort, Cas leaned back to undo Dean’s jeans, slowly pulling the zipper down and tugging them over his hips. Dean watched him with wide eyes. He could barely believe this was actually happening. He was ruined.
He didn’t get to finish, cut off by the telltale rustle of wings.
**********
“Well wasn’t that somethin’,” Bobby finally said, sitting heavily in his wooden chair and turning on a desk lamp.
Cas looked at Dean, and Dean definitely hated the concern on his face more than the throat lump. “Whether Dean leaves, or we destroy the structure,” Cas turned to address the room, “It won’t be an easy transition for him.”
**********
“I really am.” She gave him a sarcastic pat on the shoulder and dragged her chair over so she could sit beside him.
“Take the smaller room, it’s warmer,” Dean said, watching Bobby’s bent figure disappear and close the door.
“Gonna, uh, gonna go get dressed,” he muttered. He tore out of the library without looking either of them in the eye and legged it back to his room.
“I remember falling for my best friend,” Charlie said. “She was gorgeous. Tall. Brunette.” She put her fingertips to her lips and kissed them, like a caricature of an Italian chef. “I never had the guts to tell her,” she shrugged. “It blows, but it was a big lesson, considering she’s probably dead at this point. God, such a trope,” she deflected, with the same forced humour she’d used when she talked about her parents.
Turiel watched the interaction and slowly did the same to Afriel, like he wasn’t sure why he was doing it, but he thought he should.
When he was close enough, he grabbed Cas’ hand and laced their fingers together. He glanced down at where they were connected, lacking the courage to look at the angel as he tried to get out what he needed to say.
“We can worry about this later,” Dean said as he pushed Bobby out of the trailer.
As Sam and Cas finally told Bobby about the bonding spell that was swallowing him whole, the bubble in Dean’s chest burst, leaving him with a hole he didn’t know if he could ever fill.
“So, what? We go in there guns blazing?” Dean asked no one in particular.
“Hello, Dean.” He made a small, happy noise and wrapped his arms around Dean.
He slumped into the chair Bobby had been sitting in the night before and drank more of his coffee, trying to level out.
He’d looked up depictions of angelic true forms, and the thought of Cas having 18 eyes and the body of a lion, or whatever the hell he’d seen, wasn’t something that even registered. When he thought of Cas, all he ever saw was the face he knew, all stubbled and cleft-chinned and serious. Unassuming and curious until he channelled that power and became all-knowing and vast and overwhelming. The idea of that side of him shrinking away into nothing was… well, it was fucking scary. And Dean didn’t know how to help him. Maybe that’s why he’d—
, Dean thought,
Sam turned his head at the sound coming from the small speaker. “What’s the occasion?” he asked. His cup was green, and in the light of the fire, the colour reflected on his face and made him look sallow.
“Yes, Rowena found a spell that will reverse the curse. It won’t be a quick process or an easy one. But it’s possible.”
As he moved away, pulling his arm slowly from beneath the sleeping man, Cas started to stir. Suddenly, blue eyes were looking into his own.
“We need to trust each other. If we can’t, we’re not family.”
“Nightcap?” Dean asked, grabbing the bottle that had been hovering in the back of his mind for the last couple of hours.
Cas’ face darkened but he didn’t say anything. Dean fought back a smile as Cas marched over to him and wrapped his arm back around Dean’s waist.
Thank you again, to my lovely Beta Tardimaid for helping me make sense of smut and the English language.
role.” Another ugly bark of laughter pushed its way out of his mouth. “All of a sudden this is your responsibility, huh? You should have stayed upstairs with those flying ass-monkeys and left me and Sammy to figure this shit out for ourselves. It’s what we do,” Dean said, trying to hide his desperation by putting his hands on Cas’ chest and pushing him away. The angel barely moved, and Dean suspected the few inches he did lean back was just another example of Cas’ misplaced selflessness, another instance of the angel making some bizarre sacrifice for him.
“I got it, Sam,” Dean snapped, cranking the volume back up. He had a foul taste in his mouth. Reaching behind his brother, Dean grabbed the bottle of Dickel Rye he’d stored in the back seat, pushing his knees up to hold the steering wheel on-course while he struggled to get the green plastic off the cap.
“Bobby filled me in on what happened,” he said, and when Dean looked up at him from the growing fire, he saw his brother’s face was pinched in all the wrong places. It was a bad sign.
He almost dropped the can of food when he saw what the blanket had been hiding. Sam’s mouth was covered in blood, and the entire side of his face, the side that was lying against the stained pillow, was coated in it, practically stuck to the fabric that was sticky with what Sam had coughed up.
“What? No way, you’re from Lawrence? Why don’t I know you?” Charlie asked, wiping whiskey off her chin.
Dean flicked his eyes towards his brother.
The gun hit the table between them with a thud. “What’re you looking for here? No voices. No visions. All good.”
“Cas, I’m gonna—”
They got up, eventually, climbing out of bed stiff and slow. They showered, using different stalls so they wouldn’t get distracted and lose the whole morning. They dressed in their separate rooms and made coffee—or Dean did, while Cas sat at the table with his chin rested in his hand—and walked together to the library to meet up with the other two hunters.
“You good?” he asked as he looked at Dean’s drawn, pale face.
Dean covered his eyes and gripped his ribs, curling into the wall he was leaned against.
It was cold, but Dean didn’t feel it as he followed Cas outside. Heavy, slushy snow was falling from the sky, leaving soft splatters on the dark asphalt. If Cas knew Dean was there, he didn’t acknowledge him. He tossed the grinds into the compost bin, but didn’t turn around even after the lid slammed shut.
“What if we never get another night like this one?” Cas’ voice dropped. “If something happens and I can’t help you—” Instead of finishing his thought, he stepped closer to Dean and rested his hands on either side of Dean’s ribcage.
His voice had a cold finality to it that Dean could feel in the pit of his stomach. Cas turned and walked slowly back to his room, leaving the door open behind him.
He brought his right knee up to this chest and loosened the laces on the first boot, then stretched out and wedged it off with his left foot.
As Abaddon’s head rolled away and off to the side, Cas picked her body up by the neck of her leather jacket and sliced off her hands, arms, feet, and legs into pieces like they were lighter than paper before letting her torso fall to the ground. He was covered in red, deep red sprays of blood that stained his jacket and speckled his face.
Cas’ eyes flew to his, wide with panic, and he tightened his hold on the tablet. “I don’t think— Dean, we can’t.”
Cas was looking at him with hazy eyes, and for just a second—hardly any time at all—Dean’s gaze flicked down to his mouth before lifting back up to safer territory. Cas’ face softened, but there was something else edging into his expression, something bordering on overwhelmed.
**********
“You know, the things I heard about him, I thought he’d be meaner,” Afriel said, scratching at the tight scar tissue that ran up her neck.
“What’ll happen to him?” Sam asked, slumped over in his corner of the couch.
Dean met Sam’s eyes. This had been their fight, something that had torn them apart and to pieces a hundred times over. If Sam was up for it, so was Dean.
“Not helping,” he groaned into Cas’ ribs.
Red-rimmed and blurry, there wasn’t a single clear eye in the trailer the next morning. Dean and Bobby sat in the living room of the trailer sipping water and weak coffee. Sam’s cough was bad, violent and hacking. Dean had gone to check on him when he woke up, and he could barely find his brother under the pile of ratty blankets on the bed.
“You said it yourself, Dean. This is about survival. In the last twenty-four hours we’ve been attacked. You almost died. We drove past starving, helpless people covered in burns. You’ve built barriers around Bobby’s property.” Dean could hear Cas shifting in his seat, and reached for the Zippo he kept in his jacket pocket to light the small tea candle they kept outside.
“Har har,” Bobby said, humourlessly. “I figure our best bet is—”
“Then Cas finds it,” Sam agreed with a tired shrug. “What do we do next?”
Dean snickered, grabbing a rag out of the bucket of sterilized water they kept beside the small fire pit. He rang it out and tossed it to Bobby, who scrubbed his face pink while he muttered profanities Dean couldn’t make out.
Sam had dug through Bobby’s supplies and the bunker storerooms to collect most of the ingredients he’d been using for the wasted spells, but Dean was only half paying attention to what was going on. He chimed in when necessary, but spent his time cleaning and loading the Colt. It wasn’t a weapon they used often, in fact, they tried not to use the thing at all, but he figured it might come in useful during whatever fight they had to shoot their way through next. And it would definitely take down two low-level angels if things went bad.
“I’m Sam.” Dean noticed he left it there. “This is my brother Dean and our uncle Bobby. And our friend Cas. But uh, we’re not members. We’re Legacies.”
Before Dean or Sam could get to her, she whispered something under her breath and Cas was surrounded by the dark, thickening smoke of a curse. Dean raced to reach her before she could finish the spell and managed to put her down with a blade that slipped easily between her ribs. He felt something like regret as he did it, but there wasn’t any time to worry about her when he heard Cas cry out and hit the floor the same time her body did.
Cas was already working his way down his chest, sucking on Dean’s skin until it was wet and crimson and then dragging his tongue over the bruised flesh. Dean dropped a hand to cup his straining dick through his jeans, to find some relief, but Cas grabbed his wrist and pinned it to the bed.
The hunters waited for Turiel to get to his point, and shifted where they stood, Sam still holding his gun pointed at the strangers, Bobby with his arms hanging at his side, and Dean with both hands on his hips and an annoyed look on his face. Cas stood to the right of Dean, his fist still clenched around the handle of his blade.
“Afriel and Turiel are gone.” He nipped at Dean’s neck.
“Someone’s gotta do the dirty work,” she said, grabbing the kettle for a refill.
He could barely do anything more than nod, but his mouth had fallen open and he managed some shaky sounds of confirmation as Cas was once again on top of him, stroking his face with his thumb.
Dean was getting irritated, and from the looks on Sam and Bobby’s faces, they were in the same boat. It was cold outside and Dean wanted things to get moving—either they were fighting, or they were leaving, and waiting to see which one it would be was putting him on edge.
Dean led Cas back to the porch where two faded, filthy lawn chairs waited for them. Most of the straps were broken on one, which is where Dean sat carefully as he pulled the gun out of his waistband and put it on the little plastic table between the chairs. Cas took the other seat, shuffling as he arranged his coat beneath him.
In another place entirely, a man in a blue suit stood amongst the carnage of the men he called brothers. His hands stuck to the wooden box he held, the blood coating it drying thick and dark.
The last thing he felt before passing out was two warm fingers on the side of his face.
Dean broke away to get some air, and as he did, Cas found his way down to his favourite spot buried in Dean’s neck, pressing biting kisses across his skin.
Henry laughed. “You’re quite the straight-shooter.”
Cas sat down with a resigned huff and ordered a drink. But before he could take more than a sip, a man in a blue suit walked over to stand behind them. He was the first person, other than the bartender, to acknowledge they were even there.
Dean’s coffee was sitting beside his computer, still steaming. He lifted the cup, smelling it first—yep, definitely coffee—before lifting it slowly to his lips.
The idea of seeing his brother or uncle wasn’t something he was exactly looking forward to, but he’d have to face the day eventually. Gathering his shit up and slowly getting dressed, he left the room still buttoning his jeans and shoving on his boots.
Dean poured the rest of his beer in his mouth and put his second bottle beside the first, wishing he’d grabbed a third. Or the rye that was in the cupboard. He wiped his hands together to rid them of the sticky residue from the peeled label and nodded. “Yeah, good idea.”
“Dean?”
Dean had never gone into any of the tent cities they saw from the highway, but he wondered if they were all as well-organized.
“Yeah, Sam. Just grabbing a beer.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The house was the same as the last time Cas had been there—dark, cool, and filled with a lifetime of hunting supplies and memories. As they put away groceries, Dean realized he’d only been there a few times, mostly confined to the kitchen, and, for a time, the panic room where they helped Sam break the pull of his addiction to demon blood. Not all the memories in this house were good ones. There was a layer of grief that coated everything in it, like the ash that suffocated the world outside.
“Why not?”
“You can eat it,” Afriel said, still scratching, just now at her hair under the beret. “It’s not poison.”
Sam and Dean had made it back to Sioux Falls through all of the confusion and carnage, somehow. Dean could barely remember it. But when the Impala pulled into Bobby’s salvage yard, he pulled his brother towards him into a hug, gripping the back of his worn, canvas jacket.
“So, we’re heading east to I-20?” he asked, looking at the map Sam had given him one more time. Bobby had brought the Chevelle around to park beside the Impala, and after brushing the worst of the leaves and dust off the cars, they were almost ready to go.
“Don’t,” is all he said, his lips hovering over Dean’s nipple.
“I think it’s more than a cold,” Bobby said roughly, with authority Dean didn’t want to hear.
Dean looked at him incredulously. “
Afriel laughed. “Of course it was, dummy.”
“So we’re all in,” Dean said to the angels, forcing a smile. “What’s next?”
The other angel slapped the hand away from the wound. “That’s disgusting, Afriel. Stop picking at your vessel and focus.” Afriel stood, looking for something to do with the vessel’s small, female hands, but didn’t understand the concept of pocket stuffing or nail picking for distraction. So, she just turned without knowing what to do until settling back at the window.
**********
“I just—one second,” Dean said, reaching down to pull his shirt over his head. At the sight, Cas’ mouth, shiny with Dean’s spit and the oil from his skin, fell open.
“My grace is at full power, yes.”
Cas squeezed his fingers and lifted his other hand to cup Dean’s face, gently turning it towards his own. The touch melted the tension in Dean’s jaw, and his lips parted as he leaned into Cas’ warm palm. Cas didn’t move, waiting for permission, and as those blue eyes burned into his own, Dean gave a small nod, almost imperceptible, and leaned in to close the distance between them.
“Oh, an intuitive lover,” Charlie said, leaning forward to rest her chin on her hand. “The best kind.”
“Uh, yeah,” Dean said, uncomfortable discussing family at the best of times, let alone in a weird kitchen with some old stranger.
Cas’ eyes were wide at Dean’s sudden proximity. “You’re drunk,” he said.
He frowned, trying to flatten it as he sat down beside Dean, who grabbed him around his shoulders and messed it up again. “I like it messy,” he said, pressing a fruit-sticky kiss to Cas’ temple.
“What is?”
“The tripwire,” he yelled over the noise, shotgun already in hand.
“Yeah, I’ve had a couple of
Dean dropped his arms to his sides, feeling uncomfortable without anything to busy his hands. He needed something to hold, something to drink. He didn’t know how to make Cas see that what he was doing wasn’t right—they’d lost. There was nothing left here for him.
“John’s father was part of a group called the Men of Letters. In 1958, they were killed by a group of demons who were after what we’re after now,” Turiel explained as Afriel shredded napkins from the rusted dispenser. “The tablet is one of many, but this particular tablet, the demon tablet, is one that can help us force Lucifer and his army out of Heaven. We can use it to seal Him back away in Hell.”
Dean felt sunken in as they left the building, like someone was standing on his chest. Him and Sam, responsible for saving the world
“Read you Charlie, this is Dean.” He tried to sound casual even as he frantically waved the others over to join him.
Turiel laughed, although it was a breathy wheeze more than an actual laugh. “You’ll help us because when the war is over we’ll be able to help you. Michael wasn’t the one who started… all of this,” he said, gesturing to the room and the world around them. “That was all Lucifer. Michael doesn’t care about this pathetic little planet, but he does care about defeating his brother so that he can claim our Father’s throne.”
***********
Dean tensed, flexing his left shoulder like a nervous tick. “When did this guy start talkin’ so much, huh?” he interrupted. He took a step back and lifted the bottle to his lips. “Don’t think so, pal,” he grimaced before taking a drink.
Well, they wouldn’t have any luck in that dump. Her people had already been through it and it was totally empty.
“Yeah?” Dean said with a small laugh. He used the end of the blade he had in his pocket to open his beer and looked over at Cas’, even though he could barely make him out in the dark.
“You acted inappropriately. You put us on display in front of Charlie and your brother and Bobby.”
Dean tried to hide his anxiety with a little Winchester charm. “What, you don’t wanna bunk with your big brother, Sammy?”
He wasn’t sure why Cas had done what he did, or why he’d gone with it—but Dean wouldn’t let it happen again.
“I won’t tell you again, heal your vessel properly,” Turiel snapped.
He couldn’t ask if anyone had seen them. If he didn’t know, he could pretend they hadn’t.
“There’s nothing we can do to help them,” was the official response. “We don’t have the manpower.”
did this. Your fucking brothers did this. So
Cas looked at him quizzically but waited for him to continue.
Cas laughed quietly. “I assure you, Dean, that isn’t my intention.”
“I’m sorry,” Dean said, talking more to the puddle than to the man who’d practically raised him.
“Look, I know you’re all over the place right now. Just worry about yourself. I’m fine, Cas, always am.”
**********
“I might have to shake your hand more often,” Dean said, burying his nose in messy hair. “Looks like that really works for you.”
