Oh, no, no, no. Tony has no time for this.

“And you want me to believe you have no way of tracking Rogers? Through his shield, or his suit?” Ross raises his eyebrows, unimpressed.
(You would’ve given me the benefit of doubt.)
“Aren’t you wondering too? I mean, I had no problem with it, they seemed like they liked each other a lot – but I wasn’t expecting it, y’know? Caught me off guard. I guess this just sounds like it makes sense.”
Club A. Even if most people thought he wouldn’t, for some reason.
Tony doesn’t think he has ever seen him look like this the entire time they’ve known each other.
None of the people screaming are actually Barton or Tony. Rocket yells in indignation, Ross yells in vain attempts to install order in the group, Rhodey yells at Barton to step back, Natasha yells at Barton to calm down. Bruce begs Tony to walk away, looking a little green around the gills, and Nebula orders him the same, though she does not look back to tell him so, her eyes locked onto Barton like predator to prey.
It seems like Steve broke through whatever walls Sam had with this admission, because suddenly, Sam can’t stop talking. His mind is running at the speed of light right before his eyes, connecting dots and analyzing memories, trying to make sense of it all through the shock the news have stricken on him. “So Stark lost his mind, and that’s why you fought?”.
“Tony.” Bruce comments one morning, over a mug of tea and the
“We should probably check in with the SHIELD personnel too.” Natasha reminds them, and before anyone can give any signs of confirmation, she’s on her feet and walking to the door with calm, but determined strides, a plan already set in motion. “We can all come back in a few hours to check-in”
to them, they are all watching him approach the same way one watches a very rare, easily spooked animal, with fascination and careful movements, and Tony, in some other life, might have felt insulted.
Rhodey scoffs, in a soft, but totally unimpressed way, and lets out a humorless laugh and cocks his hip to the side, in an almost arrogant stance. “Well, you better find a simple way to explain it, because I don’t like the way this is going, Tony.”
, Steve can see his eyes, and the moment feels like an accomplishment, even as Tony shrilly says, with his eyes wide and gleaming in surprise:

mess.
“And as a King… My reasons are not nearly as simple as my actions as the Black Panther.” He pauses, because his words sound so heavy Steve can imagine how he feels them on his tongue, the same way they all do when they talk about it, unable to ignore.  “Right and wrong are rarely so easy to define, Agent Romanov. I cannot blame you for acting as you think it’s right. I can only hope you don’t regret the choice you make.”
Now or nothing.
“Can you calm down for a second, it’s not a big deal.” Rhodey says unimpressed.

And Steve, who had writhed in silence over another lost chance, who had realized that this is what his life would always be like, his curse, to watch the people he cares about to be taken away by the shortcomings of his decisions, by his failures; He had dared to hope again.
Why was it so hard for them to connect? Are they just... too different to function as a unit? Are they really just a time bomb, one that has finally exploded and can never be assembled together again? All the time they spent together— had it been just borrowed time? Were they just… fated to failure?
“I had to stop him. I knew Tony wouldn’t. He was furious, he wasn’t thinking clearly, and he wouldn’t stop unless I made him.”
Not now.

I mean, what kind of argument does he have against that?
He cracked the helmet open.
He’s with Natasha on the living room next to the kitchen, Thor absent today in a visit to his girlfriend, when Tony walks in, and Steve realizes this is the first time he’s seeing Tony in almost two weeks. And they live in the same building.
“So he was trying to kill you.” Sam concludes, adjusting his stance to make himself seem wider, voice sounding angry.
Steve had asked what Tony would get out of their arrangement, but truth is,
And oh, if she found this situation absurd – now, she was positively shocked. Verging on offended, really.

Tony hates that deep down, somewhere beneath the jumble of twisted feelings swirling in his core, the nauseating mixture of dread and sorrow, the rancid taste of blood and tears that seem to stain his tongue, he still has time to feel a twinge of too familiar sympathy for Nebula’s shy admittance, like he’s making this about
As bad as they might’ve been to their families once, no matter how they wronged them – they all are willing to do anything for another chance.
They’re not co-captains – or captain and reluctant right hand – anymore, so there’s really no need to conspire in secrecy like this. But old habits are really hard to break, it seems – and, well, if anyone is going to argue with Rogers, it’s gonna be Tony, so it makes sense that Rogers is talking to him. But he doesn’t have to. It makes no difference at this point.

“Following the trail of her powers is not something anyone could do, Captain, so I wouldn’t worry about it being a risk. The only reason why it was possible for me is because of the nature of my constitution, and the help of Mr. Stark.”
“We are a most likely target.” Rhodey says, somber. “Even if they had the Stone for centuries, they weren’t using it – or at least they say they weren’t. But since the Avengers were created we got, what? Contact with three Stones in the span of a couple of years? Three out of six? And we’ve actually defended some of them against enemies? It would make sense to warn us.”
Wong looks between them with dark, mysterious eyes, his face pinched in what almost looks like displeasure, long, deep worrying lines on his forehead, a slight scrunch of his lips, and Tony is very close to opening his mouth and lashing out something less than amicable at him; He’s stressed, he’s anxious, and Wong’s attitude, while understandable in a more sensible situation, is pressing Tony’s buttons in the wrong way, and he has no

“No.” Pepper sobs. “I don’t know where he is. I can’t reach him. He just—”
He wipes the sweat on his forehead roughly, pulling at the skin with far more force than necessary, his hand trembling slightly from what Tony can see, even from far away. If he hadn’t known better, Tony would almost say he looks like he’s going through some sort of withdrawal, his body shivering from the need of a hit of whatever it decided it can’t live without, but no; This is stress, this is adrenaline pumping him full of a rush he has no outlet for, maybe even some rage, boiling inside him like a cauldron, spilling and overflowing with agitation burning hot, but never hot enough to dissipate the cold.
And consequences often come with hard choices to be made. The worst and the best dilemmas rely on choices. The crux of every superhero story is always the same: do you sacrifice yourself to save others, or no? Do you move, or do you stay still and watch it happen? Mind you, I'm not complaining about this - in fact, this is how hero stories start. By choosing to move, when all others freeze. But when you're already a hero, it's not really a matter of if, is it? It's not if you save the world. You're going to. The problem is... how?
Tony twists a little to take a better look at Nebula, and something sharp stings him from the inside, and he wobbles in place. He takes in a hard, difficult breath, his body still not fully his own, and Nebula takes this as a sign she must push him forward and guide him inside with slow and soft steps, their shoes making muffled sounds against the cold floor, the vast emptiness of the hallways making them echo into nothingness.
tone, that makes Tony’s chest seize with a terrible dread, a sense of urgency that something bad is coming, that the words that will follow won’t be anything but painful. “They need you upstairs.”
They stare at him, aghast, all eyes dropping to the glowing shine of the reactor in his chest, resting easy over his heart, as if to protect it.
Please, no, Steve wants to say.
“Ships don’t create wormholes, they require too much energy. And they’re dangerous. But there are plenty of points in the universe where passages open and let us move from one gate to another faster if you push through them with the right amount of energy.”
“Alright, this is painful to watch.” Rhodey intervenes, loudly and suddenly, and Tony’s head snaps up fast enough that he catches the others doing the exact same thing, stunned into silence at the face of the forceful authority in his voice. “Here’s how things should go. We’re gonna leave calls and rescue to the agents – I’ll organize a plan of action that’s gonna hold up at least a little longer without us, and we’re gonna focus

After two years of absolutely no contact, seeing Captain America, Black Widow, Ant-Man, Hawkeye — These people have very publicly and very loudly rejected the pleas of the nation for transparency and accountability. That’s how the headlines were written after Leipzig, how people screamed their questions at Tony’s face every time he stepped out of the house for the first six months.
They don’t know.
Tony hadn’t realized how long it has been since he last saw it until now. It’s not like he needed it, personally. The armor can take him anywhere he wanted to go, the same thing for Rhodey, and Vision could just fly. Pete never went anywhere beyond the borders of the state – not unless he was sneaking out during school trips –, so what use would Tony have for a jet?

And for once, Tony does not feel any impulse to laugh or scorn or doubt his statement.
“You are welcome to stay if you like, Captain.” T’Challa offers him, his tone incredibly gentle, but in a way that makes Steve feel respected, not coddled. He feels like T’Challa is giving him an opening he doesn’t usually offers people, and Steve appreciates the king’s help. It certainly is very noble of him. “We will be completely responsible for James Barnes’ security and health, as I promised. There is no need for you to worry.”

“I can’t. It would cost a fortune.” Steve retreats.

Things he wouldn’t have told anyone else. Tony knows.

He’ll risk it again.
When Steve nods for her to continue, her anxiety seems to grow a little, and she starts picking at her nails in a nervous habit, a tick she had long before this, something Steve had seen her do when they still lived at the Compound. If she had a necklace on, she’d probably be fiddling with it too. “
“Wanda didn’t get to Tony either.” Steve mentions, but at this point, is just to show Clint he’s listening, and not to actually refute what he’s saying.
that’s why they’re awful, because you have to pry them open every time, it sucks the entire fuel of the ship if you’re not careful.” Rocket grumbles, dismayed.
“Speak for yourself, I got them out of the planet!”
(His home is dead.)
Rhodey, Pepper, Natasha, and Rogers, all of them are standing up and stiff in their places, and Tony almost panics before they notice him and Bruce on the doorway, immediately jumping to the worst possible conclusions, when he realizes they aren’t scared, they’re

“Not judging.” Sam reassures softly. “I won’t say a word until you finish. Just talk, alright? Put that shit out of your chest and explain it to me.”
The man is not shocked about his inquiry—he doesn’t find odd Jarvis does not believe it was an accident. In fact, it seems like he is expecting it.
“Okay.” Tony says loudly after a beat passes, and—

They’re desperate, they’re reaching for answers where there aren’t any at this point – and Tony wants to tell Thor that, as kindly as he can, but both kindness and words fail him right now, locked away inside him beneath all the nerves and grief, negative triggers so close to snapping that the urge to block the even simplest consideration that this
“No one is going to steal it.” Nebula shrugs, and she looks at Tony as if she’s daring him to contradict her, smug.
Completely at lost, Tony turns to Pepper – and Pepper’s gaze is steely, hard, unyielding stone, her teeth shut together in a false composure,
No, no, that’s not it. For fucks sake, Tony, Steve is trying to understand. He is, ok? He can’t quite make it there yet, but he’s trying. He doesn’t want to just accept they are over. He won’t.

Steve thinks he can hear Sam curse from somewhere behind him, but he isn’t sure.
Rhodey throws him an analyzing look. Something ripples beneath the surface of his gaze, something sharp and strict, but neither of them give out any clues of what it might be. Rogers nods, the same way Tony’s seen Rhodey’s subordinates nod at him after receiving orders, and he wonders, if only for a second, what could have possibly prompted this interaction when he has never before seen Rogers submit to Rhodey’s position in

That includes emergencies, if you need evacuation or an extra hand. Just let me know, and I’ll provide help as soon as possible.”
He doesn’t know what he’s missing from them. All he knows is that he

You are all about to witness in detail one of my favorite parts of writing stories like this, from just one character's POV, unreliable narrator-style: interpretation of intention. To those of you who have read Part I, who have seen the long, agonizing journey I had Steve and his team go through, and all the emotional revelations that came with it - to you, the return of the Rogue Avengers is going to be... an interesting addition. Especially through Tony's eyes. I wonder if I made Steve go deep enough under your skin so you'd be able to recognize what is truly happening in this chapter, past Tony's personal vision of them. I sure am excited to try! What fun would it be if I didn't add another layer of difficulty in this already messed up situation? No fun at all.

Tony’s stomach does a flip, and just for now, he pretends it’s from hunger.
, but they have to choose.
Some days, even the sound of the coffee machine beep gets on Tony’s nerves, he can’t imagine what a guy like Steve must go through.
It sounds like things are finally getting better. Like they are finally starting to heal.
The reaction is immediate— and at the back of his head, Steve hears a sound similar to a explosion, loud and brash, like a
The silence stretches, only low crinkles of plastic and the muffled sound of traffic and – there it is,

It’s in the form of a flask. A tiny one. Mr. Jarvis takes it off from the inner pocket of his jacket, fingers delicate around the glass, and she reaches for it even though she feels something inside her tremble with a phantom sensation, so quiet she can’t even be sure it was real. Something shuddering. Something grieving.

“Follow me.” Wong says, curt and direct, and with less than a second for them to process his sudden change of heart, he gives a quick nod and turns around, walking into the Sanctum before making sure any of them is following.
He doesn’t care.
Thunder roars above them suddenly, loud and angry, and if Tony were religious in any way, he might have believed something in the skies was actually trying to warn them something. Maybe that there really is some judgment happening here, maybe that – maybe their chaos reaches so far and wide the universe itself can feel it, and its weeping, its crying because it also doesn’t know how to deal with it, how to cope with how beyond any sort of salvation they are.

Whatever those beings might be, and where they might come from, he doesn’t say. Maybe it’s just one of those things they aren’t meant to know. Something beyond the lines Wong is willing to cross for them at this moment. They can at least appreciate his help for what it is, right now, and hope that whatever Wong is concerned about is truly just a paranoid concern, not an actual threat – and if it is… Well, Tony can only hope he will contact them and ask for help if the need arises. They might be drowning in problems already – they are,

We're almost done with Pepper, my friends. I told you it wouldn't be easy. But it is necessary, because this issue has dragged on for far too long, and although there's a universe out there where they might've been able to surpass this in a softer, kinder way, this isn't that universe. Sometimes, it hurts. I'm not afraid of showing that, because if we're dealing with truth, then we have to face it all. My world is not very kind, I'm afraid.

He knows Rogers must have mentioned Thanos, because Lang said so, but how can people understand that, being blinded by grief and fear, after two days of hiding around in rubble and death-filled streets, trembling in fear that another purge might come at any second and no one had any way of knowing that it wouldn’t?

“Nothing.” Tony says. “I can’t do anything more to him than what I’ve already done.”
He takes in a deep, deep breath, throat convulsing in a garbled, wet movement that makes him feel gross, humiliated and shamed, when he realizes these are the tears his body is so insistently trying to produce, but still fails in doing so. Like his body doesn’t have the energy to finish the task and fully let him break down. He

And there’s something in his gaze Tony cannot decipher, not in his precarious state of mind, but something that is not, with all certainty, the aggression and disapproval Tony had expected from him.

Steve has no problem with Vision’s presence. Not at all. In fact, he is kind of glad he is here, because that means Wanda is happy, that means that they might not be as broken as Steve fears they are, and he takes this as a small comfort in his already too beaten up heart.

The guy clearly must be good, because Ross let him into some important business with little to no fuss, which is

Tony blinks, confused. “Why would I?”

(What hope is there for this team?)
Steve mutters an affirmative and shuts the phone off before Bruce can say anything else, standing up and heading directly to their belongings, ignoring everything else concerning their previous mission.
(Like falling asleep.)
When he’s like this, he likes to caress her hair. In his daily life, Tony’s touches are reserved for metal and iron, for electricity and tools hard-edged and cold, precise and sometimes lethal; In contrast, the touch of her hair is soft like a cloud, delicate and pretty, so incredibly comforting to run fingers through and massage the scalp. Tony had always loved to cup her waist or her nape, to give a soothing squeeze into her skin, hoping he can say, without any words, that he’s there for her. To give her warmth. He has always preferred to give her affection in less than direct ways. In hidden gestures, in small actions – because when he does something purposefully visible, he tends not to know when to stop. The giant bunny incident still makes him embarrassed sometimes. So this – this moment… it feels like home.
“And Barnes.” Tony amends, despite himself, arms crossing in front of him almost immediately as the words leave his lips. He doesn’t know why, but he feels very
“Why was it in chains?” Barton, echoing Tony’s thoughts, inquires, as Rogers passes him and Natasha the book, so they can inspect it on their own instead of looking over his shoulder. “It this some kind of forbidden book or something?”
“Carter.” Tony says, a breathless exhale of surprise escaping his lips. “Right? Sharon. Agent 13.”
Steve’s entire body freezes.
He doesn’t have much time to appreciate it, no, because his mind and his highly alert and paranoid instincts won’t let him. He wraps Bucky’s arm around his shoulders and carries most of his weight all journey, extremely conscious of his presence, his weight, his breathing pattern. It’s ragged, painful, but its

“It wasn’t his fault!” He snarls in her face, his hands trembling at his sides.
"I'm sorry." Tony chokes, gulping forcefully to try and push down the odd feeling of swelling he feels inside his mouth, the strength with which the

“With our resources and FRIDAY they should be able to work on something while you all are out there.” Pepper amends.
He considers it sometimes. Obie is just like him, an ambitious, restless man, and he has resources and connections that could be helpful to Howard. And great minds think alike, he reasons; Obie wouldn’t give him unnecessary problems with questions about the ethics of his project as some others would, he’d just get Howard whatever he asked for and the whole thing could advance a lot faster, with two heads thinking instead of one.
Whenever he wasn’t losing himself to the fight, the uneasiness, the pure, almost instinctual drive to keep himself working to stop his own dark thoughts, he was walking around like a ghost, visiting museums and memorials, staring at name plaques for so long his vision would get blurry. He would think about his friends growing old and dying, about Peggy moving on and having an entire life without him there, not even to cheer her on, and he would

“Yeah, and even still you didn’t think something was off about this.” Clint huffs, amused. “I’m just saying that you might not be considering some important details in there, Cap. Maybe ‘cause you’re not really seeing them.”

, he can’t deny that, in many ways, he has one – Rhodey and Pepper, no matter what their relationship is now, Tony always knew he could count on them. Happy too, he thinks with immeasurable grief. Even in his childhood, long before any of them had come into his life, despite how

The remorse in her face is so raw and real that Steve’s heart aches to give her some sort of comfort, but he doesn’t know how. He cannot lie to her and say it’s ok, because she knows full well it’s not.
“I don’t know.” Lang shakes his head robotically, his gaze lost. “Maybe? I don’t know. I honestly don’t know what to think.”

An entire world of unspoken feelings in a simple word.
None of this is Tony’s usual playfield; after all, aircraft has always been much more up Rhodey’s alley than Tony’s – and
shocked when Rogers just fucking slams his fist on the button to open the cabin door, the Jet’s hydraulic system hissing and wringing, a gust of cold wind slamming in their faces like a punch, and the reflex of pushing away and closing their eyes is too strong to stop, making it impossible for them to react fast enough.
” Natasha accuses loudly. “You knew about Barnes and you didn’t tell him!”
, the pain blooming in his chest and bleeding towards the limb, like motor oil leaking through the tubes, and he holds it with his other hand, grip painfully tight, until his fingers turn pale.
Steve had been so concerned for Tony’s heart. He couldn’t stop thinking about it. The sound of his shield crashing into the glass casing of Tony’s Reactor haunted his dreams more and more often as days went by, louder and louder as the world around Steve started to get quieter with each and every goodbye he had been forced to utter, becoming so empty and so sour he feels like he is being

It’s surprisingly chaste.

, at the end of the day, Tony’s inability to step down that causes her to leave every single time.
The relief ends almost immediately. It ends in gunshots and blood and grief, bleeding out on the floor, as all wars do, and Steve is coldly reminded that his service is not over yet. It’s actually just begun. And he has no time to sit idly by, trying to hear his heart beat steadily when so many others are racing with fear. No matter if it’s the first time it beats like this. No matter if this is all new to him as well.

She doesn’t say anything. It’s not uncommon either – sometimes, when this discussion doesn’t flare into desperation and anger, it’s filled with long silences and awkward pauses, when words fail to connect into comprehensible meaning, hearts too raw and minds too full of white noise for them to be able to be honest without feeling like they’re pulling teeth at every sentence they utter at each other. That, and the odd feeling of being exposed by just laying here, having just woken up, still tired, still in each other’s arms – it’s hard, to keep the vulnerability out of the bed, the place where it always feels like all the masks and walls just dissolve away. Beds have been places for masks as disguises for Tony for many years before, to perform an act that wasn’t truly him – now, he has forgotten how to keep his shields up while in it, and it’s too late to bring them back now.
let go.
Natasha watches him like a hawk as he shoves the whole cookie in his mouth, munching enthusiastically, and he reaches for a second one without prompting or insistence of her part. She seems satisfied with that. Steve eats the second one the exact same way, and he realizes that was not the best plan, because the cookie is dryer than he expected and the thing just sucks the moisture out of his mouth, and crumbs fall all over his mouth and chin.

“I turned off all my transponders and communication devices before I left the United States, as well as my tracking. We decided that it would be safer if no one, not even Mr. Stark, knew where I was headed.”
Steve can feel the way Nat and Sam both tense up, just like him, by the brush of their shoulders against his. Steve’s heart begins to race, beating loudly and painfully in his chest, hammering against his ribcage, like a bird desperate to find an open window, only to find itself trapped forever in a too small confinement.
Well. If anything, she acted. She acted to do something she thought it would help.
Before she can take another step, she pauses and looks back at him, an evil smirk on her face. “You better not be implying what I think you are, Cap. I’m not in the mood.”
“Nothing, is no big deal."

Tony stops his motion of reaching inside the cabinet and looks at him with piercing eyes.
“No, before that.” Clint says, as if Steve had just grown two heads. “In the HYDRA base where they lived. When Tony got the scepter. She said he was the first one she got to.”

The king stares down at him for a moment – which only goes to show how much power he holds in his posture and presence, because he is no more than a small projection on Steve’s palm, and still, Steve feels like he somehow is being analyzed from above, like a child under the inspection of an extremely demanding adult –, before he says:
“We won’t.” Cap assures him. “Thor is going to take me to an advantage point. I wanna talk to them.”
“I know.” Rogers says, with surprising calm. “But we’re trying to save the Universe.”
and clear.
“Sure.” Tony heaves, eyes distracted. “Okay. ‘Till tomorrow, then.”
FRIDAY’s silence is all the agreement he is going to get.
He smiles politely, all American Boy charm and clear blue eyes, despite the fact his posture is as stiff as a board; using a brown leather jacket, jeans, tidy hair and a box on his hands. It’s like he came out from a vintage magazine. “Thank you, Mr. Stark. This is more than enough.”

That’s –
Tony has to fight very hard to resist the urge to roll his eyes. Lang is so weird. Really, why did Pym choose him? Not that he’s a bad guy, far from it, but Pym and Lang, working together… Tony is having a hard time wrapping his head around that one.
The air catches in Jarvis’ throat, blocking his airways like a clogged pipe, uneasiness skyrocketing in a matter of seconds.
“Power isn’t what makes one worthy.”
“A phone works both ways.” Natasha quips back. “Have you tried calling him?”
They are all suited up, already. Some of them didn’t have anything else to wear. Rhodey and Pepper decided to suit up early, Tony has offered Bruce one of his Kevlar suits prototypes he had in his workshop, Nebula and Rocket have no armor besides what they have on their back. They say they don’t need it. Tony is the only one not in his armor yet, and while the others start to move frantically, gathering weapons, he turns to look at Nebula, his hand hovering on the nanite casing in his sternum, a hesitant question in his eyes.
He remembers.

He presses a kiss into her hair, missing the faint fruity scent of her favorite shampoo, but he noses the strands anyway, for their softness and the tenderness of the gesture, to caress her as she is caressing him, unwilling to destroy this sheen, fragile bubble of peace he seems to have woken up to.
He just wants them to understand.

“Too late because we would be married?”
They are inside the Quinjet in less than ten minutes, and Sam is flying them in the direction of the city as fast as he can.
He knows what that feels like.
He doesn’t know where Tony’s bruises are, even if Steve is sure he has them.

“All you need to know is that this is Tony. Nothing else, Maria.” Howard quickly answers, giving her shoulders a reassuring squeeze. “It’s not important. No one knows about it, and it’s safer if you don’t know it either. But don’t worry. I’ve handled everything.”

“I’m glad you’re here, Tony.” Natasha whispers in his ear, barely there, but the meaning of the words is so raw and truthful that it flows into him like a living thing, and before he knows it, his hands are closing in, and he’s hugging her back, even if it’s shaky, even if it’s still not sure.
“Mad robots?” Rocket asks, with an arched brow.
Howard raises his head from the contracts he’s going over, more on instinct than actually paying attention, and then he realizes he actually hasn’t hear a word Maria said. “What?”
“I don’t know.” Clint says, in a guarded tone. “Maybe.”
“And then… The Accords won’t be a problem. I’ll retire. Rogers can do whatever he wants.”
And in the end it was Zemo, a man consumed by grief, heart heavy with sorrow for his lost family and nothing more than his convictions to push him forward to destroy them for revenge - he was the one that succeeded.
would have been offended if Tony had worded it like he almost did. She is kind of high-strung, he reminds himself, not exactly the warm and fuzzy kind of person. So he stops, and tries again.
That means Tony has plenty of time alone with his thoughts, which is the last thing he wants right now.

Steve grumbles shamefully, “It’s not about that.”
Maybe they should’ve talked more. Maybe Vision would have said something important then, to Tony. If Thor really is right and Tony should’ve been the one to somehow find what sort of clues Vision could’ve left behind. There’s no way of telling now.
He wonders if she picked this up from T’Challa, or if they both got it from Queen Ramonda herself. Seems like the most probable option.

So it takes a while. It takes a while for Wanda have the opportunity to catch him when he’s coming back, after another long day out in the city, right when he’s coming up the stairs of the emergency exit. He thought he’d have a better chance not to alert anyone of his presence if he started coming and going through them, rather than the stairs right down the hall.

(Call me a liar, Rogers.)
“And I didn’t know why, so I read about it.” Clint defends. “And guess what? I didn’t see anything about a floating prison in those Accords.”
Tony presses his lips together in a tight line, both angry and ashamed of his anger, and he looks to the side stubbornly , trying to avoid saying something he’ll for sure regret.
“I know that.” Nebula huffs, slightly annoyed. “But it doesn’t make it any easier. I was weak, and foolish, and I let him get into my head and make me believe she was my enemy, not my ally. I tried to beat her, and she was better, and I resented her for it because he

“That’s really nice of you.” Tony comments, and he completely means it. “Nicer than sneaking out, I guess.”
“We need to get into Wakanda.” Tony points out, for what it feels like the hundredth time.
JARVIS voice does not startle him, because it was never really gone, was it? Vision had inherited it. At first it had been painful, but the exposure throughout the years had made the scars easier to bear, a almost conforming knowledge that his creation would live on, even if in another form, and at the end of the day, Tony would never begrudge his AI for
FRIDAY pulls up another footage, from what looks like the inside of a train station, and two very alien things show up at the screen, one big, stupid-looking guy, that looks kind of like an evil elf or whatever the hell he is; and a woman, with blue designs on her face, horns, and the most hollow eyes Tony has ever seen.
