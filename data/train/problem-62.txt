Sherlock didn't really do formal wear. Or, more precisely, he
John stood up the moment the surgeon came out of the operating room. He didn't wanted the reassuring words, the sugar coated banality the man usually told to frightened family member. He was a soldier and an army doctor. He wanted to know precisely which arterial had been touched, the depth of the wound, which limbs has not been enough irrigated, during how long. He needed to know in order to calculate the damages, the nature of the therapy, the length of the recovery, the extent of the scar.
That how he ended in a posh shop, the address recommended by Mycroft, with his personal saleswoman focused on him. It took her 10 seconds to destroy all of his illusion about how he even have an idea of what would flatter him.
He immediately leaned with his back against the door, holding his breath. What was wrong with him? He was a float of words yesterday night, and now he only managed 2 sentences? If he hadn’t already convinced other boy of his insanity, his last words will surely do the job.
“I...” he stuttered hurriedly “I need a wrap top for my dance class, and it's really hard to find in the men's section, so I-”
“Was not!”
“No, sir, you can’t,” said him with the tone of a man who had repeated the same sentence for the nth time “Please, just wait here and let us do our work.”
“Oh, not you this time, dear! I think it comes from one of the higher flats. But we need to get out! The firefighters are evacuating the whole building”.
“Well, she is not.”
He sighed. Well, it was too late to go back now. More firefighters were already ushering the tenants to the other side of the street, pulling blankets on the shoulder of the one, raised in hurry out of their beds, were only wearing light pajamas.
John tried to play it cool, like it wasn't a huge thing to hold another boy's hand in a middle of a public place. Sherlock hesitated a moment more, then he extended his arm too, and in a second they were holding hands in the middle of Harrods's aisles.
But the truth was, it had been different. The blond boy had looked at him with interest, stayed friendly, even after Sherlock had rudely deduced him. He had even called him brilliant.
“Well, it’s not obvious to me.”
As Sherlock's ballet season was finished, so he had authorized himself to go out when John had asked him to come. There had been some loud music, a lot of singing and drinking games, and John had been increasingly tipsy and touchy feeling as the soirée passed by.
But what he head was John muttering:
John’s coat wasn’t as warm as Sherlock's and the cut was shorter, making him feel the cold from the concrete floor coming through the fabric of his jean, freezing his arse and backside. After a few minutes, his feet were properly numb, and he was clenching his jaw to prevent his teeth from chattering.
And Sherlock was aware of the real meaning behind that term. It was too soon to talk about a date, but it certainly was an opening for more.
Then he slammed the door shut.
“Over there!”
John startled, his head spinning as he turned toward Irene.
John spends the night trying to reassure himself. Even if fragmentary, the surgeon's words had been reassuring: the bullet at been traversing, the blood lost had been important but early taken care of, and none of the vital organs had been touched. But Sherlock's exhaustion after nearly 2 weeks refusing sleep and food hadn't helped his case. John fought between anger and relief until the nurse send him home, with the promise to call him if anything happened.
He had rudely brushed off Mrs. Hudson offers of tea in order to mourn about the failure of his experience: when he had reached his flat last night, the molds he was studying were dead dry, and even though he still had new ones on his fridge, next to a marmalade pot filled with thumbs, he wasn't in the mood anymore.
“There is no point without tea!”
John soon found himself pretty bored. There was nothing interesting to look at on the roof, his phone battery was long dead, and the end of the adrenaline rush caused by the chase left him chilly and slightly dizzy. He hunkered down with his knees close to his chest, trying to calm his spinning head. But as the thrill of the chase faded, biting cold took its place.
Sherlock tone was detached, as usual careful not to betray his inexperience in relationship. John frowned, considering his answer honestly. Sure, he would have never considered cuddling in a rooftop by night while freezing his ass as “romantic”. But that was before. Before Sherlock. Before becoming SherlockandJohn. They weren’t following any of the patterns John had had in his previous relationship. They had never been to a movie together, Sherlock had never brought him breakfast in bed, and John had never bought him flowers. And even when they did do something that could have been considered romantic, such as dining at Angelo’s with a candle on the table, they were speaking about crime scene, dead bodies or international art trafficking.
Sherlock blurted a sigh of exasperation as he deported himself on the left to avoid being crushed by a couple who was arguing about the gift for their respective mother-in-law The young dancer despised crowded stores, even more than John did. But when the other teen had asked him to come he just couldn't have said no, because it meant that John was at least talking to him again. And it wasn't like John had talked to him much in the last 2 weeks. In fact, since that night, since that party, things had been pretty tense between the two friends.
It couldn't have been more than a couple of minutes before Sherlock felt John's knot deflate. Semen spilled over the edge of his hole and ran down his arse cheek. They would remain joined much longer during a heat, but there was nothing he could do about that now. John snuggled against him as if trying to prevent himself from slipping out of Sherlock. He pressed his face against Sherlock's skin, squeezing his omega so hard that it left Sherlock breathless.
"Yeah," John replied and dropped a feather-light kiss on Sherlock's forehead.
Victor set his cup down grumpily, gave the big pot on the cooker another stir, and went over to her through the passage between the rooms. Together, they turned the coffee table ninety degrees and set it down next to the couch.
the key to it all in the end?
...so there was few S4 (ugh!) influence. But as you see, the S4 trailer had some influence on this little story after all... :p
John licked and sucked the smaller omega cock incessantly while his fingers plunged as deep as possible inside Sherlock's body to stimulate the release of more lubricant. He spread some of the viscous fluid on Sherlock's cock before putting it back into his mouth, letting out a downright obscene sigh.
"I can do that myself..." Sherlock grumbled with embarrassment, but let his alpha continue.
It was Friday. John had just returned from his shift at the surgery, and was piling the take-away he'd brought home with him for lunch onto two plates, clearly intending to share it with Sherlock. Sherlock had already memorised the address Lestrade had sent him, and was about to put on his shoes.
“Yes. Isn’t it obvious?”
“I could have replaced it immediately, the manager of a small appliances store owes me a favor, but you always say that it's rude to wake people up in the middle of the night!”
“Lestrade, there is two pair this time! Well, this serial-killer starts to be interesting after all!”
On the evening on the 14th, he chose to dress at Greg's place when Sherlock went to 221B, wanting to keep his purchase a surprise and maintaining the illusion of a real date even if they were living together and both knew how the night will end (John hoped that Sherlock's “sex positions” chart will have some interesting suggestions).
“Are you hurt?”
“Following the lead at Canary Wharf, like you requested.”
He went directly to the bathroom, not bothering to lit the light on his way. The burning hot shower he took left him clean and sleepy. He felt himself slip away, the exhaustion and worries of the day catching him as he entered their bedroom.
“That was brilliant.”
“Irene!” yelped John. He jolted, nearly standing back, his face turning beet red.
So yeah, sometimes, John felt a little self-conscious about the state of his clothes. He knew he couldn't really do anything about his appearance. He had always be the shortest in the room, his hair grew in untidy manners and was a boring shade of blond, and he knew that even if his body was well built, he had not the gracious ways of Sherlock.
After 3 hours full of mind-blowing fittings, he finally chose a new dark blue suit, three shirts with deliriously soft materials, and a striped waistcoat which make him feel very distinguished. The saleswoman had been delighted to know the occasion of his purchases, added heart-shaped cufflinks on the bag, and wished him a good night with a saucy grin.
The boy stayed agape before spluttering.
Definitely interesting.
“Grandparents. A hand knitted one, with an ugly pattern, I'm afraid. And there is already a second packet with a 'John' nametag sit next to Harry's one.”
“Ok, give me three quarters of an hour.”
The soft fabric of Sherlock’s scarf was warm from his body against John’s forehead, and released smells of sweat and home. John closed his eyes and almost felt a press of lips against his scalp.
John’s shoulder dropped “Really? Are you sure?”
Keeping his chin raised, Sherlock ignored the crimson cheeks and mortified face of the blond boy.
John stroked the hand on his thigh, caressing the bony knuckles and the spaces in between that were moist with omega essence. "It's okay," he whispered breathlessly. "I've got you. Just let me. We both need it." He rolled his hips, slipped just a few millimetres out of Sherlock, only to sink back in as deep as possible with a choked-off curse.
"What do
John bit his lip, not sure what to make of the whole thing. It was almost as if Mary and Victor were in cahoots to talk John into a date. Clearing his head for a couple of hours and having a friendly chat wouldn't hurt anyone, would it? Especially when there was a pretty young woman volunteering so willingly.
A fine smile plays around Sherlock’s pale lips, a spark of mischief in his greyish-blue eyes. He is obviously very pleased with John's reaction. (Bastard.)
"Sherlock, I think it's starting..."
"I'm sorry to see you like this, John. He doesn't know what he's missing out on."
"I can't remember exactly," Sherlock admitted. "I think Sherrinford got me out of bed one night and scolded me for being so irresponsible. We went outside and the shed was going up in flames. He patted my head and said he'd fix it all for me, that I shouldn't worry. I was so grateful to him. I wasn't speaking at that time, by the way.
"Of course. He can scarcely wait to get to the military academy. He'll be leaving London as soon as he has his documents in hand. And I shall be preparing my move." Sherlock couldn't suppress a hateful smirk at the sight of Mycroft ruefully shaking his head. He obviously couldn't believe that Sherlock would go to such lengths to get away from him.
John got up, his finger pointed on Sherlock to emphasize his words.
“Do you think so?”
John looked at him in disbelief. Sherlock had spread his arms toward him, keeping his coat open with a tiny inviting smile.
“John, you were blatantly checking him out.”
“Sherlock, they said it had been all cleared. It was coming from the 4th floor. Apparently someone had left some plastic thing too close to the stove. Anyway, we can come back home now.”
It was unusual for him to be surprised by anything or anyone, and even more to stay interested in a person after he had deduced them. But the boy had not only kept his calm under his deduction, but had also expressed a genuine amazement. It was definitely a situation that he had rarely encountered, aside from Lestrade, maybe.
Sherlock didn't even move at this display of testosterone. He simply rattled the door one last time and listened to the dull sound it made when pushed.
Sherlock stopped and took a short pause before asking.
“Good morning”, he greeted after standing back. Sherlock was still in his pajamas, but his eyes were fully awake. “I've made breakfast.”
As John was still frozen in place, Sherlock rolled his eyes. “My coat is bigger than yours, and that way we can share body heat while we're waiting. Hurry up, John, I'm not exactly warm either”, he finished crisply. This, at least, seemed to shock John out of his immobility. Detangling his stiff limbs, he crawled to sit between the detective parted legs, his back against Sherlock's torso.
“Wow. Ok, then,” said John, raising his hand in surrender.
The young women were standing a couple feet from them. Irene was smirking at them, her eyes shining under a blond wig. Her face was artistically painted, lips pales and face white as snow, her petite body in a long and ethereal white dress, her hands bearing a series of delicate silver rings.
Actually, there was no mug of tea. And no tea either. John's smile had a little halt when he asked lightly:
“Yeah, but you never make 'basic chemistry'. Not without poisoning it, anyway”.
“What?”
Sherlock opened his eyes, gazing at his blogger’s profile. In the dim light provided by a lonely street lamp, John’s face was wan, his lips pursed in a thin line and his sandy blond eyebrows gathered.
Then he remembered yelling, pressing his hand to the wound, calling Sherlock's name, giving orders and screaming for help, an ambulance, anything, anyone.
“But John, you said-”
“'knight-on-the-white-horse complex'?” echoed the boy.
“What are you, 17 or 7?” snapped Sherlock, “Besides, if your mother had coerced you to wear costume every year during your childhood, you'll hate costumes too. Have you ever seen my brother in a vampire outfit?” He flinched with a dramatic roll of eyes, “he looks like a Transylvanian sausage. It's a sight you don't want to remember.”
“So you don't think it's going to take the night?” insisted the blond boy.
Their relationship was still building, and it was a bit surreal sometime to finally be able to really be together, in every sense of this word, after years of denial. But John found himself every day amazed with the kisses, the new proximity they shared, the free access Sherlock had gave him to heart and body, mirroring John openness.
Wanting to share his disdain with his roommate, Sherlock tried to locate him through the mass of dancers. He was tilting his head on the direction of the cheap costumed teen, ready to share a superior smile with John when his eyes finally find blond haired boy.
floor. They were another time separated by the crowd before they took the escalator. Because it was Sherlock's favorite, they always took the Egyptian's escalator to get to the upstairs floor. Unfortunately, it was the most impressive one, so also the most packed, gathering the usual Londoners with additional tourists.
“Oh, ok.”
“Does he?” Sherlock snored in disdain when John nodded. “This film becomes more and more insane with every new character.”
Much to his displeasure, there was a tiny voice inside his head that yelped in delight: the idiotic and annoying romantic side of Sherlock beamed about signs of destiny and perfect complementarily. Even his practical side told him how convenient it was, because John's left-handedness worked with Sherlock's right-handedness. That way, they could either share a handicap, or have both their good hands in use, without releasing contact.
of December, and John always waited until the last moment to find her a gift, resulting in a rushed visit on the pre-Christmas shopping nightmare. John complained every year, sweared that he’ll come sooner next time, and then forgot all about his resolution until the next season.
Sherlock repressed a shiver, shifting on the high chair in front of his microscope. His kitchen was uncomfortably cold, but he had to maintain low heat and a high level of humidity to study the mould he was working on in optimum conditions.
“John, you look... It's very...”
Over an hour passed before John managed to extract himself of the mass of dancing bodies. Gosh, it had taken him ages to get rid of that girl!
“Are you going to sulk all night?”
John was looking another way, dancing with a blond girl in a medieval-inspiration dress.
“I made the effort to cook breakfast, do you want it or not?” snapped Sherlock. Pausing, he visibly bit his own tongue, and tried to cool his features. “Please, I've made it for you.”
Suddenly hyper aware of his dishevelled state, curls raised in every direction thanks to his position on the couch and only wearing boxers under his dressing gown, Sherlock had a moment of panic. He brought the ends of his dressing gown in front of him to cover his chest, then remembered that it was the one with the bleach discolorations on the sleeve. Great. What a stunning second impression.
He was already in the cab in his new outfit to meet Sherlock at Angelo's when he felt his confidence run thin. What if Sherlock didn't like his new clothes? Or laugh at him? John felt a drop of sweat rolling on his back. Even worse, what if Sherlock didn't even acknowledge it?
I find you fascinating last night with your deduction, and I really want to make up for my stupid comment about you being weird. Just so you know, I totally said to Mike that you were amazing. And that the fire was not your fault. You didn't seem to freak out when you talked about homosexuality, so I'm hoping we're on kind of the same boat here,” he cleared his throat “So, if you have some time, I’d like to buy you a coffee. I’ve heard that the one served at the Speedy next door was drinkable. I'm pretty sure it can’t be worse than the one served in the hospital’s cafeteria.”
As they approached, Sherlock discerned the exasperated face of the fireman behind his helmet. He not so gently pulled the blond man over near Sherlock.
“More like permanently,” admitted Sherlock.
“Of course not.”
“I’m offering you a place under that ‘big coat of mine’ as you so elegantly put it.”
“Well, anyway, that’s amazing.”
If John was honest with himself, and he tried to be as much as possible, his first time holding hands with Sherlock hadn't be at all like he has imagined it. But, after all, things were never as he had imagined when Sherlock was involved.
“Then go!”
He let go of the man’s arms and immediately got back into the building, leaving Sherlock and the blond on the pavement. The young man came to stand at Sherlock’s side, shifting restlessly.
They both nodded needlessly for another minutes, until John remarked.
“It's impossible in central London, John,” said Sherlock with a muffled voice, “The light of the city makes the sky too bright for us to dicern-”
Sherlock took a second to look at his attire. He seemed around his age, but was a good foot shorter, his stocky body restless with energy. He was wearing jeans with the zipper open, obviously put on in hurry, and a jumper with an atrocious pattern. Sherlock didn't remember his face. The boy had to be a new tenant, then. Plain clothes, plain face, he looked as dull as any other neighbor.
Inside, it was a swirl of customers rushing for last seconds gift at it was only days before Christmas. On the alleys, children were running excitedly with parents shouting at them, arms full of wrapped boxes. At the entrance, a blond teen was standing with a bemused expression on his face.
"On a level, brother dear, of which I have warned you your entire life."
None of it made any sense. Maybe the big yellow book of fairy tales could give him some clue that would help him make some progress. A glance at the clock told John that it was almost four in the morning. He didn't know whether Mrs Hudson had kept the book of fairy tales that had been left when she was kidnapped by Moriarty, or whether it had passed into the possession of New Scotland Yard. He decided he'd ask her as soon as she was awake.
"You don't think...?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Victor looked up as if making a calculation, then opened his mouth to speak only to close it again and shake his head. "I'm sorry, John. For everything. I shouldn't have said anything to that reporter. She exaggerated my story in order to sell papers, and I can't do anything about it because I was too drunk to realise I was making a mistake."
How much pain was John carrying around inside him? Did he even have the resources to deal with it on his own?
He'd been at the facility for a couple of months now, a place with the polarising name 'New Horizons.' Mycroft had picked it out and organised Sherlock's transfer directly after his release from hospital. According to Lestrade, it had been the only way to circumvent a trial and lengthy prison sentence for drug possession.
"No? All right, I can plump that up a bit. Shall we say another thirty thousand?" He opened his cheque booklet, uncapped his pen again, and had already started to fill in the required information when John's fist slammed down on the desk. Mycroft paused.
Sherlock snorted derisively.
, Victor swore to himself and grinned before following him.
John sighed and tightened the embrace, pressing his nose into the crook of Sherlock's neck.
Another brother had never been spoken of. Not once in two years.
Sherlock understood what John was trying to say, but it still felt strange. He'd known for years that Mycroft was more interested in alphas than omegas, and had somehow made his peace with it. What he found more disagreeable was the fact that Anthea and Archie had to suffer because of it. If Mycroft had been honest with himself and those around him from the start... No, Sherlock knew all too well that he still wouldn't have been accepted. An alpha who carried on a romantic liaison with another alpha was anomalous and would have caused a sensation no matter what;
. At least one of them has already agreed to join in our little game … well, not voluntarily, of course!"
As if on cue, he sees the fridge and half-heartedly remembers their scarce stock of food. "Do you want something from Tesco?"
No, nothing like that could be allowed to happen again. He pressed his left fist against his forehead, squeezed his eyes shut, and tried to focus on the here and now.
"Don't worry, I know how to defend myself," Sherlock said with a smile, but when he saw the way the corners of John's mouth turned downward and his forehead developed dubious lines, he added, "I'll behave myself – I promise."
"I don't want to talk about it!" Sherlock countered and stomped angrily out of the room.
"What?!" John barked.
In the end, John settled on a book about a serial killer who had terrorised the area around Leeds in the 1980s. The Yorkshire Ripper would certainly pique Sherlock's interest and was a suitable gift for him. Cilia merely acknowledged John's selection with an incredulous shake of her head, refraining from any further comment.
"Don't know. I'm fine. Go away."
Beyond that, she knew not only Mycroft's weak points, but Sherlock's too. She would know how to destroy both men with a ridiculously small amount of effort. Had Anthea used her knowledge of Sherrinford to create the fairy tale letters and slowly but surely drive Sherlock and with him Mycroft over the edge?
"So? I don't understand what you're getting at."
Thereafter, the mood had cooled by the minute, until John thought he heard ice crunch in her every word. At first, John didn’t dare open his mouth again, but soon, he completely lost interest in even trying. Of course, that was another thorn in Sarah’s side and they had one hell of a fight, which eventually ended with John changing the booking of his flight for an exorbitant sum and returning to London four days early.
John became more and more aghast as he listened to the omega's explanation. Although he didn't like to admit it, what Sherlock was saying made a lot of sense. John was also furious at himself for not having realised the momentousness of the prohibition. He'd always been the one who felt discriminated against, as an unbonded alpha.
"Are you exercising?"
Sherlock slapped his hand over his mouth and looked at John in shock.
A voice from the past flashed into his mind, accompanied by the scent of daisies and rock candy.
"About twenty."
"For example how your body reacts to a kiss and what happens to your partner. What you need to do to cause the reaction you want. What you like and what you don't like. What to do with your hands, and what your partner's hands are doing with you. What it tastes and smells like, how it feels..." Victor said, his voice seeming to change during the course of his monologue, becoming darker, virtually liquefying. It made Sherlock's ears tingle, made the back of his neck tingle, and when he turned toward Victor, he saw that Victor was looking at him with a quiet smile from beneath half-lidded eyes.
He stood in the centre of the spotlight and thought about his violin. It materialised in his hands, settling against him like a long-time lover, vibrating under his fingers with the first stroke across its trembling strings. Sherlock began to compose a piece that captured his loneliness and yearning in musical notes. Words had no place here. He listened over and over to the gentle tones, making corrections now and then, weaving passages together here and there, and letting himself be buoyed up by the melody.
He'd often been forced to experience
"Shit..." John muttered, leaning his forehead against the cold tiles. When he'd had enough, he turned the water off and wrapped a towel around himself. His mind felt a little clearer, a tiny bit cleaner. He glanced in the mirror again, checking his throat, his neck, and his back as well as he could. He swallowed hard. He discovered more oval-shaped marks on his shoulders, dark red with purple spots. Along with marks made by fingers on his hips, although they should heal quickly.
"How should we do this?"
... John... we shouldn't..."
"What... the
But that wasn't the real problem. Much more horrifying was the fact that he'd sought out the contact, even needed it. That the desperate battle had been more mutual than antagonistic. Comfort and understanding in the most absurd manner possible. Not to be alone with this all-encompassing grief, this disintegration. At least for a little while. Now the loneliness had once again assumed its place at his side, and a sense of being torn asunder – both mentally and physically – began to overtake him.
Without hesitation John's hand slides under the waistband of his trousers and fumbles somewhat clumsily at his cramped erection, smears pre-cum over his fingers and sighs softly. His knees tremble as if they were made of jelly, and he knows that his legs will no longer hold him if he were so stupid as to finish this standing here in the corridor. So, he withdraws his hand and leans with his ear against the door. His heart skips a beat when he realises how Sherlock's voice falters for a long moment and falls silent, before the orgasm rips through him.
Sherlock let his tongue wander experimentally across the base of John's cock where the knot would form during a heat, wetting the skin with his saliva before gently plucking at it with his lips. He let out a lascivious sigh, repeated the titillating action, and kissed the inside of John's thigh before returning to the tip of John's cock and enveloping it in his mouth, notwithstanding any remaining traces of lubricant. The faintly chemical taste fused with his alpha's salty note.
The short, dark-haired woman had a rapid gait and dragged her feet a little, as if her legs had been bound together at the knees such that she wasn't able to take adequate steps. She would always rap the door once with her knuckles before entering the room. She was constantly changing her hairstyle, which indicated to Sherlock that it must be a new day each time.
"Well, here I am. Do I get to find out what this whole charade is about? If you want to talk to me, you could just pick up the phone."
"Oh no? How did he know about my parents' debts or Harry's problems then? How did he know we had been discussing whether to help them out financially, and in what manner?" John demanded.
Victor inspected the contents with a frown. There was an opened tube of lubricant gel, but no condoms. Well, that was no wonder given John's long abstinence. In the wake of the day's events, John certainly hadn't thought to purchase any for his date with Mary. Victor bent down to his jeans, took out two square packets, and dropped them onto the nightstand along with the lube.
"Digital fingerprint. She was the last one who logged into the system and unlocked the door to Moriarty's cell," Mycroft explained, interlacing his long fingers on top of the desk. His aloof gaze tracked Sherlock across the room, once in a while briefly jumping to John.
Sherlock watched his alpha as he went out. He was a lucky sod, wasn't he? John was a good man. A good alpha. Not perfect by any means: he'd made his share of mistakes and done some foolish things in the past. But who hadn't? And didn't the fact that he was trying to overcome his weaknesses make him that much closer to perfect? Or at least that he was trying hard to get better, to be more sensitive?
The trip would take about an hour and a half. John had brought along a paperback to read, but he might as well use the journey to tease a few more titbits of information out of Victor about his and Sherlock's shared past. After all, the entire point of this outing was to come to terms with the past.
John shook his head, chuckling hoarsely. "You're crazy!"
John made an inquisitive sound as Sherlock handed him back the bottle and leaned over for a welcome kiss. John placed one hand on Sherlock's nape and returned the kiss before brushing his nose against his pale neck to breathe in his omega's familiar scent. Sherlock also nuzzled into the crook of John's neck and inhaled deeply.
"Is this what you wanted? Hm?!" Victor growled over the litany of
"Thanks," John said softly and closed the album. He'd seen enough to get an impression of Sherrinford. It wasn't his intention to burden Mrs Holmes any longer with memories of her first-born child. She nodded curtly, put the album back, and left the room again.
"I believe you, Sherlock, I do. And yet it seems as if there are two opposing forces within you. One being the desire to renew the bond, and the other fear of the pain."
Abigail, who was driving, explained that there would be more than fifty guests from various years of study. "So we should definitely bring sleeping bags along, so we can sleep there. They're sure not to have enough on hand."
Sherlock appeared to have undergone a change as well. John couldn't quite put his finger on it; after all, his omega was always cuddly and willing when it came to sex. But just now he seemed less inhibited. More relaxed, and not as stuck in his own head.
In the end, Mycroft had placed him under house arrest, enforced by two of his security guards. Sherlock hadn't taken kindly to that, and bolted at the first opportunity.
one of the omegas – presumably the most petite one, standing barefoot in the grass filling glasses with white wine, her hip-long blonde hair gently swirling in the evening breeze – was about to go into heat. It was a simple matter to pinpoint her condition from the composition of her scent. John pressed his tongue against the roof of his mouth and swallowed hard.
"I want you to fuck me."
"I'm sorry... It's none of my business," Lestrade said and lifted his hands in an appeasing gesture. "I'm really only here to check in on you and tell you this: see this as an opportunity and go to the facility Mycroft picks out as soon as possible. With the amount of Seven that was found in your possession, you'd be looking at several years in prison otherwise. Not even Mycroft could get you out of that. Understand?"
"I often dream about him ..." Sherlock's voice was barely more than a whisper inside their cosy, warm nest. "I sometimes see him standing in front of me; other times it's just his voice speaking to me. Sometimes he's a faceless shape leaning over me. A black mass. But I always know it's him. There are nights... nights in which I wake up in a panic, disoriented. Scared. He scares me. I've never told you about him because I... I don't want to have to think about him. Do you understand? Even six years after his death, he's still very much present in my subconscious."
But now John took his time. The tip of his tongue – first firm, then soft – probed more than licked, circling the twitching ring of muscle over and over again until he leaned in even further and pressed a kiss to the furled flesh.
Just like their first encounter, Archie immediately grabbed Sherlock's index finger and squeezed it with all his might, tugging and drooling on it between excited squeals. Unable to wipe the stupid grin off his face, Sherlock sat down at the table and tightened his hold on the little creature, which was clearly trying to impart to him something of great importance.
"Possessions."
"But you don't trust yourself enough to approach him."
"Have you spoken to John about your concerns?"
"I need to know! I need to be sure whether my alpha is alive or... or..."
His scalp tingled in the spots where his sensitive follicles were still softly complaining. That sensation alone was enough to send Sherlock back a few minutes in time and conjure back up the overwhelming feelings which had flooded his body when John grabbed him so roughly and pounded into him over and over again.
"Even now? Without any essence?" Sherlock laughed disbelievingly, only to emit a guttural moan a moment later.
"Do you actually know how good you taste? Like honey and a sea of wildflowers. Like danger. Are you dangerous, Sherlock?"
"On holiday? No wonder you're so upset," John jested, but when Sherlock stopped in his tracks and shot him an angry glare over his shoulder, he cleared his throat as if to drown out what he'd just said.
"Did you see him?"
The discussion with John's parents was tricky. John not only lectured them on the urgency of not enabling Harry's alcohol dependence any longer, but also brought up the topic of debt which had been wilfully ignored for so long. He listed the facts without sugar-coating anything, just as Sherlock had laid them out to him.
"What? But... hold on, I should come with you."
John nodded his head jerkily, turning away at the same time to take off his jacket. "Course," he said, letting the single word hover in the air for a moment, almost as if he wanted to add something. In the end he left it at that.
... as if he were ill!
A buzzing sounded through the mattress when the vibrate signal went off in his phone. John promptly turned over and reached for the device.
It had begun suddenly, and kept happening at more or less lengthy intervals. When he realised that it wasn't getting better, he went to the doctor to get checked out. But everything appeared to be normal. The beta doctor ushered him into her consultation room after completing the examination, and given him a sceptical look.
John stared intently at Bill's teasing fingers; the strange sensation in his stomach got stronger. He shook his head as if to dislodge an unpleasant image and wrapped his fingers around Cilia's bent knee.
John chuckled softly at the sarcasm in Sherlock's voice. "So you were worried then?"
, Sherlock thought. His eyes wandered down the man's body of their own accord, following its edges and curves, the plays of light and shadow. Sweat gleamed dully on his skin. His shoulder-length blond hair was tousled, and a few strands were stuck to his forehead. He was fairly vibrating with energy.
(What?!)
"What the hell are you on about?!" she snapped, which in turn caused Henry to burst out in tears and begin crying bitterly. Cilia was at his side in an instant to lift him away from Sherlock. She turned her back on the group and tried to calm Henry with soft, soothing words.
Sherlock thought to himself, even as he tried to calm his breathing and form words with his lips at the same time.
John wasn't stupid; he'd studied medicine and become a doctor. He was brave and loyal, knew how to defend himself and his friends. Daring and at times volatile. A tempest in an innocuous teacup. An animal that walked faithfully alongside its pack members in one moment, only to turn into a wild beast the next when it wanted to protect someone who was in danger. Even if that person wasn't one of his friends... A man full of contradictions that somehow balanced each other out.
"Oh, come on! He'll ruin all the fun," Tom cried, tossing his hands up.
John put two cups and the teapot on a tray and brought everything into the living room. He set it down deliberately on the coffee table in order to avoid the embarrassing necessity of having to explain to Victor that he shouldn't sit in Sherlock's chair. John was well aware, of course, how ridiculous it was, but he couldn't help being defensive about Sherlock's seat. Maybe it would get easier. Some day.
Sherlock inhaled sharply and slid back in his chair as if he needed to create space between himself and John.
. Of course. "William Sherlock Scott... Holmes... Sherlock is 'W'."
His muscles tensed up automatically, clutching the knot a little harder and producing a low moan from behind him. John intensified his grip and leaned his forehead against the back of Sherlock's neck.
that John saw and heard him. Perhaps has deliberately provoked the latter event (Of course he has, you idiot! Why else would your phone ring at three a.m.?!). And now Sherlock intends to...
"What the hell is this?"
"Bill?" John croaked and tried to sit up.
John nodded one more time, then laid one hand on the small of Sherlock's back and hastily directed him toward the exit. As soon as they were outside and out of hearing range, John let his mask drop. Without letting go of Sherlock, he tossed his cane into the air and caught it on the way back down, wrapped his fist around the shaft, and stalked back toward the front gate, no sign of a limp.
All of a sudden, John's stomach cramped painfully, and he felt the food threatening to come back up. He held his hand in front of his mouth, leapt from the stool, and looked around hastily, but there was no loo for guests in the shop. He just barely managed to rush outside before vomiting. Shaking, he leaned against the wall of the building next door and spat the last dregs of gall on top of the disgusting remains of his sandwich.
. You really don't need to keep repeating yourself. I understood you the first time. Yes. Yes.
He inhaled Cilia's calming scent, scooted closer to the couple, and gave them a querying look.
It seemed that happened with much greater frequency than Sherlock had thought – even though he himself was sceptical of regular alpha-omega relationships. He didn't have any statistics handy that might give him more precise information on the topic of domestic violence, but he didn't think they would reflect the true state of affairs anyway. Most omegas with that kind of problem probably avoided going public, especially since any institutions that would be involved (police, hospitals, solicitors) were almost all run by alphas. Alphas who wanted to uphold the status quo and put omegas in their place.
"That'll be another one for you," Marcus said to Abigail, peeling himself out of the half-embrace so he could go to the door. He returned a few moments later, smiling in Victor's direction.
Even so, the limits of the sphincter's ability to stretch were soon reached, and Sherlock's synapses fired impulse after impulse down his neural pathways. He dug all ten fingers into John's arms, his breath coming in shallow gasps.
"This is a private school," Sherlock said beside him, keeping his voice low. "You went here?"
, don't be ridiculous."
"Not yet," Victor said, sending a shiver of electricity through John's body when he rubbed the sensitive bundle of nerves again with his fingertips.
"Don't be. We gave it a good go – couples getaways, therapy... Even worked our way through that stupid bestseller self-help book from cover to cover. Wasn't meant to be. When she started cheating on me, and then sharing her heats with other alphas, it was clear we couldn't stay together any longer. I didn't even care that she was with other people. The dissolution of our bond was more or less just signing the paperwork. Don't get me wrong: the physical severance of a bond is no walk in the park, and your hormones go on the roller coaster ride of your life, but in the end we were just relieved to be separated."
John looks at his friend's distinctive lips when he opens them to say something. However, he remains silent. John deliberately lowers his mouth to Sherlock's, feels his soft lips and closes his eyes. A silent sigh escapes him as Sherlock returns the kiss just as tentatively. It's as if they finally got over the hurdle that kept them apart these last few days.
It didn't stop.
, spare me from having to listen things I've known forever!" In spite of the pain, Sherlock leapt to his feet and went over to the window. He pushed the drapes aside and looked out at the street, but there was no sign of John anywhere. He continued speaking without turning around. "He can't break my heart because I have no emotional connection to him. We met once and exchanged a few texts. Mummy and Dad were bonded for almost twenty years. That's something else entirely."
Sherlock stood in his bedroom, rooted to the spot, and stared at the unmade bed. Something in him wanted to go upstairs and check how much John had taken with him, to see whether he really might not be coming back. And something else in him was scared to death of what that might mean.
"I... that's..."
"You came..." Sherlock whispered between two frantic breaths.
"You can't just go to the door in your condition!" John replied, his eyebrows drawing together even further.
"I haven't spoken to Mike in forever. The last time… I guess it must have been when he introduced us."
John forced a pinched smile. “I wish we were somewhere else. Like, warm at home in front of the fireplace, you see?”.
Sherlock felt his guts turn into ice
After a moment, realizing that everyone was minding their own business, he relaxed, noticing another phenomenon. John had instinctively given him his left hand, and this little fact make him remember that John was left-handed, contrary to Sherlock, who was right-handed.
The party was easy to locate: music could be heard from the street, even louder as Greg, in a Rohan’s rider costume, opened the house door. He greeted them warmly and led them to the main room before rushing back to the door to welcome other guest. The group of friend was soon divided: John was seized by some classmates who dragged him to another room while putting him a drink in hand. Irene vanished in the crowd with an absent minded “later!” and Molly stayed at Sherlock’s side for a moment, before Mike came to ask her for a dance.
“Irene, I’m already too drunk to understand what you’re saying. What's that image?”
“I know, I'm really sorry.” John looked at his feet, bringing his courage, “But I've asked you to come because I want to-Sherlock?”
“Her deodorant. She is wearing the same as his.”
John caught up with him and they stood in the dark hallway, trying to calm their frantic breaths, both attentive to the tiniest noise.
They spend hours, silent, both looking at the dizzying white of the walls, surrounded by the dulled sound of the every day's routine of the hospital.
Sherlock’s voice seemed unusually loud in the emptiness of the night and the faint buzz from the electrical cabinet.
“Hey guys! Stop the domestic, please.”
Left alone, Sherlock gazed at the mass of teenagers. The main room of the Lestrade’s house was full of excited teen, drinking, dancing or sitting in small groups on various sofas all around the room. Sherlock grabbed a drink on a table, then, while slowly sipping it, he looked critically at the other costumed teens. He noticed that some of them were wearing outfit similar at his own, surely trying to portrait the same character. Even without having a clear picture of the character of the movie he was displaying, he proudly noticed that none of the costumes were as colorful or as detailed as his own.
"I know," John grunted and lifted his face so that he could look at Sherlock. "I just feel so helpless and don't want to leave any stone unturned, you know?"
The two months in Mycroft's custody had been pure torture for Sherlock. He hated having to be on his best behaviour in front of his brother, but he had no other choice if he wanted to return to his own flat after his house arrest was over.
"'Again and again'," Victor read out loud, "'every bloody night I hear their whispers hissing spiteful threats but whenever I tell anyone about it no one listens why won't it stop why won't it just stop'."
"Oh, John..." Sherlock covered the distance between them in two long strides, and drew him into his arms again. "Knock those ridiculous notions out of your head. That first heat had already announced itself several days before our argument escalated. Why do you think I was being so insufferable? I had no idea what was wrong with me, and… no, strike that. I knew precisely what was going on, and I wanted to drive you away. The rough handling didn't trigger the heat, it was simply the final drop which—"
Instead, his grin widened, displaying a row of crooked yellow teeth. "Have fun," he said in the local language, which even John understood with his rudimentary knowledge of Pashto.
"No more than you have."
"What did he do?" John kept rubbing Sherlock's back, holding him as close as possible to give him a sense of security and comfort.
John emptied his glass and refilled it.
As soon as he'd received the confirmation, John lunged forward and threw himself through the doorway, his heart racing like mad.
Walters placed his arm on the table beside Victor's so that they touched lightly. He examined their two hands lying side by side, as if comparing them. His fingers twitched slightly as if it were difficult for him to hold them back. Eventually he looked up, glanced over at the departure board, and reached into the inside pocket of his jacket to take out his wallet. He opened it and withdrew a business card, which he set down next to Victor's hand.
“Hi. Um, sorry if I’m disturbing you.”
He even tried to smile at his pathetic joke, smiling hopefully at Sherlock. Sherlock opened his mouth, ready to ask why hadn't he already run the other way? Hadn't he already realized that Sherlock was a freak?
“Is there a problem?”, asked Greg. John and Sherlock didn’t usually needed to be brought back home after a chase.
definition of romantic. And John wouldn’t want things another way.
“How can … Who had told you… How can you possibly know that?” he sputtered.
John looked always, letting the two girls share some sloppy kisses. As if they were magnetized, his eyes immediately fell on Sherlock’s frame.
“Black, two sugars. I'll be downstairs in 7 minutes.”
"Gentlemen, the situation is almost cleared. You’ll soon be able to go back into your flats.”
“If you said so”, said John, still slightly out of breath. They were making their ways to the exit when a loud slamming noise made them flinch. They looked at each other with worry.
“Ok, then. At least the dragon hadn't foolish line to yell.”
Sherlock was frozen on the spot, trying to understand his attitude as much at the boy's.
“Whatever he said”, dismissed Sherlock”, “I think that the plastic prosthetic pointy ears and the braided hairs are made to help you to portray an elvish kind of character?”
Sherlock turned toward John. The blonde was facing the other way, his free hand nervously playing with Christmas trinkets on the shelves.
They weren’t the only ones dressed for the occasion : they've already passed skeletons, zombies with fake necrosed body parts, mommies and werewolves with different levels of facial and body hairs.
“Get out of the way, I'll try to break it.”
The girl responded with a weak smile, before they all resumed they way to the Lestrade’s house.
The blond boy turned back at him.
He was looking back in his microscope when Mrs. Hudson barged into his kitchen.
“Breakfast, John. This is the meal traditionally served in the morning.”
“Thank you Molly. I have been informed that I’m depicting Smilg.”
John despised formal wear. Even as a younger man, he had never been interested in fashion. He preferred the classic design of simple cut, the plain materials, the predictable way of black, maroon and light colors. The obligatory army uniform had been a relief, and he never regretted the imperative of the fashion season. Back from Afghanistan to civil life, if his clothes were outdated, well, so it was.
“So, any suggestion about what I could get Harry?” John’s voice pierced his thoughts. The blond teen was avoiding his gaze, but his tone was clearly apologetic. “Maybe the new book of that French author she can't shut up about?”
John stayed silence for a moment, cheeks red with alcohol and a bit of embarrassment. He considered protesting, pulling out all of the well prepared arguments he repeated to himself and others every time someone made a remark about his and Sherlock relationship. But Irene was not looking at him with teasing or distain. She looked genuinely concerned, her face open and encouraging.
“Geez, it was a bad idea to come today.”
He sent their location to the DI phone, listening to his mutter as he located them on his car’s GPS.
Sherlock let out a wry laugh. Stupid, stupid! How could he forget how easy it was to be hurt? As usual, his brother was infuriatingly right: caring was never an advantage.
did formal wear, without thinking at it as formal wear. Except for the "boring" days, when the dressing gown was required, he always seemed to be in a ready-to-go-to-the-opera outfit.
He realized he had been staring for too long when the boy shifted. But the blond didn’t step backwards as a lot of people did under Sherlock’s penetrative glance. Instead he raised his chin with a challenging glint in his eyes.
John choked.
John didn't intertwine their fingers, but he held them tight when he stepped once more into the crowd. Sherlock followed him, their arms brushing when they walked closer than before. There was suddenly a myriad of sensations from his hand to his shoulder, and he struggled to find his balance. He was sure that John would feel his elevated heartbeat from the contact between their palms. Or was the accelerated throb he detected coming from John?
“That not-”
To John's relief, he noted that Sherlock's pupils dilated and a blush came to color his clean-shaven cheeks.
“No, you've though about it enough!” Irene shouted suddenly, “Tonight the night of Durin's Day, do open the gates!”
Sherlock rolled his eyes with a disgusted grimace, make clear his thought on the matter of his brother’s relationship with the aspiring policeman.
Why Sherlock had remembered Valentine's day but deleted his own birthday was over John’s head, but he wasn't going to look a gift horse in the mouth.
London was buzzing with energy, Christmas carols spreading in the street from the shops through the cold December air. On Oxford Street, Harrods's windows were brightly illuminated with red and green lights; there was fake snow and tinsel garland in every corner.
Days later, in he middle of a crowd, with shining lights and Christmas carols blasting at his ears, Sherlock was still feeling the chill of this night on his cheeks, the gentle grip of John’s hands on his jaw, the chafed skin of John’s lips against his. Sherlock suddenly felt light headed, and started to ask himself if coming today had been a good idea.
He could have ignored it as usual, but the banging only grew louder and it was seriously pissing him off. Couldn’t they leave him alone for once in his life?
“Just look.”
They had avoided each other the next couple of days, until John had just sat at Sherlock’s table during lunch ours and had commented on the quality of the school’s sandwiches, his tone forced and his eyes never leaving the plastic table.
“What?”
The blond boy blinked.
As John was silent for a minute, Sherlock turned toward him. The blond was looking at him with clear admiration, his mouth slightly agape, and Sherlock felt himself blush.
Sherlock leaned against the door a second more, trying to calm his frantic heartbeat. He couldn’t believe that the boy was actually on his way to buy him a coffee.
Now the blond boy, John his mind supplied traitorously, will walk away, go back to his flat, never wanting again to see this weirdo of the 2nd floor.
“The roof!”
If it weren’t for the pile of dirty dishes in the sink, he wouldn’t have believed that Sherlock had indeed cooked a full and proper English breakfast. In the plates there were already baked beans, hash browns, and some slices of bacon that seemed perfectly cooked and with the right amount of greasy parts. In a side plate was a pile of toast that looked a little bit over grilled, but their toaster had always been a nasty thing.
“You're shivering”.
“Find it!” yelled he to alert the other searching team.
The wind was howling, making John slightly bend as he made his way around every corners. He met Sherlock at the end of the roof, but the detective only shook his head. They made a last swoop of the whole rooftop, only helped by the meagre light of their small flashlight, but they finally had to admit defeat, the suspect had evaporated.
“I know,” interrupted John gently with a shrug, “It's just... I would have been more romantic, you know? Cuddling under the stars...”
But he had built confidence over the years, and his mischievous smile and acidic humor had seduced over three continents before winning Sherlock's love.
“I'm not sulking.”
Halfway down the stairs, Sherlock realized that he was still dressed in the dark pristine costume he usually wore during the day.
“John, stay calm, ok?”
Before John had the time for a “bit not good” warning, Sherlock was already throwing deduction at the DI, the cut hand still in his grip. John stayed frozen on the spot until a forensic asked him to let go of the pair he was still holding.
What was new was the smell. This morning, the usual acrid odor of chemical experiment was replaced by an appetizing aroma of homemade cooking. Instantly suspicious, John got up from the bed and grabbed his tartan dressing gown off a chair before getting to the kitchen.
As Sherlock only stared at him popeyed, he pursued.
“Sorry, but this man was saying that the ceiling decoration was some random Arabic-like representation when it's clearly inspired by the Egyptian Dendera Temple bas-relief! I couldn't let it pass!”
John was already at the door, but he turned around to shout to Sherlock.
He even more nervously noted that Sherlock was wearing was John mentally called The Purple Shirt of Sex and had also styled his hair. John immediately felt the urge to pass his hand on the locks of hair, messing up the perfect appearance of his lover, making him close his eyes in bliss.
“Sherlock,” John voice was dangerously slow, “Where. Is. The. Tea?”
To police had been called early on the scene, so there was still a lot of evidence, who helped Sherlock to deduce that the killer, as the victim, was a dock worker, employed on the nearby area.
Anyway, they were going on a date on sunday night and John wanted to look his best for their first Valentine's day as a couple.
He was vaguely aware when Mycroft left a moment for calling their parents, before returning to sit on the chair on his side, the doctor's limbs numb with worry.
“Sherlock?”
They thanked him and watched him go to inform the other tenants. An awkward silence fell between them, and neither boy moved to go back to the entrance of the flats. They kept standing, both incapable of looking back at the other.
Sherlock felt his heart pounding in his chest. The plain looking boy was in fact a more complex puzzle than he had anticipated, and the challenge was thrilling.
In 20 minutes, Sherlock had deduced the height, shoe size, stance and favorite meal of the burglar, the probable place of next robbery, insulted the whole London police force as well as made the CEO secretary flee the office in tears after he revealed that her boss has clearly no intention to leave his wealthy wife for her.
“You… you look really good, Sherlock.”
Sherlock nodded wordlessly, eyes on his kitchen windows. He hoped the smoke wouldn’t come to his flat. The damps he was studying have to be maintained in very specific hydrometric and carbonate environment.
“No Sherlock That’s not...” John sighed. Since they had become a couple, Sherlock had been trying to be more mindful of John’s feelings. Especially during cases, after John had confessed feeling left aside by some of Sherlock’s habits, such as dashing out and expecting everyone, and particularly John, to catch up with him, both mentally and physically. But years of poor communication and constant bullying by nearly everyone he had met had left Sherlock with a poor grid to analyze his lover’s reactions. John had to be careful not to let Sherlock reads his flash of temper as anger or exasperation towards him. It had forced John to be more mindful of his reactions, sometimes even helping him analyze the hidden reasons for his outbursts. But tonight he was awfully aware of the reason of his misery. “Sherlock, I'm just... I’m cold okay?”.
The doctor sat at the kitchen table, surprised to see that the surface was mostly clean from any dubious chemical containers. They had been replaced by an assortment of jars, bowls and plates, two of them already half-full, indicating that Sherlock intended to actually eat with him.
“I don’t guess, I observe.”
“Wait, why were you looking at Clara’s girl magazine?”
He didn't finish his sentence, but John didn't mind, satisfied to have made his detective speechless. And also aroused, if Sherlock wiggling was any indication. He finally relaxed and leaned to kiss Sherlock on the lips, intending for a light peck on the lips. But Sherlock deepened the kiss, his eagerness making for the words of praise he couldn't find.
But dating Sherlock Holmes would have given a little fashion complex to anyone. Surely John had already said it, but God, the man was fucking gorgeous! He had a keen fashion sense coupled with large amounts of money, and all of his clothes were tailored to emphasize the curves of his breathtaking body. His shirts were always tight on his lean torso, sleeves rolled and the top button opened to reveal his insanely white and creamy skin. John had never seen him in anything but classy trousers, enclosing his backside in perfectly form-fitting fabrics.
“Yes! A wizard is surely the only one with common sense in this mad story!”
Sherlock waved his hand in the direction of the boy's body, indicating the mess in his attire.
Indeed, some meters away, Sherlock was mirroring his position, a pair of cut hand raised above his head. They looked at each other, stunned by the sound of the other's exclamation. They eyes find the other's one, an electricity feeling flying between them.
“You accent is currently Londoner, but your Scottish accent had slipped in on some words. So you’ve been living in London for enough time to have picked up the accent, but not enough to completely override your native one. The second hand clothes tell me about the state of your finances and indicate a poor background. You have a will to erase your accent, but you aren’t shy to say that you don’t come from here, so you are conscious that your accent will reveal your poor background more than your geographic origin.
He stored this line of thoughts for later and came to stand awkwardly next to the table, lips dry as he waited Sherlock's reaction. The detective could only blink for a full minute, his eyes making up and down motion as he detailed his lover's appearance.
Your rugby days are obvious by the state of your ears and the width of your shoulders. But I can’t detect any new injuries or stiffness in your movements; you’ve abandoned rugby, then.
He sat up straighter to write in his notebook his observations: The evolution of his experiment and the current time, which was 2 am.
Molly face illuminated.
John had always regarded formal wear as constricting, inconvenient, and uncomfortable; nothing that he wanted to deal with in his life. He rarely bothered to buy new clothes, even more rarely tried them before buying. If his clothes were keeping him warm and decent, that was what he was looking for, and he was content with it.
“Bisexual”
“Tonight is the perfect night to do it! Flirt, use your imagination and your charms. Tell him that you want him to put fire to your forge, to find your Arkenstone, to claim you Lonely Mountain, to become...”
He hurried to his bedroom. Downstairs, John Watson was waiting.
John blew an exasperated sigh.
John spend time pulling Sherlock's hair, mussing the scented curls and biting the soft skin of Sherlock's neck, for the pleasure of feeling the heavy locks brush on his temple and face.
He learned that he needed to wear more contrasting colors, a more form fitting costume, that his favorite striped tie should never see daylight again, and that this hue of yellow? With this hair? He couldn't be serious...
A pregnant silence fell on the scene. Obvious of the sudden tension, Mrs. Hudson gently put his hand on the dark-haired boy's forearm.
The boy raised his eyebrows. “So? I thought it was his girlfriend.”
Sherlock expelled the air from his lungs with a shaky sigh and rubbed his furrowed brow. It wouldn't be easy to dispel the tension making each and every fibre of his muscles vibrate. But he had to get back to the study where the two alphas were waiting. He'd been gone too long already.
He shook his head, more in resignation than in reply, but Mycroft seemed to be satisfied by that.
John braced his feet against the mattress, lifted his pelvis up toward Sherlock, and caught the soft sigh that fell from his lips when John's erection brushed against his.
"He's directed the hospital staff to keep you here as long as possible. In the meantime, he's looking for an appropriate facility where you're to live for the time being."
"Thank you..."
"And you? Did you find out anything else?" Sherlock asked after another stretch of silence.
"No idea, I've never thought about it before. I've always believed a bond was permanent and a line that was respected by other alphas. Finding out that's not the case is… Sherlock?" John whirled around when he realised Sherlock had stopped walking.
Kitty Riley did touch on a couple of those cases, but that seemed more to serve the purpose of reminding the reader of the fast-paced world of Sherlock's one-sided existence. Phenomena like the world's only Consulting Detective were transient when there was no more news to spread about them. And this here was new. New and exciting for the gossip-hungry readers who didn't waste a single thought on whether any of it was true.
played in the background, prompting some to sing along or at least to hum. Glasses clinked. The new year had arrived.
John frowned in displeasure, glaring daggers at Mycroft. It took a concerted effort for him to hold back the cutting retort that burned on the tip of his tongue, but he was fairly certain he wouldn't get anywhere with an attack on this man.
He glanced down at his microscope, all of the Petri dishes and pipettes, and his notebook bursting with notes. He would have dearly liked to sweep everything off the table in a single blow, to rid his life of the topic once and for all. But he knew that was nothing more than a pipe dream.
Sebastian's concoction was good; it was potent and long-lasting, although not as pure as Wiggins' blend. It was still worth the money, in Sherlock's opinion.
"Good, good, good... shall we see whether it was the right decision? Anthea..."
. He was still grinning when an elderly beta in formal livery opened the door and gave him a distrustful look.
Abigail was obviously Tom's flatmate.
His half-hearted excuse that they weren't that kind of couple was dismissed by the omega with a flick of her wrist and an affronted huff that reminded him a little of Mrs Hudson. According to Cilia, everyone enjoyed getting presents, and in the end John understood what she meant.
John directed them toward a little fish-and-chip shop near the train station that wasn't very full, both due to the early evening hour and the many other eateries in the area.
"They let him go! The two of them! Sebastian and Moran both, because it's supposedly his goddamned right to treat his omega like a piece of shit!" Sherlock stomped through the living room to the window, crossed his arms, and stared down at the street, only to whirl around a moment later and begin gesticulating wildly.
