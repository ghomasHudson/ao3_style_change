“So what do you do at the college?” Dean asks once they’re on the way.
“Dean,” he says, or tries to, though it translates as a whimper. He lifts a paw and sets it heavily on his shoulder, which just makes Dean shudder.
“I love you,” Cas barks when Dean bends over to pet him. Dean doesn’t understand him, but he does smile, so Cas considers it a win.
“Oh, he’s great. He works too hard, though. I thought graduating school would mean he would stop studying all the time, but I guess with Sammy it’s to be expected. I’m glad he’s got Jess to keep him from living in his books all day. I wish he would stop going to that stupid hippie yoga thing though, I hate taking the bus on Thursday.”
“Of course,” Cas says, holding out his hand.
Epilogue
“It’s not a thing. We’re just two dudes on a bus who are kind of friendly.”
, bring him home.”
The bus rolls up to a stop sign a block before Dean’s stop.
Sam and Dean haven’t had a case yet, so they’ve been enjoying being more domestic, cleaning and organizing the bunker, cooking. Sam is working on improving the communication network between hunters, and Dean is rereading a Vonnegut novel.
“Yeah, Sammy, I promise I’ll be careful,” he says into the phone. “Bobby said he might let us out early if it gets really bad, but it isn’t even snowing right now.”
As if he can read his mind, Castiel explains, “I like sitting close to the front of the bus.”
He clears his throat, lets the weight of Castiel’s warm hand on his shoulder give him strength, meet’s Cas’s eyes, and says, “Thanks, buddy. I, uh. I appreciate that.”
“Well, there was this hot guy on today, actually, but that’s the first time in months that there’s been anyone even remotely appealing. Usually it’s a bunch of people who are sketchy or too old or with their family or just not anyone I would be interested in.”
The next week, the sun is finally out, so a lot of the people who have been riding the bus have opted to walk instead. As a result, there are a lot of empty seats, so Dean is actually able to sit.
He realizes he’s been quiet for too long when Cas clears his throat and hesitantly says, “Dean?”
“Do you always stop teasing Sam as soon as he asks you to?”
Cas slides his hand up from Dean’s wrist back up to his shoulder and squeezes tightly, and Dean feels it like a burn.
“I don’t know, man, I think it was kind of implied.”
Dean is not in love with Castiel.
That’s unfair. Dean is a good man, Cas wouldn’t love him if he wasn’t; he may be repressed but is not a homophobe, and would be glad to see a friend, especially in these circumstances, even if there was tension between them.
“Well, that’s good. Any holiday plans?”
“He is, but I still don’t have a crush.”
They settle in the backseat, door slightly ajar, Cas’s head in Dean’s lap, Dean running his fingers through his fur. He should not be taking advantage of this, but it feels so good, mostly because it’s Dean but also just in general. He’s not very familiar with this kind of gentle touch, and it’s nice, especially with his dog feelings heightening the need for affection.
Sam and Eileen wave them off with knowing expressions, and Cas follows Dean into his bedroom. Dean shuts the door and they just stand there staring at each other.
“Yeah? Which one?”
“Yeah.”
“I’ve told him it makes me uncomfortable, but I don’t know how to explain it to him.”
“Nope.”
“So how do they fit in with the rest of your big crazy family?”
Dean blinks, caught off guard by the abrupt change of subject. “What?”
Dean sniffs and reflexively holds Cas a little closer. “Still gone. Guess that was one of the things we should have asked Jack about before he left.”
“Not bad,” she says, sounding almost as awkward as he feels. “How are you?”
Sam nods, grinning, and wanders off to answer the video call somewhere a little more private, and once he’s alone, Dean finally notices that there’s a dog staring up at him.
Cas takes his hand and squeezes tightly. Dean is dimly aware of the fact that they’re in the middle of the sidewalk still, with people walking around them and grumbling, but he can’t really bring himself to care. He can’t really focus on anything other than the warmth of Cas’s eyes and the firmness of his hand.
{from Cas to Dean} It is. When do you go back to work?
Texting back and forth almost every day doesn’t make him feel grounded for the first time in years. He doesn’t smile broadly every time he sees Cas’s name pop up on his screen followed by emojis.
Dean holds him so tightly it almost hurts, but Cas cannot be bothered, too grateful for the proof that he is wanted. “Shit, Cas,” gasps Dean. “I can’t believe this.”
“Your family is intense.”
more than he’s wanted anything for a long time. And he thinks maybe someday, maybe even someday soon, he’ll be able to work up the courage to ask for it. For Cas.
He sits there quietly for another minute, Cas still watching breathlessly, then shakes his head and stands up, at which point Cas finally pushes his way through the door.
“Awesome.”
“Oh,” Cas says softly, automatically raising his arms to return the embrace.
{from Cas to Dean} Of course! J
Cas introduces Hannah. The group chats for a few minutes, until Gabriel gets bored and wanders off. They see him talking to a sandy-haired man who Cas says is Balthazar.
Dean laughs and finds a DVD while Jo sprawls herself on the couch.
“Well, no, but there’s a difference between stupid pranks to annoy your brother and completely ignoring genuine discomfort, especially when it comes to shit like sex and romance. That’s one of me and Sammy’s number one rules, sexual orientation is off limits for teasing.”
“Oh, yes, I have four.” When Dean whistles, he smiles. “My extended family is even worse. It’s a very large family. Lots of aunts and uncles. Lots of cousins.”
“Not really,” he admits. “I mean, I’m pretty sure I learned something about asexual plants in one of the schools I went to, but I have a feeling you’re going to tell me that’s completely different.”
“No, not really. It just kind of fucked me over, you know? I hadn’t seen her since we broke up, and then all of a sudden there she was, and it reminded me of everything. And she’s got a boyfriend now, some impressive doctor guy, and it kind of hurt even though I’ve got no right to be upset about anything she does.”
“No, I’m not judging you, Lis. I’m not upset. I’m just… saying.”
“Well, hey, good for you. It’s a good school.”
“We don’t even know each other. This is the first time we’ve talked for more than two seconds and I don’t even know your name.”
“You too.”
“I’m here,” he murmurs, curling his fingers into the back of his flannel.
“How are you, Dean?” asks Cas, twisting around in his seat.
She comes over to curl up next to him on the couch and rests her head on his shoulder. “I broke up with Seth,” she mumbles.
It would have been pointless to try to attack Chuck, he reminds himself. As either an angel or a dog, he would have been stopped in his tracks the moment he even thought about it. But oh, how Cas would like to punch him. Or bite his ankles, maybe; he would deserve that.
“That makes sense. Have you talked to him about it?”
“You’re… trying to tell me that you’re not uncomfortable with my feelings for you.”
“Who’d have thought finding a dog would feel like a miracle,” Dean muses, and he’s beaming but there’s a sadness there, too, and Cas’s heart breaks at the thought of what he must have endured, how lonely he must be. “Come on, Miracle,” says Dean, hands beckoning him, and Cas is helpless to do anything but jump into his arms and let him carry him back to the car.
“So how’s it going with your brother?”
“Yeah.”
What the hell were the others doing?”
The man laughs. “You’ve got some attitude there, I see. No wonder he likes you. I’m Gabriel.”
tonight you actually said yes without a single comment about twelve-year-old girls.”
“Complicated. My family is very… traditional. And interconnected. There is a family owned company, and the vast majority of my relatives all work for it in some capacity. It can be intense. I am very close to my siblings, although maybe not as close as you and your brother. My other relatives not so much.”
“Dean.”
“Are you free next weekend?”
“Yes and no.”
They both look away, and Dean spends the rest of the trip trying not to notice the man’s warmth pressing against him.
He doesn’t say anything, but he mulls over what Charlie said. He thinks about it as they watch Game of Thrones, and he thinks about it as he locks the door after she leaves, and he thinks about it as he brushes his teeth, and he thinks about it as he lies in bed.
“It was though, and I see why you like him. He seems… dreamy. And he was pretty funny, too. He didn’t seem freaked out by us coming over at all. Or he wasn’t after we introduced ourselves.”
“Oh, god no. For one thing, my entire family enjoys trying to be matchmakers for me since I tend to keep to myself, and I’m just very tired of it. Also, I know for a fact that I would have absolutely no interest in anyone he could possibly pair me with.”
“Yeah, you too.”
Sam smirks. “So what does he find to talk about with you?”
After a while, there’s a pause in the conversation, and Dean touches his arm very lightly and asks quietly, “Hey, can we talk?” They have been talking, but Cas knows what he means, and nods.
“Oh, of course it is. My relatives think that even being a janitor in one of their buildings would have been more respectable for me than becoming a professor. I love my family – some of them – but I don’t want to follow their unreasonable orders. I want to be my own person, follow my own passions.”
“A guy.”
“That sounds wonderful, Dean.”
“Yeah, definitely. I mean, Sam and I will prank each other, but we don’t just leave our shit everywhere. We both have boundaries, you know? That’s definitely reasonable, man. Agreeing to a date isn’t a good option either, I’m guessing?”
“Sorry, Dean, I know you don’t need this right now.”
“He’s just… a dorky… little guy. We’re friends.”
“Dude, you don’t need to keep pretending to be surprised when I show up like this. We both know you don’t mind.”
“Dean.” Cas hissed, forcing him on to his back, his shirt and skin slick with fresh blood around a deep laceration across his abdomen. “You are not fine.”
There stood Jensen shirtless, face to face with another man, both heated from shouting at one another.
Jensen licked at his lower lip, then moved quickly over to the door where they hung from.
“What? Was I singing it wrong? I don’t have a great voice, I know.”
Jensen flushed with embarrassment, giving a silly smile in agreeance. He quickly cleared his throat, straightening his coat before changing the subject.
Cas’s bones gave out, falling to his knees. ”What's going to happen to Gabriel, my parents? They just buried Michael, and now…”
“Hi, I am Lisa Braeden, Dean’s girlfriend.” she chirped offering her hand to shake. “Congratulations.”
“You heard him, Dylan.”
Dean noticed the dozens of eyes on them.
“I got pulled over a couple months ago leaving a club in L.A. My lawyer was able to keep it out of the press thankfully, and the judge’s wife turned out to be a fan so...he agreed to drop the charges if I agreed to attend a treatment facility. So I did. 30 days. Just got out yesterday.”
“What I miss?” he asked, wrapping his arm around Jensen’s waist with a smile.
“And now for the best part.” Castiel revealed with a wink to Sam as he spooned a thick layer of ground beef mixed with what looked to be mixed with peas and onions?
-raspberries
“Wow. Ok then. Look, Misha, before anything else is said, there’s something important I need to tell you....”
“It’s a celebration. I figured we’d win.” Dean gloated arrogantly.
“Would you shut up, I was not going to go into details, all I was going to say was it was not...THIS.”
Knock! Knock! Knock!
“Please don’t leave me...I love-”
“I have been calling you, and calling you all day. Coach came to your house…”
Misha cursed viciously under his breath. “It’s hot tea. Don’t you ever knock?”
“Got locked out,” he explained.
“ I should just go to work….I….”
“Novak is right you know. You need to focus on this game. I won’t let anything happen to him. We talked. I’ll keep an eye on him. You boys are like my family, and there is nothing more important than that.” Singer promised his star player.
“What are you doing? Where are your keys?” Cas asked as he noticed Dean sliding down a bit in the seat to reach under the dashboard.
“Should I call back tomorrow, then?” he asked with an all knowing smile as he hung up the phone.
“D I’m fine ! I got it!” Cas crowed.
Tongues clashing and clinging to one another like their lives depended on it, Jensen’s hands made their way down to Misha’s supple hips, gripping them tightly he led him backwards, pulling the raven hair man down to straddle him on the new office couch. Every moan, every whimper encouraged the other to stroke faster, grind harder, thrust deeper, reveling in the sight of one another climaxing in the grip of the other’s hand.
“What is all this? You living here?”
His apartment was on the way to Bobby’s; there was no way he was going in this oversized suit.
Suddenly, the door slowly opened. Jensen’s face rigid with anger.
Dean smiled once again on cue, deep down truly gracious to each person who stopped by to see him and extended their congratulations and good luck wishes; but he hadn’t been able to concentrate since this morning. He and Cas had met up at the lake for some very early morning breakfast and some fishing off the dock, which ended in the back seat of his car.
“Me too.”
“Hey. Are you with that show that’s here this weekend?” The man behind the counter asked.
“Misha. I got the feeling he wanted to talk to you, but he just dropped off breakfast and left. Said he was leaving.”
“What are you babbling about now?” Uriel sighed.
“Matt! Yes, sorry, early morning and not enough coffee. Nice to meet you, welcome to the show.”
Dean dropped the other bag on to the ground, and moved towards him.
“Well, if it isn’t my very best man, and your very best woman...Jensen.” Cas said cautiously, picking up the bat from home plate and placing it in his bag.
“In love.” Cas added. “It wasn’t right Dean, but it’s that same love...that did make it right. ”
They only have one year left...
“Cas, does this look like I made this for Lisa? Let’s see: Pringles, Cheese Whiz... which is disgusting I might add, and Dr. Pepper. All your favorite awful foods.”
“Listen, whatever she said, she was upset...she had no idea what she was talking about...I…”
Dean reached Cas’s house in minutes, relieved to see his bedroom light was still on. Wiping a bit of sweat from his brow, he reached down and grabbed a few seed husks from the ground and tossed them up towards his window. Nothing. He tried again, no response. Frustrated, he re-tied his shoes and headed up the tree that stood perfectly outside his window, stepping softly on each branch so as not to disturb his sure to be sleeping parents.
“Mr. Collins, there must be some sort of misunderstanding...”
“Look at me. What do you want to do?” We can stay here, like this, or we go back, find each other just like we did before and live the life we had stolen from us.”
Jensen didn’t say another word before slamming the door in his face.
“What? Where did that come from?” Misha wondered.
“Please Rita, I told you to call me Misha.” the man in the boxers added flushing a bit from embarrassment.
Still nothing.
"Hey. Hey. Hey. Take it easy." Dean cooed, helping his bloodied friend to his feet, guiding him to a park bench nearby. Checking his wounds, Cas grimaced, pulling away from him in an attempt to save himself from the pure humiliation he was feeling.
“Yeah. That’s it. Tied one on pretty good, had to be escorted back to his room.”
Minutes before reaching Bobby’s house, the Impala careened off of the road down an embankment...landing upside down.
The Hawkeyes were unstoppable. Win after win, the team continued to develop and grow. The stands were full at every game, and they always included the players girlfriends, with Lisa sitting front and center. For the past four years it was tradition that when Dean was up to bat, he would point his bat towards her before he stepped into the batter's box...a crowd favorite needless to say. Cas, perched on the back of the dug out bench with a handful of sunflower seeds, smiled to himself as the crowd cheered and swooned over their golden boy who had become the closest thing he ever had to a best friend over the last couple months walked up to the plate.
“I was embarrassed, ashamed, for the longest time I thought there was something wrong with me, I thought it would go away, and that if I told you...you’d hate me. And then losing Michael...I couldn't bear the thought of hurting you...either of you. And the only reason I am telling you right now is because other people know now, and I didn’t want them to find out that way.”
Cas tapped the ground with his bat, digging his cleats deep into the dirt before pulling up to take his stance in the batter’s box as the jeers continued. Dean’s green eyes barreled down at him as Cas gave him his most arrogant grin. Dean let out a grunt as he wound up, releasing a pitch that came right at him, forcing Cas back onto the ground. A roar of laughter and high fives imploded from the dugout while Cas stood up and composed himself, refusing to wipe the dirt off of his once clean white pants. Dean gave him a nod, not saying a word, as Cas lifted his bat upwards, pointing it at the ‘pleased with himself pitcher' first, before lifting it all the way up to the sky; he was calling his shot.
“Stop with the dramatics.” Uriel groaned “We must be patient. They now know this is special, they just need more time to figure out how special it really is. This is just lust...and confusion my friend. We need the real thing. We need love.”
“I SAID STOP GOD DAMNIT!” Dean bellowed, grabbing his arm, only to have it ripped away from him when Cas turned around, his face tense, eyes stricken with welled up tears. “Talk to me! Now!”
Misha went right into business mode, schmoozing with other executives, and apologizing for his tardiness. G.M. officially introduced the new executive producer and head writer to everyone in attendance to thunderous applause, and scripts were handed out to peruse at the extravagant breakfast buffet that had been prepared. G.M. carried on and on the entire time, sometimes even with a mouth full of eggs about how he was up most the night reading and re-reading the new script, amazed by how truly revolutionary this show would now be when compared to the others in the genre of the daytime television with the hopes of connecting with audiences of all ages.
Practice went as usual, the team looked good, real good, and Coach Singer seemed confident in his speech that this team had a real good chance against the reigning champs. As the team dispersed back to the locker rooms, Coach Singer pulled Dean aside.
Maybe it’s possible. Maybe this could be a good thing.
“You are,” Cas insists. “Dean. I meant everything I told you. You are a good, loving man, and you absolutely deserve love in return.”
“Yeah?”
He pauses. “I don’t know, Charlie. I sure as hell wouldn’t call it a crush, because I am a grown man, but there’s something there, you know?”
“I always make fun of him, but I would do anything for him.”
“You are so annoying.”
{from Dean to Cas} wow good luck
“I will. But fine, I’ll let you get out of the conversation. Got anything to watch while we wait for the cookies to bake?”
“How’s Sam? I haven’t seen him in a while, he’s always off being busy, it’s weird.”
Castiel laughs. “Still both obnoxious and giant, although that’s not quite how I would have phrased it.”
“Huh,” says Dean after an echoing silence. “Should we maybe have asked him some other questions before he left?”
“Oh, damn, Jo, I’m sorry.” Dean hadn’t liked Jo’s boyfriend, had thought he was too pushy and had an annoying voice, had hated how the guy had been rude to him and Sam the time they had dinner together, but he knows Jo liked him and he knows when to shut up and be supportive. “I ate all the ice cream last week when Lisa and me broke up and I haven’t been to the store to get more but we can make cookies if you want?”
He shuts his laptop. “Are you alright?”
Dean is not in love with Castiel.
As Dean starts to stand up, Cas puts a hand on his shoulder. “Dean.”
The bus comes to a halt just as Dean is trying to breathe enough to be able to formulate a response, and he realizes that it’s his stop. He blinks at Cas, who smiles and gently guides him off the bus.
{from Dean to Cas} you like bees?
him – maybe he really does.
Before anyone can say anything else, he fades away into an outline of light and then nothing.
“It’s nice to meet you, Dean. I’m headed to the university. Is that convenient for you?”
“Of course I do,” he says, sounding wounded. “Come on, Cas, I know I’m not great at saying what I’m feeling, but I thought you knew that, at least. You’re – you’re my best friend. You’re
The library is filled with utter stunned silence, broken by Dean yelping, “What the
“And which of the annoying relatives are you?” he tosses back.
Cas turns around to say something to whoever’s driving the car, then leans back out. “Would you like a ride?”
Dean shrugs and lets Castiel call for a cab as he shoots off a text to Sam telling him what’s up, sneaking a picture of Castiel so Sam will know who to look for in case anything goes wrong.
“We owe Sam twenty dollars, holy shit,” Jo mutters to Charlie.
He doesn’t say this, doesn’t feel like he can over the lump in his throat, but he pats Cas on the arm awkwardly, and from the way the skin around Cas’s eyes crinkles he thinks maybe he gets it anyway.
“Dean, I’m being serious.”
She nods. She looks just uncomfortable enough to make Dean wonder.
{from Dean to Cas} of course you do
Sam makes an aborted noise that sounds suspiciously like a laugh, and Dean elbows him, face red.
“Wow, really?”
“No. Well, yes. But not just that. I’m trying to tell you that… that it’s not just you.”
“There you go,” Cas says, handing the phone back with a smile.
Dean starts aggressively setting the table to distract himself from the tears that are definitely not threatening to well up at all. “Yeah, okay, enough with the chick flick shit,” he mutters after clearing his throat.
Cas frowns. “You just look troubled.”
Dean has been doing something on his phone, and after a few minutes Cas hears a ringing like he’s making a phone call. There’s no answer, and Dean swears softly and redials. No answer, redial, no answer.
“Dean, is this what you wanted to talk about?”
“I understand that I’m coming across as a bit like a stalker, but I promise I’m not. Where are you going?”
but. It’s always been a something that’s remained unspoken, not something to look at directly. Flirty texts, though. That’s new.
“I wish. He says he’ll stop one if I accept the other, which is beyond irritating. I think it’s reasonable to want my own living space to be respected.”
He stands up and starts to move forward to ask him to change him back, but Jack is already gone.
Dean, never one to be cowed by heavenly authority, scoffs and says, “Who cares what we call him? Look, all that matters is that he got us back online.” There’s a distinct tone of pride there, and Cas supposes this means that Jack is finally redeemed in Dean’s eyes, which is a good thing.
“Do you want to talk about it?” he asks as they roll out the dough.
“Oh, uh… you’re welcome?” Dean very deliberately avoids looking at Sam, who is translating for Eileen with raised eyebrows.
about this, Dean.
Cas is clearly startled, his fingers digging sharply into Dean’s shoulder.
“Both. Dean, I cannot tell you how much it means to me that you would care so much.”
“Something time sensitive? I’ve noticed you on the bus before and you always seem like you’re in a rush.”
“It’s good. We’re coming to the end of a semester. I had a good group of students, so I’ll be sad to see them go, but I have fewer classes next semester so I’ll be glad to have some time to relax.”
Dean doesn’t know what to say to that. He doesn’t know how a typical weekly commute to work has become a time to talk about his personal life. He doesn’t know how this random stranger has become someone who knows enough about him to read his emotions like that when he usually doesn’t show his emotions to anyone. He doesn’t know how he’s gotten to a point where hearing someone tell him he’s fucking
“Matt. He’s a doctor.”
“So you just don’t like sex?”
God, and Castiel is so unbelievably proud of how he has turned out.
“And your brother?”
{from Cas to Dean} Charlie and Jo. I was getting coffee and they came over and asked if my name was Cas and if I knew you. Apparently they recognized me from your description of me as “a hot little guy with brown hair and stupidly blue eyes and a trench coat”
“Dean.”
“Dean.”
A cruel smile. “Well, you’ve always kind of been the Winchesters’ little pet, haven’t you?” Before Cas can try to dispute that, Chuck snaps his fingers, and Cas gasps as he is overtaken by an indescribable, borderline painful sensation that rips through his body and seems to make the world around him shift; it’s not like anything he’s ever experienced, really, but it’s not entirely distant from how it felt the first time he poured his true self into a vessel.
“Yeah, no. Um. My mom died when I was a kid and my dad took it pretty hard. He got it into his head that he should be the one to hunt down her killer and all other killers, dragged us around the whole country, kind of became a vigilante. He got killed fighting an arsonist a few years ago.”
“What are friends for?” Dean shrugs. “Not like I have anything better to do. And hey, I’m curious about your weird family.”
Dean still doesn’t like the bus. It’s full of weird people, and personal space doesn’t exist, and it’s dirty and loud. None of that will ever change. But these days he’s finding it a lot harder to hate it. The bus, after all, is what brought Castiel into his life.
“I do not perform asexual reproduction, no. Asexuality in humans is simply a sexual orientation just like homosexual or heterosexual or bisexual. It means I do not experience sexual attraction.”
jeez. I can eat a pint of ice cream if I want. Where is it?” She is starting to sound more frantic, and when he looks up at her Dean can see now that there are dried tear tracks down her face.
He smiles in a way that he hopes is convincing and lets her hug him before she goes out to make the call. After she’s gone, he leans against the car for a long moment, eyes closed, before sighing and getting back to work.
the infamous Dean our Cassie has been mooning over.”
“And, uh. What about Cas?”
Dean blinks. “What, me and Miracle?”
Dean rubs a hand over his face. “Damn it,” he mutters. “I don’t need this today.”
Cas is bracing himself to say something, anything – an apology, maybe, for accepting such an intimate position in their lives rather than trying to figure out a way to show them who he was – when Dean nods decisively, stands up, and pulls Cas into a hug.
“Hell, yeah, enough of the chick flick moments. What do you want to talk about?”
Cas chuckles. “In any other family, it probably would be, yes. But as I think I’ve mentioned, my family is odd and traditional, with firm ideas of how everyone should live their lives. We – they – have a company, a rather large one that’s been in the family for centuries. Everyone in the family is expected to work for the company, and to go elsewhere is seen as an unforgivable betrayal.”
“Hey, Sam.”
“Really?”
“Come on, buddy,” Dean says fondly, getting to his feet and opening the back door of the car, “Let’s sit in here while we wait for Sammy.”
“Yeah, I know, I gave in too. But a lot of it is also crap.”
“That makes sense. You have a right to be upset, Dean.”
Sam coughs. “Well, we’re really glad you’re back, Cas. Thanks for… clearing this up, Jack.”
But fuck, there’s something about this guy, some kind of connection.
Suddenly the clouds are replaced by bright yellow and the rain stops falling on his head. He looks around to see a guy in a trenchcoat standing next to him and holding an umbrella over both of their heads.
“I know.” She leans against him so their shoulders touch. “I know we’ve all been teasing you about it, but do you actually have a crush on him?”
“No. I don’t know. Maybe. I don’t know. Get out of my house.”
“What? Don’t look at me like that.”
Cas looks considering at that. “That would make sense, actually,” he muses. “That would also explain why Balthazar was so hard to find.”
“That’s ridiculous.”
“Maybe that’s not a bad thing? I mean, lots of people have people they can talk to about personal stuff. It can be helpful. Hey, Charlie and Jo and I have been trying to get you to open up more for years. If this Cas guy can do it, maybe he’s good for you. You like him?”
“No, Sammy. Well, I mean, yes, I’ve been talking to a guy on the bus, but it’s not like that.”
{from Cas to Dean} *series of holiday emojis*
“Hey. The dog is here?”
He’s a dog. Fantastic.
“Hey, Lisa,” he says through a forced smile.
Cas, I need you to know how much I appreciate you saving me, again, but I also need you to know that I miss you like hell, and I can’t accept your goodbye being final. I wasn’t ready to say goodbye to you. I’m gonna get you home. I don’t know how, but I promise you, I am not leaving you there.”
“Yeah, I guess,” he says gruffly.
He looks up as Dean splashes over, and smiles. Dean nods an acknowledgment. The bus pulls up a moment later, and they all board. The bus is more crowded than usual, probably because of the rain, so Dean and the guy are both forced to stand. They jostle against each other with every turn, and on one particularly big pothole the man is thrown into Dean hard enough that Dean has to grab him around the waist to keep them both from falling.
“Oh. Um, ok.”
“I have one more use for you. You’re going to give them one last shred of hope and joy, and then I’m going to rip it away. You inspired me, actually, so thanks for that.”
Without fully thinking about it, he goes running across the street. Jack smiles at him, but doesn’t seem inclined to interact, and the brothers are busy staring around at the populated town and don’t notice him, so he just settles on the sidewalk by the side of the Impala to listen to their conversation.
Sam is the first to recover. “Um. Hi, Jack. Good to see you. What’s up?”
Dean groans, wipes his face with his hands. Cas is about to come offer someone to cuddle with, which Dean seems to enjoy though he probably would never use that word to describe it, but then he starts talking again.
He takes a small step closer. “Cas, what you said… it surprised me, and it was hard to process, especially since you waited to say it until we were about to die, but I think I needed to hear it. All of it. The stuff about how I see myself – I can’t say it was fun for me to be, I don’t know, exposed like that, but you’re right. And man, I want to be the person you think I am. I want to be able to believe that I could ever be worthy of being – being loved that much.”
“She’s all right. She remembers what happened, but she doesn’t remember being… gone. She’s going to meet us back at the bunker.”
She grabs his hand and squeezes. “Dean, when you’re texting him you get this smile I’ve only ever seen on you around your family and Dr Sexy, and that was the same kind of smile he had when we talked about you. This is going to be a good thing.”
“We have had far worse family gatherings, but we have also certainly had better.”
“Chuck pulled me from the Empty and turned me into a dog so he could use me as a prop in his plan to torment you,” he explains. “Of course you would have no idea it was me, and he could have just as easily used an actual dog, but he thought it was funny.”
Still, he cannot shake his distress, as he wanders around the outside of the station, finding no signs of human or animal life.
Cas is one of the best people Dean knows, and he’s tired of lying to himself about just how crazy he is for him. As Dean watches, Cas laughs at something a cousin says, and he looks so happy, and the sound is so beautiful. Dean wants to make him laugh like that forever.
“Exactly.”
“Oh, it’s interesting. They see me as young and innocent, sometimes foolish, but they are very protective of me. You have a younger brother, I’m sure you know what it’s like.”
And Dean wants to be in his life forever, and he’s tired of denying himself.
“It’s supposed to start at two.”
“I like your boyfriend,” Charlie says as she lets herself into Dean’s apartment.
“Not particularly. My siblings and I will spend Christmas together, and our extended family has a holiday party closer to New Year’s. My brother Gabriel will be staying with me for a while, although he hasn’t bothered to give me an estimated arrival date yet.”
“Oh. Did something happen?”
“The pleasure is all mine, Sam. I’ve heard so many good things.”
“Um, maybe because it was seven AM and I had to go to work? Plus, it’s not like I even know if he swings that way.”
“Oh, yes, we’re very close. They’re good people. Very different, but we get along well enough.”
“You found a dog?” Sam asks, stunned.
“That was fast.” The words come out harsher than he meant them to, and they both wince.
Dean puts his knife down with a sigh. “You remember I told you about my friend Cas from the bus?”
“You keep believing that.”
“Yes, of course. There’s a high likelihood of a major blizzard, it won’t be safe to be on the roads.”
“Yeah, well. I don’t know, we’re just really close and I don’t know what to think about it.”
Cas blinks.
“Dean, are you all right?”
“What, like allosexual? Yeah, I mean, I’ve been doing some research ever since you came out. I wanted to be sure I didn’t fuck up when I was talking to you.”
They’re in the middle of dinner – Dean in the middle of a sentence – when Sam puts his sandwich down and says, “Dean, are you seeing someone?”
“I’m fine. Jesus, what’s wrong with my face that everyone keeps asking me that?”
The bus pulls up to Dean’s stop and Cas promises to text him with details about time, location, and dress code, and Dean in turn assures him he’ll ask Sam. They say their goodbyes and Dean spends the rest of the day wondering what he’s signed himself up for.
“I don’t know, Dean. The bus?”
Cas chooses that moment to appear from behind a group of people. He’s breathing hard like he ran across the room, and Hannah is right behind him.
He shrugs. “If I don’t think about it too much I can convince myself it’s not a big deal.”
They stand in silence on the sidewalk for a long moment, just staring at each other.
“Well, you could have talked to him to maybe find out. It sounds like he made an impression on you, so if he’s on the bus again next week you should totally ask him out.”
“It’s not your fault.”
“Well, that sounds all right. Sammy and me usually do holidays pretty lowkey too, just us, but this year he’s got a girlfriend so it’s a little more complicated. We’re still doing Christmas day with just us, but on Christmas Eve we’re going to some kind of lunch thing with his girlfriend’s family. And then a few days later we’re having a little get together with some of our family friends.”
“Both, I suppose.”
{from Cas to Dean} He’s been here for less than an hour and has already left his stuff all over my apartment and is now trying to convince me to let him set me up on dates
“That’s one word for it,” Hannah says drily. “I’m going to go keep an eye on them before they blow something up again.” Sam and Dean blink. “It was nice seeing you again, Dean,” she says before they can ask. “And Sam, good to meet you.”
“You’re welcome, Dean.”
“Man, I don’t know, just talk. What are your siblings like?”
“Fair enough.”
{from Cas to Dean} To be fair we talked when we were strangers
“Yeah, good, good. Just… awesome.” He clears his throat to cut off his own babbling and claps a hand on the roof of the car. “So what seems to be the problem?”
“No, you’re wrong. Who are you again? Why are you here?”
“That bad?”
“Yes,” Cas says, and then he kisses the laughter out of Dean’s mouth.
“It’s okay, Dean.”
He profoundly hopes this transformation will not be forever, but he could live with it if it was.
As he hangs up the phone, it occurs to Dean that he’s been waiting for the bus for a while, and that no one else is there. Just as he thinks this, he hears someone call his name.
“So,” she asks after a moment of silence, “When are you going to ask him out?”
“You’re welcome! And I really should get going now. It was good to see you all again. I love you. Goodbye.”
“I still can’t believe you have a crush on someone who doesn’t get any of your references. He must be pretty special.”
The man’s eyes light up and a smirk flits across his face. “Ah-ha,” he says. “
It’s true, and it’s a good thought, but Dean’s voice is hollow, and Sam clearly hears it too. “Sure, that’s a nice way to think about it, I guess,” he says cautiously.
, but man, he’s
“What happened?” Cas looks hesitant, and Dean silently curses himself. “You don’t have to answer that. It’s personal, it’s none of my business, I get it, man.”
on me? What are you fucking
He nods, and then they’re both grinning, and hugging, and Dean can’t believe he gets to have this.
“He’s not my boyfriend. And I can’t believe you and Jo ambushed him like that in public. What if it hadn’t been him?”
“No problem, not your fault.”
“Likewise,” Sam says, grinning.
{from Cas to Dean} I think this has been the longest we’ve gone without seeing each other on the bus since we met
“Why do you have to be such a good guy, Dean?”
“This isn’t your stop,” Dean says eventually.
Dean jerks around in surprise to see hot trenchcoat guy. “What?”
“Dean, the guy is using
“Oh for fuck’s sake, have you been reading Charlie’s fanfiction too?”
I don’t even know your romantic orientation. Fuck, sometimes I think I don’t even know
“I really like him,” he admits softly.
than friends?”
“How are you?”
“Yeah, obviously I like him.”
about. Our families, our pasts, whatever. Personal shit. The other day we were talking about my relationship with Lisa. I don’t talk about this shit ever, but with him it just feels like the thing to do.”
“I’m asexual, Dean.”
“But what if you’re wrong and I go for it and I mess everything up?”
he missed, you know?” Oh no, there it is, the joy and hope, and Cas is starting to see Chuck’s plan. “By the way, this guy is coming home with us,” Dean adds, and Cas’s heart is warm at the idea of it, but he’s struck by gut-wrenching certainty that he won’t be.
“I can be in the holiday spirit without watching this. And I do not have a Cas face.”
“Yeah, you too, Cas. I met your brother.”
“Fuck, fuck, fuck.” Dean stares dejectedly at the rear bumper of the bus he’s supposed to be on as it quickly gets smaller in the horizon.
“And I do?” He nudges at Dean to make him lift his face so he can kiss his forehead and then look in his eyes. “Dean, I may be a great deal older than you, but you know the extent of my relationship experience. And there has never been anything like the enormity of what I feel for you. This isn’t even something an angel is supposed to feel. I don’t know what I’m doing either. But I have faith that together, we can figure it out. And I think it will be worth it.”
Laughing, Chuck says, “You’re adorable. Yeah, this is gonna tug the heartstrings for sure.”
“Busy. This freaking snow is killing me. How was that thing with your family?”
And he’s willing to admit now, at least to himself, in the silence of his own room, that he
“Well, that’s good, Dean, I’m glad you’re making a friend.”
The week is busy. People come in whose cars died over the three days when the garage was closed, and other people crash their cars as soon as there’s a thin layer of ice. Cas isn’t on the bus on Thursday because he has to prepare for his family’s big party, and okay, maybe Dean misses him a little. They text back and forth every day, though, and it makes Dean’s exhausting week a little better. Charlie can shut up about him having a special happy face when Cas texts, because that is obviously blatantly false, that would be embarrassing, but. Maybe he does smile a little when he hears the phone vibrate.
Sam goes to get Jack – and Cas whines at the mixed emotions of wanting to see his son but not wanting to be used to hurt him. Cas lets Dean load him into the backseat and continue petting him, muttering about how he’s the best thing that’s happened in the last few days, and maybe his tail wags a little despite himself. It’s then that he suddenly feels himself rapidly start fading away, and he just barely gets a glimpse of Dean’s expression of horror before there is Nothing.
“Oh, yes, but it’s all very complicated.”
“Still.”
“What do you mean?”
Lisa coughs. “I. Um.”
“Well, my aunt Naomi and my uncle Metatron were upset about something, and my uncle Raphael kept glaring at me for some reason.”
“You and Castiel. I’m sorry I didn’t fix your situation earlier. And Dean, I have to thank you for praying last night.”
“Hey, so I was reading this thing online the other day,” Dean says, trying to get his heartbeat under control when Cas rests his hand on his shoulder to brace himself as he leans in closer to hear him. “It was talking about asexuality and using a metaphor about elephants or something to explain how it’s hard for ace people and allosexual people to talk about attraction because it’s so obvious for us but how are you guys supposed to know what it’s like if you’ve never experienced it? It was pretty interesting, I thought you might like it.”
Things go blurry for a bit, and then he feels… different, like his form has altered somehow, and everything around him seems larger.
“So does this mean that you… I mean… What do we call you?” Sam asks Jack awkwardly.
“Hey Ma. Thank you..”
The angels cleared their throats loudly as they moved to stand by their sides.
“Back in my day you needed a couch for this kind of creative process, and a closed door.”
Misha hung up his phone, and made his way back over to them.
Blood. Cries of pain. The sounds of sirens.
“Good Morning Mr. Ackles, how can I help you?” the young lady asked, her cheeks a little flush from just the sight of him.
“I need to kiss you. Now. So hurry up.” Dean instructed as he picked up the handles of the wheelbarrow and walked off, heading towards the equipment shed.
“God? I know what you must think of me, but I am still your child, your servant, and I need your help right now. Please. I need you to help me find Cas. I need you to help me because I can’t be without him; he’s my soulmate. I love him and I promise you that I will love and protect him the rest of my life, and follow in your word. I know you say it is a sin, but how can it be when he is your greatest creation?” Dean stood up from his knees as the sounds of the storm began to rumble in.
“You said you lived around here right? Let’s go there first.”
“Yes,” Cas continued. “Just like a vacation, and I promise, I will be back. Ok? Now, how about I sing you your favorite song and tuck you back in just the way you like it, snug as a bug in a rug. Does that sound good?”
“My head is fucking killing me. You got anything for me to take?” he growled, before plopping down on the edge of the bed.
- real whip cream
“I’ve...you know, with Lisa, but THIS is different? I mean, have you ever…you know.”
“Fine! But you owe me.” she scolded him as they made their way out of the lobby.
They immediately noticed his attire; or lack thereof.
“Whatcha doin?” A voice asked from behind him. It was Lisa.
Cas froze. “What did you say?”
Cas turned around to see the star player before him with his arm draped over a brunette he remembered from his economics class.
Christmas was upon them, only 24 hours to go, and the bunker was a buzz as the AU visitors prepared for a feast. Gifts were wrapped under the elegant spruce that Bobby has chopped down himself, decorated with homemade trinkets. Castiel laid a gift softy under the tree, giving the hand written tag a pat, “To: Sam From: Castiel.” A small grin escaped his lips as he thought about how excited Sam will be to receive a new pair of gloves; his were so full of holes. Jack’s gift laid nestled next to it, but he was still missing one: Dean. He had been to every store, searched the internet for the perfect gift, but alas he was still empty handed and Christmas was tomorrow. Running his hands down his face  he stood up, finding himself face to face with the eldest Winchester.
“It’s a very good name Cas.” he answered, kissing him atop his head.
The days leading up to the big day were spent on Jensen’s family farm in Kansas,  lazily swaying in an old soft cotton hammock wrapped around one another, visiting people and places they never thought they would see again...and saying the goodbyes they were never given the chance to say. Now standing over Coach Bobby Singer’s grave, Cas gripped Dean’s hand a little tighter. Here lies the man who accepted them before they had even truly accepted themselves, who believed in love above all. Tears began to trickle down both of their cheeks.
“Hey. Calm down. What is going on? Why are you here?”
"Dean I don't know...what I am doing, I've never done this before." Dean closed the gap between them, their eyes met, as Dean took his hands.
“I am leaving tomorrow Cas! My dad got me a spot for an earlier camp and you were nowhere to be found, and I don’t want to leave you, but I can’t…..”
“Jensen? Misha?” Gabriel uttered, a look of disbelief on his face. “You both...you’re ok?”
“Is there anything else I can do? I’ve already contacted their families, they are on their way.” G.M. asked.
“Now Dean, calm down, and take a deep breath. It’s all going to be ok. Go back in, I will be right back.” Bobby promised as he drove away.
Minutes ticked by like hours until Bobby finally returned. Dean looked up at him from the dinner table and got his answer with a look and a shake of his head. A round of laughter erupted, around him which he entertained with a smile as sheer panic began to set in.
"What? Watch the fucking game man! Put all this shit down." He demanded, picking the pile of papers upland plopping it down on the coffee table.
“There isn’t anything wrong with you. And I have done some reading on this so called ‘conversion therapy’. It’s wrong Dean, and you’re not going. That's final.”
Time passed. The rain had stopped.
“And?” Uriel responded.
“There is plenty of air right here in our backyard, and this is your party. Now go back into that house, put your cap and gown back on and greet your guests….they’ve been waiting.” She demanded, snatching his keys from his hands.
“Let me guess. You're fine? You’re like a broken record with that shit man. Let me see.” Dean pulled back Cas’ shirt to expose his shoulder; the bruising was deep. “Nothing broken right?” he questioned, rotating Cas’ arm forwards, then backwards.
“G.M.? You know the Network Executive, just told them his real last name is Novak!”
Jensen slammed the door behind him with a smile. With a sense of relief, he turned back around, surprised to see Misha in his kitchen, nosing around in his refrigerator.
“What?” Dean said, looking baffled.
The party at centerfielder Garth Fitzgerald's farmhouse just outside the city lines had been planned for weeks; including the biggest bonfire anyone would ever see in their life. Garth’s dad distilled his own whisky, so there was plenty to drink. Everyone was there, except Dean and Lisa, who some had said they had seen arguing in Dean’s car since the moment the crowds cleared. Cas stood looking into the bonfire vacantly as the rest of the team danced and howled like primitive cavemen around it, throwing more and more accelerant on to the fire. He was startled by Garth, placing his hand on his shoulder, then handing him a bottle of whisky. “We couldn’t have done it without you Novak.” he said. “To CAS!” Garth bellowed, the team echoing his cheer. Cas, nodded, holding up the bottle then taking a sip. To his surprise, he has been named the team’s MVP, and was presented a large trophy by Dean Winchester himself after the game. He couldn’t help but wonder where he was as he took another swig from the bottle...and then another.
Taking the stairs, he arrived at Misha’s room, banging on the door with all the strength he had in him. No answer. He heard the ding of the elevator and yelled for anyone to hold it!
Then a cell phone rings.
To minimize the confusion:
“Knew what? Wait. You don’t mean...about us? How?! I haven’t told anyone Dee...”
“D...where are we?”
“Damn.That box wine really is good.” he responded as if not to be listening, opening up the fridge to get some more.
“Jesus, Dean! After all these years, STILL with the ‘it’s gotta be perfect’ shit! Get on with it! We don’t have all day!” Cas squaked with a smile.
Feeling just like they were 18 again, they raced each other down to the field, taking their places if no time had passed, once again. Dean got right to work, digging his black dress shoe’s heel  into the clumped dirt on the pitcher’s plate. Cas, with a bat in hand, giving it a few swings before letting out a huge dramatic sigh, then banging it on home plate.
“We can’t be late!” she continued.
“Mine.” he gloated, nosing at his sack, taking it into his mouth, before finally making his way up Jensen’s shaft with the tip of his tongue.
“What are you talking about?”
Dean removed his pants, tossing them to join his shirt in the trash can, sighing with his entire body, “You didn't think I heard did you? Told you, I saw, and heard everything."
Another fax. It was time to go.
Silence. Again.
“Ok! Almost ready!” he yelped before slamming his door closed. “5 minutes is plenty of time,'' he whispered as they fell onto his bed together.
Cas moved to lay next to him, taking his hand in his, kissing the back of it tenderly. Dean turned to face him, wrapping his other hand around his.
“What’s going on here? And why do you keep calling him Cas? Is this some sort of sick joke?”
“Only you.” Jensen promised, as his hands roamed over Misha’s shoulders before his hands traveled down between the writer’s legs, stroking his already hardening cock through his jeans.
Both men agreed, and made their way over to the couch to watch the game. An hour passed with both of them howling & screaming at the game. It was the bottom of the 9th, 2 outs, 2 men on, the game was tied 3 to 3.
“It’s for Sam.” he answered.
“Me too, Cas.” Jensen whispered back.
“How does it feel to be 35, my handsome boy? I woke up this morning sure that this is going to be your best year yet!” she squealed.
“It’s hot.” he complained, just as another person had approached him to take a picture.
Current Day-Burbank California
When the party was finally over, Dean walked Bobby out to his car.
“He said when they fell in love. That was just sex Balthazar. Drunk, back seat car sex. There’s a difference.” Uriel reminded him.
Jensen didn’t say a word, his eyes averting to the floor.
“Yeah Coach, just thinking. I’m thinking...there's something about this year that feels different...like this is our year...you know?” Dean responded.
Uriel stood facing the living room wall, softly banging his head on it.
“Sorry. I fucked up. I really fucked.”
“No. My dad got me a spot at that place soon, and I can’t get a hold of Novak. He’s not answering. Coach we are going to have to leave tonight, and I don’t know what to do!”
“Ok!” he yelled back breathless, as Cas moved his affections down his neck, nibbling and nipping at his skin.
“Maybe.” Cas confessed with a laugh.
The surge of adrenaline that followed Dean’s sudden survival hit Cas with all it’s might at that very moment. He began to pace, his hand running forcefully through his raven hair, before wrestling with other. Dean’s eyes followed him as he pulled off his blood soaked shirt, wadding it up before shooting it in to a nearby trash can.
Finally making it to the main floor, he ran out towards the front desk, desperate to catch his breath and Misha.
“That was just their souls calling out to one another subconsciously. Even they know they are running out of time.”
Misha let out a sigh, then slowly rubbed his forehead. “Look, the writing team for this show has never won. This is as much for you as it is for them! You will be given strong, gritty dialogue giving you a chance to really act, not just...react.”
The two men looked around the room, then down at their bodies covered in medical wires, and finally at one another.
“Humans cannot handle change.” Uriel observed. “They would never be able to survive anywhere outside this blue marble of theirs..”
“Terrible! And old! I know!” he said as they both began to laugh hysterically. “But we did it Dean! I can’t believe it, but it worked. I found you! You found me!”
Misha nodded as he picked through the sad looking bowl of fresh fruit. “I’m one of their writers, I’m Misha.” he added, reaching out to shake the man’s hand.
When the party was finally over, Dean walked Bobby out to his car.
“What the hell?! Cas?! You ok? What the hell is wrong with you guys! He is one of us!” Dean yelled at his teammates.
Dean opened his, reaching his hand out towards him…
Misha looked at the door once again to make sure he had the right room.
“Gabriel, what are you doing awake? Did the storm scare you? This is my friend Dean, can you say hi?” Cas asked sweetly. Gabriel shook his head no, and hugged his brother around the neck tight.
Arriving with only minutes to spare, Jensen bee lined it to this dressing room to get ready, as
“No! Not that.Trust me.”
“You mean Rachael Ray?” Sam inquired.
“Damnit!” he hissed at the scalding hot water that was now burning his legs. Misha kicked off his shoes, undid his belt, and pulled off his pants, checking to see if there were any serious burns.
“I don’t want to get up.”
“What can I say, I was never much for Chuck’s rules.” Dean reminded him. "Look Cas…"
Within the hour, the storm hung over the city, crashes of lightning and thunder filled his dark room. Everyone was asleep, and it was time to go. Jump starting his car, he pulled out in a hurry, never looking back, and headed towards Cas’s house. The sheets of rain were making visibility more and more difficult. Dean had to drive slower than he hoped, as his windshield wipers were losing the battle. He finally arrived, pulling his hood over his head, he ran out of the car, bypassing the door and climbing straight up the tree that he had before, and pounded on Monty’s window. No answer. How could this be happening? Where the hell was he? Dean tried one more time, and was stunned when Castiel’s sleepy face appeared in the window. He pushed his window open, the rain poured in along with Dean.
“Compliment me?”
“Well, you shouldn’t have to. He should respect your wishes.”
“Ah. You mentioned your brother but not – and not that this is any of my business, especially since this is really only the second time we’ve talked – not your parents or any other family?”
He comes back on a small town street bustling with human activity. Physically shaking off the shock like water – because he is still a dog, fur and all – he looks around and sees Dean, Sam, and Jack standing across the street, which explains the return of humanity. With a jolt, he realizes that Jack is radiating immense power that is new to him, yet also familiar, and a moment later he recognizes why.
Dean beams as his brother takes Cas’s hand.
“Our families are very different, I think. Gabriel has no shame and no boundaries. I love my brother, but it can be frustrating.”
“Well, I doubt you’ll like most of them, but I’m sure it will be an interesting experience for you if nothing else. Thank you so much, Dean.”
“Hello Dean.”
“Woah, what a dick.”
Sam is frowning. He can tell even though he’s not looking up.
{from Dean to Cas} so how’s your holiday
“I resent that!” Gabriel protests.
He stares at her. “What?”
“They aren’t bad, exactly, they just have certain ideas of how the family should run and how we should carry out our lives and I happen to disagree with some of those ideas at times.”
“Okay,
it to be a good thing. He wants it, wants
He snaps again, and suddenly Cas is alone in front of a service station in the middle of nowhere.
He shrugs. “Like if you’ve been acquaintances with someone for a couple months but you only talk once a week and you always have really personal conversations, is that weird?”
She crosses the room to stand near the brothers. Cas and the Winchesters keep talking until Cas sighs and says that he should socialize with more of his family, and then they awkwardly follow him around the room.
Dean glances at the back of the car while Lisa describes the liquid. It’s already starting to drip a little, and he sighs. “I’ll have to take a closer look but there’s a possibility that it could be a head gasket. Do you have someone who can give you a ride so I can keep it here overnight?”
And Dean doesn’t know, but maybe it could be a good thing.
“Yes. I’m Hannah. It’s nice to finally meet you, Dean.”
“There’s nothing to tell, Jo. He let me share his umbrella until the bus showed up and he was pretty cute but we didn’t talk or anything.”
“I teach anthropology.”
As days pass and they all try to adjust to their new lives, Cas learns that he dislikes almost all aspects of being a dog, but that being the
“It’s fine. He seems interesting, at least.”
Christmas comes and goes quickly and anticlimactically. The Christmas Eve dinner at Jess’s parents’ house is a little awkward since there are a lot of people and Dean doesn’t know anyone, but everyone is friendly and welcoming to both of the brothers, and dinner is delicious. The day itself is quiet, Dean and Sam exchanging their few small presents and then going out to lunch but not really doing anything else. Two days later, Sam, Jess, Ellen, Jo, Charlie, and Dean all go to Bobby’s, and they all eat well and laugh a lot and it’s great, it’s family, but the next day Dean is back at work like any other day.
“Sure, if you promise to be careful with my car.”
“You’ve got your Cas face on,” Charlie says as Dean presses send. “Are you complaining about me getting you in the holiday spirit?”
“No, not me. My brother went for a couple years before transferring out to Stanford when they were able to give him more money.”
“Hey, no, c’mon, Jo, I’m fine. You can’t help the timing. And Lisa and I hadn’t really been happy for a while anyway, I should be getting over it. Besides, it’s only fair, you had to deal with me moping around, now it’s my turn to deal with you.”
“So that was Hurricane Gabriel,” Dean says, and Cas rolls his eyes.
Dean blinks. “The Balthazar incident?”
“I mean, it’s not that big a deal, but my boss will be kind of pissed if I’m late.”
But maybe Dean has always been good at lying to himself, and at avoiding thinking about important things until someone forces him to.
He does not have a crush.
Castiel’s eyebrows raise. “That’s very impressive. What does he do?”
“I would have, but Gabriel spent most of the time reluctantly attempting to mediate the rather explosive argument my uncles Luke and Michael were having and Balthazar disappeared within five minutes. I think he might have been flirting with my cousin’s friend.”
this. But you know what? I really don’t care anymore. I kind of love it. I think it’s… poetic. It doesn’t hurt that it upset the Winchesters.”
“Where would I meet someone, Sam? You’re always complaining about how I never get out. Do you think I’m meeting people at Bobby’s?”
Dean has to lean in so he and Cas can hear each other over the noise of the oddly large crowd of commuters.
He tries to ask Chuck, towering over him, what he’s done to him, but all that comes out is a woof, and – oh. Oh. Now he processes what is different about his body. The four legs. The tail. The floppy ears.
Dean nods. He gets that. He spent enough sleepless nights agonizing about his and Sammy’s roles in the “family business” to understand the itch for freedom, the fear and guilt surrounding breaking free, the knowledge that the right choice isn’t always the one your loved ones want you to make.
Seeing Cas on the bus – talking to him about their lives, brushing arms as the bus goes over bumps, sharing smiles – it’s great, but it doesn’t make his stomach tingle and his cheeks heat up and his heart feel tight.
