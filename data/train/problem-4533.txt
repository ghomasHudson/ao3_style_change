When she's done with the tour, she herds him towards the changing rooms in spite of his muttered protests that he might come back another day.
He trails away, dropping his chin to his chest and taking in a deep, shuddering breath and he’s so wrought with sadness that Dean doesn’t think twice about what he does next. He moves into the shower, fully clothed in his tux and bowtie, and sits down next to Cas, toeing off his shoes and tossing them aside. He scoots in close, wrapping his arm tighter around Castiel’s trembling shoulders. He’s so cold, so worryingly cold. How can he stand this, sitting here freezing with the shower icy and the window open to allow a gale to blow in? He reaches up and turns the knob on the shower until the water runs warm and curls closer to a Castiel, rubbing his upper arms in an attempt to help. Castiel’s clothing is still chilled and must feel horrible, sticking to his skin everywhere. He doesn’t know what to do first, whether to get Cas out of the shower, out of his clothes and into a warm bed or to ask what the fuck is going on. A nauseating thought strikes him: this can’t be the fallout from their fight, surely? No way, Cas wouldn’t crumble like this just from Dean being an ass. Would he…?
“Nope.” Placing his hands on his knees to help himself stand, Dean inclines his head to Crowley. “It’s been a long day. I’m sure I’ll see you tomorrow,” then, as the waiter reappears as if from nowhere with a fresh decanter and clears away the empty one, he adds, “if there is one.”
has to be the single hottest person Dean’s ever seen in his life. And that includes Doctor Sexy, plus all the men in uniform he’d lusted after in his late teens. He’s like all of them combined, rolled up together into the dreamiest person to ever walk the face of the earth.
Jimmy Novak hasn't had the best few weeks. And it’s beginning to show. Three people at school have now taken him aside and asked if everything is alright. Each time he’s given them a brittle smile and said that he’s fine, he’s just having family troubles, he’s sure it will all blow over and everything will be back to normal soon. His colleagues have clapped him on the shoulder, told him to call if he needs anything, and carried on with their lives and Jimmy is trying valiantly to do the same.
Just him and Amara. The way they've always been.
He doesn't know what to say. ‘Sorry’ isn't enough, not by a mile, but equally the sound of her so upset that she's struggling to breathe is tugging unpleasantly on his heartstrings. He inhales slowly, exhaling through his mouth, trying to calm himself. He should never have taken this call.
“Yeah, I’m, uh, glad to meet you too.” Neutrons misfire as Dean mixes up his sentences, internally rolling his eyes at himself for being so utterly uncool. “Thanks for, you know, keeping us all safe. Thanks for that.”
He hears the slap echo around the kitchen before he feels it. His cheek flares with raw pain and he flinches back in shock. It isn't the first time she's hit him, nor is it the hardest, but it's enough to make him take a step away, his hand coming automatically to his face, feeling the heat drawn to the surface of his skin in the shape of her hand. She grabs his arm, her acrylic nails digging in fiercely and he knows there will be bruises later. Maybe even broken skin. That's happened before. Then she's in his face, her eyes burning with contempt and he swallows a burst of anxiety at the sight. He's frozen, rigid with shock as he always is whenever they fight like this.
“But you're not a couple,” Gabriel had persisted, with that look on his face like a dog with a bone. “She's not your girlfriend. Is she? You need a girlfriend, Cassie. Or a boyfriend. Whichever, I'm not prejudiced. As you know.” He’d wiggled his eyebrows and Castiel had groaned. Gabriel’s past is no secret to him but equally it's something he would rather not spend too much time thinking about.
A voice drifts from somewhere above him, deep and masculine with a mild note of irritations running through it, and Castiel peers up at whoever it is, wondering whether to tell him to get lost or ask for his help standing up. The fluorescent strip lights are in his eyes and a bead of sweat chooses that moment to track down from his eyebrow and momentarily blind him. When he's rubbed it away and focused, a pair of deep green eyes are staring down at him, narrowed in curiosity. Castiel blinks again, shifting back a little to take in the stranger standing over him. Dirty blonde hair darkened with sweat, cheekbones and jawline that could cut glass, and a confused frown. The guy is generically hot, probably much hotter when his t-shirt doesn't have sweat stains under the arms, but Castiel is struck with an instant and strong sense of dislike. It takes his brain a moment to catch up, but when he does he finds himself standing up and taking a step back, putting some distance between them.
He nods to the waiter who opens the glass panelled door to the smoking room for him, slipping a note into the man’s top pocket and nodding distractedly at the muttered thanks. A tense feeling of worry has settled itself beneath his sternum yet again, a feeling he can’t understand or explain, and he just wants to go to bed. He takes a detour on the way to his room, desperately in need of some air.
He kisses Cas’ forehead and pulls him into a tight hug, feeling the older man sigh and nod against his chest, relaxing into the embrace.
Personal life stuff and TW miscarriage: if you follow me on
His brother hasn’t moved; he’s still standing staring up at the clock, looking for all the world like a man waiting his turn for the gallows.
“Well,” Castiel says finally and Dean’s eyes snap up to his face. “I think we’ll be taking our seats. Nice to meet you all. Gabriel, we’ll have a drink later?”
The heat of the day has long passed by now, the enthusiasm and joyous atmosphere ebbing away for a while as the parade-goers take a break to chill out, freshen up, take a power nap, or do whatever they need to do to recharge before the night’s festivities begin. The streets are littered with rainbow glitter, coloured streamers, discarded items of clothing, and empty plastic bottles which Sam Winchester eyes with distaste. He’s already picked up what feels like a hundred and deposited them into the nearest trashcan, but he gave up hours ago - mostly due to Dean’s consistent eye-rolling.
I have to say, you're all overwhelming me with the positive responses to this story. This is not an easy topic to write about but one I felt like tackling, and the responses to each chapter have been fantastic. Thank you, and I'm sorry I've been shoddy at replying to comments ♥ I read every single one, probably multiple times!
His computer pings and he opens an email. It's a reply to a post of his on a forum for gardening enthusiasts. Even though his little apartment doesn't have a garden it does have a narrow fire escape that leads to the roof, and Castiel has quite a collection of plants growing up there that he loves to tend. It's his solace, his second love after his shop. Maybe he can spend an hour up there tonight. His plants make for good company.
“Hey,” He leans a hand on the kitchen island, watching as she pulls out a chair and sits down at the table with folded arms, staring coldly over at him. “Do we need to talk?”
“I used to do this as a child,” Castiel says, and his voice is so flat and emotionless that it sends an unpleasant, creeping feeling up Dean’s spine. “Whenever anything upset me when I was young, my parents would always find me crying in the shower. My father would call it ‘sky tears’. Sitting here, feeling sad, letting the falling tears wash away my own. I always thought it was odd, since he made it sound as though the shower was crying. He’d always say, ‘Castiel is in the bathroom, crying sky tears. Leave him alone for a while.’ And everyone would. Everyone always listened to him. I’d forgotten all about that until…”
“It’ll get easier.” Castiel ventures in and sits down on the edge of Billie’s bed, watching his son as he stirs and turns over in his sleep. He reaches for Dean, rubbing the back of his neck, and Dean leans into his touch. “He’s only been home for two days. It’ll start to feel real soon.”
A hint of a smile passes Castiel’s lips and his blue eyes twinkle just a little. “I’m not a Grinch, Dean. I like seeing other people enjoy their holidays.”
The next few seconds happen in slow motion.
“Girlfriend,” Meg corrects him lazily. “They're not married.”
, what the hell were you thinking?”
The letters had been shoved away in a pile beneath a selection of fashion magazines, and he'd found them when he was searching for the insurance paperwork for the car. He'd opened them by mistake, in truth, distracted by thoughts of the vast electric bill that had just landed on his desk at the garage. When he'd opened the statement, he'd initially thought there had been some mistake. That the letter had been sent to the wrong person. But he'd sunk down on the couch in shock as he read the names of all Amara’s favourite stores, the beauty parlour where she has her nails done, the hair salon that she evidently frequents much more often than he'd realised. The list went on and on and his shock had soon thawed away into heated anger. How could she do this to him? Get herself into so much debt without telling him, be so goddamn irresponsible?
“You’re in the Parlour Suite,” a steward tells Sam’s man, holding out a slip of paper to him. Jack, young and eager to learn and desperate to fit in with his new employers, stands straight-backed and takes the paper with a keen smile. “Rooms B 40, 42, 44, and 46. Is everyone in your party present?”
“Dean. Winchester. Dean Winchester.”
“I don't think you can, kiddo,” Cas sighed. His hand had stroked shiny dark hair back from Billie’s forehead before he kissed his temple. “I think it might be broken.”
In the kitchen, the refrigerator is stuffed to the brim. A turkey big enough to feed ten people is wedged in beside pigs in blankets, homemade cranberry sauce, plus all the trimmings. The vegetables are peeled and prepared ready to roast tomorrow. There are enough bottles of wine and beer to sink a ship.
“Yeah, pleasure’s all mine.” Downing the rest of his drink and starting to feel more than a little hazy, Dean deposits his glass on the table beside the decanter with a little more force then he intended. A few heads at the next table turn to look and he averts his gaze, cheeks heating at the unwanted attention. “What brings you to this fine ship, Fergus Crowley?”
“He is. Kinda. But maybe there’s more to it than you think.” Castiel leans his arm on the back of the couch, resting his chin on his hand, and watches Meg make coffee for them both in her underwear. It's late, the hour crawling towards midnight, and he's wrapped in a blanket with their combined sweat cooling on his skin, feeling strangely disconnected from her tonight. For some reason that currently escapes him, he hasn't been able to shake off the conversation he had with Dean earlier in the week.
“You look so good, Dean. You’re wearing a tux?” He blinks owlishly, as though not quite sure what he’s seeing.
work. “I have to listen to you mooning over some guy who doesn’t know you exist. Give me a break.”
was single, his cousin had laughed heartily.
“Maybe next summer,” Dean can feel how tight his smile is. It almost hurts his cheeks. He adds a laugh for good measure but it comes out a little strangled. “Money is kinda tight right now, so if we do go away it’ll be a weekend somewhere. Maybe Uncle Bobby’s cabin up in the mountains. Probably nowhere overseas, I’m afraid.”
He doesn't know what he needs. Not really. And that thought combined with the pain, with the residual shock of the accident brings a burst of tears to his eyes and a choked sob escapes before he can clap a hand to his mouth. Fuck. Castiel, of all people, cannot hear him like this. He needs to clean up, to sort himself out, to hang up the phone.
“No.” It takes Castiel a moment to gather himself enough to continue. “It’s on Wednesday. Gabriel took care of everything. I think he knew I was a bit… upset.”
He holds up his cell phone in one hand, and holds his other with palm outward in a ‘not my fault’ gesture. “No bars, sorry. Everyone must be on their phones today.”
makes her way resolutely across the Atlantic, and he folds his arms around himself as a chill makes him shiver unexpectedly. His breath clouds faintly in front of him and he pauses for a moment, looking over the railings and down into the black water below him. It’s a long drop. The light from a few portals casts an eerie glow out onto the ocean, highlighting the tips of the waves which are moving faster and more violently than he’d anticipated. The ship is evidently moving more quickly than he’d thought, and he spares a second to marvel at how smooth the journey is. He has to admit it, he’s impressed.
, but he knows Cas has lost someone close to him and that he’s struggling to cope with his grief. And all at once, guilt comes crashing down on him like an anvil. He should have been here; not only that, he shouldn’t have left Cas the way he did that damn night, shouldn’t have yelled in his face and slammed doors. He regretted it all the way to the airport and on his flight, then had no idea what to say or how to fix it from so far away. Now he wishes he’d not even got on the damn plane.
She helps him fill in a few forms, checking one box on the health form, then she chaperones him up a sweeping flight of glass stairs overlooking an Olympic-length pool. He tries to keep his awe from showing as she walks him around the state-of-the-art equipment, pointing out the stairs to the sauna, steam room, and sports massage suites. He doesn't want to think about how much a membership to this place must cost. He can't imagine coming here regularly, parting with his own money voluntarily just to keep the card in his wallet. The city gym down the road from his apartment is just fine. The treadmills are all in use by slim women with swinging ponytails and expensive headphones, and the weight section seems dominated by a group of men in a variety of shapes and sizes, working on different parts of their bodies. He swallows hard. He's going to be totally out of place here. In fact, he's dreading having to actually work out here. He should have gifted the voucher to someone else. Maybe Gabriel. His boyfriend is pretty into the gym, he should have passed it on with his compliments. Rookie error. But he trails after Bela obediently, feeling more and more unfit as he passes by the other members.
“I think we all were,” Sam mumbles, eyes on his plate. He remembers the shock that had passed over Castiel’s face and the raised eyebrow Meg had given the group when nobody spoke up to defend them. He feels equally as guilty for not challenging Amara’s cutting words. “I thought Dean would have said something to her. Maybe he did, later on. They left in a hurry.”
There's an edge to Jimmy’s voice that Dean has heard only once before and, in alarm, he pushes open the door to an empty classroom to take the call in peace. The last time he heard Jimmy sound this distressed was almost a year ago, when Lexie was lying motionless and not breathing on the beach after being dragged from the ocean. Jimmy is panic-stricken.
“Clarence?” Meg raps on the open door with her knuckles, smirking as she sees him. Today her blonde hair is piled on top of her head and she’s got on the pair of highest, spikiest boots he’s ever seen. “You’re late.”
Dean can’t take his eyes off Lexie’s face. He can barely believe that his son is here, at home in his own bed, when less than a fortnight ago he came so close to death that Dr. Bradbury recommended they both say their goodbyes. That night had been awful, the worst of his life, and he remembers Castiel sobbing and screaming and throwing anything he could get his hands on, can remember Jimmy pinning his twin’s arms to his sides and holding him tightly, letting him sob on his shoulder as Dean and Billie watched, clinging to each other, Dean numb with shock and Billie’s cheeks wet with tears. He blinks away the vision and the tears that accompany it to find Castiel on the floor beside him, wrapping an arm around his shoulders and pulling him close. Dean goes, burying his face in Cas’ neck and breathing him in.
But Dean isn’t here right now. Hasn’t been here for a few days, and Castiel would be feeling his absence like a lost limb - if he held the ability to feel anything at all.
He loves her. But he isn't in love with her. But that's going to be enough. It has to be.
“I don't even have an appropriate suit to wear.” He groans into his hand. “I don't think suede elbow patches will cut it somehow.”
“Are you kidding?”
This isn't his room. He isn't at home.
Dean can’t help but laugh in agreement at that. “Damn straight. But if you love them half as much as you love Doritos then I don’t see a problem here. Do you?”
Dean has been beside himself at the news of such an astronomical inheritance. He had spent the entire journey to their grandfather’s attorney chattering excitedly about what he would spend his money on, and the house he would build. For a few weeks, maybe even months, he had been elated and had enjoyed life to the full, with more money than he could spend on beer, wine, women and fine food. Considering they’d spent a large portion of their childhood in poverty, living hand to mouth and never certain where their next meals were coming from, Sam couldn’t blame him. They began moving in different social circles. Dean had a house built a few miles outside of the small town they grew up in while Sam bought a property on one of the main streets. They hired maids and staff. Dean threw lavish parties, bought a ranch upstate, invested in racehorses and the stock market. Sam, more cautious with his newfound wealth, put a lot into savings accounts and bought assets. Dean was having more fun, guaranteed, while Sam was planning for the long term.
"Dude," He started. It didn't seem right. It was a small flicker, barely there.
Why couldn’t they just leave him alone?
different, yet similar to the Dean he knew. He got up from …well, from himself, and shook his body. He looked down to himself and smiled. Castiel saw his eyes turn a pitch black as he smirked, looking
Castiel nodded, his fingers working to ease the tension from the hard muscles of Dean’s back.
He grinned, hearing Dean moaning, hips gyrating under his silky touch. It was like he was yearning for him. So Cas continued to torment him, licking inside, tracing moist patterns on his skin. When he finally moved to his cock, Dean jumped.
He stumbled down the sun soaked streets, not daring to drive his Baby back home. She’d be safe at Ellen’s; he’d pick her up in the morning. Yeah. Ellen was good people, and Benny would keep watch on her. He bumped into the lamp post, his breath stinking of too much alcohol.
“Online forums don't count,” Gabriel had argued, getting up and going behind the counter to make them both another drink. The conversation had continued in a similar vein and they'd got nowhere really. When Castiel had mentioned that Gabriel hadn't given a single shit about him when
The men’s eyes had bulged at the notes they’d been presented with, had both nodded, then the porter had mumbled something about arranging Dean’s luggage and they’d both vanished from the room.
“Amara?” He rasps, throat tightening as he recalls her expression right before she pushed him. He's met with a quivering, shaky sob and, in spite of himself, he frowns. “Are you okay?”
“He hit a patch of ice and lost control of the car.” Castiel glances down at his hands. “Christmas hasn’t been the same since, although I admit I’ve found it difficult to try and enjoy it. I haven’t been able to see the point in decorating, especially if it’s just me here alone. But now…” He looks up at the lights, the tinsel, the wreath on the door, and his blue eyes seem to glow as he does. Snow sparkles on his lashes. “The house looks lovely. And you’ve done such a nice job.”
The words feel sour leaving his lips. Like he's betraying his brother by even speaking of such atrocities. But rather than comforting him, Gabriel purses his lips and his eyes take on a dark, heavy, sorrowful look that makes Sam’s blood chill in his veins.
“Dean! Jack said you were feeling unwell.” Sam gestures at a nearby waiter to pull the empty chair out opposite him - a gesture which grates on Dean’s nerves - and says, “You remember everybody, don’t you?”
“I don’t know, Cas.” Dean had hugged him, rested his cheek against Castiel’s temple, and watched the two boys on the bed together. “I guess we might never know. But whatever it is, it's a miracle.”
“But...” Jack is clearly floundering, caught between his instructions from Sam and Dean’s resolute refusal to comply. “But Mr. Winchester, I...”
He should go back to bed. Try to sleep it all off. But the likelihood of him falling asleep tonight at all is next to nothing, and there’s a damn good reason for it. If he does sleep, he knows what he’ll succumb to. Dreams of broken glass and crumpled metal. The smell of gasoline, the feel of blood slicking his skin. The car crash. The car crash he barely remembers but his brain has managed to piece together over the years. He’d come away with no lasting injuries beyond a nasty scar along his forearm and another bisecting his thigh, but his uncle hadn’t been so lucky. Bobby had taken the worst of it, the car hitting the tree on the driver’s side, and he’s never walked since. Today is the anniversary of the crash. It had happened when Bobby was driving Dean home, back from his cub scout meeting, and the road had been slick with a sudden rainfall and slippery after too hot a day. They had taken a corner a little too fast, the car hydroplaning, and after that Dean has a long blank space until he woke up in hospital hours later. He remembers it now in fragments that only show themselves in his nightmares, fading to shadow and smoke when he wakes. The scar on his arm doesn’t hurt any more, and he thumbs over it absently. He thinks of Bobby. Of his parents. Of everything he’s lost in his life and everything he’s been left with, of how precious and delicate human life is and how he could have lost his in a moment had the car crash happened any differently.
And Dean can’t protest. Castiel’s eyes are bright and he’s determined, and Dean wants to do whatever he can to push the grief aside even for a moment. So he allows it, encourages open-mouthed kisses and helps Cas out of his sweater and tosses it to the end of the bed with his own.
“Another?” A British voice, rough and gravelly, cuts into his resolution. He looks up to see a man in a long black coat over his tuxedo standing over him, holding the half-empty bottle of brandy with a raised eyebrow. He gestures to Dean’s glass.
“Why am I not dressed in the appropriate attire for dinner with the world’s finest?” Turning, Dean walks away across the room and opens the door to the private promenade deck that the steward had taken such pride in showing him. The wind immediately catches his hair, blowing it out of any semblance of style, and he breathes in the sea air deeply. The whiskey has settled his nerves somewhat and he feels much more mellow than when they had boarded hours ago. “Because I’m not going. So you can run along and help Sam comb his hair, he’ll definitely need help with that.”
“It’s your fault!” The cry comes from Castiel, his voice choked and breaking on the last word. “You didn’t save him! You could have saved him, and you
Once again, Sam follows Dean’s gaze over the heads of the crowd, and is absolutely in no doubt about the person his brother is so instantly entranced by. And by Jo’s sudden huff of laughter beside him, neither is she.
Sam and Gabriel have a sprawling house in the suburbs with a porch wrapping around the front and a little wooden fence painted white. Gabriel says its ironic, but Dean knows that they both kinda like it. It’s pleasant, homely, and Dean’s happy for them. The place doesn’t have the cool, sterile feel that his own does now that he and Amara have consolidated all their belongings and bought new furniture to furnish the place to both their tastes. More her taste, if he’s honest, but it doesn’t matter. Couches and TV units aren’t what makes a house a home in his eyes, it’s the people inside it. He tries not to think too hard on why his own place doesn’t feel quite like a home any more.
Gabriel is rarely sentimental so the statement had floored Castiel for a long moment. He'd brushed it all off but now, now that Meg has left and he's alone in his office again, he can't help but think about what's waiting for him at home tonight after work. A chilly apartment above his shop. Mac and cheese for dinner. Maybe a beer if he feels like it. Cable TV. There
The guy glances up as he walks past, out of the changing rooms, and looks like he's about to say something but Castiel ignores him completely. Whatever he has to say, it isn't of any interest.
” Gabriel Novak’s arm snakes around his shoulders and the younger, boisterous man is at his side in an instant, beaming, an almost-empty glass of wine held loosely in his other hand. Behind him, Dean’s younger brother trails with a rueful smile and greets Dean apologetically.
“Good morning to you too,” Gabriel smiles but it doesn't reach his eyes like it normally does. He seems distracted, lost in thought as he turns back to their food, popping a capsule into the Keurig to make Sam his usual soy caramel latte. The machine buzzes to life and they both watch it for a moment. There's a tension in the air and Sam’s sure he knows what it's about.
“Dean?” Castiel’s warm voice pulls him back to the present and he finds himself in the bathroom, steam slowly winding its way up through the air, and Castiel is sliding his hands under his t-shirt and pushing it up. “It’s okay. Stay with me, stay here.”
“Mmm.” Dean follows his gaze and makes a noncommittal sound. “It’s exhausting, pretending to be a gentleman all the time. I think I’d have more fun in steerage.”
concerned. It's not an emotion I feel very often, mind you, so I'd appreciate it while it's here. But I worry about you, Castiel. Shut up in your shop with only those dusty old books for company. It'll make you old before your time.” He'd glanced at Castiel’s tweed suit jacket. “If it hasn't already.”
that, dammit. He turns on his side, eyeballing the door to make sure the ringing hasn't woken Castiel. No light glimmers from the crack beneath it, so that's a positive sign. He hasn't got a clue what time it is, but it's either really late or really early. It's still dark out, and he can't hear any telltale tweet of birds welcoming the dawn. Castiel. Fuck.
!” Castiel’s furious cry is so loud that even Dean flinches. The child gapes at his father and immediately starts to cry, covering his eyes and backing away from the mess towards the sofa. “Look at what you did!”
“Sam! What a lovely surprise. How are you?”
“Daddy, stop being loud.” A small, sleepy drawl comes from Billie’s side of the room and Castiel covers his mouth - and his smile -  with his hand.
They also don't want to go because Lexie is sick again. He hasn't been at school for two days, has been coughing and feverish, and Dr. Bradbury has him scheduled for an appointment in two days’ time if he hasn't perked up. He's been clingy and sad, constantly wanting Cas, and as a result they've both been spending very little time with Billie - who in turn has been acting up.
“No, please do!” In a flurry of movement and sound, Sam’s boyfriend of two months sits down at the booth amid a pile of shopping bags and brushes his hair out of his face. His cheeks are pink with the cold and his glasses steamed up, yet there’s a glimmer of glee in his eyes as he sizes Dean up. “Does he have a cock that-”
Dean can’t say no to that note in Castiel’s voice. He follows him to the bathroom, drawn by the hand, and stares at the door of the kids’ bedroom as they pass. So much has changed in such a short time and he’s still reeling from it. From losing Cas and getting him back, from almost losing Lexie then getting him back… it’s a lot to contend with, and he feels permanently exhausted. Coming home from the hospital three days ago had been a blessing and a curse. Lexie was safe, was well enough to go home with medication and strict instructions for rest, and Castiel had carried him from the car all bundled in blankets, both of them smiling their small, tight smiles. They had eaten dinner together then Lexie had curled up with Dean on the couch and fallen asleep in his arms. Where he should be. So in that sense, having him home was everything Dean had wished and prayed for, and more.
“I’ve done everything for you, Cas,” he says to himself. He stands at his kitchen window, his glass clasped in his hands, and stares out into the night. The trees sway in the breeze, some of their branches brushing his upstairs windows, and he remembers Billie all covered in dirt and crying. “I’ve sacrificed so much that you don’t even know about. And this is how you repay me?”
“Amara.” He massages his temples. “I don’t know what’s going on with you, but you need to start living in the real world. Our savings are depleted, our rent has gone up, I barely make enough money to cover our expenses these days, and I need you to help me out with this. We need to cut back a little.”
comes to an end and he switches to
“‘Kay.” Billie yawns hugely and turns over in bed, not really awake, tugging his stuffed elephant closer and going back to sleep with a speed that Dean truly envies.
He's in the hospital. The last time he was here, something truly awful had happened. The taste of blood in his mouth, searing pain down his arm, doctors trying to hold him still as he screamed and cried and tries to twist away to look for Bobby. He shivers, and Amara kisses his knuckles.
Lexie is dead.
And not once had Castiel been tempted to call Dean. His pride won’t allow it. He knows when he’s not wanted, has had plenty of experience with rejection over the years, and he certainly isn’t going to humiliate himself by begging Dean to reconsider or to come home so they can talk it all out. If and when Dean gets in touch when he comes home, they can talk then. He was very matter-of-fact about it and had managed to get a firm handle on his emotions by the time he woke up on Wednesday morning.
Gabriel said that Castiel would like to decorate. Maybe he just needs someone to do it for him, Dean reasons. Maybe he’s lonely and wants someone to decorate with, to string lights up with and to laugh when they tangle, to hand ornaments to and to throw snowballs at as they wind tinsel around the porch steps. Dean has decorations to spare, he could offer to lend Castiel some. Or offer to decorate
He turns to Amara, reaching to take her hand, and is met with a stony smile, one that doesn’t reach her eyes. She tosses her hair back and sips her wine, taking her time as she answers. She doesn’t take his outstretched hand.
“You OK?” he murmurs, and Cas’ blue eyes flash up to meet his.
“Yes, I think so.” Jack stands on tiptoe, craning his neck to see. “The Winchester brothers are here, Jessica is already on board... oh.” He stops short, lips suddenly setting into a straight, prim line. “Mr Winchester, sir? Four rooms? Is she...”
Why does he even care what Castiel thinks anyway? Why does he care at all?
The living area is bathed in balmy light from the full moon so he doesn't bother to turn on the lamps. There's a breeze getting in from somewhere, likely from one of the windows that must have been left open, and he shivers as he crosses to the stove to put the kettle on to boil. It's a ritual of his if he wakes in the night to brew a peppermint tea and sip it slowly to try and calm himself and lull himself back into near-slep. Lately, it hasn't been working.
“Sam isn’t back yet?” Dean’s brow creases in concern. “Do you know where he is?”
He turns over, huffing angrily. Amara is downstairs on the phone and he pulls his pillow over his head to block out her glittery laughter.
But now, glancing back at Dean, he sees that his brother’s eyes are focused entirely on someone other than his ex. The cop has turned their way and is waving at them to get off the road with furrowed brows. With a spark of glee, Sam pulls Dean’s arm and shoves him bodily towards the sidewalk - and right into the path of the cop.
Little does he know, across town two people are having a very similar discussion.
“Are you okay?”
Margaret Brown, an indomitable woman from Missouri who boarded at Cherbourg and insists they call her Molly, looks Sam up and down before giving him a large smile - then declares that he reminds her of her nephew back home. John Jacob Astor, a man nearing his twilight years who Sam knows by reputation of course, shakes his hand in a distracted sort of fashion - on his arm is a very pretty young woman in the type of delicate condition ladies can find themselves in, and Sam has to stop the surprise from showing on his face. Where he comes from, men are faithful to their wives. Strong women with kind hearts who would just as soon grab a shotgun as give you a foot rub at the end of a long day. He thinks of Ellen, a woman he’s called Aunt since he was a child, who runs one of the bars back home in small-town Lawrence, who has been known to evict many a patron over the years with her bare hands. And her daughter, Joanna, starkly reminiscent of the pregnant young lady before him, and he’s struck with a wave of homesickness.
He deposits Cas on the closed toilet, turns the shower off, then begins to strip off his wet clothing and drops it in wet piles on the floor with unsettling slaps. Castiel is watching him blearily, a towel wrapped around his shoulders, a deep frown line tugging at his brows.
The first thing he notices when he regains consciousness a while later probably should be the pain in his head, which is close to blinding. Or maybe the blood that has somehow dripped into his eyes and grown tacky as it dried. Or the shower of splintered glass which covers him like a fine snow and makes a light tinkling sound when he moves. But what registers enough to drag him back to the world is the pain in his back from where he’s lying half in and half out of the shower stall, the metal trim digging painfully into his lower back. He groans, blinking hazily, and for a minute he can’t remember where he is. He’s facing the shower wall, half-curled on his side, and it takes him a long moment before he can summon the energy to try and push himself up onto an elbow, shards of glass tumbling from his clothing and skin into the shower. His brain is foggy and slow to send signals to his limbs, making sitting up and looking around him a chore. The room is spinning and he feels like he might throw up, light tremors shaking his arms and legs as he drags himself from the stall onto his knees before collapsing against the wall.
in the middle of fucking July. In any country, anywhere, as far as Dean (and the rest of the world) is concerned.
The event is to raise money for the city’s firefighters, and it’s a cause close to Dean’s heart. His father had trained as a firefighter the year after his mother died, and it became his passion and his career for the remaining years of his life. Alcoholism had taken him in the end, but Dean had never been more proud of his father’s achievements, of the lives he saved in his years on the force. So when Amara told him of her plans to host a dinner in support of the local fire service, he knew he wouldn’t be able to pass this one over. She’s accepted a generous donation from him as well, telling everyone how her wonderful boyfriend was the main supporter of her event, and it made Dean’s ears burn every time she said it. He hates the limelight, always has. He’d rather cheer from the sidelines, but with Amara at his side it isn’t always possible.
Everything can't be perfect all the time.
His glass is empty and he stashes it in the sink, deciding against finishing the entire bottle.
The doorbell jingles and Dean looks up, a smile splitting his face as he sees who it is. Even after over a year of being together, seeing Cas brings butterflies to his stomach. His boyfriend - no,
Lexie lies in the middle of the bed, on top of the sheets, no wires or tubes in sight. His dark lashes lie still on pallid cheeks and his chest is too still. But the most shocking thing for Dean is that he looks like he’s just been dragged from the ocean: his pajamas and slippers are soaking wet, dripping, droplets gathering on his lips which hold a bluish-grey tint and he knows without needing to be told. He knows, and it hits him in the chest like a bolt of lightning.
“Fine,” Castiel’s cheeks pink up a little at the nickname. “The kids wanted to see what you're up to.”
“It’s okay.” Cas shuffles in his arms, getting comfortable by pushing Dean to lie on his back and using his chest as a pillow - it’s both of their favourite positions to fall asleep in. They’re both still sticky, their combined release growing tacky as it cools, but he can ignore the discomfort because having Cas here in his arms is so much more important. “You’re here now. And that’s all that matters. We can work it all out later. Let’s just be here, now. Together. Just us.”
It couldn’t be possible.
for this all the time. Maybe Dean was just concussed or something. Maybe the whiplash was what was causing him to behave this way. After all, Dean didn’t want to kiss him, did he?
“Actually, it’ll be easier if I show you,” And with that, she was right in front of Dean, her hand splayed out over his chest, nails a lot sharper now and eyes a pure white. Dean didn’t even have the time to react. He was pushed back onto the sofa with the lady standing right in front of him. Sam yelped from next to him, but before his brother could actually do anything, the lady smiled brightly.
They’d been here, sitting on the hard yet stuffed cushioned chair for almost an hour now, and Dean was starting to get a little pissed off. Why couldn’t they just hurry this shit along please. Like now. He didn’t have any time to wait around here drinking tea and eating dumb ass biscuits — even if they tasted amazing — he really needed to get what they came for and get Cas back.
“Cas…” Dean warned, but his voice trailed off, eyes half lidded as Cas worked on his abs and stomach, easing the tension there, not letting Dean anticipate where he was going to touch next. His chest hadn’t been the most tense, it was more his hips, which had been straining from bending over into the guts of that damn car. And there was only one place for Cas to go after that, his fingers tripped down Dean’s hips, circling and massaging the base of his cock with such perfect attention.
It always ended up with bloodshed.
Cas looked up at him, panting and positioning Dean better. Dean’s arms were still wrapped in the binds, so Cas could only move his bottom half. Cas kissed him then, open mouth and sweet, the taste of him still on his tongue, he tugged on Dean’s lower lips, making him vibrate with want. A fire erupted inside his spent body, possessing him.
He yanked the phone from the ground and held it to his ear. Sam’s voice picked up, but before he could say anything, Dean stated with determination in his eyes.
“Tell me, Dean,” he breathed as his hands ran over his body, Smiling in satisfaction, he reached back to Dean’s cock, pumping him in slow, slick, sweet moves. Up and down, slick and sweet languid motions, feeling Dean trembling in his arms. He lowered his head and pressed a kiss to the head of his cock, running his tongue in small circles along the head and sucking down on it, hearing as Dean whimpered, holding back his moans.
Poor Cas...and poor Dean.
I don't usually do this.
Hey all~!
Gabriel faltered, unsure of what he was seeing, or what he was supposed to
“Okay, you’ve gone crazy,” Cas said, suddenly getting up. He quickly darted to his table, circling around it and reaching for his thick spell book on the pedestal. He flipped through the pages and tried to find a way to figure out just what had happened to his…to Dean. He wasn’t like this. Dean didn’t call him
This was turning to be a great Halloween.
He just…couldn’t.
lovely. But there was definitely something off about her. Dean wasn't sure what it was, but he had been on high alert ever since they had gotten out of Baby and had stepped foot onto her property. The hairs on the back of his neck had been standing up ever since she had sat them down and offered them tea. Her face was wrinkled, her clothing was old and long and soft looking, her entire house smelled of weird cabbages and moth balls. But the tea she offered — or more like forced into his hands — was sweet and almost fruity in a weird way. Fuck, everything about this was weird.
there was a little piece of baked ‘pick me up puffs’ Gabriel had given to him – on the house, because
. – but Sam Winchester was first and foremost a law student. And he had told that brunette who came with him every once in a while that he wasn’t interested in being a familiar.
“Poor hunter can’t talk,” He whispered, eyes glittering in that particular way that made Dean yearn for him. “Perhaps I can help with that,”
But then again, Dean thought to himself, after all the shit they had been through every time they tried to do anything summoning-like, was most likely piss poor due to the douche bag Chuck holding the reigns. He must have been fucking something up to make his story all the more enticing and exciting for himself.
Yeah. Gabriel would still be here. His store would always be open for Sam.
Dean could feel him smirking, it was as if he had known Dean would want a massage from him, making it all the more simpler to slip his pyjamas to reveal the rest of him.
“I will give you a Rifter, it will lead Naomi to her goal.” Crowley’s twisted lips lifted up into a smirk. He stepped closer to the mage. “Be warned, this is not for the faint heart. Keep my Rifter hidden, locked away, or she will cause havoc."
She looked like any old lady.
“Not yet, baby,” Cas replied, his voice was pure torture. Little by little he inched his way inside, filling Dean up so completely, enveloping his firm heat. Dean clenched into it. Cas gripped him by his ass, nails digging into his flesh, riding him slowly at first. Dean felt tight, slick and warm, making him whine and moan and beg as Cas’s thrusts quickened.
Dean grumbled again, but when he found out Castiel wasn’t moving all that much, he continued his content cuddling. In any other world, in any other time, Castiel would have jumped at the chance to be with Dean, to cuddle him, to kiss him, to do everything that they were currently doing. But this, this was…
Cas rolled his eyes, murmuring something about him being so quick at getting excited because of a damn massage, but he obliged him anyway. Dean really didn’t know what he had done to deserve such an angel. Cas teasing his fingertips up and down Dean’s cock, curling his fingers around it, legs straddling either side of Dean’s hips in a way that showed just how intimate this impromptu massage had gotten. His hands grasped, squeezing and pumped a few times, fingers flexible as they curled and twisted on the up thrust, massaging his full length.
The old lady pointed her clean cut nailed finger at Sam, smiling warmly. But there was still something weird about her, something that kept them both to high alert. They had been burned way too many times before by people who looked and acted good, but were evil to the core. Who knew what this woman was. She hadn't given them her name, and neither had they.
Gabriel looked over to the original Sam, seeing he was still sleeping peacefully on the plush of the booth. Then to the other Sam, who was struggling a little, looking down to his bound by magic hands and grinning.
Cas didn’t cease his movements, fingers webbed with Dean’s arousal, licking and sucking him clean. When Dean finally returned, his breathing shallow and uneven, he grinned, lining himself with Dean’s stretched and relaxed body.
It couldn't have been real. It had to be a dream.
He had known years ago that the two were definitely more than just ‘best friends’ or ‘family’, as Dean constantly told him. Maybe Dean had meant a more permanent fixture for Cas, but they hadn’t gotten to that part yet. They had been through apocalypse after apocalypse that it was becoming a joke now. Thank god that was all over. But in that, it meant Cas was no longer here. He couldn’t imagine what Dean was going through.
He reached for the nearest piece of wood, the small plank he had been whittling, and pressed it into Sam’s skin, in his large palms. The magic he had infused into that wood sunk into Sam’s skin, little sparks rising up his wrists, his arm, crossing over his elbow and up into his shirt. Gabriel could see his magic erupt on Sam, growing stronger and more wondrous as it rose up his arm, across his shoulder and settled into his heart.
What was this? Was Sam a projection? A ghost? Or was he something else entirely? Gabriel needed to find out, he needed to get to…to…
She watched as the ‘other’ blonde mage shook himself up, his eyes as black as night. He looked across to his twin and to Castiel, holding a hand to his heart, and smirked. Kneeling down to Castiel, Naomi saw him whisper something to him, but didn’t hear what it was. The black eyed blonde mage snapped his fingers, and vanished into thin air.
“My name is Crowley, how may I help you, Royal Sorcerer?” Victor seemed shocked that the man knew who he was, but his resolve wavered when he thought of whom he had gone to. He peered into the tomb held in his arms and pointed to one of the words, hoping he could pronounce it properly.
“It’s alright, Dean,” he said as he glanced over to him. "I was coming to see you anyway,"
...would it be a bit presumptuous of me to write a Sabriel threesome?
Sam’s cheeks burst a bright red, and he looked away. “Th-thanks anyway,” He slid out of the booth and stood in front of Gabriel, noticing once again just how shorter the older man was. Though that wasn’t much of a feat, Sam was a giant.
However, he was in need of a familiar, much like his brothers had. He had been studying his art so much so that his strengths and sorcery were slowly growing to go haywire. His little brother Castiel had already mastered his art, and was working with his familiar Dean – not that Dean
Sam out, there was no way that rope was going to budge. The lightning barely singed the rope. “Just let me go! I got a candy man to lick like a lollipop,”
Victor took in a deep breath, sliding the paper doors to one side and stepping through the threshold. He ran a hand through his dark hair and looked around. It was a quaint reception room, the building was a lot bigger on the inside than it looked, it was either that theory or the beautiful golden paper that lined the walls seemed to refrain any thought of fear. An older man walked in through the sliding doors by the reception, he glided to Victor and swept down low into a bow.
about that at a time like this?
Sam, the same way Gadreel had done all those years back, and had acted all snarky, yet not as much of an asshole as usual. Like he was actually trying to be civil and good. It was fucking weird to see his brother like that, that was for sure. - Dean had expected them to do some breaking and entering into homes, barns, covens or even caves. Chanting some weird ass spells or enchantments that he’d have to remember and pronounce correctly. Maybe they'd even have to do some blood letting or blood magic or some shit. As per their usual shtick when it came to crap like this.
But that was neither here nor there. Sam understood the pain of losing a loved one. They had lost too many people after all. But he got it, Cas was…well, he was different. For Dean, he was more than just another family member.
“Son of a bitch!” The encouragement was barely audible. He wanted to restrain himself, but this was growing into something he couldn’t control any more. He held out as long as he could but Cas was just too good, he knew exactly what to do to make Dean come. And come he did, so hard, spasming under him, waves of his climax tearing through his body, spilling all over his chest.
He let his head fall forward, relaxing as he let his body fall heavy, arms coming beneath his chest to break him from his fall. He moaned as the plush cushions morphed around his body, remembering him. He shuffled, trying to get as comfortable as possible. It was no surprise that Cas found him like this moments later.
sleep.”
had been forced out of him. Yanked from his very existence, leaving a wide, gaping hole, needing to be filled. It made him gasp for breath, but that only made the sandy taste sink into his skin.
Cas’s scent permeated the room, a twinge of sweetness with the stormy dark musk. It reached his nostrils and awakened the carnal desire inside him. He gazed up at the beauty of his lover, his imposing presence filling the room with sexual energy. The pounding in his chest grew more rapid, his skin prickling with goose bumps.
Flipping through the slightly yellowing pages of his spell book, he stopped at a hand written spell written in his own missive. A spell to see snippets of the past. It was crude and had the chance of not working to its full effect, but it should work well for what he wanted. He chanted the spell like it was second nature to him, like it was as easy as breathing to channel his essence, his power, and bring it out with his lilting words.
The Rifter shivered again, but paid no heed to the forest or its surroundings. It knew its job, and it wanted this man. It knew the potential within this man. And it knew that he would be happier for its interference. His heart was screaming. The young man was coming closer to it, stepping away from where his heart beat the hardest; The Rifter peered at every part of him. It shivered at the thumping of his heartbeat, wanting him to go closer to the Sorcerer, nor further away.
Or at least, that was what Cas thought was happening. Dean leaned in closer, placing both hands on the pedestal, on either side of Cas, caging the sorcerer in. He smirked; pressing his lips to Castiel’s once again, this time with more purpose and assurance. It was heavenly, chaste and sweet, but it made Cas burn.
from the sleeve of his trench coat, and smirked wickedly, advancing at Dean with agonisingly slow steps. He slipped the blade under the rope, slicing it clean apart, but he left a panting, wide eyed hunter in his wake. Dean’s heart was hammering, adrenaline pumping, his instincts switching to overdrive.
He was suddenly frightened of the situation, in a good way. Cas meant business right now, and looking so
His phone buzzed in his hand again, shocking him from his thoughts. Taking a cursory glance, he saw Sam’s name flash again for fuck only knew how many times that night. Hadn’t…hadn’t he been out on a date or something? Why was he calling him? He knew he should pick it up, he knew he should at least tell his brother that he was okay. That he wasn’t ignoring him. But he just couldn’t do it.
…well, Gabriel really hadn’t expected

there was no other way to define it. He looked…
Nah, it couldn’t be. Something that good didn’t happen to him…it wasn’t like they had a profound bond or— ah, fuck. Yeah. Okay, so maybe they did. But that didn’t mean that Cas had what, left a part of himself inside of Dean? When had he even
"Hey Gabe," Sam's voice was so soft, so small as he stepped over the painted sigil on the ground and over to the small ball of light. Dean watched, infatuated, as Sam slowly held his hands up to it, curling his fingers around the small ball of light. "You're...back,"
Holy crap.
To all of you lovely people who read any of my fics. I'm sorry I've not been updating as much as usual lately.
Hang on. Gabriel.
Castiel knew he would have to explain, tell him all that had transpired between them. How he had waited a millennia to find him again. Now he had his love at last, and he was going to make sure Dean was with him for all eternity, as they should have been before.
Updates are going to go on pause for now. So, I am so very sorry. I will return as soon as I can with more for you lovely readers. I just need some time to rest and recuperate.
that had done this to both Winchesters, and why to only them? While he had been waiting for Gabriel to appear, he had tried to get in touch with the other witches and wizards in the area, to see if they had witnessed any similar problems. But no one had been the wiser, and no one seemed to know just what the hell the spell could have been.
Cas looked so lustful in the faded light. Dean growled, wishing he could reach up and press kisses to his thighs, just bury himself in there and make his lover happy. In one quick move, Cas removed his underwear and stood completely naked in front of Dean, his cock swollen and impatient.
Dean imagined his eyebrows were furrowed cutely in concentration, thumbs easing up his calves and thighs, and back down. Dean shuddered and groaned, slumping onto the cushions as Cas found the tight ring of muscle and worked on releasing even that bit of tension from his body.
He growled at the sickly familiar taste, the burn. Wishing this was all just some mad djinn hallucination, or some fairy shit or something. Hell, he’d even take the son of a bitch trickster archangel returning and fucking with him one last time. But it wasn't. He was still here and Cas was still...he must have returned along with the others. He must be finding his way back, right? Anything was better than…
“And miss out on you becoming a fancy lawyer? Not on your life,” Gabriel replied, smirking, “It’s not like it’s a hardship watching you work,”
something god wrong?
was caring for him.
The ball of light returned sluggishly back to Sam's hands, and fell into his palm, his light a little dimmer now than it had been before. Fuck, that didn't seem good.
She watched as he turned back to the house, and she saw her stepson, her little High Sorcerer Castiel, standing on the door step, his fingers clenched in fists to his sides, anger evident in his features. “…please, don’t leave because of that!” Castiel cried, holding onto the door frame, leaning out of the door, hand reaching out to the blonde mage.
Not that he was thinking like that.
He couldn’t think. That mouth was sucking on his skin, that tongue licking and slathering along his flesh, and those teeth – good god, those teeth grazed alongside that tongue and it made literal lightning ricochet from his mouth and straight into Gabriel’s muscles. It was such an odd feeling, those sparks, they made him jump in their minuscule jolts, but at the same time, they sunk into his skin, straight to his muscles and calmed him down.
Yeah, no. Dean wasn't going to go anywhere near that with a barge pole. He instead let out a small smile, glad for the win, and patted his brother on his back. Silently telling him that if anything happened, he tell him. Sam nodded, knowing exactly what he was thinking.
It was hard to form words when his angel was working over him so wonderfully, his fingers easing slowly with patience down his back, leaving no part of his skin untouched. The massage soothed away the stress he had been feeling. Dean’s fingers tightened on the bottle, moaning as those fingers pressed down on either side of his spine, cracking his bones and making him melt onto the sofa.
She leaned in a little closer, peering over the table and getting as close as she could to the both of them. Her long, curly white hair falling to frame her wrinkly, yet pretty face. In tandem, both Sam and Dean leaned as far away from her as they could. Which wasn't very far, as they were pushed back against the overly stuffed back of the sofa.
“Sorry baby,” he apologised, but he wasn’t really sorry and they both knew it. Dean needed this after all.
“I could say the same thing,” Castiel’s voice was a little bit choppy, followed by a loud thudding as if something had hit the ground behind him. Gabriel heard Castiel yell Dean’s name, before something else seemed to have fallen onto the ground, something sounding more fragile and glass like.
Now, he’s back in the kitchen and listening to the shower turn on above him, and wondering how to reply to his brother. Things have been tense between them lately, there’s been a weird distance that he hasn’t managed to shake off. But maybe this is the olive branch that they need to help them get back on track. He and Sam fight like any siblings do, but never seriously. Not often, at least. And if they do then at least one of them comes grovelling to apologise. But this time they haven’t exactly fought, so neither one can apologise. He sights and swipes his phone screen to light it up. He’s out of excuses, plus it’ll be fun. He can take some beers, maybe they can rent a movie, and it’ll be like old times.
Sam remembers that day to a fault. He and Jack have boarded already, and were in their cabin, Sam reclining on a plunger while Jack scurried to and fro, directing the porters and telling them what went where. This had been the first time Sam had travelled internationally as a First Class passenger and he’d been determined to enjoy every second of it. By then, they were less than an hour from departure and Dean hadn’t shown up. Sam has resigned himself to a month in Europe with mainly Jack for company, meeting up with Jessica and her mother in England prior to their return home on RMS Titanic. Perhaps it wouldn’t be a bad thing, he’d reflected. Some time apart would do them both the world of good. Sam could relax into his new world, and Dean could consider his place in it and finally find his peace with being a man of new money rather than scratching around to earn a living, caring for their alcoholic father, and dusting off his bruised knuckles after one too many drinks.
Now, Sam’s having flashbacks to their first apartment, a crummy studio with two single beds that wound up decorated like a frat dorm room - Sam’s poster of Stanford Law above his bed while Dean decorated his side of the wall with posters of firefighters, police officers, and strapping men in military uniform who stared Sam down as though challenging his every move. Some nights, he couldn’t sleep because he felt like they were staring at him. Or, he freaked himself out by imagining Dean looking at those images in an entirely different way and…
He ducks his head down to his chest as his breathing picks up, inhaling deeply to try and calm himself. He needs to get this shit under control. Even Ash had noticed at work yesterday, joking as he’d asked Dean if he’d had a few heavy nights lately because he looked pale and tired. Dean had shot back that he had, that he and Amara had been spending some quality time together, and all the guys in the forecourt had laughed and the conversation from there had devolved into lewd talk about who they’d fucked at the weekend, who was having an affair outside of their marriage, and who had the hottest girlfriend. Dean stayed out of it all, not enjoying the sentiments and knowing just how Amara would react if she could hear them all talk. Knowing how his mother would react. Damn, he misses her. If she were here right now, he’d be able to talk to her about everything that’s on his mind. He’d be able to be honest with her. Mary would help him. So would John, in his own way. As would Sam, Gabe, but he can’t bring himself to approach them, even after their offer at the barbecue. It would feel too much like throwing in the towel. And he isn’t there, not yet.
“Not my story to tell, Dean-o. You’ll have to ask Cassie about it. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to get home and wrap all these gifts.” He gathers himself up, winds his scarf around his neck, and kisses Sam on the nose. “See y’all tomorrow. Hope Santa’s good to you!”
: Xmas, Noel
He turns onto his side and is asleep within minutes, Amara curled against his back. When he wakes the next morning, the aspirin have done their job and he's blissfully hangover-free.
She doesn't comment on Sam. She never does. He sometimes wonders if she likes him at all, but when he thinks back they seemed to get on well in the past. Maybe they all need to spend more time together, get to know each other again. Bond. Family ties. That sort of thing.
Shit. He doesn’t look angry, that’s a plus. But as Dean struggles to his knees and then to his feet, he realises that he’s probably a lot more drunk than he’d initially realised and that maybe this wasn’t the best idea he’s ever had. In fact, he wonders if he would have done it sober at all. He has to grip the porch railing to stop himself keeling over. Thinking about it, it’s a real invasion of Castiel’s privacy and his cheeks flood with colour as he takes in the lights, the garlands, the tinsel, the miniature tree on the step. Castiel follows his gaze and doesn’t say anything, which makes Dean feel worse as the silent seconds tick by. He feels suddenly nauseous as he considers what he’s done. How he’s just arrogantly waded into Castiel’s life. His cheeks burn hotter and hotter and he wishes the snowy ground would just open up and allow him to melt into it.
To think, probably, about Dean Winchester.
Jimmy shudders at the memory, getting up from his desk where he’s been grading papers to pour himself another glass of wine. He frowns at the almost-empty bottle. He only opened it two hours ago. And, as it always does when he’s had a little too much to drink, anger swirls up inside him, dark and clawing.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hmm?” Sam has barely been listening, entirely distracted by the hubbub of noise and movement around him. Now, as a flash of dark hair cuts across his vision, followed by a waft of expensive fragrance, he catches on to Jack’s words. “Oh. Ruby, wonderful to see you again. So glad you could join us.”
He shakes his head at himself, wondering for the hundredth time how the hell he let himself get into that situation. He should have hung the phone up the second he realised it was Castiel on the phone. Then, running his mouth on the rooftop the way he did and giving Castiel the impression that things are wrong in his relationship... what was he thinking? He wasn’t, is the truth. He was shocked and in pain and, quite honestly, devastated that Amara had done what she did then just walked out and left him. He’d needed a friend in those moments, desperately, and somehow Castiel had presented himself as just that.
“Cas, it was an accident,” Dean begins, but Cas stands with the broken pieces of his camera clutched in his hands and turns away.
Castiel stands, brushes the snow off the back of his pants, then extends a hand to Dean and pulls him to his feet. The movement puts them very close together and Dean can smell the spicy orange and cinnamon of his shower gel. Christmassy. Delicious. Dean can’t help but lean in a little closer and inhale - in what he hopes is a subtle, unobtrusive way. Castiel smiles warmly at him, the glow of the lights turning his skin a beautiful golden and making his eyes sparkle. He’s looking at Dean as though seeing him for the first time and, slowly, links their hands together and draws Dean a little closer. Then he looks up and Dean, after watching the smooth lines of Castiel’s jaw and throat, follows his gaze and sees something he almost forgot he put up.
, Sam put up with it all without comment or complaint. Because Dean had been there for him through the dark times, and he’d earned Sam’s unconditional company and acceptance during his own bad moments.
“You could join me. Uses less water if we shower together. Save the planet and all.”
Inside, she holds Dean’s cell phone in her palm, scrutinising it. There’s a text message on the screen from Sam -
“Hey, baby. Lexie have a bad dream?”
“No. I didn't think I'd
3) most definitely
“Are you finished?” He grumbles and she nods, snuffling behind her hand before tossing her curls back and smiling at him. “I can use it. I can go to the gym. I just haven't been for a while. It'll be fun.” He pauses, tries to make his next sentence casual. “You could come too. You can pay for a few sessions. It'd be fun.”
“Right.” Sam turns to him, tucking a strand of hair behind his own ear, fingers coming away streaked with paint he didn’t even know was there. “Burgers and shakes sound pretty good right now, Dean.” He ignores the blink of surprise that crosses his brother’s face, soon replaced with a triumphant grin. “But, I don’t know… I’m kinda having fun here. I don’t think I’m ready to head home yet. We just found Jo…”
There’s a cop standing with his arms folded, eyes hidden behind aviator shades, stopping people from crossing the street while a garbage truck goes by. He’s tall, tanned, with thick-set biceps and thighs, and there’s a smear of turquoise glitter down one cheek, catching the sunlight as he moves. He looks like Dean’s dream guy made real, and even Sam has to admit the guy is pretty good-looking. Beside him, Jo whistles lowly and nudges Dean in the back.
It sounds like he wanted to say
The room spins when he closes his eyes. He's pleasantly drunk, probably won't have a hangover tomorrow if he wakes up and drinks his body weight in water then swings by McDonald's on the way back from his morning jog. He won't tell Amara. She disapproves of his love for burgers, fries, and chocolate shakes. But what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
, Dean thinks irritably.
Castiel shoulders had slumped and he had leaned morosely over his toast, staring down at his plate sadly.
The gym is brightly lit and everyone around him has firm, toned bodies and brightly-coloured clothing. Even the staff behind the desk, but he supposed they should embody the establishment they work in. Much like he does with his glasses and tweed jacket and - damn, he flushes as he realises he forgot to take it off - his bow tie. It garners him a mildly entertained smile from the woman at the desk as he approaches, brand new bag slung over his shoulder. Her name tag reads ‘My name is Bela - ask me for advice!’
?” Stress and anger are robbing him of the speech he'd practiced over and over while he'd been waiting for her. How can she stand there and act like he's the one in the wrong? “My goddamn name is on this!” He sweeps up one of the statements and shakes it so hard it tears. “How did you even open this account without me knowing?”
Inside Castiel’s house, it’s raining in the bathroom, too. Or rather, just in the shower stall where he’s sitting against the wall with his knees pulled to his chest and his chin resting upon them. Light is slowly beginning to filter in from the open window as the sun rises, but Castiel barely notices. The water has run cold by now and his skin has broken out in gooseflesh, the hair on his arms and legs standing up, and gentle tremors run through him as his body fights to keep warm. His breath fogs in front of him - the bathroom was cold to begin with, the winter weather seeping in to purge the room of any residual heat it had managed to hold onto during the night - and the cold shower is only adding to the discomfort. It’s unhealthy, Dean always says, to keep his house so cold during winter, but Castiel finds it bracing. He exercises a lot and wears plenty of layers, warm sweaters and cardigans, so that tends to keep him warm enough. And when Dean’s here, the other man’s body heat is more than enough. Castiel uses him as a teddy bear and Dean is more than happy to be cuddled.
Thank you for all the lovely comments and I'm sorry I haven't had a chance to reply to everyone yet. I hope you're enjoy the progress here - I loved writing this chapter!
It comes back to him in unpleasant Polaroid snapshots. The bank statement. The fight. Him storming off to get away from her and her following him. Things grow hazy then but he can put it together and it draws a low whine of distress from him. Things have gotten way out of hand and right now he can’t begin to sort through his emotions. Right now, he needs help.
But he doesn't go back to bed. He sits with arms around his knees and watches the ocean lap at the beach outside. He watches as the sky grows pale with the approaching dawn, and only when he knows Dean will be stirring soon does he climb back into bed beside him and feign sleep. His partner doesn't need to know that his sleep is so disturbed. Dean has been working so hard over the past month. He needs his rest and doesn't need anything else to play on his mind.
“Which charity, ma’am?” he enquires as she wraps up some brownies for the twins and a slice of carrot cake for Cas.
is going on? This isn’t like Sam, he’s usually incredibly respectful to people, especially to the women in his life. To allow Ruby to get so close to him is out of character, and shows just how toxic she is, in Dean’s opinion. He vows to speak to Sam either privately this evening when he finally shows his face, or over breakfast in the morning.
Then, as he’d been eating breakfast and trying to get himself into the right frame of mind for the day ahead, his phone had trilled out a shrill chime and every muscle in his body had tensed then relaxed. Dean. Dean, calling to make amends, to sort everything out. He felt a swell of emotion rise up within him as he swiped his phone towards him and hit ‘accept’ without looking at the caller ID.
He leans his forehead against the glass and thinks of them when they first met. Dancing together, laughing, eating out, long walks in the park, stargazing in Dean’s car. Her hair soft under his fingers and her lips even softer against his. Love and devotion in her eyes.
He watches as Jarvis putters about in their yard, sniffing for the bone he must have buried somewhere. It's going to be another glorious day, clear blue skies stretching on for miles, and Sam’s glad he hasn't put on a tie. The office air con is good, but the journey to work on the streetcar will be hellish in this weather. He's already dreading being pressed up against other commuters and thinks for the hundredth time that they need to buy a second car. His office is near Crown Center, an hour away, and he considers taking a change of shirt just in case he's too hot and sticky by the time he gets there.
right now – Sammy OG was still laying there in the booth, looking like he was in a deep sleep.
The man nodded and ticked Charlie's name. "Good evening, Miss. Bradbury, Mr…" He looked down at the clipboard in his hands. "W…" He mouthed out Dean's last name, trying to say it.
Summoning an archangel should not be this easy.
“Roll over, babe,” he said, tapping at Dean’s shoulder.
“Cas?” Dean’s voice was all sorts of lilting and deep, and Cas suddenly had the image of them wrapped in a loving embrace, whispering words of love and hope for their future together. All because Dean had said his name like
Castiel
He hadn’t exactly been all that positive about it. If the Men of Letters hadn’t been able to find a way after scouring years upon years of hard research and actual practicality, and had not even
“Y-yes,” Victor started, finding it rather difficult to follow her, she seemed to cut through the creatures with the utmost of ease. She stopped almost immediately in front of a beautiful Japanese styled building; its sweeping roofs seemed to invite him in as angel flew up and sat on the roof.
Hell,
There was no doubting this was the
Hopefully this...works? Maybe? Who knows.
The quick chaste kisses he and Dean had been sharing had turned a little hotter than he had ever thought possible. Nails dug into skin, gasps and groans escaped lips. Castiel had lost all comprehensive thought when those lips touched his, so sweet and soft, so deliciously plump. He had lost his balance when he felt Dean’s tongue thrust down his throat, and they had both fallen onto the plush carpet, barely missing the sharp edge wooden base of the table.
A bauble, like one you put on a fucking Christmas tree? Was this woman trying to have a laugh? It was a shiny, silver bauble, or at least a ball with a small hook at the top. But upon closer look, Dean saw there were slightly blue and green markings on its front, like a weird swirling language that he definitely couldn’t understand or make out.
Whatever that thing was that had gone straight through Dean, it was doing something to the man. It had made
Her gaze dropped to the little ball of light making a circle around the house, and she heard a thick sound of footsteps. The Rifter shuddered, as if the sound was pulling it, nagging at it to find out who it was. Naomi felt it before she saw it, the incessant thumping sqealch of footsteps on the thick with mud ground, each timed thud pulling her closer, luring her to its siren song. She stood a few feet in front of the building and saw a young blonde mage she despised walking through the street.
Gabriel rubbed the back of his head and turned to the sound as well. Looking to the dining chair that held the sleeping beauty, he grinned when he saw the sleeping Sam stirring in his sleep. He rushed over to him, placing a warm hand on Sam’s shoulder, waiting for him to wake.
And Castiel had all those books and things, he was bound to know just what the hell this whole thing was. Right?
Dean hadn’t noticed he had been talking out loud. Sam pressed a hand to his shoulder, just under where Cas’s hand print was scarred onto his skin — the one and only thing he had left of Cas, that and his previous trenchcoat he had left all those years ago when he had swallowed the god damn Leviathans — and patted him softly.
He wasn't sure just what was happening, but he really didn't want to have to tell his brother that the little ball of light was...well, just that. It couldn't be an archangel right? Weren't they all like, graceful and shit? Weren't they supposed to take over a vessel and be all holy and shit?
Dean came here, every night since, when he knew Sam was out doing an errand, or asleep, or just busy with whatever the hell he and Eileen did. He'd open the door to the empty room, sit down on the ground where Cas had thrown him to save him, to protect him, and just try to figure out what he could have done, what he could have said, that would have...saved him. His grip tightened on his jacket, the one where Cas's blood stained hand print lay, a perfect print both on his skin and on his jacket. He would just sit here and try to come to terms with what had happened. What he had witnessed.
He shuddered, submitting to the role Cas had designed for him, playing into the fantasies he had only ever told Cas in the darkness, when they were alone. His legs were yanked open, spread and shackled. His cock was drooling on the bedspread.

Then, one idle Wednesday when neither of them were expecting anything out of the ordinary, a letter arrived.
Immediately, green eyes and pale skin appear in his mind’s eye and he has to blink the image away.
He feels like a penguin.
“Dean, it’s going to be fine. I know you don’t like ships, but there’s nothing to worry about.” Sam slaps a palm down onto the shining banister. “This is the finest ship in the world, remember? And not only that, she’s unsinkable. Unsinkable! You need to try and relax, enjoy the journey if you can.” In his peripheral vision, a dark-haired woman glides past, almost close enough to touch, ascending the stairs gracefully. “I know I will be.”
Everything seems so darn
It’s a weak excuse, one of Dean’s weakest to date and he knows it. He can’t look Castiel in the eye, instead focusing on his gray plaid pajama pants and bare feet. He has a scattering of hair across the joints of his toes, Dean notices. Cute. Then he remembers what’s going on and blushes a deeper shade of scarlet.
“My apologies,” he says as someone walks into him, a man with a flat cap and an Irish lilt to his voice as he throws a token ‘sorry’ back over his shoulder, running in the same direction as Sam himself is heading. He’s flanked by another man with messy dark hair, clutching a knapsack in one hand and two scrunched up pieces of paper that look like they could be tickets in the other. Sam feels a leap of excitement as he takes in his surroundings properly for the first time.
She nudges some paperwork out of the way and perches on the corner of his desk, eyeing the mounting piles of documents around him with a wary look. She’s sipping from a travel mug, probably a chai latte from the smell of it, and she puts it down and crosses her legs at the ankles, appraising him. She’s known him for a long time, since graduating college, and she’s his best friend. Best friend, confidante, sometimes-lover, never girlfriend. They tried that once and it didn’t work out. But she’s always been there for him, just as he’s been for her, and he can’t imagine life without her.
In the bedroom, Castiel curls in on himself. Knees to his chest again, chin resting on them, eyes tired and heavy. Dean sits at his side and rubs his back, at a loss for what to do now. Should he call Sam? Sam would know what to do, he always does. But before he can decide, Cas leans into him sighs.
, Dean, that you're so lazy you can't earn enough to look after this family.” She's hissing at him like a snake, all venom and ice and he can't move away. The knot in his chest is building, tightening, threatening to choke him. His back hits the counter and he realises she's shoved him, crowding him, unfinished. “All you do is work at that crappy garage. No wonder we never have any money. What kind of career is that for a man? What kind of
“It looks like they'll just sell tickets to anyone these days, doesn’t it?” Amara says, her eyes raking coldly over Meg. They both wear red, but look starkly different. Dean can't help but think that Meg looks much more comfortable in her own skin, confident in a way that doesn't appear arrogant or self-involved. The polar opposite to Amara. “But I suppose it would be silly for a charity to refuse donations, no matter where they come from.”
“Sam, come on. You’ve seen how Amara treats him. And other people. I don’t know how Dean stands for it, I swear.” Gabriel chews, swallows, gulps a mouthful of coffee all in the same three seconds. “I should have said something when she decided to be such a bitch to Castiel the other night. I think I was too shocked to respond.”
“Don't be so dramatic, Dean.” She puts her purse down on the table, fishes out her phone and starts texting. “You always get so wound up and it's childish.”
“Hi!” Her voice is crisp and sweet, British, and she stands up to greet him as he approaches. “Do you need directions to the changing rooms?”
That has sparked a huge fight and they hadn’t spoken for almost a month. Eventually, Dean had called him up and they’d met for dinner. Dean had apologised, citing a bad day at work and a fight with Amara as the cause of his sharp words, but something between them has remained stiff and uneasy ever since. Sam hasn’t brought up his concerns about his brother’s relationship ever since, not wanting to drive a wedge between them. If Dean says he’s happy, he has to believe him and trust his older brother’s judgement. But after Amara’s behaviour at the charity event and Gabriel bringing the subject up, he’s now being forced to think about it all again and the old worries are rearing their ugly heads.
2) celebrated on December 25 and now generally observed as a legal holiday and an occasion for exchanging gifts.
“Then why...?” Jack trails off, coming to his senses and realising that it isn’t his place to question his employer’s brother. But Dean just smirks, setting the crystal tumbler down with a clatter and heaving himself to his feet.
Monday night, Dean had caught him awake and he had lied, saying he was up working on his novel and that was why he couldn't sleep. Dean had smiled that big, beautiful smile of his and wrapped him in a warm hug, telling him he was so proud of Cas’ dedication. That had felt like a bucket of ice water being poured over him as guilt seeped into every pore. His novel is unfinished. He hasn't touched it in days. His own smile had been brittle and false, and when Dean had padded back down the corridor to bed Cas had collapsed onto the sofa with his head in his hands, feeling dejected.
“Go to your room,” Cas commands, his voice thick with definite emotion, and for one bizarre second Dean thinks Cas is talking to him. “And don't come out until I come get you.”
. He sways a little as he walks, puts it down to the snow beneath his feet, and gazes at the twinkling snowflakes as they gather on his clothing, blinks them out of his eyes as they land on his lashes. How can anyone not like Christmas? It’s beyond his comprehension. He checks out the house before pushing his way through the gate. Lights are on in the kitchen but nowhere else that he can see. Castiel’s car isn’t here - the garage doors are closed but Gabriel said Castiel
, he thinks sourly.
He unlocks the door and scoots to the side, letting her push it open and squeeze in to sit down next to him on the floor. She doesn’t turn on the light and he’s thankful for that. Her head comes to rest on his shoulder and she strokes his bare thigh.
She passes a hand in front of his eyes and giggles when he bats her away. “You’ve got it bad. Go talk to him!”
Somehow, the nights seem to be getting longer and darker the closer they get to spring. Although Dean considers that possibly it’s him who’s feeling darker, chasing nighttime when he can be alone and quiet and not e expected to do anything or say anything or
Also thank you to my lovely beta
It’s said in a low, gravelly tone that makes Dean’s flesh goose and the hair on the back of his neck stand on end. He licks his dry lips, dropping his gaze to the cop’s mouth, wondering what it would be like to kiss him right here, right now, on the street in the middle of Pride.
She releases him and turns away in a flurry of expensive perfume and bouncing curls and Dean sags against the counter in shock, one hand still at his cheek and the other holding himself up in case his knees give out. They feel like they might. He watches her stalk across the kitchen, tossing her hair back over her shoulder as she pulls open the refrigerator and bends down to pull out a bottle of water which she uncaps and drinks from without looking at him.
“Yeah. It is. You’re not still jealous of him, are you?”
“You could invite him to Christmas Day,” Sam suggests helpfully and Gabriel pins him with a stony look. “Come on, it’ll be fun. Winchester Christmas celebrations are always fun.”
“Don’t think about the crash,” she says and he nods, a little surprised she’s even remembered. “Everything’s okay now. You’re fine.”
“I’m sure they would. Not you, though.” It’s a statement, not a question, and Dean frowns. The man is short, stocky, all in black, with a neatly cropped beard and an air of sardonic superiority about him. He rocks his glass back and forth between two fingers, the amber liquid inside sloshing from one side to the other. A silver ring glints on his wedding finger. After a moment’s pause, he extends a hand and Dean leans in to take it warily. “Fergus Crowley. A pleasure, Mr. Winchester.”
“Because I kinda think it is. I know we don't know what happened last night but let's be real, we totally know. And whatever it is, to have Dean scampering off to stay with my cousin, it has to be something pretty bad. I've
