“Dean. If you try to keep arguing with me about this, I’ll get very upset with you over it.”
“Knock it off down there,” John barks. “Y’all fucked up and next time either of you wonders why you’re stuck on the fourth line I want you to remember this moment.”
Cas described how Heaven works once to Dean. About how, outside people’s loops of favorite memories, there’s these bright white hallways with doors. That’s what the inside of Cas’ mind looks like. Dean’s walking down a damn hallway.
“What about it?”
“Yeah?”
Dean screams. He has
“Yeah. I know you don’t trust computers, but this one’s not anything special or too fancy,” Dean promises. “And I remembered which movies you watched with me that you liked, they’re all on there so you can see them again whenever you want. And uh…” Shit, now he’s embarrassed, even though there’s no reason. “I. I know you said something about peanut butter sandwiches awhile back, so. There’s a couple waiting for you in the fridge that I made this morning before I came to get you from the hospital.”
“I wish I could see your wings.”
“Oh. Yes, I’ll be back in a moment.”
“You attracted the affections from our team leader,” Crowley mutters to him in Russian, apparently seeking privacy from the rest of the team.
It doesn’t get terribly involved, but that’s also not really necessary. And afterwards their foreheads press together while they share breaths. Dean’s palm is still on Cas’ cheek.
“Nah, I wasn’t planning on bringing Sam. Just lemme get dressed, we’ll go in ten minutes.”
The start of the 1st is pretty typical - scrumming between the first lines, D-men trying to disrupt opponents who’re screening their goalie. The checking line changes on for the Isles and Dean watches them carefully - these are young guys, extra-aggressive and with more stamina than the veterans have. John isn’t great at the “constructive” part of constructive criticism, so Dean will make mental notes and talk to them tomorrow about possible improvements.
“Yup!” Jack says, very enthusiastically from the backseat.
of the time.”
1. Graphic depictions of violence and severe injury are extensively present in this chapter - Lucifer attempts to murder Castiel and Gabriel.
A light tap on his shoulder - he startles hard enough to knock his clipboard of bee drawings to the floor, but it’s only Dean.
“Feathers.”
“Largely by being absent.”
Yes, he probably is. Cas manages to even take a nap like this, pleasantly trapped by the heavy warmth. When he wakes up Dean is still there and a nurse is checking on them - Cas has been roused by them arguing.
“What about me?”
“You’re not gonna find anything you don’t already know. Lucy’s gonna catch us with our pants down no matter how much we prepare. I’m teaching Jack to be good in a fight but there’s only so much I can cram into one day without frustrating the poor kid into a tantrum. Ergo, I’ve got some time to kill! Now help me bag a Winchester.”
Tomorrow night they’re playing the Stars. Sunday they’re playing the Coyotes. Tuesday they’re playing the Avs, then they fly back home on Wednesday to have a game against the Sens the same fucking night. Dean hates back to back games normally but having one be in a completely different time zone than the other just makes things worse by about a thousand.
“Yeah, well, I don’t forgive you for this,” Dean grumbles.
“Cas, please come back with me.”
“Super.”
“You are the only thing I love more than him.”
“I assume there’s a reason you’re seeking the pleasure of my company.”
Mary approaches from a doorway to enter the library. “Dean?”
“Guys, c’mon. Cas, help us out here, how do we know what to look for?”
“Yes, Dean?”
“What the hell, man,” Dean says while holding up three different neckties to Castiel’s shoulder.
“You’re telling me you
“Okay, why?” he gets out despite the halfassed pressure being put on his neck.
“Save it. I ain’t hungry.”
Time doesn’t flow the same in Heaven as it does on earth, and in fact can be tailored to suit the user’s needs. In this case, Gabriel deliberately slows it to a crawl for himself and his tag-alongs, so that seconds of earth time down below can last them several hours up here. This way they can be sure they won’t still be tied up in Heaven if Lucifer arrives from apocalypse-world. As a bonus, it’s giving Castiel a little bit of space for more feathers to start growing in while they work.
“He led a full-scale rebellion against Heaven, and now you want me to ask for his help.”
“Frank will maybe not be the best choice. An unreliable witness because he’s obviously insane.”
The door is flung open. “Dean, I
“Because as one’a the guys who ends up having to save the world all the time, I can tell you from endless personal experience that you pretty much always have to give something up to do it, and it never gets any easier. But that comes with the territory.” He takes a breath. “It’s just part’a being a Winchester.”
“Castiel-”
“Yeah, what does that have to do with your wings?”
“Thank you.”
“Hello Anna.”
has no respect for me,” Gabriel complains.
over this. “I guess everybody all ‘already knew’ or some shit, didn’t anyone think maybe I would’a liked to know?”
“This isn’t funny, Dean!” Castiel snaps. “I have to fix this, and I may need your help to do it.”
It might not be as long as he thinks, because then his eyes are opening and it’s still dark inside the barn. Cas is propping him up, his face is starting to dry off and itch. Sam stands there, watching.
“Why’s there no belts?” Jack asks from the backseat on the return drive.
“What? No! Course not,” Dean snorts. Then he grins. “C’mon, you grumpy bastard, I know you wanna.”
No, that’s wrong too. If an angel wanted to gank someone they’d do it themself, and - fuck, fuck, how does Dean know that? It’s starting to drive him up a god damn wall. He gets up from the pew and paces a little.
The linesman drops the puck and the Stars center snags it, but apparently miscalculates how hard he needs to snap it behind him because it skips over his teammate’s stick blade and goes rolling around the boards. Dean scrambles sideways to gain control of it before it can cross into the neutral zone, immediately passing it diagonally into the opposite corner to where Castiel has relocated. Castiel crisply scoops it up and wraps around behind the net, saucer-passing it to Kevin.
wants to die.
“Can’t you fix that?” Dean groans at him.
“Put on clean pajamas and then we can continue this argument.”
“But you… you’ve been
“Hey, Cas, you busy?”
“Um… okay. You’re welcome, I guess. Now how do I stop the itching?”
Castiel prepares himself to reassure this young version of his favorite human, but before he can speak he’s met with discharge from a firearm. Dean’s green eyes are enormous and bright with shock, likely at the fact that Castiel remains essentially unharmed.
The first thing he notes on his arrival is an aura of rage around an unfortunately very much alive John Winchester. The second thing is Dean, not even a “teenager” yet, balled up against the wall and hiccuping through sobs about how sorry he is. Castiel will not allow this to stand. He raises his hand and telekinetically slaps John away, knocking the child abuser backwards into a corner to be instantly rendered unconscious.
where I sometimes post little snippets of writing from future chapters or ramble about other things having to do with the fic, so feel free to come hit me up there if you want.
No answer. Of course there’s no answer, Dean’s over here bearing his soul or whatever and Cas ain’t even listening. Dean doesn’t know what else to do, and he doesn’t know how to get outta here, so he sits down for awhile with his head in his hands until eventually his ass goes numb and he has to stand up again.
Gabriel drops the rest of his crap and stops to watch whatever the spell is that’s about to be performed. Sam finishes adding ingredients and mixes it all for a few seconds, then grabs a pair of tweezers and plucks out one of his arm hairs with a wince and drops that in.
scary,” Lucifer says sarcastically. “Are you going to put your money where your mouth is, Mr. Flight Risk?”
The five of them head for center and take up their positions across from jerseys the color of the wrappers on spearmint flavored gum. A linesman in stripes holds the puck. Crowley is bent forward across from a Star who’s at minimum a foot taller than him.
Not even to breathe correctly. He’s pretty sure his neck bones got shattered because he can’t feel his arms and also he’s choking even though nothing’s in his mouth. Okay. Okay. This is bad. He’s never doing this again.
“Well, there you go, you know what I’m bitching about over here,” Dean grunts.
“I thought watching others sleep was socially unacceptable.”
“Cas, you’re eating a nice meal for your birthday!” he yells into the phone.
he’s seen that guy before, or at least the guy that the
“Lucifer brought angels with him,” Gabe says, cutting him off. “At least ten, maybe more. He’s probably back to full strength by now, too.”
” she says sharply, “after being hassled about this by you several times now and also looking up some things on a computer, I think I don’t actually need to understand. Just tell me the right words to describe it, I bet the ones I grew up with are wrong by now.”
It’s so dim, this feeling - he gets jostled kinda. Something outside his body is moving him around but he loses parts of the sensations because all his blood is filling up his chest right now. Sam? Sammy? Is Sam taking him off the metal shank? And why… he’s warm. But he’s lost blood before and it always made him feel cold.
dads is possessing your other real dad right now. There’s a ginormous list of reasons nobody wanted you talking to him, and it’s nothing to do with you. You’re a good kid and your head’s screwed on right as far as I can see. But Lucifer? You know how Sam and Dean are. They’re brothers, they love each other. Lucifer is my brother. And I don’t want to be anywhere near him.”
“This isn’t funny,” Cas complains. “I’m an invalid, not a toddler.”
Castiel starts chewing his again only to immediately stuff it the rest of the way back into his mouth as his line is sent, changing on man by man to take over the battle in the neutral zone. He attempts to pick the puck off an opponent’s stick but gets checked roughly away by a Stars D-man. Stumbling briefly before recovering his balance, he notes that apparently everyone else has forgotten that ice is slippery - Kevin and a Star both blow tires and the puck spins away to bounce weakly off the sideboards.
Well… if Cas’ son is there too, and it’s not just them, nobody could mistake it for them going on a date. It’s probably fine.
“Oh, kid, you know so very little about humans,” he laughs. “Really, it’s adorable. Sadly, being cute only gets you so far in life. Well, unless you’re me. But you’re
“So why didn’t you?”
“Oh.”
“No, I just think this is bullshit and I’m here for moral support,” Dean announces, landing a hand on Cas’ shoulder.
“I did actually think very carefully about your question,” he starts. “For one thing, even earlier on when we were at odds and not really acquainted with each other, you recognized me as a cognizant and intelligent being instead of just another pesky monster. If I remember right, it was your idea to ask for my help when you were trying to stave off the first apocalypse.”
“Yes, she is. Her soul is safe and in paradise where it belongs.” Castiel brushes down his hair with a palm. A crude human word - heartbroken. It comes to him. That’s how he feels about this. He wishes he didn’t have to do what he’s about to. “I’m sorry, Dean.”
“We’re not leaving a baby to die somewhere, Cas,” Dean snaps.
“Hey, babe.”
wants to believe Cas, but his brain just says “no.” He knows there’s an infamous, horrible word for what he is, it implies cheating and back in the 90s spreading AIDS from gay people to straight people. Who knows, maybe that’s changed by now, Dean doesn’t keep up with that shit really. But that’s what he grew up with. And there was that whole thing with Lee, which ended in the biggest thrashing he ever got from Dad.
“Thanks, that’s… comforting.”
Dean’s pretty sure Cas means that in an affirming kinda way or whatever, but really all it does is make him feel sick.
“Maybe you don’t gotta do this, Cas,” he practically begs afterwards.
112 subscribers! Seeing that number go up makes me happy. However... guys, um... I average 200 hits per chapter update? And yet each week I get like two comments. Three or four if I'm lucky. Not to be demanding but that's kinda discouraging sometimes.
“Yeah, Cas?”
“Me. Put me on your list, Dean. You’re on mine.”
Sam chuckles. “Dammit, don’t make me laugh. This isn’t funny…”
“Should I give Sam a present, too? Is it a special occasion?”
“You and your brother have both taken an interest in helping me disentangle my issues. So in return, is there anything I can do for you to help you? Considering you’re also in a state of extreme difficulty.”
“How’d you swing that?”
“Cas, you - okay. No. No, you cannot
“Hello, Dean.”
“Dude. With the air quotes. C’mon.”
“Because he grew up a little and figured out what he did was shitty, and he tried to do something about it. You’re still a fucking toddler and you only feel bad ’cause you got caught.”
gonna fit over top of his fucking cast. Jack is dwarfed under the bulky hockey pads and it reminds Dean of when he was a kid helping Sammy do the same thing, only with a billion layers of goalie armor that his brother could barely walk in without tripping over the giant leg pads.
“Exactly.”
Ah, perfect, he doesn’t even need to come up with a lie on his own. “Yes. The important thing is that the child is safe,” Castiel answers in a hoarse voice.
“Who are you texting?” Cas wonders, craning over his shoulder.
“I’m just loveable like that.”
Dean strokes his hair and thankfully doesn’t ask any more questions.
“Yes, should I not be?”
Sammy turns startled in a hurry. “Cas? What’re you doing?”
“Y’know, maybe you should just come stay here with me for a couple days, it might be safer.”
The cocoon of Jack’s wings unfolds fully so that he can stand up and stumble out into the hall. Castiel steadies him with a hand on his arm and walks him to his bedroom.
“Fucking seriously?” Dean snaps, forgetting to sign.
“I know! It’s nothing difficult, actually it’s kinda soothing-”
“What do you think, Dean?” Cas asks softly.
They begin rummaging the next section of shelves. Castiel works to reign in his emotions, knowing that Dean can read him very well. The circumstances torment him, however. He’s aware that for humans, bearing children is typically a joyous and fulfilling experience. It pains him to realize that this will at least partially be stolen from them, by virtue of the fact that he isn’t human. Assuming Castiel survives, which is far from a guarantee, Dean won’t be aware of either of their roles in the Nephilim’s existence.
fandom, and there are so many fics available that many inevitably get missed. So I just want to say thank you, I love you guys and I feel appreciated ^_^
“Yeah, because I’m sure your dick brother won’t punish me for no reason while he’s
“I’m sorry. Please don’t yell at me. Do you use guns a lot?”
“I just wanted you to know in case it does so that you don’t have to be surprised. But Dean and Cas are pretty much a guaranteed thing once they - okay, once
“Yes,” he agrees, nodding seriously. “I believe I have finally gotten a handle on keeping Crowley where he should be, it makes a large difference in our performance.”
“You’re so sad, Dean,” Cas says, very quietly. He’s concerned his friend will start yelling or throwing things - it wouldn’t be the first time. Dean gets upset very easily and when he gets upset he gets violent. “I believe, personally, that you are in fact worth the time and effort to be made well again. It hurts me that you’re sad. I want you to feel better. That’s all, that’s all I meant. I’m sorry.”
“But he didn’t make me touch his wings,” Sam argues.
Damn, this boy. He just can’t read between the lines, can he?
“Castiel.”
I may not be able to reply to comments for awhile after 22 October, but know that once I have access to all my internet stuff again I will read them all and be very happy :)
“I don’t understand that reference.”
“My mom was a little weird about it at first, but she’s cool now. Sammy’s totally fine obviously. Uh, there’s some other… I guess family-friends? They know and they’re fine.”
This time there’s no hesitation. “Yes.” Cas nods and squeezes his fingers slightly around Dean’s arm. “I’m perfectly fine with it.”
“Angels are made to worship God.” Okay. Not what Dean was expecting. “It’s the first thing we’re taught, as fledgelings, even before we learn to fly. We must worship God almost to the exclusion of anything else. In effect, that’s the only kind of intensive emotions we’re allowed - to love Him. So you can imagine that when an angel falls from Heaven, especially in the case that they find a more worthy cause to serve, that attention refocuses. But that’s not-” Cas stops. He looks like he’s thinking. “It took almost until now for me to understand what’s going on. Dean, I do everything that you ask. I always come when you call. And I believe that spending an extended period of time on Earth and around humans, around you, has drastically altered me. I’m currently disgraced from Heaven again for likely the next several centuries until things are back in order. But the fact that you’re so angry with me is what really makes me feel like I’ve been stripped of a home to go back to.”
“Fine.”
Fortunately, he gets to skip his afternoon group today.
“I said that?”
so very beautiful, it’s a desirable trait in a whore.”
“Do you want something?” Castiel snarls as he finally looks up. “I’m not interested in you needlessly tormenting me after you already made the morning so difficult and taxing for me
The team piles onto the ice for the 3rd. Dean goes immediately to the box to serve the final thirty eight seconds of his penalty; the first line and D-man number
“Uh. You guys. You guys know why I’m here, right?”
“Hey Cas, is there anybody out in the hallway?”
“Dude, can we not?” he finally groans. “Quit pushing me.”
“You-” No, fuck this. Dean pulls his flask from his jacket pocket and holds it out towards Sam. “Alright, c’mon.”
“But it’s not fair!” Jack yells, banging his fists against his legs.
Trigger warnings:
ADDENDUM. The above thing happened! I will kill something with my bare hands now to make myself feel better. Fuck them and their fucking cheating over-salary-cap roster, they can drop dead.
“Chasing around seagulls on the roof.”
“I always try to help, Dean. And I always fail. This one time, I need to get it right. That’s all that matters.”
“I wanted to ask about the shirt.”
Dean finishes shedding his game day suit and slips into his skates and body armor without having to think about any of it. After three decades on the ice the steps are so ingrained that he only notices what he’s doing if he actually tries to notice on purpose, which gives him time to think about other shit right up to the point where he starts taping his sticks.
They turn and come to a corner. There’s an old wooden chair with leather cushioning beside a small table, which has an oil lamp sitting on it as well as a small pile of discarded fast food packaging. Castiel squints at the words on the wrappers and wonders what a “deep fried mayonnaise ball” is, making a mental note to ask Dean about it later.
. They redo the faceoff just outside the attacking zone and Crowley wins the puck, which sees the five of them then messily break through the opposing defense and carry it over the blue line. It comes to him, he spanks a one-timer off the goalie’s leg pad for Benny to play catch with and ultimately pass to Kevin, who’s in a good spot to ring it off the crossbar.
Jack scampers in and climbs onto Castiel’s lap, knocking both helmets to the floor. “Daddy?”
A demon - no,
“Show him what he’s won, Vanna!”
was wearing. It’s tugging on a corner of his brain, and for some god damn reason he keeps remembering his dad passed out on the bed after a hunt. That wasn’t unusual at all when he was a kid, so… did him and Dad hunt an angel once and he somehow just forgot about it until now? Except if they did it would be in the journal…
“’M okay, ’m okay. Gimme a sec’n…”
“I’m a man, Cas. I ain’t ‘pretty,’” Dean snorts.
“Are you ready, Dean?”
“Yeah, I know…” Dean slides his palm down Cas’ wrist and makes the trenchcoat sleeve bunch up a little. He gets a weird idea. “Hey, sit up. Take off your coat.”
Dean has a hell of a time trying to move right now, he’s still getting healed up, nothing in him is working quite right yet. Every last drop of strength he can dig up goes into just one arm, raising a hand to feel limply and find a shoulder, more rough clothing - a collar. Actually, two collars. One of a coat and then of… that can’t be. A dress shirt?
“Like his overly-shiny soul.”
“Do you want me to wash your shirts before I return them?” he asks.
“Are you sure?”
“You’re damn right, Sasquatch.
“The other parent may survive,” Castiel points out. “It’s not impossible.” He wants to survive. And he’s also very glad his boyfriend won’t be forced to resort to infant theft.
Dean isn’t facing either of them, but Castiel has no doubt he’s rolling his eyes. “Yup. Well. Life’s a bitch and then you die, might as well smooth the ride a little, right?”
“Oh yeah, what about your wings?”
“It might end up on Deadspin…”
“Sit down, Castiel.”
“Ughn…”
Dean opens his eyes - it’s 3:32 in the morning. He’s been sleeping for less than two hours and it hurts, it
“Yes, they do, but it needs to be a specific type, or at least that’s my understanding. It generally depends on the individual as well. For instance, Dean usually refuses to tolerate overt affection of any kind. I’m forced to settle for showing it by healing and reassuring him after combat, or more recently relieving him of his night terrors. Even if your jokes weren’t troublesome in nature I believe Sam won’t enjoy grand gestures to begin with. Try something smaller.”
“I’m also aware that you have no genuine desire to help me and you’re only going along with this for your own ends,” Castiel snaps. “And if things fall through before we can finish, they’re much more likely to punish
Oh… thank god, thank god, Dean is fine. Cas breathes again and goes to the patient phone - he’ll speak to Gabriel and then have a nap.
“Exactly.”
“Yes, I’m aware. Uriel sabotaged the trap. Had he not done so, you would’ve been safe. It was outside my control just as much as yours, Dean. I apologise for that. It shouldn’t have happened that way.” Castiel refuses to change his facial expression, because that might give him away, but he needs to offer
“So what, you got a Delorean or whatever?”
ain’t vague and ominous at all. Dean stands up with a sharp wince and leaves the infirmary to go look for the kid.
He continues tapping and chews his lower lip.
(See the end of the chapter for
Now he just feels like a dick. “I’m sorry, Cas. Y’know I, I would’a still helped, I always help my friends.”
“No, it’s tucked beneath the ribcage of my vessel at the moment.”
“He did you a favor with his choice of truck too,” Dean comments. “Tacomas are a two hundred and fifty thousand mile engine inside a hundred thousand mile body, so just keep up with repairs and get your oil changed on time, that thing’ll last you awhile.”
“I understand.” And he does. “May I ask… what will happen with Dean if I succeed?”
They all watch him in silence, and Dean is seriously about to start begging god or whoever for an immediate and painless death when fucking Victor of all people starts cracking up.
“Gabriel, I’m trying to work here. Do you need something?”
“He did? When the hell was that?”
“I’m alright.”
“I see.” She watches him for a few seconds, then moves on. “Cas?”
“Give it back,” Cas demands, because that paper was drawn on by him and is therefore his property… and he absolutely can’t stand anyone touching his things. Thankfully, Dean relinquishes it without arguing.
“Okay. One, I don’t date coworkers, it’s unprofessional. And B, I don’t even date that much anyway because it’s way too risky, I can’t have fucking Deadspin getting their hands on something like that. Quit tryna ship me, Charlie.”
“Just…” Sam’s voice pulls him free from his own head. “It appeared before me, and I just - this feeling washed over me, y’know? Like - peace, like grace.”
“Okay, I’m done. Tell Gabe to let me the fuck outta here.”
“Dammit,” Sammy hisses. “Um. We’ve got some spare angel blades in storage, can you turn them into bullets in a hurry?”
his friend demands as Dean gets close to the bottom of the bottle.
And then Cas makes yet another mistake. “Dean, I-”
He can hear Cas smiling.
“He doesn’t remember sleeping with me the first time,” Dean snaps.
“Yeah, something like that.”
“I know,” Castiel says, interrupting him. He takes a large, albeit pointless, breath. “Sam, before I get into this, just know going in that I love you like my own brother.”
“This isn’t funny, Dean,” Cas snaps.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why can’t he draw what he wants?” Dean snorts.
“We’ll be fine,” Cas insists stubbornly. He’s perfectly aware that this isn’t the most intelligent choice, but he’s been out of the hospital for less than a week and he’s done moving around for the time being. “Thank you for letting me know.”
This is how Castiel and Crowley end up sitting on their asses at center ice, not moving and ignoring John as he barks at them to get back up. Finally he demands to know why.
She shakes her head in a slightly self-deprecating way that wouldn’t look out of place at all on Dean. “If I hadn’t gotten myself stuck there in the first place-”
“Cas, you don’t fucking get it, okay? It ain’t about punishment or whatever. I gotta work with other hunters sometimes and if Sammy and me need their help to get a case done, to
“Can you be more specific?” Castiel asks, despite knowing exactly what Dean’s referring to.
so I’m going to teach you other stuff to use when cuteness fails!”
“Our penalty kill units seemed to be in good form on Tuesday,” Castiel points out. “I don’t believe we’re in serious danger.”
He reaches out slightly, plants an idea for Sam.
“Don’t mention it.”
“It’s raining…”
“If Dean was an angel, yeah. But Dean can’t usually see wings, he only can right now because Cas is in his head.”
The end result is Cas lying on the emergency department stretcher, breathing from a mask that’s pressing his battered face while both of his hands and wrists have been fully immobilized. He’s now waiting for x-rays and the only thing currently in his favor is that they’ve granted him a moderately effective pain medication.
“Can you move?” he demands.
“Please don’t be angry with me.”
There’s something nearby listening. His hunter instincts say so, actually they’re screaming at him
“I see.” Even though he technically doesn’t need to anyway, Castiel suddenly finds it difficult to breathe. “And here I thought I was hiding it successfully.”
“Cas if you keep saying shit like that we can’t be friends anymore,” Dean threatens, only half-joking. “We’ll do apple, can’t go wrong with the classics.”
God, this is so fucking adorable and Dean kinda feels bad, like he’s seeing something private. He thinks about going over and tapping the guy’s shoulder, but Castiel doesn’t like to be touched apparently so instead Dean just walks into the edge of his field of view.
“Hey, um.” Sam steps into the room and awkwardly fidgets. “I’ve been thinking about this for weeks now, and. I uh. I wasn’t gonna say anything, but.” A deep breath. Sam watches the floor. “Cas. Are you…? I mean. You’re not… right?”
But Lucifer is alone, and Gabriel has Jack to help, and that makes
There’s also an underlying strangeness to the situation - Castiel has never fought while in tune with a vessel before, he’s always been the one dictating every action, but now he’s “plugged in” to all of Dean’s neurological impulses in preparation to mimic each physical action whether gross or minute. Dean is in charge and Castiel is powering him, to such a degree that the line dividing where one of them ends and the other begins is so blurred as to be virtually undetectable.
“Let me finish, bonehead! Explode harmlessly and shower him in pink paint.”
“Well, Cas was either lying or being stupid,” Sam huffs. “Mom, please just trust me. I’ve had to watch them together for like ten years now, if it wasn’t for the brainwashing incident they probably would’ve gotten together in half that time.”
She’s laughing at him. He hates that.
“Do you want some water or anything?”
“Yeah, Cas, I’m okay.”
“Yes, I know. But there are important differences between angelic and demonic possession. Besides that Dean and I have been through a lot together, we’ve known each other for almost ten years. I care about what happens to him more than anyone else, including myself. As much as it’s within my power to do so, I won’t let any further harm come to your son while he’s recovering.” Castiel pauses for a moment before changing the subject. “Mary… thank you for looking after Jack while you were over there. He’s immeasurably powerful, but he is still a child. I’m glad you were there with him.”
“Oh yeah? Why am I worth it?” Dean argues, mostly because he has no idea what the hell to say.
It’s enough to make him get upset. He didn’t want Sammy to save him. Not this time. He wants to yell at his brother but he can’t move his jaw, his chin is resting on… something. Through his stubble he can feel some kind of fabric, coarsely textured. An arm across his back. And. A palm on the back of his head, stroking his hair a little bit. Somebody’s hanging onto him, propping him up.
yourself like that? Come on, man!”
Speaking of. Jack comes running out of his room at top speed and Castiel drops everything in order to catch him and scoop him up.
to have any of those little Cas-isms to watch and silently make fun of.
“What’s wrong with him?”
in here?”
He shrugs. “You got your wings back.”
“DAMN” Dean starts laughing. “THAT MEANS WHEN I COME VISIT YOU GUYS I CAN GET TWO KIDS HOPPED UP ON SUGAR AND RUNNING AROUND IN A CRAZE”
Prior-Castiel’s head snaps up to look at him. Confusion crosses his vessel’s face, his wings tuck inwards slightly with uncertainty. “Who are you? Why do you look like me?”
Dean climbs over the bench wall with Benny, Cole, and Crowley, and as they head for the faceoff dot right of the Habs goalie he wonders if this is a deliberate choice in favor of violence on his dad’s part. Between him, Cole and Crowley, they averaged forty five penalty minutes last season, and in Dean’s case specifically more than half of his 52 PIM (higher than any of his teammates) was just from throwing hands. Benny is the only exception: last season he had just twenty two penalty minutes, which is perfectly average.
“Dean, you’re an involuntary admission. I’m sorry, but until the doctor knows you’re stable, you won’t be able to leave.”
Jack’s gloves and pants are turquoise blue and his socks and helmet are white, so it’s adorably ridiculous now that he’s in a bright orange practice jersey. Maybe Dean should’ve snatched one of the white ones instead. He closes the helmet strap under Jack’s chin and then fastens down the face-cage, and once he’s satisfied that everything’s in place he throws on his own helmet and they head out onto the fresh ice with their sticks. It feels funny to be missing a glove but there’s not much he can really do about that, and either way it’s super unlikely that Jack would be able to hurt him.
as he’s scratching it away from the skin.
“Yes, I understand. You have every right to be upset with me. What I did was wrong and you suffered for it greatly.”
“That’s not true,” Cas insists, shaking his head. “Not completely, anyway. I don’t like that you’re so angry with me, and by extension I don’t like that I did anything to make you get so angry. Presented with a similar situation in the future, I’ll make better choices than I did this time. I want…” Cas watches his feet. “I want us to trust each other again, Dean. I just don’t think you’re going to give me the chance. You don’t let go of anger easily.”
“Okay. Uh. So why are you here?”
“He escaped from prison three days ago. Are you safe there?”
“Yes, I see that now. I would appreciate you not mentioning it to Dean. As far as I’m aware, he doesn’t know and I’m also sure he doesn’t reciprocate. But I promise it had nothing to do with my decision to facilitate his healing process. I would’ve done this for Sam, too, in the same circumstances.”
“Bela I will
Distantly, he senses something. But what he finds is frightening. A greater demon, one that by all accounts shouldn’t even still exist, holding a number of captives seemingly for the purposes of amusement. Castiel rummages his knowledge of the demonic and is forced to reach back much further to things he learned when he was a little younger, perhaps two hundred thousand years ago. Lucifer creating greater demons. There was Lilith, Cain, Alastair, Princes and Knights. What he detects is not a Knight - much too powerful - so likely a Prince, because he would’ve easily recognized Cain.
“Thanks for having my back, Dean,” Sam grumps sarcastically while serving himself some kind of fruit-something for breakfast.
“Cas, the
“Oh! So your wings weren’t supposed to look like that before? All the angels’ wings look like that in this world, I just thought mine and Lucifer’s and Gabriel’s are different because we’re archangels. Or partially in my case.”
“Am I… am I better?” she whispers as he withdraws.
“So angels are really just Heaven’s janitors?” Dean snickers as he walks up the blinding white hallway. Seriously, it’s whiter than a fucking Mr. Clean commercial. He almost wants sunglasses.
than normal. Dean tries not to swallow too obviously and fucks around with Cas’ suit jacket like it needs to be straightened. At least the stupid trenchcoat isn’t present tonight; it’s just way too hot and the air is too sticky for that.
“Well, the versions available for humanity’s consumption have been redacted and edited many times. The original stories have been so watered down and distorted that over sixty five percent of what’s printed in those may be safely ignored,” Castiel informs him.
“Yeah, okay. How do you feel?”
“Idjit,” he mutters when the door closes. “Cas.”
“We gotta find them first,” Dean insists, shaking his head. “Tryna steal a baby from a hospital is one of the shittiest things we could do, especially if this poor bastard is mourning his wife and stuff. Gotta find them first and bring ’em here.”
“Really, Cas? Buy me a drink first!”
“Actually I did, Dean,” Sam says in a very self-congratulatory tone. “And the angel told me. He hasn’t done anything… yet. But he will.”
“Nothing,” Dean grunts.
“How? In what possible fucking universe is this
“If you need to, yeah.”
“You don’t even know what I was going to say,” she comments flatly.
“Fair. Okay. Dean, whatever you do, don’t overcomplicate this. There are exactly zero problems here. Just make him another sandwich, give it to him when he wakes up, and tell him you love him. And everything will be fixed, I guarantee it. But also you should apologize to him for being a dumbass, too. Because that’s totally on you.”
He considers the situation. Assuming they decide to proceed with a relationship, Cas knows enough to understand that this isn’t a magic cure for anything. He still needs to recover, both physically and mentally, from what happened just over two weeks ago. Dean isn’t back on his feet yet and will still have bad days, even though he’s adhering to his medication schedule now; he still has alcohol problems and those won’t fix themselves either. But they can help each other deal with these difficulties at least. And it’s entirely possible that in the future they’ll reach a point resembling mentally healthy people, become a reasonably normal couple with normal couple problems.
Actually it’s kinda impressive. Sam can’t see Gabriel’s wings, after all, or perceive them in any other way. So he would’ve had to go through the trouble of finding a spell to harm an angel’s wings, modify it to achieve the desired effect, and then cast it when it would’ve been originally very difficult but now made even harder by the change in outcome.
“Of course, I asked him first… several times,” he admits. “Sam, I always ask first. I wouldn’t ever betray his trust by behaving otherwise. It’s even convenient for him, because he wakes up in the kitchen with coffee already waiting for him.”
“I hate you guys!”
John immediately glares at Dean. “Go get him, I ain’t finished yet.”
And Dean is obviously the other parent, completely unaware. Castiel has no choice but to keep him in the dark because if he does find out, and then less friendly angels discover that he knows, they won’t hesitate to murder him. So Castiel will say nothing. He has three and a half months to concoct a nice convincing lie, as well as devise some way to ensure that he’ll actually survive what’s coming. The details around angels giving birth to Nephilim are frustratingly absent, so he has no blueprints to work from. Most of the available data pertains to humans.
“Jerk.”
Angel? What angel? There shouldn’t be any angels here at this time. Castiel is it at the moment and only because he’s time-displaced.
“This part is softer,” Cas comments, drawing attention to apparently a specific section of Dean’s hair about an inch up from the back of his neck.
“Then why aren’t you giving him agency?”
Castiel shakes his head. “No.
“Dude, c’mon, we’re so fucking far past ‘uncomfortable’ by now.”
“Gabriel has a very poorly-handled ‘crush’-” Fuck, him and those air quotes! “-on your brother. When Ramiel skewered me I said as much because I was reluctant to die without having done so. Yes, Dean. Not all angels, certainly, but many are capable of love and I’m one of them. How do you think nephilim came to be such an issue that Heaven decided to make a protocol specifically for them? Angels absolutely do love, slightly less than half will choose mates for themselves. We can love each other and we can love human beings. It just tends to be strongly discouraged.”
Cas hasn’t been kissed by very many people. In point of fact his very first relationship happened two weeks before his nineteenth birthday, and the guy had to teach him to kiss back. That had been something of a revelation. He’d always assumed people instinctively knew how to kiss - but no, as it turns out, it’s a learned skill like most other things in life. There were only a handful of others after that initial relationship, too. Cas is concerned he might be out of practice - but then Dean’s hand moves from his shoulder to the side of his face and he forgets to worry or even to think at all, because
is and anyone who’s spent more than five minutes in a room with those two knows it).
Dean goes into the living room and takes a long gulp of liquor. He’s so fucking done with everything right now. Future-Cas, who he probably can’t trust. Now-Cas, who he
“Careful with that one, the spine’s kinda fragile,” Bobby comments from over at his desk.
“He said he is.”
“Uh. Yes, Cas, I do know that. You’re lucky he can’t reach through the phone and deck you or he would’ve after the second time.”
“This is what they look like,” Cas insists, holding up his paper. “Some of the patients and some of the doctors. I don’t understand why nobody else can see it but me.” He feels frustrated just by describing it. “Nobody believes me, but now I can show them and maybe someone else will notice what’s going on.”
They hang up and Dean slumps into his couch. He didn’t even do much today besides physical therapy but he feels exhausted suddenly, there’s just over two weeks left before he can start playing again and the pressure is starting to come back. He’ll ask Victor and Cas to give him the Cliffs notes on how everyone’s been playing at the next practice, which… wait… actually…
Cas watches the others - one used to be a political cartoonist, and his drawing is very in keeping with that style; one did a watercolor painting of a bird leaving a cage in a manner that could suggest either flying or falling; one scribbled out the crude image of a grassy field catching fire.
“Nope, and I prob’ly never will. It’s fine. Sammy’ll prob’ly have kids someday, they can come up and hang out with me during the summers or something.” Dean shakes his head. “Are you
“Yes, like his soul. Rest assured, Dean, your soul is also very beautiful and attractive.”
“So last I heard you were in some pretty big trouble, boy,” Bobby comments when they’ve let go.
“Mom…! That’s - that’s not the point, okay?” Sam shouts. “And Cas wouldn’t do that anyway, he has a huge guilt complex about ruining the lives of Jimmy’s family. I don’t think he’d ever take a different vessel again after that.”
“Dude, you’re depressing me over here.” Dean flops backwards onto his mattress. “And I mean it, Cas. I really am sorry.”
“Yes, sir.”
and lemme tell you that gets old in a hurry.”
At the time, it seemed like a great decision, because he hooked up with another twenty-year-old who was really cute and at a kinda-nearby apartment. Then the next day when the All-Star Weekend started he discovered that, actually, this really cute twenty-year-old was a second round draft pick for the Oilers who was hanging out there to support his teammates. Oops.
The only time he ever got laid was with a chick!”
“Dammit, Gabe,
Dean is silent for much too long. Eventually: “You kinda got a point there, huh?”
“The names of all the Prophets are printed on the inner eyelids of every angel.”
“Excellent, thank you.”
“Sure looked like it. I don’t think he did it on purpose, if that makes any difference.”
“Well think about it - Ketch and Deano bolted as soon as the portal was opened up, and Cassie didn’t get back for a few more hours after that. You kept talking to me even though I didn’t say anything back, and you never tried to force me to take my grace like he did. It was more the sound of your voice than the words, I knew you weren’t hostile. That’s how I figured out where I was. You should know, actually, how much I appreciated that, even if I was still being kind of a dick in the immediate aftermath.”
sinks in, Lucy: every bad, awful thing that’s ever ‘happened’ in your life is something you did to yourself, you self-absorbed bastard.”
“Yes.”
“Please don’t do that anymore. He’s never going to respect you, the list of people he has genuine respect for is extremely short.”
That gets his attention. “Damn, really?”
“It won’t. She’s good at her job.”
Cas wills himself into silence and stillness. Faintly, he still catches the occasional sound of Lucifer thrashing their brother on the floor below. How long until Dean gets here? If he speeds, probably seven minutes, nine if there’s too many red lights. How long is seven minutes, though? If Lucifer finds him (which admittedly is very likely), can Cas survive long enough to be rescued? Is Gabriel still alive down there?
The intermission report is just barely starting when Dean’s phone rings - the name on his screen is shocking.
“Hey, Cas.”
Dean yanks his phone out of his pocket and calls Charlie.
Cas rubs his back a little, because on tv that’s something you do to help someone else feel better. Dean doesn’t start yelling at him for it, so he takes that as a positive affirmation and keeps doing it, very gently like with a baby animal. Dean trembles slightly under his palm but still makes no move to stop him.
“Why, is something wrong?”
“Because I don’t want people knowing what they are,” he snorts. “Especially not my dad.”
“Last time I saw Bobby was when Crowley tried stuffing his soul back into Hell during the second trial.”
“That has no bearing on anything aside from the fact that it will make it much easier for me to see what Jack is doing from time to time. Frankly, Dean, I’m not sure I’ll feel comfortable leaving you by yourself for the time being, especially since it’s abundantly clear that Sam isn’t capable of handling the situation.”
know that angel wings don’t work like bird wings or bug wings. They don’t “flap,” and flying isn’t actually flying. It’s changing locations without actually moving. So, there must be something in the brain that has to do with it, right? God-Chuck-no,
from the front with his fingernails.
“Pfft,
Castiel looks up from where he’s folding a shirt into his luggage. “What is it with your obsessive panicking about Deadspin? There are a number of much more interesting things they could be paying attention to besides you going to a store with a friend. Besides, if she knew who we were, don’t you think she would’ve said something? Hockey fans aren’t subtle.”
“I’unno,” Jack shrugs. “I just want pizza instead.”
“Yeah, I know.” Dean slowly comes in and picks a spot on the ground a few feet away. “My dad died ’cause of something I did. I was uh, I was in the hospital, and I was gonna die. It was this real weird outta-body-experience thing and there was this reaper and - y’know, if I didn’t fight her off, I would’a just bit it and maybe my dad would still be alive today. Or maybe not. Maybe he would’a got killed on a hunt the next week, or he could’a died during the first apocalypse. There ain’t really a way to know for sure how that would’a turned out for him. But he sold his soul to a Prince of Hell so that I would live. I hated myself for it for a really long time.”
“Sure, yeah. Alright, I’mma let you go, buddy, you should get back to the locker room.”
“Technically yes.”
At least they’re going home after this.
This only succeeds in angering Dean again. “So that’s what this is?” he spits, throwing off his flannel and yanking up the sleeve of his undershirt. “You fucking wrote ‘property of Cas’ on me?”
Dean shakes his head and leaves. Cas can’t blame him.
on PornHub and fucking Gabriel popped up, I was
for NHL players anyway, considering all the road trips and spending so much time at practice and working out, but when you’re not straight it would be easier for a first-time gamer to beat Doom Eternal on
Dean’s so glad for that.
Dean opens his eyes and - why the fuck is he in the infirmary?
“Yeah.”
he wonders, studying his captain.
“Your brother seems to love you very much. That’s why he stopped you.”
“Are there real-life spells and curses that are broken by true love’s kiss?” Jack wonders, very serious about the idea.
“Oh shit, yeah, thanks for reminding me. How’s everyone doing during games? I mean I kinda know already but watching on tv or from the press box ain’t the same as being on the bench.”
He’s said he’s sorry before, but this is the only time he ever actually seemed guilty and shit. So, yeah, my vote is that’s… y’know, Future-Cas and he’s telling the truth.”
want to keep doing it then find a way to stop. And if you love Cas then be with him, too.”
“On a human scale, it would be different…” Cas mumbles, not opening his eyes.
Then, John’s voice randomly gets his attention again, because he’s very predictably torturing Dean. “You’re the damn captain, you oughta know better!”
It’s a lot of small, brain-numbing tasks ahead. Warding in certain spots so that they can control two or three ways for Lucifer to even get inside, angel traps at a couple of points that Dean now has to avoid because Cas will get him stuck in them if he’s not careful, circles of holy oil. Dean’s never been able to feel the effects of angel warding before but now he gets hit with a frantic burning itchiness under his skin if he gets too close to them - he wonders if that’s how it usually is for Cas or if he’s just noticing Cas’ actual reaction to it.
“Dean?”
“If you say so.” Dean eats the cookie in about two bites. “Hm, these ain’t bad. Pie’s better though.”
“Yeah, he will. Cas, um, did something happen yesterday?”
The Islanders didn't make it to the final and I'm having feelings of Rage about that. Tampa Bay is eighteen million dollars over their salary cap, WHICH IS CHEATING. They're cheating and now in the final. I can't fucking believe that I, primarily a Bruins fan, am now being forced to root for Montreal. It's incredibly unnatural and I want everyone involved in the TBL franchise to die a slow horrible death just for that fact alone.
The sixty sixth day is interesting because there’s a snowstorm outside and several staff are missing from the unit.
“Aww, that’s
Dean just groans.
“Be careful, Dean.”
“DOESN’T MATTER” is Dean’s answer, which Castiel almost misses because he’s in such shock. “MY CONTRACT GETS RENEGOTIATED AT THE END OF THIS SEASON AND NOBODY WILL TAKE ME”
Mary shakes her head, which is in direct contradiction to what she says next. “Do you love Dean?”
“Okay, I’ll get into contact with your sister and then with Raphael’s legal office to notify him that we’re contesting your agency. While it’s being contested, I can probably block him from transferring you to a different facility.”
“Does that mean Dean can’t be your mate?” Jack seems extremely upset by the concept. “Won’t you get lonely?”
Dean and Sam begin to argue and his attention refocuses.
“I am, but that
from me!”
“You weren’t,” Cas assures him. The weakness of his voice is frustrating. “I’ll recover eventually.”
“Did I miss lunch?” Cas asks, interrupting them.
The medical trainers walk onto the ice with their stretcher. It must be a head injury, that’s why they need so long to move him, they have to brace his neck first. Anyone who leaves on a stretcher won’t come back for the rest of the game. Sims isn’t even sent to the box, the officials determine a game misconduct and he’s ejected entirely for the remainder of the match. No doubt a suspension or a fine will follow.
“I know.”
“Four and a half billion years is a long time to know someone, Gabriel.”
“Sam and Dean and Mary are all behaving weirdly about Cas possessing Dean. But I thought it’s a good thing, because now he’ll get better.”
“Yes, aside from my hands. I have something to tell you, in part because you said before that you wished I’d come to you instead of harboring the knowledge on my own.”
“Don’t bump my nose, it’s still broken,” Cas blurts out.
“Nothing, just-” Dean shakes his head and spoons Cas some more pudding before answering. “Man, it’s a damn shame, that’s all. You’re a really handsome guy and now your face is all fucked like that, I know it’s gonna get better eventually but… damn. You’re gonna have no luck with the fellas for awhile.”
They go to the day room to eat their lunches. Cas feels refreshed and calm after his nap, and with Dean sitting at the same table it’s easy for him to not be afraid of the demons despite the strange staff that are present today.
He reads aloud what he wrote, unflinchingly. Two demons and one patient snicker as he talks until Dean glowers at them, and Cas is very glad Dean came with him. When the remaining patients have completed the exercise, the group is let go and Cas sits in front of the tv for a few minutes. Despite flipping through at least three times, he finds nothing worth watching, and so relinquishes the remote to another patient before returning to his room while he waits for dinner to arrive.
“Apologies.” Castiel stops when he sees the shelves of books with angels’ names on them. In the flickering light of a nearby flame, he realizes that he and his 2011 counterpart have separate books - when he reaches out to grab one his entire form locks into stillness until he can’t even move his eyes. He concedes and Death releases him again, and he lowers his hand to his side. “I only meant to fix my mistakes.”
Castiel repeats, determined to do so.
His friend looks sad, but not guilty. “Dean, I reassembled you at the cellular level when I raised you out of the Pit. There isn’t a single thing about you I don’t already know. And… incidentally, being that this was before I fell and grew a conscience, had I found anything about you terrible or undesirable, believe me when I say I would’ve omitted it from your reconstruction. And I in no way saw fit to do so.”
“Yes,” Cas lies.
Castiel decides this will be his project while Dean takes a nap.
It’s only because his head rolled sideways that he can even see Cas struggling to get up from the ground and crawl over to him. Cas’ wings are out, like all the way out, the feathers are full of grass and sand - one of them looks like it maybe snapped near a joint or got dislocated because it’s dragging along through the dirt instead of lifted and folded up neatly like the other one. Apparently that’s why it takes angels so long to bounce back from being banished, it brings out their wings and they land bad so they have to heal first.
Gabriel hangs up before Cas can even open his mouth to protest or explain that he was napping. The tension of his body is hurting him, so he relaxes back into Dean again in the hope of dispelling the profound discomfort. Dean continues to patiently cushion and cradle him.
“I just wish this wasn’t so hard for you.”
Castiel isn’t sure whether he should laugh or immediately find and attack his brother. He settles for rolling his eyes. “Please don’t say things like that, Dean’s doing his best.”
Cas barks.
It’s kinda too bad. Sam would’ve been a fantastic NHL goaltender, especially being so damn tall as an adult.
Raphael appears to consider this. “And you would act as a neutral mediator.”
“Hey, kid.”
“You may ‘suck’ at expressing it in a satisfactory and unambiguous way, but that doesn’t mean you’re incapable of feeling it. I know you’re not. Usually you seem to feel it very intensely. It’s painful for you.”
“Yes, I’ve… noticed.”
Castiel tunes out his head coach and brings his attention back to his skates, tucking the laces under his shin guards and tugging down the ends of his leg socks before taping them in place. He’s much more interested in his equipment than the needlessly irritating and overly critical speeches from John Winchester. At least for this game he has the correct gloves and helmet, unlike their season opener.
“What about me, Dean?”
“Cool. Thanks, Charlie.”
“When have you ever known him to be honest about anything?”
“I can check the demon warding around the house before we start-”
“Well yeah. But. Not just that.”
Cas wonders.
now like he hasn’t spent his entire life discharging firearms indoors with no earplugs.
Forty five people have subscribed to my fic, I feel loved ^_^
He wishes he could be soothing, but that can’t happen now. “I have orders. Those orders don’t come with explanations in the majority of cases. You’re physically well again. That should be sufficient.”
“Yes, I understand.”
Castiel feels carefully. He seems to be past the majority of the demons by now, and so risks briefly searching for any markers of Gabriel’s presence. There are two other archangels currently trapped down here, but they’re both in the Cage, which is practically on the opposite side of the Pit.
“So how do we find them?”
“Don’t. Interrupt me.” So quiet. Why is Lucifer so quiet? It would be less uncomfortable if he was yelling and pitching a fit. “You know, I remember when you stopped being a baby and turned into a little kid, and dad was so unhappy when he took you to that shrink and found out you’re broken. So, um. If you really think about it, Castiel, I’m kinda about to do you a favor. Because your life is so… what’s the word I want here…
Castiel aches at the blatant pain that’s been presented to him.
you to feel bad for that, because I never met someone else who could just fuck up on that big of a scale!”
“Relax,” his brother snorts. “Me and Sam and Jack have been working on it together the last couple weeks. Jack’s super-extra-majorly powerful, but he’s just a baby, and I’m only one currently-guy-shaped-wavelength of celestial intent. There needs to be at least one other archangel to help me out with everything on my plate.”
“Y’know what - no. Screw this. Come up with something better. Until then, this conversation’s over.”
So incidentally I love Mary and she, like most of the characters on the show who aren't cishet male and/or white, deserved better. She's literally the first character they fridge in the show and then they fridge her
“Nothing unexpected,” Castiel informs her, dumping out his gear bag on the living room floor so he can disinfect all the pieces of his body armor and hang them up on the rack to dry. “Where’s Jack?”
“Dude, you’re about as subtle as… y’know what, that doesn’t even work! There’s pretty much nothing on
“I never said I was. Alright, so housing’s in progress, getting the truck back is in progress. The next thing we have to do is get your food benefits back again, since you were here it lapsed but that’s probably not a hard fix.”
“Okay, bud.”
“Sure. Whatever. What kinda pizza you like, Cas?”
get healed. Enough’a the mixed fucking signals already, okay?! What the
“Hungry.”
After that the drive of the game takes over. Castiel manages to win the faceoff and snap the puck backwards to one of his teammates, and the Islanders scatter, trying to get better positioned to spear into the attacking zone. It comes back to him and Castiel bludgeons aside a Devil just before crossing the blue line with the puck on his blade. An opposing D-man is attempting to disrupt him, but he refuses to be wrong-footed. He self-passes by slapping the puck into the sideboards and then darting around the Devil to collect it again, then bumps it to Crowley, who’s well positioned to potentially make a shot.
“So shirts aside, I did actually come here on business,” Sam interrupts. “Now that Anna has agency, we’re gonna start looking at housing for you once you’re discharged.”
Cas watches his feet. “Dean. I… when Raphael began threatening to restart the apocalypse, this was before Sam came back into your life. You were with Lisa and Ben, and I know how hard you worked to get away from hunting after what happened at Stull. You already did so much for the world, Dean. I didn’t feel I had the right to ask for anything else.”
“Dean, I have to go to therapy, can this possibly wait another hour?” Cas groans. “And why are you watching porn this early to begin with?”
The quiet wing-flappy noise. “Hello.”
me to the point where it took a week and a half to finish the Cas POV section of this chapter >_<
real quick before something awful happens.”
Cas thinks, very abruptly.
Cas retreats from the encounter and drinks a carton of orange juice, then takes a can of ginger ale back to his room. He doesn’t like ginger ale but Dean drank it sometimes, so he’s going to have some now while he goes back to his endless drawings of bees.
“Yeah, I’ll get to him when Sam gets him back inside,” Bobby mutters. “Here, make yourself useful and help me smash these things.”
“BITCH”
“Will you also be okay eventually?” The words make themselves without his permission even though he knows the answer to this question.
Dean’s eggs scramble for a second. Because on the rack, the demons who come by to cut on him are disguised as Dad, as Sam, as Mom. His hands shake because he can see all the blood they’re covered in. Nothing’s coming to save him, he wants to scream for help but his throat got pulled out hours ago, oh god, oh god, they’re gonna let the hellhounds come over to chew on him for awhile-
The PR guys start calling for Lee to get a move on, and the room calms down again. Dean tries not to think about how the rest of the team will hear about this before the game against Tampa tomorrow night. He knew that would happen, so there’s no point obsessing over it. (Understanding this is in no way stopping him from obsessing over it.)
“You’ll be alright, Dean,” Cas promises. They barely pull back from each other, less than a foot of space between their chests. “I’m doing this so that you’ll be alright.”
“Why, ’cause you’re in my head?”
“You sure this is a good idea, Cas?”
“Jack,” he whispers. “I’m-I’m sorry, buddy, I know you don’t want people praying to you and all that shit. But Cas still hasn’t woken up and I’m getting real scared by now that he ain’t gonna at all. So uh. You don’t even hafta do anything, just-just tell
Actually, no, that’s not even it. Or maybe that’s part of it, but it ain’t the whole thing. Dean just… he wishes Mom gets to be right, even though she’s long gone. Because if there’s angels there’s a Heaven, and her soul went there. Maybe after Dad escaped Hell through Colt’s devil’s gate he went up there too and they’re together again like they should be.
“I forgot how annoying it is when they randomly pop in and out like that…” Sam mutters before another bite of salad.
Cas nods and returns his attention to the plate of spaghetti in front of him. After sixty four days, he does sometimes wish there were more items on the meal list, because on a menu of twenty or so items only eleven are palatable to him due to his sensory issues. (He never understands why so many foods require cooked onion, slices of cooked onion remind him of chewing on worms if worms had bones.)
“My brother the serial killer may be in the area.”
Dean wakes up with an empty bottle still in his hand and a headache to slay a fucking walrus, and also tears in his eyes that have nothing to do with the headache. He can still almost feel Cas in his arms… and fuck,
“I just made a ten hour drive, Gabe.”
In any case, Dean doesn’t answer. He watches coldly as Castiel checks the body. “You killed him.”
“Well, look at you, projecting all your abandonment issues onto an innocent kid,” Gabriel mocks, waving his archangel blade sardonically at his brother. “I’d say get over yourself, but there’s not much point anyway since you’re not gonna walk outta this building.”
“It’s Dean’s, he told me to give it to you because the last time we bent the rules about the phone he said you sounded really sad.”
That’s not to say Jack doesn’t wear one of those. He’s currently in possession of multiple child-sized hockey jerseys, one Sens with the number
“Thought you hated touching people.”
Castiel begins to detect the same presence as before and stiffens in apprehension. He’s attracting too much attention and he must go or risk putting his friends in danger. Pulling away from his favorite human, he plunges into time again and dives, reaching even further. He desperately hopes that if he hides far enough back he’ll evade whatever it is that now pursues him in addition to Naomi.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I see.” No, he doesn’t see, but she doesn’t need to know that. “Was there anything else?”
“I love you, Dean.”
“It’s time for breakfast,” she insists in an overly-cheerful voice. She reaches over Cas and nudges Dean’s shoulder until he begins to grumble. “Good morning, Dean!”
“Because… you’re the captain?” Kevin guesses.
“No, because it’s not up to you, or me, or God. It’s up to him. He has an entire shelf of outcomes laid out and every one of them rewrites itself
Castiel drinks half a bottle of Gatorade in one swallow and begins chewing his mouthguard as he sits - it’s almost time for a replacement, this one is already almost to the end of its lifespan due to his aggressive stimming.
Cas isn’t able to open the car door on his own (his splint won’t fit through the handle), but once he’s inside he can pull it shut after him without help. It makes him think of his truck. Once the splint comes off and his arm is no longer in a sling, which will both happen around the same time, he should be alright to drive again even with the cast on his wrist.
The basic theme of these short interviews is more or less the same from what Dean understands. They’re each talking a little about how being not-straight or not-white (or in Cas’ case, not-not-autistic) is a more positive experience being on the Isles’ roster compared with whatever expectations they might’ve had before coming to the NHL or being out or what-fucking-ever. Except for Daniel, who was probably handed an actual script and told to prove what a good ally he is. And all ten interviews will have little snippets taken and cut together so the fans will never see a full picture of what each of them has actually said.
“Yeah. ’Cause now you can’t just fly off if I ask a question you don’t like.”
Cas backs away from Raphael, shaking his head. He can’t. He can’t. His lungs won’t breathe and he shakes uncontrollably.
Cas expertly begins preening the other wing, working a lot faster and easier than Dean did on the first one. Singed down and char-broiled feathers drift lazily away to the bedroom floor like a black snowfall.
“Nope, it’s all me.” They zip back to the bunker. “Now, one last thing…” Gabriel reaches around his own back to yank one of the smaller, softer feathers out of his wing with only a tiny flinch of pain. “And now we go pester the giant.”
“Well, maybe you’re just special,” Gabe snarks with that obnoxious-ass grin of his. “I’m sure you’ll figure it out.” And then he flies away.
Dean can barely notice any of this going on. His entire brain is on whichever bone got broken in the base of his hand, which is throbbing angrily at him for daring to fall incorrectly after he got run over by another hockey player.
“Yes, I’m aware. My contract is only one year, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens. I don’t want to move Jack, it might be unfairly hard on him.”
“Yeah, Cas?”
“Nope, sorry. I’m way more handsome than that guy.”
A small nod. “Alright.”
“Maybe not, but you’ve worked to make up for it since then. So on some level you’re aware that what John did to you was wrong. You don’t need to defend him anymore, and continuing to believe all the awful things he said to you is only punishing yourself for no reason.”
Castiel deliberately ignores the hostility that’s radiating off of Dean like heat from a fire. He can’t deal with it, there’s nothing he can do to change it, it’s his own fault. He must focus instead on controlling the outcome of the events currently unfolding. He
“Oh.” Cas has no idea what to say. He doesn’t know his oldest brother, Michael was already ten years old when Cas was born. “Um. Hello.”
“Well that’s perfect, the bunker’s warded, we can bring them here and nobody will find them,” Sam exclaims.
“You’re no fun, Samsquatch.”
“Then say it now,” Castiel prompts quietly.
Cas' truck is not one of the trucks he has in the show, it's actually my truck because I love my truck :D plus, Tacomas are unkillable. They're the best pickup trucks and everyone should have one.
“Yeah. Get pie,” Dean says as he slowly manages to get himself in bed. The relief when he finally stops moving is so good that he doesn’t even bother trying to get his boots or jacket off.
Dean’s also not sure he’ll ever be able to say it back. But Cas tells him every so often for the past four days, and just because it’s weird and unexpected doesn’t mean he can’t still enjoy it.
“God fucking forbid adults get to have fun too,” Dean snaps, angry at whoever crushed his friend like this. “Normally we drag teammates out for dinner for their birthdays but you didn’t gimme enough warning, so it’s just gonna be me I guess, and before you ask yes Jack can come too.”
There are approximately eight inches of space between them now and Dean’s eyes haven’t left his yet. Cas knows he wouldn’t be able to look away even if he wanted to. He’d like to move closer, but at the very least it would be severely uncomfortable for him even if it didn’t worsen his injuries. The unfairness of the situation strikes him briefly but it’s instantly forgotten because Dean is shifting further into Cas’ space again in tiny increments.
“Great, Cas. Because nothing ever tries to kill either of you anyway just in day-to-day life, right? This is gonna seriously bite you in the ass.”
“Fuck me,” Dean groans on the other end.
“Hello, Gabriel.” Cas receives a one-armed hug from his older brother. “Sam.”
“Are they pork ribs or beef ribs?”
“Well, good. You’re doing me a solid, so I’m glad I can help.”
“Okay, uh, detrimental and-and unnecessary.”
contribution.
And that’s exactly what he wants. It’s hard to think. But he knows he wants it this way. He can go now. A memory loop should start for him, soon. Like ten years ago. This time the loop will be longer. And it will have Cas. Maybe not for real, but he doesn’t care. Even reruns are welcome to him now.
to open Purgatory?”
Dean grins. “Hey, Charlie.”
“I find it absolutely incredible,” his friend tells him, “that despite almost twelve years of me doing everything in my power to prove to the contrary, you
“I didn’t, I inherited it,” he admits. “It hit a hundred and twenty thousand miles and Gabriel essentially decided he wanted a new truck, so he gave me the Tacoma and bought himself a used but newer truck with considerable help from his tax return that year. I pay insurance every six months… which I suppose has lapsed by now.
“Oh. Um. Okay. Cool.”
Dean does not, apparently, have the same issue, because now he steps so that he’s between Cas and Raphael.
“I think what you’re saying…” Cas raises an eyebrow and speaks slowly, cautious and hopeful. “…is that we’re both dumbasses.”
“Heaven is about to shut down and all the souls will come crashing to earth. It can
He doesn’t stay there, though. He does the sandwich and puts it in the fridge, then sneaks back into his own damn bedroom to sit in the chair at the desk and wait for Cas to get up. His angel. Technically not an angel at all anymore, because Jack’s solution to the thing with the Empty was to purge his grace and reimburse him with a soul, but still. He’ll always be an angel to Dean. Also he has no right to look that pretty when he’s sleeping, most people drool and snore and whatever else but Cas is still unreasonably, devastatingly gorgeous.
Dean nods and smiles a little bit, and Cas chooses to believe now that Dean understands just how much “everything” actually is.
Jack high-fives Dean’s good hand and the two of them wander away to some other corner of the weight room. Castiel breathes out in relief while getting back to his exercise routine. Periodically he’ll look over to see how his son is holding up - each time, he’s satisfied that Dean is doing perfectly fine occupying Jack’s focus.
An aggressive stroll through the darkened halls of the bunker may be just what he needs at the moment, either to distract himself from Gabriel’s antics or to provide a type of mobile fodder that stimulates his brain activity (or both, ideally). Two minutes and twenty seven seconds into his walk, he’s distracted by the television in The Dean Cave, which shouldn’t be on at this hour. Jack has clearly fallen asleep in front of it again.
“At the store?”
“That’s irrelevant to the conversation.”
“Whatever. Okay,
“They weren’t doing it before!”
“Mornin’.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean, I hope you’re aware that you don’t owe me,” he blurts out anxiously.
Dean picks up the microfiber towel again and wipes it over his lower back to catch some more slow trickles of wing oil. It hasn’t even been that long but this is getting really god damn old already.
“You’ve done similar things to protect your brother.”
“No, you dumbass,” he chuckles. “You’re being all like. Emotionally gooy and shit.”
“Are you concerned about Bucky being removed from the game?”
do it, kinda. The feathers sparkle and change colors when he does and he has to wonder if Cas’ wings look that gay on purpose or if it’s a coincidence.
“Well that sucks, Cas, but I still ain’t giving you a gun. You’re way more likely to shoot Gabe with it by accident or something. Just - anything happens, you come to me, I’ll keep you safe.”
Dean’s so busy crying and feeling bad for himself that he almost doesn’t hear the quiet
Cas is surprised by the sudden change in subject, but decides not to resist. “In this hospital specifically, sixty six days. Total, it’s been five and a half months since the incident on the overpass. You’ve been here for nine days.”
“Shaddup.”
“Yeah, I remember.”
“That wasn’t a bad shot,”
“Nope.” Dean thinks for a second. “Wait, Future-Cas said there’s other angels chasing him, that might’a been them.”
better fashion sense than this?”
“I know what I saw, Sammy! Big fucking wings! He hugged me with them ’cause I was a kid back then…”
As much as Dean likes Cas, and even taking into account that Cas is the one who convinced him to do this somehow, he wishes Benny was here. They’ve been a unit for six and a half seasons and Dean feels more comfortable in general with his bulkier friend around to back him up. Although… looking at it critically, Dean decides that Cas is far from a bad stand-in. Cas is weirdly lean for a hockey player, but he can beat the absolute shit outta most other players he comes across. The guy’s ferocious and somewhere along the line has decided that Dean’s safety is high on his priorities list.
“Sam.”
“But you have the effort to try to help me on a daily basis.”
Layla’s eyes don’t leave him as he approaches, only closing when he touches his fingertips to her forehead. He disassembles the malignant cells at the molecular bonds first before searching out and correcting every presence of the defective gene that caused this in the first place.
“In case someone tried to steal from me, then I’d have a couple stashed in places that I could get to in a hurry… problem is, I had like ten’a them and I can’t remember all the spots. And the ones I
“Okay, so Cas thinks that actually means something.”
“It could have something to do with your unhappiness, you’re nutrient deficient because you ignore the rest of your food.”
Their teammates skate back to the bench, bumping knuckles on the way by. John sends the second line and second D-pair to center ice.
“All the weird shit I seen as a hunter and you think I’m gonna have a problem with you for that? And for a second can you pretend you don’t think I’m a dumbass and didn’t already know? Me and Sam had a bet going how long you’d stay in denial before you finally gave up and slept with Cas. Too bad I kicked it or I prob’ly would’a won, too.”
“Jerk.”
But Cas never answers.
“Well, um, it means that any medical and psychiatric treatments will be run by her. But hopefully whenever possible they’ll also have to get your consent, too. You’re cognizant and more or less aware of your surroundings, so I’m gonna do my best to make sure you have some say in things going forward. You will probably be able to leave the hospital eventually.”
Dean, the idjit, was insistent - this is important, it’ll stop Crowley from getting more powerful, et cetera. Funny thing about that, though, is that Dean’s being way more hostile and cranky at Cas than Bobby and Sam
“Yeah, well, it ain’t. ’Cause you basically promised me he wouldn’t get free, and then guess what! I was about two seconds from getting my ass hauled back down to the Pit!” he shouts.
Interestingly, Dean grins slightly at that. “Guess so. Here, we’ll do it together.”
Gabriel eyes him, but ultimately shrugs. “Okay. Be prepared for me to blow you away with my answer.”
“Okay, we can get that straightened out for you, though. There are plenty of options available for community support, and because you’re legally disabled your medical insurance will cover a surprising amount of stuff. Besides that there are lots of programs for assistance that you almost definitely qualify for.”
On the other end, Dean coughs a little.
“Are you alright?”
Dean’s not stupid. He knows why that’s happening. The Mark is evil and alive, it’s allergic to righteous beings like angels. He has a hunch that the only “angel” he’d be able to stand next to and not suffer for it would be Lucifer, because that’s where this fucking thing came from in the first place. So there’s too much goodness in his best friend. Sometimes Dean thinks Cas could burn his skin just by touching him, now.
“Yeah, well, nobody’s asking you to,” Dean mutters, then clumsily reaches an arm behind him to scratch his own back. He’s been itchy as hell all day for no reason; scratching doesn’t work that well, and he even tried putting on another shirt but it made no difference. It’s really starting to piss him off but he has no idea what to do about it. “Gabe, are you fucking with me?”
It takes three days for Dean to be back on his feet, and even then he’s all woozy and shit if he stays standing too long or walks around too much. Meanwhile Cas still hasn’t done a damn thing but lie there, totally unconscious. At this point they don’t really have any other choice besides take him to a hospital, which means fake names, fake documents, and a whole rash of fucking excuses for Cas’ condition. He’s clearly not gonna get better on his own and none of them have the skills needed to take care of him.
“Dean is the best human I’ve ever known. He has a radiant soul and a kind heart.” Castiel’s senses prickle - Heaven has felt what he did and will soon investigate. “I must go, now.”
“Good night, Jack.”
Castiel stares at his favorite human and realizes - this is less than forty eight hours from his past self’s betrayal being revealed. If he required oxygen he might’ve gasped sharply in surprise, and he also mentally berates himself for failing to be more precise and choosing a spot that won’t allow him much time to act.
Dean has no idea what to do with that. “For what? Ain’t your fault my dad’s a homophobe.”
Cas reaches up a hand first and gently pushes the blade away. Apparently he knows that Dean won’t actually have the balls to skewer him.
“No.” A wet inward snort. “Go away.”
“But I want you to get better.”
“I know.”
“Neither of you has any room to talk.” Gabriel bites down on his Tootsie pop and speaks around the sugary debris in his mouth. “Cas, I know you had a nice enlightening conversation with the moose last night. So here’s what’s gonna happen.” He snaps his fingers and they’re in the dungeon. “You two idiots can stay here until you get this worked out! Trust me when I say the sexual tension is killing us all and I’m doing everyone a favor.” And he flies off to take care of some other stuff, leaving them locked in there.
“How much do you remember?”
“Distract Dean.”
“Cas?”
to lose to the Buffalo Sabres. Yet, somehow, the Islanders have managed to do that exact thing.
“Dude, get the ribs. The ribs here are
“My flight feathers,” Castiel grumbles. Thankfully the pain is already fading and they’ll have grown back by the end of the week.
Castiel sits because he’s beginning to feel shaky, keeping his gaze fixed on his daughter.
“Okay, let’s stay focused, guys. Gabriel, try not to distract him so much.”
After that, though, Dean’s got shit to take care of. He gets a bedroom put together, which doesn’t mean much actually, just that he sticks the laptop and the packs of underwear and socks in one of the ones that’s not occupied. He kinda… doesn’t want to, though. He kinda wants to buy a second bed and - no, that wouldn’t work, his room isn’t big enough for two adult-size beds. No. Okay. He wants to buy a
“Sure.” He materializes one, tidily wrapped so she can eat it one-handed. “Anyway! No signs of Lucy yet, since I know you’re probably worried about that, and I may have modified the food stock for the refugees to be mildly bottomless.”
He struggles to remember what the rule is for this. “Would you like to talk about it? You can cry too if you want, I won’t tell anybody.”
On Dean’s suggestion, Gabriel does have Sam’s ginormous fucking pile of laundry clean and folded long before Sam gets back to the bunker. He doesn’t actually use the machines or anything, he just mojos it all into tidy and particularly-folded piles that are fresher than they ever would’ve been even when they were brand new. He does still add the hints of detergent-smell to them, because despite Sam’s crusade to do shit like eat mostly vegetables and not be overly-dependant on unnatural chemicals or whatever, the harsher industrial-grade laundry soaps are pretty much a requirement for any hunter who wants their shirts to not have long lasting bloodstains.
Dean groans as he sits up, rubbing his chest. It’s sore even though there’s no hole or scar or anything.
“I heard you praying.”
“I know. I’m sorry.”
Castiel, unaccustomed to being startled, leaps out of the chair and whips his angel blade into his palm before realizing it’s only his older brother seemingly having a revelation.
Dean groans. “Dammit, Crowley, what?”
“I have no excuse for this. I’m sorry, Dean. I wanted to tell you but didn’t and that was wrong of me.”
Cas throws himself out of bed and into the arms of his friend, who takes a second before hugging back. Cas is aware that he’s “clinging,” which is something that’s generally socially unacceptable, but he’s still drained despite his nap and so doesn’t care. He hangs on with his arms as tightly as he can and buries his face in Dean’s shoulder, soaking in the warmth and becoming mildly alarmed by the lack of mass to his friend. Dean is still losing weight.
Their drinks are brought and they both order, and once the waitress is gone Dean forces himself not to get all tense and awkward. This fucking conversation has to fucking happen, apparently, because fucking Castiel speaks fucking ASL and was fucking eavesdropping earlier.
Dean clings to logic, to everything he knows as a hunter, and pulls away from the nagging feeling. “It’s just a spirit, Sam, okay, and it’s not the first one to be able to read people’s minds,” he points out. “Okay lemme guess. You were
“Hello, Dean.”
“Yeah, why not. What’d you have in mind?”
Then Lee grabs him in a headlock and noogies him. “C’mon, you jackass, it ain’t that bad.” Which from Lee Webb is actually a loving compliment. “Plus we set aside part’a the pool, too.”
Dean remembers how to eat food after that, so they’re quiet for a few minutes while he shovels down his stack of waffles and then switches the empty plate out for the full one that Cas hasn’t touched. He can’t really look at Cas right now, though, because Cas is staring in that way Cas always stares that’s getting pulled in three directions between concerned and fond and mesmerized. Dean can’t not feel weird whenever Cas looks at him like that, because he’s almost positive it means his soul is getting ogled.
“You’re welcome.”
“I can explain-”
“This is insane!”
Dean absolutely doesn’t feel self-conscious as he starts stripping. Nope. Not at all. He’s
“You shouldn’a left,” Dean chokes out, refusing to cry no matter how bad he wants to. “Cas, we could’a… we could’a done something else to beat Billie, you didn’t have to just throw yourself away like that-”
“I heard somewhere you ain’t supposed to do that. Let your kids figure it out on their own… course you weren’t a kid anymore when I heard that, but still.”
him being such a pain in the ass!” Sam complains, throwing his hands out to his sides and pulling Bitchface Number Fifteen.
The reasonable calm of the morning is broken for Castiel when Angel Radio suddenly goes berserk. A rash of voices communicating, some frantic, others disgusted. Given that he’s not on the best terms with Heaven, Castiel wishes that he was no longer forced to tune in to these messages despite the warning they often provide. In this case, however, the news is profoundly disturbing.
“Average, I think.”
“Not really. The guy ain’t bleeding, it’s prob’ly legal,” Dean shrugs. “Plus it’s Crowley, he doesn’t usually get away with shit because the refs don’t like him, so if there was something wrong with it they would’a called him on - damn, look at Cas, there! That was awesome.”
“You know what Dean, I don’t understand!” Sam yells. “Why can’t you even consider the possibility?”
“Not at the moment. Thank you, Castiel.”
“I see.”
Castiel wishes Dean was here.
His eyes snap up. “Excuse me?”
“She has agency over me now.”
“We’re going to do some exercises on paper today,” the nurse says, handing small notepads and pencils to everyone. “First, if there’s one thing you could go back and tell your past self, what would it be?”
Dean thinks idly.
“But he’ll live?”
She stares at him. “But I thought - Dean, he, he didn’t really have faith the same way I do…”
Dean explains, finishing up with “…and then I passed out, apparently.
Gabriel pretends to fly back to the bunker, but in truth he only mimics the sound of his wings flapping and makes himself imperceptible.
as many as I would average on a fic in most of my previous fandoms. You guys are the best and I love you all <3
What the hell is he supposed to say to that? He can’t even explain it away anymore that Cas is an angel and doesn’t understand what he’s offering - that works with Gabe because Gabe, despite harassing and killing humans for millennia, doesn’t actually know what makes them tick. But Cas has
Castiel snaps.
and shit.
Cas protests.
“What?”
Cas frowns. “How did you know?”
you had something to do with this!” Sam yells, wiping paint out of his eyes.
“Alright, alright! Relax!” He snaps his fingers and the moose antlers disappear. “You’re no fun!”
“Thank you, Dean.”
It’s Sammy. Of course it’s Sammy.
“Thank you, Dean.”
get used to writing for a fandom that isn't obscure as hell, I never used to get so much attention and it makes me feel spoiled a little bit ^_^
“So, how’s life?”
“How so?”
“Dean, are you okay?” Sam demands, forgetting all about Cas and coming over to him instead.
Fun fact: I almost got murdered in my own apartment about four or five years ago. It didn't happen quite like it does in this fic to Cas, but either way, it's about as enjoyable as it sounds.
Castiel slides into a crevice between two structures as a pair of crossroads demons approach. They haven’t noticed him thanks to the sigils, but if they’d actually seen him he doesn’t think they’d be fooled like the others, given their intermediate level of power. Crossroads demons are something of a gray area when it comes to classification - not weak enough to be lesser demons, but far from strong enough to be considered greater demons either. Fortunately very few greater demons still exist anymore, especially with the destruction of Lilith and Alastair a few years ago. The only ones Castiel can think of off the top of his head are Crowley and Cain, and nobody’s seen Cain for hundreds of years.
(You may also have noticed that this fic has a completed chapter count now - I am wrapping up the writing of the epilogue as we speak.)
of him!”
“Dammit, Dean-”
“You’re gonna be okay,” Dean whispers against the back of his head. “You’re always okay again eventually. You’re gonna be okay.”
“What if something happens while they’re all sleeping?”
since Adam and Eve were removed from the Garden.”
“Oh yeah, why?” Dean shouts over the noise of all the guns firing around them.
For the morning, though, he’s at Wal-Mart, buying the makings of dozens of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches along with windshield washer fluid and fuel injector cleaner for his truck on Dean’s suggestion. Also piled up in the cart: frozen burritos, sour cream, pizza rolls, boxes upon boxes of Capri Sun not-juice pouches, orange juice, breakfast cereal (eaten dry because he doesn’t care for milk), lemon pudding cups.
“Lemme stop you right there. That ain’t even close to what I had in mind.” Dean peels Cas down to bare skin, which is easy when there’s nothing under the dress shirt. He lets go of Cas and pulls off his undershirt, then holds it out after hesitating for a second. “I don’t got any feathers.”
If Castiel were for whatever reason forced to vacate the body of his prospective mate, Dean would be immediately incapacitated and suffer death within twelve hours from multiple organ failure. This compounds the difficulties that the two of them normally face while fighting together, that being Dean’s innate bravery translating to near-suicidal recklessness when engaging in hand-to-hand combat. Castiel isn’t convinced he can protect Dean adequately without the use of his own body.
“I’ll be fine, I only required a sensory break.” He accepts a hug from his brother while Anna tries unsuccessfully to stop Jack from eating the nougat bar a few feet away. “What about you?”
“But he might want the window curtain open,” Cas gasps, shaking in his chair.
“Okay!” Jack flies away.
If he’s honest with himself, Cas doesn’t mind having Dean look after him in any way. According to the tv, many people tend to find such circumstances belittling or humiliating, especially men. But Cas would be happy to be the main object of Dean’s attention until the end of time. He knows it gives Dean a sense of purpose, and it also makes him feel cozy and safe in a way he’s not sure he’s ever experienced until now. (If he has, he doesn’t remember it.)
Trigger warnings:
“ENOUGH” Dean’s sister-in-law says, exaggerating the movement in the equivalent of shouting. “YOU’RE BOTH CHILDREN”
“Great. Fucking
“Okay, she’s all set now.” Castiel looks and Sam is feeding her a bottle of formula - they’d stocked up on baby supplies long before this point. “How’re you feeling, Cas?”
He knew this was happening ahead of time, and for awhile there he considered putting up banishing sigils just in case that damn fool angel decided to try anything… at the end, though, he didn’t. Angel sigils are a funny thing. There’s only about five of them, and by themselves they don’t mean much. It’s mostly about intent and what the sigil gets drawn with. Blood, intent to banish - banishing sigil. Paint, intent to block - the sigil bars entry. They could be the same design but act completely differently based just on intent. Sometimes even the color can change what they do. At least, that’s how Cas explained it.
