Dean had a goal. Make Cas lose control. "Feels so good, Babe. Love you so much. Need it...harder, Babe." Dean's hand moved up and down his cock, now slick with his arousal.
"I've got an extra cot upstairs, and Gabriel has a bed." The archangel grinned at Sam lustfully. Gabriel was just teasing, but Sam paled.
Dean's bark of almost hysterical laughter had all heads turned towards him. Castiel gave him a warning glare. "Sorry, just thought of a private joke," Dean said, still laughing.
Their breathing was erratic and harsh in the quiet of the cabin. Dean was close and by the amount of precum spilling onto Cas' hand, he was almost there too. "Dean...look at me."
Dean flipped him off, but laughed along with him. Benny assured him earlier Bobby had arrived in town and was going to be there. At least part of his family would be present.
"Oil is in the..." He yelped as Dean's teeth came down on his nipple. The answering growl from Dean made him gasp and arch off the ground. Want became a need...a burning need. "Dean, please..."
Dean pulled up the quilts that had gotten pushed down to his waist. "We should probably get some shuteye. I'll need to get back to the hospital in a few hours." Dean thought about the last time he'd had sex...the girl didn't do a whole lot of touching, and the lights were off...Jesus...he ate just like his father did – fast food and greasy diners. If he didn't check himself, he'd be a candidate for fat camp.
"I can't betray my friends, Dean. You're a hunter. I shouldn't have allowed you to come back. It was selfish of me."
John appeared very interested in what Dean was going to say. "Through me," Bobby answered gruffly, leaving no room for argument.
Dean didn't think it was possible for a vampire to look sheepish, but Benny sure as hell did. "I let some kids borrow it for a tire swing down by the river back in August."
Dean pulled back, resting his forehead against Cas', trying to slow his racing heart. "This probably...
Barefoot, Castiel walked over to a small basket he'd prepared in the early morning hours before he'd left to prepare for the ceremony. He brought it back into the circle and knelt on his robe. He reached up his hand and with one more quick look around the meadow, Dean allowed himself to be pulled to his knees.
"You don't like..." Cas looked upset at the thought of cooking something Dean wouldn't like, and Dean was quick to put him at ease.
"We'll just wait it out. Can't last long, right?" Dean said, after moving to the window to look outside.
"I do...I will." Dean was so nervous now, his voice cracked. He wasn't nervous about spending his life with Cas, but that didn't stop the butterflies from finishing their game of football and moving on to an orgy in his belly.
"Four days," Dean screeched. "Son of a bitch." Dean started pacing again, causing the cat to hiss and leap to higher ground. "Cas, we can't...Sam just left. He can't take off work again...and I can't just up and get married without him. He's my brother. And then there's Bobby. I mean, he could probably drive down again...it's only about eight hours, but Sam. No, we'll have to wait until the next waxy moon."
He played his music loud and sang along as he drove steadily up I35. He thought about calling Sam, but after checking his watch, he figured his brother would be in class or doing something else exciting and fun. He didn't have time for Dean or his life on the road. It had been months since he'd seen Sam, and he did miss him.
Castiel didn't respond. He couldn't. Dean was feeling like a prisoner here. Despite what the Goddess said, Dean didn't believe in fate.
Outside? What the fuck? "Uhm, Cas...it's fuckin' freezing out there." The idea of pulling out his dick to take a piss in the below zero temperatures wasn't a pleasant one.
"I don't think we've been formally introduced." Missouri strode right over to the bed and held out her hand. Dean stared at it for a second before shaking it. "Missouri Moseley and you are Dean Winchester."
Cas cupped his hands on Dean's flannel covered ass, and Dean hissed. Eyes tightly closed, Dean let his other senses take over. The smell of cinnamon and nutmeg that was Cas...the crackling of the fire...the heat their bodies was generating. Cas' hand was on his belly now, trailing down to the waistband of his pants. It had been too long since someone had touched him like this. Like Dean was really wanted. If only things were different...if only his father...fuck...
"Keep him warm, Pierce," Castiel told the cat before standing. He must sleep. He'd used more magick than usual that day, and he felt drained. He quickly cleaned up the remnants from their dinner, and then opened the chest at the end of the bed. He pulled out another quilt and made himself a pallet on the floor.
"Sammy, no. You don't need to come here." Dean pinched the bridge of his nose. How had this whole thing gotten so out of hand. If it hadn't been for his father sending him off on a wild goose chase for a wendigo, Dean would be happily driving around the country, hunting monsters...but noooooo.
"I am a Hedge Witch. I use what the earth has provided for us to heal...to do...good. I inherited my powers and my love of the earth from my grandmother. Mother, Lucifer, and the coven prefer the darker arts."
"I'm sorry, Dean," Cas said, turning to lay on his side, facing Dean. Cas put his palm flat on Dean's chest and suddenly, the t-shirt Dean was wearing felt too constricting. Sex and alcohol were Dean's coping mechanisms. Cas didn't have any alcohol, but he damn sure wanted sex with the sexy witch. Dean rolled over, pinning Cas on his back. Blue eyes stared up at him, filled with warmth. Dean let his eyes close, and he lowered his mouth to Cas'. As kisses went, it was pretty tame, but Dean's hand went straight to Cas' dick. He palmed it through the thin cotton of Cas' pajama pants. He was so intent on getting Cas hard, it took him a second or two to realize Cas wasn't kissing him back. He raised his head and gazed at the man. His eyes were bright, and his lips were wet with their combined spit. "Dean."
"Shut up...this ladle thing doesn't pour right." All he got from that lame excuse was a raised eyebrow. When Cas moved off to set the table, Dean was able to breathe again.
Cas lifted Dean's legs and settled them over his shoulders. He gripped Dean's hips and pushed his knees under Dean's ass to steady him. With one hand rubbing Dean's stomach, Cas used the other to line up his cock. The intrusion made Dean gasp. His eyes flew open from the lazy halfmast they were previously. Cas eyes were watching him intently and Dean answered the unspoken question with a nod. Dean felt every inch of Cas' cock sink into him. He was riding the line between pain and pleasure. One second, he wanted to scream for Cas to stop, but the next, he needed to ask for more.
"We will be skyclad with our robes for coverage. And no, the ceremony is not like a Christian wedding, there will be no fancy cake, no presents, and no throwing bouquets of flowers."
"Are you forcing him to stay?" Dean took a step forward, but the woman turned towards him, and he froze.
"No need." The other man's words stopped him, and he glanced back. "Sheriff'll be in here...right about...now."
"Come on, let's grab this load and get inside. It's too fuckin' cold out here." Dean stomped his feet. "The air hurts my face, Cas. Why do you live somewhere where the air hurts your face?"
He felt her power inside of him, running through his veins. When the dizziness overcame him, he wasn't prepared, and he stumbled. Then he was seeing the forest rush by...felt the cold snow on the pads of his feet...the smell of the trees and the earth were intensified. It was overwhelming. He could smell Dean...his mate. The outline of the sedan could be seen ahead, idling in the middle of the road. Castiel stopped in the beams of the headlights. He saw Dean through the windshield, and then he turned to look down the road that lead out of town, sending a silent communication to Dean.
"Dean, if something was wrong with the Impala, you'd find the nearest mechanic. Bobby is like...what...nine hours away," Sam said with an eye roll.
Okay, Dean wasn't into chit chats with vampires; and this case was solved, so he stood up. "Thanks for the info."
With a huff of displeasure, Dean upended the cup, held his breath, and gulped it down as quickly as he could. He tried hard not to gag; as, he thrust the mug at Castiel.
Dean, will you share in Castiel’s burdens so that your spirits may grow in this union?" Dean responded and another wrap was made with the ribbon. Mab finished the ceremony, with both men pledging to share each other's dreams, to use their anger to temper the strength of their marriage, to honor each other as equals. With each pledge, another wrap was made.
Dean dialed Sam first. "Sam, something weird is going on here, and I can't make it out there to get Dad out of jail."
Cas turned his head to glance back at him. "Eyes on the road, dude." Dean hated motorcycles. He wasn't afraid to ride on one, it was just a poor form of transportation. He closed his eyes tightly when Cas turned the corner and headed down a bumpy road. He tried to think of something else besides dying in a fiery crash on the side of a road with a hunk of metal between his legs. That thought brought him back to reality. Cas was between his legs...well, his thighs. Damn this love spell.
"Come down here and call me that, Asshole." No...no...no...too late. Gabriel appeared in front of Dean, knocking him back on his butt.
“Why are you so upset, Dean? You’ve been praying on and off and seemed very agitated for the last hour. Has something happened? Are you alright,” Castiel stepped closer to Dean slowly. He was worried about his hunter.
Sam and Castiel dropped Dean off at the motel room before heading back to the library. He’d done his part, interviewed the victims and gotten what information he could from local PD. Leave it to those two nerds to do the research work.
The wolf fell into step beside him. Once he crossed the old railroad tracks, his friend stopped. Castiel nodded, and she ran back in the other direction. She would not get close to people, it was her way. Castiel kept walking. He heard a baby crying in the distance. He smiled. New life was always a blessing.
Dean didn't have to be told twice. He struggled through the snow that was now about two feet deep. He could see Cas' shape in front of him, and he held tightly to the cord. It had to be twenty below out here. Cas abruptly stopped. Dean ran smack into him, knocking him off balance. They both landed with an oomph. "Sorry," Dean mumbled into Cas' ear, which was right next to his mouth.
"Not making this easy, Cas...Jeez. I said I love you and I meant it. I've never said that to anyone before...except for Sam. Maybe mom, but she died so long ago." He was rambling. "I didn't think I was allowed to want...this." He waved his arms around to encompass the cabin. "You...a home...an apple pie kind of life. But I do, Cas. I do want it."
Dean made himself comfortable on the other bed and watched Jeopardy and the Wheel of Fortune, because he didn't want to risk asking his father to change the channel. John made Dean call for pizza, and they ate in silence. At least his father wasn't drinking anymore. Going to hunt a buru buru with a drunk man as your only backup was suicide.
The doctor fiddled with his stethoscope before meeting Sam's eyes, and Dean knew it was going to be bad news. "Your father's blood pressure was incredibly high and from the damage done, I'm assuming it's been going on for some time now. The CT scan showed major blockage in his arteries surrounding the heart, and his cholesterol was through the roof. All that being said, he will more than likely need long term nursing care." Dean hung his head, covering his face with his hands. The words 'long term' seemed to echo in the room.
"Don't be a dumbass." Castiel quirked up an eyebrow and waited for it to register. He didn't have long to wait. Dean turned his head to face him, eyes narrowed.
Gabriel's eyebrow rose a fraction, but he grabbed the bottle of Stolichnaya he kept for Castiel and the Leshiy who lived a bit deeper in the woods. Vladimir played a big part in keeping away strangers. Leshiys were known for confusing travelers.
Dean stepped into the outhouse and shut the door behind him. Castiel leaned against it after tying the cord to a metal hook on the side wall. He was hoping this storm would taper off before morning, but just in case, the line would keep Dean from getting lost.
"Silvermist, Fawn, this is Dean. He is a hunter, but means us no harm," Castiel said as an introduction. Fawn, much younger than her brother, hung back, but the male fairy flitted closer. His curled, black horns glimmered under the fluorescent lights of the store.
Sam held out his hand, and Castiel watched his face. With no heartbeat, Benny's skin was always cold to the touch. The undead didn't produce body heat. Sam's eyes flickered to Dean, and Dean smiled. "Yeah, he's a vamp; but I trust him, Sam, and so does Bobby." Sam seemed to take it at face value, and he nodded to Benny as they released hands.
Sure, he wanted this, but how did he ask for it. Seeing the intense pleasure Cas got from being fucked...and well, it was his wedding day. Since humor was the way he dealt with tense situations, he gazed down at Cas and said, "Since I'm the bride..." Cas sat up and pulled him into his arms. Then he ran his hand over Dean's face.
Dean stood abruptly and grabbed his coat off the hook. The sound of the door slamming echoed in the room.
"We're okay," Dean started, but the doctor's look stopped his argument. They followed the doctor through the emergency room, and Dean barely registered the bustling staff and patients around him. His father wasn't dead, but he wasn't ever going to hunt again. His dad wasn't Ward Cleaver, but fuck, he was the man who taught him everything he knew...how to fight, how to shoot any type of gun, how to run a credit card scam, how to hustle pool.
"Do you really want to know your future, Castiel?" Lilura asked, her face serious. Circe was watching him too, awaiting his answer.
To cast the shadows from their lives, Castiel led the group in a tight circle counterclockwise. Around and around, faster and faster, until he felt peace settle over everyone within his protection. Back at his altar, he lit a white candle. "From death to the old ways comes life anew. I light the candle of peace, harmony, and love that it may always shine in our hearts."
"Another, Dean." Cas' voice cracked. Dean added one more finger and damn, if it wasn't hot seeing Cas' hole stretched wide...slick...just waiting for Dean's cock. The way the muscle sucked them in, the drag of those soft walls...had Dean's heart beating overtime. "Dean, I'm ready." Cas' words startled Dean out of the trance he'd found himself in.
Cas nodded, but pushed the amulet back towards Dean. "Please keep this one. It will keep you safe, and that's all I want for you." If it really kept Dean from being killed by the Arachne, then Dean should keep it. But he wasn't sure. He had to think and sitting across from Cas made that almost impossible.
"Dad, we're in Bumfuck, Egypt here. There is no cell reception. I was passing through and my baby died. Some creepy guy in there..." Dean points his thumb at the bar. "...let me use his phone. I wasn't sure where you were, so I called Bobby...Sam was on his way to pay Bobby a visit, and he rode along." Dean's eyes shifted to the rental car hoping his father wouldn't ask about it.
"What fun is a wedding if there isn't going to be cake...wait...skyclad...isn't that... Oh, hell no. I'm not getting married while I'm naked. Nope. Not happening, Cas."
"But Castiel..." Castiel held up his hand, shaking his head adamantly. Gabriel sighed heavily and slunk off to polish glasses.
Then the Twilight Zone came to town. The bar owner popped in and out like a fuckin' jack-in-the-box. And he couldn't forget about Kate. Kate, the werewolf, who was just a cute college kid in the wrong place at the wrong time. She'd promised to go away and not cause any harm. Now, she's strolling through the streets of Lafitte like a freakin' local. Maybe because she was. It was like one little happy monster mash. Dean chucked at his joke.
"My magick hides us from those seeking the town. Lafitte doesn't appear on maps, but we have to leave it open for mail, supplies, and family that visits. The hunters, if they know where to look, can enter..." Grumbling rose in volume. Castiel talked louder. "...but I will know when they are close. Missouri will sense them, as well."
Castiel began to laugh. They were out in a blizzard talking about masturbation. Dean brought his gaze back to Castiel's and shook his head, but he was grinning. "You're fuckin' crazy, man."
Dean put his backpack on the bed and waiting until Cas' back was turned, he packed the pouch of colored stones. He removed Cas' warm woolen socks and laid them on the bed. After one more look around the small cabin, he cleared his throat. "I'm ready."
"Crystals. I picked those that would help you regain your strength. I'm going to fix you something to eat now." Dean watched his ass as he walked over to the kitchen area. He remembered how it flexed in the moonlight. Fuck, he really needed to stop thinking about the witch and sex at the same time.
"You and Sam have your own lives to lead. Your daddy's hunting days are over. Unless you plan on buying a house and hiring a full time nurse any time soon, you've got to think of what you're going to do."
"Different kinks for different folks, Cas. Some people get off on the whole beat me, whip me, make me write bad checks scene. But if you want to see some real porn, you'll have to get the internet out here."
And Dean thought he had a dysfunctional family. At least he hadn't been disowned...yet. "Do they know where you are?"
“I was, uh, I just got out of the shower and was getting dressed. Aren’t you supposed to be at the library with Sam,” Dean asked.
"The right thing to do?" Castiel said incredulously, his voice raised in anger. "It was Dean's father."
The fairy's lip curled in a sneer. "What a shame." His eyes raked over Dean once more before returning to his sister's side. Benny held out a brown paper bag to them and after passing Benny a few stones, the fairies zipped out the door.
"Let me think," Benny said, stopping the car in the middle of the road. Dean turned around and gave Sam the abridged version of the Goddess' plan to keep him hostage. Dean's head was reeling. His father was possibly dying and there was no way for Dean to get to him. He was about to get out of the car and tell Benny to leave him behind. To just make sure Sam got to the hospital, when Chara ran out of the woods and stood in the middle of the road. She faced the car, her eyes locking with Dean's. They were so blue, just like Castiel's. She blinked, then turned her head to look down the road, and then she trotted back into the trees.
There was a shuffling sound on the porch, and then the door opened. The cat strutted inside and walked straight to the fireplace with her tail in the air. Castiel followed, dressed in a black, floor length robe with a hood. Dean could make out the sharp jut of his hip, but the rest of his body was in shadows.
Castiel saw it happen in slow motion and knew he couldn't stop it. Dean's arm hit the edge of the table, knocking Castiel's beer, causing it to slosh over the rim. Both Castiel and Dean reached for it at the same time, and their hands collided, sending the beer splashing over Castiel's shirt. His first reaction was to jump up and pull the now cold material away from his skin. Dean's first instinct was to try to help. What he was thinking, Castiel couldn't begin to understand. Castiel's amulet swung into view.
"Olive oil, coconut oil, aloe vera, water from a deep spring, a hint of vitamin E, and ylang ylang essential oil."
"All I see is you using your power to manipulate people. Is this a game to you? Dicking around with Cas' feelings...does it make you feel superior?" He realized he was still on his ass and stood again, dusting off the seat of his jeans.
“Well this,” again Dean grabbed the soft bit of flesh below his belly button, “wasn’t there then, was it?”
Now that it was just the two of them, Castiel pinched the bridge of his nose. "Dean, I know you have no reason to trust me, but I need you to listen to me."
"Wait...you allowed me to come back..." Dean's mind was going a mile a minute. "...you did something to make it disappear on maps, didn't you?"
"Your daddy is a hard man, Dean. Over the years, he's gotten more and more...mean. It's the life he led. Town to town, risking his life with no appreciation from anyone...no one to love him...no one to love. I don't want that to happen to you." Bobby paused again and when the seconds turned to minutes, Dean finally looked up at him.
Circe stared down at her fingernails, trying to look bored. "He's safe. His dick is probably cold anyway."
"Yes, I really love him." She smiled. "Hey, what did your sister see...or feel...when she touched me?"
"No, but it is what you meant. You have doubts about your worthiness." Dean's lips formed a thin line, and his eyes narrowed. Could she read his mind?
"Dean, something's bothering you. If it's the love spell thing, don't worry about it. Just track her down and kill her."
"Damn truck blew a tire. Gabriel did his thing and zapped us back here," Benny informed Castiel. The witch looked from his friend then over to Dean.
"Ingredients? What kind of ingredients?" Dean was expecting eye of newt or wings of bat, or some shit like that. He was surprised when the man walked to a bookcase that held hundreds of glass jars of various sizes.
Dean needed comfort, not sex. As much as he wanted Dean, he didn't want it to be something Dean would regret when he woke up. He didn't want their first time to be tainted with images of John Winchester in a hospital bed.
"She never brings me anything, and I provide her with tuna," Benny muttered, a smile still gracing his lips. "She must love you, Dean."
Dean glanced down at it and used his thumb and forefinger to rip the tape off. He winced as the adhesive caught and pulled out the hair on his arm. Castiel ran his thumb over the five neatly sewn stitches. "After our bath, I will put some healing balm on it."
“No need to be afraid. Chara would never harm a guest in my home.” The man’s voice was deep, whiskey, laced with a good cigar. Sexy voice or not, Dean wasn’t going to trust the man or his wolf. He took the edge of the heavy blankets and was going to throw them off so he could stand, but he came to the instant realization that he was naked.
The vampire was one cocky son of a bitch. His ploy to get Dean to leave Cas' was so transparent. Once the door shut behind Cas, Benny went to the window and waited. Dean knew he was waiting until Cas was out of earshot. Dean took the time to look around Cas' cabin. He had no weapon against a vamp. If the guy attacked, Dean would lose.
Seemingly satisfied with Dean's words, Cas' hands moved over Dean's back. "And you are still wearing too many clothes. He reached for the hem of the t-shirt, and Dean held his breath, as Cas pulled it up his back and over Dean's head, throwing it to the floor. It wasn't completely dark, but hopefully dark enough. Cas surprised him by flipping him and pressing him into the mattress. Cas kissed his lips softly and then moved his mouth down his throat. When Cas' mouth reached one of his nipples, he arched his back and gasped. Damn, that felt so good. He gripped the back of Cas' head, holding him there. Cas was content to suck and nip at the sensitive bud, before moving to the next one. It was only when Cas moved further down, that Dean tensed. Cas looked up at him, and Dean could see the firelight reflected in Cas' eyes. "I love you, Dean. Every part of you."
"Cas can go with us..." Dean said, then his eyebrows came together. "Wait, what happened to Gordon's...uhm...body?"
Dean was presumably talking to Sam now. His back was to them, so Castiel couldn't hear what was being said. From his posture, Castiel could see that Dean was becoming agitated, and he pulled Benny outside to give the hunter more privacy.
Bound and determined to make the witch have a conversation with him, Dean persisted. "What kind of meat is this?"
“Cas it’s just, it’s not because I’m, I mean…” Dean didn’t have a clue how to explain this to Castiel without divulging more about his thoughts than he intended. Some things Dean Winchester firmly intended to remain in his head where they belonged.
"The hunter thinks Castiel gave him a love potion," Benny said from the doorway behind Castiel. Castiel looked heavenward. His friends had heard the whole thing.
Cas crawled onto the bed, hooking his fingers into Dean's underwear, as he moved up Dean's legs. Dean lifted his ass to help. He might hate his flabby belly, but he was proud of his cock. It was longer than Cas', but Cas' was thicker...and uncut. How had he not noticed that? Cas caught him comparing and gave him an amused look. "Yes, Dean, yours is bigger."
While the cabin was quiet, Castiel sat at his table and went to work on his balm. Benny supplied the jars and labels for the beauty product. There was nothing magical about it, but the combination of herbs, oils, and honey was a natural anti-aging mixture. Benny kept Castiel's earnings in his safe, but mostly it was traded for supplies. He looked up and grinned. Pierce was sitting on one of the boxes. She knew it held her treat. She was a hunter, mice and other small creatures kept her well fed, but Benny loved giving her tuna. He spoiled Castiel's cat.
No -- How are you, son? -- No nothing. Dean didn't expect any different. "The case was a bust. Just accidents. I'm heading out now. Where are you? Still in Tennessee?"
Dean didn't see anything wrong with what he said, but by the looks he got from everyone, it must have been bad. Cas was banging shit in the sink. Sam was giving him one of his classic bitchfaces. Benny...well, Dean swore he saw the vamp's fangs appear for a second. But Bobby...hell, Bobby snatched him by the collar of his shirt and dragged him outside. Bobby might have still be wearing his coat, but Dean wasn't given a chance to grab his.
"Fine," Dean snapped. He held his finger out to Maeva. She pulled a large pin from the hem of her skirt and took Dean's hand. She ignored the forefinger he held out and jabbed the pin into Dean's ring finger. He yelped, but didn't pull away. She let the drop of blood drip into her palm. All the aunts leaned in. Dean gave Cas a quizzical look and he smiled, hoping to ease Dean's frustration.
Dean shoved his hands in his coat pockets and strode ahead of him. Castiel didn't want Dean to be mad at him, not before he left for good. He sighed, exhaled sharply, and said, "Ruby is a gypsy. Her and her family moved here a couple of years ago."
"Yeah, whatever." The hot water and the light scent of roses drifting up with the steam were making Dean drowsy. He was shivering again though. Castiel turned with a crude ceramic mug in his hand. He parked his hip on the side of the tub and held it out to Dean.
Dean pulled his cell phone out of his pocket, and Castiel almost laughed. He squinted at it and mumbled something under his breath. He moved around the cabin, holding his phone out while Castiel leaned against the fireplace and watched. When he made to open the door, Castiel stopped him. "Dean, cell service out here is sketchy at best. In weather like this, it is impossible."
"I wouldn't test him," the woman said dryly before thanking Benny and taking her bag out the front door.
They cleaned the kitchen, and Castiel began running the water in the quartz tub. The tub had been a gift from Aunt Mab the last time the sisters visited. Dean came to stand by him as it filled. "Taking a bath, huh?"
"I'm going to add some honey. It will help with the taste, but it, also, has healing properties. It came from my own hives."
Castiel never thought about his uncircumcised penis in great detail. It was the way he was born, and he never had any complaints from his lovers. Dean looked so unsettled, and it made Castiel uneasy. For a moment, he allowed his mind to wander. He supposed he could get it taken care of. He was sure Arif could do it, after all, he had some medical knowledge. How long would it take to heal...and that was as far as he got on that line of thought. Dean cupped his balls, and Castiel moaned. It felt so wonderful...so good. Castiel looked down at the man he loved, on his knees before him. Dean was so beautiful.
"Gabriel?" He looked up at Castiel. "Okay, be right there." He pocketed his phone and stood up. "He's not gone. He's next door."
"He's in the back. Let me get a nurse." She stood up and walked through a set of doors. Dean rubbed the back of his neck, trying to ease the tense muscles. He looked over at Sam. They hadn't had a chance to talk and now their father was in a hospital, probably fighting for his life.
His dreams were dark. Sam and his father...yelling...fists... "No, Dad, please..." He'd take the blame for anything Sam did. He was stronger...older...he'd take the beatings. A belt raised high, coming down...not on him, but Sam...not Sam. "No," he screamed over and over. The bastard... "Sam...Sam...Noooooo."
"Can he really do that...the whole turning people into toads thing?" Dean asked, curious and unimpressed by the woman. She looked vaguely familiar, and Dean figured he'd seen her at the town meeting.
Pierce blinked and licked her paw, looking every inch the bored kitty. Dean stuck out his tongue at her. He flopped down on the bed, staring at the ceiling. It was his fuckin' wedding day and here he was by himself.
She swatted his shoulder. "You are a bad boy." She had a definite spring in her step as she walked away, and that made Dean smile.
Once Dean was around the corner, he hit the steering wheel with his fist. He was glad his father was heading to New York after a possible Vetala. He was heading to South Dakota to meet with Bobby about a couple of strange deaths near Mount Rushmore. Hunting with his father was getting harder and he wanted to avoid it as best he could. Hands still shaking with suppressed anger, Dean touched the amulet and thought of Cas. He felt calmer by the time he hit Dallas.
"We can make it work, Cas." It was time to bring out the big guns. Dean stepped closer and took Cas' hands in his. "Please, Cas, give me a chance." He pulled the puppy dog eyes out of his arsenal.
"I believe in fate," Cas said so matter-of-factly, Dean almost believed in it himself. "Tomorrow Sam and Bobby come. Your father could be anywhere. Now is not the time to speak of what is between us."
Opening his eyes, Dean saw the creature again, standing over him. He moaned and tried to get away, but he was so weak and so very tired. Did one dream in heaven…or hell? Dean saw himself walking down the halls of a hospital corridor. A doctor in cowboy boots smiled at him. It must be heaven because Dr. Sexy was there.
He left the store and entered Gabriel's bar. Benny was sitting at the bar talking to the fallen archangel who'd taken refuge in Lafitte a few years before Castiel. Both looked up at him.
"Thank you so much, Ranger. I do love a man in uniform." Dean felt the hair on the back of his neck rise. Yep, he was getting a bad vibe.
Castiel felt the glide of Dean's teeth on his neck and let his head fall back. "Don't get..." Kiss, lick, nip. "...why Christians don't..." Nip, kiss, lick. "...do it this way...much more fun." Dean's fingers pinched at his nipples and he felt his cock thicken between his legs. His own hands moved over Dean's broad shoulders and down his strong biceps. "Love you, Cas. Love your body...want you." Dean's words were breathed into his skin, causing his skin to raise in tiny chill bumps. "Cold?" Dean asked, pulling back to look at him.
"I have to find the answer, Dean. Stay here." And he was on the move again, this time heading into the forest.
"Good morning, Dean," Castiel whispered. Dean untangled himself and tilted his head until his neck popped.
"It is an amulet for safe travels. If you don't want to wear it, at least leave it in your car." Dean stared down at the tiny bag. Black with small crystals hanging off it and a charm of some sort. A pentagram with silver feathers. "It is filled with herbs and stones to ward off danger."
Without showing fear, Dean stepped up toe to toe. "So much for being all peaceful. Is that a ruse to stay around here and feed on other creatures. Bet witch blood tastes real good, huh?" Dean taunted.
It took them another two hours to drag the body and the head deeper into the woods, dig a hole, and burn the creature. All Dean wanted after that was a hot shower and a clean bed.
"Uh huh, well, just give me my clothes and I'll take my guns and get out of your hair." Once again, Dean tried to put weight on his legs and once again, he sank back down. "What did you do to me?"
"I figured as much. Your power is stronger then." She waited until he removed his coat before handing him his tea. He sat and took a sip. "Are you going to tell me about him?"
Castiel crawled to the side of the bed and lifted a wooden box. Inside, among a few trinkets and crystals, was a jar. He handed it to Dean. Dean accepted it, but raised an eyebrow.
"He's going to leave you. He's got to leave here. If he finds out about the rest of the town, he'll bring more hunters."
Sleepy, Dean sat the book down next to him and got comfortable. Cas' cat snuggled under his armpit and Dean was going to shoo her away, but the damn thing started purring and eventually, it lulled him to sleep.
All he got for his words was a raised eyebrow. "I can assure you, my nightmares are a lot worse than you could even imagine." He sighed heavily. "Dean, I mean you no harm. I know you probably won't believe me, and I don't know how to prove it to you." He shrugged.
"Stay put. I’m going to make you breakfast." Castiel watched as Dean got up and found his boxers on the floor. "Where would I find them?"
What would it mean? It's not like Dean could stay with Cas. He was a hunter. He hunted. That's what he did, and it meant lots of traveling. Dean Winchester didn't stay in one place. And why was Dean even giving this a thought. Sure, he liked Cas. And he'd deny it to anyone that asked, but he would love to get into Cas' bed. But true mates? What the hell did that even mean?
"Good to know," Cas said roughly. He made short work of the other boot and sock, taking his time to kiss that foot too. He stood up and gripped the waistband of Dean's jeans and pulled them off, tossing them aside easily. That left Dean in his boxer briefs and his t-shirt. Dean crab-walked backwards on the bed to give Cas room. Dean loved how Cas was so at home in his body. He'd been like that back in his twenties, before fast food and his age caught up with him.
When the town's residents left, it was close to three in the morning. The toll of the day weighed heavy on Castiel, and he needed to draw comfort from the elements. "Dean," Dean was talking to Sam in hushed tones when Castiel interrupted. "I need to go home."
"Yes," Castiel answered. "He knows what I am and what Benny is." Kate whipped her head around to Benny.
"Dad...Cas is..." Castiel caught Dean's attention and shook his head. "We're going to get you some help, Dad."
"Goddess of the moon, I come to you to bring you my love and my devotion. May you grant me the joy of your presence."
"Goddess of all, the fertility of the earth is a sign of your fertility from whence all life rose. The solidity and permanence are still of it and are still less than yours. The Earth's fertility feeds our bodies, and your fertility feeds our souls."
Castiel debated telling Dean the truth, but thought better of it. "I'm sure they've got it taken care of." He was saved from further questions, by Mab.
"Dad...Gabriel...stop," Dean called out, struggling to his feet. Gabriel, eyes glowing blue, lowered the man, but kept his hand on John's neck. The only sound was the ragged breathing of the men. John's eyes were wild.
"No...no...oh, Dean." Castiel couldn't take his eyes off the sight. Dean wrapped his fist around where they were joined and moved his hand back and forth, as if he were masturbating. With their arousal lubricating the juncture, it was slick and smooth. Dean moved his hand faster in a steady rhythm, and Castiel realized he had been holding his breath. It came out as a gasp and then he was panting...whimpering. Dean glanced up at his face, and Castiel finally understood the meaning of the word rapture. It was there in Dean's face.
"I've got to call Sam. Dad is giving him shit about something." Dean rubbed his tired eyes and looked around the cabin blankly.
Sharing breakfast was intimate. Something he'd never done with previous lovers. Even with Cassie, she'd always left after sex, because she lived with her parents. Being domestic wasn't something Dean had ever gotten to do before. Sharing a home with someone was always a pipedream. The apple pie life he wanted for Sam, but never thought he could have. Oh, no, he still couldn't have it, but for a while, he could pretend this could always be his. Cas wouldn't settle for him being on the road. Cas deserved a man who was always around.
Dean hung up and hurried next door. When he walked in, there were several people...creatures...sitting at the bar and at tables. All conversation stopped and all eyes were on him.
Castiel flung pinches of thyme, yarrow, and cinnamon onto the now charred letter. Taking the bowl, he once again climbed the ladder and opened the small window. Calling to the wind, he flung the ashes and herbs into the breeze. He watched the particles dance and then disappear.
"No. I want to watch you touch yourself. See what makes you feel good. I want to see what you look like when you come." Dean couldn't look away from those brilliant blue eyes. He blinked back the dampness that threatened to spill over.
"What the fuck...who knew they had huge freakin' dicks." Castiel tried to hide his smile, but Benny laughed outright.
Several minutes passed and Castiel never took his eyes off the man. He snapped himself out of his daze and wrapped the hot stones in the towels. He place one between Dean's feet and the other two under his arms. He sat on the edge of the bed, and touched Dean's face with his fingertips. "He's stubborn, Pierce. He will be fine."
Benny met Castiel's eyes for an instant. "A hunter. Castiel helped him when he fell through the ice. Once Castiel puts another protection spell in place, we won't see his kind again."
"Will he make you go with him?" Dean thought for a moment. Cas made it seem like Dean was a kid asking permission...but then, his dad always made him feel like a dumb kid.
Castiel's mind went back in time. Dean always covered his stomach, turned his back, made sure he was dressed completely before coming out from behind the curtain. Dean was self-conscious about his soft stomach. Of all the stupid...Castiel felt angry, but knew showing Dean anger wasn't going to help the situation.
"What kind of bigger fish?" Dean asked, his stomach knotting. His father wasn't going to go away and leave him alone.
Pierce sat on the mantel looking down at him with her green eyes as if to scold him for letting his mind wander from the task at hand. He looked at the row of unfilled jars. Benny needed a dozen for a special mail order. So far, he had none. His friend wouldn’t complain if Castiel didn’t have his orders filled, but he would give Castiel a pitying look. Benny assumed, because Castiel lived in a small cabin miles from town…alone…with just Pierce and the wolf for company, that he was lonesome. Truth be told, most of the time, he wasn’t.
"Please." Castiel saw when realization flashed in Benny's eyes. His fangs retracted just as quickly as they had appeared. Castiel never wanted to hurt Benny, but the vampire saw Castiel's feelings written all over his face.
"You can't really live when you are asking 'what if', Dean. What if the sun doesn't rise tomorrow? What if the world stops revolving? What if..." Cas stood up and came over to him. He reached up and cupped his hand on Dean's jaw. Dean couldn't help it, he leaned into the touch. "...nothing bad ever happened and we grew old together?"
"Gordon suspects this town exists, and he's talked your daddy into believing it. You being here is going to cause problems."
Dean got it, and it pissed him off. He yanked away from Bobby and took a step back. "A chance at what, Bobby? A chance at fucking up Cas' life? I'm not the settling down kind of guy. I hunt, Bobby. That's what I do, and that's all I know. Cas deserves someone to stay around...someone who is happy to live here...someone like Benny." Nausea rolled over Dean like a tidal wave. The thought of Benny and Cas together...no, he wasn't going to think about it. He couldn't think about it.
"Yes." Dean frowned at his answer, and Castiel knew the hunter wanted more information. He knew in his heart he could trust Dean, but he'd be breaking the confidence of his friends.
He couldn't help it, he laughed so hard he snorted a few times. It was the kind of bent over, slap your knees laughter. Benny tried to look pissed off, but soon he was chuckling softly. For a moment, Dean forgot his father...forgot Benny was a vampire...and just enjoyed the humor in the situation.
Dean tried to explain his reaction to what he saw. Seeing Benny touch Cas intimately made him see red. You didn't look at someone like that...didn't touch someone like that unless you'd fucked them. But why? Why was he pissed? He wasn't jealous. He barely knew the witch. No, it wasn't jealousy. Maybe it was because Cas was so good and that fuckin' vampire was...was a vampire...plain and simple.
Cas pulled the curtain around the tub and then rummaged in his old dresser. "I'm going to take a bath. You are welcome to read..." Cas pointed to his grimoire still on the bed where Dean left it. "...or whatever."
"You need sustenance." Castiel went to his small kitchen area. He tossed a few logs into his wood burning stove and checked his pantry. He had potatoes, beets, and carrots. With some of the beef he bartered from Benny, he could start a pot of stew. While he made the meal, he glanced over at his houseguest. Dean was asleep.
"He's just a human, but he has something..." Circe said, tapping her finger on her chin. "...I'm not sure what it is, but his heart is strong." Castiel knew she wasn't talking about the beating organ in Dean's chest.
"I'm not at liberty to say, Dean. I've already put them in danger by giving you the means to find us again," Cas said, poking at the amulet.
"You're correct, Dean, it is none of your business," Cas snapped. Dean clamped his lips together and trudged along behind the witch. From this vantage point, Dean got to observe Cas. His hair was the darkest of browns, and it curled a bit at his nape. A few flakes of snow from the trees caught in the strands. His shoulders were hunched forwards against the cold and his legs...his legs were muscular and Dean envisioned them wrapped around him. Despite the cold, Dean's blood suddenly ran hot.
Dean shrugged. "I've been a hunter most of my life, Cas. Kids were never an option. Look at what kind of father I had...no home unless you count endless motel rooms...there was no sitting around a Christmas tree and opening presents...we were lucky if we got a hot meal. I never wanted to bring a child into my world." Dean put his hands on Castiel's hips and pulled him between his legs. His face was belly level and he looked up at Castiel. "I'm okay with not having kids, Cas."
"Benny, you got a place for Sam and Bobby to sleep?" Dean asked. Castiel's hope rose. Dean didn't ask Benny for a bed for himself.
"Everything is fine, Benny. Thank you." Castiel took the cloth bag from Benny and set it on the table. He looked back and forth between Dean and Benny. They were both wearing identical hostile expressions. "Benny, do you need to feed?" Castiel whispered. They were interrupted yesterday, so Castiel needed to offer.
Maeva and Zoraida were sitting at the table, still discussing the wedding robes. Castiel's had been brought with them, but Dean's was causing some issues among the aunts.
Mab began unwrapping the ribbon without untying the knot. Dean watched in amused disbelief. She pressed the knotted ribbon into Dean's hands. Castiel knew by doing so, she was giving Dean a great honor. "Please turn and face your family...your friends." To those gathered, her voice rose to be heard by everyone. "They are bound."
When Dean got back to the motel with Bobby, he stripped off his clothes and took a quick shower. He replayed the fight with the Arachne. What had caused her to hesitate and back away from him? While Bobby took his turn in the bathroom, Dean sprawled on his bed, flipping channels, but not really seeing anything. It was then he suddenly remembered taking the amulet out of the car and putting it into his pocket. He ruffled through the filthy ranger uniform until he found the small, black bag. Carefully, he pulled it open and dumped out the contents onto the nightstand: dried twigs, leaves, and a few small stones. He poked them with his finger.
"That would probably be a good idea," Gabriel chimed in. Castiel stayed quiet. He didn't know why, but he trusted Dean. He could understand his friends' concerns though.
"I was talking more in the lines of technology, Dean. Phone...internet..." At the last word, Benny's face hardened. Dean swallowed, so that his Adam's apple bobbed up and down.
"I'll walk you into town. You'll be able to call Sam from Benny's," Castiel said, his eyes on the rapidly cooling breakfast on his plate.
"The night before the ritual," Benny replied without looking up from the crossword puzzle he was doing.
Before he could turn to the north, he felt a surge come from the earth. A picture of Dean's face flashed in his mind. He staggered and looked to the moon. What was she trying to tell him? He made his way to the northern candle and finished the rite before completing the circle by the eastern candle. He walked the circle counterclockwise and extinguished each candle. At his alter, Castiel raised his arms for the final time and said, "So mote it be."
Bang, bang. Castiel jerked out of a dream. Dean was already at the door, flinging it open. "Christ...what time is it?"
He slept more soundly than he had in a long time...since before Dean came to disrupt his life...since before Dean stole his heart.
Castiel ground the dried herbs into a powder, but his mind wasn’t on the salve he was supposed to be making to sell. His head felt too full, going in several directions at once. Perhaps he needed to get out of the cabin for a while. Since the first snowfall last week, he’d been content to stay inside where the fire kept him warm. Today, he was restless, something was coming. Bad or good, Castiel didn’t know. Perhaps later he would try scrying to reveal the reason behind his unease.
"Good idea," John said. "You'll have to forget about the skinwalker. Or you can send your...friend...by himself...since he's an expert. We've got bigger fish to fry."
"Fifty Shades of Grey? Cas, babe, that's a book for repressed housewives who've never seen a porn movie. It's trash."
Offering kind words and soft touches, Castiel tried to get Dean to relax and rest. Silently, he drew circles on Dean's chest. With each circle, he silently thanked the Goddess for bringing him Dean Winchester. As the circles got bigger, so did Castiel's words of love to Brighid and Dean. Until Dean shoved his hand away. He stared at Dean's panic filled eyes. "What..." Before he could finish asking Dean what was wrong, Dean yanked up the quilts and muttered something about going to sleep.
Castiel winced when Dean laughed. "Trust? That's rich, Cas." How could he prove to Dean he wasn't lying?
"Castiel, Dean doesn't say those words unless he really means them," Sammy said. Castiel had forgotten his presence for a second and was embarrassed by revealing his heartache. He turned to look at the tall, younger man.
Castiel smiled. "Yes, that Gabriel." Castiel returned to the task at hand. He poured honey into a large bowl, then he added the coconut oil. He was adding the aloe vera when he felt Dean's presence at his back.
"Thank you." Castiel nodded at her and her clan. In the center of the pentagram, Castiel prepared his altar. He unfolded the black cloth and on it, he placed his small cauldron.
Who was this person? Why was this man in his forest? Castiel went back to the man’s things. He found a wallet tucked into the back pocket of the man’s jeans. The leather was wet, as was everything inside. There were five credit cards, each with a different name, a driver’s license with the name Dean Winchester on it, fifty dollars in cash, and a condom. He moved on to the backpack. He found water, some processed food that made Castiel turn up his nose, a flare gun with extra flares, another pistol, and a box of bullets. Castiel packed everything back into the pack except for the guns. He took them outside and left them next to the first pistol. Guns had so much negative energy. He’d have to smudge the house very soon.
"That's just fine and dandy. What the fuck am I supposed to be doing? Because I'm really tired of sitting around here with my thumb up my ass."
"When we got to the edge of town, your wolf showed up. She...this is gonna sound crazy, but it was like she was trying to communicate with me. Kind of like Lassie wanting Timmy to follow him to the well."
Soon enough, Dean heard the gurgle of water going down a drain, and the curtain was pushed back. Cas emerged, wrapped in a towel. And Dean stopped breathing. What was it about the man that made Dean like a bitch in heat every time he saw Cas without clothes? As Cas walked by, Dean couldn't help but feel inadequate. Was it witchcraft that gave Cas the abs of steel? He self consciously sucked in his stomach.
"A young man, tall with long hair, is making his way here. An older man...I sensed a goodness in him...was arguing with another man..."
Castiel smiled and squeezed Dean's hand. "No." Castiel started undoing the braid cord clasps on Dean's robe and Dean hissed, "Cas..." He looked around, panic making his eyes huge. "What are you doing?"
Castiel spent the morning helping in the store while Benny was in Casper picking up the parts. When he returned, Castiel watched him change out his headlights. "Dean seems to be better at the whole mates thing," Benny said, out of the blue. They'd been silent up until that moment.
"Is there a spell to make this part...easier?" Dean's tone matched Cas' and his husband...his husband...laughed. His body rocked and Dean liked the way it felt. "Come on, Babe. Show me some magick."
The witch stared into his eyes for several seconds, and then she shrugged. "You will have to ask her. It is not mine to share." Dean frowned.
He stood in the center of the circle, hands aloft. Seconds ticked by and Brighid did not appear. Had he insulted her? Was she angry with him?
He got out of bed and did his morning chores while Dean slept. He cleaned out Pierce's litter box and let the cat out to hunt. While she was gone, he filled her water bowl. While he was sweeping the floor, he heard movement on his porch and then three swift knocks. Dean sat straight up in bed. "What..."
He allowed Castiel to help him with his t-shirt and flannel. Castiel gave Dean's socks a look of contempt and tossed them aside. He opened a drawer in an old dresser and handed Dean a pair of thick wool socks. He even tied Dean's boots. Dean's bladder was not happy at the amount of time it was taking. "Can we hurry?"
"Your cat is watching us...did she watch us the whole...time?" Dean couldn't break the cat's stare, and he was feeling really exposed.
His tread on the porch was heavier than normal to give the hunter warning of his arrival. He opened the door. Dean was lying on the bed, back to the door. He didn't move, even with the shutting of the door. Was he asleep or was he just ignoring Castiel?
"Okay...let me just..." Dean looked at the wooden box where Cas had gotten the lube. "...do you have any condoms?"
Dean shoved him backwards and tried to tickle him. But hearing Dean's laughter and unmanly squeals when Castiel got him back was music to his ears.
Dean sat down on the edge of the tub and watched the water flowing from the spout for a few seconds, and Castiel's heart seemed to crack. But then Dean looked up and captured his eyes. "Cas, we are both men...I figured out we can't have kids a long time ago."
One by one, the people of the town gathered. The story was told over and over again, until everyone knew the threat was over. It was close to midnight when the beams from a pair of headlights flashed in the lone window in the front of the bar. Castiel stood up. He hadn't sensed John Winchester's demise and neither had Missouri, but he knew Dean's father would never be the same. He wondered how it would affect Dean, and a small knot of fear rose in his chest.
Leaving the cabin...HIS cabin...in an angry huff wasn’t the smartest thing he'd ever done, but the man was infuriating. He stopped at the tree line. During the ritual, his circle kept the cold at bay. But now, he needed help. Castiel pulled the small pouch from his pocket and called for his Goddess. "Brighid, I call upon you. Warm my body and protect me from the cold on this night." Energy crackled around him as he took the small bit of amber from the pouch. He closed his fist around it and felt the warmth flow over him.
Dean swallowed and nodded. "Yes, I do, Cas. I'm just kind of nervous." Cas' thumbs were rubbing circles on the skin of his inner thighs and when he focused on that, Dean felt his heart rate slow. Without loosing eye contact, Cas reached for the wicker basket and pulled out the jar of oil.
"I'm not," Castiel avowed. To prove it, he grabbed the quilts off the bed and laid them on the trunk and stripped the sheets. He was about to toss the sheets into the large wicker hamper that held his dirty laundry, when Dean's scent assailed him. He closed his eyes and inhaled deeply. When he opened them again, Pierce seemed to be amused by his actions. "You shut up."
"Whoa. What for?" Dean backed a step away from the table almost knocking Nimue over. She pushed him forward again, and he gave her a nasty look.
Dean brought his head up, confused. What the hell was Cas talking about? "What? And isn't Arif the Djinn?"
He pulled the blankets back up, covering the man's naked body. Castiel tried to keep his interest at bay. The stranger's body was well muscled and Castiel hadn't felt lust in so long, he wasn't sure what the feeling was at first. The hairless chest dipped down to a softer belly, the thin line of hair ran from his navel to his bush. He looked away before he could focus on what lay nestled in the curls. Castiel watched the deathly pale skin begin to regain its color. He lifted his eyes and thanked Brighid, the Goddess of healing, poetry, crafts, holy wells, and eternal flame. His Goddess.
When he heard the clump of boots on the porch, he jumped up and swung the door open. "Cas," he shouted happily and then frowned. "Benny."
"You've already had a setback because of your...stubborn, idiotic actions...you will eat in bed," Castiel said bossily. Dean liked the haughty look Castiel gave him, it was kind of sexy.
"Just go," Dean shouted, and Benny hit the gas. They passed the point where Benny's truck tires blew, and Dean instinctively held his breath. He blew it out as the car picked up speed and turned onto 220. A Wyoming Highway Patrol SUV was waiting and passed them, lights flashing. Benny fell in behind it, and Dean watched the needle hit eighty...then eighty-five.
"No, but they have the right to peace like the rest of us. People can be cruel to those that are different."
"How did he find his way back, Castiel," Benny asked accusingly. Castiel exhaled and wished he'd never gotten out of bed that morning. He held up the amulet.
This time, when he lifted his arms, he could smell the salt air of the ocean despite being hundreds of miles from any coast.
"Goddess of Earth, Sea and Sky, Mistress of Wisdom and Inspiration. Come and be with me. I offer humble tokens from my hands to yours. Please answer my call."
Dean stopped his pacing and stared, his mouth agape. "You've got to be kidding me. An archangel? Seriously?"
His eyes followed Cas to the small dresser and when he bent over to retrieve a pair of sleep pants, Dean may have drooled. He wiped his mouth, just to be sure. Then the motherfucker dropped the towel, giving Dean a view of that perfect ass. Dean turned away. After a moment, Cas walked by him again and began pumping more water into the tub. Another slight of hand and Cas smiled at Dean. "Your water is ready."
The buzz of excited conversation grew louder. Castiel was surprised to see Missouri stand up in the back of the room. He hadn't noticed her come in with the rest of the late afternoon crowd. "I've seen things...dangerous things coming, but this young man isn't the cause." She looked at Dean and gave him a warm smile. "This young man would fight for us."
"I admit the writing is like that of an uneducated teenager, but I don't understand why you say it's for repressed housewives. The protagonist spanks the main character, and I don't find that believable..."
Castiel felt Dean tense up beside him. John's eyes seemed to bore into Castiel's before they shifted to his son's. "Something you want to tell me, Dean?"
"I'm not a fool, Castiel. Benny has carried a torch for you from the first day you arrived in Lafitte. This man, your hunter, made him jealous."
"Bobby's cell and his hotline," Dean murmured and looked up at Benny. Castiel saw respect dawn in Dean's eyes, and strangely enough, in Benny's too. Benny pushed the phone towards Dean.
Castiel's heart hurt. He'd tried to love Benny. And he did love him but not in the way his friend wanted him to...not the love that lasted an eternity. He wouldn't have that with Dean either. He turned back to the cabin and saw Dean standing there, bundled in his coat. His expression was unreadable. How much had he seen?
"Same thing...were you conjuring up a demon or something?" Dean rolled his feet off the bed and sat up.
The obsidian felt warm in his hands. Green clouds moved over the surface. Dean asleep. Safe...but restless. Dean was safe and that was all that mattered. He wrapped his mirror in the purple silk cloth and tucked it into the trunk.
He laughed softly, sadly. "Yes, but fate isn't always a good thing. Is it?" He hung his head, staring at their clasped hands.
They ate in companionable silence. The soup was delicious. Normally, Dean didn't like anything that didn't have meat in it, but he had to admit the hearty bean and vegetable mixture hit the spot. "Do all witches know how to cook like this?"
Cas pumped water into the tub and waved his hand, murmuring his 'instant' hot water spell. He pulled the curtain. Dean's imagination ran wild. Cas naked and wet, leaning back in that tub...Dean sitting in his lap, riding his cock...Dean wrinkled his nose at the fantasy. Water sex didn't work out too good. Water tended to wash away any lube you use. He was pondering starting a new fantasy when Cas spoke. "How are you going to approach your father, Dean?"
The vampire took pity on Sam. "Gabriel doesn't sleep, Sam. You can take his bed, and Gabriel will keep watch on your father...isn't that right, Gabriel?"
The six of them gathered around a table and ran through all the possible scenarios. Castiel was glad Gabriel didn't bring up the memory wiping idea.
Dean listened to silence. He refused to turn around to see Benny, knowing he heard Dean's announcement. After a few moments, Dean asked, "You still there?"
After they unclamped the cables, Dean got into the passenger seat of the big truck, and Benny started the engine. "Thanks again for this. I know I'm not your favorite person."
Castiel felt his own anger rise. "Don't you dare tell me what I feel, Dean. I felt things for you before the Goddess told me you were my true mate."
Benny's body language was relaxed and Dean waited. "Family of four, camping trip. Found their motor home at the bottom of a ravine eight miles due north of here. The highway patrol thinks they ran off the road during the last big snowfall."
She tilted her head and her smile was placating. "My Child, there has been no manipulation. True love cannot be manipulated."
Dean laughed nervously. "That leaves me out. Nobody ever accused me of being true...whatever that means...or righteous." Cas continued to stare for a few seconds, and then he stood abruptly, the chair scraping loudly across the floor.
The men's entrance had quieted the room. Benny, as respective of Sam and Dean's feelings as he could be, related John's condition, and the plan to move the hunter to South Dakota as soon as he was stable. He ended his speech by saying that they were safe again. Chairs scraped against the old wood floors as everyone began to mill about. Some left, others remained. Of those that remained, Castiel was proud as he watched them come up to the brothers and pay their respects. Even Arif nodded to Dean, and for the Djinn, that was almost as good as a hug.
He turned to the side, now glaring at himself critically. When had this band of fat shown up? Surely it hadn’t always been there, he would remember seeing this!
"Thanks, Babe." Dean settled back on his pillow while Castiel put the things away. After he was back in bed, they curled into each other and kissed. The kisses were punctuated by words of love and promise.
But then Castiel returned the kiss, a pleased hum emanated from his throat and his hands found the soft flesh above the towel still wrapped around Dean’s waist.
With the help of Gabriel and a few members of Garth's pack, Benny got Bobby's tires changed out and Dean's battery installed. As the afternoon turned into evening, Castiel decided to walk back to the cabin. He wasn't sure when Dean was coming back.
"No." Okay, so the witch had his cranky pants on, because Dean insulted his...his...what? His religion? His way of life?
Benny was trying to hide a smile. He turned to Sam. "What's your plan?" Sam was now squatting down, petting Pierce. Cas' cat was tolerating it, but her eyes were still on Dean.
"Does it make me a bad person if I don't really care if I ever see him again?" He sounded broken. Castiel wanted to hold him close, but he settled for putting his hand over Dean's.
The lower half of his body was still in the frigid water, but he didn’t have the strength left to pull himself out. He blinked, and the creature was gone. Dean sank into oblivion.
Arif stood up, addressing Benny, but not taking his eyes off Dean. "One of us? How can a hunter be one of us. He's a Winchester. His reputation precedes him, Benny. How can he be trusted?"
"Okay...okay...fuck...give me a minute..." Dean couldn't wrap his head around the thought of going bareback. It just wasn't done. His father had drilled it into him throughout his teenage years. 'You can't risk knocking someone up, Dean. You come home with the clap, and you're on your own, Dean.' But this was Cas, and John wouldn't ever chastise him again. He swallowed and nodded. He slowly pulled his fingers out, and Cas removed his a second later.
"May these hands be blessed this day. May they always hold each other. May they have the strength to hang on during the storms of stress and the dark of disillusionment. May they remain tender and gentle as they nurture each other in their wondrous love. May they build a relationship founded in love, and rich in caring. May these hands be healer, protector, shelter, and guide for each other."
The dark haired man shook his head. "I have what I need." Yeah, well, Dean needed to get out of here. He moved to stand, holding onto the plain white sheet to cover him, but his legs trembled. He felt a wave of dizziness.
"Damn it, Cas. Just give me a Goddamn minute," Dean snarled, pinching the bridge of his nose. It wouldn't go very well if he lost his temper too. He counted to ten. Cas was giving him a bitchface to rival Sam's. "Okay, waking up to you this morning...it was like..." Damn feelings. He had to talk about feelings, and he hated it. He started pacing. Pierce leapt out of his way with a hiss. She jumped up on the bed and sat, tail switching side to side. Even the cat was pissed at him. "It was pretty awesome."
He pulled into a small roadside diner for lunch just outside of Denver and went inside. He inhaled and smiled. He loved the smell of grease. Grease meant his favorite things were cooking. Burgers and fries. The waitress flirted shamelessly with him. He thought about cutting the day short and just getting a hotel there. She was definitely interested.
After several minutes of exchanging soft kisses, they pulled back slowly. Castiel’s thumbs were still rubbing over Dean’s skin, Dean’s hand still gently cupping the back of Castiel’s head. They looked at each other, and Dean was struck with the fondness in Castiel’s eyes.
"Finish your lunch, old man," Benny said, nudging Bobby's elbow. Dean saw the look of affection in Bobby's face. Damn, Bobby had been hunting long before his dad; yet, he was sitting in a bar with a vampire, a witch, and an archangel. His father would have been trying to slaughter them all. That realization floored Dean. He looked at Cas. Something must have told Cas that Dean was just this side of losing his sanity, because Cas took his hand, interlacing their fingers. It grounded Dean, and he felt the pressure in his chest lessen.
"Very much." Their lips met, and the jar was forgotten for awhile. Dean's hands moved up and down Castiel's back, inching closer and closer to his ass. Castiel smiled against Dean's lips. "You can touch me there, Dean." Dean sucked in a breath, but let himself grip Castiel's cheeks.
"Yeah, guess you've gotta get back to the old grind, huh?" Dean's expression was guarded, but Castiel could tell Dean would miss his brother.
"Maybe because you’re a freakin' witch, and I can't stop thinking about you. I can smell you. I fuckin' dream about you. So, keep your Goddamn amulet, and go back to your bloodsucking lover, and leave me the fuck alone."
"It's not likely, not with the medical issues your father had. This could have happened behind the wheel of his car or while he was getting out of bed in the morning." The doctor stood. "You can see him, but I want to get your own injuries looked at first."
Sometime later, Castiel's finger brushed over the stitches on Dean's arm. He remembered that he wanted to put some of his healing balm on it and moved to sit up. "Hey, where are you going?" Dean asked, pulling on Castiel's hand to hold him in place. They had since moved so their heads were on the pillows.
"I thought you were a goner, and then she jumped back like she'd been burned. She actually looked scared for a second."
He couldn't delay this any longer. "Thanks, Cas. Thanks for everything." Their breaths showed in puffs of vapor in the frozen air.
Those with children left to go to their homes, and the others wandered into Gabriel's bar. There would be food there to celebrate the harvest. The next ritual was for Castiel alone.
"Yes," Castiel replied, coming forward with the box of jars. "Benny, this is Dean. Dean, this is my friend, Benny."
Castiel ran his thumb across Dean's knuckles. "Someone who has been belittled and abused. Someone who didn't have a childhood. Someone who just wanted to be loved by the person who helped bring them into the world. Someone like me."
"Oh, yeah." Dean rolled down the window and pulled out the tiny corpse. He hurled it away from the car, and Benny put the car back in gear. Dean turned in his seat to look back at Castiel. "You don't think she'll know I tossed her present, do you?"
"What's new? Did we figure out why the freaky stuff is happening?" Gabriel asked, looking from one to the other.
While Castiel didn't need modern medicine, he was aware that vaccinations were needed in today's world. Unfortunately, gypsies didn't trust doctors. Their children weren't inoculated. "She has measles, Ruby."
Dean only dozed in and out that night. His mind was on Cas and the damn spell. When he awoke, he got a map, and worked out the route back to Lafitte. The town wasn't on the maps, and he frowned. He swore it was on there before. He knew he could remember the way once he got to Casper. After he packed and loaded the Impala, he shared a cup of coffee with Bobby.
When Dean blurted out, "I love you." Castiel was stunned and he froze, forgetting what he was doing until Dean begged him not to stop. Dean was intent on watching their hands as they both chased their release, but Castiel needed to see his eyes. He needed to see the love in that beautiful green gaze.
"Yeah, okay," Dean said, his voice cracked with emotion. Cas' soft smile gave him courage, and he began to move his hand up and down his cock.
The wolf's ears flicked forward, and she turned her head. Dean heard the sound of the door open and close. Great. He really needed time to think. Dean hadn't meant to growl at Cas. He saw hurt flicker in Cas' eyes. Then they were blank. Then the damn witch told him who to choose. Oh, no, he didn't come out and say, "Yo, Dean, choose your daddy." No, it was more subtle than that.
When he pulled back the curtain, he was dressed in jeans and a flannel shirt. He should start a fire, but before he could voice his intentions, Dean stopped in front of him. "I've got to get back to town, Cas. I've got to talk to Sam again...Bobby too."
Cas stepped forward and opened the door, and Sam led the way inside. Dean didn't turn around to see if his father was following, but he heard Gordon grumbling. He didn't have a clue how to fix this. The goddess wouldn't let him leave, and his father was trying to force him to go. He heard the clump of feet behind him and released a sigh of relief.
He blew out a breath nervously, but pulled his coat on. "I'll just be out at the shed..." He let his words trail off because neither man was paying attention. He let the door shut behind him and hesitated on the porch. When nothing could be heard from inside, he knew Benny was waiting for him to leave. "Damn," he muttered as he headed for the lean-to.
"You know what I am, I know what you are, so I'm not going to pussyfoot around here. There have been some disappearances. I'm here to find out what's going on and gank whatever it is that's causing them. Vampire, wendigo, shifter...whatever."
"Thanks, Bobby. I...I..." Dean wanted nothing more than to tell the man he loved him, but Bobby would think he was possessed or something. "I'll see you soon."
Castiel stopped midway up. "My altar, my books, my sanctuary." With nothing else forthcoming, Castiel ascended to his loft. Usually, being in the presence of his altar grounded him, but tonight he felt like a thousands ants were crawling on his skin. He crawled to the edge of the loft and looked down. Dean caught the movement and looked up. "Why do you care?" Castiel asked quietly.
They pulled up next to John's truck. Dean eyed the vehicle as he got out of the car. "What are we going to do with Dad's truck, Sam?"
"This is a cluster fuck." There was a pair of moccasins on the floor, and Dean put them on. He wrapped the coat tightly around himself and stepped onto the porch. "Cas," Dean yelled, louder this time.
Castiel looked down at his glass and began to nervously trace his finger through the condensation. "Oh, this ought to be good, if our little witch is at a loss for words," Gabriel teased. "Do tell." The angel propped his chin up in his hands, elbows on the bar, looking at Castiel expectantly.
"I think love is something special, and when you find it, you fight for it. You hold onto it with everything you have. Man or woman, it don't matter."
"His sons," Sam answered. Dean couldn't look away from the window. He didn't want to see the hatred in his father's eyes. He'd seen disappointment in them his whole life, but it didn't stop him from doing everything to make his dad proud. So much for that.
"I've never shared a bath," Castiel said, slowly tracing his fingertips up and down Dean's calf. They stared at each other for a few moments, seemingly lost in thought. Clearing his throat, Castiel reached for the soap and set about finishing his bath. The faster he finished, the faster they could go to bed. Dean was on the same page and held his hand out for the soap. Castiel lathered his hands, and then passed the bar to his mate. Carefully, Castiel pulled back his foreskin and cleaned the area. A small noise made him raise his eyes. Dean was staring at his cock. The feelings of inadequacy reared their head again. "Dean, I'm sure Arif can..."
"You are lying, Dean." Cas' words were teasingly sweet and Dean knew it was one of the main reasons he loved this man.
Once the two men were settled in their beds and the fire stoked for the evening, Castiel blew out the candle on his nightstand. Dean was on his stomach, reading by a single taper. Pierce lay nestled next to his side. Traitor. She never liked anyone except him and Benny.
"Cas...you think giving him a nickname will lure him into bed with you? He's too good for the likes of you. He came here for safety and peace, leave him to it."
"I came to Lafitte needing peace. The people here didn't care what I was. They only cared if I meant to do them harm. They are my friends. Benny is my friend." Dean snorted. Castiel's voice softened. "He wanted more, but I could not give him what he needed. It ended before it began." Castiel fingered the small red pouch that rested against his skin. Nutmeg for health and strength, bones of a squirrel for sight, a few small crystals. It grounded him.
Again, he lifted his arms towards the bright moon. The candle flared, and he felt his skin warm. Slowly, he returned to his altar and picked up the chalice of water.
Dean finally stepped into his father's line of vision and met those cold eyes. "Dad, you're gonna be fine." Now, he was lying too.
"Huh?" Dean tensed and looked around expecting to see his father or Gordon. Cas didn't answer his question but instead walked around the side of the building, Dean hot on his heels.
There it was again, that little twitch of the witch's lips showing amusement. Dean's smile was there for an instant before he realized what he was doing, and it was replaced with a scowl.
At the crossroads, everyone gathered. He took chalk and drew out a large pentagram in the center of the street. To the family of gypsies that lived at the south of town, Castiel asked, "Has it been done?"
His husband, the traitor, burst out laughing. Dean sat mortified. The vampire, who he now thought of as a friend, was glaring at him. With a eerie growl, Benny turned away, but not before Dean heard the words 'docking' and 'motherfucker'.
“Look at me, Cas. Look! Unless you can mojo away all this,” Dean grabbed his lower belly in both hands, jiggling it for emphasis, “then no, you can’t help me.”
Throughout his adult life, Dean rarely needed anything. He wanted things, like good food, good sex, good whiskey, but need wasn't in his vocabulary. Until now. He'd listened to Cas pouring out his story. Oh, he'd read some of it in Cas' grimoire, but hearing it in Cas' tortured voice made it different...made it real. Seeing Cas in pain helped him overcome his own shame at the way he treated his father. It made him realize that just because someone makes a baby, it doesn't make them a parent. Cas' grandmother was a parent...Dean's mother was a parent.
"Let's wait for Dean." Dean came out, dressed in jeans and a button down shirt. He had his socks and boots in his hands. He took one of the other chairs and brought it to the table.
"Sorghum." At Dean's blank look, Cas opened the jar. "It's like syrup. Try it before you turn up your nose at it."
"Well, aren't you tall, dark, and handsome," Gabriel said. With a snap of his fingers, he was in front of Sam...barely a foot between them. Sam stumbled back against Dean. "Good looks run in the family...Sammy."
Dean waited, but Bobby didn't answer. Thinking he fell asleep, he closed his eyes willing his own body to shut down for the night.
"I got it from a reliable source," Gordon said belligerently. Bobby snorted. Sam and Cas were following the conversation like they were at a tennis match. Dean was impressed that they were making up this story on the fly.
Dean, who had one foot out for the next step, stopped and came close to losing his balance. No way could these women...these really hot women...be Cas' aunts...his great aunts.
"Garth, get your pack together and start passing the word," Benny said. He looked at the remaining men. "I'll disappear. I've got my satellite phone. Gabriel can get in touch with me..." The rest of his sentence didn't need to be put into words. If something were to go wrong, people would die, whether it be the hunters or their friends.
Cas looked away at Dean's words. "I'm sorry you are stuck with me, Dean." Okay, so now Dean felt like an ass. He wasn't stupid, he knew Cas cared about him...thought of him as a friend. He'd said so. If he wasn't a witch, Dean could see them being really great friends...maybe more. But he was a witch. Not someone he could take home to his father. Dean imagined that conversation. 'Gee, Dad, this is Cas...he's my new boyfriend, and he's a witch.' When he picked himself up off the floor after being punched by John Winchester, he'd be on his own. He wasn't sure which part his old man would hate the worst, Dean doing dick or fucking a witch.
Lilura, or at least Dean thought that was her name, moved forward and touched his face. He tried to move away, but Cas' hand was holding him. "You cover your insecurities with humor. Don't be afraid of your destiny, child. Castiel is truly good. You will have a strong, unbreakable bond." She closed her eyes, her touch warm on his face. Everyone stood perfectly still, like they were waiting on pins and needles. She opened her eyes, smiled at Dean, and then turned to her sisters. Dean saw a smile on her face and the women all seemed to relax. Dean looked at Cas questioningly.
Benny offered to drive Castiel home after the town meeting, but he chose to walk. He took the shortcut through the deep forest and paused when he came upon Missouri's cottage. She hadn't been at the meeting, but smoke drifted from her chimney and the lights were on. He stomped his feet on her doormat and knocked.
"Castiel is right. Dean is supposed to be here," Missouri said in a voice that made people stop talking and listen. "Dean is fated to be here. Danger is coming, but Dean and Castiel will be able to stop it."
All Dean wanted was a shower, beer and a few uninterrupted hours of bad TV. And that’s exactly what he was going to do, thank you very much.
Back inside the cabin, they took off their coats, and Castiel announced he was going to bed. Dean shrugged after looking at his watch. Castiel didn't have a timepiece, he just knew it was his usual bedtime. "If you want to read, it won't bother me," Castiel said, pushing the grimoire across the bed towards Dean. Dean took it and stepped over to his bedding. "Uhm, hey, Cas...your cat is in my bed."
"It is time," Castiel stated somberly. Benny existed on the blood of the cattle at the surrounding ranches, but without human blood, he became weak. Others in the town offer themselves to Benny a few times a year and he reluctantly feeds. He hasn't drank from Castiel since their shared night. Witch blood is powerful, but because of their history, Benny would not discuss drinking from Castiel.
When the machine pulled up behind Benny's store, Cas cut the engine. They pulled off their helmets, and Cas lifted his chin like he was sniffing the air. "Someone is here."
"Cas says we have to do this thing naked with wedding robes...Benny, I don't want to get naked in front of a bunch of old ladies." Benny's smirk filled Dean with dread.
"Thank you." Dean felt Sam's presence behind him and then the light touch on his shoulder. "Come on, Dean."
He didn't answer and Dean caught the twitch of his lips before he turned back to his shelf of jars. "Echinacea, Goldenseal, and Marshmallow root are to keep you from getting sick. They have been used for centuries by the Druids and, even, Native Americans. If you were to go into a drug store, you could find all of these ingredients bottled as supplements."
"Are you talking a nursing home? Where the people sit around...drooling and pissing on themselves?" Dean asked bitterly. Sam hissed beside him. The priest looked at Dean with pity, and that made Dean even madder. "He's not going to one of those places," Dean stated adamantly.
He stepped towards the west and bent to light the first candle. He faced the western sky. "I, Castiel, come into the Circle of Water, a Circle of Might, to sing of my family on this Holy Night." He placed a pomegranate down to welcome those from the hereafter.
Leaning in closer, his brows drawing together severely, he noticed a few grey hairs scattered through his russet colored hair. Not only was he fat, he was getting old!
Everyone but Dean ordered beer. Dean asked for whiskey with a water back. Cas pressed his leg against Dean's under the table. Dean knew Cas was warning him. He'd need to keep his head in the game, but damn, he needed a drink.
"Love...Dean, no...I don't..." Why would Dean think the amulet was a love... "What makes you think that?"
"Yeah, well sometimes I can play nice with others." Needing time to think, Dean picked up the grimoire again and opened it to the page he'd marked with a feather he'd pulled off Cas' nightstand. Cas accepted Dean's silence and sat down at his work table again. Dean glanced up once and Cas was putting more stuff in jars. Dean began to read.
Cas turned again. "Mighty water, that quenches our thirst and is essential to all life, I call to thee." When he turned again, he saw Dean, and he faltered on the words. "Mighty earth..." Gathering himself, he finished. "...that we walk upon and must treat as our own kin, I call to thee."
Dean had to admit he was freaked. First, Cas hits him with the whole marriage thing. Marriage. He'd been shocked, but the idea had grown on him pretty quick. It was one step closer to the apple pie life he'd never let himself dream about. Just when he was getting used to it though, Cas tossed in the part about his great aunts. Six witches...six powerful witches... What if they didn't like him. What if they didn't think he was good enough for their precious nephew?
"Yeah, just...go the fuck to sleep, Cas," Dean said without any heat behind the words. Silently, Cas blew out the candle next to the bed and reclined on his pillow, turning his back to Dean. Dean took care of his own candle and tried to get comfortable, but his eyes were drawn to Cas' back. In the firelight, he could still make our Cas' tattoo...at the hundreds of birds flying away from the tree. Was it an omen?
The sound of a snowmobile cut through the stillness of the morning. Benny was early. If Castiel had been alone, Benny would probably show up around noon, but his friend was possessive when it came to Castiel. He rolled out of bed and didn't bother to put on his coat. He got to the door and opened it just as Benny raised his fist to knock. "Good morning."
From across the room, Castiel watched Dean and Mab talking. He looked a bit angry, but Castiel trusted his great aunt. Nimue caught his eye and with a wink, she walked over to the bed and spoke. He saw her laugh and knew all would be right.
Cas blinked at him like he was a complete idiot. "No." That was it. Just no. Cas better find some more words soon because he had some explaining to do. Dean took off his coat and hung it on the hook by the door. Cas did the same. Then he sat at the table, putting the amulet Dean had thrown on the ground earlier down in front of him. Dean grabbed the chair, turned it around, and sat with his arms across the back of it. They stared at each other. Dean was bound and determined he was going to win this contest. Without taking his eyes from Dean, Cas slid the pouch across the table. "This is what saved you from death. That is all it did, Dean. I do not make love potions or do love spells."
The whole morning was surreal. Six witches...beautiful, young witches...just show up out of the blue. How did they get to Wyoming from over in Ireland, or wherever the fuck they came from? Listening to all of them making plans for this handfasting thing gave him the heebie-jeebies. And the thought of getting naked in front of a bunch of old ladies was bad enough, now he was going to get naked in front of a bunch of Sports Illustrated models.
"He won't be able to find his way back, will he?" Benny asked, staring at Dean through the windshield.
Cas pushed in another finger and Dean let a whimper escape. "With a penis your size, four fingers should suffice to give the muscle ample..."
Thoroughly disgusted with himself, Dean pushed back from the mirror and paced the room. He stopped long enough to grab the beer he’d bought earlier and downed one in three large gulps.
"I'm sorry, Benny. I had something come up." Benny followed Castiel's gaze to the bed. His friend's eyebrow lifted. Reading his thoughts, Castiel blushed. "No, it's not...Dean...a hunter...fell through the ice yesterday morning."
In the center of the circle was a large crystal and a white candle. "For balance, wholeness, integrity, and spirit. This I ask of you. So mote it be." As with the others, the candle flared. "It is time to exchange the rings to bind yourselves, one to the other." Cas took Dean's hand and slipped on a ring that matched the one Mab gave him. Dean, in turn, pushed his ring onto Cas' finger.
"Right. Being hunted by my father...a hunter..." Dean barked out a huff of mirthless laughter. "...isn't the best way to start something."
Back at the cabin, Castiel disappeared behind the curtain to dress. He was cold, and the scene in the woods kept playing over and over in his head. He could hear Dean pacing, the steady thump of his boots on the hardwood floors comforted Castiel. For the time being, Dean was still here. The Goddess confused Castiel, she'd said love couldn't be manipulated, but she was using her power to keep Dean in Lafitte.
"Gordon has heard about a town around here where a bunch of monsters have made their home. Now that Bobby and Sam are here, we can locate it and slaughter 'em all."
"Handfasting? It is a symbolic ritual. It binds our hands together as we say our vows to each other," Castiel informed him, knowing Dean wouldn't care about the history of the ceremony.
Dean sent him a glare and crossed his arms over his chest like a petulant child. Castiel found that he wanted to kiss the pout off of Dean's face. Before he could dissect that thought, Benny asked, "Have you decided on your plan, Dean?"
He did know better. Missouri would warn people about tragedies to come. She would tell them they were meant for good things. But...she never went into specifics with her friends. It was a steadfast rule. Like Castiel's...he never scryed himself or his future. Only now, today, he wanted to break the rules. Reading his mind, Missouri chuckled. "No."
"Tell us about the danger, Missouri,"Garth said, speaking up over the din of voices. The room quieted down and the psychic, who still had a grip on Dean's hand, began to speak.
Dean glanced up at Gabriel, who was trying to appear busy behind the bar. He lowered his voice. "Did they know what you were?"
"It's great. Thank you." She wandered off, and Dean stared down at the bowl. Was it the cinnamon or the nutmeg that reminded him of Cas? Or both? Had the witch put a spell on him?
Dean's father walked him to the Impala. After getting rid of the buru buru, they'd taken another case in south Texas. After being with John for seven days, Dean was emotional and physically exhausted. When they got close, John frowned and walked around the car. "You need to get this fuckin' salt off the paint, Dean. When was the last time you washed this car?"
"Uh...huh..." Dean murmured and eased another inch into Cas' willing body. He watched his length disappear until his balls were against the perfect round globes of Cas' ass. Panting now, Dean let his eyes drift up to Cas' cock. It was hard and leaking all over Cas' belly. Dean placed his palm in the puddle of precum and smeared it over Cas' abdominal muscles. It was a kinky...dirty feeling...rubbing his hand through another man's jizz, but erotic as hell. His gaze went to Cas' face again. His eyes were closed, head tilted back, exposing his throat. Dean pulled out a few inches and then entered again. The noise Cas made excited Dean and he did it again...slow and easy...his hand still pressed against Cas' stomach. "You good, Cas?"
"I don't have running water, Dean. No running water means no indoor plumbing." Dean thanked his lucky stars he didn't have to poop. "Let's get you dressed and I'll help you to the outhouse."
