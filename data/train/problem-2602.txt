“'ave you tried my gift, by any chance?” he asked in an unctuous tone, pushing his head against the gap. From that distance Sherlock could smell his breath, as rotten as his own felt inside his mouth.
“... disappear!” Jim’s expression mirrored Sherlock’s own.
and a
My apologies for the wait, but these song-chapters are hard work... I hope you enjoy it and maybe sing along, too!
“He’ll be okay.” the troll assured her.
tupid!” he cried.
“This says they never found the killer,” Sherlock pointed out, ignoring his brother’s argument, “Why are you giving this to me? Why now?”
“The King?”
As much as Sherlock hated proverbs, that particular one had been rattling around his brain for the last two hours - approximately the time when he had lost all feeling in his fingers - and he had to admit there was some truth to it.
He held the skull in front of him with both hands and spun, as if dancing with his skeletal friend.
That last detail seemed to convince John. “Ok, don’t forget to book us a place to stay. I’m not sleeping in some moldy old castle.” he called out, already climbing the steps to his room.
“A pleasure doing business with you,” he said as Sherlock closed the window on his smug face.
He was rewarded with a grateful look from his friend and both stood side by side against his unreasonable brother.
” Sherlock wiggled his fingers in the air, “-actually exists.”
The post is a more or less straightforward description of the episode, so I won’t go into much detail about it.
It's more or less a fanon thing that Sherlock had a lisp as a child, so I decided to incorporate it in his lines.
Extra points for those who got the "cerise" reference.
“At least you could have picked a nicer place,” John grumbled as he took out their bags from the boot.
He understood that his brother had to study hard to become king, but he still had more than enough time to prepare. Plus, Mycroft was very smart - he would learn his lessons in no time. He should be allowed to play, too. To play with Sherlock, to be precise.
“I don’t see my brother often enough to be sure he still lives here.”
“No!” she admitted, before a wistful look clouded her features. “But sometimes I like to close my eyes and imagine what it'll be like when a business opportunity does come…”
In a few disjointed steps, Sherlock climbed up the narrow windowsill, pushing down the several porcelain vases that adorned it. They fell and shattered on the floor with an hilarious popping noise. Sherlock giggled as he looked down at the mess on the carpet. Even the grandfather clock laughed rhythmically from down the hall.
As he came closer, John could see that the prince had had the presence of mind to accept Angelo’s offering of new clothes. He was now wearing a long black coat made of thick wool, decorated along the edges with embroidered green leaves and burgundy flowers. There was a dark blue scarf wrapped securely around his neck and black leather boots on his feet, but - John noticed - no hat on his head. Probably didn’t want to mess his curls, the vain idiot.
“Well, it’s not every day you hit the brother of the future king of Londondalle with your horse.” he said, standing straight again. “You
The King stood over his family, deep in thought. After a few moments he muttered. “I know where we have to go.”
This, and the fact that Sherlock starts to deduce the identity of the shooter makes me believe that
Looking around to make sure no one was watching, John walked carefully towards the channel's newly formed margins. Again, he could see something white and silver dancing for a moment under the surface. He kneeled down and held his gloved hands to the ice's sharp borders. The sunshine pierced the icy water in bright blue pillars that disappeared into its depths. There was nothing but a dark stillness.
Soon enough, they managed to pull the dishevelled ice harvester over the edge and well into safety. Harry lost no time and galloped to John’s side so she could sniff him up and down and lick his face clean.
“Excuse me?” Sherlock asked in an icy tone.
Mrs Turned gave up her efforts and put down the hairbrush with a sigh.
The prince’s sharp gaze zeroed in on his face. “It really doesn’t bother you, does it?”
Reading had become an escape from his daily routine. Every day he could feel the weight of the Palace walls growing around him as the urge to know the outside world was becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. But when he read, his attention was lost inside the books. Every new bit of information became a new brick in his carefully built mental archive - his Mind Palace, he liked to call it, not without some pride. Every new room became a space for his mind to roam free, untethered by inane rules imposed by stupid people.
, Sherlock thought.
, watching them.
“I’m not a damsel in distress,” Sherlock protested half-heartedly, feeling lighter for his outburst.
The funeral was short and to the point, and soon enough the crowds were dispersing, glad to get away from the light drizzle that had begun to fall.
"Are you alright?" his friend asked gently, concern written across his features.
He opened the window with a flourish. The chill breeze that flew in was a blessing against his heated cheeks.
Harry, until that moment distracted by the frozen willow branches, approached the lake to stare at the dancing snow woman. Noticing the reindeer’s interest, Mrs Hudson slid elegantly towards her and put a tender hand on her probing snout.
John had everything he needed. He had Harry - the calf he raised by hand when his father was still a reindeer herder - and now he had a purpose. He would stay and help Mr Murray and he would learn how to be the best ice harvester in the Kingdom.
There are a some new characters commenting on this post, as the blog grows increasingly popular. We have
“It really is lovely, isn’t it? But it’s all so white!” a female voice commented behind him.
His victory was short lived, though, because the bridge ahead was crowded with more revelers, eyeing him with a mix of awe and suspicion. Above their heads, snow began to fall in soft flakes and some turned their heads upwards, surprised at the rapidly changing weather.
Most importantly, John could see two adults covered in long dark cloaks, probably the horse's owners. His eyes widened in surprise when he realized that the frosty trail didn't come from them, but from a boy, about his age, that walked beside the man. The ice didn't stay on the ground for long here, instead it dissolved a few seconds after falling from the boy's hands.
“It won’t do to have you fall off the bed like this,” she carried on, “maybe it was too early for a big boy bed. We’ll put back the rail guards and-”
“You wouldn’t shut up any other way,” the doctor explained and rubbed at his stubbled cheeks, still avoiding his friend's eye.
In retrospect that may have been a bit too much, as his brother returned the gesture with a raised eyebrow and a curious smirk.
“Fetch the Queen’s cloak and mine,” he barked at the maids. They curtsied nervously and ran to comply with the order.
STOP THE PRESSES!!!
Billy’s gaze dropped to his own dirty hands. “He never said. He only said they had given ‘im all that money to keep quiet and that he would be in real trouble if he opened his mouth.”
Silence fell as the boys worked on their snowman. Sherlock rolled a large snowball and put it on the body he had built, giving their client a head. He poked two holes with his finger to make the eyes. After some consideration, he decided to draw a large smile on their client’s face.
“I have other things going on,” he interrupted.
Sherlock smiled at the blatant lie. “No, they don’t.”
“Why?” the young prince asked around a mouthful of eggs.
The younger boy pushed carefully on the door handle and looked into the darkened hallway. Mycroft peered over his brother’s curly head to make sure the coast was clear. Convinced that no one would see them, both brothers broke into a run through the empty hallway and down the spiral staircase.
Why he decided to not mention the assassin to John is unclear, but there is a
“Take care of your brother, will you?” she asked softly.
Sherlock raised both his hands placatingly, regretting his indiscretion. “Calm down. Please, call me Sherlock,” he added for good measure.
Now can U PLEASE explain the secret behind the skull painting?why it changes color?
A few days after Mycroft’s tenth birthday, Sherlock found himself extremely bored. It was Mrs Turner day off and the King and Queen were nowhere to be found. Mycroft had disappeared inside his room after breakfast, claiming the need to finish reading his book. Sherlock remembered his mother had told him that Mycroft had new obligations now, that he mustn't bother him, but Sherlock hoped he could persuade his brother to come and play for a little while, just like they used to.
“Come on, then!” the prince urged her. Not giving her time to answer, Sherlock sprinted out the door and into the hallway.
Sherlock closed his eyes, steepled his fingers under his chin and delved into his memories. He remembered one morning when he came out of his bedroom to find John passed out drunk after a night out with Lestrade, sleeping fully clothed on the living room rug and using his bomber jacket as a pillow. He hadn’t been snoring then, so why was he snoring now? Sherlock knew that the sleep induced by alcohol intoxication was different from natural sleep, but if anything, it would induce further muscle relaxation, thus facilitating the act of snoring.
The northern lights could be seen dancing in the uppermost corner of the large triangular window. The green waves moved to and fro, as if responding to Sherlock reaching hands. Mycroft considered his brother’s penchant for theatrics very annoying.
Mycroft took the yellowing page from his brother’s hand and read it carefully. “You’re certain,” his question sounded like a statement.
His eyes sparkled with a glint of mischievousness that Sherlock wholeheartedly approved of. “You can call me Jim. Hi!” he added in a sing-song voice.
John nodded and set about finishing the last dregs in his bowl. He felt a cold blast of air on his back when Bill Murray stepped into the night with his lamp, before he closed the heavy door behind him.
When the King and Queen entered Mycroft’s bedroom, they found their eldest pacing back and forth, clearly agitated.
“Do you know why I was in town this morning?”
“Well, I’m a bit busy right now, can’t really spare the time for it,” the prince answered drily. He crossed his arms over his chest, trying to control his mounting anxiety.
John was about to call out when the rocks stopped short of the group. One by one, they grew arms, legs and a head, crowned by a patch of grass.
It’s also interesting to know that Harry is surprised to learn that John was a womanizer before he was deployed to Afganistan. This implies
"A troll, yes. Nice to meet you, I’m Ella," she held out a large hand "Come one, be polite. What’s your name?"
Sherlock's head snapped up in alarm. It took him longer than he would like to come up with a retort. "I have no idea what you are talking about. I've merely-"
“I said keep still!” John complained, when a sharp turn threw Sherlock against his side.
As he made his way laboriously onwards, a distant part of his mind recalled the image of his old toy soldiers, happily wobbling on stiff wooden legs as his own little hand pushed them towards a fantastic adventure of his own making.
There isn’t much to say about this one. It was posted two days after the events of ASIP and John mentions he is still writing up the case for the blog. He decides to make a post because Sherlock has received a secret message on his own website
Reaching the other side of the rift, Mycroft took a moment to appreciate the view.
Don’t read that.
His own little blizzard, Sherlock thought, despondently. Well, if he died from taking the concoction, at least he’d have the last consolation of tripping Mycroft with his corpse on his way out of his room.
He concentrated on the memory but it refused to settle into a solid image. He definitely recalled playing in the snow… He remembered running in the garden, with the cedar trees around him, or were they marble columns...?
“I don’t think I need any more of it at the moment...” Sherlock began.
What if the vase slides (and the skull changes) because what we are seeing
The prince stood up in his seat and propped his foot on the sledge’s immaculate dash, provoking a stream of protests from his companion. “Hey! Get down! This is fresh lacquer!”
Look at how John describes the showdown between Sherlock and Moriarty. Sherlock and Moriarty, polar opposites, but very much alike. Each one with their own assistant, their John Watson (
Mycroft sat primly at the edge of the bed, which made Sherlock look up in surprise at the oddly intimate move.
in TFP… I don’t need to go into that, do I?
“Thank you for everything.” the King said, and took his family back to the palace.
“This can’t go on, we have to do something!” she said.
“But don’t worry, I’ll leave the fun.” The Grand Stamford smiled benevolently at Mycroft. He moved his staff again and the image coalesced into a bright blue sphere. With a downward motion of his free hand the sphere descended slowly on Sherlock and disappeared into his forehead.
“Who?” The Queen was becoming irritated by her husband’s secrecy. The freezing mist fell more heavily from Mycroft’s hands.
Arguably, this was the first time John had actually slept in Sherlock's presence. Yes, he had occasionally witnessed the man nap on their sofa on lazy Sunday afternoons, or take a quick kip sitting on a desk when the detective had been too wired to stop the investigation for something as frivolous as resting.
bit Holmes. Where have we seen this three characters -
, this is the first time Sherlock actually comments on John’s blog. If you look at this through TJLC glasses, maybe you can see that Sherlock, who is more than a little intrigued by John, decides to have a look around his blog and makes a seemingly irrelevant comment on his latest post. I say irrelevant because he doesn’t make any reference to neither of the cases John has just mentioned… Guys, he’s flirting…
We held our breaths for months too, Jawn.
The older brother took a deep breath before launching into his explanation. “Carl Powers was a trusted business advisor of the Gaulian ambassador to Londondalle. The bizarre circumstances of his death, combined with the failure of Londondalle’s authorities to explain them, put a severe strain on our diplomatic relations with Gaulia. The Gaulian Prime Minister accused us of not doing enough to solve the case and the trade between our two Kingdoms all but ceased since then.”
Sherlock ignored his brother’s orders and told him of his discovery. “You’ll never guess how amazing the view is from here! You can see all the way to the docks!” he pointed out into the distance. If only his brother would relax and enjoy himself a little, they could explore this new world together.
“He’s not Mycroft,” Sherlock explained, still clearing his throat, “His name is John Watson.”
“How does your heart freeze, anyway? Is it when you fall into the lake, too?” the boy looked up at Bill, barely concealing his frustration. He was getting fed up of all this talk of frozen body parts.
… ancient history, yes, I know. But it’s
“Hm?”
What we are actually seeing is still a matter for debate.
Mycroft felt his eyes burn, threatening a new wave of tears. He stared ahead and grasped the horse’s saddle as hard as he could to try and stop those tears from falling. The stallion neighed his discomfort when it felt a steady stream of ice cold air pass through either side of his flank. Mycroft looked down when he noticed the cold air as well. Swirls of freezing mist were tumbling from his own hands to the ground, leaving a trail of frost on the cobbled streets. Both his parents pretended not to notice.
Sherlock was the first to break the stunned silence, stepping tentatively forward.
“Oh, yeah, I slept fine,” he assured her, climbing his chair. He waited patiently while Mrs Turner pushed his chair forward and tucked his napkin under his chin.
“Really? That
The prince felt his lips pull into a smile as he turned his horse and addressed the courtyard in a clear voice.
Let’s wrap the discussion of the ASIP posts by looking at the comments of the
“Everything is secure,” he informed his brother as he finished his inspection. He was thoroughly ignored.
Sherlock made his way down towards the trees without a second thought, leaving the ice harvest to stew by himself.
“... And that gentleman! Is that him?” Angelo asked, looking over the prince’s shoulder.
“Don’t be dull, Mycroft,” Sherlock spat, making sure his voice traveled all the way across the enraptured crowd. “Jim has helped me capture this dangerous assassin and prevent a terrible tragedy. On your coronation day, no less!"
e’ll come to our detective agency to
“Seriously, were you raised in a barn?!” John finally yelled after a sizable chunk of snow made its way down onto his lap.
, he thought,
Falling backwards to survive as a person and as a character is the most instinctual response. As human beings, we feel safe in stability and fear change. As bad as things were for Sherlock at the time, we cannot blame him for trying to fall backwards and continue to survive in this narrative. But we know where this is going, we were told the same story hundreds of times now…
“I’m not!” Sherlock protested as he ran towards their wardrobe to take out their snow boots, a delighted smile on this little face. He pushed the larger pair on Mycroft’s lap and plopped down on the carpet to put on his own.
ea-lion!”
was also used, but flipped on his head? What if the sweet, simple story of how Holmes met his only friend from University, the one who drove him to pursue criminal investigation as a career (who inspired him to become The Detective), became much darker?
Behind Lestrade, Anderson scoffed loudly despite Donovan’s warning slap on his arm. "Oh please, they’ve planned all of this together. I bet he has magical powers too!"
. And we can see why John chose to publish the other one and save this one for himself.
Sherlock had been expecting this question and delivered the lie he had prepared. “The Exeter Library holds a very interesting manuscript from the fifteenth century concerning various plant-based poisons. I’ve been wanting to take a look at it for quite some time and since Mr Peterson will be so kind as to pay for our travel expenses, it seems like a perfect opportunity for a visit.” He pointed at the train schedules that had just appeared on his screen. “We’ll take the train to Exeter and a rental car from there to a nearby village. We can have a nice dinner and settle in. We’ll meet with Mr Peterson the next morning, I’ll retrieve the necklace in under one hour and then charm the old lady into forgiving her butler. We’ll have the rest of the day to ourselves and be back at Baker Street before dinner time.”
Looking across his imagined audience, the prince noticed an antique display cabinet filled with skulls from different animals, a collection left by his quirky grandmother. On the topmost shelf stood a lonely human skull, gazing back at him with hollow eyes. Sherlock grinned at the skull in return. There was his partner!
Sherlock couldn’t help but smile at himself. He had finally cracked the code! After all his troubles, he now knew what made John snore! He could now sleep soundly knowing this gap in his knowledge had been filled.
“I…” Sherlock stuttered, torn between the warmth of Jim's compliment and the pressing need to find the criminal (
It struck Mycroft deeply to hear what he had done so clinically summarized. He was sharply aware of how careless he had been with his magic, and how his carelessness had hurt his brother. To hear his father say it out loud made the damage sound more definite.
Mycroft smiled despite himself. Maybe he could take his break now, go outside for a bit. How bad could it be if he went and played with Sherlock for a little while? He’d be careful with his powers…
“Thank you, Mrs Turner,” he recited meekly.
Mrs Hudson’s smile returned at the realization. “Oh… He’s a fine-looking one, Sherlock! Nicely done!” she cooed, elbowing Sherlock’s leg for good measure.
Mycroft was unfazed by the display. “Quite the contrary,” he answered calmly, “I'm afraid I'm asking you a very real question.”
This entry (as well as the next one) is very short.
“Why would you want to do that?” asked John, bewildered. Sherlock turned a scathing glare towards the ice harvester. That really wasn’t the most relevant line of questioning right now.
“I can’t!” Sherlock declared solemnly. He flopped on his back and stretched his arms over his head and towards the window, as if trying to reach the night sky.
His companion shrugged dismissively. “We simple folk grow up listening to stories of elves, trolls and draugr. Magic is as real to us as the sun and the seasons…”
“Helps me think,” Sherlock answered the silent question.
“What?”
Come on – that’s …
ea-lion to justice! Do you want to come with me?”
The story has a sweet, sentimental ending to it, in sharp contrast with the use of the ‘Norbury’ reference in T6T.
What if the vase slides because it’s “the thirteenth stroke of the clock” of this scene? What if the vase slides because it’s meant to destroy the reality of this scene?
“Well, maybe they need to make themselves clearer,” he answered moodily and sat at the foot of the queen size bed, duffle bag at his feet.
James Bond
He turned on his heel and opened the doors once again. In the main hall, a small crowd of the palace’s staff had gathered, kept away from the doors by the sergeant and three other soldiers. All fell silent at the sight of the King of Londondalle.
“-Yellowbeard!”
Despite his protests, Sherlock felt John tugging on the rope before it became taut with the other man’s weight. The prince planted his feet wide apart and pulled as hard as he could. The rough rope bit into his gloved hands as he strained against John’s weight, but his job suddenly became much easier when Harry bit down on his end of the rope and began pulling as well.
e’s not our client!
- “This is Sherlock”
“John? Care to elaborate?”
"Please be careful," his friend asked as he threw the cloak over his shoulders.
“You are holding the case file of the Powers murder investigation,” Mycroft explained in a gentler tone.
“That’s the Olissipal envoy,” he told Sherlock in a needlessly quiet voice. “He’s been making eyes at that duke since the crowning ceremony.” As if on cue, the duke locked eyes with his admirer and smiled coyly at him over his drink. “It looks like he’s gotten through…” Jim purred.
The easy confidence of the gesture seemed to push the words out of Sherlock again, in an unstoppable urge to impress his new friend.
) making a show of selecting a puff pastry from a nearby tray, smiling to himself as if they were in on a private joke.
Hearing that, or perhaps just responding to the prince’s earnest tone, Harry mewled dejectedly and started pushing on John’s shoulder with her snout. Defeated, John sat back up, pushing Harry’s head away from him.
You may say “But he will die!”. I will argue that he died falling backwards as well, and was saved by the power of love, of his dedication to John.
Sherlock twisted away from the curtain and made his way to the cabinet in what he hoped was a confident swagger. As soon as he got there, he rested an elbow against the cabinet like someone in casual conversation with the skulls inside.
“Don’t let it show.” they finished their mantra in unison.
Sherlock woke again with bright sunlight filling the bedroom. The first thing he registered was the deep sense of relaxation he felt after a good night’s sleep.
Unlike the other two previous episodes, there are no little sidenotes between bigger case posts. The boys are swept off their feet by this case and have no time do anything else. The timeframe is very short between the two posts. TGG probably started the same day TBB episode ended, or maybe the next, with only a 4 day gap between TBB and TGG posts. Still, John apologizes for the delay!
“Good morning, your Highness,” he bowed respectfully “I’m here to-”
Sherlock stomped his feet all the way to his own bed and put on his robe, not bothering with the sash. He stomped back towards the door, this time grabbing his brother’s hand on his way there.
The other interesting thing about this post is that they did go to the chinese restaurant Sherlock had suggested at the end of the episode.
But the change wouldn’t come. After almost two hours of observation, John continued to sleep silently.
He thanked his host and took a sip of the drink, smiling back at him when he noticed the slight alcoholic tinge in his tongue.
“Yes, that’s right,” she agreed, “but Mycroft is turning ten years-old, and that’s a very important thing.”
For a second, there was a look of sadness in Mycroft’s clear blue eyes, but it disappeared when Jim stepped out of the thinning crowd to stand next to Sherlock.
“Invincible!” Mycroft corrected. “But will they still win against Blackbeard in a storm?!” he asked his imaginary audience.
And here is what Mary is reading:
From the corner of his eye, he saw John’s head turning to him in surprise. “We will?” his friend asked in astonishment.
Now, in the morning light, Sherlock smiled gratefully at the strewn papers. Shortly after solving the Power’s case, he had dived into the realm of criminal investigation with a relentless sense of purpose. More than happy to indulge his brother, Mycroft had directed the Captain of the Guard to supply Sherlock with a steady source of cold cases. Soon enough, his every waking hour was consumed by The Work (capitalized), leaving him with little to no time to entertain darker thoughts of glass vials and wandering senses.
“Mycroft! Hey!” he called out. “Mycroft! You have to see this!”
Sherlock held onto the side of the boat and giggled. “Here we go!”
Giddy with excitement, the prince broke into a run down the main street and onto the docks, relishing the scent of briny air with every deep breath.
Sherlock’s heart was pounding in his chest by the time he reached the main staircase. The main hall was crowded with staff, busily setting new candles and depositing flowers on every horizontal surface. His eyes drank in all the activity going on below and his limbs screamed at him to take part in the action. Sherlock smiled delightedly when he realized that, today, he could.
“Good morning, Mummy.” Sherlock greeted the Queen and kissed her offered cheek. He found the same dark shadows under his mother’s eyes, but unlike Mrs Turner, the Queen looked happy to see him.
the men sang, neither sparing any mind towards the danger of running full speed on rooftops.
Sherlock was jolted awake by the sound of Mrs Turner pointedly pushing back the curtains on the nursery’s window. He shut his eyes firmly and burrowed in his bedsheets in preparation against her usual orders to get up and stop laying about and some other nonsense about early birds and worms.
“Mycroft, please,” Sherlock begged in a last, desperate attempt to reach out to his brother. “I can’t live like this anymore. I-”
Mycroft rolled his eyes and waived one finger in a circle. A new snowman materialized inside the boat, but this time it looked closer to a cylinder with a pirate hat than a human shaped form.
“Sherlock…”
Ready for another song?
Billy laughed again, but it soon devolved into a cough. He smiled at Sherlock as soon as he regained his breath. “Really? You’ll go back to your books, and your roofs, and your windows, and your walls-”
From that moment on, Sherlock’s days fused together in an amorphous haze. Billy would come by his window every two days to bring him more of his product and to collect his payment.
Hypothesis: John only snores when sleeping in a bed. And that was something Sherlock had never witnessed until now, not fully.
“You’re leaving? Actually leaving?” he asked, burying his face in her shoulder.
“No. Today was handled by my personal staff. I don't think a tip off came from them.”
It's really you strolling by
Mycroft’s eyes illuminate with understanding, “The American...Patton.”
Thank you for all who read and especially to those who commented, I love interacting with readers and I appreciate all of the encouragement.
Jim smiles, “Towels are in the cupboard. Don’t be too long”, Jim smooths his hands down Sherlock’s chest, and misinterprets the shiver as pleasurable.
“No,” Mycroft offers no additional explanation.
During WWII in the UK, there were two 'spy' agencies: the SIS - Secret Intelligence Service and the SOE - Special Operations Executive. Mycroft is the shadow head of both in this story, but his brother is SOE.  IRL, the SOE's nickname was
“I didn’t think you were planning on taking them on yourself.”
“No - I said I understand if it’s the job.”
John Watson emerges from his bedroom looking dazed. “Sherlock, it's past midnight, I thought you were sleeping - what are you on about?”
John begins the slow journey back to health in England. Sherlock must face his demons.
John sighs, but gets into the car.
“Who in hell…”, John splutters.
“Don’t be ridiculous - I am uninterested in the catalog of profanity and whinging we would be forced to endure if you actually spent the night on the sofa. Sleep in my bed, John.”
“Perhaps you experienced an urgent need to dance the Fox Trot?”
“I DID!” John pauses, “And I thought I saw proof of his...regard for me. But I also remember your brother telling me ‘no matter where you are, I will find you’...and that promise came to nothing. Even if he couldn’t find me through his...your resources - I wrote to him - what I could write, given the censors,” John pulls himself upright, a squared-off, military posture, “He never replied, not even when...Never.”
“Mycroft.” Breaking eye contact, Alessandre settles back into her seat, watching the English countryside pass in the undulating fog.
Corporal Harrow responds with alacrity, closing the door and standing close to Mycroft’s desk, “Priory - SH dosed, 2H - 1 repeat’..that is all that it says, Sir.”
“Who do you think would take her?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“No,” Mycroft offers no additional explanation.
Cheers!
“Only until I resolve the leak, with your assistance, of course - and can find suitable accommodation for Professor Scott.”
Jim Moriarty hears the line cut off. He looks in the mirror, smoothing his bespoke Vivienne Westwood suit. Alessandre’s here - and that can only mean one thing. It’s finally show time.
“So!  Personnel files for all our possible canaries - restrict the first pass to those with direct access to the planning - either by virtue of their employer or by office geography - someone who would regularly back up Admiral Cunningham’s secretary, for example.”
“I fail to understand how you let him go. This required delicacy, Sherlock,
The flat is half in boxes. John looks around and Mycroft registers his surprise.
“Brother mine, you had your quarry in abeyance, and yet James Moriarty walks the streets of London tonight. Did something pressing come up? A particularly difficult passage in Major Miller’s scoring?”
Anthea is carrying a garment bag in one hand her mobile in the other.
“No, it really couldn’t.”
They enter what appears to be a servant’s kitchen. A thick coating of dust and grime reveals the house to be long-abandoned. They are still close to the water - but the dirty windows do not admit much daylight; Sherlock tries to make out a bit more of his surroundings when he is thrown haphazardly into a straight-backed chair and a flour-sack covers his head.
“Netley? That’s where you’ve been keeping him?” Sherlock stands, gathering his coat.
“Where shall I drop you?”
“So - not a code breaker?”
Jim Moriarty leans by the door of the American Red Cross club - he’s glad to be back in England, even if he must pretend to be a US soldier to do so. The American enthusiasm for the war meant the sheer number of GI’s has staggered all efforts to maintain control over them. SHAEF was pouring men and supplies into England - it was clear that something was coming, and soon. Perhaps this extracurricular intelligence gathering would be unnecessary, but Mycroft Holmes was a powerful man, and if Moriarty was certain of Nazi victory, he was also the sort of man who made contingency plans. Mycroft himself was unassailable, but Jim knows how to traffic in people - and Mycroft’s brother could be the pressure point that brings Mycroft to heel.
If a breeze caresses me
Watson gets an offer from Helen, then makes a trip to Montague Street.
“No,..,”Sherlock shifts through piles of papers, “...this cannot be.”
“What are your intentions towards Sherlock Holmes?”
“No. Why did he want to go?”
“It’ll take a sight more than a general lack of Germans to convince me to holiday seaside.” Corporal Murray says, with such serious earnestness that John has to smile a little. That smile trickles away like the cold sea water that washes over the bow of the landing craft. Within a mile of shore, the operation goes pear-shaped. One of the LCA is hit directly - or maybe hits a mine - John cannot tell - in the end, only four men can be rescued. When his LCA reaches the shore the gates lower, and the men disembark. As the coxswain goes over the side, one of the marines turns to Watson with the cheery, fatalistic smile of a true Commando -  saying “Perhaps we’re intruding - this seems like a private beach.”
“SHERlock. Not relevant. Professor?”
“Sherlock’s deductions. That's the bit he got wrong - you aren't a code breaker. Then why is the British Government so
“No, no, no..I don’t want to stop”, Sherlock yanks John back roughly, biting at his mouth.
We have entered the History Channel portion of the programme - just a little - Operation Fortitude was a real thing, and did get 'spiced up' in the way the story suggests (though, obviously, not by a Holmes, but rather by Gen. Strangeways).
“Miss Adler, isn’t it? I don’t know what he holds over you - though I have my suspicions - you don’t have to do this.”
“Irene…”, there is a terrifying, mad glint to Moriarty’s eyes as he paces towards her - his fingers flex.
“Does the clinic in Switzerland know you’ve left?”
John passes through the oak-panelled hallways over silent oriental carpets until they arrive at a massive door. Mycroft produces a key, and locks them all inside, “Wilder, Brandy - I think - for everyone, then you may retire until we have need of you.”
“Let’s embroider upon Operation Fortitude South - create a new American army group, and - to complete the deception - throw in ‘lead by General Patton’ - give Rommel nightmares - then he will believe the target is Pas de Calais. Falsify the plans - in the Admiralty’s copies - make sure they look like they are for Operation Overlord and for God’s sake, make sure Wren Morstan gets them. Then - we can arrange something that isn’t suspect. Illness - food poisoning - anything to take her out of the Admiralty.”
“What progress has been made?”
“Bullshit, James...Do you really think so poorly of me, that your scars would put me off? And if you have your scars, well - so do I,” John grasps the Major’s hand.
” Sherlock pushes the door closed and slips the bolt. He slides John’s peaked cap off and knocks his own brimmed hat back to kiss John without impediment.
Sherlock rounds on the agent, “Who is covering for Janine?”
Dr. Scott comes down from John’s room, dressed in severely tailored dark jeans, a fitted long-sleeved, v-necked t-shirt, French blue, a scarf and a blazer. John and Mycroft both give her a comprehensive look, Sherlock looks bored.
“Sherlock, Dr. Scott is missing. She went to the restroom, security footage cuts out for fifteen minutes, CCTV, everything. A staff door onto Montague Street was found propped.”
I can just imagine him growing more and more outraged while reading TBB post, writing and angry comment, going back to ASIP post to see what else John wrote about their cases and just losing it.
Mycroft waved solemnly at the crowd, which erupted in ovation.
Please stay safe and enjoy my little contribution to making quarantine a bit more bearable. A big thank you to my lovely beta, CamillaCarmine!
“I 'ave a new batch for you. Some prime stuff.” He kneeled and dug his hand deep in the grimy bag at his feet, searching inside.
“Oh, ok,” John’s voice was a study in disinterest, “And where does he live?”
he announced to the mountains.
that says that Sherlock is purposefully winding up John and cutting him off from cases to get him frustrated enough to make some sort of move. He is making the adrenaline junkie go through a dry spell after giving him a taste on excitement on ASIB. He eventually aquiesces to taking John to see Sebastian, probably because he wants to show Seb that he has a
“The honour is ours, your Majesty,” the Prime Minister replied. “Allow me to introduce Minister Donovan and Ambassador Anderson.” He stepped aside to allow his companions to approach the stage and bow silently in turn
“Don’t bother, thanks,” Sherlock interrupted, “my hands are still working.” He snatched the suit from one of the dumfounded footmen and slammed the door in their faces.
There was utter silence as Harry flew over the abyss. Sherlock closed his eyes and hid his face on the reindeer’s neck in preparation for the inevitable impact. The moment seemed to stretch forever as they fell, and Sherlock spared a thought for Jim - wondering if he would ever be able to find his mangled body and discern his remains from those of the reindeer. Unless he decided to add a bit of both bodies to the urn. His skeleton would look impressive in reindeer antlers...
“Oh, bugger off,” Sherlock countered distractedly, his attention already engaged in the pages before him.
You'll notice that it's not a constant thing. Sherlock finds it really annoying to have a speech impediment so he has been working very hard to improve it. Also it makes his lines easier to read if it's not a very serious thing :P
- Sherlock shows Baker Street to John, the rest of the ASIP episode happens on the same day.
This is one of those instances where it really pays out to read John’s blog. Besides reading this delightfully domestic exchange, you are gifted with the information that our boys actually did a Bond movie night.
“Yeah, like what?” Billy challenged.
“A pickpocket!” the prince explained to the dumbfounded man, “I just saw him stealing from a man by the fishmonger’s stand! It’s the second, maybe third time he’s done it, as far as I can see.”
“I can’t ask for an ice harvester to grasp the concept of serious matters of state,” he stated clinically. “The fate of the Kingdom is lying in the balance and you’re worried about
(See the end of the chapter for
- On the same note, the name Éiren Isles comes from the name Éire, the Irish for Ireland. Moriarty is Irish in canon, so...
“This is not ‘bored’, Father!” Mycroft turned around to face his parents when a jet of ice sprang from his fingers, hitting the corner of the bedroom with a thud. The wall and part of the carpet were instantly frozen.
At the same time, Prime Minister Lestrade stepped away from the crowd and approached him in a hurried step, flanked by Minister Donovan and that insufferable Anderson.
“Yes, your Highness,” the Captain saluted as Mycroft left the room without further comment.
Sherlock cursed inwardly at his own awkwardness. He had had no intention of making his new friend feel inadequate. “No, it’s alright. I have a strange sense of humour myself,” he tried to explain.
“We were playing, but then Sherlock fell, and I tried to save him, and I hit him with the magic instead - but it was an accident!” he explained in a rush, transferring his brother into his mother’s arms. “He won’t wake up!”
Harry, the traitor, stood up and stretched languidly before trotting after Bill into the kitchen. John, now divested of blankets and pillow, resigned himself to his fate. He stood up from his cot, put on his shoes and blearily made his way into the next room.
“Hurray for me,” Sherlock grumbled.
The famous blog, finally!
“Prince Sherlock?”
Sherlock furrowed his brow at the guard. “Aren’t you supposed to defend the Law and Order or some such? I thought that was what guards were for...”
Bill looked pensive for a moment before he answered “No, it’s just a way of saying, like a…” he trailed off.
“I remember that case...Found dead at his desk, signs of... strangling!” Sherlock recited, “all doors and windows locked from the inside.”
If you don’t know that one,
commenting for the first time, but I’ll give them their own section.
Sherlock shrugged, trying to look bored. “Needs must. And who’s organizing it?”
“That was the most ridiculous thing... I’ve ever done…” Sherlock wheezed.
“Well, he is the prince heir, he needs to learn how to rule the Kingdom.” She stood up from her chair and put away Sherlock’s towel and slippers. “Good news is, you’ll have breakfast with your lady mother today.”
“Londondalle is in grave peril and I am the only capable of saving it,” Sherlock answered, slowly raising his eyes to lock with John’s accusing gaze. “I couldn’t lose any time sitting around planning a lovely little field trip.”
The Queen broke the silence when they approached the town’s edge. “How are we going to melt the magic?” she asked. “Where are we going?”
“How are you feeling today?”
Sherlock tried to do a twirl and landed on his rear. “Mrs Turner didn’t like that, did
Jim scanned Sherlock’s eager face, as if trying to find any trace of dishonesty. After a few moments of silence, his eyes lit up again. “That’s good to know…" he said, suddenly shy. "Mind keeping me company for a bit? You’re the only interesting person I’ve talked to all evening.”
John snored.
He took a last wistful look at his father’s portrait and walked towards the door.
Up on the wooden balcony of the Londondalle Church, the small choir broke into song once again.
His mother put down her silverware as well. “You will still sleep in the nursery, and Mrs Turner will still be there with you,” she looked pleadingly at the nanny, sitting to Sherlock’s right. Mrs Turner kept her hands folded on her lap and pursed her thin lips tighter.
“I’m sorry! Oh, I’m so sorry!” a male voice replied. He let Sherlock go as soon as they reached the boardwalk “Are you ok?” it asked shyly.
, the Mind Palace sequence in HLV tells us that Redbeard was put down for some reason. We can argue further that it happened during his childhood. (In the same MP sequence we see little!Sherlock calling for Redbeard; the dialogue in TSoT
John stopped in his tracks and looked back at the shopkeeper. “Well, I did come in for a length of rope...” John began.
“That!” Bill exclaimed. “It means you don’t have any warm feelings towards nobody. You’re just angry and don’t care what happens to other people.”
“You need to wake up,” the five-year-old insisted. Mycroft could have sworn he heard a naked foot stomping on the carpet.
The young prince’s heart grew as he took a breath of fresh air, delighted at his discovery. A new window into the world had been opened for him!
Jim paid no mind to Sherlock’s reproachful tone and prompted him with another line.
“Hm,” Sherlock mumbled.
“There is great beauty in your magic. But also great danger.” The icy swirls suddenly grew sharp points that struck the crowd, freezing the ones they pierced. The people that remained turned on the young man and attacked him. Mycroft screamed in terror and hid his face in his father’s cloak. The images disappeared into the air.
John hadn’t always been the smooth lady’s man we know today (curious and curiouser).
ip!” he pointed his hand at the frozen floor.
John mulled this information for a moment before continuing, “But the coronation… Wasn’t that today?”
Mycroft felt his heartbeat pounding in his ears as he pushed open the Palace’s doors. His arms trembled with the effort and his mind buzzed with a thousand different thoughts.
es!” Sherlock had recently discovered the concept of property ownership and now incorporated it into every playtime.
Sherlock ignored Jim’s praises and turned his attention back on the crowded ballroom. He wouldn’t find any criminals if everyone insisted on being dull.
“Fear will be your enemy. You must learn to control your powers.” the Grand Stamford warned the prince.
“No!” Sherlock giggled. “
John held Sherlock’s steely gaze for another second before shaking his head.
She nodded and left quietly, the King close behind her.
The men and the horses made their way slowly onto the frozen lake, adapting their stance with the ease that comes from many years of working on icy terrain. John and Harry were allowed to ride on the ice cart on the way to the lake, but would have to make it back on their own, when the cart would be filled with ice blocks and the horses would struggle with the weight.
Like I mentioned in
We don’t know if there are more matches between the two posts. The last line of the paragraph marked in blue and the next paragraph visible are different. But we are clearly meant to notice the first pink paragraph, the one that Mary reads out loud.
Halfway across the town square, she bumped into a man walking in the opposite direction. He raised his hand in apology and continued his way. But the way his other hand moved caught Sherlock’s attention.
Sherlock chuckled for a second before coming to his senses and grabbing John by the shoulder “- wait, no!”
The usual people comment on
” Sherlock nodded and stepped carefully away from the column. His heartbeat hammered in his ears as he slowly made his way towards the vase. From the corner of his eye he saw Jim sneaking towards the opposite side of the hallway to hide behind another column.
The ice harvesters didn’t waste time in getting to work. The days were getting shorter as winter approached, and every minute counted before it became too dark to navigate the frozen expanse of the lake.
A respectful silence settled in before the man’s clear voice rang through the Ballroom. “King Mycroft of Londondalle!” he declared.
Sherlock continued his soliloquy. “Can’t you
Mycroft made a show of sorting through the documents on his desk. “Yes. I can’t imagine the Gaulian Prime Minister will refuse his invitation after we’ve brought the culprit to justice.”
“How… How do you stop hearts from doing that?” John asked hurriedly as everyone reached for their tools to resume their work.
Sherlock felt a jolt of annoyance at the insufficient feedback. “Because I can make a difference! I know I can!” he argued, gesturing wildly. “Because my mind is rotting away behind these walls! It needs to work, I need to work! I’ll die if I don’t!”
“Oh- My brother’s cape. He wore it to the coronation with my mother’s sapphire pin - that’s probably what scraped you,” Sherlock explained
From his vantage point he could see how the narrow path opened into a small clearing, surrounded by a wall of dark stone. The ground was covered by a thick mantle of deep green moss interspaced by cracks that spewed a steady flow of steam into the air.
The body John’s referring to is Eddie Van Coon, the first death in TBB. After finding the banker dead at his flat and going back to talk to Sebastian, the boys go back home and John types this first post and the next one a few minutes later. Because the time stamps on both entries overlap, I’ve given them their own section.
He spread the blanket over the haystack closest to Harry and laid down against it with a huff. After a few moments of tuning the lute, John began to pluck absent-mindedly at the strings, letting his mind wander. The simple, metallic sounds filled the small stable with a gentle melody while the wind continued to rage and moan outside.
But let me push this a little bit further (
John suddenly slammed his hands on the armrests and stood up from his seat.
He heard his father exasperated sigh somewhere near the door. “We’ll only be gone for two weeks, Sherlock. Besides, you’ll still have Mycroft with you.”
“We’ve just foiled an assassination attempt against the Suomic Ambassador!” A shocked gasp traveled around the crowd, and Sherlock puffed out his chest, reveling in the sound. “Here’s the criminal,” he declared, giving his prisoner a shove. Still stunned, the man fell to his knees, struggling to keep his head upright as he looked up at Mycroft.
His gruesome musings were suddenly interrupted when Harry fell into a thick blanket of snow, throwing the prince a few yards ahead of where she fell, stunned but unharmed.
Apparently satisfied with the state of his sleeves, he turned to his brother with a put-upon sigh. “Protocol determines that we host a Coronation Ball in the Palace after the deed is done,” he continued, “and I suppose the people will want a parade or something to that extent... I would much rather just skip the whole thing but tradition dictates otherwise.”
“Sherlock!” Mycroft threw his hands forward to produce a snow bank under his brother. But in his rush he missed his mark and the white magic blast hit Sherlock, knocking him unconscious before he met the floor with a terrible thud.
Unsure what to do, Sherlock sat carefully beside his new friend, who was stretching his limbs with gusto. In front of them, the moonlit ocean spread out into the horizon, bracketed by the dark cliffs of the Londondalle bay. The gentle breeze carried a hint of salty air and Sherlock filled his lungs with it, his worries temporarily forgotten.
Piqued by John’s dismissal, the prince decided to take matters into his own hands. He pushed himself onto his knees and gathered the snow still littering the inside of the sledge to make snowballs, which he proceeded to throw at the approaching wolves with surprising accuracy. But the snow soon ran out and Sherlock was forced to reach for John’s bags to throw whatever he could find inside.
Sherlock sang the same melody he had been singing since he was five-years-old.
He drew a shaky breath, trying to keep the tears from spilling over. The lonely prince turned and sat himself against the door. There was no point in being anywhere else, he realized.
“Mine and Redbeard’s! I’m the great pirate Yellowbeard and I will
As he made his way through the Palace’s West wing, Sherlock couldn’t help but marvel at how different it had become. Everywhere he turned there were maids hurrying along with dusters and brooms, pushing back heavy curtains and opening long closed shutters. Dust motes danced in the light, upset from their rest by the maids’ efforts. All the Palace vibrated with nervous energy while people ran back and forth, preparing for the celebrations.
Trying to calm his racing heart, Mycroft raised his chin in a semblance of confidence and walked down the staircase and into the crowd. But instead of making way for their king, the people stepped in front of him, trying to strike a conversation.
“I need this solved, quickly and quietly. You know this case, I’m simply giving you the evidence you didn’t have before,” Mycroft pointed a white gloved finger at the documents in his brother’s hands.
Feel hundreds of eyes staring at him, Mycroft slowly took off his gloves, placing them carefully besides the Royal Orb and Scepter. His shaking hands hovered over the objects for a second before he grab them and turned around quickly to face the assembly.
“I don’t mind, I’m used to it,” Jim reassured him with a gentle smile, “I was born fifteen years after my sister - an accident, so to speak. My mother was too old and tired to put any effort into raising me and my siblings were too busy to pay me any mind, so I grew up mostly by myself.” Jim’s warm gaze became distant as he recounted his story. “My journeys have given me a purpose, but I’ve always wished for something more…” He shook his head as he snapped out of his reverie. “Sorry, I’m probably boring you to death with my depressing story.”
"No. I pushed Mycroft away, I should be the one to bring him back. I need you here to take care of Londondalle while I’m gone. Alright?" he asked quietly.
Sherlock suppressed a shiver as the cold autumn wind whistled between the naked trees. He tried to ignore the sound of the waves crashing forcefully against the bottom of the cliff and concentrated on the proceedings before him. Every now and again he would notice a pitying look directed at him and he would stare down his concerned subject until they would look away.
Sherlock shushed him, clicked his tongue, but none of the soft noises seemed to penetrate the wall of sound his bedmate was producing.
As he sang, Sherlock pulled a nearby curtain across his shoulders with a flourish. The heavy red velvet sat like an overgrown scarf around his neck, leaving only his eyes visible over the folds of fabric.
, now.
“You don’t tell her what to do,” the ice harvester said, brandishing a camp knife. "Get ready to jump, Harry!”
They sang together in a complex harmony.
Sherlock would have spared a thought about the excellence of their performance were he not so deeply preoccupied in scanning the attending crowd. From his place of honour, standing a small way off to the side of the altar, the prince kept a watchful eye on the rows of guests that filled the modest church. He adjusted his stance and let a nervous sigh. Over two hours had passed since the beginning of the day’s ceremonies, and still there were no crimes to solve. No murders, no abductions, not even a simple robbery! Everyone just sat there, nice and content in their finest dress and jewelry, oblivious to his needs.
“Well, let me tell you what I can grasp-!” he countered, baring his teeth.
The woman from the flower stand (Mrs Murphy, he had named her) was a three-time widower, with a cat allergy. She was currently trying to convince her eldest daughter to marry the grocer across the square, but the girl was actually in love with one of the fishermen in the docks. Mrs Murphy had a difficult relationship with the baker’s wife, Mrs Young, who came in every day to buy yellow roses. Sherlock could see her now, walking briskly through the morning crowd towards the flower stand.
"You're welcome!" John added sarcastically and was answered only by a grunt and a crunching sound. Feeling strangely annoyed, John opened his own bag to extract a thick blanket and an old, battered lute, carefully wrapped in a cotton cloth.
. He thought.
John seemed to mull the information before adding, “Why would you think he’s up there?”
They had a couple of pints with their dinner and finished it off with a tumbler of passable whiskey. As they walked back to the inn, John was already yawning loudly and Sherlock had to admit he could feel the pull of sleep after a satiating meal. But he mustn’t succumb to the temptation! He had to make the most of this priceless opportunity to advance his study.
“Begging your pardon, sir, but you’re the prince, aren’t you?” the man asked.
“He’s fine,” his father interrupted with forced casualness. “Don’t worry about him. You know how bored he gets, sometimes.”
Behold the comments on the blogpost about his meeting with Sherlock on the 29th of January.
Sherlock met his flatmate at the top of the stairs and took his duffle bag from him. “There seems to be a misunderstanding,” he explained, “I asked for a room with two beds...”
“I’ve rested enough. There’s no time to lose, get up,” the prince countered, unfazed.
“It’s alright, Harry,” he assured his friend, “It’s a pretty song, isn’t it?” He asked, scratching the reindeer under her chin. Harry closed her eyes and stretched her neck with pleasure.
Mycroft seemed to ignore the slight bitterness of Sherlock’s tone and kept his contented gaze on the dancing guests. “I did,” he replied.
Sherlock was the first to speak. “I, uh, I’m sorry about your sledge. I’ll replace it and everything that was in it.”
“You were half asleep, no wonder you don’t remember.” Mrs Turner opened the bathroom door and pushed him in.
A knock was heard from the door and Mycroft turned around with a start.
Sherlock smile turned into a shameless grin. “Up here!” he shouted.
If I remember correctly, the post was much like what we see now, but it ended with John mentioning that they had hit a snag in their investigation and that the mysterious bomber seemed to have gone underground. He ends saying that since things were quiet for the moment, he was going to visit his girlfriend Sarah that evening. There were one or two comments by Sarah and Harry worriedly looking for John, who didn’t arrive at Sarah’s and wasn’t answering his phone.
The wind howled between the tree branches, making the falling snow cling to his eyelashes and bury in his hair. Shivering, the prince tried to wrap the woolen cloak tighter around his face and neck only to expose his legs to the biting cold. He let out a long sigh that condensed around the wool, making it uncomfortably damp.
(See the end of the chapter for
You may have noticed something familiar with the first few paragraphs. I tried to play a bit with the story-telling and gave the three main characters the same waking sequence.
Harry, provided with twice the number of legs as John, had no trouble navigating the slippery rocks. John had to grab her by the hair on her neck to keep her from charging forward into the unknown.
Mycroft took advantage of the distraction to escape through the crowd, who now did their best to step out of his way.
The Grand Stamford understood his question and shook his head sadly. “I’m sorry, your Highness. But this magic is as part of you as the blood in your veins and the marrow in your bones.”
In an ultimate act of division, Mycroft stomped his foot down and from under it a gigantic snowflake was formed, slowly spreading its branches across the snow.
Heart racing, Sherlock carefully braced his hands on the mattress and tried to quietly shift back to his side of the bed, but John's arms only tightened in response. After a few failed tries to escape, the detective admitted defeat.
Oh, this bit is so meta. We can almost hear the higher powers, all the critics and all the experts, speaking through that fortune. “It’s all been done before”, this formula has been done and repeated, this will be nothing new. John, our author, begs to differ.
Sherlock slumped his shoulders, defeated.
Sherlock took a moment before powering through the rest of the story in the hopes that John wouldn’t notice his blunder if he overwhelmed him with all the details. “Well, it turned out that the assassin wasn’t really an assassin, but one of my brother’s spies - but the point still stands. Mycroft had a tantrum and refused to give me his blessing, so I told him I was going to leave the palace to live with Jim. He liked that even less, so tempers rose, there was some shouting and he released his ice powers, which was shocking for everyone, including him, I think-”
Sherlock felt his heart thump happily in his chest as the guards pulled the man to his feet.
“I knew there was something strange going on! Sorcery!” Anderson persisted, sweat beading on his forehead. "Evil sorcery!"
