Sherlock smiled to himself. ‘The original Banksy. The first one. The one who gives almost all proceeds of the sales to various charitable organisations. It is the Banksy name that gives the art its value: nothing else. A further political statement on the ludicrous nature of capitalism. Economics, at least as it stands now, is a day dream. Money only exists because we all believe it does.’
'Because it was part of the arrangement. Because she was to leave and never return. I did this for
She couldn’t say that of her boys. Oh, she had no doubt that sex was part of it. She heard them now again: deep, quiet moans and curses of encouragement, but it was not some quick, casual fling.
He had requested distance while simultaneously asking for help, and Sherlock could not bring himself to believe that one desire was true while the other was not. In all honesty, he suspected John wanted both. He pulled Sherlock close while pushing him away. He cried out for help while begrudging those who tried to offer assistance.
A freezing blue hand grasped John’s wrist as he pulled away from the body. John’s gaze snapped to the prince’s face, where it was met with terrified grey eyes.
The prince discovered that John had an intense love for strawberries (which grew natively in London and Northumberland but had been imported from somewhere in the Americas due to the winter weather). He’d used to pick them in the summer with his sister and eat until his belly was full and his face and fingers were stained red and sticky with strawberry juice.
“John! John, help me!”
“Direct attack won’t work,” John said, frowning at the model in front of him. “You’re leaving our flanks open to his forces.”
The King narrowed his eyes. “Why would-”
Magic cannot predict the future. It can only put its faith in its humans, and it knows it has chosen well.
Sherlock frowned, and Soo Lin continued, her voice stern and her face serious.
not me.”
The next time Mycroft showed up, Sherlock thought he would give him a message to Ford, just to say hello. Until then, the prince would wait.
“Is that how you met him?”
Siger watched, his heart full, as their less than tactile son welcomed his mother’s frantic touches. She petted his hair and stroked his cheeks and gripped his shoulders, all the while nagging him like any mother would do in the presence of their eldest child.
John tore himself from the body, horrified, and woke up in the woods, breathing like he'd just outrun a hare.
Heat rose to Sherlock’s angular face, and his cheeks turned a dusty pink. John’s smile grew
John nodded and smiled stiffly. “Yeah,” he said. “I’ll definitely do that soon.”
Sherlock’s fingers slowly traced the new scars on John’s cheeks.
be better to listen to Sherlock (just this once), huffing discontentedly and leaving John and Sherlock there, staring stupidly at each other.
John stiffened, breaking the kiss and swallowing hard. He breathed raggedly, leaning back against the wall. Sherlock backed away from his as if he were on fire.
Please leave a comment if you liked it, hated it, or have any suggestions. It helps keep me motivated!! :)
“And Sherrinford?” Siger prompted.
"Oh, that. No, I hadn't predicted that."
Sherlock noted happily. It was a bittersweet thought.
“I’m sorry, Sarah, but can we please
“Your Highness,” John greeted, standing abruptly to meet the Queen. He was suddenly very aware of his unflattering bedclothes and stubbly jaw.
John shook his head and turned back to the little boy.
It was all fine, John reasoned. Sherlock could proposition anyone he liked. Maybe then John could get a night's rest without the prince latching onto him like a starving parasite.
Mike grinned. “That’s perfect!” he exclaimed. “There’s so much to catch up on, though. We’ll have to talk when there’s more time!”
“My father?”
When he was eight years old, Sherlock had dreamt that monstrous beasts had invaded the castle, and he had woken up sweating, panting, and scared. He did the same thing now as he'd done then.
“You can’t possibly want to do this,” Sherlock gestures vaguely backwards, “with me.”
John barks out an unnatural laugh, purses his lips in that way that means he’s deeply upset. He moves to the couch robotically, sits down and stares at the fireplace. Sherlock follows him subconsciously, hovering a few feet in front of him. “I’m— so. I’m so sorry, Sherlock,”
They kiss there, in the pale light of the kitchen and when Sherlock leans back his eyes are gentle, warm.  John smoothes his hands through soft hair. “I won’t ever stop, Sherlock. Hell, I don’t even think I can. I love
, you are
~ • ~
Oh, love,” And then they’re tangled together, Sherlock’s head under John’s chin, John’s arms tightly wound around Sherlock’s waist. “I should have never— I didn’t. . .  I missed you. So. Much. And, I didn’t know how to cope with what I was feeling— hell, I don’t think I even knew
A small quirk at the corner of his lips, and his head ducks sheepishly for a moment. “Yes. Well. First time for everything.”
“I’ve hurt you many times, John. Dying, coming back, lying and cheating. I’m crude and insensitive and sharp and you. I don’t know how you could be with me.”
That gives the blonde man pause, and he tentatively nods. “Yes, you have.”
Mycroft simply sighs again. “John— ”
John stumbles into the flat a few nights later, worn and dead on his feet, only managing to mumble a quick, “Sherlock,” before he climbs up the stairs and collapses on the bed.
Sherlock’s mouth pulls up in a smirk this time. “Pity.”
He texts Lestrade.
” He can feel that he’s physically trembling.
Sherlock bites his lip, looks away to stare at the ice crystals on the window pane. John’s fingers gently guide his face so that they’re steadily gazing at each other, lips tight in a worried smile.
Sherlock shrugs, meets his eyes, then crosses his legs in the chair and folds his arms across his chest. “Can’t.”
“Where are
John grits his teeth, stares him down. “If I so recall, every time you’ve
A minute shake of his head, and the hand stops. “You. . .  but you came. . . to the restaurant,”
John violently shakes his head, “No. No, Sherlock, I can’t— come here,” Warm hands circle thin wrists and Sherlock is pulled into the V of John’s legs. “I’ve hurt you too much already.”
John’s finding that he rolls his eyes far too often these days. “Well, yes, but. It’s like a switch was flipped in him. After. . .” Clears his throat, tries again. “After the fall. He seems. . .  wistful, almost.”
“Are we sleeping now?” He asks, and his voice is low and scratchy, and
does not want to discuss this issue with Sherlock’s overbearing older brother. “Most recently, I asked him about my wedding. Why he— why he left early.”
Sherlock can’t speak, couldn’t if he wanted to given the lump in his throat, so he nods.
It seems that with that confession, John can’t seem to stop himself from saying it. “I love you. I love you so much, and I’m so sorry I never told you—”
That night, they order a takeout and watch the telly. Sherlock makes deductions about the people on the reality TV show John has gotten hooked on, and John shushes him with a gentle kick to the side. If he didn’t know any better, he’d say he saw two blooming spots of pink on Sherlock’s cheekbones.
There’s a small trickle of something golden and delicious in John’s chest as he looks up at his detective — his hair is strewn with sleep (god
It’s almost startling how easily they fall back into their normal routine. Their constant rows, the messes in the kitchen, the way they fly through the streets of London, adrenaline coursing through their veins like a drug — and
) He huffs, unbuttons his shirt, peels it off his body. The wound isn’t horribly deep, but it’s long and jagged.
It isn’t perfect— not yet, at least; but they’re okay.
John pinches at his nose, finding that he most
John closes his eyes, clears his throat, attempts to speak steadily. “Hmm. No, uh, it’s Thursday, Sherlock. When was the last time you slept? Or ate?”
Mycroft fixes him with a level stare. “What brought upon this concern as of late, John?”
But today is normal. John pads into the kitchen, bleary-eyed and in the mood for a strong cup of tea. He half expects the table to be strewn with various experiments and severed limbs — he prepares himself to be angry, even though he knows he won’t even be for that long. he never can be with Sherlock — and is quite frankly, surprised, to see Sherlock sitting there, holding out a steaming mug with one hand, sipping thoughtfully from the other.
“Sherlock, breathe. It’s okay. Shh, you’re okay.” Slowly, Sherlock turns around to face him, avoiding his searching gaze.
“Come to my senses?” He asks.
He decides to blame it on the rosy light of the TV and the flickering heat from the fireplace. (He doesn’t move his foot.)
Instead, he sighs, pulls a hand down his face. “I always told my brother it was useless to involve himself in the workings of society.”
Only then does Sherlock meet John’s eye, give him a tight smile and say, “Air.”
A fierce pang resonates in John’s chest and he scoots closer, moves his hand to cradle Sherlock’s jaw. “I love you.”
“You see, when most people need air, they step out for a little bit to breathe. They don’t leave entirely then cut off all contact for a month,” The words taste bitter in John’s mouth and he takes a sip of his tea to swallow around them.
Sherlock has too, he notices; in the way he secretly smiles to himself when he doesn’t think John is looking. (John’s always looking.)
~ • ~
His back tingles. Good
“This smells like you.” Sherlock sounds confused, worrying the soft fabric between his fingers.
~ • ~
Sherlock stopped listening to John’s words after, “to fall in love.” His head feels foggy and he shakes it to clear his thoughts. “What didn’t you get to tell me?” (He’s genuinely confused, what does John mean when he says that—)
The coat billows behind him as he strides down the stairs, the firm closing of the door behind him reverberating throughout the sitting room.
He thinks he hears a mumbled, “Mine,” into his shoulder and John is over the moon. It’s comfortable like this; cozy and warm, and the thought grips John without warning that this is the exact place where he belongs: cuddling his sleepy detective in their (their!) bed.
“Tea. You made tea.”
The question hits John one day while they’re in the sitting room. Sherlock’s on his phone, curled up in his chair, and John’s reading a sappy novel that Mrs. Hudson had recommended.
“God, coming in from outside into here makes the flat feel even warmer,” he briefly registers John’s voice from the kitchen, deciding to ignore him and instead, crack open the window. Sherlock’s skin tingles delightfully at the rush of cool air.
John stands, sweeping his coat off his chair into his arms. “No, Mycroft. I’m worried about him— thought you were too, but if you’ve just shuttled me up here for a laugh, I think I’d rather go home.” With that, he nods, mostly to himself, and walks briskly out of the room.
“As much as I’m enjoying this, love, you need to sleep. It’s been, what? Three days?”
“Minor casualties.” John whispers behind him, and suddenly there’s a hand at his nape. “May I?”
A hot wave of shame rolls through him and he stutters a breath at the impact.
“Sherlock.” Steady, feigned calm, underlying anger. “What. Are those?”
“That’s not a normal reaction! To— to attack you like that? To beat you and leave you and not. . .  not think about what had happened? To you?”
“Why wouldn’t I want to do this?”
“Not this time, I’m afraid,”
“Sherlock.” John wants the answer this time, wants to get to the bottom of Sherlock’s strange behavior.
There’s not anything that’s prompted the question either; John figures that it’s just something that had been at the back of this mind until now.
Instead of pulling away instantly and yelling, Sherlock sinks back into John. Small hands come to rest on raised sides and he leaves a trail of kisses amongst the wreckage.
“But I. . .  you. . . I hurt you, that night,” John’s arms fall to his sides as the information sinks in. Sherlock steps away, locks the window. He feels cold, brittle. “Why did you let me hit you, Sherlock? You were— you were—”
“The two years I was. . .  gone, I took down Moriarty’s network, as much of it as I could manage.” He shrugs, feigning indifference, yet clenching his jaw against tears. “Minor casualties.”
John walks to the kitchen, heats the kettle, pulls two mugs from the cupboard. When he turns back around, Sherlock is perched on the dining table.
“Uh— he avoids conversation, seems to flinch more when I’m around him—” He cuts off abruptly at the look on Mycroft’s face of concealed amusement. “Is it just me or are you finding pleasure in this?”
He gets a nod more than anything, but it seems cautious, slightly resigned, so he curls an arm around a thin waist and pets at the downy curls under his chin. After a second, he flicks the light off on the bedside table and sinks into the mattress. Sherlock sinks in with him.
He hears a sharp breath from behind him, followed by a shuddering exhale. He glances over his shoulder in concern; Sherlock’s eyes are closed, his fingertips pressed to his temple, and he’s completely still. John’s eyes dance over the man’s form before he sighs and picks up the paper.
“Okay, I’m going to take a shower— lord, it’s been two days, hasn’t it? Ugh, yes, definitely shower. You can’t take a shower because you’ll mess up your dressing, so,” he turns to his dresser, pulls out a large shirt and tosses it in Sherlock’s general direction, “get dressed.”
“Yep.” He pops the ‘p’.
“No. He avoided the subject entirely.”
Sherlock thinks,
“Yes, love, that was the plan.” Sherlock blinks in what John can only categorize as surprise. “Get dressed.”
Sherlock stands up then, pulling his robe tighter around him. “Would you like to get breakfast?”
It’s dreadfully hot in the flat, despite it being the middle of January. The radiator has been broken in 221B for almost two days; no one’s been able to come out to fix it due to the copious amounts of snow on the road. So, the three of them have just been forced to. . .  burn, essentially. In winter.
“Oh, love,”
“Because you needed to.”
“Out.” He’s facing the mirror now, fluffing his —thick, soft, bouncy,
being the best man at my wedding. Try again.”
“I’ve hurt you too, John,” He murmurs.
“How long after these were healed did you come back to London?”
~ • ~
“Why? Why did you. . . ?”
“Hmm.” Mycroft’s mouth curls into a strange smile. “Did he tell you?”
“You know, once in a while, you could help me put away the. . .” John trails off, and he’s closer now, in the sitting room. Sherlock turns to respond to him; the words die away fast at the look on the shorter man’s face.
raised stab wound on the fleshy part of his side. There’s a blackened bruise from where a gun wound was almost fatally infected, and Sherlock’s — attempt at — steady breathing falters.
“Hmm?”
Sherlock can’t form the words he wants to say, so he just stands in silence.
he wants to kiss him.
And, oh, is he ready for their new normal.
John smiles to himself as he walks into the bathroom.
There’s a smile after that, a bright, beaming smile kissing his own, and it’s not perfect, but it’s the best thing Sherlock’s ever experienced in his entire life.
When John works and he doesn’t have a case, Sherlock usually takes Rosie somewhere; goes about his day with her little fingers clutched in his hair. But she’s downstairs with Mrs. Hudson (who’s radiator isn’t broken, luckily), has been since the temperature spiked in the flat. He’s completely, utterly alone.
John chuckles and takes the mug, letting his fingers linger on Sherlock’s. “Hmm. Yes, uh, fine. You just — you never make tea.”
when I say that this is a situation that requires a personal fucking doctor.” Sherlock opens his mouth to interject, but John plows through. “You can’t keep having such a blatant disregard for your health and safety!”
Now it’s Sherlock’s turn to say, “
John is working. He claims he needs to pick up more shifts at the surgery, regardless of the heavy sleet and rain outside. Sherlock, as a result, is bored. He hasn’t had a proper case in nine (nine!) days; John told him amusedly one day as he trudged through the flat that sometimes serial killers got cold. That sometimes, people didn’t want to haul a dead body to a remote location they couldn’t be tracked to in -2° weather.
Sherlock blinks rapidly. He
It feels right, being back here: normal, domestic. There’s gold in John’s chest — a warm, bright, trickling gold — that he can’t seem to keep at bay.
“Why did you leave my wedding?”
It’s quiet for a second. “Monday night,” he finally mumbles. “I slept on Sunday.”
He takes a chance then, a split second to calculate, to consider the signs. John leans his head against the detective’s back, presses his lips to a scar.
yourself, I’ve been recruited as your personal doctor.” He spits the last words venomously.
“John,” he whines in retaliation. They stare each other down for a minute before John sighs.
and John’s chest aches twofold — both the scars and the realization that his wonderfully human detective is painfully in love.
Sherlock flinches then, setting his phone on his lap — he still hasn’t met John’s eyes — and resting his hands under his chin. There’s a ten second pause, then he abruptly stands up, popping the collar of his coat up and heading for the door.
Sherlock’s fingers still on his phone, but he doesn’t look up; his face remains an impassive mask, shoulders relaxed. The only thing that briefly gives away his discomfort is the slight twitch in his right eyebrow. “Bored.”
They climb the stairs into John’s room, and Sherlock sits lightly on the edge of the bed. It should feel strange, John thinks, but it’s surprisingly normal.
“Sherlock? What. . .  is that?”
~ • ~
Sherlock looks up at him and says, “You were with my brother.”
Sherlock bites his lip sheepishly. “Four. I didn’t sleep the night before Lestrade called.”
“John? Are you feeling alright?”
He’s been silent too long to form a logical lie, and he curses himself for his stupidity when John tentatively says, “Sherlock?”
He sighs, clicks off his phone. Sherlock’s eyes are closed, hands under his chin and he’s curled up in a ball on the sofa. John’s hands unconsciously clench and flex as he debates his options.
“Oh, Sherlock,” His voice is soft and laced with concern. Sherlock tightens, poised to stand.
“Oh.” A beat, then the recognition sets in. “
Then, he hears Sherlock stand up and shuffle over to him. A line of warmth lights against the exposed skin of John’s back, and he watches long fingers wrap around the box and place it on the table.
—as the shorter man goes in search of the sugar. It’s higher up on the shelf than usual — Sherlock must’ve put it away — and he stretches up to reach it. The detective chuckles from his seat on the table, and John grumbles in response, sure that he looks like an absolute child in his position.
I was feeling— and I thought that if I could try to fall in love with someone else it would dull the pain of losing you and never. . .  never getting to tell you.”
He sits down.
“It’s both ways, Sherlock. There’s no blame to be placed on either one of us, okay? But, we can’t— you can’t—” He sighs, gathers his thoughts and then says, “We can’t just. . .  not talk about it, right? When we hurt each other, we have to let the other know. Otherwise it won’t— it won’t end well, okay?”
Sherlock scrutinizes— John can literally
(John can’t help it to be just a tad suspicious.)
“Some of them weren’t.” It’s quiet, so quiet that John could ignore it if he wanted to. (Sherlock knows he won’t.)
~ • ~
A long sigh pulls itself out of John’s chest, and he chuckles a bit. “Yeah.”
Sherlock, John realizes quite suddenly, hasn’t slept in almost — he assumes — four days. His first thought: is he on a case? (why didn’t he ask me?)
“Beg your pardon?”
Their lips crash together in a sloppy kiss, and John can feel the wetness on Sherlock’s cheeks — chooses not to call attention to it. Instead, he pulls away, tugs him into a standing position.
, he’s fucked.
There’s no dramatic talk, or plea —  none of the sort. John simply begins leaving things at Sherlock’s flat, and they compile bit by bit until one day, he stops leaving.
Siger had never been a man to hide from his emotions; tears fell freely, affection was often shown, anger always expressed. He let his tears fall now, travelling down his cheeks and soaking his wife’s greying hair.
Sherlock gripped the beast’s snout anxiously as it began to move. It deposited him back in the tower, leaving the prince  more confused than he could ever remember being. He hated the feeling.
‘There’s more than one wound that could have killed her if given time,’ John said, touching the two deepest on her abdomen, and the one that had nicked her femoral artery in her thigh. ‘She had twenty minutes when they got that one, but I think it’s the cut to her neck that finished her off.’
'He's protective. I can understand that. Sort of.' Greg took a long, steady drink. 'Sherlock's no shrinking violet. He can look after himself well enough, and he's better at dealing with people than he once was, but he still gets blindsided now and then. Mycroft hates that. Hates the thought of anyone breaking his brother's heart.'
The file's existence and contents had become intrinsically linked with John and, by association, Sherlock. Mycroft would see that it could no longer bring any harm upon either of them. 'There's a USB stick on the dining table: a self-destruct by way of an exploit for the servers on which the file fragments are secured. Run it, and the job will be done. Feel free to have some of your spooks reverse engineer it if you are unsure.'
A kiss brushed Sherlock’s cheek, and he turned, quickly capturing John’s lips with his own, revelling in the giddy, familiar thrill of it. Once, he would have been alarmed that anyone could approach him so unnoticed, but those days were long gone. At least when it came to the man who now shared so much of his life.
'Yeah, well, a bobby's pay's not much better than an army pension, and in this city, you take what you can get.' Greg stretched his arms, groaning as he glanced at his watch. 'I s'pose we'd better get you home to your other half.'
'Ugh, no thanks. Just butter.'
All that time, all those years, and he’d never really noticed the subtle ways Sherlock showed that he cared. Only when the whole damn lot had come crashing down around his ears had he opened his eyes to what was right in front of him. Not the prickle of want, which had been his companion for too long to count, but love: pure and simple.
For a moment, their footsteps and the dull rush of London’s traffic were the only sounds around them. Then, John asked the obvious question.
'So that's it? Mycroft's just going after the evidence regardless of what happens to us?' John clambered in next to him and did up his seatbelt, a frown furrowing his brow. 'Whose side is he on?'
Mary swallowed, her throat clicking as she bowed her head, not daring to look John in the eye. Her hands twisted into helpless fists, and her gaze skittered to the dismantled gun on the mantelpiece. She seemed to realise the fruitlessness of reaching for it, however, and instead resigned herself to the truth.
‘Prat,’ John grumbled, glaring at the news. A Banksy piece had just half-shredded itself at the auction house. Everyone was saying it was a searing political statement. It just looked like a cock-up to him. Worse, it had probably just added a small fortune onto the already disgustingly high asking price. Somehow he bet Banksy’s political leanings wouldn’t prevent him from taking that pay check.
It should have made Sherlock vulnerable, strutting around like a peacock. With vivid intelligence and a chilly demeanour, most read him as different and weak. John saw them do it time and again. They would stroll onto a scene, full of bluster and bravado.
'Maybe let the doctor be the judge of that, yeah?' John tugged his hand aside, slicing the denim jeans further so he could see the injury for himself. His movements were busy and proficient. Sherlock knew what John was doing: distracting himself from what he had done and the evidence of it that existed within arm's reach.
He took the Belstaff, leaving Sherlock to trot up the stairs as John made sure their coats were hung neat on the hooks. Following at a slower pace, he listened to the creak and groan of the steps chart his way up to the flat he called home.
‘Well I must be off. The country won’t run itself.’
It was more awkward this way, face-to-face, but something in him rebelled at the idea of turning his back. He wanted to witness Sherlock – the honesty of him coming undone and spilling himself into John's body. He wanted to watch him find his rhythm and then lose it again: the conductor of John's pleasure and executor of his release.
They barely allowed each other the space to move, too lost in torrid wanting to care about the ache of cramped wrists and the sharp clash of hip bones. Distance was a sacrilege, unthinkable, and John could only whimper as his toes curled in his boots.
‘Yeah, all right. This way.’
All of them, in all their roles, orbited Sherlock. He was their centre, whether they liked it or not. His personal power may be limited, but without him, there was no game – no point…
The hot water belted down over his head, and John closed his eyes, wishing for a moment that it could drown him and take all his worries away. More and more, it all felt like too much. Mary's death, the people watching him, and above all else the aching uncertainty that lay between him and Sherlock: a chasm of his own making, and one he didn't know how to bridge.
It made no sense. How could the world keep turning when his lay in pieces? How could dawn gild London – Sherlock’s city – when Sherlock himself would never see another day? Blood and staring blue eyes: the uncaring pavement outside Bart’s his final resting place.
Some people may point out that – between Sherlock’s cases and Mary’s vibrant past – there was plenty to put John Watson in peril, and they would be right. However, the intermittent peaks of adrenaline had not been enough to sustain him. Additionally, they had come from Sherlock and Mary: external sources that John had not, in truth, chosen. Not fully. Not truly. Not since the fall from Bart’s.
'Are you safe?'
'Then we rethink.'
'Yeah, but she's a bit short on patients as well. They're doing most of their consultations by phone at the moment, and there's been a huge drop in people bothering to contact their GP.'
He had never been a victim to loneliness before John's arrival, but once he moved out... Well, Sherlock could acknowledge that some of the colour had bled away from his existence. For all the trials and tribulations of the past week or more, John's constant presence had been the silver-lining. Now it seemed, he was here to stay.
'Then what is?'
‘Anything I need to worry about?’ Greg asked, in the wary tone of a DI who didn’t want to end up back on duty.
Him falling into the same old habits, like he was stuck in some awful cycle that he could not break.
John had been glad of it. He hadn't noticed anyone else, not really. Certainly not the photographer who had snapped this moment, carving it free from the flow of their lives to stand in eerie solitude.
Shaking his head, he crept back into the bedroom, pausing to admire the peacefulness of John's respite. He slept well, even he could see that: a deep, restorative slumber that beckoned Sherlock to respond in kind.
Fencing engaged Sherlock’s body as well as his intellect: devoting his entire being to a craft he had mastered years ago and clearly never forgotten.
'Physically, perhaps.' The look Sherlock gave him was all-seeing, and John fought the temptation to shy away. He had never been able to hide anything from Sherlock, and he was not about to start trying now. 'I am sorry, about Mary.'
Nothing. She had nothing to gain, because none of it was ever about Sherlock. He had been a prop within the act of Mary’s play that unfolded to her direction. She and Norbury were already connected: tied together by the past they shared with AGRA. What if there was more to it? What if, right from the start, Mary had not merely been a tool of the British Government and beyond? What if she'd been a puppet master, pulling the strings even as she pretended to dance to another's tune?
Sherlock grunted. 'Too late.' A hollow pain drummed at his right temple, amplifying his frustration. If he were back in London, he would take to the streets. He would chase down contacts and comb the city’s alleys for answers. His restless energy would find an outlet, and he could at least comfort himself with the illusion of progress. Here, he felt caged, penned in by the four walls of the house. Wretched.
Was it deliberate? Did Sherlock do it because he knew that whatever affected John would affect Rosie as well? Or was it just instinct that made Sherlock ignore the more comfortable furniture and put himself in easy reach of Rosie should she need him? He almost asked the question out loud, but shook it away as Sherlock opened up the laptop again. The glow of it bathed his face as John stared at his down-bent head.
'You really do know everything, don't you, Sherlock?' She raised her eyebrows and spread her hands, inviting. 'So come on, then, what’s the rest of it? You might as well finish painting me as the villain. It works so much better that way, doesn't it? Then you never have to tell John the truth.'

ruining the Moriarty’s mark on her. Blood oozed from the wounds, red staining her fingertips as tears dripped slowly down her face. Irene watched in horrified silence as her pale skin knit itself back together right before her eyes. Moriarty’s song came back to her, stronger than ever, and Irene nearly screamed. She had to get it off of her.
Siger, where are they?”
“Long enough to talk Graham and his sister over to our side,” Sherlock replied.
“It’s probably
you won’t hurt him. You’re smarter than that. You’ll have to deal with me and the British government.”
“Do you remember the last time I saw you?” the man asked, finally turning his gaze towards Sherlock. “Was it last year already, Sherl?”
John winced at the sound of Sherlock’s pain. “I’m so sorry. I should’ve knocked or-”
The woman narrowed her pale eyes and frowned, crossing her arms and sending Sherlock a dirty look. He pleaded with her silently to trust him and drop the subject. Blessedly, she seemed to realize that it actually
“Not much,” the knight replied. “Are you going to help us…?”
It feels so good to be posting again!! I've regained a lot of excitement for this fic as I near the end of it. There will be 17 chapters in total (how I wish it were an even number), and it'll all be posted before November.
“Mycroft. I know what you’re about to say, and I’m telling you: you need rest. Both of you. Find your rooms, dust, and sleep. All right?”
John’s head whipped around, and he caught the gaze of a tall, broad-shouldered man with a charming smile plastered on his dark face.
As the pair approached the castle, Sherlock found himself gravitating towards John. Even at the balls and feasts thrown by his parents, Sherlock had never seen so many people. They weren't just talking; they were shouting and haggling and arguing, all rushing by without a care for anyone but themselves.
“Oh, just
Irene narrowed her eyes and saw right through him. “You’re such a prick. Just smile for once. It’s not gonna kill you.”
of yours, isn’t it?” the man spat. “Oh, Sherlock, no! He’s not
The prince stared blankly at the mirror until it got dark, and the mirror stared back. Once he could no longer see the girl’s eyes, Sherlock crawled into bed, curled up under the thin blanket, and clenched his eyes shut, shivering violently as a cold wind blew through the open window.
Mike nodded enthusiastically. “Yeah, yeah, it’s been good. It’s been great! I got married while you were off saving the kingdom. You should come by to meet the missus! I’m sure she’d just love you,” Mike assured.
Sherlock paused, his mouth hanging open. His hands were frozen in midair, outstretched during his usual wild gesturing. Rosalie and Greg took seats across from them.
“The things you warned me about earlier,” John put in.
“The monsters haven’t come in over than a month, have they? Why didn’t you mention it earlier?”
“Yes, dear,” she said. “Thank you.”
"Oh, yes."
“You could die!” Harry argued.
“I love you, too, you know.”
“Yeah. Sorry.”
"The princess?" John asked, and his voice sounded as strained as Sherlock felt. "You knew her, then?"
John noticed her only when she raised her sword, hidden in an alley only feet from their struggle. She waited, watching the flurry of their blades, the pain on John’s face as Mary’s sword struck his shoulder, the disgust on Mary’s as he spit at her feet. Irene winced in sympathy as Mary forced John to his knees. Silently, she moved behind Mary, took a deep breath, and swung her sword.
“All hell broke loose,” Greg continued. “Anderson was the first to go a little mad. He killed a calf to feed him and his wife and her sister, and Dimmock was right pissed about it, so she nearly castrated Anderson, and right in front of his nephews, too. It took a while for people to settle down, after that. We rationed the livestock until there were none left. We kept farming. We still starve. And that’s not even considering the things that come at night.”
“Don’t call me that,” Rosalie snapped. “I’ve been twenty-five longer than you’ve been alive.”
Irene pinched the bridge of her nose. “Can we just- drop it?”
Of course John saw Sherlock around campus; in fact, in the last three days, John had seen Sherlock more often than he had in the past month.
Mycroft was doomed.

a bath. And
“Why does
John set his jaw. "I know that, but-"
it’s never gonna happen!”
The sun was high in the sky when several of London’s knights strode into the room, swords drawn and scowls etched on their faces.
John turned to see a round, grinning man approaching him.
“No,” she said. “That was Mary’s plan, not mine.”
Sherlock’s confession inspired new tears in both Violet and Siger; the former gripped Mycroft’s shoulders and said quite seriously, “You’ve done a splendid job. You’ve always been such a diligent big brother.”
“Oh, now I think you’re just overreacting.”
“Three,” Sherlock replied as Irene got to her feet.
As the fallen knight strolled back home, a voice called out to him. Magic, as loyal as always, buzzed protectively around John. The knight mumbled his thanks and comforted the Magic until it slowly began to relax.
Only kind of edited. Longer chapter this update!
they have more field experience than either of you. What are you, sixteen?”
The pair could barely reply, their mouths open in shock.
“An absolute menace,” Sherlock agreed. He dropped a kiss on John’s forehead and vaulted out of bed. “John! I smell like an animal. We need a bath.”
“Did you hit your head or something?” the man laughed. Mycroft knew then how weak of a man he truly was. There was an attractive man with a beautiful laugh standing in front of him, and Mycroft, as bare as the day he was born, blushed to the tips of his ears as the man continued, “Do you have other clothes somewhere?”
Unamused, Harry slammed a plate of eggs on the table. John winced at the sound.
“Harry, you know I didn’t-”
The call rang out again, and John winced at its intensity. The buzzing in his ears was no longer Magic’s fault; it was his own adrenaline mixed with the song of the magpies. Several more of the creatures emerged from the branches of various trees, all surrounding John. He cursed to himself as the birds began their assault.
Irene gasped. “Then it’ll even be easy for you to get here!”
“What do you want me to say?” he asked, his voice rising for the first time since they’d started talking. “I have to go if I want it to shut up, and there’s nothing for me here. What’s the harm done if I go or not?”
- of carrying on behind my husband’s back. How could he say such…” She bit her lip, painted blood red even though she wore only her thin dressing gown and slip. “Oh, such
“Excuse me?” Irene demanded, storming into the kitchen, a bowl of crisps in her hands.
They broke apart, smiling like idiots.
“Thank you, Sherlock,” said the Queen.
“Of course I bloody feel it! How could I not?” Harry demanded. “It gets so loud I can’t sleep at night.”
It had been years since she had seen kindness.
“No,” his sister whispered. “Get out.”
This chapter was a pain to write for some reason. Hope it wasn't a pain to read.
“Never intentionally.”

“Sherlock, I would
“It’s not even noon!”
The man paled. “The witch turned you both and your youngest son to stone,” he explained. Violet’s heart sank, and her gaze wandered to the mess of stone by the shattered mirror. “Moriarty killed him, Your Highness.”
“Find Mycroft,” Sherlock ordered, his voice unlike John had ever heard it, tight and stern. “Find my brother and take me to my parents.”

“You’re blind!” she gasped. “Oh, it’s only one eye, but- Oh, Myc, it’s just so good to see you, darling. You know how your father worries.”
Snow crunched underfoot with every step. John panted heavily, his breath escaping his lips and billowing out like tendrils of smoke emitted from a great dragon. Eventually he got so tired of seeing his breath, of slowly letting his jaw go numb, that he wrapped a scarf around his face and settled at that. The weight of his bags made John’s back ache, but he walked on as diligently as ever.
and John couldn’t stand it.
“You want to host two weddings? In the state of this economy?” Siger teased, dropping a kiss onto his wife’s head.

Irene smirked. “Your prince awaits, Mr. Watson.”
“Because you love me, birdie.”

was smiling like an idiot. His boyfriend never so much as cracked a grin, instead smirking imperiously every now and then.
can fly me up there.”
Sherlock watched rapturously as the girl in the mirror blinked once, twice, and then three times before smiling sweetly.
Should someone ask Sherlock if he couldn’t help but smile as Sarah dropped a kiss on Soo Lin’s forehead, he would lie and say he didn’t believe in true love. If they assumed he longed for that affection in his own life, he would do the same.
(This chapter was supposed to be longer than ~2k but I couldn't force it out of me or else it wouldn't be good enough to post. I figure after that wait, you deserve something good. Plus, I like Irene's POV.)
A strong wind blew sand into his eyes, and he cried out, tears forcing their way past his eyelids and down his cheeks. When he opened them again, the sky was dull grey and cold to the touch.
“Are you sure you don’t want to tell me what’s wrong?”
John only hummed in response.
“I what?”
The blond jumped at the voice behind him. He turned to find Irene nursing a wine cooler, her eyebrows raised. The expression on her face was, generally, unimpressed.
Eventually, John managed to fall back asleep, his arms wrapped around his pillow. The next morning, he ignored his sister's worried (but still drunken) glances and wordlessly began his laundry rounds, his mind miles away.
“Where did you run off to today?” John had asked, his elbows on the table (just like Mummy had always insisted Sherlock
“What?” Sherlock snapped.
“I found you, Sherlock,” he repeated, Sherrinford’s sweet little voice ringing in Sherlock’s ears. “I found you. I found you-”
“I think it’s unwise,” the King claimed. “You obviously have an unhealthy, one-sided emotional connection to a superior that should never have been allowed to grow in the first place. Frankly, I’m concerned for his safety around you.”
“Good,” John replied, and the waves of anger in his stomach subsided.
“I guess I'll have to go myself, then,” Mike replied as they walked to their next class. “I'll tell Irene and Sherlock you couldn't make it. I’m sure they’ll understand.”
"I do."
“You don’t really believe that, do you?” he asked, smiling softly at the prince.
A small cough came from behind him, and Mycroft met wide brown eyes in the mirror.
Sherlock’s smile was. The only real word he could assign to it was simply ‘perfect,’ no matter how plebeian it sounded.)
“Greg.”
Moriarty’s Magic blossomed in his open palm, green and red and black and terrible.
a bit wider, and he licked his lips reflexively. Sherlock must have caught the movement, for the blush on his cheeks intensified tenfold.
“Can’t really blame me, can you? He really wasn’t all that important, anyway, you know. Not the eldest, not the smartest… Just a child.”
Irene swallowed. “I thought about what you said. You were right.”
“Sherlock, wait a minute!”
John had shaken his head. “My mother.”
“You have to go out and get him!” Mike insisted. “That’s why Mary left you, you know.”
So there's a bit of violence in this chapter. Tread with care maybe? I don't think it's too bad, but then again I wrote it.
“John, we can-”
places.
“Would it be so unforgivable, John?” Shan inquired, seemingly changing tactics. “Would it be so monstrous of me to seek love wherever I can find it?”
“Do they know?” he asked, dried tears decorating his pale face. “About Prince Sherrinford. How much do they know?”
The wounds, cauterized by the white hot blade, were a deep and angry red. The wind howled around Irene, stinging her eyes and drying the tears dripping down her face. She wrapped stolen blankets and cloaks around herself, desperately trying to fight off the cold of the tail end of winter.
“My name is Prince William Holmes of London,
(See the end of the chapter for
Panicking, Sherlock threw on a purple dress shirt, buttoning it as quickly as possible. He missed a few of the buttons, but he was reasonably sure that John wouldn’t catch any glimpses of his binder. (Now, Sherlock was by no means still closeted. Everyone of importance knew nearly immediately, and everyone else should have the good sense to mind their damn business. Of course he planned to tell John eventually, if their relationship progressed beyond accidentally assaulting each other, but he wasn't fond of the idea of John catching him in just his binder and a pair of pants.) He’d just grabbed a pair of jeans when the door opened fully.
With a map in one hand and his cane in the other, John set off to find St. Bart’s Tower. Judging by the map Mike had lent him, the tower was around fifty kilometers away; John figured that he could make it there in a little less than three days if all went well, four days if it snowed any more than it already had, or at least a week if something went very, very wrong.
all right, yeah?”

Sherlock frowned. “Irene Adler, you get your
He'd find a way to get out of there. He swore it.
Sherlock nodded, standing stiffly in the middle of the room as the girl said her goodbyes. He didn’t move towards the bed or the basket, his eyes fixed on the girl who had stepped out of the mirror.
Soo Lin and Sarah met Sherlock for breakfast in the morning, which left the prince little time to dwell on John
“You made yourself a bath?”
Please leave kudos or a comment if you're so moved. It would make my day. :)
“Sherlock, you don't ha-”
He did not know how long they wept.
John laughed. “No, no, you’re right. Go ahead. I'll wait my turn."
“It’s an honor, Lady Yao,” John said, bowing his head.
The prince gazed up at John with an unreadable look on his face before turning his scrutinizing eyes towards the King himself.
“I didn’t think boys your age would be childish enough to steal someone’s things,” John said very plainly. “Why did you think it was a good idea? Did you think you wouldn’t get caught?”
But Sherlock hadn’t read it.
Children shouted over them.
Sherlock stared, eyes wide. “How did you-”
The boys nodded, and Sherlock strolled out of the ballroom as if in a daze. Mycroft lagged behind, a pensive look on his face.
They stood there staring at each other for nearly a minute before finally speaking at the same time.
“I said don’t,” he murmured, his eyes shut tightly, his fingers flexing at his sides.
He wailed until his throat gave out and his voice was hoarse. He lay there on the floor panting heavily, staring at the dull stones in front of him. He could see his breath. Stray tears had soaked into his dark hair, and it stuck to the side of his face as he struggled to his feet.
He knew not how long they wept, wrapped in each other’s embrace on the cold marble floor.
Sherlock’s cheeks turned pink.
Longer chapter again!! Not beta'd or britpicked. Sorry for any mistakes you see.
John felt anger from his chest to his fingertips as the tall guard smiled lecherously at the prince. Magic buzzed fiercely in John's ears as the guard licked his lips.
“I won’t ask if you don’t want to tell me,” John blurted.
Sherlock rolled his eyes as Irene practically
Sherlock had no doubt that John was sincere.
John considered that answer for a moment, watching the movement of Sherlock’s pale throat as he swallowed. Nerves? Possibly. John couldn’t blame him.
“No you can’t!” came an amused reply.
“You may be used to getting whatever you want, but that doesn’t mean you can take things that belong to other people.”
John had just taken a deep breath and reached for his bow, carefully sliding an arrow out of his quiver, when something solid and feathery struck the back of his head. He wobbled a bit but maintained his balance.
Soo Lin laughed. “I’m sure she does. How long have you been holding that in?”
“You don't-”
“Oh, ever since Sebastian’s been gone, Nathan’s been in a terrible state. Can’t stop worrying, never eats, barely sleeps,” Mike explained. “It’s a terrible business, really.”
he began, “you said as much or as little as I want.”
a far-off voice reminded him.
“You’re too kind to kill me,” she noted. “I’ll take my leave of you both. Goodbye, and good luck.”
The doors had hardly banged shut when Violet turned to Siger, her voice tinged with forced casualty.
party?”
“For God’s sake!” Irene yelled. “Everyone get out of my kitchen.
He stepped out of the bathroom, grabbed one of the beers he and Mike had bought, and made his way to the sitting room.
Irene couldn’t blame John for that, could she? It was always kill or be killed, and they had tried to kill John first. Irene had been the one lucky enough to escape with her life.
Irene rolled her eyes. “So? I’ll invite her, then. I already invited Mike for you, told him he could bring along the object of your affections.”
shopping.”
Check for added tags! I'll be updating them as I post so I don't ruin anything right away.
“Are you even listening to me?” Irene snapped, pointing a jar of honey at Sherlock. The man raised his eyebrows and gazed at her innocently.
He would ignore the handsome (and handsome didn’t even begin to describe him) man  until he went away, and everything would be fine.
“I am
There was an arrow through the black woman’s neck, blood pouring out of the wound and out of her mouth, staining both her teeth and the snow around her. Her eyes were completely white, and into the dark skin over her heart was carved a single letter.
Sherlock knit his eyebrows together. “Of course I do.”
Sherlock fell into the defensive role, as Moriarty didn’t stop swinging for a moment. The prince’s swordsmanship was rusty; he hadn’t had the last five decades to practice. His sword, far from feeling foreign in his hand, still moved clumsily through the air as he blocked Moriarty’s blows.
Cold wind nipped at John’s nose and burned his lungs. A thin layer of sweat formed on his forehead, his chest, his back. The knight cursed the weather for killing him and his body for betraying him.
Both Sherlock and John started towards her, but, with Sherlock being confined to the bed, only John was able to grab her arm. She recoiled as if burned by fire, tearing herself away from John’s grip and staring at him with wide eyes, her blanket pulled tightly around her frame.
“I love you,” she replied.
Irene had every reason to turn against them, the main being that she was never on their side to begin with. She had stood on a shaky middle ground for some time, but Sherlock wasn't sure if that was enough for John. It was surely enough for him. When the middle ground crumbled, and Irene needed somewhere to turn, Mary wouldn't be there to catch her.
Irene had to laugh (even as her skull was being split open by the pain of Moriarty’s song). She imagined her master’s confused face as her life force fluctuated, his hold on her ever weakening. If Irene could break their connection again, if she could be free of
"Sherlock?" she whispered.
The prince swallowed the angry response rising in his throat, instead advancing upon Moriarty, his sword gleaming in the morning sunlight. Moriarty grinned.
John didn’t know if Sherlock knew he was looking for him. Ordinarily, John wouldn’t even entertain the thought, but Sherlock wasn’t ordinary at all. Certainly Sherlock would be able to tell what was on John’s mind, even from a distance.
There came the sound of their front door opening, and Sherlock’s heart jumped as he heard John’s voice.
Leave a kudos or a comment if you liked it!
“I’ll decide what I need to know from now on,” Sherlock snapped. “Now, how many of you can fight?”
It wasn’t long before they too were defeated, two lying motionlessly in the crimson-stained snow, one flying hastily away, squawking as it went. The sound was a heartbreaking one, broken and terrified. John had heard that cry before, not from a bird but from within the heart of man; he recognized it in his own heart, identified it immediately as the feeling of watching a friend die, the life leave their eyes, and their body becoming this…
John watched in awe as Lady Sarah guided her wife to stand before Sherlock. The prince was smiling widely, his eyes crinkled and his face open. It was a beautiful smile, and John’s heart hurt to look at it.
"Sir John Watson," he explained, "on behalf of Major James Sholto. We've business with the King."
Magic cannot always be everywhere it’s needed.
"Is there a third, now?" Sherlock asked, unwilling to answer John's question.
The skepticism in Sherlock’s voice made John’s heart ache.
Sherlock shot his flatmate a heated glare. He stood for the first time since around four that morning, when he’d returned from the all-night Tesco four blocks away, a plastic bag in each hand, and threw himself haphazardly on the sofa. The man blinked owlishly for a moment before righting himself, straightening his dressing gown with an air of royalty.
“You really went all out, didn’t you?” John laughed.
smile.
Sherlock gave a small, sad smile, averting his eyes. “That I’m stalking them.”
“Well, if we must,” Sherlock replied. He lowered his voice and added, “I bet she’d be a terrible flatmate, though.”
A single grey eye blinked at him before a large black snout forced its way through the window. A scream ripped its way out of Sherlock’s dry throat, and he scrambled under his bed. He didn’t want to starve or freeze to death, but he
What good will the bloody mirror do me?” The prince spun around to glare at the offending piece of furniture. “You don’t happen to have any food, do you? Water? A blanket or two?”
John sat on the very edge of Sherlock’s bed, but Sherlock rolled his eyes and sat in the middle, his legs folded under him.
Sherlock shrugged. “I wrote it off as wishful thinking.”
There were rugs in Sherlock’s flat right this very minute, when his friends, romantic interest, and older brother could find them at any time.
“Your son?”
The man’s smile disappeared. Mycroft turned away, glared at himself in the mirror, and continued rifling through the closet. He felt the man’s eyes on his back, and he wondered if he had more scars there.
“I will.”
“Oh! Ah, miss, I’m a doctor-”
The next morning, as scouts from outer villages trickled into Central London, Irene hid and watched, her eyes tracking their every movement.
He was an idiot.
“Magic isn’t mine,” John said. “It’s more like… it takes my advice sometimes. It just likes me.”

“You’re not helping!”
"The King will see you shortly," the guard said. "Allow me to escort you to the counsel room, Your Highness, Sir Watson."
Thanks for reading! I really appreciate everyone continuing to read this story!!
“Yes,” the prince said. “Hello, Soo Lin.”
Sherlock scoffed. “Why would you want to?”
John sighed. The three women drew their weapons.
“Mycroft?” Sherlock guessed, his voice loud enough so the dragon could hear him. “Don’t be- This is impossible.”
“She could-”
"Yeah, I know. Come on, get in the tub."
“Brilliant,” John muttered, grinning up at him. “Just fantastic!”
“Good.”
“Have you any further thoughts about our battle plans?” Shan asked abruptly. John opened his mouth to reply, but Shan just laughed. “Oh, pet, you don’t have to answer that! It’d be better if you didn’t, actually. That way I can say I was just here to ask you about war, like a good little host, when you

“Oh! Mate, why don’t you pop ‘round now?” Mike asked excitedly. “Aline’s home, and I’ve just got to stop at the shops before we’ll be ready for supper. Unless you’re busy!”
“You’ll be able to sleep once I leave.”

The last thing John saw before his vision turned black was Sherlock’s retreating form, not casting even a glance over his shoulder as John hit the floor.
"Irene?" he whispered.
“I haven’t been able to sleep right ever since you got home, you know,” Harry complained. “You say Magic doesn’t belong to anyone, but it follows you. It
“Of Northumberland?” Mike asked, and John nodded again. “Why would they do anything? They don’t want Moriarty coming after our kingdom next.”
“No,” Irene replied, casting him a dirty look. “That’s Mycroft’s job, and I’m not even going to
~*~*~
The knight shot Sherlock a lopsided smile, and they headed off to the pub for breakfast.
“So that means it's not real?”
Sherlock’s whole body stiffened.
Shaking fingers traced the prince’s face, from the sharp angles of his cheekbones to the strong slope of his nose to the delicate dip of his cupid’s bow.
“There’s no need for tears,” he said. “Do you have a handkerchief? Can you wipe your face?”
“Yeah,” the blond replied, blushing. “Um, sorry.  I can't- um.”
“Maybe remember to clean it out after each use next time,” John replied, shrugging. “Might avoid any future explosions that way.”
~*~*~
John shrugged. “All the same, isn’t it? Where’re you headed?”
“Well, you can’t expect him to microwave his eyeballs and Irene’s tea in the same one,” Greg reasoned, gently rubbing his boyfriend’s shoulder.
“I just wanted to make sure that what you heard today… Well, I wanted to make sure it was all clear to you. Your friend-”
The man holding John froze in place. His shocked expression was almost lost in the night. Stupidly, he tightened his grip on John’s small body.
John watched in concern as Sherlock began to blink rapidly, suddenly sitting up, his back as straight as a rod. Maybe trying to be funny wasn’t working.
“Myc?” he questioned. “He’s not- He’s all right, isn’t he? Sherrinford’s all right?”
a hunk of distorted metal in your kitchen, do you?”
“No, no, no, no…”
“Of course we have a plan,” the prince replied, staring straight ahead. “Get into the castle and kill Moriarty.”
“I’ve talked to Sherlock four times.”
“Sherlock. Stop,” John ordered, an amused smile on his face. “You’re fine. Believe me. Just stop talking.”
“I'm not- I wouldn't-”
“You’ll regret that, Sherlock Holmes.”
“‘You’ve said that ever since Redbeard died.”
Mike shot John a nasty glare. “And why didn’t you try to talk to him?”
“What?”
“Out where?” Irene laughed. “On Valentine’s Day? Alone?”
“Right,” John agreed, smiling. He had a lovely smile. Sherlock squeezed his hand tighter. “We’re looking for any help we can get, I suppose. Even if it’s just a couple of horses that can take us to Central London. We don’t mean to put anyone in danger.”
“Yeah, ‘til then.”
“Of course I do. What are you going on about?”
“Yes.”
“Ah. You live ‘round here, then,” the man mused. Mycroft turned to glare at him, but found the sour look on his face disappearing as he took in the man who found him.  Warm brown eyes and a bright smile and stubble on his cheeks and-
“There’s nothing for me here!” John repeated, slamming his fist on the table. He inhaled sharply as he realized what he’d said. “Harry-”
That startled a laugh out of the prince, and he felt a small smile pull at his lips.
“Oh, don't look now. He's staring at your arse.”

“Oh, I can!” Shan replied cheerily, her dressing gown falling off one shoulder. “I will have you, John.”
John nodded. “Tell me if there’s a time you’re

The knight swallowed hard. “He’s usually right.”
John frowned. “Sorry?”

kill him.
Sherlock scowled. “Of course I’m not on drugs! It was just a few times anyway. I hardly made a habit of-”
“Without question. You’ve spoken to him. You would know.”
“You don’t think so?”
Push. “Didn’t you wonder why it was so goddamn quiet?”
“Of course we’ll be needing two bedrooms,” he said, shame creeping up on him like the first frost of winter. He swallowed hard as he watched Sherlock’s shoulders tense; he longed to run his hands over the prince’s stiff muscles, soothing away the tension he put there.
Sherlock fixed John with a puzzled look. “What else would I have to tell him?”
Sherlock closed his eyes and listened.
“With all due respect, miss-”
“The trick is finding people who care about you as much as you care about them,” Sarah commented. “Who don’t want to hurt you.”
“Get him out of my flat,” Sherlock replied weakly.
“I’m sure.”
I’m panicking.”
“Oh, God, sorry!” John apologized suddenly. Startled by John’s outburst but unwilling to admit it to himself, Sherlock took a singular step back.
“When you’re old, you’ll understand,” Soo Lin added. “Death is very natural, and it may hurt, but it happens. That’s no excuse for isolation.” She reached into a pocket sewn into the left side of her dress and scowled. “Oh! Sarah, love, I left my handkerchief in our room. It has to be where you usually put them at night. Kitty won’t know where it is.”
“That’s good,” John agreed. “You should probably be getting home.”
“I don’t have
“It’s very small.”
“What do you mean, ‘show up?’ I live here,” Sherlock pointed out.
Crystal blue eyes narrowed in John’s direction. “I don’t think so.”
There's a change in posting schedule since I'm doing a lot of writing at the moment. I'd really like to avoid getting behind, and I don't want to be put in the situation where I don't have a chapter to post. That's why I'm changing the next post date from two weeks from now to three. Instead of posting on May 5, I'll post on May 12.
“Oh, he’s sweet, Sherlock.”
“Big brother tell you that?” Moriarty laughed. “Don’t tell me! Of course he did. I see.” Moriarty stood and drew his sword. Sherlock did the same. Moriarty waggled his eyebrows. “Oh! I see

know you can't threaten the Yao family. You don't stand a chance against their guards. One or two, definitely. A whole army of them?" Sherlock scoffed. "I doubt it, but you're welcome to try."
“So, why’d you steal her doll, then?”
Camp Nano is this month, so I should be writing way more than I was. Hopefully I'll finish this this summer. The outline is 14 chapters. Hopefully it won't be much longer than that. Once I finish the whole thing, I'll up the posting speed to once or maybe twice a week. Or maybe I won't finish it that quickly.

Just as John rounded the landing, something tall, dark, and solid crashed into him, sending him stumbling backwards and straight onto his arse. That tall, dark, solid something landed directly on top of him, all awkward limbs and pointy elbows and knees digging into the soft flesh of John’s stomach and - well -
“If I were able to think of Moriarty with anything but contempt, I might even feel pity for him. I trust that John will keep my brother safe from harm.”
“I’m having some too, you know.”
John struggled to his feet. He was beginning to feel a bit light-headed.
“Yeah,” John affirmed, a smile tugging at his lips. “Course I do. Is it that hard to believe?”

to have boarded those windows. Someone had boarded the windows, stocked the bookshelf, changed his clothes, dusted the furniture, and made sure no one could leave the tower.
“Used to getting what I want?”
“All right, then,” he said. “Let’s… Let’s get something to eat and head to London. Shouldn’t be more than a two days’ walk now.”
"Fine," Sherlock replied.
Rolling out of bed, Sherlock glanced at the (empty, at least for the moment) mirror and shuffled to the window. He resolutely ignored the scruff growing on his chin and cheeks, instead focusing on decoding his brother’s message.
John handed Sherlock a towel when he stood, and the prince gingerly wrapped it around his body. John looked away as Sherlock dressed, his ears burning. Even if he was in love with Sherlock, everything he’d imagined had been in theory, and he wasn’t ready to give himself over to reality just yet.
“There,” John said suddenly. “Right there. Do you hear it?”
Dinner with John set everything right, but that didn’t stop the nightmares from coming.
“He’s got the whole town under his control,” John said. “The whole kingdom. You think just marching in is going to do anything other than get us killed?”
“Why not?” he asked.
“We’re starving,” Rosalie said. Sherlock eyed her healthy figure, finding no evidence of malnutrition. She glared at him. “No matter how much we eat, it’s never enough. We’re
Sherlock shrugged. “Perhaps I’m not. That doesn’t change anything. You’ve been waiting for salvation for fifty-six years. Here I am. Are you going to turn me away?”
“Yes,” she said softly, “Min Hai and his wife Millie have a daughter and two sons. I would have loved for you to meet them. They’re around your age.”
John stood in the doorway, shocked. “Arguing with Irene?”
“This I can use for an experiment,” Sherlock explained. “Facsinating.”
Sherlock opened his mouth to speak, but John cut him off with a sharp look.
Irene could feel her body transforming, her bones shrinking and breaking and rearranging until she could flap her wings and take off, flying towards London despite the discomfort in her wounded shoulder. The wound throbbed painfully with every move, a reminder of the woman who caused it.
The nerve of him. Hurting Sherlock Holmes
The last bit was directed at Sherlock for obvious reasons, as he was still lounging in bed, his laptop on his thighs, wearing pajamas and not at all ready for Irene’s party.
“Neither am I,” John replied, a stupid grin on his face.
Irene watched in awe as Mary transformed into a tiger, white teeth glinting in the morning sun. The beast crouched low in an alleyway not far from Irene, and, as Irene stepped back, its massive head swung in her direction. Irene froze, her heartbeat thunderous, blood rushing in her ears, hands shaking, until the tiger refocused on the horses making their way down the street.
“Do I hurt you? Would I?”
Rosalie’s rounded face turned red, and she defended, “I didn’t think you needed to know.”
"Hello," he said quietly, his eyes roaming over John's unguarded features.

“Thank you, Lestrade. Hopefully the other cities in London have been graced with competent authority.”
A sly smile spread itself across Mike’s face. “Well, that’s up to you, mate. You and your Magic.”
Leave a kudos and a comment if you liked it, hated it, or have any criticisms.
“Yes, it did,” John had laughed. “About time, too.”
“Yeah, I know.” John took his place on the stool again. He poured a handful of water over Sherlock’s head, smiling when the prince glared up at him.
The knight shook his head. “I’m sure you can-”
“No! I don’t fancy her at all! She’s not even the prettiest girl in Baskerville.”
“Yes,” Sherlock replied, his voice clear and calm. His long fingers were steady as he rebuttoned his shirt. “I meant to tell you eventually, but I… had a change of heart.”
“Maybe I'm happy being single and boring,” John suggested. “You ever think of that?”
“Of course,” John replied, smiling weakly. “‘Ello, Mike. How’ve things at home been?”
Good.
“I haven’t been here in ages.”
“Yes,” Sherlock replied. “Two bedrooms.”
John shook his head, an uneasy smile on his face. “Not
John smiled tightly as they passed into the castle's private courtyard, made of primarily cobblestone but decorated with dozens of snow-covered trees. Sherlock said nothing as they approached the second set of guards, so John did the talking.

It was Sherlock’s turn to laugh, only he didn’t even
“Morning, Sherlock,” John rasped. “How long have you been awake?”
“Until next time, Gregory.”
“That woman is fierce,” John agreed.
“Be careful when you clean that up,” he said, and he slipped out the door without another word.
John lay groaning on the floor, black mist swirling ominously around him, lightning crackling and sparking throughout.
“Oh, God, Irene, I made a complete fool of myself.”
“Oh, sweetie. You two are cute.” She laid her hand on John’s arm. “He doesn’t like me talking to you, you know. Thinks I’ll say something embarrassing. I don’t think I have, have I?”
“Stop it.”
Magic tightened around Sherlock’s neck once before the pressure was suddenly relieved. He gasped and choked, desperate for air to fill his lungs. Someone was shouting his name and Moriarty was screaming and everything rang in his ears. He blinked slowly, his body heaving with every new breath. Sherlock’s eyes focused, and his heart nearly beat out of his chest.
(See the end of the chapter for
“But that’s a story,” John said even as Magic began to buzz happily in his ear. “One our mums used to tell us to get us to fall asleep.”
Sarah frowned. “Oh, Sherlock, you don’t believe that.”
the royal one.”
Tearing his eyes away from Sherlock, John bowed to the King and Queen.
“Hopefully you won’t have to find out,” Irene replied. “I don’t think you will, though. And I expect to be maid of honor. None of this ‘bridesmaid’ bullocks.”
to oversee reconstruction. If you or any of your people are interested in a government position, you need only express it.”
“Why the hell would you put spinach dip in the science microwave?!”
Then he wondered if he was already losing his mind.
(See the end of the chapter for
The King nodded. “Sir Watson, make your case.”
When he came to, Sherlock was struggling to his feet, watching in awe as Moriarty began aging rapidly, bright white Magic surging around him. Slowly, slowly, Magic dissipated, leaving John, once again, terribly and totally alone.
“Oh, what is it with everybody?” Sherlock spun around and stalked towards Irene, a murderous glare on his face. “I don’t have any reaction, or I have too much of a reaction. Where’s the middle ground? Where am I supposed to stand?”
Sherlock’s eyes widened. “A
Another shrug. “Because
Sherlock let out a surprised laugh as the dragon scowled.
“Like I’ve dated every guy, girl, and anyone in between on campus,” John explained. “I haven’t.”
"What do you want me to do?" John asked.
"And who's he?"
“What does that
“How’s little Ford?” Sherlock asked, biting into the fruit. “I assume that’s where you were yesterday, yes?”
“Your Magic won’t work on me.”
John gently removed the weapon from Sherlock’s blood-covered hands. The prince offered no resistance, wrapping his arms around John the moment his hands were free. His whole body shook with the force of his sobs. John’s heart broke for him.
Magic buzzed urgently around John, and he set his jaw, gritting his teeth angrily.
“But I’m the one with the brain,” she said, sending a halfhearted glare at her brother. “Now,
“Thank you,” he said quietly, popping one pill in his mouth and handing John the bottle. “Where’d you find that?”
kill him.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes, cocked his head, and found nothing but truth in John’s words.
“Can’t really be bothered, no,” he replied, a small smile playing at his features.
“Calves.” At Sherlock's confused look, John added, “Can't a bloke not like his calves?”
“Listen to Mary. But she’s gone now.”
“Father, I-”
“So you’re… not gonna try to kill us?”
Sherlock looked up at him, surprise evident on his angular features. “I’ve never dated Greg.”
“Your wife tells the truth,” Sarah argued. “You’re extraordinary, love.”
Moriarty’s Magic was cold, like ice water dumped over his head. It crept up on Sherlock like a surprise, and its cold fingers wrapped around his legs, forcing him closer and closer to the edge of the window. Moriarty’s laughter rang in his ears, and Sherlock took a deep breath as his feet met open air.
Sherlock
“She won’t.”
"You can fight him."
Mycroft shook his head, and Sherlock gasped.
The capital of Northumberland was a bustling castle town that surrounded the King's Palace, which was made of gleaming marble and built on cobblestone courtyards. It reminded Sherlock of his own home, though his was smaller, more welcoming, and infinitely more preferable to the monstrous building before him.
Her husband, looking just as confused as she felt, stared at Violet with wide silvery eyes.
in love,” Sherlock insisted, “and I am
“And I you, Lin.”
“I’m not on anything,” he said finally, “and I regret ever talking to you in the first place.
“Technically, I'm seventy-four.”
"You idiot! It's the middle of winter. You'll catch a cold in this."
“Nothing, really,” Irene replied. “Might get a bit lonely. We could’ve stayed in and watched cheesy movies if you’d said something before I had the party idea.”
"Morning," John mumbled, stretching his good arm over his head. "How's your leg?"
“What? No. No parties,” Sherlock blurted, sitting up so fast he nearly toppled off the sofa.
On the cusp of twenty years old, John was irreparably broken. He already knew that he was a disappointment to the village; he needn’t have been reminded by everyone who crossed his path.
"Van Coon," hissed the other guard, the fat on his neck jiggling as he shook his head, "you oughtn't talk like that!"
"What do you want with the King?" the taller one asked, his thin eyebrows drawing together.
As the bird soared through the dark night sky, it let out a single mournful call.
John was welcome to the strategy room, but he quickly realized his opinions didn’t carry the same weight as Shan’s or Sherlock’s. He supposed it was for good reason, but he was willing to bet his battlefield experience matched Sherlock’s and Shan’s combined.
Violet gasped, lurching to her feet.
“And who are you?”
“I’m aware.”
A calloused hand closed over John’s mouth, and his feet were swept out from under him. He struggled against the arms pulling him backwards, pathetically reaching out to Sherlock. The prince, having met a similar fate, reached back.
“Yes. I’ve always got you.”
something. Not Sher
“No, I can’t do that. She doesn’t know I’m gay.”
“You’re right. You said you were a prince, and we’ve all heard about what the King’s middle son could do. Can do.” The man let out a heavy sigh. “I believe you are who you claim to be. I can’t say that for the rest of New Scotland, but they trust me. And, God help me, now I’m trusting you.”
Well, he
Sherlock didn’t seem to hear him.
“Sherlock?” John prompted, his heart in his throat.
“Yes, you’ve seen quite a bit of the royal family,” he muttered.
"No."
“Obviously.”
“Oh, Sherlock’s in?”
because it was tedious and boring being all by himself. He was much like Sherlock in that regard; neither of them could stand boredom for long. It’s just that they chose to alleviate that boredom differently.
“It is
Irene said nothing, her hands shaking.
“We don’t have any money.”
Sherlock’s name had barely left his lips before he was on his knees, his whole body revolting. His organs were pulled from his torso, his muscles twisted painfully, his skin burned with a brand all over. John let out a pitiful yell, his eyes closed tightly. His only comfort seemed to be that Moriarty was in more pain than he was.
“Why would I stay?” she questioned. A guilty look passed over John’s face, and Irene sighed. “You don’t trust me. Don’t worry, John. I don’t blame you.”
“Since I first saw her. Does Zhi Zhu know about the other men?”
The taller man shot a weak glare at the back of Irene’s head.
His older brother looked up, scaly eyebrows furrowed.
“But Moriarty-”
This arrow, like the last, did not miss. It pierced the bird’s skin with sickening accuracy, causing the other three to begin their wailing all over again. It would have been over then had the magpies not come after him again.
“Of course, I said I wouldn’t tell the King and Queen, so I can’t imagine he’ll be too happy with me after he’s caught.”
“I guess I understand,” John replied. “I’d hate to have Harry show up here.”
“Can you?”
Sherlock probably shouldn’t have been speaking to himself; it would only isolate him further, wouldn’t it? He probably should’ve been worried that he couldn’t find it within himself to care.
, and the smell of smoke filled the air.
John limped through his dreary town, an empty wicker basket balanced on one hip. In his free hand was his cane. He took the shortest way home, not bothering to breath in the clean outside air. He would get plenty of it on the way to the prince’s tower.
Sherlock’s cheeks turned an attractive shade of pink, and he said, “You
(It's good to be back!)
“Is it still a fair fight?” Sherlock whispered, and John bit his thumb to keep from laughing.
“No, the one in Ireland,” Sherlock mocked. “Yes, the one you met!”
“Mate!” a gruff voice called. Mycroft wanted to die. He didn’t turn around, even as the voice continued, “I know it’s nearly spring, but it’s not warm enough for this.”
Kind of a short chapter this time, but I still hope you enjoyed it!
Still smiling away, Mycroft grabbed Sherlock in one huge paw and leapt into the air. The younger prince shivered as cold wind rushed past him and screamed as Mycroft threw him back into the tower through the window he’s been forced out of. He landed in an embarrassing heap in front of Moriarty, who sat in his throne like nothing had even happened. Sherlock hated him.
The prince let out an exasperated laugh and shook his head, his chest warm.
“I really must-”
“It was Moriarty,” she replied, her voice hoarse. “It must have been. You saw what he did to Sherlock. Oh- Oh,
“Well,” John began, taking a deep breath, “since you asked. Some sort of distraction to attract the attention of the Londoners not under Moriarty’s spell could gain us more support; we outfit those who want to fight with weapons and help get the others to safety - children and the elderly, you know.”
Irene shrugged. “Still good to know.”
Sherlock flung the door open. “He’s what?”
Leave a kudos or a comment if you wanna make my day. It means more than you can imagine (if you're also a writer of fanfic, you know what I'm talking about).
“Come on, Mike.”
“So-”
“Rude to host a party and not invite
“I’m stalling.”
“Mary just tried to kill both of us,” John replied. Irene cracked her knuckles. “And Irene’s still here.”
“Only the ones you were awake for count,” Shan replied, smiling sweetly.
The knight shook his head. “They’ll kill me.”
Magic buzzed around him, so loud that he couldn’t even entertain the idea of falling back asleep. It danced around him carelessly, suffocating him, leaving him in further darkness. Magic shouted and screamed and cried as more and more tears escaped from John’s eyes, never stopping, never resting, never letting up for just
but he preferred not to think about his hesitations too much. He could barely ignore the shame burning in his belly whenever he kissed Sherlock or even thought of him affectionately, and his heart grew heavy when he acknowledged the very real possibility that Sherlock would get tired of him after London was restored and send him back to Lauriston. John’s heart, of course, would stay in Central London with Sherlock, were it would gather dust on some abandoned shelf in the prince’s study or, if he was lucky, be used as a paperweight.
sorry,” John apologized again. “Do you mind if I…?”
not hopeless.”
The King considered them for a few moments before speaking.
"I'll see you again, Sherlock Holmes."
The man just laughed. “That’s brilliant. Are you all right? Tired or hungry or something like that? You’ve been a dragon for half a century.”
The boy seemed to agree, for he took off running faster than John or Sherlock could say another word. John laughed softly at the retreating figure before turning to Sherlock, a wondrous look on his face.
He turned to Sherlock, who looked as if he hadn’t slept in days. John’s heart ached to look at his bloodshot eyes and gaunt-looking face.
“What results did you want?”
“Don’t you like playing the game?” Sherlock asked innocently, raising his longsword.
refused to help me!”
Sherlock nearly vibrated out of his skin. “Don’t you?”
Sherlock shrugged. “Sebastian’s never liked me since then. Not that he liked me before.”
The prince cast her a small smile before looking at John. “Help me up, will you?”
~*~*~
“I do.”
As if he were handling glass, John began surveying Sherlock for injuries. Other than a nasty bump on his head and an angry gash on his bicep, there seemed to be nothing obviously wrong with the prince. He sighed, dug into his medical kit (an army doctor until the end), and manhandled Sherlock into a bandage.
“It doesn’t matter. Caring is, at its very best, a disadvantage.”
Slowly, John shook his head.
"I think we can work something out," the man said, very obviously raking his eyes up and down Sherlock's frame.
"A friend, yeah," the knight repeated. His eyebrows knit together. "What do you mean, the King's son wasn't kind to you?"
“I can’t help that the microwave exploded!” Sherlock protested.
Sherlock sighed. “Why is adultery so common in our line of work?”
“You’re not from New Scotland,” the man interrupted.  “I know every person in this town. We both do. So who are you and what do you want? Why are you here?”
Unedited, (super) short chapter.
prince. Plus, the first time I saw you, you were in your pants and stockings. Doesn’t really make for an imposing picture.”
setup!”
They stood there, in the middle of the marble hallway, staring at each other, daring the other to speak. John couldn’t help but take in Sherlock’s change in wardrobe. Instead of Mike’s old clothes, Sherlock wore a polished blue vest and tight black trousers that really left nothing to the imagination. His face was smooth, and his curls were clean and meticulously fluffed. He looked at home here in the castle, and once again John felt shame creep up on him for doing no more than be himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No,” he breathed, shaking his head. He backed away from both of them, his hands held in front of him like an offering. A sharp laugh escaped his lips. “No, you can’t be. They’re dead. The princes. They have to be. They can’t have survived.”
“London’s always been ruled by the Moriarty line.”
“Certainly not,” Mycroft huffed, his voice hoarse from disuse. “I’m quite aware this is not the time to be nude. I have been divested of my clothing against my will.”
John could’ve scoffed at his own dramatics. Instead, he’d gently pushed Sherlock off him and reminded him to do those exercises to strengthen the muscles in his hands.
Mike shrugged. “Well, no. No, he set out to find the prince.”
The girl stood still, watching Sherlock with steady brown eyes.
No sooner had they decided to leave than the ornate ballroom doors burst open, Hawkins standing there, his sword drawn, surrounded by a small number of London’s knights.
The tall guard scowled. John raised his chin and crossed his arms, waiting for him to allow them entry. The knight's whole body tensed when Sherlock leaned forward and whispered something in Van Coon's ear.
It was morning when Irene woke, gagging, the taste of blood and leather heavy on her tongue. Her fingers and toes were stiff, and her nails were blue. She waited for the familiar burning sensation to bloom over her chest and save her from a frozen grave, but none came.
The pair stood in front of the castle, staring down the guards with great determination.
try), John couldn’t stop his eyes from catching on Sherlock’s lips, delicately shaping each word.
For the second time is as many nights, John witnessed the death of the beautiful prince.
“Ta.”
“Mate, I’m not sure you’re in your right mind,” Greg cut in, laughing mirthlessly. “You or your friend.”
The face - for it was only that - belonged to a girl no more than seventeen. She had wide brown eyes that followed Sherlock’s every move. Her expression gave away no emotion, not any thoughts nor pressure points. Her skin looked to be as grey as the stone tower itself.
been in the running for the throne. Mycroft exceeded any and all expectations set upon him. Sherlock had not. He thought he would never have to deal with this sort of thing, and especially not so soon. He thought of his room in the castle, books piled high on his desk and on his bookshelf and on every available spot on the floor. What good would that do him now?
The dragon growled, showing off pointed yellow teeth, and restarted its tapping.
“Yeah,” John agreed. “You’ll have to tell me all about it.”
~*~*~
“Stop it!”
He felt like a coward, but at least he was a self-satisfied coward. At this rate, his infatuation would be gone just in time for Irene’s dull little party.
“Wishful- Wow. Um, all right then. Yes.”
it, Harry. You ask favors,” John replied easily. He gathered what supplies he thought he would need for the journey - mostly medical - and brushed past Harry on the way out of the pantry. “That’s not the answer to the question I asked you.”
“Sherlock!”
John only shrugged. “I don’t think so. I just had a dream-”
Deciding that maybe he should get dressed before Irene dragged him into the sitting room by his ear, Sherlock set aside his laptop, tugged on a binder, and changed his pants, not bothering to close his  half-open bedroom door. No one walked down that hallway unless they needed to get to a bedroom, which no one would need to do, so he figured he was relatively safe.
"Really?"
The prince paused, gazed at the cross knight, and recoiled, genuinely shocked.
Greg nodded. “They would’ve killed us if they could.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened for just a second before narrowing once again. “You’ve been following me?”
It was a blur of feathers and endless drone of flapping wings and rattling song. The magpies’ sharp claws barely made a mark on John’s sturdy jacket, but the exposed skin of his face and hands remained vulnerable to every scratch, scrape, gash, and tear the birds inflicted upon him. They screeched as they attacked, aiming for his eyes and ears, relentless in their anger. Never straying far from their target, the birds flew high into the air and plummeted back down upon the knight, using both their weight and gravity against him.
“I’m really fine,” Sherlock replied. “My body is merely transport.”
Seeing Sherlock around campus (and maybe getting to talk to the other man for once) was normally the highlight of John’s week. No, the only problem was that John
“Funnily enough, I did.”
Suddenly, a smoke alarm sounded. John and Sherlock jumped apart and dashed out of the room They were still in the hallway when they heard Irene start screaming.

Mycroft felt a smile pull at his lips.
Correction: There were

“You killed him.”
John nodded once and, without another word, went to dispose of Victor Trevor. There was a scuffle and some shouting and the slamming of a door, and Sherlock deduced (quite easily) that Victor was gone. A few moments passed before Irene stormed down the hallway, followed closely by John. They stopped in front of the bathroom door.
