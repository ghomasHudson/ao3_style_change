"Oh, I think you can do better than that," he taunted, twisting his hips to hit just the right spot inside me. I gasped and pushed back on him, trying to make him hit that spot again. He pulled out.
"I'll see you tonight, then," I said, walking out of the cafeteria to my motorcycle. I drove home and changed out of my school clothes, which were about as dorky as they could be; a white button down with a sweater vest, and khakis. Someone knocked on the door. I walked down, in a white undershirt and my khakis.
"Oh, so we have to kiss to get through, I get it," I said, "No biggie." I pulled him to me and kissed his lips.
"O-okay," he stuttered, thrusting slightly into my mouth.  I sighed and stood up, putting my mouth on his ear.
"Damn," he moaned. I pull up and did it over and over again until he was trembling. I scraped my teeth along the base, teasingly.
"I'm ready," I muttered. He pulled his fingers out and I whined at the loss, but soon enough, his head was pushing in. He pushed in until he was fully seated, and waited. My eyes squeezed shut, tears pricking in the corners of them.
"No, Steve. I have no idea what's going on," he answered, pushing at it as well. He glanced up and busted a gut, laughing.
"Yes," I said, firmly, then sank back down. I continued with the slower than molasses pace of unbuttoning his pants, but then Tony gripped my hair.
"I have got absolutely no idea, but make me do it again," I stated. He smirked and leaned down, biting a bit harder. I let out the same noise, just a bit louder. He made his way down my chest, biting and sucking marks into my unfairly pale skin, and to my stomach. He traced the lines of my abs with his tongue and I shivered again
"Steve, trust me. I can take it. I have a lot of experience," he smirked, then swallowed me back down.
"Jesus, that music is loud," I groaned, taking off my helmet. I took her helmet and we walked in. I kept my head down as she dragged me through the sea of people.
"I'll be back in a bit," she said. She left and I got in the shower. When I got out, she was sitting on my bed with bags surrounding her.
"I came to help you get ready. You aren't wearing anything like your normal clothes to the party," she said. I sighed and let her in.
"Alright," I sighed again and slid the boots on. She left to my bathroom with a red dress in her hand and changed. She came out in a short, sleeveless dress, that hardly covered her rear end, and red high heels.
"How the fuck do you look so damn innocent when I'm literally fucking your mouth?" He panted. I just batted my eyes again and he came with a shout down my throat.
"Well, I'd certainly like for there to be a next time, what about you?" He asked, looking at my face.
"Positive," he stated, grabbing my wrist and pulling me to the empty desk. He pushed me against it and set his hands on my hips, keeping me in place. He pressed his lips to mine, possessively and ran his tongue along my lower lip. I didn't open my mouth and he pulled away.
"Let's go," I said, trying to walk through the doorway again. I still couldn’t go through; and Tony was still laughing.
"Shh, we're almost there," he said. I sighed and he opened the door to a large walk-in closet to what I assumed was a guest room. He pressed his lips on mine again and I pulled away.
"Well, it was damn good," he smirked. "Now, it's your turn." He pushed me backwards and kneeled over me, taking me into his mouth as soon as he had my pants down.
"Harder!" I moaned. He slammed into me and I moaned. Our moans and the sound of skin slapping on skin were the only noises in the room. He pounded relentlessly into me, hitting that special bundle of nerves dead on with every thrust.
"For fuck's sake, Tony, I want you to fuck my mouth," I growled, biting his ear. I pulled away and he stared at me,
"T-then why are you always jerking off? If I was enough, you'd come to me," I said, my voice shaking more than I would have wanted it to be.
"Fine," I sighed, grabbing the black outfit. I got dressed, struggling with the tight jeans. I slid the band tee over my head and stepped out of the closet.
"Well, then we don't have to do anything you're not comfortable with Steve," he said, taking a step so he was against me again.
"Tony," I moaned. He moaned around me as I pulled on his hair and I slowly bucked up, involuntarily.
"Well, knowing that I'm the only one who can make you feel that good, is hot as fuck," he smirked, then took back into his mouth.
"Tony, we're locked in your lab, and you're laughing? What amuses you about this situation?" I asked.
"Oh, yeah, here," he smiled, leaning over the side of the bed. He came back with an unopened bottle.
"O-okay," I said, still unsure. He started moving back and forth against me, not actually putting any pressure between us, which I was grateful for, I didn’t know if I could handle the embarrassment if he did. I slowly started swaying with him and closed my eyes. He put his hands on my hips pulled me closer to him, grinding against me. My eyes shot open and I blushed a bright red colour, my eyes searching for Bucky or Peggy. I couldn't find them, so I just rolled with it.
"Cool," I smiled as he finished my suit I grabbed it and we both walked to the doorway. We walked through it together, but we couldn’t actually get out of the door way.
"Damnit," he breathed. He looked down at me and turned around, grabbing a tissue from god knows where and wiped my face down.
"I love you, too, Tony," I whispered ack and he pulled away to pull my shirt off. I smiled at him as he traced a line down my side to my hips and he smiled back. He leaned back in for a kiss and I wrapped my arms around his neck.
I've been with Tony for a little over a year now, and I'm happy. Well, mostly happy. Lately. I've noticed that Tony has been... oh, shoot, what's the word? What is it called now-a-days? -oh! Yeah. Jerking off a lot lately. I'm starting to think he's becoming bored with me. I'm not a virgin, definitely not, and I know he isn't either, so maybe he just doesn't want to have sex with me. Maybe I'm just not good enough for him. He hasn't ever confronted me about the topic, so I figured that must be the reason; I'm not good enough. I knew I wanted it, but I guessed he didn’t, so I asked him or talked to him about it. That was possibly the biggest mistake I've ever made with him.
"Relax, Steve, it'll get better," he assured. I nodded, knowing it would. As I said before, I had done it before, but it's been a while. He slowly pumped in and out, and, when he felt I was ready, he added a second, I winced, but soon adjusted. He added a third not long after and I squeezed my eyes shut. A few minutes later, I was on the verge of desperate.
"Who says I was asking?" I asked. I slid to my knees and traced the bump in his trousers. He visibly shivered and I smirked to myself. I popped the button on his way-too-tight jeans and pulled them down, his boxers following suit. I licked the head and took him in. He moaned, grabbing a fistful of my hair. I took him deeper with each bob of my head. He gripped my hair tighter and I looked up at him through my eyelashes with my most innocent-looking, blue eyes. He stared into my eyes for a moment before I smirked around and swallowed him whole.
"Please," he whispered. I smirked and pulled both his pants and boxers down to mid-thigh. My eyes widened at his much-larger-than-average size, and I smirked up at him before licking at the tip, just barely touching it. He gasped, his hand still resting in my hair and he bucked forward.
"I love you, too, Tony," I whispered back. Shortly after, his breathing even out as he fell asleep. I fell asleep not long after, feeling extremely happy, knowing that I was, in fact, enough for the love of my life.
"I can’t believe we have to have sex in your lab! Where would we even do it? There is literally only one surface available, and that can’t be very-" I stopped my words when I saw his eyes darken.
"Okay, now kiss me," I laughed as he rolled his eyes, playfully and leaned back down. He slowly but surely made his way down to my neck, and bit softly. I made a noise that sounded like a mix between a gasp and moan, an arched up.
"Okay," he drawled, gripping my hair in both hands and thrusting gently and shallowly into my mouth. At least, that's what he was doing at first. Eventually, he was forcing himself all they down my throat, making me choke a bit. I looked up at him like before, batting my eyes.
"What do you mean, Steve? Of course, you're good enough for me," he said, turning on his side to face me, "You're more than good enough." I still didn't turn to face him.
"Positive," I smiled down at him. That seemed to be all he needed as he pulled the pants down, along with my boxers. He situated himself between my legs and I sat up to help him out of his boxer shorts. I have never been so happy about how little clothing he sleeps in. He opened the bottle and squirted some onto his fingers, warming it up. He came up to my face and kissed me, slow and hard. His finger probed my finger and pushed in, and I gasped, my eyes shutting.
"You don't have to do this, especially if you aren’t ready. Are you sure about this, Steve?" He asked.
"Fuck!" he shouted, yanking on my hair. I moaned, which sent vibrations through Tony. He bucked into my mouth and I choked a little. My eyes widened.
"Ugh. Fine," I sighed, walking to my walk-in closet. I stepped in and took the clothing out of a bag. A pair of black skinnies, and a black band tee. No thanks. Next: a pair of maroon skinnies with a white and blue stripped tee. Possibly.
"Yes," he said, starting to push me towards him. Bucky was always stronger than me. He shoved me into him.
"Blame it on that damn mouth of yours. You know, you're kinkier than I thought you were," he smirked.
"Fine! I'll go! On one condition: anyone who tries to touch me that's drunk, I'm gone, and calling the cops to rat you guys out," I said.
"Yep," he smirked, swinging the curtain shut again. He walked back over to me and mouthed at my ear.
"I want to show you just how much you mean to me," he stated. He pushed our mouths together once more and I melted into it. His tongue slid along my lower lip, asking for entrance, which was, of course, immediately granted as I opened my mouth and his tongue slid inside. His tongue explored my mouth as his hands did the same to my body. They traced over my pecs, down to my abs and he traced every part of my six-pack with his fingertip and I shuddered.
"Your choice," he whispered. He grabbed my hips and forcefully spun me around, slamming my front down on the table. I moaned as his length pressed against my jeans-covered ass.
Tony didn’t actually have the choice, when the mother of his future child had screamed at him to get out after he may have had a mini panic attack hours ago.
“Emerson, Samantha was dying. From the drugs your father and I put into my system when I was pregnant with her. She was in pain, having withdrawals. It’s why she was so fussy. Do you understand what I’m saying, Emerson?” she asked with a smile. Her mouth gaped open as she shook her head a little in disbelief.
"Trust me, I would much rather visit the country of sexy and gorgeous men and women...with you, of course," the taller man joked as Peter rolled his eyes in fondness. "I love you and your family, but this is something that can't wait," he said a little more seriously. Peter eyed the man, thinking it over as he asked his love.
.” Tony gave her a weird look at that, the teen suddenly realizing how that must’ve come across to him. She quickly reached a hand out and rested it on his arm.
“Of course we’re not, doll. Steve is a freak of nature! Soulmates are destined by the universe to find each other. We did that without destiny getting in the way, You know why? Cause the universe doesn’t decide our fate. We do. I love you with every part of my being, Clint.”
“- you’ve seen her every night for the past two weeks, I think she can manage one night without you. Tony and I are going on a date night and you’ll stay here and watch the bunch.”
“What about someone like Obadiah? Someone that knows Howard?” Steve asked just as the baby in the high chair started crying. Mrs. Rhodes left to go take care of her while the two teens stood there looking at each other.
“I already think of you as one of my own, Tony, I hope you know that. And I’ll be proud to call you a son in law...in seven to ten years…” Tony could only chuckle, especially when he heard Steve groan behind them. “How about some pizza for dinner?” Joe asked with a smile as Tony suddenly became confused.
"-In your sleep brother. I will slit your throat in your sleep and be forced to take the crown. How could you do that to me? I am not ready to be Queen, I am only twenty one years old! How selfish are you to make me do such a thing?" she asked as both Tony and Steve laughed aloud. T'Challa waved her off as he led the group to the dining area, Shuri following - openly avoiding the fathers - as she continued with her death threats.
“That’s Mister Doctor Professor Red Condom, Esquire to you cockeye,” the masked man said…with a familiar voice.
Peter and Miles had picked out a traditional Wakandan outfit, giggling as their Dad took pictures of them. All of this was wonderful, but it really nagged the genius that he couldn't figure out what had happened between Steve and Barnes. His husband had been acting weird since they were initially alone together and was avoiding Tony to explain why, further evident when he and his daughter veered off to look at the art gallery near the shopping center.
“How did you...where did you even get him?” Clint asked, still in somewhat of a daze as he gently put the puppy back on the ground.
He settled the two more comfortably on the bed before placing the screen in front of them. He smiled when she shifted only slightly, settling in as he found one of their home movies. It was the one where she learned to walk – one of his personal favorites – as she let out a laugh before the two sat in comfortable silence.
Some time later he was beginning to nod off and decided now was a good stopping point, checking the time to see it was a little after five am. Normally he would just down a pot of coffee and continue, but he had a meeting at seven that Pepper had threatened castration over should he miss it.
“I’m not a woman either, dipshit. Doesn’t mean I won’t stand up for them against scrawny little assholes like you. I suggest you and the rest of your fuckboy band, get the fuck out of here,” he finished in almost a whisper.
He heard the ding from the elevator as he moved to pour himself a cup of coffee, turning to smile as Rhodey entered the kitchen. The man smiled as he walked past him to pour himself a cup, remaining silent until he joined Tony on the other side of the kitchen island.
“Cut the bullshit, Donald. I know what you’re doing to my kid, and I’m here to tell you it stops right fucking now.” The disheveled man scoffed before responding.
“What’d that cunt say?” Tony asked quietly. Steve pushed him off his lap in offense, the brunette smiling and grumbling in protest.
“I kind of like watching Morgan pat your face,” she said with a smile, which made Clint frown, which made Morgan laugh with delight, which made the smile on Daci’s face that much bigger.
The brunette scoffed at his question, replying “what do you think?” turning back to the blonde to show the bags under his eyes. Steve sat with him at the table. Neither spoke for a long moment.
“You don’t get to decide who I date, Daciana. You have no say in my love life,” the man growled out, barely stamping down the fury boiling up inside telling him to attack to get
"Of course, I should let you and your family settle in. If you will excuse me," Shuri said with a little bow, luckily turning away before she could see Emerson try to bow in return; earning an actual snort from her father. She quickly turned around to glare at him, which only made him laugh harder. Her Pop saved her, walking over to them giving her Dad and older brother
“Well well, what do you think? Should I make her kill you slowly or take you out quickly so she can get to the other Avengers?” Bucky glared up at Strucker, not even sure his kid would wake up let alone have the energy to keep fighting her family.
“Please? Just let me go to sleep,” she whined when Steve reached a hand out to gently grab her arm. His husband didn’t initially let her go, carefully helping her wrap the blanket fully around herself and rest on her shoulders when she was failing to do so.
“Tony…” he heard his husband whisper. But before he could convince him otherwise, Tony strode off to the elevator to call Pepper. He didn’t notice the teenage girl hiding behind a bookshelf on his way out.
"Wade I thought you were good at this game?" she asked smugly as she high-fived her little brother in congratulations.
Steve waited until they left before vaulting himself over his husband to finally claim his spot on the couch. Tony stared at him, confused and disappointed. “Wait, what? No encore? You’re such a tease, Rogers.”
“Beloved, can you get my med kit from the kitchen drawer?” Steve looked at Joey while he asked, frowning at seeing her look down at the implication.
“I haven’t shared a heat with him yet! It can’t be possible, right?” he asked after showing Bruce the very stick he had just recently peed on. And the doctor noticed as well, leaning away from him as the two sat in Banner’s lab.
. His face scrunched up in a hurt and confused way as she realized she needed to better explain herself.
“If you guys fill up on Uncle Miles then you won’t have any room for ice cream,” his Dad said in a sing-song voice as he stood up off the couch. The arachnid sent a glare to both his parents, since the blonde one was currently molesting the brunette.
“It’d be kinda weird though…” Bucky added, disrupting Steve’s train of thoughts as he looked at the brunette with hope.
“Sure,” she said with a shrug of her shoulders, still getting rid of the sleepiness as she watched him walk to the bathroom. After she took her own turn in the bathroom, the two made their way to the elevator and up to the Starks’ floor.
Turns out, there were a lot of agents between them and the middle. And even when they eventually got there, she was still apparently behind a heavy door as he watched the Hulk attempt to break it down. Bullets continued whizzing by but his only focus was on getting his girl back.
"Oh, okay. I see how it is! I can give you one of my kidneys, but go run and hug the super soldier? That's fine. Whatever, not like I matter, right?" At that moment Tony joined the group in the kitchen, laughing along with the other three at their daughter's silly antics.
"We should probably go to sleep, huh? In case she wakes up and needs us?" the brunette asked as they walked together to their bedroom. Steve stopped rather dramatically, looking at the genius incredulously.
“The day I turned eighteen I moved out and in with my boyfriend. And once I told him what had happened, he treated me like a wounded animal. Tried to get me to talk to him before I was ready while also trying to get into my pants before I was ready…”
“Don’t call our children ‘parasites,’ Tony,” his husband said with an eye roll, though he didn’t move to separate the two.
“What if you read to her?” Bucky suggested. Steve rolled his eyes as he saw Joey sit up at that, turning to the blonde.
“You purchased this,” Steve said aloud, shaking the thing and looking up at the man biting his bottom lip.
“You sure you don’t want a paternity test?” the two began laughing again at the implication, Tony shaking his head.
“I wouldn’t get too excited, mostly I’m curious as to why now,” she said bluntly. Carolyn’s eyes narrowed a little before she put a smile back on her face. The waitress came back to take their order, Joey hastily picking a burger and fries to be safe.
When he opened the door, Tony was waiting in bed for him. He was looking over his tablet and smiled at the man when he entered the room.
“Laugh it up, buttercup,” he said without looking at her. She knew there wasn’t anything behind his anger, catching him smiling from time to time. They waited in silence the rest of the way, still remaining silent as Sam led the way to the closest exit on the ground floor. She smiled at his childish antics as she turned away from him once they were outside. There was a beautiful blooming tree with purple flowers she wanted to get closer to. She ignored Sam’s “hey!” as she continued walking.
She’s tied in a chair but her eyes and mouth aren’t bound and she licks her lips as her eyes find their intended target. The owner of the cologne smell and the man who experimented on her.
“–Miss Rogers-Stark, you will call her by her legal name.” Mr. Jefferson stole a glance at Joey before turning back to her Dad.
If he was being honest, he was mostly mad at himself for how jealous he was of the man. The incredibly good looking, obviously rich and apparently long-term partner of his husband. Thinking of that man touching him…
And when she reached the other side, she simply turned around and kept going. There were times she felt like she couldn’t breathe, but she kept her breaks short before persevering. She wasn’t sure how many laps she had made, losing track of time when she realized she was no longer alone. And she learned that from the feet dangling in front of her underwater. Pulling up out of the water and taking her goggles off, she saw her Pop sitting on the edge in front of her, smiling down at her.
“He’s going to be fine, surgery went well. Just needs some R&R and he’ll be back to his old self,” she assured.
Well, at least to Peter. To anyone else he was still his smart-ass self, currently wise cracking as the two walked up to the Tower to join the family for dinner and game night.
, Bucky mouthed to the blonde, for everything. Giving him a second chance, helping save his kid, snapping him out of HYDRA's hold, loving him...the list goes on and on.
Tony immediately straightened up and stared incredulously back at the super soldier, who only shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.
The man opened his mouth to reprimand and Tony almost flinched in anticipation - when a familiar voice suddenly interrupted the trio.
“I can help Barnes if you want to help Bruce to our floor?” Natasha offered Clint in a hushed tone, making Daci feel worse. She was tired of seeing Clint sad, tired more of her father being with the wrong person.
“Apa?” she asked the man, who finally tucked and rolled to face his kid. Steve turned towards her and let out a laugh, since the baby had her head on the ground and butt in the air.
time. So instead he dropped Harley off at Rhodey’s so they could go back to Tony’s after dinner. Steve chose an Italian restaurant and ended up with some marinara sauce on his chin that Tony restrained himself from licking off.
“FuckFace McNoStones flaked and had his secretary call Tony to tell him. Pup’s been at school waiting for an hour,” Steve explained, some of the anger returning to his voice. He could smell the change in his brother’s scent, anger leaking out of the other Alpha who nodded in approval.
“I can see that. Thank you for helping him. How about I make us some breakfast?” he asked as he got off the bed to change into more comfortable clothes and out of his uniform. She sat, frozen, contemplating whether or not to tell Steve and decided to, knowing he would find out either way.
Of course, Steve and Tony had noticed earlier that they liked each other earlier - they just thought it should be more organic.
“Uh huh,” their daughter said, inching even closer as the fathers shared a look and scooted back to give them room.
“Uh huh,” the super soldier replied, not really minding if that’s what they were doing. Steve started making eggs for breakfast, smiling as he remembered Emerson’s slight beam when Thor called her “niece.”
"What haircut, Steven?" the shorter man asked he remained standing, even as Steve and Miles made their way to the living room.
“Good,” he added quietly, “cause if that ever did happen again? I’d make sure you went to jail. And then I’d beat your ass once you got out. Doesn’t matter how old you are either.”
“I told Dad you guys have to sign a ‘no takesies-backsies’ document,” she said causing a chuckle from the blonde.
Their third date was at Steve’s apartment, the blonde insisting he cooked for the man – who sounded incredibly giddy over the phone at the prospect. Turns out it wasn’t even for the easy access to the bedroom…Tony confessed no one had ever cooked for him before. The thought made Steve sad, and so he made sure the man had dessert to go along with his meal.
“It’s okay, Stevie. I knew this was coming,” Tony said, telling the truth. “My parents are in Europe, they get notified when I haven’t accessed the mansion in a while,” he added, blatantly lying. “I just have to go home for a few days.”
“You ready to go home?” Steve asked with a smile to their girl. She nodded her head sleepily before raising her arms up at the blonde. His husband quirked a brow at her as Tony heard the doctor leave to give them some privacy.
Clint couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen Bruce interested in anything other than a science book...and now he was blushing around the Greek-God foreign exchange student?
“Nothing important,” he offered with a smile. She stared at him a moment longer, before dramatically rolling her eyes and wedging herself down further into the couch next to him.
Moving and standing in the now open doorway, he switched from awe to anger. Three pairs of eyes turned to him as he stepped into the room.
When he landed and exited into his home, he only stumbled once. Okay thrice. One drink wouldn’t do this though… his anxiety was kicking into over drive. Nope. Nope, not the time for a panic attack, the genius thought to himself. He stopped when he got to the kitchen, glad the kids weren’t anywhere in sight. He regulated his breathing, going over his normal grounding techniques while taking exaggerated breaths.
But he didn’t need to worry about that now. Not only had he raised Harley by himself for six years, but he may have found someone that he could
He put his phone back down to keep signing these documents Pepper had threatened if he didn’t finish today. He glanced back at his phone, reading the message from Peter before going back to work.
He suddenly realized they were thinking the same thing, as the picture was of a young man with shaggy brown hair holding a baby. Bucky.
Emerson smiled at that, even if that was a lot people, she was never one to turn down Sam’s cooking.
He shared a smile with his husband before grabbing some of the blanket to cuddle further under. Tony pushed some of the hair out of her face before loudly kissing her cheek. Her giggles turned to groans when he then leaned up to kiss his husband on the lips.
She could feel her hair blow in the breeze, tickling her cheek as she felt a smile spread across her face.
She hadn't seen Shuri since her adoption party and she wasn't even sure the woman would remember her, let alone think of her anything other than her friend's little sister. She didn't even know if the princess liked women! For all she knows she's been anxious for nothing, the woman probably has a prince she's going to marry.
Their kids both hung their heads, not looking directly at the angry parents. Bruce looked at the fathers, a hint of disappointment on his face.
“Harley…” Tony said sadly, heart breaking a little from his son’s reaction. There were even tears forming in his pup’s eyes as he practically snarled at the two.
squeeze up in his chest again, the pain of seeing her in pain hurting the man. He wrapped his arms around her protectively and squeezed her close to his chest as she stayed curled around herself.
“Long haul,” he said in agreement, bringing his hand up to caress his husband’s face. He stroked his thumb along his cheekbone as he looked deep into blue eyes, momentarily contemplating if it was possible to ever
It wasn’t long before the other Avengers showed up, carrying with them the pizza boxes Tony had ordered. She continued watching the group in silence, taking Morgan’s spot on her Tati’s lap when the baby moved to sit with her Papa. After a while the Stark children grew tired and were taken to bed, but the others remained joyfully exchanging stories in the living room until Steve and Tony came back.
"I saw him kill like a million guys! Just chopped them up with his swords!" the little boy explained as he put more food in his mouth.
“Come on Petey-pie,” the blonde said again, finally able to pull the little koala bear off his Daddy long enough to bring him up into a hug. Steve stood up with him, giving her a second to see Tony while the man comforted the tired kid. She felt Rhodey nudge her shoulder, encouraging her to get up and walk over to the hospital bed.
“I was just taking these to the kitchen, I’m not busy. What do you need help with sweetheart?” Steve asked as he gathered the rest of the dishes to take to the kitchen.
“I only survived because of pot and cheetos,” Clint scoffed out, immediately freezing when he realized what he said out loud.
“If you’re okay with it,” Steve began, “I’d like to see your back now.” She glanced at the blonde before giving another small nod. They don’t intend to hurt you. She stood up slowly, turned around and lifted her sweater up enough to reveal the scars. With her back turned to them, she couldn’t see their faces but did hear the small “oh, sweetheart” which she guessed came from Steve, since Tony loudly added a “holy fuck.” Embarrassed, she quickly put her sweater down before anything else could happen, turning around to sit on the bed again.
“You okay baby?” he asked Peter, frowning when the tears began to spill down his cheek, causing Steve to kiss the spot and bring the boy into a hug. When the boy shook his head no, Steve stood the two up, cradling the boy close. “I’m going to take Petey upstairs to get an ice pack. Nat you’re obviously in charge.”
Tony took a moment to glance at his husband, who was also smiling back at him, before enveloping her in a superhero sandwich.
Peter was on his best behavior as he carried the pillow down the aisle, smiling at the men who each kissed him on the cheek. Joey, being one of Steve’s groomsmen and also rocking a suit, pulled Peter back to stand by her, the two smiling at their parents.
“Yeah well…thanks. And I will,” he said with a blush as he watched his brother smile back at him before turning back to the kids’ snack.
“Um...pan-pansexual…” Bruce said, blushing and avoiding eye contact with Clint - who was desperately trying to make eye contact with him so he could tease him.
“I do. I really do Harley. You know how I’m your legal guardian? Well, I’ve been wanting to adopt you, but I wanted you to be okay with that first.”
[No I haven’t. But I can help you look. How about I pick you up from your place in 15 minutes? Been looking for a good reason to get out of this meeting early anyway…]
"You have to babe, you already promised her," Steve reminded him, ignoring the man's puppy dog eyes.
Flashlights shined on him and he opened his mouth to explain when men dressed in various uniforms stormed
“I was talking to Peter,” she said after handing Peter back over, laughing along with Peter at the silliness. “Bye baby,” she said one last time as she blew him a kiss goodbye.
He was drawing in the living room with Tony’s feet on his lap when she got home. The teen was momentarily thankful Peter was at his mom’s so she didn’t have to censor herself. She dramatically threw her backpack down on the couch to capture their attention. It worked, both men turning to her in confusion.
“Um, were you there? Maybe a stegosaurus got hot and went for a swim?” Steve asked, loving the affront looked from his son. The pup looked back to the Omega, who was only beaming at the two, suddenly remembering his son was looking for his input.
Again, he felt terrible…horrible and incredibly guilty. Not only was he keeping a huge secret from his dads but he had also roped his sister into keeping the secret. She hadn’t seemed to mind when he talked to her in private later, more curious about his powers and abilities. But she didn’t deserve any weight of his guilt.
“We discovered we have a soulmate bond,” Steve clarified, loving not only the change in atmosphere from hard to soft,  but the warmth of love he had for his mate. His soulmate.
She almost said the words aloud. How she felt selfish for wanting a mom to talk to when she was currently speaking with a kind mother-like figure. A woman who was simply her brother’s mother and owed this teenager nothing.
“Boring,” said with an exaggerated sigh Tony to make the kids laugh, though he wasn’t lying about the ‘boring’ part of budget meetings. He put Harley back on the ground before making his way over to sit by Daci, who looked zoned out. “Hey kiddo, you alright?”
“Hey Pete, why don’t we all go down to the gym and play until your dads get back?” she suggested with a smile, knowing Tony had sanctioned off a small corner for a jungle gym and swing set.
“You know Wade, your college girlfriend would probably be upset hearing that you’re crushing on my new sister.”
Now this man, this fucking man Steve was familiar with. Though he’s been dead nearly twenty years, Steve still wished he could bring that man back long enough to kick his ass for what he did to Tony.
“Yeah he’s just being a clingy leach today.” Daci wrapped her arms around Morgan as a thought popped into her head.
Again, how fucking selfish was she to want a mom when these two literally cleared their entire day to stay with her? She had already considered the possibility of having the ‘c’ word or at the very least a tumor…and knew she would just be a mess physically and emotionally today.
“Steve, say something bad about your husband. Show Bucky that in normal relationships you can say something negative about your partner, even your spouse,” the doctor said to Steve, confusing everyone but the genius’ further.
That he was going to lose him anyway...so maybe he should end it before he actually hurt the kind older teen.
“Yeah, I was thinking about that…” Peter began, smiling when Wade hung his head before continuing. “I thought of a few ways you could make it up to me…”
“Who’s here, Keisha?” Mrs. Rhodes asked, standing up from the table where the family was in fact eating dinner. There were two other girls sitting at the table, the youngest in a high chair.
“When Buck said that, he meant you should be grateful for the ones in your life that love you. Not that you shouldn’t open your heart up so others can love you too. And you, my sweet girl, have so many people that love you in this life and already think of you as family. Like May and Peter, Sam, Nat, Clint, Pepper, Rhodey…your Dad. And me. I love you so much Joey, and I would never be mad at you for wanting help or advice from someone that isn’t me or your Dad. I know I’m a stubborn ass but I also know my limitations when it comes to female anatomy.”
“I shouldn’t have said that,” he groaned out, “she didn’t need to know that – no matter how horrid that woman is…”
He couldn’t hear, but could see his Pappy teaching Harley how to properly punch. A memory surfaced as Steve drifted off for a moment.
“And what is wrong with checking in on you? Your wife was the one who made me promise to keep an ‘eye on her boo’,” the smug man said, even adding air quotes. It was a low blow, using her wife against her but it worked. Whatever, she was weak cause she missed Shuri. She wasn’t afraid to admit that.
“This way gentleman, our friend Jim suffered some burns and cuts from broken glass thanks to Mr. Can’t-hold-his-liquor!” she finished with a yell in the direction behind them as they stopped in front of the man sitting on the ground. Sam squatted down next to the patient as a loud slurred voice responded to the woman.
"Definitely best birthday ever," Steve said with a dopey grin, holding still as Tony continued drying him.
“That’s cause you’re a bigger baby about it than the teenager,” Rhodey said as he gave Sam another plus four after they reversed. Sam threw his hands up in frustration, only proving her Uncle Rhodey right.
The brunette quickly opened the box and handed his husband the second smaller box inside. The blonde opened his box finally looking away from his son, eyes and smile growing as he inspected the gift. His Dad straight up laughed, holding the mug to his chest as he bellowed. Emerson curiously looked before shuffling over the couch to sit next to their Pop; who leaned over to show her his mug.
Sure enough, a bearded blonde was photographed walking out of a Manhattan restaurant. A man Jo had never even heard of, but apparently was some millionaire named Tiberius Stone.
Wade apologized, which was a start. He also promised to temporarily hang up the suit to help out more around the house.
“Hey! I’ll make you a deal. You don’t talk about wanting to have sex with my parents, and I won’t talk about how
“No, of course not don’t be silly, come inside,” Tony said as he waved him in, shutting the door when Steve followed him inside.
Their aunts and uncles were fun, but sometimes you just wanted to be a kid. They spent about an hour at a playground by the movie theater before seeing the latest Dreamworks film. They had purchased popcorn and all kinds of candy, throwing a wink at his sister when she realized he had one of their dad’s credit cards.
“If that’s okay?” she asked quietly. Peter went to the car to open one of the doors for her, sliding in next to her.
“Come on Harley, sit with me till Daddy gets back and then we’ll watch Disney movies!” Peter said as he gently pulled his little brother onto his lap. Tony was able to get up and smiled at the group before making his escape, coming back a few minutes later.
"I'm really not. Look, have I not slept for the past four weeks? Sure. Has the stress of all of this given me a grey hair on my right temple? Perhaps. Am I in way over my head? You bet your skinny ass I am," he said, pausing when Steve genuinely laughed at that. "But I don't regret her, Stevie. As crazy as she drives me...I don't know how to explain it..." he trailed off as he smiled at his daughter - who was currently cuddled up against his chest.
“Alright! Well I didn’t know that…that’s fair.” He paused a moment, letting his smile fall when Sam turned back to the burgers.
“If we’re going to do this. And I mean…really do this” Steve had paused mid-make out session – the clever bastard – to be serious with him. “Then you have to cut down on the drinking. I won’t lose you to something stupid like liver disease.”
He got home late that evening, trying to squeeze a week’s worth of work into a day. At the very least it meant he could sleep in tomorrow.
“If he’s so busy, why is he here at the museum, with her?” the pup’s voice cracked at the end, prompting the Alpha to gently pull him from his shoulders and back into his arms. Hugging him close to his chest and guiding his bear’s head to his neck to scent.
“Pop!” she shouted, halting to a stop next to the father as she looked at the man behind him. Her eyes stayed glued to Wade, glaring daggers at him as she moved past Steve to the other man. Steve stole a glance at Peter who looked surprised at Emerson, before turning back to Emerson just as she swung her right arm to punch Wade directly in the face.
“Such a sap,” the man said fondly as he reached a hand up to stroke the taller man’s cheek. The hand then ran along down his chin before gripping tightly. “But if I ever find kale in my food, I will divorce you,” his man growled out. Steve only smiled back at him.
“Don’t focus on that, it’s ugly,” Tony said with a pout. Steve frowned and quirked a brow at him in confusion.
She was about to go yell at a man whose heart was literally hurting him – to the point that he needed surgery – for not telling her sooner.
“Here’s what’s going to happen. You’re going to hop in the shower while I brew you some coffee. Then, when Peter wakes up from his nap, you’re going to apologize to the three year old that cried himself to sleep worried about you. And then, you and I are going home so you can write me a three page essay on the dangers of underage drinking, okay?” he asked, not expecting an answer but did see her nod out of the corner of his eye.
The two had taken the pup on a walk to the park, Clint looking adorable as he matched his outfit with Lucky's purple collar and leash. Bucky brought a blanket and snacks for a picnic, just enjoying this kind of time together as he watched his boyfriend bond with their pup.
“She went to bed early,” Tony said with a frown. “Said she wasn’t feeling well. I think she had a bad day at school…” he said with concern. That wasn’t exactly a new occurrence for Jo. And it actually put the blonde’s mind at ease, knowing both kids were safe and home in bed. Where he and his husband should probably be heading to…
“Oh, okay. So you and Uncle Bucky are staying with us?” Daci nodded as she considered that word over and over again in her mind.
“Padres! PADRES! I think I’m good now,” she said laughing. “I’m really tired. It’s…4 am here. What time is it there?”
“Steve...did I ever tell you English wasn’t my first language?” Tony asked, causing the blonde to feel even more lost.
“Wha-who-how did you-who who told you that?” Steve sputtered adorably, hands going from his hips to cross his chest back to his hips. So cute.
“Daci Daci! Come see the lions!” Peter called out to her, making Daci spin around to see him waving over to her. She ran the few feet and stood next to Peter, staring in awe at the big cats.
“You’re lying,” he quickly snapped back, hands moving to his hips at the sheer amount of betrayal from these two.
“I can turn invisible!” Miles squealed in excitement, thrusting his hands up in the air. Peter stared at his stupid little brother, shaking his head and glaring at him.
Tony stayed behind to pay as Miles was allowed to rip all the tags off before running to join his father and sister's walk back to the palace. Peter stayed behind, still wearing his new outfit out of the store, but staying to give his Dad some company.
“Speaking of, I should probably head back,” the woman said with an apologetic smile. She leaned over and kissed her Tati’s cheek before turning her attention back to Daci. “It was great meeting you, I look forward to seeing you more often.” Daci remained silent as she watched the tall blonde leave, frowning when she saw the smile on her father’s face.
She waited a beat before answering, “I told you guys I didn’t want to talk about her, it feels like you guys don’t listen and just keep…poking into my past. I want to forget it, all of it. I don’t know why you guys find it amusing to continuously bring it up.”
His husband, Em happily noted, was not. Emerson continued smiling as her darker-haired father simply shrugged at his disgruntled son.
It was Joey, flailing on the ground with her eyes wide open. Tony recognized the symptoms of a seizure, cuddling the boy close as he cried, frightened over his new friend. He watched Steve help move her on her side, grabbing a nearby pillow to place under her head.
“Miles,” Peter said, closing his eyes in anger. A news story from a week ago suddenly popped into his head. “Wait...Osborn had an explosion at his mansion last week…” he trailed off, praying that his brother would deny or argue his point...but that little bastard just shrugged with a half-smile. “Are you fucking kidding me?”
Dammit, she hadn’t even thought of that. She knows her issues with dichotomy and didn’t consider just seeing her after the wedding. No pressure to put on a show in public with strangers. That thought relaxed her, hating herself for not thinking of that instead of going through a mental episode.
“I figured I owed you for springing myself on you like that,” he said sincerely as he let her go while they walked to his car.
“Where’s Clint?” Steve asked, wanting to change the subject and not have Bucky ask him for the upteenth time why he chose Tony.
“She broke her arm trying to win a bet,” she said with a brow raised. She continued talking when Joey still stared skeptically at her.
“No, no Harley Daddy isn’t mad at you bambino. I’m mad at Tiberius. Now, you’re not in trouble, but I need you to tell me what he said.” The Omega focused on tampering down his anger to hear his son out.
It’s not that he forgot, it’s just the meeting ran a little late so he wasn’t home until twelve fifteen. Which, in Tony’s book, is still a decent time.
"Peter, this is my little brother Miles. Miles, this is my big brother, Peter," she said with a smile.
They weren’t going to last like that, so why drag out the heartache when he could be the bigger man and end this all early? Well...not exactly be the bigger man...since he was avoiding his boyfriend and all.
“What do I…I don’t even know what to say to her…” he confessed looking into those beautiful brown eyes. Tony simply smiled at him, reaching to grab the blonde’s hand and intertwining their fingers together.
He walked a little around the block, knowing she’d occasionally sit out back under the tree. No one there either.
“Where the hell did you get that bottle?” he demanded, ignoring the glare Tony was throwing his way.
“I’m going to put you in timeout for being such a nuisance!” Pepper said as she made her way back into view. “He’ll be alright, right?”
“James, seriously I don’t have enough to bail you out of jail,” Clint said exasperatedly, grabbing his boyfriend’s shoulder and attempted to pull him back.
“Nat’s taking care of it…which means she’ll be passed on to Ruth, if that helps…” Tony said lamely. “How do you wanna handle this, love?” Steve turned away from him, resting his hands on his hips as he let out a small laugh.
“Regardless, I could use a drink,” Natasha said as she suddenly appeared with a large clear bottle and several tiny drinking glasses. “And you will be joining me,” she added before handing the doctor a tiny glass full of clear liquid.
Bucky held Clint by his shoulders at arm-length, a mixture of emotions running through his system while the blonde just smiled dopily back at him.
“It wasn’t a cheap shot, Clint,” Joey piped in, winking at Nat who did the same in the rear view mirror.
Em took this opportunity to steal a glance at Peter, who had a grin back at her, before nodding towards the empty couch still up for grabs. With a silent agreement the teenagers had hauled themselves up onto the long stretch of the couch, laying their bodies out as far as they could reach, turning to Steve to offer a challenge.
“Pete you’re too bony to be jumping on people,” Joey complained as Tony made his way into the living room, sitting on the other side of their daughter.
“My daughter is a genius, little brother. Don’t be jealous cause you didn’t learn to walk until last year,” he said as he still hugged the girl tight. Steve rolled his eyes again as he stood up, walking over to stop the recording camera.
“What?” Both Clint and Daci exclaimed at the same time, eliciting a laugh out of everyone in the room, except her father.
“What’s up?” Steve asked quietly, very confused by the situation. His husband just smiled back at him before grabbing his hand and leading him to the living room.
Sure enough, Bucky watched in horror as Clint was suddenly several feet in the air, blood beginning to appear in his panicked eyes. He wasn’t sure what came over him...but without thinking Bucky stood up, reached over Steve to grab the shield and threw it...aiming for his daughter’s head.
“You ever think of going back to art school?” she asked suddenly, looking genuinely impressed with his drawing. He turned towards her, a small smile on his face.
"Master," Emerson said as she literally bowed before Loki, still sitting on the couch. "Please tell us the story of why you are under house arrest."
“Fine,” she responded with a shrug, not enjoying the unimpressed look on his face. “What did my dads tell you?”
“Night Papa,” the boy said before sleepily resting his head on his dad’s shoulder again, still munching on his cookie.
“Well, I’ll grow it out until the last second. I promise, doll,” James said with a soft smile, grabbing Clint’s shirt collar and pulling him in for a kiss. When he pulled back, Clint frowned a little and addressed his love more seriously.
She snaps out of her depressive thoughts when she hears footsteps in the hallway. Maybe…maybe he came home early. She pulls herself off the bed and walks slowly to her door. Opening the door, she peaks out into the hall and frowns when she sees nothing.
“Alright come on my boys!” the Omega chirped with a clap of his hands, gently pushing Harley up the driveway. Steve followed the pair, smiling when Tony paused to grab his hand. A quick kiss on the cheek warmed his heart and Steve could feel comfort from the Omega through the bond. The reassurance Steve needed to knock on the front door before opening it and bringing the group inside.
“What?” he asked with a chuckle, handing her a washcloth to clean herself while he started putting conditioner in her hair. “Why do you ask that?”
was just white trash…like me. Except Steve has always felt like a ‘real parent’ to me – who I betrayed by going behind his back to speak to my maternal grandmother who
“Um, I love to be the one to tell you this - but you’re about to be dealing with a lot more poop so you might want to get used to that,” Clint said with a laugh, walking over to watch his foster kids smother their uncle.
She’s almost eighteen. Way too old to still be having nightmares. Especially when she has a memory of something she wasn’t even present for. But here she was, wishing her Pop was home so she could curl up in bed with him – knowing for sure he was safe and alive.
Tony called him, frantically asking if Steve could pick the boy up from school. The Omega had back to back presentations and had asked Steve before asking anyone else to go get him. Which, while Steve didn’t love the fact the pup was sick, did help stroke the Alpha’s ego.
“She’ll be okay, Peter,” he heard Steve say. “This happens to her when she doesn’t take her medicine.”
to me. Honey, I’ve been pining for you for fourteen years. You think I’m going to find anyone else like you out there? Someone who’s a bigger troll? Who tells such horrible jokes?” Tony teased, which had Steve reflexively put the book to the side in order to tickle the smaller teen. He brought the man into straddle his lap, letting up on him when he continued.
“You said you both use protection?” Bruce asked as he pulled his glasses off to wipe the lenses with his shirt.
“–Steve please just shut the fuck up.” Sam said with his eyes closed, Steve looking offended back at him. Sam finally opened one eye, checking to see Steve did what he asked before speaking more – this time in a much kinder tone.
"Oh that's right! Miles, you remember how you didn't get to meet all the Avengers at your adoption party?" waiting to continue until the boy nodded, "well your Pop and I want to take you guys to meet one while we go on vacation."
“Joey? Hey sweetie, are you awake?” he asked quietly. She nodded sleepily as she pulled her left hand out to inspect it.
“That’s me,” Steve said as he stood in front of the man, anxiously awaiting for any news. He could still feel Tony through the bond so he sent a prayer upstairs for good news.
“Tony, I swear to god I’m going to wash your mouth out with soap,” the soldier said while staring at the ceiling. Tony turned back to his husband.
“Okay!” she said excitedly, quickly getting up to follow Tony to the kitchen, who laughed before leading the way. “What will the snack be?”
“Sweetheart, I hate to be the one to break this to you, but you suck at lying to me. I’ve seen you lie, very well to other people. But you’ve never managed to lie to me.”
"It was school," Steve replied with a shrug, still smiling even when Joey started to stir awake. "Hey sleeping beauty," he whispered to the baby who blinked awake and smiled at her uncle.
Marcus approached him out of nowhere and informed the two fathers that not only was Joey arrested for drinking at a school function, but several pictures of her doing it were already on the internet.
“Morning, oh…is Emerson still throwing herself a pity party?” Miles said with a laugh as she heard her fathers chuckle as well. She brought her head up to glare at the three as she watched her dads hug her little brother in greeting. The sixteen year old was almost as tall as the six foot tall blonde, but it didn’t stop either father from showing the teen affection.
“Then tell me why you did it,” he snarled back at her. She swallowed thickly before breaking eye contact with him.
Steve was gentle with her, noticeably taken back by her fear, adding “thank you dear. But please, call me Steve. Peter says you guys have an art project to work on?”
“You know what would be a big help? A wet and cold washrag to cool her off. Do you think you can get that for her?” Peter nodded furiously before squirming his way out of Tony’s arms and running to the bathroom.
“Get your ass over here and explain to me why you snuck out to get an MIP,” he growled, feeling as though he was beginning to shake with rage.
Her Pop had reminded her a hundred times this morning to go to May’s after school. Also reassured her several times that the surgery was minor and he would be fine.
“Yes I can,” he mumbled as he contemplated throwing the man off him. He had the strength to do so after recently growing past his big bro in both height and weight.
“Hey!” he barked out to the red devil, suddenly angry for his ego’s sake. “What the hell man I had them!” Miles had never even heard of this guy, so he wasn’t sure if he was friend or foe.
“Holy shit,” Tony said aloud as he ran to his bathroom to find a leftover test. He’d had a scare or two since having Harley. Luckily Steve hadn’t spent the night last night, having a job opportunity early the next day. So Tony was allowed privacy as he practically held his breath for the almost two minutes it took for the test to finish.
She studied his face, not liking how he was still looking at the doorway she exited with a dopey grin on his face. He took a deep breath before sighing and eventually turning his attention back to his child. Who was just glaring back at him.
“I was there, Bucky was definitely the cute one,” Clint purred, getting Steve to throw the pillow right back at his brother when he blushed at his mate.
“HEY! That’s not true. I didn’t sell you, did I Ashley?” the thirty three year old woman  said, baffling the teen with the shear amount of ego you needed for such a statement.
He unfroze after a moment, instincts coming in as the Omega raised the pup to lay high up on his chest closer to his scent gland.
“Okay,” the blonde said with a shy smile, taking a breath before going into his closet. Tony kicked his legs and waited as Steve came back and sat next to him on the bed. “It’s not my best work, but…”
“Look here, you inbred fucks – I better not see you ever mess with my brother again. Make fun of me all you want, I understand. Having a
He brought his arms to wrap around Tony, pulling him somehow closer into his embrace as the brunette snuggled his head into his neck.
“Oh god that was literally the worst day of my life. I told Buck that I had to stay away from you guys for three months to get over it!”
“I paid a kind older gentleman outside a liquor store. He was really nice, most guys just demand to see my tits but he just took the money,” she explained innocently as she stared at her father’s tombstone.
“Look, it’ll be fine! And now you know, so you can train me!” Peter dropped his hands and glared at his little brother. “Or...maybe not right away…”
“Thank God,” Peter said, waving off his Pop’s last minute tweaks. “Wish me luck!” he shouted before grabbing his stuff and rushing towards the elevator.
Steve was pretty furious, but the man could still sleep through just about anything. So he didn’t notice the last few nights when Tony slipped out of bed to either work in his lab or watch TV in the living room.
“Did Barnes convince you to join baseball? Or at least borrow his pants?” Tony asked with wiggly brows, causing the once warm feeling in his chest to quickly turn to annoyance.
It wasn’t that Pete didn’t want any more kids. He did. It just feels so soon after adopting the twins to adopt one like Leo.
“Hey…” she began eyeing the weapons area, “could you teach me how to shoot an arrow?” His eyes widened comically as a smile slowly appeared on her face. When she and her Tati trained together, he didn’t allow her to use any weapons. In fact, he kept it strictly to her powers and how to use them.
Peter's eyes cast downward as the doubt crept back into his gut. He felt the other man walk over to him, hands grabbing his as he squeezed gently until Peter looked back up at him. Warm brown eyes smiled back at him as Wade leaned over to kiss him, Peter unable to do anything but smile against those lips.
“It’s totally not a big deal,” the brunette tried to say, “I just need minor heart surgery, scheduled for next week–”
"That is in six years you fucking moron!" Tony growled at him, anger and shock coursing through him. "You don't even know how old he is? For fuck's sake why did I ever think you could be a part of his life?"
He sent a quick prayer upstairs that the therapy would work. And maybe he should suggest sparring with his youngest…
His head shot up as…red white and goddamn blue eyes looked at her. She smiled before gently climbing into his lap. He was still in his Captain America uniform sans helmet and shield. He was simultaneously sweaty, itchy, and his belt dug into her thigh but she only tightened her arms around his chest.
“-I’M NOT HAVING A FUCKING PANIC ATTACK!” the blonde screamed out, just before he started hyperventilating, his face angry for proving Buck’s point. Bucky remained quiet, caught between wanting to respect his boundaries while also crushing him in a hug. So he watched as the blonde got control of his breathing, only gently reaching out when Clint had finally looked back at him.
“Yeah she’ll be okay; bump on the head and a few scratches. And don’t worry, I won’t take you to a regular hospital,” he said with assurance as he scrolled through his phone to find the number. “SHIELD will help you out while keeping your identity sec–”
“We have a problem,” his husband said seriously, greeting him at the door. It was a little before noon on Halloween and the super soldier just remembered that fact as he stood at the entrance panting and noticed a jack-o-lantern sitting outside.
“–but that’s the thing, Pop! I didn’t! It was second-hand smoke…on an open field,” she explained in her defense.
“What do you want to drink to wash down those cookies Peter Pan?” Tony cooed to the boy, offering Steve a smirk before going to the fridge, daring the man to stop him.
“Seeb!” she cried out, trying to plop down in order to crawl over to him. Bucky grabbed her again and hoisted her upright, determined to get her to walk.
“Brute, huh?” Steve asked before doing two things in rapid succession. Spinning him around and throwing Tony over his shoulder. The shriek that followed couldn’t have been from him, it was so high pitched, that the genius blamed it on a seagull as he tried to maintain balance.
“That’s a fucked up term,” he said instead, catching the genius off guard to the point of breaking out in a laugh, overwhelmed from the roller coaster of emotions he just experienced. “So, let me see if I can get this straight,” Steve suddenly switched to a Brooklyn accent, which immediately froze the brunette. “Your genius brain heard a snippet of a conversation,” he continued while crawling towards the genius, gently pushing the smaller man back in order to climb on top of him and straddle his thighs, “and decided that instead of confronting your man about it, you would come to the conclusion that I secretly meant I wanted out of this family? Is that what your genius brain did?”
“I’m glad you’re not my father, Tony” she said once again, this time casting her eyes downward, releasing her grip before confessing.
Pepper and Rhodey both suddenly appeared in front of the family, smiling and redirecting them out to the other exit.
She didn’t bother trying to say anything anymore, openly sobbing as she eventually went limp over his legs. He finally relented, gently pulled her underwear back up and shifting her around to sit up on his lap. His big strong arms wrapped around her and hugged her tight as she cried out every bit of herself.
“Petey what happened?” Tony asked, putting his coffee cup on the counter and walking over to them. Steve happily handed the boy over to his husband when his son reached for him, not jealous that he often looked to Tony for comfort.
“Thank you, Banner,” Steve snapped, not feeling guilty as his genius friend – who is also not a parent – made his way out of the room.
“No, you didn’t cub,” Tati said in a much less angry tone and much more sad. Which somehow hurt worse. It felt like only a few minutes ago when she felt hungry, now her stomach was just twisted in knots. “I’m going to go make us lunch and I want you to go to your room and think about what you’ve done.” The door to the elevator opened on their floor, but she stood frozen as he stepped out.
"If I am it's your Pop's fault for acting so weird," the older man said childishly, loving seeing his kid laugh at the antics.
Tony, with a small smile, continued grumbling, “that didn’t stop us from doing it on the kitchen counter…”
“W-what about -” he began before she interrupted him, a startling feeling stirring in his stomach at the thought of the archer.
“I wanted some gum while I got gas, and found this beauty,” his love said simply, shrugging his shoulders as well.
Steve picked up Peter after school, taking off early to help May out while also trying to think of something he and the little man could do for Tony.
“Lock down the lab and make a reservation for that Thai place at eight, got it?” he turned to look hopefully back at the skeptical super soldier.
"My fathers are billionaires, there really isn't anything I want other than a companion animal in the form of a baby kitty," she said with another smile. "I talked to Kate and she thought a pet would help me, a cat would be less work than a dog and I have the subsequent research if you two wish to look over them," she said as she handed them various articles and research behind having a pet.
“Josephine!” he barked, glad to see the three other teens tremble and scatter. Upset to see his niece just looked annoyed at his presence.
“I don’t care that you’re gay, doesn’t mean I’m okay with you looking at my tits!” she said over dramatically. They all knew that wasn’t what this was about, the husbands sharing a knowing look before she continued.
Men shouted around him and that’s when Miles decides now’s a good time to bounce. He had no idea how to explain his bloody clothes and zero injuries. What’s important is that Harry will live.
“Hey, you know what’s fun though? Aunty Pepper is coming by later to hang out with you while Papa and I go to a boring party,” Tony said as he walked over to hug the boy. “And I think she said something about pizza and ice cream for dinner?”
“I love you Joey,” he said before placing a final kiss on her forehead. “You’re still a good kid just…try and listen to your old man, okay?”
She sat a moment longer as she watched her brothers race each other to the game room, turning to smile at her dads.
“Uh uh,” May said, cutting him off. “We talked about this Peter. We’re not going to do anything to take away from Daddy and Papa’s big day, right? Cause we love them and we’re happy for them? Plus remember how Papa officially adopted Joey? He’s going to officially adopt you too! Lots of reasons to celebrate our big happy family! Just keep it on long enough to walk down the aisle and take a picture. I promise you’ll take it off after, okay?”
“Why was he at the courthouse?” Steve asked seriously, hands on his hips, temporarily not embarrassing his son with pictures.
“Harley! Bambino there you are,” Tony cried as he saw them, grabbing Harley from Steve’s arms to hug the pup. “How are you my love?”
“Say Pop, what are you guys planning for the big 2-0?” He turned to Wade before continuing, “they’re celebrating twenty years of marriage in a few weeks.”
"Does this mean you're moving back home, Em?" Miles asked suddenly appearing at her side. She stole a glance at her love, who was hugging her dads in comfort, before informing her little brother.
“Papa!” he heard a shout, turning to see his favorite little guy barreling towards him. He caught him as he jumped into his arms, bringing him into a hug and chuckling at his boy.
“Wait, Emerson. You know how I feel about skipping meals. Sam is our guest tonight and it sounds like you and Pete might owe him an apology.”
"What if Deadpool were to bring presents to him or something?" he suggested as he reached to press the button on the elevator, stopping when his boyfriend slapped his hand away. He turned to lecture him - yet again - about it not being a competition about pushing the damn button, when Wade addressed him suddenly serious.
“Hey! Both of you, go sit down. Before I put you both in time out,” he chastised them as Joey couldn’t help but laugh along with Tony as they only walked a few feet away to the other side of the kitchen island; both watching him and oogling at the food.
“Calm down, ya tiny terrorist. I got you a hot vanilla latte. I’ve learned my lesson.” Sam handed her a cup with a smile, before passing out the rest of the cups.
Tony snapped back to the present when he realized that now, now he knew what love was. Thoughts of Steve - his kind, caring, amazing father and loving husband who is also his soulmate came to his mind. The sexy, sculpted, amazing in bed Alpha who constantly and vocally proclaimed his love for the Omega. Who puts the man above his gender and loves when he talks. Who loved his pup from the beginning and has been so patient and kind even when the pup openly disliked him back.
“I told Dad I’d start seeing a therapist,” she admitted with a red face as he looked at her once more. “I did want to talk to you guys but…lately it’s been like you two tip toe around my feelings. And I…I don’t want you guys…you’ll think of me differently.” She whispered the last words out, dripping with pain that implied some hidden horrors they didn’t know about. His arms reached out, waiting for her to accept the offer.
The sounds of footsteps banged their way to him and before he knew it his brother was next to him, confusion in his scent as he bent down to the other Alpha.
She swallowed her anger enough to not challenge him any further; not particularly wanting to get her ass tanned this evening. He’d done it once before, and he was way harsher than her Dad had been.
Em chose that moment to roll over and accidentally kick the super soldier. Her green eyes cracked open at him, mumbling a quick apology before rolling back to bury her head in the pillows. Not half a second later, she sat upright, realization clicking in her brain.
"Um I don't know if she'll look as fly as me," Miles spoke up, giggling along with the adults at his statement.
“But I don’t want you to have a baby!” the six year old suddenly cried out, standing up off the couch and glaring at the pair.
"Our fathers have done more for this world in the last week then you two bible-thumping hypocrites have done in your entire lives. And what's
“No, I was going to but I decided I wanted you with me to tell her,” the smaller man said with a small blush on his cheeks.
"Your Papa wet the bed until he was ten or eleven. And I know for a fact Spiderman has wet the bed on many occasions," he said giggling along with his youngest. They settled in silence for a moment before he snapped the lights off, Tony wondering if he could fall asleep if he tried to make it about his son.
“How about I help you get to bed?” Natasha asked the doctor, walking over and helping him to his feet.
"Oh my sweet summer child," her Dad quickly retorted, "I know you didn't because you got your cooking skills from
“Okay, well you be good. Talking to you Sam,” Steve said with a wink at an even angrier falcon. Emerson sat up and turned to her father.
“That’s Nat and Sam. The four of us were going to go out but I think all knotheads should stay here and think about what they’ve done,” Clint said as he walked to answer the door.
He was told to stay at home when his mom took Lacy back to Carolyn’s house to get her stuff after she’d kicked her out.
“I...I don’t know. But uh...my parents are still downstairs,” Steve growled out, glaring at the brunette as he gently shoved him off. Tony just laughed as he did, making sure the drawings didn’t get smushed under his weight.
.” Steve patted Emerson and Peter on their shoulders, ushering them to follow him out. He ignored their shocked faces, similar to the ones left behind in the office, as well as the screeching that began once the door closed as continued their journey to the car.
“Jarvis, can you tell Joey to come to the living room please?” Tony asked the ceiling – making Steve wonder if he’d ever get fully used to the AI technology.
“Sounds good!” she agreed happily, helping him carry the food and napkins to the living room. There was a pile of books on the coffee table, which made the smile on Daci’s face grow. “That’s more than one book.”
“Then, you should get married.” She watched her Tati with a smile as he moved to sit next to her so she could see his face.
“I’m sor-” James began before Clint quickly ended that train of thought by turning around and kissing him quiet. He pulled back, thoroughly enjoying the pleased yet confused look on his boyfriend’s face.
"Let's go," Clint said, looking up at the love of his life, the man he'd be married to soon. James grabbed his hand with a smile, leaning over to kiss Clint before reaching down for Lucky's leash.
"Stop dying," Emerson rasped out with zero sympathy, getting a laugh from him and their little brother. Peter walked over to press his wrist against his Dad's forehead to check his temperature - which was apparently fire. He looked around to see if his Pop had left any medical equipment, frowning before he made his way to the kitchen to grab what he used to see his dads grab when he was a sick kid.
“Papa does the voices, you don’t do the voices, Daddy,” Peter said, snuggling closer into Steve’s other side as the blonde shifted the toddler on his lap.
"I need to get you back to your fathers," she said as she guided the still injured teen to a small vehicle of some kind. Shuri got in next to her, Emerson taking a moment to steal a kiss on her cheek, heart bursting with an amount of love she didn't know she was capable of having.
He was thankful when his Pops opened the door, bending down to pick up his excited granddaughter. The blonde welcomed them in and led the way down the hall to the living room, giving the seven year old space as he hid behind Wade. Pete walked over to his Dad sitting on the couch as Isaac clung to him, slowly waking up, rubbing his face in the man’s neck until he realized where they were.
"Babe, you know Deadpool is a good guy, right?" Peter asked as he took a step closer to the slightly taller man. Wade remained silent as he simply squished his face adorably and shook his head back and forth. The super hero gently poked the vigilante in the middle of his chest before speaking again.
He was much better at this when she was little. He had more patience because she couldn’t fully comprehend her actions. But as a teen? Jesus…
“Actually,” Buck said with a smile, “do you wanna make them a snack? I want to go check on them real quick, she might need more pillows for their fort.” The man left without waiting for Steve’s response as the blonde simply shook his head fondly at his brother’s actions.
“Not the point, Papa,” the boy teased fondly, reminding him exactly of his father. “I was talking to my friend Gwen, and she has a step-mommy and a mommy. And we asked Ms. Jacobson why there isn’t a day for step-mommies and daddies cause they shouldn’t have to share. But she didn’t know either.”
“I had a hard workout this morning, it’s the only reason he beat me in that race,” the Alpha said before catching sight of Steve and eyeing the man up and down. “And who is this?” Steve could see the man straighten up a little, almost as if he was posturing.
“It probably hurt a lot less than a punch to the face, young lady,” Tony teased with a brow raised at the teen.
“I know all of that,” he said more calmly, “but last I checked SI was doing significantly better than Stone Inc in the stock market, my technology is light-years ahead of there’s and I
“Mrs. Walker, I ask that you wait before contributing.” The angry looking middle aged woman sat back dramatically waiting for him to continue. “Now, I will remind both parents and all students that neither violence nor bullying is tolerated at my school. However, I am to understand that that was exactly what happened earlier today. Hunter and John Walker, I have several people telling me you began the altercation by antagonizing Peter here for his sexual orientation. Then others tell me Miss Emerson here threatened –
“Well, guess it never hurt being a real Stark,” she muttered with a smile, settling more on the couch as the words hit Tony like a punch to the chest.
until you feel better, okay?” the brunette reiterated, taking turns to look at both of them. Steve glared at him a little, his husband well aware of his anger issue when it came to his family’s protection.
“Possibly, but where’s the fun in that?” the shorter man asked with a smile, closing the door behind him but not moving to join the noise.
She had asked to be the one to tell him, the padres only agreeing that she'd do it in front of the whole family. So they decided they'd do it after school the next day.
"Hello there mister giant!" his father said with an amused chuckle as Wade bent the two down so Tony could kiss the boy's cheek. The elevator dinged, the group turning to watch Pop walk in. He had a bouquet of purple tulips in one hand with bags of takeout in the other. He was also sporting...a beard?? Peter hadn't seen them in a few weeks and the bastard had apparently spent the time growing a rather magnificent beard.
“You’ve been holding this for a long time, Emerson,” she said quietly, as if she didn’t know. “Thank you for telling me. I’m…I’m so sorry.” She looked up at that, staring at the woman in disbelief.
, rudely interrupted by Spiderling over there, and I won’t need to intervene to save her ass,” he said, before saluting Peter and walking away. He called out, “till next time, cockeye!”
“Tony,” Steve whimpered again as he stood up with Buck, leaning against his brother as the other Alpha led them to his car, Pappy’s shouts of encouragement following them. He could hear the sounds of people around them, but the voices were muted and mumbled together. “Buck what...what happened?” he asked when his mind was a little less foggy
“Noooo,” she whined immediately, pudgy fingers trying to undo what he did. Steve simply smirked at his brother before grabbing his drawing pad once more.
“And I don’t care that you got mad when you found out something re-traumatizing. That is a normal reaction. You’re allowed to make mistakes, kiddo. You’re still human. You just try not to make them again in the future. And remember…it’s not about your mistakes; it’s about how you handle them. And you have handled them beautifully.” He smiled when she finally relaxed in his arms – still hugging him tight.
“Hey peanut! How was school?” he asked as he swung her up in the air before bringing her into a hug.
“Are you listening, Tony? You know what all of this would mean, right?” those sparkling blue eyes bore into his brown, trying to get him to recognize the seriousness of the statement. Of course he knew what this meant.
She took a beat before responding in a hushed tone, ashamed at the water in her eyes, “why are you guys doing this?” You don’t deserve this, that fucking voice reminded her.
"Well, Pop, I um, came here to tell you guys...I decided to postpone college. For now." His sister and Pop's eyes practically bulged from their sockets as his Dad simply looked sad back at Peter. "I'll go in a few years, but right now I want to spend more time, doing what I love..."
“Unless of course...you find a pretty Omega and offer to buy theirs…” Clint purred with wiggly brows, leaving Steve no choice but to throw the couch pillow at his head.
His heart broke a little, which he didn't think was possible after the day he had, at Clint's lost expression.
,” Tony promised before switching to English. “And you boys did behave, so I guess we should find a nearby ice cream parlor.” Harley cheered and wiggled down from the Omega’s hold, grabbing both Tony and Steve’s hands to lead them out of the museum. Steve let it drop for now, enjoying his family’s company and noticing no one he wanted to punch in the face was in sight.
“Steve? Please don’t be too harsh on him. He was crying when I helped him into bed. I promise it didn’t trigger anything for me and I know he only did it because I wasn’t supposed to be here.”
She was interrupted by some not-so-subtle coughing from the mediator, who gave her a look when Emerson made eye contact. Right, behave.
Steve and Tony both stood frozen, watching their teen in shock and amazement. When Stone simply laughed at her, she resorted to an impressive right hook to his crotch. The small crowd of people gaped as the man plummeted to the ground in pain.
“Pop?” she asked, knowing he damn well deserved it and she keeps forgetting to try it. He froze a little at that, hand moving to gently grip her shoulder. “What happened to me?” she asked, refusing to look at him as she felt tears prickling her eyes.
He looked at the set up tables before turning back to James, glad to finally see a smile on his handsome face.
“See?” Peter said, sticking his tongue out at his dad for good measure. Tony, always the mature one, returned the favor as Rhodey laughed at the two.
“You do not have a ‘tati’ stupid child,” Strucker growled out before enforcing his point with a harsh slap to her face. The serum would make her heal soon, but it didn’t stop the trickle of blood that she felt as pain radiated from her cheek. “You belong to us. We may have used his DNA but
“Yeah, um…I’m Joey’s guardian. She’s been with her mother’s cousin the last few weeks and abruptly ended her vacation early yesterday.”
“Oh, and this is my single friend, Steve,” the redhead said once she spotted him. Steve was prepared to reprimand her for telling a total stranger that he was single when the words got caught in his throat. Turning to face him was the most gorgeous man Steve has ever seen in his life.
"Uh huh, and did you come in here to show him your books or throw around a dangerous weapon?" Steve asked with a brow raised, smiling when Miles' own smile broke from his face. Steve picked Miles up to rest him on his hip, giving him a quick kiss as they turned their attention back to the god.
“Steve,” Tony said with a Cheshire grin, reaching over to grab the picture and holding it above the blonde’s head. They both knew that Steve could throw him off if he wanted to, but that wasn't as much fun.
"I know...and I'm genuinely sorry, Clint," he said in a more somber tone, thinking of the blonde waiting for him. Thinking of the awful things he's said to him. "I really don't deserve you after everything you went through...after everything I put you through. But if you'll let me, I'd like to make it up to you. I meant it what I said before, Clint. You're the one for me. Please give me another chance." He noticed Clint's eyes getting watery as he spoke, and didn't mind that he felt his own eyes match.
“There’s nothing to talk about,” Clint said angrily, pulling his knees up to his chest. Bucky couldn’t help sighing in frustration, not knowing how to navigate this situation and feeling frustrated with himself because of that.
“See, what I don’t need right now, are fucking excuses. I don’t care how, I just want that fucker gone,” Tony growled at his eight well paid lawyers. He had called them into the conference room, as well as Pepper and his new assistant, Marcus, who were sitting off to the side.
Last night was date night, so they didn’t end up falling asleep until three in the morning…and Peter just woke them up at…fuck if Tony was going to move to even check the time.
,” Joe whispered, freezing Tony a little in his embrace.  It only lasted a moment before Tony tightened his hold on the man and fully embraced the hug. The older brunette held him there for a moment before placing a fatherly kiss on his head.
“-About what you wanted to do with the rest of your life? No, I don’t remember that particular conversation!” Clint shouted before something clicked in his mind, immediately squashing his anger and replacing it with guilt.
“Well...honestly parenting is hard and sometimes...it feels like I need a break, you know?” Tony froze in his tracks, fear shooting up his spine and paralyzing him. A break, he wanted a break.
Tony thought it was all a little ridiculous. But he sat dutifully in the bleachers with his friends, dressed in a simple blue button up, black jacket and slacks. Doing his best to ignore his teasing friends as they waited for the game to start.
“I’m...I’m going to...go get us some punch,” Steve said as he pointed behind them with both hands. Tony watched as he quickly walked away, enjoying the view for a moment before leaving the dance floor chuckling to himself.
“If you think I’m going to let a selfish little whore like you destroy the very company I built…” Howard growled out just as the sounds of a truck pulled into the driveway. Tony never thought he’d love the sound of truck tires on gravel, but it was currently music to his fucking ears.
“Yeah...so...could I maybe...take you to dinner sometime?” Steve asked, nervous even though they had both shared how wonderful their one night stand had been.
"Miles, your palate is phenomenal," Tony said as his youngest just looked confused back at his father.
“I would counter the opposite…” Steve felt his blush spread to his ears and a smile quickly spread across his face.
“How’d you and Tony meet, May?” she asked as she sat next to her on the couch. Peter had just fallen asleep after Jo read him a few stories, willingly obliging her little brother’s request when he had asked her.
“Night-night Peter! Love you!” the blonde said as he stood still and watched with a smile as his husband carried their son back to bed...also checking out his backside because he could.
“Mhmm, and you used your big boy voice when you screamed bloody murder?” Tony glared at that, knowing his husband couldn’t see him.
“Joey, what’d you do to make your daddy spank you?” Steve asked with a small smile, reaching back to pat her head; smiling at seeing there was still flour in her brown curls. He leaned back a little more, seeing the light pink on her bottom – only somewhat covered by the remaining flour.
"My bad little man, he's a brave papa then. And I'm not even talking about saving the world," Pat said as he winked at the super soldier.
Tony picked him up in his favorite Jaguar, the two doing minimal groping on the way to the theater. However, in doing so, Steve only realized he forgot his phone as they stood in line for popcorn.
“So...how are you holding up?” Tony was startled by the question and nearly poured scalding hot milk on himself.
“Peter?” he heard his Pop’s voice behind him. He quickly turned around and saw his father looking skeptically between the two. Wade’s voiced changed as he started to say, “excuse me sir.” Peter saw him begin to turn towards the exit and quickly said, “Wade!”
“I was…but now I’m not so sure,” he answered honestly. Those brown eyes stayed locked on his, Tony only offered a half-smile in return. Then the brunette scoffed before rolling over on the bed, backing up into Steve to be the small spoon.
I think you’re big sister’s pussy tastes.” He sat back in shock and disgust, even funnier since his big sister was actually pansexual. And single.
“Are they done yelling?” Peter asked as Harley plopped down on the floor and began playing with his blocks.
“Emerson,” she began when the teen had turned her attention fully to her. “I just wanted to say goodbye. I’m going to go stay with my sister for a while on the west coast and…I just…I didn’t like the way things ended. I found something out recently and…can I just have a few minutes of your time. With no interrupting?” she asked quietly and sincerely.
“It’s pretty awesome,” she admitted, not sure if she could do this everyday but still proud of herself for trying. She watched with a smile as her Daddy walked over to them, sitting himself on the edge of the tub near her Tati.
"So Deadpool isn't bad?" Miles asked to clarify, getting a laugh from the three adults in the room. Emerson stole a glance at Wade at the question, smiling at him before turning back to the boy.
“Stone?” he asked incredulously, standing up to face the man. He felt Natasha’s small hand on his wrist, holding him in place.
“No,” Sam once again turned back to look Steve in the eyes. “That is a horrible idea. You are the only two men on this planet she trusts. Do you really wanna break that?”
“This is the most ‘normal people car’ you’re going to get out of me. Normally I drive a two-seater but the Escalade comes out whenever I have Petey.”
“Apparently I’m one fertile motherfucker,” Tony said as he plopped down on a chair near Bruce’s work table.
Now though…he was using Peter as a body pillow. And taking a nap in the middle of a hospital…willingly; while his husband was in surgery.
“Right?!” the man squeaked out as they approached their car. “That is the single toughest kid I know, and that’s
“Come watch movies, Daddy!” Harley said again, breaking Tony out of his stupor as he joined his family for some snuggle-movie time. His middle child climbed onto his lap while his husband wrapped his arm around him and pulled him close. They had chosen The Lion King and Tony only knew because of the sounds of the opening credits, since his eyes were closed. He didn’t even realize he’d fallen asleep until a noisy commotion woke him up. As he slowly opened his eyes, he found the cause of the commotion.
“Sorry Peter,” Leo said quietly. Before Peter could reassure the child that this clearly wasn’t his fault - his Dad spoke up for him.
“Buck woulda been so proud of you,” Steve said in agreement as Tony saw her cheeks flush bright pink.
"That chicken-shit wouldn't dare!" Tony piped in. "With everything he's done, he'll probably cop a plea to escape some jail time. If word gets out, can't imaging what it'll do to Stone's stock either..."
“Gentleman, please have a seat,” she said, waving at the open space on her mattress. The two shared another look before sitting on either side of her. Steve glanced down at the… six stacks of papers while Joey cleared her throat.
“If anything, I’m thankful you stood up for your brother.” Her eyes smiled along with her mouth at the further implication that she
Leo’s mood changed on a dime. One minute, he was quiet and shy, the next - he cussed Peter out in Spanish. It took everything in him not to laugh, especially when he could see his husband refraining from laughing behind the boy, but he was able to put on a stern face and explain in Spanish that he was not allowed to do that.
“Where’s your brother?” The super soldier asked, letting up on crushing the teen. He noticed she didn’t immediately break away from him, hesitating until a moment longer to stand back and answer.
“Mhmm. Just cause Dr. Seuss does it doesn’t mean you get to. Your dad and I need a minute to wake up, then we’ll come make you a big breakfast, okay buddy?” Tony could hear the small groan but smiled when the boy climbed off the bed and left the room. He felt Steve once again shift to lie on the bed behind Tony, removing the pillow from his head to plant a kiss on his cheek. The genius was glad when the taller man immediately settled behind him, arms wrapped around the brunette’s waist.
“Oh...well, that means she’s the one who he’s been meeting with all this time at SHIELD. She’s been making sure he’s okay.” Daci frowned at that, because she realized why Steve said it was illegal...and wondered why Clint was almost defending her.
“Hey Mrs. Rogers!” Tony called, just to be a shit. Steve’s hands dropped from his face to look at Tony in betrayal, turning into a glare when they heard her laugh before opening the door.
She took a moment before answering, “yeah…I was just wondering something…” Before Steve could ask again, she turned to Peter bluntly asking, “so Steve is Pop and Tony is Dad, huh?”
“How could I not??” the shorter man asked while pointing at it. This prompted the blonde to roll the magazine up and swat the man with it. Tony yelped and jumped away, which made Steve reach over to snag the man by his waistband and yank him back onto his lap.
“I’m not under any kind of spell,” he growled in his own defense, watching as Stark held his phone to his ear and walked out of the room again.
“Steve!” Tony hissed as Steve looked back at him confused. He had every right to be angry right now. Tony shook his head furiously, maintaining eye contact as Steve felt himself slowly relent.
She barely registered it as she finished the glass of water, handed it to Tony and collapsed backwards – feeling safe for the first time in her life. She waited until they shut the lights and the door before tracing her finger along her hairline where Tony has kissed her.
“When I told him that’d be stressful,” he said a little louder, trying to get his point across, “he said we should just hire a nanny!”
“And if you’re ever mean to me, I’ll tell Aunt Pepper,” the boy said with new vigor, like he still didn’t fully believe the Alpha.
“I told you to wait and I would get you the damn cup,” Steve muttered as he hoisted her on top of the counter near the sink. He grabbed bandages and tape from one of the drawers as he also ran her foot under running water.
“Yeah, so...I thought at the very least you deserved an explanation. I’m glad I ran into you and um...anyway, you’re free to go. I know an Omega with another Alpha’s pup isn’t exactly most people’s cup of tea.”
.” The genius absorbed those words...looking at his husband who looked devastated back at him. “Sweetheart you...you really think I’ve ever had second thoughts about you?”
. I want you to think long and hard about how lucky you are to have her,” Tony paused as he pulled in to park in front of his apartment.
He also knew it was the only thing that would reassure her, actually seeing the man in person. So she followed him, ignoring the voice in her head as she crawled onto the bed next to him. She sat on top of the covers, legs crossed in a small way of defiance of getting actual comfort from him.
Her first seizure happened in her sleep when she was only ten years old. She didn’t know what it was, just that she woke up exhausted and on the floor next to her bed. The second time she had a seizure, it was on the couch while her Dad was in the bathroom. They were having a Lord of the Rings marathon. He told her when he came back and saw her shaking on the floor, he ‘damn near pissed himself’ after just using the restroom.
“Stark!” he shouted, ignoring the glaring looks from the two startled men who proceeded to scramble off one another. “Daci’s gone and your AI doesn’t know how she left.”
“Hi Peter,” Tony cooed, soaking in the warmth and gently kissing the pup’s head. “I’m your Daddy. And this handsome Alpha here is your Papa. We love you so much, peanut.”
,” she said condescendingly, “left lunch in such a hurry last week she forgot her scarf. I was hoping you could give it back.” She reached into her purse and thrust a purple scarf that he’d definitely seen Jo wearing into his arms.
Peter shook his head at his father, “not that I can tell. I don’t tend to believe rumors. I don’t know why, but hers are particularly rough, which makes me think they might not be true. It’s stuff like her living in foster care, someone told me she used to be a prostitute…I don’t know stupid stuff like that. Again, I try not to listen to that stuff. She seems cool, kind of quiet but I am too…”
“Hey pup, not feeling too well?” Steve asked as he grabbed Harley’s backpack, reaching a hand out and trying not to take it too personally when Harley brushed past him.
“Hey, I side with you when it comes to Steve, don’t I?” the teen said in her defense as the car came to a stop in front of the entrance. She gathered her overnight bag and opened the door to get out.
She retaliated by being DJ on the way home, purposefully playing top forties. She’d be lying if she said she wasn’t pleasantly surprised when he sang along to a Beyonce song…or two.
a question now?” She looked up at him then, frowning when she saw the angry look on his face. She could see Tony throwing a glare in his direction but didn’t respond, just kept staring at Steve to gage his reaction.
“Anything?” Buck shook his head no as a horrible feeling settled in his stomach. “You think someone took them both?”
“Clint why were you on the gym ceiling?” Steve asked as he pushed some of the papers out of the way so Daci could continue practicing.
“I’m sorry! Jeez, what did Nana say?” she asked with a smile. His face suddenly hardened at that, knowing…
, Tony. And yes I think it might somewhat satisfy my inner protective rage,” the blonde teased. The genius knew he was absolutely joking, since he could see the man using the same hand to punch a certain person in the face…
fast asleep – Tony being the small spoon with Peter taking up most of the middle of the bed. He waited for her to join the bed, shoving her brother a little to make more room for Steve.
“Because you’re...incredible, Clint. Because you’re strong, and kind, and sexy as hell. And yeah, we’re young and dumb...but I’ve never been more sure of anything in my life. And besides, this way you’d have more access to me in the army, better insurance...tax breaks,” James ended with a chuckle that had the blonde joining in.
She could almost ignore the pain from sitting on his muscular thighs; returning the embrace allowing her free flow of tears to continue as she hugged him like her life depended on it. He simply tightened his arms around her, the force of it actually popping her spine.
Probably could’ve benefited from a female’s perspective for the sex talk. Not that she didn’t enjoy Steve’s slideshow…or his updated presentation after they both came out…it had always meant he was
“There somethin’ wrong with being a woman?” Bucky growled, taking a step in front of his young daughter. His brother had a few inches on the tallest among them.
“I’ll call Pepper to tell her our theory, you go check on Jo,” Tony said as Happy pulled up to a stop in front of the building.
“I know that truck,” Steve muttered, waiting for Tony to put the car in park before finding out what happened. Officer Hill – who Steve knew threw work and Tony knew threw charities…and one drunk arrest – greeted them as the two men approached.
“Well well, looks like Jackie still loves me, not that the rest of you do,” Steve teased as he picked the boy up, Bucky realizing his other siblings must be behind him. Sure enough, his four year old sister and seven year old brother were giggling as they approached the two.
He made Steve promise to give him and Jo some privacy when she got home from school the next day. The blonde didn’t like the idea, but relented in favor of going to the gym floor with Sam to distract himself.
“Come on Em,” Peter said, offering a hand to help her off the couch. “Let’s go play video games before we’re scarred for life.”
“Oh, hey Sam. I’m sorry I’m actually not eating dinner,” she said before turning to exit the kitchen.
His smile was starting to make his cheeks hurt as she easily melted into his hug, sighing dramatically against his chest.
"I do, my math is never wrong. You'll age baby it'll just take you a little longer is all. Also you have a grey hair on the back of your head," he said with a smile as the blonde blinked several times in response. "Turn around handsome, I'll snap a picture to prove it," the genius offered. Steve turned his head around and leaned back so Tony could get a better look.
“Clint?” he asked before swallowing in anxiety, unsure why his nerves were suddenly getting the better of him. He hadn’t realized he was looking away until a soft hand gently guided him back.
“Don’t worry Tony, we have your back,” Carol spoke up, sitting with Rhodey behind the others in a cute purple dress.
“Tony…” Steve said quietly, Tony whimpering when he realized the Alpha’s eyes were watering and his scent changed to sadness. “I’m only going to ask you this once. Did you cheat on me?”
“Daci?” he asked his girl, hating himself for the blood staining her hair. She still had a pulse - thank God but she could very well still be the soldier. Just because blunt force trauma snapped him out of it didn’t mean it worked the same for her. But Buck knows he’d die for this girl, so he remained protectively over her and assessed her body for other injuries. “Take Clint back to the quinjet,” he said solemnly, well aware Steve would oblige his request. It wasn’t safe to move Daci yet and Clint needed immediate medical attention. Plus...if anyone should save his daughter it should be him. He got them into all of this mess.
He can suddenly picture a tiny Tony, remembering the face of the sweet boy he’d kissed fourteen years ago.
“Suzanne!” Bucky exclaimed, setting the toddler on the ground and stomping to the little girl. Clint selfishly wondered if there was any cake left when the little boy crawled over before grabbing the blonde’s leg.
“The water is warm. Heated indoor pools are my new favorite thing,” the teen said before turning to cannonball in.
She didn’t want to get her hopes up, until she heard the familiar sounds of her father’s pulse blasters. The monster in front of her had also noticed the sounds and had figured out the same thing as her. That’s when he used one of his hands not clutching his bleeding stomach to grab the gun in his back pocket, whipping it out to shoot her.
“Yeah! I met Butterfingers and U! And I met DUM-E, but he’s in timeout right now,” Leo finished sadly as Peter glanced back at his Dad who was glaring at a corner of his lab.
“I’m the champion, Steve!” Harley called back, getting a snort of laughter after his grandfather, who clapped the pup on the back.
They stopped once they heard the familiar ding again, the three turning their attention to the entrance way.
Here’s the thing, he’s known Sam for a long time. He was the one who helped him become an EMT and studied with him to become a paramedic.  He’d always been kind, occasionally calling Rumlow out for being ignorant and never before tried to pressure him to date – unlike his other coworkers. Sam knew his situation better than anyone, having been there for Steve more times than he ever gave him credit for. So really, he shouldn’t have been nervous, but there was still that flutter of anxiety creeping up inside of him.
“Sorry Dad, we had just gotten to the boss level and it took both of us to take him down. Won’t happen again,” he said with a nod to the two.
“Up to you, kiddo. You can color for a bit while we fix you guys a snack, or we can do the tour and then color and eat a snack, or we can do snack first, that’s always a fabulous option,” the man said as the toddlers giggled and an actual smile appeared on the boy’s face.
“Yup,” he said leaning forward to kiss her forehead before he stood up. “What about you, sweetheart? I can stay if you need me to…”
“Two times, and this isn’t a normal party. This is a Stark Party. Shit gets cray and I don’t trust the cheerleading horde not to date rape you.” The blonde had a horrified look on his face. “I’m kidding...mostly. But just to be safe do you think you should be DD?” he tried, smiling at his oldest friend who saw right through his act.
“It’s alright tater tot, everything’s going to be okay,” he said with a smile as he avoided looking at the other adults. He hugged her a moment longer before letting her down.
Around lunchtime is when Natasha joined them, taking Morgan from Clint's lap as Steve heard his stomach rumble.
Steve smiled at her, suddenly feeling incredibly protective over this kid he barely knew. He would need to tell Tony and Peter about it, call her social worker in the morning… and maybe do some breathing exercises to prevent him from murdering her foster parents. He showed her to one of the guest bedrooms before going to tell his boys the update.
"Let it go Pete," Emerson said as she followed the guys to eat. Wade walked up to Peter, stopping to give Peter one of his furrowed brow looks of disappointment.
“I’m...I’m sorry. That… I just wasn’t expecting that,” Clint said to Daci, who was fighting against the tears forming in her eyes.
“So I bring my nieces and nephews presents and you pay me back with a sticky gremlin? I see how it is…” Rhodey teased as he handed Morgan back to Steve. “Don’t go asking me for favors anytime soon.”
“Clint...I love you. And I want to spend the rest of my life with you...will you marry me?” James asked nervously as the blonde was still trying to process what was in front of him.
“Josephine Renee I will drag your ass down to the nearest hospital so help me God…” Steve began, closing his eyes in anger.
“Are you encouraging me to date a masked vigilante slash possible bad guy?” Peter teased with a smile.
“Both, but after…I don’t know, we had a really good talk. Like, we ended up talking for hours and…I think it went really well, actually. ”
“So…learning my lesson from last time. Someone’s here to see you and they definitely know who you are…”
The fourth message was a picture of his handsome husband’s face – which was frozen in a contorted and ridiculous manner; tongue sticking out and cross-eyed. He snorted a laugh, turning to see her look over curiously before showing her his phone, glad to see her also burst into giggles.
Her thoughts were interrupted by the crinkly old bastard in front of her slamming his hands on the table to get her attention. Fucker knew she had PTSD, laughing at her slight jump from the noise.
“I’ll come back as soon as possible,” Steve said to Tony in an apologetic voice. The brunette glared at the blonde before using the hand that wasn’t holding Harley to pull his husband’s shirt towards him before kissing him harshly.
She replayed the image in her head and only laughed harder, which didn’t go away when she could hear her Tati join her. The blonde just pouted at the both of them from where he sat next to her in the tub.
“I’m not angry at you Tony,” he whispered as he shifted his head to kiss his husband’s cheek. “I promise I don’t fully blame you for today, clearly this man is a fucking psychopath. Especially if the thought of him affects you like this…” he said as the tension in Tony’s body slightly dropped.
He turned away from her for a moment, cleaning up in the kitchen before turning back and gawking at the mess she made.
All of the warm fuzzy feelings he was having, including when his husband grabbed his hand to hold in the elevator – went out the window when JARVIS made an announcement.
“It’s a date,” Tony said with a blush, taking a step closer to the handsome teen in front of them. The blonde smiled at him and licked his lips, which was all the invitation that Tony needed. He stood on his tiptoes as he grabbed the man’s face with his hands, kissing those absolutely perfect lips.
“Clint how fucking dare-” Rumlow growled before shrieking in pain, Clint having shot him in the crotch without taking his eyes off Buck. Bucky watched Rumlow cry out in pain and curl into a fetal position for another moment before turning back to Clint. Not able to hold back any longer, Bucky yanked Clint closer by his jacket and kissed the man he was madly in love with.
“I don’t drink tea!” Steve blurted out, inwardly cringing even when Tony chuckled at his outburst. “I just mean...I don’t care that you have a pup. In fact, it makes me feel better knowing you didn’t just leave from a night of bad sex.”
"Right, that's not the point. The point is I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. So, Peter Parker Stark...will you marry me?" he rushed out.
When Steve told him he had to get going to help his grandma, Tony had been kind and offered to host next weekend.
“Alright Hulk, what do you wanna do?” she asked as she stretched her arms out wide. “We can play tag or run around the obstacle course?” she suggested before turning back to the giant, who was blinking his eyes slowly.
Currently, he could hear his parents arguing about whether or not his Dad was well enough to work in his lab. His sister was next to them loudly siding with their Pop.
His love chuckled into the kiss, which only warmed the blonde’s heart more, before pulling away enough to speak.
“This time, he got me,” he barely heard her whisper and whimper against him, feeling her small frame shake in his grasp.
