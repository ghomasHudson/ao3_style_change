His lips pressed into a thin line, his fists clenched, Castiel felt such rage like he had never felt before, and some of it was even directed at himself. He would always carry some of that guilt for being late that day...
"Dean... That's not..." He tried, not even sure of what to say. God, finding Dean like this would be a dream come true, but Castiel knew better. He knew this isn't really something Dean wanted, but thought he
he was out of the car, leaving Castiel baffled and smiling, his hand reaching out to touch his cheek in some disbelief.
"You're not asking. I am offering and you are agreeing. Unless you don't want to..." Castiel assured he wanted to do this, a part of his mind already coming up with a few other ideas, but he needed to make sure Dean really wanted this. That it wasn't some obligation.
Dean doubled down, coughing, feeling his throat burn and Cas was right there, his hand on Dean's shoulder, his voice filled with fear and his eyes filled with tears. "Oh, God, Dean, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to… I didn't mean to do that, I am sorry, I am so sorry, please… oh, God! I'm so sorry, Dean, shit! I didn't… I am sorry, please. Please, believe me."
"We tried everything, and judging by this... Nothing worked. Now there is only one thing that might help, but as it is, the next heat could just be intense enough to kill him." Pamela said without really answering Dean's question.
Across from their apartment, Gabriel heard someone giggling and a strange voice that had to be purposely twisted into sounding girly, and Dean huffed a smile. "Over there you got Garth and his mate Bess, she is an alpha. Her family was..." Dean just trailed off, shaking his head. Another couple, another sad, sob story. There seemed to be a pattern here, but Dean told him that from the start. Guess it is only now sinking in.
I just wanted to say,there will be no mpreg in this story. If I choose  to do it, it will be in a separate timestamp.
He twirled around it, securing himself on it with his legs as he turned so that his back was to the crowd. Just at a specific beat of the music, he spread his arms wide and let himself go, his upper body twisting backwards. It seemed like he was falling, and he could hear the muffled gasps as he practically laid on the pole, dangling upside down, securing himself with his hands beneath him. This way his abdomen and slightly impressive bulk came to a perfect emphasis while at the same time showing his flexibility.
“Oh.” Castiel let out a small whimper, feeling his heart stop, then hammer a few times before skipping a few more beats. After that, things were happening fast, but kind of in slow motion too. Dean was still on top of him, kissing his neck, tasting the skin, but his hand slipped down between them, only brushing at the base of Castiel's dick before venturing further back.
"Thank you." He said and paused, taking a deep breath. "For creating a diversion. I don't think I could have stopped myself from tearing him apart."
"Yeah, yeah, I have a spirit of an old lady with a bunch of cats. Shuddup." Dean replied blushing, but managed to make Cas smile, so he figured it was worth the embarrassment. Still, the moment he left the house, just like a few days ago, some sort of dread crept inside his chest and didn't let go until he came back.
before widening into a gorgeous smile, one which Castiel was happy to return. But all the little teasing aside, Castiel really had to return to his royal duties before Gabriel or Balthazar came to drag him away.
Those three little words brought back the exact memory he needed to remember the man. When he first heard moans coming from Adam's room and found it odd because they never entertained clients in their private quarters. He took a peek inside and was appalled by what he saw, but before he could say or do anything, Azazel found him, pulled him away and told him that Adam has a client with special needs and not to disturb them.
Because Zach seemed like that too. Until he revealed himself to be a controlling heartless bastard. How could he possibly know Dean won't turn out to be the same?
"Stay." He said, his expression soft and pleading. The air around them suddenly grew thick, making it very hard for Castiel to breathe, but he still nodded and stayed, his eyes trained on the green in Dean's. He listened to Dean breathe for a minute before he tried to get up, grunting, and Castile instinctively reached and grabbed his hand to help him up. Dean's back cracked again as he stood up straight.
"I can see you eying my living room. You're not cleaning it again." Said a kind, composed, soft voice behind the kitchen island. Dean looked up to see his brother's gaze, serious and commanding, yet filled with understanding, hiding in the shadows of the kitchen.
Castiel caught himself before he started to daydream and realized he has been in the bathroom too long and hasn't even started to shower yet. He quickly turned the water on and jumped inside, letting out such a girly scream when he was suddenly hit with cold water. God, he hoped Dean didn't hear that.
They watched Jumanji and then Kingsmen: The Secret Service and were just starting to watch the sequel Kingsmen: The Golden Circle when Castiel surprised Dean with a big bag of gummy bears, smiling widely when Dean's eyes filled with joy and excitement. He honestly didn't know where Dean fit it all, but as long as there was that enchanting smile on his face, he didn't care.
"I think it would be best if you leave before we decide to press charges for harassment. Your actions made Dean bite and claim my brother, and I am afraid if you keep pushing, I just might do the same to you." Gabriel said with a serious, deadly tone and Ketch flinched. Because, by law, if an omega like Gabriel claimed him, even if he was a Beta, the bond would be legally binding, because of the current extinction rate of omegas. Still, Gabriel would have to overpower him and his squad, and Ketch doubted he would do good on that threat.
"No, um... I think we're all set until it is time to start on the breakfast. I believe we are having a buffet today." Cas replied, his eyes darting everywhere, but always coming back to Dean's. A little blush dusted his cheeks and his tongue would come out to wet his dry lips occasionally. Dean was a goner.
"No. I find that mayonnaise helps diminish the dryness of the cooked yolk." Castiel replied, not stopping his sorting. Dean went back to working on another box, but didn't stop making small talk.
Now that Dean had an undeniable confirmation of that fact, he felt even more at fault. And he felt he had to do something. "Ma... Maybe I can..." He struggled, unaccustomed to speaking up at the clients. "Maybe I can give you a... A... A massage. You know, to help you relax." He offered, quick to add that last part, not knowing if it was for Castiel's or his own benefit.
Dean slowly turned, careful not to wake Castiel and as his was positioned just right, he slowly lifted his head, and started placing small kisses up the man's neck, so soft and light as a feather, they were barely brushing against his skin. Each time he would pull away half an inch, moist his lips and set them on the soft patches of skin. He could hear Castiel him in his sleep, the kisses probably sending little tingles throughout his body, but he was still fast asleep.
The note said and Castiel smiled back at him. He wanted to tell him that it was nothing, that he deserves this, and that everyone is just happy to help, himself included. But instead he leaned in and Dean eagerly turned to him to meet him half way in one nice, small brush of lips.
"... He does sound pretty bad. Anything we can do before you get here?... Okay... U-huh, okay. What? You want me to do what? No, no, no way, I ain't doing that." Dean protested by caved as soon as he met Castiel's scared gaze. "... Ugh... Alright... Walk me through it... U-huh. Okay. As hard as I can? Yeah, I got that last part. Just... Just get over here fast, okay?" Dean said ending the call, then looked over Gabriel with a deep sigh.
Instead of slowing down, Dean sped up, breaking into a sprint, squatting his shoulder and bracing for impact. He hoped it looked cool, thought it hurt like a son-of-bitch when he hit the door and they caved under the pressure, prying open with a loud bang. Dean was breathing hard from the adrenaline and stood his ground at the door, glaring at his alpha.
"Actually, I said the stairs would be a good exercise later on, but it would be hard for him to maneuver them now. You came up with the railing idea." Tony said and Castiel cleared his throat, frowning for a moment and then changed the subject.
"Please say you will." Sam tried, his eyes so round, they could move mountains. Puppies of the world, take a cue.
Although Dean said it with a smile, like it was good news, Castiel still felt a sharp, stabbing pain in his chest. If it were true, if they really were truemates, then it meant that Dean was manipulated by James solely because the lesser alpha smelled similar, because of their familial bond.
It was a little game they played, not a competition of whose vocabulary was more substantial, but rather to show what the other one was feeling or thinking at the moment. Dean contemplated what to tell her, or if he should even respond after her little joke, but eventually, he caved.
"Anyway... My name is Meg Masters. I do hope you are able to get them out. To help Sam." She said looking back at the shadow of a man that lied still on the bed next to Dean's. There was a heavy sigh and Castiel's attention was back on her and the whole Sam issue. Logically, Castiel knew that what she did here, concealing them and going against doctor's orders could be catastrophic for her career, even if she was right not to administer more sedatives into Sam's system. Castiel also knew that people like her were good folks, worth time and attention, help even. Right there and then he decided he would speak to Tony about her once they fixed this thing. But for now, he needed more information, on the treatments, on the good doctor and Sam's state in general.
"I wouldn't know about that," Lord Samuel said after the laughter toned down "but, if I have, there is only one I am hoping to get to keep." He reached into his inner pocket and pulled out a small picture of a lovely little girl with light blue eyes, curly blond hair and full lips stretched into a wide smile.
better? Dean was already mind-blown by not just the man's skill, but how he managed to make it dirty and gentle at the same time.
"Please, don't... Don't tell him." Dean's voice broke as he asked, tears piling back up. Benny let out another deep sigh and made a face, probably thinking he will regret the decision he made.
The house was huge, each floor clearly remodeled to house a family or a group of a few roommates, because the latter was more frequent these days. The ground floor seemed to be something of a common ground for all of them to socialize or whatnot. Dean lead them through a wide living room, with nice fluffy couches and a big size TV, surround system and shelves upon shelves of all sorts of books. Gabriel obviously peered up at the TV, while Castiel had his eyes filled with wonder as he took in the number of books they had. The room was so cozy and inviting, with a fireplace and so much room, it could house twenty people easily. Gabriel could really envision parties that could be happening here, or even just a group of friends sitting and watching the Super Bowl.
"Sam, I... I can't..." Jesus, his knees and thighs were ripping with a burning pain despite Sam's hands helping with the bounce, but he didn't want this to stop, he need it. He need to reach that peek and to feel that warmth of the sun that bathed the mountain and to feel it's rays shining down on him like he was the only thing in the world. Gabriel was loosing his mind.
"Don't worry, brother. It'll be just fine." Benny assured and Dean nodded before stepping out of the car and looked up at the grand five star hotel before him. He gulped, gathered all his courage and started walking towards the grand door. Reaching the door, he paused for a moment, closed his eyes and breathed in and out, trying to calm his nerves. When he opened them, all fears and doubts were gone, replaced with determination in those forest greens of his and he leaned on the door and pushed them open, stepping into the unknown.
Castiel's eyes fell closed as he tried to regain himself and stop the tears that were swelling up in his eyes. Michael must have taken it as confirmation as another heavy sigh fell from his lips. Castiel forced his eyes open to look at the poor little omega, the hurtful sight a punishment not nearly enough for Castiel. He should have been more careful, he should have checked that Elias knew. He should have worked harder to get Dean out. He should have saved him. He failed.
It was only after Castiel picked up his utensils that the rest of the table relaxed slightly and followed suit, continuing their meal. There was a light tap on his foot not a minute later, and Castiel looked up to meet Dean's eyes. The emeralds shone bright, yet there was mild concern in them as they motioned for Baron Bartholomew. It would seem that the man was still pale, and his hands were shaking as he slowly ate, his eyes still downcast. Dean's brow cocked up as if he was requesting permission. Prince Samuel wore a frown, displeased by whatever Dean was about to do, but Castiel nodded, interested to see what his omega was up to.
"Just a quick wash... I want you on the bed and not in the shower..." Castiel said, but it didn't sound like an order. Still it made a small thrill run up Dean's spine, the words making his cock twitch. In the bathroom, a regular, no big tub, no extravagance bathroom, Dean stopped, unsure what to do, then gasped as Castiel approached him from behind, undid his jeans and slid them down along with his briefs, then used a cloth soaked in warm water to wipe him clean. Slowly and tenderly, as he breathed down Dean's neck, making him shiver.
"Seriously?" Balth was amazed at the sudden enthusiasm. His phone dinged, indicating a text message, and Balth pulled it out of his pocket to see.
Uncle Bobby was nice when he let them stay with him, in his house, even if he seemed like a grumpy old man. He saw Dean was interested and curious about some of his guns, so he decided to show him how to properly use them, how to click the safety on and off, how to unload and reload the gun, to squeeze the trigger and not pull. Dean would always blame himself for dropping the gun and have it fire straight into Uncle Bobby's head, even if it would never have happened if dad didn't come in and screamed at him.
Dean gave him proof of that when he bit down on his lower lip, pure arousal washing over him, his eyes still fixated on his finger in Castiel's mouth. The feeling was... Amazing, and thrilling, the moisture of his mouth around the finger, the warmth of his tongue pressed against him. Dazed, he started to lean in, his own mouth parting slowly as if he wanted to get in on that action. His thumb rose up a bit and brushed over Castiel's lower lip and suddenly Castiel's tongue flickered out, twirled around the thumb too, pulling it in.
"I know it doesn't sound like it, but it is actually good news. Means that Sam is still in there. If he was calm, unresponsive after his awakenings, that would be a reason to worry, as it might indicate no brain activity, but this... There is hope, Castiel."
Castiel looked around, seeing all the small and big business around. He could be a florist? He always liked flowers, but wasn't much of an artist when it came to decorations. A book shop? That could be perfect. If only they were hiring. Oh, a restaurant! He could work there, serve food. Or at least be the bus boy. Or wash the dishes? There were many possibilities, and Castiel found himself a bit excited at the prospect of learning new things, which was really strange for him.
Fuck, he has so much on the line now. So much to loose. He felt hopeless before, but somehow he pulled through. Still he was younger, some things worked in his favor. They don't anymore.
Gabriel took his time looking around, all the time asking Castiel about his opinion, his input, annoyed that the alpha would barely lift his head to look. Castiel was normally like that, just not so much when they were alone. He must have been thrown off by the other's omega request to scent him and was being more shy then usual. The place itself was... Quiet nice actually. The rooms were simple - one king size bed, a night stand, a wardrobe and a dresser and a desk, all fitting nicely in the wide rooms. Simple and clean, but huge and roomy and fuck, were those memory-foam mattresses? The wardrobes had hangers and the dresser drawers had complementary packs of socks and underwear, unopened. A chocolate bar on the desk, complementary utensils and a journal.
The moment Castiel's arm hugged Dean and Castiel came closer to embrace him, his whole body leaning against Dean's, Castiel tensed. He forgot Dean has been through an extremely traumatic event and that this kind of a contact could trigger him, but Dean just seemed to purr again, melting against the warmth of another body by his side.
The sudden jolt of pure arousal that struck right through him almost made him do something he didn't want to do. And even though he was instantly hard as a rock, Castiel ignored it, closed his eyes and turned around wishing the image away. "Wha... What are you doing?" He barely managed, finding his throat really dry all of the sudden.
"So, what did you want to show me?" Dean asked and was that a blush? Castiel couldn't tell for sure. He motioned for the bed and why did he think Dean would understand and not jump to conclusions? "Your bed?" Dean asked and Castiel nodded as if it was clear as day what he was offering. Dean paused, as he glanced back at the bed and then looked up at Castiel, his face suddenly guarded and untrusting. "Look man... I think there was a misunderstanding here... I am glad you offered me food and a shower, but I don't... I didn't..." What was happening? Dean was getting riled up and also seemed on alert like Castiel would attack him over his words or something, so he tried to choose them carefully, but eventually ended blurting out what was on his mind.
"I think you using his first name in the article covers as grounds for everything else to build upon." Dean said and watched as Naomi's eyes widened, she obviously didn't know his name was Castiel, she thought it was the name of an angel Dean scribbled on the margins or something. Well, at least he broke that cold mask of hers with this last line, and had the satisfaction of shutting the door in her face and leaving her speechless and wide eyed.
"Oh, come on... Don't you want to blow off some steam? Don't you wanna..." Meg said reaching forward, her fingers walking up Dean's chest. She flattened her hand and let her palm caress all the way down his stomach. "... Bend me over that dryer? You can even pretend it's a guy?"
“Healed. Where are we?” Their words were completely irrelevant in this situation, all Castiel wanted was to tackle Dean to the ground and kiss him stupid, feel his body and touch him; yet somehow, he refrained, waiting for Dean to make the move Castiel knew he would make. Logically, he knew they were still under the influence of the plants, but he didn’t really care, there was no place for logic here.
"Hey, that was my half!" Dean fake pouted as they pulled back and Castiel just grinned at him. Dean picked another red one and plopped it whole in his mouth, but before he could even get a proper breath, Castiel launched forward and stole the bear right out of his mouth. Dean tried to look shocked and then to pout some more, but he couldn't stop laughing no matter how much he tried. He took another bear and threw it in his mouth, rolling it between his teeth with his tongue and teasing Castiel to 'come and get it'. And Castiel did.
"Would you mind if I went for a supply run real quick? There are some stuff I need..." Dean asked after he put away the stuff Castiel folded, some to his room, Castiel's things to the spare bedroom.
The only time his metaphorical mask slipped and fear flashed in his eyes was at the sight of the King’s chief minister, Cardinal Zachariah. A man Castiel knew. A man who stood idly and ordered the blacksmith to cast his face in iron. A man who knew his secret, and yet, had no idea who was standing before him and who he bowed to. Castiel managed to scold his expression back to neutral before the disgusting little man managed to lift his gaze, then with all of the delight, dismissed him. The Cardinal seemed confused for a moment by such behavior and Castiel had a fleeting thought that perhaps prince James and the cardinal had known each other better than it seemed.
sign, something flickered in those eyes that were watching him, and Gabriel gasped, then held his breath.
)... You didn't deserve to get yelled at because I... Because I... I got confused. I am really sorry, and... And it won't happen again... And I...I..."
"Trade you my toilet paper for your can of beans?" He said and Castiel just had to reciprocate the smile. It was just so easy, being around Dean. The man had a knack for making Castiel feel good about himself and for lighting up the mood. His smile was so contagious sometimes.
"It is Mick, actually. To my friends, at least. To you, I am Captain Michael Davis." Rookie spoke and watched as Ketch's eyes bugged out before turning to another member of their squad. "Please, put Mr. Ketch under arrest. I am stripping him of his rank and putting him in custody to await an indictment. Because he will definitely be charged with harassment and taking bribery and... Well, the list goes on." Then he turned to the rest as his former coworkers lead a shouting Ketch away.
"No, no. You didn't. You didn't. I... I'm the one who should be apologizing. When I saw you... When I smelled you, smelled how aroused you were and... God, you smelled so good and I just... I let it consume me, I let it blind me and then next thing I knew, I was running, and I shouldn't have and..."
Dean instantly pulled away and looked back at Castiel, that insecurity back in his eyes along with that inexplicable emotion. It was almost as if watching Dean lead an internal battle and trying so damn hard to be brave and to open up, to speak him mind as go for what he wants.
When Crowley asked Dean that night what song he would like to dance to for his first act, he was surprised to see Dean sadly shake his head and with a one shoulder shrug replied "Don't care. You pick." Not that he cared much about what was eating Dean up, but he still ended up asking him what was wrong. Dean just shook his head and went to his dressing room to get ready. Crowley gave an indifferent shrug back and went to choose a song for him.
"It's okay Cas. I'll put some ice on it, be as good as new in a few hours. Get some sleep, okay? I'll see you in the morning." Dean replied and Castiel heart ached. Dean was such a nice person, a good man, he didn't deserve to have a screw up like Castiel drag him down. He should just leave. Leave and never look back.
His alpha always made sure Dean was enjoying this, and is so caring and attentive and makes him cum twice almost every time, so he couldn't really complain. He could just lay there and be appreciated and looked upon as if he was the only thing that exists in the whole white world.
"I... I'm sorry... I didn't..." Castiel whispered, torn between his desires and his conflicting instincts.
"Hey, Baby. It's so nice to meet you." Castiel said enchanted by it, but felt his ears heating up when Dean chuckled at his greeting. He was totally fangirling over the car, and felt so embarrassed.
And then suddenly he turned and their eyes met, Dean's greens giving out uncertainty while those blue eyes stared at him for a moment. And then those eyes sized him up and Dean looked down, feeling himself withdrawing, feeling... Objectified. Why it bothered him now, he had no idea. Mr. Novak's face remained expressionless as he looked Dean over and then he moved to his left towards one of those chairs while taking off his coat and his jacket and loosening his tie.
in his lap, ready to be picked up and read. But Dean paused, taking a moment to think about it all, his life and his strange relationship he started, and the secrets that weighted down on him. He couldn't tell Castiel about all of his, not yet, but maybe... Maybe he could tell Sammy about him. Even if Sammy couldn't really hear him.
, but it wasn't happening, and Dean wondered if he got it wrong. Having never been on a date for real, he didn't know for sure.
"You know... You don't have to stay and go through the boxes, if you have something planned, or you know... Whatever..." Dean said snapping Castiel out of his thoughts and it took him a moment to figure out what Dean was saying.
But damnit, the pain was gone, replaced only by this shaky needy feeling of a heat, something Gabriel could handle much more easily. As he was finally able to breathe and think, he came to a startling conclusion that... The alpha was actually trying to help. And succeeded too.
While he was there, he might as well check to see if they needed any help. Balthazar said Alfie had a big exam today, but would be done with it by noon, so he was there to along with Meg and Balthazar. And Dean. And there were always other people, homeless people willing to pitch in if needed. But it wouldn't hurt to check and see if they still needed him.
Each day he would spend most of his time just sitting and watching Dean. Watching him sleep peacefully, knowing the drugs sent the nightmares away, and couldn't help but wonder how severe the mental damage was. He knew he would stand by Dean's side, be his support, be his rock, be whatever Dean needed him to be for as long as he needed him. But what if he didn't? Didn't need him? Didn't want him? What if he sees him as just another... No. No, he shouldn't think like that.
He opened his eyes when Castiel pulled his lips away, not yet retracting his hand and he watched him smile at Dean, kind and amused, and a small blush started to creep up his cheeks, feeling a but embarrassed by his reaction. Their eyes met, those vibrant blues piercing straight down to his soul.
Dean huffed a smile and craned his neck to look up at his alpha. “I am perfect.” His face must have had a sense of dopiness to it, because Cas smiled, but blushed adorably. “You didn’t hurt me.” Dean added, his tone a bit teasing, as if he was trying to convey the old
much having those big, strong alpha hands roaming and caressing his entire body, spreading the shower crème all over. Some parts tickled and Dean giggled, making the big, strong alpha laugh, and some parts were... Well, let's just say Castiel's touches easily turned from ticklish to erotic and Dean could feel the arousal creeping up on him again.
" 'course I do, Cas. Thank you." He said, then reached and took the man's hand, pulling it to drape over his shoulder, effectively making Castiel spoon him. But despite his best efforts, it seemed as though Castiel could feel something different about him. If only Dean would tell him what it was that was bothering him.
"Aaaaaaaagh!" screeched the big bad alpha, or at least he was supposed to be one, yet being startled awake by big round green eyes staring down from above would make anyone react in a similar fashion. Dean was up on his bed, on his belly with just his head perched out over the edge staring at a sleeping Castiel  who still preferred the hard floor to the softness of a bed. "Dean!"
Castiel told him over the intercom. Bet he wouldn't have said it if he knew Dean was on the other side. Truth was, Dean really didn't feel like he deserved a second chance, but was willing to earn it. So when he got home that night, he called his best friend, hoping she would help him out.
"Oh, Suicide Squad! That one looks good." He almost shouted, seeing a picture of Harley Quinn seductively licking her lip, her make up all smeared, her double ponytail twirled and blending into a pink-blue background. He just loves her craziness.
"I... I like burgers. Cheeseburgers. And... And bacon with eggs and..." Castiel saw Dean's eyes slip back to the food cart and the last part of his sentence came out so quiet and shy, Castiel couldn't contain his smile. "... And pie."
“I doubt James knew, the king wouldn’t intrust him with any real vital information.” Michael said, lifting his gaze back to meet Castiel’s. He paused, looking deep into Castiel’s eyes, then let out a small sign. “I think… I think the king believes that the prince… That you changed. He sees this stronger, bolder person and… I believe he thinks that the attack had something to do with it. And I… I don’t know if that is a good thing…” There was so much concern flashing in the alpha’s eyes, gone in less than a millisecond, but  Castiel saw it. Michael took a deep breath and stepped away, averting his eyes once more.
An hour later Dean saw Sam and Meg off, watching as she rolled Sam down the street in his wheelchair. Sam regained some feeling in his legs, but his muscles were still too weak to be able to move them, much less hold his own weight, but he didn't mind the wheelchair and enjoyed the walks he would have with Meg. They decided to walk downtown instead of bothering with a cab, the restaurant they were having dinner just a few block away.
And even though it sounded like they were just simply staying in his room until further notice, that statement bore a little bit more meaning to it, one that Castiel felt it was too early for Dean to discover. He needed his rest and his sleep, he didn't need to get his hopes up because of what Castiel thought could be done for Sam. It wasn't as simple as stopping the sedation. There were so many unforseen consequences that might come up and he needed to discuss them with Tony first.
"No. No, this isn't... You are so good to me. You are and I can't... I can't... I would do anything for you, but I can't, I just keep... I keep screwing up, like tonight, and... You keep being there when you have no reason to be..."
"There has to be something you like?" Dean tried and Cas averted his eyes, still looking uncertain and a bit timid. "Come on, I know there has to be something you like more then other things... Oh, wait, I know! Honey. You like honey, right?" Dean said and smiled when Cas snapped his eyes at him, surprised.
Last thing Dean figured and with a loud groan, was that everything hurt and his whole body felt somehow sore and off. His vision swam, but he still tried to focus and caught sight of a figure with dark hair with it's back turned to him. He blinked and the figure turned, just as his vision was clearing up. Castiel's worried face came to view and he smiled at him, relief washing over him as he remembered he made it. He made it.
"You may leave now." Mr. Novak said with his back turned towards Dean and Dean's eyes widened. No, no, no. No, something's wrong, he did something wrong. What... What did he do? No, this couldn't be happening. He wanted to say something, he wanted to scream. This couldn't be happening.
That's it! This story is cursed! Wanna know what happened? I had this chapter all written out, I saved my progress and something went wrong. Long story short, I ended up with the previous saved file, over half of the chapter gone. And the worst part was that I had to rewrite this, and I didn't have much time to focus, so... Let's say, the previous version was Castiel edited, so much better, I used fancy words and all. It was beautiful, I felt inspired. I am so sad I lost that. Now I know how Charlie felt. You all are probably going to like this just the same, but I know how it was before and I was so excited about it, finally feeling better.
Dean's eyes went wide, his heart stopped and he stumbled, nearly fainting at the sight of the big white limousine he knew too well. Benny was outside, leaning on it, waiting for him and as soon as he saw him, a wide smile spread across his face.
How does he tell Castiel he wanted to feel those soft fingers in his hair? Or those strong hands on his hips? Or those plush lips on his neck? Or his whole body pressed against him? His chest pressed against Dean's, his leg slipping between Dean's thighs, spreading them apart... His big, throbbing cock pressed right against Dean's, touching, brushing...
They waited for Cas to return and Frank issued him a new card once he came back with a copy of his ID. The man was so giddy and excited, his smile so bright and happy as he took his new card in his hand. The big hug he gave Dean took Dean's breath away, not having expected to be given a chance to touch the man, much less have him in his arms, however briefly.
Also, I got  to point out, this one has been my favourite  to write so far, so leave some comments after you're done, I would love to see if you liked it as much as I did.
Castiel clenched his fists, burring his nails in the palm of his hand hard enough to almost draw blood, trying SO FUCKING HARD to resist.
"More like it burnt down with he rest of my apartment." Castiel said, glancing downward, but when he lifted his gaze, there seemed to be a hint of concern in Mr. Crowley's eyes. Huh. Who would have thought?
"Yeah, Cas, they were just accidents, you're not like him, God! You could never be like him, he enjoyed  hurting others, enjoyed feeling superior, but that was because  he wasn't. He was a pathetic little  man and you are so much greater and better than he was, you gotta know that." Dean said, figuring Cas drew all of this from his nightmare. He felt a little guilty that he didn't hear him, especially after he realized he hadn't left the door ajar like he always did.
"Paperwork?" Ketch asked, brows raising in amusement. Never before was he able to get this much of a reaction out of Dean and it thrilled him to know he found Dean's soft spot.
The alpha's cock slotted against his hard dick and he gasped at the feeling, he had somehow forgotten about his own erection which was booming up again, despite his release from just minutes ago. His heat was really messing with his body and his mind right now, but he couldn't care less. All he knew was that there was a willing alpha and that he needed his one-eyed snake to hide in Gabriel's hole. So with a heavy heart, Gabriel abandoned that sweet friction and crawled up just a little more, then rose up, supporting himself with his trembling hands on the alpha's shoulders.
Over the next two days, they spent more time together, Dean being at the shelter almost from dusk till dawn, cooking, cleaning, helping out. Castiel tried to look up apartments to rent, and after Balthazar let him use his phone, he made a few calls, but all turn out to be a bust. They all asked for money in advance, money Castiel didn't have.
Dean's emotions were all over the place. He knew how important this was to Castiel and he really wanted to help, but they won't even call him and at least ask him about it or take the bag, to give to him. He said he would bring it and now he will fail Castiel just like he failed anyone who ever mattered in his life and once again he can't do anything to prevent that. He felt so helpless and conflicted because a part of him just wanted to break down and cry and the other part was just plain pissed. At himself, and those idiot guards, and the entire situation and at the whole fucking world. But mostly at himself for not making the small investment and buying a damn phone, instead choosing to save up for when Sammy...
"As long as you're sure, man. I mean, I could always go and try to fish something out of the bakery before it closes..." Dean offered, but they both knew that the bakery in question was already closed, so Castiel just shook his head and motioned for the man to follow him.
He let his hands slip lower, over the swell of Castiel's perfect ass, caressed to the right position and then squeezed and pulled him even closer, making Castiel gasp this time. He broke the kiss and looked down at Dean with an amused, but happy smile and Dean bit his lip as he stared back, a tad bit of defiance in his forest greens and Dean squeezed and pulled close again. Castiel's lips parted, sucking in a deep breath as Dean's actions caused that sweet friction that had his mind clouding up and his entire body to shiver. Dean's lips twirled in a semi-smirk, gone faster then it came and he pulled Castiel in for another deep, needy kiss.
Then she told Gabriel everything. How they lied to their friends and family and told them they sent her to a training centre, then packed and moved away. Because Benny knew exactly what goes on in those places, and especially to female alphas, and they couldn't let her go through it. They told him how they found sanctuary here, in the Winchester estate and so much more.
Next thing Gabriel knew, he was shaking Dean's hand over the contract he just signed. He did look over the papers and the only odd thing he found was a confidentiality agreement, which, if he thought about it, kinda made sense. Especially if they were housing alphas here. This way, they are all protected legally.
"Only if... If you...If you're ok with that..." It seemed like he wanted to say more, but didn't know how, so he just shied away from Dean's gaze.
It was Dean who broke the silence after a few minutes, saying they should probably get up and clean themselves up and Castiel perked up at that. "Oh. I made a mess... I should clean it up." He said mimicking Dean's words from a week ago, smirking and raising his brow to see if Dean would catch on. To that, Dean started laughing hard, and after managing to finally catch his breath, he replied before jumping off the bed but naked and bolting out the door.
Thank you so much for reading and leaving kudos and comments, they feed my hungry soul. I mean 175 kudos at this point is beyond my wildest dreams.
"Huh..." Dean said then, and Castiel was surprised for a moment to see the man blushing. "I guess this couch isn't big enough for the both of us, huh? Man, I was never so out of it to actually fall out of bed." He chuckled with a dose of nervousness in his voice. Oh. Yeah, they could go with that.
"Cas…" the sound slipped between two breaths as Dean let his body slowly glide over the angel's and Castiel's hand came up to grab Dean's shoulder, to steady himself. He could feel the remains of his own grace shimmering under the surface of Dean's shoulder, where he once left his mark, one long faded and healed, but they both knew where it was. Dean gasped as Castiel’s hand slotted in it’s former place, his hips jerked, causing that delightful feeling of friction, and both of them moaned as pleasure zinged through them.
Dean's heart swelled at those words, but before he could say a single word, Cas decided to add one more thing that simply threw Dean in a state of utter happiness and joy.
"Yes, please." Dean replied through his daze and could hear Cas' laugh. It was the most beautiful sound and Dean took a deep breath, like he was trying to inhale that sweet sound in his lungs.
"I... - a bip of his phone interrupted his thoughts - I got another call, Benny, hold on." Castiel pulled away, squinting his eyes at the unfamiliar number, but still, he put Benny on hold to answer it.
"I, um... I also remembered that other guy that tried to... That attacked Dean a few weeks back, and I got that guy's name - he is Alistair Gold, a private contractor that is slowly loosing his business, or so I have heard."
"Meg... One more out of you and I swear I will send you away without dinner." Balth said and was that fear in her eyes that flashed for a split second? Maybe there was more to Meg too then meets the eyes.
"Oh, shit!" He shouted and scrambled out if bed, wincing and hissing at the pain such fast motions caused. Castiel awkwardly tried to help him up, but Dean just pushed of the way and ran out the door, crossing the hall and stumbling into the other room where Sam was.
She screamed, Castiel even heard her, but Dean seemed unfazed, probably used to her squealing voice by now.
They spent a good hour just kissing and caressing and it felt better then... Well almost better then anything Dean ever experienced, not counting the sex, and it was only when both their stomach's growled that they broke apart, smiles tugging at their swollen lips.
"Um... Hello?" Cas said, his deep voice filled with insecurity. He was obviously uncomfortable, and maybe a bit scared.
"Sure." He confirmed with slight frown and watched as an excited smile crept up on his brother's face along with a strange look in his eyes... Oh! Could it be?
"Hey!" The other guard, Bart shouted, a stupid move because it only served to draw Dean's attention to him and make him run in the opposite direction. The hallways were empty, creepily so, and Dean ran past what looked like a small kitchenette, then the restrooms and rounded a corner only to find himself at a potential dead-end, with nothing in front of him by the doors to the Archives.
Castiel waited and waited, leaning up against his Toyota, but Dean didn't come out. He got held up at work, and was late to pick him up, so of course he thought that maybe Dean headed to the hotel on his own. But after talking to the receptionist who confirmed that his guest did not show up today, Castiel grew worried. He was just about to circle around and enter the club when the bartender walked out, grumbling something about being left alone to tend to the whole club as he took out the trash.
"Whatever you want, forget it. If they find out, I will deal with it. If they hate me for it, they hate me."
Castiel, on his part, was speechless. The late Queen was his mother, King Charles his father? Prince James was his brother? His identical twin brother. He huffed an ironic laugh, finally understanding why his face was kept hidden all these years. If it were true, if he shared a face with the crown prince, of course they would want to hide his face, hide his existence. But why not simply kill him? Why keep him alive? Gabriel did say prince James was the smaller one, the weaker one. Maybe Castiel was their contingency plan?
Well, that worked. Not having expected Sam to be so blunt, Gabriel choked on nothing but thin air and coughed so hard, Sam had to tap him on the back a few times. And then he turned his big, hazel eyes at him, and just stared and stared as his lower lip shook.
It was a month later that he saw a faint shadow of that spark in his eyes and a small, tiny smile and it wasn't even directed at him. He stood to the side and watched as Dean handed Balthazar a piece of paper, watching as the man's eyes grew wider as he read on.
"Cas..." Gabriel tried, setting his hand on his brother's left shoulder only to have him shove the hand away, rolling his shoulder. A small growl escaped him, making Gabriel's eyes go wide. His brother never growled at him before.
"I dreamt I had some chocolate on me and you kissed it clean." What kind of an apology was that? That wasn't what he wanted to say. Dean moved again, his wide eyes looking up at Castiel's before they glanced down on his lips. Probably thinking a man such as Castiel wouldn't get this worked up over a dream of Dean kissing his lips, Dean chose this to ask.
The alpha growled, drawing Dean's attention to his face and more specifically to his blood red eyes. Cas was still consumed by his inner Alpha and his desires, and probably will be a little dismayed about what happened, but he would be able to feel it, to understand it once his knot swelled inside a willing omega for the first time. And Dean would be there for him.
Why was he trying to get away from Dean, the man did nothing but be kind to him and helped him and fed him and fuck, fuck, FUCK!!! Castiel snapped around, limped into his room and shut the door loudly before falling face first on the bed. He hated himself at that moment.
"Well, okay, gotta run now, but when you'll all settled in, I can come by and set up the internet for you, add a rooter to your room and a Wi-Fi hotspot. Introduce your room to the 21st century." She said and then let them pass before heading down the stairs.
For about a minute. Sam was supposed to be punished, not having a field-day here, besides, Gabriel was in heat. His needs took priority. Gabriel gasped as the thought settled in his head. The mere idea of being someone's priority would have been absurd to him before, but since they came here, things have changed. And continue to change.
It was eating him up, what he was forced to do to Castiel and the worst part was that he probably blew all chances he had with the shy alpha. Something ached deep inside his chest and like Alien threatened to rip itself out through Dean's rib cage, splattering blood and flesh the place then hiss at him and jump out to flee. Sam would probably chase after it while Dean would just sit there, sad and lonely, knowing that even his own heart wanted to run away from him.
Dean even tried to apologize. Or at least Cas thought so. Why else would he show up at the shelter? Was that a box of chocolates he had? Maybe he was on his way to a date, and wanted to stop by and... Gloat? No, taking perverse pleasure in other's humiliation was Daphne's thing, and Castiel learned that people like that needed a bigger audience, and would go about it much more dramatically. But then... Why was Dean there?
From how big of a crime was the price of toilet paper to the fact that the city should set aside more funds to help out the shelters. It was just so entrancing to watch and listen to him go on and on about all the possibilities and opportunities this city could offer to the less fortunate, and when a random bystander started arguing about Dean being one of the privileged and how easy it was for him to talk a big game, Dean easily shut him up with the fact that he and his brother were basically homeless their entire childhood, and he knew how it was. That discovery, that little piece of information really stuck with Castiel who laid awake that night in a tent bed in the shelter and tried not to envision a very younger version of Dean, begging for food for his little brother.
They parted ways with a promise too see each other again soon, and Nick gave him his phone number, to have just in case. Castiel was held up a bit that day, he called and Crowley passed on the message, so Dean ended up sitting in his room waiting for him, and thinking it all through. He was happy, truly happy about Nick and that he found what he was looking for, but it had him questioning himself.
That night, when they finally got home, and funny how Cas never saw the penthouse as home until he found someone to share the space with, they were both smiling happily, looking back on a perfect day, but also filled with anticipation of a perfect evening. Because Dean said he would tell him what he wanted tonight. What Castiel didn't know is that Dean wanted to tell him everything, but driven by the constant arousal of the whole day, he would choose the physical intimacy first.
"Yeah. Ezekiel ripped your pants went he checked your leg, so those are gone. The shirt, hoodie and jacket were soaking, so I put them in the washer. I took your bag too, it's in the hall. I didn't want to go through it, so I... I gave you one of my shirts and... I was thinking after you woke up, you could take a shower and I would change the sheets so that you could rest more. I got breakfast ready if you want to eat." Dean pushed the words out, forcing himself to maintain eye contact with Cas, to follow his reactions and hope, hope so damn much Cas wouldn't tell him to go to hell, or scream his head off and run away or... Whatever other scenario Dean wouldn't allow his head to make. Fortunately, Cas' stomach growled at that exact moment, making Cas go wide eye and look away while his cheek blushed all over again.
Luckily Castiel was a kind and gentle person, already somehow obedient and cooperative, so he wasn't hurt... Much. He was forced to partake in some questionable activities, but his brother never knew and Castiel didn't think it was something that was wrong, so he never said anything. Now, the alphas that survived such places could leave if someone bought them, or a family member claimed them after a certain training period. Needless to say, a person that took responsibility for them couldn't be an alpha themselves, but would receive monthly payments for their service to their country.
Dean ran a little late on the third day. Naomi called him and grilled him for the topic of his next article, and he pretended it was a secret, but the truth was, he didn't have the slightest idea what to write. In fact, he had no desire to write at all. Still she let him off the hook for now, and Dean knew it was because of the success of his previous work. It took him a month to come up with it, and three months of research, but in the end, his article had so much effect on the issue he presented, and a great circulation for the newspapers, that Naomi gave him a break.
"Yes..." Dean agreed or was saying he wanted to feel more or he was calling himself beautiful, it didn't matter; he was too lost in following that soft pedal as it roamed over his chest and then his stomach, making his breaths turn into pants, making him arch his back yearning for more.
"Help? What do you... No, no, there... You... You should lay down, rest. You should... Something. Do something for you not..." Balthazar didn't even know what to say. He had never encountered someone in this situation, despite being surrounded by homeless people all the time. He never had to deal with their emotional needs like he felt compelled to do for Castiel. And as much as Castiel appreciated it, right now...
"Dean? Is everything alright?" a voice interrupted his train of thought, making him finch. He looked up to Mr. Novak and felt struck. His lips parted in slight surprise at the sight of the man with his hair still wet and wearing a bathrobe, probably nothing underneath it and God that was so freaking hot and...
"I... I'll be fine." Dean said looking down, feeling ashamed. But it wasn't like this was the first time something like this happened even if it was a first that someone stepped in and saved him. "I just need... To clean up and to..." He wanted to lay down and just curl into a ball, but he couldn't tell Benny that.
The sight alone was so arousing, not to mention the sound and Dean felt his cock twitch with great interest as Castiel threw his head back and moaned while Dean's forefinger breached him. It was warm and tight inside and for a moment Dean thought of how it might feel, to have his dick burried deep inside. The idea shot another jolt through his system and he really needed to calm his mind otherwise he won't be able to make it to that part.
Dean giggled so hard, he accidentally snorted like a little piggy, causing them both to burst out laughing. As he laughed, Castiel couldn't help but be amazed how Dean always managed to make him all giddy and happy, rendering him to a child with everything he could show him. He always awoke that fun streak in him, one Castiel never thought to have had. Dean just made him... Happy. And so alive.
But then, there was a small, appreciative smile on his face and Dean understood. He understood that Cas needed this. Needed to feel at least a bit useful for this to work. Dean could manage that.
Has he really pushed that hard and ignored the man that he drove him away? Was it too late to try and reprimand things between them?
Dean shook his head unable to find words, lowering his head and feeling so ashamed, until Mr. Novak spoke up again. "Well, I am sorry. I should have woken you up and got you in a proper bed so that... Oh, God, I didn't... I didn't mean it like that, not... I thought so that you could rest...I didn't... I wasn't trying to..."
"I know." Dean whispered to his ear, his voice a bit shaky. Castiel could feel the shudder that went thought Dean's body, not sure if it was alright to be glad about it, but he still was. He was okay. They were okay.
Finally, Dean finished the dance and moved away a bit, but Michael grabbed his hips once again. He took out three bills, three hundred dollars, but instead of shoving them down Dean's underwear, he reached and shoved them in Dean's mouth. Dean was too slow to react and Michel took that opportunity to rip his exotic underwear and take his hard dick in his mouth. Dean's hands flung down to the man's head and he took a fistfull of hair in each as he tried to pull him away, his voice muffled by the money. Michael actually allowed himself to be pulled away before he gripped Dean by the ass and slammed him back into his mouth, hitting the back of his own throat.
He was a bit weirded out by Mr. Novak's wide smile when he said it and the next thing he knew he was following him through the hallway to another room. He thought for a moment how big this penthouse had to be, feeling a bit lost in the hallways already, but then they were entering a very dark room. Dean held his breath until Mr. Novak flipped the switch. He never told anyone, but he was afra... uncomfortable in the dark.
"I got bacon and eggs and waffles..." Dean dared a small hopeful smile and he could see Cas swallow hard, not daring to look up, then give the tiniest nod Dean had ever seen. Dean couldn't stop the wide smile that spread upon his face as he replied that he would be right back, then scrambled out of the room.
Some commotion caught his attention and he frowned at the door and stood up to see what's going on. He walked to it, but just two steps before he could reach it, someone stumbled in, shut the door and leaned into it, using his own body to barricade it. The man turned towards Castiel, his green eyes filling with relief and sparking up as they met Castiel's blues. And even though he was panting hard like he just ran a marathon, he still smiled widely at him.
There were also useful things they didn't expect to find - like a few good pots, three Swiss army knives and super glue. They also found clothes and shoes, some of those almost new.
Dean stepped into the spray and hoped that it would wash away some of the shame he felt. Because if it was true and his weak mind thinks that he
The rose touched down on his palm and he fought hard, resisting the urge to close his hand around it and keep it in place, fighting the urge to keep all these feelings and clinging onto them when there was a possibility of more.
A breath of relief escaped him when he managed to stabilize himself, huffing a laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation. It wasn't something heavy he was carrying, it was just toilet paper. He reached to place the box on the shelf once again and in that moment Dean entered the room and said his name, startling him. The ladder wobbled again, but this time, Castiel lost his balance and shouted as his legs slipped. He heard Dean yell his name again and the next thing he knew, he hit the soft ground with a loud crack.
Dean started threshing around, trying to free his hands somehow, but they were bound tightly by those damn vines and he couldn't snap them away. Distantly, he heard Cas’ voice calling out to him, but he refused to acknowledge it, something building up in the pit of his stomach, sending tingles up his spine. The branch swayed under his weight, small cracking noises echoing in the empty forest and an idea occurred to him, so he started threshing harder.
All in all, it had been a good day, the jailor didn't spill his mush when he threw the tray into the cell, the bread didn't roll into mud or worse, into shit, and he accidentally got a double scoop of water, because the jailor forgot his cellmate was deceased. Best of all, the cherry blossom was slowly turning into the actual fruit, little dots of red in those vibrant green leaves shining some color into Castiel's life. It had been a good day, and Castiel had no indication that it was about to become even better.
-ed and a small smile flashed on Dean's face and Castiel caught it and mimicked the smile, thinking it probably reminded Dean of the elevator in their penthouse. Some strange form of happiness sparked up in Castiel's heart knowing that Dean would get to hear that sound of their elevator once again, that he will bring him back home and snuggle next to him and maybe... Be happy?
Dean took a deep breath as if he was summoning all his bravery before looking back up at Castiel. Their eyes met and Castiel awarded him with a smile and a nod, pleased. Dean nodded in return. "I got something for you. I managed to slip after breakfast, I know you haven't eaten, so I brought you these." Castiel said, taking out two bundles wrapped in a napkin and settling them down on the table before moving to his dresser. He glanced back at Dean and seeing that the omega was reluctant to move, Castiel urged him on. “Go on, take it.”
Was the kiss something Cas thought he owed Dean, for letting him stay? Oh maybe he was just happy because he managed to finish his work and the kiss was a spur of the moment. What if he regretted it? It was very hard sometimes to figure out what Cas was thinking. At one point, Dean even had a fleeting thought that the man didn't want to help Charlie with the edits, but felt compelled because of Dean? He really needed to talk to him, to clear the air.
Sighing, Gabriel left those thoughts at the threshold and started his ascent to his apartment. Half way through, right on the first floor he was startled out of his drowsiness by large hazel eyes, staring at him. He blinked forcing his brain to function and caught a glimpse of a long, dark blond ponytail whipping away and running, followed by the sound of a door slamming.
Maybe he should have waited and asked for the omega to explain himself. Demanded it even. That is what a real alpha would do. But he isn't a real alpha, he is just this small pathetic thing. Not worth a nickel, not worth anyone's time.
"The article he did before, about the homeless, and the last one, about me and our shelter brought enough attention to make people act. We received a lot of donations and offers, the city even donated the vacant building and some big shots poured money into rebuilding it so that they could look good in front of it. But the bottom line is that the people get a more comfortable place to stay, running water and warmth for this upcoming winter, so we don't really care why they did it." Balth said looking over at both of them with a wide, pleased smile.
Last night he was just happy to get a chance to cuddle next to his Alpha and fall asleep. He understood Castiel's reluctance to knot and to mate, and he didn't want to push, no matter how ready he felt. A part of him really wanted it to happen and just like he presumed, the light touch, the slow build-up, everything was perfect. It hadn't erased what happened before, nothing ever could, but it was another step towards him being better.
Castiel was almost done with the whole thing when he noticed that Dean had curled up next to him on the couch, dozing off. He seemed so peaceful, and so adorable with his head pillowed on the couch side, his knees curled to his chest, his entire body turned towards Castiel as he had observed him before falling asleep. Castiel felt so unworthy, but also so happy to be here with Dean.
"Y...Yes." Cas breathed out arching his back a bit, to make more contact with Dean. Dean huffed in amusement, the hit breath landing on the crook of Castiel neck, making him him.
They stayed like that for a while, kissing, their legs intertwined, their hands roaming the other's body, both getting drunk with the feeling of another so close and so willing. Castiel's lips parted, but didn't go far as the man continued to trail hot kisses over his jaw and then slowly down the neck. He could hear Dean's deep rugged breaths and could actually feel the goosebumps that started to crawl on Dean's skin and he knew Dean was really enjoying this. His lips traced lower, over Dean's chest and down to his nipple and he just brushed over it with his wet lower lip and then ghosted over it, letting his breath affect the hardness of the bud. Dean whimpered at that and Castiel glanced at him only to see his lips parted and even though his eyes were closed, it was still obvious how good he felt.
When Castiel woke up an hour later, his knot already out of the omega, he was so apologetic and sincerely concerned about Dean, especially when he saw him hiss and walk awkwardly. He offered to help in any way he could, to carry the omega, to fetch him food or water, he even offered to bathe him. It all sounded very tempting, but it went against Dean's inner nature so he had to decline. Still, when the omega suggested a short shower, Castiel eagerly agreed, then did his best to clean Dean himself. And Dean let him. To ease the alpha's worry. Solely that, no other reason at all.
Dean tried to breathe as he drove, but some gut feeling  was telling  him that he should  hurry up. Could be just his nerves, or could be that Cas reacted badly over something he wrote, and that this might deeply affect them. Scared that Cas might even leave, Dean pressed the gas pedal a bit harder, wishing he was already  in his apartment.
"As for doctor Helbreder..." Tony started tentatively and Castiel snapped his eyes at him, sharp focused. "...I know you wanted to make sure he paid for what he did, but I have already taken care of that. Half an hour ago, police knocked on his door, informed him that he had lost his medical licence, was fired and will be taken into custody to await for trial. Brady, with Charlie's and Nick's help already filed a malpractice lawsuit, and together we have set things in motion. Benny and Balthazar filled us in on some other details that helped and... I know you wanted to personally attend to this, Castiel, but we all felt it was more important for you to be with Dean and focus on him right now. We got this."
Sam circled the bed and came up to Gabriel, towering over him like a statue of a freaking Adonis or something and offered a glass of water. "Here. Sugared water." Sam said and waited until Gabriel gulped it all before he asked him if there was anything else he could do.
"Touch him." Michael said, his voice so soft and low, Castiel thought for a moment that he imagined it.
"Honestly... – Castiel turned a bit serious even if he still had a smile on his face – I don't remember when was the last time I had this much fun. Thank you, Dean."
But he would always blame himself for that truck driver that fell asleep at the wheel, missed a stop sign and slammed into their car from the right side. Dad was killed on the spot, but Sam...
When Dean walked down to the basement to meet with Cas and take him home, an empty desk awaited him and he looked over to Charlie for explanation. She seemed really uncomfortable as she let out a deep sigh, glancing his way but not meeting his eyes. "Red?"
"Come. Come, my Omega." Castiel soothed, but instead of turning Dean back around, he lead him backwards to his lap. Dean went willingly, too dazed to understand what was happening until he felt that big cock at his hole. He gasped and whined as he slowly slid down the alpha's member, bracing himself on Castiel's legs. Once he reached the base, fully situating himself in the alpha's lap, he sighed a breath of utter relief and content.
But as he walked back to his desk, the glee he felt slowly diminished and was replaced by this empty feeling, sadness and guilt weighing him down. Why the hell didn't he tell Cas the truth? Why didn't he just fess up and told Cas who he was and why he was doing this? Cas would understand, Dean was sure of it.
The previous chapter came a bit short, so it is messing with my plan, and I had to cut this one short too, as I wanted to portray the whole recovery process, but you guys only get some of it. So sorry, but there is a future chapter that simply has to start at one specific moment and… Yeah, I am ranting. Never mind, ignore this. Just write me a comment, tell me if you liked this.
"I suppose you are here to see the big man upstairs, huh? If only you could go around those pesky guards and get into that elevator... Or the stairs, right? But you need is an access key. And I don't suppose you have one?" He said as he slowly got up and weaseled his way towards Dean.
Dean leaned, letting his hot breath on Castiel's neck be the only warning the alpha would get before he let his jaw dropped. He bore his teeth out and sunk them in Castiel's mating gland. The alpha screamed and whaled like a wounded animal and it was so much, it was too much, but Dean only tightened his bite, knowing he just doomed himself. At least Castiel would be safe. And that was the only thing that mattered.
Castiel frowned and did his trademark head tilt like he would any time he didn't get a pop culture, movie or music reference. "Oh, man, don't tell me you haven't seen
"I... I can... I can feel your heartbeat." He whispered, blushing and lowing his head, and all Castiel wanted to do was grab his chin to bring his gaze back on him and to set a soft, chaste kiss on his lips, just to show how that that little line made him feel all warm and tingly inside, but he refrained, not wanting to derail Dean from his current mission.
"D... Dean?" Dean flinched to the sound of his name and he refocused on Castiel seeing fear? in his eyes. Fear and uncertainty and a plea of sorts and... oh! He must have thought Dean snapped again traumatised or something, but Dean wasn't really that fragile... Right? Anyway, he needed to assure Castiel that he was... well, more then alright.
Together they helped Balth make breakfast, and serve it too, working together so easily. Dean seemed to know exactly the right time Cas would need another pair of hands with a tray, while Cas seemed to have great timing when it came to Dean needing salt or a knife. Often than not they would flash each other a smile, Cas' one much shyer then Dean's, but still there.
"Can... Canwestayhere?" Dean mumbled, looking down on the ground after glancing at Castiel and seeing the suspicious look in his eyes. But then, he must have figured out why Dean would want to stay, he must have figured out Dean was still reluctant to be in public, and that he would feel better in the safety of Castiel's current home, and dared he hope, Castiel's arms. Dean heard him huff a polite smile before he walked over to Dean and set his hand on Dean's shoulder. Such a nice, friendly gesture, but Dean wanted nothing more then to tilt his head and brush his cheek over the man's hand like a damn cat.
Why alphas were viewed as nothing more then feral animals, even if most weren't, why they were always so heavily medicated and and took hormone supplements to alter their body chemistry, so that if they ever mated, they wouldn't produce more alphas, but betas.
They walked down and knocked on the door, even if it was technically (still) Cas's home, they were being polite. Gabriel sailing the door open and smiled widely at the couple.
"Come on, Pam! Screw doctor/patient confidentiality. Look at him. He needs help. Tell me how to help him." Dean said, and Pamela glanced at the other omega's sleeping form, biting down on her lower lip.
But Cas was alright. He was at the shelter when Dean reached it, safe and sleeping there like it was no big deal. Like it didn't matter that he didn't have a bed of his own to sleep in. Like it didn't matter that he didn't have a roof over his head. Like none of it was of any importance. It made Dean's heart clench harder, made his chest ache, because this kind, sweet man didn't... He didn't deserve it.
"Come back to me, Gabriel..." A voice whispered in his ear and Gabriel blinked his eyes open, standing outside of the booth, squeaky clean and dry, with a towel around his waist and an alpha holding him close to his bare chest.
"Hey, hey, no, no, no… I didn't tell you this so that you'd feel guilty over something you had no control over. No matter what, you could not have prevented it, okay?" Dean closed any space that was between them, his hands reaching to grab Castiel's, to give as much comfort as he could. The omega should not be the one offering consolidation. Castiel was trying hard to find the words to show he was still remorseful about what happened, but Dean wouldn't allow it, he simply kept talking.
What was he even thinking? How would it even work? His entire company depended on him, and his time and with this merger happening he was supposed to be working even more, but he just kept blowing off work and... Well, Charlie has been his second in command for a long time, she did deserve his trust and she could do this... She told him so. She told him to try and have a bit of fun and...
"What do you mean you can't issue me a new Card? I need it, I lost... I don't have my driver's license nor my ID, and I need the card to..."
Cas stared at him for a few moments, eyes even wider, clearly affected by what Dean said. "You... You care about me?" Dean paused, just looking at him, then took a deep breath and released it.
He was getting sleepy, but pushed himself to watch the movie till the end, not really eager to move. Or was it more like that he didn't want Dean to move? Halfway through the movie he felt Dean snuggle in even closer, and he thought he heard a hum coming from him but he wasn't sure. It was only when the ending credits started to roll that Castiel moved just a bit, confused as to why Dean wasn't.
"My soap for a few cans of peaches?" Dean said next and Castiel huffed a laugh as he passed him the requested items and took over the soap. Soon they had enough in each box, so Dean said he would take the cans to the kitchen and would come back for the toiletries, so Castiel nodded and went back to work. When Dean returned to crack open the next box, they exchanged smiles and just dug right in.
"Oh, Jesus, fuck!" Dean slurred as Cas altered from long, flat tongue licks to probing at his tight little hole (or his chocolate starfish if you believe the Urban dictionary). The omega burried his head back into the pillow to muffle his shouts, but it only spurred the alpha on, and soon, Dean had to come up for air. It felt so darn good, the alpha's tongue prodding and teasing while his colossal hands kept his cheeks apart. The subtle stubble just rough enough to make everything so much hotter, enhanced by the alpha's heavy breaths slowly drove Dean crazy.
Dean smiled again as he ordered Chinese when he got home, remembering how they shared their meal the other night. Maybe Cas wanted the soup for himself, but let Dean have it? The nice thought quickly turned up a sour feeling because yeah, Cas did that to indulge him, thinking he was a homeless man. Dean just plopped down on his couch, leaving the food intact, suddenly not feeling all that hungry with the guilt weighing him down. He curled up on it and just laid there, not bothering to even drape a blanket over himself. Maybe he didn't feel like he deserved one? Maybe he didn't feel like he deserved to spend the night in his soft, memory foam bed?
All he had to focus was leading the alpha back to his apartment, but every time he heard Castiel howl, his legs wanted to cave and stop, present for his alpha as waves of arousal crashed over him. No, he had to hold on just a little bit more.
Mr. Novak pressed play and then he looked up at Dean. And as Dean stood there in front of a large screen, he wondered what the hell it all was. The night before was hot and steamy and then something happened and all of a sudden he was... having dinner with him and now... a movie night?
"Thank you, Dean. You have no idea how much this means to me." Cas said after he pulled away and it was Dean's turn to blush.
Skipping two steps at a time, Dean went up the stairs and walked over to Castiel. The man clearly wanted to speak up, but Dean wouldn't let him, shutting him up with a hungry kiss. Muffled murmur came from Castiel, but soon he let go, falling completely into Dean's control as Dean kissed him with such desire, it made his head spin. Dean's hands started roaming Castiel's body, as he pushed him to walk backwards, straight into Dean's room.
Cas' eyes went wide as they drove closer to the shelter, and Dean couldn't help be amazed too. He knew Balth had offers to expend the shelter, money donations, since it was an election year, but he had no idea things would move so quickly. In just a few days that they were away, the rundown building next to he shelter was bared down, and they began redoing it, fixing it up for housing. There were three shipping containers, one set up for the workers and two fixed up to house people until the building was finished.
"Did your novel have a title?" Dean heard Charlie ask, but he didn't pay much attention, his heart aching for Cas, his mind filling with anger towards that sleazebag.
He still remembered how soft Cas's sheets were, how his pillow smelled nice, but nothing flowery or girly and how good it felt to fall asleep in a warm bed after months of being on the streets. Not even his own bed felt so welcoming the next day. His memory foam didn't forget him, but it wasn't the same, and Dean just couldn't figure out why.
"Ok. Good. Great!" Mr. Novak said, and then calmed just a bit to lock his eyes with Dean's as he said again "Good morning."
And suddenly he wanted Dean to want it, to want him. He wanted Dean to feel the same attraction he did, but he also wanted it to be... Deeper. Meaningful. Why now all of a sudden, he had no idea, maybe it was just the right moment, maybe it was because he was getting old, or maybe... Maybe he was just waiting for someone like Dean and didn't even realize it?
With his mind set on talking to Dean during breakfast, he motioned for the man to sit. He set a plate with a small dome in front of him and one in front of Dean and said with a hopeful smile. "Well. I hope you like what I chose." With that, he lifted his little dome to reveal spinach egg-white omlette with roasted zucchini on the side.
"Of course, what kind of a man do you take me for?" Mr. Crowley sounded appalled. "If we happen to find it, we will give it back. I certainly wouldn't publish it under my own name, or anything of the sorts. Besides..." Mr. Crowley said and leaned in, his voice much more quiet and sinister then it was seconds ago. "...I would most certainly try to persuade you to allow us to publish it under your name. If a let's say... Fergus McCloud, a Irish nobody published it, it wouldn't sell nearly as good as it would if it was published by Castiel, the angel of Kansas City. Publicity is everything, darling."
"I am new to this town, so I don't know what it has to offer... But maybe we could just take the opportunity of the nice day and just... Start with a walk?"
I am dying to know what you guys think? Did you like the turn of events? Why do you think Castiel reacted like that at the offer?
"Sure thing, red. Thanks." Gabriel said actually looking forward to that. Meeting knew people was always a struggle for him, especially if they know or find out he has an alpha brother he is responsible for. And here is another alpha, walking freely around, even smiling and joking a bit, dressed in colors of rainbow and unicorns. Curious thing. He did wonder who is her guardian, but knew better then to outright ask.
Wallowing in all those bad emotions and allowing the dark thoughts to fill his mind, Castiel completely disregarded his ringing phone until the thing died on him some time around 7 pm, and spent his day curled up on the bed, wearing nothing but that damn trenchcoat and trying to stop his heart from wanting to explode on him, as more doubts filled his mind. Around 10 pm, he heard a familiar
Still, Castiel now had that smile on his face and Dean was responsible for making him smile, and it made him feel good. He did something good. Hell yeah, he did something good, he felt so proud of himself. Like making Castiel smile was equivalent to solving world hunger... Speaking of, Dean's stomach suddenly growled and he immediately blushed knowing Castiel heard that.
Despite being thrown off by the question, he quickly gathered his shit and replied without thinking "Sure, why not?" Damn it, he should have said something a bit more smooth. Maybe Alistair was right all along, maybe that mouth of his is only good for sucking cock and nothing else.
That night the nightmares came again. And as Daphne mocked and laughed in his face as Zach tied him up again and breached him with minimum preparation while he cried and wailed and whimpered, it was Dean that came to his dreams and punched Daphne in the face and pushed Zach off of him and out the window. He untied Castiel, caressed his sore wrists as he held him close, rocking back and forth, repeating that it will all be okay.
"Thank you." Dean shot back, getting up. Mr. Novak wanted him to take a shower and he is going to take a shower. Mr. Novak would probably want to join him at a point. And that was fine. It was his shower.
"You mean we were the Musketeers of King Chuckles army." Gabriel interjected, and Balthazar threw him a stern glare before refocusing back on Castiel.
"It's ok, Dean. You shouldn't try to speak yet, it will only hurt. Let's finish this and then we'll talk, okay?" Castiel suggested and Dean just nodded, taking his lead. How will he talk without speaking was something he will see in a bit. Only after Castiel scooped the last of the soup and fed it to Dean, did his angel speak up again.
Dean suddenly broke the kiss and waited for the clouds in Castiel's head to clear before he spoke. "I want you."
Dean's heart stopped beating at the sight of a man so broken, a man he cared deeply about, but when he tried to comfort him, when he reached out to him, it only caused Cas to cry out, and curl into himself and start sobbing, so Dean did the only thing he could.
Going back to his room, he quickly changed into the oldest jeans and shirt he had, figuring it will all be ripped off of him anyway and hurried to Azazel's office. He just barely missed Alistair who came from the front and entered the men's room. Dean knocked twice on the boss's door and opened them, Azazel's only throwing him a glance before pointing to the back door. "Car's waiting outside."
Gabriel took a deep breath as he exited his apartment. It was their fifth day here, and today he was supposed to start working at a bar called The Roadhouse. Not his first choice, he was a baker after all, but all things considered, he was lucky enough to get this. He would be altering from bartending to manning the grill, depending on the crowd. He would get days off when his heat hits and he of course had to inform them about his status as an alpha owner. God, he hated that name. But Ellen just asked if it would affect his work and when he assured her his brother won't be a problem at all, she surprised him by saying she would like to meet him someday.
"Could we... Could we go see the guys at the shelter?" He asked with a slight stutter. There. He proved it. They didn't have to go to Dean's work, they could go where he wanted, right?
"Sorry." Dean sympathized with a small comforting smile on his face. "You know, we are almost halfway through this, maybe we can call it a day and start fresh tomorrow?" He offered after Castiel went to run his hand over his face, then realized that hand touched the penis pump, making a disgusted face at his own hand.
For a long moment, the smell of food and the hollowing emptiness of his stomach was forgotten when those brilliantly green eyes snap in his direction. They smiled, the small crinkles around them conveyed some sort of joy and it was directed at him. Those pink lips tightened as they grew wide, because Dean was smiling - smiling at him. The sight was breathtaking and so warm, Castiel lost himself in it for a moment, until Dean's happy voice reached him.
"Oh, but I believe Prince James won't tell a soul, will you, your Majesty? I bet his Highness is excellent at keeping secrets." Lord Samuel said with an odd glint in his eyes, one that Castiel had no time to decipher.
It took Castiel exactly five seconds to regret his outburst and his decision as he heard the footsteps follow him. This was a stranger he so easily invited into his home, a man he knew nothing about except that he ate at a national kitchen and was most likely homeless. He spotted a rucksack over the man's back when he walked past him, probably containing all his belongings. But all of this spoke nothing about the man's character.
Maybe this wouldn't be just for himself. Maybe this would be for Castiel too. To help him step away from that edge of not knowing how to act around Dean. The more Dean thought about it, the more he remembered moments where Castiel wanted to touch him or lean in and kiss him, but seemed to change his mind at the last second and pull away. It must have been a torment for him. Dean has to put a stop to it. But how?
"You be fucking brilliant tonight kid... Sammy depends on it." He repeated it again, making sure Dean knew exactly what was at stake. If he does good tonight, the guy will want his company tommorow too and will pay for it. More money for Dean meant more money for Sam and all Dean could do is nod with determination.
"Um... I, um..." Dean suddenly felt overwhelmed. What if he order too much and it showed on Mr. Novak's bill, and he gets angry at Dean? The man on the other side seemed to pick up on Dean's reluctance and decided to help him out.
When he started this, it was fun. Then came a tough decision to allow men to 'rent' him for a night. But now, even that is wearing thin, his most common sponsor slowly running out of money and soon, Dean will have no way of earning more money.
"I just want you." As soon as he said it, Cas blushed so deeply and averted his eyes, that the sight made Dean go all gooey inside. He smiled as wide as he could, unable to reel it in, and reached to set his hand over Cas' from across the table.
Dean went to his room and changed into a seemingly plain jeans, plain black T-shirt, but then he added a flannel shirt and a leather jacket, topping it with boots. He went on the stage and by the time his favorite lyrics kicked in, he had already removed the jacket, the flannel shirt and seemingly ripped his jeans off, even thought everyone knew they were made to be removed in such a manner.
The reactions to his words were highly telling. The Cardinal had a smug smile, as if he was pleased by his answer. Lady Rubette nodded in agreement, while Lady Megan simply shrugged, indifferent, and the Baron probably hadn't even registered Castiel said a word. Lady Charlotte's eyes were wide, as if she was caught by surprise, but she quickly averted her gaze, trying to compose herself. Lord Samuel huffed.
doors, and wonder what was behind them. What was so important that it had to be locked away? Or maybe it was just a maintenance room? But, no, it had to be something more. Someone. Because Gabriel remembered scenting someone.
But he knew he wouldn't be able to stop thinking about the dancer, so he called Benny and his trusted driver arranged a night with him and Castiel was so thrilled and excited up to the point that Dean tensed. And it hit him like a cold shower.
"I... You needed rest..." Castiel tried, inhaling Dean's scent deep, then shaking his head, trying to dispel it.
The strange feeling wouldn't go away not even on Dean's way back to the club, it was this slimy, itchy feeling, like something was crawling over your skin and you just can pinpoint it. And then he paused, just around the corner from the club, thinking he might have finally figured out what the feeling was.
That was strange. It didn't tell him to get over it like it didn't matter that it happened like Dean would expect it to. Huh.
Dean choked on Cas' breath, instantly pulling away and looking down at him completely surprised. "Are you… Are you su…"
The woman behind the counter at the bank eyed him while glancing at his ID, frowning and probably considering if she should give him the cash or call her supervisor. Thankfully, another clerk at the bank greeted Castiel as he passed by, so the woman felt confident enough to let him make the withdrawal.
Castiel was having so much fun. After all the hardship of the last couple of weeks, to be able to sit and do his thing, do what he does best felt really good. Felt like he was himself again. He didn't notice time flying by, nor his aching muscles, he didn't care. He was doing something he liked and something that mattered and it made him feel fulfilled.
He definitely wouldn't have looked like a mad man running into the building and shouting that he needed to see Mr. Novak. It was only a week ago that a guy by the name of Gadreel Penikett ran into the bank across the street with a bomb strapped to his chest, demanding all the cash, and to the security guards... This reminded them of said event, and even though they could really see a bomb on Dean's chest, they still saw him as an immediate threat. When Dean saw they were crowding him, cutting off both his exit and his way to the elevators, he snapped, ran a guard down and ran towards the stairs.
It was spectacular and completely breathtaking watching Castiel arch back again, screaming Dean's name and shooting one rope after another of his hot cum all over Dean's chest. Dean felt him clamping down, his already tight hole constricting even more around Dean's cock, and he lost it, lost all focus and all of his mind and followed Castiel over the proverbial edge, spilling all he had inside of him and fucking feeling as Castiel's body milked even more.
Throughout the chorus, Dean's hands were all over his upper body, caressing and touching, going up his arms and down as if he was hugging himself, then running down from his chest to his crotch and back up, teasing. His eyes were closed and he bit on his lower lip, and kept his expression as such.
Worst off, Castiel felt like he was intruding on a moment here, and he couldn't help the hurt and disappointment that suddenly filled his heart.
A knock on the door made him flinch and he saw the soft eyes of Crowley peeking inside on him. Now, that was wrong, so very wrong. Seeing concern in those vomit brown eyes that would usually sputter annoyed and teasing profanities was just... Wrong. But then he smiled and it became even more wrong, seeing that grin on his face with a hint of insecurity.
“Jesus!” Dean shouted, his hips jerking and he pulled back a little bit, putting some distance between them. He looked down at Castiel with hungry eyes that bare only a hint of insecurity, biting down on his lower lip. “Fuck, this is…” His breathing was still hard, his chest heaved, but his eyes searched CAstiels’ for something unknown to the angel. But then he blinked, and something changed. “No!” Dean shouted, but his actions didn’t attest to him stopping. Instead he surged forth, pressing his mouth to Castiel’s and plunging his tongue in, kissing him from the inch of his life. The angel moaned into the kiss, as Dean’s hands went back to his body, driving him crazy. Yet he kept his hips high, their cocks only slightly brushing, and Castiel reached and cupped the hunters ass, trying to press him down.
"D... Dean... ooh..." Castiel's shaky voice brought him back and he glanced down upon the throbbing cock that he was making slide in and out of the tunnel that his hand has made, feeling his heart rate increase along with his breathing. He upped the pace and watched with delight as Castiel started to squirm a bit under him, and he looked so... Beautiful.
Some additional plot weaseled it's way into this chapter and no matter what I tried, I just couldn't shake it off. That is the first part of the chapter.
you know, the king…" Gabriel stage-whispered, and Castiel had to be honest, the man had a knack for story-telling.
Dean contemplated what Cas might have meant all the way to his work building, not noticing the silence in the car until he pulled into the parking lot.
"Ddd... Dean? What are..." Castiel asked carefully, not really wishing to stop him, just maybe to make sure Dean... Knew what he was doing? Yeah, like that made sense.
"You're right... Maybe... Maybe I didn't understand that I could... Maybe I ... I don't know. Azazel never told me how to... Just told me to behave and to do what was asked... But... I... Last night... I wanted that. I wanted you to touch me and to..." Dean screwed his eyes shut, biting down on his lower lip, and that's when Castiel noticed the redness of his cheeks and his ears and the embarrassment in Dean's eyes when he opened them to look back at Castiel who just stared at him, shocked and confused beyond belief.
