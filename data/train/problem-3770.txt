“Well, you two didn’t come here to talk to me all night. Dean, it was a pleasure to meet you. I hope you’ll introduce me to your parents when they get here. Already told your brother I want to meet that girl of his. Enjoy your skate, boys.”
“Are you sassing your mother and I, boy? After we flew three hours to see you and spend time with you at Christmas?”
Located in Lebanon, Kansas, the Men of Letters bunker was inherited by the boys after they learned their paternal grandfather, Henry, had been a member. The order was a secret society that thought themselves better than hunters (think of the one percent versus blue collar) and who were steeped in knowledge of the supernatural, as well as the arcane arts, such as alchemy. The bunker itself housed a treasure trove of objects and research material, all of which had come in handy to the Winchester brothers over the years.
The rest of the drive took longer than planned. A hand job by Castiel nearly had the Impala off the highway twice. After Dean gave him a suitable-for-now punishment to the angel’s delight in the nearest no-tell motel, they were on their way and home by dinner.
The snort that ripped out of Dean bounced around the empty kitchen. Seriously, the acoustics were impressive. “Fuck that. Sammy can deal with him. We’re having dinner at Mayor Mills’ house tomorrow night. I’ll see him then. He’ll be cranky, but it’s fine.”
“So long as you know you’re up first.” Cas didn’t wait for his lover’s reply as he knew there wouldn’t be one.
“I think even Jody is thinking of scaling back next year,” Ellen told him. “On the bright side, business is booming.”
Dean stirred, slurring the words but injecting them with meaning nonetheless. He pressed a kiss into the hollow of Castiel’s throat.
Which is why Dean was facing his sexuality crisis in the middle of the night on a long stretch of county road in the middle of God knows where after possibly losing the love of his life to a demon or, worse, another angel. Castiel was basically the only angel Dean could stomach as the rest of them had proven to be total douchebags.
He had winked and turned his attention back to the movie. “Put yourself first for once, Dad. It’s time.”
For a moment, Cas thought Dean had fallen asleep. Until he felt Dean’s hand trail down his chest, over the cotton t-shirt he slept in, and slip under the dual waistbands of his pajama bottoms and boxers. Cas’ breath caught when Dean gripped his mildly interested cock and with a couple rough strokes had his cock’s full attention. The precum that pearled at the head was used as lube while Dean twisted the shaft and pulled with every stroke.
“Okay. I just wanted to say I’ve been thinking about what you said — what you both said — and I would like another chance at sorting this out. Can you come back to the room? I–I’d like to hear more about this cottage Jess mentioned you were looking at. Maybe we can talk about that and other things? Cas is welcome, too.”
Big mistake. All of Dean’s blood shot straight to his cock making it painfully hard. His balls pulled up, too, forcing him to take deep breaths and slowly release them to take the edge off. It mostly worked, but the only true relief was to come. He desperately wanted it to be with Castiel. So much that it literally hurt.
Dean considered this as he saw the vulnerability in Cas. What had he gone through to doubt how damn beautiful he was? He wanted to know everything about his friend and was willing to return the favor. He hadn’t been willing to open himself up to anyone since his ex-girlfriend Lisa. Despite the unintended devastation she had left behind, Dean was finally ready to risk his heart.
A ghost of a smile appeared on his father’s lips. “Fair enough. Dean, I’ve never given a damn that you’re queer. You’re my son. I want you to be happy. But this isn’t the way to find it.”
Now, the Harvelle women joined the town and its visitors, some of whom had traveled hundreds of miles, to witness this magical night.
As he sat in the passenger seat of the car, Dean’s cheeks were flushed and his heart trilled like someone was playing a drumroll on it. It had been so long since he had a crush on anyone, let alone being in such a confined space with that person. When they had walked around town this afternoon and put the decorations on the festival tree, they were outside. When they had talked last night, just the two of them, in different areas of the lodge, there was plenty of space to move and breathe.
Once the foursome of Dean, Cas, Sam, and Jessica were inside John and Mary’s suite, it had been apparent from the off that this would be an actual conversation instead of another showdown. John had greeted them warmly though his stoic demeanor was visible. Dean had seen he was open to getting to know Cas and his intentions. For all his bluster and pride, John loved his sons dearly. The last thing he wanted was for them to get hurt and in his mind, it wouldn’t be a stretch to believe that someone would target them for their money.
Castiel smiled. Dean was slow to wake unless there was an emergency, whereas Sam tended to be a rise-and-shine guy. As for the angel, sleep was not required though he enjoyed resting when the opportunity arose. He rested well last night with the man he loved in his arms.
“They don’t bite, I promise.” Jody had joined them. “Well, anyway, Claire’s had her shots. She likes to play with her food.”
This also was explained to Cas, who wore a Mona Lisa smile as he listened. Instinctively, Dean suspected the other man understood because he had been in a similar situation himself. It turned out, he was right as Cas told him he had been devastated when Kelly died. Not only due to his losing her, but because he felt there was so much he could have said and done; though when pressed by her parents and Jody and Donna to come up with an example, he couldn't.
A sarcastic, mock chortle came from the man himself while the others laughed jovially, enjoying the fact someone had taken Dean to task. It was all in good humor and Dean accepted it in kind.
Just as Cas was about to press a kiss into his boyfriend’s temple, Dean turned and kissed him properly.
God, he missed Jack’s mom more than ever. Kelly Kline had been his best friend and biggest champion. She brought him to Snow Falls after she moved back eighteen years ago following the end of a bad relationship. Pregnant and terrified her ex-boyfriend would follow her here, Cas came for what was supposed to be a short visit. Her parents and the town had rallied round her in such a way it had touched his heart. She had worked at the lodge while pregnant, telling her father it was time she learned the family business. Sadly, that had proved prophetic. Two years after Jack’s birth, her father died of a heart attack and eighteen months later, breast cancer took her mother.
The cheek in his words and that lopsided grin made Cas’ heart tighten. Not good. Or maybe it was? Do friends react to other friends like that? He honestly didn’t know, but he didn’t overthink it either.
He was greeted by a roll of the eyes. Castiel then captured his mouth, deepening the kiss almost immediately. When he broke it, he saw his man’s pupils were blown. He suspected his own were the same.
“Yeah, I know what movie it is, Sam. Why the hell are you watching it when you know I’m coming to get you for our night out?”
“I’m a dick who is willing to get his brat some tissues.” He got up, returning with the box in hand. Cas shook his head, so Dean dropped it on the coffee table.
“That’s what nightstands are for, man,” Dean teased from his current position, which had him resting on his forearms with his ass in the air.
Everyone took a seat. Dean, Sam, and Jessica on the sofa with John and Mary in the overstuffed chairs opposite. The silence that settled over the group was awkward and uncomfortable.
date? What was your first?” Bobby was doing his best to catch up. “I thought this Cas guy had been pissed at you since the incident.”
Even Jack had noticed the spark between Cas and Dean that night in Minneapolis. He had gotten so excited at seeing how his dad reacted to this other man that he wouldn’t stop talking about it even after they had come home. Somehow, Jody had remained clueless about the identity of the mystery man Cas had flirted with that night until after closing the deal with the Winchesters. Her reaction when she had learned the truth had been priceless. Donna, Jody’s wife, beamed at Cas and told him he had better make a move on Dean while he was in town.
“Dean can go wherever he wants so long as he is back in time for lunch where he will introduce us to his lovely boyfriend.” Mary protected her son as she always had.
“Castiel, I pray to you, please tell me where you are or at least let me know you’re okay? You’re scaring the shit out of me and I hate it! I need you, man.
Jack shook his head, a lopsided grin on his lips. “No way. I’ve lived here my whole life and never knew how cool this place is. My friends and I snuck in a few times, but it was boring. Not like now.”
Cas nodded in understanding. “Sorry if I freaked you out with my forthrightness when I gave you the key card. I was just trying to be friendly and may have overplayed my hand.”
Dean was still buzzing from that afternoon, not all of which had to do with the concert. Having Cas there watching from the sidelines supporting him and having a great time managed to energize and calm Dean simultaneously. He had the same sensations the other night in the town square. After Sam and Jack left them backstage, he and Cas made out a little as there wasn’t time for much else and Dean gave him the rest of the tour. Then, they made out a little more.
„I'm not going to fuck this up“ he says to himself and starts stroking Cas with one hand, gaze locked, the other hand next to Cas face to firm himself. His eyes. Trapped.
They were skin on skin, naked, only millimeters between them. Sometimes they froze, gazing at each other with a silent question in their look, that seems to say „Could I dare to … .“
. He was expecting to meet Cas, who wouldn't sleep. Who doesn't need to sleep. Who was somewhere around here.
„And this is why you grill babys battery?“ Deans fake everything-is-alright-attitude fades and he seems agitated.
He wants to pleasure Cas. He wants to make up for how he treated him. How natural all his sacrifices, actions and even presence was to him.
While Dean was driving and searching for a diner, both of them were strangely smirking and didn't exactly know what to say. Deans heart was racing and he glanced over to Cas every 5 minutes, who too still was smiling. „Like teenagers“ he thought and grinned even more. It finally started to taste like a happy-end.
„First he was okay-ish. He could be more happy about how we defeated Chuck. That's what I thought at that time. But I wasn't worried for the first couple of weeks. But then... you know maybe he should tell you himself. Let's just say – that was just the tip of the iceberg. And then I made an attempt to guess what's wrong. That he is mourning you, because he's in love and turns out that's it. We decided to find out how to summon the Empty and the rest is history.“
This chapter is my favourite. I really would like to read your thoughts on it in the comment section. Comments do help me to get better and understand what's working for you and what not. And of course I'm happy about every kudos. ;)
Dean looks surprised at Cas, who too blushes. „I … I had to leave, because I thought the Shadow could come and get me again and you too. I feared the deal could still be active somehow.“
It's obvious to them both that Dean can neither stand Sams sight, nor the uncomfortable truth of his hamster-wheel-free life failing. The annoyed look on Deans face is a long perfected masquerade, that's starting to crumble. Dean clears his dry, burning throat and feels closer to a boiling point.
Though Sam felt like the small brother again and it had a notion he tried to avoid, he couldn't really say no. Dean made him promise, that he would pay back as soon as he is a famous lawyer or something like that.
There is no denying, he has to wipe the slate clean. He could procrastinate and have a good time with Dean. Or he could get things sorted out right away. To get closure and not fall back into the feeling to being on the run. And he decides for the latter, knowing Dean will be disappointed.
„Ah, hi.“ he smiles. Eileen can't shake the thought that his smiles have been bigger before. But at least he can smile again. What is worse? Losing him at all or losing his happiness? What is worse for Sam?
They walk out of the movie theatre and everything just feels so casually and normal. A normal couple that is even recognized as one. Cas walks in front of him to the impala while Dean observes his movements. He thinks about last night. How much he underestimated him. His strength. His arms around him, his grip on his skin. Surprisingly less changed now that he shares kisses and bed with a men. Why was he so hesitant before? Cas, the impala, a date night.
Nobody asks why Dean and Cas disappeared, no big fuss, some glances, everything much more natural and relaxed than he expected much to Cas relief. Donna and Jody would later come over to get Jodys car and say goodbye, Bobby will leave then, too. Cas decides to wait for them to leave and then talk to Dean.
There was no identification of Jimmy Novak left, but Cas had a strict rule not to use his powers to persuade or manipulate someone, which worked well so far. As Dean looks at Cas' concerned face, he decides to do something against the identity problem later and for now they try to explain that away. Cas' interesting questions aren't exactly helping in appearing unremarkably normal and will definetely stick with the estate agent.
„No.“ Dean calms down and tries to send a small signal of reconciliation. Gently he entwines his fingers with Cas hand on his stomach. „No, that's not leaving.“ And he finds his smile again, exhaling relieved. „You know, you sound very sexy, when you are talking like that.“
As you probably guessed by now, the chapter titles are songs titles. More than that they're songs I loved to listen to while writing or that come to mind when thinking about destiel. If you like I'd post the list with the last chapter. Or do you probably already guessed some of the exact song/artist matches? Let me know.
Dean draws him closer and puts some kisses at the delicate place under Cas' ear, at his throat and rests his head against Cas.
„Look …“ Dean goes on, „if you are not hurt, unwell, feel like I'm taking advantage of you … if you liked it, just enjoy it. I do. It's okay. It took us a while to get here. Who judges us?“ Dean leans over him, face over face. „I'd like to believe we deserved that.“
“Wait, do you guys own this place?” Sam couldn’t believe their luck. One glance at his brother showed Dean felt the same way. He grinned, knowing he would get the truth out of Dean later. His brother’s reaction to seeing Jack and Cas was too good to ignore. While he was a little hurt that Dean hadn’t confided in him fully regarding Cas, he understood. He had been there himself when it came to crushes.
It was true. Dean took solace in that fact. He wanted to take solace in this man. Sure, okay, he was doing that now, but he wanted to do so in the biblical sense. As he quieted his mind and focused on the angel at his side, Dean could feel that same want coming from Castiel, too. He knew he was half-hard and wondered if his lover was, as well. The black trousers Castiel wore did a nice job hiding any hard-ons.
Ellen Harvelle was the mother of Scrapyard Dogs’ guitarist Jo Harvelle, who had been born and raised in the town. It was Ellen who had gone to Jody in support after hearing Cas had suggested the band takeover Winter Festival duties when the mayor’s original choice had bailed. She was damn proud of her daughter and would tout her success whenever she could. Jo had never wanted to drag the boys to her hometown, thinking they would believe she was taking advantage of their friendship. Her mother couldn’t argue with her logic and never pushed.
next since Dean and Cas had never watched it. Turned out, Sam had caught the movie on a streaming service the year before and loved it. When the cast performed the first song, Dean turned to his brother.
“Oh, I don’t know. Maybe a partner to share your life with, for starters? And I’m not talking about a bed warmer, but someone significant.”
“Exactly. It’s not a no.” Cas kissed him once more. “Break a leg, love. You’re going to be amazing as always.”
Castiel grinned, tossing the underwear to him. “Deal. I want to see how gorgeous my human looks wearing them.”
Dean understood all of this, but what he couldn’t wrap his head around was how his father had allowed this jaded mindset to stop seeing the good in people. Yeah, a lot of people were dicks, but not all. Cas and Jessica were prime examples, as was Jack, Jody, and Donna. He was tired of being around it. In all honesty, until Cas, Dean had been worried that attitude might have infected him, too. Sam had dismissed it as soon as Dean had admitted the possibility while they waited for the horses to walk up to take them and Cas and Jess on their sleigh rides.
“What happened?” He crossed the lobby to meet them in the common area so they would have some privacy. Cas wasn’t sure he wanted to hear the unpleasant details, but knew there was no way he would rest until the truth was shared.
The set list featured, among other tunes, “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” with Dean on drums trying his best to channel Dave Grohl, one of his idols; “Run Rudolph Run” where Sam and Jo got to show off their electric guitar skills; “Sleigh Ride” had Dean throwing Cas a wink as he remembered it was one of his favorites; “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,” which gave Jo the floor and she was able to show off her vocal stylings to the crowd’s delight.
They had been together two-and-a-half years. Despite seeing the signs and knowing this wasn’t any way to maintain a healthy relationship, Dean was devastated by the split. He never let it affect the band. Sam and Bobby had talked him into taking a six-month break, which had done wonders for his soul. His heart would heal in due course, they had told him. And it did.
An appreciative smile was aimed at Cas. “Reading, though I never have as much time to indulge in it as I would like. Guess everyone feels that way. Um, hunting, actually. I find it centers me. In the off-season, I build guitars to auction off. The money goes to a charity we support for LGBTQ+ kids.”
The next instant, they both closed the gap between them as they slid across the black leather of the bench seat. Their mouths met in glorious fashion as though they were two magnets drawn to each other. Castiel’s lips parted and Dean slid his tongue into the opening like they had been doing this forever. If only. A hunger had been awakened in them both. Moans filled the Impala. Starvation was not healthy.
Eyebrow raised, Dean knew this gesture meant Cas was horny. He tended to become rather tactile when he wanted sex. Cas had to spell it out for him the first couple times he got this way, but Dean was a quick study and learned the telltale signs. In truth, he was always horny for Cas, but when his lover got this way, it meant Cas was in an experimental mood.
The other man chortled. “Usually just the lobby or maybe the common area if we’re being specific, but I think I’ll start referring to it as a lounge. Classes it up a bit.” Cas grinned as he watched Dean for a few seconds. “I have to go over a few things in the morning, so let’s say one o’clock?”
Fifteen minutes later, Dean and Sam walked into the front entrance of the White Spruce Mountain Lodge. A two-story building that stretched out to cover three acres, it held twenty-four rooms, two suites on each floor; a main area; a formal dining room; and state-of-the-art kitchen. There were also four private cabins with their own private balconies. The foyer gave off a homey feel despite the hotel trappings.
Dean’s nerves faded as he took in the astonishment on his boyfriend’s face. He had never written a song for anyone till Cas and he wouldn’t want it any other way.
Despite his own nakedness, Castiel was taken by how stunning his lover was in only a pair of jeans. Dean Winchester was to him what Michelangelo’s David was to the rest of the world: perfection. His heart raced as he crawled across the backseat to nibble on Dean’s ear. Castiel moaned along with him when Dean reached back to pull on the angel’s hair, twisting himself so their mouths met.
A shrug was Dean’s response. He was silent for a moment. “Well, we all can’t be lucky enough to find the love of our life when we’re eighteen.”
Suddenly, Dean was tired of driving. He wanted nothing more than to find a place to park for the night and have a long talk with his friend about why it took so damn long to come back to him, among other things.
“Ma’am? I like that.” She shook his hand. “So polite. But you can drop the ‘Miss.’ Folks round here are respectful, but not
“Damn, you feel so good.” He fit perfectly, like he was made for Dean and vice versa. “Once is not going to be enough.”
He had spoken with his chef a few days ago and they had agreed a small, late-night buffet would be palatable for their guests, most of whom would return hungry and unfed after discovering there was nowhere in town to get a meal. Sandwiches, hors d'oeuvres, cookies, cakes, and pies were decided upon; nothing too heavy or rich. There were bottles of water and pints of milk available in metal ice buckets, as well as a coffee urn and a hot water dispenser along with tea bags and packages of hot chocolate.
“And then she insisted on keeping those damn color lights for the next two years to make a point because she was too stubborn to admit she was wrong!” John crowed.
“Locked and loaded,” Sam assured him. “Mayor Mills has us down for a thirty-minute set, but we padded it with enough for songs for forty-five minutes, just in case.”
Dean shook his head. “Father figure, my ass. It’s because you're his dad. You are family regardless of the science. You, Kelly, and Jack must have been one hell of a unit. I’d like to hear more about her, if you don’t mind sharing her.”
His body fit to burst, Dean pulled his angel off him and connected their mouths in a sloppy yet passionate style. Castiel wasn’t the only one drunk on his lover. That light, clean yet earthy scent had insinuated itself into Dean’s senses ensuring he would never forget what his angel smelled like. He was obsessed with it and relieved to know he could breathe in Castiel whenever he wanted. The weight that had been sitting on his heart for so long had been finally cast off. Dean couldn’t remember the last time he felt this connected to anyone. Had he ever? Lisa had been the closest. This was different and so right.
“I feel blessed, too. I wish you meant what you said about not going anywhere,” Cas said wistfully as he drew lazy shapes over Dean’s abs.
The truth of that last statement made Dean’s heart tighten. Continuing this fight without Castiel by his side was not something he wanted to happen. However, Sam was still here and would be until the end. Still, as much as he loved his baby brother, he wasn’t the angel with the adoring glance that warmed Dean from the inside out.
Dean sleeps, Cas rests. They get up. They look at each other, kiss, sleep with each other, repeat. It's like they fell in a loophole, intoxicated and hidden from the world. As they fuck and fuck again, Dean sometimes goes back to reality in between, checks the time and asks himself if Sam is already back. Wouldn't that be awkward - he for sure would hear them in the corridor. What day is it even? Doesn't matter.
„Nah, I know how to annoy this cosmic bore. I'm pretty sure it's as easy as getting shushed in the library.“
They shower together. Under the water, touching each other and kissing inbetween. Seemingly they haven't finished last night what they started. Dean presses Cas against the wall, as Cas gently runs his fingertips over Deans shoulder.
„First you were hyped. We defeated god, the new is in his heaven and all's right with the world. Go team free will, victory. But now it hits you.“
Their eyes locked, he is shitty with talking about his feelings, but since they let go of doubts and nervousness, it just doesn't stop coming out. „And I still believe I don't deserve that.“
„I want to do this because it troubles me. I want tabula rasa. I want to … come to terms too. There are just to many things that … are how they are because it's history. And I don't understand that. Shouldn't we learn from history and do better?“ The shadow turns around and listens to the empty nothingness, that's just empty for others. To all the mumbling around him.
„Because the others are going to wake up soon I believe. And I think about everything else until tonight.“ Dean grins.
Tomorrow Sam would say something like „At least you bothered to drink from a glass this time. A bit more classy instead of drinking directly from the bottle.“
„I want to rest. Just … close it up. Take them away.“ And it makes a gesture as if it could brush it all away with its hands.
Dean would have never imagined it like this, this hot. Cas was more daring than he thought, even if he looks nervous in between kisses.
„I hope it hasn't to do anything with wing fetishes“ says Dean smirking, Sam on the other hand „I bet he is consulting somehow … maybe people who have trouble to accomodate to the digital age or something!?“
Thinking of the shadow, thinking of Sams questions, thinking of his hunter family around the bonfire, the thought comes to him surprisingly easy. It's about becoming happy. Or keeping that happiness.
„Wake him up!“ he yells at the Shadow, that doesn't react and just playfully walks around them in circles.
For a second he thinks his eyes are still closed until he looks down at him and sees his boots and his hands waving through the air. Not his eyes are closed, there is just really only sheer blackness around him. Even if he himself seems to be lit. In whatever direction he turns, he sees
And helooked over to Cas, who could feel that something shifted. That he wasn't just high with endorphins. And he tells him. What he wanted from life. And ask him what he wanted. And Cas would say that this sounds perfect to him. That for him all he needed was Dean. And maybe a bit of „meaning“. No apocalypse-fighting duties. Just doing good. And this is all he needs.
„You think?“ Sam seems worried and doubted that this is a good idea. To see Dean happy again or at least able to move on is maybe desirable, sending him on a suicide mission is not. Eileen saw his face and her euphoria of finding a possible hint shifted to regret.
„No. From what I heard … things are working very well. There is no rush.“ And he notices Deans face brighten and goes on „Thanks to you and Sam. You saved the world. I knew you would.“
Ah, I guess we could have more adorably strange date-like situations with them on the show. Or we have fanfiction. That's ok too. What would you like to see (or read?) them doing at a date?
He responds everything is fine and is suddenly bit nervous. Afterwards he finally phones the ID guy and knows exactly what to tell him.
„I know it, okay!? I know I've done wrong. I KNOW IT!“ he yells. „HOW CAN YOU JUDGE? HOW CAN YOU JUDGE IF YOU NEVER HAD TO DEAL WITH ...“ Deal with what? He thinks to himself. An apocalypse or two are a valid excuse, or not? Or not. He could have lived. He could have make Cas live. He could have done better.
Both fall against each other and grip one another tight. It's like time stops, the only sound in the room are their fast breaths and moans.
„Nooo!“ Cas exclaims and laughs as Dean finished his flood of words. For Cas it's nice to see Dean insecure for a change.
As Dean looks down at Cas, he states disappointed „You should have done something for you too. Let me ...“
„Utter silence – that's it. From Cas description this is the Empty. It was annoyed as hell from sound, even of Cas presence. The token is, dunno, maybe manageable. I still have some of his, well, blood. And if they really thought that their grief or whatever could be consumed by this nothingness … well grief is available.“
And he wants to hear his sounds, wants to see his face in arousel. Then looks to Cas again, rushed, worried, „If you don't like it, I'll stop.“
Cas gestures something in ASL, neither Sam or Dean can understand, but he shakes his head constantly and Eileen giggles. „Yes, you do. Tell him!“
As if somebody lights a candle, warmth radiates in Cas' chest. That's how he feels hearing that Dean has plans for the two of them nearly a year in advance. Talking about forever is nice, but feeling years, having plans, is different.
They part, just a bit and their noses touch accidentally. Dean runs his fingers through Cas hair, his hand stops at his neck, a long glance and after it they share a kiss. First nice, sweet, slow, then they go faster. Something in the two of them breaks free, they start touching each others backs, their necks, their loins and start dragging at their clothes. Dean starts undressing first.
They awkwardly pat each others back, Dean told him to drive safely and as their stoplights disappear out of the bunkers garage door, Dean swallows and looks helplessly to Cas.
Deans expression shifts from angry to desperate and tears are welling up his eyes. His pulse is pumping and he feels a headache rising, his cheeks feel displeasingly warm.
Cas hesitates and whispers even closer to his ear „Next time I'd like to be the one to … you know.“ Dean falters and looks a bit impressed as well as overwhelmed. He smacks his lips and thinks to himself he won't give him that so easily.
Sam sits in the library, checking their hunters discord servers for any signs, sightings and possible cases as Dean enters the library. From Deans tense look and grinding jaw Sam immediately gets the hint .
Cas appears on the ground as if something suddenly spat him out, Dean runs to him, slides on the ground, cries „Cas“ and kneels next to him, eyes wide open in stress and anticipation. Cas eyes are closed, he looks
„I just wanted to ask you … .“ And he looks away again like he is searching for help and restlessly exhales.
Hope you like it so far. Feel free to leave some comments about what you expected, what not and what you liked. And if I wrote some garbage, misused figures of speech, please let me know ^^' Somehow I have a hard time formatting and have the impression that its' probably hard to read this way. Let me know what you think about that.  I'm more used to working with tabs as indentation in paragraphs.
„The hooouusehold, there it is again.“ said Dean, grinning. But he notices the look on Cas face and gets the vibes right. „You know what … I really would like to be taken out for an expensive dinner, darling.“ and winked at Cas.
„Today is alreay tomorrow. Yesterday we were hiking. It's about noon.“ he says and carresses Deans back. His fingertips go up and down from Deans neck to his loins.
„When you're close. Close to … you know. And when you don't like something. And I can smell if you are getting aroused.“
„Well considering official regulations I am resigned and officially dead. But I'm also not dead in the sense of humans being dead.“
He stands up, puts the bag over his shoulder and fumbles a copy of the prayer out of his pocket and reads it. As the first lines of it crosses his lips, he hears his own heartbeat. Maybe today. Maybe it'll work.
„Yes.“ he says self-assured. „So tell me where he is or bring him here or whatever. Or simply send us back.“ He adds „Please.“
Cas is too puzzled to respond anything. „Here you got PB&J, I don't know what else you like. Or liked. What do you like?“ he asks.
As the blackness fades and they are capable to open their eyes, it's already too late to prevent their fall - they hit the ground, hard. Cas gets up slowly, asking „Are you ok?“ While Dean just turns around and grunts in pain „Yeah I'm ok“.
Cas closes his eyes, breathing faster, enjoying what's happening and Dean notices it. He did it usually with woman, would it be strange to do it now? Dean kisses and nibbles one of Cas nipples, as he suddenly pulls away.
I hope you all enjoyed my Hallmark with smut Christmas AU! Thank you so much for reading and commenting!
scared him. It didn’t solely mean the good; the bad was in there, as well. He swallowed the dread that crawled up his throat.
“Yeah, I’ve been praying, too,” Dean admitted. “He’ll be in touch. Probably just taking a time out to recharge or something. The assclown he chased might have taken a bit of juice to put down, you know?”
Cas didn’t come through the office door behind the front desk much to Dean’s relief. Instead, he came down the stairs just as Dean had reached Sam and Jack. He was just attractive as Dean remembered. When Cas’ face lit up upon seeing them, Dean’s heart swelled and he felt a little light-headed.
No one less than the esteemed mayor of Snow Falls herself brought Sam and Dean to this small town nestled in the Black Hills. She had a weeklong festival that was held annually in the days leading up to Christmas. Every year, a music act was booked to play a few shows and participate in the town festivities. This year would be bigger than usual as the big day fell on a Friday, which meant Snow Falls would have two weekends bookending the festival. The event ran officially from December eighteenth through the twenty-fourth with bonus activities planned for December twenty-six through twenty-seven. Christmas was the one day during this period where the town was essentially quiet.
John led the way as Jessica, still holding onto Cas' arm, pulled him to the right toward the backstage entrance while Mary put an arm over Jack’s shoulders to guide him in the same direction. Bobby was waiting for them, taking over as captain of this expedition.
His phone rang that night after Jack had gone to bed. Jody refused to take no for an answer as she had sent Cas a few texts after he had left her at the front desk earlier. Her persistence made him smile. Even if he didn’t want to talk about Dean Winchester and his own confused feelings, he suspected it would be healthier if he didn’t keep everything bottled up.
Cas rolls back on his side, looking at Dean and nodding. They go on, talking about what Cas saw in heaven and his impressions. Lying there naked with his boyfriend, talking about weird shit, it appears somehow free and decadent as well. He eyes Cas, his hands, his body, bringing back to memory what they just did as Cas stops talking and looks at him.
Eileens gaze shifts between the two of them, silently praying „please whoever up there make it work, bring them back, just bring them back.“ On the outside she looks self-assured, because she needs to be for Sam, but inside she wants to scream.
That's when Dean finally is able to notice the nerves firing, the ants in his chest and stomach rising.
„Oh really? But you are the reason why he is here, aren't you?“ he cocks his head, his annoying voice rings in Deans ears.
He stands up and wanders around, expecting to see something or someone different, but happy to see baby and jumps right in.
Their eyes seem to be hungry as if they could swallow each other just by looking. Dean doesn't take his eyes of Cas while his flanel drops to the floor and he gets rid of his shirt. Cas just looks mesmerized at him as if this isn't really happening to him, to them. As if he wants to capture every second. The feeling of Deans hand in his neck, deans fingers dragging on his shirts buttons. His mind records every moment in slow-motion - how Dean drags his shirt over his head and then looks at him, loving and wanting green eyes.
As you maybe already noticed I happily ignore the fact that Deans room is probably not that huge. But one of the biggest troubles with this chapter was actually the question: Did Cas ever met Donna? I don't think so, but I was unsure. Couldn't find any information on that, so here we are ... . Donnas positives vibes meeting Cas - IMHO it would have been awesome!
Silence. Cas wanted to say something, stops, looks to Dean, looks to Sam, who says immediately „Me too. Very much.“ Cas and Dean say simultaneously „Thanks“. Cas quietly, Dean with much self-confidence. They look at each other, hoping that their aura as a new attraction to gossip in the bunker would fade now and Dean grins.
So Dean makes the first step, touches Cas loin tenderly. Their gaze still meets as if as part of a game - who turns away looses.
Cas touches his shoulder and Dean feels weaker than he likes. „Don't push me away. Not after last night. Not after just
It's nearly midnight and Dean sits in the kitchen again, clinging to a glass of water. Not just because of the deal he had with Sam about drinking, but because he wanted to have a clear head tomorrow. The plan was set. They would wait for the evening, when it's most silent around the bunker. There was a construction site nearby and lots of trucks were hitting the road near the bunker. Best chances for „utter silence“ will be in the evening or nighttime. Sure, the bunker was always relatively silent, but why challenge his luck or try and try again for nothing. He even stopped some of the clocks around and fixed the leaking faucet in the kitchen.
„Very observing, huh?“ Dean shakes his head. „We have no rules about having to explain our answers, but since you noticed on your own … . Lately I was drinking so much I was not myself anymore. Sometimes I was drunk for days without a clear moment in between. Because I was … desperate. Because you were gone. And Sammy was really angry.“ He inhales, looks down, feels a bit ashamed of how easy he fell for this pattern. During all these years, he met so many people, saw so many things. Defeated – that's how he felt about Sammys little intervention and it all comes back to him right now. It wasn't his intention to feel bad, when he started this game. When he get up from the bonfire and after Cas. He fears to appear weak in Cas eyes now. But as soon as he dares to meet Cas eyes, he just sees his worrying, frowning, caring Cas. Cas, who just nods and says „I understand. Thank you for sharing. Are you better now?“
„I cannot pay, but it will be nice to have some younger and stronger hands once in a while in the workshop. And if you're so enthusiastic … maybe you want to learn?“
Someone is drawing the the other one in Deans bed, maybe they both do. Cas mind cannot keep up with everything that's happening with them, aware or unaware. Cas hears his heartbeat and feels lightheaded. They kiss fast, messy kisses. Dean starts to kiss and lick and suck him a little at his throat and under his ear. Starts to wander downwards, arrives at his nipple and gently runs one hand over Cas thigh and touches him between his legs, where to his surprise not much happens.
During their stay at the diner, they felt like the ghost of christmas past left and they were waiting for the next one to appear. It was eerie and haunting. Despite Cas being sure that everything is alright, Dean fell into hunter mode. Observing the people in the diner, his senses aware of everything and everyone, not in a mode to chit-chat. During their drive back home he said „So what? The Shadow wanted to be human after all?“
Dean was somehow proud of him and the look on Cas' face was a priceless display of modest, pride and happiness as the chair was pieced together and finally really looked like what it's destined to be. Dean was joking, that Cas could make themselves two of that sort, they would need them on their porch if they were as old as Vincent and made the old man laugh. It amazed him to see how fast Cas seemed to adapt to this new life. A domestic life. Work life. He seemed to be busy every day as long as Dean was working and always there, when he came home.
Cas fixed Dean with one of his pointed stares, brow furrowing as his blue eyes narrowed. He let it linger for a long moment before letting it soften. “Nothing against Sam and Jo, but you are the only one I ever want to hear sing this song aside from Ron Sexsmith.”
Mary laughed as they came to a stop in the wings a few feet from the stage, where Scrapyard Dogs were performing the Barenaked Ladies/Sarah McLachlan version of “God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen” with Sam and Jo singing the main vocals as Dean harmonized with Sam.
Torn between letting Cas sleep and waking him up so they could both be awake as the hour approached nine, Dean had opted for the latter, pulling back the covers till Cas’ somewhat hard cock appeared. He had sucked the head first, dipping his tongue into the slit. Both Cas, who had been half-awake at this point, and his cock had liked that, so Dean had started stroking the shaft while he continued to suck. His eyes had looked up to find his lover’s pupils blown as Cas had carded his fingers through Dean’s brown hair.
Cas pulled out his phone to check the time. “I think we all need to get some air after the stress of this afternoon. On top of that, it’s Christmas Eve. We offer sleigh rides starting at four and running through eight. It’s the last night. If I can convince Rufus to let us beat the crowd would you be interested? It’s only three-fifteen now. We’d be back in plenty of time.”
His fingers stopped moving as Cas took a few seconds to find his voice. When he did, the cautionary tone was hard to hide. “Like an extra week? Or something more permanent?”
Dean thought back to how Cas had pulled him close once the horse began trotting along the path so that he was pressed to Cas’ side as they were snuggled under the blanket. He had felt claimed by his wonderful angel, even more so when Cas left a kiss on his head. They had drank hot chocolate while looking out over the winter landscape as a thermos of the sweet drink had been provided.
His host relaxed at the clarification. “Yes. It seemed like a win-win. Help Jody and give Jack a chance to breathe the same air as one of his favorite bands. I just prayed you weren’t total douchebags.”
Kelly would be able to talk sense into him now. She would tell him that first impressions aren’t always representative of the person’s character. That Jody was right in that Dean hadn’t been expecting to see Cas again and that just maybe he had been thinking of Cas, too. With this in mind, he allowed himself the mental respite. He thought back to Minneapolis and those five minutes in the hallway of The Armory, where he had met Dean Winchester.
At this, Dean picked up his head, gazing quizzically at his lover. “Is that really the best you can do?”
“I love your rubbery emotional state almost as much as I love you. I’m just happy I could be there for you. I can’t wait to have you and Jack with me on tour. Even for just two weeks. It will be
The sun’s bright rays reflecting off the waters of the lake and cascading through the windows of the Impala pulled Castiel out of his slumber. He and Dean had fallen asleep upfront once they cleaned themselves and the driver’s side seat. Castiel had recovered the water bottle as well as his trench coat, which currently doubled as a blanket for them. Dean was fast asleep on the angel’s chest, his breathing even. While they slept, the trench coat had slipped down so it now only covered Dean’s ass. As Castiel observed his sleeping beauty, he could see Dean wasn’t cold so he didn’t bother to pull his coat back up.
Picking up on the frisson of lust between the two men, Sam announced he was taking Jack to the wings of the stage and that Cas could join them in a few. As they walked away, Jack showed that Sam wasn’t alone in his observation.
The Realtor had informed Dean of the lone rental and of the four houses available to buy, unable to go into a real sales pitch since her potential client didn’t have time. She did tell him that he could find all information on the firm’s website, giving Dean her card should he have any questions. When he looked up the properties while enjoying a few moments of downtime at the park, he couldn’t believe the house that was available to rent. It was the one he swooned over the other night on Primrose Path. The cottage with the red door that, judging from the exterior, would be perfect for him. He then remembered seeing a “for rent” sign on the front lawn.
His fingers wander through Cas' dark hair. He does all the good stuff. All that Dean did to him yesterday and more. As if it's forbidden he just takes glimpses at Cas in front of him and how he caresses, licks and sucks. The sounds of Cas mouth are driving him crazy, adding to the arousel. To hold it a bit longer he has to close his eyes, tilt his head back agains the cool, tiled wall or watches the ceiling.
Donna looks at him unbelievingly. „Angel radio?“ and starts asking questions about heaven and hell again, drawing him in a confusing discussion, again with utter awe in her face.
He looks around until his gaze catches the source and he freezes. Dean notices, „Everything alright?“
After another uncomfortable pause, Deans stands up hastily, grabs his laptop, ready to rush away and even strips the desk with his laptop as Sam says „It's Cas, isn't it?“
„Obviously you attract nerds.“ Cas says smiling. How could he always emanate such a calm? That or deeply frowning concern.
Cas gives him a look and says stuttering „May … , should I ... what was it, that I wanted to do?“ Dean cleared his throat, giving Eileen and Sam a priceless smirk, asking „You hungry? Maybe we make dinner. How's that sound?“ grips a too obviously embarrassed Cas by his shoulder and disappears with him in one of the corridors not even waiting for the answer. Sam and Eileen exchange glances as she states dryly „So they got their shit together.“
Dean listed all he would cook for Cas and himself and test what doesn't taste like molecules. Cas responded to the menu that it's a lot and he could help him. Dean, still somehow slowed down like he is hung-over, sends him instead on a journey „to take everything from the bunker he likes and make his room look like he actually lives in it.“
First he tried the front door, but there was no Cas and his heart stung. „If you really left … no you wouldn't.“ he mumbles and tries the exit through the garage. And relievedlye sees him - a familiar figure with a trenchcoat sitting at the exact same spot, where he was sitting some months ago deciding to try to get him back. There he was now - staring into space. Dean swallows and slowly gets closer. Cas just says „Hello Dean“, before he even turns.
He is nervous, aroused, thinks that he is asking for to much, but so eager to get what he wants so desperately now.
„Hey … look, I really want you to be happy. And like I already said, I'm happy for you. But I know Dean all my life and know he is not the easiest with feelings. I guess you noticed.“ He is typing something into his laptop, once in a while looks to Cas, who finally sighs and relaxes.
Dean pauses, looks around him and says more dryly than he intended to „Ah, I forgot. You'll probably survive me, hm?“
He remembers how disoriented and strange he felt, when he returned and dug himself out of the dirt – well, after Cas brought him back. He should given him space to breathe, to arrive beneath the living. And what did he do? He kissed him. Nice. He feels like a coward, even if the thought makes him blush. Just thinking of that moment fades all the voices around him out and brings back the warmth of Cas lips, his gaze at that moment, stunned blue eyes. Dean feels as if he's glowing like a middle school girl.
Dean feels himself breaking. Maybe if he wasn't so hung-over, he could keep the scheme intact and avoid being ashamed, found out, instructed about his failure. But he's finished. His knees are weak and shaking.
As they resume on the trail, Cas asks him about evening school and Dean shares his plans to catch up on school certificates. He never thought about this kind of future. Sitting on a beach with Sam and Cas in matching hawaiian shirts was more a wish. He shares the picture with Cas, who asks what a hawaiian shirt is and makes Dean snort.
„Huh. Problem solved.“ thinks Dean as Cas leans over and says „Why … .“ and stops in astonishment, eyes locked to the screen.
„Hunting or summoning the Empty. Something like that. Or summoning Cas back from the Empty if that's possible.“
„Look“ he says to Cas, „It's like I said in the garage. I just feared you would leave me. It's not that I don't trust you or think that they would reprogram you. I was just … unsure and overreacting.“
Cas looks down at his trenchcoat, wanted to say „But I feel comfortable in this“, but then gets second thoughts. „Maybe you're right.“
„Mh, I don't know him. Or her. Or whatever. What do you think this 'pattern' is about? Do you sense danger?“
Sam clears his throat. „So I guess you only have one option. Mourn and mourn very good. Maybe without harming yourself from now on. What would help you? How can I help you?“ He lowers his head to catch Deans gaze.
Dean applied for a job as a security professional and made it. First he was working in building security and had mostly night shifts. Nevertheless he felt better off and had the feeling to do something thrilling – at least sometimes. It remembered him of plotting plans against invisible threats. Of hunting. Dark corridors, paying attention, observing and waiting. "No event" meant a shift, but maybe a boring workday. Similar to his hunting days. After some incidents he seemingly handled well he moved to personal security. The strange shifts are something he never missed. And after some months he was even promoted and was responsible for a small team. He may wasn't anymore one half of the "legendary Winchester brothers", but supervising and strategic decisions partly gave him his old self back and he found some peace with worklife even if stories about killing Hitler were still a good story on parties with old hunting buddies, sometimes more an insider joke.
“Yeah. Should be good. Kinda looking forward to performing unplugged,” Sam admitted. “We really don’t do it enough.”
“You feel amazing. I forgot how good bottoming can be.” Dean took Cas’ bottom lip between his teeth, sucking on it. “No, it’s not. Hope you don’t have plans because I’m not going anywhere.”
“Because I wanted you to make your own decisions without thinking I was pressuring you in any way.” Cas sighed. “I saw the look on your face that night we drove by it. Love at first sight. Just like it was for me. When you said you were thinking about moving here, I knew it was the only rental on the market, but I couldn’t bring myself to say anything out of fear you would think I was trapping you.”
“Thanks,” he replied dryly, opting to take a sip of his coffee before he said something he might regret.
The sentiment hit him like a freight train slammed straight into his chest. “Oh, wow. That’s... I….” Dean found it hard to find the words to express how much the gift meant to him. “You sure he has to go to college? He could just hang out here with us and work at the lodge.”
“Next year,” Cas confirmed, meeting his eyes. “I think you’ll enjoy it. Besides, I fear Jack will ditch us for Claire as soon as all the presents are opened.”
“It’s been a decade, Dean. Of course, I’m ready.” The snarl was the only tone Castiel was capable of now that his wish was coming true. He nuzzled Dean’s neck, fully intending to leave a mark or two of his own. Despite his inexperience, he could feel what his man had been doing to his own neck and did the same.
He captured his mouth in a searing kiss that obliterated all thought from Cas’ head, allowing his body to take over. Cas started thrusting, making sure to hit that spot as Dean fell apart beneath him. His lips went over the hot skin of his lover as Dean’s hands glided over every inch of Cas they could reach.
His phone was wrenched from his hands before he could reply. Dean’s eyes were barely open, but he managed to put it on the nightstand on his side of the bed before resuming his position.
That didn’t mean Dean and Benny had an easy time of it. A few years older than Dean, Benny had been patient and supportive of him while Dean processed his acceptance of his sexuality. Benny stood by him when Dean came out to his parents, who also had known for years that their son wasn’t straight. They had simply waited for him to decide when he wanted to “share your truth,” as Mary had put it.
Dean cupped his boyfriend’s face, kissed his forehead, and nuzzled it briefly. Then, he pulled him into a warm hug, reassuring him there was nothing to worry about.
“It still amazes me after all these years how much effort everyone puts into decorating for the holidays,” Cas admitted. “I love it so much. It never feels like Christmas is coming until I see the Santas waving from the top of every other light post.”
Through his own self-experimentation, Cas had learned he liked it a little rough. He had not yet shared his results with Dean, who seemed to know what his lover liked instinctively. For the most part, they were still finding their way sexually, but Dean had tried a few things out that Cas very much liked.
That was one order Cas had obliged with no problem, even slipping in a bit of tongue before breaking the kiss. Dean had taken a moment to collect himself to Cas’ satisfaction, but that was all they had time for as John and Mary had emerged from the other side of the room at the same time Sam and Jess came downstairs.
It occurred to Dean what John’s real issue was concerning Cas. It wasn’t so much he didn’t think Cas was worthy. Cas’ affection for Dean was only a small part of the bigger issue. Dean thought back to all the times John would pointedly mention prenups to Sam and joke about protecting his assets around Jessica in a thinly veiled attempt to manhandle Sam into his way of thinking. To all the conversations Dean and Sam would have afterward, where Sam would let out all his frustration and tell him how it didn’t matter because Jessica had already declared she wouldn’t take anything from him when they were married — not even his name.
“One other song I love was that one you sang tonight, ‘If I Didn’t Have You.’ I’m a huge Amanda Marshall fan — again thanks to Jack — but I’ve never heard it sung live and I thought you did an outstanding job. Really did it justice.”
Cas loved seeing how the subject of film got Dean’s blood pumping. It truly was a passion for him. He had never really got into horror movies himself, but maybe with the right titles that could change. Jack was more into foreign cinema and comedies from the 1930s and 1940s with an affection for superhero films.
“You sorry you’re not playing tonight?” Jack wondered if it was weird for Jo to watch Sam and Dean perform without her.
dreamy in that movie,” Cas said wistfully. “And, well, you really can’t go wrong with Barbara Stanwyck.”
“Oh, this isn’t about Cas,” Sam informed him. “This is about how nonchalantly you just offered up that info.”
John had always been fiercely protective of his family, a trait Dean loved and inherited along with Sam. The brothers were known to close ranks — even shut out their parents — if one or both felt attacked or needed time alone. Essentially that was what had happened when Dean and Lisa broke up. Less so when Benny had ended things with him. At that point, Dean had mourned his mentor and friend more than his lover. With Lisa, Dean needed time to figure out why he couldn’t make things work with her. Was it just collateral damage of his chosen career or him? Sam had taken care of him for months before Dean had agreed to let in their parents.
However, the battle was decided when Dean unwittingly shook his ass he extended his reach for the towel.
This wasn’t the first time Dean had gone for a drive after something had gone wrong with Castiel. Fights (both arguments and knock-down dragged out brawls) and disappearances were the surface reasons he slid in the driver’s seat of Baby and hit the road. Deep down, he did it because he wasn’t at peace with himself. Every disturbance in the force left a mark on him in places that weren’t visible to the naked eye.
“You okay?” Sam was concerned about the waves of anger rolling off his big brother. It had been a long time since he had seen Dean this upset, confirming how important Cas, Jack, and their future life was to him.
While his lover had his way with Castiel’s neck, the angel put his hands to good use. They kneaded Dean’s ass before making their way up his chest, gliding along his muscular abs until his fingers found those nubs again. This time, he worked them both getting the most delightful sounds out of his man. As soon as Dean arched his back fully, mouth parting from Castiel’s soon-to-be-marked skin, the angel put his lips to the anti-possession tattoo just above Dean’s left breast. A protection sigil that did as advertised, it featured a pentagram inside a double circle surrounded by a sunburst. Castiel kissed and licked every inch of it.
Dean grinned. “I have a vast amount of experience and only with women. However, I will cop to watching gay porn on occasion. Still like my busty Asian ladies, but there are men called twinks who make me think of you when I watch. As for the angel part, we’ll take it a step at a time.”
An upstairs bedroom was where Sam found one of the escapees. She attacked him from behind, knocking the Taurus PT92 nine-millimeter from his grip and onto the wood floor. After a prolonged fight that left a fair amount of wear and tear on him, he was able to slide the demon-killing knife into the skin of the human suit it was wearing. It was dead and Sam moved on to find his team.
“Oh, good! You found everybody!” Jody blew through the front doors with a mischievous grin. “Are we settled? Cas, I promised these boys a fantastic meal.”
Despite being concerned about what was happening with Dean, Cas had managed to accomplish all his tasks in the time he had allotted. He had sent Jack home twenty minutes ago as there was precious little work for his son as everything that could be handled had been. Assistant Manager Anna was attending the front desk and would be in charge until she went off duty at ten. She had insisted on working her full shift despite her boss offering the opportunity to cut out early for the concert. With the event being live streamed, she said she would just watch it on the big television in the common area since it was connected to the Internet.
She supported his music no matter what. That hadn’t wavered even after they split. However, being the girlfriend of an absentee boyfriend was no fun. Lisa came on tour when she could, but she had a job that she loved and only so much time off at her disposal. The long absences began to corrode their relationship. As soon as they had been in the same town again, Lisa told Dean they needed to talk.
“That’s me,” Dean confessed when they parted. “The domesticated bad boy. Corrupting God’s hottest soldier.”
Speaking of yesterday, he remembered the spark that jolted through him when their fingers touched as Cas handed him the key card for his room. Had Dean felt it, too? Was that what had caused his flustered reaction? Something similar had happened in Minneapolis. They had shaken hands when a charge of energy shot between them. Their hands stayed connected for a few seconds longer than necessary as did their gaze. When they separated, Cas had felt like he had been unplugged, the extra power leaking from him just as quickly as it had been delivered.
“They’re for my house. I wanted you to be able to let yourself in after you came home from hanging out with your family tonight. Also, so you could come over whenever you wanted.”
Lunch was held in the dining room of the lodge in front of the large window that made up three-quarters of one wall, offering a view of the forest as well as the mountains just beyond. Two tables were pushed together lengthwise to accommodate their party of seven with John and Mary sitting at either end; Dean, Cas, and Jack on one side; and Sam and Jess on the other. There weren’t many guests in the room so they essentially had the place to themselves.
It was a Cas song as far Dean was concerned and if he didn’t mind hearing it again (and he honestly doubted it would be an issue), then the matter would be settled. He walked offstage to where Cas and Jack had watched the show from the wings. Seeing the
This was better. His heart was pounding in his chest and from the vibration reverberating dully against his own, it seemed Dean’s heart was doing the same. Somehow, this helped his emotional state. Cas melted into Dean, planting a couple kisses along the other man’s shoulder before buying his face in his lover’s neck.
He continued, telling of how they physically went their separate ways after graduation yet never lost touch. About Jack’s biological father, who had abused Kelly during their two-year relationship. Kelly had finally found the strength to leave him when she learned she was pregnant. She never told her ex about the baby, which had fed into her paranoia about him suddenly showing up in Snow Falls. To everyone’s relief, he never did.
“I don’t care, I love it. All of it.” Castiel’s cheeks flushed. “I have extremely limited experience with sex and not as an angel. Also, I’ve only ever been with a woman.”
Before he had time to think, Castiel gave those globes a squeeze before parting them and shoving his face inside, his nose grazing Dean’s hole as he did so. What had initially been a chuckle coming from his man transformed into a slight moan. Castiel observed the clenching that accompanied the sound. Something had happened. He did something, but what? Replaying it in his mind, he deduced it was when his nose grazed the anus.
He kept his gaze on Cas. “What if I want to dream of someone tall, awkward yet sexy with dark brown hair?”
Sam smiled and walked over to the front desk. “I remember you. Minneapolis last month. You told me ‘Home’ was one of your favorite songs of ours. Then, you went to my brother and made him your Number One fan.”
have been here for the past nine days watching them flirt, seeing how they light up the damn room whenever they see each other or talk about each other. They get each other. They have a short hand already that blows my mind. I come downstairs and Cas
Hours later, he was kissing Cas again at the ice rink on the other end of the park. Masters Pond had been frozen over since mid-November, which made it fair game for ice skating once safety officials decreed it so. In the summer, it was a popular swimming destination. The area was secluded thanks to a dense collection of spruce trees that made up a small wood. A luminated foot path that led from the parking lot ensured no one got lost along the way.
When he had reached the couch, Cas took the same seat as before expecting Jack to join him. Instead, Dean had plopped down next to him with a smile that briefly faltered when he saw a look on his friend’s features he didn’t like. Cas had realized his face was revealing he was still brooding over that mystery glint in Dean’s eyes and he had chastised himself for it. So, he had a glint. It didn’t mean it was automatically bad.
Her eyes bore into her husband’s, but Dean felt the personal implications of her words as though she explicitly was referring to him. While not the first time he and John had thrown down, this easily could be one of the nastiest battles if it played out the way he feared. He wouldn’t be the one to concede to her wishes, however. That would be his father’s decision.
Cas shot Claire an annoyed glance before he turned away. He saw the obnoxious wink she sent his way with the self-satisfied smirk. Nor did he miss her picking up her phone a second later. She appeared to be texting. Only one person seemed the most likely candidate.
“What are you fools laughing at?” Dean took a seat next to Cas and kissed him as soon as he sat down. He put his arm around the back of Cas’ chair and leaned toward him.
Cas put up a hand when Dean moved to see his stocking. “No. You can see it for the first time tomorrow. It’s his present for you.”
The young man pointed his fore- and middle fingers at his own eyes and then at Dean’s, mimicking Dean’s own gesture from earlier in the evening. “You minding your manners?”
As much as he hated to admit it, two-and-a half years after his last relationship and he was still hesitant to put himself on the line for anyone. Damn if the attractive father didn’t make him want to risk it.
Cas didn’t know how to react. So many emotions were fighting for control and there were a variety of moves he could make. Ultimately, he went with the simplest. He wrapped his arms around Dean’s shoulders, embracing him. Tears streamed down his cheeks when Dean hugged him back. It wasn’t enough. He needed to feel as much of his lover as possible. So, Cas climbed onto Dean’s lap, resting on his heels.
Dean wakes up nearly explosively with a loud snore and suddenly shifts his head. He finds himself laying half next to, half on Cas' torso, one arm around him, one of Cas arms around his loin. Deans drool was dripping on Cas bare chest and left small, white, half dried traces. As far as Dean can see in the sparse light Cas eyes are closed and he looks peaceful. Maybe he meditates, thinks Dean still sleepy and dizzy. They're still naked and he looks up and down at them. „Ow my“ he whispers, licks his lips and mouthes the words „it happened, it really happened.“
„Dean, is everything alright?“ Dean hears the panic in Cas voice and looks up to him. Eyes watery in tears. He wipes over his face.
Cas looks at him, seemingly not knowing what to say or what Dean intends to ask, he rephrases. „Is it embarassing for you?“
As Cas was fed up with their theories he told them that „there is obviously a market for translations from ancient or dead languages.“
Cas hesitates, there are just about two steps left between them. He makes a step, „yes“, and whispers „I'm nervous. I don't want to do something wrong.“
„Look … forever is long. I know I said forever myself just a minute ago. And I mean it. But don't expect to much of me. You know me. I … I wasn't treating you always right. And later … you know. If I'm coming from work to meet you in our beautiful small house and I'm annoyed by my coworkers and the homework I have to do for evening school; I'll be a douchebag. For sure. I may take my frustration out on you and you will start hating me and then forever is no concept anymore and you maybe stop liking me and don't give me puppy-eyes anymore. Even a lifetime can be long.“
„You don't know.“ says Dean agitated, still on his knees with Cas in his arms, gently brushing through his hair. While he plots his tactic, he notices that he never been so close to Cas and his cheeks feel warm. He is pretty sure that he is currently blushing like a middle school girl. „Keep it together now“ he says to himself. „This counts now. This is probably your only chance.“
So after one minute and a half he starts shouting. „Come on. COME ON YOU SON OF A BITCH.“ And as he turns around in anger ready to shout more insults, to wake everything and anything, he sees himself standing there. Same face, same clothes, but with a crooked smirk on his face. In a strange, sarcastic voice this Dean in front of him says „Congratulations. You managed to wake me up. And now?“
Now that plans about a house became real, they started packing their stuff in cardboard boxes. Dean fantasized about barbecues with the guys from work. But first they had some long weeks and especially long after-work hours in front of them. Tired from painting or building, they sat at the front porch in the dim light of the evening or on their tiled kitchen floor with a beer. Around them shavings, tools, dust. They looked at the wood and concrete skeleton that soon would be their home and had a strange feeling. Unbelievably tired from work on one, happy on the next day, but on some it felt like pretending.
After Eileen got up, the four of them exchange plans for the day at the kitchen table. Everyone seems to be sure that it's still time for vacation and the serious life planning can wait. Cas frowns a bit looking to Sam, knowing that he already is a step ahead and wondering why he isn't saying anything. Sam and Eileen announce that they will go city hopping by train and will be away for at least four days, maybe even longer.
„But it's okay to have a vacation from all that for now, I guess.“ Cas says, „At least for a comfortable amount of time.“
„What I want to say … it felt good, really good, but it was more ..., well you know what I mean, don't you?“
Suddenly he feels a twitch, a pinch in his chest. He tastes something on his lips, something familiar. Someone familiar. He remembers how it felt last night, to have his arms wrapped around Dean. His warm skin, his eyes and how they finally saw Cas, how his chest lowered and raised while he was peacefully sleeping.
So lessons learned ... don't compare too much, try to be positive and learn from others. At least that's what I learned. Check out SaltyWords/agent4hire22 fic - great author as well as artist!
He cannot breathe. Dean feels as if his heart stops, some seconds pass, which feel incredibly long, but then like a victory, he laughs and hugs Cas. One hand casually and intimate at the back of his head, the other one at his lower back. Cas notices the difference in his attitude immediately. Is this true? Dean exclaims „You're awake.“
Cas is struggling for words. This is one of the most beautiful and adorably helpless gestures of Dean ever. Even the awkwardness of him not being romantic at all somehow renders it romantic again just because of his nervous look. Cas feels like laughing and crying at the same time. But feels it so strongly, it hurts.
But as soon as he got the idea that he wants to do it to Cas, it's just inevitable, pure curiosity on the border to passion.
And as Cas looks at him, soft and assuring, with a subtle, kind smile, loving eyes, it 's nearly magnetic.
As soon as he realizes how stupid his explanation sounds, he exhales, annoyed by himself and adds „It's not because of needing a name, ok. It's because I think that's just right. That's how it should be. You and me.“ And after a break „If you want to.“
Dean laughed and smirked and made witty jokes, but Cas felt how tense he was. It's as if a persons muscles, emotions, fear and insecurities could induce a smell. It was invisible, but must be noticed and can be resisted. When he met Dean and started living under humans, he had a hard time to distinguish all these sensible, different emotions, that appeared like nearly indistinguishable shades of
Dean just now fathoms that he did it, he wasn't sure he would be soon. Getting up with shaky knees, he tries not to let on about how strange the idea of sucking another guys dick seemed to him all the time and how aroused he is know. Calmly and somehow appearing tired but horny he props himself in front of Cas, who still collects himself and eyeing him. It's still not decided if he is mad at him anymore.
„See, there aren't many cases. This is the first in about three months. And it's maybe not even a case. We're just checking because we have nothing to do and it sounds strange. Case-ish. If it's staying like this, we maybe have to look for a regular job. Have you ever asked yourself how you want to go on with your life?“ Deans facial expression isn't giving anything away. „And you with Cas, I mean, are you going to be hunter husbands? How's it going to be? Maybe you should take the time to think about that, too.“
