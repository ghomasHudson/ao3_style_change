Sarah nods and turns to enter the living room to watch tv with her brothers. She sits next to James and lays her head on his shoulder. Steve can’t help but smile at the scene. Sarah always found comfort in her older brother. It had been James caring for her during their captivity with Hydra.
“I like him being here, too. Actually...I like both of you being here. It’s...nice.”
Peter waits until his dad is out of earshot before turning back to Flash. “Sorry. I didn’t think he’d come home early. Honestly, I didn’t think you’d even show up.”
“What happened?” Bucky teases and ruffles his nephew’s hair.
The stabbing pain in his head is what jolts Tony awake. He groans and reaches up with one hand to inspect the damage, finding a bump on the back of his head. He forces himself up into a sitting position, still rubbing at the bump that he knows will be there for the next few days.
“You don’t have to be. If you’re still thinking about him-”
The alpha standing above him screams and Steve’s eyes shoot open. Pierce screams again and he staggers, losing his balance and Steve quickly rises to his feet, ignoring the pain in his side. He quickly rips his pup out of the alpha’s arm and lets Pierce fall.
“I believe you and Peter need more time to get to know each other and create a bond. You have 15 years to make up for.”
Steve smiles and kisses Tony softly on the lips. “So glad,” he says once they part.
He doesn’t go up to the apartment; it wouldn’t be home anyway, and he follows the team into the communal room. The reception following the service was worse than being at the cemetery. Peter didn’t want to mingle and hear everyone’s condolences. He just wanted to be left alone.
“Hey.” Tony frowns. “We’ve grown very close. You should see us.”
“I’m this close, Cap.” Tony uses his index finger and thumb to show Steve just how close he really is to leaving. Steve is smiling again and Tony frowns. “This is the part where you beg me to stay.”
“Hey,” Steve soothes and Tony glances up at him again. His own eyes are just shiny. “This one’s on me.”
“He just seems...odd,” Bruce frowns. “I know everyone grieves differently but-”
There doesn’t appear to be any visible injuries, but it’s obvious the man is shaken up. His shirt and pants are torn in a few places and covered in dried mud. He’s not wearing a coat; his body trembles from what Tony can only assume is from the chilly weather. Or maybe it’s fear. Maybe it’s both.
Peter just rolls his eyes.
Steve smiles. “I love you too.”
Peter smiles softly. “I think I like that better. I mean Iron Man is so cool, but I like my dad a lot more.”
“Fuck,” Tony releases an animalistic growl and forces Steve’s legs open to expose his wet hole. He inhales deeply.
Steve realizes just how scary that thought actually is now that he’s said it out loud. Peter was growing so fast and showing signs of walking. Steve had been thrilled when his son increased his motor skills, but now he couldn’t help but feel anxious.
“Another pup? We already have four!”
Steve nods and buries his face in Tony’s chest, muffling his sobs and staining Tony’s shirt with his tears. Tony holds him close, soothing him with soft touches and comforting words. They don’t talk much after that. Tony knows Steve will open up to him when he’s ready. He just hopes that’s soon.
“You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to. But if you ever need to talk then don’t hesitate. I’m here practically everyday. Stop by whenever you want.”
Peter giggles. “Yep! It’s tradition. And we have to ride Space Mountain until we throw up.”
“Yeah,” Steve agrees with a small smile. “It’s not so bad. I think I can do this. I think this is good.”
There had to be something else they could do.
One minute Tony is clutching onto Alexander’s suit and being escorted out of the room, then the next a sharp pain is radiating through his head. Tony grunts in pain and falls, hitting the carpeted floor with a thud.
story,” Tony tells his assistant.
Then it stops.
“Peter?”
At the sound of his name, Steve turns to glance over his shoulder, finding Sam standing at the top of the stairs. Steve sniffs and quickly wipes at his eyes, doing everything he can to hide the fact that he had been crying.
“So how’s school?” Tony asks, deciding to beat around the bush for a while.
“It was just gas, hon.” Tony teases. He chuckles when Steve frowns. “I’m kidding. He almost smiled for me. Maybe he just likes you better.”
“Nothing,” Steve shakes his head, “just...nervous.”
“Did I wake you?”
“Because I want a name for our son and you’re wanting to name him Ben Ben!”
“What the hell is wrong with you? I told you to stop.”
Steve walks Tony out, chuckling softly when Tony frowns at the idea of having to leave his son behind. Tony makes sure to give Peter plenty of kisses before he goes.
“Well…” Peter winces. “Kinda. I don’t know. He’s not feeling good.”
Not many of the members in his group knew about his past life, but the ones that did loved to hear the stories. Many of the younger members only knew about him from the interview he had done years ago and the horrific story he had the guts to reveal. Everyone had their own experiences; some mild and others extreme, but at the end they were all the same. They were all trying to heal and move on.
“It’s not.”
“And you do? I know you’re hesitant. I know you’re doubting me.”
“Is my dad okay?” Peter tries again to make conversation. This time he gets a response that isn’t sarcastic or dripping with annoyance.
When Steve pulls away he can feel eyes on him and he glances in Tony’s direction, finding his fiancé staring with a smile on his face.
Steve shakes his head and sits up to lightly kiss Tony on the lips. “Keep going,” he says and lies back, his legs falling open.
Tony winces and sneaks a peek in Steve’s direction, not surprised to find his mate frowning at him. He mouths ‘sorry’ in hopes that would be enough. Steve smiles and shakes his head.
“And a baby.”
“Okay.” Tony looks over Steve’s face, noticing the bruises. “Did he hurt you?”
“Just what?” Tony asks, his eyes narrowing in Flash’s direction. “The door was closed. It’s suspicious.”
“That’s Tony Stark’s!” Ned exclaims, a little too loudly for Peter.
Steve continues with his story, vision blurring with tears as he’s forced to relive the horror Hydra brought upon him. He tells Fury about the pups and the plan to create the perfect alpha. He tells him about Alexander Pierce and how cruel and evil the alpha really was.
Steve blows out a breath and feels himself bear down against the pressure. It feels right and he takes another breath before doing it again. He grunts softly and continues to push.
His fingers hover over the keyboard as he contemplates sending the first message, but he holds back. He was tired of doing all the work while his dad did the bare minimum. That’s what got them in this situation in the first place. Peter had done too much, expected too much.
“He won’t!” Steve promises. “I can do all the training and I swear he won’t tear up the place.”
“Time is an issue.”
The next thrust of his hips has Steve crying out and his back arches off the mattress, eyes going wide and mouth falling open with a moan. Shocks of pleasure shoot through him, forcing him to give into it, to welcome it. He gasps and moans with each brutal thrust; he was close, just like Alpha said he was.
Happy frowns. “What?”
But that was the point. He needed to be here and talk. He needed others to listen and help him regain his confidence.
Tony doesn’t find it unusual that Steve sleeps in, nor does he question his husband’s absence during breakfast. He’s seen Steve do this before, back when he was pregnant with their son. The beginning was always the hardest, Tony knew this firsthand. He remembers helping Steve when morning sickness decided to strike or when the fatigue became too much for even the serum to handle. Tony knew how this part worked. He wasn’t worried.
Morgan doesn’t drift off to sleep right away, instead keeping her eyes locked with Tony’s. He smiles down at her and gently strokes a finger along her face. Her eyes flutter, only to open again.
“What is the most traumatic thing that’s happened to you?”
Steve is left panting from the fight, but he doesn’t have time to recollect himself, and he rushes through the corridor as fast as he can. The wound in his shoulder stings and his vision blurs with tears from the smoke, but it’s not enough to slow him down.
“I’ll think of something,” Tony smirks.
Tony awakens to the sensation of the sack being ripped away from his head. The next thing he becomes aware of is the stabbing pain in the back of his head and the tight pressure around his wrists. Tony’s eyes flutter, his vision blurry and unfocused. His eyes shut from the exhaustion and his head lolls to the side.
“No!” Peter tries to deny it, but it was obvious his papa could see right through him. He still firmly believed that he and Flash were still enemies. Maybe acquaintances now since they’ve started talking more, but Peter would never consider them friends. They were just two people having a baby. That was it.
Tony chuckles and gently takes Peter into his arms, mirroring the position Steve had him in. Tony turns his head to press a kiss to the curly brown hair on Peter’s head.
And I changed Clint from a beta to omega. I’ll explain that too 😛 Thank you so much for reading and I’ll update soon!
Clint peers over Natasha’s shoulder. “He sort of resembles an old man, though. Hey, Stark, you were right about him looking like you.”
Steve locks the door and leans against it, both hands coming up to cover his eyes when the tears begin to fall. He releases a sob, his body shaking with each one. It’s a kick from inside his womb that has him calming down. He glances at his belly, and removes a hand from his face to put it over the spot where Peter was kicking.
Peter nods his head again. He prays the questions stay mild.
“I wasn’t expecting to see you here,” Natasha says, coming over to greet both Tony and Bruce. Her eyes narrow and Tony can only pray she doesn’t punch him.
“Yes!” Flash hisses and rolls his eyes in annoyance. “That thing! Obviously it’s not safe here and my place is off limits until I can break the news.”
Peter nods and glances down at his lap. He hears footsteps, then the door is opening and then shutting.
“The same way it probably happened to us. We weren’t very careful. Mistakes happen.”
“I don’t understand.” Pepper sniffs and Bruce quickly hands her another tissue to blow into. “He was fine! We talked and he was so excited to come back and his son-”
“Steve?” Tony calls out when he enters the bedroom and finds the room empty. The adjoined bathroom door is shut. The closed door is an obvious indication that Steve wants privacy, but there’s an urge to be near him. Tony can’t shake it.
With permission granted, James rushes over to the table to inspect its contents. Harley follows, mimicking his brother and licking his lips at the sight of the variety of muffins. Sarah puts up a fight in Pepper’s arms, clearly annoyed that she’s not getting a chance to explore. Pepper takes the younger pup over to the table, helping her pick out some apple juice and a blueberry muffin. Steve smiles to himself. Those were Tony’s favorites.
“Of course.”
But falling for the alpha was off limits. They were strangers and for all Steve knew Tony didn’t look at him that way. Steve wasn’t sure if he saw Tony that way. Maybe it was his hormones making him believe that he felt something for the alpha.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s nothing. Maybe it has something to do with you?”
Tony holds up a hand to stop his son from lifting up the sleeve of his shirt to show off the bruise. “I’m good. So what are you some kind of super kid?”
“It’s okay if you did. I guess in a way you were right. I can’t handle our daughter sometimes. I thought having a baby would be this...incredible experience. And believe me I love that little girl more than anything in this world, but this...Tony, it’s this part I can’t handle. I don’t understand why I feel or say the things that I do. But I’m trying to get better.”
And it’s time to get a rescue mission set up! I’m bringing in new characters. Hope no one forgot about Natalie 😉.
Tony catches himself frowning again as another thought enters his mind. He wonders if Steve’s left their son in someone else’s care. Probably so. Steve would be prepared and smart like that.
Their hands intertwine and Tony brings Steve close. He gently cups Steve’s face and brushes away the tears that roll down his cheeks. Steve sniffs and tries to turn away, but Tony brings him back.
Steve doesn’t stop, and he continues to kiss and lick along the mark. He traces the dents his teeth created with his tongue. Tony groans, his eyes fluttering shut from the jolts of pleasure that shoots through him.
That smile on Steve’s face returns. It’s not as vibrant as the one before it and it’s obvious there’s not much joy behind it, but it’s better than seeing Steve upset.
Steve grips the alpha harder and throws him to the floor, issuing a strong kick to his side. The alpha gasps and crawls away, fingers stretching for the blade. Steve kicks him again and the alpha recoils and wraps his arms around himself to block off any more attacks. Steve picks up the knife and with his other hand, curls his fingers tightly around the back of the suit jacket and drags the alpha out of the room and down the corridor.
“Steve, keep pushing. The baby’s going to crown soon.”
“Steve?” Tony comes closer until he’s standing near Steve’s side. “Honey, she’s hungry. Steve-”
“Language.”
“It is my fault though. You’re pregnant because of me. Tony, I swear if we could switch I would.”
Another contraction cuts him off.
He opens his arms wide and smiles. “Ta-da!”
Bucky frowns and pulls back slightly. “No.”
“Pete-” Sam hesitates and he shares a look with Nick.
“I’m sorry,” Steve apologizes. “I’m a mess.”
“He jumped in front of me!”
But as he sits in the sterilized room and listens as the doctor tells him that his body was fine and healthy, he finds himself questioning the doctor.
Peter turns toward the sound of his voice, eyes blinking open and revealing the tears that have gathered there. His bottom lip juts out, quivering when those tears roll down his face.
He serves himself a cup and returns back to the couch, carefully lowering himself down beside Natasha. She’s managed to calm Morgan down and his daughter is no longer fussy, instead her eyes are wide open and trained on Natasha’s smiling face.
Some members of the team struggled to believe that Tony was here to stay, while others were willing to welcome him back if it meant Peter would be happy. Peter’s happiness would always be a priority of theirs. It always has been.
“They’re so selfish! All they do is talk over me and hog the attention. Peter is always training with them and Harley...I know he’s little but he needs to share too. I don’t want to live there anymore. They don’t care.”
“You didn’t.” Steve shakes his head and makes an attempt to sit up, only to get as far as half way and propping himself up on his elbows. “It was him. He was…”
“I do!” Peter defends. “That’s the problem. I like so many that can’t pick one.”
Just like he and his unborn child were.
Sleep doesn’t come, not that he was expecting it to. Going to bed angry with Steve made it impossible to get any sleep. Tony let his mind wander, wondering if Steve was struggling just as much as if he was or if he was perfectly content sharing the bed with the dog.
But Peter needs space. And Tony needs to give it to him.
Steve smiles sadly. “Yeah. I wish she was still here. I guess we’re both alike in some ways. She sacrificed her life to care for others and I...I guess I did the same.”
“Relax,” Sam assures with a small smile. He tries to sit up, wincing as he does. He waves his nephew off when Peter tries to help.
Tony peers up at him. The fear on Peter’s face was infectious. Tony didn’t even know the situation but he could feel the same fear. Maybe because he’s seen the same terrified and concerned look before.
“James,” he calls out to the oldest, but the pup doesn’t regard the name. He probably doesn’t even know that’s the name his mother had assigned him at birth. For all Steve knows Hydra could’ve called him something else. “It’s okay,” Steve assures, keeping his tone calm. “I won’t hurt you.”
The ability to speak is gone. All Steve can think about is letting Tony take control and use the cuffs. He wants to test it out and see if the cuffs can hold him.
Steve nods and opens his mouth to speak, but he’s never given the chance. Pepper is pulling him back into her arms and sobbing. All he can do is hold her.
He knew Steve had been abused, but seeing it firsthand wasn’t the same as hearing about it. It was a thousand times worse. Tony was sure he’d never get the painful sounds of Steve’s screams or the sight of him being forced against his will out of his head. It would plague Tony for the rest of his life. It would become his worst nightmare.
“Hey. I just wanted to see how everyone was doing. Glad to see you made it home okay.”
“Not really,” Steve lies again.
“I like that he’s like you. He’s smart, funny, caring. He’s ready to put everyone else before himself. He made one mistake. We can’t condemn him for that. Especially when we did the exact same thing.”
“Yeah.” Tony nods and glances down at the mess he’s made, eyes welling with tears. “My snacks! Steve, I need more! I need more blueberries otherwise this whole experience is ruined! I need my damn blueberries!”
“Need help?” Steve decides to intervene when Tony struggles with the stove. Tony turns at the sound of Steve’s voice, his face heating up at the realization of being caught.
Tony scoffs and rolls his eyes. “What does it look like?”
Tony keeps his word and gets up to assist whenever he can. Steve does the feedings and he takes care of the soiled diapers. They work as a team.
“I guess we’ll see.”
But his friends weren’t oblivious or stupid, they could read him and tell whenever something was bothering him.
“Just not feeling well,” Steve replies and lays one hand over his belly.
“No. This is perfect. I kind of wish no one was coming by later so I could just spend it with you.”
Still nothing.
has been dying to interview Tony about the abduction.”
He needed to stop feeling sorry for himself and fight the grief. All his life he was taught to get back up and keep fighting. It was easier said than done. Most days Peter wanted to stay on the ground. But that made him an easy target for life’s kicking and punching. He had to rise up and stay strong.
“It’s fine. I promised I’d help, didn’t I? Plus, being in your private jet beats regular airfare. So...the pup is yours. That was what you were hoping for, right?”
The alpha only smirks and steps closer to his leader, his gun still aimed in case Steve disobeyed. It’s purposely aimed at the baby.
He’d be a father. Something he never imagined himself becoming. It would be his responsibility to care for the fragile life. He could barely take care of himself half the time. It was Pepper and Happy who were always checking in to make sure he was still breathing.
Steve’s blood runs cold when he hears Rumlow’s gun cock. The alpha only makes it to the first step before he’s pausing and pressing his fingers to his ear, listening to an order Steve can’t hear.
“Push! Just one more push!”
“How does it look?” It’s a question Alpha asks every single time. Ever since the first two failed, the alpha had started asking about the pup’s condition.
Everyone shakes their heads.
“They party you drank at?” Tony questions, his anger only growing the more his son speaks. “The party we grounded you for? That party!”
The beta is doing his best to console the upset pup while Harley and Sarah play a game of who can scream the loudest. Harley is deemed the winner.
The moment he knew about his son, Peter was his top priority. Peter would always be the most important part of Steve’s life. Being Captain America didn’t matter anymore.
“I should’ve fought harder. I-I-I should’ve-”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sorry.” It’s a response he deems appropriate for this situation. He had made a fool of himself during Tony’s birthday and now he was doing it again for his. He needed to get his shit together.
It hadn’t been the first time.
Steve smiles at those words. “I’m lucky to have him. And you and everyone else. I couldn’t do this otherwise.”
Steve’s eyes are glossy with tears. “That kid is long gone. I want to heal, Tony, believe me I do. I’m ready to try again and…find myself.”
Then Tony asks him to dinner one evening and Steve’s mind is instantly back on the potential proposal. He tells himself to calm down when Tony says to dress nice. Steve makes sure to take extra time getting ready.
“It’s not worth it.”
Peter’s not surprised when his papa picks up after the first ring, nor when he promises to be there in fifteen minutes or less. His papa had always been this way. Ever since Peter was a little kid, his papa smothered him with love and affection. The attention was nice and Peter enjoyed the warmth and comfort his father brought, but now that he was older, he needed space. He wasn’t a baby anymore.
“Oh yeah?” Steve smirks. His cock is already twitching with interest.
“Thank you,” he says once they’re out in the hall. “I couldn’t have done any of this without you. I don’t know how to repay you.”
“Hey, it’s going to be fine.”
“Can you get me some drugs?”
“Stop fidgeting,” Tony tells him when he catches Peter toying with the sleeve of his hoodie. “You’re gonna make me start doubting you and I just told Steve I trusted you with my life.”
“I know,” Peter nods. “I’m okay. Just...dealing with it I guess.”
“Don’t fall asleep. You didn’t ask me to babysit.”
“No.” Steve shakes his head. “I know how. Thank you, Dr. Banner. For everything.”
“I guess we better get up, huh?” Steve murmurs against Tony’s skin.
Steve smiles, this time a little brighter. “Yeah.”
Out of all the times they’ve gathered in this room, none of them ever imagined it would be after burying one of their own. The day had been one of the most difficult any of them have ever had to endure. It didn’t even compare to the grueling missions they’ve had in the past.
Peter must have made a face because Ned’s going pale and backpedaling.
Happy arrives a few minutes later and lets himself in. Steve is coming down the stairs to greet him when the next contraction washes over him. He groans and steadies himself on the rail. Happy rushes over to help.
“He deserves it, Steve! Look what he’s done to you!”
Bruce hums but doesn’t appear convinced. He turns to Steve, eyeing the omega closely. “Steve?”
It was that time of year again. The nights were longer and cooler. The leaves on the trees were changing color and falling from their branches. Houses in every neighborhood were decorated with orange lights and a pumpkin on every doorstep. Pretty soon those neighborhood streets would be littered with children of all shapes and sizes, dressed in their costumes and bags full of candy.
“Fuck. Gonna…” Is the only warning Tony gives before he’s coming inside Steve. He ducks his head down, burying his face in Steve’s neck and grunting against the skin he’s marked up. His body shivers and his hips stutter. He pulls out and rolls over onto his back.
Steve smiles and his eyes fall shut. It’s not long before he’s purring softly.
It worked out in the end. The room wasn’t just his anymore. It could fit Steve comfortably for him to recover. The bed was large enough to hold both of them.
“Fine. Trying to catch up on everything. And I know you’re calling about those contracts. I swear I’ll get to them.”
“You were also born an alpha. You had respect the moment you took your first breath.”
“Hey,” Tony soothes when Steve’s eyes grow misty. He cups Steve’s face in his hands. “It’s okay. I know how happy you are about this. I’m sorry for ruining the experience. Pregnancy and me just don’t mix. It’s one of the reasons why I was afraid to do this in the first place. I knew it wasn’t going to be enjoyable for me.”
“Nope. He knew I was trying and gave us some of your old stuff. But then it happened and Sam and I decided to wait until it was safe I guess. I don’t know. Apparently it’s bad luck to say anything too soon. I didn’t even talk about it and the bad luck still got me.”
The last thing Steve wants to do is panic, but he can’t help the uneasy feeling that washes over him. This was all wrong. From the very moment they knew they were expecting, Tony had promised to be there for more than just the birth. And for the most part he kept that promise. Tony did everything and anything to prevent himself from missing a single moment. He had been there for the gender reveal, the first kick; nothing was missed.
“Because it was,” Steve answers. “Someone had a tantrum and refused to do it.”
“Okay.” Tony nods. “Have a good night. And remember, don’t hesitate if you need me.”
“So it is my fault.”
Steve chuckles softly. “Maybe. It’s worth it though.”
“No,” Natasha shakes her head. “I don’t want you to. I’m sure Bruce will agree with me. And of course there’s Peter. He finally has you in his life. Don’t let him down like you did Steve.”
“That was before you voted on the kid being a boy. I’m saying girl now.”
“Isn’t it obvious?” Bucky teases.
Steve chuckles. “You’re thinking too far ahead. And you won’t drop him. I’m not the only one with instincts, Tony. You’ll know what to do.”
“Nothing to talk about,” Tony replies.
“Guess he likes a good party like his old man.”
“Steve?” It’s Natasha’s voice that comes through his comm.
He’s not too surprised to find one of them knocking at his door. It’s a little late, but they’ve showed up like this before. Of course that had been during one of his late night cravings. He can’t help but smile now that he gets to tell them that about the name he’s finally picked out.
He should have known that he was pregnant. All of the signs had been there and he chose to ignore them. He should have taken better care of himself, of the child he was supposed to nourish and protect. He failed.
“He knows me,” Tony replies. “It’s a long, long story. I don’t have all the details and I wish I did. I don’t even fully understand it. All I know is we met somehow and he’s pregnant with my kid.”
This chapter and title was actually inspired by the song The Night We Met by Lord Huron. Here's the link if anyone is interested. I swear I listened to it on repeat while writing this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQh9eDcS1-0
Steve sighs and lays his head over Tony’s shoulder. “I wish it did.”
“You didn’t. You’re a good mother. I see it with Pete.”
“You need to take it easy,” Sam says and he clasps a hand over Steve’s shoulder. “How are you gonna take care of that kid if you’re over here passing out?”
Pepper’s mouth gaps in shock. “A-gent? No no she’s my assistant. She’s not an-”
But when Steve wakes up that morning, he should’ve known his mate would twist the plans. The right side of the bed is empty and before Steve can ask Jarvis where the alpha was, Tony is coming into the room with a tray of breakfast foods.
“You can open it later if you want,” Tony says, though he secretly hopes Peter would invite him in and they celebrate like a family.
His older room offered more comfort. Alpha had rewarded him with his own room and bed. He was special, at least, that’s what Alpha liked to say. The omega didn’t feel special now.
He gives his friend and daughter one last look, then he’s turning away and heading back in the direction of his own apartment.
Tony smiles down at Peter’s sleeping face, taking it in every detail. He can see most of his features already, and the dark hair atop his head was no doubt a Stark trait. There was a bit of Steve in Peter’s face, but it was evident that their son was going to take after Tony.
“Jerk.” Bucky throws a pillow at his husband this time, hitting him perfectly in the head, causing Sam to lose his balance and fall over. That brings on a new fit of giggles.
Peter doesn’t want to talk. He wants to run away and never see them again. They hated him. They were disappointed and would never look at him the same. He couldn’t stay here.
But now Steve was picking those pieces up and gluing himself back together. Tony had never seen Steve act the way he had when taking down the two alphas. It was both terrifying and exciting. Steve was finally gaining back the control that was stolen from him.
Steve wraps his legs around Tony’s waist to bring him closer, crying out when Tony goes deeper. Tony starts to move, rocking his hips slowly. He’s unable to keep up the slow pace and he thrusts faster, the sound of their hips meeting echoing in the room.
Tony cocks his head in confusion, his brows crinkling and creases forming in the center of his forehead. “That’s today?”
I’m glad I’m finally updating this one! This has been one of my favorites to do and I really hope I can wrap it up soon and give everyone the happy ending they deserve!
Here is the part where Tony finds out. I tried to feel sorry for him but I just couldn't....not as bad as I feel for everyone else. I hope you all enjoy this and I will update this weekend!
Panic ensues. He shouldn’t have come off so strong. Tony had claimed he felt the same way but maybe he meant something else. Maybe they weren’t on the same page. Steve’s ruined it.
“You can sit down,” he says and gestures toward the sofa when Peter remains in the foyer. The kid nods and makes his way over to the living room, shrugging his backpack off and sitting down gingerly, almost as if he’s afraid of ruining the piece of furniture. Tony can’t help but roll his eyes. “Scotch?” He offers and the kid shakes his head.
“You’re so wet, baby. Fuck look at you. You’re making a mess.”
Peter doesn’t mention the fact that his dad was already on Bucky’s bad side and should probably never show his face at the compound unless he wants it beaten to a pulp.
“I won’t,” Steve interrupts Bruce. “I’m not...I’m not calling again.”
Peter nods. “I know.”
“Nothing. Forget it.”
Steve’s face burns with embarrassment. He never thought he’d be having a conversation like this with Tony. He tries to remind himself that at one point he’d been intimate with Tony, and not to mention that Tony had aided him during the delivery of their son. There was no reason for him to be so shy.
“Hey, it’s okay. And I know you’re happy about her. Do you know why?” Tony asks and when Steve shakes his head, Tony continues, “because you told me. Remember all the times you were excited about her? When we first found out; when you first felt her move; when you first held her. I know you’re happy to have her.”
“When you were getting ready. And don’t worry I packed everything he’s going to need. It’s only for a couple of hours.”
Everyone loved Captain America. He was a hero among all ages. Big and small; it didn’t matter. And there was no doubt that Steve paid extra attention to the little kids that adored him. Tony remembers the fanmail the team used to receive when the world learned about them. Tony had his fair share of letters and drawings from the younger members of the Avengers fan base. But it was Steve that received a little more, and the smile that would appear over his face when a new letter was delivered was infectious.
Bucky’s face falls and his eyes fill up with tears.
Nick nods. “It was going to happen eventually. Hopefully I won’t need to drag you out of retirement, but if I do-”
“You did so good,” he praises, lapping and kissing Steve’s fresh bond mark. Steve purrs in response. “You’re so perfect, so beautiful.”
It’s longer than expected so hopefully that makes up for the delay 🤷♀️
“Yeah,” Peter says quietly. He reaches for the paper his papa had given him and carefully smoothes out any wrinkles. “Don’t forget the spider in the center. He drew it that way.”
I don't know how I feel about this chapter. It seemed so much better in my head, but I'm posting it before it gets too late. I hope you guys enjoy it anyway.
“Hey, don’t apologize. I can get up more, I promise. And if I don’t wake up just throw me out of bed or something,” Tony jokes. This was usually the part where Steve laughs, but he doesn’t even crack a grin. Steve appears calmer, though, so Tony wasn’t about to complain over the fact that his husband didn’t laugh over one of his lame jokes.
“He’s there. The old Steve is still there. I know it doesn’t seem like he’s ever coming back, believe me I wonder about it sometimes myself, but he’s there. Hey, look at me,” Tony urges when Steve tries to turn away. Tony cups Steve’s face in his hands, forcing their eyes to lock again. He gently brushes away the tears that don’t stop falling. “It’s okay. You’re going to get out of this. I don’t care how long it takes, but I’ll do whatever I have to. I’m not going to lose you. I need you. Morgan needs you.”
The elevator stops and the doors open. Tony steps out first and Peter trails behind. His brows furrow when he realizes they weren’t at the penthouse.
The sound of an engine roaring cuts through Peter’s panic and he whips his head around, relief washing over him when he spots the flashy sports car. His dad emerges a second later, and that’s when Peter rushes toward him.
Steve yawns and allows his eyes to fall shut.
The alpha turns around and gives an order to the beta. “Draw more of his blood and analyze it carefully. I need to know how special this one truly is.”
“It’s going to be fine,” Steve assures and takes his place at the table. He takes a drink from his coffee, unaware that the smell is getting to his son.
He doodles quietly in his notebook during his English class. If his teacher notices she doesn’t comment and continues with the lesson. He pauses to admire the drawing, his heart clenching at the shield he’s just sketched. He scribbles over it.
“What?”
I'm so so so sorry for the late update! Being sick and having writer's block at the same time is a real pain in the butt. I'm better now and finally got around to updating this one! There is a bit of angst in this chapter because well...it's me so what did you honestly expect? Anyway, hope you all enjoy it!
“Back away,” Rumlow orders and pushes Tony into the room. Tony staggers momentarily and Steve rushes toward him, only to back off when Brock points the gun at him. “Back away.”
The phone call was what made Peter decide to sneak on the jet and help. He knew a little bit about his dad and the history his parents had, but he’s never seen his papa call or beg his dad for anything. It had always been the two of them and that was enough. They didn’t need anyone else.
“I can’t help but notice the discomfort you’re feeling. If I may, sir, suggest seeing a medical professional.”
“Why are you wearing sweatpants?” Ned asks anyway.
“It’s your decision. This is about you, remember?”
It’s bittersweet. He wanted to experience everything Tony was lucky enough to go through to bring their son into the world. He wouldn’t mind the constant aches and discomfort or the mood swings and food cravings. He’d love to feel the little kicks and rolls from inside.
Flash nods again, then he quickly turns away and disappears down the hall, leaving Peter to wonder what kind of conversation they would be having. He could only hope Flash was still on his side.
“No. Maybe. I don’t know.”
“Okay...I mean...it’s what Steve would’ve wanted, right? You’re the perfect person to wield that shield.”
“Are you gonna tell him?” Sam is the first to ask the question that’s been on everyone’s mind; Steve’s included.
She could stay with her aunt for a few days or a week or maybe even a few years. Auntie Nat knew what it was like to not have a home. Maybe she’d be more understanding.
Tony’s thought of leaving the team a few times. It wasn’t like he really belonged with the group Nick scraped together. They were all outcasts, and maybe that’s why he was chosen. It didn’t matter. He didn’t fit it, didn’t play well with others.
Peter seems satisfied with the pancakes, and he shovels large portions into his mouth.
Steve doesn’t recognize the base, but he’s a quick learner and his memory sharp. He easily remembers the way Rumlow and Rollins dragged him. The way is guarded by more alphas, but Steve’s not afraid anymore. He dodges their bullets, avoids their attack, and once he has control, he takes them down. Some run off like a scared puppy with its tail between its legs, saving Steve the time. No more could be wasted.
“At least you used washable markers,” Steve chuckles.
Natasha comes over with a couple of gift bags and hands them to Steve to pass out. Tony snatches the one with cute safari animals and rips the tissue paper out, letting it land on the floor near his feet.
“Spider-Man?” Steve raises a questioning brow. Peter nods his head.
“Um…” Flash’s face pales.
“Steve, he’s okay. When we go back to the tower he’ll be sleeping alone. Let's just try one night okay? He’s safe. We’re close by and Jarvis is always looking out for him.”
“Dodger? You named it?”
, Steve has to remind himself. Doctor Strange encouraged him to speak kindly of himself and to never feel guilty about what happened in the past. Steve didn’t have control then, but he does now, and it’s up to him to decide what to do with that new control.
Bucky and Sam are still bickering about the gender. Natasha rolls her eyes and threatens them. That eventually shuts them up.
“You wanted to get to know me.”
Sam picks up on the hesitation, but decides not to question Peter about it.
“You miss him, don’t you?” Pepper asks and Tony glances up at her.
“Not me, daddy!” James argues.
“Then get out of here. He’s busy.”
For once Tony is in his office bright and early Monday morning, ready to start the day. Usually his Monday’s aren’t always like this. It’s rare for him to be bright eyed and bushy tailed, but the past few days haven’t been brutal towards him.
“Really?” Ned’s attitude brightens almost instantly. “What’s he like? He seems really cool!”
The next few weeks pass with ease. Steve has warmed up significantly to not only his new home, but to the alpha he shares the space with. Tony was no longer a stranger or just another alpha, he was his mate. They were properly bonded now.
“Dad!” Peter cries, his cheeks turning pink and hot with embarrassment.
“How are you two not married yet?” Sam asks one day during a morning run. Steve does his best to ignore the question, not wanting to talk about his love life during one of his breaks. He loved his son, but sometimes he needed a break.
His team doesn’t protest.
“I think I’d remember if you did. I wish I had some magic serum. My back fucking hurts and my head…” Tony reaches up to touch the bump he knows will be there for days, and winces.
“He is,” Steve agrees. “I’m fine. I like him.”
Awww yay they’re getting married! I just love writing them so happy ☺️
Steve chuckles. “We’ll see.”
“Hey, Cap what’s up with him?” Tony asks.
He’s running late but that was to be expected. Running late for a meeting in the same building he resides in shouldn’t be a thing-even Pepper would agree- but this morning Tony decided to switch up his daily routine.
There was no point in kicking himself for doing something differently. It wasn’t like they could have prevented Steve from miscarrying. It was one of those things that couldn't be stopped, no matter how hard Tony wishes it was.
“It’s okay. I’ll get them the best therapist money can buy. And you too. I know talking about this won’t be easy but you have to talk to someone. I’m not enough, but I’ll still listen. I’ll still comfort you.”
But now he had no choice. He fought long and hard to comfort his son, and all of his attempts had failed. He needs help. He needs Tony.
“I didn’t...I didn’t think I could...I wasn’t supposed to.” Steve chokes back a sob. He squeezes his eyes shut when the tears threaten to fall. His attempts at keeping them at bay fail and a few are rolling down his cheek.
He hadn’t told his mate about it yet, or anyone else for that matter. Harley knew but only because Tony trusted him not to say anything. The toddler didn’t have a very big vocabulary just yet.
“You love talking about papa, huh? Me too, Petey-Pie.”
“I wish you didn’t say that.”
“No spiked eggnog?” Tony teases.
Steve waits another second, hoping his son would be comfortable enough to come forward, but when he doesn’t, he sighs.
“Then why did you call him? Why!” Steve demands.
“He’ll be back,” Tony continues to talk to her. He rocks gently again in the chair. “And we’ll be together again. He’s going to be so happy to see you. Hey maybe we can visit him…” Tony pauses and frowns. They’d have to figure out a time when they could go by the facility. Steve was only allowed weekly visits.
“Okay,” Tony chuckles and he gently pushes his son back. “Go to sleep.”
Tony smiles back and affectionately rubs his thumb along Steve’s knuckles. “I know. All I want is for you to be happy. You’re free now. Free to do whatever you want. If you want to draw then you can do it. If you want to find a job then you can. I’m just saying you have freedom now and I don’t want you to waste it.”
The rest of the day passes with a blur. Peter was sure his classes would help keep him distracted, but he couldn’t be more wrong. No matter how hard he tried to focus on the lessons, he just couldn’t. All he could think about was his father.
“I’m sorry. I’m sorry for what’s happened to you.”
“I wanted to see dad before he left.”
Tony frowns. “He told you?”
“Yes. I know. I’m going to help you. I’ll do whatever it takes to make you feel like yourself again. I promise.”
So Peter texts his dad on the first night the team leaves. Much to his surprise, his dad texts back and asks him to come over.
“Tones, you know why,” Steve is quick to remind.
“Did those alphas ever…”
“It’s fine,” Peter lies. He knew what kind of job his aunt and uncles had. From a young age he had been exposed to the type of his work his family did. He hated it whenever his papa had to leave. And now he hated that everyone else was leaving too.
He grumbles again and rolls over onto his back, one hand coming up to scrub along his face. His eyes finally open and land on the ceiling for a moment before locking with her identical ones.
“I’m well aware, sir. But perhaps this time it could be shared?”
Tony nods. He noticed Peter didn’t say if Barnes was okay with it. He hopes they don’t meet face to face.
Peter gasps, eyes widening when he meets familiar blue ones in the mirror. He spins around to face his papa, finding him standing in the doorway.
“No we don’t. Get away from me,” Flash tries to get inside the car, but Peter is faster and puts himself between the flashy vehicle and his bully.
Tony rolls his eyes. “Okay definitely. I definitely would have sucked your dick.”
But before she can form any words, the subject has been changed and she’s left to listen instead of speak.
Tony gives up on creating a suit to join his son. They spend rest of the evening watching the videos and remembering Steve.
“We’re not friends,” he tells the dog, getting another bark in response. Tony sighs and reaches out for the dog, gently patting his head. “Guess you’re not so bad. We’re still not friends…not yet anyway.”
“What’s the mission?”
Two black SUVs are waiting for them outside. Steve allows himself to be led to one while Tony is led to another. Before either one of them can be pushed inside, Rumlow gives another order. A few minutes later a helicopter appears overhead and fires a missile straight for the place Steve had called home. The mansion is engulfed in flames, and its walls crumble.
“With us,” Steve corrects and lays his head on Tony’s shoulder. “I know you’ll be an amazing father.”
“Are you okay?” Steve asks, soothingly rubbing Tony’s shoulder.
“Maybe we should stay in.”
Steve is discharged from the hospital the next day. A part of him is relieved to return to the comfort of his own home, but the other half is guilty for having to leave his son behind. If everything had gone normal and smooth, then he would be going home with Peter. But luck wasn’t on his side and instead he’s forced to leave the hospital without his son.
Valentine’s Day wasn’t a holiday Steve was particularly fond of. He never understood the hype and the idea of spoiling that special someone only once a year. Showing love and adoration for your significant other should be all the time. Maybe he was just bitter because he never had that special someone to spend the day with. No one looked twice at the skinny guy.
“So what do you want to know?”
“Holy shit. Steve, what the hell-” Tony tries to ask, only to be cut off when Steve lets out a small scream. He’s never seen Steve like this before and it terrifies him. “What happened?”
“Are you sure? Maybe you just need to lie back down.”
“I got so angry. I didn’t understand why you were taking her from me. I’d never hurt her, Tony.”
Steve listens to his son’s rambling, watching the way Peter’s face lights up. From the moment Peter could talk, he didn’t hold back, especially when the topic was about something he loved. It was always amusing to watch him speak and the way his face contorted into different expressions. Half the time Steve had no idea what his son was even talking about, but he found himself too engaged to care.
That’s when Tony steps in. “Hey,” he says.
“I’ll come get you for dinner,” Sam says.
Tony takes a deep breath to calm himself and plops down in one of the chairs near Steve’s bedside. Steve is still asleep, enjoying the bit of comfort he has before the contractions are too strong for sleep.
“Okay. Now can I pick one?” Steve questions.
James snarls in response and holds his brother and sister tighter. Steve’s eyes travel to the other pup, a small smile forming over his face.
“Pete?”
“We can take our time. I’ll do whatever you want.”
Steve’s stomach churns at the words. He sucks in a harsh breath when that same finger dips inside him. Steve writhes against the alpha and emits another warning growl, but he’s held down tighter. Rumlow leans closer and buries his nose against the omega’s scent gland; he inhales slowly.
“He’s not here, Steve.”
The objective of the mission was simple: rescue the hostages and take back the Stark weapons that were stolen. It seemed simple enough, and though it had been easy to sneak aboard the ship, that was where the simplicity of it all ended. At least, for Steve it did.
“Is that why Harley is mad?” Morgan jabs a thumb in the direction of the living room.
“Don’t worry about it. Sweet dreams.”
Tears gather in his eyes at the horrible memory. It would forever haunt him.
“Sorry, Papa, but I have to go.” Peter scrambles to his feet and gathers his backpack, tossing it over his shoulder. He makes sure the flowers are still arranged perfectly, then he lays a hand over the bronze shield. “I love you.”
Tony shifts under the omega’s gaze and quickly turns away. “I’m fine. Maybe a little tired, but fine.”
“Okay.” Bruce nods. “I’ll give Steve a quick exam and then we should be done here.”
“Shh.” Steve shushes her softly and gently takes her into his arms. “It’s okay, sweetheart. You’re hungry, aren’t you?”
“We’re still missing something,” Tony says.
Tony lets out a heavy sigh and rolls over on his side, propping his head up on his elbow. “Steve, I-damn you’re so gorgeous,” Tony says, reaching out to stroke his thumb along Steve’s cheek. “God, I wish we worked.”
Peter steps closer to the monument and places a hand over the shield. His anger bubbles until he can no longer keep it contained. He’s never been so angry with his papa for leaving. If his papa would have listened to him then he’d still be alive.
“What? What the hell are you talking about?”
“Just a few weeks. I haven’t told anyone other than my team. They deserved to know,” Steve replies.
Tony collapses in his chair, a choked sob escaping him. Countless articles and pictures of Steve fill Tony’s line of vision; it’s all he can see, and no matter how hard he tries, he can’t bring himself to look away.
Peter quickly glances in the direction of the front doors, his heart racing at the sight of Flash. He was used to his heart rate increasing whenever he caught sight of Flash; he was terrified of being pummeled or mocked. But Flash was different toward him now. He wasn’t super friendly, but he was learning to be civil. Peter would take what he could get.
“Steve, you can help him and I can-”
“I know, I know. I’m just saying. He’s...he’s a little messed up. Okay, maybe a lot. He’s not perfect, but he’s a good guy. Just don’t hurt him okay? I may be his bodyguard and chauffeur, but I’m his friend first.”
“What took so long?” Natasha questions.
“SI.”
“Mama?” James pulls on Steve’s pants and points at the table.
“Steve, darling, look at me.”
Separating from each other wasn’t the plan Tony had in mind, he felt safer in numbers, but splitting up made the most sense in their situation. They could cover more ground this way and find both their son and the exit a lot quicker. But Tony was still hesitant to leave his mate’s side.
“Hmm…” Steve thinks it over. “That’s true. I do like that place.”
“Yeah. Yeah, of course.” Tony twists his body to rummage through the nightstand drawer. He comes back with a bottle of lube and a condom. “You meant this right?” he teases and Steve rolls his eyes.
“Tell me about it.”
This chapter is sad. Poor Steve 😔 I’m starting to get more into his history and what Hydra did to him. He has a long road to recovery.
“He came back. That has to count for something, right?” Bruce argues.
“How do you know that!” Tony yells, his outburst startling Steve. He’s never seen Tony so upset.
“It’s okay. You’ll have more control this way.”
“Just don’t be late,” Natasha says with a wink, then she rises from her feet and leaves the room.
Tony is a good alpha. He really cares about Steve and their pup. He's hesitant with a lot of things still, but again, they don't really know each other. They'll get there! I'll get into more of Steve's story and the abuse he's been through.  I will update soon!
Steve chuckles and turns back to finish breakfast. Pretty soon a plate full of pancakes and bacon is being placed in front of Tony.
But Nick had other plans, and now he was once again face to face with the person he thought had been lost forever.
“Please.” Tony begs to anyone who’s listening. “Please don’t take him. Please.”
“Relax, Pete. You didn’t know. No one does.”
“Yeah. Why wouldn’t I be?”
“No. Keep...keep going. Fuck me, Tony.”
At those words, the lump in the bed moves and throws the blankets off. “Yes. But why does it have to be so early?”
Steve huffs out a small laugh. “Favorite boys, huh?”
“You’re hesitating. Why?”
He was a father first, and soon to be husband. In just a few months he’d be tying the knot with Tony. It’s something he never envisioned happening. Their relationship had ended and they were supposed to have remained friends. But that didn’t work out, and then having Peter changed everything.
“Me, too.” Tony tries to sit up again, only to wince and slouch back down. “Maybe I’ll take a break.”
“I’m sorry,” Natasha apologizes when she catches the glare being sent her way. “It’s cute. Seriously. Peter Ben.”
Tony can’t help but cringe at the new name for himself. He had gotten used to Peter just referring to him as Mr. Stark, but now that they’ve spent the past few minutes getting to know each other, Peter felt comfortable enough to start calling Tony dad.
Steve visibly stiffins. He thought he had gotten better about keeping himself together when his abuser was brought up, but just like everything else in his life, it was a work in progress.
Bucky’s own eyes fill with tears. “Who are you fighting for, Steve?”
“Hurry up. You have two minutes,” Flash says. He glances nervously over his shoulder every few seconds, almost as if he’s expecting someone to be eavesdropping on their conversation.
“Yeah! Hmm…” Peter thinks it over for a second before his face lights up. “You can be papa!”
“This is...different. I’m so used to her being closer, pressed against me and now…” Steve’s eyes glisten with fresh tears.
“Eh. More like…” Tony makes a curving motion over his belly.
Natasha smiles and adjusts herself so that she’s closer, but not too close to apply even more pressure to her friend’s belly. She places her hand over the large bump, hoping the ice cream has kicked in and awoken the little boy.
“Why? They seem happy for us,” Tony replies.
“I think-” Tony starts and takes Steve’s hands. “-you’re overthinking. Don’t worry about him or anyone else. Today is about you and our son. Nothing else matters.”
“It’s not much,” Tony says lamely when they reach the extra bedroom. “I figured it was better than the couch.”
Steve glances down at his bare finger and sighs. “He’s asked me but I said-”
“Gonna...cum!” Steve cries and he reaches between them for his cock, stroking himself along with Tony’s thrusts. Between the feeling of Tony’s cock rubbing along his walls and the friction of his own hand, it doesn’t take long until Steve is coming undone and spilling over his hand.
“We have to try. I promised to keep you and our son safe, and I’ll die trying.”
Pepper peers up at him. Steve wonders if Tony’s told her about him and the superhuman strength he had. He wonders if she knew everything about him and his past. If she does, she doesn’t show it and she sends him another warm smile.
He’s reminded that he’s not entirely alone. He still had the rest of his family, so he decides to test the waters.
But Tony wasn’t a big, mean alpha. He was loving and kind. He would never hurt anyone. Especially his family.
He’s still slightly grumpy, but he sits up anyway and stretches his arms over his head. “What’s up, Fri?” He asks, hoping she had a good reason for waking him.
“You were,” Nick cuts in. “Let’s just say the world wasn’t ready to let you go yet.”
And just like that, Bucky knew he would do anything for this kid.
“Hmm?” Tony hums.
Morgan packs quickly and zips the suitcase up, then she opens her door and peeks her head out. She can still hear the tv on but nothing else from her brothers. The muffled sounds of her parents come from their bedroom; they’re arguing again.
“Sorry. I can’t help it.”
“M-more. Tony, please.” Steve begs, purposely clenching down on the alpha’s finger. Tony complies and increases the pace, then he’s adding another finger and thrusting them harshly. Steve’s breathing picks up, the heavy pants growing harsher when Tony’s finger gets close to that spot inside of him.
It’s not long before Steve is underneath him again and moaning his name. Their bodies are pressed together, and Steve wraps his legs around Tony’s waist, urging him closer. Tony fucks into him harder, punching out pleasured gasps and moans from Steve’s lips.
Steve inhales sharply and rises to his feet. Peter follows and pretends to find interest in the punching bags they had been using earlier. Steve knows he’s just trying to give the adults space, but his son was sneaky and loved to eavesdrop on conversations that had the topic of Avenger assignments in them.
“I wouldn’t say that.”
Pepper winces. “Oh that reminds me. There’s been a few issues with the tower in Hong Kong. A meeting is scheduled next week-”
Five minutes later, omegas begin to trickle into the room. Steve stiffens and glances down, pretending not to notice as the chairs around him start to fill up. The mixture of the sweet scents is soothing, but Steve still can’t help but grow nervous. He’d have to open up and talk to these people about the abuse and torment he’s gone through for the past few years.
Steve scoffs and tries to turn away but Tony is faster and he pulls Steve back.
“Go away.” Peter tries to push his father out of the doorway.
“Hey,” Tony says soothingly, pulling up another chair beside Steve and lowering himself in it. He leans closer, reaching out to rub along Steve’s shoulder. “Steve, talk to me. What’s wrong?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“He didn’t know that!” Peter yells. “You never picked up the phone! You always ignored him!”
“We’re going to get through this.”
Tony nods and pulls the bottle away from Peter’s lips, emitting a whimper from his son’s pouty mouth. Peter searches for the bottle, growing agitated when it’s no longer in his reach. Steve takes the fussy baby into his arms and begins comforting him, holding his son close to let him smell his scent. Peter still whimpers, his cries growing louder.
“It’s fine. Pete, I’m not mad. I was just waiting for the right time.”
It’s evident that Morgan missed him more than he missed her. She stares up at his smiling face with her rich, brown eyes, and reaches up with one tiny hand to explore Steve’s cheek. Steve leans into her touch, his smile growing brighter. More tears begin to spill from his eyes and roll down his face, but even that’s not enough to force Morgan’s hand away.
The doctor follows his gaze and she frowns. The same concerned look Tony is wearing is now on her face. “Steve? Is everything alright?”
“Come on, Petey. You need to eat. Just a little okay?”
She does her best not to worry about it.
“No you won’t. Not with that baby-”
“Say no more,” Tony holds up a hand. “I’ll work on your suit. Sweetheart, you’ll love it.”
Steve’s eyes are full of tears, and they begin to roll down his face. Tony moves closer to console the scared omega. The alpha in him is urging him to protect Steve and keep him calm.
“We need to look him over. He’ll be alright,” The doctor says, and Steve glances up at her.
“He even has all the really old
“Me either. I love that little girl more than-”
Another whimper comes from the omega. Steve tries to make himself even smaller, and despite his large frame, he manages to pull it off. He was the one who was really broken.
“I love you. You know that, right? I’m crazy about you. I don’t know what I’d do without you.”
“Uh good. I mean she does poop a lot and sometimes she cried, but we did get along pretty well. She’s adorable, Mr. Steve sir.”
Peter curses to himself when he sees his dad lingering in the doorway. He jumps up from his chair, ready to put himself between his father and Flash.
Tony hums in response and wraps his legs around Steve’s waist, urging him closer. Steve bottoms out in one thrust, causing both of them to groan. Steve gives Tony a moment to adjust before he starts to move. His movement is slow and cautious, careful not to hurt the baby. Tony grows impatient and bucks his hips.
“Where’s Uncle Bruce?” Peter asks, frowning when he realizes more of his family was missing.
“I think it’s more of your style. Why?”
With his son down for the night, Steve is able to get some time for himself. His body demands he rest now that Peter is sleeping, but he can’t bring himself to sleep.
Steve sits nervously on the exam bed, nervously playing with his fingers while he waits for the results. Tony has started to pace the room, hoping the movement would calm the fussy baby in his arms.
The drying stimulation appears to be working, a pink flush is spreading across the baby’s skin. Tony rubs the towel a little harder over the baby’s body, catching sight of the way his son’s face begins to scrunch up. Then finally, a small whimper can be heard.
“I don’t know. I don’t know his name.”
“No!” Tony rushes toward the door to block them. “Wait. I want to talk to the kid.”
Once the call ends, Peter drops his phone and jumps out of bed to be ready to meet his new lab partner.
Tony frowns and decides he’s had enough of arguing with the A.I. He goes to check on Steve instead, hoping to find him in high spirits. It’s wishful thinking. There was no reason for Steve to be at ease, not with his captor on the loose and searching for him. Tony’s not surprised that Steve has locked himself away. It’s how he felt safe.
At those words, Tony is jumping out of bed, scrambling around the room in search of some pants.
He moans softly when Tony kisses and bites the sensitive flesh of his neck. Tony’s hands are back and they slowly lift up Steve’s shirt, exposing his upper half. Steve raises his arms and the shirt comes off completely. It’s thrown somewhere behind him.
It’s not long until Steve is following after and he cums with a shout of Tony’s name. He stills his hips, grunting as he releases his load. He pulls out slowly, his cock going limp.
“Tony!” Steve tries to make a run toward his alpha, only to be pulled back and shoved down to his knees. He’s forced to watch as Rumlow yanks Tony up and orders him into a similar position. The gun in his hand is pressed to his head. “Please!” Steve begs. “Don’t. Don’t hurt him.”
“You okay?”
“Super fast, huh?” Steve smiles and ruffles Peter’s hair. “I want to see more of that speed tonight when you’re brushing your teeth.”
Peter gives the cat another rub before deciding to head to the guest room and start on the bit of homework he did have. But he doesn't gets very far.
“Please?” Peter begs. “I can help!”
“Wake up, honey,” Tony gently pats Steve on the thigh, jolting him awake. “I gotta clean that nasty cut and you need a shower.”
“The funeral?”
Tony becomes a blur, just another memory that Steve forces himself to forget. If Tony wanted to be selfish and move on, then damn it Steve was going to do the same. He could be selfish if he tried hard enough. His whole life he had always been putting others before himself. But things were going to change. His happiness and his son’s happiness was being pushed to the front of the line.
Steve gives a shrug in response. “Fine I guess.”
It was Tony and his team who had the idea to organize a press conference. For a while now the media was wondering what the famous billionaire had been up to since he was rescued and returned to the land of the living. Tony had been brief, not going into detail about his experience. The world only knew that Tony was abducted by a past business partner and held hostage for a large sum of money. It wasn’t entirely true but the public didn’t need to know that.
“Ste-”
Morgan nods and turns back to her barely touched dinner. She’s not hungry anymore.
“You don’t remember?” Alexander chuckles. “You must’ve had more to drink than I thought. He’s blond and has blue eyes.”
“Why?”
“I think I’m liking Captain more than spangles.”
Steve bites back a groan when the pain happens again. He’s trying to time them just in case. Passages from the baby book pop into his head. He was fine as long as his water didn’t-
(See the end of the chapter for
Their friends are gathered outside of the room in the small waiting area. They all rise to their feet when Steve appears.
“Fuck, Tony!” Steve cries out from one particular hard thrust, tipping his head back and exposing his throat. Tony wastes no time in marking up the soft flesh.
The pain tapers off into a dull throb and he’s able to relax again. It’s not for long, and the pain returns, this time starting in the same place and wrapping around his belly. It makes him gasp, and attract attention from
Steve wasn’t sure what to expect when he comes face to face with his abuser. It had been months since they had been in the same room together. Steve had believed they would never see each other again. He’d give anything to go back to that night and go through with his original plan. Alexander Pierce would be dead right now.
“Is that a good idea, sir?” Jarvis finally decides to respond. Tony scowls and picks his tablet up again, hoping to use it as a distraction to keep himself calm.
“Steve?” Doctor Patterson is standing behind him. “What’s wrong? What hurts?”
Sam smiles and takes Bucky’s hand, intertwining their fingers. They only take two steps before Bucky is gagging and rushing for the sink. The room fills with the sounds of his retching.
“You’ll be okay,” Natasha assures, but her tone is off. She glances up at him again, determination flooding her eyes. “We need to go. We can make it.”
Steve nods and Tony grins. Tony leans closer, his warm breath ghosting over Steve’s lips. Steve’s breath hitches in his throat when Tony kisses him. The kiss is slow and soft, but he knows that pace won’t be kept up for long.
“Steve, it wasn’t. None of this is your fault.”
“You don’t have to tell me,” Pepper begins softly, “but if Tony’s the reason why you’re crying then him and I are going to need to have a little chat.”
“You’re comfortable here, huh?” Steve says softly and Peter peers up at the familiar sound of his voice. “Maybe we can stay with daddy a little longer, hm? Sound good?”
“I just want to go home.”
Steve nods and lays Sarah down in the middle of the large bed, sitting down beside her to tuck her in and brush her blond hair behind her ear. The moment her head hits the pillow, she’s yawning and blue eyes are fluttering shut.
“Oh my God. Tony, I don’t know what to say.”
There really was a baby.
“Oh so he’s mine when he’s being a stinker?”
“My best friend’s name is Rhodey...”
Steve knew his fear, and every time he had to remind Tony that he wasn’t Howard and their children will love him no matter what. Tony wanted nothing more than to believe his husband’s words. But all he could think about was hurting the family Steve so badly wanted.
“You’re so beautiful,” Tony murmurs against the corners of Steve’s mouth. “Can I see more of you?”
“Not at first,” Peter replies. “I honestly didn’t think he knew how. I mean when I was older I wondered about my dad, but he was enough, you know? I was just lucky to have him.”
Before Tony can even respond to the question, it’s being answered for him when Steve enters the room with Sam and Bucky trailing behind him.
done so much for you.”
He didn’t have much himself, but he was forced to learn how to cook after his mother passed. He needed to fend for himself, especially since he didn’t have an alpha to care for him. The times were different now and omega’s didn’t need alphas so much anymore. But he’d be lying if he said he hasn’t thought about having a mate.
“I get it,” Sam waves a dismissive hand. “Four pups all fighting for your attention...I don’t want to take that away.”
“Go to the jet. I’ll meet you there.”
“I can’t wait to meet him.” Natasha smiles as she rubs her hand over the spot where her nephew was kicking.
Tony frowns and takes another drink, making sure to gulp down the liquor. He’s ready to order another when Steve makes his way over.
Steve wracks his brain for a reason for his son’s discomfort. He double checks his diaper and finds it clean, then he takes his temp just in case. Everything appears normal, and yet Peter was still upset.
used to be.
Tony smiles softly down at his mate. Two years ago those words would never have been said by Steve. For the longest time he had refrained from using that title. It had been tainted, and only reminding him of the alpha that forced him to use it. Steve has grown significantly since then. The title no longer terrifies him.
So Peter forces Flash out of his mind and looks for Ned to show off the picture he hasn’t stopped looking at. He finds Ned at his locker and rushes over, his excitement growing with each step.
There was still a chance for them to start over, but Peter was hesitant to try. He was afraid that his dad would only let him down again.
With their daughter calm and satisfied with her new playmate, Steve takes Peter as promised. The younger pup is content showing off his building blocks and favorite cars to his mother. Upstairs Steve can hear Sarah’s giggles, the sound bringing a smile to his face.
“Awesome!” Peter exclaims. “I love Led Zeppelin!”
Tony growls again and tries to yank himself free, but the grip around him only tightens.
“Cramps?”
That wasn’t the case this time. Peter wasn’t going to be ripped out of his arms the moment he entered the world. He would be safe
The weekly visits become the highlight of Tony’s week. He’s only given a few hours with Steve, but he’d take what he could get before he’s forced to walk out the front doors and wait until he’s allowed back in.
He had decided a long time ago that he was never going to find a bond mate and have a family. He didn’t have the best childhood growing up, and he couldn’t imagine himself as a father. His own made sure to put him down and make him feel like a mistake every chance he got. The only good thing about him was his alpha status.
“Listen, you wouldn’t happen to know the guy I just spoke to, right? His name is Alexander Pierce.”
Luck had been on their side; they’re pregnant again and so far this pregnancy had been going smoothly. The nausea reared its ugly head and the fatigue didn’t hesitate to make itself known, but that was the norm and didn’t raise any questions.
“I was?”
Steve had years to tell Tony the truth about not only his feelings but about the son they had. He called and left messages but that wasn’t enough in Tony’s book. Steve knew where Tony lived. He could have easily tracked him down.
“The pictures? Yeah.” Peter smiles and places the picture back beside the others. “He’d add mine with them...it made me feel like a fan. He always told me I was his biggest fan and that he was mine.”
Bruce steps out to give the parents time to be alone with their son. Tony follows after him.
“J, again. Please.”
Peter’s decided he’s had enough of the scary hologram and goes back into the living room to check out the rest of the decorations. He’s not afraid of the hanging skeletons or the life size one sitting casually on the couch; he thinks it’s funny. The spiders and webs are his favorite part. It makes sense. He is their little spiderling.
“I hope I didn’t wake you,” Tony says. “I made coffee.”
“Shit,” he curses when it finally lets up. He waits a couple of minutes, and when it returns, he grows even more concerned. Something was wrong and it was clear that the serum was having trouble dealing with whatever this was.
Harley wiggles again for a moment, then he’s relaxing and opening his eyes, locking them with brown ones. He frowns at the unfamiliar face staring down at him.
Steve growls and grips Alexander tightly by the front of his suit and yanks him up off the floor. “You’re a liar. All you ever told me is lies.”
Peter nods and glances down at his lap again. He pulls on the piece of thread again until he creates a small hole in his jeans.
And he hated it.
Feeding isn’t so difficult anymore. Peter already knows where to go when Steve positions him near his chest. The sensation is still odd, but Steve enjoys this time with his son. This was their chance to bond.
There’s a slight pause when Steve takes a breath. Then he’s continuing.
The pleasured sighs and groans slipping past Tony’s lips should be enough. The feeling of Tony, hot and wet around him should be more than enough. And yet Steve still couldn’t get there. He thrusts harder, eyes squeezing shut as he focuses on the sounds his husband makes. It doesn’t work.
“She’s fine. She literally does nothing but sleep and poop all day.”
“Okay.” Peter nods and turns back to the movie.
Tony’s heart breaks at those words. He wants to tell his son that he’ll do better and they’ll find a way to work past this, but he knows when he’s pushed someone away.
Peter just shrugs. “Whatever. I kind of already forgave you for that stuff.”
He kept the name regardless of her teasing and soon he was training alongside their parents. If he wanted to go out and save the world then that was fine, but just like everything else, their parents made a rule for that too. Morgan almost felt bad for him and the extra rules he needed to follow. All she had to worry about was keeping her room clean, making sure she brushed her teeth, and went to bed on time. Okay so maybe those weren’t all the rules, but those were the ones she followed the most.
Morgan nods and Steve sighs.
Peter frowns. “I was fast! Super fast!”
“Morning,” Steve greets, scooting over slightly to make room for Tony. “I made coffee.”
“Yeah. Except you.”
“He will. He’s a fighter.”
“Grumpy?” Bucky murmurs against Sam’s neck.
He doesn’t fight back, knowing the consequences if he were to even try. He might be stronger than them both put together, but over the years he’s learned to submit and follow orders.
“Holy shit,” Tony pants and loosens the grip he has on Steve. Steve pulls off with a pop, his lips red and sticky with evidence of Tony’s release. He licks them clean and that smirk is back on his face. “Darling, that was amazing. Where the hell did that come from?”
Tony’s eyes drop down to Steve’s belly when he places a hand over it. Just knowing that life was beginning to start just underneath Steve’s fingers makes Tony’s stomach churn. It was a life he didn’t want.
“Enough, J. You don’t get to talk about him. Not ever!” Tony shouts.
“I never said that.”
“We’ll be back later,” Steve says. He has Morgan secure in the stroller and her favorite pacifier in her mouth. She’s already drifting off to sleep. Steve smiles and adjusts the blanket around her, making sure she’s comfortable before they go. “You sure you don’t want to come?” Steve asks again.
“Okay, okay.” Tony holds up his hands. “No need to get so defensive. What if I-hang on.”
“You didn’t go right away?” Peter asks.
Bucky smiles and hugs his nephew. He holds onto him a little longer than necessary, almost too hesitant to let him go. It’s not until Sam lays a hand over his shoulder does Bucky release Peter from his grasp.
“I was with Auntie Nat,” Morgan explains.
“Shut up!” Peter hisses and glances around the hall. No one has noticed. “It is his but-”
“I think I did alright with all things considered.”
“No,” Peter shakes his head and yawns again. “Uncle Sam is okay with it.”
“I didn’t mean to take it that far,” Bucky says. “I just lost...control.”
“We’re not getting married. I’m fine where we’re at,” Steve says.
The sound of the elevator causes Steve to gasp and eyes to widen in fear.
The doctor’s words ring loudly in his ears, but Steve can’t bring himself to listen to them. He glances down at his lap, one hand wrapping around his belly. It tightens painfully, pulling a gasp from his lips. Tony’s taking his hand, giving it a gentle squeeze.
“Yeah? How do you know?”
“Dammit!” Tony huffs and pulls himself to his feet. “Fine. No coffee but I need sleep. For once in my life I just want to sleep.”
After his papa leaves the room and he’s alone again, Peter goes through the book. He finds the chapter that describes the week he’s currently in and reads the passage. He giggles to himself when the book describes the baby being the size of a blueberry at this stage.
“Easy there, Pops,” Tony jokes and pulls Steve into his arms. “We can’t be complaining now. We have years of this.”
“Shh, it’s okay.” It’s far from it, Tony knows this, but he doesn’t know what he’s supposed to say. Any ideas he does have doesn’t seem like the response. The only thing he can do is hold Steve.
“And I have to do all of this again tomorrow.” She’s referring to speaking to the police. They haven’t left her alone since the story about Tony broke. She told them everything she knew, but it wasn’t enough. Something wasn’t right.
He needed to be strong and to keep pushing forward, but every day it was like his strength was getting weaker and weaker. He couldn’t be strong like his papa wanted him to be.
“Steve wouldn’t-”
“Lead the way.” Tony gestures with one hand and Peter takes it instead to drag him toward the elevators.
“Yeah. I struggled, but I made it work for you. Peter, don’t ever think for a second that you were a mistake or that my life would have been better without you. Your dad and I love you so much.”
“Maybe. You may not like it but it’s his choice. Steve wanted him to know,” Sam replies.
Shutting everyone out wasn’t his best move, but the last few years had been difficult to get through. Turning to alcohol again was also not his brightest idea, but he didn’t know how to deal with life when it got too rough. Hiding away from it all was how he coped.
With a huff of annoyance, Peter lies back on his bed and tries again to button his jeans, but the button refuses to close and he curses loudly. A knock on the door captures his attention and Peter lifts his head up.
After a few minutes, Peter’s had his fill and Steve lays him over his shoulder, gently patting his back to get a few good burps out of him.
“Petey,” Steve takes over and their son turns toward him. “Remember how we talked about the baby growing in my tummy?”
Brock eyes the knife in the omega’s hand, then he’s shifting his gaze and connecting their eyes. “Going somewhere, Omega?”
“Better?” It’s a stupid question to ask, he knows this, but he’s got nothing else. He’s never seen Tony this sick before. Even after witnessing Tony come home drunk after another Stark event.
“Darn. I was hoping she’d have her mother’s. They’re the prettiest blue I have ever seen.”
“I’m sorry. Are you guys mad?” Morgan asks, her voice timid.
Knowing there was no winning when it came to Tony and his stubbornness, Happy is forced to surrender and back off. Tony walks him out.
“Still no ring?”
Those words only edge Steve on and he continues to pleasure his mate. He’s tempted to take the cock in his hand into his mouth, but before he can put that plan into action, Tony is reaching between them and gripping his wrist, forcing him to stop.
“I’m sorry.” Tony rubs his hand along Steve’s back. “I know this part sucks.”
The voice of reason decides to speak up now. Tony ignores it. He can’t tell Steve about the horrible things he’s done. Steve would never forgive him. Steve would probably leave and never come back.
“Sorry. Guess I’m a little excited.”
“We do, sweetheart,” Steve tells her. “Morgan, we love you.”
Steve has heard similar words before, but it had been Bucky who had said them to him. Just the thought of his best friend dampens Steve’s mood.
He’s left alone when the doctor leaves to set up an ultrasound. Steve tips his head back, a shaky breath leaving him when tears threaten to fall. He still has one hand over his belly, clutching what was left of the small bump.
“You don’t have to. Look, I’m gonna say this. You don’t have to tell me anything if it makes you uncomfortable.”
He waits for the right moment, eyes trained on the two alphas. Rumlow hands over the baby and Peter is tucked tightly in Pierce’s arms.
“She was with Nat,” Steve says and a look of relief flashes across Tony’s face.
Peter’s face burns with embarrassment and he purposely avoids his papa’s face when he mutters, “A few weeks ago.”
He rushes toward Natasha, only to pause and spin back around to face his mate.
“If it’s another mission-”
When they pull up to the tower, Peter isn’t surprised that they use the back entrance to avoid being seen. He’d be lying if he said it didn’t bother him. He wonders why his dad is hiding him. He doesn’t want to automatically assume the worst but he can’t help but feel like his dad is ashamed of him.
“You wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for me.”
“So do you. You stopped making weapons and chose to do better.”
There were times when Morgan became a handful. Getting her on a sleep schedule was one of the most difficult things. Tony was fine with the early morning feedings; it wasn’t like he got a full eight hours of sleep anyway, and if it meant letting Steve get some much needed rest, then he had no problem responding to Morgan’s shrill cries at two A.M.
Steve releases a shaky breath. “I wish I could’ve done more. They were my children and it was my job to keep them safe. I failed them.”
“So what now? We keep it? Yeah great plan. I don’t know about you but I can’t have a baby now.”
“Is it?” Steve quirks a brow at him. He joins Tony on the bed, crawling over until he’s hovering right above him. “You want me to beg, Stark?”
“Go away,” Peter mutters and glances back down at the broken shield.
Peter scoffs and glances down at the picture to calm himself. “He’s always an asshole,” he mutters.
“Fuck it’s already been that long? You don’t really look like him. Or your other parent.”
“I didn’t have a choice. And didn’t really know about-ah! Tony!” Steve doubles over. He finds purchase in Tony’s shirt, gripping the material and twisting it when the contraction peaks.
His stomach tightens again, but it’s the pressure deep in his pelvis that has Steve crying out. He grits his teeth and squeezes his eyes shut. The pressure is worse than the cramping. He forces himself to breathe through it, desperately waiting for it to pass. The feeling only worsens until finally it's diminishing and he’s able to relax again.
“I can get by on my own,” Steve says. And it’s true. He had no problem raising the baby by himself. If Tony wanted to be on board, he’d let him. And if he didn’t, then that was okay too.
“I never said it wasn’t.”
Dodger ends up becoming more than Peter’s best friend. He becomes a brother.
“Yep.” Comes Steve’s voice and both Tony and Peter glance over at the stairs. “Don’t. You. Dare.” Steve warns when he notices the growing smile on his husband’s face.
“That face.”
“I love you,” he whispers. Those three words are meant for both his husband and son.
Tony ignores the ache in his back to attend to his mate. He brings Steve close, making room for him on the bed so that Steve could properly curl up beside him. He comforts Steve by scenting him and pressing kisses wherever his lips can reach.
Morgan continues to stare up at him. Steve’s smile grows brighter. He couldn’t get over how perfect she was. His heart fluttered every time she looked at him.
He then remembers he has somewhere he needs to be.
“What?”
“Yeah.” Steve nods and he quickly pecks Tony on the lips. “Sorry. I-”
Morgan rushes up the stairs to put her suitcase away. She doesn’t bother unpacking it yet, not wanting to waste anymore time. She jumps at the sight of her older brother lingering in the doorway.
“What?”
“He’s not that mean. He’s actually really cool.”
“Yeah.” Steve smiles. He never knew he could love something so much. His heart fluttered every time Peter stared up at him or grasped his fingers.
They continue to reminisce old memories that they’ve made over the years. There’s a few pictures that bring tears to their eyes and others that bring smiles and laughter. Peter enjoys it all.
“Yeah.” Steve agrees with a nod of his head. “Baby steps.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I will.”
“I mean it. Why not? We love each other. Let’s take that next step.”
Steve’s stomach tightens when his lips meet the alpha’s thin ones. The sensation of feeling his lips against his own isn’t new, he’s felt them before.
Steve huffs out a laugh. “No one’s perfect. Well...maybe except him. He is the perfect alpha, but not the way Hydra wants him. He’s perfect just the way he is.”
“And this must be Sarah.” Sam smiles and comes closer to greet the little girl. “Hey, cutie.”
“Aw, Brucie-Bear, did you miss me?” Tony grins.
“I need you.” The desperation in Tony’s voice is almost unrecognizable to the alpha. He usually didn’t beg like this, didn’t have a reason to. But being near Steve was doing something to him.
“It’s okay, Pete. I’m glad you two are getting along and he’s involved. Support is good.”
Peter latches on, greedily taking his fill. Steve winces at the pressure.
Tony sighs and slips his phone into his pocket. “I set up an appointment for you. Next Thursday at ten.”
“I had to be. You probably didn’t prepare for the meeting last night.”
“We have a baby.”
“Well I don’t. I still see that little punk that I used to color with and run around the living room playing superheroes. I hate him being alone.”
“She’s perfect.” Steve smiles.
“Steve, go.”
“Da-”
“Good. I don’t know if it’s over or if this is an intermission.”
Bucky smiles and returns the embrace. “I love you too, dork.”
“Wow. That’s cold. I’m shutting you off.”
But sometimes it wasn’t enough. Steve was still hesitant for the world to learn the truth about him and his past. He only left the tower for his therapy sessions, but other than that he stayed home and cared for the pups.
“Everyone loves presents! And cake and parties. Come on, you did it for me. Please?” Tony turns to begging now, using his best puppy dog eyes to persuade his mate.
Sunday morning proves to be the best time to get work done. Usually it was the day of the week where everyone barely lifted a finger, and instead spent the day relaxing before the start of another workweek. Morgan’s household was no different. Her parents didn’t have to train her brother and their jobs weren’t stealing them away. Even Harley decided to sleep in.
Tony takes his mate’s hands. “We’re getting out,” he says again. “I won’t let them hurt you or our son anymore.”
Steve flushes. He had forgotten about the hat he had borrowed from Tony. It was not the best disguise in the world, but it would have to do for now.
Tony playfully rolls his eyes and sets his Starkpad to the side. “So you hungry? You haven’t eaten much of anything.”
Steve chuckles. “Tempting. Maybe later.”
“I have by the way. Oh and tell Pete to stop dangling from the ceiling to scare Harley. He doesn’t listen to me.”
“Jesus! Move out of the way!” Happy yells out, laying his hand down on the horn again .
The alpha growls and bites down hard on Steve’s neck, breaking the skin and creating a bond between them. Steve gasps, eyes rolling into the back of his head and his body convulsing from the intense pleasure that shoots through him.
The nursery is illuminated by a nightlight plugged into one of the outlets, painting the room in a soft glow. Steve’s eyes are already well adjusted and he can easily make out his son’s fussy form in the crib.
Before Tony can respond, Jarvis is alerting them about one of the pups. James is standing at the door a few seconds later with tears running down his face.
“Oh! Right! Hi!” Peter waves at his other uncles.
“Good,” Brock’s tone is lighter, but still can’t be trusted. “Was that so hard? Know your place and we won’t have any issues. I’m in charge of you. You’re just an omega. The only thing you’re good for is getting fucked.”
He blames the sudden nausea on his nerves. They would be landing in New York soon. Steve couldn’t wait to be home and start the next chapter of his life. He should be happy and excited to finally be free from that monster.
“It’s not. I never should’ve let you go. It was my mission and-”
“Oh.” Ned’s face falls. “Maybe that’s a good idea. I’d hate for you to get attached.”
“She’s right,” Bruce adds with a sad sigh. “Steve wouldn’t have wanted this. He wanted Tony around, remember?”
Steve smiles. “I know. How did I get so lucky?”
Peter quickly unfolds the suit to check on a detail that needed to be there. Tears fill his eyes when he notices the black spider along the front.
“I’ll catch you up with new games. Drinking ones are my favorite but obviously we can’t do those...yet.”
“Huh? Yeah. Yeah, he did. Um I guess forgot. My mind has been a little fuzzy lately.”
The last person Peter expected to bump into was his crush. MJ had been his crush since as long as he could remember. She wasn’t like other girls his age; she was more mature, wiser, prettier too. Peter had it bad for her.
But Steve is impatient and he crawls back into bed, mentally scolding himself for reeking from his workout and ruining the expensive sheets. He ignores it for now and crawls carefully toward Tony until he’s hovering over him. He ducks down and kisses Tony softly on the lips, each cheek, his nose and then lightly peppers kisses along his jaw, the stubble of Tony’s goatee scratching Steve’s skin in the best way.
Steve nods and he places his hand over Tony’s. There’s a hint of a smile on his lips when Tony takes his hand and squeezes it. With Steve in a better mood, Tony decides to take the plunge and ask Steve about yesterday.
Steve curls up with his mate, eyes transfixed on the ring on his finger. He had been afraid of marriage and the changes it would bring. He was content just being bonded, but now as he pictures the ceremony and having their friends celebrate their love, he’s excited to get married.
Tony sighs harshly and turns toward his daughter. “How about we work on it tomorrow? We can do that, right? No work or Spider-Man stuff. Promise.”
Anyway I hope you all enjoy this update! :)
Steve winces and gives Tony back his phone. “I’ll go deal with that. Let me know what Pepper says.”
“We’ll have our hands full.”
Sleep doesn’t come like he had hoped. His mind is swimming with thoughts of Tony and there’s the sudden urge to reach out to him. He’s not sure what good that would do. Clearly Tony didn’t want to talk to him. He wouldn’t be so distant if he did.
“No. I just need you to pick up a few things. I don’t have any clothes for him and he can’t wear what he’s wearing now. Just grab a few things for him.”
“We’ll be back in New York soon. Get some rest,” the alpha orders, then he leaves the room.
“It’s insane! How did you not even know! Ow!” Clint cries out when Natasha smacks him upside the head.
“Nothing.” Tony’s smile grows brighter. “I love seeing you like this. You’re so good with our son and I honestly couldn’t have asked for a better person to have a family with. You’re the right partner for me too.”
“Tony?” Natasha says again, her tone laced with concern. “What happened?”
