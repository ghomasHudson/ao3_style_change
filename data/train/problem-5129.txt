“Because you and I share the same goal,” Rhodey smirked before growing serious, “I’m sure you heard what will happen to Tony by the end of the year.”
He sat there, finishing his first cup. The trash can was not far, so he threw it… and missed, hitting a buff blonde guy. There was something familiar about the guy…
“Just because you have assimilated into life here, doesn’t mean you’ll be here forever! There’s a three month expiration date!” Bucky snapped.
“There’s no need to- Greg?” Holy shit. the man was gorgeous. Perfect jaw, clear ocean eyes, bright blonde hair. He looked like an Ancient Greek god. An Adonis angel coming down from the heavens. Tony hoped he wasn’t drooling.
His scream echoed throughout the altar and the others in attendance muttered softly, disapprovingly amongst themselves. Tony looked around him, eyes wide, seeing all the people sitting in the pews and he screamed again. They all looked horrible, disfigured, ugly. Some of them, his brain couldn’t even comprehend what they looked like. He kneeled down, holding his head in his hands. This couldn’t be happening.
Even though the Bucky guy still looked angry, he listened to what Steve said, something that impressed Rhodey greatly.
Ok, that was a lie. He wasn’t exactly happy. He yearned for Tony, burned for him. Steve dated around but he never found anyone like Tony.
“Exactly!” Sharon said with a gorgeous smile, “I’ll leave you in James’ care, sounds like the school rush is here.”
“Not by choice,” Iron man said quietly, “but I’ve seen the shrine the Starks have built for you. It’s…”
It wasn’t Peter’s handwriting. Tony smiled to himself. Maybe Peter was making friends after all. Some kid in the neighborhood that Tony didn’t know. He’ll have to ask Peter when he came back home, but Tony didn’t have time to ruminate over such things. He had to get to work or he could get told off for being late again.
“No, I’m alright,” Tony said softly, even though his coat was soaked through with ocean water. He looked about the room, eyes wide as he took in the sight of white roses- his mother’s favorite flower- scattered about. It seemed like there was some kind of ceremony going on at the moment, “sorry if I’m intruding on anything.”
This dom, this Rogers, had thrown his privilege of being a dom away and was convicted of something to land him in this prison. Why? Why would he ever do that?
“Like Clint said, Iron man is Anthony Stark’s bodyguard. If he didn’t prove himself in the field, I would have also questioned his intentions to help us,” Reed said with a small sigh.
“I know who you are,” Tony chewed out, cursing his brother for putting him in this situation, “I should go-“
His eyes were not deceiving him. A tiny red and black fly flew over him. It was woman shaped. It had a woman’s voice. It had insect wings. It was the strangest sight he’d ever witnessed. Stranger still were the men and what looked like a red and gold metallic robot standing off to the side. Steve stared for a long time; the sight before him too peculiar to ignore.
He had been living with his parents and, while his mom doted on Peter, his father would point out all the mistakes Tony made when he raised his son. His father didn’t even like to look at Peter, reminded that his stupid son adopted a child rather than going for the normal nuclear family option.
“I was… betrothed to my godfather, the moment my designation was shown,” Tony said quietly, “my father was not pleased to find out his only was a sub, you see, so he was quick to find a dom for me. He didn’t want any doms knocking on our door to ask my hand in marriage. Nor did he want any doms to force me to submit and steal the company away from him. So he chose his business partner.”
The dom took his time rinsing out his mouth before he stepped towards Tony like a lion stalking it’s prey.
Tony saw the stars shining in the sky smile down at him, he felt the waves of the ocean cradle him and cuddle him close. Who wouldn’t want to marry the sky and sea? To have someone love him? He smiled softly, serene, “I do.”
In the midst of the chaos, Rhodey realized that Rogers wasn’t really fighting back, he was just taking the hits, “why aren’t you fighting back? You scared, Rogers?”
The two brothers would be combined. Gregory at the forefront, while Tony tagged behind. It worked, for the most part. Tony was left to his own devices while Gregory would take the glory and the fame. Tony was ok with this.
Steve laughed along with Tony, but his heart sank at Tony’s words. Because that was exactly what he was doing, subconscious of it or not. Steve felt the cracks in his heart begin to form. It was only so long before Tony found out his true intentions.
“I was always… selfish before I met your brother. I wanted to further my career rather than stay at home and start a family. Your brother-“ Tony fumbled with his T-shirt, “he taught me how wrong that thinking was. How omegas were made for a home life. For family. We’re not supposed to be getting frivolous things like careers.”
“Ransom sacrificed a lot when he married me. He sacrificed rising in the army, he sacrificed his dreams of going abroad to fight for our country, he sacrificed a lot. It’s only reasonable that I do the same,” Tony said. It sounded like he repeated this sentiment many times to himself over the years.
Peter looked blearily up at him with wide tearful eyes and Tony’s heart broke, “can I not go today? I feel sick.”
“I love it, Steve, thank you,” Tony said. He turned to hug Steve. Steve felt almost complete with Tony in his arms.
“Steve! What are you doing?! You’re not going to make it!” Peggy’s voice was but a whisper that Steve had to decipher in the roar of the beeping signals and racing wind.
“Please,” Tony rolled his eyes, “as if any man would dare look at me when I have you breathing down my neck.”
This- this was all so surreal. He couldn’t believe what was happening. His eyes lowered half lidded. There was something in the air, something stifling like clouds out of a dream. He stepped, tripping at steps he couldn’t see, when he felt something- someone catch his fall. With the help of the foreign hand in his, he was guided up the stairs and towards the altar.
Peter let out a pitiful cough that Tony saw through immediately, but… “aright. Since it’s your birthday, I’ll let you stay at home. But you better be ready to go to school tomorrow,” he said, kissing the top of Peter’s head.
“Spot any cute omegas, Stevie?” Bucky asked, waggling his eyebrows at a cute omega girl and guy sitting at a table. They giggled at his antics.
“Because people are always trying to get something out of Tony Stark,” Rhodey sighed, “even if it’s for his own good.”
Tony giggled, swaying on his feet side by side until a gentle hand guided him back. Tony was barely aware of his surroundings, filled with a floaty feeling like that one time when he was nine and had gotten into his father’s liquor cabinet. He smiled serenely at the memory, right as the veil was peeled away.
“Uh- uh huh,” Tony whimpered. He couldn’t even say words. Everything just felt so good. Nothing like- nothing like before.
“You… bulldozed half of the continent to get your best friend back,” Tony recited softly, hugging himself. He heard this tale from his father.
Tony never felt comfortable crying in front of anyone, but he knew Rhodey would never judge. Rhodey hated Tony’s situation and would change it in a heartbeat. But it was already set in stone. Rhodey knew that Tony would rather die than give up his freedom, which was why he monitored his best friend as much as possible during this last year. It fucking sucked because it felt like he was monitoring Tony’s last days of freedom. Because once Tony was in Obi’s clutches, he’d never be free again.
Rogers did nothing, continuing with how he acted before this whole debacle. Thankfully, Tony was only harassed minutely. What the dark haired dom did to Arron was enough to deter any other doms from doing the same.
Tony paid using a slick black credit card, a snide smile on his face as he went over to wait for his drink. He dropped a crisp 5 dollar bill into the tip jar as he went.
Steve found Tony just sitting at the kitchen table, just… waiting. Not even watching the television playing. He looked… sad.
After a while of small orders which Tony could handle, Bucky turned to him, “I’m going to take care of customer support and clean the handle and outside tables, can you handle things here on your own?”
Greg was untouchable, so the ten rings went for Tony. No one knew he was kidnapped. No one gave a damn except for Tony’s best friend, Rhodey.
Steve peeled out slowly until he was all the way out before ramming back in. Tony keened, head thrown back in pleasure, “more. Harder. Please, please-“
The next couple of weeks, Steve would spend every extra paycheck to buy more toys for Tony to play with. He got addicted to the way Tony’s face lit up with each new gift he found while the children were away. And when the children came back, they would have family time together. It almost felt like Steve was their father, not Ransom.
“Oh, honey, don’t worry about that. I’ll be back before you know it,” Ransom picked up his youngest and kissed her on the crown of her head.
When he returned, Tony wasn’t sitting in the kitchen anymore. He was almost grateful. He was sure that if he saw Tony, all those angry feelings would resurface.
Tony didn’t need to be told twice, he tore through the second one so fast, he gave himself a stomach ache. He felt bloated and sick, sweating profusely. But he didn’t think too hard about it. He turned around and lay on the bed, unable to move.
Tony looked up in those crystal blue earnest eyes and- Fuck. He couldn’t say no to a pretty man. Ty was the proof of that.
After he was done, Sharon brought in a young dark haired man named James. There was something familiar about him, in his sharp blue eyes, his dark brown hair- but Tony couldn’t quite put a finger on it.
He wanted to cry. He wanted to scream. He wanted to run and hide from the world. But his body froze, knowing that if he broke the rules, he would suffer a harsh punishment.
Rogers smirked, tearing off his own clothes, muscles rippling. Tony couldn’t help but be caught in the sight like a deer in headlights. Obadiah was not an attractive man, far from it, but Rogers… he was a specimen of human perfection. When Rogers caught Tony watching, Tony lifted his chin up in defiance. Roger smirked.
“It was when he started inviting others into our bed that I began to protest. The first time I brought it up to him, he beat me so hard I was in bed for weeks. Afterwards…” Tony swallowed, “he said he was sorry. He gave me things. Pretty things he thought I would like. As a way of apologizing. I knew he didn’t mean it.”
“Doesn’t mean I can’t tease him into submission, honeycakes,” Bucky kissed Nat until she smiled and laughed, “sorry, Stevie, can I have a tall skinny espresso with nonfat milk. Gotta watch the weight.”
The next morning, he awoke early to find Rogers gone. What if… no, Tony shook his head. Whenever he grew curious, his mind wandered into dangerous territory… but the conversation from the night before called things into question.
Sure, Greg was intriguing. Dark hair, handsome eyes, sharp words. Steve couldn’t help but be smitten by him at first sight. Billionaire, genius, playboy, philanthropist, Gregory Stark seemed to have it all. But there was something that he was missing. The way he made Thor shot through that portal, saving earth. Something that made his report read “Iron man yes, Greg Stark not recommended.”
“You’re in luck,” A gentle hand held his face up, cool blues looking into dull browns, “I would not share a sub as pretty as you with anyone.”
“Why are you crying, love?” Steve asked, peeling a stray sweaty hair out of Tony’s face, stroking his lover’s cheek.
A frown weakened Tony’s smile. Ever since they moved, Peter had been struggling. It was made worse when he somehow got the attention of bullies. Tony couldn’t help feeling guilty. There was nothing he could do. Not talking to the teachers, not to the principal, nothing helped. Peter missed the old house they lived in.
“I am, but what I’m saying is the truth. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry I hurt you. It was never my intention to let you know,” Steve let the tears fall, voice cracking, “you can hate me. You can tell Ransom. I don’t know- can tell me to leave and I’ll never come back. I just wanted you to know why I did what I did. Because I couldn’t bear the thought of you thinking I’d intentionally hurt you. I love you. I love your brilliant mind. I love your children. I love how you get this soft expression whenever you tinker with your gadgets. I love-“
“Oh he’s fiery. I bet he’s a real treat in bed,” the dom leered, “I’m sure Rogers wouldn’t mind if I had a go at him.”
“I don’t think that’s important,” Iron man grouched, “we should be glad that the Stark’s kept Captain America’s history alive.”
“It’s out of my hands, Tony,” his shitty defense lawyer said, “you plead guilty. That’s what the judge decreed. I’m sorry.”
“Get your things and get out. I won’t say it again, Steve,” Tony said, voice calm as he held himself.
do things to him. The clock next to their cell clicked down the time before something happened. He sighed softly, waiting for dawn to break.
“If- if something happens to me, I need to know that Tony would be in good hands,” Ransom said, “can I trust you, Steve?”
The dom huffed but did nothing. Tony waited. He waited until the dom’s breathing relaxed and evened out. Then and only then, did he allow the tears to spill.
“Then you have to call me, Steve,” Steve said, before saying a little shyly, “I’ve actually liked Tony Stark for years… but… I never really thought I had the chance with him. I’m just a guy from lower Brooklyn. Not the dating type.”
“I guess this is the wrong time to come in,” Jan said as she walked in with a bundle of plain bland clothes.
He then turned to Tony, Tony who was looking at Ransom like he hung up the moon and stars and all the planets.
“No… no one… I couldn’t…” Tony sighed, “after I came back… I found out my godfather was selling Stark weapons behind our back and I- it was my fault… I trusted him more than Greg-“
Tony's gaze was blank and uninterested. Steve didn't know why it hit him hard all over again: Everything that made Tony up was gone.
Even now, seventy years and a whole new world later, Steve was a little ashamed to admit he screamed his head off in the vita-ray machine.
Steve turned towards the oncoming Slender Man and flicked on his flashlight. Even though it was afternoon, the weak light blasted a hole through the creature's torso. The Slender Man wailed, its arms flailing. A second beam of light joined the first, and with another haunting cry, the Slender Man melted to rejoin regular shadows.
Steve convinced himself he'd give it a few days before he brought the subject of the living will to the rest of the team. Surely in the meantime someone would discover a promising lead, or maybe Amora would show up, or Tony would blink fully back awake and alert, having found a way to fight past the blocks in his mind.
"Malone said the spectres are only dangerous to adults, and children over puberty. She will be working with SHIELD researchers, but it sounds like the best offence is avoidance."
Strange's eyes flashed in indignation, as if he'd picked up the unspoken words. "Indeed, I am well versed in Asgardian brand of magic, although I lack the tools to replicate the results. All magic, Asgardian, Terran, Wiccan, leaves traces. I can assure you that he," Strange pointed a long finger at the uncaring Tony, "is without."
The old man folded his legs and sat across the fire from Steve. His daemon came to rest on his shoulder.
Again, Parry exchanged glances with Malone. She nodded and spoke, "Doctor Banner, you know my research focuses on elementary particles within dark matter. What I never told -- well, I could never publish
The shield would do nothing, he knew, but he still felt stupid waving the little piece of shrapnel around. But the spectres shrank from it as if it were deadly acid. Steve was reminded again of the strange shadow creatures that the Avengers had fought the day that Tony had fallen.
To his surprise, Pepper reached out and clasped his hand. Her own fingers were cold. "I've been going through this in my head over and over. I... I'm willing to ignore certain provisions of the living will, for now, but if this continues on, we're going to have to think of something else. You're the leader of the team, but right now he's not an Avenger. Steve... he's barely alive."
Tony drew one ragged breath after another, slumping back unselfconsciously against Steve. Releasing his wrists, Steve touched under Tony's chin to bring his head around, tried to look in his eyes. "Are you with me, Iron Man?" he asked half-hopefully. Maybe now...
Strange turned to him, one eyebrow raised. "My dear boy," and Steve tried and failed not to bristle at that, "SHIELD furnished me with the video of the events, and I have watched it myself. What that so-called enchantress was doing," he flicked his wrists in a decent imitation of Amora, "is not a magical movement."
Will smiled wryly. "This is a shard of a dangerous weapon — perhaps, one of the most dangerous in this or any other world.”
"Thank you," Steve made himself say. Disappointment clogged his throat. "Dr. Banner is researching it right now. I'm sure he would be grateful for any assistance."
"Let's go back to these other worlds," Bruce said. His voice was very mild in the way it got only when he was putting a tight lid on his emotions. "I get the impression you're not talking about planets, like Asgard. You mean the many-worlds theory, don't you?"
"But there is still a link between Tony and his daemon," Kirjava said, unexpectedly. "It isn't broken, but strained. There may be a way to heal it, if we get her back in time."
Worse, later that day there was a call to assemble. Steve would have given anything to finally knock some answers out of Amora, but it was only rogue AIM bots causing minor subway damage. Bruce had stayed behind to oversee more of Tony's medical tests in case his change of behavior meant something that could finally be detected.
"He'll be fine," Natasha said, and smoothly took Steve's own arm, guiding him out and down the hall. He got the distinct impression they were separating them.
"I'm sorry," Bruce croaked. "I hired those doctors to consult, and they'd come highly recommended, but..." he shook his head. "This is... this is my fault."
“It’s just a few miles,” Tony said. “A walk in the park. And we’ll all be waiting on the other side for you.” He gestured to Riri and Grace.
Tony's gaze was empty and unfocused, but he exhaled in a sudden, stuttering breath. Then another. The heart monitor picked up pace.
"Maybe we'll make it a double-date," Steve said, just to see Bucky smirk, remembering other disastrous double-dates.
Steve nodded, and there was an awkward pause, a beat of silence where Steve knew Bruce wanted to talk about the giant elephant in the room. The fact that Amora had done this to Tony because Steve.... because Steve hadn't been able to control himself.
The doctors were talking idly about the possibility of a stroke, and several more tests they'd like to run. One mentioned having good results with electroconvulsive therapy in other catatonic patients, another replied that Tony's medical proxy would never allow it. The camera zoomed in on Tony's face, his empty expression. Then the video cut out.
Soon, they'd passed through the bulk of the city and were trundling along a road to the greater forest.
"We're here regarding Mr. Stark's situation," Parry said, "I admit I was alarmed when I watched the video -- I've seen something very similar before."
With his eidetic memory, Steve only needed to watch the video once. He felt so sick he had to leave the room.
The corners of his Bruce's mouth drooped down. "Steve, he flailed and his hand hit the panel to open the outer door. There wasn't much of a change, other than--"
"Sir," Jarvis said, his voice penetrating through several deep layers of sleep. Steve jerked and sat up, feeling the plush couch under him try to suck him back down. Honestly, if sleeping on modern mattresses were like marshmallows, this was that marshmallow fluff Clint had once tried to get him to taste.
Luckily, Will seem to understand what he could not say. "There are ways to separate yourself from your daemon. They are not pleasant."
Thor shook his head. "He decreed Anthony was not to be seen by the palace healers, but there are others, wise men and women who speak to their
This earned a dismissive look from the old man. "Of course not. Do I look like a cat person to you, boy?" But before Steve could respond, the wise man pointed a gnarled finger at Tony. "You are correct, Odinson. Your companion is missing his daemon, and without it he will never be whole again. Furthermore, my Astrid tells me his body weakens. He has days left, perhaps a week."
"Thor may be able to tell us more about Amora," Steve said a touch too loudly. "When he gets here--"
He knew what Bucky was getting around to, and decided to cut him off at the pass. "You're like a brother to me, Buck. Always have been."
Steve stared at his beer. His throat felt thick, and he knew he didn't deserve a friend like Bucky. Never had.
Parry nodded. He looked grim. "I traveled as a young man -- there were holes, doorways to other worlds. They've been since sealed, the way to make them destroyed. But in one of these worlds there was a creature, a spectre, that fed off the daemons of adults, and left them exactly like this. Everything that made them the person they were, gone."
Steve reached up to rub between his eyes. He didn't get headaches anymore, not since the serum, but sometimes he still got the feeling one was building up when he was stressed.
Before he could say anything, Thor bent close to Steve and spoke in an undertone, "That is no true animal -- it cannot touch or harm Anthony, or anyone else."
The impressions Steve got through the energy curtain was of a clean city and a wealthy, healthy population. Their chariot drew some glances, but not enough to raise suspicion.
The video was a little shaky, obviously taken from a hand-held camera or cell phone.  It was of Tony, who was dressed in a simple hospital gown, his bare legs poking out the bottom. He stood perfectly still and vacant as several men in different lab coats moved one of his arms to hold out straight, testing his reflexes. "No response," someone said out of view.
"Do you know where you are?" Steve prompted, then added, "Remember when I called it a big ugly building?"
Bruce rubbed a hand down his face, looking, if anything, more exhausted. "Let me guess: they have a cure?"
The mattress dipped slightly. Steve glanced up to see the cat had joined them on the bed -- he'd had forgotten all about it.
"We used to watch the bald eagles nest over the Brooklyn Bridge, remember?" his daemon said. "Remember that time Bucky was playing rough, and we fell off the pier? I became a striper fish until Buck jumped in after to get us, but I always liked flying better. Even when we couldn't breathe right, we could fly."
Steve's breath caught, and even Tony seemed to pause. There was a moment of stillness. Then Tony tilted the Iron Man helmet to look down at himself, then back up at Amora. "Is something supposed to happen, here, lady?"
Finally, with a gasp like a man drowning, Tony went limp against Steve. Exhausted and gray and blank.
"Yes. I will take away what you love most of all. Just as this puny realm has taken my dearest heart from me. What--no,
"Steve," Bruce said quietly, at Steve's shoulder. He turned, and Bruce gestured him to a more private corner of the room. Stress was lining his eyes even more deeply -- he looked tired, having worked harder than anyone else on the team to find an answer for Tony. "I know you're hoping to find a cure in Asgard." Bruce sighed. "And I admit, Malone's research is compelling. Just... don't pin all your hopes to this."
"There are restoratives to wake a sleeper, to sharpen the mind, but Anthony is awake and as you know his mind is always sharp." Again, Thor shook his head. "I have never seen the like. Truly, I am sorry, Steven."
For lack of anything else to do, Steve directed him to lay down on the bed, and then pulled his covers up to his chin. He doubted Tony was sleepy, having just got out of a hospital bed, but... what else could he do?
They'd hooked Tony up to an saline drip, but that had been awhile ago, and Tony had fought an entire battle before that. Steve had directed him to drink once -- had held a water cup to his lips. Tony swallowed the first gulp, but the rest had run out his mouth and down his chin. Feeling vaguely embarrassed, Steve hadn't tried again.
By the time a week had passed, Bruce started throwing around words like, "Very high level vegetative state" and the neurologists were repeating tests they'd done earlier in the week with no success. All Tony's brain scans came up perfectly normal.
"Iron Man, report!" Steve ordered. If Tony was unconscious, JARVIS should have taken over the suit and brought him down to ground level. There were safeguards in place.
"I do." Steve glanced around the room; at Bucky and Natasha, and Clint and Thor, who were gathered, speaking together. His whole team, except Tony. They'd just been told half were leaving the planet, and the other half might be facing unfightable horrors, but there was nothing but determination and purpose in all of their faces. Something stirred in his chest -- pride, love.... heck, maybe it was his daemon.  "Call it faith."
Amora smirked. "Know this, Steven Grant Rogers," her voice was thick with malice, "his suffering is your doing." Then she closed her fist.
The bald eagle regarded her for a moment. "Grace," she replied in a bright, surprisingly pleasant voice. "Our Ma always said that was to be our name, if Steve had been born a girl."
The line from his heart led to what Steve thought was a vast mountain range, but what Thor said was an illusion. He set Steve down at the base of the mountains, spun up the hammer until lightning crackled all around, and brought it down. At once, it was as if an invisible shell in the air cracked.
"It's not a cat," he said in surprise, glancing down at Kirjava, who had curled up in Parry's lap and watched the proceedings with interest.
Two nurses were now going to be hired for full time supervision. Tony wasn't going to be left alone again. He shouldn't have been in the first place. Steve was supposed to be a tactician, but he'd never helped arrange care for another person before.
"Sometimes catatonia patients can suffer exhaustion," Parry said. "And that trip through the Bifrost was... taxing," He frowned at the long road to Asgard. "I suppose we cannot just wait here."
Bucky, of course, noticed his distraction, swore at him, and told him to go home. "We got this, Steve. Get your tail outta here."
"No, don't tell me from here!" The man tapped his head, then moved his hand down to press over his own heart. "Tell me from here."
"Steve," Bruce said, "this was a warning sign. We're all doing our best, but we aren't equipped to take care of him long-term like he needs. Being here just isn't safe for Tony."
Steve frowned, barely understanding. "But… his daemon?" He looked from Will to the wise man and back again. Now that he had Grace — that he knew of her — he also knew, instinctively, that they could not stand to be parted a long distance. “If she is with Amora…”
"Daemon. Not evil," Parry's smile was sympathetic. "There isn't a proper word in English -- in this universe, really -- to fully explain. Consciousness, or soul comes close, but not quite."
Will found Steve and his daemon sitting outside of the blind wise man’s hut, staring to the horizon.
Tony was asleep, looking pale and haggard, but he opened his eyes when Steve gently shook his shoulder, and walked dully through the door. Parry and Kirjava followed.
A couple of the nurses had backed away, giving Steve a view. Tony was out cold, with vicious self-made claw marks down his throat and chest. The nurses were securing his wrists with velcro straps to either side of the bed.
"I came as soon as I heard," Thor said gravely, and strode over to the hospital bed. He gently turned Tony's chin to face him and took in his unnatural quiet, his blank expression. Thor frowned.  "I am sorry to see you brought so low, Man of Iron. I would have never expected this of Amora, even with her faults."
Perry was a quiet fellow, not prone to idol chatter, only commenting occasionally on things outside and then, in quieter tones, to his daemon. Steve was much the same way -- he would have given anything for Tony to fill in the blank, quiet spaces.
Bruce hesitated for a long, long moment. He'd been standing off to the side, looking vaguely pained. "It's... all a little unbelievable, to be honest, and this is coming from, well, me." He sighed. "Doctor Malone has been upfront with her research, but she has decades of data on dark matter -- what she calls shadow particles. I can't begin to sift through it in only a couple hours."
Steve hesitated for a long moment and then nodded. His bald eagle daemon bent to pick at a flyaway hair on top of his head. It seemed to be a soothing gesture.
He landed, unbuckled Tony from his seat. Then, with one hand on his shoulder, he guided Tony down the quinjet's ramp and onto the Iron Man launch pad. Steve watched him carefully, but Tony's eyes were empty; staring ahead, seeing but unseeing as the high wind at the top of the tower whipped at his hair.
It was just about the last thing Steve wanted to do, and he felt his cheeks heating in a blush, but this was for Tony's sake. So he nodded and retook his seat, gesturing for Thor to pull up another chair, and made himself recount what had happened. All the ugly truth of it.
"Well, I suppose when one is in Rome..." Parry muttered to himself, and boarded. Steve couldn't help but agree.
Thor nodded solemnly. "We've come seeking wisdom to learn how to return the daemon, and mend what has been broken."
Tony drew back, then, and although he was clearly not physically back to one-hundred-percent, his eyes were bright with unshed tears.
Steve could have laughed, if he didn't feel so much like crying. For finding a part of himself he never knew was missing. For never being alone again. For knowing what Tony had lost.
"She could try." He didn't think it was his imagination. The air seemed to crackle with sudden electricity. "But Mjölnir would strike her from the sky within a moment. "But she said she would gain strength from Anthony's suffering? From his blood, yes. There are such dark magics. But this? I know not."
"I'll pick out something from your closet. The cranberry silk is your favorite, I think?" Pepper said.
Steve wanted to quip something back, but all he could do was pull the other man in his arms, drawing him close to his heart.
"You left me behind," the daemon corrected, with more than a hint of annoyance, "back on the shore. I hadn't known I existed until then, you see."
The sound cut Steve right down to the bone; Tony's pain, confusion, overlaid by soul-grating terror.
Steve wondered if this was going to hurt, but dismissed it a moment later. He was strong, he could take it. He'd been in and out of the vita-ray machine, after all.
Steve glanced at Tony, who hadn't reacted to the news at all. "I don't think Tony's able to play silent even if he ever wanted to."
She held up her hand. "I know. None of the directives technically falls within the perimeters established, which gives me some wiggle room."
The Avengers learned the hard way that Tony needed to be led to the bathroom. Once there, he'd do his business by himself, if there was a need. But after it was taken care of, Tony would stand before the toilet, blank and unmoving until he was led somewhere else. Meals were similar. When coaxed, he usually ate a bite or two of something in front of him, but that was it. Not enough to sustain him.
Natasha broke into a nearby gas station, and "borrowed" a pack of flashlights and some spare AA batteries. Then they were in business.
Will gave him a sad smile. "Of course I will. I did not say I was leaving completely. Nor that I would not help."
The Asgardian sky was nothing like Steve had ever seen before. Hundreds, thousands, millions of stars crusted the black and purple sky, and what he could only assume was the Milky Way galaxy. For a moment, all Steve could do was stare. The road under his feet was a pulsing rainbow hued glass, leading off miles away to a crystalline city. It was... alien. Gorgeous. His fingers itched to grab up pencil and pen.
"Daemons are usually the opposite gender of the body," Parry said. "Something poetic about ying and yang, I suppose."
And, like she'd done it all his life, his daemon reached over with a wickedly curved beak to gently nudge away a long bit of his hair that had fallen across his eyes.
Steve looked around at Parry and Thor, but maybe the smoke was doing a number on him because for the life of him he couldn't read their expressions. "I... Amora asked me to choose," he said, skipping ahead.
thought of it anyway. Just like that Ghostbusters movie he saw a few weeks ago; the one Tony had been so excited to make Steve watch. But Tony had come off a forty-eight hour straight shot in his lab. He'd fallen asleep halfway through, his legs stretched over Steve's lap. Everywhere he'd touched had been warm, and Steve had been too distracted to pay much attention to the movie, trying not to move, wondering if he should wake him, if he should do more than rest his hand on Tony's leg, if the increasingly frequent, casual touches meant anything at all--
By the forth day, everyone save Bucky and Steve, thanks to their healing factor, were sporting bruises from being kicked or struck.
He raised his eyebrows. "Truly?  We had not spoken since we were children. Against my mother's direct command, she sought the means and power to enchant others. When her deeds were found out, she was cast to the Other Lands."
Parry and Steve exchanged a look, a shrug, then started walking down the rainbow road. No doubt Thor would not take long, but there was no reason they couldn't shorten the distance a little with their own two feet.
"The thing is," Bucky said, derailing that train of thought, "You gave me a chance -- you believed in me when no one in their right mind would have. I know I'm not 100%, Stevie, I probably won't ever be again. But I'm a damn sight better than I was."
Yeah, so that happened. *hides* Tags will be changing soon to reflect that this is a story with daemons -- it's been hard to keep this under wraps.
Back in the war, Bucky had been his second in command for good reason. Steve had trusted him to make solid field decisions then -- to pull men he thought too sick or injured to keep fighting. It had never happened to Steve, but there was a first time for everything.
Grace was accepting of it, and in some ways looked forward to flying freely—a big eagle body was cumbersome when she couldn’t fly more than a few dozen yards from Steve at a time. But now that the moment was at hand, they both felt nervous.
“Mr. Rogers- me- sir- I’ve wanted this for so long and I just- I don’t think I can give that opportunity up,” Steve almost cries.
Thanos is on his knees, Tony has a wild, confused look on his face, and all the alien troops around them are breaking down and being swept away by the wind. They’ve just won.
“He isn’t a whole man. He makes a choice, and that choice falls like a domino. He isn’t there when people need him. Some nasty things happen, kid. With the team, with everyone. And it was like this every time he was there, and you weren’t.”
Steve looks at him, stops himself before he can ask ‘How do you know that?’ and realizes why he’s here, who this is.
“You think that leaving the past behind you is the worst thing that will ever happen. That living with the present makes you want to just go back. But that is something different that you can’t understand why you don’t want without living the life I did.”
Steve had been walking down the hall towards his room, worn out from keeping watch over Tony (he'd had several fits that night and Steve hadn't gotten any sleep) when the elevator opened behind him.
If Tony were truly here, he would not Steve to put himself in danger, would have gone in all barbed wit and sarcasm, and in that moment Steve wanted him back so much it was like a physical ache.
"Physically, he's healthy," Bruce confirmed tiredly. "So far every test has put him within the normal range."
Tony was more than happy to comply. Closing his eyes, Steve let himself sink into the taste of him, his touch. Three months in and they were still very much in the honeymoon period, but Steve knew they were building something that would last.
Wordlessly, Natasha came over, kissed his cheek, and wrapped her arms around his shoulders. Bruce sagged against her briefly, as if his strings were cut. But when he straightened again and faced Steve, the look in his eyes were terrible. Foreboding. As if readying himself to be struck down.
Thor, holding the reins at the head of the chariot, had a proud smile on his face. His smile slipped when he saw Tony unconscious in Steve's arms. He pulled the goats up to a stop and gestured. "Quickly! Sif and the Warriors Three have agreed to provide a distraction for the palace guards. These are my finest racing goats, but still we haven't much time to avoid notice."
Pepper thumbed through a few papers in the binder she was carrying, but then sighed and placed it down on the table. "There are quite a few advance directives, but they all come to the same thing. He has do-not-resuscitate, and do-not-extend his life orders in almost every instance."
Will and Thor shook their heads, but the wise man beamed. “Now, with your eagle’s eyes, you see the connection. It will not last for long," the wise man added, “so I suggest you hurry."
Steve took the pliers and held the piece up to his eyes. There was something… very wrong with the edge as if he could not quite see even with his enhanced vision where the edge of the knife stopped and the air began. "What does it do?"
The cat paid him no mind. It stared at Tony in an intelligent, searching way that wasn't very cat-like at all. Then the cat turned to Parry and said quite clearly, "Did you see it, too?"
"Then who else was witness?" He shook his head, again, not awaiting their answer. "You ask my wisdom, and I have given it."
"They yanked her out, tore her away from him." Strong claws dug into Steve's shoulder. "She was fighting, and fighting, and trying to get back to Tony." And Steve could see it, too, a form he couldn't quite make out, caged in by spectres. "We should have done something."
There is life in Tony's eyes again and he smiled again in a quick flash, self-deprecating fashion. "I have it on good authority," he said, “that the last few weeks have been kind of weird."
Grace held onto his shoulders, head bowed to the wind. Her strong talons and streamlined feathery body more than capable of holding on.
"We weren't--I never told him how I, you know..." Steve trailed off, staring at the beer in his hands, "... felt."
As Steve watched, perplexed, John snapped open the casing of glass and carefully, very carefully, handed the pliers to him.
But Tony was almost deathly silent in his sleeping bag, and at that moment Steve would have given anything in his power to see him up and 'Jonesing' (as Clint would put it) for a computer.
"Sir, I'm afraid Mr. Stark's respiratory and blood pressure levels are increasing beyond normal limits."
Steve hesitated. It was a delicate subject, but the sooner he got answers the sooner they could find a cure for Tony. "She said you were her beloved."
"I have. He made his wishes very clear. Steve." She sighed and raised a hand to massage over her right eye. "Howard was killed instantly in that car accident, but his mother lingered for more than a week, kept alive by machines. He told me that was no way to live, no way he wanted to live--"
"I'm sorry, Captain," JARVIS almost sounded like it, too. "Doctor Banner has engaged the emergency protocols. I cannot open the door."
The nurse rubbed a dot of alcohol on Tony's inner elbow. There were already several other marks from that day. "Doctors requested another blood sample to compare against the previous readings."
Tony took one look at the vast, barren desert over the rim of his sunglasses and wrinkled his nose in distaste. “Not my idea of a relaxing vacation, Cap.”
Tony made no reaction, but did as he was directed when the nurse took his arm and tugged him upright. He stared straight ahead, blank and incurious.
At this, Bruce hesitated. "It... appears that way. We've called Thor in, and SHIELD has a few magical consultants they still trust on file. A doctor, uh, Strange, is scheduled to see him tomorrow."
Steve didn't know what to do. Despair was like a wild thing in his chest. He wanted to shake Tony until he snapped out of this. If he had enough presence of mind to get himself outside and stand on the ledge, it meant there
Steve used to come down and watch the two of them, heads bent together over an open panel on Bucky's arm. It had never failed to warm him inside: His best friend and his--and
"Thor, hi. " Steve rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly and glanced towards Tony who was sitting up, vacantly staring out the room's single window. Steve had directed his attention there an hour ago. What he was staring at, if anything, Steve couldn't guess. He hadn't so much as flinched at Thor's arrival.
Steve twisted, shield at the ready, to see yet another flat shadow-like... thing approach from the side. The shadow creatures had been downright spooky at first. (Tony and Clint had called them Slender Men in matching tones of horror. It fit, them being tall and thin beings made of pure shadow, except for their dazzling backlit eyes.)
Tony reached over and grabbed Steve’s wrist, checking for what felt like the hundredth time that the specialized wrist-watch was still functioning. Of course it was. It was of his design. Making sure the eagle was watching, Tony tapped it. “This will send out a distress signal if he gets into trouble. I’ll go in and grab him faster than you can say, ‘Man with the plan’.”
Once he was well, there was a very good chance Tony wouldn't want to have anything to do with Steve... and Steve... he wouldn't blame him. Not one bit.
He shifted, Tony's head pillowed on the top of his bicep. "He would hate this," Steve said as he started forward. He felt a lump grow in his throat, and forced himself to swallow past it. "Tony, I mean. Being carried -- being cared for. He's so self-sufficient."
Tony had no sooner sat than something flitted out of the shadows, small and dark: A bat that flew crazily around Tony's head before returning to the old man, landing at his chest and hooking its claws into the bone-toothed necklace. It crawled its way up to the man's shoulder and seemed to whisper something into his ear.
And then he'd be like Tony, or worse. He looked at Parry. "But you said Malone can hide her daemon. I didn't see it in the tower."
Later, the vid feeds showed that it had been another fit that had driven Tony outside. The nurse who had been watching him had gone on her hour lunch break -- leaving him alone. This was standard, as Tony didn't move at all until someone directed him.
He touched Tony's wrist to count his pulse -- Parry's little and ring fingers were missing on his left hand -- then he gently moved Tony to sit up. Parry asked Bruce a couple questions about Tony's reflexes. Then he stared into Tony's blank eyes for a long moment before he looked away and shook his head at Doctor Malone, his lips pinched.
They came to a small, dome-shaped home at the end of the main lane. It was smaller than all the rest, set low to the ground. A trail of smoke drifted from the top, and there were tufts of grass growing out of the thatch.
"It's why they call me one of the best snipers in the world," Bucky added dryly, at Steve's side. It wasn't his first outing with the Avengers, but he was still fresh enough to be a little nervous going in. Not that he'd said anything, but Steve could tell. Now, though, Bucky carried his flashlight with ease. He winked at Steve and pretended to blow off the top of the flashlight as if it were a smoking gun.
It was quiet in the tent -- so quiet.  Steve stared at the canopy ceiling overhead and imagined what it were be like if Tony were well. Tony wasn't the camping type. Being without computers or an electronic device would drive him up the wall, and as a result he'd annoy everyone around him to distraction.
Dr. Parry was much more composed. He crossed to the other side of the bed. "Hello, Mr. Stark," he spoke to Tony as if he could understand him, which few of the specialists bothered to do. "I'm going to examine you. It won't hurt."
Yes. Steve kept his gaze ahead as he made himself ask, "When we get Tony's daemon back, will he be like he was? Will he be... whole?"
"The brain PET scan showed no abnormalities, so we attached him to an EEG which registers electrical impulses, and ran some audiovisual tests." Bruce tapped one of the charts to expand it. "These brainwaves show he's conscious -- not in a true catatonic state --, and he's reacting within normal parameters when someone speaks, or when he was shown a flash card. His brain is recognizing what he's seeing. It's processing information. He can hear us, can probably understand us to some extent."
communicate. For whatever reason, he just isn't. Steve," he said, seeing his doubt, "he's not showing signs he's in pain or distress."
"Quite," Malone said. "Other universes. It was..." she smiled a look of wonder, "quite extraordinary."
Steve let out a sound that might have been a half-laugh, if it didn't hurt so much. "Bucky that's--"
"Tony?" Steve asked again, hope lifting. He touched Tony's shoulder and leaned over to look for any sign of life in his eyes.
"Tony! Tony... God, what? What do you think you were doing?" he breathed, hauling him back and pressing him against the wall of the building, at least twenty feet from the edge.
Bucky made a low groan. Steve resolutely didn't look at him, nor did he look in Tony's direction. Clenching his jaw, he glared up at Amora. It was on the tip of his tongue to say "Peggy Carter" because it had been true at one point. But even if she hadn't passed away six months ago, he didn't want to play any part of Amora's game.
But even as Steve cut AIM bots down left and right with his shield, all he could see was Tony standing with his toes hanging off the ledge.
Tony could stand on his own, and walked when someone lightly pushed him along. Flying the armor was out of the question, so Steve requisitioned a quinjet.
Steve slumped, disappointment a bitter taste on the back of his tongue. "So you don't know how to break the spell."
"He made his medical wishes legally known in case he were unable to make those decisions for himself," she said, almost gently.
Flying with Thor and his hammer was not nearly as comfortable of an experience as flying alongside Iron Man, but Steve could bear it.
The words felt like a blow to Steve's heart. He had to stop himself from reaching out to Tony. Touch him. Tell him to hold on, just a little longer...
Steve shook his head. Knocking Tony out hadn't done any good for him last time. "Shhh," he tried to soothe. He kept his voice low, even above Tony's pitched screams. "It's okay. You're safe. You're in the tower. No one is going to hurt you."
Bucky clapped him on the knee -- it stung. He'd done it with his metal hand. "You're a dope, but it kinda figures. You've always had a thing for brunettes. I mean, Peg, had that nice dark, shiny hair and--"
"Then he's..." Steve swallowed down a well of horror and had to stop himself from reaching out to touch Tony's limp hand. "If he can understand us, maybe he's trapped in his own head and can't get out--"
The cage broke apart and the vixen daemon gave a loud yelping cry of triumph, jumping into the air to be caught in Grace's strong talons. It must have hurt, but all Steve could think at that moment was the many times that Ironman had caught him; a mirror image of his and Tony’s partnership.
Strange pulled his cloak around himself, his eyes darting from one Avenger to another. His shoulders sagged a fraction, perhaps sensing their concern even through his wounded pride. "Whatever has happened to Tony Stark is wholly natural or medical, not magical," he said. "I'm sorry, I cannot offer more than that." He hesitated, then added a bit more tentatively, "Before I found this path, I used to be a surgeon. I could, perhaps, take a look at your findings."
Finally, after ten solid minutes of chanting and changing the order and position of the round stones, Strange leaned back and said, "I detect no magical signatures, either in his body or in his aura."
His heart twisted. If he'd put more time into being the friend to Tony he should have been, instead of... of
Mary Malone was a short, athletic woman, her cropped hair gone gray. The man standing next to her was around Steve's perceived age, with dark hair and a serious expression.
"Doctor Parry has offered to come to Asgard with us," Steve said. "We'll have Thor, and Tony will have the suit in case we need to get away in a hurry." He turned to Bucky. "That's three Avengers already, counting Tony. Buck, I need you to stay behind and lead the team, especially if Amora shows up looking for trouble."
"Tony's already made his wishes clear in writing -- and right now we're already ignoring them," Bruce said quietly. Steve' heart sank: Bruce had seen the living will, too. "I'm willing to do it because, like Pepper, I believe there's hope for... for some sort of recovery."
"Yes," he said, "it's possible, but a witch named, Serafina Pekkala taught her to hide him from sight. She may be able to teach you, but I don't know how long it will take, only that it won't be easy. Until then, you would be vulnerable."
"There's no way of knowing. I've only met a dozen or so people from our world who can speak to their daemons, although..." Perry hesitated.
Steve felt his lips curl into a smile. Tony and Riri consistently finished each other’s sentences, especially when making quips. Tony may scoff whenever Steve brought it up, but he was more in touch with his inner self than most people. It was, possibly, part of the reason why the light inside him had nearly snuffed out when Amora had ripped her away.
. Instead, she nodded to her tablet. "I wasn't joking about the meeting. He's chairperson, and this is the annual fiscal report to our investors before SI publically posts tomorrow. His absence is going to raise questions."
"Not worth it," Tony declared through the comm lines. "This isn't even remotely worth my time, Cap. I had a meeting to attend. Granted, it was a yearly fiscal meeting, which is even
That night, the four men and Kirjava slept in an Asgardian style tent that was more like a pavilion.
They walked -- the road had no guard rail or boundaries or fence between the edge and open space, and even though Tony hadn't shown signs of running off since that one fit, Steve kept a hand firmly on his shoulder. It couldn't hurt.
Every inch of him had been bombarded with burning radiation; his bones cracked and reformed, muscles tore, built up, and tore again. And Steve had screamed and screamed. It was all there in Howard Stark's report.
Thor nodded. "Indeed, she was of my mother's court, born of a respected family. When we were younger, there was talk of us being wed."
“I gotta do it,” Steve said, both for his benefit and for his daemon’s. They’d talked about this, weighed the pros and cons together before coming to the conclusion that it had to be done. Thanks to Amora, Tony and his daemon could separate. Steve and Grace could not, and that was a hindrance to be able to fight effectively as an Avenger.
"Hmm." She turned back to Bruce, who was wincing, reaching up to rub under his right eye as if he was getting a headache. "Come upstairs. I will make both of you tea, and we need to plan as a team what to do next."
"This is something new," Steve said. "Natasha, circle to the south. I want that exit by Main Street covered. I think we're about to meet the, uh, main bad guy."
"Well, shit." Clint said, succinctly. Then he reached down and gripped Tony's hand, yanking him to his feet. "C'mon, Stark. You and I are taking a field trip to the archery range."
… The way that Tony had fought him, blindly… His mind had not been in his body at all. It had been with this daemon.
Bruce met Steve as he walked into the tower's common room, fresh from a shower. Thor was there, the hammer set gently on the coffee table before him.
"Thank you, Doctor Banner. I've followed your work with interest," she said in a crisp English accent, after a moment of chit-chat. "May I introduce to you my long-time friend, Doctor William Parry?" They shook hands and Bruce turned to make his own introductions to Steve and Thor, who had tagged along.
"No. It's different when you separate yourself voluntarily. And I was a child, not even thirteen yet. Children are more resilient in many ways."
Tony woke with a screaming fit that came and went more quickly than usual, but left him gray skinned and weak.
, boy." He stepped forward and the finger prodded Steve's chest, right above his heart. "She does, and her eyes are keen."
The wise man's bat daemon came over to flutter around, but not directly touch, Steve's head. Grace again clicked her beak but did not strike out at the other daemon.
Thor, to his credit, did nothing but nod when Steve got to the part where Amora asked him to choose who he loved.
Steve had a very vivid image of Clint shooting an apple off the top of Tony's head to see if he flinched, like a demented William Tell. "Hawkeye--"
Looking at Tony's slack face, his lifeless eyes, something insane gripped Steve. He flashed to Sleeping Beauty. Love's first kiss. This
He placed round stones in different colors at five points around Tony's head. Sitting back, Strange waved first a crystal, then a wooden wand over him, chanting to himself.
"I'm still not sure what to think about these supposed daemons, or the... what did you call them? Spectres?" Natasha asked, glancing at Bruce. "How does the science look behind it?"
Steve shook his head. The team had a pretty good handle on the Slender Men -- there was no need to interrupt Thor's honeymoon with Jane Foster. Even Banner was standing on the sidelines in reserve.
"No," Bruce said quickly. "What you're thinking of is called locked-in syndrome; When someone is fully conscious, but their body is paralyzed. That's simply not the case here -- as far as we can tell, he
"Steve, maybe you should start thinking about if there isn't a bottom to this," she said shortly. "Right now he's an Avenger who can't protect himself. What if the tower is attacked?"
Amora's green eyes seemed to bore into his own, and Steve jerked in surprise when he felt a soft brush against his mind. Like a cool hand laying over his forehead.
And he wondered briefly if those had been spectres, too, twisted by Amora’s magic to become more pliable and bidding. Less dangerous to her.
She shook her head, wiping a tear away with a finger, and rose. "This is a copy of his living will. You can read through it, if you like. Right now, we can't ask Tony what he wants -- but he already told us, while he was able."
Six hours later, Steve sat in a chair beside the hospital bed, his head in his hands. A few feet away, Tony lay still and quiet.
He needn't have bothered. Emerald green lightning suddenly arced across the sky, and dark thunderheads boiled out of nowhere.
Tony was in his room, laying on top of the covers of his bed, staring blankly at the ceiling. The nurse on shift sat nearby with an eReader in her lap. Steve excused her from the room and went to Tony's side. "You have visitors," he said to him, quietly.
"I'm sorry," Parry said, and looked like he meant it. "That part of him has been destroyed forever."
Steve wasn't sure he believed a word, but the look in Parry's eyes made him shiver. "If this is true," he said, "how do we get Tony's back?"
Natasha stood on the other side.  Her face was mask-like in a way that never meant good things for anyone.
Finally, early in the morning, nine days after the encounter with Amora, just as Steve was lacing up his running shoes, he heard a knock on his door.
"Sir," JARVIS' voice came from the speakers, echoing off the gym walls as Steve's fist hit the punching bag with a solid THWAP. He'd been at it for hours -- sometimes it even made him feel better.
"I'm fine," Steve said quickly. "I should... well, I don't mind being here. Bucky and Clint are still hunting down the Slender Men, Natasha's on the hunt for Amora -- maybe you could help?"
His heart lurched -- maybe Tony had snapped out of it, though JARVIS was supposed to tell him the moment anything happened. But... maybe that was him, and he'd come to yell at Steve, tell him to get out of his tower and never disgrace his door again. Kiss him. Something.
Steve straightened his shoulders, steeling himself. "We'd be grateful if you could shed some light. So far, our medical team hasn't come up with much."
Steve and the rest of the Avengers were sitting in the tower's common room. Doctors Malone and Parry had been shown to temporary guest quarters, while the Avengers, most fresh from their battle, convened in the main living area. It took a few minutes for Steve to bring everyone up to date on what had happened. The reactions had been... mixed.
The fox daemon had disappeared several hours into their trek back, running, leaping on ahead, desperate to reunite with her body. Steve had hoped that between Will Parry and the wise man, whatever damage had been done between her and Tony could be fixed.
"I never said Tony's name aloud. I--I wouldn't... do that," Steve said. "But Amora pointed at Tony, and--" He meant to say nothing happened, but something
"You mean, those silken things that cost more than my salary during the war?" Steve asked, with another glance to Tony. He, of course, had no opinion. So Steve touched his shoulder and led him forward. "This way, right?"
"You are a warrior," Thor said in warning. "If someone were knowledgeable enough, all they would need to do is to strike at your daemon."
When the edge of the subtle knife shard touched one of the spectre, it boiled away into nothingness.
Steve looked Kirjava. He hadn't remembered seeing Perry and his daemon in separate rooms, but then again there hadn't been the need. "Really?"
As Bruce was taking a nap -- exhausted by doctor wrangling and apparently the effort it had taken to keep the Hulk at bay-- and everyone else were still scouring the battle site for clues, it was up to Steve to take Tony back to the tower.
Bucky's smile had too much darkness to fully resemble the man he'd been before the war, but it was a good enough echo. "Because deep down inside, you know we're gonna find a way to pull him through." He took a long pull of beer. Then, "So... Stark, eh? He's not as bad as his father."
He'd been quiet, but the woman scowled as if she'd heard. "I am Amora the Enchantress," she announced. "Lately of Asgard, come into this realm to take vengeance for a grievous wrong."
Steve held his wrists in one hand and moved behind him, gripping Tony back to front. Tony writhed, and every breath he let out was a ragged cry, full of pain and fury.
"I'm sorry," he said, looking from Bruce to Thor. His dark gaze settled on Steve. "Something vital has been taken from your friend."
"Ms. Potts," he said, swallowing down his disappointment, and stood aside to let her in. "You're up early."
There was a crack of lightning and a roll of thunder so close it shook Steve to his molars. Suddenly, a woman stood hovering fifty feet over the Avengers. Dressed in a shimmering green gown, she was a curvy looker with blonde hair and vivid green eyes Steve could see even from the ground.
"Game boss," Tony corrected. He'd dropped in altitude, now hovering about twenty feet above the ground, palms pointed towards the building greenish clouds.
Steve tried to imagine this -- an aspect of himself that was female. That didn't make very much sense, though as Parry said a daemon wasn't exactly a soul, but an aspect of someone's consciousness. He sighed. "I... have a hard time picturing that."
As soon as the suit touched down, Steve rushed over to toggle the catches under the gold faceplate. He readied himself for anything as he pulled the helmet up and away.
"I'll be careful with him, Cap." Clint clapped Tony so hard on the shoulder, he actually swayed a little. "We're going to talk shop, aren't we, Stark? You owe me a bow."
It wasn't like he could go outside anymore, not unless he wanted to break through the throng of reporters camping out by every tower exit in the week since the news broke.
On his shoulder, Grace squeezed her talons. Absently, he reached up to scratch her softer neck feathers. Who was he kidding? He was about to suffer, too.
And it didn't matter if Tony hated him, if the thing between them that had just barely started never took off. It didn't matter as long as Tony was back and whole and healthy.
Steve felt something in his heart warm. Bucky was doing better all the time, and Tony kept watch above them all -- his two favorite people were working together, getting along.
Steve frowned, but what if they found something this time? So he stayed silent. Tony sat passively, not twitching as the needle slid in, or reacting at all as the nurse exchanged one tube for another, finished, withdrew, and gently pushed him to lay down again. He stared up at the ceiling, occasionally blinking.
The door burst open and several nurses and a doctor rushed in. It took Bruce to pull Steve, who was too shocked, out of their way. They hovered over Tony as his screams turned into terrible, sobbing wails. Someone called for a sedative, and the room fell silent only as Tony's eyes rolled into the back of his head. He slumped, unconscious.
Steve reacted on instinct, snatching his hand back, but it didn't seem to matter. Tony curled in on himself, his fingers clawing over his arc reactor, his eyes big and terrified and staring at something no one could see.
Tony hated magic, and while Steve tried to keep more of an open mind, sometimes he agreed. "Clint and Bucky find anything on the Slender Men?"
Distantly, Steve sensed the horror and pity of the visitors, but all his attention was on Tony as he repeated the words to him that had almost become a mantra: That Tony was all right, that he was safe now... Come back to us.
Bucky liked Tony just fine. They'd spent hours in the lab on Bucky's arm -- while not up to Tony's level, Bucky had a decent grasp of robotics, which was improving all the time with Tony's tutelage. It helped that Bucky liked AC/DC, which Steve could never understand.
"That is my fear, yes." Again, Parry hesitated as if to collect his thoughts. "To begin with, what you must know is there are generally three parts to a person; the body, the ghost or spirit... and the daemon."
He wasn't all that heavy, though the counterbalance of the man in his arms and the weight of the travel pack was a little awkward, it wasn't too much for Steve to handle.
"What, with more of her soul-eating monsters?" Bucky's voice was acid, but there was an undercurrent of resignation to it. He knew Steve was right. Earth needed protection, and after all, they'd split up a few times even during the war, though neither one of them liked it. "These doctors of yours have any bright ideas on how to fight 'em? More flashlights?"
Steve's lips pulled into a smile. "Tony was being a wiseass to Amora. That's what he does when he --- he's got so many walls." Distantly, Steve felt his hand clench and release. "He keeps everything at arms length. He's so smart, and most of the time when he talks to you it's like he's got the conversation planned out three steps ahead." He took another breath, adding, "I knew his father, you know? We were friends, in the war. I think it was Howard who made him put all those walls up, and sometimes I wish... I wish
His safe room. The one truly Hulk-proof place in the tower. If Bruce had locked himself in there, it meant he was on the verge of losing control.
Tony swayed a little at the nudge. His eyes remained blank as Pepper came up to him, looking first at Tony, then at Steve. She gave a nod, seeing what Steve was doing. "I've seen you pull a lot of stunts to get out of board meetings, but this is really it," she said to Tony.
could just go back in time and sock him in the jaw." Steve paused at that second, distantly aware he'd said something odd in that phrasing, but not able to pinpoint what it was. He shook his head, eyes half shut, staring into the fire. "But Tony, when he's really talking to you, when he's not giving you the For The Press smile, when he's not thinking three or four steps ahead of the conversation you're still having with him, he's the most generous, kind, infuriating man..."
SHIELD medical personnel had been buzzing in and out, withdrawing blood samples, hooking Tony up to machines, disconnecting him a few minutes later, wheeling him out for MRI, CAT, PET and whatever other scans they could think of, bringing him back, rehooking him up to IV's, heart-monitors...
Sure enough, Bucky broke the topic immediately, though his approach was wildly different from Natasha's. "You know, when that lady started going off about punishing who you loved, I thought I was a goner," he said, bluntly. "Thank goodness for Stark."
Steve relayed his apologies, but he couldn't leave the tower right then. Funny. He'd always disliked it when Tony left Pepper to twist in the wind when something major at SI came up, but there was nothing for it. Bruce needed Steve more.
Tony stood, completely unaccompanied, on the very point of the out-thrust landing pad. The toes of his bare feet hung off the edge.
"He'll pull through," Bucky said again. His smile was more of a wince. "I feel bad for him, mostly. When HYDRA took me out, they at least stuffed something back in."
The house cat that stood by the man's feet was... unexpected. Large for a cat, it had dark, smoky under-shadings to its fur. It was quite beautiful in a subtle sort of way.
Pepper hired a nurse to keep watch on Tony during the day, to lead him to the bathroom every two hours, clean him, keep his goatee neat, and prepare food and spoon it in his mouth as if he were a child.
Dum-E immediately wheeled up, a dunce cap on its head, with a smoothie in its claw. Tony didn't react, letting the robot push it into his hand. His fingers curled around the glass, and he stood there, blank.
But Tony's fit had come on so suddenly, JARVIS hadn't had time to issue a warning. His flailing hand had slapped a bioscan panel near the door. It had opened -- JARVIS had no overrides-- something which was quickly fixed by Pepper.
Those feelings were not appropriate as a friend or a team leader. He stuffed them down with ease of long practice, then reholstered his flashlight to his belt.
"Nice," she said in distaste. "That woman can kill a man in ten different ways without a weapon, and you call her nice." Her eyes went soft. "Steve..."
Thor rumbled something that Steve couldn't quite make out, and he thought that should have bothered him, but he couldn't quite bring himself to care.
"After Afghanistan," Pepper said, "well, before really, but he amended it afterwards, Tony made me the medical power of attorney for his living will."
The days passed. Bruce brought in more specialists -- neurologists, psychiatrists, neurophysiologists, internal medicine doctors --  to consult and run tests. They took Tony on and off medications that had good results with catatonic patients, with no visible affect.
"Your assistance is needed on the rooftop landing pad, immediately." Mr. Stark has gone outside." A pause. "Hurry."
"I am no magician," Thor rumbled after a few moments. "Magic was Loki's art, and my mother's." He turned to Steve, his eyes solemn, "but I have seen enchanted men in my travels, cast under spells similar to the ones Amora grew known for. The men were her slaves, their minds turned to her bidding. They were not idle. Not like this."
According to JARVIS, it took five minutes and forty-five seconds for Tony to calm. It felt much longer. By the time he stopped, Tony was drenched in sweat, and Steve felt no less exhausted.
"In that world -- the world of Cittàgazze-- they appeared as... sort of malevolent whisps in the air, but not all universes hold to the same rules. For example, there were worlds where people routinely talk to their own daemons, where they exist outside of themselves. Not inside, like here." Perry tapped his own chest, over his heart.  "It may be that in this world, the spectres can't be seen."
Just as a warning: This is the grimmest chapter in the fic. Things will look up from here, but this is where the 'possible suicidal actions' warning comes into play.
"Yeah, great. Wonderful. Then we'll only be able to tell where the Slender Men are by the light of their creepy eyes," Tony said.
He had nothing but the bare essentials in his own fridge, as he always preferred to eat in the common room with the team. Pepper politely declined a glass of water, and sat down at his small dining room table, pulling out a folder. "I was headed downtown for a meeting before the market opens, but I needed to stop by. We should to talk about Tony. I..." She hesitated. "There's no easy way to broach this."
"Indeed. I am not the fine tracker as my comrade, Hogun, but I know the signs of Asgard." Thor stood, then, alarmingly, pulled Steve into a huge, strong hug. Steve may or may not have flailed for a moment, more surprised than anything else.
"That is no true animal," Thor said, surprising them all. "I've seen its like before, though never on Midgard."
The fox, torn from Tony by such force that it had traumatized his body, was still fighting. And every time she had nearly escaped the encircling cage of spectres, her link with Tony would be reestablished, if just briefly.
The cat lifted a paw to pat the air before Tony's chest. "Here," she said, "I saw only briefly. The connection became alive again, thin as spider-silk. I think they are still together in a way, Will. They've been ripped apart, but she's still alive."
"Breathe in the smoke," he said, and as he did the air in the room seemed to shift, rolling the smoke over Steve's head. It was scented with sage and pine. Steve frowned.
"You said something vital is gone," Steve blurted, "His..." the good Catholic schoolboy inside rebelled, but he said it anyway, "daemon?"
"It should have never been filmed in the first place." Steve paged back on the screen to the website's homepage. Sure enough, the video was CNN's top story.
At once, Parry was knelt at Tony's side, taking his vitals. "I don't like how fast his heart is beating." He pinched Tony's skin on the top of his hand. "Dehydrated, too, like it or not."
The front door was a hide of some fantastic animal -- possibly a zebra, only with muddy brown and red stripes. Thor pushed it aside and walked in without knocking.
"This is him?" the man asked in a high, reedy voice. "Yes," he said before anyone could speak. "Yes, I understand. Sit him down. No, not there, boy. On the rug."
She shook her head once and reached past him to press the elevator button for Bruce's labs. Then, wordlessly, she whipped out her StarkPhone and pressed play.
"A Doctor William Parry, from his driver's license. Records indicate he is a family physician in practice near Oxford England."
"There was a girl, she was -- is -- a dear friend. She told me of people in her world who separated from their daemons through a medical procedure. Intercision." He shook his head. A look of quiet disgust crossed his face. "Once that link is broken, it's impossible to truly put them back together. The adults were able to lead lives afterwards. They were self-aware, just... unimaginative. Unquestioning. The perfect drones, you see."
Stephen Strange was, for lack of a better adjective, a strange man. Decked out in a high collar cape and a dandy pair of pants, he made a show of directing Clint and Steve to lie Tony down in the middle of the floor.
He glanced across the room, through the floor-to-ceiling windows, and his heart stuttered to a stop.
"I'm coming with you," Bucky insisted for the third time. "Steve, if you're going to Asgard, you're gonna need back-up."
There were ghostly shapes deep with inside the stronghold. Enough to make up a miniature army. And there, past bits and machinery spitting magic sparks that Steve could not begin to understand, stood a snarling fox. She was smoky black and gray, with points of orange extending out from her feet and ears. And she was ringed in by a living cage of what Will had called the spectres.
But if Strange was inwardly gloating that the great Tony Stark had been brought low by magic, he didn't voice it, and it never showed once in his expression.
But Steve could also see a hollowness to Tony's cheeks that hadn't been there a few weeks ago, and his wrists felt thin and birdlike, his shoulder-blades sharp where they pressed against Steve's chest. Despite all their efforts, Tony was losing weight, fading in front of Steve's eyes.
"I assure you, it has legitimate scientific backing," Malone said, "You know I've experimented with elementary particles. I have evidence -- and I'll be happy to share with you -- that they are self-aware to an extent. More, that they are actually
"Then JARVIS calls a suit and flies him to safety. He'll still be more protected here than anywhere else."
"No," Steve said firmly. "You're only doing your best for Tony, Bruce. You put your trust in the wrong person, but you can't hold yourself responsible for the acts of evil people."
It was a long, long wait. Steve considered going to fetch his shield, but if Bruce did lose control, even that would be little help. Pepper called once, through JARVIS, with a request for Steve to meet her at SI headquarters. With Tony's condition thrust into the public, she needed his presence as Avengers team leader as she released a statement.
The wise man looked grave. “Love is more than simply a strong feelings. It is a force which creates a bond between two people. Part of this man," he nodded to Tony, “is surely with the sorceress. Through the bond of love, you should be able to locate him. And her."
Later, Steve wouldn't remember rushing up to him, only wrapping his arms around Tony and yanking him around and back. Tony didn't resist at all.
this is not black and white, but Steve... he can't go on like this. I've been speaking with some of the doctors, and other professionals. They recommended several rehabilitation facilities -- top institutes that specialize in brain injuries."
Steve stared at her for a shocked moment, cold congealing in his gut. "Pepper, he's not in a coma. He's awake, he can feed himself." Not enough to keep up a sick child, he should know, but it was something. It had to count..
to the Iron Man launch pad. He tried--" Steve hesitated, but he had to own up to it if no one else would. That was the type of man he was. "He tried to end his suffering."
Tony groaned, then reached a claw-like hand towards his arc reactor. Steve caught his wrists with practice, now, sitting behind him and immobilizing his arms as Tony thrashed and screamed at nothing, fighting tooth and nail against something only he could see.
"Steve," Parry said, quietly urgent. "It's possible. Mary Malone learned to speak to her daemon, but she has to take care to hide him from sight, and that took her years. Even then, they can't be more than a few dozen feet apart. Ever."
Bruce nodded and held out a tablet. There were several charts with squiggly lines running across them. Steve recognized one as a heart-beat monitor, another for blood pressure and respiration, but there were others with sharp dips and valleys he couldn't begin to guess at.
"Yes, this was among her gifts." But there was no judgment in Thor's voice that Steve could hear, and after a beat, Steve went on. He ended with describing what he could of Tony's strange violent reaction he'd had a few hours ago.
"I agree." The elevator slid to a halt, and Natasha grabbed Steve's arm. "But we have a bigger problem. Those neurologists were hired by Bruce -- he's shut himself in his safe room."
Steve sucked in a breath, not used to such things being said so openly, honestly, and yes, bluntly. Grace made a low, burring sound in the back of her throat and clicked her beak. Her talons squeezed his shoulder slightly and reminded Steve that no matter how embarrassed he might be speaking of private matters, he was not alone.
Amora's lips widened into a smile. "I see. Your pain will become my strength, and every time Anthony Edward Stark suffers, know that I grow in power."
They were still in the forest when evening fell. Thor pulled the chariot off the side of the road to give his goats rest. Steve helped with their feeding and care, wary of the goats sharp teeth. They fed on chunks of bloody meat, which Steve suspected wasn't normal -- he remembered goats in cartoons eating cans and such -- and Thor seemed to know each one by name and disposition.
The nurse extended Tony's arm. And Tony, who was the world's worst patient, who charmed and played-down injuries or outright lied not to be kept in a hospital room for one second longer than was needed, who hated to even be handed things, passively let her.
He didn't realize he needed to hear that until then. A little of the weight slid off his chest. "Thanks, Buck."
The wise man pushed Steve to sit and went off to the other side of the hut, muttering to himself and pulling herbs out of jars and baskets.
“Has all the earmarks of one. You’re here to find yourself. Or,” he cast a swift glance at Grace who, as always, stood on Steve’s shoulder, “lose yourself, I guess.”
"Doctor Malone." Bruce strode forward, his expression slightly pinched as he took in the cat. "I saw your presentation on elementary particles and dark matter at the conference in Madrid."
Steve nudged Tony's side. "I've never seen you get tongue-tied around a pretty girl before, Iron Man."
"Cap," Bruce said intently, probably seeing the look on Steve's face. "There hasn't been any sign of brain damage. Whatever this is, there's a very good possibility it's starting to pass."
Until that moment, Thor had been silent. He rose from his seat and stepped forward. "I do not understand your reticence, Captain. Would he not be well taken care of in such a place?"
Then from his pocket, he withdrew an interesting device. It appeared to be a set of hardware store pliers with the pincers encased within a bubble of glass. Visible inside, Steve saw they were locked on either side of a piece of smoky looking shrapnel.
"My minions." She tossed her head, her hair shimmering down her shoulders. "They represent but a fraction of my power."
"My friends!" he boomed, startling Steve so badly he used the magazine he was reading as an impromptu shield.
He thought about hitting the stairs instead of the elevator, but the elevator doors were already open and waiting for his arrival. Trusting JARVIS to put on the speed, he got in. The pull of gravity made it clear the elevator was going at full speed, and only a few seconds later he was stepping out.
Steve winced. "Those weren't spectres. Those were something else, probably set up as a distraction. Apparently, spectres aren't really alive, so they can't be killed."
