Sherlock shakes his head; his curls bounce a little.
Sherlock doesn’t have time to reply, because just then he gets another text, this time from Lestrade:
John bites his lip and hesitates for another moment. “You know, if you want to... you could come by later? I put Rosie down at 7.”
Then, a few minutes later:
Then, finally:
John shakes his head in disbelief, then meets Sherlock’s eyes, feeling a smile spread across his face. “Of course, I do, you idiot.”
“Well… I thought you weren’t gay, mate?”
Alright. At least the damage doesn’t seem to be as bad as he feared. Although he does hope that explosion really wasn’t too bad.
Greg, Molly and Harry decide to play matchmakers. Scheming ensues.
“How do you know that?”
“What, romantically? Don’t be ridiculous. No, he doesn’t.”
, do you?”
“Indeed. There’s something I want to check.”
The second time is better. There is a certain rhythm that they seem to pick up on. It’s less urgent. They take the time to map out each other's bodies and get to know their responses, their wants and needs. It’s all so new, and yet makes so much sense. Like this was what they were always meant to be doing, they were just too stupid to realize it.
One afternoon, while John has been helping him look through an insane number of notebooks and diaries for one specific phone number that the victim may or may not have scribbled in one of them, their conversation has fallen on the hobbies they had when they were at school. This conversation, as has become their habit, continues almost immediately after John has closed the door behind him (taxi again, then):
“It doesn’t have a lock, and I don’t need to lock it, it’s the door to my room, Sherlock,” John starts with exasperation, but works his way up to a shout.
After the porchetta, Sherlock left several cookbooks lying about the kitchen.  He never actually saw John looking at them, but a fine mist of talcum caught in the edge of the spine made the deductions simple.
with John.
John is no consulting detective, but even he realizes that in the absence of footsteps heading down the stairs, Sherlock must be sitting, standing, or draping his long body over the landing.  He tests the waters with “Buggering shit,” and when that produces no response, he continues on with “Jesus fucking christ on a trampoline,” more softly but with great feeling.  He hears Sherlock bounce once on his sulky toes and blinks, a sudden picture in his head.  Not Jesus on a trampoline -- he might say it, but the image is beyond silly -- no, what he sees is Sherlock, his long limbs splaying, his impossible curls ricocheting, his one-size-too-tight aubergine shirt straining to the breaking point.
“And Mycroft just, what? Bloody let you?” demands John.
The other man undresses somewhat haphazardly, with one eye on John alert for attacks, but John just watches him.  John is already in a sleep shirt and pants, and he doesn’t seem to feel the need to be wearing less.
He got home late, brandishing Thai take away from the new place that John liked.  John was sitting in his armchair, looking like he’d been there a while, and he eyed Sherlock speculatively while unpacking the food.  John ate sparingly for once, and then they watched a bit of crap telly, and Sherlock did his best to be brilliant and witty when he cut the fictional detective to ribbons, but he could feel the tension, the waiting, the anticipation radiating ever more strongly from John.  About 5 minutes from the show’s final reveal, Sherlock laid out The Answer, which never failed to get a growling complaint from John, but this time John merely grunted “glad that’s out of the way” and clicked off the set.
“Neither do I, considering my French heritage and the abundance of evidence scattered--“ Sherlock stumbled to a halt. John had been looking intrigued, but already he was recovering. Amused, but not tempted.
Once Sherlock relaxes a bit, John coaxes him to his feet again.  He’s still swaying woozily, so John presses his forehead to Sherlock’s shoulder, stabilizing him.   Then he slides around to Sherlock’s back, one arm loosely around Sherlock’s chest, the other curled low on his belly in a lover’s embrace.  Holding the taller man steady, John bounces them up and down, gently at first, then high enough to make Sherlock catch his breath.
“That’s what sex is, Sherlock.  It releases tension.  It’s almost impossible to do it and not feel … happy … with the other person.  For me, I mean.  Obviously there’s a lot of people out there who are ... who can abuse sex, or get bored with it, or even use it to control someone else, but, well, that’s not me.”  He wonders how much he can tell Sherlock without triggering a relapse, but Sherlock asks, with genuine curiosity,
The next morning, Sherlock assembled his new emulsifier and ran tests on a variety of common ingredients, but stopped regretfully when he got to the human ears in the unlabeled butter tub.  No doubt John would have qualms.  Not that he would have served the ears, ever.
John blinks in surprise, savoring the sudden warmth flooding into his limbs.  “Always,” he answers, and follows Sherlock to bed.
The other man looks John up and down and says “Army?”  John nods curtly, noticing the American accent, and the other man jerks his chin and replies “Marines.”
Sherlock has promised (John made him swear twice, once on the skull and again on his own microscope) that he will lay low and won’t get himself killed before John can join him.  He wonders what it means, that he won’t ask Sherlock to swear on the Strad.
On Tuesday, there are no cases, and John makes a weak joke about walls getting shot and they both laugh much longer than the joke merits, but then Sherlock announces that he's going out, and no, he doesn't need backup.
John has slept, like a sane human being without a death wish, at least 5 hours a night since this case began.  So now he is both hungry and horny, but every time he tries to move, Sherlock clamps down tighter.  So John huffs a few times and resigns himself to sleeping.
“And you had to come,” repeats John mercilessly.
They storm at each other through night and into breakfast, when John all but force-feeds Sherlock a half-piece of toast and Sherlock has the distinct impression that something quite different from eating is going on.  After the toast, John concedes to negotiating conditions, which Sherlock finds fascinating.  John declares the question of gender irrelevant, and Sherlock is relieved since he suspects that both gender and appearance are indeed highly relevant predictive variables.  Why else would John still be ogling him on the steps after all this time?
"You have no idea," Sherlock answers conversationally, "all of the things I plan to do to you."
“How do you think I ended up with boyfriends?” Sherlock asks, cocking an eyebrow at John.  When John blanches, he pouts visibly and adds “not all of them, John.   In any case, forty-five seconds of effort seems a small price for a peaceful month.  You, as I have noted before, are sadly inefficient.  An average of 8 minutes and 23 seconds inefficient. And a dissatisfyingly large coefficient of variation as well.”
John smiles encouragingly at him. “Under the circumstances, I didn’t think to bring the lube…” he says, but his hand moves to his zip all the same.  The small metal teeth vibrate in Sherlock’s ears, and then John is shoving his trousers and pants down around his thighs.  His cock spills out, fluid and softly cocooned, and Sherlock takes a step closer.  John touches the head, strokes the foreskin lightly up and down, his eyes flutter shut and then open again, and he fixes on Sherlock. “But you have to talk to me,” he says, his voice low and rasping already.
Ravioli went so well that Sherlock found alibis for stromboli, polenta, and porchetta as well.  By the third meal in a week, John was checking the kitchen of his own accord, and Sherlock was getting used to being corralled at a table and eating adult-sized portions.
“Short is helpful if you go out for gymnastics,” John adds. “Not that I did.  Got a growth spurt and that was the end of it.”
W: Good night John
W: I’m leaving it open.
On the seventh Thursday, John sets himself to small tasks around the flat.  He finds a screwdriver to tighten a loose doorknob, rakes ashes and something else -- charred fingernails? -- from the bottom of the oven, and scrubs the sink drain.  In past relationships, he has found that having a task to do makes talking about potentially sensitive topics easier.  He hopes it’s a general rule, because he’s never had quite such a topic to broach.
getting desperate.”
Although John had been right, that first night.  Sherlock considered 90 seconds to be plenty and to spare for an activity that he indulged in only rarely, and which tended to leave him dyspeptic afterwards.
He climbs into bed next to Sherlock, pulls the covers over Sherlock, who hasn’t strirred since the end of the experiment, bowed in on himself like a trilobite.
“Hardly the point, love,” John returns, but the heat is already fading from his voice.
“You. Custard. I don’t know why I didn’t think of that.”
“Sherlock!!” he heard John’s voice approaching from the living room. “Do you hear a strange hissing—“
“And I am sorry, not for who I am, but sorry for how it affects you all the same.”
John smirks, but he also stops.  "Well?  Now that you can think, anything else?"
“As a doctor, you know full well where the scapular crest is,” Sherlock continues. “I can only assume—“ but he cuts off suddenly and burrows his face farther into the sheets.
Sherlock’s connection arrives during Columbo – the fifth episode in a row for John, who gets up and walks straight into the bedroom when he sees the other man at the door.
...” he falters, and then adds bitterly “Or do you suppose I follow all my boyfriends around like a goddamn puppy trying to catch them masturbating?”
The stillness of the room is so jarring that his stomach lurches.  Sherlock is pressed to his side, just as before, his two hands in identical positions, his legs still holding John’s captive, his mouth still quiet against John’s chest.  Only the high keening noise is new, and that would be John -- and a drop of pre-come smeared across Sherlock’s stomach.
The sarcastic venom pools silently between them until Sherlock does something he’s never done before, not with John, and that is apologise.  Or at least try to.  He gets only two syllables into “I’m sorry”.
“Why not?” asked Sherlock, all innocent puzzlement.  “I’ve seen it before, you didn’t need privacy then.”
“Then
It was amusing in an odd, touching sort of way – John liked to watch him eat, and apparently he liked to watch John eat as well, except that where Sherlock looked hungry, John looked like a doctor who was finally getting his say.
“Should I…” starts the other man, but John interrupts.
John said nothing.
After a bit of wheedling, she agrees to explain the process to him, along with some wry warnings about the advisability of doing sex therapy without an actual therapist.  “Could be dangerous” notes John with a momentary grin, and she laughs as if it was a joke.
, this is want he’s fantasized about seeing,
“I was thinking that Thursdays would be a good time,” finished Sherlock in a rush.
“You need to respect when I need privacy,” John stays the course, “just like I would respect your need for privacy,”  He realises it’s a mistake as soon as it’s out of his mouth, he’s just not sure why.  Fortunately Sherlock is more than happy to enlighten him.
Sherlock walks away, and John hears the faint sound of fiddling, which lasts long enough for John’s skin to raise goosebumps.  Apparently being in your pants in their big bed on a cool November evening is less comfortable when nothing is actually happening.  Just as John is starting to consider burrowing under the covers, Sherlock returns.  The right strap is  slipping repeatedly over his eye, and he looks flummoxed, and beyond that, unsure, quiet, and reserved.
His face is gone completely white.
“I don’t --” Sherlock begins, but John springs lightly on the bed by way of teaching him a lesson.  Sherlock sprawls inelegantly, hands, feet, and curls going in ten different directions, and after that he wraps his arms around his knees and lets John bounce him this way and that.
W: Not that I’m blaming you for it. Not at all.
And there are a few nights, mostly after a case, when sex flows and fizzes like champagne.
“I don’t observe because I don’t want to know,” huffs John, but Sherlock continues without a break, “the first Tuesday of every month.  It’s rare that there a case early in the morning on Tuesday.”
When they get home, just past sunset, Sherlock is stumbling and bleary eyed.  John has a pot of tea and a plate of sandwiches in mind, but Sherlock snags him like a life-sized security blanket and drags him to the bedroom.  He divests John of his most of his clothing and sets his own wool suit jacket and trousers carefully on a chair back.  Then he pulls John into bed, wraps his long arms and one leg around John to prevent his escape, pulls the duvet over them both, and plunges deeply into sleep.
“Of course,” answers John.  “But that didn’t prove anything, did it?”
“Look, I know this isn’t your fault, it’s my mad berk of a flatmate up there,” angling his chin in Sherlock’s direction, “but I’ll tell you how this is going to work.  I’m going to fuck you, and then I’m going to take care of myself.”
“Absolutely.  No human parts, yeah?”
So Sherlock did the most natural thing in the world.  He wriggled down until he was clamped to the very edge of the couch, only his palm still brushing against John’s scalp.  Then he closed his eyes and dozed off again like an albatross clinging to the edge of a cliff.
John can’t quite prevent his sharp, tight hiss, loud in the silence of the flat, and Sherlock scrambles around, locates John’s hand, rubs it hard across his face, his forehead, lips, both cheeks, lips again, sucks three fingers into his mouth and pulls John by the crook of the elbow on top of him, splays John out over his shoulders and neck and ribs, rubs his face back and forth on the heel on John’s hand, sucks frenetically at John’s fingers.  The reaction is bizarre enough that John huffs a not-quite-laugh and lowers his forehead to Sherlock’s curls, just above his ear, nuzzles, whispers endearments, breathes warm until Sherlock relents and lets his pruned fingers go, murmurs “could be memories of other people too.  Could be a lot of things.”
Sherlock may think that John is a bit slow on the uptake, but John’s figured out a few things by now.  Since talking it out  and maintaining boundaries don’t seem to be getting him anywhere, he comes up with his own rules.
don’t keep me safe, I’m perfectly capable of doing that myself.  Did you possibly think you’d be the first lust-crazed boyfriend I’ve had to thwart?”
John feels his lungs collapse inside him.  He closes his eyes and tries to stop his hands from tremoring. He feels that he's narrowly avoided mass destruction, and it's all he can do to keep breathing.
On Monday, Sherlock uses 3 of the carrots to make risotto for John and huffs at him when John looks surprised.  Cooking is just chemistry, after all, and there's no reason for John to think that Sherlock can't do it, other than the fact that John hasn't seen him do more than wash forks since he moved in.
god help him
They continue staring at each other a bit awkwardly.  What do you say when you’ve just faked your own violent death and are meant to be gone?  Or when you’ve just declared your undying love to a soon-to-be corpse at the top of your lungs in front of god knows who? Eventually, John asks, “How secure is this place, according to Mycroft?”
These days, they still bicker, John still embarrasses Sherlock regularly on his blog, and Sherlock still blows up kitchen appliances.  They don't play as much as John would like – usually after a good case, but otherwise it's hard, being the caretaker of a brain like that.  Hard to connive or cajole it into being quiet, harder still to compel it to stay that way.  But Sherlock eats better when he cooks for John and sleeps better curled up next to John, so that's something.  And sometimes when John asks for risotto, his eyes go dreamy...
John wants to make a point about privacy, feels a need to set some boundaries and establish healthy communication about this, but fuck, as soon as he allowed himself to linger just for a moment on the memory of Sherlock’s breath on his skin and the faintest brush of his lashes and the moist heat of his tongue when he licked his lips, John is lost.  He is worse than lost.  The presence of those same lashes and lips and tongue in this room with him, even if they are gazing at him earnestly from over near the door, overwhelm his rational mind and he gives himself over to the movement, the push and pull, the warmth and tightness and building waves of pleasure, the incredible rightness of it all, until he tips happily giddily dizzy over the edge.
John can’t help it, he has to touch Sherlock, so he grasps one sharp wrist and makes a show of counting his pulse. It is absolutely steady and normal.  “Why even do it--” he begins.
The last three minutes pass less eventfully, with John rocking Sherlock in what he hopes is a soothing rhythm into the mattress.  When the timer goes off, he lets up gradually on the rocking, then stands up, puts his shirt back on, walks around the bed, pulls ineffectively at the covers, replaces the go-pro on the table, then walks back to where he started, gazing at Sherlock’s oblivious back.
“Non sequitur,” huffs Sherlock.  “Evidently your reasoning is flawed.”
Well, this is how I think Reichenbach should have gone.
Three things that Sherlock was rather pleased with himself for, largely, avoiding.  And he had the numbers to back it up.
On the third go-around, John realizes he is rocking in time with his heartbeat.  He freezes and clenches his eyes shut.  Which doesn’t help, not really.  It’s all too easy to imagine Sherlock, suckling like a child against his chest, then biting down softly with his teeth,not enough to mark, just enough for a faint dusky bloom, to imagine the hand on his arse leaving five matching dusky fingerprints, the other hand curving around and between their bodies to stroke feather-soft and smoothly-gliding against the shaft of John’s cock, his third hand (and this is a both a relief and a hard blow, because mathematically, John knows he has to be dreaming) playing like a melody on the curve of John’s arse, his violinist’s fingers slipping painlessly inside him, seeking staccato glissando crescendo and finding vibrando vibrato and John’s entire body thrilling against Sherlock in pleasure and Sherlock  crooning to him softly, begging pleading entreating him
“I realize that a Friday or Saturday evening is more traditional, but your schedule varies week to week, and most of our cases involve a good deal of physical exertion on the weekend, whereas Tuesdays are statistically the most likely for episodes of severe boredom ending in walls being shot at, and that may not be very conducive to – this – so Thursday seems like a good compromise,” he finished in one breath.
and John opens his eyes.
“And I still wish you’d outgrow your victorian upbringing.”
W: John?
Before he had finished the sentence his words had turned slurred and drowsy, and Sherlock slitted one eye open and began to wonder whether John had ever been sleepy in the first place.  He glared so hard that John eventually opened both his eyes, took in Sherlock’s face, and let out a very soft, very quiet, almost completely well-hidden giggle.  Which Sherlock couldn’t really fail to hear, since he was only inches from the doctor.  Which made Sherlock purse his own lips in an attempt not to respond in kind, but really, since when has John Watson giggling been something Sherlock can resist? And anyway, he felt like he’d been on a bloody roller coaster already over one kiss, a hand to the cheek, and a few pokes at John’s shoulder.
(See the end of the chapter for
So he waited until the milk got low.  Then he waited for John to mention going round to pick up a few items.  Then he got out his coat and scarf and met John by the door.
Sherlock smiled carefully, measuring out the precise quantities of bitter and sweet and silly and sad, and murmured “It must be relaxing, not being me.  Tell me about being you.”
it feels good,
John takes a glance at the printed email in Sherlock’s hand, noting that the man spells his name in capitals, EZ, and ventures “American?”
John sighs, and Sherlock continues “as of this morning, when he found that the Grandsons of Russia Foundation had been disbanded overnight.  We’re meeting him at the cafe next door to his former place of employment.”
"Really?" John spreads his fingers, draws lazy circles on Sherlock's scalp, and Sherlock's eyes drift shut for a few moments, then snap open again.  "Stop that," he complains, "How can I think when you're prodding at my brain?"
Sherlock glares and John sighs again.  “Look,” he begins more peaceably, “I know there are things you don’t like, and that’s, that’s good, that’s fine, no one’s blaming you or asking you to change--”
He doesn’t ask for a joint appointment.  Even a therapist must have her limits, and he is not interested in witnessing Sherlock shred hers.  In any case, fitting Sherlock into her beige office would be like stuffing a peacock into a phone booth. No, he just makes an appointment for himself, on his lunch break, on what he hopes will be a quiet day.
"I won't do it again," promises Sherlock.  "If I ask you, you'll know it's what I want."
It turns out that although there is lots of trampolining in London, there are no trampoline gyms like we have in the US.  At least not that I could find on google maps.  So, sorry about that...
John has checked out of this conversation right about the time the statistical analysis began, which seems preferable to melting into the flooring in a puddle of mortification.  That’s why his response time is woefully lacking when Sherlock undoes the contentious dressing gown belt and pushes the black silk pants partway down his slender hips, saying “what I

come out of his mouth?
John mentioned that he liked Italian himself.
Sherlock is dusting off his knees and doesn’t bother to answer, so John continues.  “Sit down, Sherlock.  We need to talk.”
not blaming you and I’m sure as fuck not asking you to change, it’s just…” he trails off briefly, looks down at half-unfolded jeans and bottle of lube for inspiration, and continues softly “I’m not like that, there’s so much that I want, and it’s not fair to you…”
“Stop worrying,” says John.  “I spent half my 13th year at the local swim club flipping off the high dive, and the other half jumping off walls and landing on my head.  It’s already been damaged to the extent possible.”
" answers John.
.  His heart races because this is want he’s dreamed of hearing,
“Fine,
he’d finished off a piece of tricky pipetting (right before setting the toaster oven on fire, which is easier to do than it sounds) before finally succumbing to sleep.
Since then John’s been wanking morning and evening, and sometimes in the afternoon if he can get a bit of free time.  He is intensely and pathetically grateful to Sherlock for never bringing up the “coming in his pants” part again, and he doesn’t feel guilty now about appropriating Sherlock’s image for his personal pleasure, but still…
“I threatened to throw a tantrum in the street in front of Scotland Yard if he didn’t,” Sherlock admits with a bit of bravado.
“Fine,” Sherlock rolls his eyes.  “I’m sure the murderer won’t mind dallying for a few minutes so that you can finish up.”  He places his hands on the wall behind him and leans back onto them.  “Well, get on with it.  The cabbie will be here in, oh, one and a half minutes.  That should give you plenty of time.”
John has no clue how Sherlock has managed even one other relationship, but instead he says “Wolf-hound, maybe.  I can’t think of anyone less like a puppy, Sherlock.” Despite himself, Sherlock’s mouth crooks into half a smile, and John wants so badly to forget everything, to surrender to momentary warmth that doesn’t solve anything.
“You’re not strong enough to--” Sherlock begins scornfully, but John outglares him with “Army, remember?  I’ll use your fucking dressing gown belt.  Yeah, it’s definitely me I’m worrying about.”
It’s a long silent cab ride, and by the time they get there, the streets have thinned and houses are surrounded by small gardens.  Inside, John pays for two lime green wristbands and exchanges his sensible walking shoes and Sherlock’s posher footwear for green-and-blue velcroed boots that clash with Sherlock’s wool suit.  He tugs a curious but recalcitrant Sherlock towards the array of in-ground trampolines.
For several seconds the two men just stare at each other.
to know that John is unhappy with the situation and angry with himself and despairing of solutions.  He has only to look at John’s face, his tight smile, his red-rimmed eyes, to know that.
And then there were more long minutes that Sherlock’s only slightly chastened brain could use to organize, process, store all of this new information, and that was fine.  When John was coherent again, Sherlock curled up next to him, feeling flayed and comforted at the same time.  “So we could try it again?” he queried.
“Really, John, this is rather inconvenient.”
John hasn’t said anything so far, he’s simply impersonating a deer in the proverbial headlights, because, well, what do you say when your flatmate explodes into your room ready for murder and mayhem just as you’re getting started on a good wank?  Despite his years in the army, and the habits of stealth they imbued, John is unprepared for this particular scenario.  After opening and shutting his mouth a few times, he manages to croak out “there’s a door, Sherlock.  It’s a wooden thing on hinges that creates privacy.”
John's eyes flickered over to him and then back to the street. " It's November 5th."

“Did he finally tell you?” Greg’s voice was lower to avoid being overheard.
Story: Mycroft’s fever breaks and he’s starting to recover.
Sherlock had closed his eyes. “Mm. Your bread smells excellent, by the way.”
“Self-absorbed?” John scoffed. “I just sucked you off not two minutes ago. How is that self-absorbed?”
“Good idea, genius.” John clapped him on the shoulder before walking with him to their front door to get his shoes and for Sherlock to get his pants.
Sherlock wrapped his arms tightly around John and closed his eyes, his world shrinking to the small area in the second lab of Bart’s that contained exactly one John Watson and one Sherlock Holmes-to-be-Holmes-Watson. Exactly three minutes later, he released John and tapped his shoulder. “I’m done, let go.” Once John let go, Sherlock knelt in front of him, swiped his hand under the desk and straightened, holding the ring in his hand. “Found it. I believe it’s traditional for the person who asked to place it themselves.”
Sherlock collapsed back onto the bed, gasping, his hands trembling slightly as he pulled the sheet back and John crawled up his body before falling onto the bed next to him, breathing heavily. A thin sheen shone on his lips and Sherlock leaned over and kissed it away, licking into his mouth before pressing kisses to his lips and down the side of his face along his cheekbone. His hand trailed over John’s chest. He murmured into John’s skin as his hand trailed lower. “Can I?”
“Degree of tension in the pectoral muscles and the slight discolouration of the toes.”
“Watson.” Sherlock laid a calming hand on her shoulder, startled at her audacity.

He quickly transferred the bread to the waiting wire rack and turned off the oven. He looked at his freshly made loaf and grinned. Now, to wait a bit before tasting it, the real test if this had all been worth it or just a giant waste of time.
Chapter Summary:
A smile twitched in the corner of John's mouth. "What did you think we were doing?"
“You’re such a dick.” John shook his head fondly and filled the kettle up from the tap. “Did Rosie go to bed alright?”
Sherlock grasped his hand and allowed himself to be pulled to the sofa and cuddled. The twenty minutes passed quickly. Once the timer went off, John reluctantly untangled himself and moved into the kitchen to silence its blaring and pull his bread out. He set it on the stovetop and gently pried the bread up off the stoneware. He tapped on the bottom. The instructions said to tap and if it sounded hollow, it was done.

. He followed and maneuvered himself in front of Sherlock as they headed upstairs, purposefully guiding them to the lab where they first met.
Watson looked at the bags before pointing. “That one.”
Suddenly, Sherlock swept into the living room, fresh from completing a case, his cheeks rosy and his eyes bright.
“Then why won’t you let me touch you.” Sherlock raised himself up on his elbow and looked down at John. “You don’t let me touch you at all anymore. Have I done something to offend you with the way I do it?”

Having the other in their life
The wind rustled through John’s short blond-grey hair. He closed his dark blue eyes for a moment against the wind before opening them again and looking out over the grey city he has come to know so well. He used to feel something for the city, fondness, loyalty, something. Anything. He hasn’t felt anything for quite some time.
Sherlock hummed in agreement before shifting closer and deepening the kiss. John reciprocated for a moment before placing a hand on Sherlock’s chest and pushing him away gently. “There’s something I really do need to talk to you about.”
“How is it not?” Sherlock snapped back at him. “If you don’t enjoy it, why do you do it?”
Letting a smile back onto his face, John relaxed into Sherlock, head resting on his chest, just listening to his heartbeat. “That’s fine by me. I’m here and will be for quite a long while yet, my fiance.” A chuckle escaped him. “My fiance. God, that sounds good.” He rubbed a soothing hand up and down Sherlock’s spine. “Let me know when you’re done processing.”

Sherlock paused for a moment when he saw it. “John, I’ll be perfectly fine. I’ll have gloves on the entire time and I’ll even bring one of those pocket hand sanitizers. Satisfied?”
“There’s no other traces of blue paint within one hundred meters.”
Sherlock gaped at him. “
“But whyyy.” Rosie fussed; her forehead crinkled. “I want to give him a kiss.”
Sherlock waved a hand at him. “It’s fine. Transport. Besides, you’re going to bed.”
As he ran a hand through the golden curls of their daughter where she rested against him, Sherlock breathed deeply and closed his eyes, feeling the warm sunlight against his face. They would make it through. Somehow.
“But I’ll catch you. I’ll catch you. Not like in the book. I want to catch you.”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed. “Why are you behaving this way? Is this why none of your other partners wanted to stay with you? Your irritating self-absorbed perception of life?”
Sherlock watched him go, the feeling in his throat growing tighter and tighter with every step John took away from him.
Sherlock gave him a questioning look before folding the book and tucking it between his arm. “I’ll only be a minute. Yell if he bothers you.”
John smiled down at him. “Yes. Sleep.”

The schools in the UK have closed. All pubs, restaurants, gyms, and social venues have closed.
Sherlock faltered. “Oh. Do.. Do you not want me to go to bed with you?”

Rosie sighed softly and nodded, wrapping her pinky finger around Sherlock’s. “Okay.”
John’s jaw tightened and he looked at the detective across the room. “He didn’t mention that.”
“Yes, yes!” she cried, enthusiastically clapping her small hands as she stood in front of him.
Sherlock smiled and kissed his neck again, tightening his arms. “We’re going to be fine.”
About an hour earlier, John had sat in his chair, enjoying the Saturday morning, drinking his morning cuppa and watching a previous episode of The Great British Bake Off on his laptop.
“Shut up.” John muttered gruffly and turned back to the recipe. He set aside the 1/3 section and moulded the dough as instructed, folding it and pressing it down and eventually rounding it out, spinning it in his hands along the floured area as he smoothed the top and tucked the dough under the bottom.

Story: Doctors are using bin bags as protective measures. Working 13 hours a day. John is constantly on call and working overtime. He facetimes with Sherlock at the end of a shift and says how utterly exhausted he is and how hard it is to say that they’re doing their best but are they? The equipment is not enough and old and it’s so hard to provide the protection they need to take care of these people. But it’s a great comfort that Sherlock, Rosie, and Mrs. H are safe during this time.
The ending is not very realistic, but I can only reflect life so much. We move out of this moment and into a future where the end of COVID is in sight. Please stay warm during this holiday season and make safe choices! xx
John blinked. “… Thank you.” He grabbed the bottle of olive oil from the counter and looked back at Sherlock. “Are… are you turned on right now?”
Sherlock straightened and huffed. “Fine then, what?”
07:45 Sherlock
“I know.”
Sherlock set his jaw. “Fine.”
06:53 John
John set the dough aside and repeated the action with the smaller section of dough, creating two semi-identical spheres of dough. Brushing the flour off his hands, John pulled out a round baking stone from the drawer under the oven and sprinkled flour on top, rubbing it in gently. He plopped the larger sphere on the bottom before settling the smaller one gently on top. He glanced at the instructions and hesitated. He glanced at Sherlock before quickly flouring his finger and plunging it through the top centre of the tower of bread dough and pressed it down all the way to the bottom. His finger met with some resistance, but he pushed until it sank deeply into the dough. With a slight bit of effort, he pulled his finger out, which left a puckered hole in the top of the dough.
18:51 Sherlock
In the crumpled ruins of their lives,
It hadn’t been real.
“It is what it is.”
“For a while.” John moved away from him towards the bedroom. “I… I need to go out.”
His lips twitched. “Mm, yes, precisely.” He set her down after kissing the top of her head. “Why don’t you go up to your room and play for a bit, hm? I’ll call you when dinner’s ready. Then you can show, Daddy your socks, alright? I don’t think he was paying attention just now.”
. His hands shook as he silenced the phone. John checked over his shoulder to make sure Sherlock didn’t wake to the sound. Sherlock shifted softly in the blankets but otherwise remained asleep. Carefully crawling out of bed, John headed to the kitchen. Once in the hall, he took a deep breath, trying to calm his nerves before starting the more elaborate breakfast he had planned, all of Sherlock’s favorites. Toast with honey, bacon, and 3-minute eggs. He just hoped that he could get it all done before Sherlock woke up.
“I’m holding out for a hero until the morning light.”
Sherlock unlocked the cabinet and removed the items he needed. “No. Can’t. This is time-sensitive. Need to get results before those idiots at Scotland Yard do. Shouldn’t be hard, but no reason to give them an unnecessary head start.” Sherlock locked the cabinet back up and tossed the keys onto the tray beside Molly. “Upstairs, John, let’s go.” He swooped out of the room, letting the door swing closed behind him.
Once they reached the wide expanse of green, Sherlock found a somewhat secluded spot and set down the stroller. He and Rosie spent the rest of the afternoon chasing after one another in the fresh air. Sherlock made sure to stay just out of her reach until the height of the chase, when he allowed himself to be caught and tumbled to the grass, Rosie flinging herself on top of him. Eventually, after a final capture, Rosie threw herself onto Sherlock’s chest and nuzzled against him, curling up in his arms. He lay back against the green and gazed up at the sky, catching his breath and holding Rosie close. Her mask had come off during the chase and he had tucked it away in his pocket. He wasn’t worried about exposure, since they had been playing so far from others. For a few hours, he had managed to forget about the predicament of the world. Looking at the bright blue sky helped ease the claustrophobic terror building in his chest, the fear of the unknown. Without John to ground him, the world seemed perilously abstract. That morning, John had called him at first light to inform him that the initial three-week estimate was a gross miscalculation. Instead of another week of separation, there would be at least another four weeks. The news had crushed Sherlock’s spirit and endurance, leading to a stressful morning where everything Watson did felt like an antagonistic reminder that there would be no reprieve anytime soon. No quick return from John to make the moments pass easier. It would continue to be him and Watson for another four weeks.
John smiled slightly back. “I’ll text you later.”
husband’s
Once she was properly bundled up, Sherlock hefted her collapsible stroller over one shoulder and walked outside with Rosie, closing and locking the door behind them. Thoroughly covered with their coat and gloves, Sherlock shifted his jaw under the paper mask he had put on, feeling it slide down on his face and glanced at the mask he had placed on Rosie. She hated it but was dutifully not playing with it after he had been very firm with her about it. He felt ridiculous, but John had been quite forceful in his insistence. At least they were able to go outside. With a deep breath, Sherlock hiked Rosie up onto his hip and they set off down the road towards Regent’s park.
Sherlock snuggled further against his side and nodded. “Mhm… night..” His breathing evened out again.
18:50 John
to take care of it. It’s not a matter of convenience, it’s a matter of desire. I want to touch you, John. I want to bring you off the same way you do with me. It’s not fair.”
“I do. It’s just… no one seems to be reacting this extremely.”
15.51 Sherlock
John huffed. “Don’t be stupid, Sherlock. What would you do with Rosie?”
“You have been ridiculed by nearly everyone you’ve ever met, you have lost your home and your reputation, you have been tortured and killed and tortured some more.”
“I know.”
John’s knees cracked as he made his way lower to the ground to look.
It was a quiet evening at Baker Street. Sherlock sat in the sitting room; legs criss crossed on his chair with his laptop in his lap. He hunched over the screen, the light tapping of the keys filling the otherwise quiet space as he worked on developing an article on poisons and the liver.
Sherlock shifted on the bed, wrapping an arm around John’s shoulders and the other around his torso and pulled him close into a tight embrace, tucking John’s head under his chin. “Hush.”
Sherlock hummed thoughtfully.
John smiled and gently pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s cheek, his nose, his eyebrow, his other cheek, and finally his lips. “Mm. Indeed.”
John nodded and held out his hand. “You’re my hero, Sherlock Holmes.”
John let his hand fall away from Sherlock’s head.
“You can, John.” Sherlock murmured. “Leave the hospital.”
“I don’t think I can do this anymore.” John flinched away from him.
21:19 John
John held up a hand. “Don’t use that tone of voice with me, as if I’m the only one in this family who has ever spent money on ridiculous things, Mr. I-have-to-have-my-coat-dry-cleaned-twice-a-week.”
Sherlock eyes flickered up to him. “John’s concerned about the new virus.” He knelt beside the corpse and reached out a hand to dab at the paint.

“What time is it?” John squinted at his watch in the dim morning light.
John closed his eyes for a moment and rubbed at his forehead. “I know, I know. Jesus, I know. I’m sorry.” The camera wobbled as John adjusted his grip on his phone. “I know you wouldn’t, and it was wrong of me to say it. I just… I would feel better if you let me do it. I’m already out here during this. And the stores will likely be crowded. I can run by Friday morning before work. And... maybe say hi in person from the curb? Would that be okay?”
Sherlock pushed him away angrily before immediately reaching out, grabbing his shirt and pulling him back into an embrace, wrapping his arms around John’s waist.
From a pale broad chest
Sherlock put down his plate. “Clearly something.”
“Overreacting? Italy is on lockdown!”
Sherlock’s lips twitched, remembering the section she was referring to, when Alec chased the black horse across the beach in an attempt to ride him, only to eventually lose the horse, unable to catch up with him. An elaboration of tag. “Ah, of course. Very well.”
Sherlock's forehead crinkled. "From what?"

“Good girl. Why don’t you take your biscuit, say goodbye to Daddy, and go upstairs? I’ll be right there. We can watch a bit of telly before breakfast.”
“Morning, love,” John said, sounding a bit strained from the nerves. He forced himself to act normal and turned his head to kiss Sherlock’s temple. Wet, dark curls tickled his nose. The smell of Sherlock calmed him more than anything else he had tried that morning. Relaxing into the body behind him, John rested his head on Sherlock’s shoulder and breathed in a clarifying breath, the food temporarily forgotten.
“Because, for some unconceivable reason, he fell in love with you. And now you have given him the idea, God above knows why, that you reciprocate his feelings.” Mycroft took a step closer.
John rolled his eyes and shook his head.
John nodded. “I will. I will.”
“Who?”
15.48 John
“Why not?” Sherlock pushed, stepping closer.
A smile touched the edges of John’s mouth. “Sleep well. Bye.”
Sherlock finally gets to video chat with John.
Together forever

Mycroft almost died, but survived his brush with COVID. There was going to be angst there about how he might die and Sherlock wouldn't get to say goodbye. Additional exploration of how their parents are handling quarantine where they live and that isolation.
After the last sounds of footsteps had disappeared, Sherlock turned back to John with a soft smile. He held out a hand to him, wiggling his newly adorned ring finger pointedly. “Husband-to-be.”
“Good riddance. I’ll be glad to have you to myself for a while.” Sherlock waved a hand and picked a triangle of toast off John’s plate. He looked up and paused at the expression on John’s face. “What.”
John nodded, keeping his gaze on Sherlock’s clavicle and avoiding his eyes. Their hands held on to each other tightly. “I didn’t think… you did this. That you liked people like that.”
When John looked up at Sherlock, he found an expression there that he normally only saw in the privacy of Baker St.

“Because I don’t want you to!”
07.20 John
“You said you trust me.” John brushed a hand through Sherlock’s hair.
John nodded, before turning to Greg and smiling tightly. “Yeah. Good that he’s happy.”
A noise came from the background of John’s video and he looked up briefly before looking back at his phone. “I have to go. But I’ll text you tomorrow, yeah? And text me with yours and Mrs. H’s grocery lists.”
Sherlock grumbled and shuffled forward, seeking John’s mouth with his own, but John placed a restraining hand on his chest and looked to the side.
Sherlock stood and clapped his hands. “Right. Watson, let’s go get you dressed. We’re going outside.”
John faltered and Sherlock cut in, squeezing his arm around her waist. “We’ll have to see, Watson. Daddy might be busy saving lives tonight. But we’ll see if we can call him some other time, alright?”
“You busy?” John cleared his throat again.
He stood up quickly and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist. “Love, what’s...what’s wrong? What did I do?” He leaned back and brushed the curls out of Sherlock’s face.
“And they have bees on them.”
Sherlock walked back across the room, giving both John and Molly looks. “You congratulated John. Why? John hasn’t done anything worth congratulating.” He gave John a scrutinizing look. “You haven’t. Have you? No. You haven’t. Why were you congratulating him?”
John’s eyes flashed open. “I can’t just do that, Sherlock. You have to stop asking. People need me here.”
John nodded. “There’s another pile bags downstairs. I’ll be back in a mo. Hello, sweetheart!” He waved his fingers at Rosie who had hopped up and come to stand next to Sherlock’s leg, holding on to his trousers.

18:35 Sherlock
John decided to head to the vending machine to calm his nerves with some food, not having had enough this morning during the interrupted breakfast. It would give him a chance to rehearse his speech again, and perhaps add a phrase or two now that they were here instead.
“Then what, pray tell, is the problem.” Mycroft’s tone sharpened. “I hope you realise what will befall you if you harm my brother again.”
“Daddy is silly.” Rosie said very seriously, surveying the kitchen.
“Why, John?” Sherlock kissed his neck. “I love doing it. I love touching you in any way. I adore you. I adore everything about you.”
They had lived without each other
The concept for this fic was to follow Sherlock, Rosie, and John's journey along the major events that occurred during the pandemic. Those events became far too frequent and too many for me to follow.
And in the aftermath of the wars
“Well, it’s spreading quite a bit faster than they thought it would. The cases in the UK just doubled to 87.”
“You don’t what?”
Sherlock shrugged. "So?"
“Just because the rest of the world is learning how to bake during quarantine does not mean this is something that must extend to you.” Sherlock crossed his arms and leaned against the doorframe.
Thank you for reading! Questions, comments, and critiques are always welcome.
“You don’t know that.” John clenched his jaw. “You don’t know that at all. It could be nothing or this could be big.”
“And yet, you’re still standing here in front of me.” John looked up at him again. “Just
Sherlock’s back straightened. “I was going to put her in her pack n play in the downstairs foyer. Mrs. H would leave her door open. I’m not stupid, John. I know that everything would need to be disinfected. But Rosie needs her milk and Mrs. Hudson needs groceries as well.”
6 people have died in the UK, 373 have tested positive.

“’Fraid so. I’m sorry, darling. I’m in the on-call room tonight and someone else just came in to sleep. But text me tomorrow, alright?”
“Darling, this isn’t a dream.” John whispered softly into his hair.
John was tense for a moment before closing his eyes and relaxing into the embrace, pressing his face against Sherlock’s collar bone.
John sighed. “Alright, fine. Okay. She still in there?”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“I don’t think you give yourself enough credit, John.” Sherlock shifted his hands to hold onto John’s shoulders.
A breath and a kiss
Real life: UK extends government lockdown for at least three more weeks
Sherlock straightened. “What are you saying? Do you think they’re going to catch it? 87 cases are not that many. There are nearly nine million people living in London, John.”
Down the hall, John took the moment away to gather his thoughts and down some crisps, giving him enough of a breather to regain some of his confidence. He straightened his spine, wiped the crumbs off against his trousers, and strode back towards the lab.
22:46 Sherlock
“No, I don’t think he noticed, honestly. This is the one thing he hasn’t been able to pick up on. It’s a bit strange actually.”
19:54 Sherlock
Wrapping an arm around his fiance, John pulled Sherlock flush against him, letting his hand travel to Sherlock’s arse. With a teasing smack to the plush backside, John placed a wet kiss to Sherlock’s jaw. “Race you to the bedroom?” he said with a wink and bolted down the hall, Sherlock following close after, locking the door firmly behind them. There would be no further celebrating tonight fit for the public eye.
Molly turned to John and smiled. “Congratulations!”

Chapter Summary:
Sherlock sighed softly, wrapping his arms around John’s waist. After just a moment, he nudged John’s cheek with his nose. “Bored.”
They stood side by side in silence for a moment, looking at the chaos that had erupted so unexpectedly. Sherlock cleared his throat. “So… did you forget that when glass changes temperatures abruptly-”
Sherlock sat on the floor of the entryway, pulling the groceries into the house and wiping them down before setting them aside. “It has seemed like much longer. This is the longest we’ve been apart since-”
Sherlock huffed against John’s shirt and John rolled his eyes. “He’s having a bit of a temper tantrum, Rosie. He didn’t know I was going to live somewhere else for a while, so he’s a bit surprised.”

“Thanks for coming to take a look. Nice gloves.”
“Absurd. You bring the risk of bringing that virus back here. Why should I stay home if you’re going to continue working?” Sherlock sat back in his chair.
Sherlock set the socks on the armrest of his chair, stood, and stepped towards him. “You’re actually concerned about this.”
John shifted his weight. “It’s... it’s that new virus, the coronavirus. Covid-19. That’s what they’re calling it.”
“I think we both do.” John stood and went into the kitchen. “If you’re still hungry, you can keep eating.”
Sherlock blinked, recognizing the characters from their nightly reading of
WHO announces that COVID-19 is officially a pandemic.
“Not yet. I want the best for my family, Sherlock. I’ll do whatever it takes to keep you safe. And I already discussed things with Mrs. Hudson. She agrees with me that it’s best for everyone’s safety. And we can video chat, and I can still do the shopping if I have the time off. I could even talk to you from the pavement.”
Story: Mycroft is ill and is in a private room at Bart’s seeing specialists. John is there as well.
John shrugged. “It is what it is.”
15.51 John
Sherlock gingerly extended his right foot. “I don’t think it’s very big. But it does hurt.”
“You.” John stood quietly, looking at him.
“Three weeks.”
“Are you ready, Watson?” Sherlock called out as he stood near the open window, a breeze blowing the gauzy curtains inward. A sense of awkward uncertainty hung over him, impossible to dislodge despite the pleasant touch of air against his cheek. Rosie ran in from the kitchen where she had been tacking up her latest artwork on the fridge with magnets. Her wild, eager approach eased the tension in his chest, caused by the discomfort of not having John at his side.
50 days
Sherlock ducked under the yellow tape, weaving away from the two officers. “ID badge under his shirt! Text me with any developments, but I’m not leaving my flat! Don’t come ‘round!” He hopped back in the cab and shut the door. “Baker Street.”
Sherlock grimaced and reached around John to pick up a piece of bacon. “Boring. I don’t like it when you have to talk to me about something. Always means I’ve done something unfortunate.” He grabbed another piece and walked around the kitchen table and plopped himself into his seat.
Sherlock gave her a look before moving towards the chemical solutions cabinet. “It was an easy case, no need for congratulations. Heart attack?”
A few moments after John left, Sherlock stretched his arm out under the blankets, reaching for him. When he realized there was an absence of a warm body, Sherlock grudgingly opened his eyes. He growled low in his chest at the absence of his John and huffed softly. Gathering the comforter around him, he took it with him into the bathroom and started the shower.
18:37 Sherlock
Holding tight, John prevented Sherlock from getting up. “It’s fine, Sherlock. We can’t have lost it. We’ll both look for it, ok?” He helped Sherlock stand before getting onto all fours instead, starting to scour the floor for the glitter of brushed gold metal.
“Please, be safe.”
. You can catch up to where I left off last night.”
“How long.”
“Come off it, don’t be upset. You can always ask me when you need a bit of a cuddle.” Sherlock’s voice was soft and infinitely fond, murmuring next to John’s ear. “I’m never too busy for you.”
A heart has ever held
John looked up from the kitchen table where he was covered up to his elbows in flour. “I’m making bread.”
Sherlock gave an agonized groan that caused John to swat at him again. “Well,
“I’m sure it’ll be nothing.”
“Oh, shove off, will you? Go watch more of

Sherlock's breath caught in his throat at John's close proximity. His blue eyes were so close, looking calmly into his. He could feel the soft heat of John's breath across his chin. "I didn't think we were running away from it."
As they kissed, John closed his eyes and held Sherlock tighter, suddenly feeling strong again.

With a dramatic sigh, Sherlock peeled himself off John’s back and trudged back into the living room.

“Thanks. Bye.” John waved slightly, taking a few steps backwards before swiveling and walking down the street away from Baker Street.

John’s shoulders hunched. “Yes. Thank you.”
John paled. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
John nodded. “I mean, a little. Especially since we have Mrs. Hudson downstairs and she’s eighty-two now. And we have Rosie.”
“Morning, Papa!” Rosie waved at him from her seat at the kitchen table.
18:00 Sherlock
She nodded, looking at him. “Are you saving lots of people at the hospital?”
Were destined to be.
“Hey, you.” John smiled softly; his eyes weighted with exhaustion. White headphones were nestled into his ears and the cord ran down towards his chest. Deep red lines scored his cheeks, mirrored on each side as well as a red abrasion beginning to form on his nose. The lines were offset against his pale skin and ruffled blonde-grey hair.
“It’s just holding hands.” Sherlock looked up at him from where he was sitting, his eyes heavy.
“Very good.” Sherlock grabbed the tub of antibacterial wipes and wiped down the bag and the roll of biscuits before handing it to Rosie. “You may have two.”
“John.” Sherlock pulled him close and wrapped his arms around him. “I know you’re worried. But they’re going to get this under control. It’s going to be alright. No one here is going to die.”

John’s face softened and he knelt on the pavement outside to be closer to her eye level. “Hello, sweetheart. Have you been having fun with Papa?”

Sherlock sulked, resting his forehead against John’s chest. “I’m not worried about that. You begged me to marry you; I have no reservations about your loyalty.”
round of applause for NHS staff.
Leading them down the hall, he opened the door and let Sherlock in first. Sherlock brushed past him and settled at his favourite microscope to examine the product on the hairs he picked up at the scene. As John watched Sherlock set up his solutions and prepped his slides, he shuffled aimlessly, nerves racking up again. He bumped into a metal stool, and the feet scrapped noisily across the ground. John winced at the noise and leaned against the counter instead, thrumming his fingers against the tabletop in an agitated pattern.
“John, you’re exhausted.”
“I know.” John shook his head. “It’s just, this is turning into a bigger thing than I thought it was going to be. We’ll just need to watch it closely.”
John rested a hand on Sherlock’s arm. “It’ll just be a minute, love, and I’m sure whatever Mycroft has to say will be horribly boring.”

John did not disappoint and kissed him tenderly if briefly in greeting before nuzzling his face in Sherlock’s hair. “Hello, darling.”
Story: Sherlock has a meltdown because John was only supposed to be gone for a month, then two months, now it’s predicted to be up to six months. John reassures him that it’s probably more like the beginning/mid May. Then he’ll be home.

“You sound like a child.”
Dark curls swishing
“Hiya!” John called back as he reached the top of the stairs. He toed his shoes off and walked into the kitchen, heavily yoked with shopping bags.
“St. Bart’s hospital.”
John’s jaw clenched and he swallowed, seeing Sherlock’s offered cheek. He strode over and pressed a soft kiss to Sherlock’s cheekbone, lingering for just a moment. As he about-faced to walk away, Sherlock’s hand reached out and grabbed his wrist.
“Yeah, I know.”
From the lost touch of hands
John tilted his head and acquiesced.
Forty more minutes later, John got his answer in the form of a half-eaten loaf of beautiful white bread. He and Sherlock had quickly devoured thick warm slices of the perfectly textured bread with a light crispy crust smothered in copious amounts of creamy rich butter. They even plucked a few leaves from Chester and laid them on top of the butter and created literal heaven. It had been the most Sherlock had eaten in several days and the most bread John had eaten in… most likely his entire life. But it was incredibly worth it. Definitely worth all the waiting and the kneading and the glass explosion and the shard in Sherlock’s foot (as stated by said man). John settled happily on the sofa with Sherlock after they had finished, full and content. “Tomorrow, I’m going to try to make a Victorian sponge cake.”
“I want to talk to him too.”
“I hope you’re getting rest.”
“The body.” Lestrade sighed.
Sherlock huffed and shot a glare in his direction. “Why are you like this today, John? Whatever it is on your mind, go take a walk and come back when you’re capable of existing quietly.”
Sherlock nodded. “As you wish, Watson.”
Despite adversity
“Thank you for that lovely recap. Not quite killed, John.”
As the light from the windows landed on him, illuminating the sharp curvature of his cheekbones, the deep green blue of his eyes, the smart curling of his hair and the contrasting smooth sharp lines of his clothing, he smiled and his long coat swirling around him in the doorway like a cape. He stood in the doorway, his eyes meeting John’s and John felt his knees weaken at the sight of the beautiful strong man before him.
15.46 Sherlock
“Of course. And you certainly can.” Sherlock straightened and took her tiny hand in his. “Ready?”
To lost dreams of brushed lips
“I’ll go. I’ll go to the shops tomorrow and pick up whatever you need and drop it off by the front door, okay?” John ran his hand over his face, rubbing at his eyes. “Please, just stay inside.”
Feeling John starting to shift away, Sherlock held on tightly and interrupted his movements by responding quickly. “Your hand feels remarkable on my waist, please don’t.” John’s movements stilled and Sherlock pressed his face against John, mumbling the rest of his words. “I… I am afraid if I go to sleep, this will turn out to have been just a dream. And I couldn’t bear it, John. Being so close and knowing it wasn’t real.”
Sherlock froze and John could feel his heartbeat quickening beneath his hand in a frantic symphony of staccatos. “I shouldn’t have-” John closed his eyes tightly.

John turned his head over his shoulder to look at it. “Quite the little modern artist we’re raising.”

“Morning, sunshine. Sorry to call you so early, but we’ve got a body for you in Lambeth.”
Sherlock nodded. “Be safe.”
John wrapped his arms tightly around Sherlock, holding tightly onto his shirt and pulling him close. He pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s chest and rested his forehead against Sherlock’s clavicle. “I love you. It’s my job to protect you.”
John nodded and watched the tea seep. “I bought her this pair of socks today. I saw them in a shop window and they reminded me of you and I thought she would like them. They’re in my coat pocket.”
“I know.” Sherlock met his gaze for a moment before lowering his eyes. “I apologise.”
“It’s like the beach. You be Black and I’m Alec.”
It had only been 12 days, but already it had begun to feel like a lifetime. The drudgery of March was never-ending and while Sherlock adored spending time with Rosie, there was such a thing as too much of a good thing. And he was quickly approaching his limit of exactly how much more he could handle of being cooped up in Baker Street with a child who had a seemingly unending source of energy that rivaled his own. After grinding his fingernails into the flesh of his thigh through his pajamas trousers to prevent himself from snapping at Watson, for God’s sake please stop humming the plinky little theme song to
You didn’t realise how much he cared about you? I find that difficult to believe. You are a slow man, Dr. Watson, but not a stupid one.”
Mycroft’s watchful eyes never left John’s face. “Brother mine, I do believe Cook has prepared your favourite biscuits today. If you would be so kind as to fetch a plate of them from the kitchen.”
Having gotten rid of his distraction of a partner, John continued with mixing the ingredients together with his hand, grimacing slightly at how sticky the mixture was. It was clumping between his fingers and squishing as he continued mixing. He lifted his hand to try and remove the gooey dough from his fingers and it merely got attached to his other hand. With a brief eyeroll to the heavens, John plunged both hands into the bowl

John tried for a smile and one flickered across his face. He tried again, smiling up at Sherlock. “Nothing, my love. Come have a sit and let me see that book.”

“Tomorrow, I think. If you can manage. The sooner the better so I don’t bring back the virus.”
A gentle breath
Sherlock hesitated. “Could we not… hold hands? I could immediately disinfect afterwards.”
After a moment, John glanced backwards and saw him standing there. He tilted his head slightly in invitation and Sherlock felt his feet treading over the wood and carpet towards his... John. He stood next to him and peered out into the empty street. He saw nothing that could have captured John's attention so. He glanced at him out of the corner of his eye. John was so tense, his pulse was visible, throbbing on his neck. Sherlock wished he could feel it with his lips, apply gentle pressure, ease it back to a calm heart rate, feel the tension in John's stance ease. "Are you alright?"
Sherlock tried to reach out and grab him, but John shook him off. Sherlock followed him down the stairs. “John. John! John, please!”
John huffed, hand on the kettle. “Sherlock, I can’t shower every day. At this rate, I’ll scrub all my skin off to please your nose.”

Sherlock crouched next to the body and bellowed, “Evidence bag and glove!” He held out his hand. A nearby forensic officer hastily rushed forward and held out a bag and gloves. Sherlock snatched them from her and leaned forward, pulling the glove onto his left hand. He reached out and carefully picked stands from the body and placed them into the evidence bag. He stood and briskly walked back towards the main street. “John, come.”
"We can't run away from it."

"I love you." Sherlock gasped softly. "I love you." Their lips met again and again in soft sweet presses.
Before they left the room, Sherlock stopped them to dig into John’s pocket for his phone. After sending a text to Lestrade, he slipped the phone into his own pocket and tucked his hand back into John’s. “Home.”
15.52 John
Sherlock was sitting in the living room, curled up in his chair. He was basking in the peace and quiet of the flat now that Rosie was asleep in bed and waiting for John to return from St. Bart’s Hospital where he now worked at as an attending. The career shift had been an adjustment for them both but had swiftly became a vital compromise in their new lives, allowing them each their own career. Sherlock glanced up at the picture centred on the mantle of John, Rosie, and himself.  It had been taken the day of their wedding, almost a year previously. Sherlock smiled at the memory. It had been one of the happiest moments of his life, gaining not only a husband, but a daughter. They had spent the last year finding their routine with John’s new job and despite their occasional squabble between them or a temper tantrum from Rosie, Sherlock knew that he loved both of them more every day.
A small smile quirked Sherlock’s lips. “I have much to live for.”
06:55 Sherlock
Sherlock glanced at his wristwatch. “Two fifteen.”
“I’m saving lives.”
John nodded once before running a hand through his hair. He sighed softly before turning to pour the boiling water into the mugs over the tea bags. “I’m sorry for snapping at you.”
“Well, I’ll be filming you, so he’ll hear you either way.” Sherlock’s lips twitched. “Ready?”
“Boring.” Sherlock yawned into the phone.
The announcement is made that all UK schools shall she down on the 20th.
Chapter Summary:
And soft grey blond
“You’re acting strangely, John. Are you feeling alright?” Sherlock munched on the bacon pieces. “Bring me more bacon!”
John hesitated. “Not for a while, I’m afraid. But you have Papa here to keep you company. You won’t really miss me that much.” He winked at her.
John winced. “Well, I’m going to keep working at the hospital.”
“Bodies always make him chipper, Greg.” John turned his eyes back to watch his partner swish his coat backwards and kneel on the floor besides the corpse.
Sherlock turned his head and pressed a quick kiss to John’s lips before standing. “Quite sure. Text me or talk to me before you leave for work. When is it, seven thirty today?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Come into the kitchen. I wasn’t done with breakfast.” John took his hand and led him into the kitchen. “It has to do with the hospital.”
When the timer went off one hour later, John was ready, standing by. He had been very successful in cleaning the bedroom and was now dressed in pyjama pants and a soft t-shirt that was one of Sherlock’s favourites for him to wear because it “clings to all your muscles so beautifully, John”. He was pretty sure the pyjama pants were actually Sherlock’s because they felt just a little too large and he had had to roll up the legs into cuffs at the bottom. He needed to laundry soon. John filled a liquid measuring cup with 2 cups of cold water and opened the oven. He carefully slid the flour-dusted bread into the top rack, slipped on an oven mitt and slid the glass Pyrex and its rack out slightly to add the water. It was necessary to create the steam to… John wasn’t exactly sure why, but it was in the instructions. He tipped the measuring cup over and cold water poured out. As soon as it hit the hot glass of the Pyrex, it sizzled, startling John slightly. But it created steam, as intended, so he tipped the measuring cup further, pouring a thicker stream of water onto the glass. Suddenly, the glass cracked and shattered! Shards and cubes of glass exploded apart, crashing through the metal spokes of the rack and flinging pieces onto the tile floor with a thunderous crash.
“Sorry, what?”
John pauses in his contortions to consider Sherlock through slitted eyes.  The bastard appears to be serious.
John soldiers on, digging lightly into the muscles, back to feathering, then long smooth heavy strokes like a tidal pull, then rapping lightly with his knuckles, heavier with the curved tips of his fingers, then lifting the muscles away from bone and sinew, rattling them with both hands, then back to heavy pressure –
Then Sherlock watched, appalled, as John’s brilliance dimmed bit by bit until finally all that was left was a soft glow, and he smiled at Sherlock affectionately, and for once Sherlock’s inner commentary was missing, running amok somewhere on the sidelines where Sherlock would never find it until it was too late, and Sherlock huddled miserably alone as John made love to him sweetly and carefully, and afterwards murmured comforting phrases in Sherlock’s ear and kissed his forehead and twined one hand into Sherlock’s curls and Sherlock fell asleep sheltered against John’s chest and dreamt of rain falling onto thin leaves and dripping into the muddy ground.
Sherlock was aware of John eyes on his face, and now John wasn’t just radiating, he was burning tiny holes in Sherlock’s skin, lines of tender smoking invisible scars.
John’s laying on his back, a pillow propped under his head.  True, he had just been thinking about Sherlock, but the Sherlock in his head was a bit softer around the edges.  Less inclined to root through his wardrobe, flinging unacceptable disguises right and left, and more inclined to, well, John hadn’t exactly got to that  part yet, but the immediate Sherlock isn’t an improvement.
“I didn’t mean it, the pushing,” Sherlock continued.  “It’s just, there’s so much. It all crashes in on me.”
“It’s only for an hour, John.  Then the plan goes on.  You go back to Mrs. Hudson and the funeral and make your appearance in therapy.”
“Don’t tell me, someone’s been murdered by mini propane torch…?” John persisted.
know,” snaps Sherlock.  “
W: Please talk to me.
But now, Thursdays, he knew that not everything was possible after all.
Everything was lovely for quite a while.
‘Morning you,’ murmured John.
“I did something with my hand that upset you?” John queries calmly, and Sherlock
Thursdays are quiet.  John can feel the worry in Sherlock when he wakes in the morning, and he knows that Sherlock will distance himself most of the day.  At first John tries to talk his way out of weekly physical relations, out of any physical relations at all, but that seems to make Sherlock even more tightly wound and worried, and god help him, John wants this too much to really make his point.  But he is slow and careful to a fault.  He runs through both lists of What Sherlock might like, and tests out a few new entries that he has chosen during the preceding week.  He sees that Sherlock wants him to come first, so he obliges, and if Sherlock fades afterwards, John tries not to take it personally.
Sherlock hummed deeply in his chest and raised his eyebrows. “I was just thinking the same.
Mycroft folded his arms. “My brother, against all reason, has quite clearly fallen in love with you.” John looked immediately to the floor. “I see you are not unfamiliar with his feelings. Why, then, are you putting him through this? Giving him hope that you might someday return his feelings?”
“Conditioner on the hair strands will determine if it was the sister, which I firmly believe it is.” Sherlock raised his hand, and a cab pulled up to the curb. He opened the door for John while leaning forward towards the cabbie. “St. Bart’s Hospital.”
Sherlock gaped after him as John stood, wrapped himself in his dressing gown and walked out into the kitchen. After a minute he scrambled up himself and threw on his dressing gown and went after him. “John! You don’t get to walk away from this conversation!”
Sherlock’s mouth twitched and he popped open the wrapping. “Now, remember, just two. Can you sit right here while you eat them?”
John absently gave his other triangle of toast to Rosie who had been reaching her hand for it, before taking a deep breath. “I’m not, actually. I’m going to keep working. But I don’t think I should live here anymore. I don’t want to risk giving Mrs. H or Rosie or you the virus, so I’ve found a temporary flatshare near the hospital and I’m going to stay there until things get better. It should only be until the beginning of April, they’re saying.”
John’s brow furrowed. “What? No, you’re not bad at sex.”
“No, I apologise.” Sherlock murmured. “I know things are chaotic at the hospital. It’s not your fault.” Sherlock separated the groceries into two piles, one for them and one for Mrs. Hudson.
The air was crisp and cool with a smattering of grey clouds floating above them in the blue sky. After crossing the main road and navigating their way onto the grey paved paths of the park, Sherlock let Rosie slide down to walk herself, keeping a keen eye on their surroundings. There were quite a few people up and about and maintaining space from them would be paramount. He watched as Rosie crouched and walked slowly towards a gathering of pigeons close to the boating lake. His lips twitched in amusement as the pigeon she was attempting to get close to walked briskly away from the approaching child. “Watson, let’s walk a bit. I’m sure there will be more fowl to investigate further along the path.”
With a startled laugh, John grabbed Sherlock and pulled him down to sit on John’s knee, grabbing his face with both hands and kissing it all over. After a few moments, he realized there had been a metal tinkling sound and pulled back from Sherlock. “Did...did you drop the ring?” he asked, barely stifling giggles at the whole situation.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock nodded.
“Your heart stopped. That counts as being killed.”
“Because it feels fucking amazing to get sucked off!” John slammed one of the mugs down onto the counter.
Sherlock swatted at him with his towel. “Shut up. You say that every time. It’s not my fault my husband’s a brilliant physician. I do bend to your expertise in this area, John.”
He toed the line when his mother died because he hadn’t been quick enough returning home from getting groceries and she had choked to death on her own drunken vomit. When his father ended up in prison for manslaughter while driving drunk because John had been studying to take his final exam for med school and missed his call to come pick him up. When Harry broke up a marriage by sleeping with a man’s wife and then married her. He toed the line when friend after friend bled out beneath his hands under the scorching desert sun. When he failed to save his best friend Bill Murray in the field because he got shot in the bloody shoulder. When he couldn’t save his best friend again from jumping off a fucking building and shattering his skull on the pavement. When he beat his best friend, who had just come back from being tortured. When he stayed with his wife after he shot his best friend and he almost died forever. When he failed to save his wife from dying. When he tried to love Sherlock as he deserved to be loved. He had tried so bloody hard, but he knew that he would never be enough. He had never been enough. Sherlock deserved someone so much better than him, someone who had managed to succeed. Someone who could properly take care of him and love him properly, entirely.
John opened his mouth to reply, but Sherlock silenced him with a final kiss before rushing out the door.
Turning back to the table, he rubbed some flour onto the table’s surface and plopped the sticky dough onto the table. With a glance at his laptop, resting in front of him, screen glowing with the recipe, he started to knead the dough. He sprinkled a little flour on top and then pressed the heel of his left hand solidly into the center of the dough, miming the motions he had seen the bakers do on the show. He pressed his hand forward, rolling the dough out, then pulled the farthest edge, folded it back towards him, swiveled the dough 90° and repeated the action.
07:43 John
“Well, it’s dead.”
“Tell me what?” John glanced over at Sherlock.
John straightened. “Sherlock, get out of the kitchen.”
John rushed to set the table and remind himself of the speech he wanted to give. Tapping his pyjama pocket to check for the ring, he did his best to remain calm.
John’s forehead wrinkled and he closed his eyes tightly, his hands fisting in Sherlock’s shirt. “I-”
. He had barely relaxed when the timer in the kitchen went off. John groaned and went to get up before Sherlock laid a hand on his shoulder. “I’ll get it. It’s just turning the oven temperature down, correct?”
John’s heart clenched in his chest. “Right.”
“John…” Sherlock ducked his head towards John and stopped, hovering above John’s lips. “Please. Kiss me again.”
“And I can’t let you do that because it’s just not right. It’s not right for you to be doing any more for me. You’ve done so much for me and I just don’t deserve it.”
“I love you too.” Sherlock took a step closer, so they were only inches away from each other.
“I love you, John.”
“I was wrong to say what I did. You are here for her. For both of us.” Sherlock watched him quietly.
Pausing only for a moment, Sherlock wrapped John’s hand in his own, squeezing gently. “And you are mine.”
The surprise engagement party hadn’t remained much of a surprise after the actual engagement, but it turned out to be a surprisingly warm event filled with the people they loved: Molly, Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson, and Mycroft—though the latter was still in debate. All of the guests took just enough time to wish the new couple congratulations before making a timely exit, each carrying a box of the large selection of baked goods Mrs. Hudson had gifted them. The last to leave, Mycroft hesitated by the door in order to deliver some partially sentimental partially scathing final remark but was foiled by Sherlock shoving a box of scones into his hands and shutting the door in his face. “So long, fatty.”
John rolled onto his back and looked at the ceiling. “No. No, of course not. It’s just always easier to take care of it myself.”
John froze, his eyes wide, the measuring cup still mostly full of water in his hand. “Shit.”
15.55 Sherlock
“You are. Everything you’ve done… you’ve been doing it for me. You’ve been putting yourself through hell for me. And I’ve treated you horribly because of it. I am sorry.” John closed his eyes, his chin falling.
Sherlock nodded. “I love you too.”
“John??” Sherlock’s voice boomed from the other room in panic. “What the hell was-” he came around the corner, “-that.”
With glowing warmth by

A sleepy sigh
“Yeah, well, I would rather not listen to your stomach grumbling all night, alright? Just eat the rest of your food then you can come to bed.” John left and went into the bathroom, closing the door behind him, leaving Sherlock standing in the kitchen, holding a takeaway container in his hand and looking after him.
John set the bag on the table, grabbed Sherlock’s shoulders, about-faced him and shoved him towards the living room, giving him a parting smack on his buttocks. “Get
Mycroft’s eyes narrowed. “You didn’t realise how much my brother, who jumped off a building and spent two years in exile facing death and torture for
John blinked blearily. “Oh, shit, the bread.” He scrambled out of the bed and grabbed one of Sherlock’s dressing gown off the back of the door before stumbling towards the kitchen, his legs struggling to remember how to coordinate. He rolled up the sleeves and washed his hands at the sink before moving to the table and opening his laptop. He blinked at the screen before his brain finally caught up with his eyes and understood the instructions. He rubbed some flour onto the tabletop and plopped his risen dough onto the surface. John craned his neck over the table and muttered the directions to himself before glancing down at the dough.
Real life: Providing 100,000 COVID-19 tests a day.
“So, you’re together now?” Greg shuffled his hands into his pocket, eyes on Sherlock hovering over a corpse across the room.
“Alright, alright.” John took down two mugs. “You just sounded annoyed.”
John stood in the middle of Baker Street, his bare feet resting against the worn carpet. His hand clenching and unclenching by his leg. Rosie was downstairs with Mrs. Hudson. His entire life had crumpled yet again. That’s what it had always done.
Rosie tilted her head to look up at him from where she was seated on the floor playing with her horses. “What time is it?”
John hesitated for a moment. “Ah, yeah, well, I wanted to talk to you about that. But I stopped by the store first.”
06.57 John
John took a step into the room, stopping just inside the doorway. He rocked back on his heels, legs straight, hands stuffed into his trouser pockets. Tension ran across his shoulders and he felt a tingling sensation slither through his body, as if he were trying to crawl out of his skin. His right hand trembled slightly in his pocket. There was nothing to it, he’d just have to ask Sherlock for a hug. He could do it. He just had to speak up and ask. Just open his mouth and ask Sherlock for a hug. Easy. There was a crease in John’s forehead as he regarded the room before looking at Sherlock. Suddenly, he wished he were about to ask Sherlock to commit a criminal act instead. It would be easier. But he was being ridiculous, Sherlock was sure to say yes. It would just be a simple hug, only take a minute. A quick hug to ground him and get rid of all the stress that had built up from his horrible shift at the clinic today. He could do it. He just needed to ask. he cleared his throat gruffly.
Sherlock’s gaze flickered up to him. “What?”
When they arrived, Sherlock flew out of the cab, leaving John to pay.
A tightness formed in Sherlock’s throat. “Alright. Alright, do the shopping then come by. But only so Rosie and I can see you.”
“Surely not.” Sherlock came around the side and peered at the laptop screen. His eyes scanned the recipe, his lips muttering softly as he read. “Oh. So it is. How… strange.”
18:53 Sherlock
Sherlock went still at the movement, his hands not releasing from around John.
“You don’t know that, I have very vivid dreams, John.” Sherlock frowned into John’s shirt at the chuckle he felt vibrate through the warm man next to him.
Sherlock nodded. “When are you…” He swallowed before continuing. “Moving out?”
John blinked and looked down, forehead creasing in thought. “Probably would vary a bit, but that’s only because most brands have a different style and weave pattern. But most of us have the same kind.”
"God help me, I do." John kissed him again. "I do."
Rosie seemed placated and nodded. “Can I call you tonight?”
“Yeah.”
“Goodbye. Have a good shift.”
“When did it happen?”
Now, deep dark rumbles
when he was being sent away to certain death by his own brother. He was nearly drowned in a fight with an assassin, he got beaten brutally by his best friend after doing more drugs, then he was nearly murdered in a hospital bed. He was horribly rejected by his best friend on top of that and shoved into the trunk of a car by his landlady/surrogate mother. He was nearly blown up by his sister. Then, strangled and attacked by his sister. And his childhood home was blown to pieces. And yet the man was still going. He was standing in front of John brimming with life and energy and passion for continuing. Surely, he was not entirely human but contained some element of the supernatural about him.
The phone went dark and Sherlock slumped against the headboard. It had only been a week, but already it felt like a lifetime.
Sherlock got up from where he had settled on the sofa, watching the show and left the living room, moving towards their chairs and quietly into the kitchen to get a cup of water, when he stopped and stared. John’s shoulder muscles were rolling powerfully as he worked the dough on the tabletop, rotating which arm he kneaded with, one shoulder, then the other, working with intense concentration. Sherlock’s legs weakened and he was about to comment when John ceased and turned towards the counter and startled, seeing him. “Jesus, don’t sneak up on people like- why are you looking at me like that?”
Against the heartbeat
“It’s only been a week. How are you on groceries?”
John stood at the window, looking out into Baker Street. His arms were folded tightly, pressing tensely against his chest. His face was drawn and intense as he gazed resolutely outside.
“You know where the key is. We have to keep it locked now, so lock it back up when you’re done.”
Sherlock pulled back; his eyes wide. “You’ve already had this conversation with Watson? Without me?”
“It sounds premeditated, but I really only made the arrangements yesterday. Michael lives alone but he has an extra bedroom and a pull-out sofa, so Patrick and I are going to be kipping at his. We’ll each have our own bed and our own space. We’d hardly be there at the same time anyways. You don’t have anything to worry about.” John ran a hand through Sherlock’s hair.
John wrapped the dough and the stone round loosely in the new trash bag, making sure there was a significant air bubble in it to encourage inflation of the dough and set the timer for another hour.
John gave him a small tight smile before going back downstairs.
“Six. Go back to sleep, love.” Sherlock shrugged on his suit jacket. “Body drowned in paint in Lambeth. I’ll be back to watch Watson before you have to go in to work.”
Sherlock smirked and moved towards him, licking his lips. “Like I said, baking suits you.”
“Whoa, whoa, whoa now.” John bent his arm and pressed his elbow against Sherlock’s chest, blocking his predatory advance and protecting his flour-covered hands. “I have to set this aside to rise. So, go finish the show in there and give me five minutes.”
“And what would you do, Sherlock, if I did it?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Greg is waiting for him when he gets off the Overground. He gives John a look but is smart enough not to mention last night. Instead, he just fills John in on the case, which is definitely an odd one.
Jeanette looks utterly confused. “Oh. I thought… well, I thought she was yours, John?”
John thinks. He had reached a point where he was almost prepared to promise her anything if she’d just stop crying, so a glass of juice and some biscuits seems like a small price to pay. With a sigh of relief, he gets back up, and turns around to push her the last few metres to their front door, but in the process almost bumps into someone.
Within a few minutes, John's head is lolling back between Sherlock's knees, his eyes closed.   Sherlock ghosts one hand over John's forehead and cheek, and John stifles the urge to nip at his finger.  Just because Sherlock promised not to sham does not mean he can predict or avoid movements that, to John, are almost sexual. John takes a breath, focuses on relaxing, and opens his eyes to look at Sherlock.  Sherlock smiles down at him and says "maybe the bed would be better."
“Could be I prefer women,” Sherlock grates out.
he’ll use that word if he bloody well wants to -- for weeks, and he has yet to lay eyes on some parts of Sherlock.  Well, mainly this part.  He wishes Sherlock would take the pants off so he could stare properly, but something is better than nothing, yeah?  He gets a glimpse of curling ginger-brown hair, and his fingers itch to bury themselves in it.
Classes?  John can't imagine Sherlock taking classes in anything, much less the art of massage.
“And you’re not interested,” John countered, then he punctuated the comment by reaching up to press a soft kiss on Sherlock’s mouth.  It was a momentary fleeting thing, and Sherlock surprised himself by not hating it.
“So what’s the Sensitive Topic?” John continues while stacking glassware on the kitchen table.
Although he doesn’t realize it yet, soon John will stop trying so damn hard, and then he’ll stop trying altogether and just stick with enjoying, that’s enough to be going on with, and they’ll both be the happier for it.
“But you’re not gay…” Whatever made
, that sort of made sense.  For Sherlock. "As in, licking my eyeballs?"
Or maybe it was never like that, maybe his memories have filled in the spaces like a color-by-numbers.
“Very,” answers Sherlock.
Sherlock has seen John's look and where it was directed, but his hands continue to move over John's body.  Very slowly, Sherlock lowers his mouth over John's forehead. The tip of his tongue reaches out to carress John eyebrow.  Then it is gone as Sherlock looks searchingly at John's face, then returns to touch just the corner of John's open eye.  A tremor goes through Sherlock's body, and John feels his own skin beginning to fray, tiny bits of his nerves nakedly exposed to pure pleasure, and it's too much, he can't hold on and he can't let go, his breath comes in tiny spurts as he struggles not to lose consciousness.
“Yo, hobbit and curly-head, off the trampoline if you can’t follow the rules! There’s kids here.”
Sherlock hummed briefly and smiled back.  Really everything was lovely.  He had waited a long time for John to make a move, and now John had, and everything was lovely.
John allows a nod.
Sherlock looks as if he’s not sure what physical movements constitute talking, so John continues softly.  “Let me see if I have this sorted.  During the actual sex, you were fine.  You watched me fuck him, quite thoroughly, just so you know, and you took notes and it was fascinating.”  He pauses long enough to see that Sherlock is not disagreeing, then continues on.  “Then you watched me getting myself off…  By the way, could you read what I was saying?”  Sherlock nods cautiously.  “So,” continues John, “that was fine too.” Sherlock manages a scratchy “yes”.
He considers a list titled “What Sherlock tolerates”, but that’s a bit self-serving really, and John doesn’t have the stomach for it.
Sherlock just gaped at him.
A bit.
, John was repeating, his voice sliding unpredictably between affection and alarm.   And Sherlock took a deep breath and tried again, “I thought it would be reassuring to…” but trailed off as he saw that John, like all the others,
John gets gooseflesh hearing Sherlock voice gone husky, his eyes wide and black, a slight flush on his cheeks, his tongue darting out to wet his lips, and John thinks
“I was sitting here so fucking alone,  on infinite replay of you, falling out of the sky, and underneath that a voice whispering all the things I should have done, and now I would maybe never get to do.”
"Well, really more of a private tutorial. Even massage therapists need favors, you know,"  Sherlock clarifies, and then falls silent again.
So instead of doing any of those impossible things, Sherlock returned to the scar.  He ran his tongue along all the major lines, then he nipped at the smaller ones, then he sank his teeth in, just a little, to test how deep the scar tissue ran.  John didn’t lose his breath or whimper, though he may have growled, very quietly, almost meditatively, and for long minutes Sherlock licked and tasted and lost himself in minutiae.  He spiraled out, away from the original wound, and back in again, and he could have kept doing that forever, or at least until John got hungry again,  if he hadn’t got to John’s nipple on one of his forays, and John sucked in a suddenly violent breath and let it go and said “Jesus Sherlock!”  His voice was gritty and it was a moment before Sherlock even heard the individual words.  Then more evenly, John continued, “I like this, you know.  I really do.  This slow unfrantic exploration.  This is good.  But if you want to keep going this way, you probably don’t want
Weeks go by and John starts a list in his head.  It is a fairly short list, each item headed with a bullet point, the whole titled “What Sherlock likes”.  It reads “fingers stroking in his hair”, “sitting too close while watching crap telly”, and, more hopefully, “pressure on the small of his back”.  John watches carefully for additions to his list, but they are few and far between, and often don’t hold up when repeated.  He starts another list entitled “What Sherlock liked at least once” and adds “being held by the shoulders”, “having his forehead kissed”, “drawing small circles on the soles of his feet,” and “ticklish around ears” with a question mark.
It was time for a new approach. Applied chemistry, if you will.
Except that it does, of course. Because Sherlock is the unstoppable force and John is the immovable object and apparently they will annihilate each other like matter and anti-matter unless something gives. John offers to wank himself while Sherlock looks on, but really, how is that data with an entire variable just missing?  John casts about for parts of the sexual act that wouldn’t stress Sherlock too much, but by now the stress is stressing Sherlock, so he might as well be talking to the skull on the mantleplace.  And Sherlock wields John’s own words against him
“I’m here now.” John was quiet. “Sherlock, look at me, please. Sherlock.”
Sherlock’s curls were ruffled as John exhaled a low, fond chuckle. “Why?”
“-to shatter.” Sherlock enunciated the last two words slowly and crisply.
It gets dirty!”
“Hey, darling. Hello, sweet girl!” John looked between both of them with a smile that mirrored his expression on their wedding day. “I hope I got everything alright. The shops were insane. The shelves were wiped out of a lot of things.”
Sherlock waved a hand. “Once this is over, I should have no problem completing my analysis. It might prove useful in the future. How was your day?” He leaned back against the headboard, cradling the phone in his hands.
Rosie waved absently in the direction of the door, preoccupied with the horses on the floor in front of her. “Goodbye, Daddy.”
Sherlock nodded and his eyes fluttered shut as John closed the distance and pressed their lips together. Warm. Soft. Love. Emotion churned in Sherlock's chest and rose up into his throat. He grabbed onto John's shirt and pulled him close, trying to pull him as close as physically possible. Closer. As if they could morph into one being through osmosis.
“This just feels like such an overreaction, John.” Sherlock leaned back slightly. “Is it really necessary?”
John turned and half-seriously punched him in the arm. “Thank you,
Immediately, Rosie started clapping, still staring out the window. “Papa, you’re supposed to clap too.”
06.57 Sherlock
John did not, in fact have an affair, but came very close to having one. John doesn't end up seeing his family for five months as he works in the COVID unit.
John closed his eyes tightly. How could he not have seen it? How could he not have known? It wasn’t as if Sherlock had ever been forthcoming with any indication that he had actual feelings of that sort. Hell, John himself was the one who initiated their entire current relationship. They wouldn’t even be here if it hadn’t been for that kiss. And then to find out Sherlock had been pining after him for years? And apparently everyone could see and knew but him. Had Mary known? Is that what she had been hinting at this entire time? Post-death trying to nudge him in Sherlock’s direction?
He realised he didn’t need to gather the strength to continue his own. For as horrific as his own life had been, Sherlock’s had been…. Inconceivably worse. The man had grown up prodded by psychologists and ridiculed by his peers and teachers. His childhood friend had been murdered by his psychopath of a sister who was so awful he literally erased her from his memories. His brother had sought to interfere with every aspect of his life. He had overdosed multiple times from his drug addiction. He was called a freak by his work associates. He was almost killed by a serial killer, strangled, shot at by circus assassins, strangled again, and nearly killed repeatedly in their fight with Moriarty as well as having his entire reputation torn to the ground. That fiasco resulted in him faking his own death and fleeing the country for
Sherlock looked down at him and blinked, his hand closing instinctively around the ring, but not looking at it. “What… What are you doing?”
21:20 Sherlock
And that absence cladded
A giggle escaped him. He couldn’t stop it. He was just so damn happy. Not trusting himself to say anything more, John squeezed Sherlock’s hand and led them out, heading for home.
John’s lips twitched. “Bye bye, Rosie. Have a fun day with Papa.” He ran a hand through her hair and kissed her forehead before standing. He blew a kiss to Sherlock and left.
Sherlock’s phone rang, making John freeze. After fumbling in his dressing gown pocket, Sherlock produced the device. “Speak quickly.” As he listened to Lestrade’s response, Sherlock squeezed John’s hand and gave him a small smile, his eyes sparkling. “We’ll be there in ten.” Sherlock hung up and leaned over to plant a kiss on John’s cheek. “A case, John! Get dressed!” He lept from his seat and ran into the bedroom to change.
“No, there’s something.” Sherlock insisted. “Come on, out with it. I’m busy, I don’t have time to deduce it.”
John accepted a cup of tea from Mycroft’s reedy fingers and nodded his thanks. “All due respect, but why are we here?”
Sherlock nodded.
“A few weeks ago. It’s still pretty new, but we do have something of a foundation to build from.”
Sherlock squeezed the precious tiny hand gently and walked slowly along the edge of the lake, keeping her close to him and away from the passersby. None of them were wearing masks and while he was mortified at their carelessness, he couldn’t help the red flush that was forming on the back of his neck at the looks he and his daughter were getting for wearing them. His grip tightened slightly on the hand of the prancing child next to him.
Sherlock made a choked sound. “What on earth are you doing?”
Sherlock leaned into the touch and closed his eyes. He felt able to breathe when John was touching him, grounding him. Sherlock ran his hands over John’s chest and closed his eyes. “You did nothing wrong at all. The…” He cleared his throat. “Intensity. Of the moment was momentarily overwhelming, and I would appreciate it for you to not move while I continue processing the absurdity of the fact that you wish to spend the rest of your life with me of all people.”
“Ta, love.” John murmured.
John blinked. “I beg your pardon?”
At 8, Sherlock and Rosie stand near the open window and clap their hands for John. Rosie asks for Daddy at bedtime and cries.
Sherlock nodded. “Sleep well, John.”
“Who is?”
62 days
Sherlock held out his hand to Rosie. “Watson, come talk to Daddy.”
15.48 John
John closed his eyes briefly. “I miss you too. I miss you both so much. I wish I could come home.”
“No, you don’t.” Sherlock stopped next to the fridge and crossed his arms. “What the hell are you talking about, that is not how a relationship works and you know it. We’re equal partners in this. Having sex with you is not a
John looked up at him and nodded, an unreadable expression in his eyes.
John tensed. “Did they say something to you? Was it that new Lieutenant who’s been swapping off with Donovan? Sean… something?”
John straightened and picked up his cup before Sherlock re-entered the room, holding his book in one hand and a plate of biscuits in the other. “I do hope you are done terrorizing my partner, brother dear. You do tend to drone on.” Sherlock set the plate on the table and faltered slightly, seeing John’s face. He paused. “What’s wrong?”
Greg’s eyes went wide. “Oh shit, I’m sorry!” he swore.
15.55 Sherlock
Once John had left, Sherlock was finally able to focus, successfully completing his analysis in record time. He reached down for his phone and clenched his jaw in frustration when he realized he must have left it at home. And John had left…. Shit.
on Prime. Sherlock had scoffed at it for the entirety of the first season, much like he had done for every show they had watched so far, but, also like every show they had watched so far, he had swiftly become reluctantly engaged in the characters and so they were just finishing the 5
John shut his eyes again. The emptiness in his chest ached, an ache that spread throughout his body. It was time to stop toeing the line and take the step. Take the step and complete his story. To close the book on the life of a man who was never able to succeed in anything, who, in the end, always lost everyone he tried to love. It was safer for Sherlock this way. Better for everyone. As he opened his eyes again and looked down at the pavement far below him, the people walking in their lives without an idea that he even existed. He wondered if any of them could stop him. Would it even matter if they tried? Who would know.
“I know, Sherlock.”
Was more necessary than air,

Sherlock twisted the antibacterial cloth in his hands. “If you can manage to call… even for a few moments. It would mean a lot to Watson. This has been difficult. Explaining to her why you’re not coming home. She just doesn’t understand.”
They had turned to each other and kissed.
Sherlock watched quietly from across the kitchen table, his eyes focused on John’s movements.
“Papa, what time is it?”
“I have not done
Shining softly on
Sherlock huffed and opened his mouth to retort, but John cut him off. “Stop. We’re not talking about your coat right now. We’re having an adult conversation about the virus that’s out there.”
John raised his hands. “Alright. Alright, sorry.”
“I love you”, a murmur
But John merely smiled and said “You’re brilliant, Sherlock.”
“Don’t stop what?” Sherlock queried with barely concealed panic.
They lock eyes and Sherlock recovers in an instant, but despite that neither of them are breathing, and when John leans towards Sherlock, he couldn’t have uttered a word.  Instead he just lifts his eyebrows to ask for permission, and Sherlock nods once, and then they are kissing. John meant it to be only a quiet, close-mouthed thing -- whether Sherlock enjoyed kissing or not wasn’t the sort of topic they’d discussed (not beyond ‘married to my work’, thank you very much) but things get out of hand quickly.  He feels Sherlock’s mouth open like an invitation, so he plunges in.
The other man approaches John warily but then their mouths lock and Sherlock realizes a flaw in his plan.  From up here, he really can’t see what’s going on inside their mouths.  Has John opened his lips to admit the other man?  He thinks so, but it’s difficult to be sure exactly when.  A miniature camera could have helped, but presumably would fall under the video ban.  Sherlock will have to plan more carefully in the future if he wants good data.
“It was a shite idea,” he says by way of apology.
“For – this –“ Sherlock struggled momentarily “and everything.”
Sherlock blushes, but continues stubbornly, “Your eyes and your lips and your tongue know that I’m fine, John.  Let them handle your subconscious.”
Sherlock woke late the next morning, curled tight against John’s shoulder.
John shakes his head, too tired to fight about apologies.
When he resurfaced, he realised John was talking to him, had been for some time.  Something about food in the army – its nutritional properties eclipsed by lack of inspiration, about heat and thirst, about passing the time by making lists of all the foods you intend to eat when you get back home, even though you know you never actually will do.  John recited a few of his -- raspberry lemonade and pistachio gelato, seven varieties of alcohol, tuna salad, and (which Sherlock supposed had started the monologue) risotto with parmesan or mushrooms or thyme and sausage. Plans for deduction flickered in Sherlock’s brain, but what his body did was this -- it was nuzzling at the top of John’s head, soft blond hair against the cheekbones that he never did understand the attraction of, and it was only when John’s voice stopped that he realized he was on shaky ground, and started to pull back, but John was humming a little, twisting so that Sherlock’s nose ended up mashed against John’s forehead. Sherlock’s gaze darted cross-eyed down to John’s face, then skittered away, and he found himself staring somewhat less cross-eyed at John’s chest, which wasn’t much better.  John’s eyes followed his, then he snorted in amusement.
W: John
John doesn’t realize, of course he doesn’t, since he’s by definition behind the closed door of his room at this point in the proceedings, but Sherlock’s unreasonably sharp ears are tuned to the snick of the lube cap popping off, to the faint rattle of John’s flies, to the even fainter sighing and creaking of John’s cheap metal bed. Every time, his damn ears prick up and his nose twitches with the desire to follow the traces.  Like a sodding beagle, he thinks sourly, but already his foot is on the first step to John’s room.
Oh, and did we mention that he never leaves the flat?  The black mood came on him surprisingly quickly after the straight razor incident, and now John is seriously doubting the sanity of their arrangement -- he’s trying to survive a frenzy of lust for a man he can barely tolerate up close, so if Sherlock could just get his arse off the couch and out of the flat for ten minutes, that would be lovely, thank you.  Or seven, seven would be plenty too.
“Hold on, *I* got an email request?  On my password-protected email in my password-protected blog on my password-protected laptop?” John isn’t really surprised, well, he’s not surprised at all, but there’s a strange atmosphere in the cab just now, and he hopes that a bit of wingeing will dissolve it.
"What if I wanted to, say... explore you with my tongue..."
“Well-spotted,” mutters John ruefully.  “You’re a bloody idiot, you know that?  Yeah, sure, it’s me I’m worried about, all right.  Someday between the tea-making and the patching-up, you’re gonna forget that I exist, and what’s it gonna do to my self-image, to my bloody
It was the yogurt that set Sherlock’s teeth on edge.   John never ate yogurt.
1. Only when Sherlock is out of the flat, preferably on a case
After a hard look at the sleeping man beside him, John lays his hands on himself.  He’s soon wet with pre-come, so it’s a simple matter of push-pull-twist, and he makes no attempt to keep his voice gentle or his movements quiet.  Instead, he groans and cries out and shakes the bed as he comes, then notes the time grimly by his mobile.
“Noise?” supplied Sherlock helpfully. Absently he noted that he’d just incinerated a shopping receipt. He hoped that Mrs. Hudson would overlook the scorch mark if he positioned an Erlenmeyer flask over it.
, and it’s not for sex,
John smiles again, not the aren’t-you-clever smile, but a sad and possibly forgiving smile, and murmurs “We’ll get through it.  Although I think that was the first and last time for that particular kind of data.”
When he is finished finding the pieces of himself and putting them back together, John opens his eyes to see Sherlock still sitting at his side, looking pleased and a bit predatory. "Maybe you'd better introduce me to your tutor," offers John.
“And, well, I guess keeping myself emotionally uninvolved was a way to shield myself.  But you saw, it didn’t completely work…”
When he looked up, John was gazing at him with unguarded delight that broke something in Sherlock.  Hastily he pushed at John’s undone jeans, then at his pants, until his cock was exposed.  It was thick, heavy and flushed.  John was murmuring strings of nonsense, stopping and starting and losing his place.  Sherlock couldn’t resist sniffing, then licking.  He raised his head and had a brief impression of John’s mouth bearing down on his, but in the last moment it was John who veered off and buried his face in Sherlock’s neck instead.  He clung to Sherlock as if he was being swept away, and rutted blindly against Sherlock’s leg.
“I know, I know that, but.  There should have been a signal, a safeword, something…”
“For about three weeks now, yeah?” John added.
"Look, Sherlock, I spent months fantasizing about anything and everything with you.  I never told you that, but it's true. Anything you wanted to do right now would be fine by me."
“Yes,” breathes Sherlock, and John shudders, his eyes falling closed, his lips repeating “yes” and then he straightens again, and says “More, love,” and Sherlock repeats “more, yes, more.”  John smiles at him, the imp back in place, and teases “full sentences, love,” but Sherlock is beyond full sentences.  His eyes are wide and dark, his breathing labored, his tongue working over his lips, his hands gripping John convulsively behind the knees.  So John takes pity on him.  His hand moves at its own pace, petting and stroking and twisting and swirling, his thighs pushing hard outward against Sherlock’s arms, his hips rocking his body and Sherlock’s like a lullaby.  “So beautiful,” he murmurs to Sherlock.  “So gorgeous.  So lovely.”  The rhythm and the friction carry him along easily, pleasure building in waves, spreading luminous joy, and Sherlock finds his voice again and says “Now John” and John allows himself to fall, already caught and held safe, cherished and treasured and filled with light.
And fucking, shagging, getting or giving pleasure, making love – that was the easiest of all.  An urge only, no biological necessity at all.  Of course he had experimented as a teenager.  Already at that age he knew what puzzles he wanted to solve, and knew that solving them would involve knowledge of certain processes.  So he went about it methodically, learned how pleasure worked, conducted experiments on himself – temperature, light, duration – had even written some notes in a spidery adolescent code, had researched lists of physical tells and confirmed them on himself, and when he knew the what and the when and the how it felt, that was when he learned how to do without, how to reverse the process, how to take the tells of sexual arousal and turn them on themselves.
Sherlock sleeps on through two more carefully timed performances.  He wakes in the late afternoon to the snick of the lube as John removes the cap a floor above him.
After Sherlock nods twice and John calls him an idiot, it falls to John to see the other man (it turns out his name is Bill Waters) out the door.  It’s a bit awkward but John is not fussed about it.  He comes back to find Sherlock still frozen on the bed and looking like he might topple if John doesn’t move back into place.  John sighs, because now he is really tired.  He’s been up for 36 hours, arguing with Sherlock for the twelve of them and glowering for another twelve, he had a pretty energetic romp with an American marine, and to be honest, he’s feeling a bit bruised and pretty mellow.  But Sherlock is capable of going without sleep for days when something’s on his mind, and John would prefer not to have this conversation after Sherlock’s had another 8 hours to stew, so he grimaces and says “I think we should talk.”
John pulled away by a few inches to get a better look at Sherlock, and immediately Sherlock’s head was screeching
Sherlock takes another step closer.  He is indeed desperate to see, so he chokes out “push it back.”
is carried away in a current, an inundation, and fucking flood of emotion and lust.  He hopes that Sherlock doesn’t mind too much, but even partial sentences are beyond his capacity, so he settles for murmuring Sherlock’s name, mixed with bits of nonsense and curse words, as he comes undone.
"I'd be happy to spar with you if you feel you need to keep up," Sherlock offers.
"Bloody hell," John swears again.  "Eyeballs? Is that what it feels like for you?"
When Sherlock makes no reply, John adds, a bit wickedly, “What I plan to do.”
On Thursday, Sherlock is up to make John a cup of tea in the morning. John has a shift at the clinic, several extra hours made tense by a three year old with two crushed fingers (got closed into the frame of the door while the mother was in a hurry, and now she's screaming louder than her child) in the middle of which a homeless man who came in with a mild 'flu stops breathing and has to be resuscitated.  All ending well still does not make for an easy day, and John dreads the three year old's follow up appointment. Stitches can flash him back to scenes in Afghanistan, where he desperately wanted to stitch people up, especially when there's a lot of screaming involved.
