. His parents weren't much help either. They treated him just as badly if not worse. Wade was at her house more often than note because of how much he hated his own. There were times where she would see bruises and cuts on the boy that weren't there before, yet Wade told her it was his own fault. He would never tell her a single detail about where he lived or if his parents really abused him. She knew the police wouldn't give a shit without evidence. Multiple times, she called them to get CPS, but they wouldn't budge. Just ignore her and end the call.
The two lovebirds had been dancing together for almost an hour. It was their anniversary of three years, so no shit they were going to make it romantic. After dining on some homemade tater tots and chocolate, the pair simply soaked in each others presence.
All that Steve did was look down at his mug and sign. He did nothing wrong. What happened in Siberia was the only thing that could be classified as bad in Steve’s mind. Toni had done even worse things. It would be a lie to say that he wasn’t getting tired of the same cycle. Now, Thor is in the way of him salvaging what he had with Toni. If he was being truly honest with himself, he wanted to keep the only thing in his life that reminded him of Peggy. Toni was her goddaughter after all. They acted too differently, but the genius looked quite similar to her. Steve would have to talk some sense into Toni. He truly regretted what he did, but he doesn’t want to be antagonized 24/7. Captain America wasn’t a war criminal.
"Steve, yah alright? You seem a bit pale." There was no emotion on Toni's face when Steve snapped out of his trance like state.
"To celebrate Jeffrey's release, I'm gonna go buy us some doughnuts. Jeffrey is in charge!" She yelled, already out the door. Toni could hear a 'Not again!' from Carnage, a 'Mother hecker!' from Wade, a 'Thanks Mom!" from Peter (probably hearing the doughnuts part and nothing else), and a loud laugh from the two adults.
Helloooo my dudes!!! First off, TWO THOUSAND HITS?? WTH??? Thank you all so much! It means the world to me <3
Wade looked at Peter and smiled. He gave a weak squeeze to his hand. His eyes began to flutter and his breathing stopped. With that, Wade Winston Wilson passed away. His family all around him.
Toni walked away with Peter in her arms. This did not go well. A couple minutes passed in silence. Peter got up and said he had to go to the bathroom.
, she though to herself. In the corner of her eyes, she could see Peter and Wade stiffen noticeably. There was a look that screamed death on the spiderling’s face. It didn’t get any better when she looked at Eddie and Venom. The pair were giving death glares at the upper ceiling, imagining where the archer was. Venom was snarling and Eddie’s eyes were dark with anger.
"Toni, there was no other way." With that, he turned to dust. Her eyes widened at the sight. It happened so suddenly and without mercy. There was nothing anyone could do to stop it. That's what hurt the most. Strange couldn't even say goodbye to the people he cared about. No chance nor control. Not an ounce of mercy. She tried her best to not cry at the sight. Even though they did not get along at first, Toni found that Stephen was great to be around. He even called her 'Dr. Stark', her proper title. It had been years sense she heard that name. Words couldn't describe the respect she formed when she heard her name. Now that respectful and serious person is gone. Her thoughts came to a halting stop when she heard another voice, filled with confusion.
"You know what's even better? This idiot has been working her ass off to make you guys legal again. To have you guys back in the tower. All debts paid and crimes forgiven. I didn't want her to do such a thing for
When she looked around her, she broke down. They all were dead. It was if they were all hanging on for this baby.
“First run will be five seconds in the future while the second will be five months in the past. Sound good?” The other scientist said. Even though Bruce looked nervous, his eyes glowed in anticipation. He fist bumped Toni. “Science bros!” whispered each of them.
It was time. Last night, Natasha arrived with Clint. He looked very different. A new haircut and an entirely new demeanor. No one commented on it. He was curt and to the point in his words. The only reason he came back was to get his family back. They all understood.
In her Iron Man suit, she lead all the employees and children out of the building. It was an air attack from some Hydra Bombers or some shit. She was too worried on her boys to really care. Her heart soared when she saw Eddie with Wade and Peter on each hand. They were all safe, but Wade looked a little worse for wear. Scratch that, he looked like he needed a hospital. Probably everyone did, they were suffering from shock no doubt. Oh, wait, the paramedics, police, and fire fighters were already there. Man, she really needed to be more aware of her surroundings. Still, she ran over to Eddie and gave all of them a huge hug.
“Alright, you heard the man. Stroke those keys, Jolly Green.” As Toni said that, she winked at Bruce. He rolled his eyes.
"Yah betcha sweets. They're radioactive or something. We're gonna get to see them, but of course not touch them. Which sucks, but what're you gonna do." Wade had taken out his ponytail a while ago and was endlessly ruffling his messy hair. And he did it for the millionth time. But this one had a roughness that Peter could recognize. It was like he was trying to restrain himself. There were many times that Peter had to stop Wade from hurting himself and others, the older boy had violent tendencies that were extremely hard to control. Wade had killed some animals before. Squirrels, possums, rats, mice, and....lizards. That must be why Wade felt so uncomfortable. Peter smiled at him and took his hand.
She could hear their concerned voices easily through the thin door. However, she couldn’t muster up the strength to get up and open it. In fact, Toni couldn’t ever speak. Only watch the stupid wall with haunted eyes. After another minute passed, she made herself say, “I’m alright, just I need some alone time.”
”And your curse will never be lifted. You don’t deserve happiness after what you’ve done, you monster. It’ll be with you until you die. I hope that will be soon, bitch.”
“Toni..” Her head snapped up at the weak whisper from Wade. They were right by his bed, so Toni held his hand.
?! Why did you think I would actually agree to all the terms of the Accords. You should have known it was for show and that I should change them as much as I could! You knew I wouldn't let Wanda get hurt and arrested, that's why I had to leave her
A crash. Toni had dropped the glasses on the floor in shock. Oh, she was furious. The only request she had made to that man, and he had broken it.
Her bare room was dark and empty, she didn’t bother to turn the light on. All she could do was sit and stare. It was like her body wasn’t her own. Whatever.
"Hulk please.....need you....don't say that.....I know....can fix this...kill Thanos...save everyone....strong.." Bruce mumbled random sentences, until he snapped. A thundering roar was heard, along with some tearing clothes.
“Don’t go to them. Clint literally just screamed at you from the top floor. Didn’t even bother to come and ask you in person.”
Anyways, they went into the building in their groups. Thank goodness that only Wade and Peter were in her group. No one else wanted to take Wade and Peter was her son. Eddie also was in their group with Carnage, being seen as her 'guest'. Again, not true at all, Eddie stood alone, and Toni saw her much more than a guest. Along with that, everyone were still wary of the controversial Eddie Brock. That and her two boys. Venom and Carnage. Even though the world was used to mutants, that didn't mean that they didn't accept them.
letter and a broken heart. She only wanted to help! There never were intentions to destroy Sokovia, damage New York, or ruin the Avengers at all. Did they know how hard it was to make peace with the citizens after Loki's first attack? Did they know how long Toni has spent with government officials? Did they know that she would have probably changed some statements on the Accords as soon as she could? Did they know what it was like to be betrayed time and time again by someone that you used to love? Did they know? Toni sure did. She knew all too well. But, it's not her place to say right? After all, she is evil and only cares about herself, so she doesn't deserve any forgiveness. That's why
”Oh, child, you don’t remember? I turned to dust. Everyone here must have turned to dust. Including you it seems. I’m so sorry. I do not know anything else.” The woman walked away to a group of elderly looking people.
“Look, bud, I’m not good with the emotional stuff, but I know what’s goin’ on. You feel shitty. You feel like a fuck-up, a failure. Does that sum it up?” Toni grabbed her coffee, not bothering to put anything in it, and plopped down next to Thor.
"EVERYONE GET DOWN. EDDIE, TAKE PETER AND WADE. DON'T ENGAGE!!" Toni screamed through the panic. The other boy had walked off to be with Eddie, so he was fine. Peter could see the terror in Eddie's eyes and sense Venom's anger. His aunt and uncle were on high alert, especially his uncle. His Other was pregnant with their twin girls, Agony and Scream, and Venom was
"Oh my god, will you stop it with that nickname!" She combed a hand through her short, blonde hair in annoyance. Of course, she wasn't actually angry, especially because Venom was cackling in her mind. Her symbiote truly loved the combined name. It was invented a long time ago when the pair got a bit too tipsy and started talking nonsense. Names like 'Toni Man', 'Eddom', 'Ironi', and more were said between the two. Eventually, the name 'Veddie' was slurred from her and she could literally see Toni's eyes light up.
“Now you know. Lies and doubt corrupted this team and if we are going to move forward, we are going to need to change that. Understood. You are the Avengers, goddammit. You hear me?!” A calphony Of broken yells followed.
Thor came rushing out, Stormbreaker in hand. He had a face mask on him and with hair was in a bun. “BY ODIN’S BEARD! YOU’VE DONE IT, ANTONIA!” The god ran towards her and scooped her up, swinging her around.
"Eh, I just hear 'em all the time. Mostly from my dad." Wade shrugged and winced when he accidentally mentioned his father. It was so extremely rare for him to say a word about his home-life.
All Toni did was nod at the others and begin to walk away. Right before she left, Wanda growled out.
”Excuse me? Do you know where we are?” The boy tried to keep his voice calm as he asked an old lady he remembered. How could he forget? She had given him churros!
He rose his hands in defeat, only to find himself stuck to the wall. Looking at the mirror, he saw that he was trapped in a web. There was webbing coming from his...wrist? “Webby!? What’s happening to me!” The spider chittered some more. She crawled off his shoulder and onto the web. Before Peter could panic even more, he saw that she was snipping away at the strands. “Oh, thank god.” An eternity passed until Peter was freed. He managed to rip off the remaining pieces of counter off his hands and plopped onto bed.
her to be in the 'Avengers'. She had the weapons, knowledge, and money to truly help them out. It felt wrong though. He also needed more people, and she had connections. Bruce had been pretty panicky as of late, talking about the government and how it's on to him again. No matter what, though, she will not forgive herself if she caused the deaths of the people she loved.
If Toni really wanted to kill Bucky she would have done it easily. She was going soft on them, not giving 110% like Steve was. Not even Bucky was trying as hard as the super soldier.
AAAAGGGHHH THIS HAS BEEN AN AGONIZING CHAPTER TO WRITE. I restarted it a whole bunch of times but oh well.
"I know that, White. Shut up." Both men looked in horror at the child, each thinking that he was insane.
Little did they know that the Colonel had been planning this special meeting for quite a while. All the original Avengers took their seats, even Toni. The woman had an inkling to what Rhodey was about to do and was powerless to stop him.
Walking out of the elevator was Steve Rogers, Clint Barton, Natasha Romanoff, and Bruce Banner. “Sup,” she said plainly.  “It’s so good to see you again, Natalie.” Toni winked at her old personal assistant.
different. I'm so glad that I got the opportunity to get to know you and be with you. We'll give each other our messages as soon as possible, okay?" The shorter male leaned up to kiss Wade on the lips. It was sweet and filled with emotion.
"Of course, mijo. Ven aqui, amor." She opened her arms again, and Peter leaned back in. Carefully, Toni picked him up and began to carry him to his room. He was so light, barely weighed a thing. The engineer grimaced a bit, promising herself that she was going to get some weight on him. Peter had always had trouble keeping a healthy weight, often being underweight.
"Love!" "Venom!!??" They each yelled at him. Peter was still whining and, to make things worst, was pursing his lips. Instinctively the baby was looking for a nipple to suckle on, like all mammals do. Toni rocked her adopted son soothingly as she hesitantly unbuttoned her blouse and bra. To her right was Eddie and Venom, radiating support.
“Wade. I know you’re heartbroken. You’re angry and upset about it. Peter was taken from you so suddenly. I’m so sorry I wasn’t there to help you. Look, I'm not good with this kind of stuff. But," an empty silence filled the air, "I will try my damn best to help." Toni looked at Wade, only for him to look away. The teenager's shoulders tensed even more and his breath began to hitch. Slowly, so very slowly, Wade looked at her again.
Happiness came off of Thor in waves. He looked like a big old puppy. “We will finally get everyone back! I’ll get the rest of my people back, my brother, my friends.” His tone grew quieter. “It was my fault this even happened. My failure caused this, but you have found the solution. I am forever grateful to you, Antonia.”
"We got a situation!" His head snapped towards Sam's voice. But the man was nowhere to be found, already being turned to dust.
“Before we start this meeting, I need the Avengers to come with me. Guardians, please stay here for a bit.” Rhodey’s voice immediately boomed throughout the halls. The robot and raccoon only nodded and went to go get some food or test out some weapons.
“I’m sure that I couldn’t even scratch the surface of the ancient study of magic if I was given a year!”
Once Peter and Toni made it home, without Wade for once, a heavy silence filled the air. Immediately, Toni scooped her son into her arms and headed to the couch. She started humming to him soothingly as she feel Peter start to shake. The terrified boy began to whine and cry, burying his head into her chest. His hold was surprisingly strong, stronger than ever, almost crushing Toni. Still, the woman could care less.
” Even Venom was having trouble getting out those words. An extremely pained expression was on his face as he mentioned Peter. He loved the boy just as much as anyone did.
“From what I’ve gathered, Thanos is obviously still alive.” She grabbed a black device from the table and pressed a button, illuminating the room with light. A hologram appeared of space. “Thor told me that the ugly grape summoned a portal of some sort and disappeared.” With another click, Titan appeared on screen.
“Yeah we can just go up to him and,” He pulled his hands apart, making it look like he had a rope in his hands. Rhodey made a few strangling motions while looking at them. A few pauses passed.
It was his sanity. That was what broke. He never had much of it to begin with. And, no, it wasn't from schizophrenia. It just ran in his family. All except his mother. His loving mother that was taken away from him.
It would be a lie to say she didn't long for the warm hugs Steve would envelope her with. The fun jokes and banter they would share. The delicious pancakes on Saturday. The soft kisses given throughout the day. She missed it.
"'Sorry?' You didn't even try to, that letter sure didn't do anything! Besides, what excuse do you have for almost killing me after you lied to me!"
"We are here," a robotic voice sounded. Toni was pulled out of her thoughts and looked apathetically at the ruined land of Wakanda. Still, it wasn't anything like Titan. At least, there were live people and proud buildings everywhere. Of course, they had dealt with their fair bit of loss, Toni wasn't that petty. Despite that thought, she wondered if any of them had to see their team dust all around them. Specifically,
The woman took off her gloves and goggles and made her way through the door. Immediately, she was met with the impatient face of her CEO, classic.
Now in her room, Toni rubbed her face with her hands and groaned. Why was she so weak? She could have just left or not have said anything! Whatever, it already happened.
Quietly, he started to hum a tune to himself. It was familiar and comforting. Why? Well, it was what his mom always hummed whenever he needed soothing and somebody to hug him.
A tortured woman gets to relive memories. Don’t worry they are ones she loves, but they are ones she wants to have happen again.
"Stark?" It was a voice filled with relief, but it only made her blood boil. Of all times, Steve acts concerned and happy to see here?! Her head snapped toward the soldier's direction. Rhodey held her tighter to restrain her, for he knew that Toni wasn't stable. He was careful of her bleeding wounds as he held her.
Once again, Wade screamed bloody murder as the doctor pulled out his organs. His intestines were pulled out like a scarf. Still, he wasn’t dying. Wade could already feel new organs coming in.
“What the...” Something sticky was felt. Peter felt around some more and found a single string of silk attached. He could tell it was a spider’s silk. Webby never spun a web on him though. Weird. Grabbing the string, he pulled it out and flinched at the pain. The string kept on going. Eventually, it stopped and Peter was met with a horrific sight.
This was going to be fun. So very fun. The doctor took out a very, very large syringe. Weapon X. His best invention yet. Without any hesitation, he injected the substance into the boy.
All the students and parents paused their conversation to stare at the one and only, Antonia Stark. Even though she came for every student-parent meeting, PTA grouping, open house, school play, or field trip, it was still a shock to them that she appeared. It was flattering, of course, having people be beyond shocked at your presence. At least, one person didn't have the same expression. Eddie, five months pregnant with twins, was beaming at her friend while holding a sleepy Carnage. The woman smiled in response and walked toward her, Wade following.
She knew that family. They were a group of geniuses with kind hearts. Along with that, they were the head of Oscorp.
They stayed like that for a while until Toni was able to breathe again. Dr. Strange gave her a reassuring Pat on her shoulder before leaving the room.
"Dying. W-Wade, you know what we do f-for a-a l-l-living. Who kn-knows when we won't ever be able to do this again?" He shakily gestured at the two of them, specifically how he was practically on Wade's lap.
“Yeah. I mean, we’re going to have to do the impossible for this to work. Having a far fetched plan is required.” Her eyes softened, and a small reassuring smile appeared on her lips. The Russian nodded at her to continue. For the millionth time, Toni sighed. Her plan wasn't fool proof for sure. Again, what other options do the have?
"Please, mom. I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go. Please, Mama." His breath was erratic and he clung onto his mother for dear life.
It was Peter, in his crib with a spider onesie on. His eyes were a bit puffy, showing that he had cried a lot earlier. A smile immediately replaced his pout.
The boy quickly returned and gave a monster of a bowl to Wade. “Jarvis! Turn on the heater and mist!”
”Wade stay with me! You’re going to be okay! Breathe! Please!” That was all Wade could hear. It was Peter’s voice.
Everything was so cool! There were shiny things in every corner, every room, just everywhere! Peter couldn't contain his pure excitement. He had always loved science, it was just so interesting to him. Biology was his favorite by far. So, as they headed into the 'animal' section of the tour, Peter may have gotten a bit too distracted. What could he say? The albino rabbits and mice looked so awesome!
“Hey, Petey Pie. Are you ready to go home?” As if he could understand her, Peter nodded fervently and giggled. Toni picked him up and kissed his little head, ruffling up his soft, brown curls.
Venom had summoned his full form and wrapped themselves around their love. They could feel the trembling coming from their Other. She must've felt it to. There was a tense atmosphere that was only getting worse. The symbiote hugged Eddie even tighter.
Standing in front of all of them was Peter, crying in fear. None of them had lowered their weapons except for Clint. He guiltily put his bow down and tried to smile at the boy.
"I'll always be here, Petey. Always. No matter what. But, "He stroked his thumb to wipe the tears falling on his boyfirend's cheeks, "we can give each other something if the need arise."
Thank god no one had to see Toni Stark, genius, billionaire, philanthropist, playgirl, running around her room, desperately putting on her clothes and makeup on at the same time.
”Fine. ‘KAY BYE!” With that, Toni summoned her suit with a press of her special bracelet and flew off.
I’m planning to make this part of a collection! I’ll be doing writing prompts on Female Tony Stark’s or anything marvel related. Thank you so much for reading!!
“T-Toni....g-give th-this to h-him wh-when he is r-ready. P-please.” May’s voice broke the deafening silence. As soon as it came, it faded away. At her side was a flash drive. It read:
Should she agree to it? Legally, it wasn’t up to her. Toni wasn’t his parent nor guardian. It was also up to Wade in some way. This could save his life. If anything went wrong, then it could just as well end it. How could she never realize that Wade was this sick?
"EVERYBODY GET ON THE GROUND." A gruff voice was heard from outside. Venom took over Eddie while Carnage turned into his symbiote form and hide inside her. Even with everything that happened, they were ready to fight and defend.
"Toni, what happened?" Toni froze and looked coldly at Steve. He was across from Thor and looked at her desperately. She refused to speak to him. Frustrated and emotional, he spoke before he could think. "I'm sorry for anything that you've gone through. You didn't deserve it."
"Ma! Look it!" Peter ran towards his mother, who was in the kitchen making coffee and chocolate milk. The woman was dressed in some sweats and a black T-shirt with her chocolate hair in a messy bun.
At the sound of her gasp, they snapped their heads towards her. Getting a closer look, Toni saw with horror that they were stuck. All of them having
"Mhm. Now, it looks like you..." Toni paused for dramatic effect. "Want some pets??" The engineer tried her best to look as confused as possible.
The roar of the chainsaw made Wade scream. He was coming closer and looked at his exposed stomach. In an instant, he plunged it deep inside his guts. Another scream.
Everyone was starting to give up. They couldn't stay in Wakanda forever. Most of them went off to help out the ones who survived, checking in with Toni each day. The only people who stayed were herself, Wade, Venom, Bruce, Steve, Thor, and Rhodey.
Toni couldn’t help but smile at his very sarcastic tone. Looking at the fussy baby in her arms, she smiled even more.
Toni smiled sheepishly. "I-I couldn't leave him. But, I still feel like I've made a mistake. I'm a billionare, genius, philanthropist, playgirl, and, not to mention, a
"Wow. I never knew babies could get so cute." A voice filled with humor was heard behind her. Peter turned his head toward the sound and pointed at the sitting women while laughing. It was a heavily pregnant Eddie with a snake Venom on the couch. The two were watching some sort of documentary about nature or something. Oh yeah, Eddie said she would be visiting soon.
”Fuck off. I’m glad she’s not going to marry you. She’s probably incinerated that garbage ring a long time ago. Toni doesn’t deserve to be with someone that always makes her second guess herself, insults her, won’t trust her, possibly hit her, and all that shitty stuff. Good thing that Thor will take her off of your gloved hands. At least that guy won’t be too arrogant to admit wrong doing. Stay away from Toni, I mean it.” He purposely knocked himself against Steve’s shoulder as he stormed off.
Toni couldn't provide an answer. Nobody had a single clue of what they were going to do. It was going to be impossible. No matter what, she couldn't let Wade's face grow any more grave. "I'm not sure, but, in the end, we will win. We'll bring everyone back. Even Peter." She squeezed his hand.
There was no Venom without Eddie. They needed their host. They needed their Other. They were nothing without her. Frantically, Venom searched the apartment for any signs of their Other half.
She had notified Pepper, Rhodey, Happy, and Eddie about what happened weeks before. They visited Wade as much as they could. Peter had been taken out of school for the next month. The boy was a wreck already and school made it worse.
“You’re right it was. I’m making things right though. There were so many lives lost from the attack. I think we need to all apologies to the public. We did this before with Loki. Destroy and cause unnecessary casualties. We have to be better at this and be more organized. The people are all scared and don’t trust all of us right now. I’ve been gaining back their trust by talking with them and creating tons of charities for the homeless and orphaned. They need to hear something from you guys. I can’t do it all for you.” There was no snark at all. She was dead serious and was not playing any games.
Why. Why were people so cruel? Mass genocide isn’t mercy. Manipulation and abuse aren’t love. Lies and betrayal aren’t teamwork. Fuck them. Fuck Thanos. Fuck Steve. Fuck the Avengers. She was done. There was only so much that she could take.
”Well, Cap didn’t want to sign it. Neither did a few other people. Then boom. You have one team against the others. Also, turns out Bucky killed my parents when he was mind-controlled.”
"Now let's go put Jeffrey back in the tank, hm? I bet he had a rough night." All the children perked up and went to follow Eddie and Venom.
His torturer touched the veins, arteries, and muscles and plucked them like a violin. To his horror, the skin already began to heal.
The two continued to exchange screams until Toni herself screamed,"BREAKFAST IS HERE!" That made them go quiet. Wade scrambled oof his seat and went into the pantry and fridge. He got out Nutella, butter, and maple syrup. He unceremoniously plopped the sides on the counter. They all dug in.
"Psh. Sorry, Edds." With a shrug, she huffed and began to follow the rest. They were about to go into the most scientific advanced building in the world. It would be a lie to say she wasn't terrified.
Nonstop, Toni Stark sent search parties to look for Wade. The whole story spread across the globe of a dying boy being taken away by possible terrorists.
”’Scuse you, they are actually three.” Toni put a hand on her chest in mock offense. It was times like these that she treasured.
"Oi, Tones, quit trying to blow up the teachers with your stare." Eddie's voice interrupted her thoughts.
Besides, they were in need of some heads if they were going to make whatever monster did this to suffer.
Tubes were jammed into his spine, shoulders, neck, arms, and legs. He didn’t know what they were doing, but he could feel something being pushing into his body through them.
"Thanos took everything from us. Without mercy. Just straight up genocide. Now, what we are going to do is. One: Beat his purple ass. Two: Get Everyone we love back. and Three: Figure out how to do the first two. Well, let's get started."
Life isn't fair. It never was and never will be. Things were given to people that they never wanted. Things that happened to people who never deserved it.
They sat like that for almost an hour until Peter pulled away. Sniffling, the little boy whispered in a hoarse voice, "Can I go to my room, mamá?"
“Well, at least it works. Maybe we can go back in time and go see Thanos when he was a baby.” The others looked at Rhodey in confusion. Toni facepalmed.
. You know.... from you?" The women looked at the engineer with a pleading look. Toni looked as red as a tomato from the suggestion.
"Yeah! It's still nerve wracking, but Venom and I have been educating ourselves as much as we can." Letting her curiosity take over, Eddie said, "Toni are you.... are you expecting?" Her blue eyes were filled with surprise and shock.
heat signatures?” There wasn’t an answer after she said that. Her heart constricted with fear of knowing that innocent people could die before she found them. Oh god, no.
”I’ll get you back, Pete. I promise. We’ll celebrate with as much popcorn, cookies, and cake as you want. I swear to it. I love you so much, amore.”
“It’s the EPR paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you wound up pushing time through Lang. It’s dangerous. I should have been there to warn you against it. Sorry.” The genius shrugged her shoulders and walked over to the monitor. She typed some new sequence in and in a flash, Lang was back.
Many tears were shed on that day. Nevertheless, they moved on. Sure, Peter was upset and confused, but he took it like any adult would. Even though he was six at the time.
"Is th-th-there any medicine?" Wade said, shaking. His whole body felt weak, and he still couldn't really breathe. He snapped up when he saw the cold glare his father gave him. He was angry.
“Yeah. One day, I’m training with him and the next, he was missing. Clint took a quinjet as well. He’s been completely under the radar for months. I’ve had no leads on finding his location.”
"Yes?" Eddie yelped in surprise as Venom scooped her up bridal style and began to carry her into their bedroom.
, so there fights would be even more extreme. Disgust started to appear in waves the moment he saw Captain America walk away, leaving his dear friend to rot in the cold.
”That’s the point, we save people but also kill people. We brought unnecessary damage to hundred of cities. Don’t worry about it though I always got us out of it. It’s my thing to do that.”
The engineer's breaths turned frantic. Everyone around her was dying and there was nothing she could do to stop it. When she turned towards Quill, Toni's eyes filled with tears as she say his body begin to disintegrate. "S-safe travels, Q-quill." She tried to add some humor to her heavy tone. Said man looked at her, distraught.
"Yup that's me. What do you want." Toni had a nonchalant expression on her face as she looked at the man in front of her. He had a stern expression on his face and quite the eyepatch. The man chuckled and went to sit next to her.
She was Toni God Damn Stark. The billionaire, Playgirl, philanthropist, genius, the list goes on. Her reputation took too long to create and she had to maintain it.  Quickly using the toilet, she then stripped off her clothes and got into the shower.
"I hate how early it is," Wade mumbled. "Why do we have to go on a field trip at this ungodly hour?"
Toni tossed the pillow on the floor and aggressively wiped her eyes. Tears still streamed down her face and she couldn’t make them stop. She curled into a ball and wrapped her hands around her middle. Her breath was erratic, but she wasn’t hyperventilating anymore. Thank fuck for that.
Her right hand rose up toward the back of her head. She sliced a portion of hair. She did this around the sides, but left some sections longer than the other. After almost an hour of hacking away at the speed of a snail, Toni was done.
"Of course I would. Who do you think allowed you guys to be taken in by T'Challa? To have Bucky be taken care of without percussions? Those were on my orders." She actually laughed a bit at Steve's utter incompetence.
Going on an adventure will either have two outcomes: you'll have a great time or you'll be traumatized. Let's go on a field trip then.
This is probably horrible and I’m so sorry about that. I’ve been having a slight writers block, but I’m powering though it.
“That’s my boy.” Before getting up to meet up with her teammates, she kissed her precious baby on the cheek. “I love you, sweetheart.”
"The model is fully completed, Boss. 100% Success. I do not sense anything wrong with it. I suggest you go out for a few hours. You haven’t rested in 37 hours. Last time you ate was 23 hours ago.”
And off they went, running down the halls. Toni shook her head, "Ah, what are we going to do with them, Jarvis?"
Now in the city, Wade changed in an actual alley and automatically began climbing up the rooftops. His skin lost all color. "Holy shit." The teen began to hyperventilate at the sight. There was some giant doughnut in the sky. And even worse.
“I’m so sorry, sweetheart. It had to be done.” Rhodey enveloped her in his arms as she started to sob. Broken ‘thank you’s' were heard every now and then and Rhodey just held her tighter. They stayed in that position for a while until Toni pulled back and smiled at her friend.
“Dr. Stark, I suggest we leave. You have a meeting with the press in four hours.” A warm hand fell on her shoulder. Peter gave her a gentle squeeze.
"Oh hijo. Perdóname. Lo siento mucho. Va a estar bien. Lo prometo. Dios, soy tan mala madre. Te amo demasiado. Mi bebé. Mi rayo de sol. Mi pequeña araña." Tears began to fall from the engineer's face as well. She rocked herself back and forth with Peter still in her arms. Quite cries and sniffles sounded from the small boy. He looked so, so
Toni grabbed the hologram screen and tried to turn it on. Luckily, it blinked to life when she touched it with her finger. Multiple pictures with a strange text underneath them filled her vision. Not really giving a shit, she clicked on the picture of the shower head and clicked a green bottom. Green means go right?
The atmosphere was tense. Both of them avoided eye contact and just looked around. After what felt like an eternity, Toni locked eyes with Steve.
“Jesus you took so long,” welcomed Clint in a condescending tone. The others just glared at her. Especially Wanda. “Were you two fucking of something?” He gestured at her and Peter.
Six and a half weeks had passed. Wade was pale and his face was sunken in. All of his hair was gone and lesions appeared all over his face. His heart was barely beating and he couldn't speak to anyone anymore.
”Miss, there are several floors you will have to go through. You will surely suffer severe injuries-“
While Natasha was horrified, Thor was outraged. He had an extremely vague idea of what happened by the talk they had yesterday. His hands almost cracked the table in anger. The man he thought was kind and brave was beaten on his fellow teammate. The god had to stop himself from using StormBreaker on Steve or giving him a good beating. Seeing his dear friend getting abused by the person she used to love angered Thor all the more. Sure, he and Loki had their quarrels, but he never tried to be that ruthless. Also, they were
Like she had heard, the baby’s head was sticking out. With shaking hands, she gently held onto it. Her gauntlets emitted a comforting warmth for the child.
"Join the Avengers. So far we just have Captain America. I was hoping you would also get your green friend to come along to? Or maybe that carnivorous alien pair? I also have two of my best agents in on it as well. Oh, and there has been reports of a god on Earth. That would be helpful to. So, will you do it? Or will you let Peter and Wade die from an attack you could've presented. What is it going to be, Stark?" He leaned in close, one eye glaring at her.
It was awkward in the dining hall. The breakfast from yesterday stood out in everyone's mind. Still, they were hungry and food was always good. The team sat in the same pairs as yesterday and they even tried to have a conversation.
“I’ll be able to track that. Nat, you and him are as close as two people can be. I’m trusting you to find him.”
A Venom blob asked. His tendrils were looking in a cupboard filled with utensils. Unceremoniously, Eddie plopped her head onto the table.
”Of course, Miss. This is the Oscorp building, and it has been set aflame. It is also evident that the chemicals and other materials in the building have caused the fire to be even more severe and give chemical burns to the victims.”
”And who are you to make such immature assumptions? Toni Stark is with Steve Rogers, remember.” Peter lowered his voice as much as possible. The archer was taken aback by the response.
Seeing Toni’s shivering, death like body, Steve broke down. That’s not the worst that happened. Not even close.
”What a shame. I didn’t get to shoot them at all,” a voice behind her said. It sounded deranged and insane.
old. He should be breastfed at this age. But Toni felt terrified to do so. Every time she looked at the piece of metal shoved into her chest made her stomach churn.
Toni watched as the Hulk appeared for a few seconds to only say 'No'. Interesting. Maybe the Hulk was scared.
We should be reaching the end of this fic in the next month or so. But don’t worry! There will be a sequel ;)
"Oh, Toni. I'm so sorry. This is so selfish of me, but I still want what we had back then. Can we ever have that?"
"Petey? What are you doing oogling that lizard? We have some spiders to see!" The brash voice of his best friend snapped Peter out of his trance. Huh. He didn't even realize he had been staring at the beautiful, albino reptile at all. Wait. Spiders?
They didn't understand. Where did their other go? Eddie never left them alone. Every second of every day, they were together. Inseparable. But here Venom was, alone and without their beautiful Eddie. Venom felt an enormous hole form inside them. Without Eddie, they were nothing. Hell, Venom had already shrunk themselves down to cope with the lost of their host. No. Not lost. Eddie couldn't be gone.
“Loki has never done such a thing. That makes it all the more horrible. I’m sorry for your loss. You and Rogers seemed close.”
”Wait. Why do you call her ‘sir’? She isn’t a man nor of a worthy title like the Captain.” The snide comment from Wanda made Peter bristle. He really hated her. Not dislike or loathe, hate.
The boy coughed harshly in his hands. When he looked at them, he sighed, there was blood. Like all the other times.
"I am! For my brother and my people!" Thor stood up and rose Stormbreaker in his hand. "Thanos has made me lose everything I hold dear. Now it is time to return the favor. What are you Midgardians going to do it for?"
Toni didn't go to her room after the exchange. In fact, she went to Bruce's. She had a job to do and thinking about
Hello everyone! Man it's been a while! School has been keeping me busy that I had to put everything on hiatus. I'm back though! Thank you for all the comments, hits, and kudos! They keep me going. You are all amazing!!
The doctor sawed off his feet and forearms before dropping the bloodied weapon. He began to unbuckle his belt and tightened Wade’s bonds.
“Not really. Remember how long it took me to understand the purpose of the Men of Boxes? I still can’t believe you Midgardians have a mailman and a pizza-man. Why can’t you just acquire such things yourself?”
“Don’t roll your eyes. Scott’s right. We can easily make a multitude of paradoxes if we do the wrong things. There is no going back. Billions of timelines will be put in risk or, hell, created if that happens. So, no goofing off. Understand?”
The next morning, everyone suited up into their new suits. Toni had given them each a device that would take them to the past and back to the present. She explained how they only had one shot at doing this.
"Tones, you always act like you are an unfeeling person, but it's so easy to see how much you care. Who was the person that randomly started paying for my rent and bills when I was at my lowest? When V-Venom was g-gone and I couldn't do anything but sob in bed? Who was that? It was you Toni. You may not believe it, but you have the biggest heart I have ever seen. No doubt about it. You'll be one hell of a mother Stark, and so will I. We'll be on this journey together, you here me?"
"It's okay, hon, don't worry. I'm here." He continued to whisper soothing things into her ears as she began to break down. Suddenly, a voice broke her from her millionth spiral.
“Indeed, there are countless of alternate universes that exist. With the infinity stones, Thanos must’ve been able to travel to one of them. He most likely used the space stone.” Wong said solemnly.
Nick Fucking Fury was not giving her a break. The bastard sent files on the upcoming team he had formed. There was a meeting today with some of the team at her home. To say she was pissed off would be an understatement.
“Toni? Hurry up, you’re going to be late for your meeting with the press!” a familiar voice was heard through the thick walls of Toni’s workshop. Speaking of the engineer, she was currently working on a new suit, and she definitely didn’t spend the last several days working on it.
Wade smiled gratefully and began to ran ahead of the group. Unfortunately, they were caught by an employee. "What are you two rascals doing. Running like that?" A woman with mousy hair asked, smirking.
Sobs wracked her entire body. She screamed and wailed. It wasn't true it just wasn't. The information was wrong. Dr. Strange was wrong.
”Yeah, and Cap knew about it for years. Never even bothers to tell me. Like any person, I was angry and attacked Bucky. It lead into a two on one fight. L-let’s     j-just say I was given the cold shoulder in Siberia.”
It took a bit to hear their footsteps, signaling that they had left. Finally. All the engineer could do was sigh heavily. Looking around her room, her eyes locked on a Stark Phone. Realization dawned on her that Rhodey has left it there for her. Without realizing, she stumbled toward the phone on the table near the door and went back to her bed.
Trembling, Wade took off his mask and reach towards the round object. He pressed the button and a screen shown through. The video started.
A shot of web fluid came from it and it pinned the man to the wall by his left hand. “Stay away from my mother.”
The elevator doors dinged open at that moment. Toni prepared herself. She was in an old MIT shirt, jeans, and socks.
"Enough with the sorries, Cap. That won't change anything anymore. What's done is done. You can't change the past." The engineer's voice was calm, as if this was a casual discussion for her.
“I’ll go! I’ve gone through the quantum realm before!” Scott excitedly said. “How far will I be traveling?”
"No! Seriously, I m-mean it." His voice got choked up, "W-what if I'll never see you again? Your healing factor might not always work, and I'm not the most careful person either." There was a heavy lump in his throat. Tears then fell as he felt Wade's warm hand cup his face.
THIS HURT MY HEART TO WRITE BUT I HAD TO DO IT. Yes, it was Weapon X that stole Wade. They were getting paid by someone after all.
Sounds of gunshots, people screaming, glass breaking, and other voices were everywhere. They got closer and closer to their room. Toni stood as tall as possible, repulsors fully charged up.
Natasha looked on in terror at the scene. Her once friend was being beaten to a pulp by two super soldiers. Toni didn’t even look like she was actually trying to hurt them. They, on the other hand, certainly did. The spy couldn’t stand to watch Steve be so merciless. As he started to smash his own shield into Toni’s arc reactor, tears started to well up in her eyes. How could she have been so blind and ignorant? This was Toni, a caring, sarcastic, incredible woman, being left alone to die by the people that cared about her.
Also yes. WE GET SOME MORE CHARACTERS. Young Deadpool is based off of the little hero AU by pixelzq! Check it out: http://ask-thelittleheros.tumblr.com
"Oh, I've heard of your group. So secretive yet so involved in every part of the world. Especially the tragedies."
Straining her amplified hearing with her suit as much as she could, Toni heard muffled yells and cries. Bingo.
"Don't worry, hun. He's okay. I'll show you to him." Eddie scooped him up and began to walk towards the end of the room. All the other kids and chaperones were crying and hugging their own children tightly or reassuring others. Carnage had actually turned into his symbiote for and sunk into his mom, being comforted by his father on the inside. A little over a minute passed until they reached the end of the area. Gently, Eddie put Peter down and watched as he ran towards his friend.
It took a long time, but Toni agreed to the surgery. Now, it was two days after. Wade was still unconscious. The test results should also come back today as well. She just hoped they would be good.
"Toni, we have the results. I will not sugar coat anything. Wade Wilson has stage four brain cancer."
No words were spoken as Rhodey cleaned out all her injuries with a disinfectant cream from Bruce's large suitcase. As he did that, the ladder was preparing the stitches and bandages for his friend. Toni was motionless during the procedure. After an hour or so passed, the two finished and let Toni try to sleep. For once, she did since she passed out out not long after.
She never thought she had maternal instincts, but it turns out that she most certainly did. All that Toni could think of was protect Peter and kill that monster.
"Like the Hydra attack on Oscorp that killed the Parker family? That reminds my, how is Peter?" Fury's smug expression made Toni's blood boil. How did this asshole know about her son. She had been as secretive as she could. Fuck.
These boys were going to be the death of her. "Eddie! Venom! Wake the heck up!" They had had a massive slumber party over the weekend after Eddie's article on pitbulls went viral and was one of the top article's written that month. Toni remembered waking up to a screaming Venom how Eddie became 'less of a loser' with Eddie frantically nodding in return. Carnage was also their, yelling about how his mom was the best writer in the universe.
That was a shocker. The Hulk never admitted being weaker than someone else, leave it to Thanos to change that.
"I'm going to be in here for a while. Don't let anyone in," the thin, short woman whispered in a hoarse voice. Before she could close the door, Banner placed his hand to stop it. He looked nervous, yet there was a strong resolute look in his eyes.
”Toni, are you alright?” That made her stop. Thor rarely called her by her first name. Fuck, she had made him worried. Time to escape.
”You may not remember calling it that because you were intoxicated, but it is a suit that is meant to ease yourself and others. It is not very bulky and intimidating, yet it is one of the most powerful suits you have.”
“I do not think you should be talking. You’ve killed and tortured so many people. Including doctors, generals, lieutenants, cornels, commanders, et cetera. Speaking of your deeds, can you lift the spell on my superior? That would be much appreciated. Oh and maybe-“
The people who took Wade were obviously badly people. Very bad peoples. For the next several years, they would be the only people he would ever know.
Something in her mind told her that she was probably going to have even more trouble getting weight on him.
Oh. Oh, he did. Very much so. His father used one of these all the time. On him. On strangers. On his mother. A sickening smile that should never have been on a child's face appeared on his own. He giggled. It was kinda funny. These guys took him away, hurt him, and BROKE him and now they are laughing.
“Sí, yo estoy...uh...fine!” The boy scrambled from his bed in a hurry. “But, why’s Wade here? I thought he went home?”
"It's a pretty good deal, right? You're going away and I get money for sending you. Better get ready, you're leaving next month. Good riddance." He kicked his son's face on more time. With that, he left to his room to go watch TV. Wade still on the ground.
"You've done nothing to reconcile! You're so stuck up and arrogant that you think that you're right all the time. Well, you're not! After everything, you still think that you did nothing wrong? Bullshit! You ruined my life in every way possible." Her breath was shaky. She meant every word. The bastard was always in her head, haunting her. Each time she did something slightly bad, she just thought about how disappointed Captain America would be. She had seen him as her idol when she was young and naive.
Another sigh. God, she didn’t want to leave them. Up there were all of the Avengers plus some new additions. Tensions were high. Especially after Steve and the others (not including Thor and Bruce because they were still MIA) adopted Wanda into their team.
Luckily, her CEO always came prepared, having makeup wipes, hair accessories, new makeup, and even a towel for her hair. As the woman fixed up the tired engineer, Toni couldn’t help but let her thoughts wander.
Finally, things are being put into place. Thanos was going to be beaten up soon. Everyone will be brought back. The world restored. They would make sure of it
Anyways, everyone looked at Bruce and Toni for answers. Both chuckled and just sighed. “Time travel!”
during a press-conference. A reporter had stupidly asked about how Toni feels about people like 'Eddie Brock'.  Needless to say that that reporter wasn't seen ever again, well maybe at your local grocery store as a cashier. Venom still remembered how touched Eddie was at her best friend's words.
The kid didn't deserve the actual verbal abuse from those parents mouths. Names like 'insane', 'nuisance', 'idiot', 'retarded', or 'disgusting' were thrown throughout the entire trip. Because Wade wasn't
Finally, he found a secluded area and sat down. Oh god, how could he forget? He had died on Titan. In his mother’s arms. Fuck, he could still remember his pleads to not go and the look of horror in Mom’s eyes. Peter put his head between his knees, wrapping his arms around them. He began to breakdown.
She walked off into her room, suit still on. Toni couldn’t be bothered to take it off. All that she did was flop onto her stiff bed and look at the ceiling. How the hell was she going to build this machine? There was no signature she could follow. Or maybe there was. These past months have taught her that anything is possible. Exhibit A: Wizards. Exhibit B: Talking raccoon.
"She's such a bitch." The boy cackled, not really caring of his volume. Toni sputtered at the language.
Anyways, the genius laughed again before having a more serious expression on her face. She had a flurry of emotions on her face, ranging from fear to excitement to frustration. Eddie sighed, "I can tell something's up Tones. Spill?" A shaky exhale was heard from her close friend.
Being parents to the troublemaker that was Carnage, Eddie and Venom tended to sleep as much as they could. It was a rare occurrence when they could have a full nights sleep with being fully time parents and a crime fighter and a journalist. Even Venom began to truly love the beauty that is naps.
"How disgusting.” There was no ounce of affection that Thor usually used when talking to teammates. Both Natasha and Steve flinched. While Natasha’s face had tears streaming down it, Steve’s had created a stoney facade. This only angered the god further.
Each of them clicked their ‘watches’ and stood tall. The device around them came to life and powered up. They all looked at one another and remembered,
"Duh! We're going to Oscorp remember! The awesome-est  place in the world?!!" Peter jumped up in down in his seat, doe eyes sparkling.
Turns out it did, showering the short woman with icy cold water. Oh right. She didn't click on any settings. Damn.
"What is it, kiddo?" Toni turned around and saw her son right next to her. She had gotten used to how surprisingly nimble and quick her son was, so it didn't startle her to see the boy out of nowhere.
, but I couldn't stop her. You of all people should know how she is." Rhodey glared harshly at Steve, only for Tony to look at him pleadingly. He nodded at her and begrudgingly left the room.
Each of them were stick figures and different colors. Toni was red, Peter was blue, Eddie was gold, Venom was black, Carnage was orange, Pepper was brown, Happy was grey, Rhodey was green, Jarvis was pink (He was a small happy face in the air), the dog was purple, the cat was magenta, the spider was also black, and Wade was basically a rainbow of colors. Her heart warmed when she saw the arrow pointing at her, Eddie, and Venom that said: 'MOMMY', 'AUNTIE EEDEE', and 'UNCLE VEN'. It was truly adorable. However, the animals made her raise an eyebrow.
"A lot, big guy, a lot." A gloved hand patted his shoulder and he looked to see Steve looking at him with pain in his eyes.
Toni flew as fast as she could around the building, shooting a special white foam that was perfect for putting out all types of fires. Her heart was beating out of chest at the site of the blazing fire. It was unbelievable hot, no doubt giving its victims third-degree burns. As she flew around the building, she got a good look at the people affected.
“You’ve got it all under control. I don’t see the need for us to do anything. It was because of your impulsiveness and recklessness that caused all of this. The public is scared because of you. The damages and casualties were accidents as well. They need to see that.” There was anger in Steve’s voice. He hated being told what to do. “You have to take account for your own responsibilities, Toni. It’s your fault. It always is.”
"Wade! How do you know those words?!" She tried to sound stern, but she couldn't hide the amusement in her voice. The kid was right, Linda was a complete and utter bitch.
"Petey, no. No. No." Denial filled Wade as he ran to his room. Truth be told, it was exactly what he feared the most. Once he saw the glowing Spiderman trinket, his entire world fell apart. The Boxes were dead silent.
"I will alert you when your children wake up." Toni chuckled at his cheeky tone. Quietly, she undressed and took an icy shower. When she came out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around her body, she sighed in relief to see that the two still hadn't woken up. Good. Toni put on some dark navy jeans, a black t-shirt with the Iron Man helmet in the middle (a gift from Wade), and matching black, heeled boots. The woman was about to do her hair when she heard a groan behind her.
Oh wait. Thanos. The memories flooded back and Peter started to run in a random direction. He only saw
"Let's get you to your room litter mister." She quickly walked to the room that she had grown to love, careful of the adorable baby in her arms. The now-mother stopped when she heard a small whine. "Never mind. You are wide awake. God, you are already taking after me, never sleeping." She said dramatically as Peter roused from his nap.
“Oh, Webby,” Peter said aloud, walking over to her terrarium. He took out the tarantula, and she immediately crawled onto his shoulder and began to chitter. It was her own way of purring. But, it was incredibly hard to hear it. How was he hearing it so easily. In fact, he would feel every granule of her soft fur. His head snapped behind him when he felt her crawling around his neck and hissing.
Toni was in her kitchen, nursing a cup of coffee with way too much sugar. It was almost midnight, but the engineer didn’t feel tired. A usual.
She got out the mix and poured it into a bowl. Thank god for pre-made food. All she had to do was add water and, boom, pancakes. "Jarvis, open up the windows." It was way too dark, given that it was still dead in the morning. Fortunately, the entire space was filled with warm sunlight. It was May, so the weather was pretty good if she was being honest. After getting the proper amount of water in a separate container, she heard the sound of running coming from the hallway.
Hating the silence, Thor banged his left fist on the table. Everyone's head turned toward the god. His eyes were crackling with lightning and thunder, truly looking like an angered god.
Only herself and Peter were trusted enough with the information. More times than she could count, Wade had come home with them, crying. The small boy would bury himself into her chest and cry about what happened at school. How other children through food at him and call him names and how no adults did anything about it. All their parents told them not to trust Wade. He was strange and crazy according to their snotty mothers and fathers. Toni couldn't understand why they would do that to a child. Sure, Wade had severe schizophrenia, but that shouldn't make him any less of a
. Now here she was, bleeding heavily and unable to stand up. The wizard gave her a warm smile and had a strong resolution in his blue-gray eyes.
Wade sighed heavily. There were vain attempts at speaking but his voice refused to work. Even if he hadn’t said anything, Toni knew that Wade was upset about something. Most likely someone.
Peter. Oh god, Peter. More recordings passed, and Toni broke more and more. He was her son and she was his mother. Never in her life had she imagined such a thing, but it happened. She remembered how overjoyed and giddy she was when Peter called her Mom for the first time. Tears fell freely from her face as she basked in her old memories.
His words struck a cord with everybody. No one really knew, until today. Without hesitation, the recording from Friday played. It had taken him a while to collect the footage, trying to keep Toni unaware of his actions.
Five weeks. That's how much time Wade had left. Just one month and a week. Thirty eight days. That was so little time. Wade was so young. It wasn't fair. Toni's heart shattered. He was like a son to her. His adorable smile, wacky jokes, energetic personally, and everything else about him would be gone from her and Peter's and Eddie's lives. How would Peter even deal with this? The two were inseparable. It was clear how much they cared for the other. Why does Wade have to be ripped away from them so suddenly. God, it wasn't fair.
Rhodey smiled at her, seeing how she showed happiness at someone besides himself and Banner. Again, the moment of tranquility was broken by a certain patriot.
The atmosphere changed when they all heard the soft shuffling of feet. When they looked up, they saw the bandaged body of Toni Stark. Her jumpsuit was ripped, making her leggings look like shorts and her hoodie look like a tank top. The only piece of clothing that was intact was her black socks that she found in her room. Even though that she had new clothes to wear, she wore her old ones. The woman walked with a heavy limp towards the buffet. All she took was large mug of coffee. She looked at Thor and smiled weakly, sitting next to him. Immediately, Thor wrapped her in a soft and warm hug, shaking slightly. He had lost everything except for his close friend. At first, they didn't get along, but they started to become friends quite quickly.
Still, there were wonderful times on those trips. Peter and Wade laughed the entire time and were so excited about everything. They would point out the window and get Toni's attention towards a cow they saw or indulge her on random facts that she already knew on the animal. It was beyond adorable. The best part for her was the journey back, Wade and Peter were tuckered out and fell asleep on her. Their faces were so peaceful and content that Toni's heart soared. It would remind her that there was good in the world. Usually next to her, Eddie was experiencing the same exact thing with her son. The boy was tucked into her side and Venom was wrapped around him in a makeshift blanket.
Toni respected the man in front of her quite a bit. He saved so many lives and was the best in his field. She knew it was a bit selfish to only want the best in the field to perform this surgery. Wade was a very strong kid. He would definitely make it through. “I’ll think about it. Thank you, Dr. Strange.”
"We all know that we can call people on this, so how about we make some calls? If we're going to defeat an all powerful being, we are going to need more than an out of touch team. Who's with me?"
"Steve?" Said soldier turned sharply towards the voice. He gasped in horror at the sight. Bucky was turning to dust. Immediately, Steve ran towards his best friend. This wasn't happening. This
With the help of Bruce, Toni was informed of everything that happened. She chuckled at the image of Scott as an old man. There was a guilty look on her friend’s face, so she was quick to thank and reassure him.
They had given Toni a way too generous amount of vibranium. It was Shuri’s idea. She knew Toni would create great things with the material. Toni hugged the girl, whispering how she looked forward to working with her in the future.
“H-HELLO? IS ANYONE HERE?” Her suit lit up to provide light in the dark floor. The fire was easily extinguished by her foam blasters. Thank goodness the fire didn’t start up to here.
Both men didn't dare  to talk about what had happened in Titan. The look in Toni's eyes was enough and the fact that she returned with just one other person.
The next few weeks passed by in a blur. Everyone was scrambling for an idea of what their plan of attack will be. No real solution besides time travel was given. During this time, Toni worked and worked on the mechanism. She wouldn't sleep, drink, or eat, completely focused on the project. Only Rhodey was able to convince her to come out of her makeshift lab. If that didn't work, Hulk or Thor would need to physically drag her out.
After she was done with the shampoo, she looked for a shaver and found a sharp objects with a purple cream. Bingo.
After finishing her order and signing a couple autographs from the people in the store, including the shocked cashier, Toni sat outside of the shop. No one really was around at the time, preferring to stay inside. It was October, and it was getting pretty cold.
" Colin Donnell's charming voice wafted through their home. Both of them absolutely adored the loving song and swayed to the song. Eddie was decked out in a black cocktail dress and black heels. Her medium length hair was curled beautifully and her eyes could be mistaken for sapphires. She looked amazing and the normally barefaced woman had put on some makeup. Dark red lipstick that were screaming to be kissed, dark eye-shadow to make her eyes pop even more, and other things that Venom didn't know of.
Pain filled Rhodey's heart to see the absence of Peter Parker, the boy that Toni had grown to love. Multiple times, she had told him how worried or proud she was of the teen. In secret, she had heard every single one of Peter's voicemails and messages. She would call Rhodey late at night from her nightmares about Peter getting killed. Each nightmare made her build more and more protocols and tools into his suit. It was evident that she loved the by and basically considered him her son that she never had. At times, Peter would accidentally call her 'Mom' which always resulted in Toni buying Peter whatever he wanted and more. Rhodey knew that Toni spoiled Peter and treated him like how she wished her parents had treated her all those years ago. No matter how many things he got, Peter never acted spoiled and tried his best to return the favor every time. He would give her cards, small presents, and even some churros. Little did he know that she treasured them more than life. Of course, she knew Peter was spending his limited money in trying to repay her, so Toni would give him salary of a world renown doctor instead of a 'secretary'. Their bond was strong and it was evident how much they cared for each other. For example, Peter got the flu and Toni immediately came and took care of him with Aunt May, only for her to get the same treatment in return when she got the same sickness.
All around him were spiders, spinning webs without a care in the world. Peter carefully walked through the enclosure, not wanting to disturb the spiders. As friendly and affectionate as Webby was, spiders were not to be messed with. Just appreciate them and treat them with respect. The entire room was coated in a blue light that made the entire space seem creepy and futuristic. It was peaceful, and Peter managed to slow the rapid beat of his heart. Eventually, he reached the end of the room, where the last spider rested. This one seemed special. It had red and blue splotches all over it and carried a mysterious aura to it. Tempting. Maybe if he could just touch it.
"Alright, Toni. Alright." Steve smiled warmly and kissed her on the cheek, walking away to his room.
“Yeah. Think of it like I’m going on vacation.” Wade tugged at his sleeves nervously. A pained cough erupted from his chest, leading him into a violent coughing fit. At that second, Toni was on him, patting and rubbing his back and chest. It helped it stop and Wade could breath again. “I don’t know when I’ll be back.”
She ran in front of her son and wrapped him in her arms. Peter began to whimper and cry from the scare.
"Alright everyone! Put your seat-belts on and keep quite. Mrs. King and I will be taking roll." A shrill voice yelled. Oh god, it was Linda, the president of the PTA club. Her name fit the generic, uptight personality that she had. Toni and Wade rolled their eyes at the same time.
"Toni, you need to calm down." His soothing voice didn't calm her. Stephen felt something he wasn't prepared to feel when seeing Toni Stark break. His body moved on its own. "We will do everything we have to prolong his life. This is just an estimate." He put his hand on her shoulder, getting her attention. Even if he didn't really believe it, he said, "Miracles are real. There's a chance that he will make it through."
The man shook his head from the nostalgic thoughts and focused on Toni. Her short, brown hair was a mess and her chocolate eyes held a severe torment to them.
"Sorry? You should say sorry to Jeffrey. I'm actually proud of that prank you pulled. I should have thought of that sooner!" Wade crossed his arms, bag still in hand.
Her thoughts stopped when she felt a tug on her nipple. Toni gasped at the sensation and looked down. It was Peter, suckling to his heart's delight. She couldn't conceal a soft coo at the adorable sight. Her baby son in her arms.
Hello! I hope you all enjoyed it! It was very difficult to write. Next chapter is the training of Wade and about Avengers 1. Please let me know if I should raise the rating. I probably should, but there won't be chapters this horrible in a while.
Toni carried a sleeping Peter in her arms as she walked up to the charter bus. Chaperones and other children were standing around on the loading sight, waiting to go inside. She didn't need to worry about Wade running off as she carried Peter, he was clinging onto her shirt tightly. His long, blonde hair was pulled in a small ponytail with the help of Toni. In turn, she put her own hair in a ponytail to make Wade feel better at his choice of style.
"I don't know S-Steve. I d-d-don't know." Toni pulled away and stared at his tear streaked face, "We have to get ready for Thanos. See you there big guy." Toni smiled weakly and patted Steve on his shoulder.
to him, an act that few people did to him. However, his mother hated seeing her precious son hanging out with the 'insane and retarded kid and the utter brat'. If Toni was going to make it through this trip, she had to stop thinking about reasons to blow up Linda.
There were laughs and sounds of agreements. No, Toni Stark would not cry. She didn’t feel anything towards it. She didn’t even hear Steve’s nod at Wanda, still angry at Toni. The second they left, Toni was wrapped into a hug by Peter. Later in the day, she had a full on attack from the spell.
HELLOOO!! Another chapter with the angst cranked up! It's time for some flashbacks and even more tears shed. I won't italicize this whole chapter even though it's a flashback, so just a heads up!
With that in mind, Peter drew closer to the spider. It was alone on it's web, large and beautiful. His eyes dilated as he continued to come closer, in a trance. Reaching his arm out towards the silent creature, he smiled kindly. It was like he didn't have any control over his mind. If he did, Peter would be far away from the spider and just wait in a corner for his mom. However, he didn't feel like that. Completely overpowered with the need to touch it. The spider slowly got off of its web and crawled on Peter's arm, dark legs tickling him a little. It continued to crawl across his arm, but then stopped. It began to run all over Peter's body, stopping at his neck.
Thank goodness, they made it there safely. Venom sunk back into Eddie. His aunt immediately enveloped him in a warm hug, whispering comforting words to him. She was crying with relief and hugged him tighter.
“I will,” the Russian paused. “You know, I had nothing before this job. No family or life. He was the first person to ever show me any kind of love.”
Weakly, Eddie smiled at their love. Venom could feel Eddie dying. No. They wouldn't let their other fade away! They've been apart before, during the fight with Riot, and it was the most painful experience they have ever faced.
"Mom! You were supposed to wake us up!" Peter whined, rubbing his eyes. Promptly, he flopped back on the his pillow and nearly fell asleep again. Next to him was Wade, fully awake and ready to go.
"I need a doctor over here!" She yelled, holding Wade close. The boy reeked of sweat and puke, the poor kid. However, the boy fervently shook his head at the idea of getting a doctor. He had always hated them, and Wade didn't have any form of medical insurance (Though, he didn't tell that to Toni.).
The effects of her spell still had an affect on her. As if the woman heard her, she could feel the pain in her head already come. Her eyes began to fog with her red mist again. Dammit.
From the beginning of the day, Eddie and Venom were on edge. There was this tense feeling neither of them could shake off. All that they could do was be on high alert at all times. Eddie couldn't stop shaking her legs or fiddling with his hands. She felt like something was coming.
"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that." Toni swallowed her sobs as she clung to her anchor. "Is this about, Peter?" Steve tried to keep his voice gentle. He had a feeling that the she was still in shock about the death of Peter. It was so irresponsible of her to force the boy to become her apprentice or some sort. It was a shame he turned to dust.
"Drew something!" He flung a piece of paper towards her. Too excited to say anything accept those two words.
Quietly, she left her room and headed towards the open dining hall. Her eyes scanned the cabinets until she found a machine that looks like a Keurig. Getting what she presumed was a large mug, Toni waited for the liquid fuel to come.
"It is not obvious? We kill him. Get everyone back. Simple." It wasn't that simple, but Thor had the same hope everyone did.
God, why did she agree to this? She just wanted to go home. To Peter. Give him a million hugs and then some more. They would watch movies until dusk or work on Legos. Maybe build a robot out of random stuff. Peter would then laugh as he sees a toaster sight the alphabet. He would smile and giggle. But it wasn’t that easy.
He was sitting next to her in his same spot. Toni sat at the head of the table with Rhodey on her right. The colonel didn't take his eyes off of the once Captain. Steve's head dropped onto his hand and he swallowed heavily.
. Without really thinking, the broken women gripped at her punctured abdomen as the memories flooded back. No. She can't think of that now. Toni could not break down with
"Quill?" It was Drax. Toni turned around to see the large man collasped and turn to dust. Dread filled Toni's very core.
“Wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. You are better than Logan,” he whispered in awe. “What if....” Looking at the chainsaw on a stand, he smiled.
"Do you know how fucking expensive that shit is?!! Why would I spend my money on a little shit like you, huh?!" Wade only winced when his father slapped him roughly. Then there was a punch. A kick. A slam. A slap. Repeat. "You are such a damn brat! I spend my money on you and you have the fucking audacity to ask me for something so expensive!!" Another punch. Finally, he stopped and huffed at the crumpled boy. "Good thing I was given this today." A paper was thrown at him.
Toni chuckled at the their banter. Her heart warmed at the sight of their young love. When she looked over from her spot on the counter, she saw that Wade was giving Peter a noogie. Next to her, Eddie rolled her eyes.
This wasn't ever supposed to happen. It should have been impossible for Eddie to disappear. Through thick or thin, they were together. Hell, Eddie even wanted to settle, down and have a family. With them of all people. Even Toni was surprised, but the woman, without hesitation, bought them an apartment in New York that she paid off. She absolutely refused to let Eddie pay the ungodly expensive rents. After hours of begging, Toni agreed to let Eddie pay for SOME of the bills herself. The billionaire knew that everyone was giving Eddie Brock a bunch of shit for something that happened years ago, causing her to constantly work odd jobs to barely make ends meet. Now, every company was offering her jobs after Toni Fucking Stark announced that 'Evelynn Brock is an example of strong ass woman. Any employer would be more than lucky to have her. She works her ass off every day and is one of the sweetest people I have ever met. Hell, she's basically my sister.
Grabbing a clear bottle that looked like shampoo, she slathered her dirty hair in it. When she looked down, she could see how the running water was slightly tinted crimson. That's horrifying.
Thor thundered over to the pair. “She was your teammate. She housed you. She did everything for you. She loved you. And you did this to her.” The pure disgust in his voice was palpable.
A small hand on her arm was enough to clear her head. It was Peter, eyes shining bright. A year ago, those eyes were dull. That was the year that she told Peter what happened to his biological family. She remembered the look of utter shock on Peter. The words that he spoke that day were forever ingrained in her mind.
The Oscorp building stood tall in front of the group. Gasps of awe and wonder could be heard. It truly was an incredible building. However, it held many tragedies that often went unheard. Toni lost count of the accidents and deaths that occurred there. To say she was a bit frustrated at the school for sending
"You would have still helped him, wouldn't you?" Steve's voice was small and his eyes were pinpricks.
"Parker? Are you talking about the baby you saved during the accident in Oscorp?" Toni nodded. "Oh goodness, that's so sweet of you! I'm so happy for you!"
“Yup. What about you Pointbreak? Something bugging you?” She tried to add her usual snark to her voice, failing miserably.
Aka Steve and Team Cap gets what’s coming to them (don’t worry it’s only for a bit but Rhodey is a salty boi)
“Over five months ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends, we lost family, we lost a part of ourselves. Today, we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams, you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each, no mistakes. No do overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know. That doesn’t mean we should know what to expect. Be careful, look out for each other. This is the fight our our lives, and we’re gonna win. Whatever it takes. Good luck.”
Laying on her uninjured side, Toni grabbed her phone and looked through her photo album. One was called:      “You are my mom! You’re my mom! Oogie boogie woogie!”
The beeps were few and far between. It just kept getting slower. Until, they stopped. Wade had flatlined. His organs had failed a few days ago.
“Oh, there is! I know I can’t do anything to you right now. But I swear that I will not hesitate to put a bullet in your head if you do anything to Toni. This mission is the only thing preventing me from unaliving you this very second.”
"You know how you're pregnant, right? And that you are going to become parents?" That made her shocked, it was so rare for Toni to show her maternal side. Usually it was Eddie ranting about her worries or asking her what clothes would look cuter while Toni gave her best advice with a smile. Sometimes, Eddie would be able to see the pure joy and awe in her eyes as she talked about her pregnancy. In present time, she was nearing the end of her second trimester, and Venom never stopped gushing  over her baby bump or showing his curiosity in human biology. It was adorable.
“Antonia Stark, it’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Steve Rogers.” Captain America stood before her and shook her hand first. The old fashioned man was a bit surprised to see such a small woman have such a strong grip.
Toni huffed. “Petey, you have to go to your room. Mommy has some...friends... coming over.” She ruffled his hair.
When she was about to head to her workshop, her phone went off. It was an emergency, a building was in flames. Time for Ironman.
"Pewer, whu are yoo doin'?" She got a small shrug in return. Peter immediately stopped when he heard a yell somewhere. Quickly, Peter ran behind another couch, giggling like a maniac.
”I have detected several heat signatures on the top floor. It seems that they are huddled together.”
"Alright, kids, this might be the most spooky part of the tour, but the most interesting!" A young man, a new employee no doubt, said with rigor. "You see, these spiders are special. We've been testing with a bunch of chemicals and other elements. We hope use their advanced silk for sutures and other medical uses. They are kept here in the chamber, if you squint you can see some of them!" A wave of 'woahs' followed. Everyone crowded around the metal door, trying to get a look. Eventually, they got bored and wanted to move on already. Reasonable when having an elementary school attention span. Not Peter, though. He was so intrigued by the arachnids.
Venom tried to shout. Yes, their other must have gone to prank them or something. She didn't just turn to dust in their arms.
All that Thor did was look disappointedly at her and shake his head. Lucky for her, his anger was more focused on their supposed ‘leader’.  Said leader was trembling slightly.
“So, Clint actually went missing, and we now have almost a hundred murder reports? Nat, is this the same Barton we’re talking about?”
It was discovered that Pepper, Happy, Fury, Maria, and Korg were dusted. For three straight days, Toni refused to leave her room. Thor had grown silent from that knowledge that he had lost yet another dear friend.
"I-I-It's alright W-Wade. Y-Y-Y-You c-can rest. J-Just kn-kn-know th-that I-I-I love you. S-S-So m-much." While everyone else was silent, Peter still talked.
Thor leaned over and whispered cheekily, “More like a miniature male.” It took everything she had to not burst out laughing. She gave a quick glare at him before a smile spread across her face.
“Spiderman. Stand down.” Toni’s stern voiced stopped him from doing anything else. A bit of guilt was felt for being so disrespectful, but he couldn’t help it.
The boy was gone. Turned into dust. It got harder to remember the good times when all she could think about was how terrified Peter was as he crumbled in her arms. His apologies and cries not to go will always haunt her.
"Uh-Uh... Sorry! We got too excited. This place is so incredible after all!" Peter gave his best smile at the stout woman. She just laughed and ruffled his hair.
Her breath hitched and she could swallow the lump in her throat. The engineer wrapped her arms around her self and tried to keep it together. This was supposed to give her closure with Steve, never want him back. But she
Toni fitted Scott into a new suit that she created for everyone. It was a nice white with red along the sides. Well, she had to give credit to Nat for her fashion advice. The two had reconciled over the months and became close once again.
”Thank god you’re here. He’s been crying all morning.” The tired voice of the owner interrupted Toni’s thoughts. She was a tall woman with dirty blonde hair and turquoise eyes with slight bags under them.
Toni stared at her wall without emotion. The blank wall was suddenly very interesting to her. She should have kept her mouth shut. Still, she meant every word.
The crazed man took Wade from the young woman and brought him to his lab. His other assistants greeted him respectfully. He placed Wade on a metal table and attached wires and tubes to him.
Toni went back into the shower that had automatically shut off when she stepped out, grabbing the makeshift razor. It was incredibly sharp and Toni might have purposely been more careless near her arms while shaving. It didn't matter.
Author’s mental health has been horrible as well. I can only apologize again for the wait and how bad this chapter is.
happen to his host and children. On the other hand, the boy tucked in her arms looked apathetic. Wade didn't look scared at all, in fact, he began to laugh a bit. His eyes glazed over as he began to talk to himself again. Quickly, Peter ran towards them, but was blocked when there was a flying piece of debris that blocked him off from all the rest. He looked back, only to find that his mother had already flown off in search of the attackers.
Everyone was awkwardly eating their breakfast in the dining hall. Except for Toni, she still refused to leave her room. It took a lot of arguing from Rhodey to make them all leave the poor woman alone. Because of Bruce starting to turn green as the yelling progressed, everyone stopped and agreed to not visit her.
"True." The engineer exited her room and headed towards the kitchen. Before that she cupped her hand and yelled down the halls, "Boys get ready! Or else no pancakes!"
Unexpectedly, Toni launched herself at Stephen. She buried herself in his chest and tightened her arms around her. Right now, she wasn't thinking and just acted. Dr. Strange was a source of comfort, and she needed someone to hold her.
Voices. Voices were all around him. In his head and surrounding him. God, he was so tired. His head was on fire and felt like it might implode. Wade new he was dying. All he could remember was being in his bed with his true family all around him. They must be so worried.
"Put me doooown!!! I'm going to puke!" It was an empty threat, but Toni complied. Peter was still on the bed, dead asleep. That was until Wade yelled at the top of his lungs.
She tried to keep an emotionless facade, inside she was furious and slightly scared, "What do you want, Fury." It was a command, all her politeness she was trained to give to people who asked her questions were gone. This wasn't a reporter, just a stuck up idiot.
”Yes, Miss.” Jarvis’s worried tone was as clear as day. She felt guilty for yelling, but what other choice does she have? Use the elevator?
It was filled with questions on what new inventions Toni had in store, being Iron Man, her sex life, yadda yadda yadda. She had grown used to the personal and annoying questions.
It’s so much easier to bottle up emotions and ignore problems, so Toni did just that. Even though everyone was still angry at one another, there was a more daunting matter at hand.
"Don't mention it. Also, you better prepare for all the shopping we're going to do for you." Eddie gave a wicked grin at Toni's shocked expression, "No buts. Alright, see you later nerd!"
Toni showed up in a new suit. It was a deep red, covered in swirls of blue and white, and had gold platting around her limbs and chest. She looked at the shocked faces and grinned.
So he did. With strength he didn't know he had, he punched out the two men's teeth. They fell to the floor, and Wade pulled out a pistol from one of their holsters.
"And Peter quit hiding. I can literally see you and hear you behind the couch." The engineer also joined in, wanting to resolve the situation as quick as possible.
Peter truly changed her life, Toni would never be the same. Before, she would never want want children or be seen as maternal, but now she is fretting over her son every minute of every day. Hell, she even makes her own baby things, not trusting anyone else's creations for her little spider.
The teen was fully suited and had his mask on. His eyes narrowed and he clenched his fists and walked over to the spy. Peter was a very lanky teenager and towered over Clint. Still, he wasn’t the absolute giant and unit Wade was. Peter was just as intimidating as the mercenary.
That's right. Eddie wanted children so badly, and Venom became more and more excited with the idea. They even began talking about baby names, settling on having them named based on how Clintar's do. Venom almost cried on how much Eddie wanted their future kids to have some relation to their home planet.
Fruity and sweet. Just like Peter. He really loved his ice cream and ate it everyday. The scent of his ice cream always lingered, and it became a trademark of Peter. Her hands shook as she looked at the glass bottle. She stilled them and put the substance on her hair.
Just born into the world, and this boy had already lost everything. Toni looked into the Peter’s beautiful doe eyes. He grabbed onto her nose and giggled.
It took a minute or two to reach the top floor. Toni was going as fast as she could, not caring how much pain she was in. Pieces of debris flew all around her, she didn’t care.
"Auntie, have you seen Pete? We want some revenge after last night!" Carnage said, determination blazing in his crimson eyes. He had flaming red hair that matched his eyes, but most of him resembled his mother. He had her nose, smile, hair type, and other hints. On the other hand, he had a strong jaw and slightly pointier teeth from his father's side. In addition to having more pointy teeth, Carnage was able to become a symbiote himself if he wanted to. It was not uncommon to see Carnage have a lengthened limb get a cookie from a high shelf or become a red animal to scare wade and Peter. He may look scary and act it too, yet the boy was such a sweetheart.
“The Avengers have been over for a while. That’s for sure. Lots of lies and betrayals have occurred. Oh well.” Of looks could kill, Team Captain America would be dead by now. Rhodey’s voice was harsh and condescending, wanting to make these next few moments the most uncomfortable and shameful.
"Hm. Well, I'm not surprised a rascal like you knows those words. I curse like a sailor." The engineer laughed, trying to lighten the mood. It worked and Wade began to laugh again, dimples and tooth gap on full display.
“Bruce, please. You know I wouldn’t do this if it wasn’t important. I trust that you’ll do fine without me.”
After the incident at Oscorp, Toni had to give Peter to orphanage. It wasn’t legal to house Peter yet. He wasn’t her actual son. So, they had to keep him their as Toni filled out weeks of paperwork.
Without hesitation, the angered woman broke the man’s legs with a few blasts. He screamed in agony. Good.
Just when a doctor was going to head over, Linda came over and began babbling at him, screaming. Angry and appalled at the situation she had been put in. Toni could see how Linda kept pointing at her, most likely implying how it was Toni's fault for some reason.
“We are pretty lazy. I know I am,” Toni chuckled. It was so nice having Thor back. He was a massive puppy of a man with such a loving heart. The god never failed to make her smile or laugh at his many tales. Not to mention Thor was a beefcake. The engineer shook her head to clear her head of those dumb thoughts. “Ahem. We should probably get some sleep. Tomorrow is going to be quite the field trip.”
Her breath was hitching as she looked at the bloodied scene in front of her. She didn’t even hear Richard’s and May’s instructions for Mary. All she could do was stare at the head.
It was still damaged and chopped up horribly from the fight. The only comparison she could come up with was a bob done by an incredibly drunk, stoned person. Uneven, chunky, gross.
”That’s his home planet, Titan. It’s now an abandoned planet, but Thanos still loved it.” Toni couldn’t suppress a shiver at the sight of Titan. That was where her life fell apart. Literally and metaphorically.
Toni summoned her suit and carried Peter in her arms. He was still screaming and crying. She began to bounce him up and down, rub his back, and hum. Nothing worked. There were moments like these that Peter couldn't be calmed.
She took off her oil stained tank-top, old work boots, and dirt jeans as she ran to her bathroom. Like JARVIS had said, the water was already running. Quickly, she took off her socks, bra, and hair tie. Before she went in, she grabbed her toothbrush and toothpaste. Multitasking.
"I DID IT!!" At three in the morning, Toni slammed her doors open and screamed those words. Her hair was wild and clothes wrinkled. She was covered in oil from all the tinkering she had done. Even though her eyes had dark, dark bags under them, her eyes were wild.
A very heavy and tense silence filled the room. The only sounds were the beeping from the various machines that were hooked up to Wade. Dr. Strange looked at her.
"Formulas? Tones, hon, he's like a month old remember? Those won't be that great for him when you can give him something
It wasn't an uncommon thing to see parents break down and sob. Usually, the parents always had someone with them for comfort. Toni didn't. She was completely alone, only having her son with her.
“But, you can’t go! You can stay here with us! We’ll hang out every day!” Peter tried to keep his voice steady. It wasn’t working.
"No! I need to focus on staying safe! Mom is probably worried sick, even if she's fighting bad guys." Peter reminded himself. Still, the strong desire to touch the spider wasn't ebbing. It was growing stronger. It was like the spider wanted him to touch it. Inviting him. Giving him a sense of calm and resolute. It wouldn't be bad to get a closer look, right? Yeah, it would be fine!
