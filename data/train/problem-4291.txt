“Good morning.” I reassure him that I did, indeed, have a good morning. I sit on the chair next to him in front of Crow. He extends his hand to me.
Castiel laughed a heady laugh as his chest rose and fell rapidly, “you are such a bitch, Winchester.”
“Because you’re Dean Winchester,” Cas whispered, his face inches from Dean’s, “You use people and you let them go.”
Suffice it to say, Cass did not have a plan. Dean had smiled at Castiel the next day, when picking Sam up from the Novak’s. The other guy had looked anywhere but at Dean. Dean had frowned but remained silent as Sam briefly kissed Gabriel goodbye at the door and shuffling into the car.
walk in on you kissing Castiel Novak?” Anna says, her voice wavering and I walk to her, my hand touching her shoulder and she backs away – shying away from my touch. What the fuck?
I look out of the window and stare at the clouds. I take a picture of them. I do not post it. I then realize that I have to smoke. I have smoked before on airplanes. Although, the hostess eyeing me like I am her next meal comes to me and tells me I should go to the bathroom if I need to smoke.
category. And for that, he needed to keep his eyes from straying towards the guy he knew was staring at him right now. He could almost feel Dean’s glare at the back of his head.
“Get out, Benny,” I say and Benny opens his stupid mouth to argue, but something about the glare I send him makes him rethink.
Dean’s heart was practically racing as he tidied himself up and washed his face, before going back inside the diner. He looked around for Castiel, pretending to look around for Sam. He found Sam, but didn’t find Castiel. Leaning next to Sam, Dean asked his brother whether he needed a ride home.
I am aware of my eyebrows shooting up a little. I ignore his hand and look at Crowley. “What happened to Jody?”
Dean smirked, saying “Dare,” even though everyone knew Cas came up with the most twisted ideas. Cas frowned, taken aback slightly. No one chose dare when he was involved. Cas bit his lower lip as he thought of a dare that could unnerve Dean Winchester.
“Cas wait,” I say, but he walkes out with me, dragging me to the stairs of the motel. Okay, enough manhandling for one day. I place a hand on his sternum and shove him into the wall of the corridor.
“She… She’s not that bad, Cas. You probably don't even know for sure,” I shrug and he stares at me for two whole seconds before grabbing my arm with his good hand and steering me to the door.
Choose? Is there a choice? What exactly does he think is going on here? I was never going to choose him. There was never any choice – it’s a damn fling, if even that. That was made clear. No one falls for anyone. And Anna’s not perfect; she’s made some bad decisions just like I have. But we can work. He can’t go around throwing accusations.
“They get boring and then become a drag,” he says and he looks up at me then, and I see it. All of the walls the boy had, the walls I’d worked so hard breaking down, were back up. He didn’t become a drag. He lifts me up. Makes me feel like I can conquer the fucking world.
“Okay, first of all, you’ve seen my browser history. Your true form doesn’t even make my top 10 weirdest things I’ve jerked off to, so that's a load of bull and second of all…”
Cas sputters incoherently and his body changes colours rapidly, eventually settling on a pinkish sort of hue. Oh. That’s new. Dean grins.
Fuck the voice of his father telling him his only purpose in life was to watch out for Sammy and fuck the man John wanted him to be. He helped save this world so he gets to live in it in whatever way he wants to and what he wants is to live his cheesy apple pie life waking up every day next to the man he loves.
“Dean, I- I know you can’t help seeing me this way, but I dislike it when you comment on my appearance.”
“Hey, Cas, buddy. Whatever it is, you can tell me. I know it’s weird coming from me, but let’s not do this again. No more unnecessary secrets. Please.”
Dean’s musings are cut short when Cas’ attentions move downward as Dean’s legs get pushed apart and Cas presses against Dean’s growing erection.
Cas flinches away as if burned, his true form doing much the same. He wavers back against the bedroom wall as far away as possible from his vessel and curls in on himself. At least Dean assumes that’s what Cas is trying to do. Cas' true form, once taller than any skyscraper, has shrunk significantly with the absence of grace powering him up, but is still far too large to fit completely inside a house let alone a room.
Dean’s mind is already too far gone to care for the conversation and he pulls Cas closer by his shirt desperate to embrace the parts of Cas that he can actually touch. Now fully awake, Cas reciprocates the action enthusiastically pressing their lips together earnestly and climbing on top of Dean to explore his body with his hands and mouth. Not for the first time Dean curses his past self for not allowing himself to be loved by Cas years ago. There’s so much time they have yet to make up for. Luckily they’re both more than willing to try.
Meg nodded approvingly, stroking her fingers lightly over the driver’s side mirror. “So? You want me to give her a hand job?”
“I had a rather unusual and lonely childhood, Dean. And teenaged boys’ minds do wander to the strangest topics.” Cas’ hand continued downward, wrapping lightly around Dean’s neck, stroking a lazy finger against his carotid. Dean felt dizzy, as if he had popped a few gummies himself.
“That’s an easy fix. Turn the oven back on. Do you have some milk?” Dean moved around Cas, shifting him with a hand on a hip. He poured a little milk into the casserole, using the rice fluffing fork to whisk the soup and dairy to a more palatable texture.
Cas blinked. “Of course I’m high. It’s Tuesday, isn’t it? Why is your coat still on?” Cas tugged irritably at Dean’s sleeves. Dean shrugged his shoulders and the jacket slipped off into Cas’ waiting hands. Hanging it on a hook, Cas grabbed his hand again and led him over to the couch.
“Dean,” he growled, licking a stripe up the side of his neck. “I’d very much like to strip you naked and slide my cock into your hot, lubed ass. Do you have any concerns or suggestions that would require me to alter my plans?”
“Of course I know. Tell me about your students. Have you forcefully made out with any more of them?”
I honestly have no idea how this happened. While I love EndVerse!Cas, he popped up here of his own volition. The chapter kinda got away from me.
“Touch me, Dean,” he whispered. Immediately his hands were upon Cas’ flesh, sliding down his back, touching everything he could reach from where Cas sat at his hip. Dean’s fingers slipped beneath his lounge pants, and Dean let out a filthy groan.
, his brain helpfully supplied) but there definitely hadn’t been any chains involved. They hadn’t even moved to the bedroom, yet. Not that Dean was
Cas slapped the leg of the coffee table. He could smell himself, feel sweat pooling in his lower back as he lay on the carpet. He was alone. He couldn’t hold a thought still. He started to cry, hyperventilating cheap, sucking breaths in and out.
“The same with the car. If someone else hadn’t detailed it for you, don’t tell me that you wouldn’t have spent most of today at Bobby’s doing it yourself and then you’d end up working, too, because someone would have needed help with an oil change or something.”
Wandering back over to the window, he stared at the car – Dean’s car. Still no movement. If it was Dean, why was he sitting outside? Surely by now Charlie’d given him up and Dean knew that Cas was behind the grocery delivery and the mobile detailing service. Was he here because he was angry? Was he just going to sit in his car all night?
“Not at all. It would be highly inappropriate while I’m tutoring him. In my role as a Teacher’s Assistant, I do formally represent the college. He could sue me for sexual harassment,” Cas mused.
“I like your skin, Dean. I like touching you. If I had my way, I’d chain you to my bed and you’d never wear clothes,” Cas muttered.
“Don’t apologize. Just tell me what went sideways and how you’re going to implement measures to help yourself next time it happens,” Gabriel interrupted.
“Cas?” Dean caught his eye and held it. “You don’t have to give me this if it’s upsetting to you. The t-shirt is plenty, and the Beekeeping thing is kind of a gift for me, too.”
George Bernard Shaw said: “The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place”.
“Thank you. It wasn’t until I spoke with Gabriel the next day that I determined where I had been at fault.” Cas’ voice lowered, slipping from smooth scotch to scotch over rocks.
“Part of being a good tutor is being able to make the lesson relevant to the student’s interests,” Cas said dryly.
With a sigh of frustration, Dean chucked his pencil across the room. The words on the page made no sense, and he’d read them at least a dozen times by now. He pushed back from the table and grabbed a beer from the fridge.
Eyebrows raised, Dean reached over to his jacket hanging on the hall tree, and pulled a mask from it’s pocket before he cracked the door.
“See, I love you too, but you are terrible with words. You’re an action guy. You show Bobby you care by cooking for him. And you show Sam you’re proud by making sure he has time to study instead of work some crappy part-time job,” Charlie spoke faster than usual, like she was afraid that Dean would interrupt her.
“Sure, no problem. Let’s do this.” Dean’s voice lacked judgement, and when Cas glanced into his eyes, expecting to see I-told-you-so humour, he saw nothing but kindness.
Dean stood up, taking a few steps from the couch. “I just mean, this isn’t really you. You’re normally almost shy, man. You blushed the first time I took off my mask. I’ve seen your shelves; you alphabetize your textbooks. You plan everything.”
Concerned blue eyes stared down at Dean. “Do you still want this?” Cas asked, leaning on his forearms above him. “If you’re not prepared, or this is too much, that’s perfectly fine –“
Dean stood back with arms crossed. Watching Meg’s hands slide over Baby made him feel…something. He didn’t like it. “Yeah,” he said gruffly. “327, four barrel.”
Cas dropped his head to Dean’s chest and breathed out. “Just like that, yes. You’re a good boy, Dean. So physical.” Dean moaned deeply, rolling his tongue between the fingers while Cas pulled out and pushed gently back in. His hips circled on top of Dean’s, but there wasn’t enough friction, not enough.
Abashed, Dean handed over the envelope. He leaned against Cas’ leg as he slipped in a thumb and ripped it open.
“Hey, Jerk.” Sam’s face popped up. Books were spread in front of him, he’d obviously been studying just as Dean had.
“Yes, yes, of course.” Cas twisted himself a bit, getting more comfortable as his hand gripped Dean’s t-shirt, sliding over his pectorals.
Cas’ eyes widened but he bit his tongue. Technically, he knew a lot of small businesses still managed their books manually, but there were so many software programs out there, it was hard to understand why this Bobby hadn’t implemented a digital solution sooner.
“I cut the bread incorrectly. So he showed me how, but it still ended up mangled,” Cas said miserably. He didn’t mention how Dean’s hands had felt nice on his, or how Dean’s breath on his neck, his voice in his ear, had run pleasant shivers all the way down Cas’ back.
“Whoa! Okay, hold on, I’m coming!” Dean twisted his arm back to snag his keys as Cas stepped out the passenger door, Dean’s hand still firmly held in his own.
“Thank you for dinner, Dean.” He dug in, taking a second forkful. “Is this the same sauce that you use for your pizza?”
Cas coughed, opening his eyes. He found himself lying flat on the living room carpet, his head tilted awkwardly to one side.
Cas ignored him. “Then again, cuddling isn’t really a bankable asset for tutoring services rendered,” he lectured Dean. “So you’re not professional, either. This whole situation is extremely unorthodox. And” – Cas paused his monologue to point a finger at Dean – “you stink.”
Dean stood back with arms crossed. Watching Meg’s hands slide over Baby made him feel…something. He didn’t like it. “Yeah,” he said gruffly. “327, four barrel.”
Dean leaned back on the couch, taking some comfort from Sam’s words. “I guess. So it’s just me he doesn’t want.”
A few more minutes, and the trees opened up into a small clearing. A rusted out Dodge truck sat on rims, sinking slowly into the forest floor. Dean stopped and turned around, clearly pleased with himself.
“I told him he didn’t need more tutoring. Most mature students don’t, after the first few months. I tried to ask him if perhaps he’d like to get together socially, but I wasn’t able to ask him before he walked out.”
Smacking his sticky lips together in disgust, Cas levered himself up and plugged in his phone before running himself a ridiculously hot shower. He eyed the rug burn on his forehead with dismay as he thoroughly brushed his teeth. The steam helped to clear his head, and a single cup of coffee brought him back to the real world.
“Right. So let’s get this in the oven to warm, and I’ll wash the lettuce before we sit down so it’s dry when we’re ready to make the salad.”
Cas hummed. “That’s all right, Dean. Because as annoying as Gabriel is, sometimes he is correct in his assumptions. And one of his assumptions was that neither one of us is good with words, and yet we’re trying to force the other into communication in that manner.”
Dean’s mind pulled away at the idea that he was so kind and caring. He was just a guy. Nothing special about him. He shifted uncomfortably between Cas’ legs.
Cas speared his fingers upward, searching for Dean’s prostate. “If by that you mean I’m not wearing underwear, yes.”
“Dean, what are you talking about? I think the last thing I sent you was a picture of my midterm grades. Is that what you mean?”
“Of course it isn’t, Cassie. You know I’m one hundred percent in favour of enthusiastic consent. But I also highly doubt that you’ve sexually assaulted and traumatized some poor Accounting student.”
“At this rate, we’re going to spend every night in 2021 watching movies,” Cas said. He picked up the empty bowls and took them back to the kitchen while Dean re-folded his shirts and set them aside. He slipped off the couch to sit next to the gift bag he’d brought. As Cas came back to the couch, Dean handed him a floppy gift.
“Yeah, I make the dough and the sauce myself. It’s easier to make a bunch at once, and then I just vacuum-seal them and freeze them until I need ‘em.” Dean shrugged nonchalantly.
“No, you said that you don’t need tutoring anymore. And that’s awesome, Dean. It means you’re really getting the concepts down without needing help. But that isn’t the same as saying he doesn’t want to see you again.”
“Yeah… yes, that’s fine. It’s quite relaxing. There are –“ Cas swallowed a groan of pleasure behind his mask as Dean’s fingers kneaded his scalp – “there are special sensory neurons at the base of our hair follicles.”
“He’ll probably punch me in the face. I deserve it after treating him like he was actually my boyfriend,” Dean muttered.
I'm so glad that "enthusiastic consent" and "informed consent" are becoming popular terms. I hope that this chapter and the previous one don't make anyone feel overly uncomfortable. I haven't used the dubcon tag, but if you feel it should be there, please let me know.
Dean smiled, a soft thing that lit his eyes more than his full lips. “I’d like to watch the rest of the movie with you, if that’s all right.”
He bent at the waist, moving back slightly so he could suck a bruising kiss onto Dean’s hip. “Touch me, Dean,” Cas murmured, and Dean’s hands instantly smoothed over his shoulders, carding into his hair as he pushed towards Cas’ mouth.
Dean huffed and dragged Cas towards the truck bed. “Some of the guys in my cabin told me about this. And I, uh, I thought maybe…” He shone his flashlight into the bed of the Dodge. Cas could see Dean’s Batman sleeping bag laid out, a thin blanket on top. “I thought we could watch the stars a bit.”
Cas sighed. “My father liquidated all of his assets, everything he could get his hands on, with the exception of a little left for me and my brother, Gabriel. He used that money for the payroll, and then he also disappeared, leaving us with Mother. She and the authorities thought he was in on the embezzlement with Luke and Michael, but I’ve never believed that. Why would he have sold everything he could to pay his employees’ salaries? He could have just fled the country with my uncles.”
“Hello, Dean. Do we have … an appointment today? I didn’t think we did. … But I’ve been wrong before.” Cas wandered away from the door, leaving Dean standing on the porch. His bee slippers made soft swishing noises as he disappeared from sight. “Isn’t today Tuesday? I’m positive that I didn’t have anything scheduled for Tuesday evening.”
Without conscious thought, his hands grip the sheets and hold tightly, grounding him to the bed. He takes a shuddering breath. He can get through this. Just follow the steps. Follow the steps.
Cas lightly stroked the outline of Dean’s earlobe, barely brushing the fine hairs, lightly pinching the lobe between his fingers. Dean swallowed and shifted on the couch.
Dean got up and headed into the kitchen to get a beer. “Yeah. This term and next term.” He raised his voice to ensue Charlie could still hear him. “I gotta get this. Bobby needs help with the books more than anything else.”
Dean shot him a look of betrayal, but humour danced in his eyes. “She’s more than a car, Cas. She’s a lady.”
Dean smiled, faking cheerfulness. “Nope, Caesar’s easy. Just open the dressing and pour on the crouton and bacon bits.”
A soothing jazz instrumental bled into the living room, making the silence between the two men less awkward. Cas drifted slightly, the gentle motion of Dean’s hand on his back lulling him into a stupor. He jerked slightly when Dean’s fingers splayed across his scalp.
“I’m cool with a makeout session, man, but nothing below the waist. I want to make sure the first time we do that, you’re fully aware of what’s going on.” A dark promise turns Dean’s eyes almost black.
Cas blushed again, but smiled back. He really liked seeing Dean’s grin, even if it was at his expense.
“That’s different. I’m your brother. You don’t talk about yourself like that. I told you before, everyone has baggage, Cassie. Dean would be lucky to have you.” Gabriel paused. “You are interested in him in a boyfriend way, aren’t you?”
An hour later, Cas paused the television, his movements a bit sluggish as he sat up. Dean hadn’t stopped his soothing movements, over his back, down his side, even trailing fingers lightly over his wrists. Cas felt drugged by touch, every nerve simultaneously buzzing and completely slack.
Dean cleared his throat and swept his hands down Cas’ sides. “Yeah, I was working at Rocky’s before the pandemic but they aren’t open now. Who woulda thought I’d miss checking freshman IDs, right? Or cleaning up a pukey bathroom?”
Dean raised his eyebrows and laughed. “Straight to it, huh? Gimme just a minute to get my notes ready. How was your week?” He grabbed the chair kitty-corner to Cas’ and sprawled out, flipping through a spiral notebook.
Forty minutes later, Cas took his second beer to the couch and sank down with a groan. “Whose pizza was that, Dean? I’d like to add some to my next grocery order.”
Cas grinned and slowly withdrew his fingers, wiping them on his pants before he kicked them off. He fumbled for the condom and ripped it open as Dean reached for his own cock.
“Safety protocols. You stay over there while I work my magic, got it? It’s hard enough work without breathing through the mask the whole time,” she said.
Dean tugged him down by the shoulders and smiled against his lips. “It might be an apt description, babe, but it’s funny as hell.”
Cas pressed his fingers into Dean’s jaw, urging him to open his mouth wider as his tongue licked inside, soaking up Dean’s flavour, even as he wrapped his other hand around Dean’s neck to hold him still. Dean moaned, hands wrapping around Cas, grasping at his loose t-shirt, sliding inside and crawling up the smooth skin of his back.
“I took advantage of you on Tuesday, Cas, and I’m sorry. You were under the influence, and there’s no way you could consent to what happened. I should never have let things go as far as they did,” Dean said, his gaze flickering around Cas’ face, but refusing to meet his eyes.
“You bet. Sunday morning, okay?” Dean smiled reassuringly. Given the look on Sam’s face, it probably looked more like a grimace. He waved and logged out of Zoom, then went back to assembling the lasagna for his Thursday afternoon tutoring date with Cas. Dammit, not a
Gabriel’s words pulled at him, urging him to move. Moving was hard. Every limb felt weighted in concrete. He dragged his legs under him, rising to his knees. He tipped over slightly, landing with a grunt against the front of the couch, and dropped his head back on a seat cushion, stretching his legs in front. It would have to do.
His little rented house was always pretty tidy, but Cas still ran the vacuum and wiped down the coffee table with Lysol before his cuddle buddy’s arrival. He was drying his hands on a dishtowel when someone knocked firmly on the door.
Cas was silent for a moment, and Dean looked up from the lettuce hearts to see the other man staring at his bee slippers. He took a breath and leaned back against the door frame, stuffing his hands in his sweatpants. “What about work? How’s the shop?”
A brief frown passed over Dean’s face. “I don’t know it, but if you think it’ll work, I’m on board. Do you have it memorized?”
Dean drummed his fingers on the table and thought for a moment. “Okay. I’ll go over there, and I’ll apologize. It’s my fault for taking advantage when he wasn’t able to consent. Maybe he’ll still want to study together, at least. I can find some other way to pay him for his time. What’s the going rate for tutoring, anyway?”
Cas’ cheeks flushed and he looked down at the table. “I suppose if either of us gets Covid, we’re both going to get it anyway, studying this closely together.”
Sorry, not a chapter, just a quick note that if you're interested in the explicit timestamp of Dean and Cas' first time, I've created a series and included the timestamp as the Next Work.
“Dean, that’s a great find,” Cas breathed. “I didn’t know that they offered a program like this. I’ll definitely look into it. Thank you!”
Dean dropped his bag by the door and walked back over to the couch, lifting Cas’ feet so he could settle at the other end of the couch with Cas’ feet in his lap. “No, Cas, the deal was for ninety minutes. I’m a man of my word.”
“You know I love Marvel movies and I’ve never seen Star Wars. You know everything important about me, Dean, and you still accept me. I want to extend a welcome to you at any time. I’d like you here whenever you’d like to spend time here. I have no secrets from you.” Cas stared into his eyes, waiting.
Cas pretended great interest in the remote for a moment as he navigated through the titles. He considered editing his answer, but his sexuality wasn't a secret and he wasn't going to hide it from Dean, if he hadn't guessed already. “Captain America.”
Weaving and rolling like a sailor on dry land, Cas bumped into the wall on the way to the kitchen, but managed to run the water and fill a glass. He drank thirstily and filled it again.
how he’d ended up with Dean glued to his side, but he’d given up on trying to figure it out. He preferred just basking in Dean's glow.
Grumbling, Cas leaned back, taking the heavenly pressure off Dean’s groin and giving him the opportunity to think for just a moment. “We can’t do this tonight, Cas. You’re under the influence again.”
“It’s not time to switch subjects, yet.” Charlie sent an unimpressed glare across Zoom. She was working on her laptop, with her tablet propped open next to her. “
Dean sighed and slumped back in his chair. “Ok, so my Uncle Bobby owns a garage – like a mechanic shop,” he clarified. Cas nodded. “I’ve worked there for years, but Bobby’s talking about retiring. He and Sam convinced me to go back to school to get a business degree, so I could maybe take over the shop and help it grow. I’d like to start doing more restoration work, really build the business up that way. Right now it’s a lot of oil changes and brake jobs. They’re decent money, don’t get me wrong, but there’s bigger money, specialty money, in rebuilding cars into the beautiful machines that they’re meant to be.”
Dean whipped the mask off his face and sighed heavily. “Thank God, because this thing was driving me crazy. It’s bad enough wearing it all day at the shop.”
“Sort of the same thing as you,” Dean replied. His tone was businesslike, hiding his feelings. “My mom died when I was young. My dad wasn’t the same after that. He loaded Sammy and me into Baby and took off. It was my job to take care of Sam. We spent five, six years driving all over the country. I don’t know what Dad was chasing, besides the bottom of a bottle.”
By the time Gabriel got to the six times tables, Cas’ tears had settled to a silent, steady flow down his cheeks. His breath hiccoughed in and out, but the band around his ribs had loosened. He drew in a noisy, heavy, full breath and almost sobbed again in relief.
Cas let it sink in for a moment, breathing gently on Dean’s sensitive nape. “I show my affection and my appreciation for someone through physical touch. I suppose it was really no coincidence that I sought out a cuddle buddy when my spirits were low. I connect with my closest family in a highly tactile manner. I took that away from myself when I wasn’t sure of your feelings. I shut down our cuddling sessions because I could no longer pretend that my interest was strictly platonic.”
They sat in silence for a moment, as Cas turned on the T.V. and navigated to Disney+. “Do you mind if I just put on a Marvel movie? I’ve seen them all but I really like the dialogue.”
“Dean.” Cas pushed against him, tangling his feet with Dean’s as he pulled away. Dean reached out a hand to steady him, but Cas slapped at it, nose wrinkling. “You’re not supposed to be here this evening. Though I suppose now that you’ve seen me like this, you might not want to return, anyway. It’s certainly not very professional to see your tutor in this condition.” Turning to the counter, Cas zipped up the gummy bear bag and shoved it into a drawer and out of sight.
“Thank you, Dean. Thank you so much.” Cas kissed him again, stroking his tongue across his lower lip.
Lying on the floor, Cas cried in ugly, gasping sobs and listened to his brother’s calm, quiet voice reciting multiplication tables.
Cas smiled reassuringly, hoping it showed through in his eyes. “There’s no wrong way to learn, Dean. It’s just a matter of finding what works for you. Now why don’t you tell me what you’re having trouble with, and I’ll see if I can help.”
“Ok, my friend Cas. He’s in his last year of Accounting and Financial Management. He tutors people already, like he’s patient and good with numbers, right? But, and this is kinda personal and he might get mad at me for telling you, he suffers from Anxiety. And the other day when I was talking to him, he was going on and on about touch therapy and oxytocin and stress relief. So maybe you could trade cuddling for some tutoring.” The words rushed out of Charlie. When she finished, she sat back and stared at Dean as if she’s just confessed to a crime.
Dean propped his chin in his hand and drummed his fingers on the table. “I don’t know. The pandemic, social bubbles, this might not be a good idea.”
“There we go. Relax. I figure an hour for an hour, okay? Fair’s fair,” Dean’s voice brooked no argument.
Pulling back, Cas eyed the man lying below him. Dean’s eyes were almost black when they met his, colour high on his cheeks and lips slick with spit. Bruises marked a trail down his chest where Cas’ mouth had been, and his nipples were drawn tight.
Whatever he was about to say was lost as Dean leaned forward, pressing their lips together in a soft, chaste kiss. Cas stilled, his heart thumping madly.
“Are you cold?” Cas’ breath feathered across his ear. “I notice you’re not wearing your usual layers of clothing this evening. I could fetch a blanket.”
“Whatever. Not really relevant to the point, is it? So what did you do last night? Over-cuddle him?”
Vividly aware of Dean pressed against his side from hip to shoulder, Cas lay still, watching lightning bugs dance through the trees, unsure what to say. Everything with Dean seemed so complicated, but being with him also seemed like the easiest thing in the world. Cas couldn’t figure it out. No one had ever made him feel this awkward and appreciated at the same time.
They settled in to watch the movie, taking up very little couch for two men who were as big as they both were. Cas sat a bit stiffly, unsure what to do with his hands. Or his arms. Why did he have
This time it was Charlie who leaned back and glared. “You could barter car maintenance. Or cooking. Or basic contractor skills. Or babysitting, you’re great with kids.” She ticked them off on her fingers as she went. “Or –“
“Oh, shit, wait just a second.” A little more maneuvering, and Dean shed his flannel, leaving him in his Camel Towing t-shirt. Then he pulled Cas back into position and returned his attention to the movie, satisfied.
“It’s okay. I guess you really needed some human touch. I don’t mind, but I think my ass is numb and I have to pee.”
Sighing, Dean wiped his hands on a towel and looked over the lasagna. If he hadn’t been talking to Sam, he might’ve realized that he could have made two smaller lasagnas and frozen one for himself. Too late now. He’d just serve himself an extra-big portion, and if he had to sit on Cas’ couch for a nice long time to digest, well, so be it. The hours they spent together on Thursday were the highlight of his week. If his culinary skills could impress the math genius, then Dean was willing to play the only card he had to keep Cas interested in him.
In response, Cas reached up and hooked his palm around Dean’s nape, pulling his face back down. The angle was better, now. He rested his right hand on the small of Dean’s back. The other teen groaned, just a little, and wet his lips before diving back down to meet Cas’s willing mouth.
Taking a breath, Dean briefly explained the events of Tuesday night, leaving out his own reaction to Cas’ tactile attack, ending with the makeout session that has been playing on repeat in his brain for the past day and a half.
The woman rolled her eyes above her mask. “I’m Meg.” She flicked out her hand and offered Dean a card.
“Yeah? What do you do in the evenings?” Dean’s hand was deep in his backpack, and he emerged triumphantly with two pencils.
“Right. Steering wheel exchange. Happens all the time. Go on.” Dean hid his smile behind his soda straw.
“Yes,” Cas replied shortly, fussily folding the sleeping bag and scooting off the end of the tailgate.
“I’m really proud to be your friend. It’s possible that your behaviour was questionable. I’m not saying it was or it wasn’t. That’s up to Cas. But it takes a self-aware and conscientious person to admit that, and be willing to apologize for it.”
“Your true form is incredibly attractive. Very sexy. Wings and all. If I could hit that, I would. Inner beauty not required.” He speaks slowly as if to a child. Apparently it was the wrong thing to do as Cas slaps Dean’s hands away unable to suppress his irritation any longer.
“Dean, childishly staring at an empty wall won’t solve this.” Cas argues from behind Dean and Dean has to suppress the urge to turn around. The voice might be coming from the vessel, but the one talking is the angel in front of him.
“Make me.” The reply is a bit cliche but Dean isn’t trying to win an Oscar. He’d much rather film a porn instead.
Careful not to wake him, Dean traces the outlines of Cas’s body illuminated by the reddish hues of the morning sun with his fingers. He can hardly believe it’s only been a year since they defeated God and pulled Cas out of the Empty with the promise of a love returned.
Dean swallows hard. Having all of Cas’ eyes so solely focussed on him and him alone is such a major turn on. He must be doing it on purpose. It’s unfair how such a simple action has so much of an effect on Dean.
So much has changed in such little time. With the illusion of free will no longer binding Dean to a greater destiny and with Cas and Dean’s own feelings out in the open he finally allowed himself to want all the things he denied himself for so long, always prioritizing other people’s happiness over his own. Now he has it all. A house, a job, a family, a life, Cas. It was so hard at first, to stop looking for hunts and letting go of Sam so he too could start his own life with Eileen by his side, but in the end Dean had been too tired to fight his own desires any longer and gave in.
“I’m not.” Dean replies, leaving no room for debate and moves closer to Cas, who seems to be trying to escape through the bedroom wall. “So believe me when I say that you’re fucking beautiful and only thinking about you watching me with your many many eyes is enough to make me hard.”
“Oh no Jon Snow. Not so fast. Let me put this in terms even you and your insecure ass will understand.”
Cas stirs in his sleep and Dean watches the translucent wings flutter against the light seemingly drinking up the morning sun. They used to be pitch black back when they first met. A beautiful sight, yet not quite fitting the man Cas would eventually become.
Dean rifles through his memories desperate to find the right one, but draws a blank and visibly blanches.
Then they burned and Dean could barely stomach to look at them knowing how much the culmination of all of Dean’s mistakes had hurt Cas so irreparably. And now the wings are whole again and even more awe-inspiring than before. Something about Dean rescuing Cas from the Empty or maybe a blessing from Jack has restored them leaving Dean with the desperate urge to touch the intangible. Watching one of the smaller eyes on Cas’ wings slowly flutter open Dean wonders if it would be rude to ask about the colour change and chuckles. The way the wings shimmer with all the colours of the rainbow is just so wonderfully, blatantly gay.
Dean grows quiet. What does Cas mean with Dean’s never seen his true form before? Wasn’t the ability to see angels part of being the Michael Sword or something? How could Cas not know? And even if he didn’t, they’ve known each other for over ten years. It must’ve come up at some point.
In their closeness Cas’ celestial body engulfs Dean in his entirety and he is left again, breathless, by the unfathomable sight of his lover’s true form. Stars and skies in colours not named by men expand and swirl inside the translutient depths of the oceans and galaxies that make up the angels body as the golden halos’ luminescence submerges them both in it’s light. Dean would lose himself in the sight if it weren’t for the thousands of eyes, holding the knowledge of millenia, watching him unblinkingly in a way that is so Cas, so human, that Dean can’t see anything else but his stupid socially awkward self-sacrificing husband.
There’s a storm brewing inside Cas, a tension. One wrong move and a star could explode setting off a supernova that is held at bay by nothing but a shimmering skin made of light and colours. His husband is nervous at the possibility of being seen, Dean realises and has no choice but to confirm Cas’ worry.
. That meant having to see Castiel every day. And after their little interlude in the bathroom, it was somewhat awkward for Dean. Especially when his jeans felt a little tighter whenever his eyes met Castiel’s.
Dean laughed, standing up – his knees cracking and his uncomfortably hard cock rubbing against his jeans. Cas stared at him, his lips swollen and eyes wide.
Cas frowned, throw off his game for just a second. “Fine,” He said – regaining his composure. He took a swig from the beer bottle in his hand before getting up and walking across the table to Dean.
Cas looked around to see everyone staring at them. Gabriel’s eyebrows were raised as he looked impressed while Sam just looked dumbfounded. Everyone else just… looked.
She storms out of the apartment and I keep staring at the ceiling. What did she expect? I’ll take her on my tour. We’d gallivant around Europe and I would kiss her under the Eifel fucking Tower? Fuck me.
Dean took his bottom lip in his mouth as his fingers tapped against the screen aimlessly, waiting for a response. He hoped his friend wasn’t asleep. Charlie was a late sleeper – binge watching TV shows or reading comics or on her computer nearly all night. His phone buzzed half a minute later.
“Cas!” Dean called, hurrying after him. Castiel didn’t stop and kept walking on, hastening his pace if anything. Dean went after him, catching up to Cas just as he entered his room. Dean bent forward and grabbed Castiel’s arm before swinging him to face towards him.
I don’t know. Moral support? A shoulder to cry on? Someone to kiss? Preferably the latter. I’m not picky. Not when it comes to him.
“What Dean?” He whispered against Dean’s skin. “Do you want me to stop?” His hands moved over Dean’s thigh before cupping all of him, testicles and cock as Dean’s head moved backward and hit the tiles behind him.
The insinuation in her voice is very clear. Should I wait a day before I start fucking around? Meg and I share a complicated relationship. We pose for the tabloids. She doesn’t ask me what I do. I don’t ask her what she does. Unless she thinks I am taking her to Europe. Then she throws a fit, that woman.
Cas smiled and raised his eyebrows at Dean – who proceeded to choke on air before looking down at his own lap. His jeans suddenly felt too tight. His throat too constricted. He could feel Castiel’s gaze like a weight on the side of his face.
I walk into Crowley’s office without knocking. See a person talking to Crow with his back to me and instantly step back. My manager looks up at me and his eyes light up. Fuck me.
He hollowed his cheeks as he moved lower, taking more of Castiel’s length. Cas threw his head back, trying not to moan too loudly as Dean lifted up, then down – bobbing his head over Castiel’s length. Cas groaned, tightening his hands in Dean’s hair as he used all his resolve not to buck his hips forward and end up mouth fucking him.
He began at the small amount of skin peeking through the rip in Castiel’s jeans at the knee. His eyes moved from Castiel’s belt to his t-shirt that was emphasizing the slightly buff, slightly gangly frame. His vision finally moved from his shirt collar, to his adam’s apple, to his jaw. Dean let his eyes linger over Castiel’s lip before moving to his eyes – which were turned in his direction. Dean’s color drained as he registered with horror that he was watching Dean eye-fuck him like it was his job.
“Holy shit, Dean. Everyone knows you’re straight plus you have your reputation. What are you going to do?”
“You think you can tell me what to do? You really can’t. You’re honestly going to choose her over me?”
He let Dean push him back as Castiel undid Dean’s shirt – having discarded his own to the floor. Reaching the bed, Castiel pushed Dean back before climbing onto him.
me. Fuck fixing me. Leave me broken. People pay to listen to what I have to say when I am broken. I’ve strung up all the things that have broken me into a necklace of songs and people pay to watch me choke on them.
I groan and turn over, lying on my stomach. My head buried in my pillow. I hope she leaves. I hope it is for real this time. Because she always seems to come back. Sticks to me like a goddamn leech. Probably because the LV bags and the limo rides don’t come when you’re dating a normal bloke.
Sam looks up from his homework when I enter. His expression is annoyed and I can tell what the reason is before he says anything. He nods towards my room.
He pulls me in, his head rests against the crook of my neck, making the difference in our heights more apparent. I hold him, breathe him in. I count to three and I let him go. He steers around me without another word, opens the door of the auditorium and walks out.
Giving up, he swung his legs over the side of the bed and pulled on his knitted bee slippers. The little floppy wings were a bit annoying, but his neighbour, Mrs. Moseley, had knitted them for him, and he grudgingly admitted that they made him feel good. These days, Cas was all in favour of the little things that made him feel good and quieted his Anxiety.
Another minute passed in silence. Dean shifted his weight slightly. “Um, Cas? Is this working the way you want?”
“Oh, okay, so I’ll just…” Dean gestured at the present in his lap, as if his one hand wasn’t already carefully prying the tape up.
Gathering his wits, Dean wondered if this was the weirdest conversation he’d held with Cas today, and wasn’t entirely sure. There had been that thing about Labradors smelling each other.
“We made a deal, Cas. I play nice with the theatre kids and you play nice with the dance kids. You’re way more comfortable in your body now than you were at the start of the summer,” Dean added generously.
An unfortunate (or fortuitous?) situation lands Dean on Cas' doorstep on a regular Tuesday night. But the owner of the little yellow bungalow isn't quite himself...
Dean warred with himself. He’d been planning to wash Baby this weekend himself. She was a little dusty…
Dean laughed. “Yeah, it’s the studying that’s bringing us close together.” He winked. “But seriously, I don’t mind going outside, just let me know what works for you.”
Brow furrowed, Cas tried to parse his meaning. They were sitting next to each other, and Dean had his arm around Cas’ shoulder. Sure, he wasn’t almost sitting in Dean’s lap like last time, but…
Cas wandered back into the living room and put Dean’s mug down on the coffee table. It had an adorable little storm cloud on it, obviously a matching set for the sunshine mug that held his own tea. Dean sat back, spread his legs, and opened his arms.
Dean cupped his neck and brought their foreheads together. “I think we’ve established I’m not really good with words, you know?” He paused and took a breath. “But you said … you said we had a ‘profound bond’.” This time he makes the dorky air quotes and Cas’ lips quirk upwards.
Dean pulled back, leaned up on one elbow over Cas. “Is this okay?” He asked, his green gaze wide as he stared down into Cas’s face.
Dean snorted a laugh. “Right. Blah blah.” He squeezed Cas’s thigh and sighed lightly. His other hand slipped almost lazily through Cas’s pandemically-long hair.
Cas released a breath he didn’t realize he’d been holding. Dean’s easy acceptance of his suggestion brought a warm glow to his heart. He tucked the thought in a box and shoved it to the back of his mind.
Cas stilled, buttered bread half-wrapped in foil. “And I just added to your workload. Now you’re not only making meals for Bobby, but you have to feed me, too.”
Dean stared at the box. It was perfectly wrapped in shiny silver paper, secured with a brilliant red ribbon. “I can wait –“
Meg lifted a shoulder. “No skin off my nose. It was Clarence.” She went back to sorting her buckets and soaps.
The room was silent and still, as if Cas’ words were a special language meant only for Dean’s ears. Dean lay quiet, unable to draw enough breath into his lungs, and simultaneously unable to move to do anything about it, lest he break the spell.
Surprised, Dean sat. He’d expected Cas to mention the groceries or the detailing, not his abrupt departure in October. Huffing impatiently, Cas shoved him around until he was sitting sideways on the middle cushion. Then Cas squeezed in behind him and dragged Dean’s back to his chest. Next he hooked a calf over Dean’s thigh, effectively planting him in the couch.
Feeling light and unencumbered, Cas unfolded himself from the couch and happened to walk ‘round the far side on his way to the kitchen. Looking out the front window, he stopped short.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” he said softly. There was no way he’d be able to sit and watch a movie with Cas the same way he did with Sam or Charlie. And Cas had made it pointedly clear last time that anything more than a platonic relationship was off the table. There was a moment of silence as Cas’ hands stilled.
Cas crossed his arms and pouted on the far side of the couch where he’d landed. Dean sighed and pulled his arms out of the plaid, balling it up and throwing it over by the door. “There, happy?” He made grabby hands at Cas until he caved in and settled next to Dean again. “Who knew you were so dramatic,” Dean said, kissing his cheek.
Dean waited patiently, sipping his beer. Mechanics, he could do. Even cooking, he was pretty good at that. And yes, his rent was pro-rated because he provided basic maintenance for some of the apartments in his building.
“Dean,” Cas said quietly. “In my professional opinion as a TA, you don’t need my help anymore. You fully grasp the concepts in the book now with very little assistance. This is usually the case; mature students may need support through the first few weeks of a class, but once the terms become commonplace and studying becomes second nature, tutoring isn’t normally required. I would be happy to schedule a few sessions with you prior to your final exams in December, but I don’t see a need for you to return here each week for tutoring.”
A shadow fell across Cas’ face, but it disappeared quickly. “No. This just a fortuitous circumstance,” he replied, squirting lube onto his fingers.
Dean shrugged. He hadn’t realized he’d subconsciously planned to impress Cas with one of his best meals tonight, until the effort had clearly fallen flat, and left him feeling disappointed and self-conscious. Cas didn’t want his crappy cheap dessert, and he wanted Dean’s leftover lasagna out of his house, too.
“Where did you learn to cook?” Cas asked, while reaching for a knife from the block to cut the bread. Dean stepped quickly to his side, switching out a carving knife for a serrated knife and handing him that instead. Cas wiped the wet knife handle on the hem of his shirt.
“Right. Of course.” Cas kept his gaze firmly on his bee slippers and not on Dean’s rear end, as he moved past him. He slipped his own mask off and quickly washed it with hot water and dish soap before hanging it on one of the cupboard handles to drip dry.
Dean insisted on paying for the burgers, but acquiesced when Cas asked if they could eat at the park. The weather was unseasonably warm for October, and it was nice to be outdoors. Others had clearly had the same plans to enjoy the sunny late afternoon, but they were able to find a picnic table that still allowed them to maintain their social distancing. Cas offered his pocket-sized hand sanitizer to Dean before they opened their brown sacks. There was little conversation while Dean inhaled his burger, but he wiped his fingers and paused before decimating his fries.
For a moment Charlie looked confused, caught up in listing Dean’s positive traits. “Which skill? Oh, right. Oh, uh…”
“I was right, I don’t an appointment booked with you tonight, Dean.” Cas reappeared in the living room, staring at the wall calendar in his hands. He sighed gustily. “That’s good, it’s upsetting when I miss something on the schedule. It means I’m not planning correctly.”
“Could we lose this, maybe?” He pulled the hat off Cas’ head and ran his fingers through his messy hair. Cas groaned, nipping Dean’s bottom lip, then soothing it with his tongue. He pulled back, wet lips trailing across Dean’s cheek, catching his ear lobe in his mouth and tugging lightly. Dean leaned his head to the side, granting access to his neck. He wrapped a calloused palm around Cas’ nape to keep him in place. Cas chuckled darkly and twisted to pull his legs out from under him so he could straddle Dean’s lap. His teeth grazed Dean’s neck as he nosed aside the collar of his plaid.
Dean’s eyebrows rose. “Yeah, that’s a good idea. I know I’ve been out of school for a few years, but I feel like a whole generation has passed me by.” He shook his head. “Sometimes I feel forty instead of twenty-six.”
Cas lifted an eyebrow. “I know you love cars, but you didn’t drag me all the way out here to show me some old truck, did you?”
Cas tackled him to the floor, thrusting his tongue into his mouth. He delved deep, like he couldn’t get enough of Dean’s taste. His hands roamed Dean’s body, sliding up his shirt and scratching his nails down his sides. Overwhelmed, Dean couldn’t do much except hold on to Cas’ shoulders until he backed up for air.
“This ok?” Dean rumbled. He’d dropped his own head to rest against Cas’ crown, but his fingers stilled, awaiting Cas’ response.
Well, what did you think? Too much monologuing on Cas' part? You know how he gets when he's high! Too much description? Not enough? Did the emotion and a lil' bit of sizzle come through?
Quiet moans slipped from Dean’s throat as he surrendered to Cas; his mouth opening willingly, his tongue curling lightly around the intruder and sucking him in deeper.
Meg followed him through the shop, her work boots clunking steadily behind him. He pushed open the back door and led the way over to Baby.
Shoving his feet into his shoes, he pushed his way out of the house and strode over to the car. Wrenching open the passenger door, he flopped heavily into the leather seat and slammed the door shut against the cold. Turning to face Dean, he quirked an eyebrow.
“What? No! I mean, well, yes, but because you’re helping me.” Dean finished washing the lettuce and looked at Cas. His head was lowered, eyes on the bread in his hands.
“Why didn’t the textbook just say that?” Dean shoved their garbage into the paper bag and tossed it overhand at a garbage can. He fist-bumped himself and made crowd sounds when it went in, turning back to Cas with a grin.
“I should have known I couldn’t keep it platonic. He’s probably going to want to cancel our sessions, now,” he groaned.
, and you said when you left, he was perfectly fine. I think you should go over there and apologize, and see what his response is.”
His heart skipped beats, as though it was throwing itself over the edge of a rollercoaster track, falling to the ground.
I struggled a bit with the concept of consent under the influence. In my ...ahem...experience, I felt that Cas was in control of his faculties enough to consent to a makeout session with Dean. Dean did stop the situation, and checked in with Cas before things went too far.
through the back of the page. “I thought you’d like it. I know it’s not until April, but I didn’t think you’d mind waiting. I already booked the weekend off from Bobby’s.”
It was a few moments before Cas could move, before he could withdraw and remove the condom. He flopped onto his stomach next to Dean, his hand cupping his freckled face. Dean opened his eyes and smiled slowly.
“That evening, I had taken Gabriel’s advice, and I was working diligently to try to get to know you by asking you questions. I’m sure you’ve noticed that I’m not an effective communicator. I guess my ‘people skills’ are ‘rusty.’” Dean snorted a laugh as he felt Cas’ fingers, trapped in his own, make air quotes.
“You enjoy digital nipple stimulation,” Cas observed, his voice deep as Moria. “Do you also like oral nipple play?” He didn’t wait for an answer, redirecting his lips to one stiff peak, taking it in his mouth. Dean bucked upwards, mouth wet and open in a soundless cry.
Cas stared from the truck bed to Dean and back, heartbeat clanging like New Orleans jazz. Dean had done this for
Dean threw back his head and laughed. “Cas, this isn’t the end of the world. It’s the final performance at a theatre camp for teens. You say some stuff, I’ll move around onstage, people will clap and talk about how avant-garde it is to mix classical literature with modern dance. And if they hate it, who cares.”
Dean rolled his eyes and dropped his arms, allowing Cas to escape. He reached for the jar of flour that now sat on Cas’ counter. “C’mere and I’ll teach you how to make a roux.”
“Hello, Dean. Merry Christmas Eve.” Cas leaned in to snag a chaste kiss as Dean handed him the bags so he could take off his coat. Underneath, he wore a festive green and red plaid and a vintage black t-shirt that said “Nakatomi Plaza Christmas Party 1988”.
“Could I try something?” Dean pushed him away a moment. He slid his right leg behind Cas’ back and angled himself more into the corner of the couch before pulling on Cas’ arm to bring him closer. “On your stomach or on your back?”
“You were trying to show me that you cared, in your own way. And I didn’t know how to listen,” Cas whispered against his cheek as his lips traveled to the bolt of Dean’s jaw.
Cas lay on his bed, fingers strumming on his flat stomach. He’d been for a run, he’d done his own studying, had already taught two Zoom tutoring sessions. He sighed, irritated that his plan wasn’t working out. Picking his phone up off the bedside table, he clenched his jaw. Dean would be here in half an hour, and he hadn’t managed to get in a nap to ensure he didn’t fall asleep during the cuddling session.
Dean turned back to the lettuce. “Well, when we were on the road with Dad, he usually passed out before he fed us. So it was either learn to cook, or eat a lot of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. I swear I can make mac and cheese a hundred different ways, depending on what the local variety store had. Sam’s favourite was made with marshmallow fluff.”
“Dean.” Bobby poked at the monitor in front of him. He’d pulled up Meg’s website, showing her five-star rating with the local business bureau. Clicking over to the Testimonials page, Dean and Bobby quickly scanned through dozens of satisfied reviews, including some mutual customer names that they both recognized.
and left the TV on for background noise as he puttered in the kitchen. It was Tuesday, so his first stop was the baggie of edibles tucked into the silverware drawer.
“Good boy,” Cas murmured, quick hands making light work of stripping Dean’s shirt and throwing it behind him. He kissed his way down Dean’s chest, sucking light bruises along his sternum. Dean didn’t know where to put his hands, lost in the feeling of Cas’ wet lips trailing over his skin. He finally rested them on Cas’ shoulders and held on.
“I’ve heard of that. My brother Sammy plays with Charlie sometimes, too. Oh, so I take my notes long-hand. I hope that’s ok. I know all the kids these days take notes on their laptops, but I guess I’m old school.” Dean shrugged apologetically and waggled the pencils in the air.
Cas flushed and stared at the floor, trying to salvage the situation. He’d been expecting this turn of events, but it was still a blow.  Obviously Dean didn’t want Cas to touch him. Perhaps Dean was feeling a little violated and was too polite to say so.
was like watching an angel literally lose his wings and fall to earth. The modern dance performance was breathtaking and terrible and fit the text perfectly. Dean might not consider himself a fan of the classics, Cas thought, but he had no problem interpreting them through movement.
A frown flitted across Dean’s face, but he quickly smoothed it out. Everything always came back to their arrangement. At least they still had an arrangement, after he’d screwed up with the whole kissing thing.
“Um, sure, buddy. Whatever floats your boat. Here on the couch, I guess?” He swung his arms back and forth, like he was stretching for a workout. Cas emphatically did not eye the strip of taut abdomen revealed as Dean’s t-shirt rode up.
“Fine. Triple overtime it is. I’ll be out as soon as I can.” Dean picked up his backpack on his way down the hall.
“Let the knife do the work.” Once he was certain Cas had it, he stepped back, reluctantly releasing his hands.
He didn’t know how long he stood there, hands braced against his knees, fighting his own body. Acrid cold sweat ran from his armpits down his biceps. Surging upright, he weaved and stumbled, looking for his phone. It fell out of his shaking hands, dropping to the floor before he could catch it.
Cas followed him over to the door. “That’s your car, right?” He grabbed a mask off the shelf and toed on his shoes.
“The bathroom now, Cas. Put the phone down on the counter and take a whiz. Don’t hang up. Come on, one foot in front of the other.”
Shrugging his shoulders, Dean ignored the squirming in his gut and rearranged himself on the couch, taking his grumpy mug with him. It took a few moments and a few misplaced elbows, but Cas finally arranged him how he wanted him. Dean found himself snugged up under Cas’ chin. Cas’ arms came across his chest landed on his own arms, laying against his stomach. For good measure, Cas wrapped one leg up and around Dean’s, pressing him into the couch. It was a bit like being hugged by a particularly warm and firm octopus, with all his limbs trapped. Cas hummed contentedly, the vibrations echoing through his chest. Dean stifled a shiver.
Dean sat up a little, leaning on his elbow to see Cas’ face. His brow was furrowed, his mouth tight with tension.
They met back on the couch a few minutes later and Cas pressed play. He allowed Dean to slot them back together in a way that was comfortable for him, and sighed in appreciation as Dean slid long fingers through his hair. His own hand found it’s way under the edge of Dean’s sleeve to grasp his bare bicep, enjoying the feel of bare skin under his hand. His eyes drifted closed as he felt himself swept up in an oxytocin-induced haze, murmuring his appreciation. Dean huffed a gentle laugh, wrapping his other arm more tightly around Cas as the Avengers saved the world.
“What do you want me to do, Dean?” Sam asked, exasperated. “I know you. Instead of being grateful, you’re just mad. If you’re that pissed about it, load them all back up and take them to a shelter. Or put on your big-boy pants, eat the damn groceries, and figure out who on this planet might want to do something nice for you.”
Dean’s tongue slipped tentatively over the seam of Cas’s lips, and it was Cas’s turn to groan. Dean licked his way into Cas’s mouth, hot and wet and deep. Cas thrust his fingers into Dean’s hair and tugged him closer still.
Cas’ feet froze to the floor, staring at Dean’s face. At the slight stubble on his cheeks, the little dent in the right side of his nose that kept it from being completely straight. And those full, pink lips.
Dean took his time in the washroom, carefully folding his dirty clothes and tucking them into a stray plastic bag he found in the bottom of his backpack. At least his bag wouldn’t smell like wet dog and mushrooms at school the next day. Stepping into the shower, a fine shiver traveled head to toe as Cas’ scent steamed around him.
Guys, this one might be a little messy. Still no beta, but I also rushed through it because I wanted to get it posted for you this weekend (it's a long weekend in Canada; it still counts!). I'll have you know I'm fighting through a truly wicked sunburn tonight for you! ;-)
“But then, Dean, you cooked for me.” Cas’ hands resumed wandering Dean’s torso, stroking a wrist here, palming a bicep there. “The fifth love language, Dean. The fifth love language is Acts of Service.”
Dean choked, turning it into a cough as Meg smirked. “You’ll do it right here? She’s not going anywhere with you, sorry.”
“It’s fine. No need to apologize for being you. As long as you’re fine. Do you need another hug?” Dean opened his arms and wiggled his eyebrows encouragingly.
Meg shrugged. “It’s your call, Dean. I’ve already been paid, and I’ve been tipped. If you don’t want her washed, waxed, and cleaned to within an inch of her life, that’s up to you. I get to go home early.” Meg turned to leave.
Cas watched Dean walk to the sleek black car parked on the road. He stood on the porch and stared as Dean opened the back door and set the leftovers in the footwell and shut the door almost too gently. His eyes never left Dean’s face as the other man got into the driver’s side and pulled the door shut behind him. He watched Dean’s wrist flick, and as the car roared at her master’s touch. He stared as Dean pulled the gearshift downwards, and drove out of Cas’ life without a single look back at the little yellow house with the black lacquered door, it’s lonely owner silhouetted by the single porch light.
“I have another one for you.” Dean hesitated slightly, pulling a colourful envelope out of the bag and looked down at the floor. “I didn’t know, but I thought…And Sam thought it would be a good idea. I mean, if you don’t like it, that’s ok. I can just –“
Cas dragged his teeth over the hard point, pressing his weight down on Dean’s hips to keep him flat on the bed. One hand crawled back up Dean’s chest, and two fingers pressed against Dean’s lips. He opened immediately, sucking Cas’ clever fingers into his mouth and sucking lightly.
Finally getting with the program, Cas stepped forward. “No, wait, sorry. This is really sweet, Dean. I’d love to watch the stars with you.” He grabbed the sleeping bag, shaking it back out into the truck.
Cas leaned an elbow on the table, watching, fascinated, as Dean came to life, talking about cars. If he’d thought the man was animated before, it had nothing on his body language as he talked passionately about his work. He nodded encouragingly.
“Well, he left me with enough for a generous downpayment on a house and my education is paid for. Gabriel took his share and invested it. To be honest, I’m not entirely sure how he’s employed but it’s probably safer that way.”
“Mmhmm,” Cas ducked his head, breath playing over Dean’s cheek. “I suppose it’s a form of Partialism. That’s sexual arousal to a body part. Hair, in this case.”
“Hey, where’d you – oh, there you are.” Dean walked into the kitchen, nodding in satisfaction at seeing the beer disappear into the fridge. He’d brought his backpack with him, and unzipping it, he pulled two vacuum-sealed pizzas out of the pouch and set them in the fridge, too.
to say what I think without being concerned that my words will offend someone, or that I may say the wrong thing. It’s incredibly liberating to be free of those social constraints.” Cas stepped closer, his lips almost brushing Dean’s. Dean couldn’t move, gaze locked on Cas’.
“What?” Cas frowned at the phone in his hand. He poked it with a finger, causing the screen to flare to life. The current call had lasted 23:12…13….14….15…16….
“Right. My apologies,” Cas said stiffly. “Here you are. I don’t think it will spill on your way home. I think the salad isn’t worth saving, but take the other half of the baguette with you, too.”
“Right. Thanks, then. I guess I’ll see you around campus. Or, huh, I guess not.” Dean flicked the masks hanging by Cas’ front door and grimaced.
Cas tried to croak out a “thank you” but his lips wouldn’t cooperate and it came out as a wispy “thhhh.” He pressed at the phone until the screen went dark, and sleep pulled him under.
Cas leaned his head back on Dean’s shoulder as he unpacked the groceries. “What are we making tonight?”
“Ok, so I’m on the chapter about Cash Basis versus Accrual Basis. And I think Bobby uses Cash for the garage. Is that going to be a problem if I want to take in restoration work? I haven’t finished the chapter yet but the revenue recognition principle examples in the book aren’t very good.”
“What?” Startled, Dean fumbled his beer and performed a few hand gymnastics to set it upright before it spilled all over his books.
“Yes, you are,” Cas said firmly. “You’re not leaving that here. Our deal was one meal, not a meal plus leftovers.”
“For example, one method is Words of Affirmation. People who respond to this method enjoy hearing their partner say phrases like, ‘Dean, I think you’re one of the kindest and most caring people I’ve ever met’.” Cas breathed the words into his ear, lips tracing lightly over the lobe.
Dean was barely inside before Cas slammed the door shut and pressed against him, knocking Dean back into the frame. Strong arms wrapped around his middle, and Cas’ head plunked down heavily on his shoulder, his nose pressed against his neck. Then he went boneless and sighed. Thrown a little, Dean braced his legs and wrapped his own arms around Cas’ back to hold him up.
Fifteen minutes away, Dean sat in front of his TV, fully aware that it was off, but no longer caring. A bottle of Ash’s moonshine sat on the table next to him, a single shot glass tipped on it’s side next to the bottle.
Without taking his eyes off Meg, Dean shook his head. “I doubt it. Probably the same person who bought the groceries.”
Cas sat up, pulling the sheets with him as he leaned against the headboard. Sunrise was still at least an hour away, so he flicked on the small lamp on the nightstand and blinked against the sudden brightness against the soft yellow walls. The snakes were back, slithering heavily in his gut. He had to explain about his arrangement with Dean. Not that he was ashamed of it, but it was unconventional.
Charlie’s voice was level and sombre when she broke the silence. “Dean. Are you telling me that you had sex with Cas and you aren’t sure if he consented?”
“Human touch, you said. Oxy-something? This is the best way for you to get as much touch as possible unless you wanna get horizontal.”
Cas physically pulled back, sitting upright and resting his hands on Dean’s arms. Dean scooched closer, craving the closeness that had slowly built between them. He clasped Cas’ calves tighter, not wanting to leave the security of his tight hold.
Cas stopped cutting the bread into ridiculously equal-sized slices and looked at Dean. “You said you were ten when your dad dropped you at Bobby’s. So you were under ten and responsible for making meals for you and your little brother?”
Dean paused in his layering and stared hard at his brother. “No. We’ve talked about this, Sam. You need the best marks to get into law school. And you need your extracurriculars on your application, too. It’s more important that you maintain your grades than a few hours in a cafeteria. Once you start earning the big bucks, I’m gonna take a six-month vacation.” Dean quirked his lips in a smile.
He kept an eye on Cas as he moved into the kitchen, then queued up DisneyPlus. “Iron Man 3 comes after Avengers, right?”
Cas looked up, his eyes filled with amusement. “You’re here to offend my nose? I’m not sure what I’ve done to deserve this punishment. You smell like wet dog and engine oil. Though the engine oil smell is a little appealing. The wet dog is definitely not. It must be appealing to someone. Maybe to other dogs. I’m sure Labrador Retrievers don’t mind the smell of each other,” he mused.
Regaining control of his faculties, he clambered out of the car and shut her door firmly. With a small wave, Dean shooed him towards his door. He didn’t pull away until Cas had unlocked the house and stepped inside.
“No, nothing major,” Dean answered absently, ripping the Romaine apart and piling it in a paper towel-lined bowl.
“I understand you have a big black car that could use some love. I’m here to rub her down,” Meg drawled.
Dean hung up and paused for a moment, thinking of the little yellow bungalow between his apartment and Bobby’s house. He thought of using Cas’ shower, stripping off his clothes in Cas’ bathroom, using Cas’ honey-scented shampoo. Drying off with a towel that smelled like Cas’ fabric softener.  He left his own dopp kit on the bed and zipped his backpack.
“Breathe with me, Cassie. In, two, three, four. Hold. Hold. Hold. Hold. Out….” Gabriel repeated his instructions. Cas ran a hand through his hair and got his breathing back under control.
If Dean came by for his scheduled appointment on Thursday afternoon, Cas would apologize for being forward, apologize for kissing him, and reassure him that it would never happen again. And if Dean didn’t want to continue their cuddling arrangement, perhaps he would still be willing to spend time with Cas, watching a movie or sharing a meal. It was nice to just have someone else in his house, during these covid times.  Maybe they could still be friends.
sorry?” Dumbfounded, Cas stared at the top of Dean’s head. He realized an instant too late that his tone might have sounded accusatory when Dean nodded miserably.
“Dean!” Cas’ voice cracked like a whip. “What did I tell you? That’s mine. No touching.” He slicked the condom and crawled back between Dean’s legs. Chastened, Dean gripped Cas’ ass and pulled him down, so their cocks rubbed together.
Cas blew out a breath and leaned back. “I suppose that’s fair,” he said grudgingly. Taking a moment, Dean let his eyes roam over the creature on his lap. Lips kiss-bitten, eyes blown, colour sitting high on his cheekbones. Dark hair mussed like they’d already had sex. Dean groaned a little to himself, wondering why he couldn’t just lose his moral compass for one night…
in him. Cas was a socially awkward math nerd. Hell, he’d even had his stupid glasses on last night. Dean had probably kissed him back out of
Dean let loose a giant breath and stared out the patio door. He was back in layers of clothing tonight, a heavy blue and black plaid shirt on top of a novelty t-shirt. This one said “I still play with blocks” and had a picture of some kind of car part on it. Cas’ brow furrowed, but he was used to not getting jokes.
Dean’s shoulders slumped and he sighed. “Right. A mistake. Won’t happen again.” He paused a moment. “Are you still comfortable with tutoring me? I could pay you. I mean, in cash. Depending on your rate. I might not be able to come every week, though.”
“I asked him to stay for a movie but he said he had to go. I packed up the leftover lasagna for him to take for his boss so he wouldn’t have to cook a separate meal. And… And…” Cas’ breath came a bit faster.
“Oh, you didn’t have to bring frozen pizza, Dean. We could have just ordered fresh.” He rinsed his own hands quickly after handling the beer and wiped them on his jeans.
, his doctor called it. Knowing the scientific name didn’t ease him. Didn’t make it feel better when he was half-convinced every truncated beat would be the last. Cas leaned over, braced his hands on his knees and closed his eyes.
He’d come all the way out here once already tonight? He didn’t realize he’d been standing there gawping at the truck until the other boy’s face closed up.
With a final cry, Dean threw his head back and clenched tightly, his orgasm rippling through his body and shooting across his chest. Cas stroked him through it, his eyes steadfastly on Dean’s face as he watched him lose control. Dean clenched tightly one last time and gasped for breath, pushing Cas over the edge.
Sitting back down in his cramped dining room, he popped the top on the beer and took a long swallow. “It’ll just take time.” He sighed. “And patience. And time. And some insane ability to work with numbers.” He flung his hand in the air and waggled it around as if the ability to work with numbers was some magic trick he just couldn’t gasp.
to chains. Did Cas have restraints in his room? Would Cas really tie him up? What would that feel like, being strapped down, unable to break free, while Cas touched him all over? Maybe he’d use his tongue. Dean wondered if –
“That’s sixty minutes of cuddling owed,” he said, without turning his head to look at Dean. He was staring at the television, but Dean wasn’t sure how much he was actually taking in.
“Dean? This is very strange behaviour for you,” Cas said gravely. He spun on his heel, took a swaying step to the side, righted himself, and sauntered into the kitchen, calendar in tow.
Without losing eye contact, Cas reached out and covered Dean’s hand with his, holding it against his cheek. This was a
Heavy dusk was just settling outside, causing the street lights to flicker on as Cas closed his books and stepped away from the table. With a sigh, he stretched slowly, his back cracking and popping. The tightness bled out of his shoulders as he moved around his little house, switching on lamps as he went. He changed out of his jeans and button-down and into a long-sleeved Henley and track pants, preparing for a comfortable night.
“A platonic cuddle buddy?” He can hear his brother’s confusion, and oh shit, he’d never told Sam about that…
Once Dean removed his boots and sat down, Cas leaned forward, so grateful that he’d taken the time to meditate before Dean showed up. As it was, his hands shook slightly as he rested them on the table. Consciously modulating his tone, he addressed Dean.
There was the honey shampoo that Dean knew he used, he’d smelled it on his shirt after previous cuddling sessions. He groaned quietly under his breath as he worked it into his own hair. He wondered for a moment how many days he could go without a shower, to preserve the scent? Rinsing off, he popped the cap on the matching conditioner and rubbed that on his head, too. He was an all-in-one body wash kind of guy, so he luxuriated in the silky feel of the crème rinse.
Cas turned at the doorway and flicked his eyebrow up with dark promise in his gaze. “We can work on that, if you want,” he offered.
Sighing, he leaned back against the door and shut his eyes. It was a good thing that they had ended the cuddling arrangement. Given the opportunity, he felt that it was entirely too likely that he could fall in love with Dean Winchester.
Cas sighed. “A cuddle buddy. He comes over once a week and I help him with his Accounting homework. In return, we spend an hour on the couch, platonically cuddling, in order to increase oxytocin levels and help my Anxiety.”
“Your name and your apartment address are on the invoice. Everything’s paid for, Mr. Winchester. There is some frozen stuff here, you might want to unload that first. Have a good night!”
“That’s not amusing, Gabriel. Not only do I hold virtual tutoring sessions for the rest of my students, but Dean is the only one to whom I am attracted.” Cas stared out the patio doors, wondering how many lights he could see from his couch.
Cas palmed Dean’s cheeks, holding his face still as sky blue met forest green. “I prefer the word ‘cautious’. Less dumb, less ass.” He licked his way into Dean’s mouth, using a hand fisted in his hair to hold him still for Castiel’s ministrations.
When Dean began to overheat a little, he gently pushed Cas back onto his own feet. He went reluctantly, raising heavy-lidded eyes to meet Dean’s.
When Baby’s headlights shone on Cas’ bungalow, he turned slightly to look at Dean. “I’m afraid I didn’t help you very much tonight. Did you want to come in? We could go over more of the Accruals chapter?”
Cas wiggled into the sand a bit more and propped an arm on Dean’s chest as he squinted to see the screen.
In spite of himself, Cas snorted a laugh at his brother’s antics. He knew without seeing it that Gabe was dancing to his own porn soundtrack.
“I like the part about ruling in Hell instead of serving in Heaven,” Dean replied with a smirk. Cas shoved his shoulder in retaliation.
Carefully stacking noodles, meat sauce, cheese, and his special homemade pasta sauce, he went back over the conversation. Sam’s scholarship had helped them out a lot, but two sets of books (one set used), two apartments, and two grocery bills were not cheap. The only reason Dean even bought meat for his own meals was because he’d learned the hard way that he needed the protein to sustain his physical labour at the shop. Once rent and his own tuition and books were paid for, there wasn’t much left to send to Sam, but he damn sure wasn’t telling him that.
“More, Dean. I want more,” Cas licked and sucked at Dean’s neck, anywhere he could reach, as Dean grabbed his ass and hauled him closer. They shoved and rolled against each other, the truck bed bouncing slightly beneath them.  Cas pulled Dean’s mouth back to his, but they were both too focused on rocking together to do more than pant in each other’s mouths. Dean pushed Cas onto his back. With Dean’s knees bracketing Cas’s thighs, they groaned simultaneously at the added leverage the new position provided. Finesse long gone, Cas twisted up as Dean ground down.
He had his work, he had his classes, and he had Charlie and Sam on Zoom. He didn’t need anything else. And if he found himself lonely and re-watching Avengers, well, half the bloody world was in quarantine, he wasn’t the only lonely one. If only he could get Sam to understand that.
Cas stared at the carpet, at the dirty t-shirt that he’d covered in tears last night. He rubs a finger lightly over the rugburn on his forehead. Gabriel’s right, it’s been years since he’s had an anxiety attack as bad as the one triggered by Dean’s departure.
Sam sighed. “Fine. That’s like seven or eight years from now, you know that, right? I just thought I’d try to help.”
“Of course not, Sam! He’s class – classier – he’s got more class than that. He told me I don’t need tutoring anymore.”
Cas shook his head. “No. The man I was seeing was doing a term in Scotland, and he decided to stay when the pandemic hit. Long distance didn’t work for us.”
“I need to know the terms, so I can understand Bobby’s books and ask him the right questions, and so I can get some accounting program implemented. I kinda get the basics, the debits and credits, but then I get a bit lost. And I know restoration work, it’s gonna mean taking payments in installments and buying parts before the job is done, and I don’t want to bankrupt the business because I don’t understand what I’m doing.”
“Ok, look, I know you’re upset at someone doing these nice things for you. But you do nice things for other people all the time.”
“Thanks, Cas.” Dean took the bag and slipped his boots back on. He flung his backpack over one shoulder and then met Cas’ eyes.
He might be a skinny thing, but his tone and his eyes said he wasn’t going anywhere until Dean coughed up some ID.
They ate at the small wooden dining table where they’d been studying together for four months. Cas had laid out a colourful tablecloth and bought poinsettia-decorated paper plates and napkins for the occasion. Red pillar candles sent dancing shadows across the walls. Covid had interrupted Cas’ plans to spend Christmas with Gabriel, so tomorrow they were headed to Bobby’s for a full Christmas dinner. But tonight was just for them.
Dean clapped him on the back once, twice, then cleared his throat and pushed him away. “See you next week, Cas.”
“I can feel you freaking out from here, Cas. I told you I didn’t mind.” Dean finished lacing his boots and threw his bag over his shoulder. Sure enough, his green eyes were crinkled when he glanced at Cas.
“Uh, yeah. I just…” Dean looked behind him, then at the porch, then at the tops of his boots. Finally he looked up and met his eyes. “Cas, I’m so sorry about Tuesday night.” His eyes dropped back to the ground, and his hands disappeared protectively into his pockets. Hunched in on himself, he was about as small as a six-foot man could get and still be standing.
Cas slid a small gold package out from behind his back. It was slightly larger than a ring box, and wrapped with a green bow. He placed it in Dean’s hand.
“I keep any change I find under the seats,” Meg said. Tying her hair back, she pulled off her leather jacket and threw it in the front seat of the van. She took off her mask and pulled on a pair of rubber gloves.
“I know. College is hard. Studying takes time. This will be worth it in the end.” Dean rolled his eyes as he recited the lines.
“No, shut up. Look, I’m not saying you’re not busy. I get it, Dean. I just want to make sure you’re okay. I know Bobby’s getting older, but can’t he find someone to work part-time so you could cut back on your hours and concentrate on college?” Sam tilted his head down; puppy dog eyes in full effect.
“Yeah, Cas, Jesus, oh…” Dean buried his face in Cas’s neck, one more delicious drag of his hips before he stiffened and grunted heavily.
Cas pressed down against him, sucking a bruise into his collarbone. Dean arched slightly, rubbing his burgeoning erection against Cas’ heavy thigh. Cas groaned and shifted, pressing their hips together. A bolt shot through Dean and he shuddered as their dicks lined up and pressed against each other.
Cas laughed and took the shopping bag into the kitchen. “Don’t worry, Dean. The ornaments are fine. Though I did give our popcorn string a second look on Tuesday.”
“Cas?” Dean’s head turned to face him, close enough that Cas felt his breath against his cheek. If he turned his head right now, maybe they’d have a repeat of that kiss down by the lake. If he just turned his head
“Whatever helps you learn. I usually take my notes manually and then transcribe them, later. It helps to reinforce the lessons and points out places where I might need to do some additional research,” Cas offered.
He checked the counter quickly for hard liquor, and saw nothing but a half-empty Ziploc bag of gummy bears, lying haphazardly next to the stove.
Firming his shoulders, looking anywhere but at Dean’s face, Cas stepped into Dean’s orbit. Immediately Dean’s arms tightened around him, drawing Cas’s head in to his shoulder as his hands splayed across his back. “There we go, that’s not too bad.” Cas felt the rumble of Dean’s words through his chest and shivered.
chance, his brain supplied helpfully. Hesitantly, he wrapped his arms around Dean’s waist and leaned against him. Dean had an inch or two on him; they slotted together like puzzle pieces, hip to shoulder.
“Let go, Dean,” Cas licked his head again, tongue flirting with his slit. Dean sighed with pleasure.
“Holy fuck. Take ‘em off. Please? Please take ‘em off,” Dean begged. He clenched his hand around a toned ass cheek, hard enough to leave bruises. Sure, they’d exchanged hand jobs, but he’d never seen Cas completely naked.
I recognize that the Dean in chapter 2 isn't presented quite the same way as the Dean in chapter 1. What do you think happened to turn Dean into such a softie at Cas' place?
“Okay, okay, I get it. So which of my skills would I need to barter?” Dean cut her off before she could keep listing traits.
Quick as a whip, Alfie took his hand out of the doorframe, dropped the bags with a sigh of relief, and disappeared through the exit door.
“How? How will this work?” Frustrated, Cas thrust a hand through his long, dark hair. A slight breeze played with the ends, teasingly pushing it into his face.
“No, of course not. You brought them.” Cas tilted his head to the side and stretched his neck out. He didn’t realize how much he’d been leaning towards Dean. Their knees had bumped under the table a few times, and his shoulders felt stiff from his hunched position.
Cas took a sip of his drink. This, he could do. Talking about numbers had always come easily to him. “A lot of small businesses start with Cash accounting and move to Accrual when they grow. It would make sense to do the same with Bobby’s business if you plan to expand. It will give you a better financial picture of the garage.”
“Pygophilia. That’s a good one. A personal favourite, for obvious reasons. Or hyphephilia. That could apply, if one was so inclined as to try to categorize actions into perversions or fetishes,” Cas continued.
Dean pushed the Santa hat pom out of his face and kissed Cas’ neck. “Martha’s macaroni and cheese. And I brought Christmas pudding and rum sauce for dessert.”
Dean huffed a little and pushed his chair back from the table. “Yeah, but, you’re ok with –“ here he gestured to his mask – “I gotta take this off, then. If you’re not ok with it, I can take a beer outside for a few minutes before we move on to the cuddle portion of the evening.”
Let me know what you think Cas is going to learn about love languages. And do you think Dean will take any of Sam's words to heart? .... Funny how Dean gets a bit chatty when he's drunk.
Next, he pulled out the chicken breast and broccoli florets and dumped them into a casserole dish with a can of condensed mushroom soup. He wasn’t sure if someone like Dean would consider this “cooking” or not, but in his own mind, it was a step up from ordering out, and the recipe on the back of the can seemed simple enough. At least he was trying…thanks to Dean’s influence.
“No. Last time we communicated very poorly and you left too quickly. I’m not releasing you this time until we’re communicating properly,” Cas insisted.
Dean sighed. “Wasn’t interested. Didn’t want my shitty store-bought dessert. Didn’t want my shitty leftovers. Told me not to come back.”
Dean leapt up from the table like he was on springs. “That’s a great idea, Cas. I can introduce you to Baby.”
Dean stood up, and slid his hands down Cas’ arms to stop short of his hands and grasp his bare wrists. “Dude. I worked all day. I’ve been fed and watered. I have a comfortable seat and great company. I literally have nowhere else I’d like to be right now, unless you’re politely trying to get me the hell out of your house.”
Dean looked away, biting his lip. His erection had flagged slightly, and that just wouldn’t do. Cas smirked and pushed firmly against Dean’s entrance. “Don’t worry, Dean. When we’re done, you’ll know exactly who you belong to.”
Without provocation, Cas slid his tongue up Dean’s length, forearm heavy on his thighs to keep him in place. Dean twitched and twisted on the bed, heat coursing through him as Cas placed wet, open-mouthed kisses all along his cock.
Cas glowered at him. “Dean, I’m perfectly capable of making rational decisions.” Dean dropped a hand to his hip and rubbed soothingly.
With Martha’s Macaroni in the oven, Cas pulled Dean into the living room to sit on the couch. “Rudolph or Frosty?” He asked, cueing up the TV.
“You won’t regret it,” Dean promised. He tilted Cas’ chin slightly and met his lips. Cas turned more fully towards him, wrapping a hand around Dean’s neck and kissing him again as Sam the Snowman appeared on screen.
He bent to meet Cas, his parted with a shaking exhale. He was expecting a small kiss, Cas knew. He gathered that from the careful way he had bent and the light grip over Castiel’s arm. He expected a quiet slide of Castiel’s lips over his.
There is sweat glistening on Charlie’s forehead as she keeps banging on the drums. I used to love watching her play. Now it looks rehearsed. Everything from her dangly earrings to the bandanna on her head looks rehearsed. Beside me, Benny with his lead guitar and his leather pants look rehearsed. Behind him, Gabe looks rehearsed with the painted smirk. And here I am. Anxious on the stage. Looking at the wooden floor. Pep talking myself to sing.
Dean bent lower, using his hand to stroke the length his mouth couldn’t reach as his other hand squeezed on Castiel’s balls. Cas groaned loudly, his head hitting the headboard as he came. Dean swallowed, almost on instinct – before taking Cas out of his mouth and looking up.
“Shut up,” Dean groaned, grabbing Castiel’s neck and bringing his lips to his own. He moaned into the kiss when Castiel’s fingers massaged his nipples. Cas moved from Dean’s mouth to his jaw, sucking – kissing – biting in perfect rhythm. Dean eyes were fixed on Castiel – pupil blown and shining as his mouth made involuntary noises in sync with Castiel’s kisses. Cas was storing those sounds somewhere in his brain, to play on loop again and again.
Dean was typing out a response when the phone started to ring, Charlie’s caller address on the screen.
I raise my fist to knock at the door but before I can however, the door swings open and Gabriel steps out. His eyes widen slightly when he looks at me and he glances back into the house in alarm, before grabbing my arm and steering me away from the house.
His voice has the same lilt it did when we first met and I watch him return to his seat. God, I hate this man.
“Please tell me Benny’s lying, Dean,” Anna said, her lips pouting, “please tell me both off you are messing with me.”
The thing with being an artist is, you learn to notice the smallest of details. I notice the calluses on his fingers. He plays. I notice how rough his skin is. I notice the glint in his eyes because he knows he has won.
Dean would’ve had no problems with the cold shouldering Castiel. But there was an issue. Dean and Sam went to the Novak’s house almost
Charlie whistled, “Let me tell you, Dean. That was one helluva kiss. If you guys kissed like that. I can only imagine…” Charlie sighed, “Was it good?” She asked and it was Dean’s turn to sigh.
“Because he is competent, Dean. And the only competent person willing to go to Europe at a day’s notice.”
Cas smirked and looked up at the circle of the people around him. He narrowed his eyes at Dean Winchester.
He turns to face me, and I’ve never seen him like this. He’s been angry, pissed off, sad, reserved, but this is all of those things at once, like there’s chaos inside him that he’s trying to contain but is barely managing it, “I’m leaving, Dean.”
Dean tried to not move as Cas began again, licking the head softly as Dean’s fingernails scraped uselessly at the tiles on his sides. He almost jumped when Cas finally opened his mouth and took the entire tip inside, sucking a few inches in and back.
Cas grinned, running a hand through his hair as he walked back to his own chair – stopping to fist pump Gabriel who couldn’t have looked prouder.
I keep holding him to the wall, till he calms down and his breathing evens a little. I lift my hand from his chest and take a step back, only to come back in when he fists my shirt and kisses me. I respond automatically, regardless of the fact that we’re standing in the corridor of a really sleazy motel where any homophobic old man with a rifle could walk up on us. Not that I’m homosexual. He groans into my mouth and my fingers card through his hair.
As soon as Dean was home, he was texting Charlie. His best friend, almost sister and the only person who knew about his infatuation with Castiel Novak.
I am severely and utterly fucked. Literally and figuratively. I sigh at the ceiling as I hear Meg banging things around in my apartment. Mine, not hers. Taking away her things as she screams at me about how shitty of a boyfriend I am.
“What did he do?” my voice is hardly audible, and Gabriel probably hears it because he’s waiting for me to ask.
“Let me go,” he tries to use his body strength to get me off of him, and I shove him back at the wall.
“Hey... listen,” I start again, “this isn’t the way. You can’t run away. We can talk to you dad. I’ll talk to him.”
uncomfortable in the tight denims but Dean kept his attention focused on Castiel. He needed to show Cas this meant more to him than his usual flings. He needed Cas- and he needed him to know.
She calls me her boyfriend. A shitty one at that. When did I become her boyfriend? Three months ago we were dancing at a club in Dubai. Now she is calling me her girlfriend and expecting me to take her on tour. It’s probably me, I am a magnet of fuckery.
Dean’s eyes widened slightly as his mouth opened to say something but no words came out. Cas stared back and raised his eyebrows, giving Dean a cocky grin. This was perfect. Cas was openly gay. So obviously daring the most straight jock of high school was probably the most surefire forfeit ever. Cas was sure Dean would never kiss a guy. Maybe he might just do it for a bet? The entire group of people around them laughed as Dean looked to the floor.
I get up and shower. Grab whatever clothes I can get my hands on. Brush my fingers through my hair and leave the apartment. I lock the door behind me as I put on baseball hat, shove my face to the ground and get in my car to get to where my manager is right now.
He opens the door to his room and leaves me standing in the corridor. Into the room with a single mattress, a duffel bag and a guitar. The broken kingdom he’s choosing over me.
I pull his shirt off of him, while shrugging out of my own leather jacket. Castiel fights the buttons of my shirt with slightly trembling fingers, slight scarlet coloring his cheeks. We reach for each other’s zippers at the same time. I get his jeans off of him and grasp his cock, stroking once. Cas almost falls against me, his face in the crook of my neck, his breath washing over my skin. I stroke him again and he groans, jerking into my hand.
the cogs turning in Dean’s brain. He smirked at the boy. He was going to make him stop thinking, make him stop worrying. Reaching down as everyone around the table choked on air, Cas grasped Dean’s t-shirt collar and dragged him to stand up before crashing his lips to his own.
