“What if you hadn’t been forced to remember, Cas?” Sam asks. “Wouldn’t you have been happier if we hadn’t dragged you back into all this?”
“Yeah. You gotta work in the morning?”
. Castiel knows, better than anyone, that there’s always the next crisis, something always looming on the horizon. He’s just a human now, and of no use to the Winchesters as he is, regardless of Dean’s affirmations to the contrary. Just another mouth to feed, someone else to get hurt. Moisture wells up in Castiel’s eyes, and his breath hitches as he tries to not cry.
among others. Eventually Dean convinces Cas to watch something from their personal collection, just to avoid the world for a while.
“Cas, what—”
He’s tried falling asleep next to Cas while watching movies he’s already seen hundreds of times, but Cas just wakes him up and says he should go to bed if he’s tired, that falling asleep while sitting up might strain something. Dammit, Dean may be more open to talking about things, but he draws the line in… asking for
* * * * *
Knocking on the door frame, Dean steps in hesitantly. A gravelly voice says, "Yes?" but the man doesn’t look up. Dean crosses over to what appears to be a clear spot on the desk, placing the mail bundle down while clearing his throat. He’s ready to turn around unacknowledged when Mr. Novak looks up, catching Dean with his amazingly blue eyes. Embarrassed over his lacking wardrobe, Dean hadn't bothered giving the CEO a good look at the intern introduction. But now he can't look away.
“But there’s not much room,” Castiel argues, as Dean pulls him towards the front.
“I wanna haul your ass back to the bunker with me,” Dean replies.
“We didn’t make that kind of mess, and I’ll get the dishes in the morning if you refuse to touch them. Night!” He doesn’t turn around, but he does hear when Sam notices what he’s done.
With a sigh, Dean wipes a hand down his face and wishes for a beer. He’d just told himself he wasn’t going to think about Cas. Rolling over, Dean tries to ignore how flat the pillow is beneath his head, or how it smells. He tries to not think of the angel inhabiting his brother’s body, or the fallen one thousands of miles away, possibly sleeping on a convenience store floor. The last thing he definitely does
Glancing around the cafe to see it’s currently empty, Castiel drops his persona and scowls at Dean. “Why are you here again?”
Dean and Sam watch as the town around them continues on like nothing happened, maybe even a little calmer than before. Jack carries an air of serenity. Sam stumbles through trying to ask what Jack is now.
Planning his next step, he hears the phone behind the counter ring. Castiel listens as Bernie argues with whoever is on the other end. Apparently they aren’t coming in today. Hanging up the phone with a curse, Bernie picks it back up and makes another call, letting someone know about the incessant uselessness of a Paula.
Dean opens the door, and lets Castiel in first. The room is relatively tidy, minus the signs of Dean having been staying here. On the king size bed is a dark green cover with an abstract print in mottled white and light green. Dark wood furnishes the room, with a dresser and TV across from the bed, a small table and two chairs near the window, a mini fridge and microwave tucked into the corner. Clothes are piled up on a duffle near the bathroom, and some bottles and wrappers in the trash display Dean’s extended presence.
I heavily skimmed the whole speech, but it's from Sam's POV so there's still tears.
Oh. They’re still standing in the middle of the shaving goods aisle. Slightly embarrassed that he got caught up in his own imagination, Castiel follows Dean to the next aisle. When they exit the store, Castiel is surprised that he has only purchased a few bags worth of items. It all might be uncomfortable to carry on the bus, but will easily be one trip from the Impala to the back door of the cafe.
“You OK, Cas?”
While he waits, he sees the familiar shape of a mail cart come into view, pushed by one Dean Winchester. Dean looks up, and Castiel can see him slow down briefly before continuing to push the cart up to Meg's desk.
But when Dean
In the car, they intertwine their fingers, hands resting between them. As they drive, the light turns a deeper hue, edging closer to sunset. Down the road, they pass by a lake and he stops near a dock, a folding chair and some fishing gear at the end, as if it were waiting for him. It’s a place that has an actual memory, a place in his dreams, one that Cas once visited.
“Yeah, so, uhh… bye.”
When the food arrives, Dean eagerly samples all the offerings, and Castiel starts with a chicken taquito, dipped in salsa. It’s a little spicy, so he washes it down with some beer. The cheese curds are quite good too, especially with the creamy sriracha dipping sauce. Fried pickles, onion rings, barbecued pork, spicy chicken strips and fries, they make their way through the basket, and their pints. Dean orders them another round, and a shot of whiskey for himself.
“Dude,
Later, Sam and Jody are arguing near the foot of Dean’s bed, Cas seated in his usual spot next to Dean, watching him sleep. The doctors suggested a fresh battery of tests. MRIs, CT scans, EEGs. They also suggest visiting one of the resident psychiatric doctors for signs of mental illness.
“Don’t turn into someone who’s going to spend all their time worrying about crap.”
He hands Sam a beer and they sit on the edge of the table, both Castiel and Jack fresh additions to their small collection.
Maybe that’s what he needs right now? Dean’s in good hands between Jody and Cas. It will give Sam time to clear his head, deal with all the bombshells dropped on them in the past few days. Before he’s made it to Jody’s, Sam is calling Kevin, telling him he’ll be on his way tomorrow.
They finish the last of their drinks, Castiel insisting that regardless of his tolerance, that Dean shouldn’t have any more. From just the two beers he’s had, Castiel is already quite tipsy. Everything is comfortably warm, his cheeks are flushed, and smiles come easy with every story and joke Dean tells.
Just then, Dean’s phone rings, and he stands up and faces away to answer. “This is Agent Lee Ermey.” There’s a long pause, and Castiel can see Dean’s shoulders tighten. There must have been another incident. “Thank you for calling. I’ll be right there.”
screw me over, I know a medicine woman who can and
There’s a stereo perched on a high shelf, and Castiel switches it on lo listen to one of the local stations that plays an assortment of all kinds of music. Something bright and fast-paced is playing, and he starts preparing the dough. The song ends, and another one starts, much slower in tempo. He’s fine with it, until the chorus starts.
“Yeah, the great thing is, the further you get from town, the cheaper they are.” He drives them past the places Castiel has become familiar with, and they start seeing interstate signs. Just before the onramp, Dean takes a right, and keeps going until they arrive at a quiet motel surrounded by pines. Even with the proximity to the interstate, it’s quiet.
come over who you obviously have some history with, and I can see the way you look at him. I still think he’s an ex, by the way. Of course I would think you were getting kinky in my kitchen!”
Jolene shows him how to put on the wig cap, and how to make sure the wig stays in place. He’s already wearing his pink shirt and brown apron, so she steps back and takes a good look at him. ”We’ll need to make sure you stay clean shaven since your hair’s so dark, but I think you look good.”
How is it that Dean manages to be exactly what he needs? Castiel pulls out a chair. “Or, you could help me now, and I can get someone to finish distributing the mail.” Dean glances up at him in surprise. Knowing food is an effective motivator, Castiel adds, “I’ll order lunch for you as well.”
By the time the popcorn is done, but doesn’t smell burnt yet, Dean’s settled on an Indiana Jones movie. He hands over the unopened bag, and debates where he should sit. The table is too far away, and the edge of the bed would be awkward. Dean pats the pillow next to him. “C’mon, dude. Get comfy, but take your shoes off first.“
Next chapter will feature Sam, and what he does when he goes to see Kevin at the bunker.
Chapter 4:
Castiel started his day early, catching up on the last of his correspondence from yesterday, arranging for someone to take over Dean’s duties today, and is already on his second cup of coffee by the time Meg shows up, five minutes before eight as usual. By the time Castiel is ready to set up in the conference room, Meg’s leaning against his office door, a large coffee in hand.
“Oh thank God, we thought we lost you.” Relief floods through Sam, and he finds himself holding back tears, catching a sob before it can make it past his lips.
Castiel glances around the enclosed space. It’s not incredibly large, but he supposes there could be room if they’re careful. Moving toward the back, he gestures Dean in. Grinning, Dean slips inside and ducks under the shower, splashing the water around until he’s all wet. Castiel can’t help but stare, taking in as much of the sight of Dean as he can. He’d always thought Dean was beautiful, and he still is, his strong, muscular body slightly soft in places, the cut of his hips, the curve of his legs.
With one side of his mouth pulling into a smirk, Dean’s eyes scan the menu board. “You got plain drip coffee?”
After a moment, Sam replies, “Well, yeah, there was this weird thing that was some sort of dream? And Dean said…” His eyes go wide. “Cas, what did I agree to?”
She stands a little straighter before replying, “He appears to be showing symptoms of Retrograde Amnesia.”
“We live in the middle of nowhere, with crazy ass robots and rioters on the loose. You don’t expect us to protect ourselves?”
While he scrambles some eggs, Dean thinks about how they found Emma almost two years ago, broken and bleeding blue onto the street. She was a barely functioning ST200, and Dean had at first thought she was beyond repair. But Cas insisted, so they took her to Sam, who knew a few people. The way she’d stared up at them, begging to not be shut down or reformatted… He’d known then that she was different. They just didn’t know how much at the time.
He does, four more times, with no indication from her if he’s getting better or worse. With the last extraction, she tells him to make a cappuccino with it. After fumbling with the steamer, he tries three times before she allows him to pour the milk into the now cooling espresso. The top isn’t pretty like he saw in the videos, but he hopes it tastes alright. Placing the drink in front of Jolene, he awaits her verdict.
Taking a deep breath, Castiel asks again, “If I had taken a female body, would we have had sex?”
“We really made a mess here, huh?”
“Dean.” Exasperated, Castiel crosses his arms and frowns.
Once on the correct floor, he slowly makes his way to Dean’s room. He finds himself hesitant, anxious to see the man’s condition. Is he awake yet? How is Sam handling things? He pauses at the door and takes a deep breath. He’s seen Dean in the hospital before. He can do this.
They’re both panting, the taste of each other lost to the spray of water, hips slip-sliding together with their mutual rhythm, one of Dean’s hands guiding Castiel’s hips. “Cas,” Dean breathes into his ear, “Touch me,
“I gotta answer this. Be right back.”
That catches Dean’s full attention. “Come again?”
Castiel bows his head and thanks her, taking his first sip of hot coffee. He can tell she’s patiently waiting, as he stalls by tearing off a chunk of croissant and shoving it in his mouth. When he’s swallowed, he takes a deep breath and looks up at her. “I need to apologize for wasting baking ingredients last night, there was a mishap.”
If he were still an angel, he could heal Dean. But he’s not. Why is he even here? As if Sam could hear his thoughts, he shifts and reaches for Dean’s hand. “Hey, Dean? Cas is here. You’d like to see him, wouldn’t you?”
This is Dean, here with him, present and making him feel… he has no words. Perhaps long poems written in a language long forgotten by human tongues could describe how he feels. But for now he abandons words in favor of pure sensation. Skin on skin, his own hands wandering and touching Dean, feeling parts of him he’d reconstructed years ago. New scars are traced, they taste the sweat from each other’s bodies. Their actions become more heated, frantic as they embrace each other.
“I mean it, Castiel, Sam
“Cas. Food. Drugstore. Then I’ll help you clean.”
"You need to get out of your office more," she comments with a raised eyebrow.
Sam POV
“No.”
Cas turns off the screen.
November 10, 2038
Castiel can practically feel Dean's eyes trailing down his chest. “I’m trying something new.” As Dean nods and turns back to his cart, Castiel remembers something. “Oh, wait! I have some outgoing mail for you to take back.”
“You’re scared,” Dean says, almost accusatory.
Castiel feels stupid when all he can do is shake his head again.
The hinges squeak. “Mind if I come in?”
“It’s the principle!”
“Our kind of interesting? Or…”
That’s right, Dean went to get towels. “Yes, Dean?”
“And you know what he went through?” Sam’s eyes search his.
Left alone to discuss their options, Sam doesn’t want them poking or prodding Dean any more than they need to. They’d already been warned that you can’t trigger memories into returning, that it’s usually a spontaneous thing. But what if Dean’s memories come back while he’s talking to a shrink? What if they don’t come back all at once, and Dean starts raving about vampires and werewolves? What about Hell? If he starts talking, not realizing he shouldn’t, they’d lock him away for sure.
“I’m fine. Getting out soon, though.”
Dean is the first to break the silence. “I mean it, I’m going to stand here and wait for you to tell me you’ve secured the entry.” He wiggles his phone in one hand.
“Dean, you need to see this!”
They don’t waste any time finding the barn. Dean’s spirits seem to be high, and Sam has to put his foot down about using throwing stars. They still aren’t sure how many vamps are in the nest, and they can’t risk accidentally hurting each other or the kids with a bad throw.
at him?
"Good morning," Castiel replies, watching Dean's cheeks grow a little pink.
No one could ever call their relationship normal, so Dean throws out the rulebook and tells Cas they can take things at their own pace. But it’s still too slow for Dean’s tastes. Now that they know how they feel about each other, Dean wants to do the things that, uh,
The week before Christmas, Martial law is officially lifted from the city of Detroit. Slowly, slowly, life finds a new normal.
“Apologies?”
For now, keep Ephraim talking. “How’d you find me?” Castiel asks.
“Here you go.”
“You look like you could use this,” she says with a curious smile.
"Dean." Cas places his hand over Dean's again, stopping him from turning the movie off. How the hell can he put so much emotion into saying his name? It's spoken softly yet with command. Dean refuses to look at him and stares at the TV without really watching.
Dean purses his lips and nods. “Cool, I’ll see you then.”
That makes Dean laugh. “You have a weird way of saying ‘cuddle,’ Cas.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I no longer have an angelic metabolism, remember?”
echoes in his head.
“What’s it going to take to get you to come with me?”
“What do you mean, Dean? You didn’t know that the Rit-Zien would come for me.”
“Just be careful,” is all she says as she pats his cheek and turns back to putting away supplies.
Sighing through his nose, Castiel chews quickly and swallows. “I always worry about you, Dean.”
Dean stands at the entrance waving a file folder. “When I swung by your office, Meg asked I drop this off to you in here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wow. So you’ve gone from Heavenly warrior, to… glorified coffee brewer.”
“What are you talking about?”
At some point during the morning, Dean slips and start using his personal abbreviation of Cas, instead of Castiel. But Mr. Novak doesn’t say anything, so he keeps using it. Lunch is another fancy sandwich, and Dean tries to keep an eye on the time today. While it’s been nice working on this project with Cas, he knows the man must have other things to do. But it’s becoming increasingly difficult to avoid being distracted by Cas. He’s a good looking man, and while at first glance may be a bit of a hardass, he really seems to care about his employees.
“I’ll let your supervisor know by end of day today. Don’t forget to check your emails, as they will detail your new departments starting Tuesday, as well as give your supervisor’s contact information.” With a nod, Castiel makes to leave. “Please enjoy your morning refreshments before finishing your last day at your current assignments, and once again, have a safe and happy holiday weekend.”
“Oh, I think I’m good, here.” Castiel turns to Dean. “I apologize for taking up so much of your time.”
“I can help you with that.”
There’s a streak of sudsy moisture across the phone’s screen, on the end button. Castiel blinks at it for a moment before grabbing a towel to wipe it off. Bernie pokes his head out of the kitchen door and brings a mop for the water on the floor. Excusing himself, Castiel goes to his room to change out of his wet clothes. As for Dean, well… he hasn’t called back yet, and doesn’t know where Castiel is, so maybe he’ll deal with the case and move on. It hurts a bit to think that they’ll be in the same town briefly and never meet.
“Yes.” Unsure how to react to Dean’s tone (is that disappointment?), Castiel takes a long drink of his beer.
He can’t help it, he turns to look at Cas, who looks inquisitive. “Yeah?”
It’s been over a week since the incident, and Dean is still unconscious. If it goes another day, Sam will force Gadreel to try healing him again. The doctors say that it can take longer to wake up the more head injuries you’ve had. It doesn’t alleviate Sam’s worries, especially when Gadreel said there was something wrong even he couldn't heal.
I hope you enjoyed my little fix-it.
“Dean,” Cas breathes, sitting next to him. “I would love to participate in physical intimacy with you.”
Dean gives a fatalistic speech about how he always expected to go out this way, and Sam feels like he’s in a waking nightmare, like he’s in another one of Chuck’s bad scenarios. He’s trying so hard to listen to Dean’s words while internally he’s screaming at himself to just
“Yeah, okay. I’m gonna give the phone to Jody, so she can help you arrange how to get here. Just a sec.”
Sam sets his mouth, shakes his head, and turns back to the table. “No. There are other hunters out there. We could retire, start over. I just have to figure out what to do with Crowley, make sure Kevin’s alright.”
He shakes himself, and answers, “Yes, sorry. You said… They say he’s… stable?” The words fall flat inside the stockroom, his mind abuzz with the injuries Sam described, vivid pictures painted in his mind.
“I love you, Cas.” Shit, it’s getting hard to breathe. Did he fuck up his lung again?
It takes all of Castiel’s willpower to turn away from Dean and walk behind the counter, only glancing back when he reaches the door to the kitchen. Dean stands there, mouth slightly agape, before he collects his pie plate and coffee cup, dropping them off in the bin before squaring his jaw and breezing out the door with a wave. With a deep sigh, Castiel closes his eyes, and tries to ignore the pain in his chest before he pushes into the kitchen to deal with Jolene.
Castiel looks down at her, noticing that even she is dressed slightly more casually in a soft, flowy cotton top, a tailored leather jacket over the back of her chair.
Dean pulls him into an awkward hug, patting him on the back. “If your wrist doesn’t get much better, go to a clinic or something, have it checked out.”
Dean has stopped moving, his hands on either side of his now bandaged wrist on the table. Glancing up, Dean’s looking at him with concern. “Cas, you okay?”
At dawn, Castiel makes his way to a place called Fresh Start which offers resources, breakfast, and showers. There he receives kind words from the staff, the aforementioned meal and shower, as well as a handful of pamphlets before heading back to the library. Along the way he passes a cafe and bakery with a sandwich board sign on the sidewalk, with a message written on it:
“Hey Cas?”
Meg’s words stay with Castiel all through warming up the projector, booting up his laptop, and pulling up his notes from yesterday. He can’t help but start to think about how long it’s been since he’s been… intimate with anyone. It takes him a while to remember his last partner. But he’s been busy, focusing on work.
“I don’t think—”
He’s glad Dean’s being safe, even if he most likely slept in the car for a couple of hours.Before lunchtime, he receives another:
Oh. Is he expected to get out? Walk all the way back to the cafe? Is Dean abandoning him yet again, now that he serves no purpose? “I need a ride,” he whispers.
Oh yes, he remembers well what it was like, the specter of Lucifer tormenting him. “Yes, but what does this have to do with—”
"What's what?"
He pauses just long enough to flip off Sam. "He told me he hadn't seen you in five years, so last time I saw you. And then Croatoan virus started catching, angels took a sabbatical, and— and I guess Cas' mojo went with them. I— He was human, and not doin' so hot with it." There is a poorly hidden story in the end of that sentence, and Dean is grateful that Sam lets it slip by without comment. Instead he glances to the photo again.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You—" He manages to look at Sam, but that's about all he can do.
Dean runs his tongue over his teeth, letting Sam stew while he digs out a stuck bit of burger. "Uh-uh. Salad's mine 'til you tell me what you did— I know it was something."
It takes considerable effort not to laugh at that, because Cas would most certainly not get it. Still, Dean would rather eat kale than explain to his brother that he got drunk and frisky with their friend right before his future self sent that friend to his death. "Fine." He takes great satisfaction in the gobsmacked minute it takes Sam to recover from not needing whatever extra argument he'd been working on.
“This isn't him,” it says, standing and turning to face them.
Castiel squeezed his eyes shut and pinched the bridge of his nose. When he opened them again, Dean was shocked by the hurt filled glare, and the man's trembling lips as he said, “No, of course… you wouldn't remember that.” Dean narrowed his eyes at him, but before he could ask just what the hell he didn't ‘remember,’ Castiel was speaking again. “You asked about my name, my odd name. It's an angelic name. And the reason I know all this, Dean, is because I'm an angel.” He pointed at the gift tag, almost as if he was trying to make a joke, his mouth ghosting a smile, but failing miserably.
Dean just smiles and relishes the moment, knowing hell is coming later.
"Great. Thanks." Sam's eyes flicker to his hand and back again. "Can I have my food?"
He shrugs. "What do you want me to say? It's a picture."
"But I- I'm not—" He would like to be able to finish at least one sentence in this conversation, but he also desperately does not want to voice the rest of his thought. Of course Cas finishes it for him, because now Cas is human enough to understand and stoned enough not to care. He's got that forceful grin, apparently tickled by Dean's frantic defense of his masculinity.
"A drink and a burger!"
When Cas makes his way back inside, the first thing he does is open another bottle and down a few generous gulps. When he straightens and finally looks at Dean again, the funhouse mirror of a smile is back in place.
doesn't even cover it.
Sam is a little too observant for Dean's liking.
. Dean's clearly not apologizing for anything in 2014, so may as well get it out of the way now. But the razorblade grin and dilated gaze, the crack of Cas' neck when his head lolled and the sour smell of sweat and booze are still fresh, and
"The dick?"
(See the end of the chapter for
In two days at Camp Chitaqua, Dean learns that the world is ending, Sam is Lucifer's meatsuit, and he's a heartless bastard of a man. Even with all that, and a Croatoan hot zone and Lucifer looming ahead of sunrise, Cas' faintly inebriated suggestion that he and Dean have shared a bed for more than sleeping is still enough to leave Dean spluttering.
"'Cause there's clearly a lot more to this whole end-of-days ghost-of-Christmas-future deal than what you told me— and that's fine, you don't have to tell me everything. But I'm not dumb, Dean. I know whatever you're not saying is about you and Cas." Apparently taking Dean's silence as permission to continue, he adds, "So I think you and Cas should, you know, talk. Whatever happened there, he's probably gonna get it more than either of us could, right?"
"Uh, good."
"What? Why?" Dean slides the clear container across the table, and Sam pops it open and starts tossing raisins and dressing with all the annoyance he can muster.
"Hey, Cas."
"You're okay then?" Cas' irritation is audible through the phone, and Dean huffs a laugh before he can help himself.
"— Just, keep me in the loop on the God search, okay?"
To his credit, Sam doesn't blow up right then, but the pressure is right there, boiling under his skin until his voice shakes with it. "Dean, is this for sure our future you saw?"
, but he knows the answer. He saw himself with flint in his eyes and death on his hands, saw someone who's supposed to be him kill a friend without hesitation or remorse.
"Yeah." Thirty years of being an older brother is as good as being formally trained to sniff out bullshit. Dean decides to hold onto the salad.
"Dean?" Cas' voice is so quiet on the other end of the line that Dean doesn't understand at first. "Worth what?" He hadn't meant to say it out loud.
(See the end of the chapter for
They break apart, and one of them— Dean wants to think it's Cas, but he wouldn't make any bets— makes a wounded sound that has Dean pressing back in to kiss the loss away.
"Alright, geez, will you stop looking at me like that? It happened while you were gone." Sam is still looking at him expectantly, so he sighs and settles down on the bed for the explanation. "Our buddy Zach wanted to teach me a lesson, so he zapped me to some weird future where the world's ending and I'm a dick and Cas is a hippie or something. I guess the goal was to get me to say yes to Michael. Happy now?"
I know everyone and their mother has written about Castiel and Dean in the endverse, but I couldn't resist adding my two cents of angst to the pot. It's just a bit of a horrifying concept to see someone you love become so unrecognizably dissociated from their own life, and some of the unseen moments surrounding that episode have haunted my head ever since I watched it.
What? Did he hear that right? Eyes wide, Castiel looks at the man who is just now realizing what he said. Dean’s hand slips off the backrest, and he turns to face the steering wheel. “I mean, there’s cable. Maybe we can find a movie?”
did he manage to find a place like this?
So here he is, late on a Sunday, and WHERE IS HIS SUITCASE?
Knowing he shouldn’t be staring, Castiel struggles to keep the mask of his new persona in place. He cracks a smile and says in his sweetest voice, “W-what can I get for you?” Ahh, only a little bit of a stammer, but Dean notices.
Things get a bit meta during movie night.
“Dean,” Sam stands up, unsure what to do with his hands. “Like I said, I talked to them. If you want it, they could use someone in the kitchen.”
Dean chuckles. Success! “Okay, Captain bar-fly. Time to walk it off.” He keeps a hold of Castiel’s arm as he pays for their drinks and food, and steers him out the door.
Castiel blinks at him. “Why not?”
Inside, he sees Sam at the dining table, sorting through weapons in his duffle bag. “Is something wrong, Sam?”
She picks it up, sniffs at it, takes the tiniest of sips. Setting the cup down on the counter, she looks into Castiel’s eyes. “You’ve never done this before?”
“How about it? We’ll stop by, stay the night, and if it’s nothing, we won’t have to wait on the Hastings WalMart to open the next morning.”
“Oh.” Dean shifts from foot to foot, hands clasped, head lowered. “If you like… I could… come back when I’m finished?”
The question causes Cas to fidget. “Technically. I still have Grace, since Jack asked for my help. But I…” He clears his throat. “I also have a soul.”
“Mmm.” Dean takes a bite of his croissant, and talks with his mouth full. “What do you normally do on days off?”
haha hahaha chapter 2 within 24 hours.
“Let’s get dressed, we don’t have too long before checkout, now.”
On the drive to the location, Dean turned on the radio, and “Carry On Wayward Son” drifted from the speakers. Now that he thought about it, the band playing it were probably all in Heaven, too. Dean wasn’t in any rush as he pulled to a stop in the middle of a secluded bridge spanning a stream. There wasn’t any real significance to the location, but he’d passed it on one of his heaven wanderings, and he found it peaceful. A perfect landing spot for his little brother.
“It’s okay, honey. I believe you. And if you don’t want to tell me what happened, fine.” A buzzer goes off, and Jolene picks up a pair of oven mitts. “Is he coming by again today?”
“Buddy, if you haven’t made up your mind, I’m ordering for you.”
“Yeah,” says Dean, taking another long drink and signaling the bartender for another shot.
“For tonight… Just for tonight, I want for us to be more.” Dean makes a noise and starts to pull away, but Castiel holds onto Dean’s arms, keeping them wrapped around him. “I don’t care if you leave tomorrow and never look back. Just let me have this.” The last words come out as a whisper.
Looking over at Emma, he sees her trembling, LED still cycling yellow, yellow, yellow. He pulls her down onto the couch between him and Cas and holding her head to his shoulder as Cas takes her hand. They watch the news reports in silence for a good half hour before Sam contacts them first.
Not ready to open up about that subject yet, Dean clears his throat and crosses his arms, nodding for Sam to continue.
November 29th, Dean, Cas, and Emma make their way back down to Lawrence, Kansas, to assess the damage that storms have done to their home. They got lucky, with only a couple broken windows, some torn roofing, and landscaping damage. Overall, Kansas is handling the android transition relatively well compared to other cities and towns. Androids, of their own free will, are helping with relief efforts to rebuild Mid-West cities ravaged by storms, which has done much for human goodwill in those areas. Detroit has been slowly having residents return, but is still under martial law to control rioting.
Maybe what Dean needs is another hunt to get his head on straight again. But it’s been spookily quiet. Almost like whatever Jack did calmed down the world for a little while. Fresh out of a shower after a run, Sam heads to the library and finds Dean at his computer, intently staring at something, Miracle in the chair next to him, never very far.
“Yes, well I suppose a change in one’s relationship will alter the dynamic.”
She glances around the kitchen. “Well, you cleaned up pretty good. I guess that explains the sad state your wig is in then.”
The front yard went from green grass with a picket fence, to a flower garden with a winding stone path. Miracle soon joined their little family unit, and one day, while Dean was washing Baby for the sheer enjoyment of it. Eileen walked up to him. They embraced, and Dean led her inside so they could catch up, Eileen full of stories of love, family, and fulfillment with Sam. It made Dean happy to know Sam finally got the life he deserved, and still kept the hunter network thriving.
“Goodbye, Dean.”
Dean gets up off the bed, setting his glass on the nightstand. Rubbing a hand through his hair, he scrubs at his face and mumbles something. It sounds like he said something about Castiel, who gets up on his knees, albeit wobbly.
Cas returns the kiss, and there’s that want for more. “You know,” Dean says against Cas’s lips, “We can always get started on that sex part.”
When Castiel arrives in Sioux Falls, he panics when he sees the Sheriff’s vehicle waiting at the curb, the woman dressed in uniform waving him over. Having never met Jody Mills in person, he has to remind himself that he’s not in trouble, that the woman with short brown hair is a friend of the Winchesters. She surprises him with a hug.
Dean doesn’t care, he just wants to go home and to make sure everyone else is back where they belong. But Jack declines.
Suddenly feeling tired, Castiel stands. “Is there anything else, Dean?”
felt about last night. Worrying the edge of the coffee lid with a fingernail, he glances up at Dean. “Do you? Regret it, I mean.”
“I’ve been awake since early this morning, and was expecting to open again tomorrow. I’m just tired.” He doesn’t mention the low throb in his wrist, he can take a pain reliever before going to sleep.
November 9, 2038
He’s slow to respond, and Sam can barely make out his request for water, but soon enough has a cup with a straw for Dean to take a drink. At Dean’s next one-word request of ‘where,’ Sam has to think about it for a second, since he mentioned they were at Sioux Falls General last time, until he realizes Dean probably remembers Cas was here before. But Cas had gone back to Jody’s earlier today, since he’d stayed behind last night while Sam crashed out in Jody’s guest room.
don’t have powers.” Dean says in a cajoling tone.
Doctor Cameron finally emerges from Dean’s room, but instead of letting them back in, she closes the door behind her. That’s not good. “It appears Dean is suffering from memory loss.”
Castiel remembers something he’d overheard one of his customers talking about, having to do with wearing her boyfriend’s shirt. At first, it didn’t make sense, but now that he’s wearing one of Dean’s shirts, he’s carrying the scent of Dean with him. Lifting the wolf shirt to his nose, he can smell alcohol and sweat. “I’m afraid this one is dirty, I can get you a clean one—”
Dean tried to fight having the bag placed in his mouth, but half-dead, he was weak, and Sam almost botched the incantation because of shaking hands and blurred vision, but when Dean went into suspended animation, Sam breathed a sigh of relief. He wasn’t sure how long the spell would last so he had to work quickly. First, the kids. He got them piled in the back seat, told them to crouch down in the footwells just in case there were any more… vamp-mimes.
Dean turns in his seat, the engine idling. “You mind if we stop for a bit?”
They take their time finding the perfect spot, which ends up being near the water tower where they reunited. The home starts out small, just a one-bedroom with a bath, kitchen, living room, not much bigger than most of the motel rooms Dean was so used to living out of. But it eventually included a garage for Baby, a dining area for friends and family, the living room became more of a den, and they added a second room in which they could both enjoy hobbies without cluttering the rest of the house.
After a quick stop to carefully remove his wig and change shirts, Castiel and Dean arrive at North Coeur d’Alene High School. Castiel finds it fascinating that it’s so close to the Sheriff’s station and Juvenile Detention Center. He also notices Dean’s tension increase as they pass. Ahh, he thinks he understands now. Dean needed assistance because he’s nervous being this close to so much law enforcement.
“Dean,” Castiel grates out, “You’re here.”
Jolene proceeds to test him on how to grind the beans, as well as loading and tamping the portafilter. She examines Castiel’s extraction with a critical eye, and he’s not sure if the crema is right, it seems to come out a little dark. Castiel swallows, and clamps his sweating hands behind his back as she examines the small cup of brown liquid. With a frown, she pours it down the drain.
“We’re a couple of pieces of work, huh, Cas?”
He doesn’t make it back to the bunker, and he wouldn’t have made it to Sioux Falls without the help of other hunters finding him and taking over driving. They hold the hunter’s funeral in an empty field near Sioux Falls, and nearly every hunter they know, and some they don’t, show up. Eileen is there by his side, and she’s the only thing that keeps him from collapsing as Dean’s body is consumed by the flames of the pyre.
“What? No, I, uh…” Dean ducks his head, the next part coming out muttered softly. “I don’t.”
As always, if you feel I missed a tag, please let me know!
“Um…” Dean grates out a cough. “Nothing.”
“Promise you won’t have me cast out,” the angel asks desperately.
“Castiel, I…” The angel in Sam’s body pauses, as if unsure.
Castiel give him a weak smile in return. “I’ll try, Dean.”
Ears ringing and spots dancing in front of his eyes, Castiel looks over to Dean, who is now uncovering his head from his arms, sprawled out on the floor. Carefully, Castiel cradles his injured wrist. It hurts, but he’s had worse, and Dean is his priority. Is he okay? Dean rolls onto his back and groans, Cas lets out a sigh of relief.
Eyes cast down, the angel says his name is Gadreel.
Castiel nods. “Yes.”
Dean notices and takes it for a dislike of the show itself. Disappointed that it doesn’t trigger anything for Dean, Castiel tries to explain his discomfiture without giving too much away. Dean seems to accept it, and is so incredibly considerate, that Castiel can’t help a small smile. They continue watching the episode, with Dean falling asleep soon after.
Oh shit, oh no.
He thinks. “Dean? Hello. It’s Cas.” This is awkward. “Sam said you wanted to see me? Well, I’m here. When you wake up.”
Friday night they all go out to celebrate surviving their first week. In all, there are eight men and four women, and they go to Wicker Park. Dean has to restrain himself from visiting the record store, and after they grab some chicken and tacos, they head to the Emporium for drinks and live music. Dude, they have pinball machines and arcade video games.
Castiel dismisses it with a shake of his head, and feels compelled to say something before Dean moves on. "Did your suits enjoy Disney World?" is the first thing that comes to mind.
“You stay out of this.” Dean points a finger at the screen.
When he had been notified of his internship with Novak Enterprises, Dean had done a little digging. Turns out the Novak family is old money, like they were rich as balls back in Europe before moving to America a couple generations ago. They’ve got their fingers in just about every pie there is, with family members in politics, medicine, law, you name it, there’s a Novak or a close relative who’s firmly seated in a position of power somewhere.
. Attached is a picture of Sam sleeping at a table, his face resting on an open book. It puts a smile on Castiel’s face.
Dean ducks his head and shoves the last of his croissant in his mouth, mumbling something while wadding up the paper. Castiel waits, curious as he sees Dean’s shoulders scrunch up near his ears. After another long sip of coffee, he says, “Figured maybe I should hang around another day, just in case? He waves his hand with the crumpled paper at Castiel. “And, you know, keep an eye on your injury.”
Once inside, Dean lets his hand drop to his side and falls in behind Cas at the top of the stairs. Awaiting at the bottom is an emotional-looking Jack, watching raptly as Cas descends. They're face to face, finally and Dean and Sam can only watch as a silent exchange takes place between the two human-but-not-humans.
Dean blinked slowly, thinking about that for a split second.
"No, but uhm, I'll be out in a bit. M-Maybe we can all watch that new show on Netflix later, uh, The Witching… or… something. And popcorn? We can make it a movie night."
Dean can't help but moan with the feeling it sends through him. Warmth and fire and goosebumps engulf him. At first the kiss is soft, uncharted territory, a test of sorts. But their mouths fit together perfectly, he realizes. He was made for this angel, and he kisses him harder. Cas doesn't pull back and he doesn't resist. He matches Dean tug for tug, nibble for nibble, and when Dean licks into Cas’ mouth, dragging his tongue across Cas’, the angel gasps and pulls Dean impossibly closer. Dean could do this forever, he
“Mmmmmayyyyybe,” he drawls.
“Ready?” he asked, eyes filled with a mixture of concern, love, and want. Dean reached up to press his palm gently to Cas’ cheek, running his fingers through his angel's hair before nodding.
“Don't,” it's Castiel who shuts him down this time with another ravaging kiss that makes the hunter grind into him, moaning. “Don't apologize,” he continues, “you're grieving.”
“Well, he’s not wrong,” the hunter says, grinning at Castiel. “Come on, angel, let’s go.”
He pats the mattress next to him.
and his eyes were wrought with another emotion Dean wasn't familiar with. The intensity in them made his mouth run dry. He'd felt something, as Castiel touched him, even through the thick fabric of the robe, he felt it. An unprecedented power, perhaps, something else that made his insides twist and his head swim. He knew then. He knew Castiel was an angel; that this was no hocus pocus shit. He didn't need any more proof of that, but he did want to know...
As he turned to stomp out of his dick-of-a-brother's room, who was probably off for a run or a kale cleanse,
“HELP ME!” he cries out before falling to his knees. “Please. Help me help
“Fine. Prove it.”
Dean rubs the back of his neck with his free hand.
in that way, but he shrugs and gives Cas the god's honest truth. “He chose you, man. He doesn't want anything to do with that ass clown, Lucifer.” The angel's wide, ocean blue eyes turn again to Jack, who is now no longer shocked at himself, but smiling instead.
Dean knows with every fiber of his being that his brother means those words; and he knows with every inch of his soul that those words are true.
shoot your ass."
All he hears in return is the sound of soft snoring. Castiel leans back, looking down at his hunter and finding his eyes closed, mouth opened slightly, chest rising and falling slowly, steadily. He looks… peaceful, happy. Castiel smiles. He pulls Dean's head back to rest under his chin, kissing the top of it again gently, savoring.
Sam approaches him, hands held up, unsure what to do. He's never seen his big brother like this. The devastation is palpable. He feels it. His eyes well up, but he sniffs and blinks them away. He loved Cas too. He's gonna miss him more than he'd like to admit too, but what Cas and Dean had, he knows was special. He's known that for years, he was always just waiting for some sort of revelation between the two of them. A revelation that never came.
He lets go of his own cock and focuses on Cas, doubling down, fingering the delicate flesh between his ass cheeks. Cas moans Dean's name, thrusting erratically, his face buried in the curve of Dean's neck.
Another tear escapes his traitorous fucking eyes.
“I want inside you, Dean.”
decided to throw a tantrum! But hey, let's worry more about my
- as Dean would say it - his way out of the confines of this cab, and give Dean what he wants.
Castiel smiled, looking at Dean as if he was a frightened child. “I promise, Dean.”
“Yeah, right,” Dean scoffs again.
Castiel raised his chin, a little more confident than he'd been. “Because I'm your friend. I'm… your angel, Dean.”
“Now I'll ask one more time. Who. The
Billie's voice is strange, sing-song, and not at all like Billie. Dean feels his stomach turn as he watches the terror creep across his angel's face.
Godforsaken. Now there's a funny word. Meaning God's forgotten. God's exited stage-fucking-left. But he hasn't, and Dean knows it. Sam's wrong; Dean just doesn't have the energy to fight him on this. Hel no, Chuck's still around. Playing them like fucking chess pieces. Probably popped himself a jumbo sized tub of popcorn, drinking mimosas or something equally douchey, and moving them around the black & white checkered board like the pawns that they are.
Thank you for reading!
"Yeah, man, I'm fine. Listen, Cas—" He swallows, tongue suddenly too thick in his mouth. There is a lot he wants to say. There is a lot he doesn't want to say, but probably should anyway, starting with
"Well, I wouldn't call us a thing, but—" Cas gives a loose shrug, a hard-edged smile. Like everything else in the last two days, it makes Dean's head spin. Cas doesn't seem to notice, too busy packing loaded magazines into his duffle bag. He counts some invisible checklist on his fingers one last time before zipping it shut and dropping it on the floor.
Thanks for reading!
"Man, you and your rabbit food—" Dean's train of thought ends with the click of the door and the crack of Sam slamming his phone down on the table. "The hell's wrong with you?"
He could admit, in his drunkest moments, to imagining kissing Cas. He's thought about it in a vindictive sort of way— riling Cas up, wiping the angelic scowl off his face. The fantasy usually ends with Cas amusingly stunned to silence or, if Dean is feeling a special amount of self-loathing, disgusted to learn Dean could see him that way.
Dean is back from 2014, but knowing the future is as haunting as knowing the past.
"Got it. So this was—"
"Survivor's camp. Bobby wasn't around anymore, and I guess I took over." A dry laugh bubbles up before he can think to stop it. "I was about the leader you'd expect."
"It was the best thing I could think of. That other me—"
"Of Cas." Sam looks it over again, like it might have changed since he last looked. "With a gun. You put it in Dad's journal." His gaze drifts back to Dean, and Dean physically feels it even though he does his best not to acknowledge it. It's Sam's bone-deep stare for when he has a puzzle in front of him and can almost make out the big picture if only he weren't missing half the pieces; apparently he thinks he can will a few more pieces out of Dean if he stares hard enough.
"I called Cas."
He straightens up, jaw set, and for a moment Dean expects him to call the bluff— Dean would never actually waste food if he can help it— but then he huffs and drops back into his chair with a sullen
"It's 2014, Dean. No one cares about your sexuality— mainly because anyone who would is dead or busy fighting for their lives, but the point stands." With that, he wanders to sit on the dingy bed across the room and takes a swig from the nearest bottle before holding it out in invitation. Dean's stomach is rolling a little at the vacant look settled on him, but he accepts the bottle and sinks down beside Cas anyway. The bitter burn of cheap absinthe rolling down his throat is about what he expects, but beggars can't be choosers, so Dean grimaces and swallows another mouthful. Beside him, Cas makes an amused sound around the joint between his lips and flicks open a lighter. It takes a few more drinks for Dean to dredge up the nerve to finally watch him take a long drag and slowly let the smoke trickle back into the room. Cas' eyes are on him the whole time, might have been since Dean gave in and sat down, something twinkling in the spreading blackness of his pupils. He must have taken something else when Dean wasn't looking, because they weren't that wide during the meeting. "Haven't seen you make that face in years."
"Yeah, 'cause I'm not a cow. Doesn't mean I'll give it to you."
"Dude, it's ten in the morning."
Dean rolls his eyes but obeys. The bottle is barely away from his lips before Cas curls his fingers over Dean's, guiding the bottle to his own mouth. His throat bobs, and Dean shivers at the familiar softness finally rolling down his limbs, liquid warmth in his veins. Cas lets go with a sigh, and then his eyes are level with Dean's, nothing but a ring of blue around solid black. Dean is about to flinch back until the hand around his slides up to his cheek. Cas still looks unsettlingly dazed, but something familiar is filling the hollowness that peers out when he smiles.
Sam looks almost offended, but he keeps his mouth shut and carefully returns the photo to its place in the journal. When he speaks again, it's too casual to be anything but completely loaded. "You, uh, talk to Cas about this?"
He has to wet his lips to unstick them enough to speak again. "Cas, whatever happens, don't let me—"
Sam drops onto the bed opposite Dean with a thoughtful look. Another piece of that puzzle must slot into place, because finally he searches Dean's face and asks "Where was I in this future?" Dean opens his mouth only to close it again, looks around the room for good measure until Sam presses again. "Dean."
I do have two more chapters more or less completed, and at least a vague concept for the resolution for '09 Dean and Castiel, so I hope you'll stick around to read the rest.
"Wait, so you and me, we're—" He gestures between them and clears his throat, not quite ready to ask that question.
Dean makes a sour face. "No, why?"
"Hey Dean, what's this?"
This one was short, just a bit of a bridge between events, but the next chapter will be longer again.
"Dean, are you alright? You were praying."
Cas must see him bristling and mistake it for offense, because he laughs rudely and finally says "Take another drink and I'll tell you."
"You said yes, Sam. You said yes to Lucifer, and Bobby and Cas and I— the world just went to hell, man."
Almost done now. I tried to let this one be a little more light-hearted, so I hope you guys enjoyed it.
With the neon buzzing overhead and crickets singing across the parking lot, it's easier to breath, if only a little. Five years in the future, the air is filled with such oppressive silence that it's a tangible weight on Dean's eardrums. 2014 presses insistently, dragging like roadkill until Dean morbidly can't help but to look at it. He swears softly and rubs at his eyes until he sees stars instead of his own face, begging him to say yes to Michael. Like the idiot they both knew him to be, he said no, again. It's no wonder he becomes such a hateful person— he's halfway there already, risking his brother, Cas, and the whole world on a long-shot bid to save himself from being an angel puppet.
The buzzing is worse than a clock ticking the seconds by. Cas must see through him, must hear the quiver rattling in his voice, but finally all he says is "Of course, Dean."
Hell is coming fast.
"Gonna get a drink."
"I don't know, Dean." He shrugs half-heartedly and busies himself with pulling out his laptop, as subtle as any giant with Farrah Fawcett hair can be. "Kinda seems like it involves him. I mean, you said he lost his grace when the angels left, right? That's important information for him." The pointed look from over his laptop screen is the last straw. Dean jerks up from the bed, tugs on his jacket, and heads for the door. "Where are you going?"
For once, Dean doesn't dream of Hell. In the nights following his trip to Camp Chitaqua, all he sees is the world falling apart around him. Sam grins at him with bloody teeth, eyes flashing red to the splintering
"You look like you care what happens."
of bone. Dean unloads bullets into his friends one by one, and always there are glassy blue eyes following him. He plants one more bullet right between them. He doesn't even care when Castiel drops.
"Cas—" Dean jerks awake in a lumpy bed and barely cuts himself off from calling out a second time. He's sweating; he wipes an arm across his forehead and peels the sheets back to free his legs. Sam is still sprawled across the other bed, snoring lightly. The room is unnervingly red under the light of the motel sign, but it's clean at least. The window is unbroken, furniture all in place. They're nowhere near Camp Chitaqua. Dean swings his feet to the floor and tugs on some pants, and Sam stirs and blinks awake. He must be well past exhaustion, because he doesn't sit up, just mumbles an incoherent question. "Just getting some air." Dean keeps his voice low and pats somewhere around Sam's feet on the way to the door. "Get some more sleep, Sammy." The only answer he gets is a vague hum and then even breathing. Height aside, Sam still looks like the little brother who wouldn't sleep unless Dean tucked him in and lay down next to him. He needed Dean next to him, and now Dean's seen what they're both like without the other. He stops to watch the blankets rise and fall a few times before slipping outside and letting the door click shut behind him.
"What are you, twelve? Just give me my salad." He stands from the table, and Dean backs away and pulls out the salad, hands poised to open the container.
, he had said, and Dean hated him in that moment. He hates him now. Cas had been good and sure for longer than the Earth had been spinning, but Dean swept in with his arrogance and his selfishness and broke that down in just seven years.
It's nostalgia, Dean realizes with a strange horror. Cas is looking at him with the same wistful longing he feels seeing pictures of his mother. He has a sudden, crushing urge to run, the sensation of something rattling apart behind his ribcage, trying to shake him out of his own body. The bottle knocks to the floor and spills, but Dean can't feel bad about it, too busy wondering how to break out of this ridiculous funhouse he's trapped in. He doesn't realize he's pacing until Cas' hand on his chest stops him in his tracks. Dean wants to laugh when Cas offers him the joint with a raised brow, but he's pretty sure it would come out too hysterical to brush off after. He shakes his head and takes an unsteady breath; that must be the answer Cas wants, because his lips twitch in a ghost of a smile and he quickly retracts the offer. His hand curls around to Dean's side, running light and soothing over his ribs. Dean finds himself leaning into it, lets himself tilt towards Cas when his hand moves up to Dean's cheek. Cas keeps drifting closer, eyes not moving from Dean's even when he briefly presses their mouths together. It's not quite the same— this Cas' eyes are too unfocused and glazed over— but there's an approximation of the intensity Dean is used to in his stare. When Cas pulls back he chases before he can really remember why he shouldn't, and Cas grins, exhales hotly against his lips. Then Cas is surging forward and Dean catches him, still reeling. He can't even taste Cas under the gritty bitterness of booze and pills, just feels the warm slide of lips and tongue when he opens his mouth.
"I what?" His voice is dropping dangerously low, and Dean isn't ready for another explosion, not when they're only just coming back together again. That doesn't make the truth choke him any less on its way out.
Of the two of them, he never would have expected Cas to be the impatient one. Yet when they push and pull each other back to the bed, barely pulling apart to strip clothes away, Dean is the one to hush Cas' grunted complaints, to slow down the press of hands and lips in some hopeful attempt to make something of nothing. He almost regrets the effort when Cas matches his pace, because having those eyes focused on him really is like pressing on a bruise. Some nagging, ugly part of him is morbidly satisfied, but at what cost? Then Cas' fingertips are tracing Dean's face like he could memorize it, and he's smiling with a warmth Dean's never seen on him, and it's the first thing in the future that doesn't feel like a sick parody. Dean catches his hand, presses a kiss to the palm. Even with his insides dug out and raw, the sour taste of his own sins catching in his throat, any cost is worth it.
"What face?" He tries to sound irritated, but his throat is dry and the words come out a croak. Cas doesn't dignify the attempt with an answer, just lets a cheshire grin split his face as his head tips back. There's a challenge in the bare line of his throat— Dean knows it, and hates how it makes him feel like a kid, uncertain and at the mercy of someone else's whims. Dean wants to ask
Judging from the raised eyebrows, Sam isn't buying dumb this time. "This picture." He flips it over so the black and white figures stare Dean in the face, unsmiling expressions that shouldn't be as familiar as they are.
In the dark his phone jingle is piercing enough to make him jump and glance back at the door, half-expecting Sam to wake up to come find him. It's just him, though, and now Cas according to caller ID.
“Do you want me to pretend it never happened?” Castiel said quietly.
He wasn’t.
“A minor inconvenience.”
“What?” Dean said with irritation.
“Dean, are you making me the accountant of our disagreements by deliberately lying in the retelling?”
“There’s shit in the basement, too,” Dean added after a second.
“I probably won’t last a minute.”
“So are you trying to date now?” Dean asked.
Dean’s alarm was stark. “Jesus, is he in there
“The most fun with,” Dean said, laser-focused on a compliment to his performance.
, I know what it’s like to be spied on from the inside out.” Dean rolled his eyes at the continued stone face, and got closer. “Spit it out.” He put his other hand on Castiel’s shoulder.
“You’re fired,” Dean said. “But I’ll rehire you when this conversation is over.”
He fully expected Dean to be at work; most mornings he was on the job site by a quarter to seven.
little brannigan and now you’re setting me up for the next one.”
Castiel sat back and folded his arms.
“Vessel trouble.”
E XXX cellent point.
After five minutes a big black muscle car rumbled into the driveway, and Dean got out.
“My brother.”
“You usually don’t take this long to get to your point; I certainly can’t argue it, though,” Castiel said, and by this unwittingly saved himself the trouble of bandaging Dean’s hand after he tried to punch him hard in the face.
Dean had touched him and it was wonderful. He was trying not to act giddy about what Dean had come home to and what he’d done.
“What the fuck are you doing here?” Dean asked. That was when Castiel realized he’d been weeping.
Dean looked around. There was a sign they could hide behind, for what he had in mind.
The elevator door opened. Dean led the way, and they sat down in the coffee shop closest to Dr. Barnes’ office.
Castiel smiled. It was a slow smile, a knowing one. “You want to do it again?”
“I can’t pay more than fifteen bucks an hour, I don’t care how you dress as long as you’n your clothes’re clean, and as long as you honestly record your hours I don’t care when you work.”
He rose up from the couch, naked but for briefs, gaping at Castiel.
if we hypothetically had a child I’d quit hunting, at least until the kid was all trained up.”
“You’re a very nice guy in real life but you
“I’m running away from home,” Castiel said, with cutting sarcasm.
“Winchester!” he said.
“So, a weeks’ vacation then,” Castiel said.
Dean’s stupefaction was so palpable it wasn’t funny.
“Dean, that was possibly the most disgusting thing I’ve ever done,” Castiel said in a pleading voice. “Why are you treating it like an accomplishment?”
depends,” Dean assured him.
prissy, he might as well own it.
Castiel couldn’t believe it. Dean had been snarly with him after his first night of sex with him (shrugging? like one of the most important things that had ever happened to him was something trivial?) and now he was acting hurt that Castiel had decided not to hang around for what might prove to be further abuse. He considered what to say.
“I’m a construction site supervisor,” Dean offered. “What do you normally do for a living?”
“That
“I thought you already did that.”
“Do you want me to leave,” Castiel said flatly.
“Are you a virgin because you’re really asexual?”
After five minutes the therapist appeared.
“Winchester, I — I —“ and he staggered to sit at Dean’s desk. Dean slowly sat next to Castiel, on his bed.
Castiel gasped. “No,” he managed to breathe.
Sam shuddered at the masturbation reference and said, “Were they hoping to spy on you and Castiel… like, making out or something?”
“Oh yes you were,” Castiel said with a reminiscent smile. “Although it was mostly guttural grunts, low moans, and saying my name like you were either praying or scared of forgetting it at a critical juncture.”
“I need a proper OSHA dust mask and eye protection, your permission to recycle as much as I can, and a dumpster.”
“That seems an unduly Byzantine way to deal with your interest in my sex life,” Castiel said, almost dropping his bowl of chili as he whipped around.
“Jesus, Cas, you sound like you were raised in a cave!”
“Really,” Dean said. “I’m not complaining.”
long I wonder. Next time I lick my fingers, it’ll all be for you Naomi.”
“What,” Dean said. Castiel was staring at something little in his hand.
Castiel blinked. He had a nickname, already? At least it wasn’t ‘Cassie’, his dreadful family teasing name from childhood.
“Dean,” Castiel said, almost helplessly. “I want to take care of you.”
“Fuck, Rowena would have to come up with something awesome,” Dean said. “It never occurred to me to play that angle. God, it’d be the hunter event of the decade.”
“What was what?” Castiel said.
“I’m thirty-five now, and I was twenty-two - so almost fifteen years. I tried to find him to tell him I was getting married, and I tried again after Jasmine was born, you know, because hey, he had a niece, and for all I know I could have a shopping cart full of nieces and nephews by now, but I’ve heard nothing. It’s like he fell off the face of the earth - the only connection we have is through his bank account.”
Castiel remained silent. He was no longer afraid to be silent. His social anxiety had framed his silence as incompetence; with a few simple words, Dean had framed his silence as choice.
“You do,” Dean said, and the softness in his voice was all he needed to hear.
Waiting room
“Kind and hard-working and funny and smart,” Castiel said.
Men didn’t walk up to their bosses and say, “I’m in love with you, you are the perfect human being, and you are even so perfect that you have an imperfection which you think I can help fix and I’m not even going to think beyond the end of this job so I’m just going to enjoy this.”
“Okay, so what are you going to do about it?”
“Sam?”
“I’m very sorry, but my parents have been in a car accident and I’m going to have to cancel both of your appointments to get to the hospital.”
“I like men, too” Dean said flatly.
“You keep talking about Charlie.”
And Dean had said, “Stay. You have revealed that I have a sofa now. I even have bedding.”
“Touching our lips together felt very pleasant,” Castiel said.
done,” Dean said with that lazy smirk which Castiel alternately loved and hated.
“I’m not so sure I want to offer it any more. It’s pretty bad.”
Castiel felt like he’d been punched.
“Now I am seriously intrigued, given that I met you in my therapist’s office.”
“My vessel — my vessel,” Castiel gasped. After a few shuddering breaths he seemed to master himself.
“It’s a classic comedy action thriller,” Dean said.
“You make a choice to talk, or you make a choice to be quiet. When you choose to be quiet you’re letting other people talk. Unlike Charlie.”
“She’ll fuckin’ kill me,” he muttered, and texted someone.
“I changed my name when I came out,” the dark haired man said.
He came in, looked at the book and the ‘crystal’ ball and burst into tears.
After a few minutes, Castiel sighed deeply and pulled away. “I’m not doing this right,” he said sadly.
He knocked on the door and there was no answer.
“The problem?” Castiel asked. “You said it was a job.”
“Are the boxes labelled properly?”
Dean frowned. “Okay, that’s straight up gross. So, if I may fill in blanks, you quit, came out and now the world’s a scary place.”
“Why do you want us to touch tongues?” Castiel asked. “I must seem controlling or prudish to you.”
Dean did keep good coffee in the house. He’d even started buying cream. He teased Castiel about that, too. He teased Castiel at every opportunity. Sometimes it hurt; mostly it made Castiel feel as if someone was paying attention to him who wasn’t getting paid to.
“You are a vast multidimensional being,” he intoned, “Who is jammed into a body which EXCUSE ME the Jimmy in this timeline HAS NO BUSINESS to be in, and thanks to our fine feathered fuck-nuts in Heaven, gallows’ed be their name, and this means YOU Naomi since you’re probably watching, you goddamned HAG, you, Castiel, are having to cope with human feelings and emotions when you would prefer not to!”
been sleeping. I was having a dream, or maybe a nightmare, and the next thing I knew Jimmy was in my head talking to me.”
“I’m not ashamed to admit it, Dean. I want to feel an attachment to the man and to feel safe. It’s very easy for me to misinterpret things, so I would need to take it very slow. Maybe you’re okay with me having casual sex, but I would find it very alienating to try to have sex with somebody when I was worried or scared.”
“Don’t trust me, hunh? S’pose I earned that.”
Castiel’s alarm went off at 8:00. He ate breakfast and showered if he needed to and was on the bus by 9:00, arriving by 10:00. Dean was at work, so Castiel had most of the working day to himself. He texted Dean every two hours (he was ‘scared Cas might get dominoed to death by moving boxes’, as he put it) with a couple of words, ‘All OK’, and then Dean got home around 4:30, sometimes earlier, and the two of them would work on sorting and tossing what he’d worked on that day.
“And now he just plain rolls up and owns me. Don’t use that mean voice on me, I don’t like it,” Dean said. He was serious.
“I dunno, Dean, we got, like, a dozen people here for dinner.”
“He was perfectly civil. My feelings weren’t hurt, and I was glad he was honest. He did tell me he found me attractive.” Dean smiled briefly then, and Castiel didn’t know what to make of that.
“What the fuck d’ja mean by that?” Dean said, all injured innocence.
“He did something for Naomi so he could keep an eye on Claire.”
“Now are you gonna clean this shit up?” Dean asks with a Cheshire cat grin.
“I don't have to shoot to kill you, Sam.”
It's been three days.
look at Dean. He looks defeated.
the person he cares about the most. He’s been in touch with her since she left. By the way,” she grins, “please give him my blessing on Eileen. I adore that girl.” Dean grits his teeth in response and gives her a fake smile, one that she recognizes immediately. “Come on, Dean. Cas is still here with you. You just need to talk to him.”
The ride back to the bunker is quiet, save for the soft sounds of the mixtape Dean's no longer saddened to play. That's not quite true, though. It triggers feelings Dean simply can't deny. Some feelings he
He knows Dean was angry. He
“Close your eyes, Dean.”
“What are you--”
"I do know, you unbelievably stubborn…" Cas doesn't continue his insult.
There's almost a breakthrough on the second night. Castiel finds Dean in the library, quietly reading through an old text. The picture on the page he's reading, Castiel recognizes as the biblical illustration of a nephilim. Dean glances in his direction, his expression pensive, but continues reading, and the angel takes a chance.
“When we were in Purgatory, I-- I thought I lost him again.” He sighs. Mary looks a little perplexed about Purgatory, but she allows him to continue. She knew that Cas had died while she was stuck in Apocalypse World, but only by way of sarcastic remarks about ‘the dude who came back from the dead...again’ from Dean here and there. She never could've known what it did to him when Cas was murdered in front of his own eyes. “So I prayed to him.” Mary sits on the bed next to him as he speaks, as he recalls the way he treated his angel after she… and after Jack. “I was so angry when you died, I took everything out on him. I told him I wanted to kill the kid,” he winces as he says that, “because he killed you… a-and I know my saying that almost killed him. I told him he was dead to me…”
After his work day, during which he continued to send texts a couple of times a day to indicate that he was okay, Dean would come home, and he’d always offer dinner, and these days Castiel would always decline. He wasn’t getting paid to hang around with Dean, after all. There wasn’t any point trying to get to know him better since he was the kind of guy who shrugged when you asked if more sex was going to happen. Like he didn’t care one way or the other.
Dean was not polite in his disbelief. “You’re forty and you’re not emotionally ready to have sex.”
“I can’t even work right now,” Castiel said. He probably shouldn’t have said it. People made judgments. If he started to work somewhere on the books his family would find him, but this nice man didn’t need to know that.
“Dean, you could never be a monster to me, because I only see you the way you are now.”
“Because he was poor. She couldn’t ignore him because she thought people would talk, but she made sure he knew of his status every day. I used to take food from catered events for him — Gabe and Inias did too, although Gabe usually ended up eating them himself before handing them over — and then my mother caught me and that with my being unsure of my sexuality got me sent me to a very expensive Christian sanitarium.”
“A cave so dark I was thirty-eight when I came out.” Castiel rose to get seconds.
“I wasn’t yelling,” Dean said primly.
Castiel decided to be a little more like Dean. He moved toward him and tapped him on the shoulder with a gentle fist and said, with what he hoped was a jaunty air, “Because you’re paying me, Dean,” and Dean slowly smiled back.
“I don’t know.”
Dean was probably one of those guys who just didn’t get romantic feelings for other men, just for women. And it wasn’t even romantic feelings Castiel necessarily longed for, just being affectionate. Castiel could feel himself tearing up. Well, he’d had sex. Maybe he could find his own way to some more of it; it’s not like Kansas City didn’t have gay bars.
“Dean,” he said, sticking out his hand across the table.
since when?
“We had something to sort out, and we did,” he added. “We’re together, come what may, but we already knew that, right? Is there any dessert? or did Castiel forget pie - again.”
“I got the four hundred dollar dumpster, holds six pickup truck loads.”
Castiel took that comment apart, and blew Dean’s mind, before he made him see red. Again. “With sufficiently powerful magic, and presumably Rowena’s help, we could probably overcome that, but no, I don’t think I want to go to all that trouble when you’ll just drink too much and abandon the child.”
“Can Castiel hear what you’re saying?” Dean asked after recovering. There was a nod. Jimmy’s expression was so much more open and mobile. It freaked Dean out, whenever he even thought about someone else in there, in Castiel’s body. In reality, it was far, far worse.
“I’m a wreck. I thought these steps I took would make me feel better but without the structure of work I’m just wandering around like a lost sheep — and I’ll run out of money soon.” Castiel shrugged helplessly.
Dean decided to react to this news by teasing Castiel. He tried to think of something really noxious.
Castiel moved like lightning to other side of the room and started pawing at the mirror on the wall.
Just as he got on the bus Dean texted him.
Castiel just shrugged. “I don’t think this conversation is useful any more,” he said, and got ready to leave.
“If I asked you, would you give me a list of approved sexual activities?”
It was all in a single house. He could clean out a house. He tried to sound professional.
threatening you,” Dean confirmed. Castiel had mopped off his face and now he blew his nose.
“In terms of picking a movie or in terms of losing my virginity?”
“Will you tell me?”
“You know my relatives are slum landlords. That’s a bit of a slur, since they own nice properties too. A while back, when I was thinking about leaving the family business, I thought of a way to give myself free accommodations at their expense, which, considering that apart from about a hundred thousand dollars in cash, gifts and bonuses, plus paying for my education, I’ve never received a dime for the work I did for almost twenty years.”
Solemnly, Castiel said, “I’m honored by your trust.”
Castiel had the clipboard in his hand.
“Cas!” he sang out. “You made it.”
He turned off his phone.
Castiel looked at the ground. He did that when he did not want to deal with what was coming next.
“I’m still Dean,” Dean said.
Dean was a very thoughtful man, considerate of others. He made it look easy. Castiel studied that, trying to learn how he did it. He shivered, drank his coffee, and forced himself to look at the box again.
“Yeah.”
“What do you mean by ‘pretty bad’?”
“I know how to drive,” Castiel said, nettled. “I didn’t get a license.”
It wouldn’t do to look
Dean took that as a yes. “Do you want to come look at a temporary job at my, um, office?”
It all started in a waiting room, but Castiel didn’t have to wait now. “Dean,” he purred. “I have an idea.” He lay back down and pulled Dean into his arms.
“If you like,” Castiel said. “I’m okay taking the bus home otherwise,” he added.
“That sounds like a remarkably relaxed office.”
“I have a feeling that you’re full of good advice,” Castiel said.
“Dean, we made love, which is how it felt to me, and we had sex, which is how it felt to you, I guess, and the next morning you were very cold to me, and I realized that no matter what I do or say you’re not going to live openly with your sexuality — that you like having sex with men and women .”
There was a long pause.
Castiel was. Even though he was meaner, sometimes, than the old Cas. It pissed him off and it made him wish God or whoever would just give him a mulligan on the old one, especially when this Castiel rubbed his feet after a hunt and all he could think about was how much better it would feel if
“What?” Dean said, this time more slowly. “I asked you to stay. I’m not yanking your dinner invite. Siddown, shaddap, and eat.”
“Something wrong?”
“So, Jimmy, what’s up.” Dean’s expression gave nothing away.
Dean popped the door open, and Sam said, “Yeah, a few more people than I was expecting, but they’re all hunters.”
“You’re really used to being ordered around,” Dean said.
“I really don’t think I would feel comfortable watching porn on a big screen in my boss’s house,” Castiel said. “And that sounds even worse after I said it aloud.”
asexual, so yeah, I made myself blush,” Castiel snapped.
, and you’d totally double-never-do-that at your boss’s
“I’ll get going on renting the dumpster, then,” Dean said. He instantly seemed more cheerful and energetic.
“I was forced to work in the family business,” Castiel said. “Essentially all my close relatives are slum landlords and looked to me for ways to screw their tenants, their suppliers and the government ever more effectively.”
Castiel choked and exhaled. The cornbread described an unfortunate arc from Castiel’s mouth into Dean’s bowl. After a moment of pure and mutual horror, Dean burst into hoots of laughter and, almost unable to speak, managed, “I’ll take that as a yes.”
After watching the bug disappear in a blast of enraged angel, he pulled on Castiel’s arm and forced a kiss on him. To his astonishment, Castiel opened his mouth and passed a little humming ball of grace onto Dean’s tongue.
“Castiel and I took care of our end,” Dean said, shrugging again. “And Jimmy stiffed Naomi on the deal, and there’s nothing she can do about it. Jimmy played her, just to be able to talk to us about our sex lives.”
Dean jumped up and said, “Take that back.”
Unfortunately there was only one other place he knew of that he had a key to, since Gabe hadn’t given him the key for the new place yet, so now he had to go back to Dean’s to hole up for the day to try to reach Gabe to figure out his next move.
“Do you cry yourself to sleep every night?”
“If you want to watch porn, just say so, I got the screen set up.”
Castiel’s back stiffened. “I thought you mostly did it in the shower,” he said, screwing up his face almost, but not like, how Cas used to do it. What kind of man yells at his best friend, “You screw your face up wrong! Get it right, goddamn you,” — who knew? it wasn’t Dean.
Castiel was not amused by the smugness of his expression, and Dean didn’t care. “I’d be flattered, but your feelings are natural. I’m a Winchester boy, and between us we pretty much got the sexy times covered.”
“Do you think I’d be stalking you, or something?” Dean said, obviously upset.
“Well,” Castiel responded, in a ‘buck-up’ tone of voice, “Are you willing to let me just do the best I can? I promise I won’t throw out anything without your permission — the first thing I’ll do is clear out a staging area so you can approve stuff moving out.”
He couldn’t have been more considerate and volcanically sexy and sweet if Castiel had planned it, and he made Castiel feel that way too. He dressed, sighing that he had to get back into dirty clothes, and went out to the kitchen with stars in his eyes.
He passed it back, not too fast, since he didn’t want to look like a complete rube and drop the son of a bitch, and Castiel said, “Don’t you like it?” His teeth lit up and Dean started chuckling, it was like Cas was carrying Chuck’s cosmic intent around in his mouth like a teeny weeny disco ball and then he laughed aloud, it was so ludicrous a thought.
“And you don’t want me to know where you live ‘cause you think I’ll run off to mommy and squeal on you?” Dean asked, his disgust and astonishment crystal clear.
“Most men I know would rather die than show emotion. I think they have a problem, not you,” Castiel said, trying to sound reasonable. “I’m going to make you a cup of hot cocoa and you can sit down on your newly rediscovered sofa and explain it all.”
He tried to be an atheist, in keeping with his new way of thought as a scientifically open and reasonable person, but it was hard to give up on God. In his darkest hours he had believed he had heard a voice, always calm and clear and loving, and it had helped immeasurably when he’d felt lost and beyond himself, beyond saving, beyond ever being loved by another human being. It was hard to abandon God, thinking of that feeling of always being thrown a strand of hope to pull himself back with.
“Hoo boy!” Dean said. He fell back, and then stayed connected with a hand to the shoulder, not wanting to be left behind if Castiel got shifty again.
“I can’t tell you where I’m living because I’m committing fraud.”
“She’s recommended some group settings.”
“He doesn’t really understand that our relationship is one of close and affectionate siblings,” Castiel said.
“Having your pick of sexual partners does not make you a good person.” Castiel sure sounded prim. He pulled away.
Dean shrugged.
Castiel came into his room with the sound of flexing wings, big ones. Dean never tired of it, but he didn’t have time to smile, because he was used to a knock at his door, and also since Castiel’s face was wet with tears.
. They were back in the bunker, in Dean’s room. Dean let go of Castiel until the spins from etheric plane travel stopped, and then Castiel gently moved closer and took Dean’s face in his and looked at him from about six inches away.
“I almost want you to clear it all out without me looking.”
Castiel tried to remember the conversation. How had Dean shown that he was a good person? How could anyone not be charmed by him? He’d responded to bluntness with humour, or misdirection or something that was almost, but not quite, flirtation. Castiel had a sense of engagement with Dean he didn’t feel with other people.
Dean tried to stay on task. He was pretending he didn’t have an erection by standing utterly still. “We have to make a space they can’t spy into.”
“I’m the boring one in this conversation,” Castiel said with just enough exaggerated flatness in his voice to get Dean’s attention.
Castiel sat up, leaned forward, and kissed Dean. It was wrong, and stupid and short-sighted and ill-advised, but there was no way he would miss finding out what those plushly upholstered lips tasted like.
“I can’t impregnate you with a nephilim, if that’s what you’re worried about.”
“Oh,” Castiel said at one point. “That’s where that expression came from,” and Dean grinned. He told the story about how the stunt people had lied to Alan Rickman, which was why you got that genuinely terrified look on his face as Gruber fell, and Castiel admitted that it was a very entertaining movie.
“Stuck,” the dark haired man supplied after his new acquaintance trailed off.
“Yeah. Naomi and Jimmy pranked him and got him all confused. Also, we gotta take the fucking bunker apart for bugs, since those stinkin’ angels think spying on us is so fucking great.”
“So are you a bottom?” Dean asked casually, and reached for the hot sauce.
“No, whether I’m fired or not, it’s a privacy and comfort issue,” Castiel said, squirming visibly.
I’m just barely able to comprehend the whole
“Dean, I thought we covered why I don’t want to have sex with you.”
“You don’t want to shake hands,” Dean said.
“Because you’ll complain if someone else does,” Castiel said, suddenly standing next to him. “I’ll come help find food for everyone else.” In the end, he flew into town for an immense block of cheese and a bag of macaroni, and greens, and under Dean’s supervision, he made mac'n'cheese and an immense salad in the biggest bowl they had. It seemed weird that there were vegetarian hunters now; a couple of people thanked Dean for making a non-meat entrée.
With an exhalation that might almost have been a laugh, Pam shook her head.
“Less so now,” he said, and that was enough to make Castiel glow a little inside, feeling useful, feeling like he was making a connection with another human being.
“Can he hear me talking?” Another nod.
“Sure. And if you hang around with me for any length of time you will completely lose the ability to overthink things because I kinda run straight at shit.” Dean rose. “I’m going to go sit in my car and make phone calls, since I think it would be kinda rude to make them in here.”
“I’ll never forget that as long as I live, man,” Dean said, and that smirk peeped out. “Like a fuckin’ champagne cork across the table.”
“After Jasmine and Judi died,” Dean muttered. “But I had help. Within a six month period my dad and my stepdad died and I ended up with all this junk cause I was too stupid to pay for a storage space, and then when Judi died her parents downsized and they gave me all the stuff from her old room, and I couldn’t say no.”
“Second off, you can boss me around any time.”
“I got a lot of very regressive therapy and kissed another boy. I would have been 17 at the time. We both told each other we were experimenting to rebel against our terrible families but I often wonder what happened to him. He has no social media presence.”
Dean looked at his brother and his fond, loopy grin came out. “I tell you what. If you ever hear Castiel call me ‘Dean’, he’s either been vessel-jacked or we’ve —”
Castiel was glaring.
“What would you like me to do first?”
“Sounds like you’re trying to write a plentyofish profile for me,” Dean said. He was hoarse, and he sniffed. Castiel offered him a clean and perfectly folded handkerchief from the pocket of his hoodie.
table in front of your
“Buckets and buckets of it,” Dean said with a faint laugh.
He’d worked steadily that day; his knees were whining about the basement stairs, he’d stuck himself in the palm of his hand — twice — with one of Bobby’s knives (the collection was immense) and felt that little chill that there was satanic activity afoot and he should be wary because here he was shedding blood in Dean’s house, but the only consequence had been that Dean had gone full Florence Nightingale and dragged him over to the kitchen counter to assess his two ludicrous cuts with a special magnifying glass and bandages and various salves, compounds and solutions.
“So what was it?”
, deciding to let his inner teenager out; he lay face down on his bed reading an omnibus Batman comic his nerd brother had seen fit to steal for him for Christmas.
“Fart.”
“This is going to take —”
“So you’re stealing an apartment?” Dean looked puzzled.
“Is it pornography?” Castiel said, taken aback. “It sounds like pornography.”
Castiel phoned Dean at noon, having stewed all morning about the propriety of working for someone he’d met at his therapist’s office. Truth be told, the degree of challenge it would be to work for someone as handsome as Dean also took a toll on his fevered misgivings. As he could have gloomily predicted, he was in general overthinking a God-sent gift.
The last Apocalypse had been averted thanks to sweetly timed and epically badass team play from the elite squad, including Castiel. He’d flown off — like he always did after a hunt — wouldn’t even hang around for a drink — but if Dean stayed quiet Castiel would return soon, with his same ol’ crinkle-faced confusion and the same dark’n’snarky humor he always handed out, when he bothered to even try to be funny.
“Somebody should teach you how to drive.”
“I overthink it,” the dark haired man said, and shook hands. He had nothing to be embarrassed about. It wasn’t as if he was sticky, or anything.
“I don’t ‘dog’ work,” Castiel said almost grimly. There were air quotes in there, and along with the grim expression the precise finger movements almost made Dean laugh, but he did not.
“I will.”
He wanted to believe Dean’s appearance in his life was a gift. Maybe it wasn’t wise to ascribe too much of it to God. Dean had asked him to coffee, taken an interest in him.
Over the next few weeks, they got into a routine. Castiel told Dean straight up that the more regular a routine he had the more productive he was likely to be, and he also told him that he wasn’t a morning person. So his day started a bit late.
Castiel said, “It may not be enough.”
“What a fuckin’ a-hole,” Dean said.
Castiel was thinking of sitting in his apartment for two days, not knowing what was happening with Dean.
“Why do I have to do all the paperwork?” Dean quipped.
so fuckin’ pompous it blows my mind,” Dean said.
“What, like sexually?” Castiel breathed.
“Well, it’s in my house, so if that makes you anxious….”
“Cas — ” Dean said. He trailed off.
Castiel hadn’t looked up yet. He was either despairing or lying, and he’d entered weeping, but not blood, so who knew
the deal. This place is salted against ghosts but souls tethered to Heaven might be able to get in here if they knew what they were dealing with. And it’s something Naomi wants, so I’m ready to call bullshit.” More casually, he said, “So, is he threatening you?”
Castiel rolled onto his back and smiled. Dean was so perfect it was almost painful to look at him.
“So you knew you were gay.”
Dean allowed his mouth to drop open first, but then he flung back his head and laughed. Castiel wished his arms could extend a couple of feet and he could quickly caress Dean’s neck as he did that. He looked down at what was left of the chili.
It was packaged cornbread but it smelled tempting as he thought about Dean coming through the door to eat something he baked even if it was from a package. Dean had texted him what to do and it hadn’t been hard.
There followed a long minute, during which Castiel felt like he had completely misjudged the situation.
“Too bad, because I’m completely done. You lied to me and you’re a shitty lover with bad communication skills,” Castiel said. He knew he sounded prissy, but he
“It’s not a perfect world,” Castiel said heavily.
“Fuck you, Castiel,” Dean said.
It didn’t matter if they were killing things, cooking, sleeping, driving. Everything was better when they were together, Dean thought, shoulder to shoulder with his best friend in the whole world.
“I can sleep through almost anything,” Castiel said. Dean made him cocoa and Castiel sighed internally as Dean’s fingers brushed his, passing it across to him.
“No,” Castiel said. “and I just don’t understand what you’re getting out of it.”
“You were watching from Heaven.”
They weren’t tears of blood, though, so not angelic.
“You didn’t call me boring, you called my interests boring, and I agreed, as I recollect. However, knowing by heart the anatomical differences between every native bee species in the state is an accomplishment of some note, and I am occasionally called upon to assist in matters of identification.”
Dean laughed and sat down on the bed. “‘Cept of course you can. Indefinitely. You could punch me in the face — uh, please don’t! — and fly off and I’d forgive you. And I’d still want to kiss you. But I’d also be okay if you told me that wasn’t going to happen again because my molecules taste funny.”
“That is
“I haven’t watched many cartoons,” Castiel said. “May I please have seconds?”
“Okay. Dean took out his business card and said, “Give me a call if you want to give it a whirl. It’s about two weeks of work, if you dog it.”
“Come out to one person, one person at all, anybody you know who isn’t me, and you’ll get your wish.”
. I mean if your family knew about this — ”
Castiel had never lost control of himself like this, ever, so Dean dug in, and got the barfy feeling that accompanied flight by etheric means, and then, woozy and freaked out and chilly, he was dumped out about 10 yards from the lip of the Grand Canyon.
