"Oh." John said simply. They sat in silence for a few minutes, but he finally lowered the paper and peered at Sherlock. "Is this for…do you have a case you're working on?"
"I'm afraid not, but don't worry. I'm from far in your future okay? When you go back to wherever you came from, I'll look normal again, okay?"
The Doctor bit his lip. "You've stayed with Uncle Jack a lot lately, I'm afraid of crossing time streams."
The Doctor chuckled, looping his finger through hers just as her cellphone started to ring. "You may want to watch that. The people of the eighteenth century were not quite ready for selfies and Angry Birds."
The man laid there, unmoving. John sighed, trying to find the story they'd stopped at last time. Two years now—that was how long it had been since Mr. Holmes had spoken. He used to mutter in his constant sleep, just a few sentences or phrases here and there, but it was enough to give them all hope for him. About two years ago, while John was in the room reading him a book of fairy tales, he'd heard what could be the man's last sentence.
Sherlock popped from the box as casually as if he was simply coming home from the market. He immediately hopped into his chair, somehow managing to make his long body fit so that he was curled into a ball on the cushion.
"Ah, ah!" The Doctor said, covering his ears. "I try not to peek ahead at the boys' futures. We are trying to let them live their lives as linearly as possible. No spoilers. Don't tell me who you are, and don't tell him. All I know is that you're on my trustable list, it doesn't bother me if you're Sherlock's landlord, or plumber, or boyfriend."
"Your offer to be one of the dozens of little companions you've had on the TARDIS? I'll pass, thanks."
"My Sherlock gets admirers. Of course he does, have you seen him? But Sherlock…he has never been one to need socialization. He used to sit in his room for days if I'd let him, just reading away and exercising that mind of his. He had it in his head that he wanted to be as smart as his father, but that's just not realistic. Not with my lousy genes anyway. The point is, never once in all of his life has Sherlock lied about who he is."
There had been many things about life with Sherlock Holmes that John did not believe at first. When he met Sherlock on that very first day, he did not want to believe that a man could deduce everything about him with a glance. Later, he had a lot of trouble believing that any one man could be so annoying while simultaneously being an amazing human being. However he absolutely could not believe this. There was no way in hell this young couple in front of him had been in love with each other for more than a week.
She was distracted when Redbeard rushed past her, almost knocking her over on his way to jump on Sherlock's lap. The Doctor smiled. He doubted Rose would know what the planet Moira was famous for, but the boys might, and he didn't want them to accidently give it away.
John shook his head absently. "It's brilliant." The smiled slowly disappeared, and he suddenly turned to Sherlock. "Hang on, how the hell did you not know that the Earth turned around the sun?"
Sherlock leaned in closely so that only the two of them could hear him. "Mother, I'm going to need some time alone with John if your little ultimatum is going to be met."
His hand tightened on hers, his face drawn in concern. "He's not using again, is he? I checked his arms earlier—I know there are other ways to take in opiates but—"
Sherlock stared back and his eyes watered a bit, but Rose was over before he could say another word, "That's what some people do, but I think we can agree that Nemo is a special fish that will not be eaten right?" she said, trying not to actually touch the wiggling thing.
Sam punched Dean in the shoulder as they shot up and grabbed their guns from the back wall. "I told you they'd notice it was missing."
John was overwhelmed. He walked back to the consul, leaning against the railing for a moment as Sherlock closed the doors.
"He's talking again, Molly. He's pulling through. He not here yet, but he hears me. He can hear me, Molly. I won't let go. I'll be here, every day, until he comes back."
"Yeah, thanks," she muttered sarcastically. She stared at his camouflage pants and bright orange shirt. "What are you wearing?"
"No, it's merely improbable," Sherlock said. "Yes, it's impossible to fit something big into something small, but it's not impossible to put a doorway into something big on something small. Scientifically it actually is all fairly simple to understand—"
The Doctor looked up suddenly as the daylight began to gently fade. "What time is it? Doesn't matter. Well, it does, but our clocks are set on Earth time so that's not really helpful. Give me Nemo I'll put him in some water" he said as he grabbed a small duffel bag he'd brought with him.
Unbeknownst to Sherlock, Rose stood only a room away. The Doctor held her, petting her hair. This would be the hardest few days they had ever spent on the TARDIS. They would not travel. The Doctor would never budge the box, and Rose would not ask him to. They would bring him his water, some food, a blanket when the sweating turned into shivering, but for the most part he was to be alone.
He was almost certain that the device would give him concrete proof of Mycroft's guilt, but when he ran and held it up to his brother's door it didn't so much as beep once. Crushed, he stalked back into the kitchen. Just as he started to think that the Sonic could not track anything but liquid, he heard it beep only inches away from the back door.
She stopped in her tracks, pulling the little device from her pocket and ducking into an alley so no one would see her. "Only the boys have this number," she reminded him, checking the device.
Captors. Yes. John remembered everything now. How three men had burst into his flat and surrounded him. They were aggressively silent. And just plain aggressive – John hadn’t been given a chance to fight OR surrender, a needle bit into his neck and his limbs felt heavy immediately. He remembered thinking ‘this is about Sherlock.’ The thought hadn’t made him angry. He’d felt… anticipation. Excitement.
It hadn’t been a high-end establishment. The drowned prostitutes had been treated far better than his sister had. Harry was dirty and emaciated, her thighs bruised purple with jabs. An ill-fitting heat harness her only garment – it had rubbed her neck and underarms raw, infection setting into the open wounds.
He ate his soup and drank the sweetened ginger tea, and he actually smiled at the little stack of jaffa cakes. Then he lay back down. "Thank you, John." He said.
“She was a prostitute.” I could barely hear his voice – and I was surprised enough that I almost didn’t hear his next words. “There were other men in the room – she... serviced... us all.” Sherlock grimaced. “Do you understand? I couldn’t protest... I couldn’t make excuses... I needed to be one of them...”
Molly told them about her ambition to be a doctor like her sire. She told them about her school where she took classes with Alphas and was just as smart and capable as they. She didn’t lie, it wasn’t easy being the only Omega. Sometimes she felt like a lamb surrounded by wolves. But she was determined. And more to the point, confident of her own worth.
Sherlock assisted John, bringing him his first aid kit and helping him undress. The bullet had gone through his shoulder, shattering his scapula on the way out. He’d had surgery to clean the wound and to remouve bone shards that could potentially puncture a lung or other damage. They’d screwed a metal plate to the large pieces, holding them so they’d knit back together more quickly.
“Christmas Eve drinkies!” Molly exclaimed. Mrs. Hudson passed around the tray of fancy little... goblets? Drinks glasses? They weren’t flutes... more like tulips... Lestrade wasn’t certain what they were called. He took one anyway and raised it for the toast.
“Ja, ok. Tell me if she becomes a nuisance.” She set a plate of pastry down between us and retreated.
I shrugged. “You’ve already lost someone... it doesn’t seem right that you have to go through that again.” I said gently. “And especially not knowing if he’s even alive... you should know that at least.”
It was frantic, our lovemaking, and more than a little rough. I was sore all over for days after – and I left bruises and marks on John’s flesh that shocked me later.
Sherlock smiled up at him. Their sweaty flesh slid against each other, fevered and sticky, not altogether pleasantly.
“And Tamara Krazinsky?” Sherlock asked, forcing his attention back to the murderous nurse. “Was she depressed too?”
I wanted SO MUCH for Sherlock to be alive... had I manufactured a barely plausible scenario for myself? Had I gone insane?
She sighed. "He loved you and you left him – as miserable as you have chosen to be, he's been even more miserable, but you decided that for him. Sherlock, you owe him an apology. Work on that."
“No.” She looked small and lost. “It’s two months now. Something terrible must have happened to him.”
At his yell, Sherlock had plunged into the room. He must have been close, loitering in the hall outside John’s room. He looked around wildly for what had caused John’s distress.
It was Angus' turn to sigh. "I did. Taz... he went back to Sheffield. We'd been together for seven years – five here in London. I thought we were happy... classic story, I guess. Taz got the seven year itch... I knew something was off, but not..." The nurse shook his head ruefully. "He started seeing a chap from back home... I didn't know until he moved out. So stupid..."
"Unsurprising considering Jones' other security measures." Sherlock remarked. He put his ear to the metal and twisted the dial.
Mycroft held out his arms and Lestrade joined him, his big hands roaming, finding the turgid prick and stroking it, pulling back the velvety foreskin. Mycroft moaned aloud. Lestrade tasted the narrow chest, licking the hard nub of a nipple, moving lower and rubbing his face on soft belly. Mycroft’s scent was musky with arousal.
“If you wanted excitement, you should have bonded with Moriarty.” Mycroft laughed nastily at his brother’s shocked expression. He was angrier than Sherlock had realised.
We arrived back at 221b Baker Street Wednesday afternoon no less exhausted for having slept most the way. John limped directly into the shower and I went to my room, stripped off and collapsed into bed. My head was pounding, my sinuses clogged, my lungs were heavy and I was developing a cough that raked across my raw throat like gravel. It was misery itself.
For the bonding, Sherlock came home to Sherrinford and stopped using scent suppressant. His mature scent reminded her so much of Jean-Claude, she had a brief moment of sentiment, smiling at the Omega and brushing the curls back from his eyes. He hadn’t smiled back, but he had refrained from uttering a cutting remark – it was positively civilised.
None of them were worth HALF of John! My John.... I couldn't believe I was lying next to him. I couldn't believe he was naked in my bed. I'd wanted him for so long!
Slaving away on the next installment! New chapter in a new year! Happy 2018, everyone. May it be better than 2017. And 2016...
I looked down my nose at him. Manslaughter, I deduced. Bar fight. Been in prison at least five years. Left handed. He was big and well used to having his way. “What’s your name?” I asked.
“Take a look.” Sherlock pulled a spyglass from the pocket of his beige trench coat. He stepped to the cleared area in front of the windows and extended the spyglass. He adjusted the focus, scanning back and forth. “There!” He said, gesturing at me to join him.
"You're more than just friends. The electricity between you... well, nothing could be more obvious." He said with a smirk.
I let him look me over, examining his expression as his eyes traveled over me. I couldn't help but worry that I wouldn't measure up... but John swept me back into his embrace and I buried my face against his hair, trembling with relief.
The water stung my back. The welts had mostly scabbed over, but one was infected. I knew because Nazer had obtained an ointment that he spread on it. Sometimes he was kind. He had painstakingly straightened my broken fingers and splinted them, winding strips of cotton he’d torn from a bed sheet around and around them.
Instead of returning to the Pensioners' Hotel, Sherlock went to one of his bolt holes, an artist's loft in Barking. The long ride on the Underground allowed him to rein in his urge to score heroin immediately and forget what he had just seen in its blissful anesthesia.
^^^ Sorry I worried you. I’m fine. A family emergency took me out of London for a while. I should have texted sooner – it all got away from me. ^^^
“It’ll be hard.” I said. “Contrary to popular opinion, absence does not make the heart grow fonder.”
John had braced for Sholto to tell him that Harry shouldn’t have been out in public with Alphas. That was stupid! She was just gone eleven, still a kid! They’d been to the cinema. “Yeah.” John was defiant.
“Sherlock!” I shouted. “Sherlock!” I opened his coat and found him huddled in on himself, arms crossed against his chest, head tucked down, using his sodden coat as a blanket, trying to preserve his precious body heat.
“You know where we’re going?” Lestrade asked John abruptly, changing the subject. Sherlock saw the tension clenching the policeman's jaw – he was nervous that John would use this new information to suss his secret. He needn't worry, it had never occurred to John that Lestrade was anything but a Beta. “An address?”
“Just like the girl.” Sherlock said. “Blood workup will confirm it.” He leant close to the boy’s neck. “Maple sugar.” He said. “With a foreign overlay.”
Immediately, Sherlock felt anxious – he didn’t like his Alpha to be out of sight. But he focussed on their link and calmed himself. John was just on the other side of the door, Sherlock could still feel his burgeoning affection and deep-seated desire. He felt prized, cherished, respected. Sherlock was safe. His Alpha would always protect him.
“Most Omegas live sheltered lives. There aren’t many educational or occupational opportunities for Omegas. As you know.” Sherlock scoffed. “There aren’t any Omega bars or clubs, at least not that I’m aware of. Maybe a sewing circle somewhere. You’ve met a lot of Omegas through your job? A lot of domestic disturbances?”
"Would that be so terrible?" Her expression silenced his protest. "Sherlock, maybe if you and John were together, THAT would get rid of the distraction."
That was disappointing – I’d hoped we’d have the evening together. I rubbed my calf against his and fondled his thigh. Sherlock’s words trailed off. He looked so sweetly flustered, I almost laughed.
Chance’d be a fine thing. Lestrade put his work first — you didn’t rise to the rank of DCI by making it home for dinner. He saw more of Georgianna now than he had before the divorce, even though he only had her overnight every other weekend and on holidays.
Sherlock raised his eyebrows feigning mild surprise. He'd known, of course, that Moran had the pelt there – the tailor's assistant had told him. He thought Moran's bedroom, as suggestive as that was, might be safer than the dungeon. It couldn't be any worse.
"Indeed. Anne Measing, age 43. Unmarried. She’s been employed at this hospital for almost two years but is new to Critical Care. Probably not a coincidence."
to get the Omegas together and get them to safety – he couldn't leave them alone to be recaptured or worse! As soon as they were safe, he could go find Sherlock... but he had to hurry...
Jo had chuckled like John had told a joke. “We’ll fit you for a custom one when you’ve completely healed. You can start practicing with a loaner in about a week. Don't wear it too long at first. You don’t want to aggravate the wound. How is it healing?”
"I wasn't looking for a lover. I don't want the distraction. I just want to work. The work matters! When I'm working I'm not bored. I don't like being bored."
“Depends how you define “ok.” She’s alive.” I rubbed my eyes again. “Sorry, I shouldn’t be so bitter. I got her into a rehab facility. Some crazy posh place in Switzerland. I flew there with her and stayed while she went through detox.”
“Sarah.” I said, then I scoffed. “Not that any of those thugs knew that – she went by ‘Misty.’ Is anyone ACTUALLY named Misty? Her real name is Sarah.”
Yet I know I am pitiful. The siren song of heroin is loud in my ears. Being with John muffles it somewhat, but it’s there still, relentlessly calling me. I can refuse it. I can say ‘no.’ I can deny it over and over and over. But it NEVER stops. Eventually I will succumb.
Mycroft slipped out without comment, but it was ten minutes before Lestrade extricated himself from the party. When he told Sherlock he had to get going, the detective had peered around the room, then given Lestrade a look somewhere between suspicious and disgusted. But he hadn’t said anything. He’d only glanced at John longingly. Lestrade clapped Sherlock on the shoulder. “Hang in there, mate.” He said.
“Everything there… Everything there is Sherlock’s. Or reminds me of Sherlock. It’s too much. I’ll never get past this surrounded by all that.”
“You can’t tell me you aren’t jealous of this one?!” The nurse gestured at Shane. Sherlock glanced at him, then wished he hadn't – Shane was regarding him with unrestrained pity.
“Is that what you’re going to eat?” Sherlock asked. “Why don’t you make the thing with the peas? Or the thing with the sauce?”
John came right over and sat on the floor, resting his head on the couch by my chest. I touched his hair lightly, wondering why he hadn't stayed overnight with her. Wondering if he'd got a leg over anyway. Wondering what he expected of me.
I stripped off the protective gear in the hallway as Sherlock detailed his findings to the Inspector. Before I was finished, they walked into the lift without me.
As he dragged me along, I saw how John was navigating through the maze – his torchlight picking out the fronds laying on the ground. He had been here before!
And here I could brood about John. I wanted him. That wasn't new, I'd wanted him from the beginning. I'd never intended for him to know – but he'd surprised me when he found out. He hadn't been disgusted, he hadn't pitied me, he hadn't done any of the things I'd imagined... l felt the hope surging through my chest again. Maybe... maybe John could love me the way I loved him...
I had urged Sherlock to lay on top of me instead. I finally got a good look at him then. Superficially he was still my Sherlock, long and pale and elegant, his big hands moving expressively. But he was very, very thin – he’d lost at least a stone of muscle since I’d last seen him naked (and he’d been too skinny then). His muscles had atrophied whilst he was held captive, whilst he lay in hospital… His knees and elbows were overlarge knobs in the centre of his spindly limbs, his hands shook and his gums were receding, his skin was dry and his colour tinged with gray.
John had trained in hospitals, worked in hospitals, even been in hospital a time or two. None of them had looked like this. None of them had smelled like this!
Before I could offer to hit Mary myself, John did something I couldn’t quite see from my position at her feet. He took hold of her shoulder, or perhaps her neck, and several long seconds later, Mary went limp.
Mycroft paused a moment – arranging his thoughts? Choosing his words? I stifled an impatient groan. “He’s in prison in Kazakstan.” He said. “There’s a terrorist cell there running a hit squad and dealing in arms and explosives – we believe they’re the last failsafe in Moriarty’s scheme to kill you if Sherlock lives.”
"No. John, I don't want anyone else. Ever again.” I believed he meant that, at least right now. “Erm... what about you?” He asked. “Will you have... girlfriends?"
“No... don’t... don’t say anything. Let me get it out.” I desperately didn’t want him to know... but I had to... I couldn’t bear that he only loved me because he didn’t know who I really was.
Sherlock smiled at me so fondly that my irritation drained away like water through a sieve. Unthinkingly, he broke off a hunk of strudel and popped it in his mouth with a satisfied smirk and I smiled with utter fondness myself. I wasn’t the only one who was predictable.
He was sitting at the table, eating his dessert. He smiled a syrupy smile at me, his eyes clear and blue and beautiful. “Just admiring how well your jeans fit.” He told me.
The hours John had spent at Scotland Yard, giving his statement about Angus Church had been stressful. He could pinpoint the moment that one of the coppers had noticed his amputation – suddenly everyone was staring at him with that look on their face. That look of pity and horror and open curiosity. John hated that look.
I melted into him, forgiving him everything. His hands caressed my thighs, moving upwards and my cock definitely noticed. The things I would do with him! The pleasure I would wring out of his body with my hands and my mouth! He would be amazed, transported... John would be mine...
It was only yesterday, our first kiss – that had quickly become our first time together. As intense as that had been, our discussion afterwards had been more so.
That appeared to be the cause of death – GBH overdose. GBH wasn’t just a ‘date rape’ drug used to incapacitate unsuspecting women, it was also a gay party drug used in clubs and in private ‘chemsex’ parties. Like methamphetamine, GBH – taken in small amounts – reduced inhibitions and heightened libido. The difference between an intoxicating dose and a lethal dose was quite small, so GBH deaths weren’t uncommon. It had even been the weapon of choice of a serial killer a few years ago.
"Yes, Sherlock. John will have been very upset by your death. He's going to feel betrayed. He might hate you for it."
Sherlock finally looked up. John’s expression quelled his impulse to be flippant. “I don’t expect anything.” He said. “I had… hopes.”
Shane nodded but looked mistrustful, his eyes bouncing between Sherlock and Moran, taking in their body language and coming to a conclusion that he plainly couldn’t quite believe.
I was so shocked, I flailed for a moment, bumping the table, spilling more tea. My mouth was pressed against his... then his teeth scraped across my lip and passion ignited, erupted within me, I was aflame and I was kissing John.
"Sherlock... if distance and time would make these feelings fade, they would have done – at least a little – by now."
Sherlock shrugged. "You were another wedge to use against me. He exploited all my sentimental attachments."
“If you think...” I said into his ear. “...that I’m giving it up to a bottom-feeding twat like you, you are quite mistaken.” I let go of him and he dropped to the floor, clutching his balls.
In public, we were careful to act as if we were just friends. It was more difficult than I had imagined – I shouldn’t look at him too much, but I shouldn’t avoid looking at him either. I had to stop myself from grinning foolishly, stop myself from inhaling the scent of his hair, from leaning close and pressing my lips against his neck... John was better at it than I. He would look into my besotted smile with a profound blandness that sobered me quickly.
Mycroft... I’ve met several times with Mycroft about the Moriarty problem. I don’t like his predictions about where this chapter will lead, but he’s rarely wrong about these sorts of things. We have been preparing.
is the real application of Moriarty’s theorem: exactly how to nudge the markets, which strings to pull, to make it do what he wants.”
It felt like my life before I met Sherlock. Empty sameness stretching out as far as I could see – and me, caught in it, trapped.
“Do your brothers feel the same way?” I asked. “Does Geraint feel he was cheated out of the Earldom?”
As an xmas gift to myself, I took a few days off writing to read Earlgreytea68’s FANTASTIC Johnlock. I have been so inspired by her ‘Baseball’ series, that I’ve made an extensive outline for a story about Sherlock winning the Tour de France – I know a lot about bike racing... but I promise that I’ll finish THIS piece first.
Both his hands run down the length of my back, making me shudder, and grip my arse to bring me faster onto his cock. I cry out at the feeling -- harder is good, faster is even better, and this is ending up like most of our other couplings now. Passionate, heart-wrenchingly passionate and all-consuming, just like my love for the man.
‘I don’t wish to ruin your favour of me, Watson, although I daresay that would be a trick, given the hero’s welcome you accorded me just minutes ago.’ His hand was on the table once more, so I grabbed it, covered it gently with my own. If we were closer, I would have lifted it to my lips to kiss it.
He fixed me a curious stare, his brows furrowed. I felt myself soften; being so gruff would not do either of us any good. ‘Watson, what is it?’
) and paid with a handful of coins. I followed him to a table outside, where a few Berliners were sitting at other tables, some quiet, reading newspapers, others chattering animatedly in German.
The entire play continued for quite some inestimable time, but even from the start, the voices floated by me, over me, as I instead became hyper-focussed on Holmes beside me, on our hands in my lap, on his pulse which I could feel thrum against my skin. I wanted more, my cheeks burning at the thought, and worse still when I remembered the events of the previous night. Would there possibly be a repeat tonight? Or perhaps even more? Something different? The words of Shakespeare fell on my deaf ears as I contemplated all the possibilities. I landed on my favourite possibility, almost too explicit to write, and ran that idea into the ground, over and over, my cheeks most probably a permanent shade of red.
And before he could finish the sentence, the music started once more, or at least grew louder, and I jumped at the sudden noise. He watched me for a moment longer, lingering, it looked like, and kissed my wrist again. His tongue appeared just briefly on my skin, causing my breath to hitch; he hummed, a sound which resonated deep within his chest, and he returned my hand to my own thigh. He patted it leisurely, once, twice, and just when I thought it was going to stay on mine, he removed his hand and leaned back against his seat.
‘Oh yes.’ I watched as he lit another of his just-rolled cigarettes. ‘Many cases of blackmail and pub raids, but in this city… It is more rampant than even some corners of our London.’ He took a long drag and leaned back in his chair, his hand returning to his leg. ‘I found myself… forced to confront that part of myself which I had — by necessity — hidden from the world.’ Another drag. ‘And this city seemed as safe a place as any, and as it happens, much safer than anywhere in England. For me.’
I grabbed his hand, wishing I could kneel but knowing my knees better. ‘I do not pity you, Holmes,’ I said firmly. Looking up at me, his eyes searched mine frantically. ‘I could never. As long as you give me no reason to.’
He nodded, letting go of the envelope so that I could keep it, and replied, ‘Open that with my brother, and no sooner.’ I nodded. He straightened and, in a move surprising to his character, clapped me on the shoulder. ‘Safe travels, Doctor.’
“Lestrade has Mary under surveillance? That should lead directly to him.“ Sherlock ate more of the strudel.
It was the same in rugby. I had to prove myself like the bigger lads didn’t. Over and over, I stood up to their challenges, took my hits and gave as good as I got. Gave more than I got. And in the end it was me that they voted captain, not any of the other lads.
John stepped up onto his feet, still straddling Sherlock's lap, then spread his legs wide, balancing on the wall, until his cock was level with Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock leaned forward and took the head between his lips. He tongued the slit, savouring the salty bitterness there. Then, again cupping John's arse, urged him forward.
Lestrade fiddled with the suppressant bottles. “I’ve been tempted. Some Alphas smell… well, pretty wonderful… but I’d be fired. Never mind I’ve done the job for nine years, they’d give me some shite about my safety. Or worse, make up a special Omega job and stick me at a desk. It never seemed worth it.”
I heard the outside door open - for an instant I thought the lady herself had returned (handy that, I could acquaint her with her guest) - then I heard John's laugh.
For a moment, Dr. Mahon looked like she was going to argue but then she sighed, defeated, and agreed.
He began to fuck Sherlock, leaning forward, looking into Sherlock’s eyes as he shoved himself up his arse. God, he was so beautiful, dewy with sweat, full lips parted, panting, eyes unfocused with lust. “Harder!” Sherlock demanded. “Fuck my arse harder!” John felt his bollocks slapping against Sherlock with every stroke. Sherlock began cursing elaborately, begging for more, saying absolutely filthy things. John loved it.
But after almost two years of suffering, John's joy was tempered, entwined with bitterness and recriminations.
“I hate it too.” That was such a vast understatement. I hated everything about this whole undertaking. The challenge had faded many months ago – most of these people weren’t difficult to find nor were they especially cunning, Moriarty simply had strict rules in place protecting the organization. It was tedious work, gathering evidence against them, dismantling the cells, scattering the lower levels, imprisoning the management. It was boring – until it wasn’t and I was fighting for my life, fleeing, holing up and treating my own wounds with duct tape, boiling honey and a travel sewing kit. In the shower, John had found and carefully kissed all my new scars and bruises, culminating in the one above my ear. (“At least you had this one properly treated.”)
I let that pass. “So Victor left Wallog to go to work. You were playing video games. Selwyn – WAS he packing up?”
Then Sherlock pulled away. He abruptly pushed John off his lap and stood up. “I’m sorry, John… I can’t do this. I can’t be distracted right now!” Sherlock cried out, a touch of desperation in his voice, and stalked off to his bedroom.
It did indeed work. My fingers slid into him with pleasurable ease. I could tell that he was no longer used to the intrusion, I went slowly, fondling his hard prick, letting him relax as I worked him open.
look out for him and not your Alpha father? Because your father left when you were young. You didn’t like how he treated your family – which more often than not means alcoholic – and resolved never to be like him. Thus your caring and your control of your instincts.”
But I knew better. With an effort, I controlled myself. I kissed his buttock, ran my tongue down to his leg and kissed him there. I licked the inside of his thigh, tasting the tender flesh, feeling his muscles firm as he shifted with lustful enthusiasm.
Sherlock leaned against his side of the door in relief. He felt tears on his face – the emotion of his flight and near-death overwhelming him. And the kindness of this Alpha, helping him, protecting him…
I trailed after the woman. She must be older than she looked, I decided, because she looked about 20. She must also be VERY good or Mycroft wouldn’t have her on this mission.
“I would like to ask you some questions that have come up in my research – get your medical opinion." Shane said to John. "More trauma from crime than from war, but I’d guess it’d translate.”
Shane looked ashamed, but he also looked panic-stricken. He was sweaty, his breathing shallow, his eyes darted back and forth looking for escape. He took a deep breath, squared his shoulders unconvincingly and walked past Sherlock into the building. "Lead the way." He said.
…he saw the bandaged stump and his mind shut down. But he was still instinctively moving to catch the teapot. His stump bumped against it and the pain! John yelped – loudly. The teapot fell off the table onto the bed, leaking hot tea onto his legs through the blanket. But he barely felt it. The pain was too intense, both from the knock and from the sight of the thing.
John heard movement in the room. He started back to bed, thinking Sherlock had finally returned. And came face to face with Nurse Measing. She looked pale and foreboding in the dim hospital room, her rosy cheeks and curvy figure erased in the gloom.
“Using Moriarty’s own theorem, ironically. Part of his dissertation laid out his predictive economic theorem. He based it on some of Alan Turing’s formulae – in WWII, Turing and the Bletchley group broke the German’s Enigma machine code, without which, the allies would certainly have lost the war. In order to keep the Germans from realising that their code had been broken, Turing and his group worked out mathematically how much of the decoded information could be acted upon without arousing suspicion.”
The scene was grim. An unbonded Omega female had been found in a skip. She was nude, a petite girl with long tangles of brown hair, laying awkwardly amongst construction debris and bags of garbage. Body temp and nascent insect activity indicated she’d been there roughly eight hours.
I don’t know if we’re together or not. John says we can work out the details later. The details. Small things like touching and snogging and sucking and licking and fucking … I want to devour John Watson! I want to swallow him whole, take him inside me, make him cum so much and so hard he can do nothing but lie against me, limp and drained, completely in my power.
"I'm not changing the subject, I'm answering you," Sherlock said with a frustrated growl. He stalked over to the box and felt around the top of it for a moment, then pulled down a key. He fumbled with the lock for a moment, then slipped into the box and closed the door behind him.
"I thought that was your voice," Sherlock said to his brother, hopping up to sit next to John on the sofa. "You got bald. And fat."
Sherlock stared at him a moment, suddenly realizing what they were fighting about. "It doesn't matter, John. I'm not hiding anything that would affect your life in any way."
Molly nodded, patting John on the shoulder as she headed out the door. "I think he does know that. See you tomorrow, Dr. Watson."
"You like pirates," John said quickly, remembering something Rose had mentioned when he'd first met her. "Bees. I think you mentioned something about liking bees last week. You play the violin."
Other names were entirely foreign to him. Vashtra and Jenny, Professor Song, Sam and Dean W, and something known only as 'the Ponds', to name a few. However, he had complete confidence in his future self. If he had decided (or rather, would one day decide) that these people could take care of the boys, then he believed it entirely.
"That's bloody convenient," John spat. "You just happen to need sleep at the same time we're going to going to have a row."
Sherlock nodded, pushing his face into the pillows. He was quiet for a long minute, and Rose was hopeful that he had finally fallen asleep. He turned his face to her suddenly. "Mummy, I'm bored. I don't think it's a sleeping night."
Sherlock didn't need another word of encouragement—he grabbed his small backpack and went running off toward the trees.
The only thing the two boys' room had in common was the ceiling. The Doctor and Rose had painted them together before the family even moved in. Above each boy's bed was a ceiling full of the universe; thousands of stars in their correct places, planets that were visible from Earth, and some that were just out of sight. As Rose lay there in Sherlock's room at three in the morning the stars seemed to swirl in front of her tired eyes. He insisted on having the light on—he'd read a book in the TARDIS library about weeping angels, and ever since he had been insistent that he needed to have some kind of light around him at all time. She had tried to assure him that the dark was not that scary, but one bout with the Vashta Nerada later both he and Mycroft insisted on nightlights.
“Twelve people in the last four weeks have all been found dead within a ten mile radius of this place,” Sam answered. “The bodies were all…” he glanced at the children, “A little weird.”
The Doctor strolled in a moment later and didn't even say anything, he just walked over and gently pulled Sherlock out of the trashcan and threw him over his shoulder. "Dad, I'm looking for a clue! The investigation isn't over," he protested.
“There not demons, Cas,” Sam said pointing towards the flask still in the Doctor’s hand. “The Holy Water didn’t even phase them.”
John stood in front of the open doors of the TARDIS, staring out at the vastness of the Earth. It was the largest most amazing thing he had ever witnessed, but it was only one planet. He tried to imagine the concept—billions of planets and stars at so many points in time, going on in both directions for trillions of years. He was only one man, with a very small life, alive for only eighty years or so. He was utterly insignificant.
"You know why," she said softly, trying to let her voice sound soothing. "Daddy is from a place where people don't sleep very much, and Mummy is from a place where people sleep every night. You fall somewhere in the middle."
Rose loved her boys, but being a human with two half- Time Lord children could be difficult at times. The boys didn't sleep or eat as much as she did. Usually the Doctor had her covered; when she needed some human time he would stay up with the boys, sometimes for days at a time. He only really slept a few nights out of the week anyway. Unfortunately, this meant when she was alone with her sons it was hard to adjust to their schedules.
"It's not wrong. It's just a little different than the others. I asked if you wanted to paint over it. Do you? Do you want to fix it?"
John didn't ask questions, he simply started walking away from the statue behind him, getting closer to his friend. John reached to his back pocket, but his head turned slightly and Sherlock yelled out a warning.
The boy clutched the picture, looking wildly around the room. He set it back on the dresser and ran out towards the kitchen, staring intently at the eyeballs in jars. "Are these mine, John?"
"Normal children don't get to change their names whenever they want to, you needed a solid name. I let you pick it once, I warned you it was a permanent decision."
They were silent for a long moment, both just staring at the angels over each other's shoulders. Despite the situation, Sherlock heard John chuckle once. "You can let me go now, Mate."
Dr. John Watson was just about ready to head home for the day. His patients had been dealt with, his paperwork was done, but there was something he had to do first. This was his routine, every day before he left the hospital, he had to at least check on the man in room 221.
"Much later," the Doctor smiled, watching the boy's awkward legs trying to keep up with his dog. His mobile rang.
“That piece of paper is blank,” a low voice said suddenly, between them. There was a tall man standing where he hadn’t been a moment ago, directly in front of the Winchesters. His long overcoat swayed slightly in the breeze as he fixed the Doctor with a confused stare.
"Ours. I've been planning it all night. I've bought everything and loaded it into the TARDIS. Tents, coolers, marshmallows, fish, everything we need."
"How am I supposed to know that?" Watson asked, a bit embarrassed as he unbuckled the strap. "I'm still having trouble believing you were ever a child in the first place."
Sherlock yawned. "Not really Mummy, it's an alternate dimension compressed by the form of a doorway, in this case a bag, that—"
Rose nodded with a sigh. "It's only been the last few weeks. He was thrilled about having a baby brother at first. I don't think he likes splitting the attention."
"After about five years we noticed that I still looked twenty. Or, I guess we didn't, my mum did. You'd like her, she's a great woman. We know someone else who became immortal after a run in with the time vortex, it wasn't too unheard of. That was sixty years ago. I've hardly aged three years since."
Sherlock turned to find his mother smashing into the Weeping Angel's head with a large hammer. She wasn't looking at either of them, her eyes were trained on the other angel, but she was speaking to him. "I swear, Sherlock," she yelled, "if you ever put yourself in harm's way just because you're bored I will personally take this hammer to your head. Are we clear?"
"Well," the Doctor said in long, drawn out voice, "that's not exactly what I said. But, you know, by and large, time travel is a pretty peaceful venture."
His friend grimaced, looking back and forth between his bedroom door and the door that led out of the flat. "I'm terribly sorry, John, but it's too late for you now. You'll be stuck here, same as me."
Sherlock realized with a start that he still had his arms around John. His eyes burned, and as he tried to blink them one at a time, he realized how slim their chances were. This building was old, it was bound to be renovated before Mycroft ever arrived. All the time he had had at his disposal in Baker Street, and only now, in their last few seconds, had he ever hugged John Watson—and this had been an accident. He didn't let go.
I set the kettle going once more and ventured a guess where he kept the tea, and there it was, the cabinet above the stove, in fact the only cabinet, in a jar covered in unreadable German. I smelled it; it wasn’t a bit fresh, or even my or Holmes’s favourite, I noted, but it would have to do. I wondered if there were any good British tea in the city, and if so, how I would ever manage to find it or even afford it.
‘Another!’ he commanded, or rather tried to, for his speech was so breathy and nearly whiny that it had lost its authority. I smiled and withdrew, slicked two fingers more to be safe and pressed them in at his command.
‘You must know I have wanted you for a long time.’ My voice broke but my reserve bid me continue. ‘I never thought I would see you again and I love you.’
I run my hand over his cock a few times, my fist tight, and stretch my neck, for I know he is watching me, and I know he loves my neck. He grunts and his hands fall to my hips, another one of his favourite features, I believe (and once or twice, he has remarked how ‘feminine’ they appear to him, although I do not quite see it). When he starts to buck into my hand, I withdraw it and wipe the remaining salve on my thigh, for I have learned that to wipe it anywhere else meant a huff from my partner and a curse of annoyance after our coupling. This way, when we bathe later, it is easily cleaned with little hassle.
But as I set his tea down in front of him, he merely glanced at me, then focussed on the tea. I felt wrong-footed. Still, we were the both of us Englishmen, so I sat across from him with my own cuppa and waited a bit.
‘John,’ he whispered, and I pulled away to look at him and nearly spent myself then. His eyes were clearer than I had ever seen them, not stormy but instead peaceful, and there was a look of such devotion in them that I balked.
I cry out each time he thrusts now, and his thrusts are getting more frantic. His breathing is getting shallower, his chest heaving, a line of sweat along his forehead. I sit up a bit more to watch him and also to gain the leverage to rock myself back onto him, to meet him thrust for thrust. That makes him cry out, an animalistic grunt, and I begin to lose myself to my oncoming crisis.
‘I suppose there is something in it for you. If I am what they say I am.’ He kissed my chin, still looking at me with those pale eyes.
I turned to Holmes, who was once again radiating a sort of bliss, a lightness, which in turn lightened my own chest. I smiled, and feeling brave, asked, ‘Care to dance again?’
As Holmes continued to lean against me, his hands running restlessly between my sides and my back, I wondered at the level of emotion he was allowing on display, and then I wondered something. ‘Holmes,’ I muttered into his ear, wishing to placate him, ‘I will come back. You know that, right?’ He straightened and looked at me. ‘I will return as soon as I can. Of course I will come back to you.’
‘There’s tea on the table,’ he said and turned back to his newspaper. I released my hands of him and hobbled over for some lukewarm, medium-grade tea, which should have been a lousy thought, but I couldn’t find it in myself to be too irritated. For it was tea in the presence of Holmes, and I think I could have withstood drinking sour milk if it meant I could watch Holmes work.
He looked down, sheepish, and I watched him attempt in vain to straighten the papers on the table until the kettle whistled. He poured us tea, moving about not as well as I remember him, a slight wince and limp he wasn’t even trying to hide indicating that he was favouring his right side. As he sat across me once more, tea in front of each of us, he told me the story of our time apart.
I heard him chuckle next to me, still breathing heavily, and I leaned over once more to kiss his cheek, his jaw, his chin. How many years have I wanted this man? How many times have I wanted only to reach over, to reach out and touch his shoulder, his hair, his knee, his cheek? How many sleepless nights had I spent attempting to define why I was grieving so deeply, why I was still, months on, mourning this man? I worked it out in the end, when I thought it was too late, but here we were, together, closer than we had ever been. I looked down at Holmes as his breath finally calmed to its normal state. He looked back at me with an open expression, completely vulnerable and feeling as though he were thinking the same I was, and I cupped his cheek and said against his lips, ‘I love you, Sherlock Holmes.’
Beneath me there is fumbling about, but I know what he’s doing: moments later there is a slicked finger at my entrance. I nod immediately and cup his jaw to kiss him properly again, eager now and impatient for him to prepare me. He does so as he always does: nearly coolly perfunctorily, that is until he brushes upon that spot inside me. He can always find it, some hidden talent of his for which I thank the stars above. One finger turns into two -- I have to leave his lips to pant and catch my breath.
Holmes got under the covers, lifting them as he did the night before, and I happily followed him in. I held him close, and he wrapped one loose arm around my bad shoulder and looked at me. I blinked and decided to take the lead he was yielding: I kissed him.
‘I don’t know his name,’ Holmes said several moments later, his tea half gone. His fingers were twitching; did he not have any cigarettes?
‘I am not sure the best action to take either, Watson,’ he said quietly. My heart dropped; surely he would not expect me to leave? ‘But we should first consult my elder brother. I daresay he has something in mind for me anyway.’
‘The man to whom I spoke today — a Mr Hirschfeld — tells me that the police know of the existence of … those like … me, and we are rarely prosecuted. Watson, the police even attend balls here. Balls of a certain proclivity.’
Not wanting to ‘hover’ over Holmes, I cleared some room on the sofa next to him, a good distance between us, and grabbed one of the papers. It was all in German — of course it was. I closed it and placed it in my lap and sipped the tea. It wasn’t bad.
Two years since the Reichenbach Fall, and Mycroft Holmes pays me a visit in 221B, in his brother’s flat which he left me — allowed me — to rent. I know he halved what I ought to owe Mrs Hudson each month, even if mangled grief kept me from ever thanking him for it. He paid me a visit to ask my assistance; I thought it was the least I could do. There was an odd business in Berlin, he said (really? thought I), which he would like me to peek in on.
‘Holmes.’ I was surprised to find tears in my eyes as I looked up at him. His hands were on either side of my head, threading through my hair, his eyes on mine. ‘Holmes, have you seen a doctor here?’
I stood there, one unending moment leading into the next, and watched Holmes read the newspaper he held in front of his face, his head moving back and forth, and knew those grey eyes were passing quickly back and forth over the text. I ached to reach out for him, just to touch him, for in that moment he seemed untouchable, even aethereal. And I thought of last night, how he had arched under me, how he had given himself over to such intense pleasure and how I had done the same. Did he wish for that sort of activity to repeat itself? And if so, how soon? Previously, I had assumed Holmes had no interest in such activities or even in any romantic entanglement. Now, on the other side of such a night, I wondered what his appetite might be, and if it were possible that it might match mine. I was no longer a young man, I admit, but I had wanted Holmes for so long, I think my body would be up for anything, if I only knew he wanted it too.
I took a step towards Holmes, unable to keep myself from him, for his eyes had fallen, his face hardened to keep emotion in. He looked miserable, utterly miserable, and my heart sank in my chest. I placed a hand on his shoulder, startled to find him trembling ever so slightly, and cupped his cheek. ‘Not today,’ I whispered. ‘I will not leave you today. I have to see Hamlet with you, right?’
I nodded, not knowing how else to react, and thought about what all of this meant for him. A Sherlock Holmes unable to return to his country, to his city, barely even able to walk. Next to me sat a broken man, one might say half a man compared to the one I once knew.
My own cock is trapped between our chests, rubbed with each rock back onto my Watson’s cock within me, and I know that even without that friction I would be close.
‘I’ve loved you for so long,’ he whispered brokenly. Panting, I kissed his neck, licked at the sweat there, and felt him start to tense around me.
I nodded again. ‘We must.’ I wanted to say his name, but could not even force myself to use his alias.
I willed my pulse to calm and let the silence stretch out for several moments before breaking it once more with my own query. ‘Why Berlin?’
Mycroft nodded and smiled in a soothing, knowing sort of way. ‘I trust you know the reason for my sending you.’
His face transformed slowly into the loveliest, most pleasant and thankful face I have ever seen on him. If I kissed him again in that moment, I couldn’t be faulted in that heavy moment for my inability to restrain myself.
I awoke again in what must have been in the middle of the night, a sharp twinge in my shoulder. I looked over Holmes’s shoulder: he was awake. I had to move my arm or risk a useless limb the next day, but it was still under Holmes’s head, and I didn’t want to startle him.
We lay like that for some indeterminable amount of time, long enough that I was about to fall asleep, before Holmes stiffened suddenly and sat up, clutching his side with a nearly silent gasp.
The bread was a bit hard but nothing to sneeze at, but the beer was the best I’d had in all my days. I was rarely given to enjoy beer, as I much preferred brandy and the wines which Holmes likewise preferred, but this beer was deserving. I drank half of it in the first gulp, surprised, and when I looked up, Holmes was smirking.
Or it was possible that John had headed directly to Mariah’s flat to rekindle their passion. He still got the odd text from her...
“I do! John, I know! I’ve thought about this – ANY  change in our relationship is dangerous for you. I thought about leaving...or sending you away –“
So as John practiced blowing me, I practiced listening to him – listening to his emotions and desires. What I heard largely assuaged my insecurities. John loved me. He truly loved me! It might not last forever – what does? But right now John wanted ME.
More stairs. At the bottom two passages forked away. Moran indicated the right passage, it corkscrewed downward and they walked its curving length together. They were of a height and their shoulders touched now and again. Neither man shied away from the contact.
By the time I enlisted, I didn’t even think about it any more. As a captain, my rank demanded respect. But I didn’t rest on my rank, I earned their respect as a man and as a soldier.
The trail was a river of rainwater, filled with rocks. We picked our way through and I became increasingly grateful for the warm boots and coat. Sherlock was out here in his cloth coat?! He would be wet through long since.
But Sherlock’s body was tensed – John stilled himself and caressed Sherlock’s chest, fondled his prick. Sherlock relaxed into the stretch and John slowly pushed in farther. Sherlock took it, but John could see the strain. “You’re OK, love.” He said, kissing Sherlock. “Take your time, bear down – it helps. And breathe.”
The first time they were together, John had been so preoccupied by his anger, by thinking it was their only chance to be together and wanting to put EVERYTHING into that one coupling.... he could hardly say if it had been good. He thought it was, but that simply could have been the importance he attached to it in his mind.
“See what you can find.” I said. “You work at hospital – you could talk to the A&E staff, show them a photo. Maybe they’ve seen him.”
There were a number of vehicles already in the road, an ambulance among them. Dusette guided Shane over and the Emergency team wrapped a blanket around him and gave him a hot pack to hold against his chest. They wanted him to lie down, but Shane resisted. He watched while they assessed Madam Dusette’s wrist and the blooming bruises on her face and neck.
"This sort of trauma... I don't think it's the sort of thing you can just ... delete. There's too much fallout. I think you'll have to work through it."
She was quick, darting towards him and unleashing a series of jabs and hooks. John danced around her with fast footwork, swerving sideways to avoid the first few punches, feigning weakness in his left leg, dragging it slightly. She fell for it as he'd hoped, going for his left side, kicking out hard, John blocked the attack, let the Alpha’s ankle slip up under his armpit, and pushed her knee away where it hung suspended in the air. The American lost her balance and fell to the floor. Still holding firmly onto her leg, John landed a solid blow to her head. And another.
“I know, yeah. It wasn’t supposed to be me. They had someone picked out for him. But, well, it didn’t work out. I’ve gotten a... let’s say a mixed reaction from his family. But Sherlock is great. Bonding with him... I can’t explain it, it’s... life-changing.”
The underling left, and the boss came into the office and sat at the desk. Sherlock was hidden behind the door – the desk was at a 90 degree angle to the lounge, which put Sherlock at 11 o’clock to the boss. He peeked carefully out and saw that he was writing an email. The detective strained to see what it said. Something about Tallinn and someone named... not Moriarty... Moran...
Ianto spoke. “I’m going out to check the trail.” He said, opening a door to a large coat room and pulling a mac from a hanger.
“How can you be so sweet?” John asked. “You’re the worst human being I know.” He guided Sherlock into a comfortable position on his side, John pressed against his back with his arm around Sherlock’s chest.
But no, Mycroft would have approached me differently if Sherlock had died... he wouldn’t give me this kind of hope.
I found my glasses and guarded my food until the meal was over, then I threw it away. I didn’t make a show of it, but I knew it was seen and assessed.
"It’s nothing. Just a little spill yesterday. I'll be fine. And I'm right next door if you want me."
John had been a reluctant cocksucker. He’d only tried twice and despite taking out my piercing for him, he was tentative. He tried – he did really try – but he was daunted by his gag reflex. No one LIKES to choke and feel the tears stream from their eyes, it’s just something one had to accept when one loved cock. John hadn’t accepted it – he might love me, but he didn’t lust after the male member. I had avoided the subject for fear it would alienate him, hasten the inevitable end of our affair.
A few of the rescued Omegas had crushes on John. It made Sherlock insane when Alfred or Pamela flirted with his mate. John would take Sherlock’s hand or put his arm around his waist, both reassuring his Omega and showing the others he wasn’t available.
“God forbid!” Mycroft snapped — they both knew neither Sherlock nor John would deal well with losing the other. “Do you have reason to believe that may be the case?” Mycroft’s voice had sharpened — Lestrade could hear the elder Holmes straining to decode every nuance of their conversation.
“I’ll take Molly on the stairs.” John told Alfred. The girl was holding up her bright auburn head on her own now, but her eyes were still unfocussed. John carefully picked her up again – with the adrenalin still surging through his system she weighed almost nothing.
I sighed – I didn’t want the sodding bread, but I couldn’t allow anyone to take liberties. I grabbed his wrist and twisted.
And it was a non-event. He and Mike drank a little beer and talked about their school days and their current work. There were probably some attractive women there, but John didn’t feel up to trying to pull a date.
Sherlock recovered quickly and began begging. “John, harder, please… oh! Please, John! Harder! Fuck me harder!”
John shrugged. “Lock her in the bog – lock them both in the bog. I don’t want them listening in anyway.”
"Yes!" I was so hard, walking was painful. But John had me by the hand and we ran to my room. There I untangled myself from my shirt, tossed it aside and stepped out of my shoes.
“Are you sure? A few months ago I had to drop everything to help out my sister. I didn’t even tell work – had to ask a friend to do it while I was out of town...” This wasn’t strictly true – I’d been with Sherlock in the Japanese suite. But Harry’s drinking was my cover story – and it was a good one. “Seb could have gone to help an aunt... or a cousin...” I was blatantly fishing now.
The link! Maybe he could use it. Regardless of distance, John would have known if Sherlock had been killed or if he were hurt. Clearly, he was alive – John just knew that.
I had the day off work for once. I had almost spoiled it by saddling myself with a hangover, but after a lunch of greasy carbohydrates, rugby on the telly and a kip on the sofa, I was feeling much better.
"No, not at all. The last thing we need is for us both to be invalided. Promise me you won't do anything stupid."
I smiled at her. “Not exactly fine.” I said. “You’re going to have quite a bruise. And...” I gestured down at her torn blouse.
"SHE texts ME, Sherlock. I haven't texted back in two weeks. Since I broke it off, she keeps showing up at work and... why am I explaining – aren't you supposed to just KNOW this!? Been too busy on Grindr to pay attention!?"
She held my gaze with her teary eyes. “Yes.” She quavered and I remembered that though Mycroft had told her I was alive – indeed she had harboured my automaton – I hadn’t seen her, or she me, until now.
“I have it here.” She said, going to the desk. She unlocked a drawer and lifted out a folio of papers. She laid it open on the desk. “This is the will that Owen – Owen Hughes, the estate’s lawyer – had. He swears it's the one my father gave it to him.”
An inmate was yanking at the straps holding him down. “Hey! Get off him!” For a moment I was face to face with the man – he was sturdy and hawkish with piercing brown eyes and a full head of hair. I leveled my rifle and prodded him with it, none to gently. He hesitated, glancing down at Sherlock with a look I couldn’t define but definitely did not like. I prodded him harder, shoving the barrel into his guts hard enough to bruise and he finally backed away. I just barely registered another soldier grabbing him.
Lestrade laughed. “Somewhat, yeah. Georgianna’s fourteen — perfect age to be embarrassed by her dad.”
"His name was Luther Jones." Lestrade said. "He worked from home – day trader, I think, something involving the stock market. The neighbors also said he enjoyed gambling – online, card games, the dogs. He'd gamble on anything. But his luck was good – he won more than he lost."
I wasn’t laughing now. I stood up and pulled his pyjama pants off. I shimmied out of my jeans and slapped him lightly on the flank.
John wasn't sure how it happened. One second he was still mourning Sherlock's death, still beating himself up for not seeing it coming, not being there when Sherlock had needed him – as he had been for long over a year. The next second ... well...
“It’s not the most convenient…” John said doubtfully. People liked big cocks in theory. In practice, John knew it could challenge even the most willing lover’s anatomy.
I clung to his wrist as I gasped for air like a fish. I stomped his foot under the table, hard, then gritted my teeth and broke his thumb. He screeched. The guards watched with minor interest as I reclaimed my hunk of bread.
I wasn’t going to say no to that! I pulled my t-shirt over my head and stretched out on my stomach. Sherlock straddled my hips and got to work, his large, strong hands massaging all the tension from my muscles.
And John… if he had to have a guardian – the Omega laws weren’t going to change anytime soon, they’d only been freed from sequester fifty years ago. The equal employment act that made it possible for Omegas to have jobs (as pre-school teachers, pediatric nurses, nannies – certainly not as chemical engineers or mathematicians) was enacted only 17 years ago. At that pace, Omegas might be held responsible for their own actions sometime in the next 500 years.
“I have...” My voice didn’t work. It was nothing more than a breathy whisper. I tried again. “I have to talk to Mycroft.” I said. My gorge rose and I coughed and retched some more causing stabbing pains in my belly.
Something jarred me awake. Something loud. There was shouting... I was irritated, couldn’t Vino just bloody get it over with!? Just cut my sodding head off! I was ready!
Moran had known Moriarty. Was he part of his criminal organization? Certainly a man with Moran's skills would be valuable. How had Sherlock not found him when he dismantled Moriarty's web of criminals?
I loved him. I'd loved him for a long time – he was my best mate. He'd saved me from the oppressive emptiness that certainly would have killed me. He'd given me so much! I'd offered my own life in the hope he might escape when we faced off with Moriarty. It was safe to say I loved Sherlock Holmes.
“Did you know,” Moriarty asked contemplatively. “Omegas are only 8% of the population? Alphas make up 39%. Bit of a disparity, that. Especially as there isn’t an Alpha alive that doesn’t want to fuck an Omega in heat. And once you’ve had an Omega, Betas don’t quite cut it anymore, do they, Johnny boy?” Moriarty sniggered unpleasantly. “Your own father always regretted settling for a Beta. Did he ever tell you that?” Moriarty paused a moment, but when John didn’t answer, he went on. “So you see, Johnny, Omegas are a commodity. A very lucrative commodity.”
"No..." Sherlock's vision was blurring. He felt profoundly drunk. "Not John..." He pleaded. "Not John..."
John smiled his relief and pulled the younger man closer, enjoying the way Sherlock melted into his arms. The Omega pressed his nose against John’s neck, inhaling his scent deeply. “Good.” He sighed.
Now she looked convinced that I was a ghoul. I didn’t care. “It'll be one of the overlooks. Maybe five or six K from the house.” She opened a cabinet and pulled out a bag. “I made Welsh cakes.” She announced gesturing at the cooling pastries on the stovetop. She deposited several in to the bag and held it out to me. “Take ‘em.”
Lestrade knew this first hand — he’d been with Sherlock when the bright oceanic blue on his fingertips faded to grey.
"What!?" Shane demanded when Sherlock had dragged him a few feet down the hall. "What do you want?!"
The Alpha grabbed him by the left arm and yanked him from the truck. Sherlock wailed in agony, his shoulder exploding. He stumbled and almost fell to the pavement, fainting with pain, it was only the iron grip of the the big Alpha that kept him upright.
When I was eight years old and being properly bullied I read a book that changed me, changed my circumstances in a profound way. The book was called Wolves Of The American Northwest.
Mycroft opened his mouth to argue, then thought better of it and gazed balefully down at Sherlock. Clearly, he'd made his point.
I kissed him, my fingers in his hair. I was lying on my bed shirtless with my trousers undone and my cock out, next to my best friend, also shirtless, also displaying his prick. I liked him this way – his long, elegant form sprawled on my bed, pale and pink and perfect, smiling at me. Me! Sherlock burned with desire for me!
They got Indian for dinner, again sharing curries, but John stuck to drinking beer. He liked Shane, he was attracted to him, but he wanted to be sober for whatever happened next. He wanted to go in with his eyes open. Or NOT go in. He hadn’t decided.
He felt much calmer now that he was alone with the Omega, no other Alphas competing for him. His heat would start soon, that was obvious by his scent, but until it started, John could relax.
I had listened to John for ages... or so I thought. Listening isn’t something I’m accustomed to – not the way John meant it now. I observe and deduce... which glides over feelings and opinions and lands on facts. But facts have context. And context can be everything.
Lestrade carefully extricated himself and sat up, pausing only to admire the winking gape of his hole. Mycroft met him with a panting kiss, desperate and needy. Lestrade held him tightly, sucking on his tongue and lips, groaning as Mycroft’s hands found his cock and rolled the rubber on it deftly.
Suddenly Church was right behind them, limping and swearing. Sherlock pictured the syringe in his hand ... and the scalpel. He had never missed John and his gun as much as he did right now.
Lestrade stood in the doorway to the en suite loo. Sherlock approached and tasted his true scent: a rich, warm treacle. It was attractive and robust and it suited Lestrade so much better than the generic vanilla of a Beta.
Years later, sitting in his flat in Baker Street, he will remember that time and stare at John Watson as he sleeps in his chair in front of the fireplace. He will know that he will never be tied to that chair again. Someday, something entirely different will tether him into place and remind him to keep himself alive. Not all ties were binding.
His expression dripped in feigned condescension. "Sure, fine, I'll call more often. Terribly sorry to ignore you, I'll do better this year."
Jackie Tyler grinned down at the squirming month old infant in her arms. The last time she'd seen her daughter, Rose had been very pregnant. The little family of three, Rose, the Doctor, and Mycroft, had turned up on her doorstep just yesterday for a visit. The visits were erratic at best, and sometimes not in the right order. They had all been hoping that she would able to see the new baby as soon as possible. So, as a surprise, they had returned only a day later, relative to her timeline at least.
"Hey Sweetheart," the memory said, running her free hand through his hair as though she were addressing a young child instead of a grown man. "Do you want to talk?"
Sherlock popped his collar up over his neck, smiling softly. "Of course. I'm Sherlock Holmes. You're John Watson. The game is on, John. It feels like it has been a long time."
"Please, John," Mycroft said as he walked quickly into the room, shaking a bit of light rain from his umbrella. "Sherlock's never been sick a day in life. You should come up with a better excuse for him."
"To me? Yes. It's best not to get into it— every family has its baggage. Some aunts collect cats, my family tries to either save or destroy the universe."
It was a cheap little picture taken on a roll of film that took years to develop, but thirty years later it was the only personal picture that Sherlock Holmes kept on the dresser in his room. Mycroft had one, hanging in the corner of his office, just out of the way enough to not make people ask questions. Jackie Tyler still kept one copy on her coffee table, displayed so that people would ask questions. In the halls of the TARDIS there hung one copy of the picture, enlarged as high as the old photo would allow.
"You think I'd get up and play, huh?" he asked, pulling his little stuffed hedgehog closer to his chest.
"I'm perfectly aware," she spat, giving one more swing at its face. "Except, next time it'll pick someone else's baby."
"Mycroft means logical thinker and leader," Rose said a bit defensively. "He is both of those things. I stand behind my name choice. You can just call him Mike if you don't like it."
Rose shrugged, finding a warm outfit already laid out for her. One thing she'd come to be used to since running away with the Doctor was being ready to go somewhere on a moment's notice. He'd slowed down a bit once Mycroft was born, but she supposed that now that the boys were getting a little older things had been picking up a bit.
"They are statues only when you see them," he said, his voice very quiet. "Close your eyes, or turn away, and they've got you. Lots of busy streets in London. I don't know why they're here—most likely an accidental shift into space-time. Whatever it was, they must be trapped here. Too many people out there, never time to sneak away without being seen."
"I think I recognize this place," Sherlock murmured. "It'll be an office building someday. A secret one, of course. Mycroft keeps his more private meetings in the middle of bloody nowhere. He's such a drama queen."
"I know, I know," the Doctor sighed. Every day for a month the boys had been having the same argument. Mycroft wanted his privacy more than ever and his brother seemed incapable of letting him have it. "He just wanted to spend some time with you, it's a good thing."
He could hear the absolute frustration ringing in his words. Sherlock looked away from the Doctor, pulling once against the ties. "I'm awake. I'm not going to fall out of the chair. Can you untie me?"
"But you'll be busy negotiating. Mum doesn't understand the software. I know the risks, and I'm old enough to make the choice."
"Of course," he nodded. "Slitheens. Seems like a lifetime ago—well, it was. I had a different face, you were just a teenager—"
"You have to stop bothering your brother. It's okay to be with him during our family time, but he doesn't want to play as much anymore. Mike's getting older, he has his mind on other things."
The Doctor stared at John in amazement. "Wow. Do you have any idea how fast he usually jumps in the TARDIS when I come to pick him up? He's doesn't like to be anywhere without Rose. Who are you?"
John rubbed the bridge of his nose. "Why would I want to leave, Sherlock? Why would I want you to leave?"
"She's doing well, but she wishes we would visit the old flat more. We're going to get an earful for missing Christmas again."
John spun around, enough anger on his face to make even Sherlock stop talking. "I don't know why, I really don't, but after everything that's happened with Moriarty, and Baskervilles, and the cabbie, I actually thought we were friends."
