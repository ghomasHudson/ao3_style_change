John grinned lazily back. “Just take off the robe.”
Quickly, Sherlock slips out of his pants, leaving them where they land at his feet.
“John.”
They sit across the table from one another, cups of tepid but strong coffee at their elbows, sharing their findings in hushed  academic tones. It’s nearly intimate—the shuffle of paper, a quietly-uttered “Hm, look at this,” the passing of files, fingertips brushing in a way that would have been absolutely innocent if there hadn’t been years of similar, sought-after touches in their shared history.
A short train ride later and he was ascending the course, chatting idly with a female athlete from Sweden about wind conditions. Like this, he was on autopilot; the inane chatter flowed from him without much thought. His gaze was fixed on the course below, the red flags peeking from the crest of curves and the orange netting flanking the entire run.
Blood pulsed through his veins, slicking into and out of his heart; his body waiting for the moment when the muscle would beat double, triple, the adrenaline satisfying his seemingly undying craving.
When he comes to this time around, it’s mid-afternoon and the dog is standing next to the bed, staring at him, as though he’s excited to tell Sherlock what’s happened at the shop. Sherlock hates himself momentarily for making Redbeard stay in for as long as he has, and tears himself from the bed. He locates a pair of loose sweatpants, boxer briefs, a vest and a sweatshirt and pulls them all on as he fumbles through the flat to the front door. “Come on, I’ll make it up to you,” and Redbeard trots right up to him and they head out.
Sherlock peered down at it, and slid his own atop John’s. “It’ll keep.”
“The flat in Islington is just…” John had tried to argue, but the withering look Sherlock had given him had stoppered up the last of his feeble arguments. With a huff of resignation, John had simply asked when it would be possible for he and Rosie to move in properly.
After their lengthy bath and a rinse, they nestled down beside one another and were out almost immediately as their heads hit the pillows. When they awoke four hours later, John checked Sherlock’s taped ribs and John taught Sherlock how to properly look over his injuries, then they had a bit of a lazy snog until John determined it was time for them to get up and get ready to go out.
, Sherlock had responded.
He’s well into his forties, and he hasn’t felt like this—buoyant, expectant, petrified—in an age. Not with Mary, not before, not since his secondary school days, and even that is fleeting. Now, John feels cleft in two, like he’s empty and opening and wanting Sherlock to mend him back together, fill him up.
John unclipped his seatbelt and turned his body towards Sherlock, pushing up the seat arm and allowing himself more space. Shoulders square, he appeared to be gearing up for a fight, or to defend himself; Sherlock couldn’t tell which. “Cross, and biathlon a few times.”
“And you chose me to start?”
He’s stunned when Sherlock shrugs, smiles and stands; for a moment he’s relieved, but then Sherlock moves to the table in front of him and takes a seat facing John, smiling serenely all the while. “Not what I meant,” John says, but Sherlock just presses his lips together and raises his brows in a silent
“I am.”
John swallows, takes a step back from the gurney. If he’s being followed by the newspapers, he must be someone of interest. John scratches at the back of his neck, making a mental note to try and catch up on some of the more recent happenings in London. “I didn’t realize, I didn’t know-”
He saw John across the expansive space, chatting with one of the mogul coaches, and John gave him a half wave in goodbye, to which Sherlock dipped his head in acknowledgement. It was a blessing that the flight had landed when it had; he wasn’t sure he could afford himself the distraction of puzzling over John Watson any further. He had the course to think of and gold to strive for; he had to set his sights firmly on getting on the top of that podium.
Sherlock can’t help the bite that in his voice--the impatience that’s always there--but it’s not as malicious as he perhaps could be. Pursing his lips, John steps forward and looks down at the cup. “Black?”
The water turns a pleasant amber, and John feels the last of his muscles unwind. He picks up the book and begins reading, losing himself for a long while before the water goes tepid. He’s sleepy and pliant, and when he puts the book down, it takes him a few moments for his eyes to adjust.
“Ah,” John says, understanding, though is halted from further speech by Sherlock’s interruption.
A response comes a moment later.
“Yes,” he chuckled, peeking his tongue out to just slick over John’s right lobe. “Oh, indeed. Let’s go catch ourselves a criminal, John.”
Sherlock is busy reclining on the sofa and wondering what he’d like John5NF to think of
Sherlock rests his cheek against the top of John’s head and smooths his thumbs down over the curve of John’s shoulders. It’s a long few minutes before either speaks, both seemingly too content to simply bask in the gentle moment. “We should finish up.”
But Sherlock surged forward and cut John abruptly off, their mouths crashing together. After a moment, he pulled back, leaving John wide-eyed and gaping, Sherlock curled a palm around the back of John’s neck and brought their foreheads together. “I know. I know, just… shut up. I can’t think, I need to think...”
Sherlock huffs, tugging off his tie and throwing it as far across the room as he can manage. It lands just scant feet away, fluttering sadly to the floor. He shirks of his suit jacket and treats it with more care, draping it across the back of a chair before he half-flounces, half-stomps across the room towards the bed. “The wind. They’ve had to postpone the giant slalom
John, and then striped his tongue from the back of John’s testicles up and over the center of him in one, long pass. John’s hips hitched forward and he swore loudly, almost immediately pressing his thighs and buttocks back on the pillow, desperate for more. Sherlock obliged, settling down on his elbows and pressing in.
“Yes.”
John5NF must be, and then realizes that he too is in the same boat.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, turns his head, speaks the response very quietly, over his shoulder. “Nine. At Speedy’s.”
Sherlock glances down at John’s body, his eyes wavering before their gazes meet again. “You’re leaving those on?”
John takes a breath and nods once, “Mmm hmm.” When he comes to stand in front of Sherlock, he takes another breath, reaches out and wraps his fingers around Sherlock’s wrists. “This is… god, I’m gonna be shit at this. You won’t mind, will you?”
“Now relax and think,” John urged and continued his massage, keeping his touch firm and therapeutic. He worked off Sherlock’s trainers and dropped them to the floor. Sherlock peeked one eye open--a bit stunned to notice that he’d let them close to begin with--and watched John’s face as he began pressing into the arch of his left foot.
He sits back, feeling light but still dealing with shocks of anticipation in his belly; Sherlock contemplates tea, decides that would take too much work, remembers he has to walk Redbeard and then gets up and puts the kettle on anyway.
John takes a step back, crosses his arms over his chest; he finds it a bit more difficult to do with the lab coat on. “Risk?”
it read in swooping, curly letters.
There was a tense moment when a fissure of something dangerous ran through Moriarty’s gaze and no one moved. Sherlock stared him down and he stared back, a silent promise made in the gaze. “Don’t forget,” he said, batting his eyelashes. “I owe you.” Moriarty then gave a ridiculous bow and then spun on heel back to his minions, leaving Lestrade to shake his head and turn to face Sherlock.
Sherlock almost smiled; even if he wasn’t exactly in the proper headspace, his team certainly was. He found himself an empty stall and began tugging on his Lycra, pausing to appreciate how snugly it fit his body. This was a singular sensation he was sure he would miss, the idea that he was one long line from the crown of his head to the tips of his toes, that he was held together, bound by this suit. Sherlock sighed as he adjusted the wrists and the ankles and tugged on his Olympic vest.
“That a threat?” Sally asks, still not backing down–
And then there are the feelings, too. The amorphous but ever-present pressure in John’s chest, something like love but feeling like more, something wholly and ridiculously indescribable. He doesn’t know where he is, doesn’t know where they stand, but here they are, going through their shared history together, deciding what remains and what goes.
“Yeah, sod the press,” John said lazily with a shrug.
Sherlock blinks, gives a half nod, takes a step back on the pavement and looks up at the awning. He finds, suddenly, that he cannot possibly move forward. Molly too takes a step back, glances at him, at the awning and gives him a pitying little half smile.
“Silly me, yes! Of course, I can forward you along all of the information if you leave me your email? Pay, NHS nonsense, all of that.” Harried, she sticks her hand in the breast pocket of her lab coat and when she extracts it, a few tissues float to the floor, but she’s managed to present John with one of her business cards. “Just write it on that. Or keep that and email me and I’ll email you back or--”
“Like this?” Sherlock asks.
Sherlock frowned, and licked his lips. He had his stock answer, his cold, controlled, post-race diatribe. But it was the last time he’d be giving an interview like this, and truth be told, things
“Mmm, yeah, have you ever?” John asks, dipping his hand into the spray to test the temperature.
Sherlock read and reread the note, the words filtering through his brain slowly. Eyes sliding closed, he crumpled the note in his hand and crawled up onto the bed, over his things, and curled onto the pillow. He wound his arms around the mass of cotton and down tightly, squeezing it hard.
“I know it is,” Sherlock says, gentler than before, a tiny smile playing on his lips.
John is quiet, the stem of his wine glass situated in the vee of his fore and middle fingers and he drags it slowly back and forth across the table. He inhales and sits back a bit, “Is that something you want?”
Sherlock kept his upper teeth slotted hard into his bottom lip, hips giving aborted little thrusts into John’s palm. “I,” Sherlock whispered, throat closing as John slicked his fingers just
It’s as easy as that, their first kiss becomes their second and third.
Another shrug, “I trust you know how to properly disinfect it.”
John shakes his head with a bitter laugh. “You’re such a bastard, an absolute bastard. Can’t imagine who’d want you to begin with.”
It was a risk he couldn’t afford. he needed
“Much better,” he announced as he walked around to the other side of the bed, comfortable in his nudity, and climbed on, reaching out immediately to bring Sherlock’s mouth to his. They kissed languidly, John allowing Sherlock to take the upper hand after a moment, bending to Sherlock’s demanding body as it draped over his own. John maneuvered down on the bed until his head rested firmly in the middle of a pillow, Sherlock’s body hovering just above his.
“Well,” John said, a little breathless, with a half smile tipping his mouth. “I don’t want to sound too eager but… oh god, yes.”
He responds.
“I do know Elena Piscante,” Greg said after a time, crossing his arms over his chest. “She sits on the Executive Board,” Greg fell silent for a moment, head bobbing back and forth as he considered. “I suppose if we knew anyone on the Ethics Commission that would be best but-”
Sherlock, for his part, was caught up by John’s response.
John takes a deep breath, blows it out between his teeth.
different, he just couldn’t put his finger on it.
He shakes his head, leans in, close to Sherlock’s face, and meets his eyes. “Could just… stare at this all day.”
“Greg is my ex-coach and Molly is a member of my prep team,” Sherlock explained, slowly losing what little patience he had left.
He steers away from the tender, painful reality of their mutual pining, tries for another truth, “I want you to…” He takes a breath, acknowledges that this conversation is a mess, but thinks it’s important that Sherlock knows, “You saved my life, you know that.”
Sherlock places his own chopsticks down and blots daintily at his lips. When he pulls away, he assesses John for a long moment, during which John feel as though he’s being stealthily stripped apart. It’s unsettling but not entirely unpleasant. He finds that he wants to know what
“John,” Sherlock says, deprecatingly. It hurts a bit to hear, it hurts a bit to say.
John considers for a moment. He doesn’t want to ask about pay or hours, and this all feels so informal that it rings a bit “too good to be true.” Still, he’s speaking to the head technician and she’s offering him a paying job, putting his medical training to use. It’s not a sham, she doesn’t want to know about what he did in the past, Mike’s word seems to be enough and she appears to be intelligent and sweet, but beyond that,
John sniffed and looked out over Sherlock’s shoulder. “Yeah, well, we have to, don’t we? Can’t let him get away with that.”
John raised a single brow. “You’re saying we should attempt to pick it?”
But Sherlock knows better. From the appraising glance to the acceptance of the coffee, Sherlock can tell that John Watson will forgive him, and shortly. Sherlock gives John another once over of his own, notes that though the button up he’s wearing is in a terrible print, he has a fit body and broad shoulders. He notes too that John is hovering close to forty, used to play rugby, and is stubborn and fiercely loyal. He is rather what people would call a “good bloke.”
It sounds like something out of a spy movie. “And how long did that take you?” John asks, leaning forward with interest.
Sherlock Holmes eyed the crowd before him with an aloofness that had taken him years to cultivate. Stretched out in his chair, legs crossed at the ankle, he observed the excited faces of people who each harbored secret hopes of gold; it was a pity there were so few elite athletes amongst his delegation. It would be a miracle if anyone but himself managed to medal.
John looked deep in concentration, reviewing the offerings carefully, running his finger alongside as he read. “Yeah this doesn’t… not a lot of this makes sense.”
A quick little sip of air sucks in through his nose and then John is slowly releasing it; it takes some effort now to huff it out through his mouth. He couldn’t have anticipated this—what he would do in this moment, how he would forget to breathe, how his mind would stutter and stop even as his stomach flipped a dozen times.
At the bottom was a single, stark,
Yet still, even after his spectacular losses and public persona issues, they were calling him the ‘Distinguished Dynamo,’ a name that had stuck due to the trademark smart suits that he favored over the traditional athletic-wear of his peers. He would do the morning interviews in tailored Dolce and Gabbana while the snowboarders would show up bedraggled and donning their patriotic, puffy coats, long hair untamed. The ice dancers would look prim and proper but lacked his flair and eye for fashion.
“It’s not a lack of people skills,” Lestrade mumbled under his breath, and paced once across the room in a meandering line, shaking his head while his arms were still crossed over his chest. He dragged his hands down over his face. “You’re just a dick.”
“Both. Just not the face!”
“Ohhh, NBC, I’d be upset that they gathered us all together to show us off if we weren’t all so attractive,” is how Adam Rippon-voice somehow withering but iengaging— introduces himself to Sherlock.
“If you’d not come—”
He feels foolish and unhinged and he tears his gaze away from the clock and settles it instead on the paper that he’d been half-heartedly reading since he arrived. “Refit for Historic Hospital”, “Auto Accident Kills Two”, “Tottenham Set to Take On Chelsea”, read the headlines, but nothing appeals. He’s about to flip the paper and begin the crossword when the bell above the door tolls and John can’t help but look up.
“Back at- back at the Village?” Sherlock abhorred repeating himself, and here he was, doing it unconsciously.
, I’ll defer to his advice, you letch.” Just then there was another, quieter cheer as John walked into the bar. Molly made to get up but Greg patted her on the shoulder and went to bring John over to the table.
Sherlock blinked twice in rapid succession, his mouth falling open in shock, and then he shook his head as he broke into a grin, falling forward a bit to rest his palms on his thighs. “Oh my god,” he whispered to himself.
But the ten days in Spain had been refreshing for them. Sherlock had made good on his promise to tend to John’s wounds while in Barcelona, and John had begrudgingly let him. He bathed and soothed John in a private villa on the outskirts of the city. Incognito, they walked the cobblestone streets by night and had their fill of fine food and wine; they made slow, careful love on a private balcony beneath the stars.
, but it didn’t feel quite right.
A moment later Redbeard hops up and Sherlock lifts his cocoon so that the dog can join him. “I hope you’re not in a rush to get outside because I fully intend to remain here for quite some time.” He doesn’t really want to go back to sleep, but he doesn’t exactly want to get up, either. Redbeard doesn’t respond, but plonks his wet nose in the crook of Sherlock’s elbow and settles in.
“No.”
Unfortunately, outside of actually meeting Guest and seeing where it goes (and what is
“You couldn’t get him off of the skis once he strapped in. Before you knew it we were spending half of the year in Austria so he could train,” his mother, a dynamo in ladies sprints in the 1970s, tells us. “My boy was always a thrill seeker, on the slopes and in his studies. He works very hard, often to the detriment of other areas of his life; I just hope it’s enough to bring him the gold in Sochi.”
Sherlock’s body tensed, neck going taut, and he slammed his head back against the headboard but registered no pain; Sherlock’s right hand dug into John’s hip while the other clamped down hard around John’s fingers. He came in wringing waves, his torso straining up, trying to get closer to John, to burrow inside, lose himself in John’s body. He gasped for breath, sucked in deep lungfuls of air and then cried out as John’s body gripped him and wrung the last of the pleasure from him as he shivered and bucked, verging on oversensitive.
In a flash he darted off of the bed and turned on the lamp, revealing a mass of sickeningly yellow gerberas, and only yellow gerberas, no filler at all. Sherlock nearly had to shield his eyes for the violent color of it as he stepped forward and plucked the card off of the display.
“Boss, I’m so proud of you,” and then she was pressing her mouth against his in a kiss. “After all these years, oh Sherlock, oh I’m just so proud, and John! And you found John! And!”
The answering smile that lit John’s face was a bit bashful, a bit self-deprecating. “Want to have the mysterious Sherlock Holmes all to myself a little longer.”
John puffed hot breath onto his cheek as Sherlock searched for words. “Right. You feel… god, John,
Now, when the clerk winks at John, John just smiles back, waiting until Sherlock sees his reaction before hefting his bag over his arm.
John goes to his stomach and presses his face in, fully, Sherlock arse pressing against his cheeks as John laps and presses, teases at his rim until Sherlock is wriggling against the pillow beneath him. There’s a smile then, right against Sherlock’s body, and maybe Sherlock feels it, because he lets out a tortured groan and thrusts his hips backward, knocking John off course.
at all.
Sherlock’s left cheek jumps in a bashful smile. “Yes, it was… good.”
knows that
“Gonna be alright?” John asks, head tipped forward, gazing at Sherlock from beneath his lashes. “You good?”
“Don’t be stupid.” He leaned back on the hightop behind him, elbows resting on the slick wood, and pretended to observe the scene around him; he wasn’t searching for the reappearance of a blond head in the crowd - that would be insane.
“Because…” John licks his lips and straightens up to face Sherlock, crosslegged now too and close still. His back and hips will hurt like a bitch tomorrow given the odd position he’s seated in, but he doesn’t give much of a toss at present. He fixes Sherlock with a clean and open gaze. “Any longer could be too late and I…don’t want to miss this. Miss you.”
to know whatever half-caf, double whip, soy whatever that you order, wouldn’t they?”
“What?” Sherlock prompted, a soft smile tugging at his mouth.
“Hah, no, nice try, now get up, it’s got to take you ages to fix that hair.” John made a vague gesture towards Sherlock’s head and pulled on his trousers.
Sherlock doesn’t look at him but maneuvers to pour a bit of the epsom salt he keeps beneath the sink into the tub. “You should undress,” he says, and disappears quickly, through the door to his room.
My thanks to
“I’m glad. That we finally.” He shrugs the best he can, on his side. “I’m glad for it.”
“But if he doesn’t know, we can continue to correspond.” He says aloud. Except, John might not want to now that he’s been stood up. Sherlock has done a terrible thing, broken John’s trust, made him feel unwanted.
“Thank you for inviting me.” John took a step back, inching his way towards the door. It was something to behold, and Sherlock’s chest seized up with affection; John didn’t want to leave him, just as much as Sherlock desperately wished he could stay. Now wasn’t the time, however, and if they played their cards right, they’d have much, much more time together once the Games were through.
Sherlock caught the edge with the crook of his index finger just in time, “Hm?”
“Jesus,” John laughs again, loud, tilts his head back and glances up at the ceiling before tipping it back to make eye contact with Sherlock. “Course it’s a yes. Yeah, let’s do it.”
Rolling his eyes, Sherlock struggles over onto his other side, tossing a humor-laced, “You’re impossible,” over his shoulder.
“Needless, just… horrific. You wouldn’t expect something like that at, at the Olympics and I just…” John blinked up at him, eyes unfocused, a little lost, and Sherlock felt something shatter inside of him.
“Well,” Sherlock says, peering down at the body. “Yes.”
that they’d broken in, Sherlock was certain they’d left no evidence. He was sure there had been no surveillance. There was no proof.
John’s eyes lit with recognition and his head hung for a moment before he propped it back up. “Ah, the rumors?”
“No,” he says, as though the notion is entirely preposterous, as though he hadn’t brought it up in the first place.
Sherlock felt the hand that was at his shoulder pull away and after a moment, it rested on his waist. “Great, thank you Greg,” John said with sincerity.
John blinks first in confusion, and then in surprise. “How in the world would I get into a bath?”
“It is that part, yeah,” John says dryly, managing to refrain from rolling his eyes.
“Cake and champagne. To celebrate,” John affirms and together they fall into a light sleep.
“Romantic,” John hummed. “But Sherlock, you know I don’t-”
Sherlock takes Redbeard for a short walk, grabbing himself a latte with an extra shot beforehand. They meander around St. James’ Park and then Sherlock checks on the tongues again, showers, shaves and dresses for the day. He takes special care to adorn himself in his most striking ensemble. He leaves the top two buttons of his plum shirt open and forgoes the blazer that he would normally wear.
Lestrade’s affirmative confirmation caused much of the tension to drain from Sherlock’s body and he found himself excited as he made his way over to where Philip had laid out his skis. They were gleaming in the sunshine, the man slicking a cloth over the surface one final time. “One final check of all of the equipment, please,” Sherlock directed.
“Sherlock, damn, are you and he- I mean, are you and John…” Swiping a hand over his face, he secured the other at the swell of his hip and locked his gaze on a point just beyond Sherlock’s right shoulder. “Is this a thing?”
Instead of taking the compliment, her eyes narrow and she clutches around the strap of her bag. “What… what’s going on? You’re being...nice.”
“I could—” The range of emotions that play out on Sherlock’s face, that have played out on Sherlock face in just the past hour, knock the wind out of John. “—assist you.”
“Oi!” John barked and slapped Sherlock’s pectoral with the back of his hand. “Watch it. I’m helping you, you colossal dick.”
The chaos of the past few days melted away and Sherlock could see the course for what it was, its raw angles and jumps. He was doing what he was
“For us,” John corrects, seriously. He reaches over to squeeze Sherlock’s shoulder once, and holds Sherlock’s elbow as they turn towards a photographer asking for a photo.
, drinks four glasses of water and checks his email while his toothbrush sticks out of his mouth.
Greg laughed and Sherlock’s mouth perked up at John’s bashful but kind attitude. Settling his forearms on the table, he began to relax and took a sip from his drink.
Sherlock’s eyes flickered open as he recalled the bright glint in John’s eye even as he warned Sherlock of the possible repercussions of investigating, even as he acknowledged the risks they would face.
John’s thumb finds a nipple just as the pad of Sherlock’s swipes against the head of his own prick and that throws John off, he stutters and stills. “Jesus, s’not gonna take long, then,” he says as though to himself, in wonder.
John meandered through the crowd and elbowed his way to the bar; Greg was silent next to Sherlock until the crush of people effectively enveloped John and he was out of sight.
Everything was silent, though there was a flurry of action all around him. To his immense relief, none of the skiers in the hut seemed keen to speak with him about what had happened. Though he had obviously been through a great ordeal as evidenced by his slight limp and liberal bruising, they gave him a wide berth as he prepared.
“More,” John croaked after a moment and Sherlock’s breath left him in one, long heave of exhalation. With his free hand he palmed the lubricant and slicked up the crease of John’s arse, the fluid sliding down to pool around Sherlock’s finger. With care, Sherlock pulled out right to the tip and sank slowly back in, the resistance he felt giving way after a few strokes.
They hobble into the loo and Sherlock deposits John onto the toilet and turns on the taps. “I’ll just...” Sherlock begins, and disappears. John can hear his tread, faster than usual, carrying him up the steps to John’s room. As he waits, John considers the fact that he’s not worried about Sherlock rooting around his room, he’s not worried that Sherlock knows exactly what to bring back down so that John may bathe properly. He’s not worried at all about how well Sherlock knows him.
and it was brave and I’m proud of you for that. For being… a role model—god help us all—to LGBT kids who think they
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “Bring Molly with you, then. At the moment he’s still at the athletic complex with his… crew. By my estimation he’ll be there another hour or so, depending whether he uses the steam room. I need to know when he leaves, the minute he leaves, no later.”
He took his time in the showers, standing with his head ducked down under the spray for long minutes while other people came and went. The pounding, rushing water beat any remaining thoughts from his head and he felt some of the tension flake mercifully away. He had days to get focused on his upcoming race; right now he needed to try to center himself. Thoughts of John, of his ski team, of the flight to Russia and every step he’d taken to get where he was still pressed at him though he did his best to let them go, if only for the time being.
“Sounds,” John chews while he searches for a word. “Exciting.”
In time, the pilot came over the PA and instructed them all to return their seatbacks to an upright position and direct their attention to the front of the plane for a demonstration of the onboard safety practices. Sherlock hazarded a glance to his right, slightly surprised to see that John still had his eyes closed, though he had moved his seat. He wasn’t sure why he was so shocked; Sherlock knew nothing about the man but he’d been so sure that he was the type to follow the rules.
Once fully good and wet, John uncaps the small hotel bottle and squeezes a bit of the citrus-scented gel into his hands. “Now, c’mere.”
His legs bounced impatiently as he huffed out a giant gust of breath loudly enough to disturb the woman sitting three seats to his right. She turned and blinked at him patiently, waiting for him to acknowledge her. Sherlock kept his gaze resolutely forward although he could feel the woman’s eyes on him. After a moment she spoke, her voice amused and light, “We board in ten minutes, Holmes, cool it.”
,” Adam says, clicking on the speech bubble, pivoting away as he begins typing furiously on his phone.
“Is there anything,
It’s a crazy thought, he knows it is. But then, maybe he’s going a little bit crazy. Maybe he’s just perpetually
Sherlock leaned close to John’s end of the sofa. “What?”
“But-”
John went straight-backed and conspicuously silent while Greg leaned back on his stool and grinned. “You two shared a room… and John’s still alive…”
“But inappropriate is okay,” John interjects. “I…didn’t mean it like that,” John laughs, hiding his mouth behind his wine glass and cringing.
“You’re proud, but you carry it in a way that speaks to your abilities and not false imaginings you have of yourself. You’ve a surgeon’s hands though you’ve clearly not performed surgery in years and yet you chose to stay within the medical profession. Oftentimes when surgeons suffer conditions that cause them to lose their dexterity they eschew medicine entirely. Yet, you stay. You’re a thrill seeker, already having told me about your days as a biathlete. Between that and the army it’s clear to see why you’re here; you want a change of pace, something exciting that you can’t predict. And, the chance to help people with potentially serious injuries, nasty injuries skiers endure.”
.” John crooned and crossed to it, picking up the small box and examining the contents.
: Please don’t.
Pressing his tongue into his front teeth in consternation, he reconsidered. John was a smart man, a strong man, a man of very obvious reserve. He could trust John to make that decision for himself, couldn’t he? Or, Sherlock wondered, was he just being selfish in hoping that John realized the obstacles to being Sherlock’s friend and simply chose not to allow that to stop him?
“Better than saying you’re a difficult pain in the rear, isn’t it?” Molly asks innocently and steps delicately into the elevator. “Lunch?”
Head flopping back dramatically, Sherlock turns to glance at him, “I told her that you like baths, so she got those for you.”
He huffs out his annoyance and unlocks his phone, looks at John5NF’s email and wonders
far too personal. The bit about Redbeard, that had felt too much as well, but he’d had such a fantastic day--two tongues!--that he’d let his buoyant mood get the best of him. He’d told a complete stranger about his dog, the one thing in the world that he truly cared about.
John licked his lips, raised a brow and glanced back at Sherlock, who dipped his head as he grinned. They both got up out of the booth and headed towards Greg and Molly on the shadowy dance floor.
...someone he apparently despised.
“You’ve said something now,” Sherlock murmurs, regaining eye contact. “You were the brave one. I’m… very glad for it.”
a drinker.”
date, in fact. That was something you said when you wanted to see the other person again.
Sherlock narrows his gaze.
“Listen, idiot, whether or not you think so, that was
“But!” Sherlock spoke up as Moran drew his leg back, preparing for another kick, the trajectory this time looking to be aimed at Sherlock’s face. He trained his voice, tried not to sound too desperate for Moran to buy what he was about to say. “Everyone knows who you are! Everyone knows what you do for him, what you are for him, Sebastian. A hired hand! A thug! You think he won’t sell you out the moment he smells trouble? Do you think you’re not expendable to him?”
John shrugs, taking a step back. “Well, well. Yeah, sorry about this one. He tends to, you know, not remember things that aren’t directly related to him.”
Officials are already dazzled at Moriarty’s prowess on the slopes, but many wonder if he truly has what it takes to podium over the British dynamo. Asked just minutes off of his training run best, Holmes claimed that his approach was better than anyone else’s. “I have no qualms about this course, I just have to tighten my form in some spots. The Russian Trampoline in particular is a killer.”
“Very good.”
Sherlock finds himself restless; it’s not a new experience, but he’s strangely on edge, now. He returns back to his flat and feeds Redbeard, scratches out a few more bars on the composition he’s undertaken, and actually removes the various items in the refrigerator that are too far gone to salvage.
John frowns, rolls his eyes and blows out a breath. “I’m sorry. I think we… no, we definitely got off on the wrong foot.”
“Okay?” John checks, resuming the gentle strokes there, and when Sherlock nods sluggishly, John repeats the gesture, even more gentle.
little pets, how
“Are you kidding?’ John chuckled indignantly,. They’d traveled together plenty, already, and Sherlock tended to be a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants type of traveller. Most of the responsibilities on that front had fallen to John.  “First off, I’m not packing for you.”
Sherlock answered him with a glare, testing the give of the boots in the straps and sliding the skis once through the snow to test the resistance. “Nearly fainted when I saw that picture by the way,” Lestrade poked fun, sipping at his coffee. “Didn’t know you had enough room in yah for all of that food.”
“He’s… yeah, he’s a bit late,” John concedes.
To his credit, Greg didn’t take very long to compose himself, instantly going to his knees by John and working at his bindings with shaky hands. “You two, you
There’s three minutes before John receives a reply, and he waits with bated breath for it. It’s so strange, how much he’s enjoying emailing someone. The anonymity of it all is somehow appealing to him. Reconnecting with Mike had been brilliant and he’d enjoyed interacting with Molly, but this was nice in a different way.
John follows up a moment later with,
to consider it and so he doesn’t, instead banishing the thought and roughly tugging his mobile from his trouser pocket.
Face in the bed, Sherlock groans, attempting not to rock his hips back into John’s face.
“There a problem here?” And suddenly Greg Lestrade was between Sherlock and Moriarty, chest puffed out, hands on his hips, a threat.
“I can focus on two things at once, John,” came his slightly clipped reply. “I do have that ability.”
John is exhilarated, and pulls away panting, thrilled to find Sherlock heaving breaths just as heavily as he is. “God,” John says, touching his mouth to ensure that this all is actually happening.
Once he’d realized the depth of his feelings, figuring out how to live with unrequited love was an impossible endeavor, one that was steadily wearing away at him, making him brittle with impatience. Every day it feels as though he’s slowly suffocating, drawn under by the weight of his wanting. For a man of action, John isn’t at all sure how to proceed.
“You,” he answered softly. “I didn’t expect you.”
“Me specifically, and yes, they do, but they still like talking about that gorgeous face.” John reaches out and lightly smacks Sherlock’s face with his palm. “Bad press is bad for all of us, is what I’m trying to say. You can talk shite about everyone to me, just don’t take it too far, yeah? Try and be amiable? In public? For me.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at John; there had been a few pieces in the sporting magazine after his broken-ribs incident, mostly quotes from the bystanders who had heard the way he’d treated the course medics when they came to attend him on the slope.
“Too bad,” John said and smacked him playfully on the behind. “Now, get in the tub, you utter arse.”
“Move in with me,” Sherlock said again, with a shy but giddy smile.  “Your bedsit is tiny and depressing-”
He may not sleep, but John finds himself relaxing, melting into the mattress and finding comfort in this bed, next to the man he’s finally begining to build with, again.
The woman at the register sighs, though her cheeks color a bit. She’s always been a bit enamored with him, even if she tries to hide it with her twenty-something nonchalance. “Yep, again. We’re only doing cash orders,” she directs to Sherlock and then turns her attention back to John. “I’m really sorry, sir.”
Casually, he takes a sip, and then his eyes widen at the glass. “That…is actually the best wine I’ve ever had,” John takes another sip, savoring it, and then leans back against his seat, smiles. “All of that deducing, knowing what people are, who they are, it’s fascinating. Must be a helpful skill to have.”
“Are you, that is to say, there was Mary and Sarah and, that one with the hair and the other one with the eczema, but.” Sherlock’s eyes flash. “There were never any… men.”
Sherlock glared petulantly and kept his lips tightly locked, to which John gave a short chuckle, continuing on. “Well, if that’s the case, seems you and I, we’re
something, that he was more invested in John getting out of this alive than he himself ever seeing the light of day again. Sherlock stopped short at admitting just that, not wanting to give Moran the extra bait if he divulged just how deeply he felt.
“Only mild bibimbap,” Sherlock swore, hand over his heart.
“Nothing for me,” Sherlock murmured, seemingly engrossed in the coverage on the television.
Sherlock took a seat towards the back, against the window. On long flights he found he could zone out and retreat to his mind, review his runs on various courses, dissect ways to attack the course ahead. He didn’t sleep but he would close his eyes and relax into it, the hum of the plane assisting in drawing him from reality and sharpening his focus.
John has to lean back, as his back begins to act up, but he takes Sherlock with him. They sink into it, this, their second kiss, and it turns warm and slow and lovely. It feels simultaneously like the most natural thing that has happened to him, and also the most important.
is all it reads and John ignores the blinking walk signal and shuffles back out of the way of passersby.
He took a deep breath and held it in his chest. This was the culmination of his life’s work; this was what he’d toiled so hard for. This is what he’d put his body through hell for.  Sherlock felt the cool metal beneath his right hand and it was a struggle not to curl his fingers around it.
“If you could all just perk up a bit that would be grand,” he said. “This is my last Olympics and… and as such I feel it necessary to make known that… you’ve all been invaluable to me. So, please, if you could focus on the task at hand now, as you always have, and not the dire circumstances that one of our own has suffered that would be…”
They’d spoken with an architect–recommended, strangely enough, by Anderson–and they’d begun working with him shortly after the explosion. The floor plan was to be open, another bedroom added where the den had once been, the fireplace restored. John had only needed moderate convincing to agree to move into the space.
Sweat rolled over his temples and the hollow of his back; he felt it soak through the front of his shirt. It felt
He drags himself outside and hails a cab, wanting to head downtown and speak with his network before badgering Molly and Lestrade again. He pops out at St. Paul’s and sets his sights on the nearest coffee shop.
“Kindly,” Sherlock growled, without looking at John, “do not mother me.”
Sherlock’s voice is his normal cadence and tone when he continues on, “I’ve never particularly enjoyed the idea of yearning after a straight man, but I don’t believe it would have done me any good if I’d labored under the assumption that you could be attracted to me sexually. You’d always dated women.”
“William,” John states, though it’s a question.
Sherlock’s right cheek jumps briefly in something John would guess might be a smirk. “I’ve not ranked them.”
“Tcha,” a disbelieving laugh. “That was a bit of a cock up on my part, making you think… making you believe that and not telling you how I really, you know, felt. Big cock up. Huge… cock up.”
We hope Holmes is right. He’s posted faster-than-normal times on his home course and seems more limber  than usual, something many seasoned downhill competitors struggle to maintain later in their careers. The International Ski Federation spokesman Gian-Franco Kasper claims that Holmes is one of the most graceful and composed competitors he has ever seen. “Gold is within his grasp for sure, if he keeps his ego in check,” Kasper tells us. “He’s got such command over any course, it’s really quite something.”
me? What am I, a detective?”
Closing his eyes, he replays every second of the interaction, from John’s initial scowl to the very last blink and he
to know Japanese.
“Ah, Molly, do you have the newest goggles, the ones I’ve yet to try?” he asked, moving efficiently around the area until he found the bench next to where his gear was prepared. She came up beside him belatedly, reaching into one of his sleek gear bags to produce the goggles.
John pondered that and stepped back from Sherlock, bottom lip caught between his teeth as he paced the room aimlessly. Sherlock slunk over to the sofa and tossed himself out on it, his body suddenly making him aware that he’d just put it through enormous physical exertion; he groaned and stretched, attempting to find a comfortable position.
Lips pursed, Sherlock’s face withers; he had assumed that Lestrade understood that he wasn’t interested in things of that nature. Apparently, he’d put far too much faith in the man. “Not… really my area.”
It’s one of his usual places, and this particular Costa makes--in Sherlock’s estimation--the best espresso of the lot. He makes his way through the early morning stragglers, standing about with their beverages and saunters up and into the queue.
A response comes a few minutes later,
: Liver temperature indicated that the victim had been dead no more than an hour.
If you’re someone that’s bored easy, well, maybe we shouldn’t meet. Nothing to write home about on this end.
talking about him.
Sherlock smiles at that, he lights right up. “Seen a lot of injuries then. Violent deaths.”
His skin felt stiff and starchy and he distantly recalled that he hadn’t had the chance to moisturize after his run on the slopes; he’d need to get into his room as soon as possible, go through his routine,
The layout was rather open, though there were beams and support columns that looked randomly placed. While Sherlock was busy taking in the interior, John ducked around him. “I’ll sweep the house.”
“That,” John corrected, glancing at the people around him. “Wasn’t just me.”
The final of the men’s downhill will be aired on Thursday evening at 8:00pm on NBC Sports and local NBC affiliates.
of letting John down, of hurting him.
Complying, Sherlock snags a pillow and stacks it beneath his hips, after which John almost immediately settles his palms against the globes of his arse. “Bit higher,” he directs and Sherlock reaches out to shove another pillow beneath himself.
“Please, you’re high maintenance and don’t try to deny it.”
Falling in love with Sherlock Holmes had been so incredibly simple. It was so natural that he was unable to recall just how it happened. He realized that it had been there all along, slowly enveloping him in its glow. How he yearned to touch the skin of Sherlock’s neck above the collar of his pajama top; he wanted to explain how desperately he wanted to know the contents of Sherlock’s heart and to allow his own heart to spill open before Sherlock. The desire to give word and touch to his love was almost painful in strength.
, Sherlock mused, and slid down in the bath until the tip of his nose touched the water.
There’s a beat of silence and then John is glaring up at him. “Excuse me?”
“It’s not a problem for you, then? People assuming we’re together?”
He contemplated what to do.
“He’s… a scientist,” Molly begins tentatively. “I, we’re… friends and he, well, he sometimes comes in to look--not to look at, sorry, sorry--he experiments on things. Not, not in a weird way. Well, sometimes in a--He’s
Sherlock checked the time, bored with watching his fellow countrymen chat and laugh. He closed his eyes and retreated to his mind, doing his best to block out the commotion. The flight was roughly nine hours with a stop in between; if all went according to plan he’d be checked into his room early enough that he could make his way to the mountain and make a preliminary visual inspection of the course before the other athletes arrived. Not that this would give him an idea of his time - the snow would become more and more carved but it would give him some inkling of the curves and likely speed of the course.
Again, he’s presented with dozens of choices, so he spends some time sifting through the results, ruling out the ailment-specific ones. He avoids WebMD entirely. Eventually he stumbles upon one titled “Health Chat” and clicks it, figuring it seems as innocuous as any of the other options. John is surprised and delighted to find that there is a disclaimer warning the chat consumers that the status of those giving medical advice has not been verified.
They sat together on the floor, listening on as Greg phoned his contact at the IOC. Minutes later, Sherlock was cradling the phone against his ear while his hands trailed lightly across John’s skin, giving them a detailed account of what had just transpired in his hotel suite. It sounded to Sherlock like a terrifically outlandish tale even as he told it, as though it might have been artfully crafted fiction. His ribs throbbed to remind him that the pain had been real, the plot had been just as diabolical as he was describing, and that yes, indeed, one of the world’s best skiers was actually a murdering, scheming sociopath.
“Why?” John asks immediately, his voice hard.
“One around my waist, I think, I’ll just,” Sherlock gets into position and John slings his arm around Sherlock’s shoulders and they stand.
“Aren’t you getting anything?” John’s voice cuts through his inner monologue and Sherlock’s eyes flick to each of the baristas.
Not long after they had wheeled John into an exam room, Greg arrived and informed Sherlock that the IOC was currently devising a plan for the finals in the men’s downhill event, but the ordeal with Moriarty had thrown the situation into a type of chaos that they clearly were not prepared for.
Sherlock let his head fall back against the wall and his eyes to slip closed. Even as he shook his head slowly, he couldn’t wrap his brain around it; he grinned and curled his fingers slightly into John’s biceps.
He imagines, briefly, an amalgamation of the two men; it’s only a moment before he realizes how ridiculous he’s being, imagining the best aspects of both to create the perfect man. John laughs to himself–albeit bitterly–and boots up his laptop.
Sherlock blinked but said nothing.
It’s far too easy to get caught up in the daydreams and to ignore the fact that they still face the journey of getting to that eventuality. Though there are some moments of ambiguity, John is nearly positive—somehow, deep in his bones, he knows, of course he does, Sherlock is his best friend—that Sherlock will reciprocate John’s long-simmering feelings and desires.
Sherlock tosses a hand over his eyes and laughs, the noise waking the dog at his side. Immediately, Redbeard sticks his wet nose against Sherlock’s throat in greeting and then gives his chin a lick. “Good morning to you as well,” Sherlock says and then chuckles, half at his dog and half at John5NF.
He conjures up the image of a man, tall and lean-not unlike himself-with grey hair and a briefcase; the man is donned in a smart suit and expensive watch, and Sherlock immediately rejects what he’s fabricated. Judging by the way his John types and his easy, commoner diction, he can’t fathom John actually looking like that. Another variation, then: still talk, dark skin, bald-headed, denims and a scarf. Attractive, poised. But that too doesn’t sit right with him and Sherlock thinks up another variation on might-be John.
Sherlock sniffs and straightens as Molly reenters the room. “You wouldn’t understand.”
him, wanted to be touched like this, by him.
“I’m sorry, I know, I really am just happy, happy, happy. Even after that bastard Moriarty and all of that, you know. You have John and I have Greg now and thank you, Sherlock, for letting me be a part of all of this!” Her head went to her hands, which were splayed out on the table, and John grinned as he slid in next to her, Molly cuddling up to his side. He mouthed “She’s drunk,” and Sherlock nodded, chuckling silently.
: and I don’t even know you, and I get more from you
John snorted and sipped from his pint. “They’re fifteen years younger than me.”
Sherlock stood and stretched, his back and knees creaking from being in such an awkward position for so long. He twisted his torso on his hips. “Indeed, the final day to qualify.”
, he begins.
“Long enough to know,” John squares his shoulders, goes a bit rigid; Sherlock clocks it as military stance in an instance and is shaken to find that he’s rather taken by it. “That he’s solved more cases for you than is probably good? If the media found out, I don’t know, that would be bad for business, wouldn’t it? Not for his,” John tosses another thumb in his direction.
“Whatever you’ve on is fine. S’a king bed, I don’t mind.” The voice was thick with sleep but sounded sure enough, and with that, Sherlock returned to the bathroom and donned his pants and moved through the dark room to slip into the vacant side of the bed.
He can’t decide if he’s going to forge ahead with the thought that momentarily flits through his brain, but then his mouth is opening and he’s speaking. “Not your area so… you’ve not got a girlfriend?”
. Air whizzed past his body as he focused upon the stark, red ending line that lay up ahead.
“Arse or cock?” he poses and that gets a bark of a laugh from her.
who knows, it’s just neither of us needs this right now. You’re in the final and I… well, I’ll be recovering for the rest of the bloody month.”
Sherlock looked up, up, and took another deep, steadying breath. The air rushed past his ears and bit at his skin but he didn’t feel it. All he could sense was the hard thump of the blood rushing through his veins and his muscles alive with the difficulty of the course.
“I should stop talking,” John huffs.
“But you brought me to this… cottage—”
Leaning in, John whispers over the din of the falling water, “Your arse is perfect.”
John sat beside Lestrade, rosy cheeked and windswept, scarf wound high around his neck. “Two more serious injuries; who designed this course? Hey Sherlock,” John gave a tip of his chin and Sherlock returned it likewise.
Sherlock shifts infinitesimally closer as they reach the door. “Absolutely never better.”
, and Sherlock finds his mind a little buoyant and floaty. From the alcohol, of course.
the email reads.
And John doesn’t even know…
“Hmmm,” Sherlock hums. “Just pondering if I’ll even be able to get back on skis the next time we’re here. If we’re even asked back.”
Sherlock types back, the dog’s head against his chest making it more difficult than it would usually be.
“Oh,” Sherlock sighed in equal parts pleasure and surprise as the muscles nearly immediately began to unwind.
“That’s good to know,” John says and then laughs, leaning forward on the table, the candlelight flickering in his open gaze. “Look, I’m uh, I’m glad that we worked this out, and…”
The latter was nowhere to be found and Sherlock frowned; he’d been so insistent in his texts, Sherlock had expected him to be on hand with the rest of the staff.
John rolled his eyes and stood, pacing the length of the room. “I don’t- you’re intense and
Falling back onto the pillow, he cradled the mobile to his sternum and allowed his eyes to close. He was startled out of his peace rather immediately as the phone buzzed against his chest.
brilliant. He does good work. Sort of a helps people out of tough spots… for a fee of course.”
Sherlock sighs, closes his eyes and pinches the bridge of his nose. He’s reaching out because he feels
John is not following. “Okay…”
Mycroft tutted audibly, notching Sherlock’s impatience and annoyance up even further. “This is dangerous, Sherlock.”
It’s a uniquely new sensation, this. He’s never experienced this sort of gut-twisting, truly heart-wrenching guilt. That means something, Sherlock thinks; of course it does. John means something to him; John is dear to him, and he truly hates himself–loathes himself if he’s honest about it–for misleading him even in the slightest.
“Is that what he said?” Sherlock asks, disguising the fact that he’s surprised that he’s following Molly out; he’d normally do everything he could to remain in the morgue and get a look at other bodies.
to be. Sherlock could abide a lot of things, but Jim Moriarty being a better skier than he was, truly and actually, couldn’t be possible. Doing his best to relax his jaw and look at ease, knowing that the cameras would likely focus on him just after Moriarty crossed the finish line, Sherlock shifted his eyes to the clock that was flicking away the milliseconds.
Sherlock waggles his eyebrows, but John doesn’t budge, just continues to stare up at him in wonder.
“Yes, but-”
His eyes slipped closed as he tilted his head back and took a deep breath; he couldn’t afford to become overwhelmed about this. It took him a moment to clear his mind but once he did, he tried to figure out what he should do. It was nearly ten o’clock in the evening and he needed rest if he was to make another training run in the afternoon. There were two options: he could sleep in the hotel lobby - a rather conspicuous location where he’d be susceptible to being photographed by the press but also run the chance of finding hotel staff to get him situated - or he could sleep here, right here, on the floor.
It struck Sherlock how intimate it all was, reclining in the bath, naked and very vulnerable, with someone he’d only known a few days. But like how he’d felt the first time he’d strapped on a pair of skis, being with John Watson felt immeasurably right. It felt right in the way that it lodged in his bones, set his teeth on edge when he was without, left him wanting and craving.
“No?” Sherlock asks and then pivots around John, en route to the bed, but stops briefly to swat lightly at John’s arse.
He listened while he was on the machines, killing two birds with one stone, but he didn’t come up with anything other than exclamations of shock about Hanzu's death and general criticisms over the complexity of the course. Sherlock wasn’t surprised that he was the only one in the skiing community to believe foul play to have had a part in the tragedy, they’d been overlooking Moriarty’s skin-of-the-teeth wins and strange athlete injuries for years.
think!
Sherlock crawls onto the bed, long limbs supporting him as he hovers over John, swipes their noses together briefly and then kisses him, lowering himself to nestle into John’s side.
Before he knows it he’s rushing to keep up with this insane arsehole of a man, following him into the back of a cab and just like that, they’re off to Brixton.
“Certainly what?”
But they’ve weathered horrible things, violent deaths, utter despair; how can John really believe that admitting his love would cause them further pain? It’s ridiculous. They’re being entirely ridiculous, and they should just damned-well do something about this.
“Lestrade, they’ve left the complex, if they’re on their way back here they’re-”
“Not gonna pretend we’re going to be awake long enough now,” John punctuates with a yawn. “But room service when we wake up?”
For a moment it seems that Sherlock has actual conceded the argument. “What do you even do in there?”
“John,” Sherlock said, louder, with more intent.  “Move in with me.”
His blood picked up and thrummed in anticipation.
Sherlock watched him go, smiling serenely as he did. He felt warm and relaxed and
“Erm, I’ll see you tomorrow?” John asked once he was at the door, hand on the knob. Sherlock gave him a short nod and John opened the door to exit. “Goodnight.”
Sherlock couldn’t make much of the first entries, the scrawl fairly illegible. As he flipped through, however, he came across a page of names, names he knew. There were several members of the European Junior squad as well as several names Sherlock didn’t recognize. The second to last name on the list was Hanzu’s.
Would he have allowed himself to do it any differently, especially considering how self-deprecating he’d been about having feelings towards John at all?
“About the wax.”
But that’s all boring.
“No, stop right there. Just a friend, just a-”
Sherlock shrugged, pushing a last bit of beef stroganoff around his plate before setting the utensil carefully down with a delicate chime. “Where did you study, when you were pursuing medicine?” They’d been speaking of inane things for the past hour; the mountain, Lestrade and Molly, the make and model of skis Sherlock was using featured prevalently, but the effluvia didn’t tell Sherlock anything new about John, and he desperately wished to learn the whole of him.
“And even if you’re fishing for compliments I have to say that you’re… gorgeous and intelligent and yeah, brilliant,
“Right,” John raises a brow and then shakes his head, an amused half-smile playing on his lips; he’s not buying it, but the staring doesn’t seem to have unsettled him. “You’re an odd one, aren’t you?”
There is no chat communication for a few moments and John bites at his bottom lip, waiting.
Greg had been good for Sherlock, breaking down the sport into its components and helping him channel his anger when he didn’t advance as quickly as he liked. Additionally, he didn’t put up with Sherlock’s precocious nature, being just as firm with the boy as he would have been with any adult he was training. Sherlock gained a great respect for him and, after training with him for two years, began to flourish on the youth circuit.
; he’d heard that before, but where? Not in casual conversation, no. No, that was something you said to someone on a date, on a
John shakes his head and stands, wraps his hand tighter around his coffee cup and clarifies: “For the time, for letting me know the time.”
: Well, that’s a common injury in auto accidents, was the patient in an auto accident?
It makes John’s insides swim in an anticipation that he can’t place. Sharing a bed, between the two of them. Once it might have set him into a frenzy of anxiety; now, it’s something he finds he’s nervously looking forward to. Perhaps this is just the little shove they need to take a solid step over the line they’ve been edging so carefully towards.
The job seems… good. A decent salary--one that would keep him in London at least--and relatively close to his bedsit. Molly had seemed pleasant and he could see her being a good co-worker and he’d be around Mike again. His therapist would be over the moon if he took the job. John knows it’s not ideal, and he doesn’t pretend that it is, but he also knows that the longer he waits to take a position, the less likely it is that he will be able to get anything respectable.
: andyou won’t say because it’s probably not good that youve taken to the internet to find answers to your questions. Why not work with the pathologist?
Sherlock suddenly finds that he too despises himself; to be someone that John doesn’t like, to be someone that one of the best people he’s ever interacted with doesn’t take to…
Moran startled and stalked up to him and immediately hit him hard across the face; a blast of sickening yellow tore across his vision, his ears rang discordantly and his world tilted viciously on its axis. Still, he yelled, voice wobbling and wavering, cracking. Again, a strong fist met the side of his head and his stomach lurched violently as the deep, unsettling gong-like sound resonated in his skull.
Sherlock licked his lips and mirrored John’s position. He steeled himself, swallowed and asked, “Well, I was wondering… wanna see some more?”
“Right, yes. I. …your assistance was.” Sherlock’s mouth twists as he searches for the word. “Fine.”
Lestrade had to head the reporters off at the pass so that Sherlock was able to make it off the course and away from the cameras. After shrugging efficiently and wordlessly out of his gear, he hurriedly boarded a tram back down to the Olympic Village alone, leaving John to return to the medic team to try to find out anything else he possibly could about Holsinger’s injury.
John smiled back innocently and then leaned in, looking out over Sherlock’s right shoulder and growled, “There are so many things I’m going to do to you, you have
“Yeah,” John said and Sherlock could hear the smiled in his voice. “Alright.”
“God, fuck,” John too was gritting his teeth, the corners of his eyes pinched in pain. “Give me a minute, you’re… christ you’re bigger than you feel.”
Phillip stood off to the side while the others set about getting Sherlock’s poles, gloves and goggles fitted properly. He wouldn’t put the skis on until the very last moment, lest he undo any of Molly’s hard work.
“It’s taking an age, and I-”
His body took over and thrust him through the starting gate.
“I’ve got to keep my energy up. There’s a training run tomorrow and I can’t afford to let this get in the way, not again. I’m not going to let Moriarty derail me, not now.” With a flick of his wrist, Sherlock opened the menu and then glanced up at John from beneath his eyelashes.
For a brief second Sherlock hated himself, hated that he’d found someone that he wanted to spend time with, that he desired to be around and that he had to warn him off. “John..” he began, searching for the words to explain to him just what a terrible idea this was. “I’m sure you’ve seen the rumors about me. If we’re seen together frequently, I can assure you that the press-”
“You’d discover a lot of things if you really knew me.” Sherlock places his cup down with so much care that it reads as patronizing.
“Hi, hope this is—”
“Small cottage—”
Sherlock’s mouth tips in an affectionate half smile, as he rereads the email, wonders not just what John5NF is like, but what his mother is like. His thoughts turn to his own mother, and he feels a stab of guilt at having not called her in nearly a month. He should get to that, he thinks, as he opens a new message box to compose a reply.
Sherlock’s heart thudded in his chest, his whole body awake and alive, positively thrumming with excitement, adrenaline causing endorphins to flood through him. This was what he thrived on, what he craved. He sucked in a quick breath of frigid air as his breathing sped up, capturing the taste of it in his mouth, feeling at peace as his skis cut audibly through the crisp surface.
“Tell me,” Moriarty said eventually, enthusiastically, “how was
you’re
John went suddenly still and silent and Sherlock froze, waiting for John to speak up.
“Just the one,” John murmurs and sinks lower into the bubbles.
John pinched Sherlock in the side, prompting him to reply, “Yes, Greg. Thank you.”
“You’re kind of a big deal,” John poked.
Sherlock licks his lips and his gaze falls to where his hands are resting on the table. “John…”
Sherlock posed, aloof, and leaned back in order to better see his new seating companion. With broad shoulders and strong chin, he sat straight in the seat but seemed to be at comfort. He had stormy blue eyes and a voice that hinted at an ability to command, take charge.
“Yes.”
There’s a brief beat of silence during which John feels so wrong-footed he imagines that he might actually fall over where he’s standing.
“I,” John breathes, experiencing a stab of pain right down the center of himself, at reliving how he felt at that time. He almost can’t function for a moment, recalling how he’d felt as though he had been imploding in the weeks after Sherlock’s death, at all of the things he’d admitted, placed firmly in the “if only Sherlock were still alive,” hindsight pile.
“John.”
He’d only created this email address in order to interact with John5NF. He could delete this account right this second and not lose anything of absolute important. He could send Guest into the ether, leaving John5NF with no inbox to send further emails to.
“So you just,” her voice is tinged with suspicion, “...just came to bring us coffee?”
“Yes,” Sherlock sighs, running his right hand through his hair, “God.”
Sherlock blinked. “I was merely making conversation.”
His phone pings.
If Sherlock believed in fate, he might believe that fate was playing a cruel joke on him. But he doesn’t believe in fate, or luck, so he just stews at his own ineptitude.
“I’m always nice!” Sherlock attempts, the words sounding ludicrous to even his ears.
“No, it’s…” Carefully, Sherlock rests his napkin back in his lap, takes up his chopsticks once more and snatches up another piece of maki. “Fine.”
John shook his head, grin tempering to something less that was still an elated curve of lips.“Look, can I help you tidy all of this up or...?”
He was all smiles, the color high on his cheeks, and he was wearing a tight, forest green tee-shirt that Sherlock found very distracting. Until now he’d seen John in his delegation gear, his comfortable but atrocious-looking jumpers and worn jeans. Now, the jeans he wore were tighter and hugged his arse in all of the right ways. “Looks like everyone turned up!” he said, covertly squeezing Sherlock’s side as he rounded him. “Good crowd.”
John doesn’t waste a second, feels the words pressing at the seam of his lips, wanting to be exposed, to be shouted.
Wrapping himself in a towel, he glances briefly at his reflection–he looks the exact same as he always does–and shuts the light.
Spine sagging, Sherlock drifted through the lobby to the elevators, ensuring first that there were no press lingering to see him in such a diminished state. He needed a long, hot bath, some ibuprofen and a good sleep to get him back in functioning order. Attendees of the Games had been warned about the iffy state of the water but he’d been assured by his agent that the hotel water was safe to bathe in; this was a blessing as his room was outfitted with a jetted tub, just the thing to take the ache out of his limbs.
it would be William and not
They sit in comfortable silence for a bit, watching some of the retrospectives play out on the screen before them. With only three days left at the Games, coverage has turned mainly to the events that have already ended, highlighting feats of incredible athletic ability and large personalities.
Sherlock sighs, leans back into the sofa and reads over John5NF’s–John’s, Sherlock mentally corrects–email. He has absolutely no idea what John must feel like; he’s never been part of a cohesive group before. The closest he came was perhaps when he was away at school, forced into moments of institutionalized camaraderie with the other chaps in his class. The sporadic meetings hadn’t taken and Sherlock had been left blissfully to his own devices.
Again, it takes only moments for Guest to respond.
everyone talks,” he sneered in response.
,” Sherlock spits the word, “any further, you might check the record of that particular surgeon on staff, once you find her.”
“Right,” his mouth feels odd, forming the word. “Hello.”
John picks up the paper, spilling a bit of his coffee in the process and holds it up in front of his face. He doesn’t want the world’s most observant person reading about all… of
Sherlock pulls back for a shivery breath and John manages to say, “A man can only take so much, you know.” he begins, finishes on a weak little sigh.  “We’re not going to do… anything… tonight.”
“With?” John eventually asks, immediately presses the glass to his mouth to stop mumbling apologies and pack-pedalling that immediately spring to mind.
He sleeps for an hour before the nightmares wake him.
“Well, when you put it like that…” John said quietly, sliding his thumb over Sherlock’s knuckles. “Any word on what’s going to happen with him?”
“Oh, yes,” John agreed, and Molly nodded her head where it rested against his shoulder.
They managed the rest of the walk in relative silence, avoiding the droves of drunken revelers that were lingering in the streets. John looked at it all in with an air of fascination and good humor while Sherlock cringed internally. While he would normally wish for the solace of his hotel room, he found himself rather relieved that John hadn’t buggered off yet; it was for that reason alone that he was willing to put up with the nonsense of being out in public.
The skis were a
Again, he rolled his eyes. “Is it really so hard to believe?”
“There’s most certainly blackmail going on, but…” Sherlock said. “Hanzu’s death reeks of intention. Perhaps his wax was replaced with whatever substance Moriarty has.”
Instead of answering each and every one, he notes the time is still fairly early and gives her a call. They end up speaking for an hour about his qualifications and when he hangs up, he sighs with a real sense of having accomplished something.
That’s when Sherlock looks up at him, gaze open and calm, a hint of sadness in the curve of his mouth. Expectant. Waiting for John’s reaction to an obvious overture.
Their shoes crunch over the uneven gravel as they make their way down the lane to the quaint, stone building where their room is located. Sherlock glances back at him only once, expression somehow delighted and a tad bashful all at once. It’s an odd look on him, and one that John’s only seen once or twice before.
Molly patted his arm and made her way to the bar, effectively abandoning him, and for a moment he allowed his eyes to stray to the Russian feed of the opening ceremonies on the flatscreen television above the bar. His lips pursed in annoyance, he wondered if he could still get a jog in and managed to get to sleep without the endorphin interference when he spotted a familiar figure pressing his way through the crowd.
Molly smiled sweetly at him and grabbed at his elbow. “Come in, get a pint. Greg’s here… somewhere.”
“So you keep saying,” Sherlock said darkly. “I would reconsider what you believe you have to do where I am concerned.”
Sherlock writes and swallows against the slight shame of the admission. He presses his eyes closed and then opens them again, willing himself on.
Shoulders back, he slumps down a bit more in the water, brings his feet up to press against the tiles. Best not to think of Baker Street now, when he’s trying to relax. Mary will be home any minute now and they’ll have to be off to the Haverfords’ for dinner. John doesn’t want to go, finds the Haverfords starchy and boring and bland, but Mary is convinced that they’ll need to be friendly with them, as Donald is on the board at the Chittendon School.
It’s more than domestic, it’s partnership. A domestic partnership. Without some of the more tangible benefits.
As it happens, it’s a terrible idea; he very nearly chokes on the toothpaste, opting to spit the entire brush into the sink. There’s an email there, amongst the replies from Lestrade and the pleas of people to take their cases, from John. There’s no subject, and for some reason that sets Sherlock’s nerves on edge.
It’s a very, very introspective message that John5NF has sent, and it sends something like a ripple of mirth down Sherlock’s spine. The way John5NF speaks about London reminds him of how he feels about the city; not in springtime, and not so soft and romantic, but Sherlock loves London all the same. It’s touching, in a way, knowing that someone else, someone he’s become so fond of, is also so fond of a place that he is.
John blinks at him.
“...I won.”
Struggling with his body, John manages to turn onto his left side, curling into Sherlock, nuzzling his nose in the heat of Sherlock’s neck for a moment. He can hear Sherlock’s breath, hear him swallow, and when he takes Sherlock’s cock in hand, he feels Sherlock’s gasp against his cheek.
John responded quietly. “Yeah that, thank you, yeah, I’d just erm, rather not think about it for the moment. I don’t want to think about that right now.”
John was silent and still on his side, nearly two feet away from Sherlock. In the large bed, even if he wanted to touch John he’d have to make a point to uncurl and stretch over; they weren’t in any danger of spooning during the night, but they were two men in the same bed, in a place that wasn’t hospitable for homosexuals. He wasn’t sure his reputation could handle the scandal that might come with a photograph capturing him leaving another man’s room in the morning.
“As of an hour ago, yeah. That’s what people do at pubs, they chat over pints. This one was one of the only ones who wasn’t pissed straight away coming in here. Your team’s a bunch of lushes.” Greg laughed and clapped Sherlock on the shoulder once more. “What are you drinking?”
Redbeard is more than thrilled to see him, as is the frazzled dog-walker, to whom he pays an exorbitant fee.
“Worth the wait?”
Sherlock leaned in, dragging his nose back and forth through the short hair at John’s brow. “Of course.”
Sherlock toggles his head this way and that in answer and turns his attention back to the street; John watches him curiously. He’s incredibly observant, John can tell by simply looking at him, and he knows how to have a conversation, even if he doesn’t seem to enjoy it. He can fully understand why some people might think Sherlock a dick but John–for some inexplicable reason–wants to know more about him. About why Sherlock is the way he is.
That causes the tiniest of smiles to tip Sherlock’s mouth. “John…”
After a bit, Angelo just appears, a bottle of wine in one hand and a plate of olives in the other. “Thought this vintage might suit,” he suggests and, rather than pouring for either of them, be leaves the bottle in front of Sherlock’s plate setting. “You boys want to try some of the house specialties?”
“Oh,” Sherlock says, as though it’s off-hand, though the waver in his voice gives him up immediately. “Love, for instance. Stability. The notion that a person could want to be around, with, alone with one person for the rest of their living days. Pedestrian, I know, but, the idea that our lives would extend, together, well beyond middle age...”
“John, can we be
, and yet so fascinating; it’s a bit disconcerting, if Sherlock is being honest with himself. And how exciting! Is John perhaps a true wolf in sheep’s clothing?
Sherlock chuckled, dry-swallowing the Vicodin before reaching around John for a bottle of water that rested on an end table. “Yes, lucky you that I finally, finally-”
He’s never done this before, never partaken in anything so careful and sweet with someone, that John finds himself going back, conditioning Sherlock’s hair again, just so that the moment draws perfect and taut.
Sherlock strips down to his pants and retires to bed, Redbeard already asleep on the rug next to Sherlock’s preferred side. Once beneath the covers, he stares at the wall, feeling excitement turn to buzzing static in his veins. He shouldn’t be this excited and he knows it; he knows he’s likely going to be disappointed in finally meeting the person he…
“Right, nevermind. So… you’re here for a case?” Lestrade tries again. “That I don’t have. Because as I’ve said, I call you when I do.”
He hesitates no longer. Sherlock clicks the ‘yes’ button resolutely.
Sherlock’s tongue peeks out to wet his lips, and he sighs, taking another sip of his wine before leaning across the table, almost conspiratorially. It makes John nervous; Sherlock’s intent to admit something important is quite clear. His voice is low and helpless when he says, “I don’t know how to do this, John.”
John pays his tab and saunters out into the chilly London evening, deciding again to walk home rather than take the Tube. His cane a sturdy helpmate at his side, he strolls along, intermittently people-watching and glancing up at the facades of buildings as he passes. He wants to relearn the city, he decides. He wants to get to know it’s main thoroughfares and back alleys all over again. He wants to find new haunts to make his own, seek out the changes in London and learn them, know it all as he once did.
“To be honest,” John says, “I was waiting for that.”
Greg nodded. “Especially from the Swedes.”
Mike lets out a belly laugh--actually clutching at his stomach--and shakes his head. “Sherlock isn’t so bad. I don’t understand why so many people are frightened of him.”
John releases a sigh, sits up and goes to fold the paper, startling when he finds Sherlock Holmes seated at the table just across from him. “John Watson, I knew it was you from the shoes. Well, and the way you’ve placed your cup and saucer just so. Are you hiding from me?”
They gazed out the window a moment longer before John turned, thumbs hooked into the pockets of his trousers. “Still, nice room.”
John Watson dresses to the left.
“And you like it that way? Doesn’t it get lonely?”
Confused, he took a step towards his things, spying a note tucked into the front flap of his laptop bag.
John ran his hands over his face and stood, swiping his palms against his thighs as he did so. Sherlock levered himself up into a sitting position and assessed the state of the sitting room, wondering if he could simply be lazy and allow the maid service to tidy it all up.
“Yes you did.”
“When
, wouldn’t you?”
But this was different. Yes, his career was on the line, but so was John’s. John’s reputation and good name hung in the balance. If he didn’t play this exactly right, if he didn’t come up with concrete proof, he could ruin John’s life. Sherlock contemplated what exactly that meant – he was positively
Sherlock can’t take his eyes off of John; his heart hammers in his chest, mouth gone completely parched. It hadn’t occurred to him that he’d have to wait for John’s response. He’s not sure how this goes; he hadn’t really considered much after the
“Don’t know if she’ll be of much help, but I can try, of course, yeah.”
and, and, and-
They exchanged a brief heated glare that Sherlock severed, appearing to be too caught up in his reps to pay the man any more mind.
“You’re going to take me to lunch.”
John’s eyes flit to where Sherlock’s fingers bracket his hips, before sliding up to meet his gaze. “Or?”
John released Sherlock’s grip first and Sherlock watched the hand retreat, curling safely around the arm of the seat. Recognition lit in John’s eyes and he snapped his fingers together at placing who Sherlock was. “Oh you’re that downhill bloke who everyone talks about.” John’s voice wasn’t surprised or prying but was rather knowing, and he served Sherlock with a small smile. “Not as scary as they say.”
“You’re quite welcome to observe my runs on the course whenever you’d like.” His stomach roiled unpleasantly, turning with embarrassment. Now it seemed as though he
Molly bounces a bit on the balls of her feet. “Great. Indian buffet?”
like you to touch me.”
and another from Lestrade, further down,
“What now?” John asked, eyes bright and clear and focused. Sherlock gave him a look over; he seemed excited, intent, anticipatory. Sherlock was pleased, pleased that he’d been right about John’s thirst for danger, pleased that Sherlock could quench it a bit. Moreover, he found it rather brilliant that John had suspected Moriarty from the start and that he was not only willing but eager to help find proof.
Sherlock sighs as though he’s suffering. “The bathroom, in the bag. Molly gave them to me.”
Sherlock shook his head, glancing to the right of the camera. “I really can’t make any comments regarding James Moriarty.”
John made to follow Sherlock out of the room before the other man turned and stopped him. “Wait five minutes, then follow.” Though John’s face fell a fraction, he accepted Sherlock’s directive and nodded, watching as Sherlock left.
“Why are you insisting?” His voice was low and rather than being cutting it had the edge of intrigue. John was doing his best to engage Sherlock, to get him to
“Yes,” Sherlock says distractedly, detached. “Tragic.”
He doesn’t
And John doesn’t even put up a fight, just enters the lift and stabs the button for the main floor and says, “There’s a place two blocks away that I’ve heard good things about. Think they have outdoor seating, too.”
a date,” he insists, taking a step back from her, holding his hands up defensively.
John’s eyes narrow at the idiot bit. He licks his lips and considers. “So you just…
Sherlock was overcome with the desire to prove that to John now, using his own body, his cock and his mouth and his fingers. He wanted to translate what was residing in his heart and mind in a way that left no room for interpretation.
“What do you like?” Sherlock could tell what John liked, on the surface; he liked danger and sunlight, strong red ales, salty over sweet, and the color evergreen, in particular. There were reams and reams of things that Sherlock was sure John liked, and he wasn’t particularly comfortable with how readily he accepted that he wished to know what all of them were.
Their bodies press together, on their sides; it’s awkward, but John finds Sherlock’s lips and sets a pace—slow, languid. Sherlock’s hands roam steadily over John’s skin, from the curve of his arse to his shoulder blades and John feels held, loved, and protected in a way he hadn’t even thought to consider.
It disquiets Sherlock’s mind, that he can’t suss it out.
, needed to devise some way to both out Moriarty and ensure that it didn’t affect his own performance on the slopes. His fingers threaded through the hair at the sides of his head and he tugged as he slumped back against a brick wall, waiting for the many passersby to dissipate.
: I don’t know what to say to that
, his mind provides.
“Fuck,” John bends his knees above the water, only to find his skin flecked with fine, gold dust. He is covered in glitter.
He unlocks the door to the flat and finds nothing amiss; Sherlock isn’t in sight, but now John’s on the trail, like a bloodhound. He drops his briefcase and begins sniffing around, through the sitting room, to the kitchen, and then, finally, the bathroom.
John nodded, slid his hands into his pockets and settled his gaze on his shoes. There was a brief moment when they said nothing - but rather than feeling tense or awkward, Sherlock felt relaxed and unhurried. He hadn’t felt such a peace of mind around another person in a very, very long time. It continued to amaze him.
Grunting, Sherlock lets John have his fill and then struggles over onto his back, unconcerned with the wetness on the bed.
Well.
“Yes, it is,” Sherlock smiled and dropped another kiss playfully onto John’s mouth. “But I like it.”
There is an email from guest_47995 with
A block and a half now and Sherlock swallows thickly, thinking again, for an insane moment, that he can still call this all off, remain happy with the status quo. But by the time he’s through debunking that as a bad idea, they’re on Baker Street, the dirty, red awning of Speedy’s just in view.
John swallowed and glanced down at his shoes momentarily. “You never answered me,” he whispered slowly, maneuvering so that they were chest to chest, only a sliver of space between them. Sherlock could smell the tiramisu on John’s breath, could feel the heat radiating off of his body and wanted to press
Shrugging, Molly picks up her glass and polishes it off; she checks her watch and pushes Sherlock’s wine towards his hand. “That’s not shallow, everyone thinks that. It can be a problem if you’re not physically attracted to someone that you’re emotionally attracted to sure, but you’re getting ahead of yourself. You have to
Settling his tongue against his upper lip, Sherlock withheld the grin that was battling to make its way onto his face. He bent and scooped up his water bottle and took a long draw, eyes focused on the mirrors on the far end of the long room. He took another swallow, settled the sudden nerves that had cropped up. “You,” he shifted his gaze to meet John’s, “you like me.” It was said rather plainly, and wasn’t a question, but it
And as he’s trying to decide how to continue with his reply, a small bit of text pops up on the left-hand side of his screen.
He maneuvered up to the starting line and readjusted his poles. Though he’d already qualified for the finals with his first training run, he knew he needed to shave a few tenths of a second off of his time to get better placement.
It’s remarkable, that mere hours previous, he’d been warring with his feelings of affection for Sherlock. Now, sated and sleepy, he has the enormous privilege of watching Sherlock in slumber.
John blinked up at Sherlock, his chin hovering just over the man’s prick and Sherlock grinned once at him before allowing his eyes to fall closed. “I’m quite glad you weren’t put off by my behavior on the plane, when we first met.”
John cleared his throat and Sherlock’s gaze drifted up to meet his, lethargic. “Tonight was…”
God, the crime scene photos really are positively gruesome, he realizes as he glances at them again; Sherlock is almost
The clock on the wall above the pastry case shows that it’s 9:05 and John can’t help but wonder for the umpteenth time if he’s being stood up. Even before it’d been after nine, he’d wondered it. He puts his hands to use, swivels the handle of his cappuccino from side to side, takes a sip, checks the time again.
It could have been any number of things, but the how didn’t matter right now. What mattered was that Moriarty
for her assistance on this very, very overdue chapter.
He makes it three blocks before he has to stop and check his email, huffing at his own inability to be patience as he does so. There’s a reply, the chain of their replies titled a bold,
Sherlock sighs and tries to dodge around the reporter, but he follows along, microphone thrusting towards Sherlock’s mouth. “The spotlight on gay athletes has–”
“Us, Sherlock. I don’t want to miss the chance for us.”
“I could say the same of you. You're usually the first one up here. What did you do, linger over breakfast?”
Lemon and…gardenia, maybe?
Sherlock remained still, watching for the moment when John would realize that Sherlock didn’t particularly enjoy being engaged in small talk, waiting for the moment when John would decide that he shouldn’t bother. It was like this with most people; they would try for a bit and then disengage awkwardly, slinking away from him. Generally, Sherlock was rather fond of the way things played out. Now, he found himself wanting to be engaged, still confused as to just
Sherlock’s face shows a range of emotions in a second, and John watches them all. It’s such a breathtaking thing, watching as Sherlock realises that they feel deeply the same about one another.
“You’re not going to get away with this,” John grunted.
John toes off his shoes and runs a hand through his hair, shucking his jacket as he makes his way across the room to get a glass of water in the kitchenette. He leans against the countertop and closes his eyes, hearing his heartbeat in his ears. For a time the only sound in the tiny flat is the dripping of the faucet and John’s own breath, until the chiming of his phone startles him. He’s across the room in an instant, fishing it out of his coat pocket.
“Yes,” she agreed, swallowing thickly. “That. And I’ve given you your damned goggles so what’s got you so worked up -- oh wait,” she said with an wretched little giggle. “Did that doctor-”
“Boring,” Sherlock says, breathily, rolls his eyes and snatches up his menu anyway, startling a pleased chuckle out of John.
Pressing his lips together, John opts to put the glass back on the table, settle his suddenly damp palms on denim-clad thighs. “Yeah no, makes uh, makes sense.”
And what he’s managed to deduce. The seemingly innocuous things that Sherlock has picked up on, that his mind has deemed important enough to draw his attention to.
“Yes?” Sherlock asked, his bottom lip mere centimeters from the head of John’s cock, his breath surely brushing over the hot flesh.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at the
. He’s missing something, but
“Don’t say…” Molly presses her lips together and reassesses. “Think before you speak, alright?”
Sherlock was quiet, stunned, and John just continued to grin at him. “Oh, I, uh-”
“As I can see,” he returns, not unkindly, glancing around the space for any sign of John Watson. “I was hoping I could get another look at the jumper from yesterday, see if any new bruising has formed.”
“I took a seat there, he happened to impose and sit beside me.”
Sherlock’s mouth perks in a half-smile at that, that somehow, in some small way, he and John5NF are sharing something, a common experience.
Sherlock fought it but was walked back until his knees his the edge of the desk chair and he collapsed into it, immediately springing back to his feet, fight or flight response engaged. He got one, solid punch into Moran’s ribs before he was clocked across the face by the back of a hand.
developed the wax himself, had even attempted to sell it legally. Money, Sherlock realized, profit, was a vicious motivator but Moriarty wanted something more. The pieces all slotted into place: Moriarty setting up a network of athletes to sell his product across the globe. His intentions to win the downhill and do away with his competition; he would have the fame and the money and control an illegal operation that spanned several continents, an international web of criminals.
Sherlock pecks quickly out.
“Fine,” Sherlock mumbles.
“What? Yes, yes really,” his voice is filled with humor as he bats at Sherlock’s hip. “You did clean after all.”
John pressed his forehead to Sherlock’s and let his weight guide him down. It was one, long, luxurious moment of John enveloping him until he was fully seated inside. Sherlock grit his teeth at the sensation, overwhelmed by the heat and the pressure, his hands going to frame John’s face, tilt it up from where he’d dropped it to watch Sherlock slip inside, to be able to look him in the eye. “John.”
It was at that moment that a Games representative came through and announced that they were beginning the procession momentarily, that they should smile for the many cameras. He rolled his eyes along with the woman’s words, having heard them before and not heeding them when he had the first several times.
“They’re inanimate objects,” Sherlock managed tonelessly, but still, couldn’t stop looking at them.
you.”
“And you couldn’t bear to live anywhere else,” Mike says knowingly, and before John can even attempt to contradict him Mike presses on. “You know after what happened at Hillingdon they’re diverting all of the volume that needs to be stored there to the morgue at Barts.”
John smiled and shoved his keys into his pocket. “I quite like you too… boyfriend.”
Angelo smiles at the both of them, “As always, whatever you want, on the house, for you and your date.”
- and accepted the bottle of water that John was holding out.
“You’re a soldier,” Sherlock said quietly, watching as John’s eyes narrowed as he nodded. “A doctor, both occupations which rely heavily on trust. Quite fit, too, able to hold your own in a fight.”
John remembers to shut down his laptop before he gets ready for bed. When he drifts off, he sleeps solidly for five hours before he’s woken by the need to use the toilet and he manages another fretful two hours afterward.
Redbeard bumps his nose into Sherlock’s knee and Sherlock glances down, muttering, “I’ve never…understood this.”
he wonders, for the umpteenth time.
John checks his own spelling and then for good measure uses spellcheck and hits ‘send’. He goes back to his dinner, prepared to wait a bit for Guest to get back to him, but not two minutes later, there is a ‘ding’ and a reply to his sent message.
He takes his time walking through the throngs of people, Ray Bans glued over his eyes. No one recognizes him and he’s grateful for it. Being back amongst the bustle of the Olympics, surrounded by the fervor, he gets a bit caught up. Sherlock resists, but finds the tug of memories is too much for him to withstand, and finds himself falling into his thoughts, recalling his very last run at the Olympics.
“Sherlock, such an accomplishment after a trying year. At your age, how did you prepare for this course?”
“I do. Yes.”
can’t,” came John’s even voice. “And like you said, I like the excitement, yeah? The danger?”
With a wave of his hand, Sherlock gives his answer, his head already ducked into the manila folder. It’s compelling and strange. Young female, found in an alleyway in Vauxhall, abdominal organs on the dirty blacktop.
It’s the other things, the things that are hard to qualify the real importance of, the things that make absolutely no sense outside the context of a relationship. The things that have meaning between two people, that are crucial, that may be small and meaningful to some, but to those two people, are cherished.
Wasn’t that a turn up. From nostril flare to admittance of attraction in under three seconds, if Sherlock had to quantify it. How positively-
Sherlock catches him gazing and presses himself up onto his elbows, brows perked in inquisition. “Hmm?” he hums an ask.
: You said three weeks, it’s twrnty days until we meet.
“Were you not complaining about me being gone for two weeks just a moment ago?” With a flick of his wrist, he shut his notebook and stared unwaveringly at John.
It wriggles out in the silence of the room, something that doesn’t need to be vocalized but is. “I washed,” Sherlock says, his face hidden in the still-damp hollow of John’s neck.
Sherlock’s mind stutters, screeches, revs up and works in double time, trying to figure out what to say in response to
“And what does that mean?”
“I know,” Sherlock drawls, smugly.
“Do I need a reason?”
“Mind palace?” John chuckles, running a finger slowly over Sherlock’s right shoulder. “Should I be flattered?” and after a nod, leaves Sherlock to it, cleaning himself up in the interim. When he’s through, Sherlock is still silent and motionless, and so John takes a risk, indulges in something he’s often thought of and takes it upon himself to shampoo and condition Sherlock’s hair.
Sherlock purses his lips. “None of the other technicians would work with me.”
“So eloquent when aroused,” Sherlock jokes and John swats at his thigh as he pulls back.
He didn’t take his eyes off of John as Greg struggled to get him free. Once the ropes were pulled away, Sherlock fought against the violent waves of pain and went to his knees, crossed the room at a crawl and sat at John’s head. With gentle hands he lifted John’s upper body and resettled him across his lap. Greg came over and sank down on the floor as well, back against the sofa with his legs stretched in front of him.
Sherlock swallowed and turned back around, sliding his face into a careful, casual mask.“You heard, about the… the tabloid piece featuring John and myself?”
But John, dependable, intelligent, strong, handsome, perfect John Watson just says, “Yes,” with a definitive nod of his head, and Sherlock feels the air punched straight out of his lungs.
Still.
Sherlock took the elevator to his floor and rounded the corner towards his room and was delightfully surprised to find John leaning against his door. Blushing, he glanced down at his shoes, and looked back up to find John clasping his hands together and pumping them over either shoulder in a mock show of celebration.
Sherlock smiled, plucking his goggles off and resting them atop his helmet as he stood in front of the media podium as was standard. He managed a genuine smile and waved at the cameras that were shoved in his face, huffing out tired breaths as he looked up to the board where the numbers remained, bright red and clear. He’d skied even better than he’d hoped he would.
A thought occurs as he pulls out the sugar, “Let’s hope that this doesn’t mean Molly has a crush on me now.”
Sherlock’s smile stretches brighter at John’s flubbering speech. “Sleep? Oh, I don’t sleep, sleep is boring.” Sherlock tilts his head to the left and then spins fifteen degrees to the left on the stool, facing John fully. “You object so heartily to the nature of my relationship with Molly. Why?”
“Withdrawn,” Sherlock is quick to correct, and he stands back, bites his bottom lip and runs his gaze from the tip of John’s toes to his hairline. Sherlock falls to his knees, begins working John out of his shoes and socks. “Perhaps, well, would you…”
He sees every mountain he’s ever competed on.
Sherlock stood, swallowed thickly. “It’s not that simple.”
“Oh.”
Boring, trite, useless feelings.
“Yes, well,” Sherlock straightens his suit jacket before seemingly realizing he still has his suit jacket on, and removes it. “You never seem to take very good care of yourself.”
Sherlock laughs to himself and bends back towards the body, sniffing it. “How did I know all of that?”
“Oh, uh, I…” John begins and then Sherlock cuts him off, gently, unlike he normally might.
“Prelims for you, tomorrow, yeah?” John asked, tugging at his clothing to right himself; Sherlock had managed to muss him considerably without even sneaking a hand beneath.
Settling back against the headboard, he steepled his hands in front of his mouth and breathed out a cleansing sigh. His mind whirred, hands unconsciously gesturing as though he were physically moving the ideas around from one place to another. Seven years prior, in Norway, World Cup qualifying. The top downhill racer at the time, Cody Jackson, has suffered a torn ACL on a course that he’d been slated to dominate.
They should be moving towards something, making some sort of notable progress, but in the wake of Mary’s death and the whirlwind of raising a toddler, it’s been difficult. He’s not immune to the way Sherlock looks at him, has always looked at him, staring with longing eyes.  Whereas before, he’d divert his eyes and pass it off as nothing, but now when John catches him, Sherlock doesn’t hide it, doesn’t try to look away, his emotions flitting across his face, tempting and reckless.
, something he owed to John as much as to the two glasses of wine he’d finished. He was having a lovely time, having
There was a sigh and Sherlock turned to look down at John. He was smiling, shaking his head. “God, your ego is enormous.”
Holmes took gold this past March in the downhill at the World Cup, in Lenzerheide, Switzerland. When I ask what he thought of the course he rolls his eyes, sips his tea, and leans back, leveling me with what I’m sure he hopes is an intimidating glare. “It’s snow, it’s slope. It’s science. If you know anything about physics there’s nothing to it at all.”
John finishes up his first day around five and begs off when Mike texts to ask if he’d like to get a drink. His hips and shoulder are throbbing, having not had to undertake such a long day of being in use in quite some time. John makes a mental note to make an appointment for a physio tuneup and sets off down the road towards his flat.
He took his time in the shower and in putting himself together; he spent long minutes with the blow dryer, sliding his fingers through his hair, getting the curls to settle
Sitting back, Sherlock made to wipe at the mess with the back of his hand, but John was darting up, breath heaving as he leaned in to lick over Sherlock’s face with an enthusiastic  tongue, spreading the slippery release around on his skin before lapping it up. Sherlock’s cock gave a twitch at both the sensation and the knowledge that he was cleaning his come off of Sherlock’s face. “Fuck,” John breathed, hot against his cheek.
John’s hand slithers across the bed, beneath the blankets and find Sherlock’s wrist, “Hm?”
He walks Redbeard, then runs, then finds that four miles is quite enough for a dog Redbeard’s age, and takes a scalding hot shower that lasts far too long. There are things he could be tending to, experiments that need beginning, notes that need to be rewritten, but he finds that he can’t get his mind off of John.
“Hey, I said I would-” John begins as Sherlock stands and John has to stop himself from reaching across the table to grab Sherlock’s arm, make him stay.
Sherlock stood and cleared their plates and loaded the little cart back up, wheeling it through the door to the hallway. When he turned to go back inside and had shut the door, Sherlock found John standing very close to him, nearly toe to toe. His brain went offline for a moment before clicking back on. His heart rate and breathing sped up and he could feel sweat beading at his hairline. “Are you-”
Sherlock and John attend the 2018 Winter Olympics.
.” After a silly waggle of her eyebrows she huffed out a little laugh.
“Any time,” John jests, wriggles his hips a bit.
Sherlock struggled to clear his mind, remove himself from the emotions that were welling in his chest and listen to the bustle around him. It was a long shot, thinking that any of the other competitors might know something and let it slip. Still, he needed to be certain that most of them were off the course and accounted for here if he was to see what he could find at Moriarty’s villa; he couldn’t run the risk of getting caught by one of the other skiers, especially not one that held Moriarty in high regard.
He’s ruminating on that matter when he remembers that he never responded to John’s earlier email. In his haste to pull his mobile from his pocket, he bungles it and sends the device skittering across the sitting room floor. Once he retrieves it, he immediately unlocks it, and pulls up the email to reply.
that he hadn’t been on hand for it. He may be able to detach from certain things, but he’s not sure he would have been able to mask his obvious horror if he’d been there in person.
But no, he’s in too deep now, showing John juxtaposing sides of himself through two different personas. And maybe, Sherlock begrudgingly realizes, this may have been the only way these interactions between them could have possibly played out. People generally do not take to him, and it had been so much easier to be open, be honest–
Sherlock flushes, but says nothing, tips his chin up so John can drop another kiss on his mouth. Sherlock is pliant and open and it takes a moment for John to decide what he wants to do with his hands.
Sherlock grinned, growled and brought John in close, their hips swaying in time as much as their injuries would allow as bodies moved to the beat around them.
“I call you when I’ve something on I can’t deal with,” Lestrade replies immediately and then gives Sherlock a once-over, gestures towards him with a jerk of his chin. “What’s up with you?”
“Oh,” John breathed, surprised, leaning back into the arm of the couch, looking haggard and stunned all at once. “Jesus. Yeah I… yeah.”
But Sherlock fell asleep the moment he returned to the empty room and John was still conked out the next morning when he’d woken at six to begin his day. They’d only managed a short workout session together since the scheduled activities has begun. It had been a week since Sherlock had managed to wrap his lips around John’s cock and he finds that unacceptable.
Redbeard gets bored of his waffling and tugs him back towards the pavement, and Sherlock goes willingly, almost as if the dog is walking him. They continue trotting down the path, around the lake.
After dropping their bags off with the staff in the lobby of the hotel - Sherlock made sure to impress upon them the importance of
“Fuck,” John groaned to his right and Sherlock’s confidence bolstered a few notches. John’s voice was clear, cognizant, he was alive and aware and if he could talk them out of their bonds, he could prevent any more harm being done to John.
“Because I think it’s funny.” He sniffs primly and straightens his back, begins typing once more.
“Bollocks,” John laughs. “I don’t know you well, but I know enough to see clearly that you’re not one for due diligence.”
“Not entirely,” John supposes.
to do with it.” He served Sherlock with a toothy, terrifying grin.  Sherlock glared back, even as he heard a low groan from across the room as John came to; he didn’t waiver, not for a moment, didn’t give into the temptation.
“Sorry,” John says, but he’s not. “I mean. If you want to, you can…” But John doesn’t want him to stop, John wants to know everything, everything about Sherlock. He wants this conversation to mean something, wants it to be the catalyst for more.
“Because no one waxes your skis like I do.”
“I, uhm, thank you,” Sherlock managed, stepping back so that John could enter the room and when he did, and the door was closed, he turned to face John with a little flourish. “The food should be here quite soon.”
“Three, perhaps for the entire month. Staging. Prep. Press. All that’s. Perhaps… put in a few runs on the eastern slope. Reserved. For training. It’s supposed to be magnificent powder.”
“Oh, loads. I can’t pass up tapas and Mediterranean. Italian, particularly though.”
“That!” Moriarty perked, almost skipping, stabbing a finger in Sherlock’s direction. “Was all Hanzu’s doing.
Sherlock felt a bead of sweat roll down his temple and just as he did, John leaned forward and licked it up with an eager tongue. He was muttering under his breath, body moving at a frantic pace against Sherlock. His free hand wrapped around the back of Sherlock’s neck and held.
John’s mouth twisted in conflict. “I don’t know that that’s such a good idea, Sherlock.”
“Hmm?”
“Mmmm,” Sherlock hums, touching John’s hand where it rest against him, feather light. They rest for a moment, stroking and breathing and settling. John wants to say everything that’s fluttering through his head, but it’s so disjointed that he thinks better of it, knows he’ll tell it all in time.
John Watson was a
“John--” Sherlock slurred, peeled his eyes open and struggled up onto his elbows, feeling drugged by lethargy.
Eagerly, Sherlock climbed up onto his knees and undid John’s flies, spreading the fabric out to create a vee of space that revealed dark green pants. Sherlock trailed two fingers teasingly over John’s trapped cock. John’s legs moved, struggling as he attempted to toe off his shoes and socks where they dangled over the edge of the bed.
But then he could; on the mountain, of course. Sherlock could outski him, outperform him, show the skiing community and the world that they’d backed the wrong horse. There was a gleeful thrill at that, imagining himself besting Moriarty for gold. Pressing his hands together, he rested them on his lips and sank deeply into thought.
Sherlock lingered there against the wall for a long time, doing his best to wrangle his thoughts into some coherency. He unbuttoned his parka and let the cool air whip against his body in an attempt to keep him present and focused; Sherlock struggled to settle his mind enough to be able to lay out the whole of the problem but found he was so rattled that he wasn’t able to get to a place where he could even begin to think about Moriarty objectively.
The sigh that he emits is cleansing and John closes his eyes, leans his head back on the wall and realizes that he can stop worrying now, just for a bit. He’s got a job, he’s got a bedsit, he’s reconnected with a friend. He’s healing. He’s not totally fulfilled but he knows that change comes with time and he’s only been back a short while yet.
Sherlock immediately stands and swoops back over to the table, taking his previously abandoned seat. “I didn’t lie, and I
“All of this,” He licked his lips and leveled a glare at Moriarty. “To win?”
“That,” Sherlock says, snapping the final ‘t’. “Is my cue, I believe.” He pulls both of his hands away from his cup and when he stands, he immediately turns his back on John and without another word, he leaves, pushes open the door to the cafe and is gone from sight.
Even as he does he hears the same deep, rich baritone saying
A blessing and a curse.
John copies the email address and goes back to his email, pasting the address into a new, blank message. He pauses, rethinks his strategy and creates a new account. Going by h.john.watson is much too obvious; he certainly doesn’t want this stranger to know his actual name. Not that his ego is large enough to believe that he is the
“Well then, do svidaniya!” Sherlock said, and ended the call.
Lestrade glanced at him and Sherlock glanced back, and then they both looked up at the jumbotron where Jim Moriarty’s face loomed large and grinning for the crowd to cheer.
John realizes how completely bonkers his life has become, thinking that flowers are strange and human blood in Tupperware is not.
For some reason the image of John Watson smiling smugly and clapping, obviously impressed, lingered in his mind until his run down the mountain was all but forgotten. It had been such a pleasant surprise; John had been easy to converse with and, unlike most of the people with whom he spoke,
John smiled, chin tipping up and accepting Sherlock’s mouth on his, the innocent kiss turning heated quickly, Sherlock’s robe slipping open just a bit to bare the middle of his chest. John shook off Sherlock’s hands, bringing them low around Sherlock’s waist, fingertips pressing suggestively against the firm curve of arse beneath.
“Evisceration!” Sherlock says, indignance coloring his voice as he looks from Sally to Lestrade and back. “How did I miss that?”
A woman, freckles, and long brown hair, short nails clicking over the keys of her laptop as the dog paces by the door, waiting to go out. A man, bald, thick fingers tapping over his PC’s keyboard while a dog rests by his feet. It almost gives the emails an intimate quality, knowing something so, well,
“I have to say,” John mentioned, as he reached for what was left in his wine glass, draining it in two long  swallows. “I didn’t expect you, either.”
“Hmmm,” came Sherlock’s response, eyes narrowing as he thought he recognized a reporter from the BBC. Hawkishly, he leaned further towards the bannister and scanned the crowd more thoroughly. He felt John tug his foot in an attempt to withdraw it from Sherlock’s hold, coming to the wrong conclusion about Sherlock’s inattention.
The ribs got taped, the foot was wrapped tightly in a bandage and all the while, as the doctors poked and prodded him, Sherlock wondered where John was and how he was doing. Greg had left Sherlock to see about John and then hadn’t returned, which could’ve meant any number of things, but his mind was too exhausted to supply him with any full, fleshed-out situations.
Sherlock’s eyes cloud for a moment, fill with something John can’t place. He doesn’t look away from John for a long while, but then turns his gaze back forward, across the bar. “I’m not bothered, though I sincerely hope you don’t snore.”
Sherlock laughs, deep and true. “Didn’t like the sofa?”
“I… what?” Sherlock’s hands paused over his knees.
And again, Sherlock has no earthly idea what to say; it’s an entirely fascinating and enraging feeling.
: what’s that?
Sherlock huffs a near laugh and opens his email. There are three messages from Lestrade from four hours ago. He’s about to open them but scans the rest of new mail in his inbox instead.
and… does that mean Guest
John smiled and huffed, sat up, slapped Sherlock’s hand away as he quickly stood, shucking himself efficiently of his socks, jeans and pants. Sherlock shimmied up on the bed, watching as John’s muscles played beneath the splay of golden skin. The bulky winter wear had hidden the defined body beneath; though John wasn’t an Olympic athlete, the lithe form before Sherlock spoke of physical fitness and care.
“Better,” he says, eyes closing as he falls back into the heat.
“Hmmm,” John hummed, taking a step back though his fingers lingered on Sherlock’s hips. His cheeks were flushed and his lips were reddened and Sherlock was fairly certain he’d never had his breath stolen until that very moment. “Expect what?”
“You’re nothing alike. You’re nothing…” he sighs and torques his body, sits cross-legged on the floor. “It was something, at the time. He was…something to me. But, just a memory now, one I haven’t given thought to in years.” John’s eyes narrow, as he picks apart Sherlock’s words, wondering still how he and Simon-from-the-past can be compared. “There’s rarely a moment when I’m not thinking of you,” Sherlock finishes quickly, a surprising admission, something John hadn’t ever hoped to be spoken so plainly.
Sherlock stops on the pathway. “That’s good, isn’t it? Taking my number, wanting it. Proves that he’s…interested? That he wants this to continue? Perhaps I’m not as off-putting as I’d once thought.” Sherlock stops walking abruptly, narrows his eyes, thinks about John’s motives. He certainly doesn’t want to second-guess John; John’s proven himself to be honest and upstanding, but Sherlock can’t help wonder what John could possibly want from him.
“Arse,” John mumbles, chucklinh, before catching Sherlock in a sweeping kiss.
“Told you he’s a dick, when he’s not talking about skiing he’s not talking at all,” Greg said.
As soon it had come it faded, and the triumphant trumpet music of the medalists’ procession kicked to life over the blaring speakers. There was an announcement in Russian and then an English translation, “Ladies and gentlemen, the medalists for men’s downhill skiing.” The American began walking and Sherlock shook himself mentally and followed right behind, walking and waving on autopilot until they were standing behind the podium. As one, they stepped up and took their places.
“Your sister?”
“Oh.”
He was electric, on fire, untouchable as he dipped even lower and sped over the jump, taking so much speed into the Russian Trampoline that he, for a brief moment, was almost unsure that he would land.
Tongue at the side of his mouth, peeking out, as John seats himself, fully, sheathed entirely. “God,” John mirrors and still, gasping. “Slow, yeah?”
“You wouldn’t be wrong, there,” Sherlock said smoothly. John’s eyes shifted, very plainly too, and Sherlock filed that away eagerly. John might not be interested in anything overt at the moment, but it was becoming rather plain that John found him attractive, at the very least. “But yes, chemistry at Cambridge.”
John tossed a stack of mail down onto the coffee table and moved to lean against the divider between the sitting room and the kitchen. He cleared his throat, crossing his arms over his chest and appeared to be pondering what Sherlock had said. “...you’re already thinking NBC.”
A light stroke, and then John turns swiftly, snatches up the bottle of slick and prepares his hand before dipping back in. He marvels at the heft of him, at the pure heat, at the level of trust Sherlock has in him, to allow him to do this. It feels marvelous, like a necessary thing, his hand on Sherlock’s cock. How he’s made it this long in life not having known the exquisite slide and feel of him so intimately is very much a crime.
“That,” and Sherlock leaned up to press a soft kiss to John’s temple, “can most certainly be arranged.”
treated him and I couldn’t…” John’s eyes trailed away and Sherlock stepped up into his personal space and in a move that felt both entirely foreign and entirely appropriate, he draped one long arm around John’s lower back and and slid the other hand up to John’s nape.
John5NF is very, very likely correct. A swell of pride fills Sherlock for a moment; Sherlock could use someone like this in his work. If only.
They were perfectly content to smile at each other for a time, the murmur of the restaurant closing around them like a cocoon. Between the food, the vodka, and the heat from the fireplace, Sherlock felt sleepy. Sleepy and well-fed, a sensation he hadn’t experienced or wanted to experience for quite some time. Their reverie was broken when the waiter came and wordlessly slipped the bill onto the table.
“You too.” There’s a lingering hint of amusement in his tone, and John realises belatedly, working through the fog of lust that’s suddenly encompassed him, he’s being teased.
him first.” She pulls a few notes from her purse and leaves them on the table. “Speaking of, let’s get you back to Baker Street. Don’t want you to be late.”
“...eat?” John finishes, dipping his head as he feels a slow grin slide up on his lips. He’s enjoying this slow, syrupy heat that’s settling in his stomach; he’s delighting in savoring this sweet burn.
: Please, simply assure me that you will give me the benefit of the doubt and let me explain myself.
even, and he wasn’t content for the evening to end now, even though he hadn’t the faintest how to go about prolonging John’s presence in his room.
John’s mouth twists in a low-grade burst of anger. His typing is just fine, damn it.
“Such an arsehole,” says John, although he’s already working on Sherlock’s trousers, taking only a small modicum of care as speed is the real issue. Sherlock lifts and shimmies and John manages to get Sherlock nude with relatively little fumbling. “Oh well that’s… just look at that.”
“Are you intending to repeat what I say all evening? Because it’s becoming rather tedious. A bomb, John, that you put in the water. It fizzes, or something.”
grip.
“I don’t believe in fate,” Sherlock explains, places his palm on the floor so that their pinky fingers are just brushing. “But there are things… certain principles and amorphous ideas that I’d never considered before you.”
That had made him not want to go only marginally less.
“And then I’ll definitely have to call you my boyfriend,” John said, voice stronger, more sure, and grinned.
It takes him the better part of two days to get his LinkedIn profile to his liking, and he has to stop several times after becoming frustrated with his own slow progress. He figures out how to use his laptop’s camera in order to take a serviceable photo of himself, though that too takes ages. When he’s through, he browses the profiles of the people who are suggested to him; John is surprised to find many people from his own unit already on the website. He’s more surprised when he starts coming across the names of people he went not just to medical school with, but primary school. John hesitates, not wanting to reach out anyone just yet.
John returned to his room to shower and change, knowing that he would be missed on the slopes. Even with the rest of the racing postponed for the day, he and Sherlock both agreed that his absence would be conspicuous and so after a quick, sweet kiss, he headed back to Rosa Khutor.
Fingers made their way to the flesh at John’s hips and Sherlock slid down, trailing kisses and tongue all the way, making a point to glance up at John in that moment. Sherlock knew the effect it had on him, when he was poised to take John's cock into his mouth, the way John liked to see the desire in his eyes just before contact. After a moment, John tore his arm away from his face and glanced down, groaning loudly at the sight of Sherlock, mouth open and waiting.
Sherlock’s eyes narrow to slits, and, rather than looking confused, his interest is now clearly piqued. “Do you now?”
“Can’t stop thinking about him?” she asks, wistfulness in his voice, her inebriation clean in her speech and cheeks.
It was with a low, rough voice that John delivered his next words, so heavy and full of promise that the thrill Sherlock felt race down his spine manifested itself physically in a full body shiver. “Oh god, yes.”
Sherlock blinked at him, silent for a time before he murmured, “We.”
, that it’s not just work, but that you’re
Greg smiled widely, shrugging. “Oh, I know that, but that prick pisses me off; got one of his men to try and take Molls home last night.”
Glancing out at the bleachers, he saw they were packed with people, many waving flags. The Union Jack undulated and flapped in the wind and Sherlock felt a very brief pang of nationalistic honor.
There was sunlight peeking through the gaps in the curtains when Sherlock awoke and it again took him a few moments to place where he was. When it dawned on him that he was in John’s room, he was stricken to find that he was alone. That, in turn, led him to wonder about the time and he turned over, unable to find his watch on the bedside table. He stumbled from bed, scrubbing his hands through his hair as he did so; it had dried unevenly and he’d have to have another shower to straighten it out.
There are no more emails from Guest that evening, which is good, because John forgets to check his email until just before he goes to bed. For some reason he decides he wouldn’t like to leave a message from Guest waiting in his inbox for very long. Their interactions have very much felt like conversations, and lapsing in his end of the dialogue would make him feel as though he was being rude.
The clerk looked from the key to Sherlock and back to the key before she picked it up and examined it as though it was a foreign object. She ran it through the card reader, shook her head and turned back to him. “This is not the key to your room.”
If Sherlock was unsure if John could hear his heart racing before, he was absolutely certain of it now; he could hear the blood rushing in his ears, feel every single one of his pores as his skin pricked with goosebumps and Sherlock wrapped his arms around John’s waist to keep him close, keep him
It is, as ever, just the two of them, and the very last of John’s worries flake away. He shouldn’t have been scared to face the person whose held his heart so carefully for so long.
“Indeed. I’m glad Molly made this suggestion. I haven’t eaten here in ages.” Sherlock mentions, his thumbnail flicking at the edge of his menu.
John blinks and scrubs at his eyes with either hand. He’s only managed six hours of sleep. Sherlock’s broadcasting schedule combined with their unpredictable bouts of sex threw off his sleeping schedule.
Sherlock was fifth on the docket, and he remained calm and still while he watched the athletes prior to him explode through the starting gate and disappear from view. Members of his team wished him well, but they were all white noise to him, the only sound cutting through was the intercom announcing he was on deck.
He wakes again at three, parched and achey and with a raging headache. He has a cup of tea, takes Redbeard out around the back, in the little alley where Mrs. Hudson keeps her bins, and then returns to bed, researches a few cases on the internet as he compulsively checks his email and opens and closes new message boxes. He retires again to sleep once the sun has risen, finally pulling off his clothes and pulling the covers up over himself to the headboard, topping it all off with a pillow over his head.
John chuckles, grateful that the stasis is broken. “You knew I would.”
“Molly,” he said, finally managing to tear himself away, “shut up.”
This love he holds for Sherlock is a quietly-expanding miracle, one that is unfurling in his chest. It’s infinitely exhilarating and new, the carrying of this knowledge back to their room and John is glad that he can tell Sherlock is feeling similarly. It’s a bizarre miasma inside of him, feeling intently right, even, and whole, and entirely on edge from the suspense of discovering what Sherlock looks like, sounds like, spread beneath him in a bed.
Sherlock’s chest feels like it’s fracturing open with something very close to excitement, something that takes over the sensation he was experiencing at having a new case on. It feels fantastic. But there’s also trepidation warring with the feeling; what an interesting juxtaposition.
There was a lengthy pause before Sherlock said the only thing he could think of. “No.”
“Nothing, you’re…” John smiles at his own hesitation. “The best damn thing I’ve ever seen.”
Lestrade’s message was first and out of sheer habit, he read it:
“Oh.” And it’s apparent that he’s made his point rather plain; Sherlock doesn’t date. He needs John to know that.
and no one around them had any idea. Sherlock was pondering over why that made him so invigorated when John giggled, once. “That was… ridiculous, the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever done,” John said conspiratorially, even as he grinned up at Sherlock.
To him.
“Yes,” Sherlock agreed reluctantly. “We both have early mornings.”
No, this wasn’t just about money, this was about
“John!” Sherlock chirps, glancing quickly around to see if anyone is standing nearby. He’s not ashamed of who he is, but he’d rather they both avoid the soundbite after the one he’s already given. Admittedly, he should be a bit more careful with his words. The media circus when they had come out publicly as a couple had been ridiculous, and Sherlock—even four years in-is still trying to balance his personal and public lives.
he knew what to say. For a while he gazes at Redbeard, who is seated by the fire, gnawing contentedly at a beat up chew toy. He envies the dog, never having to suss out situations such as these. And even this, such a simple thing, seems to be completely beyond Sherlock. His thumbs tap aimlessly at the sides of his mobile for a bit before he sighs, and hits ‘Reply.’
“Well, knowing that this was my last Olympic race I vowed to pull out all of the stops, but once I began skiing it was as though… it was clear, it was all clear to me. I skied like I’d wanted to on this course, my body did what I asked of it, my team did what I asked of them and I won the gold.”
“They’re gorgeous, aren’t they?” Molly whispered, rounding the vice to stand next to him. “Can’t tear your eyes away.”
He didn’t glance back at his team or at any of the other skiers, his attention focused ahead, primed. He slid easily out of the hut. The air whipped him in the face; up there it was easily fifteen degrees colder than it was at the base of the mountain and the frigid temperature helped knock the last of the uncomfortable nerves from Sherlock’s stomach.
“Okay, but even if they were, how would we prove it?” Lestrade asked.
John climbs the steps up to the chaos of he and Rosie’s currently-shared room and pulls his bottoms and soft, distressed top from beneath his pillow. He’s careful about undressing, not wanting to rush it. He wants to get down to Sherlock as soon as possible, but there’s an element about all of this that requires savoring. The shifting from friends to lovers so keenly sweet, that he wants to keep the feeling in his chest for a moment longer, even as he wants to witness Sherlock curled beneath his sheets.
“Like what?”
“Oh right, yeah. Just thought we might-”
- he accepted them and slid them up onto the bridge of his nose. “Where’s Moriarty?”
John’s mouth twists as he thinks about it.
Moran took a breath and turned back towards his coat in the same moment that John coughed and sputtered and made a splitting sound. Sherlock could only see the tips of John’s shoes, but he knew Moran had gone for another blow to the face. John was made of something formidable, something absolutely brilliant; as a veteran of the RAMC, he’d surely seen pain, endured it. Rationally, Sherlock knew that John was the stronger of the two of them, but the incessant, terrifying worry for John ate at the tiny shreds of composure remaining. He could only hope that someone showed up while John’s teeth were still intact.
John sighs, feeling full, sweetly agitated by nerves, itchy to feel Sherlock. “C’mere,” he says very, very gently.
said he was skiing without reservation. He didn’t know rightly to what to attribute it, but it was undeniable that Sherlock was more
Sherlock eyes dull a bit and he sits back against the seat, wrapping both hands around his coffee.
but he, miraculously, does none of those things.
His username is simple enough: John5NF. On his profile page, he settles for his first name—common, innocuous—and a listing of his specialties and diagnostic capabilities. He’s careful to omit the fact that he graduated from Bart’s and that he is an army surgeon, but includes that he’s well versed in triaging trauma. Carefully, he rereads what he’s typed and then saves his profile.
him, wanted to get closer, deeper, in.
He was staring at the ceiling when Great Britain was called and was prodded along by Jenny Jones, who he graced with a scathing glare before righting himself and marching up the ramp. Sherlock did his best to plaster on a grin - the sponsors would love that - and gave a few half-hearted waves before giving up and walking along, maneuvering around teammates who’d stopped to take photographs or ham it up for the cameras that were focused on them.
John pressed his lips together in frustration, but crossed the room with Sherlock in tow; they flung themselves into the cupboard just as the front door rattled and opened. Sherlock stumbled and John fell into the wall, grabbing Sherlock’s shoulder to steady himself.
him--angered him to the core.
John chuckles and settles back more firmly into the plush valley created by a stack of pillows. “Can’t blame NBC Sports for causing wind, love.”
John nods, and then again and then he’s squeezing Sherlock’s face between his hands, dropping sloppy kisses. “Yeah. Yes. Yes, okay Christ, love you, I… am in fucking love with you.” It all comes out too fast, a whirlwind, breath skittering and hopping over the words so they sound like another language; they topple them both. It pulls at them, diffuses, makes their bodies seem somehow too small a vessel for what they’re trying to contain.
With an audible swallow, and a fleeting look at Sherlock’s face in profile, he returns to his box. There are several newspapers, which he flips through, before he finds a neon pink post-it note stuck to an advertisement for chimney liners. “Sherlock, what’s this?”
“Piss off.”
Snuffling, Sherlock turned over to face him, frowning.
“Hmmm?”
this?” he laments aloud, even going so far as to thunk his head off the door as he grasps at the hair above his ears. “Idiot!”
Barcelona,” Sherlock rolled his eyes. “A week, we’ll nap all afternoon and I’ll tend to your wounds and we’ll eat nothing but paella and drinking nothing but wine.”
he wants to type.
the email reads.
His back cracked as he stretched and he toyed with the idea of going for a swim. He needed something to tire him out for the evening; it wouldn’t do to go into tomorrow’s session on no sleep. Insomnia had plagued him for the better part of his adult years, and unless he was properly exhausted or took a sleeping pill, he was rarely able to doze off on his own. The swim would have to do, and just as he was about to lever himself up from the bed, his mobile gave a buzz.
His bottom lip trapped between his teeth, Sherlock panicked, trying to think of something to keep John close, to see him sooner, rather than later. “Or, perhaps, you might join me for dinner?” The words were out of his mouth before he considered how they might be received.
John shifted on his feet, looking down at his shoes, and when he glanced up, he had a smile on his face. It didn’t reach his eyes. “How’s this place, look okay?”
on his face. He wouldn’t be able to stand if it he were ridiculed because of this. He slumps down in his chair, just a bit, and hopes and hopes that once Sherlock is served his coffee, he will leave.
It smells different in the flat.
He couldn’t collect evidence on Moriarty without calling his own morality and previous accolades into question; if he was to accuse another athlete of cheating, his own record would be called into question. Every one of his victories, his years of training and dedication and sacrifice would be pored over, bit by bit. They would ask the same questions of Sherlock; were his victories legitimate or was he accusing Moriarty because he too indulged in unsportsmanlike conduct?
Sighing, he noted that someone had gathered up his belongings and had laid them all carefully out on the king bed.
“This man saved me from a murder charge!” Angelo booms.
“No, I suppose not.”
Bode laughs, shaking his head, as John holds out his hand and they shake, as Sherlock continues texting.
“Well,” Sherlock mumbles, sneaking a little lick to John’s skin. “I wanted to be… prepared.”
The lights in the room are low, but not off. Sherlock is glad for it; he wants to see John’s body thrown into chiaroscuro, seek out the dips and creases of John’s shadowy body with tongue and fingers.
he types.
It feels forced to him to reconnect with someone this way, especially his old Army comrades. Would they think him needy? Would they look on him as a charity case? He frowns at his own uncertainty and closes the screen, opting to head down to the Indian place on the corner and grab a quick bite, if only just to get away from the computer for a bit.
But Sherlock’s eyes linger; John catches him at it and he doesn’t look away. The moment feels oddly charged. “Well, at least gold is your color,” Sherlock says, an attempt at humor that lands somewhere else entirely.
“A codeine? A very stiff drink? Yes, please,” John huffs, reclining until his head tips back and meets the wall. “One or the other. Not both. Obviously.”
A thrill ran through him at his first glimpse and he very nearly smiled, catching himself just in time to turn his delighted laugh into a cough; the two mile course looked pristine and compact and he could very nearly feel his body flying over it already.
John’s not sure what makes him acquiesce, but a moment later he’s holding out his hand and saying, “Alright then,” and Sherlock is wrapping his long, soft fingers around John’s and helping him stand.
“Ah, no. Never seven times, not with… no. I’d say that’s impressive, but I do know you and your penchant for dramatic hyperbole. So.”
either.
With a groan, he spilled, John’s hand never leaving him, his lips just ghosting against the skin of his prick until he was through and spent, and he jumped when he felt John’s tongue at his thigh and his belly, smacking kisses against his skin.
“This! Honestly!” Sherlock grouses, voice clipped and testy, “was not outlined in the terms of my contract.”
Sherlock clears his throat, and takes an absurdly prim sip from his own glass of Lagavulin. His tongue even takes a pass over his lips before he speaks, “More to the point, not with any woman.”
Sherlock is lying in bed, thumb rubbing against the indent of the earpiece of his mobile, willing himself not to pick it up; Redbeard snuffles into his side and reminds him that he really ought to sleep but he can’t stop his mind from wandering back to the email waiting in his inbox.
John laughs. “You make it sound so appealing.”
find something.”
He smooths back the folds of Sherlock’s trousers and settles his palm over the hardness beneath. Sherlock’s cock, trapped in fabric, twitches at the contact. “God yes,” he hisses, still elevated on his elbows, and his head falls back, the entire white column of Sherlock’s delicate throat on display.
There’s something that lights in Sherlock’s eyes, something that seems almost dangerous. John takes a moment to work out exactly what’s being held there, and is unnerved and thrilled to find that it’s unguarded lust. It’s a striking look on Sherlock, colours his cheeks the slightest bit pink; John finds his mouth goes a bit dry just witnessing it.
“My room key doesn’t seem to be working now,” he said, flicking the card down against the wood laminate countertop at reception. Any and all patience he’d had he’d used when dealing with the small gaggle of fans; now, he was just tired and sore and jet-lagged.
John keeps speaking as though Sherlock hadn’t said a thing, “And the bottle of wine, that
His expression darkened but John didn’t see, staring steadfastly ahead. “Pardon?”
“Alright.” John doesn’t know what to do with his hands, so he lifts them from his sides a bit and then lets them fall.
Sherlock chuckles as well and they’re left staring at one another. John can read a number of things in Sherlock’s expression: relief, delight, whimsy, longing, and something else that makes John’s stomach somersault: desire. He hopes that Sherlock can see all of that in him, too, and so he grins, elation making him feel buoyant and unstoppable.
John chuckles at that, grabbing the bottle down. “Says the man who still cannot seem to remember that Mercury is a planet…”
His thumb hovers over ‘reply’ for a good, few moments before he actually taps it. And when he does, the blinking cursor mocks him. There and gone and there and gone. What on earth does he say to
had fun and… I don’t get on with many people. You’re very… honest, and that’s helpful. It’s uhm, it’s helpful.”
There seemed to be nothing out of place on the top level, just carefully-arranged rows of bolts and screws intended for skis. He did his best not to dislodge any of the items.
Sherlock’s left hand held John’s hip while the other cradled his damp testicles, rolling them in time with the pulls of his mouth. Still, John seemed restrained; he wasn’t bucking up or keening out, and it prickled at Sherlock.  “Oh, don’t hold back now,” he pulled off to growl and then pressed a knuckle over John’s perineum, slick with come.
For his part, Moriarty did as asked, holding up his hands in surrender even as he grinned manically. “Don’t forget, I do owe you Sherlock. I
John gave a bark of a chuckle, sucked a kiss into the rise of Sherlock’s hip and then took him into his mouth. Hot, tight wetness engulfed him and Sherlock sighed, his hands drifting to John’s hair of their own volition; they twined in the short growth, just holding on as John moved his head. His movements were heavenly, and Sherlock felt coils of tension he didn’t know existed give and release from his body as John tongued him. John gave wet little kisses at the head before slurping him down again, doing nothing to quiet the obscene noises he was making.
He can’t help it; Sherlock laughs at John5NF’s attempt at levity.
“Alright,” comes gently, and then, “But back to what I was asking about before, the sex was good, right?” John ribs and Sherlock laughs, guffaws, gathers John up and holds on, and the demons that they might have once held at bay are all but forgotten. There is perfection, right in this moment.
“Yes!” the coach said, finally perking and turning towards John, impaling him with his glare. “And apparently suspected murder as well!”
The only response he gave was a stern glare back to which she just shrugged and turned back to her conversation, leaving Sherlock to his thoughts.
“This is…” he sighs, glancing at all of the people in the park, at the couples strolling happily along hand in hand, at the pairs and groups of friends chatting and laughing. “Am I the only one who doesn’t understand this?”
His head swam pleasantly with the burn of alcohol and Sherlock found his mouth curling into a soft smile for no reason at all. Situations such as these usually tended to grate on his nerves. Now, this time felt
And the smarmy smile that Moriarty had given the camera, knowing that Sherlock was watching, knowing that Sherlock was aware of just how close he’d come to out-skiing him. Blinking his eyes open, Sherlock looked across the expanse of water to the other end of the tub, resolute. First, he would discover what he could about the members of Moriarty’s ski team, and then he would figure out where their weaknesses lay.
