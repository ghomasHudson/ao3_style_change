"Hmm . . . you're an odd one, John Watson," Sherlock said. He yawned a little. "Should we sleep now? I feel sleepy."
"I won't. I just . . . look, if you're happy with my apology, can we change the subject and talk about something else?"
Sherlock watched the interaction between the two men at the bar. There was something about one of them that registered -- where had he seen him before? Suddenly Sherlock realised he was being stupid. He was here to see the face of a criminal, not some random guy. As soon as he found the dealer, he could leave. There was no reason to be distracted by just because someone had a handsome face. Other people were not Sherlock’s department.
It had been a good week. Sherlock and John had been steadily doing research with occasional sleep in between (well, John had slept on behalf of both of them, Sherlock had decided). They had found what Mycroft had asked for, and last night after John had gone to bed, Sherlock had checked John’s notes and sent everything through.
“Partly,” Sherlock said. He won his solitaire game and as the cards began to bounce around the screen, there was a noise of applause so he quickly hit the mute button. “It’s going to be a little more complicated than yours,” he said loudly. “I hope that’s not a problem.”
"Well, we don't have to do anything, really. You can stick to your usual routine. I am going to take a shower in a bit," he said.
John was still in the kitchen when Sherlock arrived. "You know I don't mind if you smoke by the open window," he offered.
John shook his head lightly. "That's all right,” he said. “But I can assure you that everything is in working order." John tucked away the cheque and headed out to his van. He climbed in and crossed the address off of his work list before heading off to his next one.
Sherlock felt a surge of embarrassment but then John’s hand brushed past his cock and he forgot all about it. He quickly fully pulled off his pajamas and then grabbed at John’s shirt. “Take your jeans off,” he said, trying to get the shirt over John’s head.
Sherlock pushed himself up a bit on the bed. Then he reached down, trying to find his clothes which were at the foot of the bed. He got up quickly and slipped his trousers on.
“Finally he recruited a beautiful princess who revealed impressive skills valuable to the mission in a dramatic fashion."
"Sherlock, we are. That’s why you can’t go out – we’re only supposed to go out if it’s essential," he said.
“That’s funny,” Sherlock said. “Because I had to go to quite a bit of trouble to see you. You, on the other hand, had my phone number on my card. Yet . . .”
“You mean my body?” Sherlock asked. “You can look at whatever you need, I guess.” He shifted a little and winced in pain.
“I want to talk to the doctor,” Sherlock said. “I’m an adult -- neither you nor Mycroft are my guardians, for god’s sake. I’m not a child.”
“Are you sure you haven’t just come up with an excuse to get my signature to steal my identity?” Sherlock said. “I have yet to decide if you can be trusted.”
Sherlock pressed his face forward, trying to kiss John, but suddenly he realised he was going to come. He did his best to keep his hand going but had to let his hips go as he moved deep into John’s body. John pushed back against him, covering Sherlock's hand and stroking himself over the edge. He groaned softly, arching with pleasure.
“Then I may have some surprising news for you,” Mycroft said. “John’s moved on -- he won’t be at Baker Street waiting to tend your wounds. He has no reason to believe you are alive. Surely you remember his watching you fake your death?”
John sent the message and left his phone on the table as he went down to see Mrs Hudson with an extra mug of tea.
“No thank you,” Sherlock said. He reached for the remote and chose a quiz show. “That’s better,” he said. He picked up the book and tried to start reading again.
"I say what all the time? 'Take off my clothes'? I've never said that once in my life!" Sherlock said, mock offended.
"I don't care either way," Harry said. "It needs to be said to John and you're his . . . whatever you two are together."
"Um . . ." John said awkwardly. Sherlock was deliberately avoiding any discussion of what had occurred between them last night. "I'm going to get the paper,” he said, moving to the door.
He needed to talk to Sherlock. He couldn't keep going on without knowing for sure. He would phrase it as Mrs. Hudson's theory and see what the response was. Then he could judge from there if he should admit anything else.
“I’m not sure those logistics work well in the real world,” Sherlock said with a smile. He looked down and watched his hand to start to move slowly. He glanced back up. “Like this?” he asked.
He got out of bed and stretched, shaking his whole body out. He just needed to shake it all out, that's all. He would go downstairs and they’d head to Scotland Yard and everything would be fine. Normal.
Once he was finished, he went downstairs. He could see his parents out in the garden, so he made them a pot of tea and took it outside.
Sherlock stood up and stretched properly. He picked up the popcorn bag and put it in the bin. He got two glasses of water out and set them on the table by the sofa. “You can set your sleeping bag out,” he said. “I’m going to go brush my teeth.”
“It is not,” his mother said. “It’s too long -- you’re not in London now. We don’t take stupid chances here.” She handed him the coat and watched him put it on. “Very handsome.”
Sherlock smiled. Yes, this was definitely flirting. "I hope the dinner doesn't put you off any of those things," he said.
“They’ve said nothing to me, just to him apparently,” Sherlock said. “Would you go speak to them?” He glanced over at his brother. “John’s a doctor -- I’d like his opinion,” he explained.
John nodded discreetly as he climbed in beside her. They didn't talk much on the drive, but she really opened up more at dinner. John felt relaxed and happy, and she looked good, healthier than she had in a long time.
Sherlock lay flat on his back and stared up at the ceiling. He still wasn’t happy about being trapped out here, but tonight hadn’t been horrible really, especially after texting with John. Things felt different, though, and he still felt uneasy. Was it just because he and John were apart?
Except that wasn’t exactly true. Maybe it wasn’t just his assignment that was causing this irritation; it was the interaction with the short man that had thrown him off. Why? He didn’t know and he was embarrassed by it. He was best here at the flat by himself. He turned off the television, took a sip of wine, turned to lie down on the sofa, and closed his eyes.
Sherlock stepped into the room. "I thought maybe I could come in here to sleep," he said softly. "With you."
And with that, they headed out. There was now a slightly different partnership between Holmes and Watson.
John laid down normally and cuddled with him. "It's not like you were waiting with open arms," he grumbled.
John kept checking for messages between patients, but nothing came through. He half expected something from Mycroft but he was staying quiet as well. It was only 3:30 when John finished with his patients so he stayed over to work on charts and paperwork, watching the time. He was closer to the library here anyway, and if Mycroft was going to be putting a stop to this visit, he didn't want to be running all over.
"Yes," Sherlock said. "The first time." He was now covering John's abdomen with kisses. He tugged lightly on his pajamas. "Can I take these off?"
“I can help you, free of charge,” Sherlock said loudly. “Your wife is planning to leave you, you’re right. Not because of an affair but because you’re an idiot. Now get away from here, go home and self isolate for the rest of your life.”
However, it worried him that, even for a moment, he’d forgotten what would be happening today. He still didn’t remember the accident. He didn’t like not remembering.
John nodded. "Yes, but in your chair." He sighed and met Sherlock's gaze. "Have you really dreamt about me? What happened in yours?"
"Well, you definitely need to rest," he said. "And the flat can be really distracting for you, so it’s not an awful idea," he said.
“Well, look, I haven’t asked her yet or anything, but I was thinking that maybe we could go to this little place by my grandparents’ house. I think there’s a little cottage or something -- maybe we could stay there?”
Sherlock got up to get another cup of tea, but there was something in John's voice that worried him.
John stared at him. "What are you talking about, Sherlock? Do you want . . . do you want to be more than friends?"
John shrugged. "Sometimes you don't know until you find them," he said. "Could be right in front of you, couldn't they?" He smiled softly, suggestively, and took another sip of his drink before looking around the room again. Nearly everyone was there and in their seats, waiting for the party to arrive from their photos.
Sherlock returned with two glasses and handed one to John. He sat back down in his chair. “I appear to have feelings for you, John Watson,” he said. “That’s most unexpected, don’t you think?”
"Ah don't be like that. Oh, and don't forget. I WILL be calling upon you again. So-" A pause, "your arse is mine." Mycroft sneered and Sherlock smirked, waving him in dismissal. Mycroft mumbled under his breath before snatching up with umbrella and left.
"You heard me Mycroft." He snapped remaining motionless like a statue. Sherlock narrowed his focused back onto the reflection on the glass. Mycroft was staring at him but face was completely composed. No one outside the military nor government stepped foot into London District. It coordinated military and government operations for the United Kingdom. It even had ties with the Crown.
“Oh, when you had to meet someone.” He replied, switching to the other picture. He could see the Consulting Detective nodded from the corner of his eye. Picture 16 has three people sitting around a table and smiling. Cody had his arms wrapped around Samantha and a woman who appeared to be their mother. “So that’s her? Their mother?” John asked, turning the phone to Sherlock who nodded quietly. John examined the picture again. Finally John gave Sherlock his phone back. “You hide it well.”
Eyes narrowed to the outside of the window as he watched pedestrian upon pedestrian passed through Baker Street. His mind was slowly reiterating; rotting bit by bit. It was agonizingly annoying and tedious. Normal deduction began to come slower or almost not at all. His Brain was almost at a point of shutting itself down. Sherlock had tried everything from cases' to that damn bloody Rubik's Cube, which he ended up throwing it at Mycroft one day from its simplicity.
Sherlock only shook his head, “Its not Jeanette, but someone else.” He replied, handing John the phone. “Sounds like some woman who is approximately around 20 years of age.” John had already put the phone to ear and said hello.
“What?” John questioned innocently. Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him, making John laugh. He knew what he was getting on about.
“Okay. Oh, this is my cell number if you were wondering. Um, I have to go. I’m a little late for class. Bye….Dad.” And with that she hung up. John pulled the phone away, quickly adding her number into his contacts.
Sherlock was escorted to an area that suited his supposed assignment in an international investigation-which was completely fictional. It helped that Mycroft was pulling the strings, allowing Sherlock to break into Home District. The major-general led the way into a chemistry lab where they met two soldiers. One was Captain John Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Special Operations and the other was Major James Moriarty of the Royal Corps of Signal.
John thought over everything that has just occurred. Cody, Samantha, Joanna. Their children. What would happen if they all meet? “It’d be interesting.” John blurted suddenly. Sherlock looked over him, deducing his meaning. He must have seen that he was thinking of his daughter, judging by the small smile and the spark in his eyes.
"I've worked with several people of whom were difficult." A smirk played on his lips, just a twist of his mouth upwards. "So consider this challenge accepted, Mr. Holmes." Sherlock stared at John as the Captain turned to the major and gave some orders that needed to finished before anything could begin. Watson didn't seem very or rather overly military but his body language told him that Watson was very serious about his job.
After the introduction of the Captain and Major, Watson stepped forward, extending his hand, " It'll be a pleasure working with you Mr. Holmes. They had assigned us to the over site and development of your investigation." Sherlock shook the hand firmly. His eyes never left John's as he sized the captain up more.
“As far as I know, there will not be any cases unless my brother up and decides to start a war on me.” Sherlock said, “Then we’d have to cancel the arrangement.” John could only roll his eyes chuckling. Of course, Sherlock’s Arch Enemy. It seemed that Sherlock wanted to meet Joanna as well John noted silently to himself.
“I would have thought that they would have yours and Mycroft’s type of relationship.” John jested, earning a chuckle.
"You, Sally Donovan." His rich voice drawn into a murderous threat, "You and Anderson now work for me. You have no choice and nor does anyone else I pull into my web. My brother has your boss Lestrade under his spell now as we speak, meaning there is no where you can hide from me or my brother." He smirked as he watched Sally take of it in. He moved a little bit closer to her face with malice. Sally turned her face away, "You are trapped Donovan. Don't worry. It clear that you are not the only one." She glanced at him suddenly, an eyebrow raised as if to ask, 'Who?' Sherlock clinged his jaw, annoyed by the silent question. Nosy much? But he mused himself with the thought of a certain Captain and Major being caught in his grasp. "As you would know, the others' under my control are not for you to know. Your job is to lure Anderson under your spell. I'll take it from there. But of course, you two are already intimiate. Just get him to take the bait and bring him to me. Say, at noon tomorrow. Scotland Yard." He ordered and Sally nodded her head reluctantly. He made to leave, only to turn to her frozen state, "Oh, one more thing Sargent Donovan. If you think to reveal any of my plans, you wouldn't see the daylight again. You're freedom would be snatched out from under you. Remember who is always watching." Sherlock smirked, giving a sarcastic wink. Donovan winced as he left, vanishing deeper into the shadows.
Sherlock shrugged his shoulders. He turned, getting two cups from the cabinet. John walked over, leaning against the countertop. “I’ve known for say, four years. Kept tabs on them for a while. Hated to know that Mycroft had to tell me after 14 years. I was really pissed off because I didn’t know.”
Sherlock leaned forward coming inches from his brother's ear, "Damn jurisdiction Mycroft. Jurisdiction can go to hell in London. Damn. District." He hissed murderously, digging into the British Government's wrist with every word. Mycroft winced, clinging his jaw.
“I’m off from the Surgery that week, so it works for me.” John answered. Sherlock nodded his agreement. Yep, John was right about Sherlock wanting to meet her.
Sherlock hung in the shadows of a residential building, watching Donovan and Anderson. His target tonight; Sargent Sally Donovan of New Scotland Yard. His eyes narrowed impatiently as Anderson gave a quick goodbye kiss. Sally smiled at him then started to walk down the sidewalk. Sherlock sank deeper into the shadows, stalking after the Sargent. She crossed the street and that was when Sherlock pounced. He grabbed her from behind, snatching her into the darkness of a nearby alleyway. Sally gave Sherlock a good fight but he quickly pinned her arms and head, making her immobile. He pinned her against the brick wall to farther trap her, "Enough!" he quietly sneered, making Sally freeze when she heard the sociopath's voice. Her breathing became heavy and gradually started to become shaky. "All I want is to talk. I need you and Anderson for an important job." Sherlock snarled into her ear. " I'm going to let you go and you better not do anything against me. I would know long before you could even think it." He warned, voice cold and dangerous. Sherlock had already calculated the many choices that were available to Sally. She had no taser nor her gun. She must have left it at her flat, or Anderson's.
Well, they weren't inside the building itself; Mycroft had been waiting for him outside in the gardens, back turned and umbrella firmly planted on the floor between his feet.
"I trust this is sufficient information for now? I can brief you about the details on the car ride over. We're going outside of London, I'm afraid" Mycroft said with the same level tone as when they had first met.
There was a naked, skeletal figure lying on the concrete floor, its long hair matted beyond salvation and its hipbones and ribs sticking out from under its stretched, bruised skin. It was lying on its side, facing the wall and it had a collection of half-healed gashes all over its back.
He felt his vision tunnel and his stomach lurch as he swayed, reaching out to hold onto something so he wouldn't pass out. His heart felt like he'd had just injected it with fatal doses of adrenaline and he feared the poor thing was going to give out under the stress.
"Yes, it's me. I'm right here" John was so emotional he thought he was going to start crying, but he was also smiling so wide it hurt as he stroked his fingers over the  naked skin of Sherlock's extremely thin wrist.
They had dinner together and it was not as bad as he had thought it'd be. It went by in companionable silence and once again, John could admit that Mycroft's pain over his brother most likely matched his own and that the knowledge was comforting.
No sleep came to him that night, he just shook and cried. He was starting to admit defeat; he was starting to understand that this was his life now. And that maybe, just maybe, no one was coming for him. That, after a month, Mycroft might never have gotten the message.
Both the detective and his doctor stopped in their tracks to look back at her. John looked very unfriendly, with his arms crossed over his chest, and one step ahead of his lover like a bodyguard.
He settled on making a pile of hardcover books and placing them by Sherlock's side "Just don't move too much or you'll knock it over" he cautioned. And then he glanced back towards the kitchen "We should have eaten at the table…"
His throat tightened and he closed his eyes. It was like his entire being was recoiling from the scene. This was- god, this was-
John had his mouth closed and expression closed off for a good few seconds, picking his words carefully. "You don't
Lestrade sighed and then looked up at the younger detective "Look, just- just tell me what you find, ok? I'll be- I need to get an ID on these guys, so if there's even a small chance-"
Needless to say, by the time Mycroft came to collect them, they were both barely done with getting ready.
The way that his detective was staring at him so directly made him shudder and he couldn't bring himself to reach into his pants and take his cock in his hand.
Her answering smile was a bit boyish and for the first time Sherlock noticed she was sporting a brand new pixie cut.
doesn't know that." He retaliated. "I know Jim Moriarty is dead, and I know we dismantled his intelligence, but the foot soldiers still exist."
"You asked me to marry you. In sickness and in health, 'till death do us part. Don't tell me you deleted that too? Wedding vows?" he was teasing, but it earned him the smallest smile from his detective.
Slowly, he let himself fall on top of his lover; he felt boneless. He hid his face in Sherlock's neck and just breathed him in for a good couple of minutes.
During one of their strolls around the city, they had passed a couple of men – tourists – who were animatedly talking to each other and pointing to their map of London. It had been in the earlier days of Sherlock's recovery, and most importantly, the men had been speaking Serbian.
Acquiescing, Sherlock tried to right himself a bit and then cleared his throat. He drew in a deep breath, squeezed John's hands and let his love flow out of him without restraint.
The doctor sighed, knowing a lost battle when he saw one. "We'll talk to Mycroft. See what the doctors have to say. They need to be ok with discharging you." And that last part was something neither he nor Mycroft would be willing to waive.
"Don't you see, John?! There will always be another Moriarty! There will always be another Serbia!" he bit out "It doesn't matter if I'm wrong about
He felt it build up like no other orgasm he'd had before. It was intense and overwhelming and he thought he'd black out for a second there.
He couldn't see John's fingers actually disappearing into himself, but he watched with intent the expressions his doctor made. And then John shifted so that he was rocking back onto his fingers and rocking forward to grind their cocks together.
He memorized their faces – or what was left of them – and both thanked and cursed Mycroft for having took care of them without inviting him to the party. A part of him wanted to believe he was above barbaric acts like this, the men had obviously been tortured before death, but he honestly wasn't so sure.
John propped himself up onto his elbows despite really not wanting to move and looked at his partner worriedly "Hey, talk to me? Are you ok?"
Sherlock could practically see it when he made the connection, from the telltale intake of breath he tried to hide, to the minute widening of his eyes, to slight tremor in his hands. He looked away before John could look up at him.
One day, the battleground was a bowl of green jelly and John decided to stop being such a coward and intervene. He had a hunch why Sherlock kept turning the food away, and part of the reason he didn't voice it was in fear that he was wrong and would be mocked – by whom?? – for his assumptions.
"I'm- I'm sorry?" the kid looked terrified. He'd obviously been informed that Sherlock Holmes ate Yarders for breakfast.
Come August, Sherlock had actually started leaving the flat with John. He wasn't jogging, of course, but they took strolls around the park a couple times a week and then finished the evening at Angelo's to eat some dinner. The detective joked, on the second time, that it was their date night, but it actually stuck and after that those days were known as such.
The conference room was filled with reporters and officers alike. It was the same annoying, loud, sensationalist spectacle as all the times previous. The only difference was the reaction of the Yarders who had actually been working on the case with him.
"Hey! Where are you going?!" Lestrade shouted at them when it was clear they were making their way to the opened door.
The subsequent silence and Greg's taken aback expression left no doubt that both of them had seen it.
They lazed about in bed for a few minutes still, but then John's stomach was growling and they both grinned at the sound. "Breakfast?" the doctor suggested, and the detective acquiesced.
"We need to actually put our clothes on!" John admonished, but the severity of the statement was ruined by the following kisses he allowed Sherlock to place on his lips.
Slowly, he made his way to his armchair and sat down, looking around a bit thoughtfully before settling on "I didn't- I wasn't trying to talk about you behind your back." He said, finally looking his friend in the face.
Of course, the detective knew the logistics; he'd been on the other side of the logistic hundreds of times. He just had no idea how it was done when you actually cared whether or not the person in the receiving end was in pain.
The third one hurt more than the first two. He was bigger, rougher, and the detective was already aching by the time he'd started fucking into him mercilessly.
There was an overwhelming response of laughter and mocking as the men clapped their friend on the back.
"I lost contact with him on his final mission; he was going into Serbia to dismantle the last of Moriarty's web." Mycroft started, and this time even he was unable – or unwilling – to keep eye contact. He was looking at the glass in his hands as he spoke "He managed to send us the coordinate for the base, but it took us three months to receive and act upon the information."
John put a hand up in interruption "You think- you think this is some show Moriarty's putting on to mess with your head?"
Another officer mentioned something about the light, and the room being at least slightly above ground, but John's attention was completely focused on his lover's face.
Sherlock made the same offer to every single one of them that day, and all but one accepted it. It was a much welcomed break for his arse, but it came at a high cost.
"I know" the detective replied after a while. "You keep them in your left pocket ever since that incident with the tourists."
He was shoved onto the floor, his head colliding sharply with the concrete as one hand held it there, his cheek scraping on the harsh floor. His arms were pinned behind his back by another pair of hands that cared very little about the open wounds there. And then his hips were being pulled up off the floor so he was propelled onto his knees, his arse up in the air and legs roughly spread apart.
John finished what he was doing, put the supplies away and then came back to sit on the bed. Only then did he nod in acknowledgement and encouragement for the detective to go on. He could tell this was going to be a delicate conversation.
"Yes" Sherlock half moaned, half gasped, curling his toes and arching even more. God, his nerves were lighting up like a bonfire inside him. "Faster, John" he tried to say, his voice coming out much lower and husky than his usual baritone.
It shouldn't. The men who'd raped him in Serbia had been straight, for the most part. Sexuality didn't matter in these things, did it?
"That's the whole point. They're not in London anymore" The detective said, standing up from his seat in a rush.
At once, John got up from his seat, journal forgotten, and put his hand carefully behind his friend's back, trying to prop him up.
Footsteps were heard outside and then one of Sherlock's doctors walked in hurriedly. John was, again, ordered to leave. And this time, the doctor's expression made it clear he'd be bodily removed by security if he did not comply.
But the woman didn't look terribly apologetic even as she drawled lazily "I'm sorry I said you get off on snuff films."
"Well, we don't know for sure how or if he's tied to the murders at all, but he's the owner of the house." The DI gestured towards the property up ahead.
When they were all crammed into the short space of the evidence room and Sherlock was given access to the men's belonging, Donovan was the one to pick the conversation up again.
He felt his entire body tense up, his hands tightening on the chart, memories flowing into his mind unbidden- Sherlock's voice as he asked him to
"You remember Baskerville? How my mind was playing tricks on me? I haven't felt like that since then. But today- I just-" he shook his head "I was convinced it was Moriarty."
She had positively imprinted on him after the rescue. Before her, Sherlock couldn't recall ever staying to see to a victim's wellbeing, and he didn't think he ever would again. He had spent hours with her at the hospital on that first night, until her parents were able to fly in from Australia last minute. Really, it wasn't surprising that she'd want to see him again.
She hungrily reached for it, immediately denied the call and dialed 999. Sobbing and almost screaming, she told the operator that she'd been kidnapped and that she didn't know where she was-
As he climbed down the stairs to the basemen two at a time, he couldn't believe he hadn't realized it before. The house had wood flooring all throughout, and it all made the same hollow sound because of the basement. But the basement wasn't big enough. It wouldn't be possible for him to walk up and down the main corridor, all the while hearing the sound travelling the exact same way if there wasn't an equally large space underneath.
"You know what I'm thinking about" the detective couldn't help the frustration that bled into his voice.
John ran his fingers through his hair and kissed him softly on the mouth. "What are you thinking about?" he asked with much more composure than someone who was just having his cock sucked was allowed to have.
"Sherlock!" John called, jogging over to him as soon as he spotted him near the back wall. "Are you ok?!" he asked, looking the detective up and down, as he held onto the man's forearms.
Each time Sherlock woke up, John's reaction was essentially the same, until he became accustomed to it and his desperation turned into a sort of resigned acceptance. He was calmer in calling the nurse and staying out of their way as they saw to the detective's needs. But Sherlock never spoke, never acknowledged them; he just opened his mouth and was out again after a couple of minutes.
"A snuff film company. They're selling videos of these girls, everything from the rape to the murders – it's all recorded."
He glanced to the toilet to his left, and he hated that it was steel, bolted to the floor. At that moment, had it been ceramic, he have broken it with his bare hands and slit his own throat. John would have forgiven him, surely? He would have understood?
And by 'we', he meant that John had sat and watched – bored out of his skull – as Sherlock stared through his microscope for hours, humming here and there and thinking out loud.
"Look, I- I'm not going to lie and say that I don't- that I don't wonder about what happened, but I'm not-" John continued "If you want to tell me, I'm here and I'm gonna listen, but if you- if you don't want to talk about it, I get it."
It grew into something he knew he wasn't going to be able to control, he could feel it coming and he had to run. He couldn't do this to Sherlock, he couldn't shift the attention onto him when it was his friend who was hurting, who had been-
"God, yes" he breathed out, kissing Sherlock again before parting only long enough to pull both his and Sherlock's shirt off.
"It's the casualties. Moriarty's men" Sherlock offered before he could help it; he couldn't stand the look John'd had on his face.
The detective shifted a bit and stole a quick kiss, bumping their noses in acknowledgement of his lover's apprehensive expression.
Going to the bathroom turned into one of the most terrifying moments of his current predicament. The pain was so great that he actually sobbed when he had to do it, and the feeling of humiliation afterwards just made it that much worse.
"I want…" the detective started, eyes closing and mouth searching John's like he thirsted for it. They met in a wet, sloppy kiss that was all tongues and moans.
Sherlock had refused to think about what the four men had done to him. He even tried dismissing the whole thing as a figment of his Moriarty-riddled imagination. But the presence of this new assailant only seemed to confirm what he had feared; he had a new role in the enemy base now.
They had apparently only come to gloat, for afterwards they left and Sherlock didn't hear a sound from them for another good hour. He wasn't sure whether or not to feel relieved that they did not kill him right away like he had expected.
"I know that" Sherlock said, as though it was obvious, but he still looked around with suspicion. "I'm- I should go back to my room." He said then, and John didn't argue.
"Mr. Holmes, calm down" she tried to soothe him by stepping away and giving him space "You're fine, you're alright. I'm just going to get you cleaned, that's all."
His voice was the softest John ever remembered hearing it, save for when Sherlock was faking it for a case with his rather extensive acting skills.
And so, like he had fantasized a million times before, John moved up on the bed and put his leg over Sherlock's side to sit on his lap. They were both breathing erratically, eyes fixed on each other, pupils dilated and mouths open.
Sherlock looked down and saw John's hand moving inside his trousers, but after another moment John finally pulled himself out completely, stroking himself out in the open for him to see.
It was a milestone in his recovery, talking to Mycroft. Sherlock was finally talking, being – a somewhat subdued version of – himself and he was making progress in quick strides.
Amanda was smiling a bit shyly at him "We talked a lot about you, that day. You're sort of the reason why I didn't shoot him, to be honest." She admitted sheepishly.
John shifted back a bit so he could see his lover's face properly. Then he ran his hand comfortingly over Sherlock's even as he frowned in confusion "Paranoid about what?"
And Sherlock did. Soon they were thrusting up and into each other, and John couldn't believe how amazing it was to have something hammering against his prostate like that. He bent over, unable to hold himself properly upright and reached for his own cock, tugging at it rapidly because he knew he was almost there.
Sometimes he'd look at John and he'd frown like he was trying to deduce him and he'd ask softly, "John?" again and again, as often as he asked about being home.
The doctor sighed against his lips and nodded. "Alright, go on then. I'll heat us some soup." He said, trying to sound more cheerful.
There was a gasp from the detective, but it was clearly not a bad one, so John grew more encouraged. He kept running the tips of his fingers up and down his lover's skin, past his entrance to his perineum to the base of his balls and then back. He never breached him, just felt around, exploring, as his lover arched into his touch.
"Oh, you know what, I think I'm gonna run to the desk for a bit, see if they have some aspirin. I have this headache and…" he trailed off, still not looking Sherlock in the eye lest he'd give himself away.
Encouraged, Sherlock moved his hand up and down, slow at first but then picking up a pace once John's hips started moving ever so slightly with him. It was mesmerizing to see his army doctor completely flushed and open and wanting.
Unprompted, Sherlock cleared his throat and started speaking "I, ahm, didn't mention it before, because I didn't- I didn't want to explain it." He said carefully.
"Sherlock, will you- what are you trying to get at?" it was four in the morning and John wasn't sure his brain was working properly anymore.
On those days, when Sherlock showed signs of awareness, John would help him onto a wheelchair and would roll him out to the balcony. It took a lot of maneuvering, but the detective was very cooperative; he followed instructions in a way that spoke of severe conditioning.
"Keep going" the detective told him, his hand caressing John's thigh lethargically. "I want to feel it."
Sherlock honestly had expected to be back before John's return from Tesco but the crime scene had been further away than he had anticipated.
Like the first time Sherlock had ever touched him, the detective took his time. He looked at first, then brought his fingers up to stroke him a couple of times before finally leaning down and licking experimentally at the head.
He took the spoon, scooped some jelly out of the bowl and extremely awkwardly brought it to his own mouth and gestured to himself after he'd eaten it, as though to say
when I'm right." he bit out, using a sharp voice he rarely used on his lover. "I'd have made these same deductions with or without Serbia. These men are not doing this for fun! They're intelligent, precise, and they have a clear goal; we're dealing with professionals." He picked the shoe up again pointedly and looked away from John. "If you're going to keep acting like the lot of them" his chin gestured towards the door "then by all means go outside and join them while I work to actually catch the murderers."
"She's got cuffs on her feet." He told the doctor, and John nodded before disappearing off to fetch one of the goons from the fire department.
Sherlock huffed in disdain, like John had just won himself a place near Anderson in the consulting detective's scale of regard. He dropped the shoe onto the table and turned to look at his lover with undivided attention.
One moment the doctor was standing by his partner, and the next he had his hands fisted into the Sergeant's lapels and was shoving the woman up against the wall.
Sherlock spared him another glance before returning to his work; the gloves finally coming off since they were alone in the room.
He stood there looking positively befuddled, glancing between her and the people walking around them. He had no idea what to do with himself or what to say. He even tried to open his mouth a couple of times to form some kind of reply, but none would come.
Truth was: they weren't expecting him to escape, and that confidence only played into Sherlock's favor.
"When I was there… I wanted to die. But there was nothing I could do about it, there was no way to kill myself. All I could do was exist and take it. The thought of being captured like that again- it's paralyzing me, John."
John nodded, even if his lover couldn't see it and then proceeded to pull out at a ridiculously slow pace.
After that, they seemed convinced Sherlock wouldn't try to maim them and so it set a precedent for them to finally use his mouth, too. But when the next one pulled on his hair to make him open up, he shook his head violently and said "Wait, wait!" desperately before he could help it.
"Sir! Found something!" One of the agents shouted and he quickened his pace to follow her into the cell she'd entered.
"Thank you for your service" one of them said in Serbian, and he heard the sound of someone spitting before he felt a wet glob landing on his back. Then the door shut behind them and Sherlock was alone.
Once they had established the possible locations versus the amount of time the kidnappers had needed to arrive, finding their abandoned station was a matter of minutes.
"Listen, Sherlock, ahm. We just, ah, you know that we were monitoring the live streams?" he started, and the younger man stiffened immediately.
On one particularly sunny afternoon, the detective seemed more agitated than usual. He kept shifting on his chair and licking his lips over and over. When John noticed and asked him if he was thirsty, Sherlock turned his head to look at him very slowly and nodded.
Something in his lower stomach pulsed acutely every second of every day. It was such a constant state of pain that it soon became impossible for him to lift himself off the floor.
Sherlock was taking in the vast expanse of green, the trees, the blooms of dandelions and daisies that grew unbidden and he had to close his eyes for a moment. It was almost like a dream that he was standing here, holding onto John, when he had been half dead, locked in a freezing basement a couple of months ago.
At that, Sherlock looked up, part confused and part alarmed. "Not at Baker Street anymore? What are you talking about, not at Baker Street anymore?"
When they made it up the stairs, Sherlock made a beeline to their room and John only stopped to leave his trousers in the laundry bin before following the detective.
"I can bring my mattress in here" John offered, trying with all his might to sound casual. "I just- I don't want to crowd you."
His mind had gone off a mile a minute, making calculations and tracing the ricocheting sounds of the bullets back to one of the rooms bellow. But when he threw the door open, the body he saw on the floor wasn't that of a girl.
"No. Not this time, no." And he came out of the kitchen like a soldier stepping into battle. He gave Sherlock his mug and placed his own forcefully on the side table before turning towards the door just in time to see Lestrade and Sally Donovan come in.
"Of course" Sherlock echoed, looking at the pictures again and again. The corpses had obviously not been in an explosion of any kind.
That was the first time since Sherlock first woke up three weeks ago that the detective smiled, a hint of amusement in his eyes- it was so aware, so deliberate, so
There were a lot of smiles being thrown around over food and books, and once they both had had their breakfast and their morning papers out of the way, John stretched and said "Do you want to try going outside today? Look at it, it's beautiful"
Sherlock didn't eat the jelly that day, but later that week he managed a successful trip to the bathroom. And high as he was on his victory, when they brought him soup the following day, it hadn't seemed as daunting.
It wasn't always terrific though. Sometimes the weather was too chilly for John to want to risk going outside. Sometimes Sherlock would sleep the whole day away. Sometimes it was just- hard.
The silent gaze was held for such a long time that his brother was the one to smack his lips together pointedly as he swayed back and forth. "Well, then. I have a car waiting for me. Anthea will get in touch and you can sort it out with her when you'll want to go have it installed." He said, tapping his umbrella once on the floor.
"Sherlock!" the older detective shouted, irritated as he trailed after him much like John and Sally.
John swallowed "Oh. Ahm, well, Mycroft- he got a message and he went in. He went there with a team, I think. And they brought you home."
Sighing very loudly and rolling his eyes in exasperation, Sherlock plopped down onto John's chair and gestured vaguely with his left hand before remembering his missing fingers and hiding them in the pockets of his dressing gown. Lestrade, unsurprisingly, hadn't noticed. "It's the case, John. The same one with the water samples we looked over yesterday."
He was as surprised by this question as he had been two nights before when Sherlock asked if he could touch him. Strangely, this one seemed even more unexpected.
Sherlock was the one to take it in his gloved hand. And despite his usual knack for figuring out gifts, he couldn't venture a guess as to what he was holding.
just contaminated my crime scene" Lestrade told him, gesturing to the trash can, but it was half-hearted. "Alright, alright. You go and feed his nibs chicken soup or whatever it is- but have him text me when you get home, alright? I need to know if he's got anything on the room."
The background picture was of a sandy-haired man smiling at the camera. He had a green jumper over a button-up shirt and one hand sticking out as though he had taken the picture himself.
When Sherlock woke up the first time, at night, it almost gave John a heart attack. He had simultaneously jumped off his chair, ran to the bed and tried to page the nurse all the while holding his flatmate's hand and searching his face for any signs of- anything, really.
He went to their room, changed into proper trousers and a jumper before going to Sherlock and brushing their hands together softly. It was strange how they'd developed this Thing with their hands – It was a Thing now. John guessed it had a lot to do with how Sherlock's hands were a vivid reminder of what the man had survived and of the weeks John had sat by his side holding them.
He could feel as John paused behind him "You have me" the doctor replied just as matter-of-factly as he placed a kiss as punctuation on the detective's shoulder.
Their position and the staggering amount of cloth around them weren't terribly conducive to the task, but John had put men back together in the desert with whisky, rags and a prayer – he could make this work.
He was made to do some very simple physio from his bed, mainly someone would ask him to push against their hand with his feet, or hold them up off the bed without letting them fall. It did, eventually, lead to him being ok'ed to try and walk for the first time.
This time, the doctor had no response to give. Instead, he looked at Sherlock intently, his expression serious and thoughtful.
That really didn't answer much of his question, but then he supposed John wouldn't know. John didn't know about his mission, about Moriarty, about anything- John thought he was dead- how was John even here? He frowned.
is why I didn't want you involved. You're going to attach meaning to everything I say. You think I'm trying to- to what? Give myself some kind of closure?" his expression reminded John of when Sherlock had been angry at him for starting to believe Moriarty's lies, back before The Fall.
John never actually asked what the boundaries were, and Sherlock never actually offered them either, they just stumbled their way blindly into it, holding onto each other for support as they went.
John looked at him searchingly, worried, but he just gave him a small smile in response; they kept walking.
"Congratulations. We mean it." And then he patted both men on the back, before straightening his suit and nodding "Alright. Well, shall we get going? I told Amanda we'd meet her at the hospital at four."
There was silence as Sherlock seemed to contemplate what he'd said, or as he thought about something else altogether. Finally, the detective laced his fingers together over his lap and looked at him.
But those same hands that shook were lifting off his lap and offering the pictures to John like one would offer their heart up for slaughter.
"John, I've… never done this before. You have to show me what to do." Sherlock spoke then, lying back against the pillows and looking half debauched and half lost.
The detective sucked him down expertly, his tongue flattening against the underside of John's cock and then swirling at the top before he went right back down again. His hands were passively, and a bit tensely, by his side, but John didn't think too much of it. He couldn't think much, period.
It was nothing personal. They weren't trying to actively hurt him or torture him anymore; he was simply an unexpected spoil of war. The men would walk in, do their business and walk out, relieving their biological drive like one would walk into the loo to take a piss before getting back to work.
"I've got a few officers going through the tapes, apparently it's one house per girl. It's hard to say how long they stay in each location, though."
John wasn't sure what Mycroft had told Greg exactly, but it seemed that the DI knew not to give Sherlock more than he could chew. The case wasn't easy enough to be patronizing, but it wasn't one that required running around. It also didn't pose the threat of running into any killers since, apparently the killer was already dead; there were two bodies, and the whole point was trying to figure out who had been the victim and who had been the murderer.
The look on John's face was one Sherlock wasn't certain he wanted to dissect. He actually looked befuddled, but it was a look that carried a bit of pity.
"You're going to apologize and you're going to mean it, because we're not wasting this lead." Lestrade said very matter-of-factly.
He counted the steps as he walked across the basement, and surely enough, he came up a least 10 steps short.
This is, indeed, the end of it. And I didn't mean for the ending to be a cliffhanger? It's more of an idea of what's going to happen in the sequel (aka, the equivalent of Did you miss me? hah).
"I'm upset I haven't gotten to the end of this already." The detective said curtly, but at the same time he shifted closer to John's warmth.
Lestrade looked from one to the other, feeling the tension between them. Then he shook his head "He ran when we heard the bullets."
He looked up to see John coming over with two platefuls of beans, toast and sausage. One of the plates was placed before him, and John nodded to it.
Sherlock pulled away just in time to look down and see the spurts of come coat John's fingers and stomach; the man's whole body spasming as he climaxed. It was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen in his life.
"Why do you want to be alone with her, Freak?" Donovan demanded, her face twisting in disgust as she crossed her arms over her chest. "Finally showing your true colors, are you?"
"Well, I must be on my way; I believe we're done here?" he asked, and he wasn't trying to be unkind.
They exited the car together and slowly made their way up the seventeen steps, one by one. Mycroft and the minion went up ahead to get the doors and leave their things in the living room.
"Grinning about corpses, now what would Mrs. Hudson have to say about that?" John teased, relieved at the sincere answer.
lost my mind?!" John yelled back, and he was so angry. "Are you deaf? Did you hear what she just said?"
It was slow and dragged out, but it was done skillfully, and Sherlock grew harder the more it went on. When John finally put one of his fingers in, the detective felt no discomfort whatsoever. In fact, the whole thing was so extraordinarily different that his brain didn't even know to make the connection between the act and what'd been done to him in Serbia.
"Not just that, John. We've seen idiots make worse mistakes before." He pointed to the windows in the still of the screen "There were no shadows from the train. The lightbulb didn't swing and there was no sound, so I dismissed it. But
He wasn't sure if it was the fact that they were looking at his face, or if the men simply had dormant kinks. But they were much more brutal with his mouth than they were with his arse. One of them clearly got off on choking him and hearing him gag; he came back for seconds that day.
The confession was something he'd never thought he'd make, but he'd been feeling like this for months and it was finally coming to the surface.
In the video, the men had turned their victim around so she was up on her knees, her face down on the mattress as one of them kept her there with his foot. When the man took her again, Sherlock had to stare off to the side for a moment. He knew that position intimately.
John came over to him and he looked confused "Sherlock? You ok?" he asked, actually having to lean down to look at his lover's hidden face.
"This can't possibly be inside the city. The entire neighborhood would have heard it." Lestrade commented, both to break the ice and to get the ball rolling on observations. They needed to focus on the facts that would lead them to finding the girl's location.
In an uncharacteristic move, Sherlock arched ever so slightly so that he pointedly brushed against his lover's erection.
They moved into their room, and John promptly stood by their side table, hand poised over their lamp. "Lights on or off?"
He had his knife on him and he even managed to nick the man's arm with it before he was quickly subdued and thrown on the ground.
Sherlock had decided, after much deliberation, to forgo the white gloves he'd initially planned to wear at the wedding. There weren't many ways around it if he wanted John to slide a ring onto his finger. And the thought of hiding that ring, the one that bore John's name, under gloves until the end of time – he couldn't do it. So the gloves came off, never to be worn for hiding again.
He was dragged toward it, the chain on his right leg long enough to allow it, and placed before it on his knees. Then he was bent forward so that his torso lay on the chair and both his arse and mouth were roughly at crotch level for the men who kneeled around him in a circle. It wasn't as comfortable as it would have been if he'd been able to stand on all fours, especially when the wooden chair dug into his broken ribs, but it was better than the contortionist position he'd been in before.
Sherlock could only watch, hungrily, as John opened the bottle cap with movements that spoke of familiarity and coated his fingers with lube before reaching behind himself. His doctor had long grown out of any shame when it came to pleasuring himself in front of Sherlock. A huge part of their initial sexual relationship had relied solely on John masturbating while the detective watched on.
John shook his head immediately "I didn't." then he paused, considering. "I went after Mycroft because I needed someone to shout at, because I'm- I'm fucking pissed, Sherlock. I'm so angry." he shook his head "I know it's not your brother I'm angry at, but he's the only person here, so it just-"
John's kiss was filthy, all tongue and biting and Sherlock could feel him huffing out through his nose, whimpering as he picked up the pace with his hand. "'m so close, love." The shorter man told him, his mouth closing in an 'o'.
That night neither of them slept really well. Sherlock tossed and turned the entire time. He'd wake up every couple of hours and John would wake up with him; he was in his soldier mode, completely alert and ready to spring to action.
John actually slowed his thrusts down after that, wondering if he should just finish himself off instead of overstimulating his lover. But after a few seconds of not moving, Sherlock understood what he was doing.
Sherlock had stopped working on his puzzle entirely and was looking at John with a quiet sort of interest.
He approached the two and nudged the body with his foot. It turned onto its back, and though it didn't move and didn't open its eyes, it opened its mouth. It didn't try to make any sound or form any words, it just stayed there with its mouth hanging open, unmoving.
"Anyway, he's some retired office worker. Nine to five, no wife or kids, record's clean as can be – not even a parking ticket." Lestrade shrugged. "He doesn't live here, either. Owns the property, but he rents a place in London."
But the doctor shook his head, the alcohol loosening him up a bit. "No. No- he- I saw it. I checked his pulse. I saw it."
Uncertain, but unable to refuse, Sherlock got onto his usual position only to feel the excruciating pouring of alcohol down his back and into his arse. He did believe that they were simply trying to clean him with something anti-septic, but it did not lessen the pain he felt when the alcohol came in contact with his open tears.
"I don't think this would be an easy case for anybody. But you can't pretend it doesn't bother you, because I know you and I can see it does." he voice was still level, but a bit softer now "Just promise me you won't shut me out. That's all I'm asking."
"Week! Been in the mood for it all week." Sherlock went back to the laptop and gestured vaguely towards the kitchen "Weren't you going to get- I don't know, milk and stuff? From the shops?"
"The Yard's paying for our cab" Sherlock informed him as a way of accepting the terms, and then proceeded to hang up the phone.
"Sherlock? Sherlock, love, we're here; we're home" he nudged the detective awake gently, afraid to startle him.
The ride to the hospital was incredibly uncomfortable due to the unexpected presence of Sally Donovan.
Sherlock finished his tea, making small talk with John about nothing really. When John finished, he took the plate and their mugs into the kitchen. "Perhaps we could watch a film in my room," he offered when he returned with their refilled wine glasses. "Just a thought."
"That was more fun than your games," Sherlock said, shifting to get comfortable and pulling a blanket up to cover him a little.
"You're the detective," he murmured. He was still holding Sherlock's gaze, licking his lips lightly.
“If it makes you feel better to call it respect, fine,” Mycroft said. “I’m happy for you to take the credit -- it means nothing to me.”
“Well, first of all, we’re a mess,” Sherlock said, pulling back but keeping their legs tangled. He pulled the blanket from the side, kind of covering them a little. “Was that what happened in the dream?” he asked.
"That was really cool, I'm glad I got to see it. I never have before." John sat down and looked out. "I could get used to living some place like this."
John packed up a couple things with the book, grabbed his wallet, and left the flat. He got into a taxi and gave the address.
Harry got out of the shower and changed in John's room before heading down. "Perfect timing! I'll have a mug too," she told Sherlock
Sherlock picked up the box and turned to walk toward the shed. He opened the lock and let them both inside. He set the box on his table and then turned on the little light. He looked around -- his things were still there but his mum had added stuff for the garden. He shifted a few things and found the stools. “There’s no tea or anything,” he said, feeling a bit stupid.
He closed his eyes and drifted to sleep. He dreamt he was in a club. He looked over and saw the alive version of the corpse he’d been staring at this morning. The image woke him from his sleep and he saw that he’s spilled his tea. He got up to clean up and turned on the kettle. He wondered if John’d be home soon; then he heard footsteps on the stairs. He pulled two mugs from the cupboard.
John leaned against the wall and redressed himself. "Too late," he said. "I think I'll be stealing things more often."
“I know you do,” she said. “Just don’t let him take his impatience out on you. He doesn’t always choose his targets wisely.” She stepped up to the door to unlock it and held it open for him. “Thank you for your help, John. I really appreciate it.”
John came in and saw Sherlock scrambling to clean up. "You can keep working. I think I'm just going to go up to bed."
"Why what?" Sherlock said. Then he stopped on the pavement, taking a moment to put things together. "I don't know why you're different, John," he said. "But you are."
"Okay, thanks," John said. He relaxed back as the movie played, dozing lightly but fighting to stay up so Sherlock wouldn't notice.
Sherlock's grandparents fussed over him quite a bit at the restaurant, which was annoying but also nice in a way. They talked a bit about his brother who was somewhere abroad doing something important. He hoped his dad would not bring up the job thing again, afraid somehow his brother would get involved.
Sherlock looked over at John. “Maybe,” he said. “But mainly we wanted to ask about that cottage at Grandmother’s house? The one we stayed in when I was little -- do you think we could use that?”
Sherlock mumbled a few things to himself and then asked to see the other bodies. When he’d finished, he thanked Molly.
Sherlock snapped back awake at the noise, pushing himself up quickly. “I fell back to sleep,” he blurted out guiltily and then shook his head to get it clear. “Fine,” he said. “If you must know, I woke up, cleaned up, slept, woke up and slept again.” He gave John a smile. “Thanks for the tea,” he added as he reached over for the mug.
“Everyone else is acting overly dramatic,” Sherlock mumbled. “I thought I’d try it to see what it’s like.”
Almost two hours later he was leaving the club. He had mingled a bit, struck up some conversations, and got some feedback about the bands. As he walked he texted his friend what he had heard and seen in the crowd, as well as his own opinion of the band. When he sent it all he hailed a cab to get back to his flat. He never knew when his friend would call him up again so he needed to get some rest so he wasn’t too tired tomorrow to do his studying.
"Did you not understand me before? Sherlock is not available for work. You are work, so he will not be around you. I suppose I’ll have to take the phone he's inevitably bought himself and have yet another little talk with him."
“It’s ridiculous,” Sherlock said tersely. “I’d like some information on Strattenburg piece you had stolen.”
“Well, I have literally no idea where the copy of the lease is, so why don’t you try it for a month and by then I’ll have located it and if you are both still alive and willing, we can sign it then?” she proposed.
John nodded, using his hand to stroke Sherlock as he moved into a better position. He leaned down and licked the head, swirling his tongue around it before taking him into his mouth. He moaned softly, moving in a slow rhythm to get used to the fullness.
Sherlock picked up the envelope and read his mother’s message. “So everyone knew except us?” he asked.
"Yeah, it was fine. I won't mind a little break, though I wish it was for a better reason," he said.
“Does that mean the answer is yes, you want us to sleep in the same room?” Sherlock asked. “I’m much better when people answer questions directly.”
John got into a cab and picked up his date before they headed to the restaurant. They talked about the job interview and their work at first as they broke the ice, moving into more personal things like their families and backgrounds as the night went on. She was easy to talk to and John found himself laughing a lot as they talked.
“Yes,” Sherlock said. He shifted down the bed a little. “I think I’ll sleep for a while.” His eyelids felt heavier than they had in a long time.
"God -- fuck!" John fell back against the door, his hand immediately buried in those curls again, watching that lovely mouth move over him.
“I am not,” she said and stepped to the side, pushing John toward the door. “He’s thinking of moving in,” she added before quickly moving down the stairs.
John lifted his glass to signal the bartender for another drink. He took out his phone and flicked away some notifications while he waited.
Sherlock came into the bedroom, carrying the laptop. "I thought we could get into the bed, all right? To watch the film?" he said.
“Whatever,” Sherlock said. He shifted on the bed away from John a little. “I’m going to hate this, aren’t I?”
"It wasn't that," Sherlock said, leaning back against the pillow. "It's just that I wanted to wait for a global pandemic . . . I just thought it'd make it that much more special."
"No, he won't. He's not like you. Besides, he's always believed the best of people. He won't know if we don't tell him."
“I don’t doubt that’s true -- the second part, at least,” Sherlock said. “I don’t get why there has to be such a show about it all.”
“Yes, well, I’m glad we’re clear on the goal here,” Mycroft said. “I suggest you get some sleep and avoid stress until your head is clearer.”
Sherlock looked at John. “Told me what?” he asked. He sat down and turned his attention to Lestrade. “Is this a case or not?”
“Mrs Hudson’s pipes are my pipes,” Sherlock said. “We’re very close.” As they headed toward the door, he added, “Nonetheless, I appreciate a man who offers guarantees.”
Sherlock thought about it for a moment. “All right,” he said. He climbed up and then realised he should probably face away from John. He held his body up with one arm so he could reach down and hold himself.
