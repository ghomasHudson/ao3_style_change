“Oh,” Dean’s face blazes. Looking back, he realizes he probably shouldn’t have dressed Castiel in a faded t-shirt and jeans that he wears himself often enough to be recognized.
, not just because it was a gift to him but because he built nearly half of it, put his own hard work and determination and sometimes pure stubbornness into it and it was
Sam and Dean are hit with the heat of the day as soon as the sliding doors open to the parking lot. Each with a grocery bag, they head towards the Impala.
“Sam, there’s someone I want you to meet,” Dean pushes Sam’s door open and steps in, Castiel following. “This is Castiel. He just moved in across the street.”
His stomach is so tight he might throw up. Dean clutches at his sides, digging his fingertips in as hard as he can with both hands but it doesn’t help.
“Hm,” Bobby grunts, and then is quiet. Dean suddenly feels wary, and he knows Bobby’s got something on his mind. “Everything okay over at the Bunker?”
He’s tried doodling on printer paper, he’s explored the strange corners of YouTube on the desk computer, and he’s even considered making prank calls from the landline to occupy the time. The last two and half hours are the longest he’s ever experienced in his life.
Sticking to the bay side, he keeps as much distance between him and the ocean as he can. He runs, and he doesn’t think, and he never feels himself settle. He makes it all the way down to the inlet and doesn’t rest, just turns to go back north. He runs until he sees the water park up ahead and he still doesn’t quiet. The thought crosses his mind that we could just keep going, run north until he leaves Ocean City and still doesn’t stop.
Cas makes a surprised noise in his throat, but kisses back after a moment, his hand coming up to rest on the side of Dean’s neck. The pool water in Cas’s hair leaves a damp spot on Dean’s favorite pillow, but he doesn’t care. Settled half on top of Cas with one leg slotted between his, all Dean cares about is Cas’s mouth against his and the hand that’s hesitantly found its way up the back of Dean’s t-shirt.
“Cas, I gotta come,” Dean says, pulling on his dick with his head hanging down between his shoulders, forehead pressed into Cas’s hip. “I gotta - ”
“Thank you,” Cas replies pleasantly. “I take very good care of it. I rub it with kelp and jellyfish frequently.”
Dean’s been avoiding his own room for days, and after he’d spent three nights on the couch his dad had finally said something about it. That third morning, when John had stood over Dean in the living room with a cup of coffee and a tired scowl and asked what was wrong with his bed, Dean couldn’t do much more than shrug. He figured then it was time to go back to his room.
Alastair is in the deep end, soaking wet and looking absolutely pissed, yelling things at the three of them as Azazel tries to desperately beckon him out of the pool.
Cas has been all about the fireworks all freaking day, ever since Sam mentioned them the first time that morning. He had gone with Dean to work at Bobby’s earlier, and while Dean got one of Bobby’s junkers up on blocks he talked his ear off about them. He’d said that he and his brothers and sisters would watch them every year, but he never knew what they were for.
He can feel Cas staring at him as he shuffles some papers on the desk. He keeps his eyes down so he doesn’t have to watch when Cas finally turns and disappears down the hall.
- eyes even deeper than the ocean and just as wide, a powerful tail that gleams and shimmers - it doesn’t take the time to peer at him, this time.
“Three sixty-five - oh my god, he’s gonna do it!” Sam actually jumps up and down, absolutely elated.
Getting out of bed with a stretch, Dean collects the empty glasses and heads for the kitchen. He needs to tell Cas that they’re reusable, and he doesn’t have to get a new one every time.
“Oh,” Bobby says, eyebrows lifting. “I thought you had storm windows or somethin’ with your daddy today?”
“No way!” Jo exclaims, along with the others, who all offer their congratulations with grins on their faces.
Dean allows himself to breathe for a minute or two. He regrets this stupid conversation ever starting - he doesn’t talk about this shit for a reason. Not even with Sammy.
For the first time tonight, his dad looks straight at him. Even from where he’s stooped in the passenger seat, clothes mussed and dark eyes heavy with alcohol, his direct gaze still manages to make Dean’s skin prickle.
“I expect you home on weekends,” John says sternly. “Maybe not all of them, but most. This is about school, it’s not about partying or your social life or whatever - ”
the car to fix up if it weren’t for him, and certainly not the tools and parts to do it with. A graduation present is what Bobby had called it when he’d pulled the tarp off the old thing those weeks ago. Dean had stuttered at him like an idiot and at first had refused to take the gift, but Bobby insisted.
Cas studies Dean’s face for a moment, before a smile creeps over his mouth. “There are a few that I consider to be close to me.”
Alastair rolls them towards the pool, and Dean thrashes, but Alastair drags him to the edge and Dean’s suddenly overtaken with terror. Despite his efforts to dislodge Alastair from him, Dean only gets a weak elbow to his sternum as they struggle, his power diminished by his awkward position underneath him, and the next thing he knows he’s pinned to the ground with one of Alastair’s arms pressed heavily across his throat.
“Yes,” Cas nods, looking at him softly. “Not specifically in regards to this subject, as sexuality isn’t something that matters where I come from. But when it comes to judgement, yes, I understand.”
“You’re finished early,” Cas says finally, when the silence stretches just about too long and Dean hasn’t moved.
“Yes. It did look very crowded on the shore, if that makes you feel any better,” Cas says, and Dean throws him a grateful look.
“You’re full of shit, you did not,” Dean argues with a grin as he tries to catch his breath. He leans his hands on his knees and breathes heavily, his heart pounding in his ears. He does get some satisfaction seeing that Cas isn’t breathing much easier.
After a pause, John nods. “Sure,” he says softly. “Yeah, I understand. But I just want you to know, though, she’s not - she’s not the bad guy here, okay?”
- ” Sam’s getting louder as he talks, and Dean tries to cut him off before he’s yelling in excitement.
“I never wanted to live by the ocean. After my dad moved us back here, I wanted nothing to do with it. But now… with you, I just - it feels weird, leaving. It feels weird to be moving away from you - again. And I know this is dumb, I know you can’t hear a word I’m saying, but I couldn’t just go without saying goodbye. Not again.”
“Sure, Bobby, no problem,” Dean says. “Long as your redneck friend doesn’t shoot us.” He gives his most impish grin, just to see Bobby roll his eyes.
“Thank you for the help, Dean,” Cas says. The color has returned to his face for the most part, and he’s breathing easier. “That was quite unpleasant.”
” Castiel steps into the rectangle of light from the door. He’s grinning broadly, and standing on two very human legs, and he’s completely naked.
The very end is just over two miles from the Bunker, and it’s about when he gets there that he feels himself start to settle. He slows to a more reasonable pace, no longer running flat out as if to escape himself. There’s the steady, regular slapping of his feet, and the matching pounding of his heart, and he finds it comforting. He pulls in lungful after lungful of air, but his breaths feel strong and reliable for the first time in three days.
Dean listens to the two of them and can’t help but smile. He likes hearing them talk back and forth like this. He likes that Cas can make Sam smile, broadly and self-assured.
Obviously, he’s grateful he didn’t find anyone (or anything) outside, but Dean can’t help but feel unsettled. He drags the heel of his hand roughly across his ribs, but his stomach just goes on twisting. Dean chews his lip until he tastes blood.
He’s just emptying the net of seaweed into a pile on the deck, his back partially turned to the deep end, when he hears a soft splash from behind him. Dean whirls around, his heart all of a sudden hammering in his chest, and he scans the surface of the pool with wide eyes.
Dean pauses. He casts a scrutinizing look across the table at his little brother, but Sam is preoccupied with his desert and doesn’t meet his eye.
And Dean hasn’t made a sound in almost four weeks now, but when he dad makes to stand, to set Dean on his feet, he’s so scared he lets out a desperate whine.
They bicker back and forth, and Dean pretends to laugh along, but he feels heavy. When Ash waves Jo off and suggests they go to the arcade, Dean tries to think of a quick excuse to get out of it but they’re all standing up from the table before he can. He gets up slowly.
There’s a flutter in Dean’s stomach, but it’s not a bad one. It doesn’t feel like uneasiness, for once. As Cas brushes his hair back from his forehead, Dean fights to hold back a smile. “Tomorrow.”
The sun is starting to set, the light sharpening and coming in at an angle, making everything look a bit orange. As they get higher and higher, the town comes into view below them, the inlet bordered by the bay and the ocean on three sides. Dean usually feels a little nervous this high off the ground, but Sam and Cas offer a pretty decent distraction.
Cas picks up the pace, Dean matching it with the speed of his fist on his dick, and it isn’t long before Cas has two fingers inside him and Dean is gasping.
“Okay,” Dean says slowly, taking the empty cup and filling it again. “Well, take this with you in case you get thirsty again overnight.”
“I never wanted to hurt you!” Cas finally shouts, and Dean freezes. They stare at one another, both breathing hard. “This - it was never my intention. All this time, that's what I’ve been trying to avoid - ”
“ - you come with?” the girl is asking, but she doesn’t wait for a response. “I don’t recognize you, are you from PG county? That’s where most of us are from, we’re all down here for - ”
Flicking off Sam’s light, Dean pulls the door most of the way shut before heading back down the hall. He leaves the apartment through the door to the lobby.
“Nothing. I was just wondering why you’ve been so weird about Cas getting a job, that’s all,” he says, looking right at Dean.
There are a handful of the stingrays in the tank, which Dean gets a good look at for the first time. They glide along, some skimming along the bottom and others close to the surface, where people are reaching out to touch them. They’re small, maybe the size of a large pancake, and they don’t seem to mind at all as people skate their fingers over their backs as they swim by.
Dean nods with a smile, pleased that Cas remembered. After working on it twice last week, Dean finally announced that he thinks the Roadrunner is ready to drive off the property. He promised Cas that they would take it out after he finished at work.
“That’s for sure gonna wash off immediately,” Dean mutters to himself with a shake of his head, and Cas chuckles beside him.
Finally, his chest loosens, and though Dean still pulls in air a little too fast, his lungs open and slowly seem to work again. Dean holds onto Cas’s forearms and he quiets, the tension slowly easing away with the light from Cas’s hands.
Dean slips out of the automatic doors before wondering about whether or not Ellen will think it’s weird he didn’t go right back to the apartment, but he’s too distracted to care. Once outside, he has to stop and lean against the building for a minute. He concentrates on the dimly lightening sky as he draws air into his lungs. When he feels like he’s got himself more under control, he heads for room one.
to?” Dean turns his head to look at him while he scrubs. “Would it be nice, to get to swim? You haven’t been able to in so long.”
It’s always a rather melancholy time of year, the sun drawing nearer to the equator as the equinox becomes closer ahead than the solstice is behind. The angle of the sun changing and it’s something that can be felt viscerally, that gradual moving away. To be marked with a day of equality before the light is given to the south for its turn.
.” Dean’s not complaining. It’ll be nice to have a few days off from running around whenever some renter needs something.
“Cas started it,” Sam lowers his voice but still seems to have a hard time containing his giggles, splashing at Cas with both hands.
Cas is waiting on the curb outside the pet store, and he looks grumpy. Dean’s eyebrows quirk at the irritable frown on Cas’s face as he pulls the Impala up alongside him, shoving the whole thing to the back of his mind.
Cas gazes down at him and Dean can feel his smile fading from his face as he all but melts into the mattress, heat pooling again low in his belly. Dean tries not to squirm and he knows that Cas notices because he sees his eyes darken and he’s definitely just as turned on as Dean is.
“It’s not his fault,” Dean says, suddenly feeling the need to defend his father. “After my mom, he… he wasn’t really the same. He dragged us around the country ‘cuz he didn’t feel safe in one place, and he didn’t know what else to do.”
Every few minutes Sam pipes up with another question, another comment about Dean going to school. It’s often enough that Dean starts to wonder why Sam gave him a book, since he’s not giving him any chance to read it.
And he leans in again, sliding a hand around the back of Cas’s neck to pull him in for another kiss. He catches Cas’s laugh in his mouth as their lips meet, and feels Cas’s hand come to rest on the side of his jaw.
Dean rolls his eyes. Sam takes a KitKat bar from the shelf with a hopeful expression, but Dean shakes his head. “No. Put it back.”
Castiel nearly walks into someone because he turns his head to stare at a kid walking past them with cotton candy.
When Castiel says he’s feeling thirsty, Dean points out the water fountain and starts a one-person shooting game while he waits for him to come back. He does well, and Castiel returns to watch him excel onto level 8, where he finally loses but collects sixty-five tickets.
Because he can’t help it, Dean pulls her to him. She squeezes him tight, arms around his middle, and they hug in the middle of the arcade with yelling kids ducking around them and Speed of Light at Dean’s back. He kisses the top of her head before pulling away.
John’s bedroom door is open when Dean goes by, and it makes him pause. Cautiously, he peers in. His dad’s bed is empty.
Sitting up a bit straighter, John clears his throat roughly. “One more thing, though,” he says, and he leans to fish into his pocket. “I told Bobby he’s not driving you out there.”
Dean cracks his eyes open blearily, not quite sure what’s woken him. He rolls over, and squints at a shirt-less, messy-haired shadow kneeling beside him.
The peak of low tide having just passed, the shoreline is steadily rising again. It inches unhurriedly up the sand one break of the waves at a time. Pushing more than it’s pulling for the next several hours, and Dean has always thought the ocean had seemed less intimidating this time of day. Reaching towards, but not threatening to drag back out.
“Uh… sure…” Sam looks from Castiel to Bones again, who even to Dean looks a lot happier. He’s no longer hiding, and is swimming around in his plant.
All of Dean’s friends know that he doesn’t go in the water, so they don’t nag him to join them when they go swimming. Luckily, they also don’t question it when Cas stays back, too, to “keep him company”.
The bus is full of people, and the five of them barely fit. It’s loud, too, most people drunk and jostling one another.
Something catches Cas’s eye over Dean’s shoulder, and Dean turns to see a brightly lit game that flashes and shimmers. They walk over to it, Cas staring up at it in stoned wonder.
“Let me help,” he says, and he picks up the spoon to start dishing out the stir fry as Dean reaches in the cabinet for a fourth bowl.
Dean is wracking his brain for something to say to that when he’s saved by Rufus letting out a low whistle, looking down at the water.
Opening his mouth, Dean invites him in, and their tongues slide together. Dean doesn’t miss the warmth that emits from Cas’s hand, splayed wide across his ribs, as he heals the few bruises that were left.
When Dean gets back outside, Cas is vomiting again into the trash can. Dean can see his back muscles bunching violently through his threadbare t-shirt as he heaves, and he grimaces in sympathy.
Dean’s gaze swivels from John to Cas and back, his heart hammering in his chest. He has no reason to be worried, right? His dad and his friend are just chatting amicably. His dad, who tends to be a judgemental prick at times, and his friend, who happens to be a merman at times - and also may or may not spend the night in Dean’s bed more often than he doesn’t.
He’s never said the words out loud before. Saying them is like an admission, like in acknowledging it he’ll make it true. He kind of feels sick, all of a sudden.
Cas huffs his breath out quietly and looks away, and Dean lets himself grin. Reaching out, he hooks a finger through one of the belt loops at the front of Cas’s jeans. He tugs him close.
At that, Cas’s expression softens. He shoulders sag just slightly as a bit of tension leaves him, and his mouth turns up in one corner. He leans into Dean.
“Cas? Everything okay?” Dean’s guts are in knots and his eyebrows pull down in concern. He reaches for Cas’s elbow.
Dean turns it over in his hands, trying to ignore the aching in his stomach. He doesn’t know where it’s been all this time. Maybe it’d fallen behind his dresser, or into one of his drawers. Either way, he knows who must have found it and who put it on his pillow. Before he left.
Behind Cas, the tub gets about full and Dean sighs. Stretching over him, Dean shunts the water off before returning his arm around Cas’s shoulders.
“I guess being in the pool isn’t really the same, huh?” Dean says with a wry smile. Cas tips his head in an approximation of a shrug. “You can’t just go out there for a dip if you want to?”
He thanks her and says goodbye before pushing distractedly out of the half-door and heading back towards the apartment.
“Alright, Sammy, cool it,” Dean says. “Leave the poor guy alone. Why don’t you tell us about Assateague today with Ellen and Jo?”
“He’s right, though,” Dean murmurs when Cas gets his elbows hooked over the ledge between his legs and has his face angled up close to Dean’s. “I was planning on making out with you.”
It’s about two o’clock when Dean picks Cas up from work. He climbs into the car with a grin and leans over to give Dean a peck on the cheek.
Cas leans over to put the washcloth on the floor and get Dean’s sweats, and Dean openly watches the muscles of his back as he does it. He can’t get the image out of his head of Cas’s face as he came, his eyebrows knitted together and mouth open and cock heavy on Dean’s tongue.
Dean stands in front of the bed and surveys Sam sleeping quietly for a long moment. For some reason, standing there, he thinks of sharing a cushion-less loveseat, his own legs the only pair too long for it. It wasn’t too uncomfortable, but he remembers a chunk missing from the arm that at the time he’d prayed wasn’t from rats. He shoves the unexpected memory away.
Dean feels hyper aware of Cas’s proximity beside him as they eat their pizza. Are they sitting too close? Their thighs aren’t touching, but Dean thinks he can feel the heat of Cas’s leg against his. Is that too close?
Dean doesn’t head for the sidewalk of Coastal Highway when he leaves the apartment. With bare feet, he rounds the pool deck fence’s perimeter until he hits the wood of the narrow path that leads to the beach.
Castiel nods and they sit, side by side in the sand. Dean draws patterns in it with a stick, every once in a while glancing at Cas as he drinks from his straw.
“We were off playing a game, not far from shore, when we saw it. We heard it, first, heard yelling and such - ”
Dean rolls his eyes at his brother’s sass and watches the kid lope back down the beach to the shoreline.
With his hands settled in the shallow curve of Cas’s waist, where they’ve rucked his shirt up to his ribs, Dean tips his head back when Cas kisses over his throat. He sighs, the light from the TV glowing behind his eyelids and a quiet heat pooled steady and low in his belly. It spikes when Cas’s fingers tangle deep in his hair, blunt nails scraping his scalp. Cas tips Dean’s head back further with his grip in his hair, giving himself better access to his throat, and Dean goes more than willingly, almost melting under his touch.
Dean’s abruptly reminded of a different night, months ago, when unease and the vague sense of being watched and the distant sound of a splash had him standing at the slider with a baseball bat clutched in his hand.
“Are you alright?” Cas sits up, his tail curling, water splashing softly over the side of the tub and onto the tile.
“Yes,” Dean says with a roll of his eyes. “And you’re going first, big mouth.” Dean drops the duffel in the grass. “No, you dipshit. Check it out.”
“And you definitely wouldn’t let me do this,” Cas pulls back just long enough to murmur, and he shifts onto his elbow and slides a leg over Dean so that he’s straddling his hips. Dean nips at his lower lip playfully, hands sliding up the back of Cas’s shirt.
“Bowlegs,” Cas repeats, and he looks intrigued, his eyebrows creasing just a little in the middle. “I like them.”
After hesitating just one more moment, Sam opens the passenger door with a click. “I’ll see you at three, okay, De’?”
“Thanks, Benny,” Dean nods at him as he walks away. When he turns back to Castiel, he finds him staring. “What?”
It’s like a gnawing sensation in the back of his brain, and he’s not awake enough to fight it. He doesn’t know how long he dozes like that, with his stomach in knots and his sleepy thoughts racing. He’s vaguely aware of a warm presence in bed with him, and his insides twist.
Dean doesn’t know what to say to that, so he just shakes his head. They look at one another, and they breathe.
They wander through the arcade slowly afterwards, in a lazy search for Ash and Jo. Cas bites off a piece of Twizzler, and gasps.
“You taste like popsicle,” Dean breaks the kiss long enough to say, his fingers squeezing Cas’s thighs without his permission.
Disinterestedly, Dean lets his eyes flit over the people around them. They look like the kind who may own houses in this area - staying down at the beach for the summer to drink and party and spend their parents’ money. Lip curling, Dean wonders what Jo’s doing talking to these people.
A dreamcatcher. It’s small, the hoop about the size of his palm, and it’s intricately assembled, tiny seashells woven in. He tries to remember what Missouri had said about the gift those months ago, wonders if she made it herself. The feathers are soft between his fingers. He’d never gone back to thank her for it, but now it feels too late.
In the dark, with the light from the TV behind him, Cas is mostly in shadow but Dean can just make out the curve of his smile.
“Dean, Dean, it’s okay,” Bobby’s saying, and though he’s right behind Dean’s ear his voice sounds far away and that’s when Dean realizes he’s sobbing.
He’s already got a steady thrumming in the tips of his fingers, and his eyelids feel heavy. It’s just starting to get harder to stay focused on what they’re saying around him, and he doesn’t want to get too high. The three others finish off the second joint just as the ride starts coming to a stop, the people in the car a few ahead of them clambering off onto the boardwalk.
“Would you like me to stay in room one?” Cas whispers, and Dean shakes his head through the dark, pulling off his wet jeans and throwing them aside.
Gritting his teeth, Dean brushes past him towards the kitchen. “I thought I told you to get ready for bed.”
There are a handful of horses around the side of the low dune, nosing through the sand for the sparse shoots of grass. One looks rather young, sticking close to the side of what must be its mother. They don’t raise their heads at the growing collection of people who have wandered over to peer at them.
They’d driven about an hour further north after the Orioles game, to the very top of the bay where they’d decided to stay for the night. Havre de Grace is a small port town surrounded by water, making it a perfect place for Cas to stay the night, with a cheap motel nearby for Dean and Sam.
“Wait, you mean they didn’t… you didn’t get in?” Sam sounds disbelieving, and while Dean’s flattered his kid brother still has so much faith in him, it makes him ache deep inside.
With shuffling steps, Dean backs Cas up until the backs of his knees bump the tub and he’s forced to sit, right on the edge. Standing between his open legs, Dean lets his hands come to rest on either side of Cas’s neck, sucking his bottom lip into his mouth and gently tugging it with his teeth. In response, Cas’s fingers curve around the backs of Dean’s thighs, just beneath his ass, and squeeze softly.
Cas’s feet step into his line of sight while he’s leaning over filling a drink. Straightening, Dean offers him the cup.
“Sam,” Dean hisses as some kid scampers by, followed by his parents. “Keep your voice down, would you?”
The change in the stingray’s demeanor is immediate. As soon as Cas skims his fingers over it, it hesitates. Rather than swim on by like it did with the other people, the stingray pauses, nudging itself up into Cas’s palm like a dog asking to be pet.
“Yeah,” comes Sam’s reply, muffled by the food in his mouth. “We’re going kayaking up at Miller Creek.”
They kiss once more, shortly, before Dean finally straightens up. He’s still biting back a smile as he walks back to the apartment.
When Dean lowers his arm and turns back, his lips part in astonishment at the sight. Cas leans back against the porcelain with his eyes closed, his chest still rising and falling a little rapidly, and his tail looking absolutely enormous in the tub. It doesn’t really fit, the last couple feet or so of fin sticking out of the end.
It’s been years since Bobby’s done this for him, since he’s seen Dean get this bad, and Dean suddenly feels like he’s thirteen again - having a nervous meltdown because his dad had been gone two days too long (the first time he’d left them since Iowa) and the groceries were low and Dean hadn’t yet figured out how to ask for help.
“Don’t you have other tables to torment?” He retorts, not even trying to keep the disdain out of his voice.
As Dean rolls his hips down, focused on the feeling of Cas filling him up, Cas gets his hand slicked up again and fits it around Dean’s neglected cock. Though it had softened a bit with the lack of attention it’s quick to refill. Having Cas inside him and stroking him at once is more than he imagined, and he moves his hands to Cas’s hair. Each time Cas swipes under the head it feels that much more intense paired with the slick slide of him, and it sparks something low in Dean’s belly that’s quick to spread, until it’s at the tips of his fingers and he’s trembling. Cas’s hips twitch in little thrusts, meeting Dean every time he comes down. Breath shuddering, Dean leans in to press their mouths together as they move.
A long moment passes and Dean holds his breath, overcome with the things he can’t say and Cas quiet with the things he won’t. It aches profoundly, deep inside him, and Dean can’t help but dig his fingers into his side, past caring that Cas is watching.
They try a few other games, and find that Castiel, while not good at games that require any use of a toggle or a gun, has quite good reflexes. He finds the whack-a-mole absolutely hilarious, and Dean thinks he’d be rather good at it if he’d concentrate more, rather than stop and laugh every time he hits one.
Bobby hands it over, and Dean looks at the front. It’s addressed to Mr. Dean Winchester, but it’s got Bobby’s address underneath, which can only mean one thing. Sure enough, the return address is for University of Maryland, College Park. Dean swallows.
You got in!” The kid sounds thrilled, and Dean can see his grin out of the corner of his eye and he can’t look directly at it.
Grinning, Sam bends down and starts setting up the canisters in a row. He directs Cas and Jo, telling them where he wants everything, before shooing them back where Dean is so he can light them up.
They settle at a picnic table, Dean with his cup and Sam with his cone, and Dean takes note that it’s the first time in a while it’s not sweltering hot and oppressively humid. He takes his time with his ice cream.
Turning the dreamcatcher over in gentle hands, Dean’s eyes trail past it and are caught on the envelope still resting on his pillow. It looks like it was once terribly crumpled, but had been carefully flattened until only faintly wrinkled. While it’s made out to Mr. Dean Winchester, the address below his name is Bobby’s. Dean doesn’t need to look at the return address to know who it was from, and when. He only hesitates a moment before picking it up, fingers careful. It’s unopened, still.
For a long moment, Dean just gawks at him. Mouth parted and eyes wide, his incredulous stare flicks from the keys to his dad’s face, where John looks at him expectantly.
He doesn’t stop there, heading for the screen door at the front of the house and shouldering through, letting it smack against the jamb behind him.
in front of everyone. As much as Dean feels like he should be nervous about that, it really doesn’t seem like anything’s changed. His friends are acting just the same as they always do. Dean glances around at them all, as they joke and laugh with Cas, and he feels a rush of gratitude towards them.
“Oh,” Dean says in mild surprise. He swallows. “Sure, okay. I can - I can set something up for you, I guess.”
With Cas’s help, Dean shoves his pants down off his hips, freeing his now fully hard cock in the process. Cas sits back on his heels to untangle them from around Dean’s ankles and tosses the sweatpants to the floor along with their shirts.
“Oh. It’s nothing.” Even Dean admits that sounded terribly not reassuring, and Cas just looks at him. Dean swallows. “I, um… I get stomach aches, is all.”
The ferris wheel makes its slow way around as people load onto the cars, and Andy, Ash and Jo make idle conversation as Andy rolls a couple of joints. Dean listens along, but his eyes wander past Jo, over the town below them.
He lets himself imagine it. Asking Cas if he wanted to stay here, to stay with him. They could make it work. His only true worry is John, but it’s been two months already, and it’s been okay this far. He lets himself imagine it, even though he knows he shouldn’t. He swallows past the sticking in his throat.
Beneath his dad’s dark scrutiny, Dean is stock still in the doorway. John stands to his full height, and with a booted heel he kicks the refrigerator door shut behind him. He regards Dean with a foreboding sort of calm, the only inclination of what’s in store being the paleness of his knuckles where he has a dangerously tight grip on the neck of a beer. Briefly, Dean thinks he sees his dad’s eyes flicker over the right side of his face, but if there’s any recognition of the bruise across Dean’s cheekbone, John’s expression doesn’t show it.
“Well, thank you for the towels, my child.” Missouri says, and she smiles as though she didn’t just totally weird him out.
Cas’s voice is frantic and sounds far away - Dean hears Jo cursing, and what might be Andy or Ash, both of whom are completely useless in a fight - and Alastair’s long fingers tangle in the hair at the back of Dean’s head and he
The motel has that end-of-summer feel to it. Check-outs of seasonal guests are more frequent than check-ins, just a few non-regular rooms occupied by people trying to get their last-minute vacations in before school starts up again.
“It was really cool,” he says with a full mouth. He swallows, winces at the brain freeze and takes a moment to recover. “They do it every year to monitor the easterm oysters. We were s’posed to compare what we found with the kids from last year.”
They finish up eating and Dean collects their plates. He debates washing them now, but ends up just rinsing them and leaving them in the sink. He can deal with them tomorrow.
“How ‘bout you, Dean-o? I know College Park has all that engineering stuff you’re into, you goin’ there?”
But Bobby raises a hand, stopping him. “No need for that.” Reaching out, he scoops up Dean’s nearly empty bowl. He stands, and after hesitating a moment, he meets Dean’s eye.
“Of course,” Cas says, and Dean’s eyes snap back to him, and the sincerity in Cas’s gaze makes his insides twist faintly. “If that’s what you want.”
The realization has him pulling back with a sharp inhale, his face flushing. He stares down at Cas, who gazes up at him from where he lies flat on his back and gasping with his pupils blown wide. It’s looking at how dark Cas’s eyes appear, the blue just a narrow band around the black, that makes Dean suddenly realize how overcast it seems to have gotten.
“Apparently, their bellies are just super bloated because they eat so much grass that has saltwater on it - ” Sam continues, pulling off his shirt when Dean gestures at him. He turns around and lifts his arms. “ - and then they have to drink extra water because the salt dehydrates them.”
. Schools of them swim by, colorful and glimmering, darting through the corals and around each other.
He takes his time making a sandwich, and he wraps it up in a napkin, and he doesn’t think about Cas. When he’s sure little Dean isn’t going to do anything to humiliate him, he heads for the lobby.
Something clatters at the back of the shed, and Dean nearly jumps out of his skin when someone steps out of the shadows.
With the essentials for the week thrown carelessly into the cart, he meanders back towards the front. He doesn’t have enough money to get everything they need, and is probably gonna have to come back next week.
. I had it under control,” Dean says defensively, but Cas just shakes his head and turns his face away, his jaw clenched.
For a few breaths longer Dean stands, feet bare on the carpet and thoughts and emotions swimming. Cas swallows, a crease between his eyebrows. Finally, Dean nods.
It’s John’s turn to look away. He faces the window, the moonlight highlighting the sharp edge of his nose, the way his jaw flexes tensely. It’s a long moment before he speaks and when he does his voice has hardened, but is not ungentle.
“Yeah, he did,” Dean says before Castiel can reply, and he plops down on Sam’s bed. “What are you working on? You can’t possibly have homework the night before your last day.”
For the better part of the next hour they drive with the water somewhere through the trees to their left - every once in a while a spidery finger of an estuary makes its way to the road and they’ll catch glimpses of it, but no more than that.
Cas makes a noise in his throat as Dean pulls away to tip his forehead down against his. Slowly, he opens his eyes and finds Cas already looking at him, eyelashes fluttering.
Dean thought Sam would be pissed, to be honest, when he found out Cas was gone. He thought that Sam would bitch at him for driving Cas away, for not getting him to stay. Instead, Sam reacted much like Jo did - with a sympathetic twist of his mouth and a soft look, and Dean found that was infinitely worse. He hasn’t been able to look straight at the kid since, because he can’t stand to see the pity in his eyes.
Propped up over him, Dean feels Cas’s other hand slide to the small of his back, under his t-shirt. He sucks Cas’s lower lip into his mouth. In response, Cas tightens his fingers on Dean’s back, and Dean inhales sharply at the dull bite of his fingernails. The sensation causes a warm tingling low in his belly, and Dean deepens the kiss.
A fresh swell of grief climbs his throat as his memories from the morning flood in. He flexes his fingers, hands still tender and freshly scabbed over. He can still feel the slamming of the crowbar through his arms. As much as he tries not to, he wonders how bad the Roadrunner looks.
Cas leans into the open door and leaves a kiss in Dean’s hair, on the top of his head. Ridiculously, it makes Dean blush.
Dean swallows. Relief washes through him, and he’s so grateful to Bobby he can’t even find words and he just nods. Bobby turns back to the stove.
“What’s on his nose?” He asks around a mouthful of egg sandwich that Dean showed him how to assemble.
Dean doesn’t know how long he lies there for, half-asleep and worrying. He’s vaguely aware of his aching stomach and tense muscles, but eventually his thoughts get loud enough to wake him.
“My dad’s other kid,” Dean repeats, and while his voice is rough from the crying followed by several hours of disuse, it’s steady. “Did you know about him?”
Bobby clucks his tongue in annoyance at that as Dean cracks open the can. It fizzes, and he puts his mouth over the opening so it doesn’t drip. He doesn’t miss how Cas follows his lead in his peripheral vision.
“Your friends are very funny,” Cas says when they settle in their seats. His eyes are still red and he looks at Dean from under heavy eyelids.
Dean only half-listens as he and Sam continue to lightly bicker back and forth about the implausibility of Spongebob. He’d like for Cas to meet his friends, but he’s not sure how the guy would feel about getting stoned with them.
They play Marco-Polo, which Sam also insists that Cas cheats at whether he’s the one searching or the one swimming away. Though he couldn’t say exactly how Cas was doing it, Sam claims he must have some sort of echolocation or something. Cas just shrugs at that, grinning.
Outside, Dean’s careful to keep close to the building so he doesn’t set off the motion light. He inches to the breaker on the side of the motel, and swings open the door. After carefully selecting the lever he wants, he flips the switch, shutting off power to the whole pool deck.
“No, sir,” Dean says to the floor a foot from his dad’s feet. “Just thought you might wanna go to bed.”
“Well, nice job, Cas. Seriously, good fucking work with that.” Passing a hand over his mouth roughly, Dean wants to dig his fingers into his ribs hard enough to crack them but he doesn’t. “And then - after all that, you have the nerve to tell
“That’s the plan,” Dean says with a nod, slapping a hand on the roof. “We’ll call you if we get stranded out there.”
Coughing violently, he’s resisting the urge to retch when a pair of bare feet come into view on the concrete before him and then Cas’s hands are on him - on his shoulders, on either side of his head, tipping up his face to get a look at him.
“Yeah,” Jo nods her head towards the door behind them which leads to the back room. “She’s workin’ on bills or something. You get the pool done?”
Dean huffs his breath out through his nose, wanting nothing more than to sink through the sidewalk and avoid this conversation.
“Where’d you go, Cas,” Dean mutters to himself, straining to see through the water in the dark. He sees movement underneath him, and leans in close for a better look.
“You’re lookin’ at it,” she says with a wry smile, and Dean thinks she might be trying to avoid making eye contact with him, too. She looks to Cas, instead. “Hey. You new around here?”
“Just one of our regulars. She’s here almost all year round. Gives palm readings and tells fortunes and stuff - kinda creepy, if you ask me. But she’s real nice.”
“And when did you ever ask me about this?” Dean demands. “Even once, when did you ever consider what I might’ve wanted - ”
Cas stiffens at that, his bare shoulders pulling tight. Uncomprehending, Dean breaks eye contact with Naomi to glance at him.
Cas stands and follows him obediently as Dean stalks to his room. Grabbing the first t-shirt from his drawer, Dean all but shoves it at him and hardly gives him enough time to tug it over his head before heading towards the hall. He stops abruptly in the doorway, however, and Cas nearly walks into him. Without letting himself hesitate, Dean fishes the balled up envelope out of his pocket and tosses it in the trash, and then walks out without a backward glance.
In the dark hallway, Dean catches his breath. He can feel something heavy on the verge of catching up with him, and he swallows hard past a tightness in his throat. His feet move on their own towards Sam’s room, passing by his own doorway and vastly empty bed without looking.
Since Victor graduated a year ago, he’s had three girlfriends and Jo has adamantly expressed her dislike for each and every one of them. She’s always been territorial about her friends, though.
Jody walks him to the door, and when she catches his arm at the last moment and tells him to call her if he needs anything, he stretches his mouth into a flat smile.
“He can eat what he wants. You need to eat your green beans.” Dean raises his eyebrows challengingly, and the look must have just enough John Winchester in it, because while Sam rolls his eyes he stabs a few vegetables and shoves them in his mouth.
Cas’s quiet voice comes from close to his right. Not knowing what he’s talking about, Dean turns  and finds Cas’s eyes cast downward, to where Dean is jabbing a thumb between his ribs. He drops his hand.
Dean pulls out of the Bunker and points them south. He’s careful to watch his speed on Coastal Highway, but when he gets off the exit for Route 50, going as if headed for Bobby’s, he opens her up. There’s just the radio, the salty breeze, and the sun sinking below the horizon ahead of them. It’s only a few minutes before Dean comes up on the place, and he slows to pull off to the right. He’s been scoping this place out since last year.
Like neritic waters, it glimmers before him. On closer inspection the color has remarkable depth, the swirls created by Dean jostling it reminiscent of the current. He stares down into it. It’s just what he imagined when he ordered it - like hundreds of shades of scales, like every layer of the ocean, the color of his dreams for nearly as long as he can remember - impossibly blue and strikingly similar to a pair of eyes that he knows all too well.
His eyebrows go up in spite of himself. The house they approach is enormous, with a manicured lawn to match. Instead of heading for the front door, though, Jo leads them around back.
With Cas surveying him closely, Dean keeps his own gaze on Cas’s hand, where it fiddles with the hem of Dean’s shirt.
“Woah,” Dean says softly, and he looks up with wide eyes and catches Castiel’s gaze. He swallows, a little breathless. The color of Castiel’s eyes matches his tail. They’re deep, and perplexing, and remind Dean of the smell of sea breeze and something else that makes the hair on his arms prickle. The ocean. “That was…. Thanks.”
“What were you looking at?” Dean glances around them again but still sees nothing out of the ordinary.
They walk for a while, Dean and Cas letting Sam see everything he wants to, content to follow a few paces behind him. The weather is particularly nice, not nearly as hot as it had been in the previous weeks, and Dean lets his hand bump Cas’s between them as they stroll. Their fingers tangle just briefly a few times, casually. Sam hardly pays them any mind, yammering on about the war of 1812 and “The Star-Spangled Banner,” without ever really looking back to make sure they’re listening to him.
Maybe he does want to get high. There’s always the chance smoking will make him more uneasy, but there’s also the possibility it’ll chill him out, which would be a relief. He was planning on going for a run, but maybe he’ll do both. Maybe then he’ll sleep better.
Sam’s disappointment doesn’t last too long. He’s easily distracted. Sometimes. “It was fun. One of the ponies walked all over our stuff, and the lifeguards wouldn’t let us chase it away so we just had to let it.”
It’s not until he hits the parking lot that he slows. He looks up from his feet as he approaches the apartment, and it’s when he finds Cas standing outside that he finally pulls up. He eases to a walk, and when he comes to a stop he does so a few meters from Cas. They regard one another in the dim parking lot, one of the street lamps burnt out and the moon, as near to full as it is, not doing much to help. Cas is fully dressed.
Dean works at Bobby’s a couple days, breaking down a few junkers for parts to sell and running errands for him. Cas always rides shotgun in one of Bobby’s trucks that they use to take some scraps to the dump, and Frazier usually sits between them on the bench.
, Cas,” Dean says, crouching down to load the DVD. It takes his high brain a second to figure out the buttons, but he successfully gets it started. “You don’t know comedy until you’ve seen his movies.”
He crawls up Dean’s body, and when their faces are level they peer at each other for a long moment. Slowly, Dean slides a hand around the back of Cas’s neck and pulls him down into a kiss. Cas kisses him back tenderly.
The beach is different here. The dunes are broader and have a lot more foliage on them, spanning for miles all the way down the shore. There are no buildings lining the water, no motels or shops or condos. It’s quieter, without as many people, and the crashing waves sound almost louder in their absence.
“Why don’t you let me help you?” Cas whispers, and Dean can’t answer. “I don’t like to see you hurting.”
“For you,” he says unnecessarily, before stepping away and stalking back for the kitchen, where Dean now registers the sound of the coffeemaker percolating.
But John’s shaking his head, arms crossed over his knees and he raises one hand as if to wave Dean’s words away.
“Stop talking,” Dean says, and he leans in and kisses Cas to shut him up. Cas laughs against his mouth but kisses back, their lips warm and unhurried against one another. There's the faint smell of artificial peaches.
“Oh, I was looking through some of your things,” Castiel says simply. He holds up a sock. "What are these?"
“Sure, kid,” Rufus says as he climbs back up the ladder. “Your dad wants the fence repainted, since the new boards don’t really match. Grab a brush, Dean-o.”
“Bobby - wow - I don’t know, I - ” Dean had run his hand over its hood, gaping at it. It was rusted to shit and even missing a damn door, and he had no idea the last time the thing was roadworthy, but the idea of putting it back together again started a feverish buzz in him. He swallowed. “My dad, he - he won’t let me take this, Bobby, you know how he is about - you know, I don’t know - ”
Victor laughs, finishing the last of the first joint and flicking the burnt out stub over the side. He turns to Dean, who abruptly wishes he could jump out after it, knowing what’s coming.
Dean glances at Cas, who’s watching him curiously. He shifts from one foot to the other. “Yeah, he did.”
Slipping inside and shutting the door quietly behind himself, Dean hesitates in the hallway. It’s dark and still, the only sound of Sam’s fish tank gurgling if he listens closely. He stands for a moment, listening to himself breathe.
Thrilled to be the one paying, Cas cashes in a couple of bills for quarters at the arcade and passes them around. They play until their coins run out.
Dean regards him for a moment, but then decides to let the change of subject slide. “Almost all my life, I guess. I was born here. Well, not
Concentrating on that, Dean works on convincing himself that he doesn’t have anything to worry about at the moment. Sam is taken care of, he still has enough food in the fridge, and they’re all in bed, warm and safe.
Swiping the key off the nightstand silently, Dean gives Sam one more glance before slipping out the door. He locks it behind him carefully before twisting the knob and giving the door a shove to test it. Satisfied, he slips the key in the pocket of his sweatpants.
“And why,” John continues, and his voice is still low and carefully controlled, “Bobby fucking Singer is picking your brother up from camp?”
“They are not,” Cas scoffs. “As a matter of fact, I think you should add spots to it, too, for visual interest - ”
“Uh,” Dean glances around. He lifts an arm to rub his hand over the back of his neck but it only gets halfway before he stops himself. His arm falls back to his side awkwardly. “I don’t really have any quarters.”
They gaze at each other as they both come down. Cas looks impossibly soft, slouched boneless in the bench seat with a gentle set to his brow. Dean reaches up and smooths his hair back from his damp forehead, leans forward and presses a kiss to his temple. He feels Cas’s hands slide up his sides and there’s a reverence in the touch. They breath together.
“What is this?” Cas asks when he gets to the amulet resting over Dean’s sternum, fiddling with it gently.
His breaths come even. He doesn’t look at himself in the mirror, but his breaths come even and his hands don’t shake and his stomach isn’t in knots. The shower runs at his back and there’s dirt at the inside of his left wrist and in the lines of his palms -
“I’m proud of you, Dean,” Sam says, and his voice is muffled in the front of Dean’s t-shirt but Dean hears him loud and clear and he swallows hard, throat feeling thick. He gives Sam a squeeze, bends to press his cheek into the top of his shaggy head.
“What?” Sam says distractedly, tearing his eyes from his fish tank to look up at Dean. “Oh, yeah. I made a sandwich, I’m good.”
“No. Come in here.” Dean rolls towards the wall, making room in his bed. Cas hesitates, but then starts to clamber under the blankets.
Dean blows his breath out in a burst. “I don’t know. I mean, sometimes he says where he’s going. But I don’t know, if he doesn’t, I don’t ask.”
“Wait,” he says petulantly, and bends to press his lips to Cas’s. Cas chuckles, but Dean shuts him up when he swipes his tongue against his lower lip, and Cas opens his mouth and lets him in.
Dean considers that for a moment before humming in reply, not totally reassured. He turns back to the sink.
“As long as it’s the Crystal Skull,” Jo continues, encouraged, “so I can look at Shia LaBeouf, and you can look at Harrison Ford, and Sam can tell us the ending just like he does every other time.”
Dean watches Cas’s face as he takes him into his hand again, and man, is he rewarded. Biting back a smile, Dean focuses on the soft ‘o’ Cas’s mouth makes as Dean jerks him. With the lotion slicking his way, Dean tightens his fist just under the head of Cas’s cock on every stroke, and he watches how it makes Cas’s forehead crease between his eyebrows.
Throughout the entire first half of the movie, it’s obvious that Dean’s the only one that appreciates the humor. He’s nearly tearing up with suppressed laughter, while Cas doesn’t even seem to be paying attention at all.
Castiel eventually starts complaining, but in all honesty he lasted longer than Dean thought he would.
It’s not until he gets caught at a red light at the intersection of 44th street and has to pull up that he realizes he’s tired. He’s breathing hard, legs shaking a little. It’s been a while since he’s run like this.
Dean nods vigorously, and if he weren’t suddenly a bit nervous he thinks he would’ve laughed at that - the first time he’s seen Cas so flustered.
It’s dark inside, and Dean doesn’t remember if he saw John’s truck parked outside but his door is wide open and his room is empty. Hopefully he waited for Sam to fall asleep before he left. Dean has no idea what time it is.
Dean listens to them talk, and he resolutely keeps his eyes from wandering out over the water. He does his best to laugh when Ash cracks a joke, and he tries to pay attention when Andy starts talking about how stoked he is to get to smoke all he wants in his new apartment, but after the second joint comes around to him a second time Dean starts to pass it to Jo without taking a hit from it.
Dean shakes his head. “I’m not really sure what happened. I remember - water. Everywhere. I must’ve fallen off the boat, or gotten knocked off, or - I don’t know. But my lifejacket was gone. I had been taking swimming lessons, before, but I couldn’t - I couldn’t find the surface.”
“They can’t possibly be as sore as they were the day after the first time I ran with you,” Cas says, making Dean chuckle at the memory. Cas could barely walk after the first time, and he was grumpy about it the whole day.
Cas looks worried as shit and it makes Dean feel guilty, in some corner of his mind not crowded by terror and dread.
Dean’s back cracks when he stands, making him groan softly, and he collects the bowls off the table. He finds Cas in the kitchen, chugging a glass of water.
They park, Dean feeds the meter, and they walk up towards the boardwalk from the street. They’re only two blocks’ distance from the rides and the arcade that Sam likes, so as soon as they get up to the boardwalk, the ferris wheel is clearly visible down to their right a little ways.
Gnawing the inside of his cheek, Dean presses a thumb up under his sternum. They pull into the parking lot of Northside Park.
“This’ll feel even better,” he whispers, and squirts a dollop into his palm. Tossing the bottle up by Cas’s head, he leans back over. With an elbow braced on the pillow beside Cas, Dean pecks him on the lips once. “Still okay?”
Dean’s flat on his back with his eyes closed against the sun, rays beating down on him with almost-July earnest. It feels good, the warm sand under him and the soft breeze making his hair tickle over his forehead. Castiel’s fingers dance over the inside of his wrist, where Dean has his palm turned up.
But now that Dean knows where John really goes, he can’t even imagine having the energy to come up with some bullshit story like that. To think he’d been making his dad out to be some kind of hero, out saving the world when he was really leaving his kids in a shitty motel room to drive two states away to visit his other fucking -
Castiel collapses onto it, immediately nesting into Dean’s many blankets and pillows. He groans, and the sound brings heat to Dean’s face.
The two of them stand in a quiet that is almost companionable. Below them and around them the tide swells and falls and swells, and the currents churn on. Again, Dean is struck by the ocean’s indifference - he wonders if Gabriel feels the same way, now. He supposes the two of them have something in common.
The girl’s still talking at him, her words just loud enough for Dean to catch through the crowd, but Cas is only nodding along distractedly as he looks towards Dean.
No surprise, Cas had been the one to ask Bobby if they could bring the dog the first time. While Dean had rolled his eyes and started to say something along the lines of, “No, Cas, the dog doesn’t need to come - ”, Bobby had interrupted him.
There’s a shuffling from outside, and the sound of a pair of keys hitting the pavement. A muffled curse, and Dean recognizes the sound immediately.
“Yes,” Cas responds. His ice cream does drip down his hand, and over his wrist. Dean slides some napkins at him across the table.
Inside, they find that there are in fact two kegs, and the three of them fill up cups as high as they can. They pregamed a decent amount beforehand, but free alcohol is free alcohol. Dean downs three quarters of his beer before they even get back out to the patio. Cas must notice, because Dean meets his gaze to find him looking at him with his eyebrows quirked.
“That sucks, man,” she says, her gentle eyes still on him and Dean has to look away again. “I’m real sorry to hear - ”
Fingers stilling, Cas pulls back at that to stare up at Dean’s face. His eyes are wide and Dean sees his throat bob as he swallows and Dean has just enough time to start feeling embarrassed before Cas stutters -
He stands uselessly in the quiet lobby while the lights buzz overhead, too bright. Absently, he wonders if the drunk tank is busy tonight. Thursday, but pretty late in the summer so it’s hard to say. He taps his thumb against his thigh to keep from jamming it between his ribs, his eyes burning from lack of sleep. His jeans are dirty and he’s still in his sleep shirt.
Cas climbs to his feet and Dean only hesitates a moment before he follows. The two of them trudge after Jo and Sam through the hot sand.
With that, John gives a nod. Having said what he’d been seemingly struggling to say for months, or maybe longer, he ducks out of the room. He pulls the door most of the way shut, leaving a gap exactly like the one Dean leaves in Sam’s door when he bids the kid goodnight.
“Hmm,” Sam says, and his tone is speculative and knowing and just lofty enough that Dean can’t ignore it.
“So,” Dean says when Sam starts splashing around and Dean’s sure he isn’t going too far in. He figures this is the time to bring it up, though it makes an ache blossom under his ribs when he thinks about it. He tips his head towards Cas, hesitating a moment before saying, “First day of work tomorrow. How you feelin’?”
Dean’s distracted as he works, eliciting snapped orders from John that get more and more exasperated, which is never good. But Dean can’t focus on helping his dad hammer new boards back onto the fence, his gaze constantly returning to the pool over his shoulder. In an hour, Rufus has it completely drained, leaving only sand and some trash at the bottom.
“How was the last day, Sammy?” Dean asks. He glances at Cas, who looks a little sweaty from his walk, and looks away again.
Cas swipes the back of his hand over his mouth and leans in close to Dean, opening his mouth to say something when he’s cut off by a voice that makes the hair on the back of Dean’s neck stand straight up. His laughter dies in his throat.
“Are you sure this is a good idea?” Cas murmurs, close to Dean’s right. Dean can feel Cas’s eyes on him, and he clenches his jaw.
- pushes off from the side of the pool and drifts lazily to the shallow end, where it settles on the step, tail stretched out in front of it.
“Listen, Dean,” she says. “It’s up to you. I’ve got no problem tellin’ him I couldn’t get ahold of you.”
Dean watches his throat bob, and John pats Dean on the cheek, twice. Slowly, Dean reaches up and takes his wrist.
“I apologize for waking you,” Cas murmurs back, and Dean hums, his eyes falling shut again. “Were you dreaming?”
“Fine,” Dean says. His stomach twists and clenches, and he feels like all of his muscles are strung too tight.
“Wait, so, I’m confused,” Sam says as they get on the sidewalk and start back towards the motel. “You got washed up in that big storm last week?”
They come to a wheat field that’s so expansive it’s as if the trees bordering its back side are miles away, and Dean pulls off onto the dirt road that runs alongside it. He takes the road back far, far enough that they can’t see the street they came off of and there’s only the woods to their right and nothing but wheat to their left, and they get out of the car.
Dean groans as he straightens up, unfolding himself from the cramped position. He twists, making his back pop all the way up his spine. He can feel his shirt sticking to his chest and lower back with sweat, and he has half a mind to just take it off as he looks across the hood at Cas, who’s watching him with dark eyes. Robert Plant continues to croon through the speakers of the old radio Dean had pulled out of Bobby’s garage.
Sam sniggers behind him, and Dean resists the urge to kick him in the shin because there’s no way Cassie doesn’t hear him. He could be projecting, here, but he thinks she blushes pink, high on her light brown cheekbones.
“None of it was fair to you - and I know that it’s fucked, and it’s too late, but I want you to know that there’s nothing I regret more in my whole life. I wish I could take it all back, I wish - I wish I could do it over, do it the right way, and not - not fuck it all up.”
Cas’s skin is hot where Dean has his hands up the back of his shirt. He rucks his t-shirt up around his ribs, skimming his fingers over the muscles of his back and squeezing.
While he doesn’t care about John’s opinion of Cas and where he thinks he comes from, it does make Dean nervous to have Cas staying in his room with him at night. He figures Cas probably catches on because only two days after he spent time in room one he insists he’s feeling “a bit dry” and says he should spend the night in the bathtub - even though these days he usually lasts about four. Dean misses having him in his bed, but he’s grateful to not have to worry about John coming in and catching them.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel says quietly, and it’s so fucking earnest and so fucking genuine that Dean almost can’t take it. Dean stares into his wide, honest eyes, and takes all the comfort from him that he can.
“There he is,” his dad murmurs, and he smiles down at him but his eyes don’t crinkle like they used to. “You gonna be brave for me, Dean?”
As much as it annoys him that everyone knows he and Cas had an argument on the beach yesterday, he can’t deny that it was probably pretty obvious. Dean had stalked back to the umbrella alone, only to be followed by a dejected-looking Cas ten minutes later.
Dean hesitates. He throws a look over his shoulder towards Jo and Sam, who had jogged ahead to where Ellen sits under their umbrella.
Shaking his head but unable to hold back a smile at Sam’s apparent glee, Dean holds a finger to his lips to keep him quiet and ushers Sam to his room. Closing the door behind them, Dean turns to his brother and is met with the inevitable onslaught.
It’s obvious Cas is having a hard time containing himself, his hips jerking beneath Dean’s hands, and Dean has to pull off an inch or so when Cas’s cock hits the back of his throat and he almost chokes. He recovers, though, and sinks down as far as his gag reflex will let him, swirling his tongue and sucking hard, and he looks up at Cas’s face through his lashes. Castiel is staring down at him with his eyes wide and mouth open, and as soon as they make eye contact Cas’s fingernails scrape Dean’s scalp as his hands tighten in his hair and he comes.
Cas tells Dean about the store, and about Frank, and about the animals he saw. He explains that he started the day working at the cash register, but that according to Frank his “people skills” are “rusty” (paired with air quotes, which make Dean’s eyebrows go up), so he spent the rest of the day taking care of the animals. Cas didn’t mind, though, of course. He thought it was great.
Unfolding himself from the chair, Dean blinks around blearily. Sam is asleep on the couch, drooling into the cushions. Their bowls are stacked on the coffee table, and Cas is nowhere to be seen.
Dean pulls off his shirt and collapses onto his stomach on a towel, grabbing the chips and taking a handful. Castiel plops down right in the sand, already bare-chested.
Dean leans in and captures Cas’s mouth, pleased when Cas kisses him back immediately. They stand close, in the middle of the kitchen, still swaying ever so slightly and trading kisses. His thumb brushing the soft skin low on Cas’s back, just above the waistband of his jeans, Dean hums contentedly against his lips. It’s nice, standing there, the sound of the stir fry sizzling on the stove and the TV playing in the other room, and Dean feels warms all over.
“He’s okay,” Sam says. Dean hears him close his book and set it on the nightstand. “He’s been a little sluggish lately.”
“Anna understands, she’s not like - ” Cas says, and there’s a plea to his voice, the anger slipping away like water between the fingers of cupped hands, and Dean knows he’s lost.
His dad reaches for him and Dean goes to him without hesitation, letting himself be pulled into his lap. With his dad’s gigantic hand splayed over his back, warm and heavy, Dean turns his face into his shoulder.
Dean runs hard. He doesn’t give himself a chance to warm up, just hits the pavement and takes off. He runs fast enough that he can’t think, his mind only taken up by the
Scoffing, Dean has to look away at that because he feels his resolve break and he doesn’t want to give Cas the satisfaction. His shakes his head at the driver’s window, his tongue shoved into his cheek to keep himself from smiling.
“Okay!” He exclaims, and he’s up and out of his chair in a flash, snagging his own bowl off the table with a rattle and coming around to collect everyone else’s.
But when Cas kisses him, Dean kisses back with immediate enthusiasm, still chuckling. Dean holds onto the sides of Cas’s t-shirt and tilts his head, slotting their mouths more firmly together. He makes a happy noise in his throat when Cas’s hands wander down Dean’s torso, skimming over his belly to rest on his naked waist.
Sam was right -- it is much roomier on the inside than he expected. It’s not tall enough for him to be any more upright than a crouch, but there’s plenty of floor space. The TV is inside, playing cartoons on a low volume, the light from the screen casting a dim glow throughout the hideout. The low coffee table sits in front of it, and it’s obvious that the two of them have made progress on Cas’s puzzle. There are pillows covering the floor, and it’s actually quite comfortable.
Stepping out of the bus, Dean stands on the sidewalk with the phone to his ear. Foot traffic weaves around him.
Dean talks a girl working at the hot dog place into giving them a large cup of water for free, which she grudgingly hands over.
He remembers the day Missouri had given it to him. It was early in the summer - May, when it was still quiet around the Bunker and Sam was just getting out of school and the very night before there had been that first terrible storm, not unlike the one last night -
“This is Sheriff Jody Mills,” she says, but before Dean’s heart can jump too far up into his throat, she quickly asssures, “No one’s hurt, don’t worry. I’m sorry for callin’ so late.”
“Yeah, Cas, chug it!” Jo calls from across the table, and the guy to Cas’s left grabs the beer off the table, takes the cards out from under the tab, and hands it to him with an only partly sympathetic smile.
His pants and underwear pushed almost to his knees, Dean hastily shoves his first two fingers in his mouth.
John grunts, and turns to go. “Oh,” he says, speaking over his shoulder. “And your trailer park friend’s here, lookin’ for you,” Dean doesn’t miss the slight disdain in his voice as he walks away.
“You’ve gotta be hungry. You want some chili?” Obviously not actually looking for an answer, Bobby pulls a bowl out of a cabinet. He continues talking as he spoons it full. “Had a feeling you were gonna sleep a while. Looks like you needed it.” When Bobby finally turns to him again, Dean is still standing in the doorway. “You want some cheese to sprinkle on it?”
The scrape of Sam’s chair, the soft clatter as he sets his bowl in the sink, and Dean lets out a held breath. He catches Sam’s eye as the kid passes him in the doorway and he tries to convey everything he can in the brief eye contact:
A grudging silence fills the car in place of the complaining, so Dean turns the radio on to fill it.
The further they walk, the more irritated Dean gets. Where the hell are they going? They’re wandering through the ocean side of Fenwick, past the shops and hotels and into the residential area. Finally, Jo pulls off to the right into a wealthy-looking neighborhood.
“He reached for Alastair, didn’t even care about the knife, and he put his hand on him, like right on his chest - ” To demonstrate, Jo lays her palm across Dean’s sternum, fingers splayed, and Dean almost flinches. “ - and Alastair
There’s a guy with a watch that looks more expensive than anything Dean owns, but he’s got a cigarette between his fingers and Dean thinks about asking him for one. The guy’s also wearing pastel-colored shorts, though. Dean rolls his eyes.
Although he’s been working on this car for almost a month now, Dean still feels a rush of gratitude towards Bobby. He wouldn’t even
“Oh, god,” he moans, and the next thing he knows he’s bent in half over his knees with both arms wrapped tightly around his middle, squeezing. Each breath he tries to drag in just saws through him, and he makes a pathetic wheezing noise on each inhale and he’s starting to get light headed and he needs to
Dean’s confused, however, when he ventures to room one to find it empty, the tub drained and dry and Cas’s clothes missing.
“There was…” Dean swallows. “Something happened. When we were livin’ in Iowa. I was twelve, Sammy was six. He was a couple months into the first grade, I remember that.” He throws Cas a glance, who’s listening patiently. “My dad, he - he left for just a couple days. I was s’posed to take Sammy to school, and pick him up, and get him fed, and it was gonna be easy, but - ” Dean clears his throat. “My dad was on his way back, and he was stayin’ somewhere shady for the night, and he got jumped outside a bar. The scumbag took his wallet, so no one at the hospital could identify him for the ten days he was unconscious.”
Castiel’s tail splashes softy, and Dean’s eyes snap to it. He can feel Castiel watching him look at it - it’s huge, and really quite remarkable. Muscular looking, and a glimmering deep blue that seems to change shades in the moonlight, each large scale a slightly different hue.
Lifting his fingers from over his eyes, John turns his head just enough to direct a sideways stare at Dean. “You’re fuckin’ serious?”
Dean cries out and staggers backwards, tripping in his panic and ending up on his ass on the concrete. He scrambles backwards on his heels and hands until his back hits the doors of the shed.
But Dean’s breath is coming faster now, is sticking in his chest more and more each time he tries to draw in air. He drags the heel of his hand over his sternum distractedly.
,” John barks, making Dean jump and look up at him. His dad’s standing with his arms outstretched incredulously, and Dean realizes he has yet to make a move.
“Sure,” John replies, and there’s something strange in his voice that catches Dean’s attention, making him glance up. “I’ll give you some money.”
“Rub that in or it’ll just wash off,” Dean directs, snapping the cap closed and letting Sam run off towards the water with Jo, watching him hastily wipe the sunscreen over his face as he goes.
Frowning, Dean shuts the door behind him and stands for a moment under the portico, looking out over the parking lot.
“Sure, Cas,” he says slowly, and Cas’s mouth turns up in a smile. After a moment, however, he adds, “In this car, though. Not in the Impala.”
“Fine,” she says. “Fine.” She looks around, down Coastal Highway at the sparse traffic. “Let’s just - find a bus.”
“Suit yourself,” Dean mutters, lifting the beer to his own lips and taking several gulps. “Let’s go find Jo.”
“I have, um - ” Dean swallows. He can’t seem to get the words out, a blush creeping up his neck. Instead of trying to explain, he shifts to work his hand into his pocket.
Their intertwined hands rise and fall with Dean’s breath, and that’s all Dean focuses on as he drifts. They breathe, lying together in the dark, the occasional sound of a car passing on Coastal Highway and the faint trickling of Sam’s fish tank from across the hall.
Dean can see the questions burning on Sam’s and Cas’s faces as everyone clambers from the car, but they contain themselves as Dean goes to the trunk and grabs his duffel.
“How do you know any of this? About me and Cas? You said it yourself, you haven’t been around for over twenty years - ”
“Coming,” Dean calls back, and his fucking voice cracks infuriatingly. He grabs a bowl and shoves it unceremoniously at Cas before taking the other two and brushing past him and out of the kitchen.
Cas is standing stock still, staring wide-eyed down the pier. His face has completely drained of color, and he looks like he’s seen a ghost. When Dean follows his gaze down the dock, he doesn’t see anything unusual - just tourists, a few other joggers, kids in strollers.
He starts with the shed, heaving the chairs back up into it so they’re stacked properly. Luckily none seem to be cracked. He stands for a minute, debating what to do next. Considering the pool net and the push broom hanging next to each other on the wall in the shed, he knows which task he
Settling between Dean’s knees, Cas tilts his face up for better access. Feeling bold, Dean bites gently at Cas’s lower lip and he responds by opening his mouth, and their tongues meet.
Dean actually laughs out loud at that, sharp and bitter, because Sam doesn’t need to fucking tell him how Cas has been looking at him, he’s more than aware -
“You sure you don’t want me to stick around?” Dean asks. He knows he’s being ridiculous, but his chest feels tight and he fidgets. “They don’t need chaperones or anything?”
Dean and Cas approach to see a long, narrow tank that winds snakelike along the wall. It only comes up to Dean’s waste and is open at the top so it’s easy to see down into. Just as they catch up to Sam, the kid leans over and reaches out as if to put his hand down into the water.
They finish up slowly, enjoying the weather and the place to themselves. On the way home, they walk in an easy quiet, Sam kicking a rock down the sidewalk. Dean looks over Coastal Highway, hands in his pockets and his mind wandering. They’re nearly home when he’s brought back to the present by Sam’s voice.
Dean’s fingers are tangled with Cas’s on the seat between them and there’s a warm, unfamiliar feeling in his chest that he’s come to associate with moments like these, and Dean has to agree with him.
Back at the apartment, Dean pours Cas a large glass of water and finds a few boxes of Kraft deep in the cupboard. Sam was right, they really don’t have much more than that to eat. He’ll have to ask John for some grocery money.
“Is there anything I can do to help?” Dean casts his eyes around for something that looks like it needs to be done. There’s a can of paint sitting by the fence.
Castiel smiles warmly, and Dean’s chest flutters aggressively and he has to look away. He’s saved from saying anything else as Sam walks back towards them from the water.
Reaching out for another taffy, Gabriel nudges one down the railing towards Dean. He takes it this time, unwraps it carefully. It tastes like strawberries.
And John actually chuckles at that, shakes his head at his boy’s wonder and Dean can’t believe any of this. They look at one another, John’s head tilted sideways to see him and Dean sitting ramrod straight on his mattress, the Impala’s keys clutched in his hand and his heart about ready to swell out of his chest, and it’s the longest they’ve held eye contact since Dean can remember. He swallows.
Ash and Jo move on to talk about how the pizza is better than anything they’ve ever tasted, but Dean falls quiet. He can feel Cas watching him, and avoids meeting his eye.
Cas is right where Dean left him when he goes back. He thanks Dean quietly for the towels and clothes, watching him carefully, and Dean nods. He leaves him again, giving him privacy, after telling him to come up to the Bunker when he’s ready.
“I - okay - ” Dean blabbers, not even sure what he’s saying, “Yeah - no, I understand, I - the first year, that’s - ”
“Castiel was just a kid back then, really,” Gabriel continues. “Spunky little thing he was. Anna followed him around like a guppy, and it got her in trouble a couple times. Never anything serious, mostly just kid stuff, but he was always doing something to piss off Naomi. And it was never intentional, either. Trust me, I did my fair share of pissing them off, but for me it was always on purpose. Castiel - he’s just different. He thinks differently than the rest of them. Of us.”
, Jo, just - ” With a glance over his shoulder at his dad’s retreating back, Dean steps out onto the sidewalk with Jo, pulling the door closed behind himself.
Dean’s solo cup is empty and he has to admit, that jungle juice was strong. He can’t keep the grin off his face or his eyes off Cas, and their gazes meet just before Cas takes his shot and he falters, and misses. The girl makes her next one, and then both teams only have one cup left.
Cas is still asleep when Dean makes it into the bathroom of room one, his head tipped gently against the side of the tub. Not wanting to disturb him, Dean’s about to head to his own bed when Cas stirs. Their eyes meet as Cas wakes.
The eyes stare at him, as wide as the ocean and just as deep, making Dean feel like he’s in a tank. They peer at him, almost curious, a child at the aquarium.
“Uh, yeah,” Bobby finally says. He lifts his glass, indicates around the side of the house. “They’re ‘round back, with the paint. You’ll have to load ‘em.”
They go to the movies, getting cheap matinee tickets and seeing something forgettable. They walk through the blown glass store, where Dean sternly tells both Cas and Sam not to touch anything. They play a game of mini golf for free on the little indoor course at the place with Sam’s picture in the ad - Cas is terrible, and somehow loses three balls. They sit on the handmade rocking chairs under the portico outside the furniture store for a while, looking out over Coastal Highway, and they avoid the Bunker and they avoid the rain.
“Yes,” Cas says, and Dean doesn’t miss how his eyes flit away again. “I mean, they wanted - they wanted to see what I was doing here. They wanted to know where I’ve been.”
“Dad would never let us do anything like this,” Sam says, awe in his voice and a hero-worship in his eyes that Dean thought was long gone. “Thanks, Dean. This is great.”
There’s a bitter taste in Dean’s mouth, rising up from his throat. It tastes like disappointment. Slowly, he asks, “They didn’t say anything else?”
“Cat hasn’t been spoiled like that since he quit. I really thought he’d take her with him when he left.”
“Feels good,” Cas gasps against the corner of Dean’s mouth, and Dean nods. It’s not as good as it probably would be with lotion, but Dean feels hot and needy and he doesn’t have the patience to go get it. He thinks about how he should buy some lube, and his dick twitches heavily in their hands.
Slowly, Dean sits up from where he lies on the couch. The threadbare blanket that was draped over him falls into his lap, and he stifles a groan. His whole body hurts.
When he reaches for him again, Dean steps away before Cas’s outstretched hand makes contact with his arm. Cas’s fingers hang there in the air for a moment, and he looks a bit stung. Dean glances away so he doesn’t have to see it.
In the kitchen, Dean grabs a red popsicle for himself and digs to the bottom of the box for a blue one because he knows it’s Cas’s favorite. Cas smiles when he hands it over.
“We have a bunch,” Sam says with a shake of his head, but he’s not acting like he thinks Dean is being crazy or overbearing or annoying, which Dean appreciates. “Besides, the chaperones get in the kayaks, too,” he adds with a knowing look. They both know that’s not something Dean can do.
really good at this game. He’s fast, and intuned, and has impressive hand-eye coordination that he didn’t demonstrate as well in any of the other games. The machine counts the number of buttons you hit, and only allows three misses before you lose, but Cas is already at over a hundred and hasn’t missed one.
Dean hesitates. He flicks his eyes to Sam, but can’t hold the kid’s gaze at first. His eyes jump around the car before he can force them to settle on his brother. Sam scrutinizes him, his eyebrows drawing down in the middle at whatever it is he’s seeing.
The ride lets off the current load of people, and they shuffle forward inch by inch. They wait another round but are first in line for the next one, the four of them chatting while Vic and Bela contribute to conversation every once in a while.
It lifts a hand, and raises it to rest against Dean’s palm with the glass between them, and Dean wants to flinch away but he can’t move.
“Wait,” Castiel says, voice absolutely wrecked, clutching the trash can to himself with his free arm. “Get Shelly.”
“Her name’s Bela and she has a British accent,” Jo says with disgust. “What’s not to hate? Watch, she’s probably skinny and blond, too.”
“Here,” Dean sets Sam’s food down on the rickety coffee table maybe a little too hard, and Sam raises an eyebrow.
“Dean,” Cas says, the third time Dean gets up while the three of them lie around in the living room, watching a movie.
“Fuck,” Dean gasps. He pulls away from Cas, scrambling to sit up and swing his legs around to get his feet on the floor. “Fuck.”
Shrugging it off, Dean leads the way to the garage, leaving Jo, who stops to talk with some people she knows. He gives the pool a wide berth, and as they walk he nudges Cas to the outside of him, further from the water, to protect him from any splashing that might go their direction.
Dean picks at a spot of rust, avoids Bobby’s eye. “He was gone a couple days, but he’s probably back by now. He had to go pick up some stuff for Memorial Day weekend or something, I don’t know. Didn’t really ask.” He never bothers asking anymore.
“He didn’t,” Dean says with a shake of his head. “He nicked me, on the back of my neck, but that’s all - ”
Dean mulls that over, a creeping suspicion itching at the back of his brain. “When do you work next, then?”
And then Jo is there, and her eyes are wild and she’s saying “We gotta go, come on, Dean you gotta get up,” and it’s only then that Dean registers the sound of the sirens. People are scattering, flooding through the gate and hopping the fence to get out, and Dean works on catching his breath.
Without anything further, Cas dives off the ledge and into the deep end. It’s almost as if the whole pool erupts in light, and Dean turns his head away, bringing an arm up to cover his eyes. When he turns back to the pool, blinking rapidly to dispel the spots left on his retinas, it’s to see just a few ripples across the water. Then, Cas’s head comes up on the other side of the pool, and he’s laughing. He shakes his head like a dog, water flying from the ends of his hair.
“I know I put a lot on you,” John finally says, talking to the carpet in the hallway and Dean listens to his heart pounding in his ears. “For a long time, I have.”
He tries to see, tries to swivel his head towards it but he has no concept of direction and his eyes burn with saltwater. It doesn’t touch him, keeping a careful distance, but he can feels its watchful eyes on him and he’s terrified. It peers at him, curious.
“Dean, I’ve got you on the night shift on Friday. And Ellen knows to call you if somethin’ comes up, so keep your phone on you.”
Cas nips his lower lip gently before letting it fall from his teeth. Dean pulls away, and opens his eyes. He’s just opening his mouth to get the words out, but Cas speaks first.
Cas does, and they trade kisses for a few minutes, lying together with their limbs tangled. Dean nudges his face into Cas’s neck, breathing him in, and he can feel the contented noise Cas makes rumble in his chest.
Thankfully Sam’s concentrating too hard to have heard that, because Dean thinks he just might’ve shit himself.
- Alastair’s other arm comes around Dean’s neck to the front of him, and there’s a bright glint that flashes in the corner of Dean’s vision. The people closest gasp, and some girl screams. Dean’s blood runs cold and he freezes.
Grubby cap pulled low over his eyes, and poly-fill vest faded after probably decades of being worn, Bobby Singer epitomizes the archetype of an old crank. Living alone in a salvage yard with an ‘attack dog’ doesn’t help, but Dean’s known since he was a kid how much of a softy Bobby really is. It was only in the last couple years that Dean had grown out of calling him ‘Uncle’.
“Because it’s fun. And you get to see things.” Dean doesn’t know what made him come up with this out of nowhere, but now that he has he can’t think of a better thing for them to do.
“We’re going on a road trip,” Cas says, taking the backpack from Dean as he hands it to him. “Dean packed you a bag.”
“We’re okay,” his dad says softly as Dean’s sobs begin to subside, his breath hitching so violently it wracks his little frame. “We’re gonna be okay. I know, kid, I know. Shh, we’re gonna be okay.”
Benny looks confused, and Dean splutters on his water and sets his glass down too hard, making them both turn to stare at him.
As much as he doesn’t want to, Dean climbs off of Cas to sit beside him, letting a hand trail over his chest as he pulls away. He sighs.
Feathers and string pool into his hand. He pulls the brown paper away completely, crumpling it into a ball against his thigh.
Sam rolls his eyes, but he smiles. “Sorry you got stuck with this jerk,” he says to Castiel. “It’s nice to meet you. Where’d you move from?”
The others all get pizza, but Dean just orders a side of fries. He hasn’t worked for Bobby in a while, and his wallet’s light to prove it.
“This has nothing to do with you,” Dean says, and his voice is rock solid steady and he sees it visibly take John aback. “Bobby’s doing me a favor, and I’m gonna pay him back. We have an agreement, me and him, and it has nothing to do with you - ”
It’s not too crowded yet, as the sun isn’t supposed to set for another few hours, but there’s still plenty to see. The shops are all open, from souvenir and beachwear places, to donuts and candy kitchens. Dean watches as Castiel takes a deep breath of salty air, his eyes darting only briefly towards the ocean.
Dean agrees, and they head that way. They hand over the last of their tickets and climb on, Dean getting on the seat across from Sam and Castiel. The dolphin’s allowed on this one, so Cas holds it happily in his lap.
“Sam, you don’t wanna see them swim. Watch a video of it on the internet, I’m sure you can find one.”
Dean rolls his eyes at that. He’s about to put his phone down without answering when she sends another.
“You wanna help me out here?” Dean gives him a pointed look. Sam huffs a little but he steps up and starts separating darks from lights. Their elbows bump.
“I’ve been practicing,” Cas says by way of explanation for his new-found confidence, twisting his wrist on the upstroke with a practiced tightening of his fist.
“You thirsty or anything?” Dean asks as he unlocks the apartment door. “You sure you don’t want to go in the pool for a couple hours?”
Every time Jo draws a two from the deck and gets to pick the person who’s supposed to drink, she chooses Cas, and she thinks that’s hilarious. It’s when Dean finally starts to relax that he realizes he was tense ever since they got there. He finds himself smiling as Cas lifts his cup to his mouth with a roll of his eyes,
John never joins them for dinner. Usually Dean just leaves leftovers in the fridge for him, and they’re gone by morning, but he thinks he can count on one hand the times they all ate together. No one really seems to know what to do.
Everyone goes nuts at that, hooting and shouting, but Dean only gets the satisfaction of seeing the absolutely murderous expression on Alastair’s face for a second before Jo and Cas shove him out the door and onto the patio.
Being careful with himself, Dean concentrates on his breathing. He counts until he gets to seven, but the air doesn’t come in and out any easier.
Sam is absolutely gaping at him, his mouth hanging open. Composing himself quickly, Dean clears his throat.
Dean shifts a little in his seat. “All over, really. My dad moved us around a lot. I think it was something like twelve different states in the five years we were gone.”
“Wow,” he whispers, and they stand next to each other and watch the lights dance and flare, both of them maybe a little bit too baked but neither of them caring.
Standing in the middle of the kitchen, paper towel still clutched in one hand, Dean looks at his little brother. Dean blinks.
He does so slowly, sluggish in the heavy dark around him. No idea what time it is. He rolls over, the hairs on the back of his neck prickling with the shadows of his dream shifting in the back of his mind, seeping away. His phone is vibrating.
Slowly, Dean does as he’s told. He gets to his feet, carefully straightening as much as Alastair will allow, paying close attention to the sharp edge against his Adam’s apple. Once he’s standing, Alastair backs up and he pulls Dean with him. Stumbling, Dean does his best not to lose his footing as Alastair drags him all the way to the railing.
Slowly, he leans down and presses his mouth to Dean’s, kissing him for a long moment before finally pulling away and releasing his wrists.
To no one’s surprise, the party does eventually get busted. For the size that it was, it’s pretty impressive that the party lasted as long as it did, considering how strict the cops are during senior week.
“Yeah, I’ll say,” Dean scoffs. “You scared the shit out of me, dude.” Dean plops down on the toilet lid.
of the cap. It’s not until Cas slides an arm around him and slips his slippery fingers under the waistband at the back of Dean’s jeans that he gets the idea. He tips his pelvis forward, trying to give Cas better access as he works a hand down the back of his pants. It’s rather awkward, with Dean on his lap and his pants pulled tight across his backside with the way his legs are splayed, and Cas can only get a couple fingers teasing down the crack of his ass before Dean lets out a frustrated huff.
“Oh, shit,” Dean says. He turns to Cas, and it’s just as their eyes meet, both pairs wide with alarm, that the first clap of thunder splits the sky.
Dean is suddenly exhausted. He lets Cas comb his slender fingers through his hair, and it feels amazing. The emotional roller coaster that was the last hour seems to be catching up to him, his whole body feeling heavy. But here Cas is, in his arms, and he understands the magnitude of that - after all Cas has witnessed, all he’s come to understand about Dean, he’s here, and Dean isn’t sure what to do with that. He wants to feel grateful, and a part of him is, but he also feels cautious.
“Anyway, you boys mind droppin’ somethin’ off for me while you’re out?” Bobby asks. “I’ve just got an old box of some parts for a friend of mine, needs taken to his place out near Sinepuxent.”
“I, uh,” John says, clears his throat when his voice comes out sticky. “I figured we have some things we need to work out, huh?”
“Nonsense, boy,” she waves a hand at him and disappears into her room. Dean looks at Cas, who appears unfazed.
Cereal momentarily forgotten, they watch as their dad appears in the doorway, where he stops when he catches sight of them at the table. He’s changed his clothes since last night, and looks like he’s showered.
Dean swallows, standing over his dad in the dark with his stomach twisting. He jams a thumb between his ribs, hard.
“I think it sounds exciting,” Cas says. Sam gives Dean a bitch face, and Dean rolls his eyes, rinsing out his toothbrush and leaving the water on for them.
“Family’s important,” John says, and Cas visibly deflates in relief. “Dean’s doin’ the same thing. Stickin’ around, helping me with the motel.”
The drive to Benny’s Diner isn’t long, but Dean finally has to bat Castiel’s hand away from the buttons on the dashboard after he switches the radio station for the tenth time.
“Damn right this is your fault. If that pool’s not ready by this weekend, that money’s comin’ outta your pocket, you hear me?”
“Do you see now where interfering gets you?” She continues anyway. “Washed up, Castiel, due to that one moment of intervention. Inias warned you against it, and now look what it’s all led to - ”
With that, Dean is fully naked, lying flat on his back and breathing hard. He’s uncomfortably aware of the hot flush creeping up his neck from his chest, and the way his dick curves up towards his belly, and Cas just sits over him and looks at him.
“Alright, Sam,” Dean says, flicking on the light in the kitchen. “I’ll give you the choice. It’s eleven o’clock. You can either help me do the dishes, or you can get ready for bed. Your call.”
After Dean drops Sam off, making him promise not to forget to put the milk in the refrigerator, it’s just about two o’clock and he heads off again towards Devereaux’s pet store. Against his better judgement he lets his mind wander on his way there, to dangerous territory.
When they’re all feeling significantly less than sober, they pack up all the alcohol into Jo’s backpack to take with them and straighten the room up.
One of their regulars, Miss Moseley, is sitting in the chair that she keeps under the portico outside of her usual room, number seven.
“Ash got it all for me. I know you guys wanted to see the ones on the beach, but I thought maybe you’d like to light some off yourselves - ”
The words come out sounding flat but they still hurt. They drag up from where they were shoved deep in Dean’s chest, scraping like splintered driftwood the whole way. The words he couldn’t say for the past nineteen days, the ones that were flooding him.
“I don’t know,” he repeats uselessly. He still can’t even believe what Bobby’s telling him - he did all of this, for Dean?
Dean stands, pulling Cas up from the couch. After Dean shuts off the TV, the living room falls dark and quiet, and Cas is a silent shadow standing in the middle. Finding Cas’s hand, Dean takes it and leads the way down the hall to his bedroom, where the neon sign outside casts a dull glow over the bed.
Neither says anything for quite a while. The quiet is heavy, just on the wrong side of awkward, and Dean can’t help but shoot a glance or two at Cas out of the corner of his eye.
John’s truck is outside the apartment when Dean finally makes his way up the parking lot. He heads for the door without hesitation.
Dean doesn’t consider himself a lightweight by any means. In fact, he’s pretty confident in his ability to hold his own when it comes to drinking.
Fuck, he really can’t breathe. He’s inhaling water into his lungs, and he’s going to die. He’s going to drown -
“Yes, sir,” Cas says with a nod. Dean thinks the words sound strange in his mouth, and he doesn’t like it.
“Stingrays are much smaller,” Cas explains. “They live on the ocean floor, like this one, while manta rays live in the open ocean.”
Dean doesn’t hear from John until midday on Monday. He actually misses the call, because he goes on a run and leaves his phone at the apartment. There are thunderstorms in the forecast for the next couple of days, so he figured they should get one in while the sun was out.
“What do need the waterproof camera for, though?” Dean asks, eyebrows drawn down. “I thought you were gonna be on kayaks. You’re not getting in the water, are you?”
And Dean crawls onto his mattress, sliding under the covers and burrowing down on the side closest to the wall. He lies with his back facing Cas, and just listens. A long moment passes before Cas finally follows, getting into bed without a word and taking a minute to get settled.
All their beach bags and towels are piled on the seat between Dean and Cas, and they can barely see each other over the mound. Dean has his elbow jammed against the window and his chin in his hand to watch the passing scenery, barely listening to Sam babbling from where he sits up front between Ellen and Jo.
Dean had nodded, his throat tight, and had gripped Bobby’s shoulder rather than try and find any words to express his gratitude.
Dean rolls his eyes, opening his mouth to say something snarky back at him just as the door to number seven opens ahead of them.
It’s not like Dean wasn’t expecting the question - it would have been stupid for him not to be. He hasn’t once shown up at Bobby’s alone since May. But he still balks a bit when Bobby asks, maybe because it’s the first time he’s heard that name said aloud in a while.
Drizzles are still falling idly on the concrete outside when Dean sets Cas up in room one late one night a few days later. Cas hasn’t stayed overnight in the tub in a while, using the pool or sleeping in Dean’s bed since they’d gotten back from the road trip. Though Dean feels guilty admitting it to himself, it was nice not having John around for a while so they could spend that time together without worrying.
Dean vaguely recognizes that he does feel pretty good, relaxed for the most part and not particularly paranoid or nervous. He turns to Cas and finds him already watching him, the look of wonder still clear as anything on his face.
Dean scoots his chair away from her and she sneers at him, but lets go of it and stands up straight, which was his desired outcome.
Dean says nothing, feeling trembly and not trusting his voice. He’s hyper aware of his wet jeans sticking to his legs.
Almost gently, and agonizingly slow, he touches the knife to Dean’s throat. The cold edge of the blade makes Dean flinch.
Cas actually laughs, a sound that comes from in his chest and seems to erupt out of him before he can stop it, and Jesus it sounds so beautiful to Dean’s ears that it makes him ache. He wraps his arms around Cas tight and pulls him impossibly closer, grinning up at him with Cas’s hands on either side of his face.
Bobby raps his knuckles on the hood. “Once you’ve finished up the body work, I’ll order the paint. So start thinkin’ about a color.”
The Ocean City Police Station is on the bay side of 65th street. It’s less than a ten minute drive at this time of night, and it doesn’t feel long enough. Dean grips the Impala’s steering wheel with both hands, his eyes still fuzzy with sleep despite the thrum beneath his skin.
“You’re okay,” Cas whispers, and Dean opens his eyes as Cas leans forward to press his lips to his forehead. They’re warm, too.
And there’s that presence, near him. If he tries to look, his eyes burn with salt water and he has to squeeze them shut, but he can see the light through his lids, it’s so bright. It scares him shitless, and he thrashes.
The muscles of Cas’s stomach tighten against Dean’s knuckles on each stroke and he thinks Cas’ll probably come any second before he gets an idea.
Momentarily caught in the almost golden-brown gaze that’s locked on him, Dean balks. This time, there’s something unmistakably familiar about the way the guy’s staring at him - as if he’s memorizing Dean’s face - and it causes a twinge beneath Dean’s ribs.
For the rest of the ride back to the Bunker, Dean lets Cas hold his hand. He sees him glancing at him more than once out of the corner of his eye, that worried frown across his brow, but Dean doesn’t have the energy to say anything. He feels drained.
Cas drags himself up from where he’s taking up the entire front bench. Settling in behind the steering wheel, Dean has to agree that the seats are quite comfortable. He’ll have to let Bobby know he picked good ones. A glance at Cas shows him slouched in the passenger seat, head tipped back against the headrest and face tilted towards Dean. He’s got his feet up on the dashboard, but since he’s just in his socks, Dean lets it slide.
It’s been a long time since Sam’s suggested that. He used to do it a lot, when they’d first moved back. When Dean spent more time worrying, chewing his nails and digging at his ribs, than he did talking. He remembers how his dad looked at him, and he’s standing in the kitchen with Sam and Cas but he’s thinking of his father, and the first time he saw him look afraid.
“There was an argument. It was the same one as always, but it escalated. It was about me, and my fascination with - with humans, and how they despised it.” Cas takes a deep breath. “Until I told them that I was leaving, I was going on land to see what it was truly like. And Zachariah, he - ”
“Dean,” Cas breathes into his skin, his hips twitching up into Dean’s hand and fingers probing deliciously inside him, three of them now. The stretch is pleasant and Dean tries to chase it, canting his hips back into Cas’s touch.
Dean leans in to kiss him, and both their mouths are wide and desperate for one another and he can feel Cas tensing below him, getting close. Cas doesn’t make a sound but he’s canting his hips up into Dean’s hand in erratic thrusts. When Dean can’t even concentrate on kissing him anymore, he drops his face into Cas’s neck, where he just gasps, mouth open against his collarbone.
Dean tosses his jeans in the hamper. Cas’s are on the floor, of course, so Dean snatches them up and throws them in, too. He finds the socks Cas was wearing earlier beneath them, and grabs them up with a huff. They’re chucked in the hamper with maybe a little too much force.
Cas strips, and Dean watches the wall politely until he hears Cas sigh as he gets settled, the bright light from his transformation dying down in his peripheral vision.
Sitting side by side on the couch, both of their legs drawn up underneath them, they kiss in the space between them. For a moment, their lips are the only point of contact, before they inevitably gravitate towards one another.
Dean snorts. “That dog was never trained, Bobby, and you know it.” He takes the coke and cracks it open, giving Bobby a grateful nod before taking a swig.
Alastair is leading, Azazel close behind, and it’s obvious they’ve already spotted Dean. The sickeningly sweet smile Alastair usually wears is nowhere in sight, and instead he looks absolutely murderous and they stalk Dean’s way. Briefly, the image flashes in Dean’s mind of Alastair treading water in the deep end of a pool, dripping wet and furiously yelling profanities. It seems that Alastair hasn’t forgotten, either.
With a smile, Gabriel nods approvingly, as though to himself. “You’re sharp, kid, I’ll give you that.” He straightens. “That was my best move. Check it out.”
The place is trashed. The doors to the storage shed must have been blown open, because a stack of pool chairs lay toppled over in the doorway. An umbrella that he doesn’t think even belongs to them is broken and strewn across the deck among an unbelievable amount of seaweed. The fence that surrounds the area has boards missing on the side nearest to the ocean, and not just a few.
“I told you that my mom died,” Dean finally says. He hears Cas nod against the pillows beside him, his eyes trained on the ceiling. The shadows shift, faintly, as a car passes on Coastal Highway. “But I never told you how, huh?”
He leans forward for a minute, hands on his knees, waiting for the light to change. When it does, he crosses back to the ocean side and turns back for the Bunker. The last half mile he takes easy, jogging steadily until he reaches the parking lot, where he slows to a walk.
A light erupts - it’s blinding, so bright it’s overwhelming, and Dean turns his face away with his eyes squeezed shut against the devastating white.
“Night, guys,” Sam says over his shoulder before pulling open the door and slipping inside. He waves before tugging it shut behind him.
“What - ” Abruptly, Dean understands. He nods. “Okay. We can do that. Um - ” He wracks his brain. The pool still isn’t refilled. “Room one has a bathtub, a big one. We’ll go there, okay?”
“I’m fine,” Dean says, though he rubs the pads of his fingers over his sternum. “What the hell was that?”
“Yeah,” Dean says. “He doesn’t get it, though. I mean, I’m - I’m my dad’s go-to guy, you know? He depends on me to be there for him, so I gotta - I gotta be there.”
On his way out of the kitchen, Dean sees Cas try and come after him out of the corner of his eye, but Sam catches his arm.
He slinks through the door to the lobby, and creeps down the hall that comes up around the side of the front desk. A peek around the corner shows the spinny chair empty, light spilling out from the doorway to the back room. He can’t remember who’s working the night shift tonight - was it Ellen? He thought Jo had said something about Ellen having to train a new manager at the Roadhouse one of these nights, but John’s truck was gone earlier, meaning
“And I’m sure I wouldn’t even wanna know most of it, or else I’d be showin’ up on your daddy’s doorstep with a shotgun.” At that, Dean exhales humorlessly through his nose, but he doesn’t interrupt. “But I want you to know, kid…. Not a day goes by I don’t wish I tracked you boys down sooner, got you back here. Especially before Iowa.”
John hangs around during the week, working at the Bunker and doing odd jobs around the apartment. He takes notice of Cas hanging around, but doesn’t say much about it other than a stray comment about Dean still spending time with that “trailer park kid,” which Dean doesn’t have a response to.
“So,” Sam says into the uncomfortable silence, his speech muffled by the chicken and broccoli in his mouth.
They slip through the gate and as Dean looks over his shoulder he recognizes the silhouette of one Sheriff Jody Mills, illuminated by the headlights of her cop car, right before the three of them take off. Though he’s no longer afraid of Jody, Dean’s still scared shitless of what John would do if she drove him home in the back of her car for being drunk, at a party, and fighting. The last time this happened, Jody swore it’d be only one more before she called his dad.
“That’s not true,” Dean says with a scowl, but the blunt look that Sam levels at him when he straightens up shuts him down. He sighs.
just kids, but in reality the last time something weird was happening in the pool, there was an honest to god fucking
It was the corner of Brandywine and Harwich. Dean can recall learning to memorize it in the first grade. The house was tucked back into some trees and there was a screened-in porch in the back that faced east, and a narrow pebbled path that led from the side door all the way out to the backyard. His mom always hung these giant ferns on the front porch, and his dad parked the Impala in the garage.
. Dean rolls his eyes. Sam’s always wanted to drive down and see those stupid horses swim. It’s an annual tradition, for the wild ponies to get herded across the channel from Assateague Island to Chincoteague Island, where a few of them are auctioned off before the rest are guided back.
But it doesn’t even matter, and Dean’s wasting time thinking about it, because if it’s Ellen or Rufus or freakin’
He hears his breath echoing back at him in the small space and his heart beating in his ears. To him, it’s deafeningly loud, and he hopes it doesn’t give away his hiding place.
But Cas gets his hands on either side of Dean’s neck, sliding them around so he’s almost cradling Dean’s head between them, and he’s impossibly gentle. The warmth comes again, and the dull glow, and Dean lets his eyes fall closed because it’s easier than looking at the soft, desperate expression Cas wears on his face.
in my pool, and it sassed me, and it splashed water on me, and I think I’m losing it.” No matter how many times Dean blinks and shakes his head, it’s still there. Lounging in the shallow end, staring at him.
There’s only inches between them and he should be terrified, should be shitting his goddamn pants, but Dean is standing at his full height and of all things in that moment he thinks his dad doesn’t look all that tall.
There’s a pounding in Dean’s head. It’s loud, and incessant, and while it doesn’t quite hurt it’s getting on his fucking nerves.
Dean hums distractedly in response, and finally comes up successfully with a towel that he pulls out of the bottom of a bin. It’s dusty, but it’ll do.
“Yeah, well,” Dean says. He trains his stare back on the ponies, but he can barely see them over the shoulders of the people in front of him.
Dean doesn’t push the matter even though he wants to, but Cas does turn out to be okay. They come up on Cambridge within the next hour, and Cas visibly relaxes just before Dean even sees the water. Cas takes a deep breath, his eyes closing against the breeze, as Route 50 sends them north and they cross over one of the Bay’s tributaries. Dean turns up the music.
Cassie exhales. “Back then I thought you were telling me you were gay because you wanted to dump me - ”
Dean nods. “Yeah, alright.” He swallows, and suddenly can’t quite find the words to express the all-consuming gratitude sitting heavy on his chest. “Bobby, I - ”
“You’re a fucker,” Dean whispers, but it’s unconvincing and only makes Cas laugh. “Come back down here.”
After peeking in Sam’s door to see the kid curled up and quiet under his covers, Dean finally shuffles to his own room, Cas following.
.” Dean throws up his hands and turns to leave. “We can drive. But if my baby gets scratched, I’m blaming you. Let’s go.”
Cas squints his eyes open and catches Dean looking at him, but he doesn’t look particularly fazed. In fact, he just gazes back at him until it’s Dean who turns away first.
“Uh, no, just me. I was just - ” Dean rubs at the back of his neck and glances at the pool. “Checking out the damage.”
Dean sits completely still. He has his lips pressed together firmly and he resolutely ignores the sting in the back of his eyes.
Dean’s had the idea in his head all week, and he knows Sam and Cas will both love it. He manages to meet up with Ash to buy the stuff without either of them finding out, but he has trouble keeping the secret until Thursday night.
Bobby freezes. One hand around the bowl of chili and the other clutching a spoon, he lifts his eyes to stare at Dean.
Without thinking, Dean does as he’s told, and he leans further over the edge as Cas sinks into the water. Before he can register what’s happening, Dean’s face touches the surface. He holds his breath, and he feels Cas’s lips against his, and there’s pool water between their mouths, and holy fuck his face is underwater.
They get in line, which is short enough that they get on the next time the ride stops. The operator tells Cas that he can’t bring his dolphin on, so he asks the guy if he can hold it for him. The look on the guy’s face is hilarious, but he agrees, taking the stuffed toy from him with a shake of his head.
