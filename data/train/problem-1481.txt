Sherlock turned her head slightly and gave him a look of warning, but how could John obey when the man couldn’t take a hint, even though Donovan had moved in closer, her lips practically on Sherlock’s in a clear sign that said “she’s taken”
Some things never change, and to anyone who didn’t know Sherlock the way he did, they’d assume she was one of them
Sally, as predicted, let herself a fraction of a second to let her gaze dart around the room, the corners of her lips pulling downwards when there was no sign of the forensic analysis
“Was that her name?” she held her clipboard to herself again, though more like a shield, like the topic wasn’t a comfortable one for her, but she still wanted to know. “Sherlock just called her ‘the Woman’. Bit important, she was…? Was she her girlfriend?”
“And why not?” She sighed, the sigh she reserved when John was being especially slow at seeing something
If you asked him outright why he was always so quick to correct any assumptions, John would have responded with the typical ‘because none of it is true’
“It’s not just you anymore, Sherlock!” John replied harshly, crossing his arms with a look that spoke his refusal to back down
“W-W-wait, wait” John gasped, head hanging and lips remaining parted, he forced his eyes open to meet hers, her annoyance at being stopped clear on her face
“Yeah…yeah I’m fine…Sherlock…Sherlock!” he called, attempting to calm her down, but the second she left his sight his leg buckled and nearly gave out from under him
But this wasn’t their usual fight. This wasn’t about her deducing innocent people, or growing fungus on chunks of skin in the fridge, or flirting with poor Molly to get body parts off of interesting victims
“Ah! So it’s true!” An older gentlemen with a bearded face grinned in greeting as Sherlock and John entered, dressed in their usual attire, her arm held his in a practiced manner that made it look all the more natural and genuine
She had something to do that didn’t involve breaking, burning, or slicing something, and that was a definite improvement, he could deal with a few random moans now and then if that was the trade off
He was holding up a hand to a passing waiter to tell the man he wasn’t quite yet ready to order, his usual jumper and cardigan combo switched out for a nice suit and tie, and clearly not used to wearing such attire, his fingers danced along the edge of the tie a few times, loosening it and tightening over and over until the once straight triangle looked as though it was tied by a toddler
“I was wondering when you were gonna settle, Sheryl!” the man laughed heartedly and pat his full stomach, before spreading his arms wide in invitation
“Don’t try to analyze things, John, you’re lacking the proper skill level” Sherlock said after a pause, turning slightly so she laid on her side, back to the cushions and one arm draping off the sofa, hanging near his shoulder
Didn’t mean he couldn’t be outright upset with the brat for constantly bullying her way into every waking moment of his life, just that he recognized he was at fault too
She never brought it up, or pointed it out; even when it was so obvious even someone without her skills of deduction could figure out it wasn’t his gun he was sporting in his trousers, and for that, he was grateful.
“Maybe we could go back to your place…for a cup of coffee?” She asked, with a fake air of hesitance, as if trying to say she didn’t do this often
“You’ve been idling playing with your ring since our wedding, I’m simply informing you that it will continue to be there unless you remove it”
Reading her intention, he planted one last kiss to her inner thigh and followed up her body, licking her navel and in between her breasts as he went
“Oh. Right.” John said back, “H-how” He cleared his throat “How long have you known her? Sherlock, I mean”
He froze, hands still cupping her small breasts, panting out and hoping she wouldn’t reject him just then, not after he just got a taste, a feel of what being with Sherlock would really be like, only to have it so cruelly yanked away at the last second
if y'all want, since once this story is finished I will no longer be writing for this fandom, you can see what other fandoms I fell into
“Lestrade abides me because I get the cases solved. If I observed as well as his team, he’d have left me behind long ago” A pained edge touched her voice, and she turned back to the microscope with a sense of finality, mumbling the last words under her breath “Honestly, John, you forget just how little normal people understand”
She yanked open the door, and though it was no surprise to Mycroft that Sherlock would come to banish him from the flat, his face still flushed from anger and embarrassment at the sight of her, not bothering to hide his obvious distaste for his sister’s attire, or, rather, lack there of
He didn’t have to say the last bit, it lingered at the end of his sentence all the same, causing her to move, bolting upright and openly snarling in his direction
Dear, sweetheart, darling, love. The various different names he’d given Sherlock, never addressing her as her real name, but whether it was to point out their obvious gender differences, or some sick form of flirting only psychopaths were capable of, John didn’t know. Only that every time the words left Jim’s lips, the anger in the pit of his stomach grew, and the only thing on his mind was shoving his fist down the creep’s throat
He reached out the tuck a curl behind her ear, giving her a comforting half smile that Sherlock knew was fake
“We had…different interests” she closed her eyes for a second, taking a breath as if to steady herself, and her next words came out a bit rushed, like they always did whenever she was unsure about a possible social queue she’d missed “Perhaps it was my own fault. Very rarely do young couples avoid intimacy. It was obvious any man that age would grow to expect it from a significant other and leave one unwilling, it was the social norm after a certain period of time to engage in such activates, after all”
Mycroft, of course, likely involving a conversation of their actions, some foolish family obligation; a social convention of the proper roles of a big brother Mycroft felt the need to fulfill, and Sherlock didn’t bother with the details on how her brother found out. Even with her precautions, they were all useless when John was an open book, his recent activities so plain and easy to read on his face, it was no wonder her brother found out
It was time he gave up fighting it, the moon was more likely to fall out of the Earth’s orbit than John to fall out of Sherlock’s
The sound of giggling, combined with muffled laughter and obvious joy told Sherlock everything she needed to know about just who was waiting for her inside Scotland Yard
“She’s no-” he quickly cut off his sentence, realizing whatever lie Sherlock had to tell in order to be allowed to stay was just fine, because if she set her mind to being by his side during recovery, he was happy “Y…yes, she really is…” John gave a smile that he knew came out shy, his free hand inching closer to Sherlock’s, brushing the edge of his pinkie to her thumb, and surprised to feel her cling to him immediately like an infant’s reflex; strong and steady though showing no signs of waking
“No, I get it.” John interrupted, holding up a hand with a friendly smile “Sherlock doesn’t really acknowledge anyone, just the way she is”
John shrugged, one of his hands resting on Junior’s shoulder, even at 10 the boy was pushing 5’2” and John was starting to worry he’d be taller than him by the time he hit puberty. “Sherlock’s right. It’s not dangerous”
“Unnecessary” she replied, and once again ran her deadly long fingers up his shaft through his pants, causing his legs to buckle
They walked onwards for a few more minutes, and he took the time to admire the gleam in her eyes, long lost since her pregnancy and she had to stop working, unable to have seen it first hand, Sherlock in her most basic element, like watching an artist lift a brush, the promise of the crime scene left her moving gracefully, and he had the strongest urge to pull her into a nearby alley and have at it, to hell with the Work, but he couldn’t stop her, not now at least
But he needed more, more proof, more physical touch to reassure the dark corners of his mind and calm his subconscious
She heard the sound of footsteps slowly receding, and was pleased to know the woman was gone by the time she turned around
After she announced her pregnancy so casually, it seemed to be all The Yard would talk about. Whispers and stares, more than usual, came their way whenever they went anywhere, and Lestrade was cutting back Sherlock’s consulting time to the point he just didn’t call her at all, worried about her and the unborn child she harbored
“The jewel thief was subdued, you’ll find him handcuffed to a railing inside” Sherlock tone was calm and cool as always, causing John’s fingers to curl like hooks into his palms, biting into the flesh so hard they shook with tension
Mycroft came in last, almost hesitantly, the drama of delivery seeming to shake his confidence just a bit, as it should, seeing as how Sherlock nearly hit him with a glass vase
She needed puzzles, the chases, the games that played out so well in her head and occupied her time and mind better than anything
I'll try to update soon, but no promises, since it's pride month and a lot of ppl are buying my LGBTPN merch off Etsy, I'm gonna get a lil busy making them as well as coming up with new designs
“Your wife is very devoted, Dr. Watson, she hasn’t left your side all night” her tone was hushed as she checked the pulse of his wrist
So lets get this chapter out of the way, and I'll tell y'all something else at the end of the chapter
This was about her not giving him the decency of knowing where she was, this was about her running off ahead of him and leaving him to chase after her figure, this was about how he kicked so many doors open in varies buildings until finally finding her, arms tied tightly behind her back, lip popped and swollen, forehead split, bruises shaped like fingers forming around her neck
The rest of the night passed with a blur, and sometime later, they were both back at the flat, Sherlock pulling her hair up and out of her face, running John’s pocket-handkerchief over her mouth and staining it with blood red lipstick
John opened and closed his mouth a few times before shaking his head, muttering ‘brat’ under his breath
She looked at him, as if she had forgotten she was bloody half naked on the couch, and he stared back unmoving, already used to the way her eyes flickered over every inch of his face, deducing everything in a simple second
It wasn’t that he was curious about her sex life, or that he felt he had the right to know, but the idea of Sherlock not having been with anyone, tall, beautiful, genius Sherlock, it didn’t seem plausible, but she hadn’t denied the nickname Mortiary gave her, leaving John to believe that maybe he was right
Lestrade quickly picked up on that fact, but said nothing. It wasn’t his place to get in between them during a row, just let it take it’s course, where by the end, John would forgive whatever mistake Sherlock made, and she wouldn’t apologize for it and continue on as if nothing had happened
This time, though…this time felt different, and for the first time, she wasn’t scared, she didn’t want to flinch away from the unfamiliar swell of emotions building in her stomach, to run away from what could very well be the end of her only true friendship all for the risk of something more.
Sherlock hadn’t reacted in the slightest, simply looking around, noting all the details and announcing where the other children were being held, immediately departing after that.
“Caption John Watson, Army Doctor, Medically discharged and currently residing with me in our flat in London. 5 years my senior, been acquainted for 18 months, two weeks, and three days. Really, is this going to be the main topic for small talk social conventions dictate must take place during dinner?”
“I have no reason to be jealous. Your advances are hardly sincere, a pitiful attempt to gain Anderson’s attention. He left about a minute ago to phone his wife.”
An hour in, and no disturbances, John wondered if tonight would be the night he finally managed to take someone home
John flexed his hand that was in Lestrade’s grip, before letting out a shaky sigh, and nodding for the DI to release him as he got off
“But of course,” her response was automatic as expected, before her lips twitched up at the corners “though there is a room similar to the one in which we are, modeled of 221b”
“I don’t see why not. With a mattress this size there is at least a foot between us, even when we are both comfortably settled”
As he undid her makeshift blindfold, she took one look at the location, breathed a soft gasp, and turned back to him abruptly, grabbing his shoulders and spinning them once, twice, before letting go and doing a little hop in place
The silence carried on, and John thought for sure after a while she was off somewhere else, deep in her mind palace or perhaps even asleep
He turned his attention to Sherlock with a look that spoke volumes of his disappointment in her behavior, most of which was rubbing off on Junior “This is about being socialized properly, I won’t have him dismissing people like you used to”
Once she left, he was a bit upset with Sherlock for claiming to be his wife, if she hadn’t, he could have asked for Amy’s (the nurse) number without seeming like he intended to make her a mistress
When Molly had brought Jim Moriarty over, introducing him as her boyfriend with obvious eyes roaming over Sherlock to look for some sort of reaction, the detective didn’t move
“Are you hurt?” Lestrade asked, his eyes quickly working over her slim figure, hunched shoulders, and the sporting new gash across her forehead that had been neatly cleaned and bandaged by the paramedic, one who had insisted on going to the hospital, only to leave with a frown, mumbling curses under his breath when Sherlock had refused and openly deduced his entire life to the rest of the ambulance
“She was wrong, you know.” Sherlock answered his unasked question as she strolled into the flat, hanging her coat and stripping off the jacket underneath, leaving her in her silk button up shirt that probably cost more than John’s entire outfit combined
It was obvious his excuse was half assed at best, the only reason he cleared the hospital floor and flooded it with the best maternity doctors in all of England was because he was worried about Sherlock, afraid of anything and everything that could possibly go wrong
So I offically gave up on NaNoWriMo, but I plan to start writing fanfic again, if any of y'all watch/like Naruto, Inuyasha, Fruits Basket, or AtLA, I plan to write a few one shots/fics revolving them, tho not sure if I should post them here or just on
Even John, who had spent all that time at war, had seen so much bloodshed and pain, could not have been prepared for this, and he darted his eyes to the floor, cursing god under his breath for allowing something like this to happen, to children who had already had such a hard life as it was.
Groaning softly, he shifted again; only to stop cold as soft head of curls caught the corner of his eye
Someone more like Sherlock, no doubt, Tall, brilliant, breathtaking, and instead they met John, average, everyday bloke John
It was one thing to think about it, but hearing Sherlock say it so casually, and quite loudly, caused a blush to creep up his neck and cover his face
“Hamish.” Sherlock spoke softly, but with purpose, releasing John’s hand to caress the baby’s closed fist with her long index finger
“Aside from my drug abuse, I don’t have much else I am less than comfortable sharing. Should you decide you have a desire to learn more, I’ll answer any questions you may have,” she said, before pausing and pecking a soft kiss to his lips “In exchange you must promise to never bin my experiments while I’m out of the flat”
Sherlock was a bloody good mother most of the time, she was attentive, and the fact she treated their child like she would any adult with a tad bit more affection, he clung to her hip and became just like his mother. John had managed to rough out the whole ‘everyone around me is an idiot’ view, and now their child was a relatively normal one. As normal as any son of Sherlock Holmes could possibly be
“Tell us about yourself, John” he recognized the voice from the earlier gossip and his lip twitched at an awkward attempt at a fake smile, seeing as how the woman basically called him a midget not even 2 minutes ago, he opened his mouth to start, the usual ‘I’m a doctor’ piece he handed off to anyone who asked, when Sherlock beat him to it
Strong hands swept beneath her knees, pulling them up and apart so her back hit the wall behind her, knocking the breath from her lungs as she wrapped her seemingly endless legs around him, his arousal pressed directly against her own, and with a subtle thrust, the friction had them both let out a startled moan
This was to be expected by now, of course, he’d grown so accustomed to Sherlock’s fits of boredom, but never once had it gone this far
He moved, arms snapping up and gripping her forearms hard enough to leave bruises as he switched their positions, pushing her against the wall and crashing his mouth against hers. He swallowed the startled yelp that left her at the sudden movement and twinge of pain she hadn’t expected
It was a quiet day, slow, no new cases and Junior sleeping comfortably in his crib in their room, the silence, while peaceful to John, only allowed her to her own thoughts
The second they entered the hotel room, she cupping his face in her slender hands and kissed him with all she was worth, kicking the hotel door closed with her foot to give them the privacy they needed, but after enduring all that entire ceremony, she wanted nothing more than to strip off her dress and straddle her husband’s lap
The second he came into the flat, stumbling just a bit with the alcohol fogging the edges of his brain, she was on him, pupils completely blown, her lips latching to his neck as her hand palmed at his soft cock through the denim of his jeans, trying to spring it to life on her post case high, needing to channel it into their usual rough and blissful sex, where he would whisper ‘you’re brilliant’ and she’d rattle off poetic nonsense of him being her beam of light in a darkening world
“Hmm” she hummed, a shrug of her shoulders, indifferent to what was a vaguely terrifying experience in his mind
At the thought of Sherlock he panicked, because the idiot had probably spent all night awake, even with the injuries she’d received less than ten days ago she hadn’t been getting the proper amount of rest she needed and he quickly focused on the attacker, ready to take them out and look for his flatmate, only to find her lying on the floor in front of him
She was quiet for a few seconds, blinking at the sudden change in tension of the room, the turn of the conversation
As if reading his mind, she did just that, soft caresses at first, as if she was mapping out his shape through his cotton boxers, even the simple touches made his heart pound, intense in ways a hand job shouldn’t be
“She has always struggled to connect to other people.” He continued and John straightened his posture “and what may come easily to you, she cannot fully understand”
I'm gonna be writing for NaNoWriMo so I'm actually gonna try to get this fanfic posted entirely before then
“God, no!” He sighed, defeated, falling back into his chair across from her and running his uninjured hand over his face in frustration
So no, Sherlock will remain as is, the height difference is adorable regardless of the sex of either party, you gotta admit it, besides, John doesn't seem like the type to be put off by a girls height, afterall, only really insecure guys don't like women taller than them, John is hardly insecure about his masculinity right?
And he found himself wondering exactly how much was in that duplicate Baker St, and what exactly about him did Sherlock find worth remembering?
Married to her work, that much was obvious, now more than ever. Sure, they’d shagged nine ways to Sunday but emotions were never part of that deal, a release of tension and stress, and a completely different kind of high to seek during her fits of boredom, something to occupy her time and mind while he crumbled to bits every time she touched him
“Dr. Watson? You’re ready to be discharged, please sign out at the front desk” Amy came in, giving a bright smile
He stared at her for what felt like forever, unable to move, or speak, or even breath it seemed, too entranced by the sight of Sherlock holding her baby, THEIR baby
“It’s not some…some bloody territorial fight… I’m not angry because he touched what’s mine, I’m angry because he touched you when you didn’t like it”
This was bad, it wasn’t good at all, because now she felt like she was on fire, parts in her starting to melt, ice she didn’t even know was there, was slowly thawing away with John’s warmth, his affection, his very bit of feeling he poured into each movement, and it was overwhelming, she blinked rapidly before squeezing her eyes shut at the unexpected tears building, having no place in what they were doing, yet she was hit with the strongest urge to cry, to weep with either joy or pent up pain
“John!” Lestrade said when he finally reached him, gripping his wrist roughly to keep him from raining down yet another punch, the man’s forearms covering his face in a pathetic attempt to stop the attack “Enough! Christ!”
“I don’t want him here!” Sherlock spat out, pointing her free hand towards the door and speaking through clenched teeth, her eyebrows furrowing as more and more sweat built on her brow
“Sit” he said, and they both did at the edge of the bed, his hand once again cupping her cheek as he leaned in
And the detective turned her eyes back to microscope after a second and mumbled, almost under her breath but loud enough to hear ‘cheater’
With a limp in his step, and the damage etched throughout every line and wrinkle on his face, he knew he didn’t exactly scream ‘great choice’ during first meetings
For almost a minute, he didn’t move, just stared at her, shocked, blinking a few times, unable to fully believe his eyes.
Her focus, her radiant mind, her every bit of what made her, her, made his skin crawl and his blood pump south every time those icy eyes rested on his, a look that spoke of exactly what she had planned that evening
I know it's not Sherlock, but I'm still writing for other fandoms if y'all like my writings, or you can check out my
Sherlock Holmes was a bloody good liar, something that always shocked John whenever he saw it, and he always was left wondering how many of the things they’ve spoken of were simply bent truths, or just flat out fibs
“You’ve been drinking” she half said, half groaned as her hands fisted tightly in his dirty jumper, feeling his teeth digging in in a way that both hurt and yet felt wonderful, excitement pooling in her stomach
This wasn’t something normal, he knew, but he long given up hope of that when living with a mad person, so he just remained silent, lying down next to the couch on the floor, mirroring her position and pressing his fingers together under his chin
“Yes, and the conditions were that I was to not work while pregnant, but seeing as I no longer am, I fully intend to continue my work at Scotland Yard”
Then, came in Mike, oh Mike, an old friend he knew before he even enlisted, the once fit man was now round and jolly, a smile plastered on his face when he greeted John too enthusiastically, reminding the doctor of the kind of man he’d once been
Lestrade cleared his throat, and John looked up, Sherlock tilting her head back on the floor to follow his gaze
So he closed his eyes again, and smiled, walking around the Baker St in his head, even preparing himself imaginary tea
“Oh for heaven’s sake, it’s past midnight!” Ms. Hudson bustled out of her room; a dressing gown tightly wrapped around her figure and her slippers sliding across the flooring as if picking up her feet was too much effort
“It was fairly obvious” Sherlock replied with a fake smile of her own, one that anyone besides John would read as genuine.
No, that was wrong, he couldn’t grow to resent her for his mistakes, after all, he was being foolish. He couldn’t just be some regular bloke and keep sex and love in separate, neat little boxes. One for fun, one for later, when he was ready and well off and with someone who actually shared the same dreams as he did
All in all, it seemed Sherlock, though insist on the oddest and most inappropriate locations, was still very careful about others knowing
His cheeks lit up, and he looked away, coughing to clear his throat and instantly regretting that choice when junior began to cry after jotting awake
He really didn’t want anything like that going on his arrest record, and he was almost certain Mycroft wouldn’t be clearing it the way he had with the spray painting issue
She got to work, skilled digits undoing the buttoning of his jeans and zipper with one hand, the other reaching up to weave into his short hair
Finally, he looked up. And when he saw her, he was visibly stunned; it took him a few seconds to process her image
“Sally’ll take care of it, get back into position” He heard Lestrade say, and John realized he had walked a few feet forward in their direction
She kept her eyes on the DI, deducing his past week –divorce papers filed but not yet sighed, slept in his office the past four days, nicked himself shaving when twitching with too much coffee, here to avoid the pile of cases on his desk- in an attempt to distract herself from John’s face, the pinching of the bridge of his nose between his fingers, the furrowing of his eyebrows, the subtle shaking of his head
“You are already aware of what I am capable of, Dr. Watson” He said, turning to start walking away, his wrist twirling idly to swing his umbrella back and forth “Voicing such matters hardly seems necessary”
He moved in in one smooth motion, planting a tender kiss to her cheek before slipping his mug into the sink
This case, of a sex slave ring which sold almost exclusively children, was already making it’s way under his skin when Sherlock first took a look, and after a week, she managed to nearly take the whole thing apart. But, it would seem, not fast enough, for by the time they and Lestrade’s team brought down the doors to the main warehouse, the operators had decided to dispose of their ‘merchandise’ to keep them from identifying the locations of the other houses and cliental, leaving Scotland Yard to find a room full of corpses with matching bullet holes in their foreheads.
Junior let out a breath, closing his eyes to gather his focus, before opening them and tuning the world out
“Come on, Sally…I’ll… walk you out” John tried hesitantly, glancing at Sherlock as he spoke to check her reaction
She was sorting, putting pieces of information gathered through the case in some special room in her mind palace to look at later, deleting what she found useless
Of course there were mutual guests such as Lestrade, Ms Hudson, and Molly (who she hadn’t be expecting at all, given the poor girls blatant feelings for her), it still was obvious who was the more popular of the two of them
I plan on updating every other Saturday, but since I already finished this story, I'm just gonna update whenever I get a chance to use a computer, since updating on the Ao3 app sucks ass
“Sorry?” John asked as he removed one of the extra blankets from the bed, and making his way towards the small love seat by the door
At a time like this, John knew she just needed a constant, something to anchor her to reality so she didn’t drift into the dark places of her mind, places that may trigger some memories of needles breaking flesh
“You’ve repeatedly glanced my way 4 times every minute for the past half hour” She sighed, straightening in her seat and turning her gaze on him “It’s distracting”
Danger nights. Mycroft had warned him about them, through a text, usually, or a well timed phone call, letting him know a specific day, hour, or even minute of risk, making sure the doctor kept his little sister from O.D.ing seemed like Mycroft’s main use for John, not that he minded, he’d do anything to keep Sherlock sober. He just never noticed these days, Sherlock was always her usual self, overly confident with a god complex; her mouth laced with silver and misdirected boredom being shot at unsuspecting strangers. She didn’t seem to be any different at all
She waited patiently, rare enough, standing in the middle of the room by the body until she had everyone’s attention
She leaned forward, and he did the same, their foreheads touching slightly “There is no risk of me falling into old habits, but if you still need reassurance…” she plucked her one strand of her hair, holding it out to him “I have been clean for six and a half years, a standard test should confirm that. I have much more to lose now than a hand full of pounds and my brothers ‘respect’. Though the draw is still there, as it will always be, I hear, I will not falter in my sobriety”
His musing ended, though, when he crossed the path of the hallway into his room, and on his bed, rather neatly folded, was a cardigan, a deep and rich blue, matching almost the color of his eyes, and his hands wandering over the fabric showed it’s high quality, something that must have cost a fortune
He paid close attention to the task at hand, since each woman was different, he wanted to make sure he got Sherlock just right, knowing what made her breathy sighs turn into deep moans, what made her legs tighten around his face and her hips tremble with pleasure
“Hmmm” He hummed in response, pressing his face against her neck and lightly biting, sucking on smooth and flawless skin in hopes of leaving a mark on the pretty pale flesh, a little reminder that this night was real, so when he woke up, he’d know it wasn’t just another dream
Nausea, headache, and randomly swelling feet had not put her in the best of moods, and the last thing she needed was her brother poking into her most private affairs. Even he had never crossed the line of discussing her sexual choices, a wall between siblings that he was reasonable enough to respect
He returned with crisps, handing her the can of whip cream and wrinkling his nose in disgust as she emptied it into the bag and began to eat
If it was up to her, she’d just sighed a marriage license, no hassle, no guests, or church, or ridiculous looking attires. Just her and John, as it should be.
“Will you shut up?!” Sherlock barked, turning abruptly in her couched position to give Donovan and Watson her death glare
He brought the makeshift sandwich and pad to the couch, placing the plate down onto the wooden coffee table
A heavy sigh and a hand through his hair showed Sherlock just how frustrated with her John was already becoming, and she feared the conversation she was dreading was at hand
And there they were, her having the damn nerve to look completely put upon by his emotional state, as if the only thing on her mind was getting off and his distress wasn’t helping her arousal
I'm updating rn cause NaNoWriMo is going on, and I'm trying to figure out my story while also somehow writing it, it's a very stressful situation..
She glanced down at where he gestured, her eyes immediately falling to the small litter of scars on the crock of her elbow, if not for their location they’d look like nothing more than marks often left behind after a nasty case of the chicken pox
She laughed, LAUGHED, and he was struck with both the desire to kick her out of his bed, and lay her down and unwrap her on it
He took the rare opportunity to watch her, the subtle movements of her eyelids as she dreamed, the rise and fall of her back with every deep and even breath, her slightly parted lips looking surprisingly pink against the pale sheets of his hospital bed.
From across the room, the sound of a beep made itself known, and Sherlock held out her hand, expectantly
He froze, squinting his eyes and moving his left hand to look at the piece of jewelry, “Well, I know that bit, Sherlock” he said, still not grasping what she meant
Sherlock rolled out of bed lazily; as if moving at all required an extreme amount of energy she couldn’t be bothered to sum it up. Slipping off the bed, she slipped her shoes on, making quite a show on how put upon she was by the whole process which both John and Mycroft ignored.
“Still got that tongue on ya, huh? Thought you’d take care of that by now, mate” the man laughed, nudging John with his elbow and the doctor let out an uncomfortable laugh
He hated the idea of her not seeing him as anything more than a loyal dog to call upon, or a release of tension, but even if she did, he knew it wouldn’t change anything, it would hurt, and hell it already did just wondering, but he couldn’t see himself loving her any less, the feelings that wormed their way into his heart were taking root, and he was too far gone to turn back now
But nowhere near what it used to be, what was comfortable before was now awkward and thick, deafening and pulling at her heart in ways she didn’t know were possible
Most of the guests were John’s additional invites, even extending a hand towards some of the less obnoxious Yarders who sat and looked rather out of place
Birth control was never something she regularly practiced, and the pullout method was hardly scientific; combined with her high fertility inherited from her grandmother, who had 12 kids of her own.
“You’re…. okay with this…?” He asked, hesitating, as if the second he allowed himself to relax, Mycroft would strike with armed forces
“Mycroft” she wrinkled her nose, not bothering to move an inch even as footsteps could be heard climbing the stairs to her flat and her landlady’s voice cut through the door
The second their door closed in their flat, or even pushed up against the hallway leading towards their door, they went at it. Lips roaming, hands grasping at whatever they made contact with, each swallowing the other’s breath, their moans; their hearts
“I wasn’t worried, Sherlock” he said softly, his fingers tracing down her skin to weave their hands together “I just wanted to feel closer to you. After finding out about Victor…I guess I just realized I don’t know anything about your past, and you knew mine within seconds of meeting me”
They explored more and more flesh as the clothing slowly stripped, his shirt, hers and her bra, his fingers hooking through her belt loops of her trousers and pulling to reveal endless expands of milky thighs and surprisingly feminine knickers of white cotton
“She didn’t seem like the type” Molly said absentmindedly, before blushing “O-Oh! No! I didn’t mean a lesbian, not that there’s nothing wrong with that, and you can’t really tell, now can you? Since people can be… I-I meant, just, about relationships, I didn’t think she was interested in that kind of thing” she stumbled over her words, though John didn’t draw attention to it
Words were being screamed out by the suspect, important no doubt, but for the life of him John couldn’t bring himself to pay attention, only focused on the immediate danger at hand, and Sherlock’s body pressed to his chest
Reaching for the coffee table, he retrieved the remote, and allowed the flood of relief her words brought forth
Hushed, poorly concealed ‘whispers’ could be heard as they approached the dinning room, and the doctor set his jaw at the comments obviously about him
She supposed it was to be expected. After all, condoms weren’t always available during some of their heated moments and it hardly slowed either down, John too caught up in the moment and the thrill of going unprotected sending chills up her spine, giving it an extra edge that always brought her off sooner, a danger they both seemed attracted to
“No” Sally’s voice was strong, having grown tougher in the years that’d passed, though her eyes held no glimpse of the hatred they once did when she looked at Sherlock
“Using one’s own heightened skills of observation achieved through years of discipline is hardly cheating, John”
“You shouldn’t believe any words spoken by people with a motive against me” she sighed, leaning forward a bit more and resting her forehead against his shoulder “Regardless of how others perceive us, surely you know how much worth you hold.” He felt her brows furrow, but he didn’t speak
“Sherlock…” he breathed into the coarse hair tickling his nose, musky, and earthy, and just so SHERLOCK, a scent he never could find, the under layer hidden beneath her hair products and deodorant, pure and comforting and HOME
She didn’t reply, simply draped her arm over her eyes to display just how eager she was to talk to him, how much his opinion mattered
He figured that out on his own, from the very first week they spent as flatmates, he knew she couldn’t get on with people, even displaying complete lack of effort, it wasn’t that she didn’t bother to try, it was she didn’t know how to go about it, so instead, she lashed out, and pretended she didn’t care for the world and others around her.
“John was providing training in self defense” Sherlock spoke when the doctor seemed incapable, not bothering to lift herself off the floor, only roll onto her stomach and propping herself onto her elbows
One heel had broken during the commotion, and she had tossed both it and it’s pair into the streets and left them there, leaving John to carry her into the cab to avoid having her step on anything dangerous
She stared at him for a few seconds, as if trying to understand something, before clearing her throat. “Yes. Um, very well, we’ll depart for my parent’s estate come morning” with that she walked towards her room, and shut the door behind her
“Yeah” he braced his hands on the hard floor and she leaned back as he sat up, rolling his shoulders back and wincing at the pops that followed the movement
When he opened the door he was greeted with the usual sight, Sherlock lying across the sofa, reading over a file and not bothering to look up to acknowledge him
“It was too…” she paused, staring at the microscope in front of her as her hair fell over her shoulders and into her face “Loud” she finished
It wasn’t as if John had never been cross with her, but now he had a new way of expressing his anger, letting out his frustration, and she rather liked it, the underline desperation of his movements like he had an uncontrollable need to claim her, to take her over and over until his anxiety faded
So he approached, heading towards the end of the couch were her feet reached to the other arm, noting that if it were he sprawled out about it, his legs wouldn’t take up the whole thing
“Here” he said, helping Sherlock move up slightly to press the warm pad to her lower back, “that should help the muscle pain” with that, he sat on the floor by her head, leaning back against the armrest, ignoring her obvious stare
That put her uneasy nerves to rest, not fully understanding why the idea of John and Donovan made her skin almost crawl
Because Sherlock bloody Holmes was NOT feeling him up for her own enjoyment, she certainly WASN’T trying to cover him in gooseflesh as his stubborn cock twitched with every light feel of nails
“She’s separated…” John offered with a furrow of his brows, turning back towards April with a questioning look
She froze in an instant, though; her body growing ridged and she lowered the violin, turning to face him, her face a controlled blank
She simply wiped her lips with the back of her hand, walked off, and locked herself in her bedroom, leaving him flustered, confused, and oh so turned on, having to make an awkward walk up to his bedroom to take care of the problem himself
“You okay…?” He asked, his voice strained around the edges and he buried himself as deeply as he could inside her, feeling her walls clench around him, and though he was no stranger to the sensation, he could have sworn it felt like his first time all over again
Adjusting her body slightly, she lifted, sinking back down and giving a groan at the feelings washing over her, repeating the action again and again; building a steady rhythm
John shut his mouth, letting out a deep breath and letting that comment go. Of course Sherlock didn’t believe in love, not with how dysfunctional her home life seemed to be, and the closest resemblance to family affection is Mycroft bugging the flat and worming into her life every way he could manage, love seemed like a far off concept
Sally’s hands immediately went to where his were moments before, tightening and pulling Sherlock a fraction of a step closer to her, laying claim, which John was grateful for in ways he couldn’t put into words
Her muscles flexed around him and he swore he saw stars, his self control giving away as he thrusts became rougher, harder, faster, and soon he was pounding into her, her name falling from his lips like worship and she dug her nails into the backs of his hands
“Maybe you should go home for the day” Lestrade suggested, his eyes looking towards the mess Sherlock made so close to the body with a look of poorly veiled disgust “The Flu’s been going around recently”
“Whoo hoo” Ms. Hudson entered, smiling brightly while holding what could only be loads of food Sherlock probably would have to be forced to eat “Hope we’re not interrupting”
“He’ll be fine.” She replied, purposely using her know-it-all tone to give John some comfort, if she was confident in something, he should be too “The constant movement gives it away”
“Who’s the father?!” Sally asked, complete shock written all over her face, gaping as if the fact someone actually wanted to be with Sherlock was completely ludicrous. If he hadn’t been so stunned himself, John would’ve found her reaction insulting
“I know plenty of people who would disagree with that statement” Sherlock replied, rolling her perfectly lined eyes
“Has he finally gotten old enough to follow you onto cases?” Lestrade asked, turning towards them as they entered the building
Ridiculous, thinking that a bra and HIS boxers were what she considered appropriate attire to parade around in in front of her male flatmate
She cursed her own stupidity on the matter, a complete disregard for the consequences of her actions, though it was hardly outside of her character
“Trapping you like that. It’s so petty, but I guess I should’ve expected it, seems right up her alley, now, looking back.”
She sighed again, leaning back slightly in her chair to rest a single hand over the growing swell of her stomach, cursing slightly how NOTHING of either hers nor John’s worked to cover her skin completely, and it wasn’t as if she was about to something as mundane as shopping for maturity clothing. The peek of pale skin from her pajama bottoms and
A shaking of her head allowed her hair to whip around, adding even more volume to it after an hour of vigorous sex, she knew her hair was as wild and suggestive as ever, giving her the effect she was going for
After almost a minute of heavy breathing he pushed back once again, refusing to look at her as he stomped his way up the stairs and slammed the door shut behind him
“Shut up” he replied, handing the address to the taxi driver looking at them oddly from within the review mirror before they were off
He swapped his usual clothes for a tight gray v neck shirt that showed off his muscles, straight legged dark blue jeans and a black leather jacket to top it all off
John stole quick glances from over the top of his paper, before burying his suntanned face in it, trying so damn hard to focus on the tiny printed letters and not his half naked genius of a flatmate
“And whether she will admit to it or not, they are so much more to Sherlock than she would have you believe. So I will entrust you with her safety on this as well…”
Sherlock Holmes didn’t like not knowing things. Secrets, puzzles, she’d go at them with every bit of relevant information she held in that magnificent brain of hers, stripping it all apart for new information that may be useful, dismissing all she didn’t care for. If anything held an air of mystery, like his middle name, she’d pull out all the stops in satisfying her curiosity, and it was almost compulsive, like an addictive need to know anything and everything
“Erm, May I?” She asked hesitantly, as if expecting Sherlock to reject her, not as if she didn’t have the right to, anyway
“Your dilated pupils and increase respiratory rate are marks of arousal. You really should be more honest of your attraction to me, however disgusting and unwanted it may be” Sherlock rolled her eyes, turning towards Lestrade before the forensic analysis could reply
The woman, April, played a little with what remained of her salad, her candy apple eyes dancing along the plate before coming to meet John’s
Once back in a comforting tank top and pajama bottoms, she reemerged from her room, tying her hair in a loose ponytail to keep it in place
He didn’t continue speaking, instead waving a vague hand towards her arm, where the long day of studying and working with materials, she had rolled up the sleeves to her silk shirt, pushing them up and exposing the expands of her skin
“I do everything with this hand” he explained, raising it to show her what he meant “so every time I do something, I feel it, and a lot of times the band will move. It’s not conscious anymore but I’m checking to see if it’s still there, because I want to make sure it doesn’t fall off my finger and I lose it”
“The Work is very physically demanding, yet I have not seen you attempt to keep your muscle mass. It requires effort that you didn’t seem to have put in, I was simply checking for myself if you were in adequate shape to continue being of use to me, since you have that tedious habit of leaving the shower fully clothed, and there is only so much I can see under those hideous jumpers”
Looking back, it probably would’ve been a better idea to tell him somewhere else, somewhere more…romantic. And while the delivery of the news didn’t seem to matter much to her, she wished she would’ve taken into consideration John’s draw towards sentiment. In her defense, though, it wasn’t exactly a planned event, just a statement of facts to not stir commotion at a crime scene and seemingly having the opposite effect (honestly, emotions were NOT her area), either way, she regretted it.
As if having a son born from their actions would change anything, she would suddenly realize she had a heart, she wanted something outside of endless puzzles of mutilated bodies
“What happened?” He asked, the hand over hers tightening while the other moved up to weave into her curls
“Nothing new” John sighed, punching the pillows to try and soften them as he slipped off his slippers and tried to get comfortable on the narrow space the sofa provided
She needed to think, find a way to compromise; offer what John thinks he needs and what she’s willing to give
“Christ, Sherlock!” He groaned when she gave a roll of her hips, planting pale hands on his freckled chest, tracing their patterns absently, already making future plans to map them out and remember each and every one
Finally, his tongue traced her bottom lip, dipping in to play with hers in a way that felt sweeter than anything, and of all the lovers of the past, she never felt something quite like it
“Lestrade has to stop calling us in for child’s play” she complained, flinging the cloth back at him and dramatically dropping onto the sofa, one foot held up in the air “my feet won’t recover from this”
And she couldn’t wrap her mind around the thought that this man, the man that could have her anyway, anywhere, however he wanted, chose this, soft, slow kissing that was as teasing as it was loving, something no one had ever bothered to do before, expressing emotions and feelings she never thought would be directed at her
The silence that hung through the air was deafening, but Sherlock didn’t seem to notice, just fell quiet and waited for the information to process
He held up his hand, stopping her, knowing full well what the man could have done to Sherlock while she was tied up, and nodded, seeing her point, “Alright” he said, “We’ll have to take it easy because of your injuries but I’ll do what I can”
“Thank heavens, I can barely handle my family in my regular state, like this” she weaved a hand down at herself “If you thought our first trip was bad…”
“I’m glad no one saw that” he said quietly, his eyes focused on some unnamed point across the pools reflection.
“Don’t think she notices me much, though. Just the girl who sneaks her in” Molly said, her tone light and accepting, before flushing again “Oh, sorry! That sounds really…”
Maybe one day, the work would lose it’s appeal, and running around London with Sherlock wouldn’t seem so grand, then he could settle down with a nice girl, have a child, or two or three, and live a comfortable, peaceful existence, but that day wasn’t today, nor did it seem to be in the immediate future
“If you're thinking about starting a relationship with her, keep in mind she prefers men who are already married.” Her lips pulled slightly downwards at the corners “Though I suppose she sees you as unavailable due to our current arrangement” vague gesture between them, like the air there spoke for her “Perhaps that works in your favor”
It was bad enough that he was sharing a flat with a woman, or that half of London already thought they were shagging by ‘reading in between the lines’ of his blog updates, but if she texted, phoned, or just outright walked in on his dates when she felt like it, hell, he was never going to get laid
“J-John…” He cleared his throat, attempting to keep it from the squeak it was turning into “John is fine…”
John opened his eyes and was met with vague early morning light, somewhat darkened and musky by the sharp draw of curtains and air thick with dust.
She laid there, with one pale arm draped over her eyes, the other still clutching her weapon hung loosely to the side. What was normally covered by a striped blue dressing gown and too short pajama pants was bare, the pale expands of her long, a bit too thin torso in direct line with John’s all too greedy eyes, practically singing to him to allow his gaze to wonder over her beautifully lean body. The only clothing to hide her modesty was a pair of boxer shorts (His, which seemed to shock him more the sight with the sheer intimacy of it) and a pale pink bra to house her small and humble chest
After waking him one random night from a rather nasty nightmare a few months into their friendship with the sound of rather sorrowful music at 2am, it became a bit more of a regular occurrence. Gradually, as if she was easing him into it, or perhaps herself, and it wasn’t until a few weeks after that did she continue the play upon him entering the room, no longer stopping to put it away, and slowly he won the rights to concerts in the sitting room, a cuppa in his hand and no longer bothering with a book he pretended to read, he’d just watched, as she moved to the rhythm, her body swaying like rivers at times or tensely straight with violent thrusts of her bow as sweat built on her brow. Just like the work, it seemed, whenever she played, she gave it her all, and it was break-taking to watch
“Yes, fine, fine…” Sherlock answered with a dismissive wave of her hand, though the lie fell flat when she turned abruptly, facing as much away from the body as she could manage and expelling the toast and tea John had forced her to eat that morning onto the cold floor
The restaurant in question was bright, full and surprisingly quiet for such a crowded business. The air was full of class and judgment found in those with well-lined wallets. High-class silverware lined expensive tableclothes, and a scan of the place revealed their intended target and John.
“Calm down” John sighed, pulling the coffee table a bit closer to sit on the edge, taking Sherlock’s right slender foot into his hand
Dozens of cold showers and bleeding lips later, he still found himself digging his blunt fingers into his good leg to distract himself whenever she decided clothing wasn’t necessary or that personal space, even two different genders, didn’t apply to her
“Alright? Are you alright?” she asked, yanking the explosives from his body and sliding it across the tiled floor
It's smut but it's also short because I had planned to write more and now I have writer's block so I can't fill it in, sorry
“Last night, after you accepted my proposal, that takes care of immediate family, including your sister”
“It kinda is” he laughed, gesturing to the mess of his and her wedding attire tossed about the hotel room floor, the sheets tangled and sweaty underneath them
John nodded his head towards the door when Sherlock squeezed her eyes shut at the next contraction, a subtle gesture, but firm in it’s own way, a request that wasn’t to be ignored
Her fingers worked their way into the plaid button up he wore, touching the strong core with a hint of softness, hardened muscles and a layer of plush from one too many biscuits with his tea
“What made you change your mind? About sex, I mean” he asked after another long moment of silence, and she removed her hand from under his, running a line up and down his chest with her fingers, tracing the line between his abs and pectorals
“The wire, tedious as it was to hide under this” she waved down at herself “Is fully functioning and in place. John has already arranged reservations and selected the seat closest to the subject without arousing suspicion. I will be joining him shortly.”
He made himself comfortable in his usual armchair, watching the detective sway back and forth, her eyes closed, the smile having never left her lips and she played and played, adding bits and pieces there, until it became an entirely different piece all together, and she composed a masterpiece right before his eyes
“Good” she replied, standing and heading towards the kitchen to her bedroom to hide her embarrassment “I’ll go check on our son”
Lestrade nodded and she was off, becoming more annoyed with her outfit with every clack of her heels
“You want a divorce?” the panic, though poorly hidden (stupid John, assuming he could hide anything from her) was so obvious in his tone that her heart wrenched
Sherlock Holmes was a gorgeous woman, and in all honesty, John always felt a small swell of pride whenever people asked him how long they’d been together, but always, he quickly squashed the feeling, because, it wasn’t his to have, right? He couldn’t be happy that people thought someone like Sherlock would go for someone like him, because it hardly seemed fair to her
“Won’t leave you alone then?” Sally asked, peering over John’s shoulder as he read the most recent texts received, his phone chiming every other minute as while he was at the crime scene, taking in and writing down as much details as he could to bring home to Sherlock
He had nothing to hide from the older Holmes, though, like the man said, he wore his heart on his sleeve, his emotions left bare for the world to see, his intentions as clear as day.
“Bloody…” the pads of his thumbs flickered over her nipples before moving his hands down to rest on her lean waist “brilliant”
John hunched his broad shoulders, sinking deeper into his chair, praying to any deity that was listening to just let the earth open up and swallow him whole
It was going perfect, all well, John stepping in rhythm, nothing too fancy to attract attention or too stiff to be noticed, and Sherlock staying close to Sally, dancing face to face with her, both of them falling into character easily
“Come on, now. You show interest in other women and suddenly she’s pregnant? I wouldn’t be surprised if she was lying about the whole thing.”
She didn’t want to grow to resent their child, to see John Jr. as something holding her back instead of the family he was
John was a soldier, a doctor, a healer and protector, and there was no way on earth he'd ever let that man touch Sherlock. He swore he’d guard her with his life, watch over her in every way possible, and if that meant pulling her back when she wondered a bit too close, locking her away when she wanted nothing more than to play the man’s sick games, if it meant making her regret and hate the day she met John, then so be it
“It’s not an unfounded observation, if you chose better men, it is a possibility. You aren’t the most incompetent member of your team, and have proven on more than one occasion to be of above average intelligence”
She looked his way from where she was straddling the man’s back and smiled, and in that moment he felt such hot white fury built in him because how DARE she grin? How dare she do that to him? Risk her life for the sake of closing a case.
“You’re aware of what I’m referring to, emotions may not be my area, but I am capable of reading yours” she said, “I know you well enough for that.”
“She’s also the one that gave you that obvious hickey after we talked, then?” she scoffed, shaking her head “I knew she was childish, but it’s going a bit far. Marking her property like she’s telling others not to play with her toys”
“The first year is one of the most crucial, you can’t just leave him in a crib while you run off to god knows where”
“No…I…I don’t want to know what you did when you were high” he said slowly, and Sherlock could see he was choosing his words carefully “I just wanted to know…to understand…why you started…”
She merely rolled her eyes for what felt like the hundredth time that night. “I was in control of the situation at hand. Waiting for reinforcements was not an option, we were out of time”
Was that everything y'all hoped for? I hope so, I write smut a lil poetic I've been told and some ppl don't like it, but I hope y'all did
She sat up, like she hadn’t expected him to agree so quickly, the corners of her mouth pulling down slightly
Lazily, she pulled on his boxers from their place on the floor, grabbing his horrid plaid button up and only bothering with the center three buttons, leaving the top and bottom ones undone in a way that made her look wonderfully unraveled
“Well” Molly sighed, tucking a loose strand behind her ear, her eyes moving back to the now long closed doors of the morgue with a pining kind of awe, as if she could still see Sherlock, “Her work is very lucky”
“Ugh!” Another fling of her arms, sending the hammer off to the side, skittering wildly before thumping against the wall, leaving a dent Ms. Hudson was sure to notice later
John snorted at that, to which Sherlock smirked, the tension in her shoulders dropping a fraction “My thoughts exactly. Though I back then, as embarrassing as it is to admit, admired my brother, and agreed to start in order to please him. As it turned out I had a natural talent, and soon surpassed his level”
“I’ve already told you why! My family is insufferable when it comes to my relationship status, as if the lack of husband at my age is the worst possible thing to bestow on the Holmes’ family”
She moved, propping herself on her elbow to get a better view of his face “Why do you wish to know?”
He already knew the decision Sherlock had come to, it seemed; he probably knew the answer even before she spent hours analyzing every possible scenario and choice she could make on the matter
He couldn’t correct him, tell him he loved her, every piece, every flaw and mistake and scar on her arms, that he would never be swayed, because, though an unfounded fear, he was afraid Sherlock would somehow find out, deduce that those words were uttered, that what appeared to be casual sex was so much more to him, that each time he held her to him, against him, possessing her the way others couldn’t, the warmth that spread throughout his body had nothing to do with what they were doing
His fingers eagerly explored their fabric and a swell of pride filled his chest to feel how aroused she was becoming, before hooking to the band and pulling softly, hesitant and uncertain of how far she was willing to allow him
His heart began to pound when her lips parted just slightly, the plump bottom flesh pulling away from a perfect cupid’s bow, a sliver of pink darting in between, a quick, subtle slide of her tongue to moisten her lips, and John’s eyes dropping to her mouth before flickering back up to meet her gaze, surprised to find she left her emotions completely bare, eyes giving away everything for once with no defensive glimmer in sight.
Even though being physical with Sherlock was mind blowing, amazing, the most fantastic sex he’d ever had, something he loved so very much, he knew deep down that if she didn’t want it, if she was only interested in what they were doing, soft cuddling, light kisses, sharing stories of pasts and running around London catching bad guys, he’d be okay with that. Because he was lucky enough to call this mad, crazed, unbelievable genius his, his wife, his partner, his whole damn world
Looking back, he realized it was at that very moment she seemed to capture all his attention, like the world had narrowed, tunneling his vision to the beautiful, tall genius. It wasn’t until much later did he realize just how much that Sherlock Holmes managed to take from him that day
Later that night, once they arrived home, Sherlock made her way towards her violin, dabbing down a bunch of notes before picking up the instrument and repeating the main theme of the play by what John assumes was entirely ear
Hands placed on the porcelain sink of the yard’s bathroom; she stared at her own reflection in the well-worn mirror.
Gradually, it became more frequent, and whenever his hands weren’t occupied, he’d twirl the piece of jewelry, over and over and over. It was distracting, and, God help her, worrying
John beat her to it, handing it back with the soft smile he used whenever dealing with a jumpy patient
So when John lied in bed in his after sex bliss, the post orgasmic coma he seemed to slip into every time, she untangled herself from within his arms and removed herself from the bed at the sound of a familiar car pulling up to Baker St
“As I expressed once before, John, you’re unique, a rare individual I hold to a higher esteem than the rest of the population, a conductor of light, and I couldn’t continue the Work as well as I do now were it not for you”
He’d gone straight for a pub right then, ignoring his muddied pants and shoes, his caked on hair and stained jumper; he just really, really needed a drink
Their gazes locked, and both broke out in insane giggles, half smoothing them with their hands but failing to keep it down
Immediate flush of cheeks, eyes darting off to the side, arms crossing in a defensive posture. He was embarrassed by being caught, Sherlock noticed, though it wasn’t like she cared. Feeling his eyes on her made it difficult to ignore his presence, as if the doctor was radiating warmth, shining a bright neon sign that screamed 'I’M HERE PAY ATTENTION TO ME'
Their worst one had gone away, apparently losing interest in Sherlock when she developed a taste for ‘ordinary’ and she was no longer fun in Moriarty’s eyes, John was grateful to the madman for his short attention span. Moriaty never made any effort to contact either of them once Sherlock had gotten pregnant.
“I don’t see the point, nor the lure. I repeated the experiment with several different types of men, as well as women, the result was the same. It’s not something I find necessary, all the rutting and rather barbaric feel of it” she waved her hand through the air, as if dismissing memories of her past experiences “it drives on sentiment and is the primary reason most people commit murder.”
“Of course.” She responded, turning back towards Ms. Hudson and extending her arm to allow her landlady to better adjust the white lace sleeve “I am Sherlock Holmes after all”
“Your word against my own, I wonder whom John will believe” she chimed in, sounding much more smug than necessary
“This is as ‘all out’ as I’m capable of.” She said, gesturing down at the figure flattering lace dress,  simple yet with a calming and gentle complexity in it’s design, something fitting of John, she thought, more than her. He’d enjoy it
He hung his jacket, and she shrugged off hers, the steady raise and fall of her chest slowly slowing, along with the burning itch that seemed to rise every time they were in a particularly dangerous case
The way the two women interacted, he sometimes wondered if he should look away from the sparks in their gazes and the obvious tension so thick he could cut it
“Of course” Sherlock replied, eyes roaming judgmentally over the crowd of small children, all laughing and screaming and being so agonizingly ordinary at the first day of school
There would always be times were their roles were reversed, and she was the to protect him, even something as seemingly small as this
“When I took it…the world was quite, and every damn little detail about a person didn’t scream for attention”
His heart skipped a beat as he was carried away from Sherlock to be cleaned and immediately brought back, and Sherlock opened her arms to accept him graciously
The detective didn’t open her eyes from where she was sprawled about the couch, merely let out a soft sigh
He blinked at that, and she could see all the assumptions and scenarios playing through his head, read it in the far off look in his eyes and the slight tension finding it’s way in his stance
“I didn’t always have the Work.” She continued after a short pause “before, there was nothing I could do to silence my mind. I never understood how Mycroft managed to handle all the noise” she made a frustrated sound, and his soothing hand continued it’s course, weaving strong fingers through her locks in a way he knew she found relaxing
She stepped forward and placed her hands firmly on his shoulders, holding to keep him from shrugging her off
“All the planning, wasted, because you couldn’t keep a leveled head” she continued, shaking her head “You have to keep your emotions under control, John, or it may cost us more than a case”
He looked at her, but didn’t say anything, cut off by the sound of the computer beeping its result, and he turned to that instead of the truth in her words, and the meaning they held for Molly
“Sherlock…” He breathed, slipping his hands into hers, intertwining their fingers. Her legs wrapped around his body, heels digging into his lower back but he kept the same agonizingly slow pace, moving so slowly, teasingly, until she was writhing underneath him, panting and on the verge of begging
But, of course, John, being as sentimental and surprisingly average at times, wanted something traditional, with the tux, and the dress, and the photographer capturing every awkward and forced moment; with food, and family, and ‘friends’; crowds of people, loud and obnoxious, and everything she dreaded in life topped with a lacy bow.
“Your relationship with Sherlock has had…an interesting development” He paced evenly, back and forth with two even steps each time, umbrella taping the dirtied floor of the abandoned warehouse
Of course Molly’s outburst after Jim had left was proof that he hadn’t, and Sherlock, being Sherlock, cruelly deduced why the man was unfaithful, ending with having been left his number, which Molly turned bright pink to and actually stormed out of the morgue
Naturally, he jumped at the chance to meet with the ‘Sherlock’ Mike went on about; happy to discuss living arrangements. At least, this way, he could stay in London. As long this Sherlock didn’t kill people, or had a habit of bring women (or men, whichever he preferred) home at odd hours, he was as good a flatmate as anyone in his book.
“Who taught you?” He asked one day as she swayed in front of the window, the sleek instrument held gingerly in her hand, her chin propped on the rest. The melody of the day was something peaceful, lazy almost, like film music played during happy moments, not overpowering but something enjoyed nonetheless, touching the room with a feel of ease
Beware that the chapters start to get kinda short as the story progresses but there will be a lot more before the story ends
I'm ignoring NaNoWriMo cause it's been to days and I got 1k written barely, but y'all can read what I have so far if you're interested, message me on my
He was tall, taller than her in her heels which was rare enough as is, closer to 6’4”, a pale bloke with bleach blonde hair slicked back and sunglasses hiding his eyes, as if it was bright enough to need them in the darkened lighting of the club
The room grew quiet, and she paused for a second, before lifting the instrument again, tucking it under her chin and closing her eyes
John, after hours of temper tantrums and daylong sulks, finally managed to convince her of continuing the work from the comfort of their flat. He’d video chat, send photos, and write down detailed descriptions of the crime scene for Sherlock to inspect without lifting a finger
“Well, that’s just bloody perfect” John mumbled under his breath as they approached the doors, and Sherlock seemed unsurprised by the noise flittering through
It wasn’t just in between cases, and those moments seemed to scare him the most. Because he could never predict when Sherlock would push him into the nearest secluded place and have at it, condoms tucked away in her trench coat pockets for easy access. In the lab, at the Yard, or even some poor bloke’s apartment during a sweep of the murder scene, whenever, wherever, Sherlock got her way
had an eruption of butterflies dancing in her stomach that had no business being there, her heart pounding with almost uncontrolled emotions was very much
But no, she didn’t move, just smirked around his shaft and sucked, because she enjoyed this, unraveling him, turning him into a puddle of want and need, and turning off his other senses until he could only chant her name through his orgasm
“What? God, no Sherlock, no” he shook his head, his face flushing slightly at his body’s obvious disproval of him turning her offer down
And after that first night, it seemed like the focus that once was left to rot away with boredom between cases was instead switched to John with a fiery intensity
He couldn’t argue with that, that lust and jealousy could drive people to do insane things, but at its core, he couldn’t see sex as anything but beautiful, if done the right way
More like it (mostly of different shows) can be found on my DeviantArt, in which I go by the same name
“Not a single case in a week! A week, John! You'd think murders would be more creative!” She punctured each sentence with a groan, breathing in deeply, before launching up, like a string attached to her was pulled taut, and she turned her head to look straight at him
He had her, up against the wall, strong hands on lean thighs, hot lips on plump ones, a growing arousal pressed against her, one she felt and noticed a few times prior, but never this way, where it’s size and need radiated off it in waves, completely unguarded and twitching with promise of where their activities could lead them
Seems like he wasn’t much for imagination, or that if any place was to house his memories and life for the past few months Baker St was as good as any
But he never actually had time to stop and think: why? Why was it so important to constantly make it known ‘we’re not a couple’ ‘I’m not her date’ ‘she’s not my girlfriend’?
I'm probably gonna be posting my story on a different platform, but maybe here as well, if y'all are interested in reading my original work
“Sod the case, Sherlock, you already know who is selling the drugs and how, Lestrade doesn’t need to make an arrest for you to be satisfied with that, you solved your puzzle”
“Information on you” she replied casually, moving to lie back down on the sofa and closing her eyes again like it was totally normal to tell your flatmate you had an entire flat in your mind dedicated to information you’ve collected on them
He woke again a few hours later to the feeling of eyes on him, so intense his body covered with gooseflesh
“He…” John paused, going over her words again in his mind to make sure he understood correctly “He dumped you because you didn’t want to sleep with him?”
Still, even as much as she loved when he worried about her, it didn’t make dealing with how cranked up it had become over the last few months
After all, they cut back the more dangerous jobs when Junior was born, made sure Mycroft kept a good eye on Baker St and they didn’t make any high profile enemies again
“She does you…” Molly paused, worrying her bottom lip between her teeth as if debating whether or not to continue. “…And that woman, the one with the smashed up face?” she finished after a pause
“Shit” John mumbled his curse, furrowing his brow before resting it against her chin, and she bent down slightly to meet his lips, kissing him for all she was worth as the telltale signs of his climax began to show, his slight tremble, his quickening breath, his tightening fingers
“My personal feelings on the matter are hardly important. Who my sister chooses as her partner is entirely up to her. And you seem as good a candidate as any” he said, his all seeing gaze ranking up and down his figure, and John knew he was stripping apart his life story just as Sherlock was so fond of doing, peeling back layers and leaving him exposed
“Mycroft will be by to pick you up after school” John said, kneeling down to fix Junior’s school tie “No deleting information you find irrelevant without first asking me, not your mother, no deducing or insulting the other children, remember that people aren’t here for your entertainment, and even physical games can be fun”
“Alright” John replied, slowly rising from the bed and giving Amy, who looked at the two of them with a baffled expression, a final goodbye before making his way out of the
It didn’t matter that he was once a solider, was still a doctor, that he’s killed people and spends his evenings chasing down criminals in the depths of London, at first glance he was nothing more than a short man in a knit jumper
“You were welcome to begin without me,” she answered, heading towards an area where two seats were free, across another empty as Mycroft moved to occupy it
There was no room for him to sit, as if she made sure of it every time she dominated the sofa. Deciding to take the risk, he simply reached down and lifted her legs by the fabric of her trousers, smiling softly at the widening of her eyes in surprise, the contact snapping her out of her own thoughts. He sat himself down, before replacing her legs upon his lap, reaching for the control to turn on the telly
He settled against her, yawning softly. The tuffs of dark black hair and pale skin reminded John so much of Sherlock, and he covered his mouth with his free hand to choke back the sob that threatened to leave him
No joke, I totally forgot about this story and updating, only recently that I started networking did I remember I have a following here, so here's chapter 32, only a handful more to go
“Mycroft” she wrinkled her nose in disgust at the use of her brother’s name at a time like this “Had me tested every week during…” her voice trailed off, and John’s hands shifted from her breasts to her elbows, absentmindedly thumbing the scars there “I’ve hardly had a chance to acquire anything as of late. And you, being a doctor, as well as with the Work and any stranger you take home during a particularly frustrating time, have yourself tested twice a month, your most recent results coming up negative, since your suspicion is directed towards any habits I may have, I can assure you it is unnecessary, we’ll purchase them, along with a cautionary pill tomorrow afternoon” her voice grew breathy as she leaned forward, her fingers leaving his shaft to thumb the waist of his boxers
It wasn’t like him, to ask questions about topics he knew she didn’t want to remember, and she wondered vaguely if perhaps marriage made him more comfortable than it should have. She promised him her future; her past was never part of the deal
“Regardless, what I was trying to express is the two are one in the same for me. And it’s obvious that you love me” she looked at him, though her tone strong and confident her eyes holding a sense of uneasy “or am I wrong?”
Completely escaping his notice (Sherlock would be so disappointed in him) was Ms. Holmes herself, arms crossed on the bed and head resting on them like a schoolgirl falling asleep on her desk, her shirt was still stained with blood, as was the hand that was closest to his, the area suggested she had at some point been holding his hand before falling asleep, knowing her it’d been out of making sure his pulse was steady rather than rely on a machine, her form of showing concern, not much support to be offered to an unconscious person anyway, she’d never hold onto him without a logical reason
“Brilliant” John muttered, his eyes crinkling slightly at the corners as he smiled affectionately toward the detective
The rattling of the locked doorknob while he was buried deep inside Sherlock, having her half bent over the hospital shelves was NOT exactly a fond memory, and even now he shivered at the thought of if that person had had the keys to enter
His fingers tightened around the plastic bags he held, clutching tighter than necessary as he slowly climbed the steps one at a time
“Not the best choice for a public hook up, but I suppose that makes no difference to you, now, does it?” She smirked, “Secluded from the rest, I should have expected this is where you meet Anderson during work hours. I’ll take my leave now”
He had his mother’s curly hair, her intense eyes, her pale skin, not a trace of John in those chubby and rounded features, a Holmes down to the bone
“Hardly” Sherlock smirked, turning back to the body lying across the ground, and proceeding to study the corpse
“Fuck off” curt, vulgar, and she enjoyed the wrinkling of Mycroft’s nose at such crude language she so rarely used, never pointed in his direction unless with necessity to convey overwhelming emotions.
Molly, quiet the entire visit as she often was whenever she saw Sherlock in the mitts of a difficult case, watched after her, her clipboard clutched tightly to her chest and her eyes longingly locked on the closing doors
“You were mimicking me…?” She said, not asked, the question in her tone betraying that she couldn’t read his motive for doing such a thing
“John” she repeated, ducking her head to meet his downcast eyes and there it was again, his blinding fury coming up and swallowing him whole as she looked at him like he was the one being completely insane, like he was the one with no sense
“What?” They all asked in union, even Anderson turned to join the conversation, all puzzled expressions that reminded Sherlock why she was putting off telling anyone in the first place. If they only observed they would’ve noticed sooner. She’d been eating regularly, gone up a cup size, and put on at least 10 pounds in the past 2 months
She hadn’t spared him a glance, only when he offered his phone, opening her mouth with a simple question.
“I wasn’t jealous! God, is that what you think?!” He yelled, removing his jacket and flinging it onto the ground no where near the hook “I’m not jealous of some arsehole that hit on you, that doesn’t matter, but he TOUCHED you”
I also have gotten REALLY into Elementary (The american one with Lucy Lui) so I kinda forgot about the BBC version since it doesn't have that many episodes
“Repair man, works exclusively in motels. Look for a middle-aged man, overweight…” She paused only to use a nearby stick to lift the flab of the dead man’s coat “His Manager, he was to be fired, things got physical. Accidental death” she finished smoothly, pulling off her gloves to shove them in her coat as she stood
Again, I may slow down in my updates during NaNoWriMo, but since I'm gonna be writing on my laptop, I figure that I should be able to open another tab and update this story, so hopefully? but no promises
But he wouldn’t trade the original for any of the faked copies. His favorite Sherlock was the ‘Crazed Genius Brat Detective Chasing Down Criminals at Midnight and Blowing Up Half the Flat by 2am as She Stayed Up For A Week Straight and Had To Be Forced Fed Tiny Amounts of Toast with Jam to Keep Her Alive Because She Couldn’t Manage That Herself Even Though She was Just So Bloody Brilliant’ Sherlock
He could handle body parts in the fridge, violin at 2am, even the occasional gunshot at the wall, but this? This was asking too much of the doctor.
Sherlock’s arm snaked around John’s waist, grabbing at the gun hidden beneath his jumper to retrieve it since his arms were currently pressed against her slender hips, holding her in place so she didn’t slip out
“Do pay attention John, you know how I hate to repeat myself. Your focus has dulled significantly since we’ve added a new occupant to our flat, the lack of cases has slowed you”
She moved her fingers to stop him, and he looked up, watching in fascination at the expression on his flatmate’s face, all flushed with fever and desire
“It’s not as if it’s false. I don’t see why you didn’t just allow us to home school Junior, even with the Work, he’d learn much more. Here, his brilliant mind will go to waste.”
It started off small, a brush of the pad of his thumb over the polished silver, checking to see if it was there, and the slightly huffed sigh when he saw it was indeed
She’d deal with all of it if it meant she’d keep that special warmth that always fluttered in her whenever John made her tea or draped a blanket over her still form when she was in her mind palace and didn’t notice the freezing air of the winter hitting her where she sprawled about the couch.
“Do you know where she’s headed, by any chance?” He asked after a few minutes of awkward silence, rotating between watching the screen of the computer as it scanned whatever sample Sherlock was testing, and Molly adjusting her hair, or doodling in the corner of her report
A case then, his smile grew, and he walked towards the coat rack, pulling on his jumper, and holding out Sherlock’s coat when she reappeared completely dressed, helping her shrug into the fabric before making their way down the steps towards wherever the Work called them
I'm gonna post an update tomorrow as well but tbh they might slow down cause NaNoWriMo is almost here and I'm gonna be writing my fantasy novel
Cold case files stood in mini pillar sized stacks all over their flat, a fire hazard no doubt, and so far she’d solved an average of 5 cases a day, cases that had left Lestrade puzzled and at his wits end for months each
Then the topic reached its destination, old friends catching up leading to a potential flatmate who apparently seemed to be just as awkward and difficult as he was
John, against his better judgment, fetched the mobile and returned it to Sherlock’s slender fingers, watching her with a half smile as she plucked away at the keys quickly, a smile breaking out across her face, and she launched off the couch to run into her room
“Your middle name is Hamish.” She spoke quietly, her eyes never leaving the baby’s face “Or perhaps you prefer John…I hadn’t prepared a name ahead of time.” She confessed with a slight smile, half expecting John to be annoyed
She found it beyond amusing, slipping it into conversations every now and then to see his face burn up
Halloween is tomorrow night and I'm gonna go trick or treating with my daughter and my spouse, so I may not be able to update, but I will try
“Exactly where are we going?”  Sherlock asked, her legs crossed and her foot impatiently bouncing, “and why is it necessary for me to wear this thing?” she pulled lightly on the tie John had tied loosely around her eyes, an attempt at a surprise when they climbed into the back of the taxi
Followed quickly by a purchase conformation number and an address, and a third text reading ‘Have fun, Dr. Watson’
That, said so casually with an air of indifference shook him more than if Mycroft had actually threatened him. Because he knew oh so well exactly what could happen if he so much as stepped out of whatever line Mycroft had drawn revolving his little sister
John felt a tickle of fingers on his skin and he cracked an eye open, taking in the sight of a naked genius running her hands over his chest
He giggled, and she smiled, planting a feather light kiss to his lips before pulling back a fraction of an inch, her next words caressing over his skin with warm breaths “I’ve discovered I’m able to express certain emotions I’m unable to speak aloud at this point in time, certain sentiment that I once mocked a time ago”
Sherlock Holmes was rudely awakened from within her mind palace by Ms. Hudson’s cheery voice and the all too familiar sound of an umbrella being casually tapped on the floorboards below
“Very good John” she said with a huff, one eye half closing as if wincing from the pain, and he right away dropped to his knees in front of her, checking her over
After a few minutes of the young lad walking around, careful to avoid stepping on anything or disturbing the scene, his lips moving with silent thoughts as his eyes darted back and forth a few times, he turned back to them
“Sherlock, you’re fine, you’ll be fine” John whispered sweet nothings over and over as the time between the contractions decreased at a steady pace
So from the very first time they worked a case, telling Ms. Hudson that of course they’d be needing two bedrooms, tried to make it as clear to Anglo as possible that a candle was not necessary, and stood a respectful distance away whenever they traveled because it was obvious by the Yarders reaction that Sherlock never brought anyone in tow behind her so him following her meant more than mere acquaintances as they were at the time
“Oh, hush, dear, you only get married once!” Ms. Hudson shook her head, her hands smoothing out the wrinkles in Sherlock’s veil
She pulled the earpiece out of her ear, holding it out to Lestrade and dropping it in his hand, before turning and heading towards the exit, her heels clacking rather loudly with the dead silence that filled the air at the commotion
“You’re really okay with this?” Sally asked, in disbelief, looking at John like she expected him to object
“A visit once a year is hardly asking much, dear sister” Mycroft replied, his umbrella tapping the floor evenly
She realized a second late that she was coming; it hit her, hard, and she lunged forward, fingernails digging into the forearms still holding her, her forehead resting on the curve of his good shoulder as she shuddered, moaning something the could’ve been his name, if it wasn’t half cut off with a gasp
The knock on the door snapped him out of his thoughts, and immediately, he looked towards Sherlock, whom to his surprise was already awake, running her hands through her tangled hair, cheeks still flushed from birth and skin radiating life and health and John couldn’t help but think she looked more beautiful right then than any other time he’d seen her
“About time he sees his parents at work” Sherlock smiled, proudly, something she would have hid in the past but now didn’t seem to give a toss who saw. She WAS proud of her son, after all, the little genius that was quickly on his way of being a better detective than even her
There was something more intimate now, though, the way she held the violin, fingers dancing across its neck like a lover, bow caressing its strings
“Of course I know, but I can’t prove it just yet, I don’t want to leave this in the hands of Scotland Yard, too likely to be screwed up, and we cannot allow this man to walk free”
In reality, I get busy with doctors and shit, and my daughter's birthday is in less than a month so planning her party is also stressful..
She had deduced the outline of his body, the way it would look without needing him to remove so much as a single layer of clothing, even touching the bare skin once before during an experiment, but the knowledge seemed inadequate now, and she tugged impatiently at the clothes that suddenly became a barrier in between them, desperate to see, feel, taste, every inch of his flesh
“Oh, he’s just darling! May I?” Ms. Hudson fused, shoving the pot of food into John’s arms and heading towards Sherlock’s side
After all, that’s what he’d become for her in the two years he’d known her, right? A blanket to wrap herself in during moments where the world wasn’t allowed to see what she chose to hide, and so she hid, behind closed doors and only in his presence was any vulnerability allowed to be seen, only in his arms did she sleep, trusting and relaxed
“Will I be able to solve crimes like you one day, mother?” Junior asked as she approached the two, readying to leave
When he saw she was alright he felt such overwhelming relief his leg buckled out from under him and sent him crashing down onto the muddy bank on his knees
Later that night, when she was shirtless in front of him as he dipped a needle repeatedly into her flesh to close the unattended wounds, she kept her eyes to the floor, unable to look at him, and it was the closest thing to an apology as he was going to get
“Not like this” he said, his eyes closing for a second and he breathed in deeply, visibly trying to strengthen his willpower when his body was all for the idea of their usual rough and quick sex “I, I want to go slow” He confessed, his cheeks turning an adorable shade of pink she would appreciate more if it wasn’t for the fact she wanted to get off in that exact moment
Shortly followed by her was Lestrade, looking a little flustered and uncomfortable, and John wondered if he was embarrassed about seeing the all mighty Sherlock in a very human light
Maybe it wasn’t fair to allow that, not to himself, or her, but at that point he was well aware where exactly he stood, not a friend, or flatmate, or quick shag. But an archer and a constant, the calm that fell in love with the storm
“He was nice…at first. Though was quick to become cruel when I expressed my disinterest in sex. I deduced his affair quickly but was unable to confront him. I was in love, or so I thought” she gave a small smile, “though now it’s obvious it was nothing more than a childish crush. It wasn’t until Mycroft stepped in that I opened my eyes to the kind of man Victor truly was”
Maybe the idea of her spending the night in what had become Sherlock’s sanctuary was the root of the issue
“Come, then, John, Lestrade should have been able to catch the culprit after the incident, but we should had back to the morgue to reevaluate some of his earlier victims for more
“What are you doing here?” she asked, her tone betraying no emotion, though a mix was bubbling inside her
He grinned, taking her hand in his and guiding her to their hotel bed, running his thumb over the stone on her finger
“You…you know how I am, John…What I am…” she paused, and John could practically hear her debating whether or not to actually use the word sociopath, when whenever she brought it up in the past it ended with a row, she seemed to decide against it, thankfully, and continued with stuttering breathes “Is this…is this really what you want?” She asked, her eyes searching every inch of his face yet not holding their usual air of arrogance and all knowing, but instead held confusion and something that was scarily closed to vulnerability.
It was obvious he was in a hospital, bandaged torso and stitched up arms reminded him he had been in a knife fight not long ago; the last thing he could remember was Sherlock pressing her expensive coat against the gaping wounds in an attempt to stop the bleeding until the ambulance came
Besides, he rather liked the idea of keeping it private, just for them, for him, something to hide from the world and tuck into his pocket, a little bubble of happiness he allowed himself to feel every time they touched, the fantasy that would live in his head, that as they went at it, hard and fast and dirty yet so perfect, it was driven by affection rather than lust, that there were feelings involved, and when she curled against him in the bed they began to share, resting her head to his chest, utterly spent, he’d indulge himself the slight caress, following the line of her body with the tips of his fingers, intimate in a way that had no business outside of lovers and life partners
“Sherlock, so kind of you to join us” A familiar voice cut in, and John controlled the look of surprise his face almost made at the slumping of Sherlock’s shoulders, like she was actually relieved to see her brother for once
“He’d do anything to make Mummy happy” she replied, leaving out the bit where her brother was entirely convinced the two would end up together anyways
She didn’t seem to notice his words at all, however, so with a shrug of his shoulders, he left the room with Donovan
Of course he was the one responsible for her disheveled appearance, Sherlock having pulled him into a nearby alley, telling him to hit her, something he would never do in a million years, so she repeated pushed, slapped, and actually punched him until he grabbed a hold of her to stop the attack, restraining her in the gentlest way possible as she thrashed about, leading to a rip in her too expensive of a shirt, the seaming pulled free in two places, buttons popping onto the floor, her hair more wild and disarrayed like she’d been through something serious, and he felt horrible even though he hadn’t done anything wrong
“Sherlock, calm down…” John pleaded, the fingers clutched within her grasp turning white from lack of blood flow, and he worried vaguely they’d lose half their function by the end of the day
But, what was his dream? He couldn’t imagine coming home from work to find Sherlock baking cakes, the very idea scared him shitless, but, he didn’t mind having a babysitter, someone to watch the child for a few hours during the course of a strong case, allowing Sherlock all the freedom she craved but a home and a family to come back to; a thrill and a sense of security when she needed it
John, finally having his brain catch up with him, finished changing junior’s diaper, lifting him up to rest him with his head on his broad shoulder, and rocking softly
It was simple enough; Sherlock, John, and a few Yarders were to pose as nightclub goers, in position to gather information about the drug-trade taking place among the owners and customers
“I swear Sherlock, if you say you’re sociopath one more time I will walk out that door right now” he warned, hunching his shoulders
She could talk herself up all she wanted, but Sherlock Holmes was no sociopath, and right in that moment, it was as clear as day that she was human, brilliant and beyond any other on the planet, but human nonetheless.
She couldn’t have made it clearer that nothing was different at the hospital, and in the month they’d be home, she hadn’t so much as held their child outside of feedings
This was about how close he’d come to killing the man who dared to touch her with his bare hands, and using all his self-control not to keep punching him after he went down
The conversation that followed was filled with loud curses and fake tears on April’s half, and quiet muttered apologies and gentle nudges towards the door on John’s
The child held so carefully in his arms had his name, his blood, but he looked almost exactly like Sherlock, from the tuffs of curling thin brown black hair to the piercing gray of his eyes, pale and beautiful and not a trace of his father on him
He just needed a reminder, a slap in the face to say that no matter how beautiful, how within arms reach she was, she was still thousands of miles away, in a different world all together, the self proclaimed sociopath seemed more like a lion among domestic cats than any normal human in the basic population
He loved the music, as long as it wasn’t waking him up on nights where he was having a decent dream, of course, and he enjoyed whenever she played at regular hours
The second the mad man left, she got to work, dropping down on her knees in front of him. As her fingers fumbled with the bomb jacket strapped tight around his chest, as her hands shook, he looked down at her. Never thought for once she was capable of the expression she wore, the tension that radiated off her, the desperation of each movement.
He had no place in their world, he realized. And Jim was much closer to Sherlock than he would like to admit, able to understand her in the most twisted, and darkest of ways
After what felt like an eternity held against the wall for support, she broke away again, running her long fingers through his hair and breathing out “Bed?”
The usual attentiveness was gone, swept away by the sea of John’s gaze. She breathed out slowly, exhaling as cheeks flushing slightly, and he lost it, carefully practiced control flying out the window, pushing her back against the wall, pinning wrists to her sides with his hands, and his mouth covered hers.
Watching her play, with emotions playing across her face, the obvious language of her body, he smiled, because she was exposing herself, pealing back layers to give him a peek, something so rare and he knew he was one of the only, if not only, person Sherlock would be so open to
The fact Sherlock hadn’t realized the staff had been replaced with Mycroft’s was just an indication on how much pain she was in, too much to even focus on basic deductions
“Stop it, both of you!” John shook his head, “You’ll be getting private tutoring from one of Mycroft’s teachers, you know this isn’t about learning at all” He was well aware their son, at 5, was already smarter than all the students combined, perhaps even some of the teachers.
Still, this was a serious problem. One that reminded him that his love life was in the toilet and he hadn’t gotten off in…well, he didn’t even remember the last time he had a successful girlfriend, not when Sherlock demanded his attention and he’d rather run around London than spend an evening having dinner
When they climbed the steps to Baker street, the lights inside were switched off, and John allowed himself a little sliver of hope that maybe Sherlock was out of the evening, that she’d taken the hint that his date may work out better than expected and given him some time alone in their flat
I won't be picking up any of my Sherlock fics, tho, sorry y'all, this is the only one I'll be finishing
Sherlock moved over, sliding to the end of the bed to give him more room than necessary, resuming her previous position and she was gone, off to where her thoughts would wander
“This” John responded, gesturing down to their joined hands, his left cupping over hers and the silver band around his ring finger shining in the hotel lighting
Tall as she was, she leaned over him, and their breath mingled together, causing the humidity in the air to rise as quickly as his heart rate, their noses brushing while she stared from out the crack between the doors, intensely focusing on the room
this is honestly my longest fic I've ever written and tbh I'm proud of it, even if I'm no longer in the fandom (stopped watching after season 3)
Time had flowed by, leaving him with a few extra wrinkles and his ashy blonde hair with more ash than he liked, he was pushing 50, and his physical condition was steadily declining, their cases becoming more private with light leg work than highly dangerous chases like they used to be when they first started, but neither of them seemed to mind.
