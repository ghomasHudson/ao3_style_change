Tony grinned at him, and try as he might, Steve couldn’t help but grin back. “Look,” the other boy said, pointing a hand out to the space in front of them, “look at our city, Steve.”
Like a gun had gone off, the entire room awoke. Steve’s head jolted upward, and Natasha did the same. Clint, with a snuffed-out snore, lifted his head off the floor, and both Bruce and Thor nearly fell on their asses as they were startled awake.
Tony looked down at him and winked, popping his collar before sauntering out. “Such the gentlemen, Steven, how absolutely delightful.”
That was proven on the thirtieth video. This one wasn’t taken in a lab. This one was taken in a bathroom, the camera perched awkwardly on the sink as she herself sat on the edge of the bathtub. She looked ill. Her eyes seemed haunted.
“We need to stop that…thingy, from releasing another burst,” Bucky began, pointing his gun over to the main aircraft which was placed at the edge of top deck, “no doubt the other agents are on their way, but the’re being hindered by the shakes it’s giving off.”
He flicked through his phone absently for the next few minutes, just waiting for the bus to arrive at his stop and drop him off at the end of his street. Some point a few minutes in, he heard his phone ringing again and checked the number, frowning at the unknown caller ID. He picked it up anyway, getting ready to reject whatever fridge or insurance they were trying to sell him. “Hello?”
But he knew that there was a time and place for something like that- they still had things to work through before they could get there, and Steve was willing to wait. He was willing to do anything for Tony, really.
There was a short pause, and Tony’s heart found itself sinking. He didn’t know why his first instinct was to lash out- to be cruel and rude to the people who were only trying to help, but knew as soon as he’d said it that he shouldn’t have. But he could never just keep his fucking mouth shut, could he? Had to hurt everyone, even when they were good.
“I’d watch how you talk to me, Rogers,” Ty hissed at him, “I know you like to think you’re invincible because Tony’s got this little obsession with you right now, but when it ends- and believe me, it’ll end- then you’re gonna have to deal with me.” He stepped forward again, seeming as if he was going to go for Steve’s collar, but Steve just laughed and then batted his hands away, putting all his strength into pushing Ty back and sending him stumbling across the corridor.
And then he’d jolted away like Steve was burning, tearing himself away from the couch and then standing, ramrod straight as he stared down at Steve, horrified.
Her chest heaved with a sharp, shaky breath. “I will still have let you do this,” she snapped, “whether I remember or not, I will still have sat back and watched you kill yourself. This isn’t right, Steve.”
Tony sprawled over the mattress under Steve’s feet and shut his eyes, perfect teeth shining as he grinned. “Hmm- I guess there are worse things to be stuck with,” he said with a half-hearted shrug.
"Look, if it's ours in any way, I don't want the little guy being put into care," he told them all, "it's shitty and lonely in there. Babies need, like... love and stuff. Affection. Anyway, it could get out that we've put a kid into the system and then all hell will break loose."
it was… nice. Like now. Tony didn’t feel like using his legs at the current moment in time, so perhaps it was useful. Not that Tony was going to tell Steve that, mind you.
Tony was looking at him, a pained expression on his face. “I’m fine,” he said croakily, sitting up a little bit, before cocking his head and adding, “are
Of course, this case was a little different. The whole dead-mom thing was admittedly, quite a big thing to get upset over, and not even Steve could deny that much. Sometimes he wondered whether it was normal. To still feel it, just as viscerally, just as painfully as if it had been the very first day he’d found the news. Maybe he was weak. Pathetic.
“Yes,” the man told him, just as firm, “everything. Especially after you rammed your head into the wall for seemingly no reason at all. You’ve been through every machine we got here, and you came up clean. Your wounds have already mostly healed, and we put you on a drip to get you re-hydrated. No lasting damage as far as we can tell.” Bruce’s face went more serious, and he rested his hand against Steve’s arm. “I know what they said they were going to do. We all know. Tony was watching through the hacked CCTV footage. But they didn’t. I promise. They never got the chance. Tony blew through and- uh- took care of them all, before they could lay another finger on you.”
Steve sucked in a shallow breath, eyes widening. “Oh Jesus, I’m glad we didn’t. Don’t think he would’a approved of me puttin’ my hands all over some foreign death machine. ‘Least he didn’t see it for himself.”
He cut himself off as his eyes caught on something ahead of him, and before he knew it, he was jerking to a standstill in order to look.
Reed was waiting for him when Steve arrived. His posture was wary and his face concerned. Susan must have already told him he was here. “Captain,” he began, voice croaky from sleep, “what are you doing—”
“Nope. I’m getting reports of shots fired outside the SHIELD facility in New York…” He squinted at the CCTV footage JARVIS had obtained for him. “It looks like there’s a group trying to storm the building. We got reinforced trucks, upwards of fifty people so far, they’re—” Tony’s eyes widened as he watched the individuals lift their weapons, firing at anything that moved as they ascended the steps. “Fuck, they’re firing at civilians. We gotta move.”
“-You didn’t see yourself lying on the floor of my workshop,” he snapped, “two more minutes of heart failure and you would have suffered permanent brain damage. If I hadn’t hit you with the reactor, you would have
Well, Tony couldn't argue with that. "You fed him?" He asked, just in case. Clint turned to him and shot him a dry look.
For a moment, it seemed as if Sam might push. But when he saw the closed-off way in which Steve was holding himself, and the firm purse of his lips, he wisely chose not to pursue it. “Okay then,” he nodded, concern flitting briefly across his face, “but I’m gonna be down here for the rest of the night, so if you feel like getting out the icecream and lamenting…”
And Steve hadn’t connected any of the fucking dots. Hadn’t realized it could be anything more than skittishness that often came from abuse survivors.
Steve’s eyes widened as he clenched his jaw, “your phone? Your highly important, full-of-secret-and-confidential-information phone? You left that at a fucking charity gala? I can’t believe you. That’s... Tony, that’s so fucking stupid. I thought you said you took your job seriously, but here you are, too drunk to even remember to pick up your Goddamn phone.” Steve held his head in his hands and sighed loudly, and Tony... Tony just stared at him blankly, wondering what the fuck was going on. Since when had Steve ever talked to him like that?
“Essentially,” he’d admitted, “Tony- they’ve blocked off all information about the Iron Man armour. It’s like they’ve managed to target the specific neurons responsible for all the memory functions and just… shut them down. And then to protect their work, they’ve made sure when you try and access those memories, it triggers a pain response. Although I imagine you’ve come to the same conclusion by now, right?”
Steve frowned, about to snap something back- but Tony just shut his eyes and palmed at his head weakly. Even his hair looked a little droopier. "Fucking hate the comedown," he muttered to himself, taking in a slightly shaking breath of air.
“Thanks!” Tony beamed at him and kissed his forehead quickly, before folding the napkin gently and tucking it into the inside pocket of his jacket. His hand found Steve’s again, and although still slightly confused by the entire interaction, Steve just held on and squeezed back lightly as Tony started leading them through the cafeteria. It was always somewhat difficult to follow Tony’s flow, especially when he was having one of his up-days. But Steve was happy to deal with it- kept him on his toes, after all, and there was just something about Tony when he was like that that Steve found- well,
Eventually the kisses grew more heated, more meaningful, until Tony’s hands wrapped around Steve’s neck and pulled, dragging him down on top of Tony as he lay down on the mattress. They kissed like that for a while, until Tony made a small noise and then broke off, shuffling uncomfortably. “One sec,” he muttered, and then shoved a hand under his back, pulling out his notepad and pen from underneath him. He made a motion to toss it to the side, but then paused half-way, bringing them back in.
Tony laughed, waggling a finger. “Ah, see, my trick is- just don’t go home. Can’t yell at you if you’re not there.”
Thankfully, Sam got the message. With a soft sigh, he bumped his shoulders against Steve’s and leaned back, the picture of nonchalance. Steve was grateful for Sam every day- for knowing him so well and being so observant. “I’m glad,” he said, before kicking Steve in the shin, “but also, whilst you were gone sulking all that time, you left me to deal with Clint and Natasha in the middle of one of their arguments. Alone. I ain’t ever gonna forgive you for that, buddy, that’s a place you should never leave a friend.”
Tony stopped after another moment, staring intently at the car. He swallowed a lump in his throat. “Sorry,” he muttered again, “I didn’t… he’s just- yeah. Didn’t mean to yell.”
Steve pondered the question for a moment. “Just... stuff, I guess. Peggy took me shopping the other day, that was fun. Oh, and I’ve started- I’m drawing again,” he said in the end, and then watched as genuine surprise flitted over her face for a second. She nodded, writing something down hurriedly on her notepad and then smiling across to him.
Tony didn’t say anything for a few seconds, and then Steve head a shuffling on the other end of the line. “Hey, so, don’t freak out.”
“They ordered a hit.” Tony’s eyes were wide as he looked down at Steve. “What was it that you were investigating?” He asked.
They’d almost made it to the restaurant Tony had been leading them to. Almost, but not quite. Because when they turned the corner and tried to cross the street, Steve heard Tony’s name get called out amongst the general hubbub of the streets, and felt Tony spin next to him.
Across the room, Bucky gagged loudly. “Not in my house, you kinky weirdos! Go roleplay somewhere else.”
“Wasn’t planning on it, darlin’,” he assured him quietly, “that’s why I’m here and not anywhere else.”
“Steve?” Thor called out his name as he pulled up outside their school fifteen minutes later, looking at him with concern, “are you sure you’re up for going today? I know what Mr. Wilson said, but I’m sure if you—”
Tony kept his eyes fixed on the table, and wished there was another mug to throw. There wasn’t- so he turned away.
“Nah- dumped him a month back, when she started hedging her bets on a date with Tony instead,” Darcy responded, and dammit, Steve really was terrible at the whole ‘not listening’ thing.
He clenched his jaw and took another swig, before JARVIS announced that the team had successfully managed to contain the situation and were headed back on the jet. Tony pushed all the stupid self-deprecating shit from his mind and focused instead on his team, the ones who had just been in a fight with a bunch of psycho criminals. He was being fucking ridiculous.
There was a short silence, Bucky’s laughter petering out a little. Great. What a way to throw cold water over everyone’s head- talk about his depressing inner monologue in front of them. He opened his mouth tiredly, apology already on his lips, but Peggy got in first.
Everyone nodded glumly, huddling a little closer together as the wind whipped up a new spray of wet snow around them. The impromptu shopping trip to the mall had been Peggy’s idea of combatting boredom, and Steve had thought it’d be a good idea to try and get in some early Christmas shopping before it became too late. Of course, their plans never quite went as they intended- they’d been kicked out of the place by mall security after an hour when Natasha shoulder-barged Thor into the mannequin tower in the centre of the plaza accidentally. Seriously though; it was just stupid to put a bunch of precariously placed dolls in the middle of a busy shopping mall. And it’s not like they’d
He blinked, rubbing a hand over his eyes and then looking up at the ceiling. A second later, the off-beat ringing tune of Sam’s doorbell went off downstairs, and he realized with a sigh that that was probably what had woken him up.
Tony checked his watch. “They probably won’t be able to come right now, it’s too late,” he said, “we’ll ring in the morning. That alright with everyone?”
Leaning over the table, he snagged an apple out of the fruit bowl and shot a smile over to Paul, who returned it fondly. “Sam’ll be home shortly,” he called out as Steve turned, “I’ll tell him not to worry you.”
“You probably have a concussion, Steve, and God only knows what else. I’m taking you to the fucking hospital.”
When he glanced back at them, they were looking at him in confusion. He saluted them lazily, and let his eyes slip away- noting Tony watching him again as he did so. Only for a second, because then Steve had turned around once more, but in the fraction of a moment their eyes had met, Steve noticed the frown creased on his forehead. God only knew what he was thinking- it seemed like sort of a mess up in that head- and Steve just let it slide in the end. He kept his eyes firmly facing the path in front of him and refused to turn around even once.
“Steve, relax,” Tony couldn’t help but laugh as he poked Peter’s chest and then crooked his finger, making the boy jump and start to giggle again, “he's not a bomb- he’s just ticklish, sweetheart. You’re fine.”
Steve stared at him incredulously before it suddenly dawned on him and he gaped, sucking in a large mouthful of the ass-tasting air. “Bucky, did you
Steve snarled loudly, furiously, eyes flashing as he lifted a hand and then curled it painfully tight around his hair, looking down at the floor. Tony took another step forward. “You’re going to be okay Steve—”
is going to happen,” Bruce told him firmly, “but I can stay if you really want. Just don’t fuck in front of me, okay?”
His therapist said it was common, all those things. A warped sense of time. Periods of disassociation. Days when his heaviness was almost unbearable and all he wanted to do with himself was curl in a ball and just
have work, and so eventually they both had to refrain from copping feels in the bathroom and actually get dressed, which sucked. Steve only had a couple of meetings to attend in the evening, however, and although he’d been going to spend the day at SHIELD monitoring some of the recruits and giving them what everyone (Clint & Nat) now liked to call his famous ‘Captain’s Speech’, he also wanted to spend some time in Tony’s workshop, looking at what the man was currently building. His work was honestly fascinating to Steve, he didn’t think he’d ever get enough of it- and seeing Tony in his element like that wasn’t too bad either.
The other boy stopped, and then swallowed and looked down at his knees. The light-heartedness of his manner dropped away, revealing the true anxiety underneath, and suddenly Steve was looking at a boy much smaller than he seemed. “You were mad at me, because I’m an asshole and I told my friends that you were- I didn’t tell them what you really were to me. And it upset you. And I wanted to explain.”
Another chuckle. “Show it every few years on some program no-one watches or cares about. They all thought it was some big corporate conspiracy, it was big news for months. I feature in the damn thing a handful of times too. Never gave an interview though.”
“I picked them up on the way. Had a feeling I’d be needing them,” Tony admitted, and Steve was sent back to the past, heard tony as he told everyone
Tony just sighed, and looked at him with a serious face. ‘Because you saw me moving,’ he murmured, stroking Steve’s face, ‘before you lost consciousness, you saw me move. And you know if I can move, I can fight. So you really, really have to stop me from doing something stupid and reckless and heroic before it’s too late to go back on, don’t you?’
He decided against that, however. He was on his last warning with school at that point- the next would mean a three-day suspension, and he would really rather not have to deal with that. Plus, he didn’t actually fancy getting his ass kicked in the middle of a school cafeteria. Tiberius wasn’t worth that much to him, to be quite honest. Just some slimy asshole who seemed to think he had a say in what Steve did and didn’t do.
Steve just grumbled something unintelligible, kissing Tony’s forehead again before nudging him backward. Happy had stopped off at Wendy’s, so Tony was just gonna take the two-minute walk and meet him there. “Call me when you land,” Steve said, “and be back in time for Christmas or I’ll be having words with Mr. Kobayashi.”
The hall was still dark, so Steve had to take Tony’s hand again in order to navigate them over to the living room. Once successfully there, he gently guided Tony onto the couch, where he went with a thump.
“Not long now,” Steve whispered. The air was already too hot to be comfortable, and the ground itself was beginning to form ominously large cracks as the world shook itself apart.
Eventually, they ended up at the bottom of Steve’s street- Tony gradually slowing down until coming to a standstill outside Steve’s house once again. Steve couldn’t help but pout- he’d sort of wished for that to last a little longer.
Peter didn’t want to have two homes, he didn’t want Dad to marry someone else or Pops to have different kids-
was currently playing on the TV, although again, most weren’t truly focused on it. Sam was snoozing gently, Natasha and Clint were punching eachother as hard as they could and seeing who chickened out first, and Thor and Jane were busy copping a feel at the back of the fort where they thought no one could see.
“You know what it’s like,” came the eventual voice, way too fragile to sound remotely like Thor, “to watch as you lose someone you love. See them slip away, slowly- and I suppose, for you- know that there is nothing you can do about it.” He didn’t blink as he spoke, but swallowed heavily and then puffed out his chest, lips pursing into a thin line. Eventually, he turned and angled his head over to Steve. There was a defeated smile on his face. “Well, for me, I know that there
Steve’s eyes widened and he spluttered, then watched Sam look up briefly, waving his phone. “Nat’s question, not mine.”
“Come find me when you’re ready to apologize and accept that I have some personal boundaries, Tony.” Steve flexed his hands and then walked out of the door without another word, closing it gently and leaving Tony in the broken silence of their shared bathroom. That was it. Weirdly anticlimatic, Tony thought absently as he pressed a shuddering hand against his jaw and wiped off the blood. He’d expected there would be... more. He wasn’t sure what of. Shouting, maybe. There always seemed to be shouting, when he’d imagined scenarios like this.
“Steve?” Tony asked, his voice gentle, but tinted with concern as he took in the tight lines of Steve’s face, “what are you thinking in that head of yours, huh?”
Steve ran the faucet for a few seconds and then wandered back through the en suite, his eyes on Tony. He looked… soft. And it was rare, to get him like this. So totally unguarded, naked in every sense of the word. But right now, that was what he was, and he didn’t even seem to care, all loose-limbed and soft-haired and flushed as he smiled across to Tony. “Whadd’ya lookin’ at?”
He turned the phone around, Tony’s name flashing on the screen. Steve sighed loudly, but unfortunately, his traitorous cheeks gave away the immediate rush of adrenaline he felt at the sight of Tony’s name. “Give it here, idiot.”
He broke off again when the words failed him, just shaking his head and burying it further into Tony’s shoulder as he cried. His mom’s voice was calm and visceral in his ears- she’d always sounded so goddam
Hauling himself upright, he informed the team briefly of his plan, waiting for their approval until leaving. They knew Tony’s state even better than Steve did and agreed almost instantly, trusting Steve to know what he was doing while they remained indoors and nursed their wounds, all of them huddled protectively around Tony’s unconscious form.
His eyes flicked back to Rumlow, just for a moment. Against his own volition, he felt something dangerous begin to flicker somewhere under his sternum. It was doubt. “Sir, I think—”
Steve clenched his eyes shut. “Please, don’t hurt me like this,” he begged, “some other way. Any other way. Just not this, please-”
Steve lifted his hand slowly and settled it against Tony’s cheek, just for a second. He nodded again, like he was convincing himself.
He looked with wide eyes at the oncoming concrete, hands going out to try and blast the repulsors to life, but at that moment his head throbbed in total, blinding agony and he could hardly even see, let alone goddamn work the thing out. He yelled in panic, limbs flailing out as he propelled into the tower at a speed faster than your average sports car. The impact when he hit the roof was blunt and brutal, and he gasped in pain, feeling the floor concave under the armour’s weight. He couldn’t even remember how to land properly, or break his fall.
Tony rested peacefully in the warmth of Steve’s embrace, his head tucked up into Steve’s chest. He could almost have been sleeping.
“Did I break them?” Steve choked, delicate finger tracing the outline of Tony’s ribs, a feather-light caress, before seemingly coming back to himself and snapping it away in horror.
“Stop thinking.” Steve pulled him back in and ducked down to kiss him before Tony’s mind could reach any higher, “That’s sweet. Thank you, Tony.”
“What the hell did you say to him to make him stay?” Steve asked, not bothering to look up from the cupboards he was digging into, knowing it was Bucky from his footsteps alone.
all of it coiling and twisting and burning inside him. But he didn’t have much choice—whichever teacher it was that was holding onto him was relentless, and they managed to drag him around the corner so that he was obscured from looking at Stone completely. He snarled. “Get your fucking hands off me!”
It just so happened that the moment he set his eyes back on the outside corridor was the moment he spotted none other than Tony himself, just as he was turning the corner and disappearing from sight entirely. Steve caught the flash of half a face before it was gone, but it was enough. He’d jumped from his seat within a second.
Tony stilled for a moment, but then Steve felt the scrape of teeth across his temple, and knew that Tony was smiling above him. His hand squeezed around Steve’s, and he shifted his body so it was just that little bit closer. “Love you too.”
Steve shouted over Mr. Wilson angrily, his hand slamming against the dashboard, “he manipulated and blackmailed Tony into sleeping with him and doing things for him,
Tony winked, twirling it over his fingers expertly. “Addicts always have stashes, sweetie.” He chuckled lightly and then raised it to his mouth- only to be stopped by Steve’s hand, curled firmly around his wrist. He eyed it up for a second before flicking that gaze up to Steve instead.
Sentiment really was a killer. Now was the time, really, when Steve should act. Tony was sleeping, vulnerable. And Tony had told JARVIS to turn himself off in the room while they’d been having sex, because Steve had always asked for that while they’d been together, and it was just a habit now. Steve could get up, search his room while Tony slept on, and go completely undetected. He could incapacitate Tony and then call up SHIELD, tell them that he’s got Iron Man.
“For the next time your self preservation instincts fail you and you require some assistance,” Tony grinned, scrawling out his number across Steve’s arm- then he winked and added “although, if you’re coming to me, I’m guessing they’ve deserted you completely anyway.”
“This is going to end terribly,” Tony declared, waving a sad little finger around, “JARVIS, make note. This is going to end very, very terribly.”
well. And then you can lay off my back and let me just fuck Tony fucking Stark for the rest of my fucking life in peace!”
Instead, he plummeted through three floors of the Avengers tower, feeling each impact as it bruised against his battered, exhausted body. Something thumped painfully against his head on the way down, and suddenly there was a dull buzzing in his ears, the world exploding into fuzzy light. He thought that he’d stopped moving by that point. Rubble bounced and boinked off the metal, and he could feel his arm sat at a funny angle up above his head.
At the sound of his name being called, Zeke turned; head moving to look at Steve. At once, the bored sneer moved onto his face, and it only helped to rattle Steve further. “Hello. You’re Tony’s little buddy aren’t y-“
It was Thursday by the time he finally made the decision to go visit his mom again. It had been too long since his last visit, and in a way, he thought it might just be nice to see her again. To talk to her in the way he’d used to, even if there was no one to respond now. He thought about asking Bucky or Peggy or Tony to come with him- but they were all busy or out of town, and Steve didn’t want to bother them. He could do it alone. He had every other time.
Tony observed him for a second, before an excited little grin appeared on his face. “How much time do you have?”
Tony looked at him warily. Natasha glanced over, eyebrows raised. "If you don't pick him up, he's gonna start screaming."
“Noooooo!” Maria giggled and shook her head, and the look on Tony’s face when he looked down at her was filled with enough love that Steve would repeat all his own pain a thousand times over just to see it again. Tony glanced up at him, and Steve figured that the thought must have been loud, because Tony leaned over and caught his mouth in a gentle kiss, Maria still tucked up safely between us.
Steve looked at them warily. He could feel his guard coming up automatically, but he tried to tamp down on the urge to get defensive. Rhodey was Tony’s best friend, and he’d heard the name Pepper get thrown around a few times too. They obviously had good intentions.
Mr Wilson laughed and clapped him on the shoulder. “I’d be a bit of a bastard if I didn’t let my son have his boyfriend over sometimes, wouldn’t I?” He said with a smile, before ruffling Steve on the head and then beginning to walk out of the living room. “Just make sure to get enough sleep, Steve. It’s school tomorrow.”
, Steve- a whole branch of science dedicated to not knowing things,” Tony shuddered, and Steve felt it reverberate through his shoulder, “Good lord, the horror.”
Wearily, he turned again, watching Tony hurry toward him, jumping down the stairs two at a time in his ratty jeans and faded band tshirt. “What do you want, Tony?” He asked.
“Why is everyone so convinced he’s so fucking awful, Jesus Christ!” Steve burst, hands flying through the air in irritation, “you don’t even know him, Buck! None of you do! Not even me!  All I’ve got on him is that he’s apparently the type of guy to leave a party hours early to drive my stupid ass home! So for God’s sake, could you all just quit it?”
He sat down gently next to Tony and bit his lip worriedly when Tony just chuckled a little, shaking his head softly. He was staring at his hands, and it made the long strands of hair at the front of his head fall into his eyes. “Hate my friends,” was all he mumbled in the end.
They managed to make out for all of twenty seconds before Peter became bored and started to whine. With a deep sigh, Tony broke away and looked up, glaring daggers through the bars of the cot. “We are busy right now,” he tried, but Peter just looked at him with his dumb sad eyes that demanded attention, quite clearly uncaring of anything else that Tony and Steve may have been occupied with.
Tony hissed, “Steve, I can’t keep treating you like shit and then expecting you to stay, it’s not fair, I’m not treating you right, I keep fucking up-“
“-WHY THE FUCK IS THERE NOT A DEFIB ON IN THE PERSONAL QUARTERS?” Tony screamed frantically, cursing himself for his own fucking idiocy,
Tony huffed and looked down at his knees. “God, you’re as bad as these two,” he flicked a thumb over to Thor and Steve, “but yes, I’m fine.”
in that suit, thank you very much Tony) and then vaulted the railings, continuing the mission that they’d been sent out to complete.
Tony argued, his voice wet, “maybe not by human standards, but an alien wouldn’t be alive by human standards either, and that doesn’t make them any less important. Any less fucking real. Do you understand?” He shook his head once. “I am never going to just sell you off. Don’t
There was no one who made Steve as vulnerable as Tony did. But he always knew what to do to make Steve better, too.
“that you did,” Natasha nodded pensively. “And then, when you picked yourself up from the floor and told a rather surprised Tony Stark that you were, in fact, fine, and not drugged or something- what happened?”
“I think you’re a fucking asshole, yeah,” Bucky said, and something horrible clenched down over Tony’s heart until he added, “and it’s the only thing that kept me sane, some days. You never walked on eggshells ‘round me. You gave as good as you got, teased and made fun of me and brought me outta my own head. If you hadn’t treated me like I was any other human, I would never have actually believed I was.”
Steve spluttered, watching in irritation as Bucky gave him a warning look and hovered his fingers over the keys. “Oh dear God, alright, I’m sorry… car.”
Tony opened his mouth a little, but then just nodded instead. He kept glancing awkwardly between Steve and his two friends, who had sat themselves on the counter and were watching them blatantly. Sam was throwing bunches of popcorn into his mouth.
Tony was fighting a losing battle. He couldn’t undo what he’d done here, and he couldn’t go back either. Peter was going to leave, and whatever Tony tried to do now, it was still going to hurt like hell.
Tony chose to ignore that, instead sitting apprehensively on the arm of the couch. He didn't intend to stay here long. But Peter turned to him when he heard the voice, his face breaking out into a toothless smile as he clapped his podgy hands together uncoordinatedly. He held out his arms.
He tried to work out what Tony was getting at as the boy pulled open his cupboard and buried his head inside, searching for what was probably a first-aid kit. Did Tony think Steve was going to judge him for enjoying science? Jesus Christ- Steve liked looking at
“Merely testing out the new social performance upgrades you fitted me with last night,” the AI replied calmly, all traces of worry gone from his voice. Steve… well, Steve was too busy recovering from the initial shock of catching that brief flash of smooth chest and then dealing with the subsequent raging hard-on to say anything even remotely helpful, and so in the end Tony just sighed and nodded, apparently accepting it.
“I’ll find them for you,” he said it lightly, but the words held a remarkable amount of promise in them. His hand rose absently, ghosting over the marks on Steve’s body. “Don’t worry.”
Tony’s face fell, and he looked down, his fingers settling on Steve’s knee. “I know it means nothing, but I really am sorry that you… that that was how you were feeling, Steve—”
As always, everything he said didn’t feel like quite enough, and he scuffed his feet against the soaking grass as he tried not to let the lump grow in his throat. He’d done this so many times, by now. Surely he was past the crying stage.
“Just out of curiosity,” Tony whispered, like they could hear him from the other side of the door where Die Hard was playing at full volume and yet was still being drowned out by the sound of his friends’ voices, “do you think they- I mean, who’s in there?”
nervous. I’ve just never done this before. And I don’t—I want to be good for you.” Okay, now he was definitely blushing. That was a dumb thing to say. That was way too pathetic, now Steve was going to think he was like some lovesick idiot or something. Which he absolutely was. But Steve didn’t need to know that.
It had been irritating- but Peter wouldn’t have minded now. If it meant they’d been doing it together, sending stupid smirky grins toward one another or just holding hands at the table rather than looking cold and tired- he wouldn’t have minded at all.
Steve rolled his eyes. “We’ll evaluate the situation when we get into the kitchen and see what it is, alright?”
“I think you’d all better come in, don’t you?” He asked, and Steve got the impression that he may have just done something that not even an apology to Mr. & Mrs. Wilson was going to be able to fix, this time.
“Can you not do this in my room, please? God, you know what, never mind, I preferred it when you were fighting,” Peter grumbled, but ultimately failed to convince anyone, what with the immovable little beam on his face as he watched his parents, seemingly back to normal once more.
He ducked his head and pushed his knees up to his chest, feeling his face crumble against his hands. He’d tried not to let himself do this, tried to focus on Tony as much as he could, but it was too much. He was too weak. Everything was ruined and it was his fault, and he knew, he knew that even if they tried to fix this, the likelihood was that they just couldn’t. Because Tony had already been through so much, he’d already done this before with other people he’d been in relationships with, and Steve was now just another person on that fucking list.
Nat stepped forward at this point, looking at Tony seriously as she read off her page. “Then it started happening more regularly. You’d refer to him as ‘my husband’ when you were looking for him, or when you wanted his attention. A lot of the time, you would do it when he wasn’t even in the room.”
Steve paused, trying to catch what Tony meant. When he opened his mouth, Tony finished “about my mom. About how she died,” and suddenly it all became a lot clearer.
Tony tilted his head and then brushed his lips absently over Steve’s temple before picking up his tweezers. A second later and much to his surprise, Steve felt a sudden sting under his brow and he jumped in shock, eyes flying open to spot Tony’s amused face as he held the metal pincers in his left hand, clamped around one of Steve’s hairs. “Sorry,” he said, with a face that spoke of his complete lack of sorrow, “it was annoying me.”
“He got caught in the quantum—look, can you put Tony on the phone? He might understand this better,” she said hurriedly, and Tony’s brow creased as Steve handed over the phone, but he slipped it up to his ear all the same and then listened in while Natasha talked. He asked questions occasionally, but mostly absorbed the information given to him, until eventually just shutting his eyes and running a hand over his face.
Tony had seemed so positive he’d have a chance.  And that- the idea that there was someone who was so unwaveringly faithful in his ability to achieve something like that… it made him just want to try. Just see if he could prove Tony right, that he
There wasn’t a sound aside from the slight pit-pat of rain on concrete, and he snarled in fury just to fill the silence.
Steve nodded, and then looked at Tony’s upturned palm. He hurriedly pulled out the laser-cutter from his pocket and handed it over. “Don’t be loud, people might hear us.”
Blinking back to life a few moments later, Tony turned around and made a face, picking up the pillow and chucking it back at him. “I know it was a joke, obviously,” he said airily, although his eyes spoke otherwise as he wandered over to Steve’s side of the bed and then grabbed his phone from the nightstand.
“Tony,” Steve said exasperatedly, beginning to move past him again, “we don’t have time to discuss this right now. You’re not going to be useful without the suit and I won’t let you go out and get beat up by Piledriver when you can’t defend yourself.” He paused, turning back to Tony with a slightly apologetic face. “We have to go. Just… just stay here, and we’ll discuss it later, okay?”
Steve’s eyes widened. “They’re not going to relocate me,” he said vehemently, “that’s not happening.”
But his team were coming. Tony, Bucky, Bruce, Thor, Nat, Clint, Rhodey, Sam… everyone else. Someone else. They’d find him. They always did.
“You need to fuck off, Ty,” he spat, “I’m sorry I didn’t come out with you last night, okay, but I actually
“I bet I’d still find you in under an hour,” Natasha had challenged, raising a daring eyebrow up at him before turning back to the morning paper.
“Tony’s that way,” he said, pointing off Northward where Iron Man was frazzling Ebony Maw with untamed power, backed by Thor’s lightning and shielded by Pepper’s Rescue Armour.
They broke away after another few seconds, looking at one another with shared smiles and rosy cheeks. Tony traced the side of his face with a finger, thinking of a dozen different futures that had just popped into his head. “You think this is gonna work?” He whispered, nervous as the words fell from his lips.
Walking forward another step, he peered closer in at the person sitting in the car, just to check as to whether or not it was really Bucky. That, of course, alerted the boy’s attention, because suddenly he was getting a familiar shit-eating grin thrown his way and the window was being wound down, revealing a definitely-Bucky face.
He felt Steve approach slowly and then take a seat on Tony’s desk chair, fingers brushing over the files strewn there. The silence was unnerving, and Tony knew Steve wasn't doing it on purpose, he was only trying to think of something to say, but it set Tony's nerves on end anyway.
It felt like the past few months had just been one stress after another. Steve didn’t want Tony to wake up tomorrow and go through the same thing that he had today. He was going to snap under the pressure, and when Tony snapped, bad things happened. Reckless, dangerous things that involved injuries or, on one gut-wrenching occasion just over a year ago now, a trip to the hospital for a stomach pump.
He pulled out the shaving kit from the bathroom and got to work, carefully scraping off the beard he’d kept for the past few years. It felt strange to have a bare face now, but he preferred it that way. Looked and felt a little more like himself. He raised an eyebrow at his reflection and then sighed. It was a long time since he’d given himself a proper look in the mirror. He could see the tiredness on his own face, deep and heavy. It sat under his eyes, pooled around his brow. He looked old.
No. They wouldn’t have moved so fast, surely. That would make it too obvious. And of course, he couldn’t even be sure there was any truth to Tony’s words in the first place. Steve had to remain as objective as he could here. The fate of the whole goddamn world might depend on it.
Tony’s smile warmed him. His hair was dusted with grays, and the glasses sat wonky on his nose like always. ‘You can’t stay here forever,’ he muttered with a fond roll of his eyes, tucking one of Maria’s little strands of hair out of her face.
Exhaustion slammed into him suddenly, and he could no longer hold himself upright. He felt Tony’s hands wrap around him, lower him steadily to the soft earth with the care only he had ever shown.
Steve nodded, making his way into the car. Tony waited for him until he was properly seated, and then slid over the bonnet and into the driver’s seat. He slammed the door shut and then shook the droplets of rain out of his hair effortlessly, still managing to look like a model as he did so. The curls had gone a little flatter, and his hair was now stuck up in wild spikes, some of the moisture dripping down his face. It had been a week since the day at the Icecream parlour, and the once-purple bruise running over his cheek had become nothing more than a slightly greenish patch that somehow managed to bring out the blue of his eyes even more.
“No,” Natasha’s voice cut through firmly, “we haven’t finished running through tests yet, it’s not-”
“What? Steve, don’t be ridiculous.” Tony’s back straightened as if mentally preparing himself for something. “You’re staying with me.”
“Thanks, Thor,” he said afterward, when they were on the bus home again, “you… it was good of you. To do this for me.”
. “They don’t know language, so I don’t really speak it, per se,” he began, and Tony was almost appeased until he added, “I can just sense the emotions behind what it is they’re trying to say. And he wanted the glowing man and the singing man, which I assume is you and Steve.”
Tony huffed, leaning forward against the table again. Steve noticed a chain flash around his neck; the same one as what he’d shown Steve yesterday. “Fucking
“I… it’s a date,” Steve agreed, half of him wondering what the hell Tony was even talking about whilst the other just tried not to smile too brightly. Because that wasn’t cool.
He nodded, smiling at her. “I know,” he answered, “but I don’t think I’d last very long here without Tony anyway.” When she refused to waver, he just sighed. “Susan, you don’t need to worry about me. I’ll go back and save Tony, and you will never even remember this. It’ll all turn out fine.”
“I’m gonna—I’m gonna get some stuff,” Steve said, and Tony wasn’t sure how much time had passed, it was just going over him like a blur as he watched Steve slowly slip away, head down, looking at the floor. “I… I think I’ll head out to DC for a while, see how… yeah.”
“I know you argue with me,” Steve continued, “but I see the way your hands shake when you do. How you force yourself to move forward even when your body language is screaming ‘run’. I’m not blind, Tony. You’re still—you’re still scared of me.”
Tony paused, and then shrugged. His own cone was already nearly gone- he must have been hungry. “Wasn’t in the mood to go to school. Been wandering around, y’know.”
Steve pursed his lips and slid his phone back into his pocket, getting the feeling Tony wasn’t really up for conversation just then. He could feel Clint and Natasha’s gazes on him by that point, but he didn’t look at them, instead choosing to just lay his head on the table and try to get a nap in until the end of the class.
He lurched forward, hand reaching out for the Widow’s Bite in Peter’s hand before the kid could goddamn electrocute himself, but Natasha shouted back at him. “IT’S FINE, I DEWEAPONIZED IT. HE LIKED IT BECAUSE IT WAS SHINY.”
Silence fell once more; Steve shuffling backward and forward on his feet and Thor just nodding absently, looking at something over Steve’s shoulder. Feeling like the conversation was drawing to a close, he opened his mouth to say a goodbye- but Thor beat him to it.
and last time… last time they’d been battling it out in Siberia, Steve had been coherent enough to only fight to incapacitate, and yet he’d
. Thought he was hot shit because he was popular and the star player of the school soccer team and smart and funny and beautiful. And he always walked around wearing that ridiculous leather jacket with about a hundred zips and buttons on it, and it wasn’t cool, no matter what he said.
Steve replayed the moment in his head. A few seconds. That was all it had been. A few seconds between life spinning on, same as ever, and the entire universe suddenly collapsing in Steve’s hands. JARVIS was saying these things, and objectively, Steve knew Tony was dead. He’d watched it. He’d put his fingers against Tony’s neck and felt nothing underneath, no pulse, no life.
He breathed out another sigh of relief and then turned Steve onto his back once more, lifting him gently up into his arms. He couldn’t fly him out like this, he’d freeze to death, but Natasha was supposed to be arriving soon, and he could meet her at the front entrance. He looked down at Steve, wishing he could lift the faceplate up and kiss him. Unfortunately he was locked into the suit and would be until they got back home, so contented himself with pressing his forehead into Steve’s for a second. “I’ve got you,” he said softly to the unconscious man, “you’re alright. You’re safe now.” Then he added, “Sorry for the headache you’re gonna wake up with tomorrow. Kinda pushed me into a corner with that one, big guy.”
“Good morning, Steven,” Tony’s breathless voice filtered weakly down the speaker, and Steve sighed out a huge breath, “may I just mention that that is not how I usually wake up and start the day off, so you do not need to worry about that. This was an outlier. Usually there would be more lounging than this.”
“Nngh,” Steve murmured decidedly, rolling further into Tony’s side and nestling his head against the skin of Tony’s shoulder. A morning Supersolider was a clingy supersoldier, and Tony sighed at the challenge ahead of him. Disentangling himself was going to take skill and tactical ingenuity. Luckily, Tony was more than capable of both those things.
“I’m sorry,” Steve waved a hand and cut him off before he could say anything more, “but is this really any of your business?”
So when the damn thing started to go off at 3am, Steve definitely knew something was wrong. Or it’d better be, otherwise someone at SHIELD was going to fucking die.
“Yeah, I’m here,” Steve said quickly down the line, sparing one last glance over to the boy, who just so happened to be looking back over to him again. He cocked an eyebrow and did something with his mouth that could almost be construed as a smile, before pushing off his bike and heading in the opposite direction of school with his friends. “Just…”
Thor sighed again, and then pushed himself away from the table. “I should probably go after them,” he said with a huff, before adding mutinously “and stop my brother from getting suspended. Again.”
“She’s terrifying,” he informed Steve, who had just become perfectly aware of that fact, “more so than I ever could be- so I’m gonna go with the more human approach here.”
, Steve’d called him. And Tony knew... look, he wasn’t ashamed of how many people he’d slept with and he never fucking would be, but- but the way Steve had said it, with such
Thor came back out at some point in the night, and he made himself comfortable at Steve’s side. He put out some food on the table for them both, but Steve didn’t touch it. “You can go take the spare room if you want,” Thor told him at about 1 in the morning, “I’ll stay up and keep an eye on him.”
“I know,” Steve told him, helping him down off the ramp and trying not to let himself cry. Tony would be okay. He was in bad shape, but he’d get better. “We couldn’t stop him. We tried, but we couldn’t… it was too much.”
The thought came easily. It had come for the first time about an hour ago, simple and obvious. He thought about it again as JARVIS asked him the question. “Because I need to get him back,” Steve declared, “and I need them to not try and stop me.”
Bodies littered the stairwell like limp puppets, blood smattering their uniforms, bones sticking horrifically out of place. There were at least seven men strewn over the steps, and they were all HYDRA agents, going by their badges. Tony gagged at the massacre in front of him and looked away from all the blood, glad of the suit’s filtration system that was blocking out the smell. There were no bullets, no scorch marks. This appeared to have all been done by hand.
He turned his head to where Bucky was pointing- feeling somewhat as if he was in a dream as he watched the Asgardian fly through the air, rising up above the ship with a hammer in one hand and Tony’s body in the other.
“It’s fine, not broken, just a cut. Could’ve happened to anyone; just unfortunate that’s where I landed, that’s all,” Steve told him, trying to keep his voice calm and reassuring. It didn’t seem to be doing any favours though; Tony just seemed to get more worked up from it.
Sighing heavily, he leaned forward and grabbed the bottle of whiskey Tony had set out on the coffee table, pouring another round for the two of them. They were quiet for a moment, both watching the amber liquid slosh in their glasses.
Steve’s eyes were drawn to the large windows as they suddenly turned black and hid the landscape from view. Steve thought he heard the front door clicking, some sort of lock activating. “No one’s gonna get in here now,” Tony told him shortly, turning to Steve and then folding his arms, his brow furrowed deeply. “First thing—do you need any immediate medical intervention? Any serious injuries?”
“The people after you are Avengers too, remember,” Steve whispered, “plus- who knows who he’s found yet. Maybe Nat. You really wanna risk running around the tower when you have the Black Widow gunning for you?”
Steve looked up, right into the middle of his group of friends, for a good five seconds. It seemed Natasha had some sort of premonition concerning what was about to happen, because she suddenly turned on her heel and left the room very swiftly.
He couldn’t just sit here and wait for—for whatever it was, to be over. People could start dying soon. He didn’t know how dangerous this thing was, but if it was enough for it to have caused casualties within minutes of emerging, then no doubt it would put up a fair fight.
Steve whispers hoarsely, pushing the bottle of pills carelessly off the side of the desk and then crouching down, his arms trapping Tony in his chair, “please don’t do that, Tony. Please. I’m… I couldn’t deal with losing you too-”
Tony stared at the window, absently calculating the force they would have needed to break through it, the size of the unit that would have stormed through judging by the width of destruction. The weapons they must have used. He saw where Happy was positioned; kneeling behind the bar on the far end of the living room. He’d had time to work out where was safest to stay. He’d probably even had time to put Peter somewhere else, before coming back to try and fight them off. Had Happy been holding Peter at the time, he probably wouldn’t have survived. But going by the empty gas cannister that he could see tucked away next to the skirting board, they must have spotted him holding the defensive position and simply chosen to gas him, rather than kill him.
Tony’s lip curled- not a smile, but more a recalling of a memory. He was silent for a moment, as if debating what to say, before ending up with “same as you. Got in a fight. Again.”
The work managed to save him about three hours. That was actually good, all things considered. Steve must have been busy. But he still ended up knocking on the door of Tony’s workshop about 192 minutes later- not that Tony had been purposely counting. It was just that once he started on the numbers, it was hard to stop, and he ended up doing it for sort of… everything.
“Yeah, but I’m betting Steve doesn’t know where to go,” Carol added from her spot on the floor, before looking up to Clint with a smile, “plus we actually like him.”
As his feet dragged across the shiny floors, he noticed someone sat on the bench a few yards ahead of him. He had his head bent low, elbows resting on his open knees, and even from the distance, he seemed exhausted, simply in the way he was holding himself. The slump of his spine. The way his palms were pressed into the sockets of his eyes.
Tony just huffed, slipping his palm up against Steve’s chest. “Electricity is a real bastard though,” he mumbled, “gotta be careful, Steve.”
He put his hands up to his head and started to attempt the task of taking off the helmet. Meanwhile, Tony leaned back against his bike and continued to watch him, pulling out another cigarette from God only knows where and tucking it in his mouth.
“Being creepy?” Tony finished, raising an eyebrow. Steve’s cheeks burned, and he sat up and got ready to leave, but then Tony just sighed and rolled his eyes. “God, just come inside, Steve. You don’t need to sit on guard.”
“Do you know this guy?” Thor asked Tony, who just looked at him with a confused face, “I found him in the middle of the dancefloor, and he seemed pretty distressed-”
“Let’s go save the universe,” Tony said in the end, nodding his head once, “before Scott accidentally turns himself into a baby.”
One day, maybe he’d get to put something else a little permanent on Tony, in the region of his left hand. But man- until then, he really did wish he’d been around during the time when the tattoo was too.
“Hey, hey, enough of that,” Steve told him, his voice concerned as he ran his fingers through Tony’s hair soothingly, “you don’t need to promise me something like that. This is a difficult time for you. The memories are closer to the surface. Harder to control-“
Steve laughed, taking Tony’s hands and kissing the palms, before wrapping his arms around Tony’s waist and pulling him in, pressing his face to Tony’s stomach. “Happy birthday,” he said again.
Tony turned, noticing Steve as he stared. He didn’t make a comment, though, he just smiled and shook his head again. Steve knew what he was thinking, because the same thing was running through his mind, too.
“And you’re hungry, so it’s probably making you cranky. Now go sit on my bike and wait, I need to grab a jacket.”
He swallowed, blinking rapidly and checking the clock. He could just call it an end to the lesson, really, it was pretty much over. And that particular question was currently hitting a little too close to home for him to be comfortable with it.
Tony smiles at him, because he can’t really form words right now, and Steve’s whole face just splits into the biggest and most genuine smile Tony’s ever seen.
And, to make matters worse, Bruce barged back in through the door a few seconds later with a look on his face that told Tony that although their friends were miles away, their enemies were not. The man had small flecks of snow in his hair, and the wind gushed in behind him. A new round of snowfall was on its way.
Hotel and cab booked, tickets sorted, overnight bag packed. He was ready to go at a moment’s notice. He’d even pre-written his letter of apology to the others, in case he didn’t have time to say goodbye.
Natasha glared at him. “I don’t care whether you had it or not,” she snapped, even though he heard Clint mutter ‘you damn well did not’ under his breath, “I didn’t do it for you. I did it for me. Because they were owed a punch in the mouth.”
Steve turned his eyes back on Tony, and a second later his mouth ticked upward in fondness as the thought struck him.
Turning to glance back at his friends, he watched their troubled faces stare back at him for a moment before following on behind, keeping their distance and muttering to each other about things Steve couldn’t hear.
But Tony knew that he sure as well was not giving him back to the person who'd left him there. Not a chance.
The man turned under his grip, eyes wide in surprise. Tony’s soul spilled out through them, the animation behind the irises fantastic and beautiful, the emotion dancing, fluid, in motion.
Steve would happily spend the rest of his life right where he was: hands and mouth and body on Tony’s, learning every inch of his skin.
Steve was so caught up in the fact that he’d just heard Tony speaking perfect Italian that he didn’t even notice Peter Parker staring at him. It was only when Peter cleared his throat and chucked a pen at Tony’s head that Steve jerked out of his brief stupor, watching Tony turn around and spot him on the other side of the room.
Steve looked down again. On the paper, a half-formed smile that belonged to his childhood best friend stared back at him, the words from earlier still running around in his head. They’d never found a body, apparently. Despite the fact that the trainline was still in operation and he couldn’t have fallen far from it, they’d never found….
knew that much. “Touché,” he muttered in the end, leaving it at that. He couldn’t see up above him, but he imagined that Steve was probably smiling triumphantly. He always did, when Tony accepted defeat. The asshole.
Tony nudged his shoulder and when Steve turned, he pointed quietly to Clint, who had fallen asleep splayed out on the floor. Natasha had her feet rested on his butt, and she was leaned back against Bucky’s chest as they both kissed intently, apparently having given up on Steve’s rules half an hour ago. Thor and Jane were doing much the same in the corner of the room, and Sam appeared to have overdosed on both popcorn and mead, because he had curled himself into Bruce’s blanket fort and was currently snoring lightly against Bruce’s leg.
Tony glanced back down at Peter. The hood of his sleep-suit was up and covering most of his forehead and part of his eye, and Tony gently pushed it back with a finger, pulling a face when Peter caught his eye. And if Tony hadn’t known any better, he could’ve sworn the six-month old managed to look unimpressed by it.
you so much,” he mumbled, and Steve couldn’t see, but he’d bet their joint fortune that Tony was pouting at that moment.
“Okay, first movie over, second round of mead begins,” Clint declared, reaching for another bottle. A unanimous round of agreement rose around the room, and various people crawled from various spots in the room to reach the bounty pile in the centre of the rrug and pull bottles from its depths. Steve grabbed one, then looked to Tony in question, but the boy shook his head.
They both jumped out of the Jeep, turning to look up at the farmhouse ahead of them. Steve glanced sideways and gauged Tony’s reaction slightly nervously, wondering what he was thinking. But it didn’t seem to be anything bad—if anything, Tony looked pleased. He chuckled quietly and then shut his eyes, taking in a deep breath. “Fuck, it’s been a while since I couldn’t smell gasoline every time I inhaled. Is this what it feels like to breathe non-polluted air?”
“Can we see your badge, please?” He asked politely, putting on all his Captain America charm instead. “Or any other proof of identity will be fine, thank you.”
Steve blushes, rubbing absently at a streak of black paint that’s running across the length of his forearm. “It helps. Painting. Painting you, actually. You like it?”
She sighed, but hopped off the sofa and then toddled up the stairs all the same, Tony watching her until her feet had disappeared before turning back to Steve. “What’s happened.”
“ I know you might think it’s weird and forward or whatever, but a) fuck the stereotypes, just as a matter of principle more than anything, and b)-” Tony’s hand tightened briefly around Steve’s as he shrugged in an attempt at nonchalance that, in Steve’s opinion, didn’t work out for him very well, “you shouldn’t be alone on your birthday, Steve. That just sucks. You… you deserve better than that. You deserve someone to be there with you.” He shrugged again, biting his lip, “and I know I’m not like, y’know, this Special Thing or whatever, and really you should have someone better here for you, but at the moment everyone else is asleep and-”
by how painful that is to think about. How stupidly attached he’s become, not only to the Birdbrain, but the whole damn team. Remembering Clint, sat still and silent on the top of the tower with a half-empty bottle of whatever-the-fuck in his hand and an empty look in his eyes… it haunts him.
With an irritated huff, he rolled into sitting position and yawned, grabbing a ratty hoodie from the foot of his bed before stumbling out into the hall and down the stairs. He could see not one, but two heads through the frosted glass of the door ahead, and frowned sleepily.
, he didn’t know where to turn. There was no-one he could talk to who’d believe him, not even for a second. Because it just wasn’t what Steve did. Everyone knew that.
They both paused. “Doesn’t have quite the same ring to it as the phrase you were gonna say,” Tony admitted, a tired grin tugged half-heartedly at his lips. He leaned further into Steve’s side, unwilling to let himself wish that Steve had just said the damn word. Even if it was stupid. Obviously, he hadn’t got it from his dad, because Peter was not… but still. It was nice to deal in hypotheticals, occasionally.
But he also knew that sometimes, Steve could still feel the sensation of Bucky slipping through his grasp. That Natasha smelt the blood that had once covered her hands, and Bruce could still hear the screams of terror that he’d invoked.
“Steve.” Tony grabbed his shoulders and pulled him back so they were facing each other. “The police won’t listen to you. You have no evidence. And you’re in no state to go back out there and get it. You leave now, and they’ll hunt you down.”
“I think Thor’s got him for now,” Steve explained, running a finger across his browbone tiredly, “least until his parents come back.”
“Well, lucky for you, the matter has already been dealt with,” Tony told them firmly, giving his own smile as he lifted his hands placatingly, “we did temporarily have a child in our custody, but the mother came back for him the next day. Seemed to have had a change of heart, I don’t know, and honestly, I don’t really care. Kids aren’t exactly any of our forte’s, if you haven’t noticed.”
“Don’t you dare try and lie about this,” Steve said, now sounding properly angry, and Tony heard him stand up behind him as well, “you dote on that boy and you fucking know it, so don’t just try and lie through your teeth and expect me to believe it.”
“Steve, I’ve been in love with you since I was twelve,” Tony told him blankly, squinting at him even though it hurt like a bitch, “I kind of thought you knew, if I’m being honest.”
Tony laughed, and God, it really was a nice laugh. “I do,” he agreed, “and that is the most endearing thing in the world.” He paused, before adding, “actually no- the face you’re making right now is the most endearing thing in the world.”
He sighed and looked away, searching for Clint or maybe Natasha. They waited around for him sometimes. But the parking lot seemed woefully empty, save for Tony and his group of friends. He could see one or two of them staring at him, but he didn’t look up; just hitched his bag up a little higher and began the walk to school. No doubt Tony would follow a few hours later. Or maybe he wasn’t going to come in at all- just meet his friends, grab some more of whatever they were taking and then wander off into New York on his own again-
the Wrecking Crew on the loose in the city. Happy was more than capable of looking after him for an hour or two, anyway.
“Mah!” Peter bounced up and down on his butt impatiently, and with a roll of his eyes, Tony gently picked him up and slotted him against his hip, watching as Peter began to wave his crayon around again.
He heard his name breathed out on Tony’s mouth, but pushed ahead fearlessly, kissing Tony softly before continuing. “Then on my first day at school, I see you, and something just… happens. I can’t describe it. But whenever I’m looking at you, or talking with you, or you’re kissing me- I just remember how it feels to… to feel. More than just on the surface. It’s something I genuinely didn’t think I’d be able to do again; but of course, you come along and suddenly I’m acting like a thirteen-year-old with her first crush. It’s mostly just embarrassing, but it’s also kinda nice, I suppose,” Steve laughed a bit, and their noses brushed as Tony shook his head and grinned back, tired and rough and perfect.
“Sir,” JARVIS called out into the room, pulling Tony’s gaze away from the mug and up to the ceiling, “a police report has just broken that I think could pertain to this case at hand.”
“FUCK!” He yelled, head turning in search of the voice before the tone registered in the back of his mind and he frowned, “wait- JARVIS, is that you?”
He was not disappointed. Although obscured by the couch, Tony didn’t fail to miss the cone-shaped blanket that poked upward and told him there was a God of Thunder wrapped underneath, and he shook his head fondly as he wandered further in. Thor was hunched up on the couch, his pale blue blanket swaddled around his midsection and head and leaving a trail of sheets flowing around him. He stared vacantly at the large screen up ahead, which was showing the cartoon animals beating each other up in a way only very young children and, apparently, Thor, found amusing, and his mouth was hung open vacantly while his hand remained half-extended sideways, pulling Peter back by the shirt every time the boy started to crawl too close to the edge of the armrest.
“I mean that, you know,” Steve said, and Tony realised he may just have been quiet for a moment too long, because Steve’s face had turned serious, “you’d be fantastic. Just seeing you with Peter proves that much.”
The door clicked open, and Steve practically fell inside, his feet sliding clumsily over the marble porch. He sprinted down the length of the room, heading for the stairs and then bounding up them two at a time. Goddamn Thor’s apartment—had to be on the top floor, didn’t it? He didn’t slow down though; instead just pushing through the tightening in his chest and keeping up the pace until he arrived. He didn’t need to bother pounding on the door, because Thor had already left it open, so Steve jogged inside, looking around the spacious apartment.
