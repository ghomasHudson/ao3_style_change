“Nothing.” Sherlock gestures vaguely towards the door. “Get the lights and come back to bed with me.”
for it.
Sherlock retrieves his phone and earbuds. When he reaches for John’s, John notices that his hands are trembling. John regards him with disbelief, eyes wide. He doesn’t need to look at Greg to see he’s making a similar face.
“Greg can handle anything you need,” Sherlock says, throwing his skates into his bag without even tucking the laces in. “I’ll see you in a couple of days.”
(the guy on the right), and the
Sherlock has pried himself out of his fit over his brother and is now looking at John with that “who is this idiot” expression that John is gradually becoming accustomed to. “Of course you are. We need to let everyone know you’ve arrived and properly announce our intention to make you Olympic champion.”
“You’ve met my sister.”
John attempts to lift his arms, grimaces, and lets them fall back down.
The weeks pass. They practice, and they train, and Sherlock keeps John up at night playing the violin and makes him eat esoteric produce. He disappears occasionally, never for longer than a couple of days, and John gets used to working on his own sometimes. He does a few interviews. Mostly he keeps to himself.
“I have never had any sort of sexual or romantic relationship with Lestrade,” he says. It’s almost a whisper. “And I promise you, I never engaged in doping.”
Sherlock’s eyes flick to John and then back to the visitor. His hands are pressed together as if in prayer and tucked up under his chin. “‘Guest’ implies an invitation,” he says darkly.
to your chest.
“You’re right. We have to work on your quad lutz if you’re going to land it in both programs.”
This sets off another fit of laughter. “My God, how do you make a living off of being constantly unemployed?”
“That’s me.” John takes her offered hand and shakes it.
“You’re insane,” John says.
He had more to say, but it is stopped on his lips by Sherlock pressing a kiss to them, insistent and tender. John lets his eyes drift shut and loses himself in the kiss. He lets Sherlock back him into the door and press the full length of his body to his. It hits him, all at once, for the hundredth time today: he’s at the Olympic Games, and the love of his life is by his side, and they’re going to make love in his room at the Olympic Games. He moans against Sherlock’s mouth, and Sherlock shudders at the sound. All of a sudden the kiss is not slow and tender at all, it’s deep and longing and needy.
“It shouldn’t come from your waist,” Sherlock says. He feels as if his entire sense of being is centered in the palms of his hands and the tips of his fingers, over the sharp bones of John’s hips and taut, stretched muscle. “Your hips should be like syrup.”
“A retinal scanner, even.”
. Sherlock gasps, drawing in a deep, shuddering breath as he crests the last wave into orgasm. His whole world narrows to the acute, exquisite sensation in the peak of his chest and then bursts outwards, encompassing the tight, hot pressure and friction in his pelvis and the roiling movement in his gut as his child—John’s child, their child—fidgets and stirs in response to her father’s heart rate and exertion and (Sherlock likes to think, in the deepest throes of sentimentality) the volume of his love for her, and for John, and for them. He comes, shuddering and bucking, with a deep, guttural cry. John holds Sherlock’s hips so that he doesn’t dislodge himself and keeps up with long, deep pushes of his cock.
“Get up. We’ve landed.”
“Or what?”
John sticks his tongue out, then flops over sideways onto the couch, Sherlock’s spare iPad in hand and a PDF of the ISU handbook open on the screen.
Greg Lestrade? John swallows.
John goes to bed tired in that satisfying way. Then comes the next morning.
“Pretty sure, yeah.”
John just shakes his head.
“You’re skating like you’re afraid,” Sherlock says with perfect calm. “When’s the last time you fell learning a step sequence?”
“He wasn’t born with those deep edges.
, for the curious.
The music begins with a sharp trill from the violin followed by a complicated run, underlined with staccato chords from the piano underneath. It then launches into a liquid, decidedly Latin melody line led by the violin, with the piano acting as accompaniment. A light percussion line keeps rhythm in the background.
“My—sorry?”
Using his hands, Sherlock leads John’s hips back and forth.
John laughs. “Of course you don’t. I’d been junior national champion the last two years, so I remember it. You were thirteen years old and you skated like...like nothing I’d ever seen before. I couldn’t even be angry I didn’t win, because my best couldn’t match up to yours. The artistry, the huge, incredible jumps, the sheer thought that went into designing your program. When I found out you’d choreographed it yourself I couldn’t believe it at first, because who could be all of that at once? But then, at the same time, you performed it like it was part of you, so it didn’t take me long to believe it. We stood on the podium—you were so small that even on the higher step, we were the same height. And I remember thinking…” John shakes his head. “I thought, ‘Wow, he’s going to be something.’”
John pulls the comforter up over the both of them and moves in close. “Yes. We do.”
“I have to go,” Sherlock blurts.
“Are you still at it?” John calls from the couch.
You play such sweet
“Yes, down the hall to the right. Go ahead and get unpacked.” Sherlock straightens and runs his fingers through his hair. “I, er, used it for storage a bit. The place came furnished, so there’s a bed and such. I can
Sherlock’s tango. More than that, even; Sherlock suspects he might even love it. And he takes to the choreography like a duck to water. He’d learned the Heroes choreography naturally, it being a style he is used to and feels comfortable in. But this? This he devours, consuming every extension of an arm and all the quick, intricate footwork.
Yes, John Watson is certainly desirous. Desire is not the problem. Self-control is the problem. Sherlock may not want to admit it, but he’s more fragile just now. He gets out of breath, he nearly doubles over with abrupt pains in his stomach and groin when he moves too quickly, and his hip joints have been almost constantly sore since he reached the third trimester.
In a rush, Sherlock’s eyes are flying open and he is shooting upright and grabbing at the hand holding his wrist.
"How did you notice, then?"
that John briefly bitches about. The strap was apparently famously uncomfortable, and padding it or even soaping it to make it chafe less merited disciplinary action.
Checking in, checking in on the pregnant husband. Very important. Self-control. “How are you?” John asks.
Sherlock nods. His head feels like he’s swimming. What is
“No, I thought we could eat Snickers bars from the vending machine in the lobby. Yes, I brought food.”
“And what path would that be?”
He’s in a spread eagle and in the process of entering the jump when the door to the rink bangs open.
Once again, he fetches the little wooden box from underneath his bed.
And it’s expensive. It’s less so than it could be, since Sherlock is doing so many jobs, but there are Greg’s coaching fees, and ice time, and gym fees, and equipment, and costumes, and physical therapy, all of which has to be paid for.
John shrugs. Sherlock goes to the locker room to his bag, where he packed two paper bags. When he returns, he finds John sitting on the bench next to Molly. They are laughing together about something. He frowns.
“Okay, wonderful, it’s coming along, let’s go.” He takes John’s arm so John is forced to follow him. “Start as if you’re coming out of the combination.”
Oh, God.
It really is fine. John has been surprised at how fine it’s been. It’s a little sore after practices that are heavy on the jumps, but nothing unbearable. Even after he first dislocated it, it was painful, but the pain didn’t last long. It was the inability to hold his weight that had sidelined him in the end. Every doctor and every test had said he had no nerve damage, no torn ligaments or cartilage, no necrosis of the bone. Now that John knows it was all in his head, it’s actually a relief.
“I dabble,” Sherlock says evasively, with a twinkle in his eye.
Sherlock lifts his mouth away for a moment. “Then keep your voice down.” He reaches up and plucks John’s belt open, and then his fly, and then he’s tugging John’s jeans and underwear down and John’s cock is flexing free as John’s head drops back to knock against the door.
“Get changed and get your gear. We’re going to the rink now.”
Sherlock looks up from his phone and tilts his head. “I could if I tried.”
This chapter was unacceptably delayed by my life being absolutely slammed on all fronts. Here we are. This chapter title was actually nearly the fic title, but Working on the Edges is already a skating-related Johnlock fic, and I thought it was too similar. Sherlock's quote here is actually something my coach said when I was whinging about being scared of falling on my butt while working on edgework. My friend who I take lessons with and I were immediately like "damn, that's deep," and I filed it away to use in some gay fanfiction somewhere.
John pulls Sherlock up to his feet and kisses him again. There’s some complicated choreography where they’re each pulling each other’s jeans and underwear down and stepping out of their own, and then they do have to step apart to strip off their sweaters. Finally, gloriously, they are naked, and John is crowding Sherlock into the bed.
John hears Sherlock a few times: shuffling sounds, a few curses, occasional violin music. He had seen the violin lying carelessly about, and Sherlock mentioned that he played, but John hadn’t heard him before this. It’s beautiful, virtuosic if he’s being honest. He supposes he shouldn’t be surprised. Sherlock does nothing by halves. Of course he’s a genius at this too.
He pulls his hand out and wipes lube over his cock, then lines up against Sherlock’s entrance.
“You want to take an athlete who has, basically, been cryogenically frozen for the last seven years and you think you’re going to get him—”
“Let’s just do a Moulin Rouge medley and use most of the tango song from that.”
“Some people are just intense,” John replies. His voice has gone very calm and still.
John leans back unto his knees, takes Sherlock’s calf in his hand, and pushes his leg up to a ninety degree angle. “Like this?”
“How was it?” comes a voice from the darkness.
“No,” Sherlock has to admit.
John’s mouth has gone dry. His entire life, he’s lived either with family or with, well, James, who was practically family. And James always kept their coaching relationship to the rink. From the sounds of it, this relationship is going to penetrate every corner of his life. Is he prepared for that? He looks sideways at Sherlock, and thinks about how it felt to land his axel.
“To the Olympics, yes.” Sherlock is still tapping away on his phone. “And you aren’t just going. You’re going to win.”
in the harness, John who Sherlock told to fall off the edge and who threw caution to the wind and did it. It’s John on the top of the podium at Nationals in 2010, in January 2018, at Pyeongchang. It’s the look on John’s face when they hang the gold medal around his neck. It’s John triumphant.
But Sherlock can handle it. He takes more music editing jobs, and nutrition and fitness consulting jobs, and dips into the savings from his skate design work. And when all that fails, he steps up his other business, the one John cannot know about.
“Again.”
“Quiet. You’re going to jinx me.”
Jesus CHRIST this is late, and even then I had to cut it in half. First there was Gridlock, and then there was moving back to school...but really, a lot of this is just me buying Starcraft II and discovering Heroes of the Storm
Sherlock speeds up, takes him a little deeper.
John pushes it further back, and further back, until it’s all the way back. “Jesus,” he breathes.
Sherlock puts his phone down, sits up straighter in his seat, and looks dead ahead at the road. “Tell me, John, whose capabilities are you doubting? If the answer is mine, turn around right now. I cannot accomplish anything if you do not have absolute faith in me.”
John starts to look at him curiously, and finally asks, “Hey, are you okay? You look tired.”
“On-ice for another two hours, and then we’re going to the gym. How familiar are you with the Gyrotonic system?”
“Do you edit music for other skaters?”
Greg points to the athletes as he names them. “This is Molly Hooper, here from Canada.” The blonde girl gives a shy little wave. “Sally Donovan, from France.” The black woman nods stiffly. “And Philip Anderson, American.” The bearded man does not even a nod, only tightening the corners of his mouth in what might have been intended as a smile. “I’ve got other students, but these are the ones you’ll probably be sharing ice with most often.”
Sherlock scoffs. “Sleep is boring.”
The map app on John’s phone directs him to take the exit onto another highway. He does so. “What are you, then, my coach?”
“You could call it helpful, I suppose,” John mutters. “This is stupid. I’m not competing in a popularity contest. Why can’t I just skate?”
Sherlock frowns at his screen. He is perched in the chair in the living room, his laptop balanced on his knees. He is on his ninth “Top Tango Songs” playlist, and he is still coming up short.
Through the haze of pain and ecstasy, Sherlock hears himself letting out brief little cries every time John stabs his hips forward. It jolts his pelvis and strains his already-overworked back, and it
“God,” says John, shuddering. “I can’t imagine what that was like.”
“I was getting ready to fuck you, you ass.”
“Oh thank God please yes oh my God,” Sherlock says all in a rush, and takes himself in hand.
John blinks. “I...sorry?”
John goes to bed still stuck on the idea of Sherlock with someone. His imagination has moved beyond trying to put him in cafes with pretty girls or boys and towards standing at someone’s front door, giving them a kiss good night. The image doesn’t play at all when it’s Sherlock and a woman, but a man, wiry and athletic and attractive? It’s less unthinkable.
As the sun comes up, Sherlock finishes the final measure. He allows himself a satisfied smile. Just a little while longer. He’s nearly there. It’s just the editing and the recording now. How long can that take? He has the ultimate power over his body.
Sherlock bites his lip. “I’ve never shared anything in my life.”
“Don't laugh!” he says again, with a sour scowl.
“You’re a Kanye fan?”
“I’ve got johnwatsonskate saved for you on Twitter and Instagram,” Mary singsongs, waving her iPhone.
Sherlock sits beside John and unpacks his food. It’s the same thing that’s in John’s lunch bag: water, a few slices of low-fat cheese, and a sandwich consisting of whole grain bread, turkey, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and mustard.
John sheds his clothes down the hall. Sherlock, though, waits until they get to the bed before he pulls his worn t-shirt up and over his head. The elastic of his pajama bottoms is slung low, below his gravid stomach. John eyes it and licks his lips.
“Yeah,” John says, not sounding the least bit ashamed. He caresses Sherlock’s belly, skating his fingertips over the dark grooves of his stretch marks, flattening his palm over the skin so stretched that it shines. “I have completely ruined you, haven’t I?”
. Don't be intimidated; immersion is the best way to learn everything. Or you can just follow my
“Did Sherlock fall this much this hard when he was training his quad lutz?”
He squeezes Sherlock’s arse one last time, just to make him gasp. “Bed.”
The visual reference for Bakerfield Hall is Haddon Hall. You can
Sherlock makes a frustrated sound, but doesn’t argue. “Fine, bed. Help me up. And don’t laugh.”
“Why? He’s got an excellent lutz, and he’s coached by the first man to land the first ratified quad lutz and the man who coached the man who landed the first ratified quad lutz. The circumstances are ideal.”
“Well, as long as I’m stuck here, I might as well watch something. Have you got Netflix?”
At the curb outside the airport, Sherlock goes to a silver sedan parked there and knocks on the trunk, which pops open. He puts his and John’s things inside and gets into the passenger’s seat without a word. John supposes this is the ride and climbs into the back. There’s just room next to a jumbled pile of books and empty takeout containers.
Sherlock’s face twists in disgust.
“You’ve got the stamina.”
“Good. You’re going to work jumps with Greg today while I work through the choreography. He’ll probably put you on harness while you get the quad lutz so he feels more
As soon as he’s stepped into his mohawk to prep for the salchow, John’s nerves settle. His last thought is wordless, just the general sensation of the throwing of caution to the wind, and then he has no thoughts at all.
Sherlock heaves a tragic sigh. “Fine.”
“Um,” says John. “Guest?”
John cracks his eyes open. It turns out not to hurt. “What time is it?” Speaking also does not hurt.
“I will be filling a number of roles.”
Grade of execution, or GOE, is part of the technical portion of a score. An element has a base value of points (8.5 for a triple axel, for instance) from which points are added or subtracted based on how well you do it. An element has to check off certain bullets to qualify for a GOE level. Two bullets is a +1, four is a +2, and six or more is a +3. If you’re curious, you can scroll down to
He ruffles a hand through Sherlock’s hair. “Hold on, wait.”
John raises his eyebrows.
“Now,” he says, “about that bed.”
Sherlock tries, but when he shifts his weight to his left leg, it trembles and collapses underneath him.
“Recall, if you will, what I said regarding my sense of humor.”
Also, FUN FACT: penny-locking a door is totally a thing you can do. Fun prank to play, though here it is being put to the cause of temperance/studying up for your case instead of fucking your mistress. My dad always did it to us with just the one penny.
“You need to warm up before we get on the ice,” Sherlock says. “What’s your usual routine?”
Finally, after ninety minutes of practice, Sherlock says, “We ought to take a break.”
“Sherlock,” Greg says disapprovingly.
“Sherlock, this is his first practice in over half a decade,” Greg says. “We don’t want to start with triples.”
“No.”
John nods tightly.
“Mm.” Sherlock stirs and pushes back into John’s erection. Fuck it. If his body is to be destroyed, he might as well let his husband get off to it. “John, hold my leg up. I can’t lift it.”
John cups both his hands over Sherlock’s belly, then slides them back, around his sides to his back and then down, fingers dipping into the waistband, moving further down, catching it with his thumbs, and peeling the whole thing down, down, down…
John looks skyward with a silent plea to the heavens. “Your...spare bedroom.”
“I’ve linked information about them in the Google doc. I’ve already shared it to you.”
“It’s the Olympics. Half the athletes’ village has company tonight.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Remember,” Sherlock calls, “you’ve already landed it.”
And then, Sherlock Holmes did the most extraordinary thing. His eyes flicked down and up once, looking me over, and then he took me apart.
“Sometimes.”
Treble notes of
John says softly, “I believe you.”
He shuts the door of his room behind him and takes a moment to giggle, before clapping a hand over his mouth.
“Well then
A drop of clear liquid leaks from the slit of Sherlock’s cock, and it makes John’s mouth water.
work, work that makes him feel alive like he hasn’t in years. It’s draining, yes, but he has his ways of coping with that. During the day, there is practice and training, and at night, there is his consulting work. He hasn’t been bored in months.
John growls and slams in to make Sherlock cry out. “Good,” he snarls. “Keep you here. Keep you. You’re
“Um,” he says. “Exactly how—”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock really is interested. It’s no time at all before he’s squeezing John’s waist and sighing into his mouth, the unsteady shifting of his hips taking on a rhythm and an intent.
From the living room, a door opens. “Who the hell are you?” says the unmistakable voice of Harry Watson.
“If you’re quite finished disparaging me,” Sherlock says in a pained voice, “could we get on the road?”
“The air here is drier,” Sherlock says. “You’ll need to hydrate more.”
As I passed, I heard the distant strains of a violin. I had not heard music in some time, not since long before coming to Bakerfield. Curious, I tentatively approached the chapel door and stepped inside as quietly as I could.
It’s a good thing he’s on his side, because Sherlock may actually have blacked out for a moment. Just a moment, though. And really, he could just as easily have been drifting for reasons unrelated to his consciousness. Yes, that must be what is happening.
as the music
The yoga, at first, does not help. But after the first few miserable poses, John finds that it is improving. His situation improves substantially after a very cold shower, and by the time he is finished with breakfast (a delightfully spicy breakfast quesadilla with spinach and white beans) he finds that he can move without pulling a face, if not completely comfortably.
“You don’t have much to pack, so we should be able to manage by ourselves,” says Sherlock. “It shouldn’t take more than two hours to get to Philadelphia at this time and with your driving, so we should be at the airport by one AM. You will need to sleep, I assume.”
Sherlock ignores him. He goes to the pantry, grabs a bag of Sun chips, and retreats into his room again.
Now, for the pretty pictures of Victorian uniforms! John, as a captain, would qualify for small amounts of the decoration that Regency uniforms were famous for, though at this point they had gotten more muted. I have for you some visual references (read: sexy fucking clothing) for the
Sherlock is true to his word. John does not see him for two days.
Harry’s shoulders stiffen for a second. John spreads his stance very slightly, just enough to brace if she does what she sometimes does. But Harry doesn’t. Instead, she slumps, and shuffles to the side, clearing the doorway. John marches forward, wrenches the door open, and leaves. Sherlock follows.
“What’s Netflix?”
John spends his morning working with Greg and by himself. It’s an interesting change. What with Sherlock having only John to work with, John generally has someone coaching him at all times. He feels slightly unmoored without anyone giving him feedback. But by the end of the session, he has worked what he knows he needs to work on (mostly the hateful loop, which he has successfully dodged having to do in his short but will have to include in his free program) and is loose and relaxed.
“Put your foot down so I can do the other.”
tobacco
“I can see that.” John smiles at him. Sherlock can’t look straight at it. John’s smile makes something in Sherlock’s stomach do a funny little flip, and he needs to focus on the work.
John chews and swallows before he gapes at Sherlock. “You made your own mustard recipe?”
“That’s amazing. And this mustard is fantastic.”
John wipes sweat off his forehead with the back of his hand. “I’m good.”
—the way his ribcage lifts and spreads, stretching and straining against the taut, firm curve of his belly. A powerful surge of lust spreads red over John’s vision. He plants his feet, draws up his knees, and bucks up just as Sherlock plunges down. Sherlock’s back arches at the sudden stab of sensation, which in turn increases the angle of penetration and lets John drive that much deeper. He cries out, too, and it may be from more pain than pleasure but oh, fuck, John is already past the point where he’s willing to put his moral code above Sherlock’s desires to throw caution to the wind.
Sherlock plugs in the charger and his sleek, slate gray headphones, navigates to Youtube, and taps in “John Watson SP US Champs 2010.” This far back, USFSA doesn’t really care to send the DMCA takedown requests, so the video is easy to find. There is only one, and it only has around 10,000 hits. The video loads, then Sherlock hits pause and scrolls down to the comment section.
Sherlock is throwing his bag to the side and rushing onto the ice without even putting his skates on. John’s anger at someone startling him mid-jump evaporates as soon as Sherlock steps onto the ice and starts doing an awkward sort of shuffling slide to get to him. He looks like a limping penguin. Greg snorts.
“Fuck, that’s gorgeous,” he growls.
It's been a million years since I updated, so you get a novel of an author's note. Sorry.
This was a beefy boy, folks. It's the first part of what was initially going to be one chapter, but which I realized I should definitely, definitely split into two. As ever, constructive criticism is welcome, as I am my own beta.
Sherlock doggedly fights his fading body as the night wears on, forcing his body to keep pace with the music in his head. In the wee hours of the morning, he reaches the final stretch. This section picks up again, but it is no longer about Sherlock’s nebulous emotions, or about John alone. It’s about John with Sherlock, John doing a triple axel just because Sherlock told him to, John who can’t land a jump unless he’s
It’s more languid now, and easier. It is not Sherlock, it’s John. Not the John on the ice, but the John on the sofa watching college basketball, the John doing yoga with Sherlock at 5:30 in the morning, the John who tells Sherlock he is amazing. It is, a tiny bit, flirtatious, because this is a John who has never seen a pretty girl and didn’t look a second time.
The driver turns around and holds out a hand. “Morning, John. Nice to meet you.”
Small note: between this chapter and the last, I changed the sort of coach John and Sherlock are using to get to London. I implied they were traveling by stagecoach last chapter and have since done more research and found that traveling from Derbyshire to London by post, or post chaise, is more doable than I thought on first research, and far more appropriate for men of the Holmes's station. Correct me if I'm wrong there. You all were so helpful with my question on names for the Holmes boys! I used your info to address it a bit in this chapter, and managed to slip in some SWEET GAY VICTORIAN FLIRTING alongside as my little thank-you.
Passive tense. Nice. “And equipment? Costumes? Transportation? Personal training?”
“Yes, very nice, we’re all just the best of friends,” Sherlock says impatiently. “Let’s all just go out for tea and biscuits and forget all about our jobs.”
John’s mouth moves without his permission. “When you’ve fallen off of it.”
“Okay,” he says. “Which is easier for you?”
“Oh, I’ve heard this,” John says in an undertone. “This is the Bowie cover from that Netflix show.”
Of course he falls. On the ice, he thinks back through the jump. Was that four full rotations? Did his blade come down cleanly backwards?
“Please, you have to.”
“Sixty-nine,” Sherlock mutters.
“You don’t understand,” Sherlock pleads. God, why is his voice so high and weak? Why is it breaking like this? Where has his control gone? “It isn’t like that, it wasn’t ever like that.”
The Timberland boots are the biggest problem. John tries to toe them off while kissing Sherlock and fails miserably. Eventually Sherlock gives up, kneels at John’s feet, and starts untying the laces.
“This is yours,” Sherlock says, handing the bag to John.
“Get the harness,” says Greg.
John winces. If this is how people talk when they openly tag Sherlock into the conversation, how do they talk about him when they’re not expecting him to see?
“Fine.”
As soon as the words are out, John is terrified he’s made a huge miscalculation. Here he is with someone who’s basically a stranger, and he called him a jackass. God, why does he even step outside his door? He looks sideways at Sherlock to gauge his reaction. To his surprise, Sherlock has a broad grin on his face. John can’t help but grin back, and then they’re chuckling, and then laughing.
It isn’t until later that night, when Sherlock finally allows himself to lower his exhausted, wrung-out body into bed, that he finds himself unable to shake the unnatural warmth in his chest and hands when he thinks about practice that day.
“Mary Morstan,” she says. “I do publicity work for Molly and some of the other athletes here.”
Sherlock claps his hands together. “Excellent. Let’s discuss the quad lutz.”
Also, please, leave any concrit you've got!
Sherlock plays the emotions into existence, the unnameable, unidentifiable, red, roiling bile in his stomach. He plays until his wrist creaks and his elbow is sore and his fingers have indentations in them from the strings, and when he knows he has played the right notes into existence, he hurriedly jots them down.
“Maybe we should make Anderson retire for seven years,” Sherlock says. “Perhaps then he could come back and land a jump with four full rotations.”
Not until the elevator doors close behind them does Sherlock say through gritted teeth, “There was a problem with our reservation.”
Sherlock grimaces.
“Definitely. He acts like he’s a mathematician, but he gets reckless when he’s frustrated.”
I know, bad writer, doesn't update for over a week and then posts barely 1k words. In my defense, I suffered not just a one-two punch, but a one-two-three punch of health problems: first my physical health, then my cat's health, then my mental health. One of these things is connected to the other two. I bet you can't work out which. In any case, the kitty is home and doing much better, I can breathe, and I've got the brain shit...well, that bit's not much better, but such is life.
“He lives,” John remarks.
One sunny May day, when John has not seen Sherlock since two nights before, he comes home, lets himself into the apartment, and finds a strange man in a suit sitting on the sofa, looking impassively at Sherlock, who is perched in an inhuman pretzel shape on his chair.
Sherlock scrolls down to the related videos and taps the one for John’s free skate. The performance is gorgeous. John’s stamina is evident in his consistency throughout the program. His jumps in the later part of his program are every bit as solid as those in the first part.
“Cleveland, 2009,” John says.
, what the
Sherlock sighs tragically. “John, give her your number so you can coordinate an announcement.”
As ever, constructive criticism is welcome. I do all the editing on this, so I'm sure I miss some things.
By the time the sun has gone down, he has the rough draft of the first third down. The middle section brings him up short. It needs to mellow here, he knows. It requires a different energy.
John gets to his feet. “Alright, alright. Give it here.” He holds out his hand for the earbuds.
—but God, it feels far, far too good to stop. He whines through his teeth.
John hastily zips up his suitcase, swings his backpack on, and hurries down the hall. Harry is leaning back against the door, eyeing Sherlock with something between bewilderment and anger. Sherlock has one finger up in the unmistakable sign for “just a minute.”
For your perusal, I can now offer you this
If possible, Sherlock blushes even pinker. “I consider myself to be far better on the violin.”
Figure skating fans, don’t @ me for not assigning John to Skate America! Non-fans and newer fans, as best I understand it, generally, skaters get a GP assignment for the competition in their country. So a Japanese skater would be assigned to NHK Trophy, a Canadian to Skate Canada, and John, an American, to Skate America. But there is Someone I don’t want John meeting who definitely needs to be at Skate America, and also if Yuri on Ice can get away with not assigning Yuuri Katsuki to NHK Trophy, then I can do what I want.
As soon as the door shuts behind him, Sherlock explodes out of his chair. “That interfering prat!”
“Better,” Sherlock says. “Let’s talk about clarity and control.”
“I have been informed as much on numerous prior occasions, so consider me well aware.”
“We can wait until tomorrow, at least. I know you’re about to take him to the gym and run him into the ground.”
Also, as a fun figure skating side note, the real life figure skating world keeps supporting the ridiculous stuff I do in this fic. For instance, Daisuke Takahashi has just announced he's coming out of retirement after four years at the age of 32! However, it looks like he will actually be skating at his regional competitions, unlike John Watson, who is written by a lazy writer and who is skipping those for convenience purposes.
“Bedside drawer,” Sherlock says smugly.
Sherlock is suddenly, intensely aware of what John is wearing: joggers and a tight, long-sleeved shirt that cling close to him and do little to disguise the lines of his body. His mouth goes dry.
“I mean, clearly we have a room.”
“Better,” Greg calls.
John skates one circuit around the rink. As he’s approaching his coaches, he breathes out. He can do this. He can do a lutz, he can do a quad, what’s both of them combined?
“That’s Irene Adler, right?” John says.
“Did you hear he went to rehab for six months after they banned him?” says Philip.
At Sherlock’s discomfort, yes, but also at his ungainliness. He is fat and bloated and cumbersome,
“Don’t worry about the money.”
“What kind?”
“I can’t believe I was ever afraid you were a top.”
“I haven’t been able to fully stock my kitchen yet,” Sherlock says, “so you may find meals somewhat repetitive for the first week until I can get the necessary ingredients in. It doesn’t bother me, but I have been made to understand that most people feel dissatisfied without variety in their meals.”
John eyes Sherlock doubtfully. Of particular interest is the rotund, distended, stretched-near-to-popping belly resting on Sherlock's lap.
Sherlock catches Greg’s eye and nods. Greg waves, then calls out to the other skaters.
Sherlock opens his eyes and sees the empty room, absent of judges, of coaches, of anyone, and remembers: this is not for him. This is not his anymore.
“As well you fucking should,” says John.
Sherlock wrinkles his nose. He hates the way it feels, but he does get horribly itchy if he skips it for too long. "If you rub it in."
“You don’t want my name down as your primary coach. It’ll look bad for you. We’ll be working with Lestrade.”
“Thanks! You too.” John is fairly sure he isn’t lying. He hasn’t really paid much attention to anyone else on the ice, outside of making sure he doesn’t run into anybody.

Constructive criticism is welcome! Most especially because this chapter got a little less than the usual editing work.
Anyways, EDITING QUESTION for this chapter/the next: please, let me know if you're following Sherlock's plan. He won't reveal the whole thing at once, because he doesn't, but I do want you, the reader, to get it by the end of the next chapter.
“John,” Sherlock whines, “careful, be careful. I won’t be able to get up tomorrow.” He’s not entirely sure how much he’s playacting at this point, and he’s already almost past the point of caring.
There is a flash of something across their faces, gone too quickly for John to parse what it is. Surprise? Disdain? Probably the latter. They were probably still skating in juveniles when John won his national title.
“Okay,” John says, wiping his forehead with the back of his hand. “Show me what comes next.”
Oh, God, income. With a sinking feeling, he remembers the other major roadblock between competitive skaters and success. He drums his fingers on the steering wheel.
AN: I took a number of liberties with Champs Camp, as I am not an elite-level skater and have thus never been. I know there are some conference-type sessions for athletes and coaches, they get feedback from some judges, and there’s a simulated competition. Also, they make goofy promo videos for the Team USA skaters. I have used bits of this as suit my needs, because I am writing gay porn fanfiction and can do what I want.

Sherlock looks at John and looks deeper. He sees the shabby little house in Pennsylvania and how it had three bedrooms, and how all three of them had twin beds, including the empty room that could only have been Mrs. Watson’s.
Next chapter: the Grand Prix series begins, and we really get into it!
John, already snickering, types the handle in. “Oh my God, your avatar is a picture of Dabin Choi in a flower crown. Did you make that?”
Notes: I’ve started using footnotes in this chapter. I’m probably going to go back and add a couple to previous chapters as well. My goal for them is that they will be unnecessary if you don’t want to read them, but optional extra fun information for people who are curious, or who want visual references. My other, ulterior motive is that you will find the information interesting enough that it enhances your perspective on figure skating, catches your attention, and drags you down into FS fan hell. Join me.
“It is,” says John, defensive.
Anger flares hot in John’s face. “What did you expect, Harry? You wanted me to stay here for you to shout at?”
and pomade.
“I see my reputation precedes me.”
“You, so—full. Of
Sherlock puts out his hand. John takes it with more than a little suspicion, but Sherlock helps him to his feet. John tries again.
“No,” Sherlock says. “These are your games.”
There is a shuffling sound and a grunt from the other side of the door.
Naturally, things go south very soon after that.
John must have woken up some point, because he had to have gotten himself onto the plane. But to the best of his memory, he fell asleep on the floor of the Philadelphia airport and woke to Sherlock shaking his shoulder.
Content warning for drug-related stuff here, folks.
“You’re fighting a losing battle, Mr. Watson,” says Mycroft. “Anyhow, I only wanted to stop by and issue my congratulations to Mr. Watson here.”
,” Sherlock says, looking irritated. “Just ignore it like I do.”
He continuously pushes away thoughts about James, and James’s quiet suggestion that maybe this was it when John couldn’t seem to get his feet back under him. He does not want to think about those wasted years, and what he could have done if someone had said to his face that this was something he could push through. Once the door had been opened for him, he had believed it. And his mother had been sick…
(See the end of the chapter for
“Okay.” Cryptic, but okay.
“What?” John says. “Was that good?”
on china flesh.
And then Sherlock is pressing his mouth
. It’s so quiet at first John has trouble hearing it over the background noise of the bus, but then he makes out the quiet strings. The vocal line comes in, sung by a man with a melodic and slightly rough voice.
“That’s absolutely perfect, Sherlock,” Greg says. “Have you got it choreographed already?”
“Okay. I’ve got an appointment with a physical therapist after practice tomorrow, so no gym. Take a nap. You could use it.”
John looks heavenward. Sherlock still says this on occasion, and John has given up expressing the insanity of the idea. He mentioned it to Greg at one point, expecting Greg to be the voice of sense and reason. Instead, Greg had shrugged, smiled, and said, “You never know what can happen.”
“When it suits my purposes,” Sherlock says.
Sherlock still does not look at him. All he does is briefly shut his eyes in what could be just a long blink, if John didn’t know better.
John grins. “Do they all have personas?”
When skaters are first learning a jump or are adding an additional rotation, they work in a harness. It adds some stability so the skater can get the hang of where their body needs to be without doing the really big, painful falls.
“Not for three hours.”
he forgot, and now John is kneeling beside the couch with Sherlock’s forearm naked in front of him with its telltale red pinpricks at the crook of his elbow and looking not at Sherlock’s face but at that traitorous constellation on his pale skin, his expression blank and pale and hurt.
I have a few exciting visual references for you, if you enjoy that sort of thing.
John makes a sound like he’s dying and wants nothing more than to do just that, just like this. He fucks Sherlock with ferocity and single-mindedness and his teeth in Sherlock's shoulder.
“We were talking about how I got here, which cost what, to you, is a considerable sum. The next logical thought is how you will afford the costs of being an elite athlete, as you are not a wealthy man and sponsorships will be thin on the ground. Hence, I felt it was necessary to reassure you that you don’t need to worry about the money. I will not require a fee for coaching or choreographing, as I am supported by other endeavors. Your expenses will be paid.”
“Oh! Did you bring food?”
“Nothing,” Sherlock says, wiping his eyes. “Just...so much for keeping it down.”
In fact, he is doing his damnedest to keep his eyes off his husband and his softened curves: the small, handful-sized breasts, the almost-imperceptible new color in his cheeks, the shine to his hair, and—most prominently—the dramatic swell of his stomach where he is nurturing their child.
“I need the space for my legs,” he whines.
“Really, absolutely amazing. You did that in two days?”
He doesn’t complain, even.
“I don’t disagree. Unfortunately, publicity is part of the game. If you’re going to Pyeongchang, we need to win at every aspect of that game.”
“Alright, then, I’ll just see what’s on.”
“You’re rather an unusual case,” says Mycroft. “Exceptions can be made based on history, if the argument is made by the proper people.”
“Fine, then, keep scowling at Spotify.”
Sherlock lets out an interrogative, “hm?”
One final note about scores: I am pretty sure these scores check out as reasonable, according to the 2017-2018 ISU rulebook. I've taken some liberties (as I have in many other places in this fic) about some of the more subjective scores, as John would in real life be unlikely to score so high due to some truly irritating tendencies towards reputation scoring. Don't worry,
In silence, John loads his things into the trunk as Sherlock gets into the car. The silence remains unbroken as John punches the directions to the Philly airport into his phone, pulls out of the driveway, and navigates onto the highway.
“Very good,” Sherlock rumbles, in that sinfully deep baritone.
“Nice,” is all John has to say.
“Heard a rumor @sholmes got fired again. Serves him right. Idk why he keeps trying to convince people to let him work with them.”
John runs through his usual routine: a couple of laps around the rink, a little footwork. When he comes back around to Sherlock and Greg, Greg’s expression is neutral, while Sherlock’s is rather more toward the displeased side.
"Love it." So hard to form the words, but for John, he can. "Love it, love—love you—"
skating to In This Shirt have similar feels to what I'm picturing, and Boyang Jin's
Sherlock grunts again, and John snickers.
“I appreciate it,” John says sincerely, and goes about fucking Sherlock properly.
And in his heart of hearts, he knows that’s exactly why he was reluctant in the first place. It’s not just that Sherlock is beautiful and that he’s carrying their child and that John loves him. When John has him like this, he is forced to admit that he is very, very aroused by Sherlock’s
“I know, I’ve talked to the women they tried to put you with for pairs,” John says solemnly, and that makes Sherlock smile. “It’s just...if not for you turning up at that rink in Catawissa, I’d still be sharpening rental skates for birthday parties. You brought me back to life, Sherlock. More than that, even. You brought me to a whole new level of performance that I’d never dreamed was possible even before I got injured.”
John steps back, takes Sherlock’s hands, and hauls him to his feet. Sherlock grunts endearingly at the effort.
“Yes!” Sherlock shouts, as John works through the transition from his first combination into his quad salchow, marking the jumps. “Wait, wait. Come here.”
Sherlock clears his throat, scuttles forward, and starts shuffling some of the books on the coffee table about. “Obviously it could use some, er, tidying up.”
“Sherlock?” John says.
It’s just a kiss at the tip at first, which alone is enough to make John shiver. Then it’s a delicate tongue lapping at the sensitive skin, and a firm but gentle hand at the base to steady it, and finally his mouth, wrapping around John’s cock and sliding slowly back and forth over just the head, soft tonguing around the frenulum.
Next chapter is nearly complete already, so you don't need to wait long!
metronome
Sherlock rises from the bed and stalks towards John, and suddenly John’s mind goes to an entirely different place. “All I have been wanting to do for hours,” Sherlock purrs, “is get that costume onto the floor and have you, all to myself.”
Finally, it is about to no longer be summer, and yet this is VERY far from done. This hasn't been every Sunday for, uh, quite some time, and it's about to be OFFICIALLY not every Sunday. I'm going to shoot for every other Sunday, with posts on
John follows him up the stairs, through another door, and into the living area of a modestly-sized flat.
There are complications to living with John. He is not unobservant, so Sherlock has to take care. He only ever texts his work contacts, never calls. No one ever came to his apartment, so that is safe enough.
"No," John says emphatically.
John guzzles the water down. He finds he’s already thirsty. Probably the recirculated plane air.
“I haven’t the faintest idea of what you’re talking about. Park in the daily lot.”
“Yep. His last coach quit because he took his senior test when she was out of town. She wanted him to wait until he was seventeen and he didn’t, which was the last straw for her. He came to me because he said he knew he needed better control of his jumps and knew I taught good jump technique. That was about the last time he treated me like my opinions mattered.”
John groans. But he stays, and that is something.
John stands straight and clears his throat. “Hello?”
“I’ve never heard of half of these foods.”
“You are. You won’t find your edge until you fall off of it. Come on. Try again.”
“I’ll do my best,” John says grimly.
John pushes off to go into his step sequence—and Sherlock shoves him in the side and knocks him to the ice! Startled and unprepared, he lands sideways, thudding onto his hip. It takes him a moment to shake off the cold clutch of fear. It was a light fall, and his hip is healthy and strong. He’s fine.
“Fine,” Sherlock groused. “Let’s work on your loop.”
Irene becomes a mainstay at the rink for a while, as she’s choreographing for Molly and Donovan. Her work is beautiful, and the music choices suit the athletes while still pushing the limits of what they can do.
John’s mouth moves, and Sherlock wants to turn back time to before this, before he had to see John’s face before he said the words he is going to say.
John’s pulse picks up. He smiles tightly, fetches his water bottle, and takes a long drink.
“Yeah?” John says.
John blanches. “Pardon me?”
Bass notes of
“Touch yourself,” he tells him.
John shrugs and gets out of the car. Sherlock follows.
On the bus to the rink, Sherlock pops an earbud into John’s ear. “I have your short program song.”
She sends back a gold medal emoji, followed by
“Tell me your on-ice warm-up is an improvement on your off-ice,” Sherlock says, when John has skated over to meet him.
John rolls his eyes heavenward. “Unbelievable. I’ll get us a Chromecast tomorrow. Want to watch something?”
Repeatedly slamming oneself onto hard ice and a 4 mm blade with a force of about 10 G’s is not great for the human body, so sometimes athletes will skate through where a jump goes when they’re running their program to try to minimize damage. They do the transition into the jump, the entry, and then the exit. Yuzuru Hanyu is currently rehabbing an injury, and recently did an entire ice show where he did a bunch of his older programs and marked every single jump. People still paid hundreds for tickets. Like I said, there is a LOT to skating that isn’t jumps.
“I don’t even know what it would look like to only go to the gym three times a week,” Sherlock is muttering.
Sherlock, for the first time in his life, has the easy weight advantage on John. It looks like a simple matter to push John back onto the bed, though it appears considerably more complicated climbing up after him.
Sherlock shrugs indifferently. When he first met Sherlock Holmes nearly a year ago, John would have read this as a “no.” Experience has taught him that the closer interpretation is “I thought it was dull, but I watched it for you.” John smiles.
Does John want more? He probably should. He pictures himself in a townhouse in the suburbs, dog and spouse and two kids waiting for him, and feels nothing. What he has is enough.
Sherlock shoves a bottle of water towards him, which John takes.
“I’ve been like this for hours,” Sherlock whispers. Fuck, they’ve barely even started and his voice is already going. “It’s—hormones, or
Sherlock flaps a dismissive hand. “He won’t land a single clean jump unless it’s a triple.”
“Rostelecom Cup in October and NHK Trophy in November,” he says. “Lucky for me you speak Russian and Japanese.”
Bakerfield Hall was my last and only option. In any case, it suited the man I had become. Monsters and madmen belong in such places.
John makes two more passes at it (one fall, one step out) before Sherlock, ever impatient, has decided that’s enough.
“I watch TV,” John says shortly.
Apologies for the delayed update! I had a big move, and then a lot of craziness, but updates should be back to the usual rate (tentatively faster, even?) now that I'm mostly unpacked and settled in.
In the video, the youthful John Watson receives his score, a personal best, and claps his hand over his mouth. His coach jumps to his feet to cheer, then thumps John on the back while John still sits in wordless shock.
“Yes,” says Sherlock, resigned.
“You don’t sleep?”
“I certainly wouldn’t know what you mean,” says Sherlock, trying and failing to look dignified.
Greg grins, and John nearly dies on the spot. “Sorry for the state of the car. I would’ve cleaned, but I had just about no notice you were coming, thanks to His Highness over here.”
“I told you,” says John, tugging him closer, “hadn't even crossed my mind.”
“Darling. Oh, my gorgeous man.”
“Mm,” says Sherlock, from under heavy eyelids.
“Have you seen the ones where they speculate about my relationship with Lestrade?” Sherlock says.
“How are we getting from here to—wherever we’re going?”
Sherlock’s breathing immediately evens out, as if he’s relieved. His head falls back on the pillows. John laughs.
but he forgot,
“Pull your arms in more,” says Greg. “You keep either underrotating or coming close to it.”
“You know about the drugs, right?” Sally says.
“Sorry,” John says eventually.
When he comes to a stop just before where his final spin would come and looks to Sherlock, he finds Sherlock is nodding. John grins.
“Don’t be ridiculous.”
“Really?”
Whatever it is, the information is too slippery to hold. Sherlock lets it go as his mind blurs and sinks into a deep, dreamless sleep.
A few questions in particular about this chapter for you to consider (or not!):
milk and
I should also take this opportunity to review how I am dealing with real-life figure skaters, which is that for the men, at least, I’m largely not. They’re not here. The pairs and dance folks remain untouched. Most of the ladies will also be left alone, although I’ve, ah, cleared a bit of space out in places. However, if I kept the current top men’s singles skaters in here, I would have to justify my characters being better than the Nathan Chens and Yuzuru Hanyus, which is a thing I cannot do.
of your veins.
Greg throws his hands up in the air. “Fine! Fine, what do I know.”
“He does that,” Molly says sympathetically.
When he’s picked himself up and dusted the ice off his pants leg, Greg and Sherlock are both grinning.
The figure skating season technically lasts from July 1 of one year until June 30 of the following. There is a long off-season between the end of Worlds in late March/early April and the start of the major competitions in September. This is when skaters make coaching changes, get new choreography, and so on. Anderson did very badly last season and was done after Nationals, having not made it to Four Continents or Worlds, and started trying out Greg as a coach and Sherlock as a choreographer rather early. Draw conclusions as you will about why Greg might let a new skater try him out when he’s gearing his principal students up for Worlds.
I've taken some liberties with the layout, and most of the interior decorations are mine entirely.
Mycroft does something with his face that might be distantly related to a smile, or perhaps just a smirk. “Why, upon your Grand Prix assignments. You should receive the text tomorrow morning.”
“You have to tell me your handle.”
Greg rolls his eyes at John. “Okay, John. Let’s give it another try.”
Will you sing
Sherlock steps out of his pajamas with a quiet sigh of relief.
“You better follow him, bud,” Greg says, clapping John on the shoulder.
In any case, I am still cranking out about 1000 words per day, so look forward to more frequent updates. Also, remember: this is more or less my zero draft, so
“Excellent. I don’t see a reason why you can’t start learning it now, if you’re game, John.”
“I had no idea you choreographed for so many people,” John says. “I never heard about it or saw you at any competitions.”
There is a stretch of four days of solid work in mid-June. During the daytime hours, Sherlock is with John, going through their usual routine. At night, he is managing his other jobs. He sleeps for no more than an hour or two out of every 24, and eats only the bare necessities. By the fourth day, he has begun to look wan and ragged and his reactions are slowed.
“Yes.”
“Flash in the pan. Too bad.”
good.”
Sherlock is taking him deep now, and John is fighting not to fuck his mouth. He chances a look down and his eyes nearly roll back into his head at the sight–his cock nearly balls-deep in Sherlock’s mouth at its apex, and Sherlock–Sherlock with his own jeans undone and the hand that’s not steadying the base of John’s shaft working himself, and John realizes there’s something else he wants.
The eye contact lasts just long enough to begin to make the hairs on the back of John’s neck start to prickle. It is only broken by a ding from John’s phone. He looks down and grimaces.
Before he even gets to the bus stop, Sherlock has his phone out, his headphones on, and his music transcribing app open. It had struck him all at once. One minute he was watching John flirting with Mary and Molly, and the next he was hearing music.
“Mostly they don’t ‘at’ me, as they put it, or even mention me by name. They make up words that start with the right sounds and it’s generally understood who they mean. Shellshock Homes, Sharkbait Horses. It’s sort of a contest to see who can get the furthest from my actual name and have it still be recognizable. I’m a sort of cautionary tale, you see.”
“Oh. Neat.” John lies back on the couch. “You know, I’m coming round to these. They feel amazing.”
I've been using it to gather clothes, furniture, scenery, and other useful stuff. It's turned into quite a nice collection of early Victorian menswear, decor, and English countryside. Very nice for a certain mood!
Sherlock was supposed to set his alarm to wake him before John came home, so John would not find him asleep on the couch out in the open with his
against John’s gradually thickening erection, and he’s mouthing up and down the outline, and John can’t do anything but run his fingers through Sherlock’s hair and groan.
Sherlock cracks a small smile.
After another half hour has passed, Sherlock says again, “Would you like to take a break now?”
Sherlock’s legs, though, are screaming for a break. John sees him wince and understands.
“Maybe he’s dead,” Greg suggests.
“Mycroft Holmes,” says the man.
“Sprained his ankle.”
“Yes, I thought so.”
“Then you’re not committing. Try again.”
Sherlock grimaces. “I wanted to wait until you medaled, but…” He makes a vague gesture with his hands.
“I’m off to bed,” Sherlock announces.
“You’ll understand when you see your room.”
“Now go get your skates on, you ninny,” Greg tells him.

“You couldn’t, I don’t know, rent a car?”
piece. I’m envisioning more the former for the beginning section, the latter for the middle, and some combination of both for the end.)
She looks from Sherlock to John. John watches as her eyes track from his face, to the backpack slung over his shoulder, to the suitcase in hand behind him. He watches her face morph from confusion, to unambiguous betrayal, to careful blankness.
“Didn’t you watch?” John says, as he strips his gloves and coat off and throws them towards the closet.
John skates away and breathes out. His heart is pounding in his chest. His mind races, but then he turns and lifts his foot to enter the jump and it all goes blank.
“I had to,” John says.
“Please. My position merely connects me with officials across many disciplines.” Mycroft rises, buttons his suit jacket up, and fetches an umbrella that was resting against the arm of the couch. “Now, if you will excuse me, there are discussions to be had about broadcast rights for senior-level events next season.”
“Consulting,” Sherlock says evasively.
, body and mind. Sherlock would do anything for him, as he would do anything for Sherlock. Sherlock will hurt, and he will love it, because he loves John, and because he can and will push past it if that’s what it takes to feel this good.
RL skating references made in this chapter:
Sherlock scrolls down to the related videos and taps the one for John’s free skate. He winces when he sees the title of the music flash up on the bottom of the screen. Turandot? Surely John didn’t choose this music himself. It doesn’t suit him at all. And while John’s short program costume was unexciting but flattering and attractive, his free skate costume is flat-out boring: black pants and a white shirt. Someone probably told him that a simpler costume would keep the viewer focused on his skating. Someone ought to be fired.
He rolls his hips and drags John's hands up his body, one to cup his eminently squeezable tit and the other to splay over the full curve of his belly. John's words break off into a groan. Sherlock responds in kind, and his smooth pace takes on a steady rhythm.
“I mean, I’ve had Twitter, but I had about fifty followers, because it was mainly just for tracking skating coverage. How do you deal with this much interaction?”
. If you’re going straight, you’re on the flat/hollow. If you’re going in a curve, you’re on an inside or an outside edge, depending on whether it’s the inside or the outside of the blade that you’re on. A “deep” edge is where the skater’s body is at a shallower angle to the ice. Maintaining deep edges throughout your footwork is difficult and the sign of a more artistic skater. Ice dancers have to have great edges, as their whole sport is artistry, and singles and pairs can get extra points for having deep edges.
Sherlock grimaces. “Lestrade, when he takes on new skaters, strongly recommends that they try working with me.”
“Of course he won’t be able to land them on harness now; you’ve gotten into his head!”
“Speak it into existence tomorrow,” John says with a yawn. “We’ve got practice tomorrow at 7AM.”
They get off the ice and put their skate guards on. “I’ll get lunch,” Sherlock says.
In one shocking push, John thrusts in. Sherlock’s back arches as if he’s trying to ride his whole body down further onto John, to take more. John leans over Sherlock on all fours and tries to get his breath back.
-How was the pacing here? Did any bits seem to go by too quickly or not quickly enough for what was happening?
“What the hell, Sherlock?” John demands.
“Grand...Prix...assignments.”
His first impression is that while it is not dirty, it is definitely messy. The coffee table is scattered with books, magazines, and the typical bachelor clutter. Off to the right he can see a kitchen, the table in which is littered with such objects as a laptop, more books, and an electric keyboard. Across the way, a door is open, revealing an unexpectedly neat bedroom. A hallway leads down to where John imagines there is a bathroom and a second bedroom.
Sherlock grimaces. “I am...abrasive.”
“God, yes.”
“Nice to meet you,” John says, with his well-honed midwestern manners.
“I should have the locks changed. And a keypad. Possibly a fingerprint scanner.”
John falls asleep to the distant drone of the television, as he did the night before, and the night before, and the night before.
You are a song for
“I can’t remember.”
Sherlock mutes the conversation and opens his notes.
“Hello,” he says, drawing out the second syllable.
this season) or this
There is something he was supposed to do before he slept, Sherlock remembers. It is fine if he sleeps on the couch for a few hours, but there was something else he was supposed to do first. What was it?
Holmes caught my eye. His mouth curved into a small half-smile, more amused than a smirk, and with something light and mischievous in his eye. "Though I could probably manage it, why not skip the formalities?"
with him? “Precisely. Try it again.”
"Okay?"
Sherlock is so vulnerable right now, and so very helpless. It makes a small, dark, sick thing deep inside John feel unspeakably powerful to see Sherlock Holmes reduced to this, and to know that he is the only one permitted to see it.
rink, and he’s alone. No, wait—Sherlock is there. John can’t see him, but there is someone behind him with his broad, long-fingered hands on John’s hips, and John knows it is Sherlock even before he hears Sherlock’s deep, low, delicately accented voice.
Unfortunately, not everyone has the sense to make the interesting decisions.
Yeah, he can deal with that.
“He’s right,” John admits.
Step and choreographic sequences are the parts of a program that a lot of casual watchers look at and think of the “boring” part, because there are no big jumps or spins and it’s hard to understand what they’re actually doing. A step sequence is a series of steps and turns done in either in a straight line (a midline down the center or diagonally across the ice), circular pattern, or serpentine S shape across the ice. There are requirements about the steps/turns a skater must do. A choreographic sequence is basically just “go hog wild, just no big jumps or spins.” You might think, “Oh, that part looks easy, I could do that.” After a year of working on them, I can almost consistently do two basic kinds of turns. Step/choreographic sequences are my personal favorite part of a program, as I feel like they’re where the skater can really do something unique. There are a number of moves sometimes done in choreo sequences that are just beautiful, such as
“Wouldn’t dream of it.”
Note the upgrade in rating. ;) Get hype.
“No!” Sherlock flaps a dismissive hand and scowls. “Sudden movements can trigger an abrupt tightening of the ligament surrounding my uterus, as opposed to the normal—”
Finally, Sherlock meets his eye, and with the smallest of smiles. “I believe you do, don’t you.”
Next to him, Greg whispers, “The fuck.”
“My joints are sore because I’m old and got shot. Your joints are sore because your system is flooded with hormones and they’re relaxing your pelvis out of alignment with itself until your bones grind up against each other.”
Keeping the tension slack, it transpires, does not do much good.
Look, I'm not going to try to play like this chapter took a long time to write. I had a wedding to plan and be in, and then a honeymoon to go on, and writing gay skating trash fell by the wayside. Hopefully the contents of this chapter make up for the wait, and much of the next chapter is already written.
“Uh. Who’s my actual coach, then?”
As mentioned last time round, this is quite unedited. Please, leave concrit! I have a thick skin and am a big slut for criticism!
"You've done that before," Sherlock says.
“Still nothing?” says Greg at practice.
“He’ll be fine, Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock assures her. “Give him time to adjust.”
Sherlock exits out of the Youtube app. Before he can open the document with his notes and plans, his phone buzzes with a text message.
“No need.”
“Sherlock,” John says. “Did you...how...was that you?”
“Yes,” John says, opening it. “Oh boy.” The text is long, rambling, and full of typos and uncorrected autocorrects. “I should be ashamed of myself and I’m no brother of hers. Let’s see, it’s ten o’clock? Looks like she had the day shift today and started drinking just as soon as she got in the door. Lovely. You know, Sherlock, I have to say, the lack of substance abuse in this household is a major point in your favor.”
John rolls his eyes. “Of course.”
“This is us,” Sherlock says, putting a key into the lock of a brick house with a black door.
“Go ahead. Aux cord is right there.”
“Saw @sholmes at 4CC tagging along behind Greg Lestrade like a lost puppy. If Greggy weren’t the #1 best dad then Shoelace would be living on the street.”
“You promised me you were clean.”
“I’d fuck his camel spin.”
“Did you do that when you were competing, too?”
Molly avoids Sherlock’s eye. “See you later, John,” she says, and leaves.
Pain, it seemed, I could suffer. Failure, terror, starvation, and disease; all these were as nothing to me when compared to nothingness. Even here, a few months' quietude had me screaming out in the night in desperation for

Greg and the other skaters all converge at the edge of the rink where Sherlock and John are. John reads their faces. They all look to Sherlock first with expressions of repressed hostility. It is a moment before they see John at all. He tries to stay blank and not transmit how very, very awkward he feels.
“Oh! Oh, hell, not a contra—”
As they speak, Sherlock whizzes past them, running through a complicated footwork series. John chews at the inside of his mouth. He’s going to be expected to replicate that?
do look totally ridiculous, but a number of athletes swear by them for making the aftermath of an intensive workout less unpleasant.
“Yeah, but like, that’s the job.”
“No need,” John says. “I can keep going.”
It’s fine. Nothing spectacular, just fine. He’s always been slightly more of a technician than an artist, but he feels satisfied enough with his performance.
The Grand Prix series is, essentially, the World Series of figure skating. High-level skaters (we’re talking about the people who are probably going to the Olympics, in an Olympic year) can be assigned to two events and, based on the results, might qualify for the final. I’m playing awfully fast and loose by giving John GP assignments at all. Technically there’s no way he’d be assigned to a GP event, as that’s based on achievements in the previous season. But that doesn’t make for good drama, now, does it?
John checks the time. “Early for you, isn’t it?”
“Better,” Greg calls, while John picks himself up off the ice. “You were only a little underrotated that last time.”
John plops down onto the couch. He’d gotten two assignments his one year in seniors and done admirably, with a silver at Cup of Russia, a gold at Skate America, and a silver at the final. His realistic goals for this season had been to work his way up through sectionals and make it to Nationals, and go out for some Challenger series events to get him into international competition. The idea of skating in the Grand Prix had not even entered his brain.
And Sherlock is not without empathy, and he understands that John has not had a proper training session in a long time. So after half an hour, Sherlock says, “John, feel free to take a break.”
Sherlock slides to a stop next to them. “We need to work on his step sequence,” he tells Greg.
To John’s surprise, Sherlock shambles out of his room somewhere around eight and shuffles into the kitchen.
“Good, now let’s see your quads,” says Sherlock. “You have the toe and the sal, yes?”
“You’re sure?” Greg asks.
Sherlock reaches up, cups John’s face, and brings it down to his to kiss him, just as he hitches his hips in the effort to make John do it, please, finally, do it. John, who wants nothing more than to give Sherlock exactly what he wants, does it.
“September?” John snorts. “You’re kidding.”
sweet
As they get their skates on, John side-eyes Sherlock’s. What kind of equipment is that? The boot looks a little like a Riedell, but it’s not any of the models John is familiar with. And the blades say they’re John Wilson, but not which kind. John laces up his well-worn Edeas self-consciously.
, he thinks, as he slips into sleep,
“Nice,” John says. “Yeah, I’m totally into it.”
John turns to Molly, looking mock-aghast. “Do I have no secrets?” Molly giggles.
Is he talking faster? He seems...brighter, somehow, more energized. Maybe it’s the break. Sherlock does seem to fade before John does.
Nevertheless, the performance is gorgeous. John’s stamina is evident in his consistency throughout the program. His jumps in the later part of his program are every bit as solid as those in the first part. His artistry is less impressive, but it’s competent.
Sherlock leans in, taking John by the waist. “So do you.”
Feeling more self-conscious than he has since his first session with a technical specialist, John demonstrates a walking lunge. Sherlock sighs.
John puts his hands over Sherlock’s ribs, just above where his stomach begins to round out into a gravid curve. As Sherlock inhales, John can feel—God, and
“Absolutely,” John says.
(See the end of the chapter for
And the little wooden box is under his bed at all times, where John will never, must never, see it. And Sherlock always wears long sleeves outside of his bedroom.
They’re closer than they were in real life. Sherlock’s body is flush with John’s back. John can feel the long lines of him. At least, he can until Sherlock pushes him, and John falls, and instead of hitting the ice he falls through and keeps falling until he wakes with a start and a swooping feeling in his stomach.
“You know. Kind of like we did, but...different.”
“You deserve respect,” Sherlock says.
Sherlock glances sideways at him, then looks back down. “You’re intimidated by his reputation. Don’t be. His methods are precisely what you need. He has turned out well-balanced, well-rounded skaters, almost without exception.”
Honestly, every part of this has gone better than he hoped. John has not fired him. In fact, John is showing every sign of actually trusting him. He works hard, he has not told Sherlock to fuck off, and he has even very nearly complimented Sherlock.
“Do you speak—of course you do.”
John laughs. “And you can skate. Just a little.”
“Got it,” John says. “Hey, where’s Anderson?”
After several more attempts, John retreats, nursing several new bruises, to the bench for a break, where Sally and Philip are chatting. As soon as John approaches, the conversation stops abruptly.
Mycroft returns to the sofa, the better to stare down his brother. While his back is turned, John points to him and mouths to Sherlock, “There are two of you?”
He starts to unpack his few belongings, a process which can’t help but remind him of the other times he has done it. California back to Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania to James’s basement in California, and the big house in the countryside to the one in town. John thinks about his mother telling him all about how he’d have a bedroom all to himself, and how close it was to the rink, and how he’d never have to see his father again. He does not think about his empty bedroom in Catawissa and how Harry is probably already taking everything he left behind to the Goodwill. He does not think about sleeping in James’s basement and tossing and turning with heated dreams.
John takes Sherlock’s face in his hands. “Let’s make them ours.”
John comes with a glorious shout, Sherlock’s body wringing pulse after pulse of pleasure from him. He throws his head back and surrenders to it. Beneath him, he feels Sherlock’s leg kick back and his body start convulsing around him as he stripes come up over his stomach.
“Not here. No space.”
"Yeah, you better come," John growls. "Show me how much you want this. Show me you love it."

“I want you to do a tango for your free skate,” he had said to John last week.
to,” says John.
John steps away. Sherlock’s hands fall to his side. They are still warm.
“I can’t believe I called you a jackass,” John says through giggles.
“I’ll be right back,” he says.
“Jesus, that’s almost as hot. Keep at it, then.”
Greg rolls his eyes. “Oh, yeah. He does that sometimes. He’ll come out in a day or two, vacuum up all the food in the fridge, and sleep for twelve hours. When he was sleeping in my basement after he first came to Colorado, he’d pull that routine a couple times a month. You’ve been here, what, about a month? He’s past due for it, really.”
“I’m sure Greg has a whole cluster of gray hairs dedicated to that week.”
John’s stomach drops. It’s Greg Lestrade. Oh God, he’s even dreamier in person, with that gorgeous bone structure and full-on silver fox look.
Alright, then.
-Too many eyesex moments?
The piano crescendos into a long line of cluster chords leading up, with the violin following, and then both decrescendo as they step down, down, down. Then there is that sharp trill and run from the beginning again, this time with more flourishes from the piano. The music launches into a variation on the first section that incorporates elements from the second, with more for both instruments to do and a more complex percussion line. The performances are both technically and expressively impressive. Finally, there is a sudden decrescendo, and then the music swells into a triumphant climax with one last chord from the piano and a high note on the violin.
(which Karen Chen used for her
“Oh, wow,” John says. “This is definitely nearby.”
The violin line morphs into something smoother and sleeker as the piano takes the lead. The tempo does not change, but the mood does. It’s sweet, rather than sexy. The melody is lovely, but it’s not as distinctive and catchy.
“If I could say something?” John cuts in.
“No one else could do it in a satisfactory manner.”
“I’m really not,” John says through gritted teeth.
“The idea of cheating is detestable to you. Ergo, you don’t believe it.” Sherlock aims the full force of his gaze on John. “I need you to tell me why.”
-Would you rather I update whenever I finish a chapter (remember, I'm shooting for every 2-3 days) or on a particular day once a week?
John nods. “He is definitely single-minded.”
He likes to think that things could have gone on like this forever, if not for the demands of his feeble body.
John rolls his eyes and flicks the light on. Dressed in a chic gray sweater and jeans and lounging on John’s bed is Sherlock Holmes, looking like a model. John feels like an idiot in the ridiculous Ralph Lauren opening ceremony getup, with the massive parka, sweater, boots, and utterly ludicrous suede fringed gloves.
With a gasp, Sherlock drops into an orgasm that makes every last part of his body convulse violently with sensation. John shouts in triumph, and his rhythm turns into a jagged staccato. The warm pulsing deep in Sherlock’s body is a luscious denouement to his climax.
“Don’t be intimidated,” Greg says.
“Uh, yeah,” John says.
I've been crowdsourcing the beta-ing out to you intrepid souls who are reading this as it updates, and it's been a really cool and helpful experience.

“Five thirty. Come on.”
John Watson returning after a retirement that lengthy is extremely rare, but not completely unheard of. Deanna Stellato retired at age 17 due to injury and then returned in 2016 at 33 to skate in pairs. Virtue and Moir took a two-year break in the middle of their career, as mentioned here.
His world narrows to the feeling between his legs, the almost unbelievably perfect pressure, the heat. Below him, Sherlock is groaning with every thrust in a way that makes John want to fuck him more, and harder, and deeper.
I have many times heard the handsomeness of the English officer's uniform remarked upon: the scarlet color, the tidy gold buttons, the touches of braid, the striking epaulettes with their fringe. Myself, I have never been able to appreciate its aesthetics, having seen its intended purpose in action. When a man sees firsthand how well the renowned red coat disguises the stain of blood seeping through the wool, he often loses his taste for the way it catches ladies' eyes.
It isn’t enough. His muscles are burning and his joints ache, but he doesn’t care. His cock rubs deliciously between his rounded stomach and John’s (hatefully) flat abdominals, and even that doesn’t satisfy. He whines, baring his teeth and groping at his own chest to cup handfuls of unfamiliar flesh and squeeze. He scrapes his thumbnails over and pinches at and plucks his round, dark nipples, chasing the added spark of sensation that will drive him over the edge. More than anything, Sherlock wants to
John pulls into his driveway. Harry’s car is not there, which means either that she’s got a late shift at the Walmart or she’s decided to do her drinking at the bar in town. A knot settles in John’s stomach. Considering what Sherlock saw in him based on one video and a once-over, how much more will he see in a house? You don’t have to be clever to figure out what his home life is like.
Sherlock zips past Philip so close that Philip yelps in outrage.
This looks like a very fast update, but actually I had been sitting on the previous chapter for a while, unable to get the time to format and post it. As ever, constructive criticism welcome, as I am my own beta.
“Oh, for God’s sake.”
“You had to,” Harry repeats hollowly. “Of course you did. You always have to.”
“Oh, don’t be smug, you’re terrible when you’re smug,” Greg says. “John, are you sure you haven’t jumped in seven years?”
“Are you going to give me specific feedback, or just tell me how terrible I am?” John snaps back.
Sherlock pouts. “You were busy.”
“I’m going to be wearing them,” John complains.
The airport at these hours is practically deserted. This provides numerous advantages to Sherlock, not the least of which is his ability to monopolize the only convenient electrical socket so that he can charge his phone. After several hours of use en route to the outskirts of Pennsylvania and then again going back to the airport, it is in dire need of power.
“Past experience indicates otherwise.”
It’s the sort of dream where he knows immediately he’s in one, from the hazy quality around the edges. He’s at the rink, or he’s at
“Harry.”
All of a sudden, Sherlock’s brain switches on.
This is an extremely funny joke to anyone who watched any figure skating competitions this past season. If you read the pre-season interviews, you will find literal dozens of skaters talking about how they’re so excited for their Moulin Rouge programs, since it’s such a unique choice that no one else has skated to. And then they all skated to it. There have been

“You know. Hip flexors, lunges.”
The car ride into Denver proper is largely spent with Sherlock and Greg bickering over schedules. Sherlock wants to start this afternoon, while Greg does his best to convince him that he has enough on his hands with his other students today and that their best bet is starting on-ice work tomorrow. As the car slows to a stop in front of a row of nearly identical brick houses, Sherlock has bargained Greg into a brief session this afternoon. Neither party seems satisfied with this compromise, but Sherlock nevertheless helps John get his luggage out of the trunk.
John botches the entry, pops the axel into a single, and falls.
The NormaTec pants have turned off. By the time John has shucked them, Sherlock has gotten to his feet.
“Why, John,” Sherlock says innocently, “you should’ve said. Lift.”
"Once more into the breach," Holmes muttered.
Sherlock is nearby, conversing in rapid Russian with a beautiful woman with dark hair tied up in a severe bun. John recognizes her from years of seeing her in the kiss and cry with various athletes, and before that in ice dance coverage from the eighties. Molly is nearby, looking lost.

When they reach Greg, Sherlock says, “We’re trying the lutz without the harness.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes and taps out a response.
John nods. He's quite aware.
“More than you give yourself credit for,” says Sherlock. “And in this case, you know I’m right.”
“Seven.”
“It was a difficult week.”
“Well, the percussion is synthesized, and the piano is only me on my keyboard, and I’m only a mediocre pianist, so it could be improved upon significantly. I can record it properly this weekend with some musicians I know in the Colorado Symphony. I’ve already gotten in touch.”
“And side interests. The accounts wouldn’t be believable otherwise.”
“Did you?”
“It’s like he Googled ‘overused figure skating songs.’ Why doesn’t he hire Irene?”
John takes himself and his things to the room, which is as disorderly as was promised. There is exercise equipment, sound equipment, and a jumble of worn skate boots strewn about the room. But there’s a bed, a desk, and a closet, which is all John requires.
. He tuts and stops it.
Sherlock just narrows his eyes at Mycroft.
John shrugs. “Some jumping jacks, some stretches.”
“Spy, more like,” Sherlock mutters.
The other skaters grab their skate guards, snap them on, and step off the ice. Molly goes to a bag by the bench and gets out a little lunch box while Philip and Sally head off towards the lobby together. As they go, Sally leans in and whispers something in Philip’s ear, which makes him grin broadly. The look of the grin makes John’s stomach turn.
Above all, Sherlock is in pain, and he is in pain because of this incredible thing he is doing for them all. And despite all that, he still wants John so badly he is willing to hurt even more for it. John loves this man so much he could die of it.

“I expected you to stay here and be family, John,” she snaps. “How am I going to pay the bills by myself?”
“My Korean and Italian are slightly weaker in conversation, although I pass for fluent online. The Italian also speaks French and English.”
“Yes,” says Sherlock, still clearly annoyed. “Now go shower. I could smell you coming up the stairs.”
“Yeah.”
“Well, now,” John says, with a little smirk, “what’s stopping you?”
“Do it.”
But Sherlock, once his mind is set, is nigh impossible to dissuade. John can see the stubborn spark in his eyes. He fought in Afghanistan; he knows a lost cause when he saw one.
“Fuck,” John says, looking off and to the side. “I can’t even look at you doing that without it doing things to me.”

"If I do it, you promise afterwards you'll use the lotion? I'm not laundering your stomach-dandruff off the sheets."
“Sweet,” John jokes.
“You started with him right after his senior debut, right?” John asks.
“Now your toe loop,” Sherlock calls.
“Your knees are poking into my back,” Sherlock complains.
There is a long stretch of silence, after which Sherlock says, “Thank you. There are...few who believe me.”
The kiss is meant to be reassuring, but it turns slow and languid and promising. John gets a good hold on Sherlock’s bum, despite the obstruction. Until relatively recently, this would have been where John brought their groins into contact and rocked them together until Sherlock was speechless with want, but current circumstances are preventing full-frontal direct contact. Sherlock seems to pick up exactly what John is doing, because he squirms restlessly against him, back and forth between John’s hands and John’s body. Sherlock curls his fingers in John’s hair, which triggers a tingling sensation that trickles down the back of his neck and down his spine.
of an otherwise perfectly fine tango, and he almost screams in frustration.
“Work a job, and you’ll see,” says John. “Oh, shit, where should I park? For that matter, what am I doing with my car?”
The violence warning becomes quite relevant in this chapter.
Sherlock could open the emails from Mycroft, the ones offering him nominal “work” giving anonymous feedback over the internet or writing training presentations for judges and coaches and skaters in exchange for an egregious sum of money. But he knows the hidden cost of these jobs. He weighs the cost and benefit and determines that he does not and will never need to take those offers.
John tries not to think about how hot and tight it is around his fingers as he pushes a third in, and how much hotter and tighter it’ll be around his dick. Sherlock’s other hand is around his knee, pulling his leg up and back to open himself up for him, and really, that is about it.
“You’ll get the hang of it,” Sherlock says. He has two laptops out on the coffee table in front of him. One has a series of complicated spreadsheets, and the other is turned away.
It’s true, and it also punches a groan from John’s throat. He does it, lifts Sherlock’s leg and raises it so John can push his cock smoothly in. Sherlock whimpers, both from the pleasure and because his back and entire pelvis really does hurt. Still, he has to admit that there is something highly appealing about John’s obvious relish at his discomfort.
“That’s a +1 grade of execution if we’re being honest,” he says. “Maybe a +2 if the judges are generous.”
He and Mary swap numbers and emails. When John texts her, he adds a good picture of himself with the comment, “So you don’t forget this ugly mug.” She grins when she gets it and texts him back a winking emoji.
“My former coaches would be appalled at this particular usage of my Y spin position,” Sherlock says with a smirk.
“I’ll just be a couple of minutes,” John says.
“See you in the morning.”
“Uh, just John is fine,” John says. “Congratulations?”
“Nope.”
“Stop that,” John says sternly.
“Please.”
Also, we have some proper Skating John video now! The latest

(scroll down a bit) with a slightly less pretty one. I like when the skater’s upper body forms a nice, smooth teardrop shape.
“It’ll do,” says Sherlock. “We’re going to run your jumps, starting from the triple sal and working on up.”
Sherlock jots down a few more notes in the small black Moleskine he has balanced on the arm of the chair. He grinds his teeth. It would be one thing if there were definite, long sections of pieces that worked. Then he could cut a few different songs together until he had a cohesive selection. Instead, he’ll find one where the violin is perfect, but there’s unnecessary accordion in the orchestrations. Or everything is just right, except for the ostentatious electronic beat in the background. Or, God forbid, a beatboxer.

“Definitely.”
“Oh my God. You got into kpop, didn’t you.”
This time, he skates out of the marked combination with the rugged, “aw, fuck it” determination he brought to the triple axel, the one that Sherlock told him he could land after seven years of falling off of single jumps. He takes the adrenaline that the body floods itself with when it falls and converts it into positive energy, into his arms and body and legs and feet. He lets himself move faster than he wants to, leans into turns in ways he hasn’t done in years. Once or twice, he does fall, but he picks himself back up and keeps going.
“Your purposes?”
“I have Grand Prix assignments.”
Immediately John can feel Sherlock’s body tensing in a way he knows well by now, and he knows he has to take his pleasure now. He grits his teeth and fucks him faster, his grip on Sherlock’s leg tightening and tightening until finally–
On his next attempt, he lands, but on two feet.
John takes Sherlock’s arms in his hands. “It’s the energy here,” he murmurs. “You can feel it too, can’t you? God, I wish…”

John goes to bed to the distant sound of Sherlock running through a melismatic arpeggio on his violin over and over, the same five notes. It should be grating. Instead, it’s beautiful.
“We can’t be too loud, Sherlock. Ah! The – the walls.”
Sherlock grimaces. “You plainly don’t believe the story the media told, or you wouldn’t be here. It isn’t that you don’t care. You’re a person of strong moral character; you would never have stayed in Pennsylvania after your mother died if you weren’t.”
“Yes,” says Sherlock tersely, “with one bed.”
Sherlock scowls. “He won’t land them on harness.”
“God, yeah, like that. Can’t tell you how many times I’ve looked at you during practice and wanted to have you right there at the rink. Press you against the mirror in the off-ice training room and pound you until you can’t walk straight.”
“Hello,” John says.
“Mary helps me with my social media,” Molly says.
“What? You’re joking. You choreographed most of your programs, right? So I’ve seen your work.”
“More,” Sherlock demands.
John lands with a fist pump and a shout, which is echoed by Greg with a loud, “Holy shit!” John skates back over to his coaches with a big grin on his face. Greg is grinning back. Even Sherlock looks pleased.
The announcement that John Watson is coming out of retirement makes an initial bang, but eventually fades, as all off-season news does. John’s social media notifications taper off to a slow trickle. Sherlock takes John to a kindly older woman to be measured for his costumes and shows her a series of sketches that he will not let John see.
Before the altar, in the sunbeams streaming from the stained glass windows, stood Sherlock Holmes.
John does it again, and this time, Sherlock does not stop him. By the time he has finished the section they have learned today, Sherlock is grinning, and John is grinning, and they are both breathing hard, and Sherlock has forgotten entirely about that odd moment earlier in favor of the breathlessness of seeing his creation come to life.
“Apparently,” Sherlock says through gritted teeth, “I am difficult.”
“Now,” he says, “I require information. Tell me about what your diet and training habits have been like for the last seven years, with details. What would you say your protein intake has been?”
This was originally half of one chapter, but I split it into two shorter ones because it felt better that way for pacing reasons, and also because these chapters have been around 4-5k and it would’ve been about 7-8k if I kept it as one.
“Sherlock, he’s been out of retirement for about twenty minutes. Go easy on him.”
Dinner that night is an interesting affair in which Sherlock cooks some purple meat (“Elk, John”) with a knobby root vegetable that is starchy but is not a potato and a strangely geometric green broccoli-like plant. All turn out to be delicious.
“Of course not,” John parries. “You got to him first.”
John opens his mouth, considers, then shuts it.
That night, John dreams.
Living with John is a risk, but it is paying off. Sherlock finds it is good to have company in a way that it never has before. Living with Lestrade as a teenager had been loathsome, because it had been an exercise in being controlled. This situation, though, this exerting influence by mutual consent, is wonderful. It’s exhausting. It’s amazing.

, and yet he knows that he’s holding back, because once he does, it will be over. Still, it’s becoming increasingly clear that he can’t maintain this pace for much longer.
about the proliferation of Moulin Rouges. It’s quickly become what skating fans call a “warhorse,” which is a musical selection that’s been done to death. (Swan Lake and Carmen are classic warhorses.) Just off the top of my head, without resorting to Google, I can list off the following athletes who had Moulin Rouge programs in the 2017-2018 season: Vincent Zhou, Ashley Wagner, Virtue and Moir, the Knierims, and Manta and Johnson. And that’s not a comprehensive list. If you only watch one, make it
John laughs and hopes it sounds like the laugh of a normal human. “Yeah, I didn’t have a hell of a lot of notice either.” What the fuck? Did he just swear in front of the 1986 world champion? The very, very hot and bisexual world champion?
“Oh, fuck,” John says. “I haven’t got anything.”
"John..."
“Nice. Very spy movie.”
“I’m making dinner. Want any?”
John does his triple toe, and then his triple loop, triple flip, triple lutz, and finally, the axel. He knows the loop was a little messy. It’s never been his best jump. His axel, though, was very good, and his lutz is a personal favorite. He skates back over to Sherlock and Greg. Greg is staring at him slightly open-mouthed.
John skates through where the quad toe-triple toe should go, marking the combination itself, and then skates into his step sequence.
There is a knock on his door.
John flushes.
“I thought you meant, I don’t know, next season. Stumble back onto competitive ice around mid-2018.”
“Uh, okay,” John says.
He’s currently reclining on the sofa in the NormaTec pants, clearing his literal hundreds of Twitter notifications. The official announcement went out six hours ago, and since then his brand new @johnwatsonskate account has gone from zero followers to fifteen thousand. His Instagram is the same. He hasn’t checked Facebook, which he is leaving entirely to Mary.
“Well, then, you’re riding to Colorado Springs with my knees in your back.”
John doesn’t ask what samphire or a crisper is, but he can figure it out. He makes his supper, which falls rather short of Sherlock’s usual creations, and eats it in front of Jeopardy.
within?
“Seven!”
John pets gently at Sherlock’s head. “I want to fuck you,” he says. “Let’s get naked and on the bed.”
John sets down his tea, blinking rapidly and cocking his head sideways in consideration. “Really?”
As John flips through the channels, Sherlock gathers his laptop from the kitchen and retreats to his room. Even through his closed door, he can hear the quiet hum of the television. Sherlock expects it to drive him round the twist. Half an hour later, he finds to his surprise that he doesn’t notice it at all.
Sherlock misses his bus stop and has to walk an extra four blocks to his apartment. He bumps into more than a few pedestrians as he goes. One of them tries to start something, but Sherlock does not stop walking, and the angry man gives up soon. By the time he reaches the apartment, he has a full minute of the violin line down.
John smiles back down at his sandwich. “Incredible.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I found commercial products to be too high in sodium.”
This isn’t the Sherlock he knows at all. This is someone else, the Black Swan herself perhaps, and that’s why John’s heart is in his throat and his skin is tingling like a weak current is running over it.
On his way out, Mycroft stops to nod at John. Sherlock sees this and scowls.
“Why?”
John goes down the hall to his bedroom, drags a suitcase and a backpack out from under the bed, and starts stuffing them full of his earthly possessions. Sherlock’s right, there isn’t much. Honestly it’s just his clothes and laptop. Everything else is easily replaced.
Molly gives him a warm smile. “Hello, John. You looked very good out there today.”
He goes down the hall to his bedroom, drags a suitcase and a backpack out from under the bed, and starts stuffing them full of his earthly possessions. Sherlock’s right, there isn’t much. Honestly it’s just his clothes and laptop. Everything else is easily replaced. He takes just a few of the medals from the wall and adds them to the disorganized jumble of clothes. His skating gear is in the bag in his trunk already. His trunk—oh, hell, what is he going to do with his car? Sherlock has a plan for everything. Surely he’s thought of that.
“Good,” he sighs, “that’s so good. Your mouth, Sherlock, it’s like nothing I’ve ever had before.”
. This meshing of Borser and Lestrade is also a bit of a shoutout to Drinkingcocoa, who is tremendously fond of both men and whose help in researching this fic was invaluable.
An indeterminate time later, something tugs Sherlock’s consciousness back to the surface. He wakes, but does not open his eyes. What woke him? Oh, there it is—someone’s hand is at his wrist. The hold is gentle, not tight, just lifting it up and away from his body.
Sherlock leans back a little, and something clearly changes. He breathes out a breathless, "ah," and moves ever faster. John is clinging to him by the ribcage. (His waist, of course, is impossible to hold like he usually would.)
“Jesus,” John spits. “Yeah, so good, you are so
Sherlock speaks first. “Do you mind if I put on music?”
“Are you...qualified?”
Greg rolls his eyes where only John can see, then turns around and pulls away from the curb.
and find the bullets for a step sequence. Sherlock is finding John’s first effort to be “creative and original” and the elements “matched to the musical structure,” because those are the bits he himself is responsible for, and because Sherlock, of course, can do no wrong.
I'm naming every chapter (so far) after lyrics from a song. This one's is particular corny. Points to whoever can spot it.
“You can customize your notifications more. Interact with fans occasionally. You need to rebuild name recognition. Jackie Wong retweeted the Ice Network article about your coming out of retirement and tagged you, which is helpful.”
“How do you think I got a Biellmann?”
Sorry for the longer wait! My day job is picking up big time lately, but it should ease up after the end of next week. Then I'm moving several states over, but then I'll have quite a lot of free time!
John skates over. “What’s up?”
They exit the men’s locker room and enter the rink. It isn’t crowded, but it’s fairly busy. John counts three skaters whizzing around the ice. Greg is working with a small, blonde girl on an equally small triple loop, which she keeps underrotating. There is a black woman with lush, full hair pulled back into a messy bun practicing footwork, and a dark-haired man with a short beard who is repeatedly doing what is either a mediocre triple flip or quite a bad triple lutz. All of them look vaguely familiar from skating coverage John has seen over the last few years.
“I know a baker downtown.”
John eyes the exception sitting in his passenger’s seat and says nothing.
But all that is in the past. John needs to live in the here and now, in the lutz he can’t land cleanly.
John rubs his thumbs up and down over Sherlock’s arms. “I just can’t stop thinking about you. Four years ago, if you’d…”
“Disappeared into his room,” John says.
Sherlock plugs his phone in. The music comes out of John’s tinny car speakers. John cracks a smile.
Sherlock walks him through the remainder of the off-ice warm-up, guiding John’s body into where he wants it. By the time he has finished with his minute of jumping jacks and they are putting on their skates, John finds that his heart is racing at a pleasantly quick rate.
“You’re afraid of falling,” Sherlock says.
John lands his triple salchow cleanly and with a rush of satisfaction. From across the ice, he hears Greg exclaim, “Nice one!”
Then he clicks on a song that turns out to be a
A damp curl slips forward and sticks to Sherlock’s forehead. John watches it fall and hisses through his teeth.
Sherlock swallows around the lump that has suddenly congealed in his throat. Here it comes. John will have heard from
The conversation takes them all the way into Philadelphia and to the airport, by which point Sherlock’s natural slight scowl has deepened into a profound frown. John is yawning and gradually fading from the entire exchange, which seems to only exacerbate Sherlock’s irritation.
John hides his smile. It’s rather endearing, seeing the cracks in Sherlock’s standoffish shell.
“Want to move?”
The melody is unpredictable but infectious. John realizes the corner of his mouth is tugging upwards in an involuntary smile. Greg catches his eye, and John sees he is smiling as well.
As he vaults back and up into the air, he holds his breath.
Sherlock says nothing, but he does not go back to his phone.
“You’d best get on with it, then, haven’t you?”
It’s staggering. And to think, Sherlock was once afraid that John would
“Show me.”
Sherlock stays still for a moment and savors the feeling of being full, of brimming with so much pleasure and pain and
“Buy cheaper vodka,” John says shortly. “Are you going to get out of my way?”
“And it didn’t do him a lick of good,” says Sally. “You’ve seen how he acts.”
After two hours of searching, Sherlock has still found nothing that fits.
John looks to Sherlock, his breath catching.
“Sherlock?” No response comes, so he knocks again. “Hey, Sherlock? You there?”
“Yes,” he breathes. “Keep me. Stuff me up until I’m too sore and swollen to move. Keep fucking me so I can’t ever leave.”
The bus had made maybe two stops before letting them off a block away from the rink. John and Sherlock enter the locker room, which is blessedly empty. John isn’t sure he’s ready to look at other, more active athletes just yet.
“I’ve missed it so much. Missed you.” Sherlock straddles him. He is hard and leaking, his red cock pressed up against the underside of his swollen stomach. He rises up on his knees a little, reaches behind himself, and guides John’s erection to line up against his hole. John slams his head back into the pillows.
Out of curiosity, John searches to see the tweets that mention @sholmes. A few of them are speculating more about John and whether he will get any choreography from him, since the official press release had only said that he would be coached by Greg, and nothing at all about Sherlock. The mentions are fewer and further between as John looks back further back, but markedly ruder.
Half an hour later, John is sweaty and breathless and exhilarated, and Sherlock is almost smiling, which is an impressive compliment. They break for lunch and Sherlock fetches their food.
Sherlock feels better than he has in years. Every day he wakes up and there is work, good work, work that makes him feel alive like he hasn’t in years. It’s draining, yes, but he has his ways of coping with that. During the day, there is practice and training, and at night, there is his consulting work. He hasn’t been bored in months.
“Sherlock,” John says patiently, “that was incredible.”
"It's not that I don't
“Next season won’t be an Olympic year.”
He eats breakfast and makes his own lunch—simple enough, since all of Sherlock’s usual lunch supplies are easy to find—and goes to the rink by himself.
John groans full-throatedly at the blissful feeling of enclosure, and Sherlock makes a sound like the air has been pressed from his lungs. John rubs his hands up and down Sherlock’s trembling thighs.
“So,” John says conversationally—and what an utter
“We’re in Denver. Drink this.”
all senses.
Gradually, the ringing in John’s ears subsides, and he slumps forward and off to the side. He throws one arm over Sherlock’s chest and discovers that it’s shaking with laughter.
Sherlock still does not look up from his laptops, but his hands aren’t moving and his eyes aren’t scanning. “Oddly, the drugs appear to be the least of my crimes. More offensive is the idea that Lestrade is tolerating a notorious doper only because I am exchanging sexual favors for employment opportunities.”
“Easy, darling,” John says, and eases one finger in.
“No!” Sherlock calls out. John stops where he is. Sherlock skates over to meet him there. “Turn around.” John does so, and Sherlock puts his hands just below his waist, over his hips.
“Love watching you make yourself feel good, babe,” John says. “Can you jerk yourself off without coming too soon?”
John returns to the bench with his lunch, where Molly is sitting with hers and chatting with an attractive blonde woman. John slides in next to Molly and shoots the blonde a dazzling smile.
“I have work to do.”
“More or less. Think of me as a consultant.”
“We can trade off.”
"Isn't it?" Sherlock spits.
Now, editing question: was Sherlock's "M'Naghten Backstory 101" followable? Or did you get lost? It's hard trying to write up a quick primer of it when I'm staring at all the research and thus know everything. I'm never sure what's relevant and what's not. It may become marginally clearer in the next chapter or two.
Had he the capacity to do so, that would have been the moment at which Sherlock would have flounced away in a fit of pique. At present, though, it is a lucky moment indeed when Sherlock can rise unassisted from a seated position.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Capital idea,” Sherlock says, still looking slightly rumbled and well-fucked.
“I’m not,” Sherlock insists. “I am speaking it into existence.”
“Harry,” John says.
Sherlock does not say anything for a second, then he clears his throat and says, “You’re going to be fine. The yoga will help.”
“I’ll do the toe,” he says.

"But sometimes it’s just that I click with someone.”
“It’s true, I am a jackass,” Sherlock admits. “I’ve been fired as a choreographer seventeen times.”
“She’s a fan. All the accounts have at least one truly controversial opinion, so that they get into occasional conflict with other accounts. The Italian is in favor of bringing back compulsory figures.”
But none so
John grins.
Sherlock’s mouth curls up in the smallest hint of a smile. “He didn’t have any hairs left to go gray.”
“What the hell?” he snaps, as he’s picking himself up.
Warning for talk of past sex work in this chapter.
“The Korean, Russian, and Canadian accounts. The American is a middle-aged housewife, as is the Japanese one. And the Italian is a retired coach who hates the IJS, the current age requirement for seniors, and most of the major federations.”
“Grinding. Like scraping a rock against pavement,” John adds, for illustrative purposes.
John manages to swing his legs over and stand up with an almighty groan. He stretches his arms up. The apartment isn’t unbearably cold, but at this hour it’s a bit chilly. He’s regretting his choice to sleep bare-chested.
“And what, exactly, is so funny, you dick?” John says.
Sherlock bares his teeth.
There are two portions of figure skating scores, the technical (TES) and component (PCS). Technical is, basically, what jumps/spins/steps you did and how well you did them. Component marks are the “artistic” elements, which casual watchers tend to think means “expressive faces” or “their skating/song was pretty and I liked it.” It’s actually a combination of five characteristics: skating skills, transitions, performance, composition, and interpretation. There are arguments that PCS is sometimes scored based more on who the judges like the best more than who is truly the most “artistic.” This part of scoring is the one that’s easiest for outside opinion to leak in, like, for instance, scoring a Russian man who skated like hot garbage higher than an American who skated beautifully at the Olympic team men’s free skate because the Russian is Russian and has quads. Not that I’m still bitter or anything. Anyways, difficult entries do not give you any kind of bump to your technical score, while adding things like different arm positions within a jump do. This is, in my opinion, some hot horseshit.
John keeps scrolling through @_queen_yuna’s feed. It’s a combination of skating GIFs and opinions, Korean idols, Korean dramas, and cute animals. The skating content is chiefly Korean skaters with a few scattered Canadians, Europeans, and Americans. There are hardly any Japanese athletes at all.
“I’ve got it!” Sherlock shouts, waving his iPhone in the air. He’s got earbuds in his other hand. “Your free skate. I’ve got it.” He tries to skid to a stop and has to grab Greg’s arm to halt himself.
Sherlock’s thoughts peter out into quiet as the pain fades to a dull, ignorable ache, his husband warm against his back and their daughter warm inside of him.
Sherlock does not understand this reference, which John is incredulous about, but this is also not a dealbreaker. While John is immobilized on the couch in the NormaTec pants, Sherlock presents him with the nutrition plan he came up with on the plane.
They retrieve their belongings from the overhead and file off the plane. They are halfway to the baggage claim before John checks the time and realizes that he’s expected at work in fifteen minutes. He calls his boss’s phone, knowing he won’t pick up, and leaves a voicemail like a coward, explaining that he is quitting. He texts his students to let them know they’ll need a new coach and recommends a colleague he knows is good. Mikayla is the only one to respond.
with Martin's face pasted on) doing some lovely skating. For those nerds, it's a Y spiral, Russian split jump, triple toe loop (I think? not a great shot of the entry), and a scratch spin. Thank you to everyone who tagged me in it!
John, ever practical, goes.
John had heard the whispers about Sherlock, who had always been notoriously close-lipped about his private life, favored flashy costumes and frankly feminine choreography, and worked so closely and exclusively with an openly queer coach. If he’s honest, he can see where the idea would come from.
Sherlock grimaces and shakes his head.
“I have a man,” Sherlock says.
As they go inside, Sherlock doesn’t look up from his phone. How much can he see out of the corners of his eyes?
“Ruined my body,” Sherlock retorts, and it’s both an accusation and a revelation.
Sherlock shakes his head, a tight, wordless negation. “Don’t. We’re here for you.”
“Currently, designing a plan to get you ready to compete this September.”
“Boy, it didn’t feel better,” says John. “Did Sherlock fall this much this hard when he was training his quad lutz?”
steady
“Sherlock,” John scolds, “be polite.”
“Look, you were right about the triples, but I’m not having a skater who hasn’t jumped in years attempt a quad and not put him on harness.”
“I loathe lengthy commutes,” Sherlock says.
“Yes,” says Sherlock in a long-suffering voice.
“What’s that?”
“I’m sorry,” John says, “did you say you took an Uber from Philadelphia?”
“Can you talk and read the ISU handbook at the same time? I wasn’t aware you possessed that level of brainpower.”
