?: *huff* Okay.
"John, I'm so sorry." Sherlock looked into his deep blue eyes, so full of pain and hurt.
“You’re joking, right?”
“Mr. Valerian, I presume?” John stuck his hand out and he shook it immediately with a warm smile.
"Oh that's awful; I'm so sorry. You're always welcome here, though." Sherlock gave a small smile. "Thanks."
"Okay, as long as you take your fucking like a good little boy." Sherlock nodded. Satisfied, John slid one finger into him.
“Having a row with one of your girlfriends?” Harry pushed.
"We were invited, Sherlock! Someone here had some sense." Sherlock's father looked past Sherlock and met John's eyes. "Ah yes, this must be John! John Watson was kind enough to email us about you and set up a meeting time. Naturally, we got excited and drove out here to see our boy again as soon as we could." The look on Sherlock's face made John want to turn away and run. He looked angrier than he had ever seen him. John saw Sherlock clench his fist. In almost a whisper Sherlock said, "tell me this isn't true John. Tell me-" he inhaled sharply. "Please tell me that you didn't betray my trust like this." John was at a loss for words. Sherlock closed his eyes and drew in a sharp breath.
"Actually, Sally" Sherlock hissed back, "I'm first chair now. I believe second chair has your name on it." Her face went from disbelief to anger in a matter of seconds. She looked over at Mr. Uyehara, but he just nodded.
"It's cute," Sherlock smiled a little and left it alone.
"I am indeed."
"Uh."
"Boyfriends?" John finished for him.
“Alright, what’s your sexual orientation?” John blurted out before he could stop himself.
"Do they need to hear about how you just touched my arse?"
"Well, I've got gym. See you later. Oh, actually I can just text you now. Cool." John waved and then jogged off, leaving Sherlock in an empty hallway.
The line clicked and John put the phone down, satisfied.
"I'm sorry what was that?" John said grinning uncontrollably.
"I said no sex tonight; I'm so exhausted. I'd be complete rubbish at it." John said then yawned to emphasize his point.
“To this day, we still wish it had worked.” His father added with an awful edge to his voice. The room became completely silent. You could have heard a pin drop. After almost a full minute, John stood up and walked to the door. He opened it and said “get the hell out of our flat, you monsters. If you ever come here again, let me warn you that I was in the army. I have killed people. I love your son more than you ever have. Get out now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Normally people tell me to either shut up or slow down because I talk so fast," Sherlock answered looking anywhere, but John's perfect face.
"John? SH"
“I don’t care. I love who I love, and neither me nor any doctor can change that.” Sherlock cried out. Why couldn’t he just get them to understand?
“Sherlock why did you always have to take things the wrong way? You still do apparently.” John’s mouth fell open and he met Sherlock’s ashamed gaze.
"Well I mean for one, you're tall and handsome and talented and stuff." Sherlock's jaw nearly dropped. Did he hear that correctly?
Sherlock’s POV
"Molly. You're very pretty and you will make someone very happy someday, but I'm gay." Sherlock said softly.
"If you're good, just maybe." They laughed again and startled a few pigeons.
“Why won't you tell me?”
John wrote again:
"To us" Sherlock replied with an adorable smile. They clinked glasses and took each other's hand in their own. Their compartment started going up and John squeezed Sherlock's hand a bit tighter.
"See you tomorrow then," Sherlock said gritting his teeth. What he wanted in return was a date, but he doubted John would be up for that. He didn't really seem like he would be attracted to boys, but maybe there was a small chance...
“Truth or dare.” John stared at his flatmate.
Two short raps on the door, followed by more desperate knocking, sounded. Sherlock sprang up and threw open the door. John soaked all the way through from the rain, stood there with tears forming in his pale blue eyes.

“What is it, Sherlock?”
Now they were almost fully naked, with John still in his shirt, and both of them still in their boxers. John undid the buttons I his shirt slowly while kissing Sherlock softly. John was finished removing his shirt, and now they were bare chest to bare chest, feeling each other hungrily and with so much need and passion. John slid his own boxers down and did the same with Sherlock’s. The feeling of their bare skin rubbing together and what they were about to do, made them both achingly hard.
"You're going to have to get up your courage and ask him out, you know. It's been a few days." Greg said walking up behind him while Sherlock was at the drinking fountain. He spit out the water before he could choke and turned around quickly.
"You seem like you could use some time with a friend. Don't we all?" John smiled.
“How do I look?” Sherlock came out of his room and stood in front of John shyly.
"That game scares me," Sherlock said honestly.
"I want to know what makes Sherlock Holmes tick. Who are you? I barely know." John leaned forward a bit.
Sherlock went back to his laptop and John sat at the table across from him. He sipped his tea and his mind wandered back to the thoughts that he was having before he’d fallen asleep. He felt his face get hot, as he remembered one of the more explicit thoughts he had experienced. Sherlock was too engrossed in his laptop to notice his rosy cheeks, and John was grateful for that. He wondered what it was like in Sherlock’s mind palace. It must be a magnificent, terrifying place. The kind of place that Sherlock was naturally drawn to. He finished off his cuppa and stood. Sherlock hadn't touched his and John sighed knowing that it would be cold before Sherlock even remembered it was there.
"You're bloody incredible."
“Shh keep your voice down, mate. It’s supposed to be a surprise!” John whispered, remembering that Sherlock wasn’t that far away.
Sherlock couldn't speak. His throat had closed up and his mouth had become dry.
"Wow," he heard John whisper.
pants was enough to push him over the edge and he came with a groan.
“Thanks for the help John!” He yelled back and purposefully pulled down his boxers before he got fully into the bathroom. He was positive John could see.
"Goodnight, John."
"Good evening, Captain Watson." John got up from the bed and walked over towards Sherlock with long, confident strides.
John: Hey Molly, it's John.
"Truth or dare?" John whispered, still staring.
John: Hey mate, you free tonight?
"Sherlock are you there? It's John."
“How about we start with the basics? Show me what you remember.” Sherlock nodded and positioned himself. Although John knew how Sherlock’s body worked while they were being intimate, dancing showed off Sherlock’s physique in a much more beautiful and pure way. His body moved in a balance of perfect, precise movements and long, passionate ones. John was in awe of how flawless Sherlock’s meticulous motions were. He felt his breath hitch in his throat as Sherlock did a jeté and landed with barely a sound. From there he moved gracefully into a piroutté. John would never cease to be amazed by Sherlock dancing. One who didn’t know Sherlock might never assume that he was musically gifted, but John knew.
He set his cup in the sink and went to his back to his room. He turned the light on and the bulb flickered a few times before returning to its previous dark state. He sighed and called out,
"I haven't, no. I'm sure you've deduced why." John said with a pained smile.
“I need- need you to pick me up.”
"Don't push your luck." They stepped into their compartment and sat down next to each other. It was quite spacious and there was champagne and truffles as promised in the center. Sherlock poured John a glass and then one for himself.
"No, because I have something better in mind," Sherlock said with a smirk. He placed a quick kiss on John's lips, then left to go to his room.
It made sense that Sherlock was a mess when John wasn't there by his side. He couldn’t think of any reason why John wouldn’t still love him, but he worried anyway. He had seen Sherlock break down in front of the people who should love him the most. And yet, the people who should have loved him the most, his parents, had allowed those horrendous things to be done to him. Sherlock hadn’t trusted anyone after that. Except for John, of course.
"It's really beautiful," Sherlock said managing to look into John's deep blue eyes.
"You're so great."
Hello everyone! I regret to inform you that there will be a short hiatus before chapter 16 will be posted. It will be 2 weeks at most and it is because I will be cleaning up my earlier chapters (feel free to give me suggestions.) Also, I need to get ready for the start of school. Thank you all for the support and I love you!
"Well," John squeezed Sherlock's hand and let go. Immediately he felt the absence and wished it could be filled again, "time for class, I guess."
"Yes, an "excellent" actor with a huge ego and a brain to match."
"Well, I've got to get to my class now. I believe it's science." John said and started to walk away. Sherlock was glad he hadn't taken another sip of water because he would probably have done a spit take again.
"Sherlock, believe me when I tell you that I didn't save you; you saved me. I was lost in the suffocating darkness of depression and I didn't care. Hell, I didn't want to get better; I had no reason to. Until you." Sherlock took John's head in his hands and brought him closer into a tender kiss. It was the most delicate that they had ever shared; full of love and content.
“Very handsome. I think that a silver band would suit him very nicely. We have our selection right here.” she gestured to a bunch of gorgeous silver bands and one immediately stood out to Sherlock.
"God, Sherlock. Are you kidding me? There's no one like you. You're extraordinary and unique." John seemed like he believed everything he was saying.
“What happened?”
"I hope you're not missing me too terribly. SH" John sighed at just how egotistical Sherlock could be.
“Mycroft was always the smarter one. We should have just let you stay gone when you first ran away. Remember that, Sherlock? When you were eight?” Sherlock’s head spun as the memories washed over him, dragging him under and threatening to drown him.
“Sherlock wait. I’m not embarrassed by you!” John shouted as he went inside and tossed his coat down. Sherlock was lying on the couch with his eyes closed, fingers steepled, and breathing deeply.
“Let us help you.” His father took a step towards him.
John couldn't believe what he was reading. He stared at the text over and over again, overanalyzing. Although overanalyzing was Sherlock's special talent, John occasionally couldn't help but think too much about something.
.~.~.~.~
"John, I miss you. I need you here. SH."
"John?" Sherlock called through the flat.
“Come on let’s get these clothes off of you and get you into the shower.” John must have realized how that sounded because he quickly turned red and looked down.
"What the hell?" He gasped at the spotless kitchen. "I was in the shower for 10 minutes and you cleaned the kitchen?"
"I love you too, John." Sherlock’s breathing was becoming more faint and John could feel his heartbeat slowing. He heard the sound of sirens coming from the distance as he clung on to Sherlock’s lifeless body in the cold alley.
Sherlock immediately grabbed John’s hand and pulled him out of Angelo’s hospital room.
"It's becoming clearer," John grinned and started sketching in a blank section.
"The view is fantastic," John said looking out from where they were. It was a clear day and they could see all of London displayed in front of them. It still made John a little uneasy to be so high up, but he could always squeeze Sherlock's hand for support. They were practically glued together; neither of them moving more than a centimeter away from each other. It was all so amazing, and John couldn't believe that Sherlock had arranged all this for him.
“Tell me what you want,” John said in the most commanding army voice he could muster. Sherlock actually whimpered and looked up at him with pleading eyes.
"Don't we have to get in line?" John asked trying to keep up with Sherlock's long stride.
"It's getting late, want to head back?" Sherlock asked, no doubt worried about how John all of a sudden looked as if he made a life-changing discovery. Which in a way,
"To us," John said raising his glass with a smile.
"Hm, how about ice skating?" John wrapped his arms around Sherlock's waist and buried his head into his back.
John: Hello?
They walked over to a park bench and sat together, watching the lights come on in the distance as it started to get dark. Why was John suddenly feeling this way about Sherlock? It's not like Sherlock had these thoughts about John. Well, he didn't exactly know that. John sighed deeply. Was he really developing a crush on his best friend? That couldn't be safe. Sherlock rarely showed affection unless it was to John. Wait... Only to John. Was it possible that Sherlock was hinting at something? No; John was his friend and that was it. They solved crimes together and shared a flat, but that was it. That was all it could ever be.
"Get out now John! I can't have you here right now. I just can't. You betrayed my trust and I just can't." Sherlock looked so desperate and helpless, sitting there on the ground with tears streaming down his face. He looked like the frightened teenager must have, all those years ago. Sitting in a chair in a bright room being poked and prodded and jabbed. John's heart ached when he thought of what Sherlock must have gone through.
“Come dear. We must get you home.” His mother said normally.
"Don't take one step further. I cannot do this right now; not tonight."
~.~.~.~.~
(See the end of the chapter for
help.” John thought about that. “I don’t think you can, this time, Sherlock.” “Why would you think I was embarrassed by you?” John asked, sitting down on the chair facing Sherlock.
"I'm just joking! I could use the fresh air." John said, enjoying the annoyed look on Sherlock’s face.
“I will drag you off the couch if you don’t get up.”
Setting his phone down on the table once more, John closed his eyes and drifted into a light sleep.
He closed the door and immediately took his trousers and pants off in a hurry. He almost couldn’t get them off fast enough. A few strokes and picturing Sherlock’s arse in those
"John!" Sherlock yelled and braced himself into the bed frame.
“John! Lying around isn’t going to help.”
"Truth or dare?" John thought for a moment.
"Sherlock?"
"Cool," Sherlock said absently and walked towards his next class, sighing every step at how in love with John Watson he was.
John: Great. I'll see you there.
You all must hate me for how long it takes me to update! ;-; I promise, I'm not trying to make you guys suffer (sort of). I'm so close to the end of this fic!! Just bear with me guys, it's almost summer so I'll have tons of time to write :D Thanks for sticking with me and believing in me.
"I think it's time for us to get on," Sherlock said and grabbed John's hand.
They had moved from the floor, after their mind blowing shag, onto the much softer couch to cuddle. Sherlock's head was in John's lap and John was absentmindedly playing with Sherlock's curls. He was essentially petting Sherlock's head, but he didn't seem to mind, so John continued.
"I see," Sherlock said, obviously skeptical of John's claim. "Well I'm glad you found what you were looking for," Sherlock nodded and walked into his bedroom shutting the door. John let out a sigh and plopped down on the sofa to watch some TV.
“Yes, please,” John said smiling. Sherlock couldn’t bring his eyes off of him. He knew his defense was slowly crumbling. The facade he put up, to make people think he was a horrible sociopath, so they would steer clear and not get hurt. There were times that he didn’t care. He wanted to be vulnerable for once and just be held in John’s protective arms. They sat across from each other at a small, metal table and said nothing.
John's POV
Guys! Oh, how I have missed you! It has been far too long! I am so sorry that I haven't updated this in over a month. I haven't had any time at all to write and I apologize. Hopefully, I'll get back on track and go back to weekly updates. Until then! Enjoy!
“For everything.”
"Dumb name. Old sign. The only reason they are still in business is because they have no competition."
The whole next day was filled with wallowing in self-pity, roaming around Harry’s flat in search of something to do, not finding anything to do, sitting down on the couch, and wallowing in self-pity some more. By the time the sun started setting, John realized just how boring a day without Sherlock was. He remembered how incredibly boring his days were, post-army and pre-Sherlock.
"I-I brought you some flowers." He said handing John the bouquet, flustered. They were beautiful; blues and purples combined. John smiled and led Sherlock over to the bed. He put the flowers on the bedside table and pulled Sherlock into a kiss. Sherlock quickly kissed back with equal force and passion. They fell onto the bed and continued their kiss; John was running his hands through Sherlock's curls hungrily and enjoying the soft moans coming from the man underneath him.
"Of course, love. See you tomorrow."
"What about you Dr. Watson? Any kinks I should know about?" Sherlock asked in a velvety voice.
"Sherlock?"
“Nevermind it; I’m starving,” John said grabbing Sherlock’s hand and pulling him along. Sherlock gasped quietly at the touch and followed wordlessly.
OOOOOOOPS. Sorry guys. I had every intention of posting this earlier, but I kind of forgot... This one is a bit short, sorry.
"God, me too."
"I suppose if you said thank you, it must be true." John laughed.
When they got to the crime scene Sherlock hopped out of the cab quickly, leaving John to pay.
"Is that all? SH"
"I only told you that so you'd come over and spend time with me." Sherlock gulped.
"Jesus, Sherlock! That must have cost you a fortune. Why would you spend that much?"
"Yeah, okay." John just rolled his eyes. "So how are we going to decorate the cake?"
“But I’m exhausted, John!” He pouted, actually feeling tired.
"Navy blue."
"Will you fuck me now,
"Please, Sherlock." He heard the desperation in his own shaky voice. Pushing down on Sherlock’s abdomen as hard as he could. "Don't leave me." John collapsed on the cement sobbing, clutching Sherlock’s freezing hand. He felt a small squeeze in return and quickly sat up.
"Come here, you" John pressed himself against Sherlock and kissed him passionately. He pressed Sherlock up against the glass and let his hands wander. He heard Sherlock let out a small moan and he felt himself get hard.
“Do you have a picture of this young man? I want to see which colour would best suit his skin tone.” Sherlock nodded and dug out his phone, finding the best picture he could of John.
"Do you know how to bake?" He called into the other room.
At about 10 o’clock, Sherlock got a call from Mycroft. John couldn’t hear much over the loud shouts, but he did manage to understand that Sherlock and Mycroft’s parents had tried to confront Mycroft too. They knew that he had a position in the British government and tried to find him. Luckily security had stopped them, but Mycroft was still miffed. Sherlock hung up and walked back over to John. He looked like her was in desperate need of a hug, so John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s torso and mumbled reassuring things to Sherlock.
"Listen to me, John. I am going to lose it if you don't fuck me now. Just get on with it.
"Alright everyone, before we tune, I would like to introduce our new student. His name is John Watson and he's a cellist and pianist. I hope you all will welcome him warmly into our little orchestra." Mr. Uyehara addressed the students. Sherlock looked back at him and smiled. John smiled back with a small hint of a blush. Probably just from all the attention he was getting. Sherlock was determined to make John like him, even if all he could do was a platonic relationship.
“Uh… Same as him.”
"Uh, thank you."
The best word to describe what Sherlock was feeling right now? Shock. His whole damn world had been flipped upside down and he had no warning whatsoever as the awful memories flooded through his brain. It was as if actually seeing his parents had broken the dam that he had worked so hard to build after all these years that was keeping those unwanted memories pushed back. In his mind palace, those memories had been placed in a vault. He knew they were there, but until he actually saw them, actually felt them, did he remember.
"Truth."
“I do miss him,” John confessed.
the best way to preface something.” Sherlock’s voice was shaking.
The check was delivered and John paid as promised. Sherlock, to John's pleasant surprise, asked for boxes to carry home the leftover food. John figured Sherlock did it just to make him happy, but he was still proud of him.
“I think,” John said, tracing Sherlock's jawline with his lips and leaving a trail of kisses down his neck , “you need to be taught a lesson.”
"Then tell me, what would you like to do today?"
"You really do."
A slideshow of his absolute worst memories played non-stop in his mind, but none of them were even close to as bad as the situation before him. He blinked back tears and tried to swallow down the panic that was quickly rising up in his throat. He put as much pressure on the wound as he could to keep Sherlock from losing as much blood as possible, even though the blood and the cold made him want to throw up. John was used to blood. As an army doctor, he had seen his fair share of bullet wounds, most of them fatal, but the sight of Sherlock bleeding out in front of him made him sick. There was so much; soaking through Sherlock’s clothes and onto his hands. He still heard no ambulance coming to their rescue.
Last one for a little bit. I'll get to writing, though, so don't you worry.
“It’s not that late!” John protested.
“I bet” John couldn’t help but smile.
“Jo-John? Can you- would you-” someone slurred.
As hard as it was, John tried hard to act natural the whole time they were walking back to the flat. Sherlock kept pestering him about his sudden change in attitude. John insisted that he was fine, but he figured that Sherlock knew otherwise. He
“I choose a dare this time. Why not spice things up?” John thought that was probably the worst thing that they could do right now, considering the fact that he wanted to shove Sherlock up against a wall and fuck him into submission. He focused again and realized that he was clenching his fist and staring at the wall while biting his lip.
"Yeah, it was quite a journey." John took Sherlock's hand and squeezed it.
"A duet then?" John asked happily and tightened his bow a bit more.
"You're not nervous are you?" John asked him while they were walking in the halls together before last period.
"Sherlock? You okay?" John called out. Still silence. He moved towards the door and realized why Sherlock had frozen in place. An elderly couple was standing in the doorway.
“Get the fuck away from him, you hear me?” John pulled his gun out and growled at them. He must have looked absolutely terrifying because the two of them glanced at each other and backed away slowly. John aimed his gun at one of them and said, “If you don’t get the hell out of here now, I will fucking shoot you. Don’t think that I won’t. Do you know who you just shot? The world’s smartest consulting detective and
“John? SH”
"Yes?"
“Mmhm,” Sherlock hummed in response. John looked absolutely smitten, and Sherlock wanted to shove him up against the wall right now and kiss the life out of him. He fought back every urge and instead licked his lips and started walking to the bathroom.
"Wear something comfortable!" He called from his bedroom.
"I've got to go out for a bit today. I'll be back before lunch okay?" Sherlock said after they had snogged a bit in bed and then had their morning tea.
Greg: Alright sounds good, I'll be there.
Sherlock's POV
“Of course, my darling.” Sherlock smiled and squeezed back.
He slowly climbed out of bed and walked to his bathroom for a quick shower and freshening up. When he had finished, the music was still going on. It had gotten faster and the notes were a shorter, more intense staccato. It reminded John of being on a fast-paced case; possibly being in pursuit of a criminal and chasing him through the winding streets of London. John quickly put on a robe and walked out as quietly as he could. He loved watching Sherlock play. It was so incredibly amazing that he could transform everything in his life into music that could make you feel everything he was feeling right along with him. He just stood there mesmerized by Sherlock's music for what seemed like forever. Sherlock ended the piece and John clapped before he could stop himself. He sat down embarrassed. "Oh, John. you're up." Sherlock said as he set his violin back in the case and loosened his bow.
John felt himself get close and sped up, even more, pushing Sherlock into the mattress like he'd promised. With one last slap and pull, Sherlock came yelling John's name, squirted all over John's hand, and buried his face in the sheets. A couple thrusts later, John came into Sherlock's arse hole and fell on the bed in a sweaty mess next to Sherlock. He admired the work he had done on Sherlock's back, the bright hickeys gorgeous on his pale, alabaster skin. Neither of them said a word and just laid there breathing heavily and holding hands. They didn't bother to put on clothes, and just curled up together and fell asleep in each other's arms.
He clicked on William Holmes and copied down the address onto a piece of paper. He carefully closed the address book and left the laptop looking as if it hadn't been touched at all. Hopefully, Sherlock wouldn't use his deductive skills to figure out what John was doing. He might try to stop him, and that was not going to help. On his own computer, John put the email address into his mail account and thought of what to say. What he finally came up was pretty good.
Despite John's sensible advice, Sherlock couldn't help it. These people had caused so much physical and emotional damage in Sherlock's life. There was no way to ever fully recover. Sherlock knew what seeing them again, talking to them would do to him. He knew he had to prepare himself for all of the awful memories to come flooding back like a tsunami of terror. John was the only reason why he was agreeing to be in their presence. He absolutely believed that John wouldn't let anything bad happen to him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and went back to picking at his tofu. John could just make out a hint of pink on Sherlock’s cheeks and a dimpled smile.
"I'm close, Sherlock," John said, feeling the sweat dripping down his forehead. Sherlock reached out to John and his fingernails dug into his right shoulder.
"I just-" Sherlock was interrupted by the last voice he wanted to hear at this moment.
“Truth.”
“Well, there was this one guy back at college. We never dated, though. We were best friends and I’m pretty sure I had a crush on him. We never saw each other after college. He was the only other person that made me question my sexuality.”
Mycroft: Oh alright. Will there be cake?
"Do you have lube and a condom?" John asked cupping Sherlock's face. He got up quickly and ran to his bedroom. When he emerged just a few seconds later, he had a tube of it in his hand.
“You boys need to get some sleep.”
“You really did fuck up.” she said grimacing.
"My name's John. John Watson. I'm supposed to be in the orchestra class that starts in half an hour. Your playing sounded amazing by the way. Are you the first violin?" Sherlock tried to speak, but the words refused to come out.
"Be a good boy and suck me," John commanded. Sherlock quickly went on his knees and did as he was told. He took John's head between his perfect, pink lips and flicked his tongue over the top quickly. John felt the heat pooling in his groin as Sherlock repeated these motions again. His eyes met Sherlock's and he heard a small whimper come from him.
.~.~.~.~
Sherlock cut him off, “Well, you need to figure out a way to say it because I feel like I’m going to pass out.”
“Oh, well perhaps those aren’t the best words.” his father said quickly, seeing the anger flash in his eyes. Sherlock took a few deep breaths, telling himself to stay calm.
"Do you want to be a good little boy for daddy?" Sherlock nodded eagerly. "Go deeper Sherlock. Deep throat for me, baby." Sherlock moaned at the new instructions and took John's whole cock down his throat.
~.~.~.~.~
"What did you think would happen? I assume that you know about them because of the letters right? I knew I should have kept them more hidden. I knew you would get too damn curious for
"You've got to get the milk."
"That is how we bond usually. If it weren't for you spilling tea on me, I never would have taken off my clothes in front of you. Which led to you finally working up your courage and admitting your feelings for me while taking me up against a wall aggressively."
“Alright, sounds reasonable. Thanks for coming over here.”
“He sounded a bit too enthusiastic when I called and mentioned a dead body, although thinking about it now, that does sound like Sherlock.” John laughed.
When Sherlock woke up, he was momentarily confused until he remembered where he was. The next part of confusion came when he felt heavier than normal. He looked out the window and saw that it was still dark. When his eyes finally adjusted enough for him to see what was going on, he almost had a heart attack. John was wrapped around Sherlock’s long, bare legs, still snoring peacefully. Oh god, when did this happen? He hesitantly moved his hand towards John and rested it on his head. When John didn’t move, Sherlock started to run his hands through it gently. He had every intention of moving it before he fell back to sleep, but that was not what happened.
"About what?" Sherlock slowed a bit.
“Too easy, John. Gay.” Sherlock said smirking and taking a sip of his wine. John relaxed a bit more.
"That was fun." John giggled. Sherlock thought it was more arousing than fun, but he didn't dare say that out loud. John hoisted himself up and rifled through his dresser. He finally found a large shirt and tossed it at Sherlock.
Half an hour later they were standing in front the London Eye. Sherlock brought to tickets out of his coat pocket.
“I hardly ever joke, John. Sit down and let’s play. I’ll get you some wine.”
“Oh god, I want- I want so many things. Fuck me- God please, John. Just fuck me.” Sherlock cried out.
"Real mature, John. I'll get the milk sometimes. Deal?" John positioned himself so that he was on top of Sherlock and had his head resting on Sherlock's chest.
"You don't say much do you?" Sherlock wanted to say a million things to John, but it was better to know for sure.
“He doesn’t want to talk to me. He was so angry, you don’t understand.”
. So, if you know what’s good for you, you will run and never look back because I will hunt you down and make you pay.” Apparently, they needed no more convincing than that. They took off down the alley and disappeared around the corner.
"What's up you and the curly haired girl?" John said taking a bite of his sandwich. Sherlock saw him eating alone and invited him over to the table that he normally sat at. Greg Lestrade and Mike Stamford joined them.
"I know." John stuck his tongue out at Sherlock's ever growing ego. Sherlock took the opportunity to put his, now clean hands, on the sides of John's face and kiss him. They spent a full two minutes snogging there in the kitchen.
"Sherlock wait. I won't- I'm not going to be able to last that much longer." John panted.
“I’ll be right back. Have to use the loo.” John excused himself while Sherlock flashed him a knowing smile.
Hey, guys. Sorry for not updating in a while. Hopefully, this long chapter will make up for it? Probably not... Please rec this fic to your friends if you think they would like it :)
"This is it right? I'm still kind of new around this campus." Sherlock nodded at him.
~.~.~.~.~.
. That was all John could think about on the way back to Baker Street. He had to admit that Sherlock did have pretty adorable cheekbones. And his eyes… John mentally slapped himself. If he thought about Sherlock anymore, he might start to drool and that would definitely arouse some suspicion. He knew now, that he was attracted to Sherlock, but this was getting out of hand. If Sherlock found out he would no doubt want to end the friendship and that would kill John. Sherlock was John’s only best friend. Someone he really trusted about his past.
"Everyone?" Sherlock said with a pouty face.
"Only if you promise me that you will shag me very hard back at the flat." Sherlock kissed John again.
“How could you?” Sherlock whispered hoarsely.
“Sherlock I’m so sorry, I’m such a klutz! I didn’t think that there was a teacup there and-” Sherlock stopped him.
"Are you ready for my cock?" John asked Sherlock slyly.
“I’ll be right there the whole time, love. You don’t need to be nervous. If they say just one thing to upset you, I’ll throw them out.” That got a small smile from Sherlock.
"What took you so long?" Sherlock said raising his eyebrow further than John thought was possible. "I couldn't um... find the lightbulbs at first, but I got them now" John stumbled through his lie.
"What's the matter, love?" John said kissing Sherlock quickly.
"No." Sherlock started mixing a new bowl of batter.
“You don’t have to, but if you do, I’ll be right next to you the whole time.” Sherlock looked up lovingly and John and they cuddled some more in each other’s arms, the drama slowly being forgotten and forgiven.
“I think so, too,” Sherlock smirked.
"Bad idea."
~.~.~.~.~
“I can’t lose you, Sherlock. I love you.”
"We should do something fun. You know as a new couple." John said as he walked over to Sherlock.
"Tell me you want this, Sherlock." John said cautiously, "I need to make sure that I'm allowed."
"Favorite color?"
The sexual chemistry between Sherlock and John Watson was deliciously hot and undeniable. John took Sherlock to places he wouldn’t have been able to go to on his own. Before the two of them had confessed their feelings for each other, Sherlock had often fantasized about what John could do to him and how sexy it would be for him to pull rank in the bedroom and take control. He had absolutely no problem with being a bottom and letting John top. In fact, he loved every second of it. Something about the way John growled and panted as they fucked, made Sherlock painfully hard. Oh, how many lonely nights Sherlock had spent in his room stroking himself and picturing John’s hands and lips all over his body, not knowing that John had had the same feelings for him. All of the tension and sexual frustration had built up and made it so much hotter when they finally got to devour each other.
.~.~.~.~.
John felt like he might throw up. He had caused all of Sherlock’s misery just because he couldn’t stay away from a challenge. He really thought he could help Sherlock with his family troubles. He sat down on the curb and buried his face in his hands. How was he ever going to fix this?
“Tell me what to do. I want to obey your every command. Punish me if I misbehave.” John felt himself get even harder at Sherlock’s words and all he wanted was Sherlock’s gorgeous lips around his cock; sucking him until he couldn’t take it anymore.
“What?”
“Of course, love. Anything.” Sherlock felt like an infant in John’s arms, but that didn’t matter right now. All that mattered was that he was loved and John was always going to be there for him, no matter what.
John: Hello?
“I’m Dr. Watson, but please call me John. My er- partner, Sherlock Holmes is the one who will be receiving lessons. He’s just this way, please come in.”
“It’s been so long since I’ve worn them, I wasn’t sure they’d fit.” He wrung his hands nervously, blushing slightly.
John: Great. I'll see you there. Bye.
“Sorry. Anyway here’s what I think. On one hand it wasn’t really your fault because you didn’t know what Sherlock’s parents had done to him. But on the other hand, you did snoop in his private things.” John looked down in shame.
"So this, uh, coming out party is real?" Molly asked in disbelief.
"You think I'm handsome?" Sherlock asked in shock.
“Well, she’s the boss. We better do as she says.” John said and hopped onto his bed. Sherlock stayed seated on the floor and stared at the bed wearily.
"See you!" *click*. He exhaled in relief. His first phone call with John hadn't sucked completely.
Finally, John reached the alley behind Angelo’s. As he drew closer, he could hear arguing and shouting. He stumbled backward as the reality of the situation hit him like a tidal wave crashing down on him. His heart dropped into his stomach as he heard Sherlock cry out in pain. He stood completely frozen and helpless as he heard the gunshot and a body drop to the ground. The blood rushing to his head all at once, made it nearly impossible to form a coherent thought. Sherlock cried out in agony again, but this time he cried out for John. Immediately, John unfroze and rushed into the conflict.
“I want to hear you play the cello,” Sherlock said eagerly.
"Want to get something to eat?" John said squeezing Sherlock's hand gently.
“Truth or dare, captain?” Sherlock asked grinning.
John thought to himself. Sherlock had never mentioned his parents now that he thought about it. Maybe he should call them up and invite them to Baker Street. Sherlock could probably use a bit of family. He decided that he would contact the Holmes family and have a reunion whether Sherlock approved of it or not.
"You're going to need this."
"I was hoping there would be some of that in our private capsule." He wiggled his eyebrows at the word private.
When they got back to the flat, Sherlock immediately sat on the couch and started up his laptop. John decided to take a nap since he was almost asleep before Sherlock had to bloody wake him up. He kicked his shoes off and fell onto the bed with a sigh. He curled up under the covers and allowed himself some time to think. John knew that what Lestrade had said was what had been bothering him.
John's POV
“Don’t be upset please,” John said, looking down.
"Please leave. I need you out of the flat right now."
“He was wonderful” Valerian smiled and patted Sherlock on the back lightly.
Sherlock's bow glided gracefully over the strings of his violin, emitting a sweet melody. His long fingers delicately placed to get the correct notes, using just the right amount of vibrato and applying the dynamics accordingly. He neared the end of the peace and slowed down gradually. He held the last note and let it ring in the air for a few seconds, then put his bow and violin back into their case. It was at that moment that he noticed another presence in the room. He turned and saw a boy his age staring curiously at him. He had dirty blond hair, blue eyes, and a cute button nose. Sherlock felt his face get hot as he checked him out. The boy spoke with a shy smile.
“Truth.”
"Well, the thought did cross my mind." Mycroft glared back.
One day John wore his tightest suit that showed off his muscular shoulders and tight arse. The next day, Sherlock rebutted by flirting with literally everyone that came near him. John wanted so badly, to kiss him in front of all those people, but he wasn’t prepared to give up just yet.
"You're going to be okay. You have to be okay." John reassured Sherlock, but mainly himself.
“The people who tried to kill you were hired by your parents. The car out there is owned by some of Mycroft’s men. He made sure that they would be out there to protect you because, well…” John trailed off.
"No that's alright, keep working." John said as he walked over to the other bedroom.
“I suppose I have to confront my parents.” Sherlock looked anxious. John placed a kiss on Sherlock’s cheek and squeezed his hand.
Please," Sherlock begged him, "I need you
An older woman immediately greeted him and smiled.
"Water we talking about?" John asked and then giggled, "get it? Water? Because we're at a drinking fountain?" Sherlock managed to smile even though all his instincts were telling him to leave right now while he still could.
“You’re being too nice. What’s the catch?”
cake:
“You know perfectly well what I’m talking about! The tests, the abuse, the neglect!” Sherlock’s voice raised to a shout.
"From the beginning." They started playing and Sherlock knew he was losing control of his emotions. How could he be crushing on John this fast? Sherlock for once in his life didn't know. It was infuriating, but he couldn't stay angry. Every time he looked at John his scowl magically morphed into the biggest smile. About halfway through the piece, a voice interrupted their playing.
"Thank you, Sherlock. Thank you for being there for me." Sherlock nodded and handed him his pencil.
"It says mf
"I like to get in some practice before class starts," Sherlock said still staring at the blond boy.
“Harry? Where are you?” He asked his sister.
He groaned and crawled out of bed to make himself a cup of tea. John would still love him even though he pushed him away, right? He understood that Sherlock had needed some time to cope with seeing his parents, right? Sherlock started to sweat profusely, feeling the material of his shirt sticking to his skin, he unbuttoned it and threw it to the ground. How was he going to face John later if he couldn’t even function properly without him? Sherlock sat on the sofa and buried his head in his hands in defeat. He really loved John and losing him… Losing him would kill him.
“What do you think would be the best way to meet your parents?” John asked Sherlock after taking his hand and massaging an area by moving his thumb in small circles. Sherlock took a deep breath.
P.S. If any of you were wondering my tumblr URL is mybaeisbaymax so go check it out! Okay bye!
Back at the flat with containers of Chinese food strewn everywhere, John suggested that they watch a bit of telly and then go to bed.
“John? SH”
“They’re still out there aren’t they?” Sherlock’s heart dropped as John nodded. Sherlock felt his chest tighten and his vision go blurry. He started panicking and heard the phone ringing as he fell on the ground, hyperventilating. John answered in a panicked voice and Sherlock heard Lestrade’s shouting voice through the phone.
"So, what about us? I mean, I assume we aren't just friends and flatmates anymore." John asked cautiously. He didn't want to upset Sherlock.
John heard knocking at the door and immediately he could feel Sherlock’s excitement rise.
"I'm uh, I'm fine. Thanks. How about you?" Sherlock was still in shock that John Watson had called him.
Mrs. Hudson: Oh of course! I'll see you there dear. Tell Sherlock I said hello.
“Can we go to yours?” Sherlock said in between weak sobs, “It smells like you.”
"Today we will watch a PowerPoint presentation made for you by Anderson Michaels on how certain chemicals behave." Mr. Coleman started off class. Sherlock couldn't stop himself from rolling his eyes. Anderson was a stuck up fool, who just happened to be Mr. Coleman's pet. It didn't matter, though, because Sherlock was Mr. Uyehara's pet and that made Sally Donovan pretty pissed. Sally and Anderson were known around school as being the "power couple." Whatever that meant...
having a good time, John. Thank you for bringing me."
"Love you too."
"That can definitely be arranged." John bit his lip.
John needed to figure out what to do. Should he risk it all and tell Sherlock, just to possibly get rejected and lose the special friendship that they had? That was most likely what would happen and John just couldn’t bring himself to do it.
When they got off of the Eye, John was extremely happy that they were at ground level again, but he was also sad that his first date with Sherlock had come to an end. It was a surreal experience to walk hand in hand through the streets of London with his detective by his side, glancing over at him occasionally and smiling. John felt like a teenager again; all of the new emotions flooding through his body. He was sure that his dopamine levels were extremely high and he felt nothing but happiness as they walked side by side in the afternoon weather.
“Truth or dare?” Sherlock asked with a smug smile.
John's POV
"Well, I'm not as good as you are at violin, but hopefully, those four years have given me some ability." He sat down and positioned his cello. Sherlock recognized the piece after the first few notes and he felt his heart beat faster. Viva la Vida by Coldplay. John played it perfectly and Sherlock was glad that he was already sitting down.
"I hope you don't mind if we both share that bed. We're a bit short on space and I don't want to have to make you sleep on the floor. It's big enough right?" Sherlock felt his eye twitch.
so I'm guessing mezzo forte. Which means medium loud."
"I love you." Was all Sherlock said before wrapping his arms around John and burying his face in the fabric of John's clothes.
"Yes well, Sherlock and I have some news," John smiled.
"You didn't answer my question." He said through gritted teeth. "What the hell are you doing here, at
"You don't have to worry. I'm going to help you get through it. Now that I can hold you and kiss you, things are different." They smiled at each other warmly.
Orchestra was probably Sherlock's favorite class next to Chemistry. Music was his outlet; it allowed him to feel certain emotions that others thought he was incapable of. People thought Sherlock was some kind of sociopathic freak because he only cared about a few people. Maybe if he could get John to like him, he could show them.
"I don't know why heights of all thi-" Sherlock quieted him.
“Are you going to explain what’s going on, or just sit there staring out the window?” John said after a few moments of painful silence.
"Alright, Coldplay it is." Mr. U said and took a sip of his tea, "I will get the sheet music printed out as soon as possible. For today, how about we do some scales, and then I'll let you out a bit early. Sound good?"
His thoughts from before hit him hard and he stopped dead in his tracks.
Greg: Bye.
"Come on. We should have a coming out party!" Sherlock laughed.
They arrived at the flat and John helped Sherlock out of the cab. He dragged him to the door and pushed him into the flat.
"Well, your "natural born ability" didn't work the first six times."
“Hello?”
"They sent me to clinics and had them use drugs and shock therapy on me," Sherlock whispered helplessly.
"Of course, you do... Nice handwriting btw"
"I wanted our first date to be perfect." He pouted.
~.~.~.~.~
"Who wouldn't?" John said in a small, shy voice.
“Then help me,” Sherlock said through gritted teeth. “Sherlock I really am sorry, but it’s none of your concern and I'm sure I'll be fine soon enough.” John lied. “Are you embarrassed by me?” Sherlock’s voice came out as a whisper.
John put his hand to his head and sighed. Whatever Sherlock had in mind, it wasn’t good. He was going to get himself seriously hurt or even killed if John wasn’t there to keep his emotions in check. John had always taken a huge amount of pride in the fact that he knew how to calm Sherlock down, how to make sure he wasn’t about to make a rash decision. Of course, this only helped as much as Sherlock allowed it to. And sometimes, he would take off running and make John feel like he didn’t even exist. This preyed on John’s insecurities and worry that Sherlock would find someone better than him. Someone who could better match him at an intellectual level: someone
"Or I'm just an excellent actor."
“What? Oh, um, dare okay. I dare you to…” he thought hard.
Sherlock smirked, feeling very smug.
“Something simple. Probably a gold or silver band would look best on him.”
"Well played. Yellow or orange. I can't decide."
“Are you sure you’re okay, Sherlock?” John said looking up at him with those intense blue eyes. There was the entire world trapped in his eyes. Dark blues with hints of green. It only made sense, because John was Sherlock’s entire world. For once Sherlock was at a loss for words.
"Yes. The joiner of these two lovely men." Greg laughed.
"Go put some clothes on. That towel is quite distracting." Sherlock said, panting.
“Okay, I’ll get dressed.” John sighed to himself and walked slowly up the stairs to the bathroom to get cleaned up.
“Hey, could you pass the cheese? I’m starving and I don’t think I can wait until the sandwich arrives.”
“Those are nice colors.”
“Why do you care anyway?” John spat out before he could stop himself. Sherlock’s facial expression hardened. “I’m your friend and it doesn’t take long for me to deduce that something is wrong. You have been drumming your fingers on the seat for a total of three minutes even though you usually have a completely still hand. You keep looking over at me and then looking away as if you can’t bear to look at me.” John was terrified. He was falling for Sherlock and because of that, he was getting all the wrong ideas about it.
“It’s very good to meet you, Mr. Valerian, sir.” Sherlock’s small, timid smile made it obvious to John that he must have been feeling a bit shy at this particular moment.
"Uh" was all Sherlock managed to get out. He felt like slamming his face on a desk until he blacked out and remembered nothing from the past few minutes. Actually, the past few days. Sure, John Watson made Sherlock's otherwise mundane life interesting, but at such a cost. He was actually starting to worry about his appearance now: using a bit of product in his hair and dressing differently each day. It was getting kind of exhausting, to say the least.
“I don’t want to talk about it right now.” John looked down nervously.
It lands all over Sherlock’s lap and he curses to himself, standing up quickly. The waiter that was behind him crashes into him and the tomato soup that was on the tray splashes all over Sherlock’s face and shirt.
By this time, it was almost midnight and the pavement was luckily devoid of pedestrians that could get into John’s way. As he neared Angelo’s he sprinted even faster. Memories of the very first case that he and Sherlock had ever shared together flooded his mind. He felt his face get hot and a tear escape and run down his cheek at the thought of Sherlock,
"I love science." Sherlock blurted out. It was a lame attempt to make John think he was cool.
"Aw come on. That's not true. You have tons of great features. Your height, your dark curly hair, your eyes, your-"
"M-me too" Sherlock stuttered and dug his fingernails deeper. John felt a pool of heat collecting in his groin, and he kept thrusting up into Sherlock. After a few more thrusts, John felt himself go over the edge and everything was momentarily white. He was vaguely aware of Sherlock coming to his climax as well and scraping his nails down John's back as he released with a loud shout. They collapsed on the floor in a heap of naked, sweatiness.
When John awoke, he expected to be alone. It was probably the best surprise ever to wake up to Sherlock's arms still wrapped tight around him. He was even snoring a little bit; little puffs in and out. It was incredibly cute and John couldn't help himself. He flipped over and kissed Sherlock awake.
"Yes, Daddy," He moaned and writhed in pleasure, "Can you leave love bites on me?"
“John.” Sherlock’s voice flooded through his thoughts and into his brain. He sat up on the sofa groggily and opened his eyes. The afternoon light was flooding through the crack in the closed curtains.
Molly: Hello John. Did you need something?
"Yours. I like the smell; It smells like you." John went up to his room to get changed into his sleep shirt and came back to find a fully naked Sherlock lying on the bed.
“Harry, where are you?” In an obviously intoxicated voice, she told him that she was at a bar a few streets away. John decided to walk there then call a taxi and ask if he could stay at her flat overnight. His feet were aching from all the walking he was doing tonight, but he knew he deserved every bit of pain. He arrived at the bar, and Harry was sitting outside on the front steps.
“I love you, John. I need to get out of this flat and get some fresh air, though. I’ll be back in a few hours.” John raised his eyebrow at that and something flashed across his face. Fear?
They arrived at a petite, Parisian cafe only a few miles from the flat.
“Please, call me Walter. Are you Dr. Watson or Mr. Holmes? Gregory is never specific enough.” He laughed.
When John awoke, the flat was silent. He figured Sherlock was busy on his laptop trying to solve the case. He went to the kitchen as silently as possible to make some tea for himself and Sherlock. He hummed quietly and waited for the water to boil. Sherlock sat at the table, his face illuminated by the glow of his laptop. He was completely engrossed and focused until he seemed to notice John’s presence and looked up. John smiled and Sherlock returned it warmly.
~.~.~.~.~.
“Sherlock it’s really comp-”
“I hope he will continue to have lessons with me, I would love to have him as one of my students.”
"What the hell are you doing here?" Sherlock yelled and immediately tensed up when they spoke.
“John?” he called out nervously.
“John, if I don’t…” Sherlock coughed and spit up an alarming amount of blood. “If I don’t make it, I want you to remember how much I love you. You changed my life and I am so grateful-” John cut him off with a kiss of pure desperation.
“Let me go! Let your abomination of a son go out into the world. I’ll probably just be stoned to death anyway for being such a sin!” He spat at his father. He was so shocked, his grip loosened and Sherlock managed to get his arm free. He ran out of the clinic and didn’t look back once. At the time, he knew those memories would haunt him, and he knew that eventually his parents would find him. He just didn’t know it would be at the hands of the person he loved most. He didn’t know that John could do such an awful thing.
“That is
"Since you've been such a good boy" John went to work on Sherlock's neck, sucking and biting until the skin turned red and purple. With every mark, he muttered a
“It won’t hurt.” He said and rolled over.
"Oh, no reason." Molly stared at her feet and tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear.
~.~.~.~.~
John: Actually, we're having a party at our flat tonight at 7 and we hope to see you there.
“Well, it’s your turn.”
"You're unbelievable." John gave him a quick kiss on the cheek.
“Get down on your knees and suck me,” John commanded. Immediately, Sherlock obeyed and grasped John at the base of his cock with his slender fingers. Again, a jolt of pleasure surged through him, and he instinctively bucked his hips forward. Sherlock lightly brushed his lips over the tip and John felt a gasp escape from his lips before he could stop it. Sherlock put his whole mouth over the head and John threw back his head and moaned.
"It's just the way I sleep, John. Now come here; I want to spoon." John sighed but crawled onto the bed quickly. Sherlock's arm immediately draped over him protectively and he felt his warmth envelope him.
"Joh-John?" Sherlock croaked. John burst into another fit of tears at the sight of Sherlock swallowing the blood that must have been in his throat. He had cuts all over his face and his eyes were almost completely swelled up. Whoever those people were, they had hurt Sherlock and John was going to find them. He was going to make them pay for what they had done.
What would it be like to date Sherlock… His thoughts started to wander and he stopped himself. They were best friends and flatmates. That was it. As far as John knew Sherlock was not interested in a relationship with anyone, except his work. “John, I think you should know that I consider myself married to my work.” Those were his exact words that night at Angelo’s. And more importantly, John was straight. Wasn’t he? He never really questioned his sexuality before because he had no reason to do so. He had dated women all his life. Was it possible? John groaned as his head started to hurt. He turned over and cleared his head as best as possible. Images of Sherlock drifted in and out of his thoughts. John had no time to do this now; he really needed to sleep. After a while, he finally drifted off.
“Oh, Sherlock Holmes,” Valerian laughed, “Please, call me Walter. I think that I can safely judge that you have had previous dance experience?” he asked, smiling.
"I'll clear the dishes." John volunteered. There was a knock on the door and John froze.
Sherlock saw John’s eyes flutter open and he immediately smiled and kissed him softly. It lasted longer than usual because Sherlock couldn’t bring himself to pull away.
He turned the faucet off and stepped out onto the bath towel. He grabbed the nearest towel and gave his hair a quick ruffle with it then wrapped it around his waist and exited the bathroom.
John didn't know where his destination was or when he would arrive, but he just kept walking. It was too dark to see 20 meters in front of him and the streetlights were his only means of seeing where he was going. How could he do this to Sherlock? He had specifically kept those memories locked away on purpose so that he wouldn’t have to face them. He left every letter from his parents unopened because he didn’t want to face them. He couldn’t. John understood now. He understood all of it too well. What this must be doing to Sherlock… He couldn’t possibly imagine what horrors he went through.
. He was actually crushing on Sherlock.
Sherlock knew something was up with John. He could always tell when John did just something a little differently and knew exactly what each thing meant. Not this time. He has absolutely no idea what was wrong with his flatmate. The more John acted strangely, the more it affected Sherlock. He knew he had feelings for John, and that they were in no way platonic, but he couldn’t control them. He had to push them down, even though all he longed to do was push his lips onto John’s and just lay together for hours. His eyes started to water as he imagined a future that couldn’t happen.
.~.~.~.~
Good news everyone! I finally got a new computer!!!! YAY. Writing and updating should be a lot easier now, so I'm excited about that. Enjoy this short-ish, angsty chapter.
"Just get home. I'm bored and I miss your lips."
“I know you miss him, John.” Harry sat down next to him and put her arm around him comfortingly like their mom used to. Unlike Sherlock’s parents, John’s were not alive anymore. They had passed away in a car accident when John was 11. To this day, he swore that if he ever found the drunk driver responsible for their death, they would wish they were dead.
"Sherlock, I love you. Look at me, love." Sherlock stared into the beautiful blue eyes of the man he loved, and the man who loved him, and he felt safe.
“You guys bicker like a married couple.” Harry laughed.
"Have you been a good boy? Do you deserve my cock in your ass?" John said with a smirk.
“221B Baker Street,” He told the cab driver and then closed his eyes.
“Sherlock actually; It’s all my fault.”
Sherlock wasn't the best at eating a lot. In fact, he barely ate twice a day, and that was only if John forced him to sit down and shoved a plate at him. So it was no surprise to John that Sherlock looked at the menu with distaste and only skimmed through. "Come on Sherlock. I took you to dinner and it's on me, so please just eat a little something?" Sherlock's face softened and he nodded slowly.
~.~.~.~.~
“Are you ready to place your order?”
"Are you going to art school? I mean after you're done with high school?" Sherlock blurted out. John's expression grew sad and he put down his pencil. "Sorry. I didn't mean-"
Goodnithe america
"Well, I can see that you've played the cello for three, no, four years now." John stared at him in utter disbelief.
“We’re together. As a couple.” John said as normally as he could. Harry practically exploded. “You’re what!? I’m only now just finding out about this?”
Sherlock's POV
"Be a good boy and spread your legs for me," John commanded. Sherlock moved slowly, and John reached out and slapped Sherlock's arse. He cried out in pleasure and groaned.
John’s POV
“Shite, Sherlock” John cried out as he kneeled to check where Sherlock had been shot. Blood was pouring out in a steady stream and John knew that Sherlock didn’t have much more time. They needed to get him to a hospital, and fast.
"Yeah, here." He handed him his nicest pencil and tried to smile normally. The whole concept of flirting was entirely new to Sherlock and he was pretty sure that he was failing miserably. Anderson started his presentation and Sherlock ignored it completely. John slid a piece of paper over to Sherlock that read:
“Yeah.” John smiled to himself. “I did; now I better not fuck this up.”
He thought about what Sherlock liked doing most in all the world. Well, aside from chasing murderers around London, that is. He loved to dance. That was one of the many things that John adored about Sherlock. He was an amazing dancer, but he never wanted to show people for fear of being judged.
"Incident? Unfortunate?" he whispered through gritted teeth.
When Sherlock slept, it took away years of pain and worry from his face and left him in a state that people rarely ever saw from him: vulnerable. John figured that he was the only person that Sherlock trusted to see him when he was in that state, and John was proud of that fact. He smiled knowing that Sherlock trusted him.
"Should we just buy the cake?" John sighed. Sherlock had flour in his hair and cake batter on his nose.
"But Sherlo-" his mother tried to say.
"Was I right, though?" Sherlock asked eagerly.
“What- No don’t be ridiculous” What was he supposed to be doing? He took in his surroundings. Right! Walking to lunch with John. He had just solved a case.
"Hey freak, you're in my seat," said a voice all too familiar. It reminded Sherlock of the bleakness of this class.
With that, John nodded and closed the distance between them with long strides. He then shoved Sherlock up into the wall behind him, while kissing him hungrily. Sherlock gasped and started to unbutton his pants, but John stopped him.
“Well?” they asked hopefully.
“I may not be a consulting detective like you, but I know a dancer’s stretch.” his eyes twinkled as a playful smile lit up his face.
His doubts were becoming larger and larger by the second. Was it really any of his business? He opened up the laptop and the home screen was displayed. There was no password, which John found a bit odd. He quickly clicked on the address book icon and waited for it to open. He typed Holmes in the search bar and saw 3 contacts pop up: Mycroft Holmes, William Holmes, and Katherine Holmes. John though it was a bit strange that Sherlock had to write this information down at all, but he only had room for "important" things in his mind palace. The email addresses for his family members were not important to him.
"Let's not shag this high up okay?" John said and laughed a bit harder than he meant to.
, I've wanted you to do this to me since I first met you. Don't make me wait any longer."
“And for you sir?” the waiter says addressing Sherlock.
"I never meant-"
"What's your favorite color?"
." Sherlock whimpered, falling apart in John's arms. John pressed him even harder into the wall and got more of the lube. He poured a good amount of it on himself and then threw the tube somewhere into the corner. He held Sherlock up and gently brushed the tip of his cock on Sherlock's arsehole. Seeing that Sherlock was barely holding on to consciousness at this point and probably wouldn't last very much longer, he slid in all the way and his cock was completely surrounded by Sherlock's warmth. The look on his face was something that John wanted to see every waking moment of his life. He wanted Sherlock's face of pure pleasure burned into his memory forever. His eyes were rolled back into his head, and he was making the most amazing noises that John had ever heard come out of a human being.
