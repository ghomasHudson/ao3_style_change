“No, it’s not, you’re doing the right thing.” Tony leads them to the open riverbed. Shield is standing waiting for them.
“There, that!” Tony says. He points at Steve. “That! Exactly that!”
Steve frowns. “I don’t think that’s what it was, Tony. It’s just nice to hear my name-.” He doesn’t add the rest – how he longs for him to say his name within a loving embrace. That’s something that will never happen for Steve. He puts the mug aside without having tasted it. “I think I should get dressed.” He’s only in a hospital gown – when did that happen?
“Pepper said that we’re to call her directly. She’ll get medical help here as soon as possible,” Vision says.
“Well, gentlemen?”
Part of his soul yearned to go through the light, to see what it offered. Anytime he turned away from it, his heart ached and the tug in his chest to focus on the light intensified. He had no choice. He needed to follow it, to answer it. He walked toward the spotlight as it flickered. He heard a murmur as if doctors and nurses spoke. He tried to discover where the sounds were coming from and then he saw a nurse materialize from the shadows. She rushed past him but acted like she never saw him at all. He stopped and watched the darkness encompass her. She had been wearing a very out of date nursing uniform – with that peculiar little hat they used to wear all those years ago. She wore all white, down to her stockings and shoes. He flinched.
“I think I got there because Tony forced me to, he called me on the carpet about it so many times that I knew not to go there,” Steve says. He shrugs. “Maybe you and Pepper are just so close to the situation and managing it for so long that you’re kind of shell shocked by the tiniest issue now.” He rushes to add, “Not that this was a tiny issue. It was huge.”
The words rang loud and clear. Mimicked. A mockery of the sacred, the recollections of a past not marred with this place – the place of desolation, the place of soullessness.
Steve nods and then sinks down onto the cushions of the bed. “I think I’d like to rest for a while.”
Real deal this time. I have been trying to keep ahead of the revisions so that I didn't have to break at all. Unfortunately RL just bit me this week as I have been trying to get ready for my surgery. So I will not post the next chapter until May 6th. I am sorry about that, but I figure with my surgery on Monday I will not be able to get to revising chapter 10 until later in the week and I cannot impose that much on thegraytigress. Plus with all the excitement for IW growing, well, I figure I don't want to post that weekend anyway. This will hopefully give me time to revise chapters 10 and 11. And to add the two extra chapters I decided to write. So thank you so much for sticking with this and all the good thoughts for my surgery and recovery, I really appreciate it! :) <3<3<3
“Nope. Thanks. Contrary to popular belief in my household I do know how to function as a blind person. Dummy and the glasses only go so far. I spend the vast majority of my time being visually impaired.”
“Whatever it is, it can wait,” Steve says, but he’s lying and he’s never been a good liar.
“Well, neither do blind guys, but hell I’ve always been a trendsetter.” He winks at Steve as he fastens the helmet. “Lead the way. By the way this isn’t a tricked out helmet, just to let you know. I’m at your mercy, Rogers.”
“I’m not sure what you mean.” The eggs, the meal suddenly tastes cold and jellied.
“Well, the point is getting a good Omega.” he says and starts down the ramp. She catches his arm and throws a jacket at him. Catching it, he notices for the first time she’s wearing a rain cape. It’s sleek and gray and makes her look at like all the orphans from the Lanes.
“Thank you.”
“When I was on the run with Natasha, we ended up in New Jersey. I think you know about that, where I was essentially – where Project Rebirth happened. Or part of it.”
“The undead should have stayed dead,” Ross said and then nodded to Pierce who left the window and addressed Steve.
“Yes, of course,” she says and smiles. “I could go over-.”
Or was it something else? Something more nefarious?
“Probably more than we planned.” Tony screws up his face in a disgruntled expression; a telltale sign he’s internally angry with himself for not adjusting for every scenario.
Tony chanced to reach over and put his hand on Steve’s that was sitting between them on top of the book. “Are you going to live your life now?”
Tony frowns. He hadn’t remembered Steve carrying a basket with him when they left this morning. “This – a picnic. We have to have a picnic?” He wonders if this is what Steve considers being good Personal Assistant. To Tony an excellent assistant helps him figure out how to get his implant upgraded and not give himself a stroke while also simultaneously looking for someone Tony might be able to relieve a little tension, but then that idea quickly devolves into imagining Steve in that role. And no. He’s not allowed that according to Pepper’s most recent lecture.
Tony clears his throat before he answers, and Steve stops his exploration but doesn’t release his hold. “I don’t think it will work like that on a macro level, but I do think it means our souls revolve around one another. A kind of push and pull, looping around one another.”
The prince only nods, his eyes firmly fixed to the ceiling. Steve takes great care to undress the prince and while he does his mind keeps falling back into the idea of calling him Tony – really being able to call a nobleman – a prince by his name – shoots straight to his own cock. Once Tony’s pants have been discarded on the floor, Steve places his legs over his shoulders. It’s heavy but Steve’s had worse.  A slight angle and he has all the access he needs. With a swooping lick, Steve teases Tony’s ass eliciting a shiver and a slight moan. He repeats it, but this time slows the motion and lingers at Tony’s entrance. He feels Tony grip the arms of the chair and raise himself up, easing Steve’s access.
Bruce huffs. “No, you’re not. You did something you wanted to do.” Steve can’t see exactly what Bruce is doing but he hears the rattling of a tray, blood draw supplies, and the monitor beeping that reads out his results. Bruce carries the tray over to him. “Roll up your sleeve.”
“Done on both accounts, boss.”
“Something like that,” Steve says. “We wanted a new start. And seems a lot of places back home treated Bucky like he was an invalid.”
“Hey, Blu, come back. I didn’t mean it. You’re a great host.”
“Don’t be cross, Tony. It’s too cold be to angry,” Steve said, and his voice dropped in pitch. The temperature followed his voice, growing colder and colder until Tony wrapped his arms around himself.
“Not if it reflects poorly on me!” Tony claps his hands and Jarvis goes rigid. “J can you bring tablet and call up the link-.”
“Some people like to have copies of what they sign, printed copies. It’s just a formality,” she answers and snaps her fingers. “Hop to it! Then get back here and behind the desk.” She clacks out of the office. She must have slipped on her high heeled shoes at some point.
Steve couldn’t recall but he’s fairly certain that the street in the movie hadn’t been closed off with a large brick wall and wrought iron fencing. Steve spots the motion detectors and the special sensors that would paralyze an intruder.
society and where that path leads, Sheriff. But I’d rather show you another path. I’d rather show you a little about the rules of Nature.”
“Good to know. You seem less worried about him though.”
Instead of the heat from the battle, Steve only felt the cold and ice of death. He trembled and for a second believed he might be back in the ice. Cho knelt next to him and he heard other voices, voices calling out. He must have blanked out for a moment. The next thing he knew Bruce and Tony hunched over him as a nurse wiped his face.
By the time the game ends and the group plans on another meeting tomorrow to discuss the final needs of the Conclave, Steve is exhausted from plastering a fake smile on his face anytime someone chanced to come up to him to chat. At the end, Tony slaps Stane on the arm and smiles. Steve stands right next to Tony as he says his goodbyes.
“JARVIS?” Tony hands the steaming mug to Clint and then sets up his own coffee. He’s being too nice today. Something must be wrong with him. “JARVIS?”
“Whatever,” Steve says and leans back on his console desk, folding his hands in front of him. “The point is Bucky, I can’t leave the conference since I’m the main negotiator for it. I’m kind of the ringleader.”
“I think it’s both.” He bops her on the nose. “Now I think it’s time for sleeps. Don’t you think it’s time for sleeps?”
Tony hoists himself up onto Steve’s back as the Hulk howls. Without delay Steve secures Tony to him, using his bent knees as anchors. Taking the grappling hook, he aims then throws. The hook catches and slides into place.
The words wash over him not like a tide but like a chilled breeze. He treads carefully. “I should, I mean, thank you. For what you did back there. The meeting really worked because of you.”
They timed it just right, like he would have done as a Captain of the V-Corps. The perimeter was at least a half mile off but he spotted helicopters – a fleet of them headed toward the safe house. Just as he turned to leave the room, Tony slammed open the door and then dropped to the floor to avoid the splash of sun light from the window. Steve struck the switch again and the windows grayed out.
(See the end of the chapter for
Disbelief, whole and encompassing, overwhelms him. “He’s done. How can he be done?” He expected Steven to fight, to struggle. “Didn’t he resist? Didn’t Steven resist?”
“I get it, okay,” he had said and then promised this would be the last time. “I need to clear my head. When I get back, we’ll take another look at that evidence about the weapons deals. I want to know how far and how deep Stane got.”
Jane leans back and grabs the portfolio. “Great. You made the deadline.”
Tony stays quiet for a moment and then clears his throat. “It was a mistake. Not to do it before.” His voice, his tone sounds stilted as if he’s having a hard time finding the words and the right emotion to go along with them. “I didn’t mean to alienate you.”
Once they finally get to the lounge, Steve relaxes, though Happy does not. He steps into the lounge first as if some Kree super agent is about to leap out at them to attack Steve. When they walk into the room, melodious piano music fills the room. Steve stops and gapes at Tony sitting at the piano, a tumbler of amber liquid on the piano as he plays.
"Can you clamp that down, while I clean this out?" Natasha says and Steve shifts to see the spurt of blood from the gaping wound. The doctor works to do as Natasha asks but Bucky holds onto consciousness making it difficult.
“He said he was from Earth,” Tony corrects.
That stings and Steve snaps his head up to look at Tony. “That’s not the same.”
Tony streaked down like a bullet out of the sky. Lightning crackled, and thunder rolled across the night as Thor flew past him. From the balustrade of the fortress gunfire blasted through the air.
“I loved Peggy. That was enough.” Steve says with a visible swallow as if it hurts. The muscle along the line of his jaw tenses.
Tony extricates himself from the lion’s grasp and starts a fire. Blu tears away the hindquarters again for him and then walks out of the circle of light from the fire to enjoy his meal. His tail swishes slightly as he eats but he keeps the bloody mess out of his sight. With some practiced skill, Tony manages to cut some meat off the deer and impale it on a stick. He cooks it over the fire and then eats. He’s found some berries around their site, but he has no idea if they are edible. He’ll be happy to eat some fruit and vegetables again. When he finishes, he grabs the HUD again and connects to the comm port. JARVIS is online in seconds.
“Just go!” Tony said as he stayed huddled under the shield and the reclined seat.
“I saw a report on the news, sir.” Steve folded his hands and waited. He wouldn’t offer up any information if he didn’t have to. He needed to assess. When he’d left Tony’s, he’d tried to get in touch with Fury but failed. He had no idea where the Director was.
“Steve?”
“Get out of my face,” Tony hissed. Rumlow nodded and left. Tony went back to Pepper, but listened all the same for the sound of the elevator to ensure that he followed orders. He did. After a little searching, Tony found an outdated rotary phone on a corner desk in the observation room. He picked up the handset and listened for a dial tone. On the center of the dial instructions stated to dial a 9 for an outside line. He did. It took a while to get through to Rhodey on an unfamiliar line, but he did.
Tony raises his hand and slips it along the side of Steve's jaw, cupping it and then searches his expression as if testing it. He must like what he sees because he says, "Yes, I think you do."
Steve accepted it. “Well, that’s something we have to keep in mind.” So many questions, so little resources. He would have to quiz Natasha the next time he saw her. She might be helpful now that he was essentially an outlaw. An identified mated human was considered a danger to other humans, as well as considered criminally insane. He frowned. This wasn’t at all how it was supposed to turn out – not the way he’d thought of it back in the day.
Tony grasps Steve hand again. “No, then how should I earn it, Captain?”
It seems like a million years ago now, but it had only been a few desperate weeks. A few weeks of the world descending into hell, a few weeks of pleading calls for them to do something about it, a few weeks of Secretary Ross promising them that there would be serious consequences to their actions. They have one shot to get this right.
“That doesn’t sound like a bad idea. Play away, JARVIS.”
Swallowing hard, Steve rasps, “Please touch me. Please, Tony. Please.”
“Is your bond broken?” Tony adds. Of course it is broken. The Lord of the Carbonelli clan has been dead all these many decades. Some sync bonds last even after death causing the warrior to fall into insanity with little hope for recovery. In those instances, it is better to put the warrior out of his or her misery. If this is the Lord’s Omega warrior, he might be better off dead.
“What I said, how I ignored you. How much I wanted you and I kept denying it.”
It will free them both. He’ll do it. For Tony, he’ll do it.
Tony bites the sandwich roll, chews, and then says, “It’s a beautiful day. Thank you, Steve, for making me see that.”
“Well, you won’t be flattered when they start following you around everywhere.”  Tony thanks Steve as he guides him to a stool at the counter island in the kitchen.
Steve shivers under his touch. “We don’t even know one another.”
“I’m going to have to shoot him,” Tony mutters as the laughter calms down.
“Long enough?”
“Not much to tell,” Steve says with a shrug.
“Because they found out the Blight didn’t just kill vampires,” Natasha said as the elevator arrived on the main floor of the house.
“That’s the armor. Or rather the place where the armor ejects from its storage in my long bones.”
Tony ran his hands through his hair and frowned. “Well somethings I suppose just aren’t second nature yet.”
Yinsen shakes his head. “On his mouth. He ate- something.”
“I don’t know why. You’ve seen me at my worst,” Steve says and stalks off to the bathroom. He slams the door behind him and then sits on the closed toilet. His hands tremble and his eyes burn. The tremors and the visual disturbances are as bad as they were when he first entered the Ultron’s mind. A coldness racks his body, and he shivers like he’s tormented with a fever.
“I handled it.” Steve sits on one of the cushioned chairs.
Bucky shrugged and finished his drink. He reached for Steve, who easily relinquished his hold – he never had a taste for the brew. “What you say we go find out if the Murray girls are free tonight?” He elbowed Steve in the side.
With a graceful motion, Steve’s on his knees on the floor. He cradles Tony’s face in his hands. “I watched you suffer for so many nights in that cave. I watched you persevere. I watch you and longed for you to see me. Me. Tell me you see me now.”
“I tried to call you,” Steve says, failing to mention that he called in his mind.
With a shrug Steve answered, “From what I understand recovery from that kind of trauma isn’t overnight. So, it will take a while. It’s a process.”
“After?” Tony asks.
The Adonis before him looks down at his collared Polo-rip-off shirt that’s probably two sizes too small for him, and then back up at Tony. He frowns and says, “Different?” He’s clutching a leather-bound portfolio that probably came from the thrift store down the block of wherever this Adonis lives. His khakis are nicely pressed, but the shirt is definitely a fake that he probably bought from a sidewalk vendor.
“The worse part was – that of all of it – it was the image of you dead at my feet, the pack gone, all the souls in tatters that broke-.” He stopped, stuttering into a sob. “Tha-that broke me. Broke everything.”
The opening is narrow and twists to the left, and Tony follows it. It closes in and, for a moment, the world funnels around him. JARVIS talks to him, guides him, brings him around from the hell of what was before and isn’t anymore.
Steve shakes his head, his hands trembling as he grips the sides of the sink. “I don’t know how? I’m a soldier, Tony. You know that. That’s who I am. I know the physical fight, not this. Not the mental one.”
“Nightmares?” Steve says.
As they recline against the pillow, Tony asks, “I thought formal training was required for the Guilds.”
“Lovely,” Clint said as he looked up at Steve.
“Well, there is that case of the young man-.” Jarvis stops and there’s an awkward pause in the room as Pepper clears her throat and then Jarvis fills in with quick words. “But let’s not linger on the past, shall we? I hope you will enjoy your luncheon. I’ve made a chopped Thai salad. I hope you enjoy it.”
Steve doesn’t loiter. He doesn’t have time, Clint’s right. The media circus is going to be a nightmare. They could have opted to not announce to the media that they were starting the clinical trials on the Pym nanotech, but Tony insisted. It was groundbreaking what they were trying to do. It could change the face of medical science. If they succeed, then Tony would not only get his sight back, but the world would have a potent new way to heal damaged brain tissue and nerves. It means a world of difference for people with spinal cord injuries, Parkinson’s disease, ALS, and more. This advancement isn’t just for Tony’s particular case but be relevant to a number of other neurological diseases.
“You are going to be the death of me!” Tony says and gestures to Steve. “Please lead the way to The Cage – and I hope I don’t get any ideas considering the name of the place.”
“Better,” Steve rasps. His ears ache and every now and again a spearing pain shoots through them, but it’s tolerable. “Better.”
“And if he didn’t?” Steve realizes he’s still grasping Tony’s wrist. He drops it.
“I have to prepare you,” Tony said and swallowed down his excitement. The idea of watching Steve, opening Steve up for him sent rivets of excitement through Tony. Gently, Tony angled Steve to get him onto his back.  He tugged down Steve’s pants. “You okay?”
“Yes.”
“You don’t seem freaked out about what they are saying,” Steve said and indicated the television.
“No, no,” he says.
“Tony.”
It’s Rhodes turn to whisper into Tony’s ear and he only smiles at his friend and then turns back to the microphone. “My mother wanted to share her love of art. This Foundation is her legacy. I want to share my fortunate life as well. I want to be able to know that no one will suffer from health or other issues because of lack of money and that’s why I am starting the Tony Stark Medical Foundation.”
Steve took in a breath, held it to calm himself, sent out the Mantra in a cooling wave, and then said, “Is Sam around?”
After a second, Natasha noticed him and placed a hand on his arm. “Buckle up, big boy. This is where the fun begins.”
Standing useless at Tony’s side, Steve attempt to assuage his fears again. “I can help out, I can do whatever you need me to do to make the bom-.”
It’s the prince who takes control then he thrusts up and growls as he does, his eyes wide and hungry. He pets Steve’s face and grips his arms, sliding a hand up his thin chest. For a second Steve’s embarrassed about his slim frame but when he looks down at the prince he only see wonder and want. It coils down deep in his groin and his hard cock leaks, dripping and pooling pre-come onto the prince’s belly.
“It’s the team. It’s Iron Man.” Her whole body slumped in defeat. She had to admit their nakedness, she had to admit their vulnerabilities. “You still talk about it in your sleep, you know. You still do it. JARVIS sometimes even answers you.”
“He has feelings for the guy,” Sam says. “Steve, you are hopeless.”
“Not so, while most of the Viz-nets carried it for a week and said it was over. It continued for a year. The Carbonelli family often ran humanitarian missions to the Purge and got caught up in the mess,” Penny says.
Tony jerks a nod and then asks, “Picnic. What kind of picnic did you bring?”
When he answers it sounds like a plea. “Yes.”
“Answer my question,” Tony demands. Steven doesn’t flinch, doesn’t shy away from Tony though he knows full well with the new Stark family collar he’s wearing that Tony could do damage to him easily enough. The collar itself is embedded with the latest punishment technology.
“Start seizing,” Tony says. He finally drops into a chair. “Fuck.”
He looks to find Tony resting on one of the chairs with its back to the bed.  He twists around to peer at Steve from the side of the chair. He’s in a new suit and his hair isn’t matted anymore. He’s obviously taken a shower and cleaned up. Jumping up he crosses the room and asks, “What’s going on? Are you okay?”
“But I’m not here to convince you to pick me. I’m here to convince you to pick yourself.” Logan massages his hands, grasping and ungrasping them as if the claw ache within him. His head bows. His gaze goes to the floor. “I’ve loved you kid, god since way before. Since that time during the War that we crossed paths and we went and liberated that camp of prisoners. You remember. You were so damned idealistic. I felt like a kid again, felt like anything was possible.” He rubs at his eyes but never looks up at Steve. “I loved you then. I left because of that- because I couldn’t stay with you. I couldn’t admit to myself how much head over heels I was.
Steve puts his hands up and says, “This isn’t exactly how we wanted to do this.”
Steve kissed his neck. “The vest malfunctioned and gave you a shock. You were out cold.”
Steve presses his lips into a thin line and frowns. “If you don’t mind, I’d like to pass. I watched the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan like a week ago and I’m still having nightmares.”
“Now, don’t do that,” Stark says.
“It’s okay. You’re being so good for me. Quiet now. I’m going to let go. Don’t come? Okay? You need to cool down before I start to prep you.” He watches to see if Tony understands him and once he gets a nod and Tony stiffens his jaw to hold himself back, Steve lets go.
“I haven’t, but I will check. Either I or Strange will be back to check on you-.”
Steve gathers what strength he has and answers, “Heat.” He licks his lips and starts again. “I went into heat, I had to go to -.”
“I don’t know what they told you, but I’m just human. Or enhanced like I always was with the super soldier serum. There’s nothing special about me.” He almost said he was just a kid from Brooklyn, but those days were centuries ago – or so it seemed – and he hadn’t been back to his life in years.
“That’s enough now,” Ross commanded as Steve went limp in the chains.
“Wait a minute,” Egg-shaped head doctor says. “You never said you were married.”
Tony wasn’t cheating. He told himself these things as he fucked his hand and images solidified in his mind. As he reached out and thought about those burnt and ashen stings of his soul needing connection. Inside, he didn’t lie to himself. He let his imagination shine and his frayed ends merged with the one he was looking for, the one that he wanted.
“Please.” He snaps his mouth shut. He’s not going to give in so early.
“It doesn’t matter,” Natasha said.  Her eyes and voice were as cold as the Russian winters. “To them, we’re all a moment’s notice from what they did to your friend.”
Tony contemplates his words and then says, “Do you really think I would want to have sex with you after someone violently assaulted you?”
“Hmm?” he says and likes the feel of it.
"You fixed old Betsy!" Mrs. Fury declares and hugs him tightly to her over abundant chest. He pats her back and then says
“Don’t be ridiculous, Tony,” Pepper says and she turns to him. “Thank you, Captain.”
“I’ve no problem with cold weather. It’s nasty out there.”
“I get that. I do. But you seem more comfortable with it.” Tony’s hip hit Steve’s and they stood like that hip to hip. The dream and it’s after effects still resonated.
Steve opens the doors.
Later that evening after a quiet dinner where he did his best to sharpen his façade, he brought her to bed and followed her lead. He kissed her and caressed her. She touched him and licked him. Yet, nothing worked. He found himself impotent and dead in her arms. When she whispered it was okay, that it happens to everyone, a crackled laugh spat out of his mouth. He wanted to quote one in five, but instead he left her in the bed, cold and alone. He found his way, tripping over his own clothes, to the bathroom locking the door behind him. He ignored the long mirrors by the double vanity. The cozy Tuscan-inspired tile and light fixtures. He went directly to the shower, turned on the double heads, and closed the glass door behind him as he stood in the water fall.
Without a second thought, Tony followed Strange’s unspoken command, his wordless explanation of that one chance in millions. He had the technology wrapped around him. He’d been meant to do this since the moment his own weapon exploded in his face all those years ago. Maybe it was pre-ordained even before that, when his father hired Stane. Stane was the one who eventually had Tony kidnapped and nearly killed. It set Tony on a journey to invent the Iron Man armor, to revise it, remodel it, reinvent it time and again. To finally working with nanotechnology and designing an armor that would always be with him, that could shape and reshape according to his needs at the moment. The armor would be the key, the armor with its nanites would steal away the stones and Tony would snap his fingers and change the universe.
“What?” he cries out and the vision fades. He’s no longer kneeling but standing in front of Heimdall, his face only inches away from the demigod’s. “You’re telling me the Red Skull, the Red Skull is the one responsible for all this. For Nat’s sacrifice, for the Soul Realm being polluted, for my captivity for 15 years?”
“No. I don’t think that would be wise.”
“Not anymore.”
Tony doesn’t look up at Steve, his focus on his ministrations. “What do you have against shopping?”
It takes a month, a box of scraps, and a lot of sleepiness nights for Tony to finally miniaturize the arc reactor enough so that it can be placed in his chest. The palladium is a poor choice as a central element to run the damned thing. He’ll need to figure out a better core later, if – no when – he gets out of the damned cave. He’s starting to wonder what the fucking sun feels like.
Steve wipes away his grimaces and his preconceived notions. He needs to do a job and maybe if he gets a big enough tip, he can spread a little bit to his friends back home. Peggy and her brother still work tirelessly with the abandoned children on the dusty planet. “Come.”
“This is not your job.”
Of course, Steve never smoked before Project Rebirth, but everyone else did. His doctor told him to try it – it would help his asthma, train his lungs, relax him. It did the opposite. Once he went through Project Rebirth, the world opened up and he accepted cigarettes as if they were candy bars. His lungs were beyond reproach, nicotine and tar could do nothing to sully them. As he sat there with Bucky, Steve inhales deeply and lets the smoke swirl around him.
“Be my guest,” Steve replies and stares at the empty door.
“It would be prudent to get ready. It is 9:45 am.”
“When you tried to help Clint, well, everything went a little psychedelic,” Bruce answered.
“As I will ever be.” Steve follows suit and unbuckles his belt and follows Tony toward the back of  the Quin Jet. The guards already situate themselves around Tony and Steve. It’s always a little alarming to him, but he’s slowly getting used to it.
Steve gave a half smile. “Don’t think so.” And then he nodded. “They wouldn’t let me see her because she’s a vampire and she’s the head of the European Coven. Her coven is considered criminals because she fights for equal rights and acceptance as full citizens for vampires.”
He tests the gunners and then switches on the targeting computer. He checks the controls for the activator and then tests the firing grip. Once he has his bearings, he locks in and starts to fire as Clint rockets the ship toward open space. The ship rolls and spins as Clint tries his best to avoid the continuing spray of laser bolts. It takes skill to fly like he does. It’s often been said he’s the best Corellian pilot since Han Solo, though their ship is below the Corellian class. The dizzying spin of the ship though makes it a little difficult to focus and to aim, but the targeting computer chirps and Bucky grips and fires. Hot pain shoots up his arm but he ignores it as he sees his aim is true. He whoops as Sam hits another one. A swarm still covers their tail and Clint races the ship toward open space and lightspeed.
“I’m not a perfectionist.” He sees the next hill. The world remains steady, not floating or rolling.
“I will be. I have a few more things to research about the prince.”
“Don’t do this, Steve. You’ll regret it.”
Now he has to drag his ass back down and find a source of water. It can’t be too far. In the distance he sees poppy fields and they need water. The farmers in the area must have a source of some kind. He gives himself a few minutes to rest. He hasn’t eaten all day. He doesn’t want to mention his hunger again, because he’s wary of Blu leaving. It’s getting to be late afternoon. He doesn’t want the lion away from him. It strikes him as odd how much this lion and his little stuff toy represent security to him.
The man narrows his eyes and then lays his head back against the glass, his neck exposed as if in sacrifice. Tony can see his gland near his collar bone as it bleeds a little.
Pepper smiles. “You gave it to me. Lord only knows why you would give someone deathly allergic to strawberries a blouse with embroidered berries on it.”
“Crap,” Tony mutters and sighs. “I guess my big revelation will have to wait. I gotta go to this.”
“That’s it?” Tony rubs at his face. He has a blanket fold impression on his cheek and his eyes look bleary. He scratches a hand through the mess of his hair.
“There’s too may fail safes and redundancies. We need to go to the source. No one on Earth will be able to delete this, the one way to remove it is to root it out.” Tony showed what looked like a complex building schematic. It half reminded Steve of the arc reactor. “Ultron’s been a busy boy. He’s built shields and mazes, and defenses to keep himself safe.”
“A spy? For the Kree? One of our own?” Obie says and, reaching down, clasps Steve’s shoulder, and heaves him to his feet. “You better have a good explanation for this.” Obie glowers at Steve, his bald head gleaming with sweat. “Get Prince Anthony immediately.”
“Tony, are you with me?” Steve says and cradles his face in his hands once he’s gotten his shirt and undershirt off. “Tony look at me, tell me you can hear me.”
“I saved Aria, and after I deposited her back with the Elders of Shield, I left in hopes I could right many wrongs against the Carbonelli family. I ended up in stasis, though I had tried to end it since I failed in my mission.” Steven’s voice is tight and controlled.
“Hey, I was listening to that.”
“That’s not-.” Steve stops. That’s not what he means, but then again, what does he mean? The simple fact – he doesn’t need assistance to get up, to stand, to walk out of the hospital? Or is it something else? Something deeper? His last heat and his reaction to it betrays his stalwart appearance. If Tony only knew. Steve clears his throat. “No. Thanks. I’ll be fine.”
According to Tony he’s already dead.
“Not really. My mom read it to me when I was sick. I was a very sick child.” Steve waits, bracing himself for Tony’s anger.
“There are heat signatures indicative of humans to the wide left, sir, but they seem to be moving away from the cave system.”
The words comfort and, while the tension remains, he settles enough that Banner can examine the wound without fear of being thrown off by a raging patient.
“I should be able to. I’ve seen them in real life and it’s not like it’s a difficult engineering problem. Just give me about thirty minutes to do the math and then-.”
Going down into the living room, he realizes someone is at the front door. It’s cold, and he folds his arms over his chest and peeks out through the blinds. Natasha.  The Quin Jet is setting in the middle of the newly cleared road.
“An item?”
She wipes the sweat from his brow and then brings the thick furs up and tucks them under his chin. “You’ll get chilled now the shock has passed.”
Steve points with his fork over at the dismantled coffee machine. “It’s broken. Maybe you can take a look.”
Until she refused to let T’Challa take him down. He had realized how she might be in danger. Bucky had asked about his friends, what would happen to them – but Steve had placed it on the back burner. He knew he would have to face it, and he did – he’d gotten his team out of the Raft with T’Challa’s help. After, though, that’s when he found out that Natasha was on the run. He reached out, much like she’s doing now. He brought her to safety in Wakanda with the rest of them. She’s not to be caged, but then again, neither is he.
“Going onto Schmidt’s range -which pretty much nearly encircles the town- is dangerous. He’s got his gang patrolling all the time. Getting close is near to impossible.” Steve stands up and sighs, feeling as if he’s losing part of himself with Bucky.
“Yes, sir.”
Tony feigns distress. “Me? Get sick of me? Never!” Steve reacts just the way he wants him to by laughing and leaning forward for a little kiss. It’s sweet and right and sets Tony afloat. He doesn’t know what he did to score someone so wonderful, but he’s never going to let him go.  “Now, eat your fries and then we can watch a movie or something.”
but doesn’t voice the name, because in the end Bucky’s right, always right. He can’t say Tony’s name, he can’t face what happened between them. He’s lived as a monk since they separated as if he’s waiting for Tony to waltz back into his life and sweep him into their dance again.
Steve chuckled. “Oh, you mean cheap and cold in the winter?”
The wind masks his calls to Shield and Tony sidles close to him as if he knows without speaking that the horse means the world to Steve. Steve’s grateful for the attention, and realizes that Tony is right – he does have more than just Bucky.
“Hey?” Tony says.
“Here?”
She points to the extra plate. “I’m assuming that’s not for me. Where is he?”
“You are seeking peace. Peace may be found in books for some but not for you. For you, it is  in places secret from all prying eyes.”
“You’re positively serene.”
He falls asleep in the arms of a lion he calls Blu.
“Good to have you back with the living, Bucky,” Steve says and hates the exhaustion taxing his friend. “We thought we lost you there for a while.” Turning to Bruce for only a second. “It’s a good sign.”
When Steve arrived at Vormir to return the soul stone, the specter had been simply a ghost of itself. It almost looked like wandering rags without a being. Steve had tried to talk to it, to reason with it, but there was nothing there – just an empty shell. Now Natasha brings Steve to the specter and the thing – it isn’t a phantom or a darkened hooded cloak. It is Steve’s nightmare.
“You need to get well, first.”
“Shit!” He jumps up and races to the bathroom to wash his face and get the last vestiges of the seizure off him; it always feels like a thin layer of slime clings to his body when he wakes. He scrubs his face, checks his hair, and then straightens his shoulders. He can do this – the vision is gone – it’s just a dream, a weird quirk, an after effect of being frozen for 70 years. He tells himself these lies, and he heads to the lobby.
Once he’s finished with the wood, he slips the armor over his hand. It’s his injured hand and the brace of it stabilizes it. He aims the repulsor and fires. A flame ignites and their small campfire is ablaze. As the fire warms their small area, the flames flicker over the lion. The beauty of his mane is only matched by those unnaturally blue eyes. He gazes at Tony, waiting, watching as if he wants to say something.
“I thought you just told me you are an open book.”
Steve watched as the agents entered the elevator. Most didn’t make eye contact with him. If they did, it was a short nod and a swift look away. They gripped shock batons. It wasn’t unusual for agents to have batons, but it was strange for them to have them unholstered, ready to go. Steve glimpsed one agent with  sweat dripping down his temples. Steve counted them as the elevator stopped on different floors. Each time the elevator stopped more agents packed into it. Some were members of the Strike team, but others were dressed in suits. They were analysts – or pretending to be analysts. The air in the lift grew thick. The elevator stopped again. Rollins entered followed by more agents. Ten. The elevator closed. The agents encircled him. He had no choice.
They all fall to silence.
“A large animal, sir?”
“Hey, what’s going on?”
“Yes, they are interconnected as you know. We won’t be able to save any of them.” Her eyes are stern but not unkind. “I’m sorry, Mister Stark. I’ll try my best to save his glans.”
The week isn’t easy. In fact, Steve likens it to battle. He barely gets through the first big test and that’s not even the meeting on Friday. It’s the assignment of his suite of rooms in the Tower. He has a suite – or rooms. The whole thing is bigger than his attic apartment. Way bigger. He’s overwhelmed at first and he stands at the door to the room in absolute silence. Jarvis talks to him about the lounge area, the small butler’s pantry and kitchenette as well as a bedroom with ensuite. Steve stays frozen at the door, gazing at the fireplace with its floor to ceiling stonework. He’s never had a fireplace in his entire life.
“Sir, it is reading very similar to a human, but not quite, and wounded. Gravely.”
“You can’t keep going to the Arctic looking for his body. It isn’t going to happen. The company suffers every time you go. The stockholders have a right to know what the CEO is doing-.”
“Everyone knows that, Buck,” Steve says and stands up. He heads over to the small table they have set up in the corner and when he gets there without falling over he counts it as an accomplishment.
“It is. But it’s because we maintain it to be safe.” Clint walks past Steve and waves for him to follow. “Over here is the main room, or as the Widow likes to call it the parlor. She’s weird like that. No clients are allowed. Just the whores or as we like to call it just the workers. That’s your room to relax, hang out.”
“Honesty? You demand honesty from me. That’s rich, that’s really rich from you.” Tony hisses. “Fuck, I promised I wouldn’t go there. I promised myself this would be a new beginning for us. I want it to be. I really want it to be.”
“At least Steven has a head on his shoulders,” Pep says and then Tony notices Steven glance at her. It’s furtive and then he drops his glance to his plate, blinking his eyes several times. It knocks Tony’s hopes down a peg or two. Clearly his omega thinks that Tony only uses him.
“Yeah a lot of soldiers from the war did,” Stark says and something hidden crosses over him. He holds it tight to his chest like his ribs are fractured and it’s hard to breathe.
Tony clambers to his feet again, dusting away the imaginary dirt. “What the hell? Do you need me to call the police?”
“It’s something I can do. Well, I’d like to do with you, especially. If you’re working on something like one of your inventions or something. I’d tuck myself under your desk or workbench and have your cock in my mouth. As long as you want. You can fuck my mouth over and over. Or just lazily get off. Would you like that?” Steve licks his lips as Tony’s cock drips a mixture of semen and water.
“Sure, you are,” Tony says and jostles him on the shoulder. “You might have a nearly imperceptible bump now from a certain angle, but otherwise I think it’s a pretty good job.” He assesses Steve for a few more minutes, his hands probing Steve’s face, touching his jaw line. Steve can almost imagine something else.
“This isn’t physics. Look beyond,” Strange replied but then he stared at Steve’s wrist as if it was one of the crown jewels of England.  He grabbed Steve’s hand – his fingers hot like orange flames. “So very intricate. I’ve never seen the brand so very intricate.”
“Nat scares everyone,” Clint says from the doorway. He’s got his arms folded and a pissed off look plastered to his face. He’s angry at Steve for dispatching him to take care of a minor issue with the ranchers outside of town, while he went covertly to tackle the Schmidt problem. “By the way, Nat might want to get back to the saloon, Thor and that chucklehead of a brother of his are causing a ruckus.”
As they left the elevator and walked into the shabby cottage, Steve scanned the sky for any sign of Iron Man through the holes in the roof. Clint jogged out of the ruin down house and Natasha stopped Steve with her outstretched arm.
“Time to pay your dues, Stark,” Rumlow said.
The prince accepts Steve’s explanation but asks, “How many patches do you wear?”
“We have to pull our shit together and save him. I don’t care if you don’t know him. He risked his life to pull the two of you out of a situation you got your asses into in the first place,” Sam directed to the twins. “And he went out on a limb to rescue you because that’s who he is.” He pointed at Bucky this time who only raised his one hand in surrender. “We’re doing this. We can. Far as I know, Steve and Bruce pulled Clint from the edge of nowhere once. We can do this for Steve – this time.”
“I don’t know how, I don’t know what you want me to do,” Steve replies and rubs Tony’s chest, hoping to God he doesn’t have to do what Tony is inferring. What is he inferring? How the hell would he ever be able to do this?”
“Yes, I think we do.”
“Oh I bet he hated that,” Tony guesses.
“Is that a good thing or a bad thing.” Tony eases away, worried he’s torturing Steve instead of giving him pleasure.
“Okay, truth only. What do you think about Strange’s proposal?” Tony says and then crunches into the cookie. It melts in his mouth, the taste of butter sweet and creamy.
“What if I told you, I had nanites that would solve that problem completely?” The side of Tony’s mouth crooks in a wicked smile.
“You don’t get to do that,” Tony stopped him. “Seriously, think about it.”
a blacksmith?”
He relents – because he has no other choice. “I am submissive to you.”
“Vultures are especially bold,” she’d said. It scared the daylights out of Tony.
The message read:
“I thought you said you weren’t that kind of doctor,” Tony remarks.
Steve snickers and grabs at his shoulder at the same time. “Young’uns? Bucky, we’re from New York City, we don’t say young’uns.”
“I don’t think so,” Yinsen says. “He has a good heart.”
“Just around the corner. You two done taking a dip?”
The door swings open and Steve frowns at him.
Tony kept talking as he caressed Steve’s perfect skin. “There’s going to be a time when I – or you – may need to fall into our roles, our natural biological roles. If I discipline you, or you submit to me during a briefing and the team doesn’t know – what will they think?” Tony noticed the smallest twitch of a muscle. He stopped and stared at Steve. Steve bit his lip and froze. He’d been instructed not to move, not a muscle. He could breathe and blink, but nothing more as he lay on the bed naked. Tony didn’t tie him or bind him in any way. He simply had him lie down and remain motionless. It was harder that way without bondage to take the Submissive’s mind off the task at hand. He couldn’t fall into subspace. He needed to stay attentive because at any moment, Tony might touch him intimately and then what might happen then? How would Steve follow orders then?
His bike was damaged, and he had little choice. He would have to make a break for it. Swim the Potomac and hope he got away. But then another sound alerted him of an incoming danger. An engine – rotors –of a helicopter. He looked up to the sky. Hovering over the bridge with the rope ladder dangling was a Stark helicopter. He spotted his second in command at the V-Corps, Clint, piloting and awaiting him at the controls. Steve latched onto the rope ladder and the helicopter took off into the sky.  Only seconds later, another fighter zeroed in on them and Steve started the frantic ascent to get out of harm’s way as bullets targeted him. As he made it into the helicopter cockpit, a stray bullet hit his boot. He hissed at the pain but rolled into the copter. Clint angled the controls zipping up and around the more cumbersome jet. He flew directly toward DC, not to the more open space of Virginia. Steve pulled up the rope and got into the co-pilot seat, ripping off his helmet and putting on the headset.
“What’s the difference?” Tony asks. He’s walking close to Steve as if separating now would cause him pain.
Tony steps into the room. The view is outstanding. There’s a small lake, pond really, in the front that’s crystalline and icy in the drifting snow. “It’s beautiful,” he murmurs.
“So that’s the way it is, huh?” Tony says with a snicker.
“It is,” Tony says. The man in the cell remains frozen as he observes them. “This isn’t about fairy tales or even revolutions. This is about history. Sometimes, the way forward isn’t the path we want to take but something that presents itself.”
“Before we set off for that, just let me tell you – at my brothel you make 70% of your take. That’s better than all the brothels at this station. You keep any tips. That means that if the client choses to leave some credits on your side table afterwards – that’s the tip. All clients pay before they enter the brothel. So don’t screw it up. I hate it when they want a refund. Causes all kinds of paperwork.”
That doesn’t compute. “You had yours. You had enough to get back. He should have had enough.”
If Steve wanted to be truthful with himself (and he routinely went that path), the whole soul pack thing left a bad taste in his mouth. It wasn’t that he didn’t like Bruce; he happened to think that man had been given a pretty horrible fate which in some ways Steve internalized and blamed on himself. The idea that the serum could be properly repeated, the whole experiment from top to bottom, was predicated on the idea that the serum worked the same in all people. While Steve hated to admit the reason the serum worked the way it did in him happened to be because of who he tried to be, in the end after reading all the failed attempts, he had to agree with Erskine.
“You will get hungry. We are using calories. I’m most worried about you. It’s not like intravenous feeding will keep you alive and healthy.” Tony selects a packet of dried fruit and a chocolate bar. The wind picks at that moment to howls and shake the crashed jet.
Natasha only shakes her head as she says, "He keeps refusing."
“And I trust-.” Steve stops. His own nature worked against him in his Realm. “Tell me, tell me everything.”
That’s it. He’s completely blown it. “What the hell?” Pepper glowers at him and then turns to Rhodes. “Perhaps you can get rid of him. I’m not going to talk to someone who says ‘my heart is in the right place’ and I treat Tony like a child. Get him out of here.” She marches off, her heels clicking on the hard wood floors.
He releases a pent up breath and tries not to listen in on Tony as he talks in the bedroom of the quarters assigned to Steve. He cannot remember exactly how they ended up in Steve’s quarters rather than Tony’s last night, but they fumbled their way to the ship along with the very patient guards and a very anxious Happy in tow.  Steve recalls Tony trudging toward his quarters as if he marched to the guillotine. He smiles, remembering because that’s when he took Tony by the collar and yanked him toward his assigned rooms. The prince followed him willingly and the peace that came over his face as Steve slowly undressed him and put him to bed may be the best image he’s ever laid eyes on.
He glances up from his work and spots Blu, slowly lapping at his paws. If Tony gets out of here, they all do – including the damned lion.
“Because it allows the Omega to dedicate his or her life completely to the alpha. Don’t you think we do that already? Don’t you think our minds and bodies compel us to do that already? Did you have to take everything away from us?” Steven says and there’s hurt in his eyes.
“He was.” Steve found tears streaming freely down his own face. “I can’t even begin to imagine what horror he had to have gone through to do something as hideous as what he did to your mother.”
“You have to let me drive,” Steve said as Tony opened the driver side car door. “It’s dawn. Get in the back and cover up.” He handed Tony the shield and they both got into the sedan. Tony offered him the keys.
“Do you want that? Do you want it?” Tony asks and there is an eagerness in his eyes that is almost child-like in its quality.
It took a moment for Steven to follow direction but he did, first thinking that he was to get into a presentation position, tearing off his trousers. “No, knees but face me.” On his knees, Steven did as told. His lips were bright red and his mouth a divine sin. “Open.” Again, he did as told and Tony swooned at the power. To have someone be his and follow direction so obediently. He shivered as he took his own cock in hand, working at the swell of his knot. There was enough pre-come dripping from the head of his cock to wet him. He half-lidded his eyes and stroked himself brutally hard. “I want to know if I can whip you, if I can put you on the cross and hang you there. I want to know if you would like me to fist you while I hang you on the cross. I want to know if you would like to be trussed up for days, spider gag in mouth and dildo working your ass. I would come in and fuck your mouth anytime I want and leave you hungry for more. I want to know if you would be clamped in a chastity belt or sounded until you cried. I want to know how far you’ll go for me.”
The kind woman that spoke to him is clearly a demon – her pupils are red with the curse. After she finishes speaking into the shadows, she goes behind the Silver Knight’s cot and he hears the clanking of a kettle and metal utensils. Soon she is back at his side with a steaming cup in her hands.
The leader waves his weapon at Tony while comforting the boy by stroking his hair from his face. “You come to save the lion?” He speaks English.
Sharon escorts him to the back living room as she explains, "Her daughter wants to move her back to London. She doesn't want to go, but there's not much I can do to stop it. Considering my work schedule, I can’t really stop it any longer."
“The bitterness goes away. Don’t worry about it. It’s just your senses coming back as you accept the reality of the situation.”
Steve took the bottle with shaky hands, but Tony decided against letting him have it. Instead, he brought the bottle to Steve’s lips. “Drink.” After he’d managed to get down about half of the bottle, Tony asked him to lift his chin. He bent down to examine each wound and then licked them, specifically allowing the coagulant to cover each injury.
“This is right? Tony, I guessed, right? Yes?” Steve looks up and sees that Tony passed out. He’s both grateful and worried. At least Tony’s spared the throbbing pain from his chest, but then it leaves Steve burdened with doubts.
Steve had no idea what Tony was talking about so he stayed silent. “She – the girl what did Hill say her name was again?”
“By the way, how long am I stuck here?” Tony asks. He’s feeling more and more like himself; the seizure is a distant memory.
“If you go by my biology, I’m gonna be twenty-seven,” Steve said. “Seems to me all the kids these days figure this stuff out in their teens.”
Silence falls between them, a deep and wholly unnatural thing. After a moment, Tony waves to dismiss Steven. “Go rest. I will see you in the morning.”
“Sure, if you’re making some?”
“Good morning, Captain Rogers. It’s nice to meet you.”
“Then I’m glad I can be here and provide that for you,” Steve says, and he hates the sound of it. It’s cold and an official line of the brothel’s. He opts to try something else, indicating the holographic image of the mansion. “You consider this particular residence as your home?”
Ripping the headphones off as well as the earbud he tosses them aside and then gets his aching butt out of the chair. He climbs up the ladder, only wincing once. Sam waits for him. “You need to get that checked, you want me to clean it up?”
He spoke the next words out loud as if he’d only said them yesterday. “There's not enough time. This thing's moving too fast and it's heading for New York. I gotta put her in the water.”
Tony only growls in reply and crosses with two steps to the other apartment on the floor. He knocks and waits. He knocks again and waits. “Shit,” he says when he realizes maybe only the deaf guy is home. He gets to his knees and tries to peer under the door. It doesn’t work.
“Shit. Fuck. I didn’t realize. Are you okay, Cap?”
“You really are paranoid,” Clint said but took his own phone out, did the same and dumped it in the garbage can as they walked down the street. The rain had lightened but it still was wet and cold.
“Please,” Steve whispers into Tony’s ear. “Please fuck me.”
All along, Clint screamed. “What the fuck? What the hell did you do? What? Blood? Fucking blood? He’s a human being, you god damned bastards.” Through his tears, Steve witnessed as Clint shoved the silver bottle in the face of Pierce. “Give him something. Give him some damned water!”
“Remember what?”
“What?” As his grogginess dissipated, and his aches and pains grew. “Tony?” It took seconds for the memories to click into place. “Is he all right?” He remembered an elevator; he recalled flames and Tony – high in the air. The top of the Triskelion alit as if it were the wick of a candle, burning in the dark night.
He dreams of Tony.
“I’ll boil some more water for more pasta,” he said. He filled the largest pot with water and started the stove top again.
Dropping down onto the bed, Tony stares up at the ceiling. He can’t make out the details, but he hears the conversation he’d had with Steve only a few days before this horrible day.
“I need, I need to move,” Steve sobbed as Tony’s body enveloped him.
“But can you love him through this?”
Steve gagged as he finished the bottle and Clint staggered away. “It’s done.” Clint handed the empty bottle to one of the other agents in the room. He rubbed at his eyes and stared at Steve. “I’m done. I want my family. I’m done.”
“It means you sent us on a trip through Oz, old man,” Tony said. “Does that work for you?”
Prince Anthony Stark is known as brilliant, arrogant, generous, and brutal. He will fight to his last breath to defend all he loves. He is called the Hero of the Conclave. Most of the power within the Conclave originates from him. Most of the other kingdoms bow to him.
Steve pulls away and Tony’s cock feels abused and hot, needy, and too thick. He wants to curl to his side and jerk off right now, but Steve stops him. Opens his legs again and then the head of his cock nudges at Tony. He quavers.
Tony chuckles. “Don’t worry about it. I can find stuff on my own, you know. It’s just a little messier sometimes.” He touches the tray. “But could you move it away. Maybe onto the side table or something?”
“No. Not at all.” Steve weighs what he can and should tell her. “Tony’s-.”
“That’s not good,” Wong said. Strange gave him a scowl and he backtracked. “Well, it’s not great. It could be good.”
Steve captures Tony’s hand, opens it, and kisses the palm. “Mysterious, remember?”
Once Tony is halfway up the rise, Steve gathers the cable that Tony let loose from his gauntlet and begins. He has a rope in his backpack, but urgency stops him from digging it out. He watches Tony’s footing, confirming his stable ascent.  He doesn’t want to disturb Tony’s progress, so he waits every few feet. The storm makes it impossible for them to speak for which Steve is thankful. Right now, he doesn’t want to hear the impossibility of their mission from Tony. Sometimes Tony knows too much.
Jarvis glowers at him but passes the creamer over to him. “Of course.” He doesn’t serve Steve. Which is okay with him, he just wants the man not to look at him with such livid hostility.
Steve glanced at Natasha, who still whispered the mantra in a sing song loving fashion, and then he focused on Wong.
“Blu?”
He picked up a handful of the papers, the dossier on Barnes. Everyone knew. Natasha, Sam, Steve. Everyone knew that Tony’s parents had been murdered. And somehow Steve expected Tony to accept the murderer into the pack. To call him Brother. To share the feelings of warmth, security, and family that radiated off of Steve when he thought of Barnes. It sickened Tony.
“Tell me I’m not walking into a fire breathing dragon’s lair, here, J man.”
“I really don’t know why you don’t trust me Thaddy. Me and you, we’re compadres.”
Steve halts his snow angel and gazes silently up into the cloudless sky as if he is communing with it. Abruptly then he moves, almost too quickly for Tony to track his movements. He bends over Tony and his flush cheeks and wild eyes take up his line of sight.
“It’s not an infection,” Steve says and he can barely keep his eyes open. He needs to, though, he has to explain to Tony. “Need to get to the water.”
“It is hard not to know.”
“Well, that’s nice, at least someone thinks I’m not insane.”
“In town to visit.”
“What the fuck?” Rumlow stayed silent and that spoke volumes to Tony. Instead of turning to the guards for assistance Tony went to Happy. “I want that man out of there. I want that mask off of him as soon as possible. I want him clothed and properly fed.”
“Five.”
Steve found himself staring at the door and then he shuffled over to the window again. Sinking down onto the floor crosslegged, he focused on the lush green vegetation, the denseness of the jungle and the sprawling city beyond it. He sat. He stared. But all he saw was the inside of a dark cell. All he felt were their hands on him.
“Could take us more than a day?”
He doesn’t recognize the number. He considers ignoring it, but not a lot of people have his phone number so it’s probably someone important on an unrecognizable phone. He picks up. “Yeah?”
“What? Obie what?”
“You look absolutely delicious. My colors suit you. It’s almost like you’re one of my own.”
“I’ve never heard of shield. What shield?” Steve replies as Tony leads him to the front: the cockpit.
“Don’t suppose you’re going to want one?” Tony says as Steve pours the brandy.
“Just like that?”
Blu goes to the side of the stream and picks something up in his mouth and then chucks it at Tony. When it hits the water, he jumps away from it.
That’s when Steven shifts his eyes and his stare penetrates Tony – and for long moments he feels as if he’s the one who is naked. “It all means something to me, my lord. All of it.”
“Doesn’t seem like it,” Tony muttered and leaned onto the rail, hands clasped as he observed the wonders of the night.
“That’s what sighted people say when they don’t have anything else to offer,” Tony responds and then adds, “Do you know where Steve is? My personal assistant? Pepper said he left.”
Natasha whips around and pushes the barrel of the gun against Steve’s temple. A flash of concern – what would happen if she blew his head off? Would he survive? He’s in a dream like state. No one really knows if you die when you die in a dream.
A shocked moan cries out and Steve hurries to get them up the side of the ridge faster.  He propels and hand over hand brings them another few feet. They’ve crossed at least half the distance when a jolt to the rope bashes them against the face of the cliff. The breath goes out of Steve, but he clings to the rope.
The bird caws and then arcs around and flies into the pipe just as a new round of laser blasts hit. Bucky throws himself into the pipe head first and tries to slow down his descent so he doesn’t hit face first into the filth below. The ride down isn’t terrible, but the rumble of the building as it fights against the crumbling pillars threatens. He taps his ear bud as he slides downward.
“Oh not mine, not yet. There are others out there. Looking to replace your mighty steed.”
Steve clenches his teeth and with one last colossal heave makes the rise of the hill. The stones and mud slosh beneath them, but they succeeded. Steve turns his attention to the landscape beyond the entrance and gasps.
“Tony, get yourself together. I need you-.” The wind abruptly picks up, so hard and fierce it knocks them into the jagged wall. Steve’s hands hit the sharp rocks and he cringes.
Tony released a breath he hadn’t know he was holding, and Natasha freed his hand as she inhaled and exhaled over and over. Clint was the only one of their trio who managed to formulate words to respond, “Do you think Tony could see him?”
Steve smiles and it feels like all the world’s heaven to Tony, to see him shining and beautiful but so wounded and broken. “Don’t waste your life, Tony. Don’t waste it.”
“You won’t get one from me,” Natasha said. “But I will defend the pack.”
“And we are more careful with how we handle them,” Natasha said. “Listen, Tony, I don’t want you to be hurt. And I surely don’t want the coven to be harmed because he finds he needs to side with his own kind. It happens all the time. New vampires are always blindsided.”
The use of his name again startles him. “Who do you miss?” The memory of Steven murmuring in his sleep comes back to Tony. “Who do you cry for? I know you do. I’ve heard you.”  The love must haunt him.
A crack of red lightning splits the black around them, highlighting the Red Skull’s pitted eyes. It is almost time; the bindings dig into his flesh, tearing it from bone and muscle. He only has this one chance to save them all – even if it doesn’t save him.
It takes a moment but Steve finally raises his head. “What would Ma think of me?”
Coulson shrugs his shoulders at Tony and Steve only says, “Not lately.”
“Father?”
Like his father.
“So, you need to untangle the alternate Steve?” Richards says.
“Happy little trees, that’s what’s going on,” Tony says.
“Yeah, great.” There’s not a workshop in sight. The team specifically picked this place out so that they could just hang together, binge watch series, play boardgames, cook together. That kind of kumbaya thing. Tony didn’t want to come in the first place, but he’d broken up with Pepper some time ago, and there’s nothing for it. He’s here.
He bows his head not because he wants to deny Bucky, but because he needs to rebuff his offer. Sighing, he says, “I can’t, you know I can’t.”
“Just to help out figure out what’s going on, why it’s building the way it is,” Steve said and clasped his hands together. He tried to look non-threatening. “Please.”
Heading toward his library, Tony tries to forget the worst of what happened and focus on the good. He should be preparing for the evening meal and the meetings to come. He needs to be on his best game, but he’s irked and he needs something to mellow his brain. Going to the workshop is his best option. He tugs off his formal jacket, hangs it on the back of a chair, and slides a stool over to the bench. He picks up some of the latest designs of the arc oscillator and studies it, but he’s failing miserably. He only wants to think about his omega.
“Same day? How the hell long have we been in here?”
Tony reaches out as Steven steps away from the bed, catching his arm. “Why did you come?”
He gave her a weak smile. “Yes, of course.” He still couldn’t figure it out.
“Nat said the same thing,” Steve said with a half-smile that didn’t touch his eyes. “But the truth is we can never really get rid of irrational guilt, can we?”
She swallows. “I don’t think I could do your job.”
“Why Rhodey, that’s positively unenlightened of you. Mentally ill patients are usually not violent at all.” Tony grasps Steve’s arm. “And my hubby here is far from mentally ill. Let’s just call Blu the kind of guy that’s the silent but strong type. Like a lion.”
Steve grabs hold of Tony’s gesticulating arms and stills him. “There’s no need. If you reveal you know this, I’m sure he’ll tell everyone you brought a whore to the luncheon -.”
Tony inwardly admits it would be anyone’s fantasy to get their hands on that back, that chest, that ass, but he swallows down the eagerness. “Well, these are words you need to learn. Come.” He slings an arm over Steve’s shoulder and steers him toward the lower level.
“He must surveil us; he has to. We’re in his fucking game.”
Clint twisted the controls, his biceps working to keep the helicopter under control. “Nat doesn’t need to drink. Well, not like Tony anyway. It’s been a while. She’s older so she can fast for longer.” Part of what he said sounded rote as if he’d practiced it too often.
The elevator ride took forever, and Tony almost dozed as the pain sent him into a blurry reality, filled with fog and agony. When the elevator rang the floor and they hauled him out by his arms, the touch of dawn in the sky pierced his vision like a laser. His mind refused to piece together exactly what was happening. The roof, the sun breaking through the early clouds, the fact that the agents were towing him across the roof of the Triskelion. It made no sense to his infected brain.
“Okay, see you in a half hour or so.”
Sam stops, his smile drops, and he lowers his gaze to the floor. It takes a moment for him to regroup. “Sorry, man. Just trying to make you feel better. Cho said you’ve been through a lot.”
but he nods. It occurs to him, earlier in their encounter Tony called Steve’s mother by her name – Sarah – and Steve never denied it – never said it was her name or not. Steve the hooker’s mother’s name is Sarah. Just like Steve Rogers. Steve the hooker’s mother died when he was young, just eighteen. Steve the hooker’s mother died of an infectious disease – or TB – just like Steve Rogers.
He distinctly hears the words. “Happy little trees.”
“Well, I think you know that your son’s not dead,” Tony states. “So if your son’s not dead who is to say that Captain America is dead?”
Steve only laughed. They traipsed back through the corn, the armor following in the air. Clint grumbled how they had no respect for the land and the work a farmer put in, but seemed to reflect back their happiness.
In response, Steven squeezes his eyes closed and shivers. He doesn’t answer. Tony leans down, and lightly kisses his forehead. Through the last week he hasn’t allowed his omega to come at all. The pain may be unbearable, but the statement of control is obvious. Tony slips off the bench and bends down to unclasp the cockring. When he does a low rumble comes from Steven and Tony commands, “Thrust level 5, swell to 6.”
It isn’t that Steve wants Tony to depend on him – nothing is farther from the truth. He wants Tony to succeed. The progress he’s made on all his inventions and projects has been nothing short of brilliant and awe inspiring. In the short time they’ve been on the island, Tony will be able to bring back several new innovations for his company that may very well change the course of the world from smart streets to real clean energy. His one stumble has been the implant and its software upgrade to stop the headaches. Steve half blames himself. During Tony’s search for an assistant one of the requirements had been knowledge of biomedicine and, while Steve’s a quick study, he is by no means an expert. If he had more background information on the physiology of the brain, he might be able to help Tony. Right now, all he is – is a monkey to type out the code and read it. Well, a little more than a monkey. A tired exhausted little more than a monkey getting frustrated kind of person that isn’t what Tony needs.
“About a quarter of the size of Prime. Which means it’s huge since Prime is the biggest station out there.” Tony maneuvers the shuttle along the side of Prime and then lower to the base of the station. “Biggest one out there and thus a target for every Kree ship there is. They always try and breakthrough by striking at the Avengers. They never will, not with me aboard.”
Somethings he will go the distance for, even if it means losing himself. He’d done it before, in the past, before he’d been frozen in purgatory, he will do it again. As Tony shows him, touches him, kisses him, Steve follows and braces as he feels the waves coming upon him. It isn’t the waves of the physical ocean, but the ebb and flow of the rapture. He seeks as Tony gives and he forgets to shy away from things that are dangerous, things he should not experience.
Carefully, Tony moves at the same time Steve reaches upward and then they meet with an urgency and desire neither voiced, but both understood. At first the kiss is tentative, a testing of the waters. It grows then as a slight moan slips out of Tony and that encourages Steve. He wraps his arms around Tony, shifting him fully onto his lap. All the while they never stop touching, never stop kissing. The heat roils and coils deep in Tony’s groin and just small movement sends another cry out of him. Steve answers him with a moan of his own. Emboldened, Tony reaches down and tugs Steve’s shirt so that he can run his fingers against hot skin.
“Let’s get something warm in you.” Tony steers him away from the beauty of the waterfall, toward a small stone bridge. They climb it, but Steve never really sees it. His vision blurs from the pain and tears. Tony gestures to one of the vendors set up in the park and the man hurries to the prince’s side. Steve forgets to listen in, his mind still circling the loss of Bucky.
“You’re sure this is legal?” Steve asks.
Steve adjusts his manner and says, “So no sucking up to you? Just a regular fella, huh?”
“A newspaper,” Clint said with a smile. “You’re cute.”
He sidles to the door with a hand on the wall to brace against in case the room loops and swoops. Before he exits the room he closes his eyes and clears his head one more time. Leaving, he finds Bucky waiting in the dark hallway.
Steve never thought about it. That wasn’t true. He did worry about what would happen to Tony once he died. How would Tony fare if Steve wasn’t there. It was rumored that some vampires once they lost their mate reverted to a more primitive state, where they hunted humans. He knew for a fact that Tony hated animal’s blood, though he’d tried to keep it a secret from Steve. When Steve discovered Tony’s little secret, he’d taken time off of work and spent a good two weeks with him. Over the two weeks, Steve learned Tony’s patterns, especially his eating patterns – when he absolutely needed blood. As a decade’s old vampire, Tony was young – much younger than the rest of his coven. They often shared their blood with him if they’d just spent time with their mate. It helped him get through days when Steve wasn’t around, but Steve learned the more he was around – the more Tony hungered for him. During the time he was on leave, Tony nearly drained Steve. It took him weeks to feel like himself again – he hadn’t confessed how hard it had been to Tony. Thor had chided him for his actions and made him promise to be more reasonable. He was. He also learned a curious thing about the serum – the more Tony took, the faster the serum worked to replenish his blood. The serum wasn’t a miracle worker but it rejuvenated Steve.
Chances mean time.
Tony smiles with a slight upturn of his lips. "Well, if that's the way you want to play it, Captain. What would you like to know?" He waves Jarvis over to serve them and Steve sits out of the way as the dishes are revealed, including steaming potatoes, corn, large cuts of beef, and ham, fresh fruits and dried ones as well. The wine is poured and rolls are buttered. "Thank you, Jarvis." He peers up at Steve. "Captain, eat and question, I'm ready."
The store clerk stammers for a reply. “Hmm, thank- you-.” As the whole of the prince’s entourage start to leave the store, the clerk finds his voice. “Prince Anthony, surely you’d like to spend some time in the store? Perhaps buying something for your lovely assistant?”
Steve doesn’t look at Tony as he places the k-cup in the machine. “We’re working on a project together. He’s part of the Avengers, though he’s only part time.”
"Oh you know all about him already, dear." She looks away. Her hand quakes as she goes to close the laptop. "Everything that's fit to print."
“Less than an hour. Just relax.” He started the vehicle and peeled away from the station. In butt fuck no where they rarely saw vampires. He wasn’t surprised at the reaction. Instead of dwelling on it, Tony called Pepper. It was far too early, he knew that, but he also knew she would answer. It took five rings but she groggily answered the phone.
There’s a small movement, and Tony supposes Steve shrugs. “I was worried about not knowing enough about statistics and biochemistry.”
“Are you hurt?”
“So, when you go out after Clint, I want to ride by your side,” Tony says.
“Yeah you got a real deal,” Tony says to which Steve only frowns.  Steve leaves then, just mopes back to his one room while Tony waits for the supplies.
The lion watches them with quiet hungry eyes.
Below him Steve undulates to the feel of Tony’s fingers pressing into him. The sensual way he moves his body winds tight in Tony’s groin and he groans a little in response. Finally, he gets through to him. “Huh?”
“Take Wanda with you. She’s entertained the prince before. She knows what he likes.” She transfers credits to his account. “And Steve, do a good job and this could change your life.”
“So, he might be more apt to listen in.”
“Accords,” the Captain says with a smirk on his face. They’ve been down that road before and no thank you. “What movies?”
Just what they would encounter in the old labs in the middle of the continental divide puzzled Tony. He had quizzed Pepper because he trusted her implicitly with every aspect of his life. He’d even tried to beg off going on this adventure, but she’d convinced him. She’d told him that they needed him, his expertise and critical eye. No one ever told him he had a critical eye before, so she swayed him with that argument. Tony knew his tendencies for adoration might be a little out of control. He gave into her too easily and he needed to keep that in check. Mooning after a woman in love with another man did no one any good. He assuaged his hurt heart by going out with several different prospects. None of which stuck. Hammer pursued him but that was just nausea inducing. The last few months Tony lived like a monk and in some respects like a hermit and he perfected the arc reactor, replacing the palladium core before it went toxic to him with a new element he’d discovered. All was well with Stark Industries.
“Dude, Captain America needs my help. There’s no better reason to get back in,” Sam stated. The confidence, the trust, filled Steve with humility. He shouldn’t agree, but he did.
“I don’t know. I’m concerned.” The dark abyss lurked.
He stares at it for a number of minutes, unmoved and frozen as he watches the winking lights of the projection flicker about him. He recalls a time he stood on the greatest Way Station of them all, the Chromes Domes. The suite of rooms on the upper branches of the domes, a place he thought he would never see, he shared with Tony Stark – Courtesan of the Guild. Desired, mysterious, handsome. It all went to hell then, shortly after he and Tony were thrown into a war and they turned over the Human Space, revolted against the insidious Ultron and his legion of drones.
Tony noticed Thor – a vampire eons old – standing quietly by the door. He never said a word. Tony shook his head. “We don’t know how long he’ll live. It could be longer than you think. Much longer considering the serum.”
“Darcy’s cooked up a nice lunch at the Parlor, you coming?” Clint asks.
“Don’t try and break the chains. All you’ll do is hurt yourself and they want you to do that.” Clint stayed in the shadows as if Steve wouldn’t be able to recognize his voice. “The metal is adamantium. Strongest stuff around. Stronger than even Captain America.”
“Yes sir.”
“Am I?” Steve says and arches a brow at her. During the times Steve had with the General he did talk in his sleep but mainly about troop movements and occasionally about something called the Hulk.
Shaking his head, Tony snarls at him, “You don’t know me at all. I’ve told you that before.” With a look to his Master of the Fleet, Tony says, “Do it.”
“Are you okay?”
As Clint rests against her leg she mutters, “He doesn’t like to take. Makes him groggy. Won’t take and now look at him.” She wipes the drool from his lips tenderly. “Poor thing.”
The warrior only smiles. His gaunt face and pale skin only emphasizes the hungry look in his eyes. “Is there a difference?”
Swallowing, Steve struggles to find his voice and when he does he croaks out, “Steve will do.”
“Are you going to put it on?”
Steve flexes his hands opened and closed, but whatever he’s trying to shake off holds him in its grasp. He grimaces as if he’s struggling not to scream out. Turning his head to the side, he says, “Yeah, water, please.”
. She always gave and gave, abundantly.
“Don’t worry, you won’t die.” She snickers but retrieves a ceramic bowl and ladles out some of the stew. “You’re healing. It will take time because of the Soul Keeper. But you will heal. He can’t stop that.”
Steve held Tony close, brought him to his chest. “Yeah, yeah more than okay.”
He thinks of his dream of being saved by the hero of the story. “Nat, I know I have to be my own hero, so don’t worry about me.” He doesn’t wait for her to reply. He leaves the brothel at the same time a creeping sensation chills his spine.
“You took away my consent.”
“He seems to tell Jo-Jo quite a bit,” Penny says.
Pepper stops dead in her tracks as she holds up one of the suits Steve brought with him. Her arm drops and the suit drags on the floor. “What do you mean?”
The sleek design, the colors mimic his Iron Man armor – it’s everything that Tony would have desired in a skiing outfit. His mouth goes dry. “I-mm- I like it. Yes, I do.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about. Steve is fine.” But Tony knew that it had been a careless disregard for the advice of his elders. Many said that Thor was one of the first generation of vampires, made during the Middle Ages during the plague when it hit Europe. There had been legends that the vampire disease spread at the same time as the bubonic plague and that many a reanimated corpse was burned at the stake during the scare. The first generation went to ground and became more myth than anything else until the earliest part of the last century changed all of that and vampires came into the metaphorical light. He conceded the point. “I’ll look after him. Don’t worry.”
“Can you select one?” Steve says. He doesn’t want to do that. “Just someone big and strong, and someone powerful enough to -.” He looks away and then adds, “I’m a sub.”
“Moving,” Tony muttered and then fell silent. Steve hadn’t a clue as to how to interpret Tony’s reaction. He seemed less stunned or curious but more solemn as if he hadn’t considered that the team wouldn’t end up disappearing and dissolving after the Battle of New York. “Really?”
His son, Tony Stark was brilliant, cunning, and bloodthirsty. He grew to the age of twenty five and stopped aging. At the age of seventeen he ordered the assassination of his father. Howard Stark died in a fire along with Maria Stark – a mistake that haunts Tony Stark to this day. Tony killed the assassin and drank him dry.
Steve hadn’t know exactly what Tony was saying when he retorted to Steve’s comment about Wanda being just a kid. He’d furrowed his brows and shook his head.
She stops him before he gets to self-denigrating. “Tony, don’t talk like that about one of my favorite people in the world.”
“Maybe.”
Steve joined the crowd around the gurney. Healing Sam had weakened Steve, causing an exhaustion to overcome him. He hungered to sit out in the sun for hours and sleep himself. He wondered if that was what he needed or if he was just imagining things. First things first – attending Sam’s questions.
When he searched his memory to figure out how he got on the Helicarrier, how he escaped the cell, Steve found nothing. How had he gotten away from Pierce and Ross? His brain pounded with an insistent ache. His memories fogged, and he slipped into an uneasy sleep. The turmoil growing inside of him seemed to take on a form, like a beast inside. He fought it through his dreams and nightmares. When he woke some hours later as evidenced by the light from the windows, Steve blinked to discover Tony sitting next to the bed. Steve sat up, though the room looped, and he swallowed down the nauseating bile.
“Apologize. You have someone here that disrupts my privacy. That’s unforgivable. I don’t care that you’re Jarvis’ nephew, the fact that you don’t take your responsibilities ser-.”
“There’s no bringing me home, Stevie. You think there’s good, but it’s all decayed away.”
She hurries beside him, her eyes glinting in the half light of the cabin. Several of his staff and crew scurry back, making way for their Lord. “You can’t just pick anyone, Tony. A good one, you have to pick a good one.”
Steve joins him. Tears streak his face. “God, how I missed you.”
Tony frowns. "Old school? I'll have you know I updated dear old dad's complete lab. Everything here is state of the art."
They never climb the steps to the higher levels, in fact they descend downward into the lower, more macabre corridors of the building. The Pentagon did not exist when Steve was a younger man before the ice. Its construction started in 1941, a few months before the attack on Pearl Harbor. The War Department – what the Department of Defense would eventually evolve from – was housed elsewhere.  Even though the Pentagon wasn’t completed before Steve’s ‘death’, as Captain America and a SHIELD agent, Steve had visited it several times.
Steve followed Clint’s soft direction. He sucked on the straw, welcoming the relief of the drink. His mouth was hot and dry. The flood of the thick liquid hit his tongue – for only a nanosecond he relaxed but then the taste hit him, and he blanched, gagging and choking. The tang of metal and salt – the taste of blood in his mouth. He vomited up what little he’d swallowed, coughing as he did. His eyes watered, and he gagged again.
He damns himself.
Natasha sidled up to Tony as they watched Steve head to the elevators in the posh London hotel. The lobby of the Hyde Park hotel shined with white marble veined with gray. Black pillars atop white bases gave a clean line while staying traditional and inviting. Tony had always liked the hotel when he was in London on business. He was glad that JARVIS managed to pull off getting rooms at the last minute.
A tugging on shirt drew his attention away from his mental spiral and he dropped his hands from his face to look at Pepper. She had her hand clasped over her mouth and she pointed to the observation window. Tears welled in her eyes. At first, he didn’t know what to say – yes it was terrible. Yes, these men were guilty of dehumanizing a person – a man. Probably someone that Stane or his father found on the street, lured away from their homelessness with the promise of a warm bed and a cup of hot coffee.
He doesn’t answer, but Steve can still feel the steady beat of Tony’s heart under the palm of his hand so he stays quiet. He listens to Tony’s regular breathing, taking some solace in the rhythm. As he lies next to Tony, the fire burns brightly, the shadows of the storm darken the cabin and Steve knows he’s made a mistake.
“I’m not sickened by my biology at all.”
“Dance?” He’s not a good dancer. Wanda and Scott (who is amazing) tried to teach him several times. Steve straightens his shoulders, wipes his mouth, and then stands stiffly.
“It’s beautiful.”
Thank you all for going on this ridiculous journey with me. Okay it's not ridiculous but I am giggling all the time as I write this fusion of Pretty Woman and MCU in SPACE (imagine my voice echoing on the last word).
“What is this for?” Steve has to ask. He doesn’t want to be part of blowing people up.
Tony knew he would come to hate the idea of privacy in the different apartments, but at the same time he hated being the weird overlord peeping into people’s lives. “Okay. I’m going there now.”
It’s too hard to resist and Tony buzzes at her again. “Don’t touch the sides, that's what I was trying to tell you before. Now, just gently pull that out, and whatever you do, don't pull out the-.”
Blu lifts his head, then drops it down.
“It’ll work.” Tony closes the fridge without getting anything out of it. He considers Steve’s words and then adds, “We got a few hours. Want to go get something to eat?” If Steve won’t come to him, Tony is that desperate that he’ll make the play himself.
“Want to feel you. Let me feel all of you.” Tony’s desperate and begging. Steve’s never really seen him like this. Maybe it’s because he knows they don’t have time anymore. This is all they have left.
With a quick glance over his shoulder, Rumlow directed, “Get some water. Everyone weapons trained, but do not fire unless I say.” He gestured for Steve to get out of the car.
Clint’s always known Steve to be fairly levelheaded when it comes to being one of the brothel workers. He hasn’t expressed any hesitation or shame about his work. “It’s -.” He stops and starts again, “Being in the culture of the brothel, all together, I forget sometimes what others think of us. Even with some of my clients being dickheads. I like what I do. It’s fun and I get to help people feel better. But now-.”
“Activate it or I will kill him,” Estane says. “This is your one chance to keep him alive. Otherwise I will kill him right here. I will gut him and I will make you eat his entrails.”
“What? I thought Stane was dead, killed by Ultron’s legion drones.”
“Fuck,” Tony replies and plummets into Steve with abandon.
“I didn’t die in battle. I lived a full life in another timeline. I got my happy ending.” He tastes the stew – it’s hearty, rich, and earthy in a way.
Steve mummed up. Every other image of the emergency treatment when first delivered to the hospital faded into oblivion but that rang clearly like a clarion bell.
“That’s no guarantee,” Tony says.
The thoughts of his dreams coming true only to have them cracked open and lost hollows his hopes and he meets Tony’s eyes. All he sees is pity. “You-I don’t remember that.”
“Are you sure you don’t want to do it yourself?” Alternate Steve gloats.
I have relatives visiting for the next few weeks so getting time to revise is going to be nearly impossible. I hope to get the next chapter up (at the latest) 6 August! Sorry for the delay.
“I like to read,” Tony says. “Go. Hurry.”
“I’m gonna go hit the hay. The flight in was tedious.”
“Just for shits and giggles.” Rumlow strikes again this time at his belly. Steve curls in a ball and cries out.
“I hope I’m not the ugly.”
Bucky lets out a pent up breath. He paces around in a small circle in the wide open area of Steve’s office. It’s empty – the office – too empty for Steve’s liking, and it’s far too big. He only wanted a desk and a console to work on, he even offered to do his work on the Howling Commando, his ship, but the nascent government and governors disagreed. The hero of the rebellion should have the best.
Tony reaches out a hand. “Yes. Very much.”
Tony chuckles as he picks up a bottle from the cart and then settles back down next to Steve. He places the two glasses down and then proceeds to open the bottle. “Natasha is more than a treasure. She’s a shrewd businesswoman. She knew I’d be coming here and knew my type. She zeroed in on you like an eagle on a fish.” Steve frowns at the reference. “Big raptor type bird. Seriously, you don’t know it?”
Tony turns almost instinctually toward Strange. His expression is desperate, a dying man looking for a last sip of water. “I’m upgrading the implant. It shouldn’t be a problem with the immune system.”
The nurse bows a little and excuses herself. “I’ll be right outside if you need me.” She points to the side rail where there are call buttons. She leaves.
“Some do, I don’t think you would, if you heard the whole story.”
“Poor Clint,” Steve says and pulls out the lube. “There’s a few different kinds. One is supposed to taste like strawberries.”
Tony presses on the screen for more information. It only flashes:
“It’s the one thing he failed at, Anthony. You don’t understand,” his mother responded, but he glimpsed a sadness in her eyes as if she knew that she would never take first place in her husband’s heart. And Tony hated Steve Rogers all the more.
“That isn’t Steve!” Bucky jumped up. His eyes raged, his cheeks heightened with color. “He didn’t like guys. He went on dates, with me. I found him girls.”
“What are you smiling about?” Steve asks, his voice husky and slow.
“And that would have been the epitome of narcissistic behavior, sir.”
Before he even comes down from his climax, his pelvis still pumping into the air, Tony stands up, spins him to face the shower wall, and slips inside without pause. The nanites help him to adjust to the intrusion and the thick heaviness of Tony’s cock inside him, causes Steve to thrust back onto him. His cock orgasms again, dry and spent.
“Ride into Captain, come on, right into it. Let go,” Tony says into his ear.
Walking down the long street of the town, Steve rotates his shoulder, still feeling the tension from healing muscles and nerves. Bucky wanted him to stay in bed for another few days, but enough time has passed and he’d heard some rumblings about the possibilities that Schmidt might be up to no good again around the riverbed. He’s got to get Shield properly shoed.
“No. Not ever.”
With a quick look to Clint, Steve went to reach for his bag containing his shield. But he was too late. Something knocked him over and he fumbled, staggering to the floor of the car. A young man with bleach white hair stopped, saluted him, and then knocked the bag out of his hands. In milliseconds the man disappeared in a blur. Dumbfounded, Steve stood for a moment and tried to parse what the hell just happened. But he never had the time for that because the young woman shot red flames at the train even as Steve looked out the windows again trying to get a glimpse of the young man.
While the river is wide it’s nothing like the mighty Mississippi or the angry Niagara, this is a river that reminds him more of a snake. Its dangers are hidden along the winding of its coils.
“Huh.”
“Steven!” Thor jumps to his feet and clamps Steve in an embrace. He beats him on the back and then separates but grips his shoulders. “We haven’t seen you since before the launch. It was spectacular! The reviews are raving about the story and the art. How modern and very driven it is. Stripped from today’s headlines. You must come back.” He shakes Steve a little.
“I think we need to slow it down.”
He licks his lips and wishes his eyes would focus, that his brain would clear of the clouds. But he’s floating in gray skies that are threatening to flash with storms. “Wo-work?”
Before he realizes it, Steve’s pulling over and Tony can hear the crunch of gravel beneath the tires of the bike. “Little roadside dinner.”
In mornings he went to the bathroom and studied his reflection in the mirror. Strange eyes looked out at him, strange not in color but in substance. His soul metamorphized into something brittle that snapped like a dead twig. Hollow inside. Steve went through the motions of shaving and stared at his open razor with a kind of wanton delight. It glinted in the light of the bathroom and then he saw his mother standing in the mirror.
“This is not a boxing ring,” Cho says. “Stop it. Just stop!”
WARNING: Graphic depictions of self harm.
“I don’t doubt you, Captain.”
“Breaking the centrifuge was a great way to start.” Bruce gripped the arms of the chair. Steve swore his knuckles turned green instead of white. “I can deal with it. I can.”
“Heartless,” Steve murmured.
“Just get me up, I got to work-.”
“I wasn’t, I wasn’t turned like normal vampires,” Bruce said and bit back his lips. “It was an experiment. We were trying to reverse the whole thing. You know? We wanted to save the undead. I swear it. It didn’t work. I used the serum on me – it was supposed to be a mixture of the super soldier serum like Steve has and a cure for the vampire disease.”
“Coffee? Eggs? What would you like?”
“When’s he going full time?” Tony scrapes the dishes.
He wants to protest but the energy just isn’t in him. All this time he only filled the script on the rescue inhaler because he couldn’t afford the monthly cost for his daily one. It never occurred to him that he could finally purchase his medicine with his new salary. His voice is rough when he speaks, “’m okay now.”
As consciousness scratched its way back, his body ached with need. He grumbled but then something hard and large blocked the sound. He tried to bite down and the rubber of the ball gag stopped him. Steve blinked away the crud in his eyes. He groaned as his cock thickened. He tried to place what was going on, but a headache arced through his brain, bringing tears to his eyes. The pain streaked through his temple and into his cheekbone, piercing it like an ice pick, but at the same time his body responded to an erotic touch. He groaned around the gag and tried to focus.
“Stev-.”
“You better say yes or else he’s going to moan about it all the way home to Momma’s place.” Morgan munches on her cookie and rolls her eyes. She flips through the book as if she’s said nothing at all.
“It doesn’t always work that way – there has to be intent,” Fury said.
Bruce helps Tony go through the final checks and calculations, though he’s more subdued than usual. He knows Tony’s been having more visions, more images are crowding his brain. It means big time seizures are just a petit mal one away. The doctors want to run tests, Tony refuses. All through the wait, Tony steers clear of Steve. He can’t say why exactly, but it might be that he wants Steve to come to him – though he already did once. Steve broke off his relationship with Logan and came back to Tony. He specifically sought out Tony. It might be greedy, but Tony wants him to do it one last time.
“No, this has to be stealth as much as it can be,” Steve said. “The Hulk is not stealth in anyway.”
Tony jerked in his arms and mumbled, “What?”
“Help me get him up,” she replies and then whispers something to Steve in Russian.
“Whoa! I hadn’t even thought of that!” Clint smirked. “How many? How many beds have you broken?”
He furrows his brows – he knows nothing about fractals.
“It’s the preternatural virus mixing with the physicality of human DNA. The Divini is just the next step along the way. The butterfly released from its cocoon.” Shuri shrugged like it was all so boring and obvious to her. “It is the next stage of their evolution with the supernatural viral components of their genome.”
“Maybe a little. But I know I’m not the only one who sees you mooning after Cap.” He thinks he detects a little giggle and he doesn’t appreciate it.
“It’s wonderful, Tony. Thank you so much. How’d you know I’d need it?” Steve carefully places the shield back on the clip and then presses the disc; the nanobots collect and then stow in the center of the disc.
She nodded. “Thanks, Clint.”
“When I’m your fake boyfriend, you’ll have to share it with me.” Tony smiles but it drifts away from his face.
“You’re thinking too much,” Pepper said in a lazy, tired voice.
“But he did, didn’t he?” The voice wasn’t his mother’s. He didn’t place it. Disorientation grew but he blinked away the tears as the woman continued, “You were strong – strong to keep fighting for life. And he was there, and he stopped them. Didn’t he? Tony – your mate – stopped them.”
Two of the soldiers join the leader while the captor near Tony grabs him and shoves him back to his knees. The two soldiers that now stand on either side of the leader wait for his cue and, when they get it, proceed to beat Steve, first with the butt ends of their assault rifles and then with their boots when he falls over. He cannot fight back, if he does Tony will be shot and then the whole exercise will be for naught. He won’t risk another life for his wings.
“Yes,” Tony says. “Please stand.”
Visibly Steve swallows and then drops his gaze to his hand. He silently shakes his head. Through his lashes he looks at Tony. “I thought the serum would cure me. They said it was a mental disease. That someone like me was deranged.”
“Don’t be offended, I rarely listen to anyone.”
Bucky hugs the cables close but the tie-fighters strike and fire. The first bolt hits his flesh arm and he cries out, but then clenches his teeth in order to muffle his own pain. The second bolt hits the ladder just above where he’s holding onto it with his metal hand. It frays and snaps, leaving only the other cable to stabilize the ladder. He grabs for the slat and then struggles through the pain of his right shoulder, trying to ignore it as he scrambles up the ladder.  Even with two good arms with the ship in transit and tie-fighters firing at him, mounting difficulty would test him. This – without his one flesh hand – is almost impossible.
Buckling in on the jet, Tony watched the other members of the team. Natasha and Bruce sat next to one another – she most obviously was in charge of keeping him calm. Clint and Sam played a game of chess as Steve sat to the back of the jet and by himself. Tony frowned as he looked down at the seatbelt. He stopped and unclipped it, then he got up and went to join Steve.  Steve only gave him a cursory glance and then turned back to his book. It was one of the ones Tony brought back from Strange.
“I can call in a lawyer, Steve. As Steve’s Alpha I grant him the pleasure of spending his presentations with anyone I pick or someone we agreed upon. This man is obviously that.” Tony’s strung tight, ready to snap.
“Okay.” Steve doesn’t give it much thought; his stomach rumbles as he smells the fries and the burgers.
“Sounds good, thanks,” Sam says and smiles as she walks away. “Seems like a nice town.”
“I wasn’t one of the advocates for the program. When we got him, he was half insane from the ice. Apparently, he was conscious during the ice and the pain – well the pain drove him over the edge. Even Captain America has his limits, and being in the ice for over 65 years broke him. He spent some time under the care of SHIELD.” Fury opened the folder with the information on Steve. “It isn’t pretty. Nothing could help him.”
“Not sure.” Bruce rolled his head back and forth on the back of the chair. “I was just standing there and suddenly I’m in the middle of a forest and Nazis are shooting at me. I can hear the ping ping of the bullets off my shield, and the stench of blood and oil burning my nostrils. All around me carnage. But I have to lead the survivors from the concentration camp I liberated to safety. They’re weak. So weak.” He put a hand over his face. “It was terrible. The smell.” He gagged a little and Tony swore he saw a little green shift over his chest and forearm.
“I did it, I know I did it,” Bucky said as the images assaulted all of them. “I remember each and every one. All of it.”
“I don’t really want to talk about it.”
“It’s a packet of condoms, a fresh tube of lube, and a bottle of Champagne. Also a note.”
“With Captain Rogers, it will probably take years considering he does not have a family to bond with nor any close friends. His synchronicity is isolated and off. The likelihood of him actually having a pack with multiple members, as I mentioned, is small.”
“Keep reading.” Tony waited his hands in his pockets.
“This must be serious – you’re putting off morning coffee.”
“Time.”
The grizzled guard huffs, throws a deadly glance at Steve, but follows orders and is left behind in the shop as the dozen clerks surround him like locust on a field of crops.
Steve nods. “That would be nice.”
A sub/omega lying to their alpha had been unheard of in Steve’s day. It could mean worse than the rack. An omega could be lessened, could be ‘given over’ as they called it in his day. The alpha could bond with another omega and leave the previous omega as fodder for the new one to do with as he or she pleased. It wasn’t a good prospect. But that was years ago and times change. So Steve had luxuriated in the idea of an alpha, Tony, accepting him.
The hind quarters of the deer sits next to the fire. Tony swears and picks it up, adjusts a few of the branches so that they will balance the thigh over the fire. He has to keep his strength up; he has no idea how far the nearest village is or if he’ll be able to get the HUD working. In no time at all the smell of cooking meat fills the air and Blu lifts his head and peers over his shoulder at Tony. He licks away the blood on his snout and then mewls.
“Wakanda has something nicer, I think.” He tries to shrug but there’s no energy left in his body. “I had to- I went into heat.”
Steve nods. Going into heat always meant that sleeping was near to impossible. Waking up, needy and hot in his blood caused issues with sleeping anyhow. After he’s clean, he slips off to sleep and when he does wake, full with a knot thick in his ass, he succumbs to the alpha’s commands, and holds onto this orgasm. It isn’t hard to be the supplicant, the loyal omega when he’s in heat. It is the basis, the foundation of his nature.
When the staff left him alone with Steve, Tony tried to say the Soul Mantra, tried to sing it out loud and repeat it. He hoped that some part of Steve might hear it, be disturbed enough by it, might anchor him in the here and now. It made no difference. Steve’s touch, that link between them drifted further away. Tony rubbed at his face and found tears staining his cheeks. He stepped up to the bed and touched Steve’s hand.
Tony gives the bow back to Clint. “Can you do better?”
“What’s leftover? Posh! You are right in the thick of it!” Tony teases and Steve swears he’s only doing it to see him blush.
“Well, the damned universe didn’t think she was that important considering it didn’t even wait until she was in the ground to name a new Guide,” Steve hissed back. The tears threatened again and his voice broke as he spoke. Every part of him screamed in defiance of the universe. Of it wanting to name a new guide, of it pushing these new feelings to the surface. Yet at the same time, he wanted to succumb to it. He shook his head and looked away. “Sorry, sorry.”
She sighs a little. “What I mean is this – Steve’s fragile right now. The whole Barnes thing ate him up. He’s not like me, he’s not used to holding his secrets for the greater good. But he’s held this one about himself, because he’s always believed it was for the greater good-.”
The village he lands in is close to where he approximates he had been held prisoner for three months of his life. He cannot pin it down exactly, because his escape flight and walk in the desert had been haphazard at best. He’s been searching the general map for months now, and cleaning out the den of bullies and terrorists. He’s become a local hero.
“I think he’d prefer something in the main room,” Steve urges.
“You have to say it, Tony. I won’t do it unless you say it.”
“I need to do a whole hell of a lot more than that, Cap,” Tony says.
He was happy. Just today. Just last night. He was happy. Yet the truth remained, he barely did make love to Pepper. Maybe once a month, maybe less. They were too busy, he’d tell himself. She never complained. But now he couldn’t even get it up to satisfy her. He left her frustrated and hot in a cold bed. He wanted to put a fist through the expensive marble tile in the shower.
Yinsen glances at the lion. “Yes.” He ladles soup into the bowl again. “Now, you must eat. When they come back, and they will, you need your strength. They recovered you for a reason, I am afraid Mister Stark. I could not do what they asked, perhaps you can.”
“Yeah, yeah, just easy does it,” Tony says. “Okay now, the copper wire - you got it?”
“Yeah,” Steve agreed and then frowned. “Power pump?”
It was Clint – a Neutral and Natasha – a Dom – they had to worry about the most. Natasha stuck her tongue to the side of her cheek and glared at them. Tony felt the shift in pheromones. Pheromones dictated their lives, every day. Today the flood in the conference room overwhelmed. Next to him Steve shifted, only slightly. His head laid upon the side of Tony’s thigh. In this setting, when Steve had been triggered to show his submission, he stayed put, but Tony knew he ached to stand, to defend them both. Tony wondered at the dichotomy of Steve’s life – how he dealt with being a Sub and a leader all at once. By comparison, Tony had it easy.
“No. I don’t. I don’t think so. He makes the world; he has to play by the rules too.”
“I’m sorry. I wasn’t prepared to deal with Obie. It was stupid and cruel. I didn’t mean it, and I especially didn’t want him to proposition you. I’m sorry. I don’t want you to go. Will you please stay?”
Steve nodded but still didn’t look up at Tony. “There’s something else. Something horrible, Tony.” Now he did move. He met Tony’s gaze. “When Natasha and I were on the run from SHIELD, we ended up finding a version of Zola. His mind, believe it or not, had been uploaded into this huge databank. He told us things about how Hydra grew inside of SHIELD. He called it a beautiful parasite.” He made a little laugh. “How beautiful could it be if it’s a parasite?” His eyes glimmered with unshed tears as he looked at all of the paper work. “You have to believe me, Tony. If it had been Bucky, if he had any control, any free will he would never have done it.”
With those words, Steve glanced down at himself and the sickly man he was disappeared and he returned to his enhanced form again. “So, I’m not supposed to have anything for me?”
“I’m gonna clean up.” Steve leaves without letting him comment.
“It finished 15 minutes ago. It is still undergoing testing and validation processes, sir.”
“Increase tension by twofold,” Rumlow directed, and the nanotech answered him. The mechanism embedded in the floor and ceiling cranked alive. It strung Steve’s limbs and pulled him toward the corners of the room. He struggled but the more he moved it seemed to feedback to the nanobots, making them that much more powerful. “Let’s keep him there while I work on his wound.” Rumlow studied Steve. “You know, when I heard they thawed you, I was kind of excited. Everyone knows your story. Everyone thought you would be a savior for the V-Corps.” He chuckled. “Weren’t we the fools?” He took out a small penlight from his vest. “Not fools anymore, huh?”
“Hey,” Steve calls and ducks out of the corridor. “Thanks.”
Happy disappears.
Steve straightens in his chair as the air in the room vanishes.
Steven lifts his gaze and there is sympathy there, a certain kindness that seems more knowing that it should be. He seems wiser, ageless to Tony. “I don’t disrespect you. At all. I never did, Tony. You have to believe me.”
is. “Sometimes when I think of being in space, you know, up there.” He points to the ceiling of the deli. He’s aware that all of the patrons are watching them, that standing next to the booth, frozen like this is probably being recorded and live-streamed even as he continues. “With the nuke on my back, it all comes back. The feeling of loss and the feeling like a thousand tendrils like snakes are crawling all over me, swallowing me up.”
As he approaches the house, Pepper hurries forward and opens the door, leading him to a small room off the parlor; it is set up as a hospital room. Steve frowns but doesn’t ask, he only lays Tony on the bed as Bruce enters and goes to work.
“Okay.”
“No! No. I just thought you might,” Steve stops. He’s not certain what he thought. “It’s been a weird day.” From hiking, to dancing, to hanging out in bed with his boss, his brain just might explode.
“I believe you,” Pepper says in a whisper.
“Sure.” Steve nods and Tony hops off the chair and briskly goes back to the bedroom. While the prince acts a good game, Steve sees through it. The pain and stress of his position eats him alive from the inside out. If Steve has any hope of making a change in this war and possibly saving Bucky from a terrible fate, then he has to find a way to support Tony. And it has to be more than a good fuck.
Steve feels the flush of heat on his cheeks. “Thanks. Looking forward to it.” He sounds all bravado and confident but hell if he knows what he’s doing. Fucking for a living never was one of his hopes and dreams when he was a kid. But he can make a good living here and he knows that he’s the type some people are looking for.
“Are you so sure?” Natasha asked but her gaze focused on Pepper, who seemed more fidgety than usual. In fact Pepper was never a nervous nelly (whatever the hell that meant) but she was acting that way now. She kept playing with her hair, and throwing side glances to Tony. The subject of heroing and Iron Man truly bothered her.
“Okay.” For the first time, Steve glimpses a younger, more innocent prince before him, his eyes wide with gratitude.
“Well, someone did,” Nat said as she hung an arm around Fury’s neck. Where they a thing?
“We’re going to an island?” Steve asks as Tony leaves the room.
“Well, be careful. We don’t need more people knowing your secret,” Tony said and accepted one last kiss before Steve departed.
“Changed it?”
Quickly disrobing, Tony tosses his clothes in a heap in the small closet and then jumps in the shower. It takes a few minutes for the water to even out and get hot enough for him. Steve might not mind the cold, but he sure does. The water rains down but his mind runs in circles.
“Grandfather, he was my grandfather, okay?” Steve says as if it’s only dawned on him this instant what the connection might be.
Tony whacked her away. “Fury? Is he going to be able to do anything? They’re coming. The V-Corps – they have a building full of men and women who are trained to do nothing but kill us. Do you get it? They are going to be up there on the roof, waiting for us!” Tony stumbled over the word roof. The idea of going back there again, of seeing the crosses on the roof, crashed into him like the frigid hell of an avalanche. Its power too strong for him to fight again, for him to stand up again. The coldness seeping from Steve and from his terrors paralyzed and froze him. “No!”
“I think I need to go,” Tony whispered. Bruce screwed up his face.
“For now,” Cho says, and she meets Natasha’s gaze as if to ask for a confidant, someone who will be on her side when she presents the idea of shutting the whole experiment down.
The leader backhands him, the rings on his fingers slicing open Steve’s lip and cheek. He hisses and probes the cuts as he bends away from the man.
“When I was held, abducted, I was wounded, seriously injured. Ended up with heart damage that should have killed me.” He shrugs. “It helps keep me alive. It can be hooked up to a battery, to shock my heart when it decides to die on me.”
“Is this all right? The bed, that is?” Steve asks.
Pepper frowns at him. “Can you go and pick up the documents from the printer?” She’s tapping on her tablet again. “They’re all printed out.”
The prince lets out a curse and shudders fully. Inwardly Steve smiles. “You like that? You like that I enjoy your scent? I can do so much more with my mouth. Let me take off your pants?”
Pepper studies him and then leans forward on the desk, her arms folded. “Tell me this isn’t about that thing in your chest. You’re not dying are you?”
“Okay. Sure.” Though Steve doesn’t want to leave Tony, it’s the best solution. He’s the only one that knows the important files. “I’m going to leave for a little bit, Tony.” He touches his face, hoping that Tony’s focusing on him. “Pietro is here to keep you company.”
“Gotta agree with Cho here. You about scared the shit out of me. What the hell were you doing?” Tony said and rubbed at his chest.
Bucky shows no mercy. He knows they have shown none to Steve. He flies into action, accurately firing a round but he only targets two of their attackers. The other four are too close and both Sam and Redwing are in the way. He holsters the rifle and swings around with his metal fist impacting hard against the one attacker trying to take out Sam. Redwing swoops in and claws at another's eyes as Sam kicks and then shoots without hesitation. The last assailant isn't deterred by the fact his comrades have fallen. Instead it sends him into a rage he aims his blaster but he never lets off the round to scorch Redwing out of the sky. Bucky shoots him dead. He falls to the ground, a mess of gore and blood where his head once was. Redwing perches on Sam's shoulder with a chirp at Bucky.
Tony wipes his eyes and face. He hates to show weakness to Bucky, the only other alpha on the team. “He never told me.”
Tony dumps all of the supplies at the foot of the bed, while Steve backs onto the bed, carefully and tentatively. Glancing at the door, Tony asks, “What’s going on here, really going on? Who is Clint and the redhead? What-.”
“Fuck me and all the tension will leave. You’ll feel a lot better,” Tony urges and pulls out the tube of lube. “Right now, right here.”
“Hey Blu, you think you can find us some water?”
“Fury is going to signal us,” Clint said. “We can’t stay here. They’re bound to come soon to check on the dead camera.” Clint pointed to the corner of the wall. “I was assigned to monitor it and switch it to a dummy recording before your little stunt.”
Tony had known he was on the V- Corp radar for visiting Blood Dens. Like other newborn vampires, Tony lived his undead life like a man planning to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge. Every moment of every night could be his last. So, he ended up in Blood dens in a blood fever. Taking what he could get without considering the consequences even when the face of Yinsen haunted his dreams. It didn’t matter. Immortality aside, young vamps rarely lasted more than a few years. Ones like Natasha, Thor, and Loki were different. They’d survived the ages and wars. Tony never saw them drink, he wondered if they even needed to anymore – though Thor and Natasha both had mates.
Over the course of the next few hours, Tony enlists Steve in dismantling several of the shells, helping to smelt what he calls the core, and constructing a small metal casing.
A disturbed expression crosses Jamison’s face but he agrees to do his duty, like any faithful member of Tony’s clan. Jamison is an alpha and still he obeys while Steven does not. Everyone must know their place, especially Tony’s warrior omega.
Steve only laughs. “Good luck with that, not like we have much, Stark.”
It takes a while for her to answer. He’s halfway through rewiring the connection to the whole house generator when his phone pings.
“Yeah, a little. Well, a lot. It was a great experience. I got to see a lot of the world.” Steve smiles for the first time, a real smile not the professionally pasted on one he walked through the door with.
“What?” Steve brushed his hand down Tony’s back.
“Bucky wasn’t in his right mind.” Sam chose a slice and began to eat.
Strange considers the medics and they bow out, leaving from the front of the plane. “You’re Mister Stark’s personal assistant, correct.”
“Like I said, I had it under control. My peeps and I,” Tony said. He downed the last of his Scotch and then balanced it on the railing. “Is this an official reprimand by SHIELD? Because it really doesn’t matter. I’m out of the superhero business, if you didn’t notice.”
It isn’t a question. “I couldn’t ask you to do that,” Steve says. “You’re only just recovering yourself.”
In minutes the cradle’s low hum dissipates and completely fades away, then the clamps release, and the table he’s lying on rises. Cho and her team surround him. Her smile is tender and she looks down on him with a certain softness. “We think the gland has taken. It was touch and go for a while, but we have good circulation now and the nerve stem is responding. We’re going to take you to recovery now.” She states all of this as she unlocks the cuffs around his wrists. “Sorry about this. You kept clawing at the incision site. We had to start the cycle over three times because of it. You’ve been in the cradle for seventeen hours.”
“Okay, okay,” Steve says and knows that Tony’s sinking fast. He needs to get him out of the rest of his wet clothes and bundled in some blankets. Kneeling, he pulls off Tony’s boots and then goes to his pants. He works as quickly as he can considering his fingers have lost all feeling and his own body threatens to sink into the oblivion of the cold. But the fire is a God sent and he keeps functioning, keeps forcing his body to do what it needs to do.
As he leaves, he notices that Stane glowers at him as if he’d watched the entire interaction with Odin. In seconds, Stane joins Steve at the corner of the room where he’s taken refuge from the Asgardian. Stane towers over Steve.
“I suppose all the conspiracy theorists were right about this shit.” Tony said. “SHIELD wants you to bond with their spies so that you end up like them. And then they will use you.”
“And I could starve to death too. That’s always a fun thought.” He reaches to Tony and clasps his hand. “You want to go shopping. Let’s go shopping.”
“Yeah.” Steve lifts the portfolio. “There’s some issues with the coloring on the back pages for some reason. You might want to take a look. I made some comments on printed and electronic copies.”
He gags and rushes down the narrow, broken stairs, nearly falling as he ends up in the jail office bent over the waste basket, puking. He thinks it’s over but it’s not as his stomach roils and he vomits up the last of his dinner, the pain streaks in his eyes and nostrils. He spits out the last of it and a hand settles on his back between his shoulder blades.
While he mulled over Loki’s fate a tapping on the door roused him. He blinked away the stasis, happy that he’d had a good amount of blood otherwise it would be more difficult to wake. “Yeah?” He scrubbed at his face. He stunk like come and blood.
They weave their way through the crowds on the concourse, Clint leading the way. He holds the crowd mesmerized by his attitude and his ‘give no fucks’ persona. Naturally, the people part for him and Steve watches with amazement. They end up at The Cage – just the most exclusive shop on the entire concourse of the station.
“-cut into the nerve stem of the gland. That nerve stem connects to the brain.” He tries to follow the stream of information but it becomes ever more horrifying as they explain what’s happening to him. “Serum can’t seem to fix it. They’re trying. We’re trying.” And then he can hear someone crying.
He still remembered the stench. All Blood Dens smelled the same. Sweat mixed with blood and the distinct scent of musk and dirt. Several humans lounged in the main room, playing on their phones or dozing as they waited to be picked by a passing vampire. Several sported bite marks up and down their arms and necks. Most were pale, almost sickly looking and Tony passed them by even as some of them grabbed at him. He waved them away. He had been hungry, but he still had his standards. In the corner of the room, Tony spotted him.
He forces himself to scrape dishes, to scrub pans, but all the while his mind runs at blistering speed. Steve must want to contact the other Avengers, lay the groundwork for the conversations, this Statement of Responsibilities. Should Tony call in his side of the team? Who is his side of the team?
“Four am sir,” JARVIS answered.
A whispered wind answered him as if the penthouse was open to the night. Standing, he shivered and wanted JARVIS to close the expansive glass doors, but instead he turned, and a long hallway appeared. Everything else went to darkness like he stood on a stage and a spotlight beckoned him.
He uses the last remnants of his soul to transform. He becomes the suit and the suit becomes him. He fights and wins. And Obie is gone and his life is over because the very thing that saves him is killing him. Rhodey tries to help, even Pepper intercedes but nothing stops it. Everyone says he’s a hero.
“Maybe the pieces were there for me to put together. Maybe I just wanted to turn a blind eye to them. But the truth is – I didn’t tell you Tony, because there was no benefit at all. None. At all.”
“Shield, her name is Shield,” Steve says and Happy gives him a fingered salute as he turns to lead Shield to a stall.  Jarvis waits on Steve as he watches the portly man lead his horse away.
He’s Tony Stark and he can’t leave well enough alone. Because none of it is well enough and he’ll be damned if he’s going to let whatever hell has surfaced on Earth continue. He makes promises to Steve not to interfere.
Bruce chewed at his lip and shook his head. His hands and temples were a shade of green that warned and terrified at the same time. “Back then, way back then when I was working with Ross and his daughter, he wanted to figure out the secret to the vampire immortality more than anything.”
Tony grabs his elbow and holds on as if he’s a port in a storm. “Then you have your wish granted, my dear.”  He pulls away and signals to Luke. “We want the silk and the leather.”
Pepper places the tablet on the desk and crosses her arms. She’s been his Personal Assistant on and off for over a decade now. He made the decision to ask her to step into the role of CEO of his company while he takes a back seat in research and development. If he’s honest with himself – which he tries not to be because that way leads to disappointment and disenchantment – Pepper was always way overqualified to be his Personal Assistant. She got her degree from Harvard Business School. She has a MBA. She deserves so much better, and finally he’s able to do it with Stane out of the way and his life finally on track. Partially on track.
Going up the metal ladder, they step onto the bridge. Jamison turns to Tony and nods to Steven. For a moment, Tony sees a flinch cross Steven’s face but he quickly recovers and greets the Master of the Fleet.
“Oh Christ,” Tony mutters. “My robot baby has a girlfriend.”
“JARVIS give me a read on any signatures that indicate weapons?” He knows that he might not get great data, but any information would help in this situation.
Okay, two.
Steve doesn’t answer. He’s frozen in the bed, trapped in some nightmare kind of sleep. It’s somewhere between a coma and slumber.
After a first round on the road to the docks and then back to the house, Steve heads the bike toward rougher terrain. He hits the meadows and it’s rocky and bumpy, but he controls the handlebars and wheels as if he’s part of the bike. It isn’t like dirt bike riding because those bikes are made for off road. This is raw and coarse, yet Tony finds a certain freedom even in it. Eventually, Steve turns back to the road and brings them down to the dock again. Tony’s limbs shake as he gets off the bike once Steve parks. His whole body’s on fire. His nerves scream at him and his muscles ache with adrenaline.
“Yeah, yeah!” Steve nodded his head and smiled back at Tony.
“Eve, eve, eve…”
“Maybe.”
“I love you.” He hears his voice before he recognizes that he’s saying it out loud and not in his head. He feels the comfort of arms around him and he smiles. “Blu.”
