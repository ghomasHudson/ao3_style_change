“No problemo.” Dean laughed and left the room, coming back with plates of food stacked atop his head and a huge bowl of punch that he held with both his hands. Castiel was impressed until he realized Dean was smirking when he set down the punch. “Let me guess…”
Staying with the Novaks had proved to be a good idea for the Winchester brothers. Dean had the occasional beer on his sad nights, but for the most part, he was sober. He hadn’t become his father, he took care of himself, and he did his homework.
'I’d like to just say your name. Scream it, even,' Castiel thought miserably. He only had one more year before he was shipped off to college. Thankfully, the government almost always made sure to send soulmates down the same educational path.
Of course, he chose a seat at the back of the class and hid behind a book. “Mr. Novak, would you mind demonstrating how to put on a condom for the class?” Castiel almost choked on his own spit.
A scary thought crossed Castiel’s mind when he read the first part of his soulmate’s clue. One he didn’t want to think about. One he knew was a strong possibly, but yet he hoped it wasn’t true. Someone else besides his soulmate also used the nickname. Someone also loved their car as much as his soulmate did. But Castiel had only just begun to consider the thought. If he guessed wrong, what might happen? Should he even guess at all? He knew he might be saving a life, but there were also many reasons why it couldn’t be his new acquaintance.
“Right, Cas...tiel, get off me,” Dean hissed, more like a dragged sigh, and nudged the other teenager out of the way. Castiel looked a little upset, maybe because his moment had been ruined or maybe because he felt embarrassed by the fact that he had to be forced away from Dean Winchester.
Castiel frowned and kept scrubbing. After about an hour and a half of cleaning, the Impala was returned to its former shine. “Oh, Baby. You look great.” Dean patted the top of his car, wiping his forehead with his sweatshirt sleeve. “Thanks again, Novak.”
Dean shook his head, “This is Charlie. She’s hella gay.” He assured his little brother. “Oh, okay.” Dean grinned and looked fondly at Sam. He didn’t know about anything that was going on with Dean, especially not the self harm. Dean did everything he could possibly do to keep Sam away from his father, meaning he would frequently take him to Bobby’s- a friend of his father’s. Bobby was like their uncle. But Sam knew a lot more than he let on. Of course, he’d forever make sure that Dean felt like he was protecting him no matter what Sam was really facing in his life. The two really cared about each other THAT much.
For the rest of the day, he couldn’t stop thinking about his task. He caught a glimpse of every girl he had class with, none of the ones without sleeves had any artistic drawings up their arms. A few wore sweatshirts so he wrote their names down for future reference.
2. I'm sorry for making John a horrible abusive parent. If I wrote this normally, and there wasn't any self harm, I would portray John as someone who really does care about his kids but tends to go about it in the wrong ways. Don't take it personally if you like John but I needed reasons for why Dean would want to self harm.
Castiel groaned. “Okay, so firstly, I know for a fact he has green eyes. He saved my life in the lake when I nearly drowned. I saw them. That was the first truly meaningful clue. The next one was pretty straightforward. I think he’s being mistreated at home, and he tells me that I’m the only reason he’s alive. Well, one of the only reasons.”
“I may have followed you as you followed them. You were acting suspicious and I figured I should tag along.” Gabriel admitted, rubbing his head with a cheesy smile. Castiel didn’t get to respond, since he heard a loud noise inside. His attention towards the window, where he saw a shadow from across the wall. There was a man with a beer bottle. And then there was Dean, blocking Sam from view.  “Did you get the money?” A gruff voice asked, Castiel assuming it was the one with the beer bottle. “Yes, sir, I worked fifty-four hours for it.” Castiel identified Dean’s voice, but it was much shakier than usual. Castiel didn’t know it could sound so frightened.
Gabriel pulled out a lollipop and handed it to his younger brother. Castiel just stared at it in disapproval and forced his face into his hands. “Yeah, Dean’s a huge dick, but why do you care so much about him? Don’t you have a soulmate to worry about, little bro?”
Dean knew that the doppelganger had been a shapeshifter, one who managed to discover his relationship with Castiel. It had to of been someone from school. But that didn’t matter anymore. That was just another monster.
“Shut up, loser.” Dean muttered. He couldn’t stand seeing Castiel so upset and wasn’t sure how else to make him feel better.
“Good morning,” Castiel greeted Charlie. Before she replied hello, she looked irritated with something and it made Castiel think. She usually never got worked up about things, maybe there was something wrong? No, it’s probably just some fictional form of irritation. Castiel guessed maybe her favorite character died or she lost an expensive comic book, but he was far from right.
“And how the hell do you think I’m supposed to get my booze, boy?” The man stepped closer to Dean, grabbing him by the collar. “Don’t mumble. That is DiSrepECTfuL. When I have to provide food and shelter for you shitheads,” he raged, “and send you to school, never home to clean the fucking house… only to have you treat me like THIS.”
Castiel expected a confession, but he supposed it was only the eighth day. Maybe it just need to take time. He was angry with Dean anyways, even if the jerk wasn't his soulmate. It was probably a good thing that Dean left, because then he wouldn't have to deal with him…. or the feelings that came along with him.
It's funny how the world can change in such a short amount of time. The light you cherish so deeply can turn black and the eruptions of laughter and happiness can fade into nothing in just a few seconds.
With a frown, Castiel looked down into the water at his own reflection. His hand caressed his cheek, wishing that someone else might do the same, and stared into his own eyes. He saw bright green ones staring back at him. He grabbed a loose stone from the side of the bridge and threw it down at his face, splashing away the emerald eyes.
“Hey, Charlie, where’d you-” Castiel’s footsteps stopped as he watched Dean’s lips across Lisa’s passionately. It seemed like a strong kiss, even if that wasn’t true, and to him- it looked even worse. Castiel’s mind liked to work against him and twist things to deepen their meaning and make everything more dramatic than it needed to be.
Either way, he knew he only wanted things he couldn’t have, and Charlie managed to snap him out of his daze by shaking his firm shoulders. “Dean! The hell?” Dean shook his head and smiled at her, taking a few steps toward the stairs of the school. “Sorry, Charlie, I gotta go. Lisa’s waiting for me.”
“Okay, well, I should go.” Charlie scribbled something on a piece of paper lying in the Impala and handed it to Dean. “Call or text me if you need anything.” Dean nodded respectfully. “Thank you so much, Charlie. See ya tomorrow.”
Dean’s eyes dilated and he was frozen in shock. Castiel had shown such passive-aggressive behavior for someone so normally quiet. “And Gabriel will be good to Sam. You won’t have to worry about his safety when my brother is looking after him. I think it’s time that you stop worrying about everyone else and start looking after yourself. What do YOU want? What does DEAN want?”
Of course Castiel felt bad about rejecting his supposed soulmate. He didn't want to hurt Dean Winchester, or lose him. But he didn't want to be bound to him, either. That didn't keep him from staring at his wrist all day, wishing calligraphy or drawings or just SOMETHING would appear. It was the cleanest his arm had been since the drawings first began.
Dean Winchester acted like he had it all under control but underneath that tough facade Castiel knew exactly what he was really feeling. Dean Winchester was scared and nervous. “How dare you-”
“Alright, then.” Michael proceeded to work out an idea towards the bottom of the board, writing Castiel’s name in fancy cursive. It sort of reminded him of the way Dean wrote his name, but it clearly wasn’t the unforgettable, beautiful calligraphy of his soulmate.
When Gabriel was done, Castiel shrugged and gave him an amused look. “Go for it, Gabe. But I won’t wake any part in it.”
He was considering the idea of skipping school today just for the hell of it. But Dean needed comfort. He needed someone to be there for him in a way that his little brother couldn't be. Sam had Gabriel to watch over him, cuddle him, and keep him safe from disturbing thoughts. Who was there for Dean?
Of course, hat thought had been assured wrong when his soulmate gave him answers. Castiel didn’t understand why they couldn’t just exchange names and finally meet. Most juniors had already found one another despite the rules that went along with their lives. Why waste time?
“Well, it’s complicated,” Dean started with a sigh He laid his head on the steering  wheel, careful not to honk the horn. “I don’t think I’m strong enough to handle pain at school and at home. I didn’t want them to turn against me.”
But this time was different. Castiel’s fingertips had began as single colored designs, but as he looked up his arm, designs became more intricate. Go up even further and you’d see pictures of people, sometimes animals, with symbolism. It was a wonder how someone could draw these beautiful things.
“Okay, we need to stop fucking around and get to the point,” Castiel muttered seriously under Dean's strong thick arms. Dean swallowed his spit and dryly asked, “What point?”
“Because, Cas,” Charlie began, “She’s not even the popular, know-it-all rude kind of bitch. She’s the nice kind.”
They greeted the pastor after they entered the church and walked down the pathway between the pews. Sam admired the architecture of the church, including its stereotypical stained-glass windows high up on the walls. Dean introduced them both as FBI agents.
Castiel awkwardly shuffled into the passenger seat, not feeling a shotgun vibe. He didn't feel like he had the right to ride up front. He thought about squishing in the back, but Dean's glare told him not to.
Castiel was blushing furiously but didn't hide his face. He nudged his right arm underneath Dean's arm by his torso and around to his upper back. His left hand found its way around Dean's shoulder and stopped beside his neck. Castiel was lying mostly on top of Dean now, but neither of the two cared. Castiel laid his head down on Dean's chest.
“Honestly, Charlie, don’t think like that. You’re just as wonderful as she is, if not better.” Castiel told his best friend sternly. He then observed Dean further to cure his boredom. “He’s got it too, doesn’t he?”
((I'M JOKING, DEAN WOULDN'T SAY THAT.)) Castiel’s head was spinning and he wasn’t sure he heard Dean right. “What did you say?”
Dean was dressed in a long sleeve dark green shirt and wore no sports jacket nor any school spirit gear like the others. He wore ripped jeans (ones that looked super unintentional but he managed to pull it off better than anyone) and a necklace with a weird face on it. Castiel stared at it, noticing Dean Winchester’s toned torso while doing so. He scolded himself, knowing that he should be focusing on finding his soulmate and saving a life rather than staring down living eye candy like a vulture.
“Soulmates!” Was Charlie’s only response. She quickly led Castiel to the row of bleachers out by the football field. She chose this spot because, one, she had a feeling they’d see Dean out there at some point, and two, it had a clear view of the sky that would help Castiel relax. They waited a moment, and Dean sure enough came out onto the field, but not in uniform like the other football players. He was carrying his uniform in his hands. Castiel didn’t hear any of the words spoken during that conversation, but he knew that when Dean approached the coach and held out his uniform he wasn’t looking to have it cleaned. He was turning it in, and giving up his spot on the team. The coach was very angry and began yelling but Dean only respectfully nodded his head, murmuring something, and walked down to the edge of the field. He didn’t look back, not to even see the look of sympathy on his soulmate’s face.
You're probably all too sad to comment, but you really should tell me if ya'll want a sequel. I sorta want to write one. Also, thank you so much for all the attention this story has gotten. I'm very grateful. I love you guys!!
Anxiety clawed at Castiel’s insides. Twelve days. That was all the time he had to figure out who he would spend the rest of his life with. If he didn’t figure it out, he would spend the rest of his life seeing black and white. Lonely. Desolate.
“Can we… not talk about this here? Maybe somewhere more private?” Dean asked, his eyes travelling across the hallway at the students whose eyes trained on them.
“Because my soulmate is male!” Castiel screeched, flushing a bright red after attracting the attention of several students around their table. Charlie nodded as if it was nothing, seeing as her soulmate was also of the same gender. She hadn’t figured out the name of hers yet, but they talked often, and Charlie didn’t feel ready enough to figure it out anyways. She received a clue that it was someone she was already close to, and she didn’t want to ruin any friendships she had considered how little there actually were.
Charlie ran up to Dean outside the school when she caught him alone. “You have a plan for today?” She asked, simply worrying about what would happen to the jock and to her best friend.
“Hey, earlier…” Dean looked up at him. Castiel didn’t think he’d ever seen Dean Winchester act submissive in front of anyone but him. With Lisa, he was dominant as well as with everyone Castiel had ever seen. But right now he seemed below Castiel. It was either that or Castiel just felt higher because he was accomplished (or because of the look of guilt on Dean’s sexy face). “I promise it wasn’t what it looked like. I sort of broke up with Lisa, you know. She wanted one last kiss and I’m a man of honor, so I gave it to her.” Dean explained and Castiel found himself wondering why he even cared, or why Dean cared enough to tell him why he did what he had done.
He sighed, throwing the apple into the trash can. He threw the entire basket of rotten fruits away, tossing a few cans of soda there too. As he went into the living room, or rather; sulking room, he noticed several beer bottles lying on the side tables and the floor. There was trash all over the place. It hadn’t been this clear to him before, but it got him thinking… he was just like his father.
When Sam knocked on the door, a man with black hair and a tall, lean frame answered immediately. “Hello, Michael. Thank you for allowing us to stay for the summer. We both appreciate it very much, don't we, Dean?”
He decided to conduct an experiment that afternoon. Dean's car wasn't the fastest he'd ever seen, but it was difficult to keep up with as he slinkied behind buildings in attempt to stay hidden. The weather wasn't great, it never had been, but he didn't care. It started snowing the longer Castiel tailed them, and he shivered underneath the minimal warmth jacket he’d managed to grab on the way out the door. His brothers had stolen almost all his clothes by now anyways.
“This case… it might not be monsters,” Sam noted, looking from out the window to his brother in the driver seat. He took such a big bite from his apple that the juice dribbled down his chin. “It could be a couple of sick pyros.”
“Hm, that’s a little harder. The guys here are just so stupid,” Charlie muttered, and when she saw the look on Castiel’s face, she added, “Except you and Kevin, of course. Oh look, here comes the stupidest.” Charlie looked in the direction of Dean Winchester, whose fingers wrapped around the ends of his sweatshirt so that no part of his arms could be seen. He was fake-smiling, Castiel knew that (he took a psychology class), but he wasn’t sure why. Kevin shot Charlie a look after she used the word stupidest but she happily ignored it.
Sooner rather than later the Winchesters were both in the Impala, with Sam in the driver seat. You know something's definitely wrong when Dean lets me drive, Sam thought awkwardly. He assured his brother that he knew where to go amd Dean had thrown him the keys without hesitation.
Charlie's mind went into panic zone, leaving her speechless. “It's Dean Winchester. It has to be.” Castiel’s fingers curled to form a fist. He wasn’t 100% positive, but he didn’t really want to think about the clues. He didn’t look at his arm for a while, mostly because he didn’t feel anything whatsoever. There was no sign of any writing or drawings anywhere. It’s like there were never any to begin with. He could’ve assumed he’d never even spoken to his soulmate if it weren’t for the fading but still visible scars.
Castiel closed his eyes and laid back down, shivering underneath the stranger’s leather jacket. He didn’t go back to school for the rest of the day and nobody else saw him.
Dean’s shadow was perfect against sparkling snow. Castiel had never took time to admire shadows, nor snow the way he did now. He found his movements sluggish as he approached the jock. He also found his mouth to be dry and his hands unusually sweaty despite the freezing temperatures. “H-Hello, Dean.”
“My last one was so easy, maybe he doesn’t want to know. For a second I thought he was going to guess my name, but then he didn’t answer…” Dean let his backpack fall off one shoulder and sighed when he looked towards the football field. The previous night his father had been particularly drunk and had tripped him for not cleaning the house, and his ankle wasn’t ready to take on another practice after school. But he wasn’t going to go to the nurse. He wasn’t going to let anyone find the bruises on his legs that also came along with the tripping.
'I’ve just thought of something. Tomorrow would give you twelve days to figure me out. On each day, I’ll give you a hint, okay?'
“Don't be silly, Dean, you saw me yesterday.” Castiel responded, balancing his head on his right hand. He watched Dean's eyes soften as his hands combed through the bubbles.
Castiel’s heart rate accelerated from what it had been already. The loving statement had made him extremely nervous, but he didn’t want Dean to know. “I want you too, Dean.” He leaned in until he could feel Dean's breath on his cheek.
Castiel soon became unconscious, his body feeling weightless against the surface of the water as he was carried to safety.
Dean gasped as the man wrapped his fingers around his throat, while Sam stood anxiously by the corner of the room. He didn’t appear to be strong enough to take on the man. “You could work-”
They set up a lot more decorations, some of which Castiel assured Dean he could reach himself, and others he allowed himself to be lifted. A lot of the Christmas-like decorations were no match to the DJ booth. The DJ had come in about an hour into decorating and set up their own little place in a corner of the gym. From there, Castiel hung snowflakes from the ceiling and placed Santas around the walls. There was a life-size sleigh and reindeer made out of foam they managed to hang with all of Castiel’s siblings’ help. It looked lovely and yet Castiel found himself still taping things to walls by the time the room turned from a few people to a crowd.
“That’s just it, Gabriel…” Castiel began, looking back at his wrist. “I think it’s him. It’s Dean. It’s gotta be him.”
Dean didn't think he could handle the pressure of thinking about it. He didn't want this to happen to the only person on Earth he was meant to love. Castiel was strong but who's to say he's strong enough to handle this? Dean had always thought his father to be a strong man, yet he hadn't climbed out of the walls keeping him hostage to his own depressing thoughts.
Castiel finally brought himself to leave his comfortable spot on the stairs. He couldn’t concentrate on his homework. And that night, like every other night, he would lie in bed, staring at his arm-- waiting. For designs to appear. Words, quotes,... anything. If he kept his eyes open long enough, he would always see a flower or two with vines trailing down his palms and onto his fingers.
Dean Winchester smelled like many things.  He smelled like car oil, smoke, and iron, but there was also another scent that lingered on his blue and green flannel. He smelled of crystal waters and sweet whiskey. He really smelled like the outdoors, specifically pine needles and the earth. When Castiel really, really, thought about it…and when he closed his eyes, he imagined he was laying on top of Dean in the woods, with ratifying mist and soft earth below them only complimented by the trees and flowers around them. Castiel was starting to wonder what he smelled like and if Dean found it attractive.
Dean opened his eyes.  “I understand.”  He pressed a kiss to Castiel's head. The teenager felt comforted by the kids, not pressured, and allow himself to be at peace.
Castiel’s message showed the exact opposite of the amount of confidence he actually possessed. He pretended to be sure, when in reality he was being torn apart by apprehension.
Gabriel was honestly shocked by his performance, having expected less skill than Castiel showed. He knew his brother was an amazing actor, but he didn't expect him to be THAT good. Of course, Castiel had a lot of stage fright and messed up once or twice in spite of it, but Gabriel knew from experience that these sort of things could be perfected over time.
“Castiel, don't you dare go up to that damned room of yours! Your father and I need to have a talk with you.” His mother yelled at him, realizing her tone as soon as she finished. She contemplated saying something but then noticed that Castiel had an unfamiliar coat draped across his shoulders.
Castiel traced his fingers over the five scars on his arm. They looked pretty deep and Castiel wondered how much pain his soulmate endured while doing it. Castiel assumed he wanted physical pain to take away the mental pain, but he didn’t think it was a healthy nor helpful trade.
“That’s okay, I don’t need the details… yet.” Charlie sighed and stared into Dean Winchester’s eyes. “Why would you want to hurt yourself?” She wanted to understand why the jock would ever do such a thing, especially when it seemed so unlikely. She also felt bad and wanted to help him to the best of her ability. “You’re popular and charming to most ladies, all the guys want to BE you, why the hell would you do something like that?”
But his soulmate didn’t reply to his question. Instead, the beautiful drawings laced up his arms grew lighter in color, leaving only the slightest but possible visible amount of design.
“It’s lovely, Dean.” Castiel leaned against him, smelling the rose lightly. The snow had begun to fall harder. It was freezing. “I love you very much.”
“It's… You…” Castiel mostly sputtered gibberish, because he had made a special connection. “You… you rescued me from the lake, didn't you?!” Castiel slammed Dean into the locker, causing the people around them to stare.
After he finally finished, his brothers dragged him into the meeting room. He didn’t really have friends, so he rarely talked to anyone, but his brothers almost always made sure he had something beneficial to do after school. Which sadly meant that he was forced to participate as a member of the dumb student council. It was only because his father was the principal, however much he tried to forget, and his brothers were given rights beyond those of normal students. Castiel knew it wasn’t right, but there wasn’t anything he could do to change it, so he kept his mouth shut and sat down. He hadn’t seen anyone that reminded him of someone who suffered from abuse the whole day. His soulmate was right, it was going to be hard for him. And apparently he wasn’t as observant as he appeared to be.
“Cassie can help ya! I’ve got a special date,” Gabriel’s cheeks were nice and pink. Castiel’s eyes widened for both parts of his idiot brother’s sentence.
Castiel's heart pounded furiously in his chest. Am I supposed to answer that?, he thought to himself. His anxiety levels had raised sky high and he hid behind Dean, using his hoodie to his advantage. The football players thankfully got disgusted and laughed it off before leaving. Castiel was surprised that they had left so quickly without any bullying whatsoever. Dean turned around and wrapped his arms around the smaller teen. “I'm sorry, Cas…” He murmured, pressing his nose to the crook of Castiel's neck. “But I choose you. They're not my friends anymore. It was an effective way to get them gone at least.”
Sam peeked through the door’s thin opening after tilting the doorknob, his worry obvious underneath a faked smile. “I just came to see how you’re doing. I know this might be a little hard for you, staying here, but I want to let you know-- I’m thankful you came. That house was a dreadful place to be. Castiel wouldn’t have wanted that for you.”
“Takes some of the mental pain away,” Dean Winchester answered softly. “At school, things may be alright- great, even, but that doesn’t make things okay at home. My life is pretty rough in ways I can’t even begin to explain.” He shifted in the driver seat, gripping onto the wheel as if he seeked comfort in knowing that he was really there, sitting in his beloved car, while talking to a real person. “I’m sorry,” Charlie apologized. “Is there anything I can do?”
The next day, Castiel was on alert. He had sucked a few candy canes because he was told that the peppermint flavor makes a person more keen to notice things. He didn’t talk to anyone. People were such stupid specimens and they would interrupt his judging. He now knew clearly that his soulmate was in fact male, but he couldn’t just figure it out with one clue. He desperately needed another one.
Charlie glared at him, her expression changing from happy-go-lucky to pure goddamn evil. “/Lisa/?” She growled, grabbing the straps of her backpack. “Shouldn’t you have broken up with her? Castiel will not pursue a guy with a girlfriend.” She noted aloud, crossing her arms. Dean shrugged. “She’s hard to escape.” He knew it was an excuse, but he didn’t want her snooping around in his affairs after he broke up with her because she might find out something she doesn’t need to know.
“You don’t?” Dean asked in bewilderment. “Nope,” Castiel shook his head and put the other hand on Dean’s left shoulder, staring him dead in the eyes. It was hard to mistake those green eyes, but his determination to make Dean feel better overpowered his suspicion… for the moment.
Castiel hid behind Gabriel the rest of the time, having been embarrassed for singing in front of everyone so dramatically. He honestly wasn’t sure how he followed through with it, especially after catching Dean Winchester’s eyes midway through. That’s where he felt his words choke up and his vocal range lower. It was okay, though, because Castiel thought he did well for someone who hadn’t performed in front of others before.
“Because.” Dean went on to further explain what he told Castiel about how his father didn’t approve of liking the same sex nor the idea of soulmates. “So, see? You just can’t say anything.”
“The fuck…?” he grumbles to himself, pulling the carafe of hot coffee out of its holder with his right hand and steadying his mug on the counter with his left. He looks down into the mug and yelps, surprised to see something white and
Castiel glances down with a shy smile, which is all the answer Dean needs. Who even knows where Castiel is squirreling them away, but Dean isn’t surprised one bit – just because Castiel was in a human body now didn’t mean he’d stopped collecting little things that belonged to Dean and putting them in his mug, still sitting on the nightstand, a permanent reminder of how things had started between them.
Dean lets out a laugh and ignores the weird swooping feeling in his belly as he starts wandering through the house, taking stock of what he might use to tempt the dragon away from his favorite mug. He wonders about what name would be appropriate for this small new friend of his. As he makes his way through the living room, Dean’s eyes land on a framed photo of him and Sam with their mom, one of the rare ones from before she got sick.
"Peace at last..." started Charlie, looking up. "It's so quiet here today... As if nobody had visited us for ages!"
"Do you live in the valley, Castiel?" Charlie asked. She wanted to help her cousin. Just this once. He seemed preoccupied with the subject of God's will in this case. He was the one who had inherited the family business for a reason. He could be dangerously fanatical.
When Castiel came downstairs, the first thing he smelled was the smell of freshly made coffee and toasts. The man immediately sped up his pace, although he did not realize it. His body needed food and liquids. A moment later, he was standing in the doorway of the kitchen and there he saw Claire, who was watching Dean pick up the broken plate from the floor with a cheeky grin on her face. Castiel leaned against the doorframe and decided to watch his husband in action himself. Of course, he exchanged an amused glance with Claire first.
But Dean didn't give him much time to think. He was impulsive and reckless. The man quickly climbed under the covers and moved to the middle of the bed. Dean couldn't be himself if he didn't sit perched on his husband's legs. Castiel, sensing what was about to happen, let out a long, loud moan that was meant to signal to him that it was far too soon for him to torment him. Dean, however, had not heeded it for a long time. With a huge, amused grin on his face, he leaned over and began placing wet kisses on his husband's exposed stomach. Dean had a certain weakness. Namely, it was Castiel's firm but still tender chest. It was a pleasure to kiss it, but he couldn't help how he moved down a few millimeters with each, successive kiss.
"You can get angry all you want and hate us, but we're your parents and we're raising you, Claire. We're a family, and a family takes care of each other. Remember that."
"I do not feel sorry for him," he replied, staring at the man with a blank stare. "I intend to do the will of the gods. And for that Castliel must live."
"Of course, Cas." He automatically replied, tightening his embrace around him. "I never doubted it and I don't doubt it. I love you, too."
"I see you had a successful day, darling," Dean said, smiling in his husband's direction. "By the way, Cas – that's my gun. My name is on the paperwork, not yours."
Charlie held a sight-impaired dog in her lap, which by some miracle was still alive. Her pale hands combed the animal's back. The woman looked ahead and tried to soak up the view of the red sky. This was her time to relax. She had returned from the city an hour ago. She made sure Bobby took his medication, gave the dog a water, and cleaned up the entire floor. After spending the day at work, she enjoyed the relaxation immensely, where many people might not have seen something special. Charlie sat in a rocking chair on the porch. Her feet rested on the old, dilapidated floor. She rocked while simultaneously tending to the animal that belonged to the family.
"Bobby called," Dean said, sipping his coffee. "e's going to come by tonight. Maybe Sammy will come too."
Following the directions, Castiel's hand found its way to Dean's buttocks. He massaged his bottom for a moment, then moved closer to his hole. Castiel licked his lips and pushed the man against him. When the man placed both hands on his shoulders, Castiel began the whole process. He decided to start with one finger, which for Dean was a devastating experience anyway. Feeling one finger of Castiel's hand inside him, he tightened his grip on it and moaned quietly. It had been so long since he'd had anything inside him... He recoiled from the feeling.
Dean jumped up from the floor. “FUCK YEAH!” He exclaimed, hugging his mate carefully. “Oh, my God, I’m going to be a dad!!”
Dean chuckles. “I love you too, sweetheart. C’mon, sleep. I’ll see those pretty blues when you wake up.”
Cas starts to sip and Dean tilts the glass so he wouldn’t drink too much too fast, Cas’ Adam apple bobbing as he greedily tries to down the water. Dean lets him drink a bit more than half, before putting it back aside, letting Cas lay back down on the cleaner side of the bed.
“Okay,” Dean echoes, pouring olive oil on his index, coating it generously before prodding at the furled muscle of Cas’ opening. Cas pushes back, hole fluttering. Dean’s never fucked a guy before. His pulse begins to quicken.
Most of the backyard is a garden Dean’s been watering religiously since his mom died but he’s focused on the shed that’s in the corner, in the outermost part of the backyard. The afternoon sun beats down on him, arms beginning to strain as he drags his father behind him, leaving a trail of flattened grass.
He’s immediately woken up by his alarm and his hand shoots out to shut it, wanting Cas to stay asleep. He disables all their alarms – sleep went by in a second and it’s four in the morning now.
Cas’ knuckles are as white as the sheets his hands are fisting. “Sir.” He turns his head again, burying it in the pillows, pushing his ass back as he wantonly moans. “Sir,” he repeats, muffled.
His eyes snap open, tilting his head slightly to the side to look at Dean from where he’s laying. He doesn’t stop touching himself, only smiles at Dean, shy as can be while putting on a show. He spreads his legs, between a come-hither.
“What if it’s my fault?” Dean thought aloud. “What if—what if I bit him too hard or something? What if I knotted him too hard?”
He pushes John’s unconscious body down the stairs, numb at the thud-thud-thud, then he’s back to dragging. He opens the door to the backyard. Drags.
“Only if you fuck me properly,” Cas mumbles, just raising his ass for Dean. Dean laughs, glances down to look at the way he disappears into Cas. Cas’ thighs are shaky and Dean runs one hand down to stroke over a thigh.
“Don’t you speak about your mother like that, Dean Winchester,” his father growls. Dean’s lips twist into a sneer. He was only saying the truth. “Don’t you look at me like that. I see how you look at that boy! I didn’t raise no fag.”
He shakes his head again and says, “Anyway. Thanks, Cas,” staring hard at their hands on the table, joined, the tender touch somehow exactly what Dean’s wanted since Cas had laid his bleeding hand on his shoulder in the bunker all those months ago. For that one instant, Dean had thought Cas might hug him or — or
Dean makes a choking sound and works his jaw, but nothing resembling words comes from his mouth. If Castiel didn’t know any better, he’d say Dean looks like he’s about to pass out.
He hears himself respond but he has no idea what words make it out of him; all Dean is aware of now is his pulse in his ears and the sick weight in his stomach as he backs off and beelines for his own bedroom.
But, thinking that perhaps it’s time to be bold, Dean bites his lip and sticks his hand in, hooking his index finger under the dragon’s body and drawing it slowly out of the cup. The dragon wakes as it feels itself being lifted, and tries to cling with its pinprick claws for a moment to the edge of the ceramic, but Dean gives a gentle tug and the dragon lets go. With a small smile, Dean lifts the dragon so they are eye to eye, cradling the lower half of its long body in one hand.
The month between their return from Purgatory and Castiel’s final journey into the Empty was filled with moments Castiel had considered, and ultimately dismissed, as the right moment to tell Dean the truest truths in his heart. Different moments, maybe, but Castiel convinced himself there were none better than the one he finally chose; it was for himself as well as for Dean to confess as he did, to spill open like ripe fruit full of promise, secure in the knowledge that the seeds they carry will fall to fertile soil and grow. To know happiness because the one person he loved beyond reason or measure knew how dear he was, to a creature never built for loving like
It is dark and frigid and endless as far as he can see, but as he comes through the gateway with a sickening lurch, like freeing himself from a vacuum, the sound that assaults his ears drives him to his knees.
“Like, it was kinda… beautiful, right?” Dean says without thinking, “Now that I’ve — seen him, I think I remember him coming to get me in Hell.”
Around him, the seething of the surface beneath his feet finally settled. It was, suddenly and unexpectedly, completely silent, the strange-yet-familiar background hiss falling away, muffled and then quelled like the whole of the Empty had been smothered. After an interminable amount of time with the steady stream of white noise, the silence felt infinitely more sinister. Castiel, wary, peered into the dark, searching in all directions, finding nothing until it occurred to him to look
Out of the numb emptiness creeping through his limbs, a sudden familiar sensation flows through Dean: of being held, close and warm, of being protected by an invisible something he can’t define but knows, somehow, down to the atoms that make him up. He wants to sink into it, let it carry him away into blissful oblivion, but it shifts around him. Instead of falling into a welcoming cloud of safety, he’s dragged forcefully back into consciousness.
He’s gone, and there’s no way to bring him back. They still don’t have a clue what happens to angels when they die. They don’t have souls. For all Dean knows, there’s nothing of Cas left to bring back, anyway.
Castiel straightens up and says, “There is no need to be crude, Sam,” just as Dean barks, “I told you to stay outta this, Sammy!” They look at each other and almost immediately burst into laughter. Maybe it’s more of the epic tension between them finding an outlet, but Dean and Castiel laugh so hard they’re both knuckling at the corners of their eyes and sliding down onto the floor, winded. Dean has no idea how fucking long it takes them to calm down to the occasional giggle.
, such as it is… he can’t bring himself to look at his unconscious human form again. He glances at Sam and sees his frown, contemplative rather than resigned.
Cas looks away, and Dean scoffs. “You were, weren’t you?” He shakes his head, frustrated. “So, what?” he demands, leaning back in his seat. “You get to say all that stuff to me, and then, what? You were gonna watch me suffer through a life without you in it?” Castiel looks at Dean sharply. “Don’t I get a say here?”
Eyes closed, Cas looks like he’s asleep, but rather than the rapturous expression he’d worn when Dean had seen him last, his typical exhaustion crowds around his eyes, draws the corners of his mouth into the more familiar frown. Dean shakes him, but Castiel only rolls bonelessly with the momentum from Dean’s hand. Feeling sick, shaken, Dean gathers Cas into his arms and holds on to him, face buried in Cas’ dark hair. Absurdly he realizes he’s always liked the way Cas’ hair smells.
. He lets the underwear roll out from his palm, his fingers catching in the elastic of the waistband, letting them hang loosely in his grip.
In the end, Castiel decides to take advantage of this alternative method of giving up his grace. He and Sam begin making plans to complete the spell that will cut him off from his angelic powers for good, staying up late into the night discussing the nuances of the cantrip and whether or not it would negatively effect the outcome if they substitute black pepper for the blackthorn.
Scooping Castiel up against his chest, Dean scratches a finger lightly between the dragon’s wings. He looks down into Cas’ face and smiles, dopey and soft. “C’mon, sweetheart,” he says, the endearment rolling off his tongue easy as pie. Dean is definitely too drunk to think about that right now. “Let’s get you to bed, huh?” In response, Cas leans his forepaws against Dean’s chest, stretches up long, and licks him gently on the chin. Dean smiles and scratches between Cas’ wings again, unthinkingly dropping a kiss to the top of Cas’ head.
. Liquid heat pools low in his belly, making him gasp and shake, louder and more fervently when Dean takes himself out as well and slides against Castiel, scorching hot, solid, slick.
Dean’s heart, almost torn in two, knits itself back together, consoled by the earnest, loving look on Castiel’s face.
“Be nice, Cas. Samantha’s gonna cry big fat girl tears if you don’t at least let him pet you once, and believe me, no one wants that.”
was anything to go by, Dean was certain his brother was going to corner him any second now and point out how Dean had been doing such a good job of hiding from him
Dean knows he’ll have to talk to Sam eventually, but if he has anything to say about it, it will only be when he’s backed into a corner and so drunk no one could blame him if he breaks down sobbing. Castiel’s absence in the car is already pressing on him; he can’t imagine how bad it’s going to be back at the bunker, seeing Castiel everywhere and knowing he’s never coming back.
Cas leans into the kiss, pushing Dean back until he falls onto his elbows, barely holding himself up on the table with his right foot dangling in mid-air. Cas slides the flat of his palm up Dean’s arm and slots his fingers over the unblemished cap of his left shoulder, where once the brand of his grace had marked Dean’s skin, and suddenly Dean is hurtling through space, supernovas stretching on for eons and flinging their life-giving star dust out into the cosmos. He sees the work of ages go on in a blink, the Earth forming and cooling and erupting and settling. A fish peeking out onto a beach. Life in all its varied proliferation. Crystal-clear streams and white waterfalls cascading down mountainsides. Night and day and dusk and dawn and the twilight of early evening. Himself, but… but a different version of himself, the best version of Dean there could be, bruised and tired, but still human, still good. And underneath and behind all of these flashes, woven in between them and holding them together in a shimmering web, there is a depth of feeling so profound Dean wouldn’t believe it was possible, except he can feel it, somehow, too.
to be looking right into the heart of him – and calling to him. Castiel could see Dean’s mouth form his name but no sound accompanied the motion; as he watched, Dean became increasingly frantic, his face a thundercloud as he shouted silently for Castiel, who could only look on with a growing doubt in his mind.
Taken in by these precious moments of freedom, Dean relaxed, left himself exposed. Intoxicated with the sounds and smells of the carnival, the rush of sugar bounding through his body, the sticky night air, Dean caught that look from Aaron and forgot about everything but the burning curiosity in his gut.
.” Didn’t stop him from doing it, though. From hoping. He swallows the memory. He does not like to think about what it felt like to mourn Castiel. They say people can’t remember pain, but Dean keeps the sorrow of Cas’ loss like a memorial in his deepest heart. “Look. I get it if you don’t — don’t want to stay here with Sam an’ me with Heaven open to you again, but — you couldn’t just… let me know you were — ?”
Another moment passes with them lost in thought before Dean adds, “I, uh, kinda suck at this, buddy.” Castiel huffs a laugh. “But maybe… maybe I sucked at it because it was expected of me.” Castiel hears the unspoken fear:
But Dean should have known better; coming home this long after curfew was a surefire way to put himself directly in John Winchester’s crosshairs.
Dean could be worthy of it. If he gets another chance. If Castiel hadn’t sacrificed himself, everything that he was, so Dean could go on living –
“Yeah, Sammy,” Dean answered, quiet and resigned. Sammy would be looking for reassurance, now, that Dean was okay. “You can come in.”
Castiel shrugs, a gesture so un-angel-like Dean needs to bite the inside of his cheek to keep from pointing it out. “It simply
But Cas’ icy stillness when Dean finally convinced himself to touch haunts him, reminds him that Cas left, just like everyone always leaves. Dean sat crumpled next to Cas in the dirt for who knows how long before he could bring himself to touch him, before he could convince himself to
“What happened to Amara,” Sam asks now, waving his hands in front of himself, clarifying, “when Chuck…?”
It’s the exact opposite of how Cas’ grace has always felt to Dean, though, he realizes, including half-remembered scraps of the dream of his rescue from Hell all those years ago. There is something comforting and familiar about seeing this other part of Cas — this real piece of him that is somehow both substantial and not. A sense of peace, of safety, washes over Dean, with the knowledge that Castiel once held him cradled against his incandescent heart.
He doesn’t know how long he’s been sitting in his car, baking, before he finally turns to the jar beside him, tucked carefully into a box on the passenger seat. A jar. Castiel, a goddamn
. He takes in a deep breath, fills his lungs with the cold night air and the sweet-grass, lightning-crackle smell of Castiel, and says, trembling, “Stay. Remember, Cas? You said you were gonna stay.”
– he could spend days going through all of the fucked up things he and Cas had survived. But they survived it. All of it, together. In fact, he’s pretty sure that the only reason they’re even still
— would have at least let Dean fill that aching, barren place inside him with something resembling peace. But
“Dad, you’re hurting me,” Dean protested, tugging on his arm and trying to loosen his father’s crushing grip. Fantastic. Dean could count on a few more bruises to sport tomorrow.
and the pleased look in Castiel’s eyes, but he at least manages to be polite. “Good to meet you, man.”
near-escape from death. It makes the headache beating against the inside of his skull throb even more vigorously.
and the way the air was full of the ticklish smell of daisies. He closes his eyes, pictures the blue sky. Imagines Cas, in Heaven, he guesses, sitting in the field next to him. They’re right next to each other, but Cas shimmers at the edges, ethereal and unreal – and of course, he isn’t real. But he sits and regards Dean solemnly all the same, kind, gentle, loving. He looks at Dean as though he is something precious and lifts his mouth in the smallest of smiles, still mostly telegraphed through the crinkles at the corner of his eyes.
Dean doesn’t say anything about this collection of treasures. They are as inexplicable to him as Castiel’s preference for his very plain, very functional coffee mug, but they are clearly just as important to the little creature. Dean’s touched, actually, that Cas seems to want to completely surround himself with… well, with
Frustrated and embarrassed, Castiel ducks his head and trades places with Charlie at the register again. Which does him exactly zero good, because instead of continuing on his journey to work, Dean marches right back into
“As you wish,” Cas finally tells him, and Dean is so relieved he nearly fucking faints. And then the words hit his brain, and —
“I prayed to you,” Dean interrupts, sudden, anger snapping back hot and making Dean’s insides shudder. Fuck making things
He’s reminded of how much Cas means to Sam, too, when he finds Sam in the library, already nose-deep in a pile of books on angel lore, instead of getting some hard-earned sleep. His long hair is damp, so he’d at least caught a shower, and Dean takes a minute to appreciate the way Sam can throw all of himself into solving a problem, doubly so when the happiness and well-being of his loved ones is at stake.
feel, all of the fucked-up beginnings and – temporary – endings of their relationship aside: Frustrated. Worried. Terrified.
and ugh, no thank you. He’s already got a bitch of a headache biting at the back of his neck. He glances back over to Sam and drums his fingers on his thighs, restless.
“It appears that while most of my grace is unattached, I do require sleep,” Castiel is saying as he takes the seat across from Dean. “But tonight I am finding it… difficult to do so.”
“No, no,” Sam hurries to say, holding up both hands in a placating gesture. “Cas is great. Castiel. I like it.” He looks down at the tiny face poking up out of Dean’s hoodie and addresses Cas directly. “It’s nice to meet you, Cas,” he says, very seriously, and Dean stares incredulously at his brother as he walks past him into the living room and dumps his backpack next to the couch. Dean looks down at Cas and sees him preening, hanging over the edge of Dean’s neckline and meticulously washing his face with his delicate claws, chirruping happily to himself.
His stomach is in freefall, plummeting without a chute as Castiel leans down over him and continues to kiss him stupid, plying Dean’s mouth open with his tongue; Dean’s brain goes offline when he unconsciously rolls his hips up against Cas, a sharp gasp bursting out of him when he gets some friction on his dick. It’s so good, Dean does it again, holding onto Cas’ shoulders and whimpering against his mouth, runaway libido forcing sounds from him he doesn’t know he’s ever made before, and Cas is practically
. Watching Cas’ face, he’s unable to stop himself from dragging a thumb across Castiel’s full lower lip. “I wanna — ”
“Hey, hey, I got you, Cas,” Dean says, low and soft. He takes Castiel’s hands, unexpectedly cold, and holds them between his own for a moment, kisses the very tips of his fingers. “I got you,” he repeats, and pulls Castiel’s hands up around his own neck, holding them there before sliding his hands down Castiel’s forearms and resting them lightly in the crook of his elbows. They lean into each other until their foreheads touch, eyes locked, breaths mingling in the scant space between them. He watches a tear slide down Castiel’s face and raises his hand to catch it, pushes his fingers into Castiel’s hair. Closes his eyes and just
Castiel reached out for Charlie, trying to keep her in her seat, but she didn’t listen. She left the lunchroom and went to look for Dean, who was alone for once. “Dean fucking Winchester, Castiel knows! And you’ve been BULLYING him? What’s going on?” She interrogated him in a halfway teasing tone. “Yeah, well, you don’t need to know the details. There’s things only he knows.”
“I didn’t think the car meant as much as it does to you. I will personally help you fix it. We can always find black paint or try to scrub this rainbow paint off.” Castiel offered kindly. He felt bad for agreeing to Gabe’s idea, even if the jock was a total douche to him. “Which would you prefer?” Castiel asked him.
Dean laughed at the mumbled speech. “You know Sammy, you’re right. But it’s a case and we’re going to solve it.” He turned up the classic rock on the radio station and pressed down on the gas as they got onto the highway. Finally, they reached a new town and pulled in front of a perfect white-picket-fence house.
Dean slyly snuggled up to him and snaked his arms around the smaller teen. Beneath him, Castiel felt so vulnerable. So innocent. Dean suddenly felt horrible for bringing him into all of this pain and trouble. “Yeah, right…” Dean thought allowed as Castiel shifted underneath him. He’d never be able to share this moment. But Castiel had only shifted so that their bodies fit into each other perfectly, like two spoons lying beside one another. The couch was only so big, though, and Dean worried one of them would fall off the side.
“Damn it, Charlie, will you shut up and listen?” Dean finally cracked. Charlie was honestly surprised the popular jock even knew her name. “Okay, go on but-”
“Y-yeah, you're right.” Castiel shook off the awkwardness he'd been overcome by and tried to relax under Dean's soft touch. “Would you like to follow me outside?” Dean noticed Castiel's nervous expression. “Obviously not to do anything.”
“Because, Sammy. I have to. But you don’t need to know the details. How’s it going with your soulmate?” Dean asked, not knowing the name. “I’m not telling him who I am.” Sam stated in a monotone voice. He frowned when he finished his sentence and Charlie looked concerned. “Why not? Same situation as Dean?”
Castiel wanted to smash a book into his face. Just to show him that he was real, and he wasn’t just hurting himself. Castiel felt the pain too, like he hadn’t before. It was as real as he was, but his soulmate surely didn't know that. Maybe Castiel should enlighten him.
“Cas, I was an absolute dick to you, especially with those jocks,” Dean commented sourly, “Why the hell are you accepting me? I’ve done nothing to earn that kindness.”
Dean coughed awkwardly and looked back at Michael. “Well, thank you, and don’t hesitate to shoot me a text if you need anything.” Dean told him, walking towards the door. He glanced at the knob and looked back, meeting Castiel’s eyes for the second time that day.
Castiel felt a drugs of energy fly through him as his eyes met his rescuers. Those eyes, they seemed so familiar!! Where had he seen them before? But Castiel didn't have time to say thank you. His rescuer laid him down in the grass with a cost wrapped warmly around him and ran.
Castiel stood upon a chair, growing flustered that he STILL couldn’t reach the spot he was supposed to hang the streamer. There was already a table set up for punch, presumably by his committed brother Michael, but other than that the entire gym was left without a single decoration. The worst part was that he only had a few hours to finish decorating before everyone started showing up to the dance.
“Well, then… I bully him because they all want me to. I just can’t take any more abuse, Charlie. At home, I’m ducking to save my hide and Sammy’s, and I’m not going to ruin the only safe place I have. Even if it means keeping Cas safe. I know it’s selfish, I know, but I never get a break! You just don’t understand what it’s like!”
Dean’s brother Sam would be home anytime. He’d gone for the first week of summer to Gabriel’s house and hadn’t remembered to text Dean once the entire time he was gone. Now that he’d be back, Dean knew he should probably clean the house up a little.
Castiel looked at the white board and wondered why anyone would ever want to do that many math problems. A few years back, everyone told him he should become a teacher and he’d just smiled, but now that he had gotten older he realized that he didn’t want anything to do with school for any longer than he had to. He enjoyed learning, that was true, but he surely didn’t like going to school and dealing with all the stress.
“Whoa, there, uhmm… I think you didn't get enough sleep last night or something. Why don't you just…” Dean smirked at his companion. “Why don't you just go kill yourself?”
“He's like my uncle.” Dean explained, wandering around to the clearing where he had saved Castiel's life. He smiled and sat underneath a tree in the snow, not caring one bit that it would make his pants wet or anything. Castiel did the same and leaned against the tree, shifting uncomfortably because of its sharp bark. Dean rolled his eyes in amusement and gently pushed Castiel against his chest.
Castiel knew they were in the same High School, because his wrists were always hot (which was an indication that they were physically close in location). But he didn’t know of anyone who had such artistic abilities. He wasn’t really friends with that crowd, anyways. Mostly he kept to himself, but sometimes he’d participate in student council meetings because his brothers made him tag along.
Castiel dropped the pen on his bed with a sickening thud into the cushion. What was he going to do?? 'I’m so sorry, I don’t know your name. What will you do now?'
Today the cut was deep, probably deeper than it had ever been. Castiel never thought a person was capable of undergoing that much pain. But he knew Dean's state of mind, he knew. It was reasonable considering what he'd seen and what he now knew.
Sam suddenly remembered a quote from a romance book he'd been forced to read by his friend Jess. He twisted the quote a little in his mind so he could apply it to the situation. Home isn't always a place; sometimes it's a person. And Dean's person was gone, which meant that he didn't have a home.
Dean hadn't been paying attention until his name had been spoken. “Err...uhm… yeah. Appreciate it. A lot.” He wasn't very convincing to any of the Novak brothers but he was too busy exploring the house to care. His immediate thought was why hadn't Castiel ever invited him to stay?
Still, Castiel’s soulmate was quite creative with the angelic touch. The fact remained that he couldn’t guess how his soulmate knew who he was and it would probably stay that way for quite some time. He watched the designs swirl around his fingers and his arms.
1. It is literally SO hard to not make them kiss yet. You don't even know how many times I have almost got ahead of myself by making them closer in circumstances. I usually have a strict plan that I stick to for my stories, but with this one I have changed and sculpted it as I go.
“You’re amazing, Cassie!” Gabriel screeched to him, shaking his shoulders. Castiel shrugged him off and leaned against the wall by the chairs of the auditorium. “Thanks, Gabe, but…”
“Seems like forever ago we were both here.” He laughed bitterly and looked upon the lake, watching as the moon reflected off the ice. Castiel took out the pen behind his ear and looked at his arm. He wrote the name DEAN WINCHESTER in small handwriting. He let the pen fall from his hands into the snow. Castiel linked their fingers together with a sad smile.
A/N: Hey, I know this one's kinda different than the others. There wasn't even a clue! Dean's too depressed for any of this right now. Chapter title, I wasn't sure, but it was inspired by Hamilton on the last song and I figured since both are depressing why not?? Anyways, I know you probably didn't enjoy the bit about Lisa but good things to come, maybe, hopefully? Guess!!
Castiel guessed about 20 minutes were left for lunch, so he decided to walk on the surface. That would’ve been plenty of time.
The brothers pulled up and got out of the car, somewhat eager to see the bodies found in the church. They straightened their jackets and briskly made their way inside.
“Yep. Listen, Sam, I care about your brother. I do. But I haven’t felt this good for twenty years. I ain’t leaving. He’s just goin’ through a phase. It’ll be over in a few days.” Bobby was growing even more irritated by the second. It didn’t seem important to him, but that was only because he wasn’t seeing what Sam saw. He couldn’t possibly understand, either, because he hadn’t been John’s son. He didn’t know what it was like.
'Exactly. My father doesn’t believe in /soulmates/. But he’s sort of a pervert. I’m expected to bring girls home. He knows you’re not a girl. That’s one of the reasons he doesn’t want me speaking to you. The other is more complicated.'
He stood from his chair, glaring at his other siblings who were allowed to do pretty much whatever they wanted to do, and tried to help. Michael, the oldest and according to their parents, the most important sibling was on a break from college. He was going to become some fancy big time engineer. Castiel did not like his elder brother very much.
“Sh! I don’t know how on Earth you figured this out, but know that you know you need to promise me you won’t say anything.”
Castiel didn't catch anyone's attention so he took a seat at the table beside Lucifer. He thought about trying to talk to his soulmate but he chose to go against it and keep his hands folded together. He couldn’t concentrate on anything, anyways, because a pair of green eyes haunted his thoughts.
He didn’t even feel the knife slide into his stomach he had become so numb. The rose dropped out of his fingers, falling into the snow. The rose was just as red as the blood that dripped onto the snow. Castiel’s eyes looked into Dean’s ones with pain and widened at Dean’s smirk. His vision slowly became more blurry until he couldn’t see a thing. Dean pulled the knife out of Castiel’s body, which fell to the ground with a sickening thud. He looked over it and swept it across his tongue, tasting the metallic blood of his soulmate.
“Do you- do you have anything to drink?” Dean asked quietly, hoping Uriel would know what he meant. He nodded and said, “you may visit the kitchen anytime, Dean. I only ask that you do not drink anything alcoholic.” Dean did not respond and dismissed the older Novak with the flick of his wrist.
Castiel didn’t expect a response, but when he got one, he couldn’t deny the butterflies in his stomach. I’m sorry, Cas. It’s the only way to take away the pain without leaving you.
'I need more clues. I can guess your name! I really do care! And you are more than you think you are.'
Dean stood above the book and began to speak the incantation. He doubted that it would work, but Sam had enough faith for the both of them. Suddenly the wind picked up and the brothers could hear the roof shingles clatter outside. The sigils burned brightly and with a loud CRACK! everything went silent. Dean shielded his eyes from the blinding light and when he opened them again, his eyes dawned upon the most beautiful creature he’d ever seen.
A/N: I decided to continue this story with a different plot, so I made a change to the end of the first chapter. The only letter Dean found was the one addressed to him.
Sam had tried to push the man away, but it looked like a child versus a truck. His efforts were taking them nowhere. “Don’t touch him!” Sam shouted. Dean’s eyes were both blackened, and Castiel wondered if any bruises would appear on him too. But they didn’t. For some reason, it was only the cuts.  The man pulled Dean up by his arms and spat on his cheek. He didn’t say anything, which as an onlooker, was the scariest part.
His head bobbed forward and he felt a warm hand touch his cheek gently. His eyes were frozen shut but he wished he could open them. He wanted to see who had been inches away from his face.
A/N:Welcome back, hunters and angels! It means so much to me that you've decided to continue reading. How'd you like this chapter? Kudos? XD What do you think the next riddle will be? Comment your ideas, questions, tips, etc!
Sam nodded respectfully. “Okay, Dean. I’ll come with you.” He opened the door slightly more and Dean saw Gabriel down the hall, eagerly waiting for his soulmate to return for a much-deserved cuddle session.
“Alright. Well, I'd like to talk about a few things,”  Castiel began confidently. “ Firstly, I’m sort of confused. You hunt monsters?”
“Peace out, bitches!” Charlie gave her signature sign and left the Impala, leaving Sam and Dean to drive back home where he could guarantee they wouldn’t be greeted with a smile.
It was yet another day, and the first thing Castiel noticed was the deepest mark of red he’d ever seen in his life on his arm. Dean must’ve- his soulmate must’ve done it again. It’d make sense for Dean Winchester to do it, totally…. It makes PERFECT FUCKING SENSE. Castiel wiped his sleepy eyes and looked at the mark again. He’s perfect, he’s popular, and he’s got it all. Who knows what lies he’s been feeding Castiel, if it even is him?
Jess, nurse and Sam's first mate, went forward and shooed all of them away. “I’ll handle it, don’t worry.” As the rest began to back off, she glared at Dean, too, who was comforting Cas with worried strokes to his hair and back. “You too, Dean. You’re hovering.”
Cas mewls and he’s still with Dean, although hazy and mind probably empty. “Mouth, sir?” He murmurs, turning his head again to glance up at Dean in the corner of his eyes, vivid blues glossed over. Dean barely hears him.
It was silent for a while. When Dean understood Cas wasn’t saying anything, he prompted, “Diagnosis, chief?”
Dean would have thought this would be more frantic and rushed. His dad’s a few feet away locked and passed out in a shed. He’s fucking Cas but he could call it making love.
Dean doesn’t tell him that it’s going to be okay, that he’ll be fine and this will pass. It will never be okay. Instead, he says, “I’m with you the whole time, Cas. Breath.”
Cas bumps him back with his ass a little and Dean laughs again as he pull away, just a bit. “’Kay, geez, moving now.” Dean’s fond of Cas.
“Insatiable slut.” Dean laughs, straightening back up as he feels his orgasm coil hot and heavy beneath his abdomen, Cas helpfully squeezing around him, tongue retreating back in his open mouth.
Dean sighed. His omega wasn’t going to say anything and Dean wasn’t going to force him. “At least you’re alright, right?” Dean asked. Castiel nodded, cheeks still a pleasant shade of pink. “Just bad food or something?”
“We don’t have to fuck. Shit, sorry.” Dean raises his head to look at Cas. “I just. This is okay. Kissing.”
Cas glared at him. “You know what I mean.” Dean just grinned and climbed on top of Castiel who welcomed him with open arms. Castiel sighed and wrapped his affectionate alpha up in his arms, carding fingers through his hair as Dean rested his head on Castiel’s chest, eyes slipping shut at the steady rhythm of a heartbeat.
Castiel became extremely confused. He had to admit, Lisa Bradbury was actually really nice to everyone. She was just too clingy and dependent, especially on Dean Winchester. “And we don’t like her because she /should/ be mean?”
“Dean Winchester? What makes you think that?” Charlie asked slyly, unlocking her phone. She began typing, not showing him as she did so, and then put her phone in her pocket. “Well, I don’t really want to think about it. I’m trying to pretend it isn’t true.” Castiel admitted shyly, crossing one leg over the other. He looked down at his plate of food, left untouched by him.
Dean lit a cigarette. He ignored the look on his cousin's face, who wanted to do the same. He inhaled the stimulant, then blew out the smoke, looking ahead. It seemed to him that something was wrong. The crows had ceased to make their presence known. There was a shrill silence which no one could control. The man slowly looked around. He did not see anything unusual. There were still bushes growing by the old, rusty fence. Individual blades of grass protruded from the spaces between the paving stones. The local squirrels had not left the trees, and the garage door still remained closed. However, something had changed. Dean got up from his chair. With a slow step, he stepped off the porch and made his way towards the gate. Without changing pace, he waited. He was looking out for the unexpected when he saw it.
Castiel watched the man and had no idea how he might act. Swallowing the lump that was forming in his throat, he wandered his eyes from the man's face to his crotch. He was experiencing an internal battle: a voice in his head was telling him that this was wrong, inappropriate and forbidden. Castiel had never thought of any man this way. He was brought up by his parents, who said a prayer before dinner and took him to Sunday Mass every week. He grew up believing that being gay was wrong and took away the privilege of going to heaven. Castiel was afraid to be different from his family. He was afraid that he might be liked. But in that moment, as he watched Dean touching his crotch and taking great pleasure in it - he wanted to join him. He could feel himself starting to run out of space in his trousers. He felt excitement mixed with fear. He felt everything he shouldn't.
"And apparently I am the one who gets involved in everything." She rolled her eyes, crossing her arms over her chest."
"Get ready," he whispered directly into Dean's ear, then ordered him to turn around. Performing this action slowly, the blonde man couldn't help but wonder what it would be like. The very vision that Castiel could make him his sex toy excited him. When it came down to it, honour or personal dignity had no place. Because the truth was one and undeniable: Dean only wanted to be fucked that afternoon and he wasn't even sorry. He didn't think about Sam  (fortunately, one could say), he didn't agonise over his death, and the blood he was smeared with looked proud, like a military decoration.
His heart was beating fast. It seemed to him that it was he who was about to end his wanderings in this world, not Sam. He feared that with every passing second the gods were heaping more misfortune and deprivation on him because of his corpse. Dean held in his hand, placed behind his back, that which could help him. Taking a deep breath, he made his choice. And although the sound Sam made, signalling endless pain and the fear of death, terrified him - he did not want to take one step back. With the knife piercing the man's flesh, he felt a surge of new strength that would take him to new heights. Confidence filled him. Seeing only good in his actions, he slowly drew his dagger to strike another deep and deadly blow into the body of his brother. At that moment, he no longer heard human suffering and helpless pleading for help. He had before his eyes the opening of the gates to the favour of the gods and he did not intend to disregard this path.
The next morning Castiel was awakened by the sound of plates being smashed. The man groaned quietly, then tucked his head into his pillow. He didn't want or intend to leave his bed tonight. He had worked hard all week, making it necessary for him to get up in the middle of the night. Saturday and Sunday were two days when he could just lie on his stomach and enjoy the comfort of silence. And once he really thought that living with a teenage daughter would give him much more comfort and freedom than with a baby who cried every now and then. Perhaps his life would have been like that if years ago he hadn't married Dean, the man who completely changed Claire's taste in music. Back then, every morning when everyone was getting ready, you could hear the sounds of classic rock, a teenage girl combing her hair, and a grown man pretending to play the guitar. After so long, Castiel still wasn't used to it.
It was Charlie's favourite time of the day. A time when the sky turned even more red than before. When she finished her work, she stopped being responsible for other people and could rest. She spent this time thinking and regenerating. Only occasionally did she light a cigarette and try to fill her lungs with deadly substances. No one accompanied her. The rest of the relatives spent their time at home or in the orchard - among the apple and pear trees. They had their own affairs and problems that they did not want to burden her with. She was glad about that - she did not want to search for solutions and worry. That afternoon, however, she found herself unexpected company.
"And you're just going to go there like that!" Dean raised his voice, watching his daughter in disbelief.
Castiel tightened his hands on Dean's hips. Neither of them cared if they left any marks on their bodies. For the time being, Castiel was the active one. He had already decorated his partner with a multitude of hickeys and fingerprint marks. It promised that the canvas that was Dean's body was going to be filled today in an act of artistry that he loved. And Castiel wasted no time in showing him how much he loved art. Because when he managed to insert his cock all the way into Dean's pink, wet hole, Dean could feel the intensity suddenly increase. The blone was desiring him. Without mercy he was taking it out and inserting it, constantly changing pace. One minute his movements were gentle and affectionate, the next he was grabbing Dean's hair with one hand and making him his toy. Dean made no secret of it: he was delighted. When once again a loud moan escaped his lips, he moved away from the wall a little, making Castiel duplicate his movements and bend down. His ass was in the air, with him carefully getting down on his knees. His partner found herself on his knees a moment later. Without wasting any second given to them, he continued his work, leaving Dean to merely illustrate his sensations. He desired him to moan continuously. Each time his cock caressed the man's prostate. As he increased his grip on his body and simply fucked him to the best of his ability. Castiel needed this to be able to satiate himself.
