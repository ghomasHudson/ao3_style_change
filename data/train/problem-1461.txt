“Oh, eight. No, wait, seven” he replied, not looking up from where he was examining the left arm of the skeleton.
“I’d think you would be grateful for the quiet. You know, after....” Mike looked meaningfully at him and John hurried to cut off his words.
“Do you know who might have wanted to kill him?” John slipped the question into the growing silence.
John ended up making tea for everyone. Half the team was standing because Sherlock had sprawled himself across the majority of the bench, looking like some kind of supine Greek God in repose. Sherlock had been right about the timing of the arrival of the police. It was twenty minutes before two doubtful looking constables arrived. They quickened their pace as soon as they were shown to the body, rushing back to their car to radio it in.
“John! Come here.” He gave in a ‘come hither’ gesture before rushing back outside. John turned to Jordí who just shrugged at him. He looked over to where Phil was standing in the corner to see if he had an objection. Phil was too busy chewing on his nails and looking anxious to even notice that Sherlock had come back inside. Sighing wearily, John got to his feet and followed Sherlock outside.
“The whole site is a crime scene” said Sarah. “Don’t smoke anywhere. I’m going to tell the others to stay in the hut whilst we wait for the police. Don’t go anywhere.” She stalked off towards the break hut where the others were beginning to come out to see what was happening.
“Oh hey John” she didn’t look up, instead grimly picking up a shot glass in each hand before slamming them both down.” She nodded at David. “Your turn.” He sighed.
“We were thinking of hitting the pub after this, want to come?”, Jess asked, turning to John. He yawned, suddenly so exhausted he could hardly keep his eyes open.
Jordí smiled at her, “Yes, I was being melodramatic. This morning David could not find his work shoes, and, oh, the noise that he made about it. They mysteriously vanished in the night, poof, gone. So, we search and do not find them. David, he is very angry. And then I arrive here and there is a dead person. It is very dramatic. But the dead person is obviously more important.”
As they both petted the excited dog a cry of “Oh no!” came from the cabin. John limped inside, leaning on the doorframe to steady himself a little. He was still feeling a bit wobbly after spending so many hours sleeping over the weekend. Inside he found Molly looking down at her high vis vest with an expression of dismay.
When John got back to his house, his housemate still hadn’t gotten back. He had the bathroom all to himself, and made use of his opportunity by taking a long hot shower. For once he didn’t have to worry about conserving the hot water for someone else. It was Friday, so everyone was meeting at the pub later. He thought it was worth popping in to see if anyone knew anything about the new archaeologist. Maybe the man himself would even be there. Smiling, John reached up for the shampoo, thinking that he might as well make himself as presentable as possible, just in case.
After the discovery of a human bone on their site, things got a lot more serious and professional. The next day two cabins, more equipment, and (most important to John) a port-a-loo, were delivered. Philip was beside himself with excitement about the find. As soon as he’d been told about Ines finding a bone he’d rushed over and taken over the excavation. He continued to insist that he should be the only one to excavate it. Ines was not impressed. As soon as Philip was out of earshot she complained to John, “I have a Masters in archaeology from Uppsala University. This is well within my expertise, but no, he” here she glared darkly in Philip’s direction “has to take over as soon as something fun is found. When it’s only mud he is in his car, but now” she trailed off, gesturing helplessly. John made sympathetic noises. Ines continued “And Molly over there”, here she gestured towards the pale, dark-haired woman working quietly next to them, “She has an MSc in Osteoarchaeology.”
“Yes I am!” John was indignant. He’d been working the damn site for ages now. He might not have a degree in it, but spending a month on his knees doing the work had to count for something.
Sherlock snorted, “He already knows that John. Obvious. Look at his eyes, he’s been crying. And he’s wearing yesterday’s clothes. They’re all rumpled. He just picked them up off the floor and put them back on this morning. He didn’t feel up to finding fresh ones.” He paused and sniffed again “Or showering.”
Monday dawned bright and sunny for once. The leaves on the trees were changing colours and the yellow and orange against the bright blue sky made the work site actually look beautiful for once. John approached the break cabin, as he needed to pick up his high vis vest and his trowel. Betty, the farmer’s dog, ran up to him with her whole back half wiggling in joy.
“What do you think you’re doing?” Sherlock replied. “No, wait, don’t tell me. I bet you’re Dr. Anderson aren’t you? Obvious. Tell me, were they handing out the PhDs free with tins of biscuits on the day you popped into the university? Or do they award them to anyone who can hold a pen these days?” He paused, then leaned a bit closer - staring at Philip with what appeared to be disgust on his face “At least, I’m assuming you can hold a pen, but then again judging by the illegibility on these,” here he gestured towards the papers clutched in Philip’s arms, “quite apart from the utter idiocy contained within, perhaps not.” At this he looked away from Philip, dismissing him entirely, as he spotted Sarah, standing next to Molly a little further away.
at this rate.” He looked up at down the street and then started walking briskly towards the pub again. This time when they got there it was open. The day had turned out to be a cool one, but inside the pub it was stiflingly warm. There were no less than two fires blazing away in grates at opposite ends of the long saloon. As Sherlock approached the bar he loosened the scarf around his neck. John undid the buttons at the front of his coat, and contemplated taking it off altogether. Behind the bar a bored looking woman was slumped. She was large set (
“And as well as that you’ve clearly been recently injured, quite severely, if the tremor in your leg and hand are anything to go by.” At this John clenched his left hand. Betrayed by his body yet again, he should have guessed.
“Library’s this way,” said John pointing in the opposite direction to the one Sherlock was going in. Sherlock span around with a huff of annoyance.
“So, we had a consultant come to the site today.” John broached the topic after taking a sip of his ale.
“Oh, that’s how he refers to them, as cases, or mysteries. Like a detective novel written in the 1930s or something. He’s mad. Brilliant, but quite insane.”
John sighed, “You’re going to destroy your liver this way Jess. Can’t you just argue your case with words.”
John and Sarah worked together on uncovering more of the skeleton until lunch time. Then Sarah asked Olle and Tony to take over. By the end of the day every member of the team had had a chance to uncover some of the only find on the site. Although everyone had been patiently troweling the site, nothing else had been found so far. Philip thought he might have discovered the outer edge of a settlement and had ordered John and Molly to dig a five by five trench. They hadn’t found anything. The skeleton meanwhile was nearly entirely uncovered now. Walking by on his way to retrieve the wheelbarrow John could see that a couple of major bones still seemed to be missing. Sarah was standing frowning down at the skeleton. She’d called Philip over to her. “It looks strange” she said to Philip. Looking up she saw John standing nearby, and called him over. “John, come look at this” Philip rolled his eyes. John stepped closer. “It doesn’t fit for a burial, but it still looks posed to me. See the angle of her right arm? I’m not sure what to make of it.”
It took John about forty-five minutes to get home. It wasn’t far from the centre of town, but he had to keep sitting down and having small rests. By the time he made it home he was hot, embarrassed and in a foul mood. He crashed his way in through the back door and found Jess sitting at the kitchen table drinking tea with Jordí, David and Tony.
“Call me if you find any discolouration,” he’d shouted as he disappeared towards his car once more. After an hour of troweling John uncovered a circle of mud that he thought might be a slightly different shade so he went and got Philip who explained the next step.
Ines looked scornfully at John, “It probably is not. If we were in Sweden it would be a burial, with gold. But here, probably not. I think it will turn out to be an old horse.”
He didn’t even know where he was going with this any more. He felt a proper fool. Sherlock hummed noncommittally and turned back to the lock. He fiddled a bit more with two of his picks, made a triumphant noise, stood up and opened the door.
“John! Where have you been? We were just talking about you,” Jess said looking up at him as he made his inelegant entrance.
This had to be one the most tiring jobs he’d ever had, John thought to himself the next day, as he wearily climbed out of Mike’s jeep. Every muscle ached. Muscles he didn’t even know he had ached. Objectively, he knew that it couldn’t be harder than army training, or the many sleepless nights he’d spent as a trainee doctor, but somehow he felt worse now than he had then. Of course, he was older now than he had been then. That was not much comfort. He felt old and useless, his body failing him at every step.
“Yes. And? I didn’t need you to wake me up at one in the morning to tell me things I already know. How did you even get in here?”
In the light of day it did seem a little unlikely that he’d been roaming the town, breaking into undertakers and the like. He’d just resigned himself to the likelihood that his night-time subconscious had a strong imagination with a sprinkling of wish fulfilment when he rounded the corner into the kitchen to find Jess pouring out cereal and Sherlock Holmes sitting on their kitchen counter drinking from a mug.
I can't apologise enough for the delay in publishing this chapter. I've been ridiculously unwell. This fic is NOT abandoned. Worry not. Updates will not continue - at least one chapter per month from now on.
John shook his head and picked up his pint again. Sherlock probably wasn’t going to come to the pub. But hopefully he’d be back on the site on Monday. The test results for the bone and soil samples wouldn’t be ready for at least a week. He just wanted the chance to talk to him some more.
“Oh, yes please” John replied, as he got to his feet, with difficulty. They went over together to where Sherlock was kneeling.
As if reading his mind Sherlock answered the unasked question. “Obvious. You only had to look at the stains around the bed and nightstand. Cleaners in these smaller hotels always miss those areas - not enough time to thoroughly clean the rooms when there are only two of you and a fast turn around.”
Molly blushed “Is that the new specialist? No one has introduced us yet. I spent all day putting supports up in the trench. I don’t think he’s still here.” John was disappointed, Sherlock was easily the most interesting thing to have happened for a while. He was fascinating, and John had wanted to talk with him more about cannibalistic prehistoric Britons.
Sherlock snorted with amusement “Bit mundane for someone like you. No - definitely army. The way you’re standing now clearly says you’ve had military training. Not to mention the way that you rushed over here to confront me when you thought I was up to no good.” He paused. “There’s something else, I’m not quite sure what it is yet,” at this he cocked his head to the side, “Interesting” he murmured, half to himself.
Ines tutted, dismissing him. Everyone knew he didn’t have an archaeology degree. As far as they were aware, he didn’t have any degree at all.
John couldn’t quite work out what Sherlock’s methods were. Unlike the other archaeologists he didn’t seem to be sketching or recording the skeleton. He started by standing and staring at it for a full hour, not moving except to rub his hands vigorously through his hair every ten minutes or so. Then, he took off and started pacing around the site, muttering to himself.
“It’ll take the police at least 15 minutes to get here, but still, best to gather the evidence as quickly as we can.” Putting his phone away he started feeling around the edges of the body’s head.
John sighed. He knew he should still be angry. It wasn't normal. He should find it creepy that this man climbed a trellis to his bedroom at one in the morning to ask him if he wanted to go look at a corpse. But for some reason he didn’t. He found it slightly charming in a way that he instantly decided not to examine more closely.
“Ha. Yeah, he likes to call himself that. He’s self employed. Doesn’t work for a university, or a company or anything. Forensic archaeology is an actual thing, they’ve started teaching it in universities over here now. Probably started in the U.S.. Forensic archaeologists use archaeological principles and techniques for the location, recovery, and interpretation of evidence for past events. All within the criminal justice system. Missing persons, human rights and mass disasters. You’ve heard of Susan Black?”
Two weeks later and they finally had some more equipment. They’d actually been given one new shovel, a trowel each, and excitement upon excitement, some steel toed boots each (this last a legal requirement which had taken ages to arrive). It was still only the four of them though there were rumours that more staff would be arriving that afternoon. John wondered how the town survived when there were no archaeologists there. Who normally rented all these houses and flats? By his count the company now had twenty people in the town, with the extras due to arrive, that represented a significant increase to the small town’s population.
“I’m the senior archaeologist on the site. I don’t know how things are done in Spain” this last word was uttered with clear derision in his voice. “But here that’s how things are done. Finds are excavated in order of seniority. Which is why Johnny there will most likely be spending the next six months digging up as many tree roots as his heart desires.”
John didn’t know what to say to this so chose to say nothing, and just headed over to the kettle to make himself some tea. He was limping badly by this point. Jess got to her feet and came over, taking the mug from his hands. “Go sit down at the table. I’ll make you some tea.”
Molly turned her tear-stained face in his direction. “I was so excited about this dig. It’s my first paid job since uni. I don’t understand why everyone is so mean.”
She moaned, “But this is funnier. Their little faces when I beat them. It’s precious to crush their masculinity this way.” David returned at this point holding two pints of Guinness. Jess groaned, but reached for hers. John decided to leave them to it. He didn’t think he could watch his housemate get completely sloshed again. David was pretty big so it would probably take her a while to break him. He had no doubt that she would, she always did. He looked around the watching archaeologists who were chatting amongst themselves, whilst keeping half an eye on the drinking action happening at the table. Everyone there was from the first site, he didn’t know them that well so he rethought his plan about asking around about Sherlock straight away. He got up and went to the bar instead. He ordered a pint of ale and then sat at one of the bar stools and watched the football as he drank his drink.
John felt his spine straighten in annoyance at that. “Yes, you said. I mean, what are you? I mean, what are you doing here exactly? Are you from the road?”
“Bloody hell. Yeah, I know him. We hired him back in Dublin, when we found that child and horse skeleton together. You must have something really interesting if he’s accepted the case.”
It was a cold day, slightly misty around the trees in the distance. The dew had made the grass moist and John squelched as he tramped his way across the farmyard heading towards the site. As he crested the hill leading down to the site he paused. He wasn’t alone. Ahead of him in the middle of the cleared field a figure was crouched down. John paused. It didn’t look like Philip, or any of the other archaeologists. For one thing it wasn’t wearing a high-vis jacket, or the distinctively bright rain jackets the archaeologists favoured. From here all John could make out was black. Suddenly a thought struck him. Sarah had mentioned disgruntled road executives. Maybe one of them had found out about their find and was here to sabotage it. Maybe even destroy it? Hurriedly he started walking again, picking up his pace until he was lightly jogging down the hill.
Molly hadn’t gone far. She was leaning her forehead on the wall of the corrugated hut, trying to calm her breathing. She was angrily wiping at her eyes, as if angry with her own weaknesses. John approached her carefully. He held out his high vis vest. “Here,” he said “take mine. I’ll take yours. Ignore Tony. People don’t hate you, he’s just an idiot.”
“Yeah yeah. Quiet is...good. It’s all good. Fine. You know. Fine.” Mutinously his brain supplied the thought that it wasn’t fine at all. He did his best to ignore it and went back to the important job of drinking his pint. Whoever said that you couldn't drown your sorrows in alcohol had obviously not met the Watsons, John thought grimly to himself.
Sherlock raised himself into a sitting position, “You’d be best talking with me first. I noticed one or two things of interest.”
What John hadn’t realised when he’d first been told about the vacancy for an archaeological assistant by a friend was that were two distinct types of archaeology. One was academic archaeology. These were kind of digs that he’d dreamt about as a sad and neglected child. The other was commercial archaeology.
As it turned out, Sherlock’s meeting with the rest of the team was even more amusing than John had hoped for. Everyone arrived together in the normal minivan. John could hear them talking to each other as they approached the site over the hill. He’d gone into the finds hut to finish off his paperwork, as he’d originally meant to that morning. Sherlock had decided that he needed to read the reports written so far on the skeleton. On finding the door to the office locked, he’d pulled a full set of picks out of one of his seemingly bottomless pockets and immediately set about opening it. That had been an hour ago, and John hadn’t seen him since. When he heard the approaching voices, John stepped out of the finds hut to watch the archaeologists making their way onto the site. He clocked the exact moment that Philip spotted that the door to his office was open. He broke away from the rest of the group immediately and rushed towards it. Before he could get there though, Sherlock emerged, coat billowing around him with a loud cry of “Rubbish!” He had paper clutched in both hands, and as Philip paused in shock, he threw them to either side of him in the most perfect expression of exasperation John had ever seen.
“Nothing in the bathroom either. Let’s go. There obviously isn’t anything else here. Let’s go and find the ex-boyfriend. He’ll have more information for us.”
John wondered if he needed to intervene. Sherlock was leaning over the poor man in a fairly threatening manner. When Sherlock started sniffing at Anthony’s hair John decided that yup, he really should intervene.
The surveying was dull. It was a two man job but with each person always at a fair distance from each other it wasn’t conducive to chatting. By the end of the day John was aching and bored. As the group waited for the mini-van he made his way towards Molly. She was standing apart from the others, fiddling with the toggles on her wooly hat, a nervous habit she had.
Going slowly and carefully with both trowel and brush, Philip uncovered more of the skeleton as the day progressed. Once he found the skull it was clear to everyone that it was human. Just as Philip had finished cleaning off the cranium the skies opened and it started raining heavily again. Shouting for help, Philip rushed to cover the find with some blue tarpaulin. John ran over to help him and together they secured the tarp with rocks. Once covered they ran through the rain to the break cabin where everyone else was sheltering. Once inside John shrugged off his coat and went to help himself to tea. There was nothing to do but wait for the rain to stop. Philip was buzzing with excitement.
John could tell that Philip was not pleased at this development. More people meant that the chances of him getting solo time with the skeleton were diminishing. “Are you sure that’s necessary?” he whinged. Sarah gave him a look and didn’t answer, instead standing up and brushing the dirt from her knees. She pulled her mobile from her coat pocket, searching for the contact as she turned her back to them and started to walk towards the hut. John looked down at the bones and then back to Philip. He raised one eyebrow at Philip. “Oh, shut up” said Philip, as he got to his own feet and strode back towards the car park. Both supervisors had left without telling John what to do next, so he pulled the plastic tarp back over where it could cover the skeleton, secured it with a few rocks and then limped over to where Molly was struggling to lift some buckets of mud. He’d completely forgotten that he was supposed to be getting the wheelbarrow. Feeling guilty, he went back for it. Together he and Molly spent the rest of the daylight wheelbarrowing the discarded mud away.
“No. I was busy. As you well know” said Sherlock, his voice deep and slightly gravelly. Jess choked on her mouthful of cereal. Sherlock ignored this and carried on.
“Excellent John. That’s really very good.” Sarah looked at him more closely, “This is really your first dig?”
Sarah shrugged, “I’ve not worked with him before, but he’s the best at this sort of thing. Just leave him alone. Why don't you go and help Molly with that trench?”
John was glad that he didn’t live with David. From what Jordí told them it seemed that he was always blowing up over something. They all sat around in silence for what seemed to be forever, but was probably only fifteen minutes. John was about to offer to make more tea when D.I. Tomlinson reappeared in the doorway. “I’d like to speak to you now Dr. Beachman,” she said. Sarah got to her feet and followed the D.I. out of the cabin. John had just opened his mouth to suggest tea when Sherlock breezed back in.
“Don’t forget to look for bone markings on the radius” he muttered “Professor Strand at the Somerset site said that often shows signs of deliberate marking and gnawing.” As he turned away he heard Sherlock’s exclamation of glee and Philip’s snort of derision. John smiled to himself.
John straightened his shoulders. “So, that’s it? You just looked at the way I stand and, what, deduced my work history?”
“I can’t wait until the others get here then” said John handing over one of the mugs to Sherlock “I couldn’t find any milk that didn’t smell awful, so I put in two extra sugars instead. Sherlock smiled, accepting the tea.
After two hours of standing under the trees, Philip decided they should get back to work. It hadn’t stopped raining, but he was fidgety, obviously nervous that one of the bosses might come by and spot his team not working to the full. John pulled his hood back up over his head and tried to tie the toggles under his chin, best he could. It was mostly pointless. His jacket had started leaking sometime into the third hour in the morning.
John was on his knees troweling a new section in the East corner of the site when he heard footsteps approaching him from behind.
“Does Northlew even have a hotel?” John asked. Molly shrugged, her eyes on the minivan that had just pulled into the drive. “I don’t know. I can’t wait to get home, warm up in a shower and have a cup of tea. Honestly, it’s all I’ve been thinking of for the past two hours.” John nodded. Normally that’s what would be filling his head by this time of day, but now his thoughts were all focused on the man he had met that morning.
The rules were stupid, thought John. Each person took turns deciding what to drink for each round. Their competitor then had to drink the same. Whoever threw up, or passed out first was the loser. David drank the shots, groaning, before getting to his feet and heading unsteadily towards the bar. “Okay, this time I’m getting something large and we are taking our time drinking it.” he said. At least this time it was only the two of them. John pulled up a chair and sat next to Jess. “So, what started it this time?” He looked at his watch “It’s only 6.30 Jess.” Jess rolled her eyes before resting her head on her arms. “He said that feminists have nothing to complain about because the queen is a woman. It was either punch him or challenge him to a drinking competition. For the honour of all women everywhere, John. I had to do it.”
“Yes, I know” replied Sarah, still smiling, but slightly strained now, “That’s why I think it would be good for him to get some first hand experience, with me helping him - to show him what’s important.” Philip turned pink at this and muttered something that John was sure was not complimentary under his breath. John felt his heart lifting just a little. Maybe tomorrow held some hope after all. Maybe it wouldn’t be filled with the endless monotony of troweling only mud. At the very least it was going to infuriate Philip to see him near the find, and that was something at least.
“How many black men do you think live in Devon? How many gay men? What do you think my life is like here standing out like I do every day? And then James goes and pulls shit like this. He cheated on me. With a woman. I don’t care that it was a woman. Woman, man, it’s still cheating. But then he made it worse by expecting me to
“I don’t know. He said he’d met her on Tinder. And that was another thing. He’d set up a profile on Tinder for goodness sake.”
John handed his phone over and watched as Sherlock’s fingers flew over the surface. “It’ll be here in about five minutes. Let’s go up the lane and meet it.” Sherlock wasn’t looking at John. He’d turned away and started walking to the site exit. John pulled him by the sleeve.
and find out who killed that man?” John looked into Sherlock’s blue, green eyes, and felt a thrill of excitement for the first time in a long time. He didn’t know why Sherlock wanted him to come into town with him. All he knew was that he wanted to go with him. John straightened up and walked decisively towards the site exit and the road beyond.
“Right, as this is potentially an important find, it’s a great chance for everyone to get a chance to learn what a burial looks like” Sarah said, smiling at them all as they sat clustered around her in the break cabin. “So, for the rest of today I want Ines and Jordí to draw and photograph the skeleton, before any more of it is excavated. For now, everyone else can keep troweling the rest of the site. Tomorrow morning I want you, John, was it?” She smiled at him. Dumbfounded, John nodded. “Yes, John, I want you to help me in the morning with excavating more of the skeleton.”
I have packed up that which I would be distressed to lose to the elements, and will be travelling now to the nearby city of ---- to spend the winter. I intend to work as a physician or barber, or, failing that, a labourer or porter. My body is strong as it ever was - stronger, perhaps -  and I am willing to seek my fortune for a time amongst the towns nearby. I will leave this journal well hidden in my cottage. I can no longer bear to think of burning it.
Moriarty offered me the chance to join him in his life and criminal endeavours; I naturally refused. Our entire conversation was agreed to be a foregone conclusion. We traded barbs and threats, and it seemed as though he would leave as suddenly as he had come, and our deadly adversarial dance would continue. He was the cobra, I the mongoose; natural enemies in unnatural clothing.
I begin this journal with a mixture of anticipation and dread, as I expect it shall serve as my only company in the coming years. Although I am certainly much inclined toward solitude after all that I have seen, and - I shall be fully plain since this journal shall be seen my none by mine own eyes -  suffered during my years of service in the King’s regiments.
I did not tell you this when I recounted our meeting, but before he left, Moriarty offered his hand to me, asking that we greet each other properly, for our duel was about to begin. And as I am an arrogant and vainglorious man, I took it.
I do not recall every particular of the dream. I remember the taste of grass, and mushrooms, and summer. I remember a vivid moment of finding myself with my nose pressed to the inner joining of his thigh, himself entirely buried in my throat to the very root, just as I was in turn in his mouth. I remember tongues, slippery-wet and tasting of silt and sky. I remember wool under my fingers and the feeling of fine paper as I gripped the globes of his arse. I do not remember any words spoken between us, nor of any moment of departure. I remember only pleasure and the sensation of strength and life flowing into me. I slept deeply and well at long last.
If there is any justice in the world, I hope with every fibre of my being that it was quick and that she did not suffer. I have it on good authority that modern air rifles are powerful indeed, and that Colonel Moran is very skilled in his despicable pursuits. Certainly, I did not read any sensationalist nonsense in the newssheets. Merely that a woman in countermourning was shot dead as she dozed beside her own fireplace, and that the police had no suspects.
There are few places in England where a soldier's pension will permit one to live in as much comfort as a man can hope for, so I have returned to Scotland, where the land is wilder but the livings are to be secured far more affordably. I expect that this cottage, deep in the Gramalchladdich Wood, will sustain me as well as can be hoped. The solicitor implied that it was a family’s living not fifty years ago, but it is most inconveniently located now that the nearby road is no longer in favour with the tradesmen and requires at least a day’s journey by foot over overgrown paths reclaimed by Nature.
It soon became apparent that it was not an amorous moggy, but was a man of unknown origin. He stood just outside my window, balancing with ease upon the rooftop tiles, and though I could see little more than his outline in the waxing moonlight, I could tell that he was peering into my chambers. He turned his head, perhaps to ensure that no witnesses were party to his imminent ingress, and I saw his profile clearly against the sky. He was a lean man, but muscular, and clearly no stranger to breaking and entering, from the relaxed set of his shoulders.
“Oh, oh, fuck,” Sherlock swore, as John swirled his tongue over every exposed millimetre. “Ah, ahh, ahhhhhhh!”
I could not hold back my deepest passions any longer – I pulled him towards me, and kissed him thoroughly. My hand went to stroke his hair, and was surprised when its familiar sleek smoothness was interrupted by the band of black fabric. I began to undo the knot of his mask, when my wrist was caught in a vicelike grip.
I awoke with impressions of having felt embraced, enveloped, loved. There was no sign of anyone having been in the cottage, nor of any forcing of my door-latch. I was, as I have been these many months, alone.
I affected long shirtcuffs to hide my wrists as a precaution – not from the world, but from you. I wanted to spare you the knowledge that our strange affair would end in a coincidence of bitter cosmic humour. The two of us, ignoring the rest of the world, I had once thought. Yet the world had taken notice of us, and intended to come crashing down around us.
John felt the tightening of Sherlock’s testicles and swiftly moved to swallow the head of his cock to catch Sherlock’s semen. Mustn’t mar the trousers, after all.
I had just finished climbing the treacherous cliffs beside the falls when I saw you. I was hunting Moriarty's favourite colonel, a sniper who I was sure had taken your life from a safe and cowardly distance as you returned to the hotel to assist your nonexistent patient. I was certain that he was lying in wait for me to return down the mountain path, should Moriarty's plans for us to finish together have failed, as indeed they had. I was so convinced of my own cleverness in sussing out Moriarty’s contingency plan, that my bowels turned to water and my mouth to ash as you strode furiously into view and up the path.
Sherlock and John have been lucky enough to dodge all the bullets so far, running between building after building. There had to be a sniper on every other building opposite them, owned by said mobster.
The doctor swallowed and took a breath. He's done this before, once in Afghanistan. He was one of the few soldiers to survive. Him and the three others who made it under the truck alive, turned to see all their mates laying dead and unable to make it the twenty feet to survival. He inhaled and exhaled again. This could be a second chance. Everyone who is supposed to survive could survive. It was only two of them. Two of them against all this and the rest of the world.
The doctor sighed in relief and exhaustion. Glad to be alive, glad they made it. "Good plan. But how did you-" He looked over to the detective and immediately frowned. He was under this car alone. There was no one taking cover with him. His heart fell. "Oh my god."
John was in a complete shock. "Jesus, Sherlock..." He scrambled out from under the car, running to the body. He didn't care about the mobsters, about the bullets, about anything. Only his flatmate, his
John lifted his head and searched the sidewalk with his eyes, looking desperately for Sherlock with more fear than he's ever had in Afghanistan combined. His eyes finally settled on a lump sticking out from behind the shadow of the building he just ran from. The mop of curls lay sprawled on the ground. He shook his head. No, God no.
A mob’s gunmen has been shooting at them all night. The shooters didn't seem to be aiming to kill them, only to distract them or at the most injure one of them to slow down their investigation of them.
"No. My mark." Sherlock corrected. He had to be in charge of this for it to be a success. He took a breath. "One..." he gave a pause, building up his nerve to its strongest point. "Two..." His blue grey eyes glazed over as he stared at his friend who prepared to run along with him for their lives. Little did John know, they wouldn't be running in the same direction. "Three..."
John saw that Sherlock was done thinking and could tell a plan had been put into place. Now all he had to do was hear what it was and they could both get to the next building through the raining bullets. He hoped to get back to their home by dawn, that is, if they lived until then.
John immediately ran for the streets, dodging the bullets being shot at him. One narrowly missed his head as he slid quickly under the parked car. Sherlock had been right. They were safe from the firing under here.
“Christ!” The army doctor cursed as he ran too. Just as the consultant predicted, bullets were fired upon the spot he was just standing in. “Sherlock!!” John shouted in anger after him.
"A car?" John nodded. Well that made more sense. They could do that. The car would provide them cover for the reign of bullets firing. They only had to make it twelve feet to the car parked or be torn apart by bullets trying. No pressure at all. He wondered briefly how exactly this became his life. Oh right, he lived with Sherlock Holmes, his nutter of a flatmate.
John's tear filled eyes went wide and he frowned down at the man that was staring back at him through split eyelids. “You
John sighed as they ran for their lives through the backstreets of London. They ended up living far into the morning with minimal injuries and being able to solve the case by noon. The doctor collapsed onto his chair by half one, and was asleep a second after his rear hit the cushion. He awoke to a blanket covering him, hot tea, takeaway and the calming melody of a violin.
The army doctor panted as they pressed up against the wall they just took cover behind. He shut his eyes, trying and for a majority failing to regulate his breathing. He didn't want to disturb Sherlock's thinking with his heavy breathing. The detective has yelled at him for it before. Oddly, the man wasn't saying anything of it now. Sherlock didn't look much better, John realized as he looked his mate over. It was from a doctor's perspective, of course. It wasn't weird. Thankfully, neither of them have been injured thus far but that could very much change very quickly. The two of them were running on pure luck now. Luck and Sherlock's brilliance.
step, he could hear Sherlock's voice through the open door, “I'm in the living room, please come in, John.”
“No. That drug gave everybody time to sedate you again and arrange the sets. You were never in real danger John. The well was a set and in reality you were standing on ground-level. The cameras were hidden in the false stone wall and the water would never be able to reach higher than your neck. The false bones were first dog-bones and then, after a pause, fake children-bones. A reminder about Sherlock's cruel 'friend' from university.”
Well....first sentence was a “safe play”: “You’ll have to help me wash my hair later, please John. I can’t take a shower now.....and there is still blood in it.”
John was silent for a few seconds and then he spoke, “So...you hadn't planned on sacrificing your self to save me?”
Sherlock shook his head, “Culverton was from the 'Inner-circle' in Baskerville, because he WAS a Baskerville.”
John continued, “Well...That I want such an ‘extravaganca’, well, I didn’t feel that it would be fair, without me paying the biggest part of it. And it is not that I want to be a “bridezilla” using all our money and loose the sight of the fact that it is not the wedding that is important, but our life afterwards. I know we had planned a visit to the town hall and have a small dinner for the closest friends and family. But ...this my final marriage.....it should be better, bigger and finer that the previously. Can you understand why Sherlock? Is it OK? Would you allow me to show how much I cherish and love you?”
“No! It's just...your voice is so pleasant to listen to and it makes me so relaxed...”, explained John.
John slumped down on the sofa and had taken the first sip of tea....and then he stopped again and looked at the Queen: “Do my senses betray me, Your Majesty, or is this “Tieguanyin”…the finest tea in the world?!” He put down the fine china with a trembling hand.
John went to Sherlock and wrapped his arms around him. Savouring the wonderful smell of 'Sherlock'. His aftershave, his shampoo and under that, the wonderful rich and nice scent of Sherlock himself.
, as you tried to get Sherlock that pardon. The politicians might be idiots. Unthankful idiots, who forgot who saved them all from being blown to confetti-pieces that November. But the Queen didn't forget. And she hates to be ungrateful. She knew exactly whom she should thank for still being alive.....So, Mycroft Holmes. Couldn't you please reconsider that knighthood again, and persuade John and Sherlock to accept theirs too?”
“And there I came almost too late. I would never have forgiven myself Sherlock, for being such an arse...”
“Hold on a minute, sir. I’ll need a bit more information: when did you receive this card and from whom....and normally there would be more than a card...a coin...a medal. Didn’t you receive such a thing?”
Sherlock smiled, “Then it was fortunate that we had Mrs. Hudson.....and that you came in time. Seeing it now, I can of course see the utter shitty-ness of Mary's advise. But I couldn't then. It seemed like a perfectly good advise about how to save you. And I would do anything to do that.....even die.....”
John leaned forward to kiss Sherlock again, “To confess my love for you and hear you say it back. I had worried so much. Been afraid of spooking you away. Fearing that you would hate me for all the harm I've done to you. And now....it is just so easy....as if it has always been meant to be like that....”
“Oh God. Your wicked mouth!”, moaned John and he continued, breathless, “It should be labelled 'dangerous' and I...Oh God....thought that I......oh sweet Jesus....should be be the one that delivered!”
Sherlock had closed his eyes at a point and smiled because he thought that someone could make a fortune if they could capture that scent and make 'Eau de John Watson'.
“Granted, you git...pathetic weak little slut, you are!” was the reply, but there was some machinery running and a clicking sound and Sherlock could feel the chain be slackened and he was now able to kneel with his arms bend at the elbows and resting against the wall. He could feel that blood was running down his back - and his buttocks and his thighs. He could easily imagine how his back looked like a bloody mess, but somehow he knew that it wasn’t over yet. He had had a glimpse of John’s list....and it was long!
John smiled, “It is because I like doing it with you, you idiot. This was just a silly bet.....I had been drunk when we made it and I had to drink to be able to 'receive my award'. I didn't want to chicken out though, and found it fitting that he should be humiliated a bit. He had bragged so much and I had proved him so wrong. So I just thought I had earned that sexual favour.”
And then John Watson told his first big lie in his entire life: “Of course I have”.....and then he told the second big lie: “I love you, Mary” and smiled at her. He kissed her forehead and she smiled back: “I love you, too, John” and they came to take her to the operation theatre.
Mycroft came and stood by John’s side as she was wheeled away: “It is not because I want to be cruel, John. But you are a doctor.........”
Already after the third blow, Sherlock felt that his mind stilled a bit and narrowed down to 'hurt!'...'pain!' and the wild thoughts that he had fought so hard to control finally faded. But...only faded. They didn't disappear.
It was only John’s immense will-power that prevented him from coming on the spot....oh God...Sherlock’s voice....pure sex! Sherlock could read the telephone book aloud and John would be able to come from that alone!
Mycroft and Greg had been married for 7 months and had finally time eating breakfast together and having at least half a Sunday free, with no international crises or hopefully no murders on the schedule.
“3-5 times a year. And of course, during my more than 2 years away, travelling around in the world, he had to go to the clubs again. He didn't know Lady Smallwood like that then...and her husband was still alive. Mycroft would go to the clubs, too, if I was too pissed off on him. It is not very wise to give your pissed-off brother a riding crop in his hands and then ask for a beating. I would refuse, if he called, if I was too mad at him. Or...if he insisted, because he was desperate enough, then he would only have put out the softer implements. And.....I would always go softer on him after the fist rage-fuelled blows. It is just like wolves: Bare your stomach and your throat, surrender and submit, and the other wolf is unable to hurt the first one. And.....since our arrangement had stopped regarding me, I went to those clubs again, when I had the need.”
And John woke up in Baker Street, sitting on the sofa, with a beer in his hand, sitting next to Greg and there were Sherlock and Mycroft sitting at the table, discussing the upcoming meeting in Bulgaria.
Now Sherlock was giggling a bit as he pointed at the items on the bed, “That the only thing men wear under a kilt is 'Scotland’s future'. That they ‘go commando’ under it...not that I would mind.”
He smiled back, “I would say 'no'. Because you and I can't allow ourselves to give up our positions in the government. You know that. Our successors are not in place yet......and to leave Great Britain in the hands of only Sir Edwin. No....and we would not be allowed to maintain our positions as a married couple.”
(This chapter got a bit longer than expected. So why Sherlock is a masochist, will be revealed in the next chapter)
And the little darkness inside John appreciated when that gorgeous body and mind was submissive and obeyed John. And John did remember, that that submission was a gift from Sherlock to John and should be treated accordingly. Just as when John, albeit seldom, did submit to Sherlock, because sometimes John could need to loose control as well, let himself 'fall' and get 'caught' by Sherlock.
John hesitated for a few seconds. He wasn’t totally sure that he wanted to submit, but a certain part of his anatomy had decided that it would be very interesting indeed.
And the very honest man....John Watson....who never had told a lie in his life....had to say: “I do not *love* you Mary. I can’t. I’m really working on trying to forgive you. But you almost killed my best friend! I *like* you....I respect you....and there are even parts of you that I might think that I *love*. But you are the mother of our child. She is the best thing that ever happened to me and therefore I can promise you that I’ll never voluntarily leave you. Can you live with that? I have to be honest. I don’t want any more lies in our marriage!”
Then John fetched all the duvets and every blanket he could get his hands on and made a soft place in the middle of their living room and Sherlock couldn't help asking, “Are we going on a picnic, John?”
And John had positioned his now erect cock just outside Sherlock's hole and had just pushed his cock's head inside. And each word was punctuated with a hard trust from John, each one getting deeper and deeper into Sherlock's arse.
But if John had thought that he could remain in charge, he was wrong. Somehow Sherlock managed to reverse the roles and now it was Sherlock who had his mouth around John's cock. And John was even more surprised.....even if he hadn't too many functioning brain-cells left to recognize the feeling 'surprise'....when Sherlock swallowed John's cock totally, burring his nose in John's just as well-groomed turf of blond hair above his cock.
Sherlock closed his eyes, “I'm not dying right now. I'm just tired. Please...let me sleep. You can come back in both of you, as soon as John returns.”
And John lifted his other hand to stop Sherlock from saying anything, “......but I might exactly be hurting you, if I didn't take care of your needs. So, before I say 'yes' or 'no' to this, I need to hear why you need it, since it apparently isn't sexual...or at least not sexual alone. So talk to me. Or rather ”talk to me later”. It is getting rather late and we have a lot to do tomorrow. That is ...later today, since it is past midnight. I promise that I'll listen, Sherlock, but right now we need to rest.”
And then John understood that Sherlock thought that John teased him. But thank God he still kept his hand in John's even if he turned his head away.
John reached out and touched Sherlock’s face....even if there were other places he would like to touch too!
And then Sherlock told how he had climbed out of his bed, made that set-up with Leinster Garden and how he had made John and Mary talk. And how he had been in pain the whole time and had lost consciousness and how the paramedics had restarted his heart.
He moved his hands and held them close to John’s neck and moved his hands around on John’s body as he spoke: “Right here...as you of course know...is the “common carotid artery”...and a slight pressure would turn people unconscious. At the back of your neck is a point where I with less pressure that needed for cracking a nut, could paralyse you forever. All over your body are points where I with very little pressure with my bare hands can make you feel unbearable pain.....and yet...you haven’t even flinched a bit as I touched you those places right now! Why should I have less confidence in you, John, than you have in me?”
“My, my......I would have thought that you with your upbringing would have known, what I am”, said the appearance and continued, “But maybe I should have remembered the ..'attributes'...” and suddenly there were a pair of glowing wings sticking out from his back.
They never faced a threat like Moriarty again though. Just normal criminals....which didn’t mean that there were not life-threatening situations.
She smiled a bit as she realised how skilled Mycroft's tailor was. It had to be the same skilled tailor that Sherlock used. Or that Mycroft paid for Sherlock to have his suits and shirts made as well. In Sherlock's case the tailor managed to make Sherlock look almost thin and fragile, when Lady Smallwood knew for certain that Sherlock could have been the living model for Michelangelo's marble-statue 'David'. Sherlock was incredible strong with the athletic build of an acrobat or a dancer. All long and lean muscles.
“It was.” Marianne said, “Thank god Molly has always been jealous of you, John, and you two have seldom interacted. Molly had come to close to 'Mary' and we didn't dare to let her in on the secret. The vitals and all the test-results were falsified by me. I've double-checked and triple-checked everything that went into Sherlock's veins. I've monitored his kidneys and liver to make sure that they were unharmed by the poison and the drugs and the real results kept getting better and better. You are not out of the danger-zone yet, Sherlock, but you will recover...”
“You see?", Mycroft said, “That person. That creepy slimy version of a corrupt Serbian officer. That was the person, who was in that cellar and who could watch that prisoner being beaten without flinching. I had buried myself deep inside that person. Even if I did try to give Sherlock a break. And talking about the mental effects of torture: I wanted to give Sherlock that....that he could talk the 'goon' out of the room, so it would only be him and me. Like that he would have a victory. And he had noticed me, I knew that. He had recognized me and I wanted to give him that victory. That he later made it into that he had gotten himself out....I didn't want to contradict that, because somehow he was right. And it was amazing that he, despite the condition he was in, was still able to deduce so much.”
And John understood. Even if the ring had been on the wrong hand...at least according to English tradition.
John took a deep breath and grappled for Sherlock's hand with his left hand, “....Mycroft and I...and Molly and Mrs. Hudson and Greg, we have all of us taken turns in keeping vigil over you. And at a point I saw your back....and Mycroft told me what he had seen been done to you in Serbia and what he had done to get you out. Even if you managed quite a bit of getting rid of the tugs yourself. And Mycroft showed me.....”
And then Sherlock felt something touching his mouth. Something cold. Ice-chips. And as they melted in his mouth, the terrible dryness, that had felt as if he was containing all the sand from Sahara in his mouth, disappeared....and now he felt something pressing gently against a sore spot on his throat.
John frowned, “That hotel, Sherlock, that hotel in Islamabad, was that by any chance Hotel Continental?..”
should be home-tutored and his brothers not. Oh yes.....his first days in Kindergarten had been very unpleasant....a catastrophe actually. But Sherrinford and Mycroft had managed.
Now the diary did jump almost a year in the dates and Sherlock noticed that, “Why this jump in time?”
And then he stopped talking and just looked around, “No...why do I even bother? I was manipulated into shooting Magnussen, because I was stupid enough to believe that I protected my 'friend' and his wife and their unborn child.....and...”
Strangely enough there could be a freedom in letting another, that you trusted totally and even with your life, make all the decisions. But that part of their relationship was always inside the walls of their apartment. And John didn't have qualms about Sherlock bossing him around a bit, while they were on a case. It had taken a lot of time before John had realised that Sherlock didn't boss John around, when it came to subjects, where John had knowledge and Sherlock not. But John had been blind in that area too, and had had the wrong feeling that Sherlock didn't appreciate John's knowledge.
“Very well then. Undress and lie on the bed. But Sherlock... I’ve been thinking. Should we invite Mycroft?”
“First we have Mary Shelly's diary here.”, told John, “She died at the age of 53, but had time to bring her things in order before that happened.” and then John showed Sherlock the photos from the authentic diary. There were bits and pieces in Mary Shelly's original handwriting, known from the manuscript of '”Frankenstein...or the modern Prometheus” and the there were bits and pieces from another book. Partly ruined and destroyed.
Mycroft and Sherlock had to go to a hospital to get checked, but it was back in London. They had left Bulgaria as soon as possible and had returned to London. John had phoned Rosie to tell her that they were all safe and sound and back in London and that they would visit her in the weekend.
(Sherlock decided that he didn't want to tell John the real reason for that erection. It could wait)
That was why Sherlock one morning, the 18th of August, woke up to find that his hand on John’s chest didn’t feel any heartbeats anymore. John had died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 96.
Sherlock moved to sit beside Mycroft on the couch. He leant against him and gently removed one of Mycroft’s hands away from Mycroft’s face and held it, lifted it to his mouth and kissed it, “I thought I had done something terribly wrong and that you hated me!” Sherlock said, and continued, “I thought that was why you rejected me and kept your distance! As long as you stayed... Until you left again, that Christmas, I would be lying awake and thinking about what I had done or said for you push me away like that!”
Sherlock kissed John's hair, “I told you that Ella said that bad memories would resurface from time to time.” And then Sherlock smirked, “Even if I hadn't imagined it happening during sex.....”
I remembered that they had made a remark about that they should have chosen a military career, and Mycroft Holmes, who was still alive at that point, more than 15 years ago, even if he was indeed rather old, had just looked at their feet (they had all three lost a foot and all of them had a prosthetic foot) with his eyebrow lifted and they had all laughed and he had lectured them about how they could continue to control whatever they wanted to control, just more unseen than before. There was still a 'democratic elected government' at that time. But it held no real power and the civil servants were just as much just marionettes in the hands of the generals and officers as the government was.
And the two men hurried towards Sherlock’s bedroom as John thought: “Thank God I changed the linen!”
Indignantly Mycroft turned towards Sherlock: “I beg your pardon, brother dear. I might be aristocracy....just like you, if you would care to remember that. But my position, my work is most certainly not inherited, nor was I chosen to be in the government...even in a minor position....because of my title, but because of my skills. Contrary to those “dinosaurs” in the House of Lords who, with a few exceptions, only are there because they possess a title. And as you perfectly well know.....both father and I have always declined the offer of being in that part of the English government. If I had my way we would only have one chamber and that relict from the 18th century would cease to exist!”
But this time it didn’t work! Sherlock’s eyes were still wild...and filled with fear. Since when had Sherlock looked at John with fear in his eyes? Now John was deeply worried!
The newcomers, that came from Sussex, have settled down here in the village and are doing nicely and I am not quite so busy any-more. Yesterday those 3 young men came to me and told that they had a confession and I promised to listen.
Then John straightened his back, but didn't let go of Sherlock's hands, “Was that OK?”, John wanted to know.
And John told that he had forgiven her that Christmas, because Sherlock had asked him to do so...and John genuinely had believed that Sherlock had had some cunning plans.
And then Mycroft hugged Greg violently and buried his head at Greg’s shoulder as he cried and explained what had happened to him and Sherlock.
“And then I told Mycroft that I had to shoot him. Preferably without killing him and that Andrea should make sure that he was taken away and everybody should believe, that he was dead. It would require some acting skills on Mycroft's side, but I knew he could do it...and on Andrea's side too and she surpassed my expectations and was very convincing.....”
Rosie didn't know that some of the nice people, who came and saw her play with the others and talked to her and gave her games to play, were skilled people, who looked for signs of 'tilted' development. After all, her mother had proved to be a dangerous psychopath, who had drugged and killed to get her way and who had been cold and calculating to an extent where she had left her friends to die, attempted to kill a friend, who just wanted to help her and had drugged her husband and aforementioned friend up to their eyeballs and had left her newborn daughter to others in order to travel around the world. Not to protect her 'dear ones' as she had claimed, but to re-activate her criminal organisation.
John left the bathroom but returned shortly after carrying Sherlock’s jacket and trousers: “Jesus Sherlock. Your attacker....what did he use on you?!”
Sherlock pointed at it and said, “This is the only thing you have used. And the room was finished as you were 32. You had your position then and earned quite a sum of money. And had Grand-maman's money.”
And he could see as Mycroft Holmes turned into the arrogant 'Iceman' as Mycroft said, “Oh. I would have anticipated that all the drugs would have reduced your mental capacity to the level of....goldfish.”
And that was the exact moment where a knock on the door was heard and a man was shown into the room. John, Eurus, Mycroft and Sherlock rose to welcome the man. They were all brought up well and had learned their manners.
And John understood...even the things Sherlock didn't say, “Jesus...Sherlock. It is a God damned miracle that you returned to London.”
After a few seconds John managed to say, “No...if I'm going to fuck you....and I'm very willing to put my cock into your utterly delicious hole, then you'll have to ride me. Your gland is over-sensitive right now and you'll have to be in charge!”
Sherlock smiled back and said, "I think we have had that discussion a long time ago. You deserved every ounce of trust I had in you. Every ounce!"
Mycroft paused and Greg wanted to know, “But why? Not that I do mind....but why bring them here? If you can pay, they can have very good educations in India as well?”
In the daylight, where such thoughts proved themselves as stupid as they were, Rosie showed no signs of psychopathy, only signs of her high intelligence. She could read and do math before she was 4 and her mental development was far ahead of her psychical abilities and looks, which caused a lot of frustration on her side. Sherlock had been in a similar situation as a child and Mycroft too, so they had solutions.......and when Hamish visited, mostly around the big holidays in summer and around Christmas, he and Rosie enjoyed each other's company and made elaborate plays with dolls, Lego and toys. Rosie was intelligent, very intelligent, but she was a sweet and caring little girl as well.
Sherlock bowed his head in shame. When Mycroft said it - it must be the truth, but Sherlock never thought that Mycroft also hated him that much!
“Yeah...I could hear that” John smirked back: “But it is striking....and your eyes.....they change colours all the time...they are beautiful. Your face.. seen in bits and pieces... is maybe nothing special....but put them together..Strikingly handsome! And not to mention your body....surprisingly muscular behind those clothes that make you look almost thin and fragile....but you are not. And I don’t care about your scars....well I do feel extremely guilty about the two scars that my traitorous “wife” gave you! And the ones on your back that I made worse. But the rest...” and now John gently touched each and one of them, being very careful about the new wounds that were covered with patches: “every one of those scars is a reminder of your bravery, your selflessness, your sacrifices....they are medals of honour....just like you use to say about my scar. Nothing less!”
“I saw him. He was grey and hollow. He had lost his other half. There was only a hollow shell left.”, said John. And then he continued, “It is a bit strange though. There was a time where I could have imagined him and Molly as a couple. And now I feel guilty because she helped me so much after Mary, and now I don't even now where she is in the world or how she is...”
Already the first day, as Sherlock woke up again, John had explained more about what had happened that evening the 10
Mycroft smiled a bit, “After the fall form the rooftop at Bart's Molly was very valuable in keeping it as a secret that Sherlock had survived. And please remember, John, that that secrecy was vital for Magnussen's allowance for you staying alive...”
“Because our arrangement stopped the moment you moved in together with me at Baker Street. That is, Mycroft 'helping'
And now Sherlock smirked, “In more than one way! Your cock up my arse....it fits. Oh God, how it fits!”
They sat in silence, or rather Mary sat and Sherlock was lying and then Mary said, “You can tell me to bugger off …or you could tell me what happened that summer and get it out of your system...”
And John began to talk again, “It is as if I have been conditioned to...see you in a certain way. And not in a positive light...”
Again Sherlock just looked at them and then he began his deductions, “This is the only way it fits. You, Sherrinford, are in a position in USA. You must have falsified your papers, so you were born there...and you are just waiting for the idiot, who currently is the president, to make such a fool of himself, that people would be desperate to accept you as president. And you, Eurus, are now the 'gray eminence' behind the Russian President. I even remember seeing your features on photos, standing close to him. Mycroft is here in Great Britain, being the 'British Government' and just like 'Peter' and 'Valentine' managed to rule the world together, you plan to do the same. But there is a tiny problem...an obstacle. The 'damaged' little brother. Brilliant, yes, or just 'maybe brilliant'. In another way than the rest of you. But damaged. It was shown as I was unable to attend primary-school. As I gained no friends at boarding-school. As I remained lonely at University. And as I began to use drugs. A security-defect.....someone it would be smarter to get rid of....or maybe even use as a chess-piece on your world-sized-chess-board. A pawn? Or maybe even a 'Queen' to be sacrificed if the 'King' was threatened. I know that a chess-board for three players does exist. But the real world is more complicated than a chess-board...but why not 3 players on a three-player world-size chessboard?”
And then John continued to tell about his feeling of deja vu. Of how he just knew how that cellar would look like. How he had known about 'The Twenty' even before they had all the evidence.
Mycroft paused a few seconds and looked out into the air, “That Sherlock did chose to sacrifice himself and kill himself....that was not the expected outcome of that scenario. From that point the staff had to improvise a bit..”
John had a collar too. It was nearly same colour as Sherlock’s, but with more chestnut to it and Sherlock thought that it was looking stunning against John’s more tanned skin-tone. How John managed to maintain that golden tone over almost his whole body while being an Englishman and living in the English climate... Well that was a marvel to Sherlock.
Just....Sherlock now had two small scars on his face, because of John's violence. One by Sherlock's lower lip, and one by the left eyebrow.
“Hmm.....I once got this card....from an officer. And he said that I could call this number any time, if I needed a favour.....” John’s voice faded.....maybe it was just one big mistake...
Mycroft moaned and arched his back and Greg set up a rather fast pace as he pushed into Mycroft in long deep fast trusts. He had a firm grip around Mycroft's hips and had bend Mycroft almost in half, all to well knowing that those welts on Mycroft's buttocks would be stretched and hurt.
Mrs. Hudson had complained about her hip, but as she had done that for years now, neither she or others thought much of it. After all, Mrs. Hudson had celebrated her 90th birthday in flying colours. Danced with all her male guests, including Mycroft and Greg. But to put it short: Martha Hudson, nee Sissons and surrogate-mother for Sherlock, and Rosie's and Hamish' “Nan”, never got to celebrate her 91
Sherlock was ordered to stay still, his arse in the air and head down on this elbows as John put lubricant on one of the big nozzles. John whispered quietly to Sherlock just what he intended to do. Sherlock’s response was a throaty moan.
Mycroft didn't try to speak, because the sudden lump in his throat would make it difficult, so he just nodded and then, after a short pause, he said, “And you did offer yourself on purpose....to save me.” Mycroft closed his eyes and a tear ran down his cheek, “That was....worse than Serbia. I know you think that I am more important and that's why you sacrificed yourself, but....”
Sherlock smiled, a weak smile and said, “Rat-poison. Who would have known that I could cook that from the things in the garage? Too stupid to put us down here......with all that stuff available.....”
'Dear Leader' had died and South Korea, supported by Japan, aimed for taking over the country, but was stopped by China.
And John suddenly remembered, “Oh my God. The 'Sorbonne-shooting'. That was it, wasn't it? We were taught about it, when I started working for MI6.”
In the helicopter on the way to Balmoral he wanted to hear more about how he was supposed to behave. And Mr Hobson just told him to treat her Majesty as he would treat a senior officer. It would be appropriate enough.
John, who was better at reading Sherlock now, did just let Sherlock believe that John hadn't looked through that mannerism - and John just removed his shoes and began to unpack the contents of that plastic-bag. It was several candles, a bottle of red wine and a box of those extremely delicious Petit-Fours from a small bakery near Baker Street.
Greg interrupted him, “Would this knowledge that you had about Magnussen being 'Moriarty' have made it possible for me or others to have persecuted Magnussen? Would that knowledge have made it possible for the law to stop him or his allies in the criminal world?”
And with this visit a bit back in time, we move fast forward again and are now at the early morning after Chapter 19.
John smiled, “No. But it was very important to get rid of different bodily secretions. To stay healthy. Not as in enemas and blood-letting, but as in prostate-massage...”
Mycroft nodded and said, “And right now I feel as if I'm watching people rolling that powder-keg into place and as if they are beginning to fill it with black powder: North Korea. The tension in China. As always the Middle-East. People loosing their civil rights all over the world...even here in Europe. Politically turning even more towards the ultra-right. Brexit didn't do Great Britain anything good and since than the EU had been weakened. And voices talking about separating Scotland from England...they are still there. But it is still a feeling of uneasiness. I do not have solid proof...”
And Sherlock pushed himself a bit away from Mycroft and looked at him for a few seconds, scanned him with his laser-focus and then he said, as he did read something in Mycroft's face, “Oh....that was why you pushed me away and told me to wait to ask for pain, until I couldn't tolerate it any-more. That was the reason for your acerbic remarks and your arrogance and patronisation. The reason for separating us after the caning and letting us deal with the erections our selves. How long....how long have you wanted me the whole way? To have sex with me?”
Sherlock shook his head with the hand on the door-handle, “I know what I look like. It is just transport after all. Too long legs, too thin, my neck too long, my face weird and almost triangular...it was no wonder they called me the 'praying mantis' and 'alien' in school.”
Sherlock nodded and then a faint blush was to be seen on his cheeks as he said, “My bedroom...thoroughly?”
He decided that he needed a morning leak too and went out into the bathroom. Sherlock was now standing at the washbasin and was brushing his teeth....and when he saw John’s ...well actually it couldn’t be called a “morning-wood” as it was in the afternoon....but it felt like morning.....Sherlock quickly rinsed his mouth and said in his deep voice and with a smirk: “If you will allow me, captain, I’ll take care of your problem as soon as you have taken care of your other needs!”
Sherlock sat down on the duvets and John joined him, only clad in his own dressing gown. Sherlock was told to lie down on the duvets and pillows and John sat down beside him. And he reached for the tea and a Petit-Four. And then he fed Sherlock. He kissed him and gave him small pieces of cake. Sherlock just watched and opened his mouth like a baby-bird being fed by its parents. John took sips of the wine and fed Sherlock that wine with kisses as well.
Sherlock continued, “Sian had been told to shoot you at the appointment after ...well after the mortuary. Mary had expected you to do something violently...to me.....and knew you would at least visit the therapist one time after...whatever happened to me......”
“Oh...”, said Sherlock, “I didn't know that....” He paused for a moment to think about this new information. And then Sherlock continued, “Not that it did alter much in Mary's shenanigans. She was still drugging you. That you had resilience to do something of your own, just show how much you still cared for me, despite her plans to make you feel otherwise. She still wanted to make sure that I was sad and broken. Still wanted to, to use the actor 'Moriarty's words “burn the heart out of me”....and she managed to do that. I started to use drugs again and almost killed myself. I didn't really want to live any more and just decided to make my life count one last time, by bringing down that creep Culverton.”
Lady Smallwood came shortly after, carrying the bouquet in a vase. She put in on a table and went to the bar and took two glasses of sherry and offered one to Mycroft, who nodded and took it with a 'thank you'.
And then John looked at Sherlock, who was sitting in his armchair and who seemed to be deep in thoughts. Not in his Mind-palace, just deep in thoughts.
John thought that the sight of the two Holmes brothers together would be quite arousing. He shook his head, “We are all as mad as hatters” he thought.
John sighed, “Yeah in a minute, Love. I’m knackered.” and slumped down in his char and rested his head against the backrest, looking up at the ceiling before he closed his eyes...only for a few seconds.
“My utterly mad-man.”, whispered Greg as he removed the items. First loosening the eye-let on the 'sound' from the garter, then easing Mycroft's cock and balls out of the ring. Then removing the sound. Kissing the cock-head and sticking his tongue into the a bit gaping slit. The sound had stretched it a bit and Mycroft moaned.
“Because you were David, but a better version” Sherlock answered: “A bit older but just as good looking. Just a bit shorter and just a dangerous, but more caring and loving. The best of David with the best of John Watson added. She couldn’t have had a better father for her child.”
Sherlock turned his head and looked at John, “Mycroft gave me 10 rather hard blows. Each one felt more and more pleasurable and a buzzing feeling did build in my body. At blow number ten, I came all over my bed in the most forceful orgasm, I had ever experienced. Everything went white...and when I came to my senses, I was lying on my stomach on my bed and Mycroft was rubbing Arnica-cream into my sore buttocks. He told me, that he would always do that after a 'session' as he called it, but if I didn't have sexual release during the caning, or the flogging or the cropping, I would have to deal with it on my own.“It is weird enough as it is, Sherlock.”, had Mycroft said, and during the years, where we helped each other, it was just an unspoken thing. We would just turn around and leave as soon as the blows had been given. And then we would return a bit later to give after-care. We always aimed after not breaking the skin. Mostly Caning, sometimes cropping and sometimes a whip. So pain...most certainly, but not too much damage. And yes, I know, that despite not witnessing the other one ejaculate, and even if we never fucked, it is still sex and still incestuous.”
“And now you have learned that I'm just a human being as well and with a somewhat dubious moral.”, said Mycroft and continued, “...if you want to press charges against me or have someone to do that, I'll understand and...”
“Not...oh....not...” managed Sherlock to say, before he came in thick spurts and since John's trusts were stimulating Sherlock's prostate, Sherlock continued to come. His inner walls contracted rhythmically around John's cock and that was enough for John to be hit by the wave of his second orgasm.
And then John continued, “You can imagine how sorry for himself he felt as Harriet confessed that she had not found a bloke, with whom she now shared a flat, but a girl. And that they were sexual partners. My father gave her such a beating that she ended up at the hospital, but she refused to report it. It was not something you did in our neighbourhood. Only if it was very severe. And then she was forbidden to show herself at our house. Of course neither mother nor I obeyed that ban, and Harriet would come to visit us, when father was at the pub.
And right there John did the bravest thing he had ever done: he spoke the truth, “Because I love you. Have done that since we met. I chose Mary because I didn't dare to hope that I could have you. That you didn't feel that way. I've been so blind and I haven't seen your love. Can you forgive me?”
“It’s OK. I would have said the same thing. Now....be a good girl and say to the doctors, who are waiting, that they can continue the operations. I would so much like to have you back in our apartment...or a new place.... as soon as possible..”
knees. You are the most caring, loving, generous, unselfish man I have ever known to walk on God’s Earth...and I’m sorry that I teased you...because it came out the wrong way. I’m sorry....”
“I agree. Being here now was worth every pain and heartbreak.....Oh God I love you so much, Sherlock.”
“I like it and find it very arousing, that you are shaved, that your balls are so hairless and the rest of your groin, including your arse, too..”, said John almost conversationally as he continued to take Sherlock apart, taking Sherlock's balls into his mouth and sucking on them. Just with a tiny touch of teeth.
“And I know that you only forgave me because of Rosie. And you only chose me because you had lost Sherlock and that's my role, isn't it? Holding you together when he breaks you? Or the circumstances around him breaks you. He loves you with all his heart, no matter how much he unintentionally hurts you and he tries so hard to keep you with me. You still think he killed Magnussen for my benefit. But it wasn't. He did it for you, John. He saved me for you, because he wants us to be together. Not because it is what I want, but because
John frowned, “I think it was the case with the 'Burned Newspaper'. One of the cases we worked on...before....just before I married...”
And they left. To the two big suite of rooms, that the hotel had provided. Not close to each other and a bit away from the guests as well. After all, they had the whole hotel for themselves, for them and their guests. No other visitors.
And Sherlock just obeyed as John hurried to the living room to fetch his laptop that he had left there the evening before. As he entered the bed-room again, he carried the laptop and placed it on the bed while he continued talking. And then he placed it on the floor besides the mirror: “I know that you are sort of vain when it comes to your clothes...your shirts and suits.....and your tailor makes a great job to conceal your muscles....and I suppose it is on purpose...but look Sherlock.....look dammit! If I went to that museum and painted the hair on that statue black...I would be looking at you!”
Coming back into the bathroom again John couldn’t wait any longer. He put some more lubricant on his cock. He could not remember being so turned on ever....not even as he had been at his most hormonal teenage-years.....and he pushed his cock into the welcoming warmth and tightness of the willing Sherlock......Oh God...it was so good...so fulfilling......finally to be there!
John hugged Sherlock and kissed his head, “I suppose it has something to do with Mycroft. I promise that I'll remember that he really did offer to die to save me. So go on. Spit it out.“
Mycroft squeezed Greg's hand and said with a sigh, “I think that what I'm going to tell you could be a valid reason. So...here it comes: You do know that 'The Homes Foundation' does support a lot of homeless people around the world. In the United States, several countries in South America, in Europe and Australia. We are not that much present in Asia, but we do support some foster-homes in India. The country is rich enough to take care of its own people. They just choose not to.....and that can be said about Great Britain too, unfortunately. Well, back to the foster-homes. We support three: one in Delhi, one in Kolkata and one in Mumbai. Helping street-children, orphans, to get an education and a future. If they show remarkable talents, we might even pay for extra education, even university...”
But John did read it for what it was: a move in a “game of chess”...or in a game of “who would acknowledge the elephant in the room first?”
Then Sherlock had hesitated, before he had continued, “......there was something, though. She said that the world was changing and that every step should be taken with caution. But she had said that before, so I didn't pay so much attention. Should I have?”
“No not quite. Just an art of defence that can be done wearing a suit. And then I box a bit and then of course my fencing..”
Sherlock continued, “As the time went by and I knew how to do it, those means were not necessary for that part. I can easily, with only a small effort, reach that level now. But I need aids to get to the next part of the process...”
“I...I fail to see the purpose of this, John....sir! I can understand why you want to punish me, but this is going to kill me, sir! I’m sorry....but doesn’t it count that I have saved your life many times.... sir?”
And right there Sherlock stopped and looked actually a bit embarrassed and continued, “...never mind.”
At the private-hospital John hurried to Mary’s room in the intensive care unit. In the helicopter Mycroft had told that both Mary and Mina had been severely injured. Mina had lost consciousness almost immediately and had never woken up. She had been declared brain-dead by the arrival in the hospital. Mary was supposed to undergo several operations but was now heavily sedated so she wasn’t in pain and was awake and waiting for John. She had insisted on waiting with the last operation until her husband could be present. And the operation could be postponed, but not for long.
was sent to the governments in their countries. Well, not Great Britain, as Mycroft and Leuris had informed the Prime minister of the true nature of those arrested people from the house in Bulgaria. And it was of course noticed how the protest were written and which persons, who protested the most. And they were investigated even more thoroughly, and some of those persons suddenly found themselves in a high security jail. Not all countries were allowed to contain their high-risk-prisoners, because their governmental and public structures had been too corrupted by 'The Twenty'. But other countries were more than willing to 'invite' the prisoners to a permanent stay. And they turned their deaf ear to organisations, who claimed that the treatment of those prisoners was inhuman and cruel. The world would learn the truth...later.
Mycroft nodded, “I just told her that I wouldn't do that to her, because you still loved her, cared for her as you had done your whole marriage. You worked your...behind...off, to make London a safer place for her and your daughters, and she told me that she had finally realised that. She said, that she did know now, but she had refused to see it then. And then there was the thrill of having an affair. She knew, she was to blame and said that you deserved to be happy. And she didn't want to be greedy and unreasonable. She just wanted enough to make a safe future for your girls..”
Sherlock looked at Mycroft with a sudden understanding in his eyes, “That is the reason why you had to burn my flat? To get rid of the drugs?”
And therefore John only felt an immense relief as the doctors showed up only 15 minutes after to tell that Mary had passed out on the operating table. The damage to her cerebellum had grown worse over time as the swelling began. There had been nothing they could do...
And those words made Mycroft laugh and despite his sore nipples and that butt-plug stretching his arse, he was now a bit longer away from the threatening orgasm and he smiled at her.
“Just you wait till I'll drag the bars through the wounds.”, said Sherlock. But Mycroft didn't think that was bad either and he looked at the pierced nipples in one of the mirrors, before they were bandaged.
Mycroft opened the envelope and pushed several photographs against Greg. It showed two dark haired boys, apparently brothers and in various ages. And with dark hair, fair skin and dark green eyes.
John put down his book and looked at Sherlock, “Vanilla sex isn’t easing your tension then? You need the pain?”
And then they kissed and held close on to each other for a few minutes, before John nodded to indicate that he was ready and Sherlock continued, “Well. The false therapist. Sian was told that she would just shoot you with blanks, just the noise, but the gun was loaded with gelatine-bullets. Relatively harmless, if they just enter muscle-tissue. Potential damaging if they enter for example an eye. And Sian had been instructed to aim at you left eye. Thank God she was such a lousy shooter...and Mary didn't have fantasy enough to realise that people could be that bad at aiming, that Sian hit you in your shoulder and you just fell down....sedated. Then Mary hurried inside and killed Sian, because she knew too much...and Mary would probably have, but I'm not sure here, ended you as well. But since she was interrupted and since she might still have had feelings for you, she just disappeared. She was killed in France, by Mycroft's agents. The ban on shooting the woman, who had tried to kill me, well she had tried her best, if not in Magnussen's office, then with her insane advise to me later, that ban had been lifted the moment she was away from you and you wouldn't be harmed by her death. She was dead to you already, so the delayed punishment for murdering me could finally be executed.”
Sherlock paused briefly, before adding, “I suppose there might be another hamper from Fortnum and Mason soon...”
I said that I might visit how Mycroft had to pay for his mistakes regarding Lady Smallwood. Here it is. How I imagined that it did happen. It got a bit longer than originally thought. And there are new tags added to the tag-list.  Beware: this is tough stuff even if Mycroft fully accepts it. It is totally consensual.
Mycroft huffed, “Oh yes. Choose the least significant person first. Well. I had to learn that I could be weak and vulnerable and not in charge...and that would not release Armageddon. That I could be me and not 'The British Government' and I would still be able to cope.”
They looked at each other and then Sherlock closed his eyes, “I did remember enough to want revenge. But not until a few years after. I was 15 at that time. Mycroft was away and Sherrinford had been visiting and had been to town and was drunk, as he returned. It wasn't me who started the fire, but I didn't try to get back into the house to save Sherrinford, as I discovered the fire. I saved my violin and did hide in the garden-shed, where they found me. For a long time, they thought that I had started the fire and father and mummy refused to talk to me. I was 'high', when they found me. Not my doing, someone had drugged me. And I was sent to a rehabilitation-centre. I now know who put the house on fire and actually killed Sherrinford, but I can't prove it was Culverton. But Sherrinford had refused to follow their plans...I knew that much. I had heard him and Mycroft argue. Not that much of it made sense. But very little made sense in those days...so why not a strange argument between my brothers?”
“I begin to understand why you said the other day that England is in reality not ruled by the government” said John.
Sherlock touched John's face gently, “But now we are allowed to show our love and we are here...and alive. How can we wish for more?”
Sherlock pointed at another journal, “And this is my real journal and not the falsified one. Violet never had another child after the very difficult birth of that infant girl.”
He reached out and touched Sherlock's face, “Look what it brought him. And I've been cruel towards him too. That he was able to forgive us all, was a bloody miracle..”
Greg moved his hands to Mycroft's face and kissed him, not caring about the blood, “I'm here. We found your papers in the hotel room. Your notes and your computers, but since John and I not are 'The Holmes-brothers', it took us some time to figure out about 'The Twenty' and where they were.”
“Yeah...I know...and I will. Just you soak a bit longer....and don’t try to get up from the water before I’m in here again!”
“Because I sometimes have scared the......brown stuff.......out of people when I take them on a ride!”
John took a deep breath, “You...you are the most annoying, obnoxious, irritating, busybody arse-hole of a big brother and only the fact and something that I have to remind myself of, that you offered to die to save me at that blasted false island, prevents me from punching you on your big, much to big nose, right now!”
Imagine an old book, red and leather-bound.....and the first pages were printed on a printer and later glued into the book. The rest of the book is written by hand.
Baker Street was almost redecorated. The last day that Sherlock would be full-time in Mycroft's house, was coming closer. One of the last mornings they were eating breakfast and Mycroft looked at Sherlock and said, “I have one last fantasy, that I'll need your help to fulfil.”
Now the man smiled at John’s confusion: “I suppose they forgot to tell you...in their confusion. After all...they have been looking for you the last 6 years!”
He should have heard John’s thoughts: “Oh my.....get a grip on it John Watson! Sherlock is wounded....he doesn’t need you ogling his delicious body right now!”
And then both John and Sherlock yawned...and agreed on that it was enough for tonight. There would still be a lot of time to tell more. Tomorrow.
'? What fucking bullshit is that? Sherlock had to go through his miserable life with rape, betrayal, neglect, heartbreak and loss....just to prevent a ...a hole in a bloody imaginary piece of fucking cloth?! And you lied to him...at least by omission, by dangling a 'what might happen' in front of his eyes and not telling all the terrible things that would happen in between?“
Now Sherlock moved so he had his mouth close to Mycroft's ear, “Here is my plan: I go in the bathroom here and I take an enema. You return to your bedroom. You find a nice pair of your bespoke trousers.....older ones if you want to keep them as a token of memory...or newer ones, if you want your cleaners to arch an eyebrow. No pants! And a nice white crisp shirt. And a tie...I want that tie around my cock and my balls and up between my arse-cheeks. I want it filled with my scent....and when you are wearing it, sitting at one of your meetings, you can touch it...and discretely move your fingers close to your nose....and smell me! No one else have our heightened sense of smell. Just you and I and...”
you, because you were going to take the only good thing, that had happened in my life for a very long time, away from me. And then you didn't do that, even if you could have done it. You stepped back....planned my wedding. Saved John's Major Sholto. And.......then I shot you!”
When John and Mary had returned to their flat and Mary got a moment of her own, she looked at the note Sherlock had put in her pocket as he gave her a farewell hug. She had instantly understood why Sherlock had shot Magnussen as soon as she had woken up from her drugging in Sherlock’s parents house. She just hoped that her love for John would be just as big as Sherlock just had shown that his was......risking imprisonment for several years just to protect her...and thus making John happy.
John removed the straps restraining Sherlock, as well as those around his genitals. As soon as Sherlock had relaxed a bit, John ordered him to turn over, and John had given him fifteen strokes with the crop, ordering Sherlock to count each one. Sherlock wound his hands back into the restraints anchoring him to the bed. The cropping left red stripes but not welts. Sherlock had moaned and squirmed and enjoyed the treatment immensely, well on his descending totally into subspace. At hit number fifteen,  Sherlock had mewed and ejaculated. It had almost made John come too, and he had knelt down on the bed beside Sherlock and only needed a few tugs before he had come too.
