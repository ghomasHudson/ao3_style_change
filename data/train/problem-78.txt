Mary laughed as her image faded.  John sighed and flushed because Sherlock, his Sherlock, wanted him and that was almost too good to be true.
“Do we have to do anything?”  Mycroft asked.  “You’re happy, Sherlock’s happy and Rosie is happy. Why are we interfering with it?”
“When I had a look around, there was a couple in the middle shagging,” John said.  “Blokes come into these rooms and wank at whatever’s going on.”
“Oh, you bastard.” John put his sandwich back on the tray. “You complete git.” He pounced on Sherlock and pushed him onto his back on the bed. “Want to play games with me? I’m going to make you scream.” John’s hands were inside Sherlock’s pants before he’d finished talking, and he gripped Sherlock’s cock with a firmer hand than was entirely comfortable.
“Works for me,” John replied.  “Now, for God’s sake get me to a shower before we’re superglued together forever.”
“Ah cannae believe what’s been going on at Langridge’s right noo,” Jamie said.  He was sitting with John and Sherlock in a café near the brothel.  “Scary times.”
“Agreed.” John nodded to Lestrade.  “So how on earth are we going to catch our ‘murderer’ in the dark?”
John grinned and, damn him, that made Sherlock laugh. While he was relaxed, he felt a slight stretch. He looked at John.
“Yes!” Sherlock confirmed before he dragged John up the bed and held him close, so their faces were almost touching. “Stop faffing and penetrate me, John. If you don’t hurry, I’m going to pin you down and do it myself. Just. Fuck. Me.”
John knew he’d never have the delight of telling Sherlock they were to be fathers. Sherlock would deduce it long before he did. But, what the hell? John
“Fucking fuckity-fuckbags!” Sherlock yelled. He paused. Someone was in the flat. He took a quick peek around the door. It was John. “Oh, it’s you.”
“Shall we sleep like this?” John sped his movements a little and, as an afterthought, fucked his come into Sherlock’s navel with his thumb. “Covered in each other’s scent, marking each other, reeking of sex. Maybe I’ll make you go to crime scenes smelling of my come, Sherlock. Would you like that? Everyone knowing that my Alpha is owned just as he owns me?”
John stayed on the line. He didn’t know why.  Rosie started to sob.  “It’s okay, Rose,” he whispered. “Daddy’s okay, I just need some medicine.”
“I wanted to talk to you about something intimate,” John said. “So, I thought I’d wine and dine you first.”
John shook his head and let his head drop back against Sherlock’s shoulder. There was enough of an angle for slightly sideways kiss. “You feel good,” John replied. Sherlock pushed in a little more.  “So good.”
There was something in the tone that made Sherlock laugh.  He tried to keep his tongue in place, but the laughter grew and spread.  John seemed to catch on and then they were both scrunched together in the cooling water as they laughed and laughed.   When the giggles petered out, John pulled Sherlock forward into messy a kiss.
John watched Sherlock read the message. Under the warm lighting of the wall sconces, Sherlock’s pale skin looked gold.
“Fuck, yes,” John agreed. He must have coated his fingers with his slick on the way because when they were pressed against Sherlock’s arse, they were cool and wet. “How’s that?” John asked when one finger breached Sherlock’s hole.
“Already?”  Mycroft said.  “You need to let him rest, Sherlock.  I can put you in touch with someone if you need, well, relief.”
“Just so long as you don’t torture the bloody thing,” John added. Sherlock paused in the middle of the kitchen.  He pulled out his mobile and read the screen. “What’s the matter?”
Sherlock drew out his mobile. He’d phoned Mycroft when they entered the shop and let him listen throughout his and John’s exchange with the woman.  “Ready?” he asked his brother.
Mycroft Holmes was nervous.  He’d just been told that his brother and Dr Watson were on their way up to his office.   He didn’t want to see either of them.  During his last conversation with Sherlock, he’d informed his brother that he would only turn over Mark Tyler’s key to a safe deposit box if there was a compelling reason to do so.  Mycroft hadn’t stated what reason that would be and he hadn’t turned the key over to the security services. He had, in short, stalled for time.  The perfect outcome would be to turn the key back over to Tyler without it being used at all.  Mycroft knew that was unlikely.  He now had a feeling he was about to weigh up the security of a Europol agent and investigation against the demands of his brother.  Such dilemmas
“I love you.” Sherlock’s eyes glittered in the dark.  “I’m still not entirely used to the fact that I can say that.  I never thought that would happen.”
Despite the pain, John’s heat affected body had responded and he’d climaxed. The journey from physical assault to base physical release had taken a scathingly long time. Afterwards, wordless, John had climbed off the bed on burning legs and escaped to the bathroom.
Sherlock searched his brain high and low for a question that wasn’t related to how filthy John Watson was in bed, how horny he really got, and how many times he liked to be penetrated. “What about after?”
“Fuck.” Sherlock was immediately louder. John barely managed to keep his hand around Sherlock’s cock because his body bucked so wildly.  “Oh, oh, oh.” Sherlock pulled John up and over his body. John slipped his hand between them and pulled and stroked Sherlock’s cock and balls.  “Not going to last long,” Sherlock murmured as he clutched John’s body to him.
“Arrest him and visit the family home. John and I would like to take a look at his home too. We’ve got an errand to run; let us know when you’ve secured the house.”
“Good, good.” John circled his hips but, at one spot, they stuttered to a stop. “There,” John said. “There.”
“No, no, no,” Bailey said.  “That’s no way to test equipment. I want a good solid ‘one-two, one-two’ or nothing at all.”
“Rosie’s far better than silly Sherlock, isn’t she?”  Molly said to the child in her arms. Rosie grabbed Molly’s nose and pulled. “On second thoughts…”
John smirked. It amused him that Mycroft Holmes, the man who ran the country, Theresa May be damned, carried a child seat for Rosie in the boot of his chauffeur-driven Jag.
Sherlock’s eyes turned golden-green in the warm light of the corridor.  John nodded.  John reached for the door handle and thrust out his chest.
Sherlock shrugged.  He felt considerably uncomfortable with this turn of events.  “If I knew that, I would have rectified the matter, wouldn’t I?”
“Now, my men, there’s something I want to show you,” Nathan said.  He unzipped his trousers and dropped them.
“Fancy making me a cuppa?” Ian had winked, and, just in that moment, he really had looked a little like John Watson.
“So I did.” John kicked off his jeans and pants, then bent down to remove his socks.  Once he was naked, he dropped to his knees between Sherlock’s legs. He ran his hands up the inside of Sherlock’s thighs.  “Your cock does appear to be quite swollen, Mr Holmes.” When his hands were at the apex, John gently grasped Sherlock’s bollocks to stroke and tug at them.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.  John couldn’t discern if he looked a little embarrassed too?  The room was too dark to tell if his skin was flushed.  John smiled, and Sherlock met his eye.  The air crystallised around them for a moment. Everything stopped, just for a second.
“All I want from my life is to be with you and your daughter. Well, that and solve crime. And experiment. And study bees.” Sherlock took his last mouthful of toast.

“Take your clothes down with you. There are towels in the airing cupboard downstairs. You’ll find them, I’m sure.”
Proofed by Lockedinjohnlock, who has tamed by grammar and punctuation and, in this chapter at least, corrected my brain-freeze over 'of'.  I was clearly broken by this point.  Remaining errors are mine.
Tyler wore a dressing gown. Behind him and Charles, other people started to enter the VIP lounge.  It’d been agreed that several undercover officers and Langridge’s employees would come straight to the film room along with the club’s VIP’s.
“Unless you know how this man died, the police will need to investigate.” John started to count out loud. He tried to blank out the voices of the men around him, the great, the good and the definitely-not-so-good, who mumbled about their wives, their boyfriends, their jobs, their constituents.  John bit it all back and concentrated on Charles’ voice telling everyone that Dr Watson was right, and that the doors would be locked.  Even still, John knew, he
“Have you ever seen drugs circulate at Langridge’s?” Sherlock asked. “I know Charles doesn’t approve.”
Oh, and you'll either be pleased or horrified to know that I've started on a follow-up to this fic in the past few days.  o.O
“I love you.” Sherlock’s voice broke halfway through and emotion rushed to his head. He started to move again for distraction if nothing else. But, as he canted his hips back and forth, he was sure he felt John’s heart thump heavily through his back and right into the centre of Sherlock’s chest. “You’re mine.”
“Because of course you knew where I was working today?”   John put on his seatbelt because it annoyed Mycroft.
“Harris’ Safe Deposit, Box 342.” Sherlock took the keys.  Mycroft clung onto them for a moment.  “If you need anything,
“Surely the washing up can wait, John,” Sherlock said.  “I think your time would be far better spent with me in the bedroom.”
“Thanks for breakfast, Sherlock,” John said once he’d shovelled the last, delicious forkful into his mouth.  “That was, well, nice.  You know, you don’t have to get Rosie up in the morning.”
Thanks to Lockedinjohnlock for her proof-reading par excellence. Any other mistakes that remain are mine, mine, all mine.  Thank you also to Pantera72 for checking my French and thus stopping any damage I may have caused to the entente cordiale - or at least the one amongst British and French fic readers.  It's much more important than the real, political one.
“Tea, yes.” Sherlock walked over to the mirror over the fireplace, where he and John knew there was a bug. “Mycroft is even more annoying than I ever thought possible.”
“Are you sure, John?” Sherlock asked. “Even more than your heat, this changes things. It changes us.”
Proofing for this comes care of LockedinJohnlock and her work is much appreciated. Needless to say, remaining errors are purely my mistake.
For a while, serenity blanked Sherlock’s mind. John’s calls, however, soon filtered into his consciousness, like sunlight in a shadowy glade. When full consciousness overtook the sublime, Sherlock realised his hip was sore, his arse was freezing, his leg was draped over John’s, as was the left-hand side of his torso. John sounded more and more annoyed.
“Nothing official.  What about your sources?”  Mycroft raised an eyebrow. The two brothers looked at each other. A Mexican standoff. Mycroft knew Sherlock had connections in the drug world and he knew Sherlock wouldn’t give them up to him. Mycroft
Now, I have a choice for you, my dear readers.  I could post chapter 22 on Tuesday, or I could post it tomorrow.  May I have your thoughts, please?
“John?”  Sherlock had been lying on the sofa deep in thought. He tipped himself off, onto his hands and knees, then crawled over to John.  “Are you injured?”
Sherlock pulled up and away for a moment.  He squirted a cold drizzle of lube over John’s belly.  It felt rather wonderful on his cool skin. Sherlock lowered back down, and his slick cock rubbed against John’s.
“I’ve arranged for a cash in transit service to come and collect it and transfer it to Coutts. They will then arrange a bank transfer to your account.  The courier will give you the password ‘Lavender’.  I’ll text you his name, registration number and ID number in the morning when the job is allocated.”
“So, you just used any old random bottle of stuff some stranger gave you? Did you even check the bottle?”  John held the bagged lube in his hand.
“So, with his views on his own sexuality and his fears regarding his career, I think we can deduce that he killed Liverson to keep him quiet. And, because of his twisted ideas of homosexuals, despite being one, he would likely not see killing Liverson as a bad act, per se.  Any other connections?”
“Duncan, would you take Dr Watson’s statement please?  See if you can rustle him up a cup of tea and a biscuit too, hmm?”
The man climbed up the pole, gripped it with his thighs and threw his torso backwards.  He slid down slowly. The friction of spandex against metal made a squeaky fart noise.
“Good morning, Mr Holmes and Dr Watson,” a bright, breezy female voice twittered into the room. “It’s time for breakfast. I’ll leave the trolley in the corridor.”
Sherlock reached between John’s legs and circled his hole with his finger before he slipped it inside.   John whimpered a little.  His arse was still loose and sticky from earlier.  Sherlock pushed a second finger inside easily and crooked them to find John’s prostate.  He was rewarded by a high-pitched wail before John’s knees buckled.   Sherlock reached around John and pushed him back. He’d seen what he thought was a chest of drawers from the hallway light when they walked in.  Skimming his fingers over it, Sherlock ascertained the chest stood at waist height and he guided John back and helped him to lie on top.
John fell asleep to the plaintive strains of the violin and awoke to the smell of bacon.  He said a silent thank you to Mrs Hudson and climbed out of bed.  Rosie was already up, so Sherlock must’ve heard her stir and come in to collect her.  It never failed to amaze John how Sherlock seemed to be attuned to his daughter’s sleeping habits.   After a shower, John put on his boxers and his dressing gown and went downstairs.
Mary hadn’t removed her clothes. She’d just taken John’s Alpha dildo out of his hand and began to fuck him with it, none to gently.
“Smack,” Tyler said.  “And my sister. I hadn’t seen her in years.  Rosa found me when I killed the real Mark Tyler.  She was sent to kill me. She watched me kill him and helped me take his identity. She got me into rehab and then got Europol to take me in.”
Lesley looked confused for a moment and then smiled.  “Well, congratulations, first of all. We do sell hats for gentlemen.  Are you thinking of the traditional top hats or are you thinking more about bowlers or something a little more recherché?
The second thing to say is that Sherlock and his reticence, his past, noted at the end, is not going where you think it is.  The follow up to this fic is not a rape fic, it's not a horror story. It's darker than this, but I promise you, it's not going to go all shit-shaped.  It's just the story of someone facing the stuff they've shoved into the background for a very long time.  We all do it, and Sherlock's got some shizz to deal with.  Do not despair; it's all about the love.
Sherlock felt John pull the vibrator out and he rolled sideways.  John collapsed next to him.  With his last coherent thought, Sherlock pulled John close and just breathed.
John rubbed his eyes.  He’d been looking through the memory sticks they’d retrieved from Mark Tyler and Lesley Shaw’s home.  Most of them were dull. One contained a series of recipe e-books, another included hat patterns.   John printed off all the financial records he found to compare with those from Sherlock’s original money laundering investigation.  One stick contained at a series of reports Tyler had, apparently, submitted to Europol.  He printed them too, though they were actually rather dull.
And then, one miserable March, John knocked on the door of 221B. Sherlock, who knew it was John from his gait, didn’t bother answering. He just wandered into the kitchen to put the kettle on. He heard John enter, heard him approach, didn’t expect to be spun and slammed against the hall door.
“I am yours.” John reached back to grab Sherlock’s arse and encourage him on. His voice hitched in time with Sherlock’s hips. “I think I’ve always been yours. And, you bastard, you’re mine.” Sherlock grinned at the less romantic term of affection because he knew it carried no less love.
“You want you to make love with me now.” John rested his forehead against Sherlock’s. “It’s everything I want.” John ran his heads over Sherlock’s chest and the lean muscles that flexed beneath. Poseur. John smiled against Sherlock’s lips and they breathed in others air. Sherlock reached for the lube, and, in seconds, his finger was in the cleft of John’s arse. “Yes.” John stood up on his knees and buried his head into Sherlock’s neck until the strong, Alpha scent made the nerve-endings in John’s skin prickle.
“Please, yes, yes, oh, oh, I can’t tell, jeez, how good, good, so good.” John thumped the bed and opened his legs wider.
“Can you feel that?  It’s doing it itself,” John said dreamily.  “I’ve never felt anything like it before.”
“Don’t be,” Sherlock said as he flopped back down on the bed. “It was only fantastic because it stayed hard for ages. Yours is much nicer.” John’s mouth closed around Sherlock’s cock again and he hummed. Those little vibrations did amazing things. “He knew that I was interested in sex back then, so he sometimes withdrew it, or got halfway through and then wouldn’t touch me, or tied me up and wandered off for tea. Oh, do that again!” John had the perfect rhythm of up, suck, down going on, and then added in the occasional testicle fondle or some lovely pressure against Sherlock’s perineum. “He was an idiot. And once I found cocaine, and learned that as long as you bought the good stuff it’d never leave you high and dry, I switched allegiances.”
There was something in Piero’s expression that made Sherlock pause. “Even from the Marquês,” he added.
Sherlock looked at Murphy’s face. He maintained eye contact with Lestrade and he revealed few indictors of lying.   He was good at it.  Well-practised.  His voice sounded familiar. Sherlock had a link to Lestrade via earpiece.
“Wake up, you git.” John shook Sherlock so forcibly he fell out of the bed and landed in a heap. “About time.”
Essentially, the sequence is infinite, as is it's pattern in nature.  And, well, it seemed right to link it somewhere into the oldest profession in the world.  Or maybe that just means my mind makes everything naughty. *shrugs*
“One of them.” John nodded.  “I’ll just send them up an update.”  He texted Sherlock and Mycroft and apprised them of the situation. “How’s he doing with the rock?”
Sherlock passed it over.  John texted Sherlock. “Mycraft,” he spelled out. “Tell him to sort so yoo look afer Rosie. You nex of king.”   John put his phone down and let the painkillers do what they should.
Though he was an Alpha, Sherlock had always been atypical in many respects. When he was seventeen years of age, he’d mastered self-control during his ruts. He’d kept his private life strictly private, even from mummy. When he was twenty-one years of age, Sherlock had shared his boyfriend, Alex’s, heat and the sex had been so intensely pleasurable it’d rivalled only the purest of drugs. Indeed, it might’ve been truly intoxicating had it not been for Alex’s subsequent behaviour.  As heat cooled into the everyday, and Alex’s view of Sherlock’s charms became less about his irrepressible cock and more about his personality, Alex had loudly looked elsewhere for love.
Should he start to cook, Sherlock wondered.  He should certainly pay more attention to John’s feelings. John had looked at Sherlock a lot tonight, even when he was only in his pants.  He would try to be sexier for John.  Sherlock should also make it clear to John that he found him attractive, he decided.
The slick sound of John’s hand on the fake cocks managed to be both ridiculous and arousing. Sherlock hissed a few words of encouragement and took John’s hips in his hands.   His face was in line with John’s chest, so Sherlock touched his lips to the sparse wiry hairs collected there and then licked his left nipple.  John bucked against him as he sucked and licked the sensitive nub.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.  “The case brought up many questions in my relationship with John.  The case exacerbated his confusion. It is inaccurate to blame John.”
John thought. He’d found Fabian annoying since the Jason’s death. Was it because Fabian was different? Or was it because, in the cold light of day, he realised that Fabian’s resemblance to Sherlock was barely even skin deep.
“I can’t help but think that the running commentary isn’t very convincing.” John unzipped his trousers.
“Do you know something, Sherlock Holmes?  You’ve made me a happy man. For a while, I didn’t think it was possible for me to be happy again. I was wrong.  You’re really that good, you bastard.”
“While me and Greg watch, at the most,” Sally replied. “And it’s on night-vision, which isn’t that clear anyway. Course, Europol might need the video.”
Mycroft paused, then nodded.  “As you wish, Dr Watson.”  It would be churlish to say that he’d already put the wheels in motion for Tyler to be brought to London the following day. After all, Sherrinford wasn’t the sort of place Mycroft wanted Rosie to visit.  Ever.  Though it tempted Mycroft to be sullen, this wasn’t the time.  “Now, might we move on?”
“I want you to bond me this time.” John removed his fingers, stood on his knees and braced himself against the headboard. Slick ran down the back of his thighs. “I need it.”
“I can feel my spunk in you still,” John mused. “You’re sticky with it. I wish I could show you how good it feels to have an Alpha’s come inside you. But, you’re mine now. No Alpha sex for you.” John’s fingers felt cool on Sherlock’s overheated skin. Sherlock stroked John’s stomach, which was spattered with his own release. “I think we’re going to need the bed clothes changed again.”
John had fought his hormonal desires and pulled away from the horrid dildo, little by little. It was almost free when Mary, lost in John’s scent, pushed it back in. John collapsed face first on the bed, pinned like a butterfly as she pushed the toy deep inside him.
“Only if you do something for me,” Piero said. He now wore a silky lounge suit. He still had a very large penis.  “You put in good words with Charles for me after.  Normal people or not, it would be good to work in a nicer place.”
“I’m not as sure,” John replied.  “And you’ve put me in charge and I’ve decided we need help.  You’re not the only one who does research, Sherlock.”
“Food. Then come back. I think I can rinse, but I’m not sure I can get out of the bath.” John looked up at him, his hair lathered into a point, like Mr Whippy ice-cream.
“This way, Mr Tyler. I remembered you saying that you found the film room exciting. Fabian is very keen to meet you.”
John attempted to crawl inside Sherlock’s t-shirt.  His neck hurt from clenching his teeth to stifle laughter.
“How about we try and if it’s not good today, we’ll leave it.” John teased Sherlock’s nipples with his fingers. Whether this was a good day or not, John didn’t want Sherlock to become tense due to their conversation.  “No matter what, there are still lots of things I’d like to do with you, Sherlock.”
The Milton Keynes constituency is split into two: Milton Keynes North and Milton Keynes South. I have kept this as just Milton Keynes – a non-existent constituency in its entirety - to make it clear that Stephen Daniels is not even remotely connecting to any past or current MP in Great Britain, let alone Milton Keynes.  Interestingly, but unrelated, Iain Steward is MP for MK South and he is openly gay. Hilariously, one of the links on his Wiki page links to a website that sells sex toys and features pictures of scantily clad ladies.
“I think I figured that out,” John finished. His knees trembled with need, even though he didn’t want to use the bloody chair. He turned it on.
John opened an eye.  Anthrax was good at pole dancing.  He spun in a wide arc, the pole gripped firmly between his knees.
He took his drink over to the desk, opened his laptop and started to write a blog post he didn’t intend to publish.
“I also know that soaking it overnight works just as well as ten minutes of scrubbing,” Sherlock replied.  “So, leave it in the sink and come to bed.” He started to tug at John’s belt.
“Go on, talk dirty to me some more.” John grinned. Sherlock closed his eyes. When he opened them, John fully failed to hold in his laughter.
“I can re-arrest Tyler for suspicion, but I’m going to need evidence,” Lestrade noted.  “He’s been a good boy and helped with our enquiries.  If he’s not innocent, then he’s an arrogant fuck-head and I want him banged up.”
John grinned.  Some women would be horrified that their so-called straight husband was going to get together with his male best-mate after their death.  Not Mary.
“But not with Sherlock.” John shook his head. “No one wants Sherlock to find love more than me, but I’m not the person to be that for him. Not anymore. I need to just settle down and worry about what’s right for Rosie.”
"I think if that's a proposal, it’s dreadfully underwhelming," Sherlock replied.  He turned to face John. "Is it too early?"
“And you saw the value of it,” John said.  “And you helped Rosie and me see it.  Thank you.  That’s all.”   John stepped back.
“Oh, fucking fuck, yes.” John didn’t know whether to thrust up into Sherlock’s mouth or back against the dildo, so he simply writhed on the sheets. Sherlock fucked and sucked him lazily until John was utterly incoherent, and then Sherlock stopped.
Sherlock smiled. “Think you might have mentioned it,” he said.  “Oh! Rosie found something for you.” He looked at the little girl, still in John’s arms.  “Which pocket did I put it in?”   Rosie pointed to Sherlock’s right coat pocket.  Sherlock withdrew the object in a closed hand and passed it to her to give to her father.
There were three other men in the VIP lounge.  They were sitting on a long, black couch that faced a small, empty stage.  Right in front of them, to left of the stage, was a small bar. John glanced at the other VIPs.  One looked like a bloke from one reality show or other, but the other two men didn’t seem familiar. He smiled and followed Sherlock to the bar, hand still in his.
Jamie Reid was of medium height, had short gingery-blonde hair and pale skin. He was also very Scottish.  His accent was almost impenetrable.  To John, Jamie had an honest face.
Sherlock sat up a little, lifting John’s hips with him and, started to thrust properly. He started slow, but the rhythm built as he watched John’s expression change from a man in control to a man consumed by what Sherlock was doing. John’s hand on his cock got faster as the tempo built, and sweat started to make John’s skin glow.
“Mycroft ate all the cake, John.” Sherlock lifted the plate to sniff the crumbs.  “Madeira cake.  Mrs Hudson’s favourite.  I will have to inform her that you didn’t save any for her.”
“Fine.” Sherlock exhaled.  No new information. That was irritating. The fact that Sherlock had sat in this room and listened to him and John talk extensively about his back passage and he’d got nothing from it, was thoroughly irritating.
“Ready,” Sherlock agreed. John eased his hips back slowly and then, as if his control had already ceased, he drove back in fast and deep.  “Yes, John.” Sherlock tensed as John’s cock found just the right spot. “There, again, please, again.” Sherlock was rewarded with another slow drag out and another deep, accurate thrust in. “I’ve wanted you to fuck me for so long. So long. Yes! Yes!” John rocked against that point of pleasure, and Sherlock grabbed and clutched any part of John he could reach. “It’s terrific, John. Your cock is perfect, perfect. Oh, yes, harder, John, please.”
Mentally, John coloured Fabian’s brown eyes into that greyish-bluey-green colour he knew so well.  A sharp suck cleared his mind.  Fabian might not be the world’s only consulting detective, but he was world-class at giving blowjobs.  John tilted his head up and opened his eyes. The ornate, white ceiling was a long way above him. This really was a beautiful building for a whore-house
It was, at worst, a ten-minute journey by road from Baker Street, but this had taken half of that time. Sherlock was glad the journey was over. The Ambulance Tech opened up the back doors. For the first time, he seemed to notice Sherlock.
“Fake cock never feels like real cock.” John’s movements sped up and now the cutlery drawer rattled above the cupboard. “I couldn’t wait though, Sherlock; I’m so sorry.”
Sherlock nodded. He knew his brow was furrowed and that he probably looked as concerned as he felt. However, since he and John had just been discussing having sex with each other, a certain amount of emotional candour was appropriate.
John shrugged. His body made its demands clear and it didn’t involve food. “’Kay,” he agreed in the end. Dr Marshall removed Sherlock’s drips and made her apologies. Her place in the room was swiftly replaced by a muscular porter called Jacob. John started to lift the covers, but Jacob halted his movements.
Sherlock staggered on legs that really didn’t want to work to the bathroom.  He was accompanied by John who took two steps, then clutched him for support.  When they reached the shower, John leant against the wall and let Sherlock wash his hair and body. Sherlock carefully cleaned John’s cock, which gave a hopeful twitch but remained limp.  John turned at Sherlock’s request and moaned as his bum was soaped clean.
“I need to lay down,” John said, voice low. “My thighs are shaking.” He climbed over, flopped onto his back and, in doing so, his mattress made an unfortunately flatulent noise. “That wasn’t me.”
John laughed.  He had a vision of him attempting to fight someone off with his backside.  His laugh turned to giggles and then he was bent double. Tears rolled down his face. He looked at Sherlock, who just stood looking bemused.  John laughed so much, he didn’t even spot the taxi that drew up.   Sherlock guided him into the car. “I’m sorry,” he said between gasps for air.
Nathan sat down on the floor at their feet.  “Just relax,” he said.  “I’ve seen every single embarrassing thing that can happen in the bedroom. I’ve done most of ‘em.  It’s my job and it’s life, baby. So, this here is a circle of trust, you know that expression?”  Sherlock felt his face set like stone.  Nathan noticed and smiled. “I know it’s a cliché, but like Dr Watson, here, I maintain the privacy of my clients.  My oath isn’t formal, but it means as much to me as the Hippocratic oath means to John.”
“Where’s John Watson?”  Sherlock’s voice and the click of his heels on marble cut through the hum of activity.  “John?  John!”  Sherlock skirted the blood and stood before him.  “Is there somewhere we can talk?”
Sherlock has never seen Lestrade so angry. His grey hair stood in sharp contrast to his red, almost purple face.
Sherlock’s right hand and John’s left were stretched across their bodies.   Their fingers were entangled until, with no apparent reason, Sherlock’s hand moved to John’s cheek and they kissed with utterly sickening wet noises. Then John’s hand strayed to the front of Sherlock’s shirt. Mycroft heard his brother’s breath hitch and saw him tilt his head to rest on John’s.   Was that a nipple flick?  Mycroft angled his hip to face the side of the helicopter more. Annoyingly, he still saw them reflected in the window.
John and Sherlock have bedtime fun. And there's some care and love, a little bit of plot, and some plans are made.  But mostly, there is sex.
Sherlock had reached beneath the bed and pulled out one of John’s stolen shirts. He’d buried his head in the brushed cotton and inhaled in the scent of the man he had long loved.
Sharan crawled up off the floor and opened the outside door of her cab.  She jumped down and reached up to take Rosie’s seat.  John jumped down beside her, took Rosie’s seat and looked down the length of the train’s exterior.
“But, once I knew that, John, then I’d look up how much lubricant an Omega produces. Then we’d know how much stuff you’ve got inside you.”
“Do you guys use toys?” Nathan asked.  “I struggle to come without something in my booty these days, because I use anal toys so much. Just the feeling of fullness works for me.”
“My heat’s due any day.” Ian had been desperate, Sherlock realised. What did it matter? Sherlock was too. “Jesus, you feel good. So fucking good.” Ian had ridden him fast straight away.
Sherlock’s heart broke. John Watson, the toughest, most perfect Omega Sherlock Holmes had ever met, was exhausted and sore from the ravages of heat. In the midst of it, he’d taken a trip to the hospital, and suffered embarrassment and discomfort. Sherlock’s penis throbbed and his backside spasmed at the loss of John’s ministrations, but he decided he was made of stronger stuff. He could control his desire. He closed his eyes and thought of the most unattractive thing he could, but still his dick remained stubbornly hard. He meditated. His cock didn’t shrivel a millimetre. Sherlock kissed John’s forehead and closed his eyes. Slowly, the sheer exhaustion of the day drifted Sherlock into uneasy sleep.
A taped drumroll sounded and a man walked onto the small stage area.  He wore a pair of silver spandex trousers and some ballet shoes.  A pole dropped from the ceiling.  The man bowed.  ‘Careless Whisper’ crackled through the speakers and the man swayed, off-time.
“Do you wish I was a woman?” Sherlock asked. It was one of those knee-jerk questions that he’d never wanted to ask. A fairly dull pair of pale blue lacy knickers had forced it out of him.
“I’ll just crack on then, shall I?”  John waited for Sherlock’s nod and then turned the toy on at its lowest setting.   The noise that came from Sherlock also started low and grew louder.   His thighs shook and his hips thrust into thin air.   John lubed his hand and wrapped it around Sherlock’s cock.
Rosie’s car seat was already in place and Mycroft took her from Sherlock’s arms to strap her into the car.  Sherlock climbed into the black Jag next to her.  Once Mycroft was seated, the driver steered the car out of the hospital complex and onto London’s streets.
“Good?” Sherlock managed to ask. He looked at John beneath him. His face was free of the lines age and recent events had etched into his skin. That was mostly because his face was taut in an open-mouthed picture of pleasure, his blue eyes deep and dark, his hair a tangle of silver. Sherlock set up something of a rhythm, though his hips stuttered at times, almost always when John’s quick pink tongue licked his lips, or the man smiled up at him, bottom lip between his teeth. It seemed ridiculous that those simple expressions could create such a reaction, but that was simply the way it was.
“We’re a bit bad at this, aren’t we?” Sherlock sighed.  The line between real and not real was difficult.  He started to feel the need for some assistance. “Come on in.”
“John,” Sherlock said. His arms trembled. Without a second thought, John wedged one foot against the bed and tipped them over. “John?” Sherlock’s eyes widened with surprise. John sat up a little, wrapped a hand around Sherlock’s dick, and led it back to his hole. He sank down, down until his balls brushed Sherlock’s thighs.
John smiled. “Sherlock’s brother runs the country, Piero. I think he can figure out how to keep you safe.”
“Fuck.” By the time Sherlock looked up, John had closed his eyes again. “Fuck,” John said again. Sherlock fucked himself with a single finger.
“Where she always was, Johnny.  You can love more than one person at a time.  Besides, you cock, you fell in love with her pretty quick after Sherlock died. You didn’t worry about that, did you?”
“I’ve already been asked this,” Langridge replied.  “Yes, we do.  Brandon Cox wasn’t allergic to Latex or any of the common ingredients found in the kind of lubricant we stock here.”
“I’ve had things up my arse.” John stroked Sherlock’s leg and his own dick with increasing speed.  “Never a real cock though. Waited for you.”
“Bite me again,” John said. “I want you to.” Sherlock grazed his teeth along the old wound. John’s skin gave a little and left a coppery taste on Sherlock’s tongue. He yelled when his body was overtaken by another wave of pleasure.
Sherlock hooks up with a man from Grindr (previous to when this fic is set). John and Sherlock get it on. Essentially, they will do this a lot. In this ep, they do bonding.
“Sherlock, we’ve got to see that Shirley woman in an hour,” John’s voice filtered through the door.  “You need to get your arse up. I hope you’re decent because I’m going to bring you in a cup of coffee in a minute.”
“Och, they apparently do what we do but they’re no’ as classy as we are,” Shirley replied.  “They don’t offer anywhere near the amount of services we do.  All our boys have access to sexual health nurses and testing, prophylactics and the like.  They don’t at Doubles.  I only know that because Brandon told me all about it.  Oh, that reminds me, here’s the list of Brandon’s clients and the ones he saw with Justin.  Brandon was a lovely boy.  But he worked at Doubles before he came here, you know.   The stories he told. He wasn’t the only lad who moved over here, either.  If I were you, Mr Holmes, I’d go take a wee look at Doubles.”
Both Murphy and the stranger were dressed in robes.  The stranger opened his and exposed his long, thick cock.  Murphy pressed a condom and tube of lube into his hand.  As soon as he was slicked up, he pushed into Reid’s body.  Sherlock went cold; the stranger had done nothing to prepare Reid and there was some discomfort in Reid’s expression. However, the pained look faded.  Sherlock expected that the men who worked at Langridge’s prepared themselves over the course of an evening.  It still left Sherlock chilled.
Sherlock nodded and hung up.   He picked up his computer and went to John’s blog.  ‘Sherlock Holmes loves me…’ the post began. He read until the end. Then he read the comments.  Some people were delighted, others shocked.  Sherlock was certain that was bad news from his point of view.  He took out his mobile and texted John, then he made himself coffee and had a shower.  When he re-emerged, Mycroft was sitting in John’s chair reading the letter.
There was a pause.  John let go of Sherlock and ended their kiss.  “Right,” he murmured against Sherlock’s chest.
Mycroft Holmes knew he wasn’t popular when he walked into 221B Baker Street.  Even Mrs Hudson looked at him as if he had done something unpleasant in her slipper.  However, he’d promised to bring the equipment needed for the drugs bust with him.  Since the loan of the equipment wasn’t entirely official, it was best that he delivered it himself.
“I’ve eaten a lot of things out of a cup. And a mess tin. Shoe horns make decent spoons in a pinch.” John took a sip of tea. “And I’ve eaten in the bath and in the shower. Trickier in the shower. You have to hold your toast at arm’s length.”
The room was a riot of colour.  The ceiling was painted gold, the floor was navy and the walls were covered in multi-coloured abstract shapes.  The bedding was yellow and orange and the chairs they sat on were red.
“’Course you do.” John smiled and stroked Sherlock’s cheek. “I would’ve lasted longer if you hadn’t begged me to come all over you.  That sounds a bit wrong. It was bloody sexy though.”
Sherlock had passively waited for Ian to find the foil wrappers, strip off one condom and roll on another.
Sherlock humphed before he stopped himself. John laughed.  Sherlock grinned.  “Okay, so where do we start?”
“Just go with me for now.” Sherlock wrapped an arm around John’s waist and tugged them both into a crouch. “After three, stand up. One-two-three.” Sherlock kept himself at John’s pace and bent his knees to adjust for their height difference. Even though John stumbled, they made it to their feet. “Now, Captain Watson, it’s time for you to lead the march.”
Sherlock nodded again.   Before he turned off the light, the darkness crept in, even in his room where pictures and polished furniture refracted the light from the street below into fractured slivers.  The past was coming back to haunt Sherlock.  All he could hope was that it didn’t swallow John too.
Sherlock shoulder charged the door. It hadn’t been shut properly, so it flew open easily. Sherlock landed in a heap half on and half off the bed. The momentum ensured his dressing gown wafted up and bared his pale, white arse.  It was not the most dignified entrance he’d ever made.  He looked up. John and Nathan stood, fully clothed, next to his chest of drawers.  Nathan was rubbing lube into his forearm.  John had a pair of Sherlock’s pants over his mouth. They both smirked.
“Anonymous voyeurism,” Sherlock noted.  When they walked back out into the central corridor, they noted two more doors at the very end of the corridor.  One was marked fire exit and, again, led onto a landing and a stairway down to the lower floors. Lestrade said he’d noted where the steps ended on his previous jaunt downstairs and was confident his officers would block egress on the night.
The other door led to a narrower corridor and a row of cubicles. Inside the cubicles were long benches, so men could lie on them and poke their backsides into the cottage corridor.
“Leave Daniels to me,” Mycroft replied. “I’ll convince him to return to the UK.  I’ll also suggest to Lestrade that Murphy returns to London immediately for questioning.  Let me know if you uncover any further suspects, will you?”
), and hands that were once on shoulders drifted down and charted new territory again; warm sleep-soaked palms and silky fingertips moved lower, those eager hands finally wrapped around each other’s ever-more interested cocks and John stroked Sherlock the way he liked, Sherlock learned fast, he mirrored deft fingers that pulled foreskin over glans, and, in willing response, they grunted into each other’s mouths and rutted against each other until the kiss turned rough, those grunts turned to cries, controlled strokes turned into frenzied tugs, harder, faster, (now, now,
“Do you think you could keep your eyes and ears open?  Maybe ask around?”  John was almost fully dressed now.
“But he was allergic to ibuprofen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, wasn’t he?”  Sherlock asked.  Langridge nodded.  “Lestrade, when you run tests on the lubricant, you will find that the bottle contains ibuprofen gel.  Now, we need a list of all the people in this building who were present tonight and for the death of Jason. I’d also like the names of those who knew Brandon had an ibuprofen allergy.”
“Keeps dropping it,” Sharan replied.  Several shots were fired. Sharan risked another look. “No way! There are blokes coming down from the helicopters on ropes.”
“I hate this bloody thing!” John threw the dildo and it bounced off the wall, then hit the floor with a heavy thump. “It’s a horrible monster cock and I don’t want you to be that big.  Never. Ever.”
“Daniels is conflicted with regards his homosexuality.”  Sherlock looked intently at Lestrade.  His deductions were practically dirty talk to John.  “It’s likely his drug use lead to psychosis, paranoia and hallucinations.  Yesterday, I noted from the marks on his trousers and the wear pattern on his shoes, that he has regular pain in his right leg, probably arthritis in the knee. One form of treatment would be ibuprofen gel or something similar; make a search of his home and office and I’m confident something of that nature will turn up.”  Sherlock took a deep breath.  “Brandon Cox specialised in very public, exhibitionist sex.  Daniels was both attracted to and scared by it.  One of the agents who handcuffed him told us that there were existing handcuff marks on Daniels’ wrists. He’s been in cuffs before.”
Mycroft waved a hand dismissively. “What about the boyfriend, actually?  Surely he’s the chief suspect?”
John swallowed as best he could. He let Sherlock’s cock drop from his lips and milked the last spurts of ejaculate with his hand. He licked up the remnants until, quite suddenly, he found himself pushed backward.  Sherlock kissed him with a fervour that took John’s breath away.
The paramedics attempted to talk to John. Although he’d stopped vomiting, the pain in his abdomen was so severe after retching he just gasped and tried to breath.  John was barely aware of anything until he was loaded into the ambulance.
“You do know who…” Mycroft began.  Before he could say more, a woman in a ridiculous tartan suit walked in.  She gave Sherlock a limp handshake and ignored Rosie altogether.
“Nothing, well not nothing.” Lestrade sounded hesitant and uncomfortable.  “Look, have you seen John’s blog post this morning?”
“Fuck, but what if we get carried away?”  John asked.  “You know what new relationships are like when you’re all over each other.”
“If there’s going to be slapping, perhaps we should have a safe-word.” Sherlock was so close his words ghosted across John’s lips. He swallowed and looked at Sherlock’s mouth. He was going to kiss Sherlock fucking Holmes. His lips opened…
“I’ve studied it. I also look after her when you’re at work. If we’re here together then you’re normally pottering around or whatever, so I just make sure she keeps to her routine. If we’re out, then Mrs Hudson makes sure she does.”
“So, you two get to take charge of what you do. You need to make the right noises and expose a bit of skin. No one’s expecting you to bum Sherlock senseless in the blackout room.”
“They lead to the back exit,” Lestrade said when he could talk.  “I’ll get some men stationed out there on the night.”
“I’m so hard, John, I could do press-ups hands-free,” Sherlock replied.  He rubbed his cock against John’s hip to prove the point and left a trail of precome across the skin.  “I need you.”
I forgot to say, one of the reasons I wrote this fic is because I feel like I'm still trying to get my groove back in terms of writing smut. I got plot-blocked with the follow-up to Double or Nothing, so I wrote this to make sure that I was at least getting some useful practise in. That's what I'm telling myself and you can't stop me.
“Was me just turning up like this a bad idea?” John asked. He turned Sherlock a little so he could look at a graze on the inside of Sherlock’s knee. “This feels a bit awkward.”
Sherlock was used to not sleeping much when he was involved with a case.  Somehow, the continuance and constancy of his mental processes seemed to arrive at a resolution far faster than the off-and-on repetitiveness of prescribed times to be awake or asleep.   Many of his hours of thought were, in their own way, an approximation of a restful state like meditation which, in Sherlock’s opinion, was just as useful as sleep for restoring peak mental faculties.
“Besides, what’s the point if you’re not with me?” Sherlock asked. “Speaking of which, I’m surprised your heat hasn’t driven you mad already.” John didn’t speak, he just took Sherlock’s hand and led it to his groin. His cock was hard beneath the warm water. “Ah. We’ll get on with eating, shall we?”
John’s hand dropped down between Sherlock’s legs and took his fully erect cock in his grasp. Sherlock looked down and watched John’s mouth and hand work on him. John caught his eye.  “Have I told you how fucking hot you are?” He scrambled to his knees and reached for Sherlock’s bedside table. Lube bottle in hand, he knelt back down on the bed between Sherlock’s legs.  John squeezed some of the liquid into his hand and reached back to prepare himself.
At the bottom of the box was a brown, manila envelope. John opened the envelope and removed a number of photographs.   He went through them and dropped them on the table.
“You run the bath, I’ll call for service,” John replied. He sat up and pulled a face when he did. “Sometimes, gravity is a complete bastard.”
“Look, I’m not fourteen or some blushing schoolboy,” John replied. “Rosie, darling, don’t rub it in your hair.”
John chuckled. “You know, I rather like you, Mr Holmes.” He pulled Sherlock towards him for a long, lingering kiss.
“I’m sorry, John,” Sherlock said.  “If I’d have known, I would have insisted that we had the safe deposit key earlier.”
“Only to stop myself from burying my face between your arse-cheeks and licking the spunk out of you.” John’s mouth was so close now to Sherlock’s ear that he could feel the moisture of the words on his skin. “And that was the gayest thought I’d ever had in my life at that point. It scared me.”
To John’s surprise, their suggestion was greeted warmly. He wondered if Lestrade had given Sherlock a hard talk while he and Sally chatted.
“Okay, let’s moob.” Sherlock removed his dressing gown.  Nathan took a quick inhale as he saw the network of scars on Sherlock’s back.  “Steady.” Sherlock wagged a finger.  “John will get jealous.”
John relented and grasped Sherlock’s balls to roll and tug at them gently.   He kissed along the top edge of his pubic hair.  The skin was salty with perspiration, warm and musky. Sherlock, who lifted his hips with every touch, poked John in the eye with his penis.
Oh, and I've been reading 'Rosethorne' by Suitesamba (I don't know how to do links and things) lately and loving it. So I'm recommending it for y'all.
“We’ll be seeing Mr Tyler at eight-thirty.  If you have any information before then, you will let me know, won’t you?”  Sherlock stood.  John followed his lead.
“It says it is,” John admitted.  He unzipped the evidence bag and sniffed it, then passed it to Sherlock to do the same.
“That may be, brother dear, but I’m annoying and have your adoption papers to sign as well as your marriage license.”
“Do you want me, John?” Sherlock had asked as he took off his suit jacket and draped it over some boxes. “Do you want me to fuck you?”
“Are you well?” he asked.  “I heard that you found the man who killed Jason. I can’t thank you all enough.”  He released John and threw his arms around Sherlock who stood rigid as he was embraced. Sherlock rolled his eyes, but a faint blush spread across his cheeks.  He was, John knew, rather touched by Simon’s effusive thanks.   Even Lestrade allowed himself to be pulled into Simon’s arms.
He had to pull his mouth from John’s cock for a moment when he pressed his fingers inside himself. The moan was obvious. It’d been a while. Sherlock took a few deep breaths and reached out again for John’s penis.
Sherlock’s eyes had involuntarily opened wide to look up at the black lightbulb through checked fabric. If John had been there, he certainly wouldn’t have called Sherlock baby or honey. Out of character. Sherlock’s arousal had faded, but he waited for Ian to grunt his release, even though the splatter of semen on his skin made him shudder. Sherlock felt dirty. Guilty. Tarnished.
Sherlock nodded and sat down. That was eager; was it too eager? Why weren’t his fucking shoelaces undoing,
Sherlock tipped John over onto his back and the movement pulled his dick free.  Sherlock scooped the come from his chest and slicked it over his cock before he pressed it back inside John.  Sherlock hitched one of John’s legs over his shoulder.  John’s body twitched from his orgasm but his eyes opened when Sherlock thrust inside of him.  The combination of lube and spunk made a slick noise with each drive of his hips.  Sherlock didn’t try to hold off his orgasm.  He was overtaken by the tight heat spreading in his groin.
Stephen Daniels stared at the spy and his cover story, or whatever the brat was.  They’d boarded the train at Guildford.   The spy pretended not to see him.  But Stephen saw him.  An internal voice he vaguely recognised as rational told him to stay calm. It was all okay.
Rosie began to cry harder.  She reached out to her father, who raised an arm to her.  “Addeee,” she sobbed.
“Lube.” John stuck out his tongue and licked the back of his own hand. “Lube’s brilliant and everything, but why does it have to taste like that? Uerch.”
“I never really went in there,” John said. “Simon gave me a tour of the club when I joined. I remember it because it was like the rooms they used in army training to disorientate you. The only bit which is truly blackout is the central bit with the sex swing. Apparently, it’s an arse to get into the swing in the dark but people manage it.”
Sherlock had to agree. Sex between him and John was intense but this consumed him. With his body in control, Sherlock’s mind simply centred to the part of him that was inside John and connected them. From his prone position, John’s eyes blazed and followed every move Sherlock made. Sherlock couldn’t look away. London may have been around them, but it seemed a million miles away from the small world of John and Sherlock’s bed.
“It’s okay,” John told him. “We’re at a private clinic and apparently, if I need it, there’s that thing.” John pointed to the blanketed seat. “I’ve never been more worried about a chair in my life.”
“Dark hair but going bald, he was quite thin and he was in a suit. He kept demanding to see Charles and kept asking people if they knew who he was.  Simon came and calmed him down and he went off with someone else.”
Sherlock nodded.  “We start in the morning.  You need sleep and I need to speak to Lestrade. Go home, John, put your daughter to bed and help me tomorrow.  We’ll solve this.”
When John lived at 221B in the pre-Mary years, he indulged in sexual practices with his girlfriends.  By careful analysis of the sounds that emanated from his room during coitus, Sherlock had deduced that John was a successful and considerate lover.  Therefore, if he were to initiate a sexual relationship with John Watson, there was a good chance that Sherlock would be sexually satisfied by proceedings.   There was good evidence that John was capable of deep regard for those he loved. After all, few people voluntarily put up with Sherlock for as long as John Watson.  However, prior to Mary, John had been unable to maintain a long-term relationship.  After his marriage, he’d admitted to having an affair, albeit one stage-managed by Eurus and devoid of sexual intercourse.  So, what conclusion should Sherlock draw from these details?
“Ten years,” Candlar replied. “I’ve wanted to be a member since well before that, though. Do you know the history?”
Lestrade ran his hands through his hair. “Look, mate, is there anything else you can think of that will help us?  It is a murder enquiry and you are one of several suspects, so it’s worth your while telling us if there’s anything you can think of.”
“I want you to eat a banana and drink your tea.” John lined up the fake cock against his arse. “By the time you’re done, I’ll be ready for you.”  John sank back on the dildo with a long sigh.
“Well, me and Sh-Aaron don’t have sex!”  John stroked Sherlock’s back.  He snuck a sneaky look at Sherlock’s body.  His skin was smooth, save for the mess of scars from his ‘dead’ years. His pants were black and didn’t give much away.
“There won’t be another visit, Charles,” John said. He shifted in his seat. “Jason’s death has made me, um, reassess.”
“What can you tell us about Lesley Shaw?”  Sherlock asked.  He was spinning a sugar lump held between his thumb and forefinger.
“I really need to teach you about romance,” John said as he clambered to his knees. “There were much sexier ways of saying that.”
This wasn’t the first time Sherlock had thought about John’s sex life.  Male sexual preferences were fairly consistent, and, as far as he’d seen, John never exhibited any tell-tale sights of an indulgence in S&M or other fetishes. The most risqué thing Sherlock had deduced about John was from his gait one morning following a night spent with Mary prior to the wedding.   Yes, his walk that day had made Sherlock excuse himself to escape down to the basement on some pretext or other. He’d pressed himself against the cool, damp wall and relieved himself with brusque efficiency.
Rosie was tired and clearly rather stressed. Sherlock took her to the cafeteria and fed her Victoria Sponge and a drink that was suspiciously too orange.  He ate dry Bakewell Tart and drank ghastly tea.
Without warning, the film screen flickered to life behind them.  The light above the bed pit came on.
John looked at Sherlock, aghast.  “There’s no way Piero could be involved in this, right? I mean, if it’s him, he really doesn’t seem like a killer.”
Before Jason’s murder, Sherlock had been unaware that John Watson had even considered having sex with another man, let alone him.   Recent circumstances made it clear that not only did John Watson enjoy sexual congress with men, but that he did so with men who resembled Sherlock.  Ergo, it was likely that John Watson did, in fact, want to have sex with Sherlock Holmes.   In the past, when other potential mates had offered him the possibility of sexual union, Sherlock had been uninterested.   Sherlock was very interested in sexual union with John Watson.  His brain was interested, his emotions were interested and, perhaps most disturbingly of all, his cock was thoroughly interested.
“In a way, I’ve sort of missed this,” John replied.  “I love you in all your moods, but there was a part of me that was worried that you were going to try and be perfect forever.  I remember doing it when I was with my first few girlfriends. It never works. It’s your only tell, in a way. I could almost believe you’ve been dating for the past twenty or so years if you weren’t trying so hard to be so fucking wonderful.  It’s nice to have you back, even if you are an arse.”
“We’re in the kitchen, Sherlock,” John said. He rolled his eyes, even though his lips betrayed his amusement. “It’s unhygienic and I’ve already got plenty to mop-up.” He motioned to the disreputable kitchen floor. “Get your gorgeous arse up and help me clean up. Then we can prep your bedroom, or mine, so you can do and see what you want.”
“John?”  Mycroft appeared beside him.  “Duncan here is going to take your statement and your clothes.  Can I get Mrs Hudson, perhaps, to bring you a change of clothing?”
“I made that complaint on the understanding you would be discrete,” Sherlock said. He winked at John.
A loving start gives was to Sherlock having a rough night and a complete strop or two.  Mycroft drops a clanger and the boys prepare for the big sting operation at Langridge's.
John’s movements lost their rhythm.  He tried to continue even though he was clearly on the edge.  His arse clenched, his body jerked and his hips stuttered to a stop. Come splattered Sherlock’s torso in wide arcs.
John’s eyes rolled back in his head, he cried out and came against Sherlock’s cock. The added lube and the visual of John’s beatific expression did for Sherlock too.
“No,” John replied.  “Saw something. Dunno what.”  His voice was cut off by another shower of glass. This time, the projectile was clear since the brick was tangled in the curtains.  Sherlock grabbed it, read the note tied to it and turned it towards John. “’Drop the case’,” he read aloud.  “Do you think this is from the Marquês?” John asked Sherlock.
“Well, this is getting ridiculous.” John lifted his hand to inspect his fingernails. “Did I tell you I’d paid your gas bill?”
“Come for me,” John whispered.   His eyes were only half-open, lost to the momentary shudders that still claimed him.  “I want to feel you come in me.”    Sherlock’s hips moved of their own accord as they bucked against John.  He wanted to look away, embarrassed by the emotion he knew he would show, but he couldn’t.   John squeezed tight around him and Sherlock was lost. He came with a hard thrust, his cock buried deep.  For a moment, everything was bright, roaring silence but, slowly, the sounds of his breath and John’s touch started to drift in.
Sherlock only partly paid attention to Tyler.  He watched Fabian, the other man this evening had been designed to test.  When Tyler pulled out, Fabian pushed Jamie from his crotch and climbed from the pit.   Surrounded by groaning men, he ran for the pole dancing area.  Sherlock, who’d lost his interest in the sex when John left the room, jumped up and after Fabian in a matter of moments.  He rugby-tackled the Frenchman a quarter of the way into the dancing area and quickly straddled him.
“Please, John,” Sherlock whispered in between kisses.  “I need you.”   His hands roamed down John’s back and he squeezed his tight backside. John jumped a little and wriggled away. He moved down Sherlock’s body until his mouth was level with his chest, then swirled his tongue around one nipple. Sherlock gasped and carded his fingers through John’s hair.  He pushed his chest towards John’s mouth and was rewarded with a long suck.
“Oh yeah, oh yes, yes, yes.” John clutched at the sheets and his eyes rolled back in his head. John’s body seemed to vibrate with what Sherlock assumed was pressure against his prostate. “Don’t you dare fucking move, don’t you dare fucking stop and don’t you dare fucking slow down.” John’s hand, still wrapped around his own penis, was a blur. A crisis was coming. A good one.
“And what sort of amounts of drugs do we think we’re looking at?” Lestrade asked.  “I don’t want to be a cock, but the National Crime Agency and the Drugs Squad are going to want in on this.”
“Lift your knee,” Sherlock instructed. “And stick your bum out.” Sherlock encouraged John into the right position, and then pulled back and thrust back in. “How’s that?”
Sherlock and John undertake couples therapy (in their pants, obviously) at Doubles, a rival brothel to Langridge's.  After some home truths, John hides and Sherlock is perturbed.  The following day, they have a break through in the case and a suspect emerges.  They go back to Langridge's to enlist the help of a certain Frenchman.  From there, they go see Mycroft. Is their suspect really who he says he is?
“Best go to the bedroom though, eh?” John climbed out of the bath. “I think we’re going to be very sleepy afterwards.” John wrapped a towel around himself and held out one for Sherlock. When Sherlock wobbled, John held out another hand and helped him climb out of the bath. Sherlock blushed. John pinched his arse. “Come on then, you long drink of brainy stuff.”
“Please.” Sherlock walked into the kitchen behind John.  “Can I ask you a question?  I am afraid it might be too personal, but I find myself unable to focus on the case.”
“Well, you deserve a better me. A me that knows how to give a blow-job, who doesn’t run away afterwards, and who actually thinks about having a relationship with you, not just sex.”
“What might I deduce, John, from your current position and state of undress?” Sherlock asked. He took off his jacket and hung it in his wardrobe.  If his fingers shook, he certainly wasn’t going to tell John.
“Please do,” Sherlock replied. He leant forward in his chair.  He was sure he knew already, but it would only help Piero if he gave up the information willingly.
“What would you like, John?” Sherlock turned his head and kissed John’s palm. His voice was almost breathless and thick with desire. “Do you like your Alphas to rub their seed on you to scent you? Do you like them to bite you? Or fill you and plug their release inside you for hours?”
“Would you like to cover me with your come, John?” Sherlock’s eyes flashed in the dim light. “Scent me as yours. Mark me so everyone knows?”
John has a wodge of cash and a nervous boyfriend to sort out, and has enlisted Mycroft's help.  What on earth could go wrong?
“’Course,” John agreed.  Sally walked over, a strange expression on her face. She looked embarrassed, mostly.   She touched John’s elbow and then walked over to Fabian, who smiled at John as he was led away.
“I’ll make sure of it, Mr Holmes,” Langridge agreed.  “I want my club open again as soon as possible.  That makes you and your insufferable questions a necessary evil.”
Lestrade grumbled but signed the paper, as did Sherlock and John. If they imagined then that their questions would be answered, however, they were wrong.
“You’re such a fucking diva, Sherlock Holmes.” John slid his hands down Sherlock’s chest, over his nipples and down to his waist.    “How about a little prostate massage?” John felt Sherlock tense as much as saw it in his face.  “What?”
“God, yes.” Sherlock sank into John’s body desperate for redemption, desperate to get deeper. With a few firmer thrusts, his knot slipped inside John’s uterus.
Sherlock dropped his clothes in few scant seconds and then rifled through his bedside table for some lube. He hoped to convince John that perhaps anything was better than another blowjob.
“I don’t want to sound stupid,” Lestrade’s voice was hesitant and his speech peppered with ‘ums’ and ‘ers’.  “I know this is a bit inappropriate but, well, how much of you am I likely to see?”
“More lively than Langridge’s isn’t it?” Sherlock said in the chippy tone he’d adopted.  John nodded.
Most men came quickly.  Older men took a while longer.  All the same, Lestrade was sure that, at home with a loved one, most gents would take more time.   At Langridge’s, the whole act was swift and business-like.
John sighed. It was all Sherlock could offer him and all John could offer Sherlock. Neither of them had the ability to make fate change her mind. “Then that’s what we’ll work with.”
Tacked to the walls were paper signs with the words “Manager’s office” and hand-drawn arrows.    Sherlock and John simply followed the arrows and, as they did, they started to detect a tell-tale smell.  Sherlock hastened his movements.  The office was locked but, with John and Sherlock’s combined efforts, they forced the door.  Inside, at his desk, sat the body of Peter Matthews.  His head was tilted at an awkward angle, his skin was pasty grey and his arms hung limply from his shoulders.
“Sherlock!”   John flexed his hands and then curled them into tight fists.  “I don’t want to think about it.  I just want to know why my wife knew this man and kept it quiet from me.  I don’t think that’s too unreasonable a question.”
