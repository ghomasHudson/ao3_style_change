"Times change, Sherlock."
He flipped through the glossy brochure and finally made a choice that was admittedly solitary. The facility had a full-service fitness center and that seemed like as good a place as any to start and maybe disappear for awhile.
But it was all proving to be true. The giving, loving little boy Mycroft described sounded like precisely the genesis of the man whose arms now slid around John's waist and whose lips were immediately at his jaw line.
Screwing up his courage he started to type.
He'd then added a number for a local crime scene cleaner. The gun, the new gun that he'd gotten from a pawn shop, would cause a mess, there was no way to avoid that. He purchased tarps to help make things easier but...it was at that point that he'd started to realize it might be hard to sell a house with even a hint or memory of blood splatters no matter how well cleaned.
"Mmm." Sherlock said noncommittally. "My father is a quantum chemist with an interest in organic chemistry as well. He taught for many years at Cambridge, eventually retired after declining a departmental chair. Now he likes to do his little "scribblings" as he calls them. Of course, those scribblings are submitting papers to academic journals and working on of the three books he's writing. All this when he isn't misplacing his glasses."
“We’re you ever going to tell me you wanted this...any of this?”
"Yes, just like that. Well, it was off and on for awhile. Rather unpredictable but there's a great deal more stability to it at this point. So I'd say, spigot found. Are you...?"
Sherlock wasn't one to swear. He didn't have anything against it, it just wasn't his cup of tea. So, when he said things like that it was even more erotic than I expected.
"Detach?" John asked, already engrossed.
"How much, John?"
"I'm fine, Mrs. Hudson." He began as he gave himself one last glance in the mirror. Switching off the water he turned to exit the loo. "Just please do me a favour and don't tell-" He opened the door and came face to face with his partner. "Sherlock." He finished with a sigh.
John opened his mouth to apologize but only got so far as "I-"
Hi Sherlock,
Hi Sherlock,
"Still fighting then?"
"Sherlock, maybe you should-"
He pulled out his phone at a stoplight and dialed a rarely used number.
"You do? Well, I imagine the lights are where we last left them. We can dig out the box-"
"I...on occasion, yes."
But when he thought about it, this wasn't entirely true. That easy way he'd had in the beginning of slipping into bed, into Sherlock's arms and subsequently into dreams wasn't so easy anymore. He was still getting some hours in but not as many as before.
“Then act like an adult and do the work.” She said with finality. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”
. They're both so mouthy and careless and provocative. Always with the retorts. Always with the backchat. They can't help themselves, neither of them ever could. That's why I'm there! They both told me once...and I believe, I know they're right, that I'm attracted to the danger. That I live for it and crave it and feed off of it. Fine. Fair play. But then what are they attracted to? Hmm? Someone who pulls them back. Someone who grabs them by the collar or the ear and tells them to shut their goddamn mouths before they egg someone into shooting them! That's my job, ok? That is my duty! And I wasn't at post! I was derelict! Again! I wasn't at my post."
He'd heard two competing narratives in his life when in came to addiction, mostly about his sister.
The group laughed and Reggie gave him a round of applause which he found incredibly embarrassing.
It sounded both good and terrifying. Detox alone was awful. Detox with Sherlock wouldn't be nearly as lonely or frightening. But he really didn't want him to see him like that. A crying, shitting, puking mess. Half of a man. Not even a man, but a blubbering, weeping pathetic child.
"That's where we're starting? What about-"
Mrs. Hudson was the first person John ever saw Sherlock smile at. The first person he ever saw him embrace. His landlady, who he saw every day, he hugged her. He'd snapped at Mycroft on more than one occasion when he belittled her and once even threw him out of the flat. Mrs. Hudson who feeds him up. Feeds them both up, truth be told and brings Sherlock his tea and biscuits just like he liked them. Mrs. Hudson who fusses about not being their housekeep while keeping their house. Mrs. Hudson who'd hoped they'd be together and take care of one another. Mrs. Hudson for whom Sherlock had thrown a man who had dared lay a finger on her out of a window. Mrs. Hudson who he kisses on the cheek. Mrs. Hudson for whom he had a stern word with Mr. Chatterjee and warned him not to mess about with her heart anymore.
He came with a broken sort of cry, the sound echoing off the walls as he pumped into Sherlock's mouth. He watched through lidded eyes as his lover's hand worked rapidly just out of view before he too moaned low in his throat. John caresses his face through a few more nearly deepthroated sucks before pulling away and looking up devilishly licking his lips. He quickly tucked John back into his shorts, trousers and then zipped him up before doing the same for himself.
Hi Sherlock,
The world had felt infinite and small and everything that mattered was right there. Everything.
It was the same logic you used when a mysterious letter arrived in the post, or there was a voicemail from an unknown number.
"John Watson does not make friends easily."
"As I suspected, which means your constant apologizing and your unwillingness to let it go, is vanity, John."
"I'm fine." Sherlock said before he swallowed hard. "I was in bed...sleeping. I believe the knock on the door must have startled me."
"No. I'm going home."
Coming together, sharing that moment as one was never overrated and both John's hands returned to Sherlock's arse encouraging him with each erratic yet ebbing thrust.
"John, wait, please, just tell me-"
I appreciate Hanah's help. She's near the top of a very long list of people I need to apologize to. The more I think about it the longer the list grows.
"Jesus, you're beautiful." I said apropos of nothing and everything.
"You can't tell me anything I don't already know. You're not Jacob Marley and you're not going to tell me about three spirits come to visit me."
“We play ourselves. Or how we were years ago. One of us flirts with a stranger, prompting the other to get jealous and finally come to terms with their feelings.”
"You're smiling." She said quietly.
"I used to be this private person. There are days when I truly miss it." He said with a derisive little laugh. "Ok, I'll...talk to him. I will."
The "H" loosened up a bit the more I pressed it. Still going to bin this phone though. In fact, why wait? I'm off, we can grab dinner when I get back.
"I'm on it the second I leave here."
"I heard something I really liked in group today. Anger replicates easiest when it's unexamined. I think a lot of times anger is my default. It's my go to. I'm working on it. I just need you to know that."
"John, you look positively refreshed!" His mother exclaimed. "Healthy tone, good weight. I'm so glad to see you well."
"Yes, John." The detective said leaning back in his chair and crossing his long legs.
As always John was able to put him off then. And again two years later. And again a few years after that.
"You woke up gasping for it didn't you, Sherlock?" John asked.
John hadn't meant to but he gasped aloud but he couldn't help it.
"I deliver the mail, John. That was my main chore around these parts. He got an express and I tried his room multiple times but he was never there. I left all these little sticky notes that he'd have to rip off or break through to get inside but they were never disturbed. Finally, I caught him in the hallway once and was able to deliver it. He looked just a bit flustered when I said I'd been trying to track him down. Didn't know Sherlock Holmes could look flustered." James paused. "You know, everybody pretty much figured that was the way things were anyway."
Sherlock pushed himself in Donovan's direction. With one foot. Slowly. Twisting around his crew.
He walked to their quarters feeling very heavy. Wondering if all of this hadn't broken something, but deciding that borrowing trouble for the future made no sense.
Mollyhoo had her eye on one of the cave chambers for some simple cheese making based on some things John had told her in the glorious three science months. Well, and Sherlock too. She wished any of them knew how to make paper, but perhaps bark if there was time the next year. Possibly not. There would be a lot of mouths to feed. But she had some ideas about terracing the valley. Cultivating food rather than hunting and gathering. They were herders now. May as well farm too.
They were four days out of DS9 when they received word that the station had been taken over by Cardassians.
Ferengi sniffed again and gestrured with the disrupter. They came to an open panel that led into a Jeffries tube. The Ferengi grabbed John by the wrist. Even as short as the man was, he outmassed John by forty-five to fifty liters at least. He said, "Do not think to attempt to escape. My cousin is waiting above us." John sighed and climbed up the ladder inside the tube. At the top, there was another Ferengi, equally snaggle toothed. Between them, they took John to the children's classroom. There was a force shield in front of the door. A Ferengi was on guard there, watching a profit-novella. "Another child!" He sniffed, "Another omega. This ship is full of treasures. Someone will want to buy it. Truly Rule 75 is correct. Home is where the heart is, but the stars are made of latinum."
He looked at the rings on his left hand. They were both gold engraved with the image of a sort of masked face. One was laughing comically. The other ring showed a sorrowful tragic face. He hoped that didn't mean there was some sort of tragedy in his past. To distract himself and for yet another excuse to touch the alpha, still looking dazedly at him, he examined the alpha's ring. There was a sort of helix engraved around the top.
Could it really be summed up so simply? Was he right? Was I trying to redefine my entire world when all I need do was redefine my relationship with him?
He was rifling through the pocket of the jacket he'd worn last night. Having retrieved what he needed he headed to the loo beckoning me.
Now it was John's turn to press his lips together in a hard line.
Sherlock was silent as they entered the common area, silent as the got their trays and silent as they moved from station to station to station to plate their food. John didn't say much either except to make the occasional recommendation as to what was good and what could be avoided.
So you would say your interaction was healthy?"
"I didn't expect them to be so..."
"I need you to be alright, Sherlock." He said in a harsh whisper and that feeling of pins and needles was almost unbearable. "Someone has to survive all this."
tried. And now I think we've broken up. Yeah, I think we broke up about an hour ago."
"I know you can take it but I'm going to go slow at first." John paused. "I need to take my time before going deeper."
By the time John arrived home, Sherlock was 80%-85% finished assembling a cot.
It was indeed
"Don't be silly. You certainly deserved revenge. Forgive me, but, how does this have to do with heroin?"
"Are we naked?"
"Fine. Uneventful, you know."
"It won't be much longer, then we'll get you to your room and you can rest."
The funny thing is I truly believe you still think that's the worst of you.
"Thank you, Doctor Vikram for your time today. I do appreciate it."
He was close, so close now, they both were and before he could think about or check his words they spilled out.
"Was this due to withdrawal symptoms brought on by an attempt to stop drinking?"
"Did you just call me perfect? Did the dentist give you a great deal of gas?"
"Yeah, me too...Thanks for coming."
It seemed as though the snow that had started while he was with Hanah had only increased in the ensuing hours. That had to be 30 centimeters now, at least.
"On the national average? The relapse percentages are 50%-90%"
"Whose tears, Sherlock?" John asked softly but his boyfriend didn't answer.
"Really?" Sherlock asked with more disbelief than John felt the statement deserved.
But that wasn't even the worst one. He knew the worst one but only in retrospect. He would swear on a stack of bibles he hadn't meant it at the time, that it had been a slip. But even now he wasn't quite so sure.
"Wanked? Do you mean masturbated?"
"Nor yours."
He already knew he wasn't going to last as long as he wanted too. Sherlock was too beautiful, too swept away, too vocal ("John...John, my John...so, so good.” "I love your cock. I love your big cock." and the kicker, which was far more erotic than anything that preceded it; "I've wanted this since the day we met.") and too, too tight. Not that he was complaining. And speaking of tight, holy God, but it was more than he was expecting. It wasn't exactly that he was tighter than any woman he'd ever been with it was different than that. It was... a different kind of grip. A different kind of hold. Different muscles, different pressure, just different and wonderfully so. And hitting Sherlock's prostate produced much the same reaction as hitting a g-spot; that delightful twist and squirming of his body, his hips snapping upward and those sound, those unabashed, unashamed sounds of pleasure.
"You know." John said quietly.
The girl ringing up his groceries seemed to be moving in slow motion. For all he knew she might have been enjoying this, a little bit of excitement to spice up her day. There were five of them now. Two behind him, shouting questions, one waiting for him like a final battle of a gauntlet at the end of the checkout. He was standing near a very stressed looking bag boy who seemed like he wanted this to end almost as much as John did.
"John...John this feels so good." Sherlock wrapped a palm around his boyfriend's foot, guiding it where he wanted it to go all while rutting against it."
"John, I am impressed. You managed to come within
There was yet another body blow to his self-esteem. Brought down another peg. He knew how Mycroft saw him. Perhaps Mr. and Mrs. Holmes were the same. Perhaps now it had finally spread to Sherlock.
"Ok, anything else?" John said as he sat down with a fresh cuppa. "So far we've gone over sleeping arrangments and by the way, I'd love the idea of sharing your room and bed.
The hug was nice and needed and only now did John realize how much they hadn't been touching in the last few hours. He put his hand in Sherlock's hair before running it down his neck and finally his back. He could feel the knotted muscles beneath his fingertips; tight and inflexible.
"I don't want to be trapped by my answer." he said practically gritting his teeth to avoid sobbing again.
being pressed.
But he willed himself to do it anyway.
At that John burst out laughing and a frustrated Rosie, her patience at an end turned around and shushed them.
This felt like a success. This felt like a victory. And if there was one thing rehab had taught him, it was to claim his victories when they appeared.
"No, I couldn't sleep. Are you ok?"
"She knows him." John said incredulously.
He turned off the buzzer on his phone but turned on the screen for a bit of light.
At this John burst out laughing.
"I said you can't get it any fluffier. You ask yourself how much more fluff could this be? And the answer is none. None more fluff."
"Enter your phone number, email and handle and I'll be in touch. And you'll still need to find a local therapist. I have a Location provided list so no worries about lying. They contracted, they have clearance and if you decided on one of them they'll be briefed in full. You can speak freely with whoever you choose. I
"Oh." John said in a small voice. Sherlock's absence was cavernous; there was no way around it or through it. Instead, he was sat in the middle of it, unsure and barely caring which way to go.
There was a certain sensory deprivation to this experience. No outside influence. No phone. No newspapers. Nothing to distract and he knew that was, of course, the point. This was solitary confinement in the nicest of confines. He was meant to think these thoughts, let his mind wander down these dark paths.
"Do you really think, in all of London, you two were the only ones I knew looking for a flatshare?
"I don't think you are. You have circles under your eyes, along with burst capillaries. You're taking longer to answer questions, unable to concentrate or focus and-"
"Go into treatment."
"How posh of a boy would I be if I didn't have the capital to back it up?" He asked with amusement. "I just thought it might help with my work, someone intelligent, like minded, to bounce ideas off of, clear the cobwebs. And then there you were."
"John..." Sherlock began again and the doctor was certain he would now be asked to leave. "Would you like to stay here tonight? Your room is as you left it. Perhaps if Rosie is taken care of for the evening you might be able to get some rest at Baker Street."
“No. It was much simpler. I was just thinking I'm glad we're here."
"You say that as though it were an adage."
"God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Amen." He recited along with everyone else. The sentiment was hard but valuable and he said the words earnestly.
He'd decided to wait until after Sherlock and Rosie's birthdays, the former on the 6th and the latter on the 8th.** He normally didn't want to bother with celebrating it but once it was explained to Rosie that the dates were so close she wanted a joint party. Willing to do anything for his Honey Bee, Sherlock of course agreed. The picture of both of them in matching party hats was something John planned on getting framed as soon as time allowed. After the 8th, a case found them handcuffed and otherwise bound, though not in a fun way for several hours which lead to a chase that lasted a full week.
"I miss you, Mary." he said with a fond sigh.
I was already furious. I had been since he hadn't come home the night before. Alright, first I had been terrified. He was careless, yes. Thoughtless, absolutely. But even at his worst he would respond to a frantic text from me usually with a curt reply. At his most single minded I would still get the notification he had read it, whether he answered or not. But there had been nothing. Not a word and that grim fear had started to creep over my body that someone might have gotten the best of him. Maybe he was injured. Maybe he was dead.
"Sherlock, I was never going to walk away. I was already quite hooked...and smitten."
something then, weren't you? Glory."
"To Victor Trevor's grave. To pay my respects. Offer him my apologies. Tell him...I loved him. And say goodbye."
"Have you ever considered the idea that you may have sexual dependency?"
"Where are you going to live?"
The kiss turned even more passionate as covers and sheets slipped away.
By now, John was pretty sure he had it down. There were 20 chemist's within a 20-minute drive of Baker Street. Boots, John Walker, Lloyd's Pharmacy, Bliss; he had his choice. If he was willing to go 15 minutes farther than that his choices doubled.
"Could I...?" John began before dragging him into a kiss. "Sherlock, it's going to take literally everything I've got to not suggest we move here now."
"So, we're not going to escape, we're not going to scale the mountains and we're also not going to pretend we're in a Klingon penal colony. What do we do?" John asked.
"Yes, I do but-"
Sherlock was silent and still in the darkness for a few moments. As his eyes adjusted John was able to see him a bit better.
The room seemed to suddenly have a lot less air in it than it did moments before. Carelessly he flung the laptop to the side as a wave of nausea overtook him. He swung his legs over the side of the bed but upon contact, the floor felt pliable, like wet sand beneath his feet. He hurried toward the loo, staggering through red trees and ionized particles, unsure as to whether his dinner was going to come back up again.
"No, it wasn't. What I think I'm learning in here is that I have...issues handling certain situations. I get depressed and sometimes I can shake it off, sometimes, I can just live with it. But a lot of times it...it gets bad. That was one of the worst times, actually. But I met you and suddenly things didn't seem so bleak, I had a purpose again. And, um, August 8th came and went."
John sat on the bed just to gather his thoughts for a moment. The pain in his tooth (Yes,
the grit in the sensitive instrument, it
"Have you ever felt like nothing mattered anymore? Like, there's a limit on how much of yourself you can put into the world and you've reached it? You've reached your limit? You dig and you search but there's nothing there anymore. Have you ever felt that way?"
"John, take a breath for me. Take a sip of your tea and take a deep breath."
He closed his eyes for a moment before blindly reaching for her hand. It was small and warm and felt like it belonged there. After a minute more he looked at her.
"Yes. Well, with more than just tea. Think of tea as a metaphor if it helps you."
"Yeah, I can manage to drag my arse into the shower. We really will need to invest in some baby wipes or something, though. Because most times, I'm going to prefer lying here with you."
"Can we do that again in the morning?"
John approached him, sitting on the couch and taking the phone out of his hand. "Look at me."
"Would it be alright if I declined? It will likely sound ghastly sentimental. But the first thing I want inside me is you."
"Of course she knows him. She's seen him every week of her life. I don't think he's missed one Saturday. Even when he couldn't be there in person he Skyped her. John, I sent you the pictures."
"I want it to be different. I hate carrying around secrets in my mind, in my heart. I hate the weight of it all but I don't know how to get rid of it. I don't know how to let it go. I just want to be normal. What I do know is I don't want to bring it with me all over again. I want..." He paused as the gravity of what he was about to say hit him. But he didn't want to take it back. "I want this to be the last relationship I ever have. I've used language with him like, let's give it a go and let's try it out and let's see where it leads. When I know damn well where I want it to lead. Sherlock and I haven't dated, true and I imagine it will be different and odd and hard but he's not a stranger. I don't know if I've ever been closer to someone than I am to him. Even Mary because...I was not going to tell her all the things I'm thinking about telling him. I just wasn't."
"I don't know. Hadn't decided. Why?"
"You assume wrong." John said mid-brush. "That's been my point all along."
Could he really blame Mycroft for wanting to separate them?
I still don't know what that was...I don't...I don't understand that part. After all this time why try and make me believe something you know, you
“Good. The second condition is that in our next session we discuss why you couldn’t show up for the one you missed. We don’t gloss over it and pretend it didn’t happen. You’ve glossed over enough in your life. Deal?”
"Anderson owes me 20 quid." He said with a grin. "So, how-
"Oh, I don't take orders from you, Sherlock. I don't take orders from anybody."
“I guess it made me feel more normal. We weren’t a gang or anything but it did help once people started associating me with that group. I think maybe I felt safe? Even though I didn’t really think of myself as having been unsafe before.”
But your hands shook and your voice shook and you were as unsteady in the force behind your words as you were in your desire.
He only thought about diving in after them for a moment...or two.
Hi Sherlock,
John cleared his throat and began.
"Then I'd move on to your clavicle." He said painting the bone with his thumb. He was starting to feel voracious now, everything was floral and flesh and Sherlock. He sucked at the skin on his collarbone, alternating between soft enough to tease and hard enough to nearly bruise. Sherlock responded by squirming on the mattress and grasping at whatever part of John he could reach.
"Is this what I think it is?
"I'd just as soon continue if it's all the same to you both," Sherlock said quickly.
"I just want the absolute best for her. She's brilliant, she's lovely and clever and quick, she makes me laugh, she makes me think. She has all your best qualities. She's this complicated little amalgamation of Mary and you. She deserves the best."
"They'll translate if you work them. And you're right, there is a bit of the artificial to this place. This level of help and support and the fact that you can't just pop out to a store for a drink, that matters. But I also don't think you're giving yourself enough credit. Did it ever occur to you that you're thinking more clearly now than you have in over a year? That some of the effects of all that alcohol have receded? That's not artificial, that's hard and true science. That matters. And that's what you did for you. That's sobriety and you can take that with you. I swear to you, even if nothing else here is portable,
"Because I have nothing to live for. Because I don't want to be here anymore."
I miss you. I miss my best friend.
woman,
"Of course we can." He said peering out and motioning for John to come along. "Just give me a few days to up my intake of fruit. I'll need to pry some mangos from Mrs. Hudson."
“You must think I’m an awful person. Jesus, the things I’m telling you.”
of it started him crying like a child that had been startled.
John had taken Sherlock's hand then and squeezed it before interlacing their fingers. His boyfriend squeezed in return before continuing on.
Clearing his throat, he began."When I saw you last, before the rooftop of Bart's we were in the lab and I got the message that Mrs. Hudson had been shot. Now, clearly, in hindsight, this didn't make any sense, this was all orchestrated by you to get me out of the way." He jutted a finger at Sherlock surprised at how things anger rose so easily to the surface, surprised and a little frightened.
The hand that had been lurking in Sherlock's pocket left that location and rested in his lap just out of view for a moment.
“In execution, it was very exciting. As presented it sounded ridiculous.”
“But I think the point is John, I underestimated by a lot, and here I thought I’d been the only one to see your potential. After all, I put you to work, and then I tried to kill you. No one else saw you as enough of a threat to do that, did they? I mean, Sherlock played games with you, I supposed. But they were only games. You know that now though, don’t you?”
Sherlock couldn’t believe it. John. Loyal, kind, stubborn, proud John, committing adultery. His John, betraying him. But it fit then, didn’t it? The text messages, the avoidance, the hesitation. All this time he’d been trying to protect John from Moriarty, when John probably was only feeling guilty for betraying his other partner.
The statement hung in the air, lacking all the bile and aggression of the previous times he had made similar statements earlier that day. He almost sounded sad, John would go as far as to say heartbroken even, although John wasn’t convinced Moriarty had a heart to break. But then could he be like Sherlock after all? Not in the sense that he was a genius or a mastermind or a self-proclaimed sociopath. But maybe in the sense that he was just a man as well, who when it came down to it felt so much that it overwhelmed him. He had, just like Sherlock, lived a life of carefully orchestrated control, and now the control was gone. When Sherlock lost control, he fought to regain it through self-destructive behavior.
“But you’ve lost hope in him, haven’t you Johnny? Would you like to bet 48, just in case?”
Silence hung heavily in the air.
John felt some tension slip from his shoulders. Maybe he had misunderstood what Sherlock’s opening up had meant. Maybe he was just projecting his feelings for Sherlock onto him. Of course Sherlock admitting that he cared for John didn’t mean anything more than that. He had already known they were friends. That’s probably all Sherlock meant. John was just so wound up about Moriarty that he was expecting the worst when it wasn’t even coming. Sherlock was right, none of this was new information. Sherlock may have never said it, but it was obvious that if a man with a reputation like Sherlock's kept someone around for as much time as he kept John around, Sherlock was at least a little fond of him, even if the reasons Sherlock was fond of John might not be any of the normal reasons one person liked another.
“What do menthols have to do with the medical examiner?” John asked.
However, this had been Sherlock’s goal for the last week, and he was more or less unsuccessful, mostly because the second Dimmock had begun to catch on to his passive arse-kissing Sherlock had had to save face by showing up at one of his crime scenes and solving it in all of about thirty seconds. This, however, only got him arrested for tampering with evidence and he’d spent six hours in a jail cell before Mycroft had come to bail him out and Lestrade later convinced Dimmock to drop the charges.
But wanting Sherlock was something that didn’t get thought about, because Sherlock wasn’t like that and John had no problem not being like that either. And now, after what had happened, it was imperative that he stay as far away from Sherlock as possible without raising suspicion. Over the past week since the incident with Moriarty, John had come up with excuses to not go with Sherlock out on as many cases as he could get away with. He’d spent most nights out with women, any woman that would have him, in order to get out of the flat.
Mary and Victor exchanged glances.
But no matter what he did, Sherlock still couldn’t seem to reassure John.
John officially had nothing.
The room fell silent for a moment, and John was certainly relieved to be able to have a brief break from the cracked man’s rambling questions. After a few more moments, much to John’s relief, Moriarty stood up from John’s lap and walked back over to the desk in the center of the room. He stood with his back to John as he rummaged around the table. John grew nervous with the curiosity of what he could be looking for, but was fairly certain that he was also not going to suddenly pull a gun out, turn around, and shoot him execution style. And as long as his life was not immediately threatened, John could work with the rest.
“The message from Moriarty on the sign!” Sherlock yelled in exasperation, turning his back on Lestrade as he continued to search on his mobile.
“He left the scene at about 3 o’clock yesterday afternoon, so he’s been gone for about 22 hours,” Lestrade reported.
And Sherlock mostly just really didn’t fucking care about anything else anymore.
Surprise crossed Mycroft's face, but it quickly it was wiped blank again.
Sherlock was growing angry. For a while he had just felt the usual boredom and the resulting frustration, but now it was blooming into full blown rage. The world seemed to be falling apart around him. Or, rather, the world seemed to be doing just fine. Too fine, actually. His job, however, was falling apart. And his job, the work, was his world. So to find that there didn’t seem to be a need for him anymore, when he was supposed to be the world’s only consulting detective, solving crimes when the police are out of their depths, which previously had been always, was becoming increasingly difficult to bare.
Celebrity gossip was at least as useless as John’s medical journals anyway. What did cosmetic advances in skin grafts or new treatments for toenail fungus matter? While occasionally John’s journals reported medical breakthroughs that even Sherlock had to admit might actually matter, usually they were mind numbingly boring.
Hopefully Moran was too focused on Mary to catch the deception. Hopefully wherever Moriarty was watching from it was far enough away, on a grainy or lagging feed, that wouldn’t allow him to notice it either.
Then suddenly the floor seemed to fall out from under him, and Moriarty’s face appeared above him, contorted with mad laughter.
“It’s alright John. I should have known. I’m so sorry I didn’t know.”
When he woke up again the clock was down to 38 hours. Moran was nowhere in sight, but John realized that his shoulder was killing him. Having been hung for ten hours, his old injury had been agitated and it felt like his shoulder was trying to rip itself apart. John tried to reposition himself, seeing if he could put any more weight on his toes, but no relief came.
“Right,” Lestrade grumbled. “Well let’s get on with it then,” he said, stepping through the entrance of the building. Sherlock eagerly followed and then quickly took the lead.
The news had been a setback on the small progress that Sherlock had made towards being a functioning human again. Sherlock had returned to the chair, ignoring the world and even the most desperate pleas. Hearing the official report of John's demise was too much for Sherlock to bear, and he retreated into his mind.
He found himself a few minutes later wandering through Regent’s park. It was a very grey day and had been raining on and off, so the park was quiet, besides a few stubborn joggers and dog walkers. He found dryer looking bench and sat down to try to think, but the thing that he needed to think about most hurt too much to even consider. What had happened with Moriarty was too much, it took everything in him to pretend to be as fine as he had been for Sherlock. But now it seemed like Sherlock was finally asking for something that John couldn’t give him. Not for the reasons that he’d used before, no, something much, much worse. But he couldn’t help but want it, still, none the less.
Before he could stop it, a dry, hollow, sob escaped his lips.
Normally, people didn’t need to tell Sherlock things for him to know. Sherlock would be able to figure it out all on his own. It was what he did. He could read peoples life stories from the lines on their faces and the bend of their hands. But right now he couldn't read John at all. And it made him want to tear his hair out.
His John.
“Sherlock,” Lestrade said softly. “Why don’t you call a friend and ask them to have dinner or go to the pub or something?”
“I had heard you having nightmares all week, and I thought that it was just a return of your PTSD because of the stress. But Moriarty said something to you, something that you didn’t tell me, didn’t he? And you’ve been keeping it from me, haven't you? You foolish, stubborn man! Why do you always have to be so brave?"
He heard Lestrade talking. Maybe to someone else? But he couldn’t bring himself to listen.
He put out a search for him within his homeless network, although he wasn’t entirely up to trusting them after the Torture Chamber mishap. Granted, that was a simple misunderstanding for normal people to make. The intel he got from his network was usually only partial and riddled with normal people misunderstandings. In the past it had always been himself who had been able to sort out the normal people inaccuracies in deductions with ease. It was his fault he’d made a fool of himself and Lestrade.
“No, get out of here. He’s honestly right behind you, about five meters,” John’s stomach dropped as he watched Victor’s eyes move over his shoulder to look at something, someone in the not so far distance. The man grabbed his hand and pulled John close into a friendly embrace,giving him a rough pat on the back. "Just because you're back in London and the world is quaking at your feet, don't let your guard down," Victor whispered quickly, before he drew back and dropped John's hand.
"It was a greater good kind of scenario, surely you understand," Mycroft sighed.
“Sherlock, there you are! I’ve been trying to catch up with you for an hour now!” Lestrade appeared beside him, with a lieutenant trailing behind him.
"Yes, Sherlock, I do. John has been through hell these past few months. The world he's been living in is not one that you could imagine, nor one do I believe you'd have been able to handle had your places been swapped. He needs rest. He needs time to process things, and decide what his life will be like now that Moriarty is gone."
“Were you having a hard time fighting it out for who gets to top?” Moriarty taunted, and John found it within himself to growl at him.
John was the Peacemaker.
He glared at Mycroft and Lestrade, fuming. They shared a glance before Lestrade finally spoke.
"Mycroft showed me a tape, of when you came to the warehouse that day."
John nodded and together they turned around and went back into 221 Baker Street.
John sighed.
Now he was in a relationship with John Watson, more or less anyway, and it was wonderful. John seemed hesitant to define their relationship, and definitely was not ready to tell other people, but he had stopped gallivanting around the city with any woman who looked at him twice and was spending the night in Sherlock’s bed, so Sherlock assumed it counted as a relationship. And whatever it was, it was good enough for him, because he still had John, which was all that mattered.
On the eleventh day, he just sat there. He sat there using every bit of energy just to keep himself in his seat. He needed something. He needed to do something. He couldn't wait any longer. But he couldn't leave. He had to wait.
“So, this has something to do with narrow boating?” Lestrade asked, standing up and walking over to Sherlock.
“Do you worst,” John growled, realizing the man seemed to have a tool belt full of what would surely end up being torture devices strapped to his waist.
Anderson scowled at Sherlock but said nothing.
“But the only ones left are so boring,” John heard Sherlock groan distantly before the pair walked out of earshot.
John groaned. He felt nauseated at even the mention of a wound. The first time he’d gone out with Sherlock on a case, Sherlock had asked him if he wanted to see more. Well he didn’t, not anymore. No more injuries. No more violent deaths. No more trouble.
For a second, they both stood still. Moriarty stood before him, looking irritatingly relaxed.
But then something wasn’t right. DMJS down 12.11. DMJS wasn’t the abbreviation for any company he’d ever heard of. He of course didn’t know extensive amounts about stocks, not being information he counted as important, but the case with Sebastian Wilkes several months ago, The Blind Banker as John had referred to it on his blog, had left him unfortunately familiar with the kinds of things that read across these boards, and DMJS was not one of them.
He'd needed some stitches and had gotten a handful of tests and scans, but he hadn't needed any surgery, which was encouraging for the amount of time it would take him to recover. His jaw had also needed to be stitched up. They were worried about the stab wound, but it hadn’t hit any internal organs. The split and scotched skin across his chest was basically inconsequential in comparison to the rest of it and thankfully the infection that he was showing signs of seemed to be residing quickly thanks to a round of strong antibiotics.
Days went by, and nothing happened.
Moriarty reached back to the tray and picked up a straight razor. He held it up for John to see and it glimmered in the late afternoon light that poured through the large windows.
However, today did not appear to be one of those days.
He remembered John’s pallor when Sherlock read the text messages that came into his phone. John had thought Sherlock had known then, hadn’t he? He assumed Sherlock would be disgusted with him, that he’d blow the whistle on him and have him dragged off to prison.
“What about Molly? Molly’s nice. And she likes you. I saw her name in that report, she ran that blood sample for you despite the fact that it isn’t really her job, you know. Ask her to dinner as thanks. I’m sure she’ll say yes.”
The sign read and Sherlock froze. Missed him? Where had he been? Where was he going? What was going to happen to him? Had they been keeping him somewhere nearby but just transported him somewhere else? Or did that indicate something more morbid?
“We’ve got antibiotics and a first aid kit. Plus John’s a doctor. And he's a stubborn bastard. Just the kind of man to rise from the dead call me out. You hear that, you bastard. What do you have to say for yourself?”
“No, I sent it to that little assassin friend of yours, Johnny. The cute little blonde thing with a gun, surely you haven't forgotten? You two make a beautiful pair, I haven’t told you before. It’s like you two could be twins, both… compact and unassuming. Cute in kind of a plain way, but ready to destroy the world for the sake of it.” Moriarty’s hand had returned to stroking John’s hair, and John forced himself to lean into the touch in a way that he hoped came off as unconscious, although the way he was grinding down defensively in his jaw told another story.
Moriarty gestured to the phone that held the CCTV feeds tracking Mary and Victor. “You’re going to destroy them.”
"Sherlock what on earth are you doing!" She yelled.
Moran reached into his pocket and pulled out a knife.
It was like the need to drugs, but it wasn't.
“Belief has nothing to do with this, it’s the truth. I’m not interested in wasting time on John, I want to bring down Moriarty. John is nothing in Moriarty’s network, just a tool for Moriarty to use!”
Had it really been almost six months at this point since the last time he and Sherlock had ran through the streets together? Since the first time John had met Moriarty? Since the first time he and Sherlock had kissed?
“Really, Holmes, I thought that you had some tact. Do you think that if I had anything to do with that guy, which I’ve told you I don’t, that I’d tell you now? After what, accidentally running into the Peacemaker himself in the streets?”
“Oh, really, I do believe that your brother has commissioned me to babysit you after you were found en route to a crack den,” Trevor quipped.
“Little brother, I believe there are issues at hand, and we simply don’t have time for you to throw a fit.”
He should be dead.
John growled. But then he grew quiet and began to think. Mary sat there and watched him silently.
At the words ‘
Lestrade had texted him. Sherlock had growled in frustration when he’d read the text.
“No, you were just trying to destroy mine.”
John quickly exited the warehouse and began to make his way down the street, trying to find his way to Camden High Street in hopes of finding an Underground Station. It was useless trying to hail a cab at this end of the neighborhood, in the middle of the afternoon and a weekday none the less, and he didn’t have time to call and wait for one. It had always been Sherlock who had an aversion to the tube, anyway, John had never minded it.
But rather than using his information for protection, Huxley had become paranoid. Huxley had turned to old habits in desperation for money, and had managed to horribly muck up a mugging, ultimately killing his victim. The victim, infuriatingly, was a man from somewhere Sherlock had deleted where in eastern Europe, and was in the UK on falsified papers and was rumored to be a trained assassin.
Sherlock read the message and looked up at John. John was staring back in horror. Sherlock looked back down at the text.
“Who, who has he been seeing? Who is she?” Sherlock demanded.
“John, I’m not proposing to you. I realize that statistically plenty of sexual relationships end, and sometimes badly. But we can’t continue any other way, can we? I’ve explored every other option, considered all the possibilities. This is the best one for us, I think.”
“Also, Mycroft says that you should stop whinging about not having a case and check your bloody phone,” he paused, a grin tugging at the corners of his lips, “Well, he didn’t say bloody, I added that part. Mycroft is too dignified for that, at least via text, but I suppose you already know.”
“Are you trying to deduce me, Holmes?” Victor asked, still grinning at Sherlock with eyes twinkly mischievously in a way that Sherlock was coming to despise. “I’m not a very interesting person, mate. Everything interesting there is to know about me, you probably already know, and not because there’s a certain kind of mud on my shoes or tan lines on my neck but because we were friends for nearly three years and I, perhaps unfortunately, haven’t changed much since then.”
“Boyfriend?” John gasped.
“Your world isn’t Sherlock, Johnny. Not anymore anyway. Your world is
"Where is he?"
He heard only silence in return.
John took a moment to close his eyes and focus on regulating his breathing.
“That’s something else I was here to tell you Sherlock,” Lestrade interceded. “We can’t definitively ID all of the bodies, but this most recent body matches the build of an ex-con who we believe to have ties to Moriarty. We found that he had some reconstructive work done on his knee after a gunshot wound, and the serial numbers on the pins match those recorded in his medical records. Unfortunately the other bodies don’t have any similar surgical work done that could be used to identify them, but assuming that the bodies are all part of the pattern, which we’ve been assuming, it’s likely that the victims had similar backgrounds.”
“Sh,” Moriarty cooed, leaning away from John to reveal another twisted, knowing grin. “Don’t worry, darling. I don’t have anything untoward planned for you. You aren’t exactly my type, Johnny. No offense, mind. No one is really, are they? I’d thought for a second your beloved Sherlock might be, but watching him now, he’s far more normal than I initially was lead to believe. I think the problem is I wouldn’t really want anything less than an equal, but at the same time I can’t bear the thought of competition." Ah well," he sighed heavily.
“So somewhere, there are three other bodies that are linked to this case, who all potentially could have been murdered as well, of a similar skin tone,” Sherlock intoned.
Sherlock didn’t care though, he was on the case. He wanted to understand, he
Sherlock scowled but walked around the car, opened the door, and got in.
“Sherlock, have you heard from John since he left the crime scene yesterday?”
But he wasn’t his John, was he? He’d been working with Moriarty.
“Related to the Peacemaker?” Sherlock asked. He could hear the excitement in Sherlock’s voice. God, he sounded so young and naïve. John knew that Sherlock was only a bit more than a handful of years younger than him and well into his thirties, but he could be so childlike at times. John found himself smiling fondly.
Why was he even fighting it anyway? What did he have outside of this darkness? His body was wrecked, even if he made it out of here, wherever here was. Even if he survived, he couldn’t really, could he? Moriarty couldn’t know or else he might come after Sherlock. He’d said he was taking a holiday. That probably meant going overseas to continue to strengthen himself before coming back to crush Sherlock. But John already had sold his life to buy Sherlock a chance to live, even if it could only be for a little extra time. And now he’d dared try and reclaim it.
“Then why the fuck aren’t you already there rescuing him?” Victor hissed, a desperation and frustration licking at his voice that Sherlock had never heard from the other man.
They sped across London, Sherlock plying the cabbie into making increasingly daring choices in an effort to tail the other zippy little car with an endless stream of twenty pound notes carelessly shoved through the plastic screen that separated the driver from the back of the cab. The cabbie was hesitant but continued to oblige Sherlock’s demands as the bills continued to pile up. They drove east across London and Sherlock’s breath caught in his throat as he realized that they were headed in the direction of the West India Docks. It had been Canary Wharf where he’d gone looking for John all that time ago now, after all. And now Moriarty was leading Sherlock back through Tower Hamlets. They drove into an area that was populated by what appeared to be old factories. Usually these kinds of buildings now a day were remodeled into flats, but this string of buildings for whatever reason was eerily abandoned.
Sherlock spat the nickname and John flinched violently.
Then he heard a noise from somewhere in the back of the flat. Sherlock bolted in that direction, shoving past an officer who had just been rounding the corner, his weapon held high in front of him, still trying in vain to make sure the flat was clear.
“I didn’t say that I was going to kill anyone,” John snapped, but then took a breath to calm himself. “I said we’d make an example of them. Our process all along has been contingent on Moriarty not finding out, so he couldn’t just contract another killer, another smuggler, another gang. What if we made it that no one in their right mind would dare agree to work with Moriarty,” John said, a grin tugging at the edges of his lips.
“Oh, of course I’m wrong, says the genius. Tell me something new!” John snarled and threw his arms up in the air. He was eager to break the stillness that had fallen over the room. It was far too serious, and he couldn’t bear that right now. It felt like it did when occasionally Sherlock was going to say something that was far too raw and actually mean it. Those moments were rare, and while John usually cherished them, he couldn’t handle one of them right now, not after everything that had just happened.
“Oh, I plan on it Watson,” Moran smirked, pulling a whip out of his belt and smacking John harshly across the chest with it. “We’ll start off slow,” Moran snapped the whip again, leaving a second welt across John’s chest. Several more fell and John stubbornly refused to make a noise.
It was an odd life that he had fallen in with, living and working with Victor and Mary. They were a very self-contained unit, neither Mary nor Victor seemed to have any connections with the outside world, nor any interest in doing even as much as going down to the pub together for a drink in the evenings. John had wondered if they were involved at first, even if just for the sake of not having to maintain complete abstinence in their isolation, but their relationship seemed to be strictly professional with negligible amounts of emotional attachment in any form. John very much had the sense that they viewed this as an assignment and after this was over they would likely never speak again. And if at any point leaving another behind became in the best interest in maintaining the integrity of the work that had done so far, neither of them would think twice about it.
John tried to speak.
Three more days and Mycroft sent a hospice nurse and a couple of muscular assistants to carry Sherlock to his bed, where they hooked him up to an IV to be fed via parenteral nutrition, as well as outfitting him with a catheter and fecal collector. A part of Mycroft had hoped that he'd be able to embarrass his brother out of his stubborn mourning. When Sherlock's face remain blank as he was stripped by strangers, however, Mycroft was finally forced to admit that this wasn't just his brother being dramatic.
Sherlock was on the way to the Yard, making his journey on foot from Baker Street out of hopes to kill time or maybe just maybe to happen to witness an interesting crime along the way. His goal for that day was to try and get the Dimmock, who had arrested a man who turned out to have a background in the military and was rumored to be a hired assassin, specializing as a sniper, on breaking and entering and attempted burglary, to not hate him so much.
When he heard John’s phone buzz from across the room, he held his breath hoping that whoever was on the other end of the message John had just received had something even just vaguely interesting to say.
It was such a clever thing to say. Well, in fact, out of all the things that Sherlock had ever said, it was probably one of the
Moriarty looked up from the phone to John, his brow momentarily furrowing, and then another Cheshire cat grin slowly spreading across his face.
“I’m not afraid of Moriarty!” John shouted in protest.
After the assessment of his body, the situation at hand returned to his mind. Moriarty had inevitably sent whatever photo or video he took of John to someone, and the most logical assumption was that that person was Sherlock. He imagined Sherlock receiving proof of John’s brokenness. He imagined Sherlock’s face showing fragments of endless emotions: anguish, anger, betrayal, pain, bitterness, disappointment, rage.  Maybe rescue
John felt sick for the first time in months. That’s what it had been since he had last seen Sherlock. He’d spent the past three months tearing down anyone who happened to have been so much as glanced at by Moriarty. He could deal with Mary’s jokes about what Sherlock and him had before, but he still couldn’t stomach the idea of an after. After all, there wouldn’t be one.
The terror that began to rise in John was like nothing he’d ever felt before. To think that all the work that he’d done over the past year could possibly be for nothing, it was worse than any other time he’d found himself in a similar situation. He didn’t even think death when he’d been drowning in the Thames had been so absolutely terrifying.
“I can’t think of any anatomical reason why not,” John said trying to seem ambivalent.
“But we only knew about the cabbie and smugglers because Moriarty wanted us to. How would we possibly get to any of them before they even commit a crime at Moriarty’s orders? And where are you getting your intelligence?” John asked. God, his head ached. Well, everything ached as whatever initial blast of morphine they had given him was wearing off and he was hesitant to have more administered.
“John?”
John followed Moriarty into the small room at the back of the boat that had last week been an office. Now it was completely bare except for a set of chains that hung from the ceiling and a trunk against the back wall. No light made it in past the thick paper that was gaffer taped over the windows, and the only light came from a dim yellow ceiling light that occasionally flickered tauntingly.
As John began to gather his faculties, he realized that this time he was seated, tied to a chair. He did another quick scan of his body, trying to push Sherlock out of his mind.  He tested what he could move and what he couldn’t, what hurt and what didn’t. He was bruised and bloodied, and taking deep breaths caused shooting pain, as did basically any other sort of movement he quickly realized. Thankfully though, there was nothing that seemed particularly life threatening at that moment. If he was jostled around too much, the likely broken rib, or more likely ribs, could possibly puncture his lung, which if without pretty immediate medical attention could become life threatening. But as long as he stayed still, bought his time to figure out a way out, or maybe to give enough time for the non guaranteed rescue enough time to show up, he still had strong chances of making it out alive.
Sherlock halted to look at Lestrade. His face looked soft, like he was going to have to give Sherlock some bad news, and Sherlock realized that there was a foreboding hollow feeling in the pit of his stomach.
“John,” Sherlock breathed his name, his voice coarse. “Your suspect is John.” He looked up at Lestrade, hoping for any chance that the DI’s face would not confirm it, but there was nothing there except for sadness.
“Have you, perhaps, considered that there is no one else besides me,
From that point on, it became hard. It wasn’t him getting high off of waves of adrenaline as he whispered threats while beating the crap out of the criminals of London before going back to the flat with Mary to have a couple beers and tease each other about any minor missteps they had made. No this was work. It was like war. Worse than war. At least in war he had an entire army behind him.
He would do this, whatever was asked of him. And then Sherlock once and for all could be safe. And then John could reassess if there was any space left in the world for himself. If he didn’t die in the process, of course.
Sherlock imagined John's body, pale and marred with wounds from torture, floating somewhere lost in the murky water of the Thames. He imagined John strung up and screaming while he was repeatedly assaulted. He imagined John hanging there, bleeding and defeated.
“Really, Holmes, I thought that you had some tact. Do you think that if I had anything to do with that guy, which I’ve told you I don’t, that I’d tell you now? After what, accidentally running into the Peacemaker himself in the streets?”
John suddenly felt like he couldn’t breathe again. He collapsed onto the floor, wincing as his wounded back collided with the floor. He surged back upright, gasping and clawing at his chest with shaking hands. They clawed into his raw flesh of the wounds from where he was whipped and burned and he gasped as it stung. His entire body was on fire
“Are you going to?” Victor murmured.
So Sherlock was going to take the biggest dose he could handle after being clean for so long, collapse onto a filthy mattress, and retreat into his mind palace until he felt like it was back enough in order that maybe he could go out into the world and be able to make sense of it. He’d even traded in his usual Saville Row kit for a hoodie, track pants, and trainers in an effort of better blending in in the territory that he was venturing into and for the comfort of an extended stay.
“You’ve carried on for days without me around before,” John replied tersely.
When he got outside he found himself in a dimly lit hall way. He heard the sounds of sirens in the distance.
The flat fell silent.
The next day Mycroft and Lestrade tag teamed it to inform Sherlock that they’d finished fishing the two boats out of the river. There was no body found, but there were very faint traces of blood found on the wood of the narrowboat that was identified to belong to John. There were indications from marks in the wood and some sort of metal clasps popular for bondage they’d found that he’d been hung from the ceiling of the boat, likely tortured, although whatever was binding him to the ceiling could not be found. It was a possibility that while trying to uncover the narrowboat, John’s body had become dislodged, whatever was tethering him to the boat having become detached when the boat was crushed, and he got carried down river. John Watson was officially declared missing, presumed dead.
Being around Sherlock had frankly just become too difficult.
“This is hardly the first time I’ve slept some place that’s not in a bed in a property I let and this is hardly the most compromising situation you’ve ever caught me in,” Sherlock muttered dryly.
Moran poked Johns side with his knife just below the ribs. The wound might nick the spleen, but otherwise was likely to clear any more essential organ.
There was only a moments silence before Victor spoke. “Course I’m coming. What about…?” there was silence and Sherlock could only assume some gesture was being made to fill the silence.
“Fuck, Sherlock,” John groaned.
The look of anger and betrayal in Sherlock’s eyes had been too much. He wanted to pretend that he still was following the commands of the text messages because he needed to protect London, his family, friends, and most importantly Sherlock from Moriarty. Weeks ago though when it became clear to John that he was only delaying all of their fates, giving Moriarty time to put a far more devastating plan into action, John pretended that he was at least doing it to buy Sherlock more time as well. But as he worked for Moriarty and saw the full extent of the man’s madness and genius, he began to lose faith in Sherlock. Sherlock was one man, determined to bring Moriarty down virtually entirely on his own. Moriarty, on the other hand, had countless numbers of people at his beck and call. John was just one tiny pawn. In a way, so was Sherlock. So then, John kept showing up for the purposes of self-preservation. He began to hope that he could just maybe keep himself alive long enough to maybe find a way out.
But of course, even if the scars were gone, it wouldn't fix the underlying damage.
“I heard that went badly,” Moran scoffed.
John could only see Moriarty, and he had to tilt his head upwards to peer up at the man who was now towering above him, confronting Mary and Victor who stood at the door behind him, out of his sight.
It begins about a week after the events of The Great Game, everything after that point is a near complete departure.
John’s eyes darted to Moriarty’s.
He felt like his brain was breaking, like his mind palace was collapsing. What was the point of being so clever if he had missed the only thing that ever truly mattered?
John made three very large mistakes that afternoon. The first was exploding at Sherlock and threatening to leave him, sparking Sherlock’s decision to take drastic measures by journeying to previously avoided territory. The second was giving into his desire and allowing their relationship to be taken to that new level. And the third and probably biggest mistake was to fall asleep afterwards.
Lestrade had finally pulled him out of his mind palace to tell him that it was now early afternoon the next day and there were some more pressing matters at hand, but so far it seemed that in fact there were not, since Lestrade didn’t appear to have any leads.
he saw was not someone he had ever anticipated seeing again at all. He froze to match the person who he was staring at, who seemed paralyzed as well.
“Well, apparently Mr. Happy Go Lucky I Have No Secrets I’m Just Here to Kick Ass and Save the World did have a secret after all,” Mary began. “I mean, as far as secrets go it’s hardly damning. If you knew some of the things I’ve done, you’d never, well that doesn’t matter,” Mary trailed off.
The trainers were otherwise well taken care of and cleaned regularly. This indicated that Victor hadn’t taken his shoes off recently, otherwise he would have noticed the gum and scraped it off.
John knocked back the rest of his beer before dropping the can and lunging at Mary. She quickly jumped to her feet, holding her can over her head with a victorious and maniacal grin on her face.
He didn't want to tell her about the forest. He couldn't put his finger on why but somehow it just felt incredibly private.
"Hey...I'm so sorry I ran you off like I did." He said to her.
"I suppose I don't really know what to say." He voiced doing his best not to sound pathetic.
Maybe he should say all of this aloud. Maybe he should admit how absolutely terrified he'd been for a moment in the shop. When the noise and the chatter and the stares and the lights had all come together to make him feel as jumpy and on edge as when he was crawling on his belly through poppy fields in Helmand with Taliban bullets whizzing overhead. Maybe he should to what he wanted which was to take a small refuge in his arms. To just, feel it all again, but in a safe way. Hanah called it "depositing yourself in the moment". Reliving trauma in a secure environment as a way of coping and overcoming it.
"Love you. I'll be home soon."
He had made it clear that he didn't want people congregating at the house after the burial. He couldn't stand it. Couldn't imagine dealing with his home bursting at the seams with all these people and their apologies and their sympathies and their bereavement tropes. Instead, he stayed at the graveside while they dispersed, while Molly took Rosie for the night and while he tried to understand how his wife was in a box in the mud. How this box was then going to have more mud shoveled upon it, then flattened. And how a stone was going to be erected month's later that would serve as a period to her life. Once and for all. This was death and that was the night that a drink no longer became an option but a necessity.
They showered and toweled off and John was able to catch a glimpse of the time before they crawled, naked, back into bed. It was only a quarter past midnight. Still so early and so much had happened.
"You know, you're pretty good at this."
maker.
Pupils dilating John watched, occasionally nipping at the column of Sherlock's neck.
"Are you alright?"
"Forgiven."
Sherlock angled his body toward him but began by looking down at his palms.
"John, listen to him." Hanah interrupted. "He's saying he doesn't mind waiting. You should acknowledge that."
How long had I dreamed of this, all of this, the taste of his skin, taking gentle bites at his flesh, kissing his chest, running my tongue over his nipples, moving down further, tracing wet patterns over his ribcage, following that trail of hair from his belly button lower, and lower.
"Voting in the United Kingdom is done by secret ballot. You shouldn't know that." He said and cleared his throat.
"Happily." Sherlock replied and they set off.
"I miss it too." Duck replied. "I left too much of me over there. Too many pieces scattered. I think I thought somehow they might allow me back to reclaim them, make amends as best I could. I can't bring those boys back but I can do my penance for their lives, for their souls. Instead, I'm here. Not really home and not really away but caught up somewhere in between. It's a shite way to live."
"Sherlock, please...I'm ready. I'm so ready for you."
"Yesss." I replied in a long hiss. "But I don't want to come."
She kissed them both goodbye before heading back down to her flat.
As it turned out he had been unconscious for well over 48 hours and in that time he'd gone through the worst of the DT's. Thank God for small miracles.
"Deal. Pizza or Chinese?"
"...John?'
"That night. Give me a man...I forget now but it was something about being a slave to passion, I think? I asked you to finish it but you wouldn't."
“More focused on pampering than helping.”
She must really like green. He thought.
John stopped him mid-platitude.
Thank you...That sounds so shamefully, painfully inadequate but thank you. Thank you for giving Mary her life, our life. But I never wanted you to lose yours in the process, mate.
Every day he took it with him to dinner, or back to his room and kept it until he turned it in before going to bed.
Then, to his surprise there came a day when he couldn't put him off any longer. A day when Sherlock Holmes could not be swayed. A day when the quiet of the country did not send him bolting for the bluster and noise of the city.
But what was worse was the truth...the truth? ...falling from his lips. A half whispered and aching "Yes...Sherlock..."
"Ok, I'll come home." He said with a broad smile his friend returned. "I don't really want to be anywhere else."
"Uh, yes thank you." John said with a smile as she set two menus down in front of them.
Sherlock nodded and positioned himself above him and John paid careful attention to the look of concentration on his face. Helping him along, John rubbed just the tip of his cock against his hole, once twice before penetrating him ever so slightly.
"You sank your bloody teeth into my skin." John chastised with no weight behind it.
The feeling of anger from earlier started to return. Anger at having his space threatened, his privacy, his dignity. Anger at having people so bloody invested in what was now his public life. Anger at how he brought so much of this on himself. Anger at-
Silently he grabbed his keys and the Big Book and left the flat. He hadn't heard any activity from below so it seemed he'd manage to make it out before Mrs. Hudson arrived home. He wanted to greet her, of course, but more than that he wanted to get a jump on his day first. He was already more than a little nervous about a new routine. He quickly hailed a taxi and directed the driver to St. Lucian.
“Nothing about that man frightens me now and not just because he's dead.”
Trying to keep her quiet. Trying so hard.
"Of course." Hanah replied.
late arrival.
"Do you want to pass out, right here?" "Mary" asked as she walked in step with him. "Because you are moments away. You took too much and now your blood pressure has dropped and your heart rate has slowed down and that's not even including this panic attack. Confusion is going to set in and then fear and disorientation. If you don't sit, right now you are going to hit the ground and hit it hard and everyone will get a picture of your overdose. Including Sherlock." She paused and he could tell without looking that her eyes had gotten wide.
Hi guys, very briefly, I put a lot of links in this one, all about Molly. The three Tumblr links are from an absolutely wonderful, in-depth and helpful blog and lay down a very good case for Molly likely being a surgeon. I think it makes absolute sense so I went with it. You might find it interesting so take a look if you like. The other link is directly to Molly's official BBC blog. It's no longer updated and only had a few entries but it's worth a look in as well.
"Well, gifts are rarely necessary but all the same."
I hope I was slow.
"Ok, darling, I'm sorry and I imagine this won't come as much of a surprise to you but I'm not following. Can you slow down and just tell me what you're on about?"
John awoke to a darkened room and the persistent buzz of Sherlock's phone.
"Yes, thank you." John said at the same time Sherlock said. "Here, hold her and once you've got her reach behind you and grab the bag with the colouring books and crayons."
"Yes, I suppose you did."
"Yeah...it was...very realistic. Did I say anything else?" He asked trying not to sound panicked.
"I'm sure it's fine, John," Sherlock said distractedly. He was completely engrossed in his phone as he had been all morning, before and after John's meeting as well as before and after breakfast. This was nothing new. Nor was his disinterest in the weekly shop. For Sherlock things he needed just appeared by wishes, or Brownies or his mum teleporting in and seeing to her dear boys' needs. In the past, it annoyed John and he imagined at some point in the future it likely would again. But for the time, being it was hardly a concern. He was more nervous about heading outside. And the fact that he was nervous about something as silly as this, when a year ago he wouldn't have thought twice, only made him cross with himself.
"NO! Yes!" He swore with frustration. "That isn't all. I can't... I couldn't be mad at her because...because I lied too. I dissembled, I kept things from her. Her story about being an orphan was patchy at best. We both knew it. She sat there and told me and waited, waited for me to press further. I don't know what would have happened but she was just waiting. But I didn't. I didn't say a word. I nodded and I agreed and I expressed my sadness at her absent family.
This is it. Today is the day.
"How do you want me tonight, John?"
How much of his life, he wondered had he spent begging Sherlock Holmes? What would he give to continue to be able to do it? Beg him to wash a dish, make tea, sit in their garden, watch the sunset, listen to the hum of the bees. He'd had so many years with him and all he wanted was more.
"Yes, it's been better, better since seeing Sherlock."
"I feel dread." He said honestly.
“I let you tie me up on our 5th anniversary.” John said as he started to resume washing then rinsing his hair, a task Sherlock had interrupted when he'd entered. “Then I wore the cock ring on your birthday.”
I love you too, Sherlock. I'm on my way home.
Hi Sherlock,
"There should be a reservation under Holmes-Watson." John said still smiling as they checked in.
, which one of us is the romantic?"
Breathe in. Breathe out. Give it time.
But first, he needed to plan the trip and badger Sherlock into going.
"Yes." he said drawing out the 's'.
"My mum...well she died quite a few years back. And you're the closest I have..."
"May I ask you one in return?"
"Well, I find you arousing, John. I find what we do to be sexually arousing I can't seem to help it. I've stopped trying to help it."
"Anything else?"
"I was frightened. I am a recovering user, I don't subscribe to the word addict, though my recovery had had quite a few false starts. But I know how quickly things can spiral out of control. It became apparent fairly soon that that was precisely what he wanted."
is a negative contraction denoting what you would
"Well, are you going to enlighten me?"
I just want her to stop talking. I'm actually a bit afraid. Afraid of what I might hear, what she might say.
He could pretend for a while. Pretend this was a luxury, a treat and not what had become an imperative. But it was all a lie and deep down he knew it. Still, he tried to stay in that headspace while he could. Being clean had felt good. There was always a siren call from each pub he passed but he still felt a spike of pride each time he didn't drink and didn't give in. He remembered something someone had said at the last meeting he'd gone to. "Do you have one more day in you?" Step by step, one day at a time sounded so cliche until you were right in the middle of it and looking at a lifetime of not drinking. A year was 365 days. The lifespan of the average British man was 79 years. He was 44. That was 35 more years or 12,775 days. He could not, under any circumstances do 12 thousand + days. Or 12 hundred days. Or 12 days, for that matter. But he could do one day. He could commit to doing one day. And that was really all sobriety asked of you. "Do you have one more day in you?"
"So you said and I heard you." Sherlock's eyes were locked with his. "John, I heard you. I accept your apology without reservation and I thank you."
"As much as I do love theater do you think you could truncate this speech and get to your point?" He snapped.
"I've got lunch scheduled with a mate of mine named Mike. He's a doctor, I may have mentioned him before. He's going to try and get me some work."
"Is there a place for gray in this world?"
But grace, it seemed, was in short supply, because now he was the poor stupid fool and it was all his own fault. He was humiliated but the last thing he wanted to do was just hang around outside the building of his former employer looking confused, angry and just a little weepy. He hailed a taxi, got in and asked him to take him to the nearest Nando's.
"Yes, he marched out about an hour ago, said he had things to take care of. Fancy some breakfast, John?" Mr. Holmes replied when he noticed John's silent, searching look about the room. "I'm a whiz in the kitchen these days."
John Watson changed my mind.
"Fine, remember our deal."
-together. Some of you may be surprised, some of you may be thinking it's about time. But in any case, I think it's only right you should all know."
One night, mid-dream he realized it was like him, the forest. Alive but dead. Dead but unable to die.
"Ok, well, good because I'm not going to change. And because once you get out there the real work begins. This was just the warm up. Not long from now you're going to start the main event."
"No. Now is the point where you warn me about what you can't do. I want to show you what I think you can."
"Thank you, John."
The lump in John's throat was so large he had a difficult time speaking around it. His lover had echoed his own thoughts perfectly.
"Yes, love?"
He cleared his throat and shifted in an effort to get comfortable in his chair.
"What
Sherlock slid further under the sheets, putting an arm around John's waist.
"I'm sorry...what?"
"She said-"John began
"Very good, John. It was, as expected a busy week and I think you did swimmingly. I just want to caution you that not every week will be bursting with successes. There are going to difficult ones ahead. Weeks where you struggle to find anything you feel that you didn't fuck up. Weeks where the biggest success you can come up with is getting out of bed or hovering in the doorway of a pub or window shopping down a liquor aisle and not going in and not buying anything. But you're just going to have to dig harder and realize their merit. Find and claim those successes. And you're going to think they're small and paltry and meaningless. But one of the goals of sobriety and aftercare and rehab and 12 Steps and therapy is that there are no little successes. Got it?"
He looked at her with confusion.
"I missed you." Sherlock said before he could.
"He's worried about you."
He hated analyzing his behavior but he was getting better at the exercise. "I guess...it was impulsive, spur of the moment. It was certainly ill conceived. I wasn't prepared to just jump back into that life again. Go from enforcer to student but I did a pretty good imitation of it. I got good grades and 5 years later I was a GP."
"Always thinking you're so much better." Came the voice from behind him.
"Yeah...is that Starbucks?" He asked motioning to her drink.
Jesus.
He crawled out of bed and swiped at the bottle of paracetamol that he kept nearby. He was just about to down it when he realized it would likely just come back up again.
"I'll look where I choose," Sherlock said, making sure to add a fake amount of haughtiness to his tone at being told what to do. But it was all in good fun and at John's request, he did indeed look up.
"Good night, Rosie." John added.
"The same. Blissful, as a matter of fact."
"John?" A voice asked and from the tone, he could tell it wasn't the first time.
"It's a doozy. But I think you'd much rather be surprised." John grinned before kissing him fully.
"I think I inhaled a bit of your shaving cream." He said with another cough and laugh.
"No, no, don't. Just keep going." I say through teeth that are far more gritted than I'd like.
“Pretty quick...I guess.”
"I'm sorry, what?"
"Maybe you shouldn't drink anymore tonight." He said gently as though it were a new idea.
Sherlock answered by changing his position and setting himself on the bed on his hands and knees.
"Boy's closer together so I can get a picture." Mrs. Hudson demanded and John, without thinking and also without apology again slipped his arm around Sherlock's waist. Mrs. Hudson proceeded to take several pictures of John, Sherlock and baby Rosie of which likely only one turned out.
They nodded. It didn't sound quite so different from what they'd done before and the prospect didn't make him want to run for it.
"Please, just let me finish. Once she saw she wouldn't be moved. They were much more raw then, practically brand new. She told me to stay right where I was and not to move. I was in so much pain I didn't have the energy to argue. She left and came back with salve and antiseptic and bandages. She cleaned me up and covered my wounds and...But that's not the point. Or rather it is the point but not the only one. When Mycroft came to get me out of Serbia, when we were back on safe soil he suggested I come back here, home, to our parent's house just for a day or so. He'd provide me with all the papers and equipment and surveillance footage I might need to keep an eye on the terror group. Everything to get me up to speed. He thought a mother's touch might be just the thing after what I'd been through. It's always easier for us to agree on who and what she is when we're not within close proximity. I was going to go. I got into a car to go, I was on my way but the closer we got the worse I started to feel. The more convinced I became that she would only exacerbate the situation. In the end, I had the driver turn around and take me back. I went directly to Mycroft's office, got a shave, a new suit, my marching orders and the address of where you'd be dining that evening and that was that. He didn't even question why I'd come back. He knew. Alright. You can ask me now."
"You're angry." John said incredulously. "Why did you never tell me you were angry about this?"
They followed her out of the store and into the crisp, evening air.
"I came because of that letter, not the drivel you wound up posting. I came for that John and to see if he was alright."
"You don't even know what I was going to say."
John thought for a second. He wanted to be glib, a part of him was screaming to dismiss the question and the text with something clever and light. But he couldn't.
And here we are.
He shifted uncomfortably in the chair. These memories were painful, unpleasant and vivid and going back to them always made him feel a bit queasy.
"What is your longest period of sobriety?"
"No, I shouldn't. But, like I said, very high clearance. You and your sister, what sort of terms are you on now?"
Funny thing. This means all the time that I was bored she was bored too. Retired superagent playing the nurse and hausfrau. Both of us smiling pretending everything was fine.
He turned to see a man of an average height and average build with average dark hair standing in the doorway a box in hand.
"You going back to crime fighting?"
"Your change and receipt, eh? Don't ya want 'em?" She called after him but he was already on the move. Weighed down by bags he pushed past the photog at the end of the belt and hurried out the door. They followed, fast on his heels as he hailed a cab, nearly surrounding him.
"Go on."
"Yeah and you tasted so bloody good."
Sherlock dismissed this statement by ignoring it.
"I didn't forgive her. Not fully. I mean, I forgave her for shooting Sherlock. Or, I was forgiving her... But that's not what I'm talking about. Layers upon layers. You picked up on this early on...you asked me if I often forgave when I didn't mean it. So did Sherlock. I don't know if Mary did but it's likely. We never talked about it but..."
"Hmmm..." He said pulling away from his lips and moving down his body again. "So much talk about what you aren't. But never a word about what you are."
Sherlock drew away the sheet exposing John's lower body. His cock was lying limply between his legs.
"Can I kiss you? On the lips?" He questioned.
Sherlock's words snapped him out of it. Blunt as they were, they were right.
Sherlock kept talking but John's mind was briefly short-circuiting. He hadn't expected this. Not in a million years. It wasn't that he thought Sherlock was commitment phobic, but rather that he didn't place much value in institutions. After all, they had both agreed to essentially living out their lives together. Surely that's what retiring to Sussex meant. But, though he was helpful and supportive while he and Mary were prepping for the wedding, he didn't seem to give much credence to the actual ceremony.
"Is it something I can help with?" John asked.
It was at that point I realized I was shaking. I brought my hands up to my face and let out a ragged sigh. This wasn't the first time I'd done this and it wouldn't be the last. And it was always the same for me. I figured out he was missing or someone alerted me, I'd go on the hunt, track him, drag him back home, clean him off and put him to bed. Typically, by the time the shower was done he was so exhausted, docile and maybe even contrite that he wordlessly let me tuck him in. I'd return to the couch, curl up, try to get rid of the shaking and go to bed with one eye on the door in case he tried to exit.
"No, not as of yet. Hopefully, she won't be."
Rosie squirmed in his lap and he wasn't surprised. He was probably putting off a negative vibe, his body having gone stiff.
"Hey, hey of course you did. I...I didn't realize a person could be so turned on without actually having an erection. I mean, that was stupid of me, orgasm happens in the brain not the genitals not really. Sherlock, you turn me on. After all, I'm the one who went in for seconds, nearly thirds. I needed to have my lips on that belly of yours and I needed to taste your come on my tongue and I needed to lick your cock. I had an absolutely amazing time and don't you dare try and talk yourself out of it ok?"
I released the kind of exhausted, frightened shuddering sigh that I made certain to never let him see. I then got up, went to the kitchen and put on the kettle.
John had thought Sherlock might object to any sort of formal wedding.
"Ok, ok, John, slow down. I'm not following. You have to slow down."
His cravings felt worse than they ever had at home but logically he knew this was because when he was there he had always given in to them immediately. But that didn’t stop the pain, the discomfort, the frustration and that feeling that just made him want to scream.
"Yes, just one. I've started a new relationship...with a man." He said clearing his throat.
...and hurt.
"Oh, John." He said and he looked so interminably sad John thought his heart might break just there. "
"For the napkins, John. French pleat or Cardinal hat." Sherlock said gesturing to the examples he created in what John felt was the blink of an eye.
Sherlock's grip on him was tight. So tight that when it loosened John knew immediately. There was the tell tale shift in the placement of his body as he prepared to get up, the creak of the bed, the slowed movement meant not to rouse him.
His need to touch Sherlock, to be touched, to have him close was overwhelming and so they fell back into the comfort of soft touches and conversations and voices and kisses. They were neither platonic nor lusty instead settling somewhere in between. They were just
"I may have done some preliminary scouting." With a small shrug.
"Ok, ok, then there's unlikely to be a neuroma. And do you have a full range of motion?"
P designated that it was a Promises meeting meaning it focused on the 12 Promises of AA. Meetings at The Location had covered every variation and combination and there were certainly some he preferred more than others. Promises wasn't a favorite but it would do for today.
"I love the way you taste." Sherlock whispered, his right hand shooting out toward the nightstand for the lube.
"Mmhmm" He replied already half vanished beneath the sheets.
"Sorry..." He breathed.
"When was the last time you slept?"
anymore. I have no intention of revealing every single inner thought that I have like the rest of you. But, I would like to advance our relationship. I passed by valuable milestones on the path my life has taken. Perhaps I dropped some bread crumbs and can find my way back. I'd like to go back and reclaim some of them now, with you, if you would be so obliging."
He watched as Sherlock clumsily reached for the lube and handed it back to him.
"You'll get lube tomorrow?"
"Molly took the bullets. You can ask her. It's just a conversation piece now."
"You alright?" John asked. "You look awful."
The image of Sherlock playing violin suddenly entered his mind, those fingers, those long, studied fingers one of which was inside him now, playing him like an instrument.
Even if he'd wanted to there wasn't time to sleep before morning duties called. He skipped breakfast and lunch and instead subsisted on a steady diet of black coffee which left him shaky and wired. Everything around him was hazy and distant, the people and their voices on lo-fi if not outright muted.
"Of course. Come to my office. Right now. Just come as you are."
"You're good." She replied. "They're not rules. But the are suggestions. This doesn't mean I want you to avoid physical contact. But what I just said about exercise and engaging your body in different ways applied here too. You can absolutely explore your sexuality with one another without having sex. It might not be a bad idea to try couples therapy for navigating these early steps. Neither of you has fully engaged your sexuality as a gay man or a bisexual man. Now that's something I want to encourage you to do both together and on your own. John, for you specifically, you're going to need to rethink your relationship with sex and the connotations you have regarding it."
“48 hours from now though, and not a moment more, this boat is going to sink into the Thames.” John felt an involuntary wave of panic and nausea surge through him as the concept of his impending death officially became real.
Mary was fluttering around the flat, shuffling files together and stuffing them into bags.
“The skin graft that covers his face continues to the back of his head. I assume that it’s covering the exit wound. That’s probably why the head is so smooth, because the suture line where the graft ends are under the chin and jaw and probably along the back of the neck as well as tucked behind the ears,” John shrugged and Sherlock stared at him confounded.
Sherlock glared at the other man.
“No Sherlock. This isn’t something I can negotiate on right now. If we had any sort of real case on him than maybe I could file you as a specialist and let you talk to him on the record, but right now we’ve only got him on trespassing, which will likely not hold very long since as much as Phillip Rogers may like to lock up someone from a rival gang, it is highly unlikely he’ll step forwards to press those charges since there are several warrants out for his own arrest. Trevor’s confession is basically useless as far as prosecution goes. It’s not technically illegal to be a gang member.”
“I’m sorry Doctor Captain The Peacemaker!” she yelped. “Do you think I’ll get a nickname as well, as your trusty side kick? Do you think someday they’ll make a movie about us? The first super hero movie based on a true story?” she laughed.
Things had been going pretty well, but apparently Mary and their man had been starting him off easy.
“Don’t you understand I have to do this? The message was for me! If you’d just shut up for a second and stop harassing me--!”
“Maybe, maybe not. Could you get together that research team you promised me and have them look into the movement of all narrow boats in the past two days, and check CCTV along the wharf to check for any narrow boats and their movements?”
“I’d like to speak to that friend of yours, the one that asked you to break into Roger’s flat,” Sherlock said, trying to sound assertive.
He tried to remember anything from before this, but the woman was right. He had flashes of bright lights and agony, but otherwise not much else since he was pulled from the river.
And then there was crashing noise, like a door being flung open.
John shook his head, trying to shake Sherlock out of his mind.
John woke up with a groan. He’d unfortunately become so used to waking up in captive situations over the past few months that he instantly began his routine for such situations without thinking about it. He began to scan his surroundings, realizing he was upright, likely strung from the ceiling, and began looking for means of escape. He appeared to be in some sort of old warehouse or factory, judging by the high ceilings and large, occasionally broken windows. There was a set of double doors on the other side of the long room. He then tested his restraints. Chains jangled above him. Leather cuffs attached to his wrists. Leather cuffs. John froze. It was then he finally remembered where he was this time and the panic set in.
“Business has been a little... slow. Hardly any at all. Seven, maybe eight,” Moran answered gruffly.
Search warrant issued, Sherlock, Lestrade, and a small team went to the flat and demanded entry. No one answered and the door was banged in. The police were supposed to go ahead and check to make sure that everything was clear. Sherlock, however, completely ignored protocool as he barged in.
,’ John’s hesitancy melted away.
“But the opponent had a partner, a friend of sorts, that seemed to be in the way. The man wanted the opponent all to himself, to toy with and crush. But this friend distracted the opponent. Made him
“But you survived, and I imagine that I can’t break you anymore now than I could before, though it’s for a different reason now than before. Before it was because you were already broken and couldn’t imagine a world without Sherlock, wasn’t it? Now though, it’s entirely the other way around. You can’t imagine the world without
Lestrade opened his mouth to ask for elaboration, but Sherlock was already ahead of him.
Moriarty hummed.
Sherlock felt like he’d been punched in the stomach. He couldn’t bring himself to move, so instead he stood paralyzed on the sidewalk until Victor stopped talking to the other man, and the other man stepped around Victor and continued on his way.
Which is why when a gunshot echoed, Sherlock found himself sprinting off in the direction of the sound. Never mind that he was in a rough neighborhood, and standard wisdom stated that one should run in the opposite direction of gunfire, Sherlock’s heart beat faster as adrenaline took over.
But not knowing what else to do, in a rash spur of the moment decision at a time when all proper strategy seemed useless, John played along.
“But Moriarty is out of the picture right now, he told me,” John exclaimed. “And Sherlock. And the Yard. And Mycroft. They’re all taking care of Moriarty. I don’t understand. How did you know I was on the boat anyway? If Sherlock couldn’t find me in time, then how could—,” John trailed off, confused and feeling awfully tired again.
“I’m quite alright, thanks.”
John slowly shook his head, his brow carefully furrowed.
Somewhere along the way John’s horror had morphed into confusion. He had closed the distance between himself and Sherlock and snatched the phone back, reading the text that Sherlock had read. The horror crossed his face again, but his brow remained furrowed.
“Yes, we’ve found that that’s often the best way. Criminals are very rarely honest about how much money they make. And usually in the inquiry something a bit more criminal will come up and they’ll get put away for at least a decade or two, or at the very least all of their assets will be repossessed and they’ll become useless to Moriarty. They’ll usually disappear off the grid completely in that case, just out of fear of Moriarty realizing that they’ve become unusable and coming to take them out himself.”
“But?” John asked.
The case, while he wasn’t exactly sure what he was supposed to be trying to achieve, proved interesting enough. He’d gotten Molly, who after a moment of surprise at Sherlock’s sudden appearance in her lab and a confused but concerned “How are you doing?,” which Sherlock ignored, she fell into step alongside him and agreed to test the sample of blood that Sherlock had collected from Mrs. Huxley’s wall.
John was coming home to him.
Finally, after another five stops, John was above ground again. He was supposed to be on a boat that was docked on the Isle of Dogs side of South Dock. A sense of foreboding began to fill John’s stomach as he got closer to the water. A the smallest, tiniest of voices in the back of his mind told him he was going to his death, but he pushed the thought away. No use getting worked up about it now.
John. John was on that boat. He just knew that John was on that boat. It made sense, more sense than anything had made in days and just enough in the sea of nothingness and confusion to make Sherlock believe it had to be true. Moriarty had had John get on a narrow boat in Canary Wharf, but then used a larger boat to move the narrow boat from the docks and down the river. John could have been on the river right across from him all night, for all Sherlock could remember, but he was in a bigger boat than Sherlock had been looking for.
Then Sherlock’s mind kept sorting through memories, spiraling farther and farther back.
The final thought echoed in John’s mind. It was quickly answered when Moriarty walked back towards him and held the phone screen before him.
But at least walking the river was something that felt productive, like maybe just maybe he could actually find John this way. If he wasn’t here then what else could he do? Go to his mind palace and hope to come up with something else?
Sherlock was already convinced. He knew nothing about John. Nothing at all.
am not the cruel one!” Sherlock erupted, jumping up from his chair.
“Now, Sherlock, I think that’s a bit overdramatic isn’t it? John, who you brought along because of his medical expertise, knowing a bit more about medicine then you isn’t exactly the end of the world. That’s why you have a partner, I assume,” Lestrade said.
“The collision John. We can’t do anything about it now that Sherlock’s involved. It’s too high risk. We'll have to wait until he backs off before going after them.”
There was a sound of the front door opening and closing again. Sherlock stood on the landing for a moment, his head spinning. Moriarty. Moriarty was back and he’d kidnapped someone. Someone important. The Peacemaker? Victor
He made sure any old experiments we're stashed in any odd places. Made sure there was nothing on the floor that John might trip over. He even dusted, swept, and vacuumed
“Shhhh, Johnny,” came a calm whisper. A hand pressed gently against his chest while another cupped the back of his neck. “Look at me, darling, look at me.” John did, looking into Moriarty’s brown eyes. He was horrified to find that the world seemed to still for a minute, giving John a chance to regulate his breathing and come back to the present.
“Oh, God, yes.”
John, his John, being so very brave and strong. So very brave and strong when he really should not have been.
“Look, I have other things to do right now besides tend to you, and you’re certainly not allowed to be having this much fun without me.”
“Wait, what’s that boat?”
Nearly an hour later, thanks to a tedious amount of traffic Sherlock stood outside the Canary Wharf underground station, and he started heading north. Lestrade hadn’t arrived yet, and he didn’t expect Mycroft to come along, this being a bit too close to the kind of field work he despised.
“How would you know?” John asked.
"What is the point of your presence here? Do you want me to hate him? Or are you trying to tell me that despite the fact that he was working for you, you're going to arrest him for murder? As if he hasn't suffered enough!"
“This is why you’ve been avoiding me, hasn’t it? Because you’re seeing someone else? You’re,” Sherlock struggled to even form the word. It felt out of place as he tried to form it in his mouth, as he tried to think about it in relation to John.
Sherlock froze at her indication over the confusion over this other persons gender. Is that why he hadn't already been parading his new lover through the flat like he usually did before that day Sherlock had finally made a move? Was it because he had finally come to terms with his deviation from the normative sexuality with a man who wasn't Sherlock and hadn't been ready to come out to the flatmate he'd once clearly been pining for? That could make sense, but it didn't help make Sherlock feel any less sick.
"I hadn't meant to see you tonight," he admitted. "I couldn't stand being in the hospital anymore. I was just taking a walk, and I guess I ended up here."
Sherlock took off after him, trying desperately to overtake him. He scanned through the maps of London that existed in his mind, trying to come up with some street he could chase the man down to corner him, or any other advantage he could possibly use to tackle the man. But the man’s knowledge of the area seemed to rival Sherlock’s. In fact, he knew things Sherlock didn’t. He’d climb up over skips to get out of the sight line of CCTV cameras, he knew the code to a security gate that led them through a private garden, he knew which fire escapes led up to vacant roof tops that had good access points to jump to the neighboring buildings.
on me?” Sherlock’s mind worked frantically to put all the pieces together. “Wait, no, it’s the other way around, isn’t it? That’s why you kept hesitating. Because you were already with someone else. You cheated on them,
After the doctor left the man and woman, Victor and Mary, apparently, had come back in. They detailed how they had been watching the boat, waiting for the right moment to save him. That they’d been watching Moriarty’s movements regarding John for weeks now. They couldn’t get to the boat until it went down, none the less do anything to help John earlier, out of fear that Moriarty would still be watching too closely. They needed the panic of the wreck. After it had begun to sink, Victor had gone in with scuba gear, but was delayed because of Sherlock’s vantage point and they'd had to move their boat to the other side of the wreck. No one could see John be pulled out of the Thames or it would “ruin everything.” And apparently "everything" was a secret initiative to bring Moriarty down.
The ache that overcame Mycroft when he spotted one of John’s jumpers wadded up by the pillow was one that Mycroft hadn’t felt towards Sherlock since he had been mourning the death of his beloved childhood pet dog, Redbeard. Mycroft found himself wandering into Sherlock’s room, reaching out and letting his fingertips graze the material of the jumper.
John didn’t respond for a moment, peering over Victor’s shoulder to make eye contact with Mary. Victor already knew the answer, anyway, he’d practically let John tackle him. John was so physically compromised that all it would take was a thrust backwards from Victor to send John to the floor at the moment.
Moriarty had gone back to stroking John’s jaw and John continued to try and figure out what the fuck was going on. But he couldn’t. In fact the worst part was that what Moriarty was saying in a way made sense, in a twisted way. Putting aside the very obvious fact that his and Moriarty’s moralities obvious did not match up, it was a decent proposal for a future for John when he otherwise couldn’t imagine one.
John was still looking at Sherlock, his eyes large and desperate.
“Then why won’t you come?” Sherlock finally asked quietly.
“Well, it’s been fun mate,” Moran nodded at John before exiting the room.
Sherlock hadn’t made it.
If Sherlock had been a different man, perhaps he would have taken all of these interventions as a sign. But Sherlock did not believe in any sort of world order. There was no fate or destiny. Notions like “soul mates” where just societal ideas that encouraged the continuation of the traditional family model. It was a ridiculous concept that relationships were built of innate bonds rather than common interests and time and sexual attraction.
Eventually the car Victor was in slowed to a halt. Sherlock stuffed a few more twenty pound notes to the cabbie and got out of the car before it had even come to a complete halt. He looked ahead to see the blond woman who had been with Victor heading into a building. Sherlock quickly pursued.
“Does this person have a name?” John asked.
Silence fell over the room. Sherlock could tell that Lestrade and Mycroft were having some sort of silent conversation trying to figure out what should be done about him. But Sherlock didn’t need anything to be done about him, he needed them to leave him to his work.
“I was just thinking that if he’s been hiding out, surely he could hide out on the continent and help us. I’m sure our man can get us some sort of fixer to arrange for him to be moved out of England and the paperwork to allow him to move around Europe, at least, until we move on to other places and need to cross oceans or more secure borders.”
And without another second to sort out the details, Sherlock was flying down the last set of stairs and out of the building, hailing a cab and telling it to tail the car he had just caught Victor and a mysterious blonde woman slide into before the engine roared and pulled away from the curb.
“There’s been a murder! More than one! A possible serial killer!” he exclaimed, sounding absolutely giddy.
“Has John mentioned anyone new in his life recently?” Sherlock asked, cutting straight to the point.
“You’re a piece of work, you know that? Moriarty doesn’t exactly go around asking for consent before taking what he wants from people. You’d never have been able to say no.”
“Well, Sherlock, it is a possibility. We’ve been trying our best, but we’re not getting anywhere. None of the narrow boats around Canary Wharf have any association with Moriarty. There is some CCTV on the water, but there are definitely plenty of gaps. And none of the ones anywhere near London for that matter seem to have any easily identifiable ties, anyway. And let’s face it, unless its summertime in Ely, people don’t really boat recreationally on the river, none the less with narrow boats. That’s why Morris and Steven’s boat sunk, after all, because no one had taken a boat on the part of the river they were on since September and no one had noticed that a long sunk steel rowboat had been carried down the river and found itself wedged in to protrude from the sediment and would tear into the bottom of their narrow boat.”
deduced John’s problem. He had figured out that Moriarty had traumatized John more than he initially thought. However, he couldn’t get John to tell him why, even after Sherlock had promised to protect him, and Sherlock kept seeing that look of terror sometimes cross John’s face.
John couldn’t help but bark out a laugh. The notion was preposterous. Moriarty had lost it, hadn’t he? He must have, what else could he be playing at? Moriarty kept talking as John tried to wrap his head around what was going on. He wasn’t dumb. Despite the multiple times he's been knocked unconscious in the past year, he didn't have any major brain damage. He knew now that making deals with madmen about exchanges of sacrifices didn’t turn out very well for anyone, particularly himself.
“There were only two researchers plus a couple student assistants involved in that study. All of them seemed horrified, frankly that their research had been used in such a way, and given the fact that they are all Americans who have never crossed the Atlantic, it seems like they all have a good alibi. I honestly think we’re just lucky they even got back to us so quickly,” Lestrade informed Sherlock.
John swam as fast as he could towards where the door should have been. Exerting himself and the rising panic was not at all helping his cause. Somehow, despite the chains still binding his wrists, John made it upwards towards where he thought the stairs that led to the exterior door of the boat were.
He had gotten John to stop reading his ridiculous medical journals in favor of every single newspaper that he could get his hands on, even the crap commuter papers that were glorified tabloids that men shouted at you to take outside of underground stations. Of course it didn’t matter to Sherlock what celebrity had died or had an affair most recently, what Prince Harry was up to now a day, or that Parliament was completely incompetent in general. But he hoped somewhere in the pages John would find something interesting.
Sherlock didn’t even bother to read Mycroft’s texts before he put the phone down and bounded across the room to John.
“Well, I don’t know, I just, I thought that there was something familiar about the way he stood,” Sherlock snapped, but there was a meekness to it.
“Of course John’s fine, more than fine, but I need a name, Sarah!” Sherlock was growing impatient. He didn’t want to hear about how happy John was, and certainly not with a man that wasn't him.
“Oh, God, John,” the wrecked words slipped from Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock looked back up at Mycroft and Lestrade then, springing into action. “How long has he been missing?”
He then demanded that Sherlock finish his glass of orange juice and the small mountain of biscuits that he had already laid out on a plate anyway, no matter how he wanted to eat them.
Sherlock grumbled as he walked out of the Yard at Lestrade’s suggestion. But he couldn’t sit alone in his empty flat. He’d do anything but spend the evening alone, waiting, feeling helpless and unable to figure things out.
Lestrade softened.
“What,” John paused, trying to figure out how to phrase the question without saying more than he could. He couldn’t do this unless Sherlock had at least a little warning. “What if this doesn’t work out?”
He had always imagined that romantic relationships would get in his way, that even just sex alone, none the less the obligations of anything more, would pose an unnecessary distraction. He had even thought that he would perhaps be unable to feel such feelings, since he valued his work over all else. But since he had met John Watson it had become increasingly clear that Sherlock was, in fact, capable of having romantic feelings for someone, and that those feelings would come to compromise his work.
Suddenly, everything made sense.
Crowds of people rushed around him, in and out of the station. None of them had any idea what had been happening. They didn’t know that Moriarty threatened their lives. They certainly didn’t know that he had already destroyed Sherlock’s.
. Which made sense, because he’d been at work all morning. Which was something that Sherlock already knew.
Moriarty all but ignored him.
He looked again, this time harder. Trying to find any out of place detail.
"Well, I've got to run. I'll see you again sometime, I hope."
He’d revisit the thought later, but right now he needed to get out of this god forsaken pub and go into his mind palace. He’d reconnect with Victor later when he had developed a new approach to extracting information from the man.
The woman hushed John and knelt down beside him.
John groaned, “I don’t want to talk about it.”
“IT WOULD BE IN THE PALM OF
“Once upon a time there was a man who wasn’t quite like everyone else. He had dreams bigger than everyone else seemed to be able to fathom. Life was easy for him, though, despite having to exist in a world of imbeciles, because it turns out, the idiotic masses are quite easy to control. And there was nothing the man loved more than control.
“Yeah, kind of like J-,” Sherlock stopped. “Like a soldier.” Victor laid an arm on his shoulder and looked at him sympathetically. Sherlock and Victor had never formally spoken about John, but Sherlock had always worked with the assumption that somehow or another Victor knew, about all of it. How he knew Sherlock didn’t know, and couldn’t bring himself to ask.
? Is something wrong, Sherlock? Is John alright?”
He had tried, of course, to stop even these these outings from happening, but John refused to quit his job or stop seeing his friends, or to agree to let Sherlock come along. At the mere suggestion from Sherlock, John threw a fit, calling Sherlock controlling, stating that he still needed his space sometimes, telling him that there was no way this could work if he didn’t let him live his life. It was the biggest row in their two weeks of being in a relationship, and John had slept in his own bed that night.
The next time he woke up, the clock read 27 hours. He considered what kind and what dose of sedative would be enough to keep him under for that long, but John didn’t particularly care. It wasn’t exactly as if he had wanted to savor his remaining time on earth. Plus, his shoulder wasn’t killing him anymore.
The walk back to the flat felt so impossibly long. The warm of Sherlock's hand in John's own was wonderful, but it wasn't nearly enough. However, the second they made their way up the stairs and crossed the threshold into the flat, Sherlock’s lips crashed back into John’s and the journey home wiped itself from John’s memory and he was no longer sure anymore exactly how they had gotten to this point.
you, don’t you think Johnny?”
“Victor?”
. At least when Sherlock gets bored and wants to die, he does it slowly, doesn’t he, with the drugs? When you get bored and want to die though, you’ll fire a bullet into your head. Doesn’t give anyone much time to save you does it? And so many people want to save you, don’t they? Your friend at the Yard, both the Holmes boys, your two new crime fighting pals, they all would happily throw themselves in front of a train to save you. Couldn’t you let me save you Johnny, instead? Save them from making any unnecessary sacrifices.”
So Sherlock was now curled up on the sofa, facing away from the rest of the room, clenching his aching stomach and brooding horribly. John sat across the room, probably reading about the advancements of antimalarials or something else that was obviously completely irrelevant to everything.
“Repressed emotions?” John squawked, still hoping to sound scandalized but instead just sounding pathetic.
"Give it time Sherlock. We're doing all we can to get him here." Victor said softly, clearly reading Sherlock with ease.
Sherlock hadn’t doubted that whatever place Victor had in mind was
“Related to the Peacemaker?” Sherlock asked before he could stop himself. The truth was, his brain seemed to be misfiring, and backtracking to the last train of thought pre-panic seemed to be the best option. It was far easier than considering the other train of thought that had brought his mind directly to a halt.
“And he’s said nothing else since?”
At midnight, he couldn't take it anymore.
John was sore. He was pretty sure at least seventy five percent of his body was covered in bruises. Honestly, he was far too old for this kind of shit. He was getting way too close to forty and his body was quickly becoming useless.
“That’s because he’s gone abroad! There’s been rumblings of him all over the world! It’s ridiculous,” Sherlock huffed.
When Sherlock finally finished, he was panting.
“DJMS 11.12? What are you on about Sherlock?”
“Really Sherlock, we don’t have time for you to pout because you got something wrong. It happens to the best. What we need to do is find John. I’m worried about him.”
to you,” Moriarty reached up and stroked along John’s jaw where the scar lay hidden under his beard.
John and Mary were sat on the sofa in their flat, beers in hand, for a little post-mission-stroke-operation-or-whatever-the-hell-it-was-they-were-doing-now-a-day celebration.
“Well John, for all intents and purposes, you have been burned from Sherlock’s life. And given your skill, training, and experience with Moriarty, we’d like to recruit you now to join us. You're on the outside now.”
It probably would be enough time, if there were any chance that Sherlock was going to miss John, to want to forgive him. But he wasn’t going to. He heard beeping and raised his eyes just enough to see Moriarty fiddling with a large digital clock on the wall right across from him. The clock beeped one more time and a countdown began.
“Going to send Sherlock more messages? I thought you told me you were done with him?” John asked, feeling the need to break the silence as it finally becoming less relaxing and more jarring.
Sherlock felt panic rise in his chest at the prospect of returning to the flat.
Some bloke that was known only by the ridiculous name of The Peacemaker.
Sherlock said nothing for a moment. “So where are you living?” he asked finally.
He’d considered not going quite this out of the way. There were of course ways to get illicit substances without going instantly too far into throws of addiction right away, but clearly the more casual approach, the picking a few grams on a street corner, locking himself away in his flat, and digging out his old equipment from where he’d hidden it under the floorboards, was not going to work. Too many people to come by unannounced and drag him off to rehab, assuming he could even manage to get the drugs without interruption in the first place, as had become a problem.
John, “
“We have 47 hours and 49 minutes still Johnny. Don’t you think we should have some fun in the mean time?”
And with that he turned around and began walking back down the hall. Sherlock waited a moment, feeling a bit dumbstruck, but once his brother disappeared from sight, Sherlock found himself walking slowly in the same direction.
John went with another one of his signature shrugs.
“And?”
After a few moments he spoke.
“Alright Watson, I’ve got to abandon ship, just in case Sherlock shows up, even though we both know he won’t.  Boats been anchored. Boss has taken care of everything else so you’re not going to be boarded by the Met or anything for violations, don’t get your hopes up. The ships rigged to go down right when that timer hits zero, but we’re not blowing it up or anything, so it will probably take some time for it to sink. You’re not gonna be sitting here for hours with water around your ankles or anything, but you’ll have just enough time for the terror of your own impending mortality to fuck with your mind.  But I’ve got one more gift for you before I leave,” Moran grinned, “And you get to help me pick it out.”
, John though,
“Sherlock, do you realize how cruel you’re being right now?” Lestrade finally said, and it was like a bomb exploding in Sherlock’s mind.
“You seem to think so, moaning it in your in bed at night,” she waggled her eyebrows suggestively.
John nodded slowly, absorbing the information.
“No. No. I mean. Yes. But don’t be sorry. There is no place left for me in that world anyway, not after everything I’ve done.”
A look of surprise again from Mycroft, but once again it quickly passed. "I'm not a psychologist, but I do believe that John doesn't anticipate there being a reality in which you want a future with him."
“Just tea. No milk, just sugar. And don't you dare suggest food. And I don’t want to go too far from the river. I just feel like I have to stay close," Sherlock said with determination. Then his voice got quieter and sounded frankly un-Sherlock-like as it wavered with uncertainty. "I can’t explain it, but it seems like the only thing that makes sense.”
“Sherlock--,” Mycroft began.
Eventually he did find himself in a cab heading to Baker Street. When the cab pulled up to the flat he pushed a twenty pound note towards the driver and got out, not even bothering to look at the meter. It was probably enough. Probably too much, but Sherlock couldn’t remember how long he was in the cab for. The driver didn’t seem to complain though and Sherlock went inside the building and walked up the stairs and opened the door of 221B.
John held his breath while he walked away, wondering if Mary or Victor behind his would take action to stop the man from leaving. But they were people of orders, maybe not ex-military like John, but disciplined just the same or actually even more. And to kill Moriarty if given the chance was never one of their orders. After Moriarty had slid out the door and it shut firmly behind, John still sat still in his chair, and everyone else stayed still with him. He wondered how long he could sit like this before someone else would make a move. How long could he hold command over  the room? If he just sat here, would the world stay still for him?
“We were never trying to destroy the world,” John murmured.
Moriarty set down the razor and the towel and took up a bottle, pouring a liquid into his palms and warming it between his hands. He then brought his hands to John’s cheeks with a slap. John hissed at the sting of the aftershave. The cold burn seeping into his pores, however, seemed to reset something within John’s mind. It was like he’d been drenched in ice water, and had now snapped out of it.
Sherlock came over after a while and brought him both Bumbly and another slice of cake as he'd never eaten the first.
"Not fully. I mean we touched on them."
"I cannot argue there. So, what do you propose?"
But he’d actually had a much more brilliant and simple plan in mind.
"Wait...what?" John asked turning his face toward him.
God, it felt good to be back on a case! I'm getting like you, positively ghoulish but a mystery dead boy in a car? Yes, please!
He went in for another kiss which John returned hungrily.
Sherlock dutifully took a seat and John went about making a fresh plate for him.
I stopped Sherlock putting my hand to his chest.
John raised his hand, touched the tender but thankfully not obvious spot on his neck that Sherlock had indeed left and smiled.
gay."
John turned to look at him, shaking his head slightly in disbelief. It was all so sentimental and romantic and kind.
"You're tight, John. I believe I can make you feel better." His voice was low, a bit...entrancing?
Sherlock made the first bold move in that area much to John's surprise and relief.
"And you've got Rosie. You two go on pretty well. Take her for a weekend."
John swallowed hard as now that Sherlock had put the imagery in his head he couldn't stop picturing it. Though he wasn't fighting very hard against it.
"It's usually Mycroft and I. We usually...split our duty with them. It will be difficult and odd to handle them by myself." He said gripping the steering wheel.
"Yeah, as fucking hoods." She said with a derisive snort.
"Ummm...cadaver!"
make you bisexual. I enjoyed sleeping with women. Therein lies the difference."
"Agreed. Anything else?"
John responded with a laugh and proceeded to get out of bed. As Sherlock spoke John got out of bed, naked, and made his way over to the window to look out. He could smell the briny scent coming off the Channel in the distance. The air was cool and fresh and he closed his eyes before slow blinking, allowing it to wash over him.
"John, Thai Massage?"
He paused. He knew if he were to be honest it wasn't going to sound good but there was little choice.
"You have?" Sherlock asked curiously.
"And this was supposed to be our day off." John chuckled as he picked up cleaning where Sherlock had left off. He felt, in a word, relieved. The entire day had dredged up memories he wasn't even remotely comfortable with and he anticipated unpleasant dreams to follow. But to know that he hadn't scared Sherlock off, or turned his stomach wasn't something he was just going to sweep under the rug. Hanah had told him to appreciate not just each success but each event that worked out better than you'd thought it would. Combine that with the reality that he had maybe had a breakthrough with his sister and...well...could this mess of a 24 hours actually be considered a good day?
