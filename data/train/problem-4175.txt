But now the moon is trying its hardest to fight against the dark clouds, and Dean could feel his hands trembling in need. What he needed, he wasn’t quite sure, but he did know two things for certain. He was in town for a stupid convention, and he knew his old friend was still residing in the same old apartment. His old friend knew
“That makes no sense,” Cas growled, angel blade poised ready to strike. Benny clasped a hand on Dean’s shoulder. They shared a look. Dean sighed heavily.
His breathing became hollowed out and cold. A gentle hand touched Dean’s cheek, glowing a warm gold, not unlike Cas when he heals. Dean looked to see Emma’s eyes sparkling green with flecks of that graceful blue shimmering through. A slow-churning warmth spread from Dean’s cheek down his neck towards his heart. Was she doing this? Was she causing a heart attack?
“You can try, Cas, but it’s gonna take a long time to stop me from―” Dean choked as his throat started to close. He opened his mouth to try and take in air, and Castiel pushed his thumb past his lips.
now, so he was a little bit shaky. Also, the formula had changed quite a bit from the eighties, but the process was almost the same. He had shaken the bottle until the formula was diluted into the water, and Emma was gurgling and guzzling happily in no time.
“So,” Dean turned to Castiel, who still held his professional stance. He smirked as he noticed Cas’ eyebrow twitch, the only sign he was close to breaking composure. “That went better than expected,”
Or perhaps that was truly Dean’s eyes. The petals on his lips and skin were sickly sweet, and Dean used his fingertips to pluck them away from his face. All the pinks, and reds, and whites, and purples. Some of the red petals had mixed colors so well with the purple and white, they were coming out blue. Dean could only imagine the bruised colors dashed on his face, speckled by the soft pink.
“I’m doing well, and they’ve been good,” He left it at that, and Dean didn’t want to press it any further. “So, how goes the courtship life?”
“― ”I got laid”. Yes, I remember that, but I honestly thought he was only doing that to rile me up, as you two like to say,”
‘What’s there to talk about?’ Dean repeated. ‘All I know is when you touch me like that, I feel...’ He was speechless.
louder than that, come on, Joe,’ He picked up the holy water bottle, opening the lid just so a small spritz could escape. He squeezed the bottom of the bottle, aiming for the open wound.
of my non-existent friendship with Crowley,’ Dean glanced back up to the mirror, and he let the smirk cover his face at the sight of Castiel glaring at him. The angel’s cheeks were flushed, and his lips were pursed tightly. ‘Oh wow, you
“He’s praying to me, asking me to wake you up,” Cas tilted his head. “He’s threatening to put salt in your coffee if you don’t go help him out,” Dean chuckled.
at him, and slowly pulled his lips up and down Dean’s length. The angel continued pressing his fingers inside him, hitting his prostate with every few thrusts in and out. Dean honestly would’ve been happy to let Cas continue his ministrations until the world ended, but he needed
“You should get back in the car, Cas. Emma needs someone to stay with her,” Dean kept his voice devoid of emotion. Cas shook his head.
This was Dean’s home, but Cas could tell he had added little things to include both Jack and Cas. The kitchen was large, open-plan, and filled to the brim with different cooking attempts by Dean. The air was permeated with caramel, apple, and something spiced like cinnamon and cloves. Next to the kitchen door was a door clearly marked for Jack, with the door painted a bright blue with a slap-dash streak of lime green near the door handle. Cas could tell Jack painted it himself. The hardwood floors creaked and groaned as the angel approached the dining table, which was laden with even more baking. Dean gestured for Cas to take a seat at the head of the table as he took a seat to Cas’ left side. Jack wandered off into the kitchen, the fridge door making a gentle noise as it opened.
“Your soul, as I’ve told you before, is the brightest I’ve ever seen in all my existence. It was why I found you so easily in Hell. She shares the same golden hue,” Cas dropped his gaze back to the letter. “Wait, you searched for her as well in Purgatory?”
editor now, that’s gotta amount to something!” Dean smirked as the mince sizzled in the pan. Cas shook his head as he poured the shots of tequila and triple sec into the ice.
for me,” With that, Castiel stepped out of Dean’s space, and the feeling of cold water started to slowing submerge around his head. “You’ll want to be quick, boy, otherwise the spell will make you sick if you’re away from me for too long,”
rang out loudly in his head, and Dean looked up to see the pupils of Cas’ eyes almost swallow his blue eyes completely.
you; I’d throw it all away,” Cas brought his hands down to Dean’s shirt, slowly peeling back the layers until the hunter was standing only in his jeans and his undershirt. “Heaven, the war, the angels, my family and followers, all of it, for
“Why would I want you screaming, Dean? That’s something you only do when you’re in pain, and as I told you earlier―”
annoyed at Sam. If it hadn’t been for Sam’s spill, he wouldn’t have come across Cas’ poem. Everything seemed a little convenient, however, so he waltzed into the War Room to find Sam. He saw his brother sitting at his laptop, having just hung up from a Skype call with Eileen. Dean went to speak to him, but he also noticed Cas sitting a little further off, reading something. He frowned.
“I’m not―your gift is not a carrot, Sam,” Cas frowned. Sam let out a dry chuckle. “Oh, that’s…an expression, isn’t it? Like using my gift as a form of reward system,”
“Don’t put all your eggs into one basket, Your Highness. What if you find you’ve settled for Benny when your best option was actually just around the corner the whole time?” Charlie tutted at him. Dean rolled his eyes, ignoring the irony of Cas waltzing into the room at that very moment to announce Crowley’s arrival.
“Hey, brother,” Benny smirked, arms crossed and wearing the expression Dean had seen a thousand times before. Cas had just teleported them, and Dean knew all too well how it felt the first time he experienced angel transportation. He frowned at the blood splattered on his clothes. “It’s dried. Some Leviathans got the jump on us, but we got them, don’t worry.” He gestured to his side, and Dean saw the tears cascading from his angel’s ocean blue eyes before he felt the softest hug he’s ever had.
“Dean Winchester, you are,” He pressed a kiss to his jaw. “An insufferable,” His cheek. “Arrogant,” His nose. “Cocky,” His eyebrow. “Asshole.” His lips. Dean couldn’t help the smirk on his face as Cas pulled away.
The silence between them remained heavy as they continued to follow Benny. Instead of filling the space with words, Benny just walked between the two, gently nudging Dean as they walked. Every step they shared seemed to shake up a small amount of dust on the ground, glittering with sparks of silver and bronze. Dean frowned at the forest floor, but he refused to break the silence.
“Not sleeping well?” Charlie, to her credit, softened completely. She rested a hand on Dean’s knee, and the prince let out a heavy sigh. “Isn’t the anniversary coming up soon?”
” The moan reverberated through the entire nightclub, making the glass chandeliers and smoky mirrors around them quake and tremor, causing some cracks to form. Dean felt Cas’ seed inside him, already trying to drip out past his stuffed hole. Castiel let out a low hum, pressing sloppy kisses all over Dean’s shoulders, his neck, his cheek.
He never knew humans could make such pained cries before. Sure, he’d read about it in countless pieces of literature and seen it in numerous movies, but he thought that was just for dramatic effect. Sam didn’t know how long it was before he pulled himself up from the dirt, but the sun had well and truly set, and stars were shining in the night sky. Still, Castiel stood, holding onto Sam. Silence swept over their collective sadness.
“I think you already know the answer to the question,” He reached out, gently touching the curve in Dean’s neck, feeling the pulse thrashing violently against the hunter’s skin. “Are you angry with me?” The venom in Dean’s green eyes looked vicious, but there was a softness there too.
“Making frozen margaritas,” Cas grabbed the alcohol, giving the bottles a shake as he made his way back to the counter. “Did you want one?”
“Cas,” The words just made Dean’s face redder, and he felt his heart hammer in his chest. Dean was more of a giver when it came to affection, and had never been well-equipped to accept it in the first place. But Cas seemed determined to get him used to it, never yielding in his compliments and caresses. Even now, Cas just stared at him before pressing gentle kisses to Dean’s cheeks. Down his jawline. His neck. His collarbone. Dean bit back a moan as he felt Cas’ tongue chase his skin there. “
‘Jesus Christ, you two are fucked!’ Joe spat out blood onto the floor, and Castiel broke his connection with Dean’s soul. Dean stared up at Cas, tears streaming down his face. Cas kept his eyes on Dean and must’ve been satisfied with what he saw looking back at him. ‘No wonder Abaddon hates you so much, Dean. Fraternising with angels...’ The hairs on the back of Dean’s neck prickled, but he kept his gaze on Cas. The angel brought his hand to Dean’s cheek and caressed his thumb gently down the side of Dean’s face, much to Joe’s apparent disgust. ‘Honestly, I’ll be glad to be dead, because if I have to deal with more of Abaddon’s demons thinking of following you with this glittering ball of puke by your side, I’d sooner march right into Vermillion and tell Abaddon―’
you, Dean?” He growled out. “How long have you been wanting me to stake my claim on you, take control of you, make you mine?” Cas licked a stripe of sweat from Dean’s neck before biting into a bare patch of skin.
“I’m…I…” Air was becoming thin, even though they haven’t moved an inch. Eileen dropped down to her knees, then, and held Sam softly. She stroked his hair and rubbed his back in a soothing motion.
Jack didn’t make it a fancy, ceremonious event; just made sure the newly human Castiel made his way to the front door of the Bunker before flitting away back to Heaven. His child wasn’t one for theatrics, which had confused Castiel at first. But he supposes, it makes sense. Jack is also Sam and Dean’s child, too. Sam never liked shouting out his intentions before he made a move, and Dean was used to being invisible.
“Well, sure, but it feels a little...exposed, don’t you think?” Dean wandered back to his lounge, flopping down defeatedly.
“Well, I’m gonna teach Cas how to shoot, and then we’re gonna go a couple of rounds in that new gym space,” Dean faltered. “
“I can look after her,” Sam called out. Dean stepped away from his little family to consider Sam gently. “I promise she’ll be safe. I won’t leave the Bunker,”
to make him hyper-aware of Dean tonight, didn’t he? At the thought of his friend, Cas remembered the message Balthazar had sent earlier in the night. He waited until he heard Dean walking down the hallway into his room. He listened in the darkness of his bedroom for his companion to turn on his shower, and only once he heard the water rushing from the guest ensuite, Castiel stepped blindly towards his bed, throwing his phone onto the duvet before stripping completely naked.
in a while. Benny raised a curious eyebrow, before turning to Cas. “Look at you, angel. Not plannin’ on runnin’ off on our boy this time, are you?” He chuckled at the rigid setting of Castiel’s shoulders.
The whole family stood waiting in the entrance hall, Dean at the centre with Sam and Mary flanking him. A short distance from the Royals stood the rest of the family― Castiel, Gabriel, Bobby directly behind their charges against the wall, Arthur and Charlie standing to the side near the door leading to the dining room. As the door swung open, Dean felt his shoulders stiffen. He had no idea why he was so nervous to begin with. It was
“So, are we boyfriends?” He raised an eyebrow. Castiel didn’t know how to respond. He knew he should offer the truth, but his traitorous lips would not utter the words. Part of him wanted to see where this would lead. “I only ask because I’d like to think if you
‘I just...I don’t like your friendship with Crowley. He seems to think the two of you are best friends,’ His voice cracked around the words “best friends”, and Dean had to bite down a grin. ‘What?’
“Michael did say there were some changes. Apparently, this was one of them. Strange though,” Cas tilted his head, scuffing his shoe at the ground. “Do you remember this place at all? This specific space, I mean,” Dean frowned, looking around again.
Dean’s heart had thudded painfully in his chest with Cas’ hands on him, but here, with everybody’s eyes on him as he danced with his date, he only felt determination. He had to do this. Fuck Lord Adler for his biphobia. Fuck propriety. Fuck the whole system for making him jump through these hoops. Fuck Castiel for being the only damn one he wanted out of all his choices.
'Wouldn't be so sure of that, pretty boy,' Dean's perfect green eyes flickered black, and Castiel couldn't stop his wings flaring in a show of enmity. Dean's smug grin only spread wider. 'Damn, Cas. You been holding out on me?' He brought his normal eyes back, and there was a shimmer of awe in his gaze. Cas' wings stilled. He had forgotten Dean could now see his true form, broken and mangled as it was. The thought made him nervous, and it must've shown in his wings. 'Aww, come on, angel. Don't be shy,' Dean raked his eyes over Cas' form with a dark hunger.
“Lord Benny Lafitte, of course,” Crowley dropped Dean’s gaze and poked lazily at the remnants of his dinner with his fork. “You’re keen on him, aren’t you?” The prince let out a breath he wasn’t aware he held, before giving Crowley a small smile.
“…shut up, jerk.” Sam rose out of his chair and pulled Eileen into a wide bear hug. Dean watched as Sam pressed a gentle kiss to Eileen’s head before pulling back to sign, “Are you sure you don’t want to go back to sleep?”
As they entered the room, Dean could see the demon in question was tied down to a broken chair. Spikes of wood were pressing into the demon’s meatsuit lightly, but Dean could already anticipate how useful those spikes would be. The wood on the chair looked worn by age, and it looked out of place in the otherwise pristine and fresh bedroom.  Crowley had even had the fortitude to lay a plastic tarp down on the floor underneath the demon. Dean huffed a laugh at that. He can fault Crowley for many things, but one thing he would never call him out on is his ability to be
“This,” Cas took a gentle hold of Dean’s left shoulder, and the vice grip loosened. Always, always, always, Castiel was there to soothe the fearful thrashing of his anxieties. “Is Emma. Amara’s parting gift to Dean and I suppose, me, too,” Sam frowned, stopping in his path towards Dean. The taller man’s shaggy mane of hair danced with his slow shake of the head.
“Take my hand, you idiot,” Dean smiled, flexing his fingers. Cas let out a soft ‘oh’ before taking the offered hand and grasping his mug with his other hand. Together, they made their way up the stairwell, past the bedrooms and shared bathroom, to the half-stairway and through the storm door leading to the rooftop.
“You Winchesters, honestly. Sam’s the same. He blames himself too. Wouldn’t be surprised if the Queen blames herself somehow, too,” She muttered. Silence settled heavily on Dean’s chest, and he mulled in it as he chewed away at the apricots on his plate.
. This wasn’t the first time Cas had borrowed Dean’s clothes, of course. There had been many mornings― after spending one too many hours dancing, wine-drunk, in their kitchen late into the night― where Dean would take their greasy hangover breakfast out onto the balcony. Cas would always get cold from the brisk morning wind, so Dean always pulled out his favorite wool-lined Sherpa jacket for Cas to snuggle under while they drank their coffee together. A wretched sob made its way out of his lips as the memories curled up in his head like beloved pages of water-stained books.
The mud kicked up a spray onto Dean’s face as he tumbled into the ground. If it weren’t for Cas’ ironclad grip on his shoulder, he would’ve gone free-falling into the expansive crack in the earth.
“I am whatever you want me to be, whatever you need me to be,” He whispered like his devotion was a conspiracy. “An enemy to fight, a friend to sit in silence with, a brother in arms, a lover in the sheets,” His eyes sparkled with warmth as Dean huffed a small laugh. “Whatever you will have of me,”
“Fighting,” He shrugged, pulling away, taking up a defensive stance an arms’ length away from the hunter. Dean cocked his head.
“Cas,” Dean smiled even as his voice came out hoarse and broken. He brought his hands to Cas’ face, pressing his forehead against the angel’s. “Thank you.” The small whisper was a delicate as the feeling in his heart, small silk webs of hope and fragility bonding themselves together. Maybe he could let himself open up, not just to himself and not just to Cas, but to everybody else. Especially Sam. He knows, deep in his heart, Sam would never treat Dean the way John did. His brother was the product of Dean’s raising, and he could confidently say he raised a man devoid of the shadowed hatred Dean was drenched in by their father.
“The trick is to control your breathing and try not to let the smoke sit,” Cas smiled as the smoke curled out of his lips. Dean didn’t want to miss a single sparkling moment between them, so he brought his lips closer to Cas’ and tried to suck in the grey air around him. “Very good, now let go, Dean.” He felt a little light-headed as the smoke spilled back out from his lips, and he braced himself by using his free hand to grip the older man’s bicep.
“If you’re doing what I think you’re trying, you’re going to need more than the Leviathan blossom and the Mark of Cain to conceal God. I’ll give you Jack straight away, as soon as we get topside,” They held up a finger to stop both Cas and Dean’s responses. “But you’re going to need me to bury him in the Empty with these power chains on his neck,” Hanging from their delicate fingers was a long rope of manacles inscribed with blue and gold mythical words.
He would know that voice in any port or storm. Castiel opened his eyes to see Dean standing in front of him, timidly fiddling with the hem of his Henley. He gave the hunter a small smile, which he didn’t catch because he was pretending to be fascinated by his shoes.
“I had to tell him after I read his letter to you. Oh,” Cas reached into the pocket of his coat and pulled out a thick-looking letter. “That’s your gift. Guess I ruined the surprise,” He placed it gently on the table, in the space between them. Sam peered cautiously at the envelope, where the handwriting he would know blind stated his name back to him. Not just his name, but the name he only ever let his brother call him: ‘Sammy’. “Would you like me to stay, or do you want to read the letter in private?”
A low whistle from the doorway made Castiel freeze up. He flicked the safety of the gun back on before turning to see Sam, still standing there, now adorned with a wide-eyed gaze. Cas refused to look away, staring him down hard.
“Uh, it was stupid warm in that bedroom. The dining room smelled like Gabe’s candy because he liked to sit his chocolate near the window. The beach was really nice, though. Sam insisted on going for huge hikes every morning, and you truly thought Gabe was going to kill him on Sunday morning, so you offered to go with him and Gabe guarded me while you and Sam went for your stupid jog,” He grinned. “Didn’t you trip over in the dunes? Had to ice your ankle, didn’t you?” Cas chuckled.
The synapses in Dean’s brain stopped firing all together. He couldn’t even muster up the energy to pull the note away from Castiel’s grabbing hands. He just stood there, motionless as baby Emma gurgled away happily into his chest.
“Cas,” His tongue snuck out to wet his lips, and Cas mirrored his movements slowly. Dean watched, enraptured, before he breathed out a sigh. “You’re gonna kill me with this patience, darlin’,”
“If you’d like, I can give you my personal email address, and you can reach out to me at any time as well. Please bear in mind, I am not a trained professional in the ways of counselling, but if you need someone to talk to without fear of judgement,” He scrawled on the back of the card. “You can count on me, Dean. No matter the issue, I am happy to listen to you. Even if you just want to discuss your reasoning behind why you believe Dracula was madly in love with Johnathon Harkness,” That earned him a wobbly chuckle.
“It’s native to Purgatory, blooming from soil whetted by Leviathan blood and growing in a Leviathan corpse,”
After a few hours, Dean started to stir. Sam and Cas stood beyond the Devil's Trap nervously, still apprehensive about the whole situation as another dose of human blood ran through Dean's veins.
“I know, but I got a chance to look at Mick’s thoughts when we shook hands, and he’s,” A blush rose to his cheeks. “He’s genuine about the deaths, and about everything else too,”
“Dean,” Cas still had his hand on Dean’s cheek, and he seemed to realise it at the same time Dean did. The gentle hand slowly dragged down his face and rested on the side of Dean’s neck, resting right where Dean knew Cas could feel his pulse jumping like he was hopped up on too much caffeine. “What are you thinking right now?” Dean felt his lips become drier as he opened his mouth.
‘Sorry. Uh, maybe? Crowley didn’t exactly give us a time stamp on how long this stupid interrogation thing was going to be,’ Sam’s phone made a pinging noise, and Dean frowned when Sam huffed out a laugh. ‘What?’
“Don’t discount yourself, Cas,” Sam placed his glass down on the table, eyeing the angel seriously. “Without you, I would’ve gotten into the Impala and driven myself into the drink as soon as Dean’s funeral was over,” Silence fell over the two of them, as Cas considered him, doubt coloring his expression. “What?”
Rowena? They’ll have their demon henchmen with them too, no doubt,” Cas started gently rocking Emma. Dean’s heart sank. No. Not―
“No promises, Cas. Perhaps I want to know what my favourite teacher got up to in his youth,” Dean hummed, and Cas snapped his eyes back to Dean. A tension struck up between them, but Cas couldn’t say anything back. Dean licked his lips, a nervous tick Cas had long since learned he had.
“Your Royal Highness, welcome back to my humble abode,” He pulled into a low bow, and Dean gave him a courteous nod. “Your, ahem, date has already arrived, Your Highness. I think you’ll find him traipsing through the hedge maze,” Dean caught the slight judgement in the man’s tone. A flare of anger surged through him, but he chose not to rise to the bait.
‘Cas, too,’ Dean growled, and Cas’ mouth quirked up in a half-smile. Crowley let out an exasperated sigh.
“She is no longer an Amazonian. Amara removed Lydia’s DNA and replaced it with traces of my angelic grace. She’s a Nephilim,” Cas glanced at Dean, and gently took hold of Emma’s offered hand. Her eyes glowed that gorgeous angelic blue in time with her father’s flaring grace. “She’s mine, she’s Dean’s,” Cas pressed a gentle kiss on Emma’s forehead before turning back to Sam. “Sam, meet Emma Winchester,”
Castiel attuned his sleeping habits to match Dean’s, who had been sleeping a lot more now the world wasn’t ending anymore. Instead of his three o’clock in the morning four-hour naps, he was now pacing himself with a reasonable bedtime of midnight. He didn’t rise until eight in the morning, most days, which made Castiel happy to know. So, Cas made sure he was in the kitchen when Miracle comes scampering in, Dean slow on his tail.
“Heya Cas,” Dean breathed, travel bag slung over his shoulder. Cas got a good look at him. He was wearing an old grey Metallica shirt with small rips near the bottom hem, a purple and black plaid shirt, his blue corduroy jacket and his Dad’s old leather jacket. His jeans were so washed out at the knees, Cas could see the denim becoming threadbare enough to start tearing. His boots were the same as they’d always been, old and battered but still holding together. Cas smiled until he noticed a cut on Dean’s upper lip, blood bubbling slightly.
voice. Sam only ever used that voice when he was struck with such terror or sickness that he can barely keep himself standing. Dean’s limbs ached to rush towards his fearful brother, his sickened child, but his brain was still echoing with church bell warnings. His brother thought he was
“Cas? Is that you?” Dean’s eyes were shining, and Cas could imagine his soul was reaching through his irises, shimmering sunlight. Dean was Castiel’s sunshine.
, Dean, don’t you?” Cas exhaled slowly down Dean’s neck, sending a needy shiver through his body. “Tell me,” His fist tightened in Dean’s hair, and the hunter couldn’t stop the moan slipping his lips.
“Doubt it,” Sam paused, thinking. “Although, if she’s anything like Dean…yeah, never mind, you’re right. She’d probably also stab you, too,” They shared a chuckle.
. Come on, man,” Dean shook his head. Cas stared blankly. “I’m going to use this lockdown time to educate you further in all things pop culture. Dear Lord. But come on, spill. How’d you get the cushy set-up?”
“Ya know,” He mused softly over his beer, peering at Jack’s familiar blue eyes. “You’re so much like your father, it gives me whiplash sometimes,” Jack frowned.
,” The thought barely echoed in his head before he felt the chair beneath him fade to nothing and Dean was being pressed up against the hotel door.
“Uh, Sam took Jack out to check out the new laser-tag place just outside of town,” Dean kept his gaze firmly on the ground, even as he started to blush.
“What about you, Dean?” Jack helped himself to some corn chips coated in guacamole. Dean tilted his head in askance. “What are you going to do with your freedom?” He spoke through a full mouthful of guac.
Castiel had imagined kissing Dean a million times. The first time he imagined it was after he told Dean about having fears and doubts as to what to do next. The last time he imagined it was as he admitted his happiness to the one he loved above all others. But this was different than all the imaginations combined.
‘See? As long as Feathers is around, I’m right as rain. Well,’ Dean shrugged. ‘Until we get Cas’ grace back. But we’ve gotta open Heaven back up, apparently. And kill Abaddon, and Cain, and Crowley,’ He huffed out a laugh at the sound of Crowley making blustering noises through the speakerphone. ‘Then we get Cas’ grace back, then he touches my soul, and boom, I’ll be completely human. If that’s what we want,’
“Why wouldn’t it be? It’s Dean’s favorite,” Sam remembers Dean buying that jacket, years ago now. He didn’t wear it all that often in the beginning. Dean had always been carrying around Dad’s old leather on his shoulders. But something changed, after the apocalypse. After he said no to Michael. Perhaps he decided then and there he wasn’t going to let anyone define him but himself, at least on the outside. Or perhaps Dean lost the jacket when he tried to deliver it to Bobby. Whatever the reason, Sam was glad to never see that godforsaken thing ever again.
, and Dean could already feel the sting setting into his skin. He gasped as the heat of it went straight to his cock, making it jerk. He took a moment to assess the pain level before he dared to answer Cas.
“Oi,” Sam glared at Dean. “Don’t turn this on me, and you...” He tilted his head. “You told Cas?” He gave Cas a curious glance, and Cas bowed his head as a nod. “Wow. Okay. Loyal bodyguard you’ve got there,”
“Check your phone,” Dean’s voice was devoid of emotion. Cas frowned, and pulled out his own phone. It was an emergency message, sent out by Kansas State Police, with regards from the State Government.
‘Dean...’ Cas felt Dean’s grip on Cas’ wrists loosen, and Dean flicked his black eyes to him as a warning. Cas gave him the slightest of nods, and Dean let him go completely. Still, Cas stayed.
Once Castiel was sure Jack was wrapped up snugly in his Spiderman bedspread, he made his way to his room, coat in hand. There was a burning feeling of both trepidation and exhilaration in his gut at the prospect of his relationship with Dean progressing to a newer, more intimate level. It sparked a level of curiosity from the angel as the feeling spread from his gut to an even-lower part of his body. Cas hummed as he felt his cock twitch in interest.
“No, but my friend Charlie did. She loved it, but she was really annoyed when she kept trying to find more of the writer’s works. Did you use a pseudonym or something?”
“Emma!” Dean murmured, flinching upright, wincing at the bright passing headlights. A warm sweat cascaded down his neck as he straightened up in the passenger seat. His mouth was dry as fuck, and he twisted his back just to feel his stiffened spine crack.
When Dean asked Jack, he gave Dean a sad smile, his eyes oldened by the few short years of his life. “Castiel told me he wanted to spend some time up in Heaven, to help me tear down Chuck’s old design and set it all up brand-new for when you and Sam arrive,” Jack frowned. “Which we both hope isn’t any time soon,”
“That’s it, it’s okay. I’m here, boy. Now,” He pressed against the muscles gently. “Rest your palms on the wall, so that you’re still stable, and widen your stance, shoulder-width apart for me,” Dean followed the instructions without any preamble at all, and it earned him an approving hum. “I think your clothes are probably a little too restrictive. What do you say to me at last getting rid of them?”
“You said the one thing you want was something you can’t have,” He murmured. “But sweetheart, you always had it. You
‘First time was probably when I first met you,’ Heat coursed through Dean’s veins as he remembered the shameful thoughts he had at the first sight of Cas’ wings in that barn. ‘I didn’t care if Bobby was lying there unconscious, I didn’t care if you were going to fucking destroy me then and there. All I wanted to do was fall to my knees and let you fuck my mouth until you came down my throat,’ A moan came unbidden from Dean’s throat as Cas’ nails scratched near his collarbone.
,” Dean gestured to his attire. He deliberately picked out a loose-fitting ivory dress shirt, with royal blue slacks and a matching suit jacket.
“Better?” Cas murmured. There was the smallest curve of a grin on the angel’s face. Dean couldn’t speak, too tongue-tied, too shocked, too overwhelmed to respond. “I believe that was the best course of action for you. You were about to have a massive panic attack, and I didn’t want to risk you waking Emma up,” He tilted his head, that smile still tucked in the corners of his mouth. That mouth...Dean had that mouth on
“I might go and see Mom for a bit. I’ll tell her you’re here. She’ll want to see you, I know she will,” Jack got up and before Cas knew it, he had thrown his arms around Cas’ neck, pressing his cheek into the side of Cas’ face. “It’s so good to see you again, Dad.” He spoke like the sentence was a secret, and then he was gone.
dating?” Castiel gave him a curt nod and went to let go of his charge’s face, but Dean still held on. “Then why do I feel like this?” That stopped him, and Castiel was at a loss of what to do. Discussing feelings was never something Dean was ever comfortable enough to do, least of all with Castiel, unless under dire circumstances. “Cas?” He breathed.
“Okay, okay, you can do this,” He muttered, and allowed himself to think about Castiel, no holds barred. He thought about their first meeting, how insignificant he felt in front of the first angel he had ever met. He remembered the first time he noticed his heart beating faster because of him, when Cas indirectly helped him with Chuck when they thought he was the prophet. Dean felt a smile creep on his face as he remembered how nervous Cas was when Dean dragged him into a ’den of iniquity’, as he called it.
“If you don’t mind my asking, Cas,” Dean raised an eyebrow and gestured around him. “But how’d you score this place? Unless you’re secretly a meth kingpin, there’s no way you can pull digs like this on a college professor salary,”
―isn’t dead anymore, Dean. I brought him back. I also extended an invitation for him to come here and join in the festivities, but he seemed to think,” He sighed sadly. “He seemed to think he wouldn’t be welcome here anymore,”
“Oh?” Charlie raised an eyebrow, glancing between Dean and Cas. Dean gave Cas a stern headshake, and Cas shrugged. “Whatever. So, what do you think of a movie marathon day, just you and Benny? It'd be cozy. I could organize for some beers and wine...”
“No need, I found the section. Although I have to say, I never knew the Bible could be so racy,” He hummed, bringing his lips to Cas’ ear. “
“Is everything alright?” Cas noticed Dean started rubbing the back of his neck, and it took everything in the teacher not to focus on the way the man’s muscle fought against the tightness of his shirtsleeve.
She came around eventually, armed with a broken smile and a bottle of tequila, and Sam’s lips cracked as he smiled at the sight of her. The Bunker had seemed so quiet and empty without Dean’s loud whistling and comfortable sprawling out, even with Miracle’s insistent scampering. But as soon as she stepped into the space, it was like Eileen had never left, and she brought sunlight to Sam for the first time in over three weeks.
Dean leaned up against the door, head on the wood for something to ground him, for something to tether him to his reality as descended into the depths of his feelings for Cas. The ripples of happiness, the flashes of pain, the sharpness of agony, the bitterness of loss...they all spilled out into his body, cascading down from the top of his head to the balls of his feet.
“Well, look at us. What a coupla’ saps,” He breathed out, bringing his hand to trap Cas’ tears on his fingers. The smile on Cas’ face grew wider, as he mirrored his hunter's movements.
“I need you to hear me. I know it may take a long time for you to believe me, but please just hear me,” Cas waited until Sam nodded slowly before continuing. “You are
“Well, I’ll be damned,” He spoke in a low Cajun accent, and the familiar scent wafted back over Dean as he met those soulful, frowning eyes. “If you two are back here, something real bad’s goin’ down,” Before he could continue, Dean had him wrapped up in a tight hug. He didn’t even realize he’d reached for the vampire to begin with.
to tell them that. Oh, and all of Heaven and Hell are zeroed in on hunting down Emma because she is a threat. And then, of course, there’s the small, tiny, minuscule matter of the
“I could give you something else to swear about if you’d like” Cas pressed his hips down onto Dean’s again and grinned as Dean gasped. “Would you like that?”
Sure enough, Dean felt his eyes begin to droop as Elizabeth Swann fainted into the ocean. It wasn’t his fault― the couch-bed was
“You readin’ my mind, angel?” He flashed a lazy grin at those ocean blue eyes, furrowed in confusion.
“You can do anything, Dean,” He shrugged. “This is Heaven. Your parents are somewhere that-a-way,” He gestured up the left. “Rufus and Aretha have a little bungalow up in the mountains behind us,” He tilted his head slightly. “And Ellen, Jo, and Ash have their place just beyond The Roadhouse,” Bobby sighed peacefully.
“Oh,” He chuckled, gently rubbing the towel near the corner of Emma’s mouth where she was starting to dribble. “Yes, she was doing that a little bit last night, too. Pulling things from your room into her crib. I believe she managed to turn your grey Metallica shirt into a makeshift pillow,” Cas beamed down at Emma, who slowed her drinking.
“This is how it’s going to go, Dean,” Cas tilted his head, exhaling slowly. “The only time you can use prayer as a form of communication between us is when your mouth is otherwise occupied,” He smirked. “Otherwise, you have to
touch her,” Mick stumbled back, the back of his knees hitting the chair. He collapsed into it, a look of both fear and amazement on his face. The air around them simmered, and Cas appeared in Dean’s line of vision.
“Hmm?” The sound came out in a low growl and judging from the sharp uptick in Dean’s heart rate, the hunter took it as such.
, I need you inside me,” He moaned. Cas curled his fingers just so, and a yelp slipped from Dean’s mouth. “
Cas pulled out his phone as he walked into the War Room, and opened up his recent text messages to Sam. The last one was two weeks ago, asking about Cas’ whereabouts because Dean was chomping at the bit to do something just the three of them. Cas smiled sadly at his negative response, remembering being caught up with some of his siblings in a small bout of in-fighting.  He quickly typed out a message asking for Sam to call him when he’s free, preferably away from Dean. A few moments later, Cas’ phone started vibrating with Sam’s name coming up on the Caller ID.
“You know what I wanted to do, what I probably would’ve done if Sam and Kelly weren’t there?” He cocked an eyebrow. Cas made a confused face.
. You are the most radiant, loving, beautiful person I will ever have the pleasure to call a friend,” Cas brought his hands to Dean’s shoulders, still resting his forehead gently against Dean’s.
Dean called it the Smoking Room because that’s essentially what it was for centuries until it was revealed cigars and tobacco were bad for your health. It then became a smaller dining room for just the Family to gather. The placement was extremely convenient for their chef, Garth, and his staff since it was so close to the kitchen.
“Same here. Your bed’s all made up for you, and you’re welcome to use the shampoo and conditioner left in the bathroom if you need to.” Cas gave Dean’s shoulder a warm squeeze, and Dean gave Cas’ hand a thankful squeeze back.
Also, I came across a headcanon on Twitter for Supernatural which inspired me to expand more on the nature of Dean's reaction to angel grace. The headcanon was for if Supernatural was a show on HBO instead of the CW, there was the suggestion that you could become addicted to the feeling of being healed. Not quite what's going on here, but...keep it in mind.
It was like watching a film scene change. Castiel’s switch from ‘royal bodyguard’ to ‘loyal friend’ made his shoulders relax, his smile creep out, and his walk changed from a stiff, calculated one to a lazy saunter. He sat down next to Dean and swiped some popcorn from Dean’s container.
“Alright, Sam. Drop it,” Dean made a show of dragging the chair on the ground as he got up to rinse out his cup. He let out a heavy sigh at the sink. Poetry. He huffed out a low laugh. Of course, his precious baby brother would suggest
“Emma can communicate her thoughts through touch if she wishes. I’m surprised she hasn’t tried to do that for you yet,” Cas reached for the coffee carafe, pouring the freshly-brewed coffee into two mugs. One mug had a sunbeam on it, and the other had a little bluebird on it, with a speech bubble saying, “Good morning to you!”. Dean bought the second mug for Cas as soon as he slyly mentioned coffee molecules were probably his most preferred ones to consume.
Dean’s phone rang shrilly from his pocket. Both men threw themselves back so hard, Cas knew his lower back was going to be aching tomorrow morning. Dean refused to meet Castiel’s eyes as he answered his phone.
“Cassie Robinson,” He mumbled through a mouthful of food. He felt comfortable not upholding the proper decorum Mary would expect in her presence, since the only other people Sam and Dean were having breakfast with were Gabriel and Cas. Dean felt a light kick in the side of his chair and cast a side-long glance at his bodyguard, who was frowning at him. “What? Mom’s not here, come on,”
“You’ll figure something out, Dean. You always do. Why not Castiel?” Mary’s voice was...strange when she made the suggestion. Dean’s eyes flew to Cas, and he could tell his bodyguard heard every word. “You can confidently say he wouldn’t do anything to hurt you, and you’re very comfortable with Cas,”
“So?” Sam raised a questioning eyebrow. He wasn’t wearing plaid, which was slowly becoming the norm for him. A well-worn sweater threaded with green, gold, and red wrapped around his arms like it belonged there, and Cas supposed, it probably does now. Gone were the torn shirts and blood-stained jackets for both Winchesters.
“Remember when I was angry with you, over you stealing the Colt?” He cocked his head, and Cas nodded. “I threw you up against the wall,”
“Ah, mm, ha,” Dean moaned, not being able to tear his gaze away from the watchful crowd. But the relief of slowly being filled by Cas was almost enough to make him crave being alone. Only for a moment, however, as Castiel’s grace flared out and run up between the angel’s chest and Dean’s back. The hunter could feel something like fingernails digging into his back, and slowly dragging down. Castiel was scratching down his back with his
“Of course, Your Highness.” She tapped a few things on her tablet. “So, what were you thinking as far as viable dates?”
“As the long-suffering younger brother,” Sam piped up, and Dean groaned, much to everybody’s apparent glee. “I believe I was dealt the hardest hand ever when it came to these two. Do you know how many times I kept
“In comparison to Cas, yes, Dean,” He lowered his head. “You know what? I’ll go on my own. You two clearly need to sort whatever shit it is you’ve been shoveling around each other all these years,”
wanted more. Dean felt that icy-hot limb running down his spine again, and he didn’t wait for Castiel to ask.
“I was thinking maybe guns now, and maybe sparring later? We did just eat,” He glanced down at his now-empty plate.
‘Of course,’ He spoke softly, and his eyes glowed. Dean watched the glow surrounding Cas’ feathers reach out and bury themselves into his skin. Cas’ grace fed directly into Dean’s soul, and the euphoric feeling of ecstasy flowed between them. Dean felt his own body become luminescent, dressed in Cas’ dark feathers. His orgasm was nearing, his heart racing at the speed of light to accommodate his poisoned soul interacting with such purity. ‘Dean, Dean,’ Cas breathed.
“I’ve been wanting you,” He lifted his hips slightly, and started slowly grinding himself down, tightening the maddening grip on Castiel’s heart. “Ever since you told me you loved me, ever since I apologized to you in Purgatory, ever since we nearly lost each other entirely,” Dean’s hands searched for Castiel’s palms and locked them together, using the pressure to help lift himself and drive back down with equal force. “I’ve been wanting you since you walked out on me, since you were dying and said you loved us all, since you came back from Lucifer, since you broke the mild control connection with Heaven, since―” Dean moaned as Cas started to thrust up in time with Dean’s motions.
He put the photo back, and the pile of papers balled up in and around the bin caught his eye. One of the balls had his name stretched across it, all crumpled and messy. A small voice in the back of his head told him to leave it alone, it was meant to be binned. But he never listened to that voice before, so why would he start now?
“Closer to the music. I don’t want to hide you away,” Dean tugged Benny’s hand with him as he made his way back to the massive crowd under the pergola of the estate. Dean caught Castiel’s eye, and he didn’t miss the imploring squint his bodyguard gave him. Dean shot him a wink.
Cas zeroed in on those final few words. The only information Cas managed to get out of Dean about John Winchester was he isn’t exactly a role model. There had been a few emails asking if Cas knew anything about alcoholism and whether it was a hereditary thing or just a learned trait. Heart in his throat, Cas responded.
“By the way, I listened to the playlist you put together for me,” Dean breathed into Cas’ mouth, and Cas brought his lips to Dean’s neck so he could continue talking. Loud panting came from Dean’s lips now, and Cas nipped his skin gently to encourage him to keep speaking. “Ah, thought they were all sappy love songs. Not that I didn’t appreciate them, they were beautiful, but that ‘Ruin The Friendship’ one was...”
. Dean frowned. It’d probably been before Hell, with Cassie. He sighed. That felt like a whole other lifetime ago. He was a different person then, and now Castiel was bringing back the giddy young adult who believed in love. Dean snorted. Figures he’d fall for someone with a similar-sounding name.
“I may not be an angel, anymore, Dean,” He growled. “But I still need your explicit permission before I take you,”
“I guess it doesn’t sound like a nickname to you, does it?” He poured a healthy amount of dishwashing liquid into his coffee mug, grabbing the washcloth and scrubbing the cup clean as he considered. “What about ‘sunshine’? I’ve called you that before,”
“Yes. He wrote such a lovely poem, and I want to write something in response to his words. A way to reassure him I reciprocate his feelings, but I don’t want to scare him away either. I value his friendship too much, and I don’t want to lose what Dean and I have in favour of possibly pursuing a romantic relationship with him.”
prince, he can do whatever the fuck he wants, right?” Dean crossed his arms. “What if I can find someone better than her? If I can find a better alternative, will you let me? Trust me, Mom. You
, baby, I honestly thought I’d lost the love of my life when you left me,” He dipped his tongue across the plains of his chest, pressing open-mouthed kisses over Dean’s nipples.
,” Benny reached out and dipped a strawberry into the sauce, raising an eyebrow. “Would it be beneath you for me to feed you a chocolate strawberry?” A warm feeling flooded Dean's chest, and he broke into a wide grin.
“We’re very stupid,” Cas nodded seriously. “We’re insufferable idiots who chose to torture themselves by miscommunication and failed shots in the dark, instead of doing the human thing and
“That’s okay. I can put it away if you don’t want it,” The angel sat the steaming plate of pizza slices in front of Sam, anyway.
“Shh, shh, boy. No arguments, hmm? You don’t want to have to get your punishment straight away, do you?” He squinted, feeling Dean relax as he flicked his tongue along the pad of the angel’s thumb. “Or maybe you do. Because that’s what you think you deserve, right?” Another finger popped past Dean’s lips, and Dean sought to coat both the thumb and the forefinger in saliva. “But I’m not going to reward bad behavior, Dean. What you deem as punishment at this point is something you don’t think you deserve. You despise hearing praise, and you always counter it with snarky dismissals. What if you can’t speak back, boy?” Another finger forced its way into Dean’s mouth, and the hunter was surprised and mildly alarmed at how hard he was already.
?” Dean had only ever seen Cas get truly angry a handful of times, and it had never been directed at him. Watching his friend’s reaction to that name sent a chill through his body. Cas said nothing, just glared at the letter Sam held up in question. Dean shared a silent look with Sam, who offered the letter towards Cas cautiously. Cas inhaled heavily.
The hunter shook his head, and pointedly ignored the voice by glancing at his watch, telling him it had been almost three hours since he’d seen his friends, and they had only two hours left on their Purgatory clock.
The euphoria Dean felt at the touch of grace coaxing his soul back out of his darkness made him gasp for breath. He felt his knees buckle, reaching out to cling onto Cas’ forearms. Cas’ eyes began to glow, and Dean let out a wanton moan as the grace threaded itself into the lingering humanity in his soul. Cas combed his grace into Dean’s very essence, and Dean couldn’t focus on anything else except
“Good, because you are. Mick oughta know that.” Dean stretched his neck again, before bringing his arm up to rest on the head of the front seat, so he could have his arm out without causing too much discomfort. Emma wasn’t planning on giving him his hand back, so he might as well get comfortable. Pretty soon, he started dozing again, remaining semi-conscious through images of yelling at an unrecognizable face, grabbing Castiel and kissing him soundly in front of his brother, and holding his baby girl in his arms again. He smiled, knowing he was going to get to do one of those things
The gun range was a good start at putting his plan into motion. Dean initially set them up so there was a box of space between them, and that wouldn’t do well for Cas.
The rest of Dean’s day passed quietly. He checked on Baby, making sure he had succeeded in irradicating all traces of that stupid slushie. However, he mused, he couldn’t be
“Cas?” There was a gentle knock at his study door. Cas turned in his swivel chair, elbows resting on the arms. “Um,” Dean looked nervous. “What are we going to do as far as classes go?”
Before Dean had the chance to let doubt or fear or anxiety slip in, Cas pulled Dean into his arms and they appeared under the covers of Dean’s bedsheets, Dean’s head resting gently on the angel’s now-bared chest. Cas ran his hand soothingly from Dean’s shoulder to his back, to the crown of his head.
Roots of old trees snarled around Dean’s feet as he stopped on dew-wet leaves. The midday sky above wasn’t as dark as it had been recently, and that gave Dean a glimmer of hope. It reminded him of Castiel.
“All good, Cas?” His voice wore thin in his throat. The angel turned to the hunter with cloudy eyes, a sad sort of smile half-covering his face.
“All good there, Your Highness?” Benny leaned up against the starboard bow, wind rustling his shirt, and a knowing smile on his lips. “Lost your sea legs?”
voice in the back of his mind screaming at him to give Dean the book, give him the book, give him the damn BOOK! “Don’t go looking for the novel.”
“Can I show you something if you promise you’ll hold onto it, even when we get you feeling better?” This was either going to change the trajectory of the rest of their lives together, or just for the night, but he needed to reassure Dean. He needed Dean to understand
,” Benny chuckled as Dean barreled into the softness of the bed. Benny gave Cas a raised eyebrow. “I take it that means you’ll be the one controlling the remotes, then?” Cas smiled before gesturing for Benny to make himself comfortable. Dean burrowed himself under the softness of the blanket, rolling his neck back into the large pillow. A loud resounding
“There, you happy?” He shoved his phone back into his pocket. Castiel smiled as he nodded. Dean brought his hands back to cup Castiel’s face. “Good. Because I’ve been wanting to do this
one? Perhaps the one that would help produce an heir,” Dean cocked an eyebrow as he felt his face heat up. “I understand most people have moments of curiosity now and then, especially at your age, but you’re not
“Oh, no, no, no, sir, trust me, my Hallie and baby Evan won’t be missing this car at all, they’ll be happy to see it gone. Hallie just told me this morning she’s dying to get a new vehicle,”
“Yes, she’s going to alter a lot, and I don’t know what it means,” Cas hesitated. “But perhaps Mick can provide us with the correct tools to gain more insight,” Dean scoffed. “Dean,” He chastised.
“You’ll be okay, Dean. I promise. Now, go have a shower and get dressed. I’ll be right outside,” With that, Cas marched out of the ensuite, shutting the door behind him.
‘No?’ Dean let go of Joe completely, rounding the chair so he was in Joe’s line of sight. ‘Sorry, bucko. Them’s the brakes. You’ve got three choices. One,’ He tilted his head to the side, biting his lip in relish before continuing. ‘We drain the blood from you forcefully, and you call Abaddon. Two, you offer up what you know willingly because I don’t fucking believe you’re
his feelings about Castiel, and the angel was focused entirely on Emma. Which, fair enough, she’s a Nephilim now, Dean supposes. Castiel fixes his gaze sharply back on Dean.
“Dean, as a teacher, we have a Duty of Care for our students. We have a level of authority over these students, even if they’re fully-grown adults and are perfectly capable of making their own decisions. There are moral issues surrounding teacher-student relationships, you know this,”
“I’m glad you think so,” The gentle rumble of a familiar voice dripped into his ears and straight to his soul. Castiel must’ve felt Dean tense up because he traced soothing patterns into the hunter’s back. “You’re okay, Dean. You’re safe, it’s just me, just your Cas,” He murmured continuously, and Dean took in a deep breath.
Silence circled the two, and Castiel could feel Sam’s eyes on him, watching as his forgetful brother pressed another worshipful kiss to his palm. A whisper of prayer made his way to him, in Sam’s voice. Castiel wasn’t sure if he was meant to hear it. “
“Hey,” Dean pulled Cas’ focus back to him. “Whatever happens, we’ll get through it together,” He stroked his cheek, a small smile on his face. “We always do.”
‘You think if he knew, he would’ve gotten rid of it. But we should seek him out anyway,’ He considered. ‘I did promise him I’d kill him,’
, move on, move on. Dean swayed again on the spot as he wrenched his heart out from the cage he built. He wandered slowly towards the mouth of the cave, not willing to leave the safety of it just yet.
“Oh,” Cas blinked, registering what Dean meant. Their stomachs were sticky with come, and he was still inside the hunter. He pulled himself out, chuckling at Dean’s uncomfortable wince. “How about we go wash up? Shower together?”
‘When you came to me in that dream, the first one, I wanted you to hold me up against the kitchen wall by the back of my neck and fuck me until you covered me in your come,’ Dean’s fingers tripped over the last few buttons of Cas’ dress shirt, and he growled lowly in frustration before just ripping the fabric open. Plastic buttons scattered all over the floor, and he met the angel’s gaze, expecting to be reprimanded. But Castiel just smiled, so Dean continued pulling off Cas’ shirt along with his jacket and trench coat. He brought his hands to the angel’s belt before he continued. ‘When you silenced me in that room in Van Nuys, I wanted you to suck me off until I melted into the ground. When you beat the holy hell out of me in that alleyway, I wanted you to drive your cock into me until I was crying for mercy,’ With Cas’ pants and underwear on the floor, they were both standing in front of each other, completely naked. Dean licked his lips at the sight of Cas’ purpling cock, and Cas gripped Dean’s hips tightly. The angel fell into the bed behind him, and he pulled Dean on top of him. The hunter’s knees bracketed Castiel’s hips, and he felt Cas’ fingers flow from his hips to grip his ass tightly, eliciting another unbidden moan from Dean’s lips, before skirting fingers up and down his crack. There was a pause in the angel’s gaze, a question, and Dean nodded. Cas’ fingers were already lubricated, and Dean felt his own body give easily to the intrusion. He was distracted by the overwhelming feeling of three of Cas’ fingers stretching his hole before he remembered what he was supposed to be saying.
“Terribly sorry, Mother. I promise it won’t happen again,” He scooped the last of his food into his mouth as the lie fell from his lips. Nobody in the room honestly believed him, but also, nobody jumped to correct him either. Mary just rolled her eyes, and Sam snorted softly. "Do we know how much we raised at the masquerade, by the way?”
Static hit the car’s radio, and Kansas started playing again. The same song. Dean blinked, frowning at the car. Is it...a tape? He doesn’t recall ever having a single Kansas tape in the car in his entire life, let alone one that has only one song on it. Dean
of emotionally damaging beliefs in a handful of sentences. It was because of you I was able to deny Chuck his last chance to see ‘Dean Winchester, the ultimate killer’ because you painted me golden in love,” The last word came out nearly garbled. He pressed his hands together in prayer and shut his eyes tightly.
“Just as long as they’re at least a Lord or Lady, I don’t mind,” She smiled, and Dean pointedly ignored the quiet voice in the back of his mind. It was the same voice he heard in the middle of the night when nobody was around. That voice tells him he was crushing on his bodyguard. The bodyguard who is
Time flows differently in Purgatory, Dean knows that. But didn’t Cas say he and Benny were only going to be a few minutes? Where were they? Panic started to grip his lungs, and he scrambled onto his feet. As he swayed on the spot, another memory swam to the surface.
it’s Benny’s, but honestly, he couldn’t tell...perhaps he was dreaming now, because he could faintly hear Captain Jack Sparrow asking why the rum was always gone, and there’s
,” A chill ran up his spine, that same icy hot thrill of Cas’ grace stroking up his back and over his shoulders. He felt a small suction latch onto the side of his neck and moaned as he felt the bruise forced up into his skin.
“I...” Dean’s voice crumbled, and he fiddled with the strap of his bag slung around his shoulder. “I was wondering if you knew the best place to contact if, ah, umm...” Castiel couldn’t bear to see the usually confident man look so fragile. He opened up his desk drawer and pulled out the business card for the school counsellor.
A loud bounding knock echoed through the rooms and corridors of the Bunker. Without a second thought, everybody in the kitchen made a hasty retreat towards the War Room, where Sam and Dean pulled out their trusted sawed-off shotguns. Cas pulled out his angel blade, and Eileen armed herself with one of the many guns stashed away in the Bunker. Another loud boom crashed against the Bunker’s door, and the four of them watched in horror as the heavy metal door swung open to reveal…
“You know he wouldn’t have a chance to even start swinging back, Dean,” The smile on Cas’ face was minute, but Dean welcomed it like a warm hug. “I’m faster than he is,”
his older brother right now, not a defensive father shielding his child from her uncle. Castiel, bless him, pulled Emma from Dean’s arms just as his body reanimated. Suddenly, his arms were free and they went swinging around his crumbling brother. His first child.
I kill the motherfucker. How’s that sound?’ He gave Cas a playful grin. ‘The Mark needs satiating somehow unless you’re willing,’ He ran his fingers up Cas’ sternum, nails digging in.
“Why not a job here at Sandover?” Dean was fascinated by the smiling lips mere inches away from his. Castiel drew in a deep drag of his cigarette, before moving to breathe out the way of Dean. A snare of disappointment caught in his chest, and the older man huffed a private laugh.
“Well, what’s the plan for teaching? I vaguely remember getting an email asking to be prepared for Zoom links to attend lectures and classes, but, ah,” He averted his gaze. “Where would be the most appropriate place for me to set up my laptop?” Cas glanced down to see Dean’s silver laptop in his arms, that looked almost as old as Dean himself was.
was under Rowena’s tutelage as a witch. Eileen made a quip about fighting the Queen of Hell for her boyfriend, and Sam had blushed so furiously, Eileen couldn’t stop crying from her laughter.
“His Royal Highness, Prince Dean Winchester!” Arthur gave the crowd one final wide smile before stepping to the side, giving Dean a bow. Dean let out a deep breath, shooting Cas one last nervous glance. Cas gave him a small nod, and Dean put on his crowd-pleasing smile.
“Not shot, surely. Publicly humiliated, perhaps, or maybe lashings,” He huffed a laugh at the eye-roll he was rewarded from Cas and the scoff from Charlie. Benny glanced nervously between the three of them, and Dean gave him a reassuring squeeze of his hand. “I’m kidding, of course. Such practices haven’t been deemed lawful for decades at least. Well, the humiliation one is still technically legal, just...done differently,” The prince grinned at Benny’s relaxing expression before taking a deep drink of his wine.
“Language, Dean,” Cas said idly as he began to roll up his shirt sleeves. Dean glared daggers at the angel. “So, are you going to answer me, or are you going to find another distraction to avoid confronting your feelings?” Dean sputtered nonsensical words at him, still residing in the bitchiness of Cas making him bite his tongue and then chiding him for his language. Cas eyed him lazily. “Do you want to know my thoughts and feelings on the matter?” The hunter shot another scathing glare towards the angel, who took the look as an affirmative answer. “I believe you’ve been nurturing these feelings and emotions about me for quite some time, but you haven’t allowed yourself a moment to properly process them for two reasons,” He held up two fingers to demonstrate before counting off on them.
'Castiel, you can't honestly tell me you haven't thought about it,' He cocked an eyebrow. 'Not once? Not even when you had me on my knees, literally at your mercy? Or when I openly invited you to blow me? What about when I told you I need you?' He smirked as Cas' lower lip trembled slightly. 'Though, that's the sad thing about it, angel. The Dean who needed you is dead. That Dean, the Dean you so desperately pin your salvation to, the Dean you were so willing to follow through the darkness for, the Dean you let yourself die for...he's gone," he paused. 'That Dean was so hopelessly in love with you, Castiel, it makes me sick even thinking about it.'
,” He managed to wheeze out before another swarm of water filled his throat, and his lungs started to burn. Chuck, wearing Jack’s face, smiled. His eyes glowed white-hot.
“Well, I can’t fault you for being so excited to meet me you shattered windows, I’m pretty great,” He let out a laugh, looking back at Emma. She still held firm to Dean’s finger, and it didn’t look like she wanted to let go any time soon. “We’re almost home, baby,” He tried to wiggle his finger out of her grip, but she was steadfast. “You’re not going to let me go until we get home, aren’t you?” He let out a laugh as she shook her head minutely. “God, you’re so stubborn,”
. Dean pulled away from Cas, still keeping his arms firmly around his angel, to give his brother a shit-eating grin. Both Sam and Eileen were staring at him with raised eyebrows, but interestingly, neither one looked particularly surprised.
“Very much so,” Cas looked at the book Dean was reading and frowned to see it wasn’t the sonnet book he had given him earlier. It was the King James Version of the Bible, instead. “Ah, you don’t suppose you could tell me...”
The hunter stirred from his mindless driving. He had no idea where he was going, he just wanted to put as much space between himself and that damned graveyard as possible. Dean flicked his gaze over to the patient angel sitting shotgun in his car. As always, his breath gets caught at the sight of passing headlights catching in his muted azure eyes. They were the kind of blue you could pass over from afar, but up close, they swept you away until you were drowning in his gaze.
, Dean,” Cas’ voice came out in a hushed tone, and Dean’s chest trembled as he drew in a slow, shaky breath. “That’s it, you’re doing so well, sweetheart. Keep going. You were thinking of me, were you? Is this the first time you’ve thought of me since we last parted?” There was a flicker of emotion beneath the calm and controlled exterior Cas presented in his voice. If Dean didn’t know Cas as well as he did, he probably wouldn’t have caught it. But he knows Castiel
“You’re also clearly a Winchester,” Dean laughed as he pulled Jack in for a big hug. Jack’s whole face lit up at the feeling of Dean’s arms around him. When the older hunter broke apart from him, he levelled his gaze with Jack. “We’re experts at rule-breaking,” He winked, and Jack laughed. Everybody pulled Jack into their own hugs, Cas reaching for his son last. The god was grinning up as Cas’ hand finally left the top of Jack’s head before speaking again.
“Say it,” Cas pleaded, wrapping his hand around Dean’s weeping dick, pumping hard and fast. “Tell me you’re mine, say my name, love, please,”
“Nothing, don’t worry about it. I’ll just...read this another time, I guess,” Dean huffed out a laugh. “Guy’s got a lot of nerve, but I dunno...there’s something commending about his honesty. Anyway. Night, Cas.”
it out. The book would’ve found me. You get me?” Dean raised an eyebrow, and Cas schooled his features into a sober expression.
“Honestly, I don’t know much. I wasn’t around for very long after you called me. When we’d seen the darkness in the sky disappear, Sam and I went straight home. As soon as we had walked into the Bunker...
That was all Dean could say. He didn’t even manage a manly clearing of the throat or even a light-hearted quip. Sam’s eyebrows shot up so high, Dean thought they’d gotten lost in his mop of a mane.
was satiating both the spell and his desire. He wanted to be completely consumed by Castiel, and he knew he thought that in a prayer, because Castiel let a soft moan slip, the only sign this was affecting the angel more than he was probably letting on. Dean glanced down towards Castiel’s slacks and thrilled to see the tenting in the front of his pants. Cas chuckled darkly, and Dean shot his gaze back up towards the angel’s face.
“You got it.” Dean beamed, and Castiel nodded in agreeance. With that, Sam left, and it was just the two of them.
“Okay,” Cas ran his right hand on the warmth of Dean’s right ass cheek. “You deserve my affection,” The hit was a little harder than the first, and Dean gasped out in surprise. He became aware his hands were no longer resting up against a wall but suspended in the air by Cas’
“I’ll be honest, it’s already been draining. Already, suitors have been sending me flowers and presents. Although,” Dean smirked. “I have to admit, I
. All his life, he had spent every minute worrying about the next big bad, the next explosion, the next impending war. And now... “Honestly, bud, I don’t have a clue what I’m going to do with myself now. I suppose I could keep the Bunker up and running, for those who want the knowledge, and I could keep on trucking through monster-of-the-week cases, ya know,” He shrugged.
This was the second instance of Castiel breaking his carefully-constructed control. At least with the emails, there was still an air of formality between them. Dean always started his emails with a need for assistance, even if it was helping on a tiny little piece of writing. But here? All pretences could be dropped. This was dangerous.
“That’s okay, Jack. Sometimes things are better left unspoken about,” Cas gave him a small smile. “Dean never talks about his nightmares, either.” Jack tilted his head at that.
seen him, yeah?” Cas nodded as he took a sip of his coffee. Dean gave his thigh a warm squeeze as the angel smiled at Sam.
for me, Dean. You deserve this, I know you do. You’ve been working so hard to achieve so much, and I am so
“Your Highness?” Cas once again pulled Dean out of his head, and Dean rubbed his forehead in frustration.
“Of course I do,” Sam spoke ferociously, and Cas came around with Emma, both tilting their heads curiously as Sam watched Dean gazing at her. “God, she looks so much like you, Dean,”
“Yeah, that’d work! And I’ll drop hints about cleaning out the car. Or I could make a mess in the car and piss Dean off enough to make him clean it,” Sam let out a noise that sounded close to an evil laugh. “I’ve been wanting to get him back for putting itching powder on my comb a few weeks back.”
. “Cas, if you don’t st―” He couldn’t continue, however, because Cas chose that moment to groan with his lips pressed to the base of Dean’s cock. He was starting to think he could
‘You mentioned Alistair. You...’ Cas paused, squinting at Dean. ‘You talked about being back in Hell,’
“Easy enough to do, brother. I’m the better-looking one,” There was no edge to his voice. He was just
The entire space was drenched in the sorbet sunset light, and drops of dew from the earlier rainfall had made the roof glisten like starlight. It seems a beautiful place for a beloved friendship to die.
unlocked? Why, Dean could come waltzing right on in. Cas let out a heavy breath as his white shirt joined the chaos on his bedroom floor. He danced his hands around his belt before he imagined Dean’s fingers pulling him to halt. Warm hands pressing gently into his skin, with a rumbling whisper accompanying them.
In his first year of teaching, he became particularly fond of the students from his very first class.
“You’re just lucky I was going to give her a clean-out tonight, you little shit,” Dean still glared, but the heat of it dissipated with his words. “Go on, get,” Sam scrambled out of the car and disappeared, not before giving Cas a knowing smirk.
. Dean choked on his breath as he wrenched his hands from his face. He scrambled to his feet and spun around. There he was, the same as he always had been. Windswept hair, backwards tie, trench coat dirtied by who knows what. Eyes full of stars. Dean’s tears cascaded yet again, but he was laughing. Trembling. Shaking. Cas pulled him in, and Dean collapsed. “I heard you. Do you mean it?”
.” Jack walked over to Sam, taking hold of his wrist and gently guided Sam out the door. Dean gave Jack a small smile, and he nodded before they disappeared out of the room. Dean snapped his gaze back to Cas.
“You already are,” Cas caressed his hand over Dean’s cheek, and the anger Dean had bubbling in his chest simmered at the mere touch of the angel’s fingers. The hunter turned to Cas with the smallest of smiles.
the hunter feels the same way, he couldn’t help feeling nervous to find out how he took the playlist. Was he going to listen to the songs straight away, or leave it until later? He flushed imagining Dean’s reaction to the ‘Ruin The Friendship’ song. It was the only one that could be a little bit too far outside Dean’s comfort zone. The insinuation behind it also made his stomach turn nervously. He doubted himself so many times over that song, but he figured, especially since last night, it was either going to hit the mark or miss it entirely. He can roll with the punches either way. Cas heard footfalls on the steps towards the kitchen and straightened his back as he finished drying the skillet he used to cook Dean’s breakfast.
“Thank you,” Cas spoke quietly, and Dean remembered a night of drunken confessions shared between them. It was four years ago now, just after Dean’s twenty-first birthday. Cas had only been Dean’s bodyguard for a few months, but Dean managed to get under his skin enough to coax him to share a bottle of whiskey. Together, they shared secrets they refuse to tell anybody else. Cas revealed he was banished from his family’s home because of his sexuality. Dean heaved out his fear of becoming just like his abusive father, cold and unloving towards the ones who love him. Cas had rested a comforting hand on his shoulder, telling him ‘You are nothing like John, Dean. You’re kind, compassionate, and fiercely loyal. You’re going to be a great King one day.’ There was a heavy pause, and Dean had ignored the stinging tears in his eyes. It was also the night Dean told him he had struggled with his sexuality for a time, but since his father’s death, he started coming to terms with having feelings for both men and women. He hadn’t told anyone else that secret except for Sam. Cas guarded it with his life, just like the rest of Dean.
“What do you mean?” Cas frowned. He remembered being very frustrated with Dean when he wanted to go find Michael to say yes. Flashes of that dark alley-way still haunt his memories. Not his proudest moment, for sure, but he
“Let me touch you, Castiel. Let me touch you and then I want you to fuck my face,” He felt his face burn as the words dripped out.
Instead of feeling rejected, Dean found himself smiling harder than Charlie was when she received a letter the next day from Lady Cassandra, requesting her presence at the Lady's lakeside manor for some afternoon tea. At least something was going well from all of this courting, and Charlie deserved this happiness. Her last relationship had ended dramatically, with Stevie up and ghosting her after a few short months together. Dean had to be the one to hold her consolingly as she sobbed her way through multiple Ben and Jerry’s ice creams and multiple re-watches of
“It’s also that royal-falling-for-his-protector trope, Dean,” Sam mumbled, and Dean thwacked him across the head lightly.
?” The word came out broken and mangled. He could feel his lungs start to absorb more oxygen almost without him knowing, and his blood pulling to a slow walking pace in his veins. “Oh.” He breathed out, noting a small trace of spice on his breath as he did. What was that, cinnamon? He looked back down at the now-beaming child in his arms. “Thank you, honey,” Her eyes sparkled in recognition as she tilted her head ever so slightly.
“Thanks for coming so quickly, buddy,” He managed to get out before he was pulled into a crushing hug. “Oh, okay, hi,” He murmured into the tuft of black hair.
Cas rested his hand gently on Dean’s shoulder before he swung the doors open. Anger seeped out of Dean’s body with every heavy breath he exhaled, but he refused to give the angel thanks. He needed blood on his hands. And he needed it now.
“Good morning,” Sam smiled before making his way to the fridge and pulling out his pre-made green-looking smoothie. He took a swig of the drink before glancing between the two at the table. “What are your plans for today?” Cas took a final drink of his coffee, so Dean answered.
?” Cas breathed as he turned his gaze back to Dean, still swathed in golden light. Dean smiled at Cas, and Castiel knew all the holy hosts of heaven could never compare to the love he had for the man in front of him. “You’re here?”
“Oh, by the way,” He called over his shoulder. “You should definitely go and check on that book. Just saying.” Then he was gone. Cas waited until he got control of the shaking in his hands before doing as Dean suggested.
A single tear crept from his eye as he slowly bricked his feelings away again. Before he could do much more, there was a knock at the door.
Standing in front of Cas was the ever-radiant and ever-fiery redhead Dean affectionately saw as his sister. Charlie Bradbury looked just as energised as he remembered, and she was already sporting heavy tear-tracks on her blotchy red cheeks.
Mom has, and if you’re anything like me, you’ve found something as well. Well, this one is mine. My burden, my problem, my issue, and I know there’s no logic behind it, there’s no sense in thinking
“Yeah, you got it, Cas,” He whispered into the shell of Cas’ ear. A shiver came unbidden from the top of Cas’ spine and ran the whole way down and into Cas’ core. If Dean noticed, he didn’t say anything. “Now, I want you to take a slow breath in, and on the release, just
Not quite sure how long this one is going to end up being, but at least now I have a bit more of a plan for it.
‘Heya dickwad, guess what?’ Dean shrugged, fighting down his seething anger. ‘They’re probably just trying to find
The older Sam got, the more he learned the twisting his father had done to Dean’s psyche was beyond damaging. His own as well, but it was because of that gnarled dependency Sam did not care for his troubles. If Dean wasn’t okay, Sam wasn’t okay. It was that simple, and that complicated. During his time away from his father and his iron-clad hold over Sam’s identity, the younger Winchester had the time to not only experience a normal life but also recognize the poison John had him swallowing as a child. John had put all the responsibility on Dean, took away Dean’s chance at a happy and normal childhood, and Sam never truly understood
“My sweet, sweet boy,” He spoke as he undid the tie around Dean’s neck, fluidly bringing the dark material up to cover Dean’s eyes. His sight was swallowed up by darkness, and he relaxed as he shut his eyes, feeling the tie knotted smoothly around his head. “We’re going to do another thing you’d only ever dreamed of,” He pressed a gentle kiss to the back of Dean’s neck. “Let’s indulge your little exhibitionist kink, shall we?”
“Not in the slightest, Castiel. I’m happy for you, man.” Sam let out a giddy sigh. “Damn, Bobby owes me
“And with that, your happiness is revealed,” A cold, cynical voice came from the shadows. “How touching.”
the moves I’m supposed to make, but I’m not yet all familiar with how to get my body to respond to the decisions I make,” He felt a flush rising in his face at the shameful thought. Dean considered it, before nodding.
“Because Nephilim are forbidden, since their power is enough to crumble entire worlds,” Cas sighed, and Emma reached out with both arms for the angel. Dean made sure the hand-off between them went smoothly, and Emma cooed almost gleefully as she nuzzled her face into Castiel’s neck. “Ordinarily, a Nephilim is created between an angel who has taken a male vessel and a female human. These instances were usually never with the human under full consent, so the backstory is a little...complex,” Emma started trying to blow bubbles into the air, all the while paying close attention to the deep gravel of Cas’ voice. A loud cacophony of tinny guitar riffs echoed in the quiet, and Cas winced. Surprisingly, Emma didn’t even flinch at the loud noise. “Could you possibly get that, Dean? I think it’s your brother. I sort of up and left him in a hurry when you called,”
Dean drew in a deep breath, nodding into the angel’s palms. He still doesn’t feel like he deserves the gesture, more familiar with the brash sting of a slap than the tender touch of comfort. But he figures he might just have to get used to it.
“Hmm?” Dean grabbed his shot glass and downed the burning alcohol to distract himself. He forgot how
’ were probably going to be burned into Dean’s retinas for the rest of time. “And Heaven will want to hunt her down, and me as well,”
And just like that, the gaping hole in his heart left there by a half-absent father and the false idol of his mother was covered. Not filled but covered for the moment. God, he wanted it to be filled to the brim until he was overflowing. Dean let out a slow breath, registering his child matching her tiny breaths to his lung capacity. Take my air, he thought. Take the lungs from me so you can breathe all the more.
‘So, since you know our names, and our reputations, surely you wouldn’t be stupid enough to withhold information from us, right? This is your one chance, and I’m doing this out of the goodness of my heart,’ Dean chuckled. ‘What’s left of it, anyway,’ He approached the demon with easy confidence. ‘Tell us your name first, and then we’ll get to the good stuff, I promise,’ Dean crossed the devil’s trap, and brought his face close. ‘You can whisper it to me if you like,’ He winked. The demon’s eyes flicked black, and he let out a deep guttural growl. Dean rolled his eyes, and swing his right fist into the side of the demon’s face. There was a satisfying crack, and a small amount of blood flew from the victim’s lips. Dean flicked his own eyes black as the demon brought his angry gaze back to him. ‘I can do that too, bitch boy. You’re not special.’ Dean brought his hand to the demon’s throat, and he let his angry growl echo through the otherwise silent room. He held his snarled lips in place until the demon dropped his glare.
“There’s a difference between knowing everything up here,” He tapped the side of his head. “And actually putting it into practice in a new, fully-human body,”
? “How about this? Since you have an issue with commitment, you don’t have to say you want me to stay long-term. You just have to say you want me to stay tonight. Just for tonight, okay?” He tilted his head, and Dean whimpered at the gentle touch once again running over his cheeks, the side of his neck, his shoulders, his chest. “I’m yours, completely. I can stay for tonight, and you can be comforted in the knowledge for as long as we both survive, I will never stray and you will never have to share me. Do you want to share me with others?” The words came out in a curl, like Cas knew the answer before the question left his tongue.
“That’s just...” Cas knew he was being baited, so he took a deep breath and tried again. “You’re tired, and you should go to sleep before you say something you’ll regret. Goodnight, Balthazar.”
Waking up alone had become a habit for Dean. He was used to finding himself clinging to a pillow in a slightly seedy motel room, or even from the comfort of his bed in the Bunker. He was happy he had a home to go to, but for the longest time, those fleeting moments when he wakes up were the most emotionally painful ones to go through.
Heat flooded Dean’s veins, and he let out a low scoff. No words could fall from his lips, however, and his face turned the color of the sunset sky outside the car.
, Dean thought as he put his dishes away. He was deliberately making Dean feel emotions he hadn’t felt in...well, if he thought about it,
“It’s no sweat. Still doesn’t limit you at all. Just gotta find you a guy. Technically, if you wanted to, you wouldn’t even need anybody else. You’d crush the ‘single parent’ role, no dramas at all. Plus, I love kids. Always happy to help out if you ever needed it,”
“Time flows differently in Heaven,” He tried to keep his voice nonchalant, but he could feel his grace fluttering at the thought of returning to Heaven, back to
“I beg to differ,” Cas’ voice shook slightly as he spoke lowly. “Her smile is almost the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen, so it has to be your smile,”
“Not to sound like a grumpy old man, but I had to watch these two idjits dance around each-other from the moment they met until I died, and it was tiring,” Bobby’s eyes were still sparkling, and he chuckled at Dean’s wide eyes.
“Jack...” Dean couldn’t bring himself to hide his broken voice. “Can...is he...do you know if he’s...?” The boy gave the hunter a kind smile, reaching up and squeezing his shoulder. The same one Cas left his mark on, all those years ago and just yesterday.
It took everything to convince Dean to try to fall asleep on the first night back in the Bunker. Every time he closed his eyes, he would jolt awake at the memory of Emma dying in front of him. He soothed himself by getting up out of his bed and standing in the doorway of the room across from his, where Emma was sleeping soundly in her crib. Castiel was by her side, reading some old tome from the Men of Letter’s library.
“You’re taking back control of your life, Sam, and you’re managing your trauma through magic and helping people,” Cas smiled. “That’s the most commendable and admirable way to be, and I hope you know how proud I am of you,”
do you think I am, a pet? Am I not on your side?’ Crowley’s gruff voice cut through, and Dean rolled his eyes, letting go of Cas before turning to the phone.
“So eager for me, aren’t you, boy?” He tilted Dean’s head up so the hunter’s burning green eyes met the angel’s blue ones. Castiel didn’t seem interested in a response, more enamored by the slight parting of Dean’s lips. He traced his thumb along the bottom lip, exhaling slowly through his nose. “You’re a vision. I’m going to prove that to you. By the end of the night, you’re going to understand just how beautiful you truly are, Winchester. Do you think you can handle that, boy?” Cas paused in the tracing of Dean’s lips, and the hunter understood the need for an answer. He couldn’t help the denial from creeping out of his lips.
“Take me, take me, take me,” Dean panted out, hands animating and wrapping around Castiel’s throat to crush their lips together. The taste of Dean was intoxicating, and it was there Cas could drink it in. The violence, the lust, the hate, the love...they all swirled together from Dean’s soul into a delicious cocktail for Cas to consume at his leisure.
“Sammy, who’s this?” Dean gestured to Cas. The question ricocheted through Cas’ body like he’d been pierced by an angel blade. Everything turned icy blue, and the only thing Castiel could see was his best friend, his charge, his
? His eyes flew open to find a bouquet of probably seventy roses dressed in a glass vase by his chaise lounge.
‘What damage?’ He frowned. ‘To our friendship?’ Cas nodded, and Dean shook his head slowly. ‘If you honestly think I would let
“Cas, please. I,” He choked on his own nerves, so he swallowed and tried again. Castiel stared patiently at him. “I
“That sounds wonderful, Dean, I’m so proud of you for achieving so much with your new book series,” He spoke like the compliment was the spare change in his pocket. But to Dean, it tasted of sweet ambrosia. “How was the convention? Was it everything you hoped it would be?”
tend to lock eyes for way too long. Sometimes makes me uncomfortable, but that’s not the issue. The issue is, you want to...figure out how to tell Dean you found his poem?”
“Dean?” He heard Cas’ sleep-rough voice behind him, still, the prince sobbed as he continued to vomit. His mouth was both dry and wet, and it was so upsetting. His head was pounding, and his hands shook as he grasped the side of the bowl. Gentle hands took his shoulders and rubbed soothing circles into his back. As the last of the bile dripped out of his mouth, Dean sighed and pressed his head to the cold part of the bowl.
“Keep...keep going,” He tried to move his hips, to grind down onto Cas’ finger. Dean’s face was completely blissed out. “An―another, please.
“Well, uh,” He exhaled. “He tormented her, quite honestly. She came running to Anna, and Alistair followed her. I, uh...”
“He loves you too, Cas. You have to know that,” Sam’s voice was stronger than it has been since…well, since. He wanted to cling to it, so he indulged himself. “I had never seen him more alive than when he’s with you. The way he acts,” He stopped himself, taking a short breath. “
“She’s been talking to me ever since she woke up, and I’ve been answering her. She knows more than she’s able to let on, you know? Her speech switches between Enochian and English, but that little trill you might’ve heard, that was her true voice,” He smiled. “So you could hear that?”
“Of course,” Dean nodded. “You do that for all my correspondence. Why’s it different this time around?” Cas opened his mouth to say, but something got caught in his throat, so he dropped his head down in a small bow. “Suppose I’ll find out soon enough. I’ll take these to bed with me. You’re welcome to join me,” Dean’s heart raced from his chest to his tongue, dancing across it in a nervous foxtrot. He swallowed it down. “In my room, I mean. We can share a bottle of...I think Charlie sent me a few bottles of rosé, that brand you like, and read through what these sappy idiots are saying to try and win me over,” He flashed Cas a goofy grin, and Cas gave him a tired smile.
“Shut up, Crowley,” The demon growled. “Lucifer is listening. He will find me, and he will save me,”
Cas barely felt his blade slip out of his hand. He didn't hear Sam speaking his name. He couldn't fathom the tall Winchester's hand clamping on his shoulder. All he could see was Dean's dead eyes as he admitted what Castiel had always hoped for. A swell of emotion cascaded across Cas' entire being, and he hated it. He hated the feeling. He hated this monster in front of him for taking away Dean. His Dean. Tears rolled down his face, hot and heavy, as Cas processed his thoughts. Meanwhile, the empty shell of the man he loved let out a hollow laugh.
.” The angel peered again at Emma, his frown softening into a warm smile. “I see it now. My grace is there, nestled away under all that golden light,”
“Feel that, boy?” Cas spoke slowly, his breathing escalating ever so slightly as Dean suctioned his cheeks in tightly. “Feel my grace running up and down your back?” Dean widened his eyes as realization sunk in. “I’d always imagined our first time would be slow, and I could take as long as I’d like pulling you open with my fingers and with lubricant, but we don’t have that kind of time. Not with the―” Dean glanced up and Castiel bit his lip as he took in the sight in front of him. “Not with the way you’re sucking my cock so well. You’re doing so well, aren’t you, Dean?” He tightened his grip in Dean’s hair, making the hunter moan. Dean smirked, as much as he could, as he realised the moan would’ve caused vibrations around Cas’ cock. The angel inhaled heavily before continuing. “I’m going to open you up with my grace, and I’m going to restrict your movement before I fuck you until I come. But,” He chuckled breathlessly. “
“Good morning.” He spoke into Miracle’s fur, feeling his tail hit him in the chest. Once Miracle was sure he’d licked every inch of Dean’s face, he squirmed out of Dean’s arms and wandered into Cas’ arms, giving him the same number of kisses to his face. Cas held Miracle like a baby, giving him belly scratches.
Castiel sighed as he picked up his favorite mug from its’ prized spot on the kitchen counter. Dean always liked leaving both their mugs there, right next to the French press they got as a housewarming gift from his mother.
“Well,” To Dean’s surprise, Castiel’s cheeks colored. “That depends entirely on you, love,” Dean jolted so harshly, some drops of whiskey splashed onto his shirt cuffs. “Dean?” The man tilted his head.
‘Dean Winchester?’ The demon tried to school his features to look uncaring, but his cards were already laid on the table. ‘So, that means this is the famous
“Away from us,” Cas continued as if The Empty hadn’t spoken, but the twitch in his eyebrow told Dean how much the comment stung. “I tried to trade him for me, but they decided to wait until they cash in,”
his feelings were with his grace as a buffer. When he was human the first time, he was dealing with so much pain and agony of just living, he didn’t have the mental capacity to pay attention to the gravity of the love weighing in his body.
“I didn’t ask you what your dad thinks you should do, did I?” He stated simply, pulling in another slow drag. Dean sent a heated glare towards him but simmered down seeing the gentle gaze aimed back at him. “So, a writer? What type of style, hmm? Fiction? Script? Biography?”
“Thank you, Your Majesty, for graciously inviting me into your home,” Benny reflected her smile, and Dean was struck by how
, Cas thought. But Dean just gently tapped the inside of Cas’ wrists. Even that small bit of contact sent sparks whistling through his veins. He needed

about using such a holy form of communication for what they’re doing, but, fuck, if it doesn’t make Dean’s blood blossom in his skin.
“Now, back to my suggestion,” Cas dragged his thumbs along the apples of Dean’s cheeks, before bringing his hands down his neck and resting just above his collarbones, where Dean had no doubt in his mind Cas could
“You’ve made us watch so many movies recently, I think Netflix believes you’re a robot trying to boost their sales,” Sam shot Dean a scathing glare from the tomes he was pouring over. “Why don’t you get out and go
“Not at all. Good enough to eat,” Benny’s upper lip quivered in a slight snarl as he smiled, and Dean beamed. Oh yeah, his ego will be well-fed this week.  Charlie made a quiet coughing noise from behind Dean, and Benny turned a more polite smile towards Dean’s entourage. “Ah, Miss Bradbury, Mr Novak, welcome welcome. My apologies,” He held out his hand towards Charlie, who returned his handshake gently with a smile. Instead of offering a hand to Cas, he gave a respectful nod, which Cas returned, tight-lipped. Charlie glanced knowingly between Dean and Benny but said nothing. “So, Your Highness, how about we begin the tour of the docks? We’ll come through the manor to do so,” He offered his hand to Dean and smiled as the prince took his warm hand.
“It’s going so well! I get to see Mom as much as I want, and Dean and I have gone to see everybody else a few times now too. Mary was so happy to see us,” Jack paused, glancing hesitantly at Dean. “Well, not ‘happy’ because she was really sad to see Dean up here so soon,”
‘Fine.’ Sam let go of Dean’s wrist and watched his brother delicately press the End Call button. The silence between all three of them nearly smothered him, so Sam let out a deep breath. ‘So...’
Dean’s feet hit the ground first, and his knees gave way to the concrete floor. He opened his eyes and fear flooded his senses. He hadn’t set foot in here since...since...since...
‘Shit, Cas,’ Dean breathed. Cas raised an eyebrow, waiting, and Dean smiled. ‘Fuck yeah, this is only the beginning. I’ve wanted you for so long, angel, I...’ His tongue tripped at the sight of Cas’ growing grin. ‘I need you,’ He watched Cas’ glowing eyes soften, and the smile became more genuine.
filled with flowers and bees and butterflies. The colors were too vibrant, too warm, too inviting to be Purgatory. Instead of the smell of rotting corpses, tree sap, and sweltering heat, all Dean could smell was wildflowers and honey, and tree sap. The tree sap seemed to hang around, apparently.
Dean shot upright in his bed, drenched in a hot sweat, and felt arms pull him in for a tight hug. He was okay, it was just a nightmare...just another nightmare...this was Cas. It was Cas. He glanced around his room, and saw his door open slightly, letting the sunlight from his suite spill into the darkness.  Dean gripped his duvet tightly into his fists and forced himself to count and name the darkened shapes on his dresser near the door. Five things, he thought as he forced his breathing into a slower pace. His mask from the party, his box of watches, the tie he wanted to wear today, the candle Cas had bought him for Christmas two years ago, and his phone. Dean heaved out a low breath, pursing his lips so the sound came out in a whistle.
” Cas felt his face heat up, despite his usually firm control over his body. His hands trembled, and he could feel his pulse racing violently. He felt Dean’s soft puff of breath trail down the side of his neck, hot and enticing, and barely controlled himself when Dean pressed his lips to the skin there. Before Cas could say anything, Dean pulled back out of his space and gave him a dazzling grin. “Who knew the prophets were so horny, huh?"
refrained from rolling his eyes. Cas wasted no time, approaching the demon. Joe’s pleas fell on deaf ears, as the angel pressed his hand to Joe’s forehead and a blinding white light burst from the body, a high-pitched screech being the last thing Dean hears from the low-life.
There was the sound of little paws scampering across the hallway floor, and Cas pulled away from Dean. The hunter mourned the loss of his angel’s weight above him, but Cas just gave him the ghost of a smile. He pressed a soft kiss to Dean’s lips as if to say ‘
“Nonsense, Dean. It won’t be a waste if it’s you,” He smiled warmly. “How about we share a drag?” Before Dean had a chance to respond, the older man placed his cigarette back in his mouth.
Jack closed his eyes and took a deep breath as anger washed over him. It seems with every step forward he thinks he’s making; Chuck’s past mistakes throw him back to square one. One more miracle, one more star to fall, one more thread of gold for the Winchesters’ victory banner. No matter, Jack thought, as he scooped the sunflowers into a bouquet he planned to send to his mother later on. He can take his time in making things right again.
“Good, I’m glad. Now, with your itinerary this week,” Mary ruffled the newspaper into a folded position. Dean held back a sigh. His mother barely knew about Dean’s nightmares. He tried to mention them once, around the time of the King’s death, but to no avail. Dean didn’t know if she was actively avoiding the topic, even now after eight years, or if she couldn’t afford to hear about her son’s troubles. “You’re to attend Lord Zachariah Adler’s garden party Wednesday afternoon, and I figured it would be appropriate to align your dates with the party. So, who was your date this week?”
Dean swallowed down his trauma best he could, and sluggishly made his way to the far wall of the dungeon. As soon as he stood close enough, Cas wrapped a hand around the back of Dean’s neck.
‘Addicted? Obsessed’ He supplied, moving his hand down to Cas’ neck, fingers resting lightly on the angel’s pulsing carotid. Dean pressed his nose into the soft part between his earlobe and his neck and drew in a deep breath. He licked his lips, aware his tongue danced onto Cas’ too-warm skin. ‘Like a broken man desperate for another hit?’ He brought his teeth to Cas’ earlobe, nipping hard enough to make Castiel moan. He ran his tongue over the teeth marks. ‘Like you drive me fucking insane with
It’d been a year now since Sam watched Dean’s funeral pyre swallow the last remnants of his brother’s body. A lot had shifted and changed since then, but the one constant was Sam’s prayers. Ever since Dean died, Sam found he was praying loudly inside his mind. At first, it had been to chase away the melancholy that threatened to consume him completely, but pretty soon after Dean’s letter, the prayers morphed into his letters back to Dean. He’d like to believe Cas repeats them back to Dean when his brother needs to hear it. But honestly, he doesn’t know, and he doesn’t need to know either.
But as Lee started to pack up, Dean had started to shake and tried his hardest to avoid standing too close to anyone. His friend noticed then, and when it came time to say goodbye, Lee slipped Dean a crumpled-up piece of paper into his hands. Under John’s watchful eyes, Dean couldn’t do anything except shove his hands into his jeans pockets to hide the paper.
“Come on, Sammy, out with it. What’s got you staring?” He raised an eyebrow. Sam broke out into a massive grin, taking a deep drink from his coffee cup before he answered.
“And she’s also Cas’, who, not sure if you’ve noticed,” Sam smirked. “Is just as stubborn and decisive as you are, sometimes,” Dean chuckled as he nodded. Cas let out a bone-weary sigh, saying nothing. “Come on, I’ll introduce you to Mick,”
‘Guess sometimes it pays to be friends with the King,’ Cas huffed from the backseat. Sam and Dean shared a look at Cas’ haughty tone, and Dean glanced into the rear-view mirror to see the angel sitting cross-armed.
Dean had even started keeping a few of his things in the guest wardrobe. Not that Cas minds. He washes Dean’s clothes, folds them away, and doesn’t say anything. When Dean comes around from a long day working at Singer’s Salvage Yard, covered in motor oil and grease, Cas asks Dean to leave his clothes outside the guest bathroom, and he makes sure Dean has them ready to go for the next morning.
“I’m fine, buddy,” He sighed out. The burn of the alcohol down his throat only soothed his anger slightly. “Just didn’t think it was wise to be around that slimeball any longer than I was. Who knows what I would’ve done otherwise...”
Cas knows that smile. Dean used that smile when he was at bars and when he’s trying to convince people to give him more information than they should. “Heya Cas,” Dean’s voice fluttered through his lips like velvet on bare skin. Castiel stared in amazement as Dean brought his hand up to clasp the angel’s. “Good to see you,”
‘Don’t call me that.’ He snapped and turned to glare out the window. Dean let out a low chuckle, and he ignored Sam shifting uncomfortably in his seat.
and to John, there was a big difference. He only ever interacted with Dean to teach him and chastise him. Mary and Sam were blind to it, but Dean’s had one too many of John’s lessons turned into weapons to use against him. That wasn’t even including what John did just before Dean tried to run away...
It was a Pornhub link, and Cas was fully prepared to deal with it this time. He was sent to the gay subcategory, which didn’t surprise him. He was surprised to find, however, the link led to a new section he didn’t know the gay subcategory had―teacher/student relationships. Cas rolled his eyes, but he couldn’t judge himself too harshly, not with the lingering tension from dinner pulsating in his right hand. It was only after he’d bit down harshly on his bottom lip to quell the sound of his orgasm, and he wiped away all traces of his indiscretion that he allowed his conscience to swoop in to berate him. Perhaps the margaritas did more to him than he first considered because he didn’t stop himself from tapping out a message to Balthazar.
“Cas!” Jack had spotted him, shouting and waving. Dean froze and turned slowly. The man looked younger than Cas can remember seeing him, the lack of stress melting the years away. He was wearing a light blue button shirt, open over a white shirt and khaki shorts. As the angel approached the two, he couldn’t help checking out Dean’s athletic legs, bowed and sun-kissed as always.
“Weren’t you two friends back in high school?” Sam frowned. Dean nodded absently. “Didn’t know he was gay,”
“Well,” Cas plucked a scale off his trench coat. “Considering we’re here for twenty-four hours, and we’re hunting a specific flower, why don’t you tell us the long version as we’re tracking?” Benny glanced incredulously between the two.
There was a loud sound of whooshing feathers, and Dean ripped his hands from his face to stare up. There, standing right in front of him and looking like he suffered no physical damage whatsoever, was the angel who pulled Dean’s tortured soul from Hell all those years ago. Time had softened the warrior’s expressions, and right now, Castiel was looking at Dean with an expression he had never seen before on the angel’s face. He
“She sent a prayer my way to let me know. I tried to get back to you as soon as I could. But no matter, I’m here now. But you don’t need to speak if you don’t want to, Sam. If you want, you can just pray to me, and I’ll hear you,” Sam frowned, drawing in another heady breath.
“Yeah, I could. It was very pretty,” He looked back at Emma. “You’ve got a very pretty voice, Emma,” She giggled, and Dean felt his heart warm at the sight of her smile again. “I love you too, honey,” He blew her a kiss, and her eyes sparkled with happiness. “Makes me think,” He looked back at Cas. “Maybe I could hear your true voice properly now,”
“’Meaningless’? Sir, you wound me. I thought we were having a good time,” He leaned back, cracking a smile. Crowley raised an eyebrow and waited. Dean sighed. “It’s either do this or settle with the stupid marriage arrangement I agreed to when I was sixteen,” He fiddled with the napkin on the table.
“Hell yeah! I hope I’m a good boyfriend, ‘cause I wanna be good. I wanna think I’ve treated you right, and if I haven’t, I wanna fix that. I wanna be there for you because I think I know you’re always there for me. Or you try to be, as often as you can. There’s this part of me, it’s so strange...” Dean shook his head in wonder. “There’s a part of me that feels like I’ll always know you. I could have all my memories taken from me, I could forget my own name, but I think I’ll always know you. It’s not a brain thing, ya know?” He shrugged. “Like it’s instinctive,”
