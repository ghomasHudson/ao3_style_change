“Wherever we are, let us out or I swear to god I’m-”  Dean threatens before he’s interrupted with a sharp look from Coy.
“Quackers.”  He deadpanned.  Then Dean couldn’t hold back anymore. He was laughing so hard his cheeks ached from smiling.  Dean seriously hoped the rest of his life was spent this way. Always one-upping his own happiness.  Cas wasn’t surprised when Dean kissed him. It felt like an extension of all this happiness, like there was no better way to celebrate it.
“Hi.”  Dean croaks out, lifting a hand to touch his cheek, he can feel the liquid in his eyes that’s more than enough proof he’s crying.  The man he loves here with him right now, the only thing he could’ve wanted.  Makes sense he only gets what he wants in life as he’s dying.
“I’m saying I’m not gonna pick some dumb broad.  It’s Cas or nothing.  And I don’t care if you get on board or not, you just needed to know.  I wasn’t gonna hide it from you anymore.”  With that Dean left the room and went back to the kitchen.  So that was that.  His son was…
“Yeah, big ass mall a bit more northeast of here.  Why?”  Dean looked at her, suspicions rising. Charlie was biting her lip before the words just seemed to burst out of her.
is Lucille.  Instead of watching you fucks die like I have so many other weak mother fuckers along the way… I have a new idea.  I’ll let Lucille protect you too.”  He lowered Lucille down again and met each pair of eyes in the group.  “Stand with me and anyone who tries to hurt us… anyone who gets in our way… will end up like him.”  Negan gestured to the sad meatloaf fucker on the ground.  “So far you’ve been survivors, that’s the best you can hope for.  Your leader is dead, and he was
“I think Sam covered all the ground there, Dean.  You’re here aren’t you?” Cas took another half step forward, still studying Dean but trying to be more subtle about it.  Dean’s arm dropped and he nodded.
“Just… curious.”  Dean needed to stop looking at his shoes, Cas was going to think something was up or he was hiding something, not just the fact that he was thinking about queueing up his favorite show on his laptop.  It had… been a while since he watched it.
“I thought he said he was gonna knock it off.”  Dean’s giggles petered down enough to get out a few words.
“The fuck does that mean?”  John asked, glaring at his eldest son, he watched Dean swallow as he stared at the floor.  Watched him straighten up just slightly to meet his eyes for a moment before looking off out the window.
“Right, yeah course.”  Then he turned to walk out of the garage, trying to ignore the heat rising on his face at looking like a complete idiot.  He just wanted to talk him out of his stupid decisions, that stupid box, his stupid martyrdom.  Duh.
“Things sneakin’ up on me in the dark are either dead or about to be.”  He warned, pointing his rifle into the dark.  A scruffy man in a vest with a crossbow hanging across his back emerged a few moments later with his hands up.
“I’m gonna say it again more slowly, you took something from me and he doesn’t belong to you.  Your deal is
“You’ve been givin’ me heart eyes ever since you woke up, I keep wondering if it’s gonna wear off.”  Mary said wistfully as she pressed the button to close the garage door and opened the door into the house.
“Maybe not what I thought you’d look like, but you were everything I hoped he’d have.  That’s all that mattered.  I just feel stupid that it took me till your wedding day for me to see that.”  Cas nodded and looked down at his fingers.
since before he could remember.  That it held the most evil archangel to ever befall the ranks.  How this archangel had raised war against God, because he didn’t like the humans.  This was blasphemous to angels.  Since humans were God’s creation it was their sworn duty to protect them.  But the Morningstar saw fit to tempt them, turn them.  To twist them into horrible things capable of horrible deeds.  So God and the other 3 archangels rose up against him, and it was the Mighty Micheal that was able to lock his own brother away.  Then they called in a specialist, because God knew a cage wouldn’t be enough to contain his wayward son for all time.
“Well, one of my brothers is named Lucifer.”  John spit his food, Mary looked over concerned patting his back as he coughed out the surprise laugh.
“Negan.  But don’t call me coach.  Makes it sound like you got some weird ass kink you haven’t told Sherry about yet.”  Dwight chuckled a bit at that.
“You should start showing me some more respect or you won’t ever be seeing your brother or your friend again… Is that understood?”  His tone is almost playful as each word drips threateningly off the tip of his tongue. Coy glances up to see Dean swallow nervously, clearly making the wise decision to back down.  Matching looks of grim determination settle onto both of the men’s faces. When neither of them say anything Coy smiles brightly and takes that as his signal to move on with the explanations.  He begins to pace causally side to side, each step accentuating a word or gesturing appropriately when necessary.
“Yes.”  Dean manages to say, without missing a beat.  He watches as Cas’ eyes visibly warm even as the smile disappears.  How he swallows and his adam’s apple bobs.  As he drags his eyes back up the length of his throat, and chin, and lips how his tongue darts out to lick them.  Then it’s back to those eyes, with the humour and cautious optimism now playing in them.  “I’m not running.”  Then Dean carefully pushes his hands up, smoothing down the shirt, thumb lightly rubbing the silk of the tie, his fingers just under the edge of the tan armour.  All the way up to grip behind his neck…then he waits.
Castiel was a fun addition.  He was different.  He was something that was unexpected.  And as much as he liked new things... he hated them.  So of course, there was endless fun to be had with Castiel.
“We want our memories.  Completely with no tampering no matter where you decide to zap us.  Even if we lose the game. Capiche?”
“Don’t start singing Shania now you corny idiot.”  She pulled back and he wiped her tears away and pressed gentle kisses all over her face.  “I love you, John.  More than life itself.  Thank you for taking care of me.”
her.  Her eyes were all milky and now-”  He cut out again, and in the silence he heard screaming.  The hairs on John’s arm raised.  He couldn’t go to him, couldn’t help.  He had to stay with Mary, but he wanted to be prepared.  Years ago when he’d come back he’d stocked up on weapons again.  Mary hadn’t liked it so he’d locked them all in the basement.  Now he went down there, something was very wrong.  “Dad she… I had to lock her in the bathroom.  I don’t know how but I don’t think she’s… I think she’s… dead.  But she’s still alive and-”  There was a crashing noise.
Until next time please leave your thoughts, questions, and predictions in the comments!  I love reading and responding to all of them.  Thank you for reading I appreciate you so much!
“If nothing else there would be potentially a lot of supplies we don’t find much of elsewhere.  Plus that place has a bunch of mini golf and arcades?  We could use some fun in the apocalypse.  Clearing it out will be hard.  It will take everyone and we’ll have to be super careful, methodically approaching each section, being super thorough.  We’ll want maps, a few more people, like Victor, in on this.  Some heavy load trucks, cement blockers, so-”  Charlie jumped and hugged him despite the filth, squeaking happily.
“Sam better not lose that one.”  Then he looks at Cas who’s watching him with this hopeful stare, that makes Dean’s mouth run dry.  His brain fumbles around for what to say.  “Uh..”  Awesome.  Eloquence at it’s finest.  “Hi.”  Dean says softly.  Definitely not winning any Darwin awards.   Cas gives him a little knowing smile.
“S-sammy?”  Dean slurs, trying to get up but his vision blacks out and he finds himself back on the ground.  The guy moves away to stab the bozo through the head then he’s back, closer to Dean’s face so he can actually see him.  Dean takes in a sharp breath that somehow makes his head hurt more. “Oh thank fuck, it is you.”  Dean says, and his voice sounds a bit high pitched and giddy to his ears.  There’s concern and shock on his baby brother’s face.
“I don’t know how you did this for a year, I lost my mind after the first hour.”  Mary just shrugged.
“You’ve got pretty comfortable telling us what to do.  What were you… y’know...before?”  Dwight asked him as they exited the store where everyone had stocked up on warmer clothing under his direction.
?  How do you expect us to watch you murder one of our own, and then turn around and fall in line behind you?!”  Asked a man from the crowd who attempted to glare Negan down, Negan just smirked.
“Why do you think that?”  Cas turns to Dean and tilts his head slightly. Dean blushes and fidgets for a moment before admitting.
“So you’re gay. That’s what you two have been hiding from me?”  He heard Dean shuffling on the couch and turned slightly to see his very stiff form.
.  He mouthed to her still face, unable to speak anymore.  He tried to get back on track, he needed to call the nurse, her parents, his boys...
Dean heard the bunker door open and close, knowing it had to be Cas since Sam had only been gone an hour and he had made it VERY clear he wasn’t going to be back until later.  Dean walked out to greet Cas and as soon as they saw each other, idiotic grins split both their faces.
“He’s… in the impala.  I drove us here because… when we went to check on Sam, he-... It wasn’t good, he’s-”  Cas swallowed thickly. “Dean got bit.  And he’s really sick now.  I don’t know what to do.”  John squeezed his shoulder.
“You’re crazy, you know that?” Dean bumped their knees together which Cas smiled at before turned to give Dean a very serious look.
“No, I’m just using her face.  How are you here?  You’re not supposed to be here.”  The being, who Dean must now assume to be The Empty, seethes through clenched teeth.  Dean stands, pulling his shoulders back.
“Well, I don’t know about that last one but the rest for sure.  There were some good ones too.  Psychics. Some witches weren’t horrible, though you could never really trust them.  Then there were various pagan gods, rugarus, djinn-”
“Thank you for loving him.”  John whispered then he stood up and walked back around the corner.  The sun hit the reds and yellows of the trees, a slight wind rustled a few more loose and they floated to the ground, it was surreal imagery considering.  The shot rang out in the autumn quiet making his ears ring, John turned and hit the siding a few times, unwilling tears slipped out of his eyes.  He had to get control of himself, that sound was sure to attract undead.  He pushed himself to work, he rounded the corner into the backyard again and saw his pistol laying in between the two graves.  Now it seemed weirdly fitting that there was only one good shovel left as John went to work piling dirt onto what was left of his family.  Once that was done he found two plain boards and carved headstones for the three of them, Castiel and Dean shared one.  He wished he could go find his other son and do the same for him, but he knew it was too dangerous and despite everything he wasn’t determind to run a suicide mission.
“I haven’t given up, John.  But I won’t force you to keep watching a dead body.  This isn’t like you and your coma.  If I go I’m not waking up again, there isn’t a cure for cancer.  Besides, our boys are gonna need you.  You need to live your life and not devote it to some carrot of a wife.”  Mary told him with a dark water laugh.
“Yeah what he said.”  Dean smiled at him as he pulled away, then gestured for his dad to sit back down and they all sat down together.  Dean and Sam took the other couch, elbowing each other playfully the way brothers did.
“You see, Cas.  He did this funny little thing.  Years ago he rescued me from Hell.  But in order to do that he had to stake a claim on my soul.  Something about the only way to bust through the nine rings with everything that still makes me
“You assbutt.”  Dean told him, dropping his head onto Cas’s shoulder.  Cas chuckled, it was a welcome sound, deep and comforting.  Dean snaked his arms around Cas’s waist, holding him like he’d never allowed himself too.  Cas wrapped his arms around Dean’s shoulders.  “Can we really have this?”  Dean asked quietly, partly to himself, but also to Cas and the universe. Cas pulls away and gives Dean another of his trademark smirks, though this one seems a bit exhausted.  Cas grabs his hand and pulls them both the rest of the way down the hall and into the shower room.  Dean knows Cas heard him, and is just waiting patiently for his answer.  Or maybe the correct term is
Just as Cas was finishing his last fry, his phone beeped with his signature text message sound.  Dean raised an eyebrow as Cas pulled out the device and checked the notification.
“Your mother.”  John said quietly, Cas scrubbed a hand over his face and closed his eyes.  “Or what was.  It’s not her anymore.”  Dean turned his gaze to his father, sad eyes head droping into the back of the couch.
They were both dead.  Sam and Castiel didn’t survive the flood.  Because if they had somehow survived, potentially as injured or worse off than he was, he had never searched for them.  If they had survived only to die because they were waiting for Dean to-.. He couldn’t let himself go down that train of thought, not without a bottle to drown away the side effects of misplaced hope.
“That is unlike Sam.”  Cas said in a puzzled tone as he pulled on his jacket while Dean slipped on his shoes and headed to the garage.
The angels (try as they might) couldn’t undo what Gadreel had done.  So they needed to take a different approach for protection.  Whereas Gadreel was previously an outside observer, Castiel would be placed directly on the inside.
, just like you always do, you big baby.  He’s amazing, and I’m sure you’ll feel the same way again.”  John hummed, trusting his wife completely but still feeling off kilter.  Some things in this universe were more alien than any whacky creature from his first one.  Hell, if someone told him fairies were real it would have felt less strange to gank a tiny sparkly creature than contemplate his son potentially being one.  “Anyway, you need to be on your
“Look at this Big Balled motherfucker right here.  I like that, that’s useful, so here’s what I’d say, Big Balls.  Fall
He wished he could just kill the hope too, that way he would be able to live without the ghosts of his family always hanging over him.  Dean especially grieved the life he could have had with Cas had he not been such a coward for most of his life.  His thumb rubbed at his empty ring finger, his fingers trying to twist the jewelry that wasn’t there.
He hadn’t heard from him.  Or Dean.  The anxiety threatened to over take him, but he couldn’t let that happen.  Instead he just let it fuel him, made him mad.  He got up from the bed and looked out the window again.  No one was around, the place looked deserted.  The neighbor who had fled had left things strewn on his lawn, garage door wide open.  John shook his head and turned back around to the room trying to look anywhere but where what was left of his wife laid and saw the most worrying thing:  her eyes were open.
“The same someone you two keep avoiding talking about around me?”  Mary paused midway to bringing more food to her mouth.
“So what is it?  This plan.  You’ve got five minutes before I’m stripping.”  Dean told Charlie who aptly shuddered.
“You can’t run anymore.”  Cas doesn’t say it in a threatening way, or in a demanding way, but in a desperate pleading way that Dean reads in the frantic shift of his eyes.  He can feel it in the way his arms bracket him in, like when someone puts the words
.  You lost someone close to you?”  He took a moment to breathe in and clench his fists which served to stave off whatever part of him wanted to drown at his own harsh words.  He couldn’t give a fuck anymore.  It didn’t
“It’s Sam.”  Cas answered without prompting.  Dean nodded then excused himself to the bathroom, saying they would be leaving when he got back.  Cas pulled up the text and burst out laughing for what felt like the tenth time that day.
“You may begin.”  Cas tells him and Coy flashes a brilliant smile as he reaches for his first white pawn, a small soldier man with a shield, on the far right side of the board.  He shifts him two spaces up.
“Sorry, I don’t quite know how this plays out and I like this coat.”  He grabbed it gently and slid into it again.  In a swift motion he wiped some of the gore off the bat into the grass on the ground and looked back up at the pale faces before him.  “You’re fucking scared, huh?”  He leveled the bat at them.  “You fucking should be.”  Then he set the bat down, leaned it against his thigh and pulled out the leather gloves he’d found.  “You guys look like you’re on a nonstop bullet train to pee pants city.  Like you can’t even process… you can’t… give me a minute.”  Something was forming here, he was shaping it to guard against his own future and it had to be just right.  He spotted the barbwire he’d fallen into on the ground.  “Sit tight.  Dwight, don’t let them move.”  Dwight herded everyone back a bit as Negan grabbed some of the barbed wire and kneeled next to the fire.  He took a moment to notice his hands were shaking, what he had done was catching up with him.  He’d never just killed a man like that.  It had always been monsters.  Demons, vamps, ghouls, were’s, wendigo, shapeshifters, djinn, not humans.  Never humans, they were the ones he was supposed to be saving.
It’s about a month later when Dean walks in the bathroom and realizes the ducks have multiplied a ridiculous amount.
“Oh we still fight, don’t you worry yourself, Petunia.  But why would you have been dropping your boys off with me?  Where was Mary?”  John sighed and tipped his head down to his chest.
“I need to ask you both something, and I don’t mean to pile more onto your plate, but I don’t wanna put it off any further in case I lose my nerve.”  Mary gave him a puzzled look but Cas just gestured for them both to sit down.  John grabbed Mary’s hand and pulled her to sit, his heart was beat heavy in his chest even if he didn’t entirely know why.
“You forget I’ve already lived through you dying once.  Mary Lucille Winchester, you are the love of my life.  I’m the luckiest man in all the universes to get to hold you like this, and I’m not gonna think about some future that’ll never happen.  I lived it once.  And when you’re-”  He cleared his throat carefully, if he said it he’d cry and he’d promised her to be less weepy.  “I’ll still love you when you’re gone as if you’re right next to me.  Everyday.  Nothing will change that.”  Her eyes watered up and she pressed her face into his neck.
“If you keep that up, I'm going to forget all about our new friends.”  Coy reminds her, completely in favor of this option with his wife, where he can satisfy her every fancy.  Erata pouts at him in a moment’s consideration before shaking her head.
“Yes, you will both be playing chess together, as a team, facing off against me.  But this is no ordinary game of chess. There is no point in ordinary. Your goal is to win both by capturing as many pieces of mine as possible and by placing me in check mate.  Each piece will gain you an advantage for the next stage of the game. But, player beware, for each piece of
Or he could tell her the truth… But that just didn’t seem possible.  He would sound crazy.  Talking about a life lived without her.  Seeking vengeance for her, raising the boys on the road… and as a side effect, being a shit father.  He sighed and she raised her eyebrows at him.  John might tell her one day but for now.
Mary didn’t respond, but he hadn’t expected her to.  Still he picked up her limp hand and held it in his, bringing it up to his lips for a quick kiss.
“My father’s a novelist actually.”  Castiel continued easily.  “I was the playwright for one of Dean’s shows in college, it’s how we met and became friends.”  Cas gave Dean a smile so sweet it was likely to cause a cavity.  John couldn’t tell if it made him sick in general, or if it was the way Dean smiled back that made him nauseous.  He knew that look on his son’s face, he’d seen the same look a thousand times on his wife’s own face.  Dean was a goner and Castiel looked the same.  John would try to be pleasant, but he couldn’t say he would ever be totally okay with a thing like this.
Charlie’s tactical plan had been smart.  Under the mall was where the old commuter rail used to end, as well as buses.  There were a lot of railings and fences, all they needed to do was open the doors into the mall and make a lot of noise to summon them down.  From what they could tell, the Mega Mall had been used as a refugee camp in the early days.  But things had gone sour, very very sour.  Now the building was a mess of half fortified, half infested with bozos.  Dean had a thrill running through his veins as the adrenaline kicked into high gear.  It would take days, if not weeks of careful sweeping and planning to get the bozos out and keep them from getting back in.
Here's for all the Walking Dead fun in this chapter.  For reference, the 2013 NYCC TWD panel took place the day before the premiere of season 4 for TWD.  I had fun rewatching this panel, and if any of you are also fans and feel like indulging, you can find it really easily on youtube.
“Don’t thank me just yet.  We’ll have to convince everyone else.”  Dean told her.  Charlie nodded and grimaced down at her clothes.
“Was he… not in your dream either or something?  Had he… passed?”  Mary asked him gently and slowly he peeked his eyes open to see her again.  Truly an angel to even be putting up with this whole ridiculous situation.
He should be freaking out.  This certainly didn’t seem like any afterlife he had ever read about.  A purgatory situation would maybe have wound him up alone in a hospital.  But then he wasn’t alone was he...  Someone was holding his hand.  The sensation crept back into that hand, a numbness he didn’t know had been there until the pins and needles sensation flooded down to his fingertips.  He squeezed the hand back.  It was small and familiar.  His chest felt tight, his heart monitor sped up.  John Winchester did not want to open his eyes.
“Sorry, it’s just… when I told them all it was only a few weeks before.  You remember how things started on the coast and then spread inward?  Well when I first told Cas was also the first day I remember hearing about how weird people were acting in LA.”
Though when he made that promise he always pictured himself being first to go, it would have been a nice change.  But he didn’t get nice, that wasn’t the way things went for him.
of all things fascinate you Cas?”  Dean chirps in, and a blue gaze raises to meet him.  A sad rumination crosses his face for a moment before it flits away.
“Where the hell did you lot come from?”  Asked another woman with short brown hair, and skill similar to the blonde woman’s that made Dean think they had been trained in hand-to-hand before this all started.
“No, he had left when I was a kid.  Just went out one day and never came back.  I think this amnesia thing is gonna be a worse situation than I thought.”  Mary leaned in and kissed his forehead, her hand slid up and down his arm then stopped to squeeze his bicep.  “What about your parents? In my… dream, they both died when we were still dating.”  Mary squeezed his bicep a little more, then sought out his other hand so she could twine their fingers.
“It’s just… on the phone you said we needed to talk.  But it was after we had said we would talk about that,” Here he gestures toward the trailer hitch with the ominous black box. “So I just thought it was about something else.  Clearly I was wrong though so no worries, let’s just-”
It happened again and again, he would meet people, get to know them, he lost them.  They’re all weak and useless which made him more and more angry.  He stopped introducing himself to them, he didn’t see the point.  All they ever did was die anyway.  He told the last girl as much when she admitted she’d been bitten, and he left her.  He could do this alone if he had to, none of these people meant anything anyway.  He stopped trying to find people, and one day as he’s cooking a rabbit he shot over his campfire when he heard a noise that was too careful to be an undead bastard.
“I disagree, you taste amazing.” Cas’s voice is all grumbly and husky, making Dean want to immediately resume their previous activities. Cas’s hand traces up the side of his face and into his damp hair lightly pulling on the strands.  “Forever is what I want.  Which, if that’s what you want, then we’re starting today. I suggest we hurry through this shower and get back to your room with that mattress you love so much.”
“I’m in the kitchen hun!  Just pulling dinner out of the oven.”  Making the one dish she was actually trusted to make,
“Don’t see yourself short, hun.  You’re, at the very least, cheese covered broccoli.”  He didn’t know how he managed to joke at that moment, but it was worth it when she laughed and hit him lightly on the arm.  She was right, she was always right.
After she called the boys the day was a flurry of how many different ways the hospital could poke, prod, and scan him to make sure he was fine.  His brain was all back online and functioning.  He was diagnosed with mild amnesia, with the prognosis that he would start to fill in the gaps eventually.  All his physical parts were present and working, if anything he was a bit weak from sleeping for a year.  He’d need to hit the gym or something to start building back up what he’d had before he’d gone to hell, left there, and somehow woke up in this strange yet wonderful place.  Well… he hoped it was wonderful.  He’d have to do research, extensively.  Call Bobby, and dredge up other old contacts.  Go as deep as he possibly could to really figure this out. If it was safe here he wanted to know now, and not with his pants around his ankles in a public restroom.
A screaming headache split his head and that was something in itself because he could feel his head again.  A steady, high pitched beeping noise next to his ear.  He was laying down, but at a weird propped up angle that made his back scream. It felt like a hospital.  As soon as he thought that he could smell it and taste it.  Starchy sheets beneath him.  Something stuck into the back of his hand, probably an IV drip.  Something else attached to his finger, probably the heart monitor that was beeping steadily beside him.  He had no idea how he was staying so calm.
tell the Morningstar of his true identity.”  Raphael, another of his archangel brethren lectured Castiel about his new position.  “You will limit your interactions with the humans who pass through.  You are to protect them from our brother and his treachery.  You
Dean Winchester had carved out a place for himself in this world of cold and ice.  He had a group who needed him, so he wasn’t entirely lonely, but after the pain of losing his brother and his best friend, it was easier to maintain emotional distance.  That was his rule ‘No Commiserating’ that he tried to abide by just to keep himself sane.  Dean could carry that weight on his own.  Because it wasn’t just his brother and best friend he’d lost, it had been his entire group.  Flash flood situation, back when they were still trying to make it down south.  Maybe it had been a hurricane, it was hard to tell without meteorologists to keep an eye on the weather from above.
“Hmph.  Well, that’s enough of that fantasy shit.  This is the real world now John, so tell me.  Do you remember anything about how to do your
I get to become a real life pirate.”  Dean is still smiling goofily at Cas’ bewildered expression.  “This is only a minor loss.  I just thought it was funny cause I can’t feel that it isn’t there.  In movies you hear about phantom sensations of lost limbs, but I didn’t think it would feel this… tingly?”  Dean practically giggles and sees Cas crack the smallest of smiles at his best friend’s goofiness.
“You can’t run forever.”  He hears Cas tell him as his eyes slip over to the hunk of metal next to his Baby.  Then his eyes slide back to Cas.
“Yeah, he probably got it from there.”  Dean just shrugs again, and goes back to the task at hand, preparing meat for some awesome homemade burgers he’s planned for dinner tonight.
“We were gonna have to block off the main doors with cement anyway.  As is, we need more time in here or we’re gonna get seriously fucked over. “  Dean told her which made Charlie grimace and nod.  She sent Jo over to the doors to direct the truck boys through.  Even though Garth aimed the vehicle carefully, there would still be a problem.  The digger they had found downstairs had brought out to knock down the cement vehicle stoppers, and with that destroyed Garth plowed through.
“Oh, Castiel.  I’m so happy for you two.”  Mary jumped onto the other couch to hug him, Cas which made the other man laugh.  When Mary pulled back from him she put her hands on his face.  “No matter what you do I know he’ll say yes.  I’m so excited to finally be able to call you my son.”  John watched in awe as Castiel’s eyes misted up at the comment.
“I want a funeral.  But I want it before I’m gone.  After I’m gone I don’t care what you do, but I want this.”  John gave a weak smile, nodded, and set to work planning.  “But let’s call it a Death Party.”  She said with a mischievous smirk.  He texted two people he trusted to get this done right, Jess and Cas.  Then he texted Cas to contact the one person he knew could keep them all laughing through the tears, Cas’ brother Gabriel who had strangely grown on him over the past year.
“John?”  Mary asked quietly, squeezing his hand lightly.  He looked over at her with eyes he knew were bright red from fighting back tears, into her steady blue ones.  He couldn’t say anything, just leaned in and kissed her forehead.
“Have you actually asked him?”  Charlie wondered, a simple hand flopping to the side to accompany her question.  Dean gave her an incredulous look.
Two openings appear on opposite walls within the shot, doors sliding to reveal the dark outline of two men in each rectangle who stumble into the room and turn around to see the doors slide closed behind them.
The ship crashes into the large statue while riding a massive storm swell not even an hour later.  Many of the humans on board die.  Castiel watches from the distance, determined to observe until it is obvious he should intervene.
“Means I like both.  Girls and guys.”  Dean rubbed his palms on his jeans and glanced at his father, watching for his reaction.
The next six months were tough, he wouldn’t call them hell because he’d actually been there, but it was close.  Most of his torture in hell had been physical, and while Mary was going through physical hell, his was all emotional.  There were nights he’d find her crying on the bathroom floor from the pain, having just puked up yet another meal.  A side effect of the chemo.
“I am proud of them.  Both of them.”  Mary smiled and leaned back so she could put her hands on his face.
“Anima et anima, tenet vinculum profunde increduli omnes sentimus. Dividimus muros eius et convertam ligat omnes aditus aperietur. Quod præceptum est ei.”  The air holds tight with crackling energy just before it snaps.  A crack echoes around Dean as a purple glowing streak appears before him.  It’s perfectly straight and seems to vibrate his eyeballs just looking at it, even though it’s holding perfectly still.  Like a strip club neon light, suspended by nothing. It held all the hope and dread that had been broiling in Dean’s gut since… well just since.  He stands up, pulls his shoulders back, he won’t go quietly into this dark void.
“Uhh… I know how to fix a car.  But all this paperwork and stuff?  I had no idea we even ran a business together.  I’m guessing we’re partners?”  Bobby nodded, and John let out a low whistle. “We disagreed on a lot of things in my dream, mainly my parenting style.  I used to dump the boys off on you, then run off to fight some evil fucker.  It’s hard to imagine us working together well enough to own a business honestly.”  Bobby laughed, a grumbly sort of sarcastic thing at that.
duck.  He said I was allowed that.”  Cas stated this so matter of factly that Dean burst out into more barely contained chuckles and after a moment Cas joined him.  Dean turned to look at him with adoring eyes still crinkled with mirth. He was pretty sure he had never been happier.
“Cas hated him, if that gives you any idea.”  Dean opened up, and though he’d told her about John before it had always been a passing mention of another story.  How he had influenced one small thing.  He takes another swig of drink and forges on.  “He was an asshole.”  Charlie reached out and grabbed his hand, he gripped it like a lifeline.
“You want us to play chess with you?  What do you not have any friends? Lonely childhood?”  Coy smirks at that.
“They both loved you, so much.  You did good by them, even if you only remember these last three years, you did good.”  John didn’t respond to that, he couldn’t think about his sons then, or speak about them.  He had to stay strong for what came next.
“Makes sense.”  Garth chimed in with a nod from where he was stoking the fire.  Billie sat back in the corner, wrapped in a blanket, seemingly staring off into space and ignoring them.  The rest of the group had picked other rooms in the house, half the reason they’d stayed was the amount of fireplaces throughout the mansion.  That way they didn’t have to spend every night in a cold huddle on the floor, they could actually spread out.  “Can’t be a big brother all the time.”  Garth continued.
“Stop running and actually talk to me, then.”  Cas cutting him off wasn’t super common, but he never thought he would see the day that Cas put his foot down about
One day they were overrun, middle of the day a whole herd of the undead swarmed the hotel and something in him snapped.  He didn’t want to lose people again, they were all separated but he started calling out orders, directions to move, just like he did with his team not that long ago.  Somehow they made it, with him swinging his bat like a mad man and everyone else following his plays, they all made it out alive.  It was a first for him, even if he’d almost died toward the end of the process, something in him had decided to care again.  It didn’t feel familiar though, it felt stiff.  He didn’t care if it was genuine, he simply did not want to be alone anymore.  Starting over was tiring.
“And that’s my cue.”  Coy says. Erata blinks and he’s gone.  The men on the TV continue their banter as she snuggles into the couch happily.
?”  He turned fully around as they all stared at him, he checked his wounds for a moment and noticed the girl on the ground wearing his jacket.
“Sh-, Uh… Shower sounds good?”  Dean manages to get out and internally groans.  God, who the fuck is he?  Some shy little teenager with stomach butterflies? It’s horrible and embarrassing.
“Of course.”  Cas sets his drawing pencil neatly back in its case and stands to follow Dean.  “Is Sam coming?”
in line or I’ll crawl up that pee hole of yours, get really deep inside so I can get a message to those Big Balls without anything getting lost in translation.  And I’ll say… Big Balls, I know you think you’re the King Shit of Fuck Mountain and you’re not accustomed to taking shit from anyone but things are
.  He’d wasted his whole life for this one thing, and his son had been the one to end it all.  To end the cycle.  He’d put his hand on Dean’s shoulder, looked over and gave Sam a small nod.  It was over.  He felt himself losing connection with the material plane, expecting his soul to finally move on to whatever came next.  But something felt off.  He glitched out of existence like a ghost, gold sparking around him.  It felt fast and slow.  There was nothing to see, feel, hear, smell, or taste.  He was nothingness hurtling towards the unknown.  Or he was completely frozen for the rest of eternity.
“You tellin’ me you’ve never heard of a zombie before?  Or even people who come back to life after they die and just want to eat other people?”  Cas just shook his head gravely.
“Yes, John.  You were in a major car accident.  You’ve been in a coma ever since.  Do you remember now?”  She squeezed his hand, using her patient motherly tone he had seen with Dean so long ago.
And there he stood.  The Empty was gone.  In its place stood one of the most welcome sights.  Wild dark hair, blue eyes, stupid trenchcoat.
It was another year later when Sam flew back home from California, he’d just passed the bar out in Stanford completing his law degree.  Everyone was over for dinner at the Winchester’s.  Dean and Castiel were there too, it only bothered John a little bit these days.  It was easy to get used to him considering Dean made a habit of treating his mother so well.  Always showing up to take her accompany her shopping, or help her with the garden, or just cook them both dinner.  On his rare extra good days, he even started to consider Castiel somewhat a third son.  At this particular dinner everyone saw fit to drop bombs on him.  He’d been back for 2 years, he was considered officially recovered and that it was unlikely he’d ever get all of his memory back.  Just at the end of dinner, right before the plates were cleared Sam announced that him and Jess were moving back to Kansas.  It was great news, Dean was probably most excited, the brothers were very close which made John happy to see.  Then Sam added, much to Mary’s delight that Jess was expecting.
“I had the same thought a few weeks ago.  How much we have to be therapists for each other and not a single one of us with any degree in psychology.”  Dean told her and sat his head up slightly for another sip.
“It’s okay son, you did your best.”  Dean huffed a disagreement at that but didn’t seem to have the energy to refute further.  “Son, I’m about to lose you too and I need you to be straight with me.  You want out before you turn into one of those things, you say the word.”  Dean and Cas were both quiet, Cas gaped at him somewhere between furious and shocked.  “Or you turn, and we’ll… take care of it then.”
now.”  He paused and stood his ground, flames danced toward the sky just at his leather clad back.  “We’re your
“Dean we had to-...” Cas seems distracted by something, he glances down at the end of his bed.  “I cut off your foot.  We weren’t sure it would work but it did, and I don’t regret it.”  Cas tells him and Dean wants to laugh at himself for not noticing.  He pulls at the sheets around his legs and sees what he certainly didn’t feel before.  Which is so weird that it couldn’t be anything but funny, so when he starts laughing Cas starts babbling clearly concerned.  “Kate said it might be a shock when you woke up, but we made sure we had you on as much medication as was safe.  They still might have to take the amputation up to the knee, but Kate thought it might be possible as is, as long as your bone doesn’t break through the skin or muscle, and we find you a workable prosthetic asap.”  Cas finishes noticing Dean biting his lip and looking at him like he’s the most adorable thing in the world, Cas sighs, a bit annoyed despite it all.  “Dean this isn’t funny, I cut off your leg.”
“So… did you just admit that Cas is the Jack to your Rose?” Charlie taunted him, as another red wave spread across Dean’s cheeks.
“My… father?”  John had gone tense all over.  Was this the sort of place where nothing bad had ever happened to him or anyone he loved.  “He’s...he.”  John swallowed thickly, closed his eyes, pinched the bridge of his nose.  He felt Mary’s hand come to the side of his face, it relaxed him slightly, her thumb ran along the creases of his forehead and then stroked back into his hair.
”  Dean couldn’t hold himself back, he rushed forward, clutched Cas’s face in his hands and put their foreheads together.  “It worked.  You’re here.”
“What the hell Dean!  You scared the shit outta me!”  Sam complained, tucking his gun back in his waistband.  Dean didn’t answer. He was making this dry wheezing sound in between actual laughs and his face was bright red.  Dean opened his eyes to take in Sam’s aghast face and only laughed harder, water leaking out of his eyes. Sam grew annoyed.  “Dude, what is it!” Dean released one of his hands from holding his stomach to point in the corner where the toilet was. Sam turned and there… was the most ridiculous and annoying sight.
anymore.  What mattered was shit like this not happening.  “Even if you haven’t you should still be aware of the fucking world around you.  It’s
“You shouldn’t be here, Dean.”  Cas was gripping his shoulders, hands sliding up to his neck, thumbing the collar of his shirt.
“Mary?”  He asked with a choking voice and tears falling down his face.  Purgatory be damned, this was heaven as far as he was concerned.  Anywhere he was with her was heaven.  He felt more tears tracking down his face.  “Mary.”  He tried to lean forward, he wanted to grab her face.  Feel the smooth skin, kiss those lips, hug her against him.  She was faster than him though, a firm hand pressed on his shoulder keeping him back.
He choked and collapsed into her chest, felt the painful sobs wrack through him.   Thinking was impossible, breathing wasn’t happening.  No man should have to live through this twice and yet he had.
. After a moment Jack pulls away from the hug and Dean steps back into Cas’ space at his side.  Cas gives a little look of raised eyebrows as if to question his breach of personal space.  Dean ignores him.  “Not that we don’t appreciate the visit, Jack.  Cause we do.  Just feels like you need something.”  Jack nods at them.
“CAS!”  He shouts into the abyss, turning and looking for any sign of light or movement.  “CAS!  We gotta go!  Where are you?”  Dean’s voice is sucked into the void, it doesn’t echo or do anything other than drop off once it’s out of his mouth.  From around him the air reverberates, like an echo in reverse, his name.  His eyes water.  “Cas!  I’m here, wherever the hell you are, get to me man!”  The room around him seems to vibrate with white noise, the contrast is stark after the silence.  It grows louder, forcing a pressure into his brain till Dean has to crouch down and cover his ears..
“So, to summarize.  You’re renaming Death to Hemlock.  They’re a guide for.. What?  Lost and confused souls?”  Jack nods. “And you want Cas to be… Hemlock.”  Dean tilts his head back and forth considering it.  Of all the ridiculous things this seems… good.
to indicate he knew what it meant.  He’d never even made Cas one of the bracelets before.  Sure, Cas had tried to teach him but Dean always gave up, it was Cas’ thing, not his.  “Eventually he’d looked up at me like he was about to cry, which freaked me out for a moment till he just said he was so proud of me.”
“What do we do?”  Cas’ voice was a tiny, shattered thing and John understood it.  He didn’t know how he was functioning.
“Oh what, you can’t remember all the rest of us ‘cause of that amnesia but you had a special clause put in for cars and grumpy old men?”  Some whiney teenage kid said as he tossed an oil stained rag over his shoulder.  John rolled his eyes at him.
It was billions of years from the beginning, but the humans deemed this year to be 1879.  On the far horizon to his west he could see a ship with three masts, white sails catching and billowing in the breeze, clearly passing the island just outside the barrier.  The electricity in the air dials up a notch and Castiel watches in awe as clouds begin to form.  The storm will bring the ship to the island.  This will be Castiel’s first assignment.  He will not intervene if the ship crashes, he will only intervene if the Morningstar tries to tempt one of the mortal souls.
“Do we get to choose our advantages?”  Cas asks the man and is surprised to see a look of respect cross his face.
Sam is on top of him then, pressing into his shoulders and it hurts so he grunts in pain, his brother gives him a look of apology.  Dean’s gaze just barely sees Cas standing over his legs and raising the machete in the air.  The moment Dean realizes what’s happening is just as Cas swings the blade down.  He feels every bit of it, especially when Cas has to pull back and hack through his leg a second time.  He knows he’s screaming and blissfully embraces the black when it comes.
“You don’t have to tell me about telling Cas, but it might be a better place than wherever your brain is heading now.”  Charlie piped up and Dean wanted to curse at her, but knew better.  She knew him too well.  His whole rule about not commiserating with these people, stewing in his misery, always wavered around her.  Charlie was right, thinking about the good moments with Cas always made him feel a bit bitter, even if it stirred up that ache inside of him.  Charlie wanted him to share the weight with her.
.  I intend to close that loophole and keep you here permanently.”  The Empty steepled its fingers together, watching Dean like he would make a good meal, Dean swallowed thickly.
“A bit of both.”  Coy admits, shifting his face slightly closer to hers, hot breath mixing between them.  With a concerted effort Erata pulls away off Coy’s lap and onto the free space next to him.
“I guess we were so worried about the pain none of us thought what it would feel like without pain.”  Cas said with his brow furrowed in thought, then he looks back and Dean and reaches his hand up to Dean’s cheek, caressing gently.  Dean moves into the motion like an eager cat, closing his eyes as the smallest feelings of bliss light up inside him.  “How are you feeling otherwise?”
“Oh shit, sorry.  I forget sometimes.  Umm, you used to be a youth coach.  Before the accident.  You coached a little bit of basketball and baseball, but you also helped with the ones who were on the edge of a shitty life.  If you want to try doing that again I’m sure the school would be glad to have you back.  It’s a few months off so you definitely have time to think about it.”  She watched his face for a moment but then just kept eating.  A month a whole month in this universe.  No signs of anything abnormal or deadly outside of what normal humans get up to… and here he was… finding out he’d been a damn youth coach.
“But Dean, I don’t want to go on a date right now.”  Dean made a snorting sound as Sam burst out laughing.
“Twenty five years I’ve loved you, thinking that one year could erase that is crazy, Cas.”  Dean said into Castiel’s ear and felt Cas squeeze onto him even more tightly as he burrowed his face into Dean’s neck.  When he pulled back Dean put a hand to his face, feeling the stubble and smooth skin under his fingertips, the way his own heart soared when Cas leaned into the touch.  “Especially since I’ve spent my entire queer awakening being
“Doesn’t matter to me as long as I get to keep staring at your beautiful face.”  Mary laughed as she hit him lightly in the chest.  From further in the house a door creaked open.  It made John tense, instincts still high, until a voice called out.
Dean and Castiel were married that November, surrounded by friends and family.  Castiel’s father showed even.  He was a squirrelly man named Chuck who was just as erratic as Cas had made him sound, mostly just muttering to himself about future plotlines, it was okay since he kept to himself.  His mother didn’t approve of his status in a queer relationship, nor did most of his siblings (And seriously there were seven on them).  But two did show, Gabriel and Anna.  Anna was exceptionally pleasant and well mannered… Gabriel, or Gabe as he prefered to be called, was not.  He had so much energy in such a small frame, said sexual innuendos every other sentence, and was the self described life of the party.
“Call me John.”  He managed to gruff out and they shook hands.  He needed a moment.  “I’ll be in the living room, call me when it’s ready.”  With that said he totally didn’t sulk out of the room at all.  Mary gave him a concerned look, but quickly turned her attention to their guest.
“Yes, I do.  I need to ask something of Cas.”  Jack tells them and a door appears behind him.  It’s black and ominous, but they all know where it leads.  Jack turns around and walks through the door without looking back to see if they’re following.  Dean and Cas share a look of confusion before moving forward after their son.  And if Dean grabs Cas’s hand again, then that’s nobody’s business but theirs.
“Oh at least.”  Dean tells him, then they’re just staring at each other like total idiots, Dean smiling and Cas smirking back at him keeping them in a feedback loop of happiness.  Dean squeezes their hands again which draws his gaze back to the silver ring he gave Cas the last night they were together.  Dean’s thumb fiddles with it lightly so that Cas also looks down, the memory running through both of their minds.  “I was so angry that night.”  Dean shook his head and looked away.
.”  Negan let that sink in for a moment, letting the lie marinate like the truth of a good steak which he wouldn’t be having anytime soon.  “I wasn’t scared.  I wasn’t sad.  I wasn’t angry… well…
liked him better than her own father.  “John, it sounds like you lived a whole other life in that dream.  Will you tell me about it?”  He let out a breath and nodded.
John let his heart ache, let the pain course through him because he was still alive, he needed to feel it.  Cas looked more disheveled than ever, his shirt still bloodstained from yesterday, his wild dark hair stuck up at odd ends with different smudges of dirt or blood.  Yesterday hadn’t been easy on either of them, in fact it wouldn’t be easy ever again, but Cas looked worse than that even.  As if his light had gone out.  John put a hand on his shoulder.
“Good luck brother.  And be careful.”  Then she was gone, and Castiel was alone.  His shirt catches the breeze and flaps around. He looked up to the sun and could hear birds calling in the distance.  There was no denying the beauty in his father’s creation.  He’d be lying if he said he wasn’t surprised to find it here, though.  In the cage of the infamous beast.  He supposed it would be easier to not question things if you were stuck somewhere that didn’t look like a cage.
“Look, I don’t care what your reasoning is for them.  I think they’re hilarious. Really.” Here he gives Cas a bright smile that seems to make Cas’ blue eyes look happier than Dean has ever seen him in the daylight outside the bunker.  “But Sam’s a pretty crabby kid when he’s hungover… and I don’t think he’s gonna be too happy about the delay between him and his shower.”
Barely anything in the world could have made Dean resist his urge to touch Cas in that moment, so he lets his fingers run through the soft messy hair and feels something akin to a little flame of joy flickering up his throat.  Something that sparks along his skin pleasantly as Cas gently pushes his head into the motion.  Dean feels his eyes start to water and burn, he’d never really let himself hope enough to think he’d get here.  Maybe on the days when he wanted to pretend, all he thought about was his brother and best friend still being alive, now that this was his reality it was everything.  Especially when Cas turned his face and Dean got to watch his eyes slowly peel away from sleep, his irises precisely the color of his favorite shade of blue.  He could feel himself crying now and he didn’t even care cause he knew he was also smiling.  Cas saw him and it seemed to dawn on him very suddenly cause he shot up, his eyes going wide at the sight of Dean awake.
some real humans?  Interacted with them?  Began to understand? Gadreel was sentenced to a cell for the rest of his existence for his insolence and disobedience.  That’s how the position opened up for Castiel.  (Course by the time the other angels noticed it was thousands of years later. Oops.)
“Uh… Guys?”  Jo called to Dean and Charlie, pointing toward the blockade out of the rotunda and into the amusement park.  “We didn’t set that up, right?”  She asked then pulled back to hack into the skull of another bozo approaching her.
stop the humans from entering the cage, but not many will get in overall.  I expect this job will be difficult, and I expect you’ll do it well.”  Castiel nodded again.  “Anael will take you to your new post.”  Castiel twisted around and found his sister (and commander) waiting for him.  She gave him a sad smirk and held out her hand.  He didn’t hesitate.
“So… this is where you can put your toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, soap, y’know… whatever you use in the bathroom.  Capiche?”
By the time noon had rolled around and passed, he knew something was seriously going wonky.  His entire body was tingling like there was something in the air though he mainly sat next to Mary reading quietly so he could hear if she woke up.  At 2:30 he received a call from Sam that made his stomach drop.
“I forgot about them.  How the HELL did I forget about my own brother?!”  Dean rounds on Coy furiously. “What the fuck did you do to me?”
“Donna!  We need to get everyone else over here or we’re gonna lose this whole sector.”  She had the anger of a concerned mother as she swung her machete around.
Both Gabe and another man named Balthasar were Cas’ groomsmen.  Dean had elected for Charlie, his best friend, and of course Sam.  Mary told him Dean had been in his brother’s wedding as well, John was sad he couldn’t have experienced that day himself.  But Mary promised to show him pictures and videos when they got home.
“I can’t lose you either.  Please.”  They’re breathing in each other’s air, Dean let’s his forehead fall to Cas’ as his eyes fall shut focusing on drowning out Micheal.  He nods, moving Cas’ head with his.
“That night, I snuck out of my house.  Don’t know how I wasn’t caught.  I scaled up the side of Cas’ house and got him out of bed.”  Dean chuckled softly to himself.  “He always had the worst bed head.  He looked at me so confused, but Cas he… always trusted me.  So he got out of bed, put his swimsuit on and we went back to the creek.”  Dean closed his eyes, and he could just see it.  Though the memory was more than two decades old.  The stars had been so clear that night, they reflected in Cas’ eyes which were a nicer shade than that of the creek.  The air had felt crisp without being cool.  They were warm with the adrenaline of sneaking out which made their smiles especially bright every time they glanced at each other.  Young enough that they could still hold hands because they didn’t yet know how society felt about that.
“Shut up idiot, what if Dad is sleeping?  He’s still in recovery y’know.”  There were some scuffling noises.
my choices as your wife.”  Mary told him firmly.  That drew John up short, because she was always right, she deserved his respect and his trust.  If she said she wanted to do this alone, he had to give that to her. Mary sighed and passed him his cellphone.  “Go call the boys, tell them to come visit me ‘cause I’m bored and they’re not gonna let me out anytime soon.”  John nodded and leaned in to kiss his wife.
.  He tells himself, letting out a breath slowly he meets Cas eyes.  “What you want, Cas.”  Dean’s eyebrows squeeze together as he searches Cas’s eyes.  He has to get this out here, now.  “You can have it.  Always could have.  I just didn’t think you… were able to… feel-... like this.”  Dean gestures between the two of them, his heart thundering loudly in his chest.  Cas is watching him carefully, he tilts his head but Dean sees humour in his eyes.
“Idjits.  The lot of ya-”  John chose that moment to pass Lucy to Bobby, which softened the gruff old man’s tone.  “Except you, little one.  I’m still undecided on you.  Could be the smartest Winchester yet.”  It was always in these moments that John found himself reaching for Mary, he reached for her a lot as is, but these moments when his heart filled his chest to the fullest point he just needed her, so they could share it.  But this time she gave him a look then swiftly darted her eyes between their two sons.  He nodded his head acquiescing and stepping towards Sam.
“Sam? Sam!”  He didn’t answer.  “Sam, you need to get out of there and come here.  But be careful it might not be safe outside.”  There were more screams cut out by crackling, then the line went dead.  “SAM!” John shouted, furious he hung up the phone muttering to himself.  “This can’t be happening.  This was my chance.  This was
“We’re warning you bud, you’ve picked the wrong guys to mess with.”  Dean calls out, looking up at the ceiling wildly searching for the source of the voice.
“Now I understand.  Why you’ve been looking at me like a man lost in the desert just found water.  I get it though. I thought I lost you.  This past year I didn’t have much hope, no one did.  There was a semi… it hit the broadside of the Impala with you and the boys inside.  You hit your head pretty hard but Dean had the worst injuries.  He and Sam were both in the hospital with you for a while and it was like my whole world just fell apart.  Sam managed to get on his feet the next day but Dean… He...He flatlined a few times.  It ripped me open, I don’t know how Sam managed to hold it together for both of us, but he did.  Dean eventually pulled through.  Sam and I just kept switching whose bedside we were at.  Then after about a month Dean was healed enough to go home. Sam and Dean’s friends took care of him so I didn’t have to choose who to worry about.  But you… were just a big sleeping pile of nothing.  They said you’d probably never wake up.”  John couldn’t take it anymore. Her eyes had started to water and nothing hurt more than seeing her like this.  He pulled her in close again. Kissed the top of her head, every inch of her face he could reach.  He felt her breathing even out and she slowly sat up again, but she grabbed his hands just to stay as close as possible.  “Tell me more about this monster hunting.”
“You’ll pull through this Mary.  That’s why we named our daughter after you, you’re the strongest woman I’ve ever met.”  Jess leaned in then and Mary hugged her back easily.  Next to them John’s heart was breaking, he could feel the old him creeping out of hiding where he’d carefully tucked him away.  He didn’t want to be jaded, or vengeful.  Not like he could physically fight the cancer anyway.  He wanted to be the best man possible for his wife up until the day she died.  That was what he had promised himself once he realized he got to have
the Rainbow Bridge.  I’ve got a whole task force being set up now devoted to tracking down the lost souls of pets.  Apparently Chuck didn’t find them important.”
“Can’t get rid of me that fast, sunshine.”  And he flashed Cas a smile, Cas just sighed at his husband.
When he returned to his camp that night, covered in gore and smelling absolutely vile, Charlie approached him practically vibrating with excitement.
“I tried to save, Sammy.  But he was already one of those when I got there.  I didn’t know what to do and he…”  Dean trailed off, winced and coughed roughly, blood dribbled down his chin.
“I’m never gonna get tired of giving you ‘heart eyes’ or compliments or just love in general.  I told you, it felt like 145 years without you.”  John hobbled away from her by placing hands on the counter, then turned to look at the space.  It was just a mud room but he still got that annoying sting coming to his eyes.  Mary turned her curious eyes on her husband.
For the purposes of this fic, Cas will essentially be filling Richard’s role.  Which means we’ll have a very different Cas by the time the flight crashes.  Everything that happens before Richard/Ricardo’s arrival, is what Jacob and MiB believe to be true.  (In the playlist that is videos 1-15)  I hope you enjoy this crossover!
“Then the wish doesn’t come true.”  Dean tells her without looking up, his chest feels like it’s caving in.  “I don’t know what Cas’ wish was, so I can only hope it was a good one since this one has been on my wrist since we were 17.  He’d given me others since then, but this one is the stubborn one.”
“You’ll be fine, kid.  Just keep my son happy and I’ll have no issue.  You ever break his heart and I will hunt you down.”  Cas sat there just gaping at him.
The blackness isn’t complete.  Sometimes voices float to him across the dark.  Things about blood loss, his mother worrying, Charlie just talking to him.  There are sensations too, mainly of someone holding his hand, sometimes gentle fingers on his face, and these pin and needle sensations coming from his left foot.  But his eyes don’t open, so he squeezes back the hand and wiggles his toes when he can.  He doesn’t know how long the darkness lasts, just that without preamble it suddenly seems to end.
“Shut up.”  He snaps as he shoves Cas against the wall, their bodies pressing together.  Dean puts his face in orbit of Cas’s.   Just hovering over his lips in the breaths before something potentially life changing.  Even more so than what had transpired in the last week.  Their heated and mingled breaths are a choice down a wooded path not traveled by most Winchester’s, and certainly not many angels.  Two roads diverged, like two lips parted, and Dean was gonna fucking choose the one he deserved.  Cas made him see that.  Cas whose nose he bumped lightly with his own.  Whose hands had grabbed his hips and were holding him both there.  “You know what I mean.”  Dean breathed into the air between them.  Cas’s eyelids fluttered closed and he sucked in a breath.
The boys tried to distract them, chattering about the news.  Things were going a bit crazy on the coasts.  Some new drug was making people act like rabid dogs.  Dean just brushed it off, but Sam was more concerned especially when towards the end of October reports were coming in from Houston of the same thing.  John really didn’t give a fuck, all his attention was on Mary’s few waking hours, which were fewer and farther between.  It drained him, all the background chatter, but he appreciated what they were trying to do.
“I spent a whole year thinking you might be dead and that you’d never know that I love you.”  Cas told him, Dean looked at him in awe as his green eyes watered over and he started crying too.
“Mm, smells delicious mom.  Thank you for having us over.”  Mary was setting the dish on the center island when John walked into the kitchen, she gave him a stern warning glance.  He knew exactly what that meant as he gazed around the room, he heard some scuffling from the mud room.
After all, you’re gonna be a dad soon.”   A mischievous glint came to Dean’s eyes and Mary spoke up before he could put the plan into action.
“It’s weird, I can’t tell if the apocalypse has made me better at therapizing my friends, or if our problems are just more obvious now that we’re all colored similar shades of trauma.”  Charlie said with a bit of a hiccup.  They were on a gathering mission and had stumbled upon a full bottle of
“OH you’re running things now?!  You’re gonna tell us what we can and can’t do with our women?  Fuck you man!”  The idiot jumped him, and it wasn’t the attack that surprised him, it was how he went for his neck that threw him off balance and into the pile of barbwire.  It hurt like a bitch, made Negan grunt in pain but this wouldn’t fucking continue anymore.  Even as his skin split open as easily as you’d crush a tomato he sprung into action.  His bat sat against the wall behind him.  Both him and this disgusting fuck reached for it, but of course Negan got there first and swung it into his fucking skull.  He didn’t stop there though, he kept going, just how his skin had sliced and broke apart so did what little kept him from the pure rage inside him about this fucking world.  He noticed a few men of this other group started to approach him, weapons wielded.
“We could see anyone coming from a long way away.  We also camouflaged the hell out of it.  Cas was a genius, he figured out how to get these vines to grow over and around it so we didn’t have to use fake ones.  He had the idea to use a rope ladder instead of one nailed to a tree, and I figured out this way to rig it up to the base of the fort, that way we could hide a string that would unravel it for easy access.”
“This life… it’s all very… slow.  I can’t just ‘zap’ myself clean. Showering takes five minutes if you hurry, but half an hour if you want to enjoy it.  You get hungry and it takes time to cook the food, let alone eat it. You need to relieve yourself and that also takes time.  Sleeping is supposed to take up one third of your day.” He pauses again, then looks right at Dean once more. “Time has never moved slower for me.  I can feel every moment. So to find something that can bring even a small modicum of that… instantaneous world back into my life, I welcome it.” His lips turn up slightly at the corner, as if he is content with all he has said.  Dean smiles at him.
