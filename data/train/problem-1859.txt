She nodded. "Okay."
“It could be,” John argued.
"Did they find something?" John asked. He didn't even try to pull away from Sherlock's grasp.
"First of all, Sherlock, you are a guy," John replied. "You know you are and so do I. If anyone ever tries to tell you different, they're idiots and not worth your time"
John is quite skilled in bed it turns out and he's attractive and he's his best friend and Sherlock is in love with him. He feels happier than he has in so long.
"No," Sherlock replies simply, not even looking at him.
"Whatever," He said, pretending to hate it so that his parents didn't get the satisfaction of winning.
John stared at him with wide eyes. "That's amazing! How do you know all if that?"
"That's okay," John said. "We don't need them." He had kicked off his shoes and was taking his shorts off, leaving him only in a pair of blue boxers.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock could only keep apologizing and hope it worked eventually.
"Well... I need a date for my work Christmas party."
“Yes, it’s true,” Sherlock insisted. “Just because you failed to notice, doesn’t make it untrue. Maybe your powers of deduction are slipping, dear brother. It’s probably your old age.”
“What time did you meet up?”
"Shut up!" Sherlock never wanted to hear another word from his sorry excuse for a brother.
"What? Why?"
Sherlock did go to sleep but first he reached for his cell phone to send a text message to Mycroft. ‘Sex does not alarm me anymore.’
Mary just smiled and nodded at him.
Sherlock doesn’t hesitate. He gets into position obediently.
Sherlock waved his hand in a dismissive gesture. “Forget it,” he sighed. “Forget I said anything.”
John chuckled. "You like it. Admit it."
“I know,” John said, nodding. “I’m prepared.”
"Why?"
Sherlock then spotted his brother in the distance pacing and talking on his phone.
Sherlock silently shook his head no.
"She was good at convincing people that she was someone else. And you loved her. People do say love is blind."
Sherlock knew that wasn’t true. Who wouldn’t want John? Not only was he handsome but he was amazing and perfect in every single way. Sherlock had always hated other people. They were all idiots. But not John.
"I have a surprise for you," John announced.
"He's still your brother. You don't really hate him."
John’s lips were surprisingly softer than he’d imagined they would be. He braced himself for John to push him away, but he didn’t. Instead John was kissing him back.
"I never intended-"
“How much money? What time?” Sherlock questioned.
John looked confused at first then he chuckled. "Sure."
'It turns me on too. I'm hard. Send me some sexy pictures.'
By the time Sherlock' s parents invited them inside for lunch, they had both sufficiently cooled off. They ate sandwiches and drank lemonade while Mycroft glared at them skeptically. John was in such a good mood he didn't seem to notice that he was being analyzed.
He answered it quickly. “What do you want?” he snapped.
“You’re perfect,” Sherlock told him.
"Sherlock," John waved at him cheerfully.
It was chilly as John sat on the bench with his old friend Mike. He wrapped his scarf around his neck, pulling his jacket tighter around him.
"You're not making any sense. What possible reason could you have for me to not live with my wife?"
"I wouldn't want to disturb your domestic bliss," Sherlock snapped angrily.
She stared at Sherlock for a long moment, then smiled at John. "I'm so happy for you. Merry Christmas."
John had earned that scar in a fight. Sherlock was outside a bar late one night, a little drunk, and as usual he didn't know when to keep his deductions to himself. The strong tattooed stranger hadn't taken so kindly to being told his fiance was cheating on him. John, ever the loyal best friend, had stepped between him and the stranger and attempted to diffuse the situation. The stranger was aggressive and violent and he tried to hit Sherlock. John protected him, instantly jumping into action. For defending Sherlock and his foolishness, he was left with a permanent mark. It was a permanent reminder that Sherlock had fucked up and gotten his friend hurt. It was a permanent reminder of what happened when you got too close to Sherlock Holmes.
"I can't," is all Sherlock says. He covers his face with his hands.
John puts a hand on his shoulder in an attempt to comfort him. He doesn't find it comforting though. It makes his heart beat faster.
"That I'm in love with you!" Something snaps inside John as he shouts his revelation. He pushes Sherlock back against the nearest wall and kisses him.
Sherlock frowned. "Its not romantic. That's stupid."
John smiled. “Okay.”
“Stop saying that. You don’t mean it.”
John gave him a few good strokes and Sherlock went wild. He couldn’t control himself. He was exploding. John saw him tense like he was trying to fight it.
"You're such an ass," John complained but he was chuckling a little as he said it. "Sometimes I don't know why I put up with you."
They took a walk together in the woods, discussing the case and sweating in the summer sun, spending time alone together to keep up the charade of being a couple.
“John, I- “ he tried to say.
"Which girlfriend?"
"Your boyfriend has probably run away," Sherlock told the girl.
"What's going on with you?"
Sherlock looked away quickly, and when he looked again John was already in the water up to his waist. His back was to Sherlock as he said "The water feels great! Hurry up and get in!"
'It was,' he agreed. 'I'm glad you had fun.'
John deepened the kiss and his hands tangled in Sherlock' s curls. "Oh..." Sherlock gasped slightly as John gave a gentle tug to his hair and it felt surprisingly good. John nipped playfully at the detective' s bottom lip before pulling back, smiling like he was proud of himself for the whole display.
A woman aged 29 with short Brown hair was found dead in the woods by a local man on his way to go fishing. She wore a ripped scarf, a pink coat unbuttoned to reveal a blue blouse, a short denim skirt, and one broken high heeled shoe.
The woman's eyes momentarily widened, caught off guard. She sighed, shifting in a way that made her seem nervous. "Sure, come on inside."
"She is," John insisted, completely serious. "Everyone knows it."
Sherlock recognized the name of the boy who’s mother they’d spoken to already.
"I mean this, brother," he insisted. And he threw himself at Mycroft, punching him hard. It was incredibly satisfying to feel his fist crashing into his older brother's face. Before he could hit him a second time, John had inserted himself between them. His arms went around Sherlock, pulling him away. As he was dragged off by John, he got a glimpse of his brother wiping blood from the corner of his mouth.
She nodded, forcing a small appreciative smile. "Thank you. I know he's out there somewhere. I haven't lost hope."
"What do you mean?" John asked, confused at what they had done to upset the other man.
"I am focusing," John insisted. "Why can't it be the landlord?"
"What exactly was your relationship with Braden?"
Finally they pulled the fish up out of the water. It was just a little fish with a spiky fin on its back. Not very impressive, but John was thrilled.
John has never seen him this depressed before. He momentarily considers calling Mycroft but decides against it, fearing that it may only make the situation worse.
He expected John to pull away but he didn’t. In fact he sighed contentedly. “That feels nice,” he said.
John made the tea, thoughts racing. He sat down on the couch with Sherlock and they both sipped their tea quietly.
“You’re gonna’ make me cum,” John slurred. “Sorry.” He turned over on his back, cock dripping precum steadily like a leaky faucet. It was fascinating. Sherlock wasn’t sure why John would apologize for such a thing. “It’s been a while since I’ve done this.”
“I have some work that I require your assistance with,” he told his brother. “I’ll see you later, John.” He waved to John and tried to usher Mycroft upstairs.
"What-" Before John could ask anymore questions, Mycroft hung up.
John had been happy for him when he'd run to him and announced that he'd been asked on a date. Jim was a little older than him, a freshman in college. They'd met at a bookstore of all places, Sherlock buying books for pleasure and Jim picking up a text book for a school report. He'd never been on a date and could barely believe that it was actually happening. He'd been honest with Jim, let him know that he was transgender. And Jim hadn't seemed to mind.
John does as he’s told, letting Sherlock adjust. John is only halfway inside Sherlock and it’s a struggle to stay still.
John liked torturing him. “You’re hard,” he said. “I can feel it… I can feel how much you want me… how much I turn you on. You can’t hide it. Do you touch yourself and imagine it’s my hand stroking you?”
“Do you have condoms?” John asked.
Sherlock didn't say anything, just pulled John close and kissed him. John was in shock.
Officials including state and local police and the fire department, game wardens, and civilian volunteers had been searching the woods to no avail.
“I can’t believe I did this,” John said.
"Wear something comfortable," John advised.
"Why the hell are you kissing him?" Lestrade demanded.
After a few minutes, John said "I don't want to interrupt your train of thought, but-"
"but you'll take the case? you think something else could have happened to him?"
They hadn't seen any article so Lestrade gave them the web address, waiting while they looked it up. The article was written by a crime blogger and there was a picture of them at the crime scene this afternoon, clearly taken from quite a distance. They were just visible enough to see John kissing Sherlock's cheek. The headline for the article said 'World Famous Detective and Partner share a kiss while investigating murder.'
“This is for the best,” Sherlock attempted to reassure John. If only he could erase Mary from John’s memory completely.
“Sorry doesn’t cover this! Are you insane?”
They all sat and had a family meal, much to Sherlock’s displeasure. Mycroft didn’t look too happy either. He frowned a lot and kept looking skeptically at John. It was actually quite rude but John seemed unaffected by it, probably used to Mycroft’s attitude by now. Mycroft was always analyzing him since the start. John understood this to be protectiveness. Mycroft loved his brother more than anything and Sherlock often times did require people to look out for him. This was not a fact that Sherlock himself would like to admit. Instead he passed his older brother’s behavior off as annoying and unnecessary.
“Are you sure you’re ready for all this?” John asked him.
Sherlock rested his chin on his fingers, thinking. "Interesting."
But then he received a picture as well. He opened the message and saw a picture of John in his own boxer briefs. His hard thick dick was peeking out the waistband of his boxers and a hand was wrapped around it.
"What's happening?" Sherlock asked, turning to John.
"Sherlock," John scolded him, releasing his hand
He tried his best to focus on the cases, but he kept worrying about John too much to focus on anything else.
John tugged once more at Sherlock’s curls and Sherlock groaned helplessly into the kiss, rocking his hips against John’s in attempt to create friction.
He expected the other boy to take the chair and go sit with his friends but instead he sat with him at his table. He smiled at him and it nearly took Sherlock's breath away. He was extremely handsome.
When Sherlock awoke in the morning, he was surprised to find he wasn't at home and that there was someone sleeping beside him. He quickly remembered that he was on this awful family vacation and that he and John were pretending to be lovers in order to appease his parents. He groaned and rolled onto his side, gazing at John.
"That could have meant anything. It might not have even been true. It could have just been another line to get you in his bed."
He paused once he was inside Sherlock, groaning with pleasure.
“Yes,” Sherlock confirmed. “Would you help me? We could think of it like an experiment.”
"What was his name?" Sherlock asked. "Can you provide a description of the man?"
"We'll go back now," Sherlock decided, leaving no room for argument. "My parents will understand."
Hearing his name, John moved closer to be in view, wrapping an arm around Sherlock. "I'm here."
He took his time getting into the lake while John dove right in. The water was chilly on his warm skin and soft mud squished under his feet unpleasantly as he waded in up to his waist.
John instantly wanted to hear more. He rocked his hips against Sherlock’s and nipped at Sherlock’s neck. “John!” Sherlock gasped.
John smirks and leans in closer. "What did it make you feel, Sherlock?"
"I don't have to do anything."
Sherlock felt sick at the mention of Mary. "Im not hungry anymore."
"You idiot!" She called out to him. "Don't you realize I never loved you? No one will ever love you, Sherlock Holmes."
Sherlock wasn’t sure. Romanticism was something that he struggled with. His relationship with Irene had been unique. He wasn’t sure what might convince his family that he and John were happily involved as lovers. Mycroft would especially be difficult to convince. John was probably more experienced in the ways of being romantic and dating rituals. “We must act like we’re in love,” he said simply.
“I’m working on it,” he replied.
"Are you finished interrupting?" Sherlock asked. "I have important work to do."
That makes John take a step back and suddenly Sherlock can breathe again.
“We’d have to think up a whole story, about when and how we started dating. All of those details. Or it wouldn’t be believable.”
Molly was concerned now. "Whats wrong? What do you need?"
Suddenly John slid all the way inside and Sherlock gasped. “Fuck… John…”
Sherlock instinctively leaned into the kiss, returning it without hesitation even though he had no idea what he was doing. This really was not his area of expertise. John didn't seem to notice.
"Have you taken anything today, Sherlock?" John asks him.
John gazed out at the lake, shielding his eyes from the sun with his hand. "Come swimming with me," he said.
"You're hard," Sherlock stated.
Sherlock glared at him. "Go be with Mary."
"Because of this." Sherlock handed him his phone and the message he had received from Mycroft this morning.
John collapsed beside him as they both struggled to catch their breath. Finally John sat up and faced his friend.
"Any minute now she'll be at the door wearing a pink dress and a scarf in her hair, those big sunglasses she's so fond of. She thinks they make her look like a movie star but I find them a bit ridiculous, too big for her face really."
"I didn't want you to."
The girl shrugged. "Pretty often. I guess about once a week."
Sherlock could not be sure what the day would contain in the morning but for now he did his best to get some sleep. He found that sleep came surprisingly easy, exhausted from the interaction with his family.
Sherlock took his time drying off and dressing, dreading the conversation. He sat on their bed while John paced back and forth in front of him. John always seemed to come a little unhinged at times like these, when Sherlock seemed to be spiraling out of control.
"I know it's not," Sherlock replied with a completely serious expression.
“John!” Sherlock shouted as he came.
He’d rushed out of 221B quickly after the hand job. Not many words were exchanged. He’d kissed Sherlock and left him a mess on the couch.
At least John seemed to be in a better mood on the way back to the cabin, effectively distracted from his misery by the case. “What’s your plan now?” he asked Sherlock.
They had been shown a copy of the text message that the missing boy had sent about an hour after he'd supposedly left to go fishing. It read 'I fell and I think my ankle's twisted.'
They would have to take her word for it.
“John?” he asked.
"I know. I love you too."
John's first instinct was to ignore the ringing phone.
Sherlock kissed him back this time. John’s tongue slipped into Sherlock’s mouth and he groaned into the kiss. It was all frustration and aggression and lust. He nipped at Sherlock’s bottom lip and Sherlock made a quiet breathless sound in response.
"Are you kidding me?" John demanded. "Where dis you even find drugs in the middle of nowhere? You're unbelievable."
He had to fix this. She was too good for him. She deserved better. And the last thing he wanted to do was lead her on. He valued her friendship and she needed to know that.
She laughed.
John nods. After a moment, curiosity gets the best of him. “Do you want to have sex?”
“God, you look so good like this,” John said.
It meant everything to him to know that John would cancel on Mary in order to stay with him. But he had a new plan in mind that would fix everything once and for all. Going into his mind palace had solved his dilemma.
“Can we perhaps… do this again sometime? For more practice?”
Sherlock was starting to get hard again already. All of the time he deprived his body of what it craved, now his desire was unstoppable.
There were so many of them, flying around lazily and lighting up. It looked like magic, like a scene from a movie. Sherlock found it oddly enchanting.
"Its the least I can do after forcing you to swim with me. Don't make everything so difficult."
“Mary…”
Sherlock shrugged. "Didn't notice."
"Whatever is going on between you and John Watson, I am confident that you two will work it out," Mycroft said, surprising Sherlock. Was he actually trying to be nice? "You and John are... you make good partners."
It was something Sherlock had known since he was a small child but he never had a name for it until middle school when he discovered the internet. He realized that it was real condition and that he wasn't the only one in the world who felt that way. He felt relieved but also anxious. He went to John and cried on his shoulder. It hadn't been the only time he cried to John.
“I’m sorry.” Sherlock didn’t know what else to say, how to fix this. He probably deserved this.
“Oh…” Sherlock breathed.
"Why can't you be nicer to her? She just wanted to talk."
After their conversation with Eliza May, they spoke with a deputy officer and the morgue. They reviewed crime scene photos and autopsy reports. By the time they arrived back at the cabin, it was time for dinner. John dug into his steaks and potatoes without hesitation, starved after a busy day with no time to eat.
"I have to leave. Something important. I trust that my brother is in good hands?"
His heart began to race. "A murder?" This vacation just got a lot more exciting. "They haven't caught the killer?"
Sherlock answered honestly. "Not as bad as I thought."
"Stop doing that," John complained.
"It's a little fast, don't you think? I mean, do you always move this fast?"
Boyfriends… it was so strange to hear that term but he would have to get used to it. He didn’t think his parents would question it too much. They knew that he and John spent almost every moment together since they’d met. They liked John very much. And they knew that Sherlock identified as pansexual. He was attracted to people for who they were rather than their gender, something he’d figured out as a teenager and discussed openly with his family who were fortunately supportive. They wanted him to be happy and thought that it would take a romantic partner to make him happy. It was silly. But he would let them believe that he’d found what they wanted him to find. It was easier than arguing about it all the time.
"I'm wonderful, Mary," He said. "But now that You mention it, we really are quite busy. We must be going." He wasn't going to tell her anything and let her get involved in their lives again or allow her to use him for information.
“Ah!” Sherlock shuddered.
The teenager they were there to see was not home but his mother was. She wore a striped tank top and short red shorts with a pair of dollar store flip flop sandals. Her wavy blond hair had recently been dyed and was pulled back into a ponytail. Her red lipstick matched the chipped paint on her fingernails, no wedding ring. She was younger than Sherlock expected, late 30's maybe meaning she'd become a mother as a teenager herself.
"That's not-" John started to try to defend himself.
"You deserve better than Jim," John insisted. "You can find someone better. Someone else would be happy to have you. You're an amazing person. I know that because I wouldn't be your best friend if you weren't."
He tried to step around the girl but she wasn't having it. She moved to block his path. Though she was much shorter than him, she didn't let it stop her from standing up to the detective. "He didn't run away!" She insisted. "You're the only one who can find him. You have to help."
He fell asleep, thinking of all the things he would try doing with John the next day and how perfect John felt snuggled in his arms.
“I’ll tell my parents that simply decided we’re better off staying friends.”
Sherlock's older brother approached, studying John.
Today is John Watson’s wedding day.
This was part of what he despised about her. She liked him for some reason and was inexplicably determined to be friends with him. She was actually quite intelligent but she had a complicated history of lying and manipulating people. It made him distrust her, but it was also part of what probably attracted John to her in the first place. He knew the truth though. Mary was no good for John. She was bad news and it was best to stay as far away from her as possible.
John was still hesitant to leave him until Mycroft showed up.
“I have,” John answered. “I’ve been with men and women.”
He pulled back a bit and gave a smile that melted something inside Sherlock. “You look good,” John said.
He tried taking care of himself quickly in the shower. He had to bite his lip to keep quiet, his growing cock more sensitive than it had ever been. The thoughts of John made him hornier than ever. He tried to think about other things, other men and women, but his focus would inevitably return to John. Maybe it was because they lived together and it was the close proximity that caused it.
“I wasn’t aware that you were interested in men,” Sherlock’s father said to John.
"It's a nice instrument?" John said it like a question, confused by this rather odd conversation.
It was late at night and John stood in the flat that he had once shared with Sherlock. He was so angry. “This is all your fault!” he shouted. “You ruined my life. I will never forgive you, Sherlock. I hate you.”
"What is it?" He asked.
John only hesitated for a moment. “Do you want to?”
In the morning they went out in search of information. John ate a bagel while Sherlock drove the rental car because they had rushed out the door and Sherlock had shouted "There's no time for breakfast, John! There's a murderer on the loose!"
“Why me?” John asked. “Why not ask someone else?”
John kisses him and this time it's clearly much more than a friendly kiss. There's a heat to it that makes Sherlock moan against John's lips.
"Sherlock," John said, a warning to back off, that he was crossing a line.
Sherlock didn't get a chance to question John about this plan. Mycroft was walking back into the dining room now for dessert.
They spent the day eating, exchanging gifts, making pleasant conversation, and listening to Sherlock play Christmas songs on his violin.
It was around noon and Sherlock and John were sitting together in a canoe. The lake was still and the sun shone brightly. John wiped a little sweat off his forehead with his hand. He made a pained face, tilting his head to hide it from Sherlock. But the detective saw it anyway because he always saw everything and he knew John very well by now.
"A sunfish," he said. "Its your first time fishing and you actually caught one!"
"Yes."
This vacation was turning into a nightmare. Not only had Mary returned, he had failed to solve the case. No justice had been served. He was a failure, too distracted by his parents and his fake relationship with John. He didn't feel like a great detective at all. He just wanted to go home and drown himself in the strongest alcoholic beverage he could find.
John sighed. "I didn't really think about it. What will you be telling your family?"
Sherlock stared at John with wide eyes, silent.
"Bees made a nest inside this tree."
When he awoke the next morning he found John sleeping peacefully, an arm thrown around Sherlock's waist. The detective couldn't help but smile.
“High functioning sociopath,” Sherlock automatically corrected.
"Do you hate me?"
John's lips were suddenly pressed against his own. John was kissing him. He realized after a moment that he better kiss back if they wanted to make this believable.
John doesn’t have to be told twice. He thrusts all the way inside and groans quietly at how good it feels to finally be inside Sherlock.
“Mary Morstan.”
“No,” John said firmly. “I wouldn’t think that. I… understand why you’d want to do this. And it’s not a completely crazy idea. It might actually work.”
"You're a good, doctor," Sherlock said, relaxing back against the pillows.
"I'll punch them."
"How are you today," Molly asked him.
Sherlock gazed at his crime solving partner and best friend. He couldn’t imagine a better man to have by his side every day. “I know,” he agreed. He was indeed very lucky.
"Let's reel it in. I'll help you." John stood behind him, his chest against Sherlock's back, arms going around him and covering his own to help him reel in his line.The hook felt heavy as they slowly dragged it through the water towards the dock. Sherlock' s heart raced with excitement. He told himself he was excited about the fish and not by John's arms around him.
Sherlock shook his head. "Just Irene."
John starts out slow but his cautious rhythm doesn’t last long. “Flip over,” he urges Sherlock suddenly, pulling out of him temporarily. “On your hands and knees.”
“Yeah, well, you aren’t the first to make that assumption,” John admitted, irritation clear in his tone. “He’s my best friend, but that’s as far as it goes. He doesn’t do relationships.”
When they finally caught the taxi Sherlock quickly deduced it wasn’t their murderer and with a quirky “Welcome to London!” thrown at the traveler, they promptly raced back to Baker Street and collapsed against the wall of the landing in hysterical giggles. John’s blood was singing in his veins at the thrill of it all. The mad dash through London following Sherlock Holmes was the happiest he had been since he had been shot.
Sherlock scowled. “Fine, take me to Bart’s,” he picked as he figured he might be able to convince Molly to let him do something in the lab.
“About how often I touch my face.”
“I knew he dated a few people while you were away,” she replied hesitantly.
John blinked and nodded at the appropriate times, or what he thought were the appropriate times, as he let his landlady prattle on the way she did whether he was paying attention or not. He was content enough to let her. She didn’t require him to respond verbally and it was a relationship that worked well for the both of them since Sherlock’s fall. She talked, and he listened, and they drank tea or played cards games that she always won and John was convinced that she was counting cards or something because there was no way someone just won that often.
John’s hands came up and cradled his face as their eyes locked, inches away from each other. John stood in the vee of his legs and the warmth of his body seeped into the thin layer of his trousers and spread through to his own body. The doctor’s eyes were intense on his, the dark blue nearly black in his arousal, and Sherlock closed his eyes in an effort to calm his body.
“John, I want you to fuck me,” Sherlock said, his voice like gravel, and John bit down a moan into the skin of Sherlock’s neck, feeling the man arch into him, and he licked over the spot to soothe it.
“I find it somewhat insulting that you think I need you there to keep me alive,” Sherlock sniffed.
“How, indeed?”
“An enemy,” John corrected himself, and Sherlock relaxed back into the couch.
John turned his attention back to his friend, who was tearing off bits of the bread and dragging it through the tomato sauce on his plate before eating.
“Let’s find a Christmas film, at least.”
“There’s our man,” he said quietly. “Taxi. Clever. Why is that clever?”
John felt his mouth as it opened slightly under the feeling of Sherlock’s thumb as it trailed under his bottom lip again.
John smiled and sat down at the table across from his landlady. She poured them both mugs before he had a chance to pour for them, and he thanked her before he drank his tea and picked a biscuit.
John tied his dressing gown tighter around himself, no longer able to ignore the chill in the flat, as he crossed to his armchair and sat down across from his not-dead flatmate and former friend.
John stared down at the rather sad little list on his kitchen table. He had written down everyone he needed to buy gifts for and clearly, it had been a waste of paper and ink. It wasn’t as if he really needed to write a list down, as he was hardly going to forget to buy for such a small amount of people. His co-workers would all be getting chocolates from the little specialty store he had stumbled upon while out with Joy the week before and Harry, as well, actually. He felt a brief tug of guilt at putting his sister on the same level as his co-workers, so he added a mental note to spend more on her gift than theirs to assuage that misplaced guilt.
John had said he wasn’t sure about taking the room and that was unacceptable. He needed John to take the room. So, he would show John that him taking the room was a good decision. He climbed back up the stairs and back into the flat.
He would have to pay her back. He hadn’t planned on getting a tree, but then, he hadn’t the last year either. One had turned up then, too.
Sherlock was fascinating and charming, but they weren’t friends. He didn’t owe him anything. He barely knew him, which seemed to be a good thing at the moment, because there was nothing he could tell this man since he really didn’t know.
The small pile of sea glass that Rosie and Sherlock had collected caught his attention as it lay on the table. He walked over and picked out the piece that sparked the whole collection. The opaque azure glass was a decent size, perfect for rubbing between his thumb and index finger, which was exactly what he did while he waited for the water to boil. The cloudy glass was cool and light in his fingers, and he let his thoughts drift back to Sherlock’s bedtime routine with Rosie. The ease and simplicity that he told Rosie he loved her, the sincerity in the statement. He found himself momentarily fantasizing that the words were meant for him, instead. It was a selfish, dangerous thought, and he only held on to it for a moment, before banishing it away.
When John was done asking his questions and writing the answers, he put down his pen and looked up at the two of them.
John felt himself deflate. The anger, the hurt, even the love he felt for Sherlock, it all faded away and left him desolate. He pulled out a kitchen chair and fell into it. Joy rested her head in his lap as soon as he settled and he absently scratched her ears. Across from him, Sherlock carefully pulled out the other chair and sat down.
When he returned less than two hours later, just as John was ordering a pizza for their dinner because there was no way he wanted to cook in this heat, he briefly wondered what on earth he had done in his life that justified Sherlock as punishment.
“No. Absolutely not. Lose my number,” she instructed, practically pushing the two men out of the room. “I hope you two will be happy together!” she yelled after them, and then followed the pronouncement with a solid slamming of her door.
He took a deep breath and turned back to his computer, typing into the search bar for flights. He didn’t have much money to spend, but he needed out of the country, just for the holiday, and then he could return. He found the cheapest flight he could find, not even caring where it went, and bought a roundtrip ticket right then.
He saw it out of the corner of his eye and felt his legs come to a stop without his permission. The quiet black car pulled up to him and came to a stop. John breathed hard through his nose, his muscles tensing as he felt waves of aggression and anger crash through him, his hands automatically forming fists at his sides.
“John,” he says, eyes opening, and John sees the desire clear in that gaze. Desire, and something softer, something deeper.
“One fantasy I have involves you on your knees, right here in our living room.” Sherlock’s voice is low, deeper than John had ever heard it before, and John felt his body respond to the voice as much as the image the words created.
The four walls of his tiny London bedsit felt like they were closing in on him. He was suffocating in the sea of beige and emptiness. The mobile his sister had given him when he was forced to return home from his tour in Afghanistan sat quiet on the stand beside his bed. It never rang. Never pinged a text. The only person who had the number was his sister, and after she did her “duty” of visiting after his return, she never called. Just left him the phone and walked back out of his life. They were never really close, and nearly dying in the desert sands hadn’t changed anything. Not that he expected it to.
“Which one?”
He opened his mouth to say something, he wasn’t sure what, but then Sherlock stepped impossibly closer, crowding him under the water. His large hands came up to cradle John’s face and their eyes locked. Neither spoke, just breathed, or didn’t breathe, John wasn’t sure, he was getting dizzy from the heat of the shower and the rush of emotions that had collided in him earlier, and now he was standing under the water with Sherlock on the wrong side of the curtain, but no, it was the side he needed to be on, right now, to know that he was alive and well and the blood that had bloomed on his throat earlier was gone, washed away, and no, he was sure now, he definitely wasn’t breathing.
“Yes.”
“Jesus, Sherlock! Don’t just sneak up on me like that,” he half-shouted before forcing himself to lower his voice. “You scared me.”
“No, no, it’s fine,” Sherlock said. Then, “John, where are your trousers?”
“Why did you leave?”
One day he woke and was dressed and out the door before the sun had risen. He walked the city that he had always loved and wished that he could get lost in it for a while, but he had learned too much about the back alleys and rooftops chasing after Sherlock to really do so. When he had returned to the flat in the early afternoon his feet were sore and his legs were tired. His knee twinged and for a moment he feared the return of a limp that shouldn’t exist, but then he reminded himself that he wasn’t exactly a young man anymore and he hadn’t worn the best shoes for walking that morning.
The thought of Sherlock brought a tightness to his chest, as it always did, and he blinked hard before turning his head to gaze at the back of the couch. A chill different from the one in the flat settled around his heart like an old friend, achingly familiar and bittersweet, and he knew that no amount of blazing fire or cocoon of blankets could warm him.
“Yes.”
John was here.
“I wasn’t worried,” John said. He went over to meet Sherlock at the back of the car and picked up his bag, then closed the boot. When he reached for Rosie’s bag, Sherlock quickly bent and picked it up instead.
“Why don’t you check the website?”
He fished out the teabag and tossed it in the bin, poured in milk, gave it a quick stir from the spoon he had pulled out from the drawer, and then took an appreciative sip. It was too hot, of course, but that didn’t stop him from enjoying the warmth that went down to his belly and then seemed to spread throughout his body. Mug in hand, and cane, he turned and made his way over to the desk with the laptop. He pulled out the chair and sat himself down, still staring at the the laptop as if he expected it to do something out of the ordinary. He sipped his tea, then finally dragged a finger across the mousepad to wake the screen.
He went up to his room to find it wasn’t any warmer and he debated whether sleeping on the couch near the warm fire, or in his cold bedroom, would be worse for his shoulder.
“For what.”
“So how are you, Molly?” he asked when she was mostly finished, genuinely curious.
Looking around the room, he noticed a small table with an electric kettle, a french press with coffee, and an assortment of tea bags. He poured the water left from the bottle he bought at the airport into the kettle, pleased that it was enough to make to the minimum fill line, and flicked it on. He could use a cup of tea after traveling the morning. It was only early afternoon, so he had a few hours of daylight left. He would have his tea, then head out for a bit of sightseeing and dinner.
He wanted to believe him, to have faith in him. Wanted to take this second chance and make the most of it. Wanted his friend back.
“Let’s order some takeaway. Have dinner in. I’ll unpack everything tomorrow,” John said before taking a step back, though he didn’t stop playing with his hair.
She came over to look through the box with John and they spent the early afternoon decorating the tree while sharing random stories that didn’t make any sense to share while decorating a tree, but neither of them seemed to care
A smaller dog, fur covered in muck, was whining softly behind some bins. John leaned down, cautiously holding out a hand for the mutt, and after several moments the dog nudged his head forward, sniffling at his hand.
Joy bounded up to him upon his entrance, completely uncaring about his sour mood, and wagged her tail happily as he gave her a distracted pat on the head. He tossed his satchel and coat onto his chair as he grumbled under his breath about poncy gits with superiority complexes and compensation issues.
“What about the new case, then?” John asked after a moment after he took a sip of his tea.
“Has he not told you any of this?” she asked and Sherlock shook his head. She frowned, then leaned forward and gave a kind pat to his knee. “It’s in the past, dear. Now you’re back and he’s happy again. He never really was happy while you were gone.”
“I’m not interested in picking back up with Alex. Even if he was interested, that doesn’t mean I am. It takes two people in a relationship, Sherlock,” John argued as he pushed a hand agitatedly through the short sand and silver strands of his hair.
“Nicotine patch?” he asked and Sherlock nodded.
He stepped closer and Sherlock seemed to hold his breath. John reached a hand up to his hair before gently pulling the dandelion free. “It’s just you still had a flower in your hair,” he explained as he held up the item in question.
“Yeah, fine. Not as smooth as I thought I was,” he answers with a laugh and Sherlock’s eyes sparkle with mirth.
When he reached the window, he turned and his song faltered as he saw John watching him, but he quickly recovered. He sang the last refrain, a rather risque little line as for some reason children’s lullabies were wont to be, and carefully laid Rosie in the cot that stood beside John’s bed.
Sherlock arched a brow at that.
“Do people usually think you’re the murderer?” John asked.
Even the experiments-only microwave was gone.
And John would have been amazed, as he always had been, when Sherlock was reading the world around him in a way that no one else did. That no one else ever could.
“Write about your life, John. The things that happen to you.”
John’s body shivered again. “I believe I am your doctor.”
He found the front door to Baker Street unlocked when the car dropped him off and made his way up to the flat. That door was wide open and John walked in.
“I know.”
He frowned, though, after a moment.
Sherlock breathed deeply, refusing to flinch or acknowledge the dig, and kept walking until he found Lestrade.
“Fine. I really dare you to tell me who your first kiss was.”
He shook his head at himself as he pulled on his coat and scarf, then pulled a hat on as well since he had no intentions of freezing while outside. He pulled on his gloved, then attached Joy’s leash to her collar, the shiny silver of her nametag that Mrs. Hudson had bought for her catching the light that shone through the living room windows before he pulled open the door and they made their way down the stairs and out the door.
“Do you like to cook?” she asked as John handed over his card to pay.
He knows he saw him running around, and it is clear to John that he was doing it just to get John’s attention. There was no case. If there truly was one, they would not be standing on this street corner talking instead of running off after whatever clues Sherlock needed.
John felt another thrum of arousal at Sherlock’s seemingly absent-minded deduction. How he could read John’s body with his eyes closed was nearly intoxicating.
Sherlock looked at him for the first time since he came into the room.
“At least the wine bottle didn’t break. I think I’ve had enough for tonight, though,” he mumbled to himself, then stood and walked to the kitchen, pushing his way past his dead flatmate, his shoulder brushing against solid, living warmth, and he put the bag on the kitchen table. Went into the automatic motions of making tea, because fuck if he didn’t know what else to do at that moment.
When he was within view of Baker Street, his phone had pinged with three other texts that he had ignored. He opened the door, noting that Mrs. Hudson was out, as he pulled off his scarf and coat to hang them on their hook. As he climbed the seventeen steps, focusing on each stair, he deliberately stepped on the squeaky fourth step and the creaky eleventh for no other reason than to hear the sound in the otherwise silent space. He pushed the door open to the empty flat, walked immediately to the kitchen, and filled the kettle for tea.
“It’s tradition,” John smiled and leaned in for a kiss. Sherlock met him halfway. A perfectly sweet, gentle kiss that held the hint of promise for the rest of the evening.
John stared at the glowing red numbers of his alarm clock in his still dark room. It wasn’t quite 5 yet, but he knew he would get no more rest. He was too familiar with the feeling in his gut after years in a war zone and nightmares and late nights following a madman to ignore. His body and mind were too awake now.
“This is a gift, John. I know it hurts right now, but so few people get true second chances with those they love. It’s okay to be angry, but let it go, and then talk to him.”
“Oh, of course, how could I forget the fish?”
“Sherlock,” John said, voice thick and low, but Sherlock shook his head.
John leaned over him, his lips kissing up Sherlock’s throat, and with the efficiency of a man who was intimately familiar with giving pleasure, he patiently worked Sherlock open.
Mrs. Hudson blinked at him, then let out a grateful-sounding breath.
“Add more gin. No one will want to talk or deal with Lestrade while sober if he shows up in that jumper.”
“There has been a man following you for the last five minutes. His associate is about 100 meters in front of you, and if you don’t let me accompany you, you will find yourself bereft of both your wallet and your cane,” he said, his arm still wrapped warmly over his shoulder and his head bent so that John wasn’t able to get a good look at his face. He suddenly pulled John’s mobile from his hand, fingers flying quickly over the keys, and then held up the phone in what John had learned was the “selfie” pose. John realized he had been angling the two of them and when he pulled up the camera, John could see not only him and this stranger, but also the sidewalk and pedestrians behind them.
“Doesn’t make me a mind reader.”
“I’m not sure how that’s my problem. I made the list. You just needed to follow it.”
An attractive dark-haired woman was in the car, and other than giving him a name, which was most likely fake, she stared and tapped away on her Blackberry. John sat back, resigned to at least get somewhat comfortable for the ride. If nothing else, he didn’t have to pay for a taxi.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Andrew Rutherford. First year at university.”
“Please call me Alex,” he said with a polite smile. Sherlock would really rather not call him Alex; he rather wished he had never met the man at all, but he had made a decision and he would see it through.
Mrs. Hudson clucked her tongue, bending down to pick up the plate and fallen biscuits, then walked over to the armchair and tossed the plate down on the table. Sherlock continued to sit quietly, pretending to ignore them.
He felt like he had stood at the water’s edge all of his life; always standing at that brink of constantly shifting footing beneath him, just an illusion of solid ground, or allowing the tide to pull him into that bottomless fathom. The world had moved around him while he stood there as a boy who tried to avoid drunken fists, as a young man who went off to war because it was the only option, as an invalided soldier whose hands could no longer perform surgery. Then Sherlock had come sweeping into his life and he almost let him pull him into the ocean, but he hesitated, in fear or mistrust, and he was left standing there as Sherlock fell from a rooftop, and he told himself he was grateful that he never let himself be swept in because he would surely have drowned without Sherlock there.
His chair.
John took Joy out for a late morning walk. He would have invited Sherlock, but the man was lying supine on the couch in his mind palace when he had left, and he didn’t want to bother him. Despite the icy polluted slush that covered the pavement, it was a relatively mild winter day with occasional rays of sunshine poking through the overcast grey sky, with no wind, and John decided to take a longer walk than usual.
He huffed as he opened his eyes. The dream was gone, the illumination of the fairy lights and the warm feeling of good booze in his belly both fading into the gray light of early morning in the city, and the last thing he wanted was to think more of Sherlock or The Woman or anything, really. Thinking would lead to remembering and the reminder that the past was in the past and there was nothing in his present or future to warrant thinking about.
Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed this chapter. One more to go! 💜
“When did you plan all of this?”
He supposed it was. He hadn’t paid any attention to the calendar beyond whether it was a workday or not in a long time.
“Always,” Sherlock replied without guile. He uncrossed his legs and stood up gracefully, then crossed the room to grab his wallet and keys before he slipped them in his pockets
“Muddy puddles!” she cried delightedly and John snorted.
“You went to look at a flat with him this afternoon and now you’re going to crime scenes with him. Might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?” the man asked with a sardonic eyebrow raise, and John couldn’t help the flare of anger that he knew passed over his features. He knew he was nothing more than a broken man now, but he didn’t need the fact that someone like him would never be good enough for a man like Sherlock to be thrown in his face.
John stared at his friend in confusion at the sudden announcement that Sherlock apparently had plans for the room that John had agreed to move into just 2 hours ago. Had Sherlock changed his mind about John moving in? Did he no longer want to share Baker Street? Why was he holding John’s hand? Was it in an effort to let John down gently? John forced his face to remain as still as he could in an attempt to hide the warring feelings of anguish and disappointment over losing the room and the flutter of hope and desire that shot through him from the feel of Sherlock’s hand on his.
He was an idiot.
“Alright then, girl. Let’s get you home,” John said.
“Thirty seconds,” Sherlock informed him.
“If you keep talking like that I’ll come before you get that far.”
Sherlock held his eyes, a small smile on his face, and John felt far warmer than the weather and the rising sun could account for. He cleared his throat before turning back to look at Rosie and forced himself to take a fortifying sip of his coffee.
“How about that time after the case with the woman and the red shoes? You had barely eaten in a week, and when it was finally solved you were so hungry that the idea of waiting for takeaway had you deducing that poor server to the point he was in tears. Or the time when you threw that bowling ball at a wall because your order was delivered with chicken instead of the pork you ordered? Or how about last week, when you snapped at me for ordering dinner for me and Rosie, but not you, because you ‘weren’t hungry’, and then you proceeded to lay on the sofa in a strop for the rest of the evening?”
It opened onto a blank page, and it took him a moment to realize it was the blog his therapist had wanted him to start.
“It’s been one day, Sherlock. You can stay inside without complaining for 24 hours, I think.”
“About a case, yes,” he replied as he laid the laptop on the table in front of him and stood up.
“Is this someone who kills using candy canes, or someone who kills candy canes?”
“And are you finished?”
“Go hoover.”
“No, it wasn’t your place to say anything. Besides, it wouldn’t have meant anything anyway. We weren’t together,” he explained. Then, “We aren’t together.”
His landlady spun around, flinging a fake pinecone directly at his head, as she raised a hand to her heart in surprise.
“No time, John,” he said.
“What about being married to your work?” John asked and Sherlock almost laughed. Of course, that’s what John would start with. Those words he had said at the beginning because he had a horrible record with romantic entanglements and had wanted John for a flatmate. Words he had said to throw him off, because he had known, even then, that a relationship with John would be all-consuming and it had been that these last few months even without the complication of physical intimacy. But he was done hiding what he really wanted from John.
Rosie woke early the next day, nearly vibrating in her excitement, and instead of tempting her back to sleep, John simply got her and himself dressed. Sherlock was still sleeping, so he told Rosie to be extra quiet, and they left the house and went down to the beach before the sun had even begun to rise. Rosie ran through the sand in the predawn light, hunting for more treasures and making sandcastles with the toys John had somehow remembered to grab on their way down.
John found himself idly wondering how many people walked up and down those steps in a given day. In just the last 30 minutes it had seen more action than John had seen in a year.
He takes a small sip of the wine and lets the heavy, dry notes of oak and dark cherry sit on his tongue for a moment before swallowing. Sherlock’s bright gaze, a startling bluish-green at the moment, turns to him and he meets his eyes.
Well, there was no way he was going to win that battle.
There was bark and the scrape of a chair being pushed back in response and John smiled as Joy came running up to him. He stopped to scratch her ears with his free hand, halfway to the kitchen, when the light was partially blocked and he turned to look up at his landlady.
Sherlock stood at the point where the tide receded, the sand shifting and pulling away from his bare feet while he watched Rosie. Soft linen trousers were folded up in an attempt to keep them dry, but John could see where the material had darkened after getting wet from a misjudged step or wave. The sleeves of his white button-down were rolled up to his elbows and his dark curls were in complete disarray as the wind whipped through them. His back was towards him at the moment, and John allowed his gaze to drift over his long, lean lines in silent appreciation for the beauty before him.
They made their way down the stairs, briefly stopped at the door to throw on their coats, then headed out the door and down the pavement. It was a mild day and the restaurant close enough that walking there made more sense than getting a taxi. The sounds of the city, alive and thriving around them in the midday rush, accompanied them as they walked in sync, and Sherlock took in every moment he could. He walked a bit closer to John than he normally would, their shoulders occasionally pressed against each other, but there were enough people around them that Sherlock felt he could get away with the small brushes. For one electrifying moment he thought about how easy it would be to reach out and grab John’s hand, to hold it in his as they walked, but he swiftly squashed the thought down.
It appears things are finally moving in the direction that Sherlock hoped they would for John and Alex. Or at least, that's how it seems...
“I want to taste every inch of you,” John panted.
“It’s a pleasure to see you again, Dr. Watson.”
Sherlock smiled, his other hand covering John’s so that his hand was caught between his warm palms.
Sherlock nodded and went off to a different section of the house. John found the salad dressing and closed the fridge door. He finished setting the table and had called in Rosie to wash her hands before eating when Sherlock returned with a rather expensive looking bottle of merlot in his hands. He pulled the lasagna from the oven and prepared a plate for Rosie while Sherlock opened the bottle.
It was the domestic soundtrack of his life in 221B with one Dr. John Watson. A melody he was as familiar with as the ones he coaxed from his violin. An aria that filled the hole that had been carved into his consciousness during his time away. It was comfort and contentment and served as a balm to soothe the stripes across his back and through his psyche. He had so desperately missed it.
John nodded. He looked away from Sherlock, to all the flowers again. His thoughts whirling as he tried to make sure that he truly understood what he was being told.
I have this headcanon that Sherlock and John watch The Princess Bride when they're out of sorts because OF COURSE they would.
The man’s eyebrows lifted in a flicker of what could only be surprise before it settled back into the mask the man seemed to perpetually wear.
“You first,” Sherlock offered.
Mrs. Hudson smiled again, then made her way out of the kitchen and into his living room.
“Well, for one thing, you look as put-together as you did when you left to do that paperwork this afternoon. Not a single curl is out of place. If you had been dancing at a club you would be in a bit more disarray. All those people. Bodies pressing together as they dance. The humidity would have affected your hair no matter how expensive the product you put in it is.” John deduced, and didn’t that cause an interesting mix of annoyance, pride, and, for the sake of honesty, arousal? John stood right in front of him now, close enough to reach out and touch if he wanted, but he kept his hands firmly at his sides. Kept his face completely neutral. “The heat and the lights in the club would have had you sweating in those clothes of yours, but you’re completely dry. You haven’t been drinking, and who goes to a club to dance and doesn’t have at least one drink?” John continued.
“What if I kept my experiments to half of the kitchen table and half available counter space? I will make sure all other surfaces in the kitchen are sterilized in time for you to do whatever you need to in there,” Sherlock offered.
“Tea?” John asked, instinctual etiquette kicking in without his consent. Greg nodded and John made his way into the kitchen to prepare two cups. He filled the kettle and
“Come, John. Come now. Fill me up. I want to feel you for days.”
“Thinking about what?” he questioned after a few moments of Sherlock’s continued silence.
But then John did the completely unexpected.
“You’re the detective.”
“Oh Sherlock, what have you done?” she exclaimed. A sudden crash from the flat above forced their attention upwards as they realized they weren’t alone in the building.
The bench was still a bit damp when he sat, but he decided he didn’t care as he let his eyes wander around the beauty of the garden even during the night. Scents blended together, basil, the vines of the tomato plants, the wet earth from the rain, and flowers that John didn’t know enough about to say which ones added to the overall perfume. It wasn’t cloying, but it was rich, and John breathed it in deeply, eyes closed, head tipped back.
Sherlock turns towards the door, then back to John, his eyes searching over him again.
“So this...this is what you want to say? The roses and the tulips and the chrysanthemums?”
“John, did you hear me? Hurry up. Homicide. Warehouse. Now.” He commanded, and John offered him a questioning “hmm?” in response while safely hiding behind the shower curtain.
“Oh, I do. And we’re wearing them tomorrow for the Christmas party.”
“Yes. I love dancing,” Sherlock replied. “Is it so hard to believe that I went out dancing at a club?”
Mrs. Hudson and Sherlock made their way into the kitchen as he was putting in slices of bread to toast. Sherlock came up to him and kissed his temple in an absent-minded gesture as he reached around him to slice mushrooms to throw in a pan.
He honestly couldn’t even blame them.
“Well, I’m off. If you need me, don’t,” he says as he stuffs his keys, wallet, and mobile in their various pockets.
“I don’t care, I just want you. I need you. Now.”
They made their way down the pavement and walked the five minutes to Angelo’s, which was placed rather conveniently near the address that had been texted from John’s phone earlier. They made their way in and took the table beside the window. Angelo came by, introductions and small talk were made, and then Sherlock turned most of his attention out the window to the front of the building just down the street while John ate.
John grinned up at him. “That sounds very much like,” he started.
While Joy was content with her dog bed while John was downstairs and in his armchair, it would simply not do when he climbed the stairs for bed. After her leg had healed, she had followed him up, jumped on the bed, and made herself right at home at the foot of it. John had made one token effort to try and convince her that dogs didn’t belong on beds, but they both knew she was going to get what she wanted.
John huffed a laugh. “Probably a good idea at this point. What game, then?”
“I would much rather he stay in if I can help it.”
He finished his tea, set his mug down, and closed his eyes to better listen.
The plume of smoke that wafted out of the oven was both terrifying and almost nostalgic. John couldn’t count the times that one of Sherlock’s experiments ended (and occasionally began) with odorous blooms of smoke that filled their kitchen before finally dissipating through the windows that would be thrown open.
, John agreed. He wanted Sherlock to use him. To use him for his pleasure and his lust.
Everything he made so far was absolutely atrocious.
She huffed and relaxed further, accepting or waving off his apologies he supposed, and he sighed in reply.
“Whoops,” she said without stopping and somehow managed to keep from stepping on anything without even paying attention. “Look, look!”
They both groaned in pain as the wind knocked out of them. Then John sneezed into his elbow again.
Sherlock’s voice was deep and low, barely audible over the crackling of the fire. John’s eyes flicked up from his examination of Sherlock’s feet and just how close he could let his own feet come to them without touching, but Sherlock’s eyes were still closed.
Sherlock’s hands went to his waist and he pulled John further between his legs and right up against the bed. He wanted to be closer. He wanted bare skin. He pushed his hands under John’s thin nightshirt, seeking the warm flesh of his stomach and back, and it was still not enough.
Sherlock glanced away from his friend. This was all a calculated risk. He didn’t go running off when there was a chance he could truly get hurt. He knew what he was doing and what he was doing was trying to get John to engage more. He knew it was childish, and perhaps a tad manipulative, but he was hoping if he could make John see how much danger and cases he missed by not living at Baker Street, then maybe he would change his mind.
“John,” Mrs. Hudson said after pulling her hands down from her mouth.
“Daddy, I want chocolate!” Rosie reminded him for the sixth time in the last 15 minutes and John nodded.
“Can we open them? Please!”
Did it even change anything?
“Sherlock, I’m so sorry. If I could have told him something, anything, I’m sure he would have waited-,” Molly began quickly, but Sherlock shook his head.
Sherlock didn’t even bother to mention that he had already asked the same questions and he noted that Mr. Campbell never bothered to correct him either.
“For a genius, you’re a real idiot sometimes,” John declared.
John looked into Sherlock’s eyes as his thoughts raced. What would he wish for? What would make this little piece of happiness that he had managed to carve out of his mess of life just that much better? What was he missing, that he desperately wanted, but was terrified to ask for?
“Is this ok?” John asked and Sherlock nodded his head as he didn’t trust his voice. “Can I take these off?” he questioned as his fingers tugged at Sherlock’s pants, and he lifted his hips again. John hooked his fingers into the soft cotton and carefully removed them.
He honestly hadn’t suspected John to propose. They had discussed marriage, of course. They had even discussed Sherlock legally adopting Rosie in case anything happened to John, as well. But he hadn’t expected John to purchase a ring and propose on Christmas Eve. He knew about his other gift, the one wrapped under the tree in a less horrendous wrapping paper. It would appear that one was a decoy.
“I have an answer for you.”
That feeling was what he needed. That feeling of being full and possessed and wanted by another. He needed Sherlock in him the way he needed oxygen. Sherlock waited as patiently as he could for John to take the lead. His large hands had shifted from his thighs to his hips, fingers splayed wide and digging gently into the flesh there. John stared down at him and carefully pulled himself up before pushing back down and both men gasped at the sensation. Sherlock’s fingers tightened and John rolled his hips again before he gradually built up a rhythm.
"Its complicated," John said again.
“We weren’t friends but we were cool. He wasn’t rude to me about my heritage.”
Sherlock shrugs. “He’ll get over it.”
Sherlock told himself that this was a side effect of the increased sex drive the testosterone gave him. His doctor had even warned him “Your sex drive will increase a lot and I want you to be prepared for it.” But as someone who’s sex drive had been non-existant his whole life, he’d shrugged off the warning. He definitely wasn’t prepared for it. The way that he had to hold back a groan every time he smelled John’s cologne. How his ‘bottom growth’ got erect every time John brushed against him accidentally. How he dreamed at night of John smiling and chuckling and he woke up wet and aching.
Lestrade came through for them and they were soon sitting on a floral couch in a living room that looked like it hadn't been redecorated since the 1950's. or maybe the owner, a miss Eliza May, was into retro style. Based on her worn bellbottom jeans that was probably a true indicator of her style. She was best friends with the victim in the woods and they were there to ask her some questions.
'That's sexy. I want you on top of me Sherlock. I want you to ride my dick. It would feel amazing.'
The detective quickly snatched a piece of pizza off of the table where John was eating and blogging on his laptop. Then he flopped down on the couch and sighed.
Sherlock nods again, helpless. "Yes."
“Not that it’s a problem,” his mother was quick to add. “We adore John. The two of you are so perfect together. It makes sense that you would be a good couple.”
Sherlock couldn't just stay at the cabin all alone while John was visiting Mary. It would look suspicious since they were supposed to be a couple in love an therefore spending time together. Besides, Sherlock didn't really want to deal with his family alone. That was the whole reason he had brought John along on this stupid vacation, wasn't it?
He arrived at the cabin to see Mary and John saying goodbye, saw the way her hand lingered on his arm.
“Jealous?” He raised an eyebrow at her skeptically. “Why would I possibly be jealous of you?”
"No."
“Oh!” Sherlock gasped. “John… that feels…”
'Don't do anything stupid. I'm coming home now.'-JW'
Sherlock pulled his phone out and held it up to his ear. "That's Lestrade," he announced. "We'd better go." He tugged John towards the door.
"Remember when I had the flu a while ago? I told him that I couldn't see him because I was sick." Of course Jim had tried to convince him to anyway but Sherlock had refused. He was too sick to even think about sex. "I told him that he could probably find someone else who wasn't sick and willing to have sex with him. He said that he doesn't just sleep with anyone."
"You don't mean that. You''re-"
“Oh!” John cried out. “Fuck.”
"The boy's phone records. His girlfriend was more than happy to give me all the information I needed."
"You let the fish go," John said, sounding a little surprised.
"What isn't?"
Nonetheless, he can't help his own attraction to John. The attraction has been there for a long time but he's never sure if John returns that feeling. He'd never risk making a move on John and screwing up their friendship so he ignores the attraction the best that he can.
Sherlock sighed. “Do try to keep up, John,” he complained. “I’ll put in simple terms that your tiny brain can understand.” He spoke slower but his words were slightly slurred. “Sex alarms me. But with you, it wouldn’t alarm me.”
"I'm visiting my aunt," She replied, pulling John into an embrace. "Its so good to see you again. You look well."
"You can tell me anything, you know that right? I'm not angry at you. Everything's alright."
John laughed and it was one of the most amazing sounds in the whole world. He leaned in to kiss him again and this time Sherlock returned the kiss.
"Does he often go fishing with Braden Thomas?"
"Obviously."
"Thank you, I try my best."
"Really?" John gasped. "Are you sure?"
“I know this must be difficult for you,” Mycroft said, which irritated Sherlock even more. What did he mean by that? He wouldn’t understand any of this. “It’s the end of an era. John and Mary are going to have marital bliss now. Try to be happy for them. Don’t get involved.”
"Will you be my boyfriend?" John asked.
"The bees?"
She was too sweet. He didn't know why but he felt guilty. "I have feelings for someone else." That seemed like an easy way to let her down even if it wasn't true. He didn't have any feelings for anyone else, did he? Why did he say that instead of just saying no one could replace Irene? What was wrong with him?
"He treats me like a guy," Sherlock said. "He calls me Mister and it makes me smile. John, no one's been interested in me that way before. There's a week left until my eighteenth birthday and he's the only one who's wanted me."
Again he was ignored as John continued to speak to Mary. "That sounds great. I'll see you soon."
John was smiling and lying with such ease that it was almost frightening. Sherlock was proud of him. Perhaps some of his master manipulation skills had rubbed off on John.
He loved hearing John swear.
Before he could continue to apologize further, his parents knocked on their bedroom door and insisted they join them outside for yet another foolish camping tradoption. Sherlock was annoyed and didn't want to participate in such a waste of time.
Sherlock was gazing into his eyes now, very serious, and John’s heart nearly stopped. Shit… he was really serious, wasn’t he? How was this even possible? He never… not even once? “Why not?”
“Shut up,” John demanded, kissing him again.
“Goodnight, Sherlock,” John replied. “Get your rest. We have a big day tomorrow.”
"He went to see his father out of town," she explained. She had an accent that indicated she'd grown up here her whole life. "He'll be back tomorrow."
Sherlock moans louder.
“Look at me!” John demanded.
"You and Irene must have... You know."
"Its okay," John assured him. "We'll fix it."
"That I'm in love with you."
So he took a walk down to the lake, making himself comfortable beneath  a shady tree with a book. Still, he found that it was hard to focus. His mind was racing. He kept thinking of the case. And Irene. And Mary. Liars and cheaters, all of them. John wasn't here to discuss the case with. He wasn't allowed any drugs. So he called the only person he could when in a situation like this.
John chuckled in a way that Sherlock had never heard before and it was incredibly sexy. It was confident and mischievous and playful. “I can help with that,” John replied, and he undressed himself as well as helping Sherlock out of his clothes too.
John frowned. "That wasn't a compliment."
Sherlock sighed sadly and looked down at the floor. "I wish you would have told me," he said. "You have Mary now."
“You expect me to believe that you and John have been romantically involved for months now without me noticing,” he said.
Sherlock waved goodbye to them, even as his stomach did somersault at the thought of the two of them together on a date.
"Can't you see it?" he asked. "You're so smart, I thought you would have noticed it already."
John raised his fist like he was going to hit him. Sherlock winced. John reconsidered and instead grabbed a hold of Sherlock’s curls, tugging on his hair roughly.
“Do you regret it?”
"First thing in the morning we go out and seek it."
“Yes, cum for me Sherlock.”
There was a loud howling in the distance, as if from a hound.
“Do we need them?”
“They’re going to ask a lot of questions,” Sherlock warned him.
Sherlock had brought lube and condoms apparently. He said he liked to be prepared just in case. John didn't have time to think about that too much. He was too busy staring at Sherlock's perfect body. He was so very attractive.
Once he arrives, he throws a bunch of money at the driver then races up the stairs to their apartment. He is mildly relieved to find Sherlock laying on the couch. He's clearly unharmed and alive. His fingers are steepled in front of his face as he thinks and John can see his chest rising and falling with each breath. He's got on his pajama pants, an old tee shirt, and his house coat. It's the same thing he was wearing this morning when John left for work.
John wrote it all down.
Sherlock shakes his head. "Nothing," he says.
Sherlock awoke as John dragged him and shoved him into a cold shower, fully clothed. "You cock!" He was shouting.
"I'll only be gone an hour. I'm sure you'll be fine for that long. If it's a real emergency, Mycroft will call me."
"I love s'mores," John announced, showing Sherlock how to make them.
He waited outside while John told Mary everything. He was beginning to think it was a mistake but then John was pulling him inside and into bed to snuggle between him and Mary. And though things had not gone as he imagined, Sherlock had never felt so right. He knew that he was exactly where he was supposed to be.
“Of course,” John agreed. Sherlock watched as John straddled him, admired the way his body moved on top of him. He used the lube, stroking Sherlock’s cock and he moaned at how nice his touch felt. John lowered himself slowly, inch by inch, on Sherlock’s cock. He felt so tight and warm.
"My sister Ellie had been drinking," the girl explained. "I told her I had a headache and was turning in early. I was only at the bar because i was supposed to be her designated driver. I told her to take a taxi home and to be careful because I'd heard of a murder in the area. I was afraid but she laughed it off."
Again she shrugged. "I don't remember."
"What monster? There never was any monster."
John was currently laying on his stomach, face buried in a pillow. He looked peaceful and warm. sunlight bathed the room and Sherlock was grateful for the air conditioning.
"Or maybe she didn't want anyone to know about her crush on the boy. It's hardly appropriate."
Sherlock sighed, annoyed with him for being 'slow'. "I'm... I love you."
Sherlock left John to his own devices. He took a shower and found it frustratingly difficult to focus. He kept thinking of John kissing him and all the rude comments he made afterwards. If anything he should be the one glad that he wasn't actually dating John considering that he was so rude.
John grins in response and kisses him. Sherlock has gotten a lot more confident in their kissing now. He kisses John back with just as much passion and desire.
Sherlock nods.
"No response after that?"
John smiled at him. "That's fine with me."
Sherlock gasped. "Oh!" No one had ever done this to him before. John's mustache felt... interesting. It wasn't terrible but Sherlock preferred a clean-shaven John anyway.
“Look around, everyone here is white. They fly confederate flags even though we’re not in the south. You know why? Cause they’re racist.”
John pushed Sherlock back against the nearest wall. He nipped at Sherlock's bottom lip and was rewarded with a pleasure filled moan. He moved his lips to Sherlock's neck and rocked his body against his.
“Fuck!” John growled, dangerously close to the edge. “Say it!”
Meanwhile, John turned his attention to the boyfriend. “Tyler,” he began. “You said on the phone that you might have a tip for us?”
"Leave it alone," his mother begged. "This is our family vacation. We all are supposed to be spending time together not chasing murderers. Leave it to the police to solve."
“I explained to you that I had to-“
"Do you think that he was murdered?"
“Yes…” Sherlock agreed, nodding quickly. “Keep going.”
The dead woman lay on her back under a tree. Her blonde hair was wet with rain, blood, and mud. She appeared to be around 30 years old, average height and weight. She must have been fairly pretty in life but now she was cold and lifeless, staring wide eyed in death. Some of her clothes were tossed carelessly on the ground nearby, a white blouse and lacy bra both stained with her blood. She was left wearing only a mini skirt and designer boots.
John gave his hair another tug.
Sherlock would rather have him ask than say the wrong thing. "My cock."
John was beaming at him excitedly. "How was it?"
“I don’t like seeing you…” Sherlock started to confess.
Sherlock already knew this about John of course.
John ordered an ice cream sundae. Sherlock elected for an iced tea to sip on. He didn’t understand why John was ‘eating his feelings’ at the moment. It would do no good. They found a picnic table in the back, away from the crowd of rambunctious teenagers in the parking lot. There was a tattered yellow and white striped umbrella over the picnic table, providing them some much needed shade from the harsh sun. There was not a cloud in the sky. Sherlock absentmindedly traced the hearts and initials of young lovers carved into the wooden table and benches. He had an odd urge to add his and John’s names just to say they were here. Young love was so overrated.
John soon pressed one slick finger against Sherlock’s entrance. The detective moaned John’s name.
'That was amazing' he texted to John.
"It's happened before."
Sherlock nearly whimpered.
“Yeah,” he said. “Just give me a second.”
“You shouldn’t pull my hair, John.”
"I could go with you," John offered.
If they were happy, they would leave him alone. That’s what Sherlock wanted. In his opinion, he had better things to focus on than finding a romantic partner. Besides, who could ever be more perfectly suited for him than Irene? It was useless to try to replace her.
“Then what happened?” John asked.
"What's going on?"
“What…?” Sherlock asked, a little shaken by what had just happened between them.
This is wrong, Sherlock thought. This is a mistake.
“I don’t have anyone else.”
Sherlock’s eyes flew open and he stared at John.
"We would have told you all sooner," John was saying. "But you know how Sherlock likes his privacy. It's probably why it took so long for us to confess our feelings to each other. It happened slowly, the shift from friends to something more. I had to realize what I truly felt for him and admit to myself first. And then it wasn't easy because I didn't to risk ruining our friendship. He's still my best friend and now my boyfriend too. I'm really lucky to have found that. He makes me happy."
“You’re having a panic attack,” John told him. “It’s alright. Look at me. Breathe.” He pulled Sherlock into strong embrace. “You’re safe.”
John put a hand to Sherlock's forehead. Then his fingers moved to Sherlock's wrist, feeling his pulse. "What's wrong?"
"Let me get you a cup of tea," John said breathlessly when the kiss ended.
John nodded. "Doctors orders."
"Hold on, Molly, I've got a text." He read the message quickly. It was from John.
Sherlock decided that he really did not like this woman. She was definitely a suspicious character. Still, this was not actually new information the boy was telling them.
“Unconventional, but sounds like my son,” his mother smiled fondly. She seemed so happy to think that he’d settled down romantically. Sherlock couldn’t understand why his love life was so important to her. At least, she believed their charade.
'Yes, I'll pick you up tomorrow and we can watch a movie at my house. My parents won't be home all night.'
“Jesus! I can’t believe this. I can’t fucking believe this.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. Was this seriously happening? Why did Mary's aunt have to live here and why did Mary have to be visiting her now? He found Mary to be annoying and it was frustrating having their case interrupted by a reunion like this. The sooner Mary went away, the sooner they could return to the case which was much more interesting than Mary Morstan.
"I'll never be so stupid again," he vowed.
They were briefed of the situation upon arrival at the local police station before they were ushered into a room where a young girl sat sipping a glass of water alone at a table. She had long blond hair pulled into a pink scrunchie at the top of her head and sparkly bracelets all down her thin arms. She had on a boys sweater that was too big for her, which Sherlock immediately deduced to be belonging to her boyfriend. She had pink metal braces on her teeth and didn't look old enough for the smudged eye makeup on her freckled face.
John was happy as they brought in the new year. This night, no one was sleeping on the floor. Sherlock was in the bed with John, kissing him passionately.
Sherlock did go into town, stopping first to buy cigarettes. He sat on a bench near some old train tracks and smoked a couple. When he was on the second ciggarette, he couldn't help but notice a young man gazing at him. What was it with the teenagers around here? Did this one have a missing boyfriend too? Though, that might make the case more interesting at least. He didn't want to admit it, but this missing person case had left him feeling stuck. He was a little afraid that he could fail this one too.
"Noticed what?" Sherlock's sorrow and self-pity were being overshadowed by his anger now.
"What?" He was struggling to make sense of this.
He doesn't hesitate. "That you could no longer handle my unusual habits."
Sherlock waited for John to return that night, doing his best to occupy his mind. He found it difficult to focus on the case or anything else that wasn’t John. Still, he managed to resist the urge to text or call John, even when he was out late and he had to make an excuse to his parents for where John had gone.
Sherlock looked down between them and saw the hard bulge in John’s red briefs. There was even a damp spot where John was dripping precum. It was so sexy. Thinking that he was the one turning John on this much only made him feel more confident.
"Its good to talk about it sometimes," John encouraged. "It can help you to heal."
"She likes you."
Sherlock sighed. He didn't think he wanted to sleep. But a few minutes later John was asleep with his arm around Sherlock. If he was anyone else, Sherlock would have pushed him away. It was John though and it felt comforting to him. He soon fell asleep and thankfully he had no more nightmares.
John was angry because he’d been in love with his best friend and then he disappeared for two years. John was forced to move on. He got married and he had a baby and all he had ever really wanted was Sherlock. No matter what happened, he never stopped wanting Sherlock. It wasn’t fair.
Wasn't this surprise supposed to be enjoyable for him? It didn't sound like it would be. "Dull."
John does his best and it must be working because Sherlock's sounds grow more urgent.
By the time they returned to the cabin, rain was beginning to fall. "Hurry! It's raining, Sherlock!" John exclaimed, grabbing onto his arm and pulling him quicker towards the cabin.
"Yes...please..."
“I’m sure I’ll survive,” John said, chuckling. There were a lot worse things than having to share a bed with Sherlock.
“Yes, I have,” Sherlock admitted. “Only when I have to. I usually let it go away on its own.”
“Sex alarms you then?” John was too tipsy to come up with an intelligent sounding response.
Sherlock didn't even want to look at John anymore. This was all so ridiculous. "You're right. It is fake. All of this will be over soon." His heart was racing and he felt like he was suffocating. His instincts told him to run, escape, fight or flight. He wanted more than anything to make it all stop.
He didn't want to admit those doubts aloud as he sat with his best friend John in his own apartment. They were together on his couch, their tea forgotten and cooling in mismatched mugs on the coffee table.
A couple minutes later he got a text message back from John. 'On my way.'
“Are you alright, John?” he asked.
Sherlock nodded quickly. "Quite sure."
"When he's not looking at you, I see it. You don't hide it then, how sad you are."
"Why did you do this, Sherlock? Why didn't you call me?"
"I can't. I'm meeting Mary. We can eat dinner together later tonight, though."
"Of course," Sherlock replied, bending down and gently taking the fish off the hook. He placed the fish in the water where it promptly swam back away.
John didn’t give Sherlock very much time to recover. He pulled him towards his bedroom. Sherlock found himself lying on his own bed, watching as John stripped in front of him.
He woke up to John holding him tightly and telling him "It's just a dream. Everything's okay."
They soon reached their destination. The small but semi-busy ice cream stand was a welcome sight to the detective. They had work to do. It would help distract John from thinking of Mary.
“I… missed you too,” he confessed quietly, finishing up John’s tie.
"It wasn't Mycroft," his father said.
John smelled of her perfume and it made Sherlock feel sick to his stomach. “I’m all sweaty,” he complained. “It’s hot and I ran right here. But I see now that you’re fine, and there’s no emergency, so I’m going to take a quick shower.”
"A few."
"She wants you to be her boyfriend again."
"Fuck me," Sherlock said suddenly.
"Then shut up."
The flowers were atrocious and all of the bright colors hurt his eyes. Mary had clearly chosen every detail of the wedding.
"Could they be trying to sell it or something like that?"
“Of course.” Mycroft was a know it all. This was none of his business. He had no right to say these things to Sherlock.
“Sherlock?” John asked, approaching him cautiously.
She shrugged again.
"Someone," Sherlock corrected.
Theories were running wild in Sherlock's head. He and John took dinner to their bedroom to discuss the case, much to his mother's dismay.
John smiled. "You don't have heat stroke, Sherlock. But maybe you did get too much Sun. You need to rest and cool down for a little while. That means relaxing and taking a break from the case for tonight."
John can tell that Sherlock is inexperienced with this but he doesn't mind. Their noses and teeth bump, the kiss is messy but perfect. They are both breathless as they pull back to look at each other.
"No, I don't," John admitted, shaking his head. "I know you're having doubts. I can see it all over your face. Have you ever asked him if he's seeing other people or even how he feels about you?"
"Just try it," John encouraged. "What are you afraid of? Bears?"
That seemed to confirm the identity of the killer. This was the same man.
They ended up in bed. And after as they together, Sherlock didn't feel used or dirty or sad. He was happy, happier than he could ever remember being.
Sherlock has been seeing Jim Moriarty for three months now. Seeing was a loose term. He couldn't exactly call what they had a relationship. They'd only been on one actual date and then after that they saw each other infrequently. Whenever Jim texted him, then he would catch the next available cab and go to his apartment. At first it was kind of exciting, but more and more Sherlock was beginning to have doubts.
"Do you think he's onto us?" John asked.
And John did. He threw himself at Sherlock, kissing him passionately. Somehow Sherlock ended up in John's lap and he was rocking his hips against John's as they kissed. He moaned quietly against John's lips and John's self-control went out the window.
"For the love of god, get this through your head! I am not leaving!"
Sherlock was embarrassed to admit that he had not. 'I would need to find someone that was willing to do that with me,' he told him.
The 'fishing buddy' lived with his mother in an almost stereotypical small town country home. The dirt road lead through the trees down to a house with missing shingles and peeling blue paint. The yard was torn up by what appeared to be ATV tracks. There was an old grill, broken lawn chairs, and a rusty bicycle near the back of the house. Overgrown weeds were tangled near the door as they approached and knocked, finding the doorbell was dead.
"We will," John promised. "I've got him under control."
John stroked him a little faster.
Sherlock moaned. “John, I might…” He wasn’t able to control himself, able to stop the way his body reacted to John.
"Where's John?"
“So do you.” So perfect. So very perfect. His own fingers never felt this good.
“John…”
John asked him how it went and Sherlock had remained optimistic. Something had changed though. Or maybe the true Jim was revealing himself. Because Jim never called him cute again after their first date. It almost seemed one sided. Sherlock was always sure to compliment Jim but the compliments were not returned. They never went on a date again.
Sherlock sighed. "Mary will be here for you soon."
“You don’t.”
“It’s… interesting,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock was seventeen when he met John. He was sitting alone, reading a book at a cafe. And then there was a voice asking him "Is this seat taken?"
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
"No, as my real date."
“I’m sorry.”
Sherlock nodded quickly. “Yes.” He took his own underwear off in a hurry then pressed his body against John’s. Neither one of them could be bothered to take their socks off. He didn’t want to stop for even a second. He rocked his hips against John’s so their cocks slid together and they both moaned.
"She has everything to do with this! Don't be so stupid, John."
“And that gives you an erection?”
That stopped Sherlock in his tracks. "Who?"
"What do you mean you did this because of me?"
He bit his lip, gazing at John with wide eyes. “Okay.”
“Oh!” Sherlock gasped, closing his eyes and getting lost in the pleasure.
"Don't touch me!" Sherlock snapped.
John didn't waste any time. He'd wanted this for so long. He couldn't think of anything else.
"You never asked me how I felt about that."
"Sherlock, are you okay?" John asked as Sherlock walked into their apartment.
“Well, thank you both for your help,” John told the teens.
"Do you feel good when you're with him? Are you happy? Do you feel good about your relationship...?"
"Of course you did."
"Do you have feelings for her?"
Sherlock managed to take a deep breath, inhaling John’s familiar scent. He truly did feel safe in John’s arms. There was no one he’d trust more with his life than John Watson.
"Was he flirting with you?" John asked.
"I actually do mind."
“Oh my god…”
"Obsessing," John corrected.
There’s a knock on the door and John thinks it’s going to be Mrs. Hudson but it’s not. It’s Mycroft Holmes.
“What are you-“ Sherlock tried to ask.
He wanted to go further but he was too afraid he’d hurt John somehow. “Do you ever… finger yourself?” he asked.
“What happened?”
This morning as he woke, the first thing he became aware of was the breath on his neck. He noticed the sensation of stubble lightly scraping his skin and the warmth of a body pressed against his own. It felt nice actually. But he didn't think that he was supposed to enjoy it. It seemed wrong somehow. This was not a lover embracing him in bed but his friend who was fast asleep and most likely unaware of his actions.
"What is it?" He encouraged her.
"That's her sister over there," a cop told them, pointing at a sniffling girl on the sidelines.
She nodded and wiped her face with some tissues. "I used the restroom and when I walked past my sister on the way out, she was talking to some guy."
“And you’ll shave your mustache.”
"You idiot..." Sherlock took a shaky breath. He refused to cry. It would make him look even more foolish.
"Can I touch you?"
Sherlock was relieved. But he still wanted to do something fun. So he stripped his pants off and slid a hand down the front of his boxer briefs. He snapped a photo of it then sent it to John saying 'Look what I'm doing.'
They sat together on the bed, Sherlock's back facing John.
“Sherlock, I came to-“ he starts to say, then he stops suddenly. He looks curiously at John and at Sherlock as if they might have sprouted antlers or something equally disturbing.
Mycroft dragged him home sometime around midnight. "We were afraid you'd gone and gotten yourself killed," he said.
It was just a dream. Moriarty was dead. There were no threats lurking. Everything was alright, no cause for alarm.
"Just a dream," he said quietly.
Fuck… Did John always wear tight red briefs under his clothes? He looked so fucking sexy. Sherlock couldn’t resist reaching out to touch him. His fingers traced the scar on John’s leg.
“John!” Sherlock shouts. “John, I… oh… “
Sherlock didn’t hesitate. He had been thinking this over for a while now. “Because you care about me. And because if you say yes, then this is a free vacation for you.”
John doesn’t spend a lot of time teasing and preparing Sherlock. He uses a generous amount of lube and enters him slowly. He watches Sherlock’s face, making sure he’s not hurting him too much. Sherlock’s expression is difficult to read so John asks him “Are you okay?”
“You want me to, don’t you?”
They stumbled backwards together, tumbling onto an old leather couch. John was desperately pulling at Sherlock’s clothes, struggling to undress him. Sherlock helped him and their clothes fell to the floor.
"Be nice," John scolded him.
John stared at Sherlock for what seemed like an eternity, confused, trying to process this statement which seemingly had come from nowhere. They hadn’t even been discussing sex. At least John hadn’t thought so. Sherlock had mentioned something about that nurse that had smiled at John the other day and now this abrupt statement.
"Yes, well..." He couldn't actually come up with a good enough reason to avoid swimming, not one that would satisfy John anyway. And maybe he just didn't want to see John looking so disappointed in him anymore. "Fine. I'll swim with you."
They made their way back to shore where Sherlock' s family was waiting for them. "They're staring at us," Sherlock complained.
“I do. I don’t ever want to see you again. You inconsiderate psychopath.”
"What?"
"I wanted to be more."
John smiled at him reassuringly. "You're perfect," he said.
John was practically ripping Sherlock's clothes off, unable to get them off fast enough. He successfully stripped Sherlock down to his underwear before giving him a shove towards his bedroom. John was shedding his own clothes along the way.
"Moriarty," he answered. "I'm fine."
He snuck out for a smoke when his parents weren't paying attention. He needed the nicotine to calm him down. His mind was racing and it was overwhelming.
Now John was pretty sure his heart did stop. This had to be a joke. Right? Sherlock didn’t look like he was joking. Not at all. “Why?”
“This is crazy. This is absolutely crazy.”
"I would like that," she said, grinning like the Cheshire cat.
After dinner, Mycroft waited until they were not within hearing range of their parents before he approached his brother and John.
“Oh…” Sherlock said and he kind of squirmed beneath John.
"Fireflies," John announced suddenly, pointing towards the woods.
Sherlock’s eyes flew open suddenly. “I can’t breathe,” he gasped.
"Let's get back to the cabin," John suggested. "I'm hungry for lunch."
It was not easy to swallow the fact that if he wished to remain friends with John, it meant putting up with Mary. Still, he would do it for John. He would pretend that he could accept Mary. Hopefully John would wisen up and get rid of Mary before she could cause too much damage. But in the meantime he would pretend. He was good at lying. He did it all the time. John was right about that.
"My list is on the back." Did John always have to be that slow? Would he have to explain everything to him forever?
"Yes, he does."
John shook his head, exasperated. “I can feel it! I can feel your erection.”
"I have. It tastes like maple syrup. It's good. Try it."
"Can you describe him at all?"
Could you even call it a relationship? Sherlock didn't think so.
As soon as they were in the car together Sherlock announced "She's a liar."
Sherlock frowned. "I never said I was a hero. Tell me, Mary, who are you really?"
John was in control. Sherlock was a mess beneath him, helplessly aroused and breathing heavy. It was incredibly sexy. He moved his hand slowly, teasing Sherlock, torturing him. Sherlock moaned louder.
"I don't like Mary," he could agree with that part at least.
Sherlock stared at John, contemplating his answer. “Sometimes,” he admitted. “Sometimes I dream about you.”
"Of course not. What kind of party would that be?"
“Of course.” He needed to get control of himself. Was he really so starved for affection that he was happy to kiss John? What was wrong with him?
"We have to," John told him. "Its something a real couple would do and find romantic."
They were staring into each other’s eyes now. Sherlock considered his next move. He remembered Mycroft’s warning to not get involved and he disregarded his brother’s advice as he often did. He knew he should just go view the wedding and be happy for John. But he couldn’t. He couldn’t keep wondering what if… He had to do this. He had to have closure. He closed the last bit of distance between himself and John.
"Perhaps we will see each other again."
Sherlock likes the comforting weight of the old quilt at night. But John seemed to get too hot beneath the blankets in the middle of the night, becoming restless, changing position as frequently, and inevitability kicking all blankets off. This meant that Sherlock usually woke feeling chilly and slightly vulnerable to see John lying peacefully on his back with his abs exposed due to his shirt sliding up.
“You really are an idiot.”
“Your family would really be happy to think that you and I were together romantically?”
"You're a doctor."
"Just stop," He begged.
The boy's mother shook her head. "No, he wouldn't run away. He wouldn't do this and let us go on worrying about him. I'm afraid something terrible has happened to him."
Sherlock kind of panicked. Because even though John knew now that he was transgender, he wasn't comfortable with his own body. It was too feminine. What if John didn't like him as much when he saw his body?
John was alone on New Year's Eve. He passed on offers to attend any parties, not quite in the holiday mood. He simply told everyone that it just didn't work out with Sherlock. He almost wished things had been different between him and Sherlock. He was unlike anyone John had ever met. He found it exhilarating being around Sherlock. He was a fascinating and devastatingly handsome man. John thought maybe this was why he couldn't find a real date, his taste in men was a bit... different.
"What? What's the problem, Sherlock? I don't understand!"
"What happened?" John was now concerned, closing his laptop and moving to sit in a chair closer to him.
“It’s okay,” John reassured him. “I don’t often talk about my sexuality but I’ve always been attracted to both men and women. I’ve had relationships with both.”
"What? Oh...wow..." John seemed taken aback by this. Sherlock had never had sex with anyone and John knew that. John knew almost everything about him. "Did you... have sex, I mean?"
"We'll figure this out," John promised her. "We'll find him."
"You're married."
Occasionally he had found men who were interested in him but more often than not they looked at him like a fetish or they wanted more from him than he was willing to give. He didn't want a relationship that consisted solely of sex. He wanted something more but feared that he'd never have it.
"I feel the same about you."
John grinned and Sherlock couldn’t be more confused.
"I am. But so are you," he admitted.
John looked at the woman, at the dirt on her knees from falling and the mascara stains on her cheeks from crying.
“John…” This was uncomfortable. Sherlock wanted this to be over. He wanted things to be like they used to be. But that didn’t seem to be possible anymore.
John nodded too. "Okay."
John hadn't even noticed the bruising, too distracted by the large gash that sliced her throat open.
"Don't you want to come swimming with me?"
“We have some leads, right?”
Sherlock hesitated, meeting his gaze then looking away. "You don't have time for me anymore. You're married and having a child and I can't... that's... I'm happy for you John."
"My god, Sherlock! Just tell me!" John was going insane trying to figure out what was going on in Sherlock's head.
“Perhaps.”
"I'm going to teach you how to fish."
Sherlock again made a face. "Really, John..."
"Where exactly did you last see him?" Sherlock asked.
“John!” Sherlock cried out helplessly, lost in pure ecstasy.
John seems embarrassed. "It won't happen again."
John rubbed his thumb over the tip of Sherlock’s dick.
"Right," John sounded unsure if he should be worried or not, thrown off most likely by Sherlock's calm reasonable tone.
"John..." Sherlock says, looking unsure.
"Oh... " Sherlock thought of all his interactions with Molly and wondered if he'd missed something. Was she really in love with him? Why?
“I’m sorry, John.” He really was sorry. Not that he’d helped get Mary arrested, because she deserved that. He was sorry that John had to have his heart broken this way. John was a good man, the best Sherlock had ever known, and he deserved better. He deserved someone as special as him who would make him happy. He hated seeing John hurting like this.
"Mary and I are dating again."
John soon came in and walked over to him. "Sherlock," his voice was full of concern. "Look at me."
John was leaning down, kissing his neck, burying his face against him as his movements slowed and he moaned with his own orgasm. Sherlock wrapped his arms around him and held him close as they both caught their breath.
“That’s… that’s a rather personal question, John.”
Sherlock later brought this up to John. They had found their way back to 221B. Mrs. Hudson was at John’s house babysitting. John had needed time alone with Sherlock after everything that happened with Eurus Holmes.
"Why would he ask you?" Sherlock questioned. "Do you sell marijuana? Have you ever provided him with marijuana before?"
Mycroft sighed, but he didn’t seem surprised. After a moment he said “I believe I can help with that.”
"Four days before he went missing," She said finally.
It's been quite a while since John got any action and there's something even sexier about it being Sherlock of all people. Sherlock Holmes the great detective, Sherlock Holmes who had never shown any interest in anyone, wanted him. Sherlock was extraordinary and John was so very average but for some reason Sherlock was attracted to him.
"You think that I should end things with him?" Sherlock asked, searching John's face for the answers.
“John,” Sherlock moans his name.
“When I said sex doesn’t alarm me.”
John looks hurt and confused and worried all at the same time. "Tell me what's wrong."
"Yes?"
Sherlock suddenly felt guilty. "Sometimes I need to alleviate boredom."
John gave a sleepy chuckle. “Okay.”
Sherlock never really thought that he would be this close to John’s penis. That he could actually touch John so intimately. He hesitated, nervous. He’d never touched anyone this way. He’d touched himself but it was always quick, like a chore, just to relieve the tension. John’s body was perfect, every single inch of him. Sherlock loved John’s muscular thighs, the scars that all told stories, the trail of golden hair on his lower belly, his thick cock which was hard and dripping precum. Sherlock impulsively wrapped a hand around the base of John’s cock and licked at the tip to taste his precum. John moaned louder. “Sherlock…”
Sherlock opened his mouth to say something then thought better of it. He sighed instead. John glared at him, letting him know that he wasn't going to let this go. He finally answered. "I did this because of you."
"We'll come back to talk to him then," John said quickly.
"Let me help you," he said, reaching for some aloe lotion. "This will help."
"She was attacked from behind," Sherlock continued. "She wasn't expecting it."
John couldn’t help but laugh. “I’ll shave my mustache.”
"There!" Sherlock cries out. "Just like that... please..."
John raised an eyebrow. "You've got his phone records?"
Sherlock’s eyes went wide. Was he dreaming this? His heart raced as he tried his best not to stare at John. John traced an old silver scar on his thigh, showing Sherlock where he’d been stabbed long ago.
"No, but I figured he was meeting up with some of his guy friends and would use one of theirs."
"Mike told you?"
Sherlock can’t hold on. “John!” He shudders a little with the intensity of his orgasm.
"Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?" Sherlock interjected.
"Its nothing like that. It was just John."
"Maybe the landlord is the killer," John suggested. "Maybe he got so angry about the money she owed him."
John stares at him, trying to understand. Eventually he begins to put the pieces together. He thinks of how Sherlock got distracted and stared at him shirtless just now and how he suddenly decided to bring up the moaning at this exact moment.
Just after dinner, a call came from Lestrade. "What the fuck are you two up to now?" He demanded loudly as John put his cell phone on speaker so that they could both listen.
"Its disgusting," Sherlock said, starting the car.
"So what happened then?"
Sherlock cut him off there. “I’ve never.”
John was already in bed, wearing athletic shorts and an old army tee shirt. “This bed is really comfortable,” he said happily.
The two men discussed a few theories about the murderer on the way back to the cabin, sure to check that no crime bloggers were lurking nearby. Sherlock was silent as they ate dinner, glaring at Mycroft across the table. John carried the conversation cheerfully, careful to keep the topics neutral.
"The boy was a cheater. Like Irene."
Sherlock nodded. "I agree."
Sherlock shook his head. "I'm fine," he insisted.
"Wow... this boy has a lot of admirers."
"I have a wife and a baby on the way! If you'd have told me..."
“No,” John admitted, shaking his head. “I don’t.”
"I can see her out the window," Sherlock admitted.
After dinner, Sherlock whispered to John. "I don't think convincing Mycroft is going to be as easy as I'd hoped."
Sherlock searched the crowd for John’s face. Finally he saw him in the distance and his breath caught in his throat. John was smiling and shaking someone’s hand. He looked as handsome as ever in his own fancy suit, face freshly shaven for pictures.
John paused. “Seriously?”
They spent the rest of the afternoon talking and they exchanged cell phone numbers. John texted him later that night. No one had ever really shown interest in Sherlock before but he was pretty sure that John was flirting with him. It was confirmed when John told him that he was cute.
Sherlock steepled his long fingers under his chin as he silently considered the new facts and possibilities.
"I'm ready," Sherlock said without any doubt in his voice.
Sherlock nodded quickly. “Clearly.”
"Then how do we get more information?"
He made it all seem so simple. Maybe Sherlock was stressing over nothing.
He walked into the coffee shop and looked at the man Mike wanted him to meet. He was breathtakingly gorgeous. Before he could think of anything good to say, the man was speaking. "Afghanistan or Iraq?"
"He could be. It's still also possible that he ditched his phone and ran away."
He tugged John’s briefs down and off. John’s cock was perfect like the rest of him, not too big and not too small. His blond pubic hair was neat and trim. Sherlock watched, mesmerized as precum dripped from the tip of his erection. He had a sudden urge to taste it but was unsure how John would react. Besides, he was too excited and too impatient and too drunk to bother with much foreplay. “See anything you like?” John asked him.
They sat together on the bed and Sherlock picked at his food absentmindedly while spouting theories. Was the text message true? Was he injured? Did he hit his head and get confused? Did he wander off somewhere? Or was the text message another charade? Maybe an excuse to avoid girlfriends crossing paths? Was he injured and taken advantage of by someone because of his wounds that possibly left him defenseless? Did a bear get him? Why was there no sign of this boy yet? Why had there been no more text messages? Maybe he had some type of plan to run away with this girl who he had to keep a secret due to her age?
"I'm buying a box!" John declared cheerfully, giving him a quick kiss on the cheek before hurrying off to the cash register.
John grinned at him. "I'd like that very much."
After ending the call, they both got ready for bed. "I'm sorry," Sherlock apologized. "We'll set the record straight somehow after this vacation."
Sherlock nodded. "I think that I've only settled because I've been afraid no one else would want me. I tried to make it work but it was foolish. I decided to end my relationship with him. We are no longer together now."
‘I’m not having sex with that girl,’ John thought to himself. ‘I don’t even like her. I’m not having sex with anyone at all lately.’ But this didn’t seem to be about John at all. It seemed like Sherlock was trying to confess to him something important about himself so John tried to focus like a good friend should. If Sherlock was having some type of problem then he wanted to help him.
"I don't want to hear any excuses. Just make sure no one else sees You with her or you''ll ruin everything. We're still supposed to be a couple."
“Trust me, I’m sure,” John cut him off and both men fell completely silent for several moments.
Rosie ran up to the table and climbed atop a chair in front of one of the plates and stuffed a whole slice of apple in her mouth.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson,” he uttered and she tutted at him.
Sherlock let his legs fall to the side and pulled himself up. He felt lightheaded, almost dizzy, as he stood up, but the moment passed. From inside the bathroom, he heard John turn the taps on, the groan of the pipes as the hot water worked its way from the furnace through the old building, and into the tub.
Chapter 1
When they were close enough that he didn’t have to raise his voice to be heard, he called out to them. “Are you decorating Sherlock, sweetheart?”
The man’s fingers quickly flew over the surface of his mobile again, and John heard the
He felt his presence before he saw him. That shiver that ran down his spine that had nothing to do with the cold wind that beat at him, the hairs at the back of his neck rising to attention. John wondered how many times over the past month he had felt that familiar feeling and misplaced it for someone watching to harm him. It was a subtle difference, and it had been so long since he had felt it and had never expected to feel it again, that he thought that afforded him some room in making a wrong assumption.
“Of course not, my phone is off,” he grumbled, eyes scanning around him at all the people now sending annoyed looks their way.
Then Sherlock was off again without a word. John was once again left behind, confused and frustrated. The police eventually left when they realized Sherlock wasn’t going to be coming back as he apparently had a well-known habit of just taking off like that.
“Whoa, Watson, settle down. You’re completely filthy,” he chided and plopped her on his knee without any regard to his fine clean clothes or the mud all over her, and completely ignoring John’s aborted attempt to remind him of that fact. “Did you find anything interesting?”
John released his foot and Sherlock reached for hands, pulling him close and guiding them down the hallway to the bedroom. John watches his face, the way his eyes keep sweeping over John, and he feels the arousal that had ebbed slightly when he hit the table come back under that burning gaze.
John was giving him the space that he needed, that John knew he would need, to process everything. It was just one of the many things that Sherlock loved about John.
“Beautiful,” John whispered reverently. “You’re absolutely stunning.”
“How so?”
He wrote down the last name on his list.
“Come on, John, why not?”
Sherlock tasted of the scotch they shared, the rich chocolate of the cake, and John wanted more. He wanted to taste Sherlock, the essence of him, and his hands flew to his trousers where he quickly worked open the belt at his waist. He pushed forward, landing on his knees in front of Sherlock, and he wanted to fulfil the fantasy that Sherlock had shared. He wanted to see Sherlock come undone under his hands and mouth.
Was it already December, then?
It is not gentle or kind. It is burning. John feels as if he is on fire and every touch of Sherlock’s hands on his skin raises the flames higher. Hands are everywhere, shirt buttons coming undone to reveal more, touch more, and John is suddenly being held between their front door and Sherlock’s body. It’s a good thing, too, because John isn’t sure he would be able to stand without support at the moment.
“Honestly, I don’t know if she’ll notice a difference. You’ve always been there. Nothing will change for her.”
She put the tray down on the table and started to pour tea for them both. John accepted the cup absently as he sat back down in his armchair.
“Well you aren’t exactly scary,” John said sarcastically.
“Not dead,” Sherlock spoke, so quietly John almost missed it, and John felt his fist slam down on the tabletop without his permission.
Perhaps it was even colder than usually in the room. Goosebumps ran up his arms and the hair on the back of his neck stood on end as he looked for Sherlock. Why was it so quiet? Where was Sherlock? Or Molly? Anyone?
“One mo’, Rose,” John replied and turned to Sherlock. “You coming?”
That reminded John what was currently taking up residence in his fridge and he frowned. There would be time to remind Sherlock that certain things needed to be kept in certain locations. Maybe he would buy Sherlock a mini-fridge, just for whatever takes his scientific fancy. He could put up with the experiments, but that didn’t mean he needed to see them every time he wanted milk.
His favorite, though, came as a surprise to him. John had always been happy with a fried egg (even a poorly prepared one like he used to make) and sausage with beans on toast. It was something familiar and comfortable, and it was still the one he mostly fell back on. Then Mrs. Hudson introduced him to poached eggs.
Sherlock’s brows arched up, but he didn’t reply or even open his eyes as John settled down in his chair and bit into one of the ginger nuts.
He had known Sherlock for real, just as John had. He just hadn’t had the luxury of being able to defy anyone who believed otherwise.
John was saved from answering by Rosie’s arrival back into the kitchen, hands and feet dirty, with no sign of her shoes anywhere.
“You can’t just keep changing the game, you know.”
“Nope,” he said as he wrapped the blanket firmly around him.
John had watched carefully as Mrs. Hudson explained each step of the dish she made. How to poach the egg and time it for a perfectly runny yolk, sliced ham, and the sublime revelation that turned out to be a sauce known as hollandaise that turned out to be even more egg yolk perfection.
“It was a date,” Sherlock says softly, his tone the same as when he’s deducing a crime scene and the pieces of the puzzle are all falling into place. John holds his gaze and something shifts in his friend’s eyes. Something shy and uncertain, but there was a heat there that caused John’s breath to quicken in response, and if he felt overwhelmed by Sherlock’s proximity before, then he was now drowning in it.
“Do you know when Mrs. Hudson will be back so I can sign my name on the lease?” John asked as he reached Sherlock. The taller man waited for him just outside the door with the gleaming 221B inlaid on its face.
John stares at his friend for several moments. Sherlock looked completely serious as he listed off qualities of Rosie that John would attribute to Sherlock rather than him.
When he heard the water for the shower turn on he opened the laptop and waited impatiently while it booted up again. As soon as the screen was opened, Sherlock once again took in the visage of an incandescently happy John Watson. After a moment of indecision, he quickly copied the link for the page and emailed it to himself, then deleted the search history on the laptop. Luckily John wasn’t exactly the most tech-savvy and that would be more than enough to hide his internet trail.
He stood staring at the grave for several moments before his brain registered what was different about the familiar scene before him. His flowers had been removed, and in their place were purple hyacinths and white tulips. They were perhaps a day or two old.
One chocolate drip made it past his attempts to clean, though, and fell right on top of Sherlock’s knee. John reached out automatically with the napkin to spot clean the chocolate and barely heard the sharp intake of breath from the man.
“What about me?”
“Wait. Is this your parent’s home?” John asked.
John stared at the obvious hallucination standing in his kitchen doorway. He had clearly had too many of those cranberry gin things and needed to sleep off the alcohol. His heart was thumping so hard in his chest that it hurt and he closed his eyes, forcing himself to take a deep breath, before opening them again.
“Your gift.”
“Jesus, Sherlock. How did you even manage to do that?”
“I beg you to stop teasing me as you suck me through my pants. You’re kind, though, John. You don’t make me wait. You push my pants down and stare at me. At my cock. At how hard I am for you. The things you do to me. You put your mouth on me, taking me deep, and your eyes stay on mine the whole time.”
Besides, he had a lot on his mind, and talking about things helped, sometimes.
“Yeah, fine, idiotic question,” John agreed, pushing to stand on his feet and carefully fixing his shirt, aware of Sherlock’s eyes on him and the accompanying smirk on his face.
“Why? As long as he makes sure to take proper precautions he should be fine. He’s very...clean. I mean, he always washes his hands and he smells nice,” Molly snapped her mouth shut as if she just realized what she said and to who. John decided to ignore it. He was well aware of how nice Sherlock smelled, and couldn’t exactly fault her for pointing it out.
John put up a placating hand. “No, of course I know that. I know. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean for you to feel like I thought you would do that.”
John laughed and Sherlock joined in a moment later. Then he straddled John in his chair, and the laughter died in John’s throat. Sherlock settled himself carefully in John’s lap and brought his hands up to his face. He leaned in and brought their mouths together, but this was nothing like the first kiss. It was demanding. It was the press of greedy lips, open mouths, hot tongues that slid against each other. Hands pulled and tugged in an effort to get the other closer. Breathing may be boring, but kissing was not, and breathing was required for kissing. John pulled away panting, his eyes locked on Sherlock. Kiss swollen lips and disheveled curls. He had never been more beautiful than he was right now.
He frowned thoughtfully at the display and a moment later found himself pushing the door open and the small tinkling sound of the bell rang through the shop above his head.
Sherlock snorted and John flicked his eyes at his fiancé with a small smile.
“Oh yeah, your skin and bones turn into something beautiful. Do you know, you know I love you so…” he started singing to himself as he poured hot water over two tea bags in mugs. Then he blinked and went over to watch his flatmate at the window.
John seemed interested in the flat, despite his comment on the mess. Sherlock started sorting out papers and shoving them into neater piles. He could be tidier if he needed to be.
“Then please trust me when I say that I have forgiven you.”
She went out to her living room and fussed about with her advent wreath. She would light the last candle tonight and get the story from them over some mulled wine.
Not that he really felt that way, of course. There was absolutely nowhere else he would rather be. As he watched Sherlock scoop Rosie up into his arms, dancing her around the living room between the chairs and tables as he whispered something in her ear, he also knew there was no one else he wanted to spend his life with. He ended his call and put his mobile on the kitchen counter before he walked into the living room where his friend and daughter danced.
“Of course you can, dear. You’re a capable man.”
John’s feet stopped responding to his instructions to walk as he came into the center of the room, his eyes quickly scanning the area in surprise. There were vases covering every available surface, and some not available ones, filled with flowers. The scent of the blooms overpowered even the sharp, citrusy scent of the pine that had been present for the month.
“The door should be unlocked. Mummy had the kitchen stocked this morning,” Sherlock told him as they turned to walk up the path.
Granted, he had tried, in the beginning. Sherlock had shut him down swiftly and John could admit, now that the sting had faded to distant memory, with all the kindness that he had believed Sherlock could be capable of at the time. He knew that wasn’t the truth, now. Sherlock was capable of so much more depth of emotion than he ever showed. John had watched him actively hide it during their friendship, and then he had died before John ever got the courage to take another chance.
“I didn’t know you could cook anything like that,” John said, and Sherlock gave him a small smirk.
“Sorry to wake you up. I didn’t mean to interrupt your sleep, Joy-girl.”
He knew now how wrong he had been as a younger man. Love wasn’t the virus that he needed to avoid at all costs. It was the cure to the sickness of the world. His love for John made him brave. It made him want to be better, to do better.
“We both care for Sherlock. We want what is best for him. He doesn’t always make the best choices when it comes to that, but he chose to return to London and to Baker Street. He’s going to be needed in the days to come. The threats that rise against us.”
Once the water boiled, he poured it in his mug over the teabag to steep. He turned in place, mug on the counter behind him, and found his gaze once more on his laptop. The screensaver was on, some image of a waterfall he had randomly selected years ago, and the image reminded him that he should probably take a shower some time today. Maybe after his tea.
John was the only one to ever put flowers on his grave. Occasionally Mrs. Hudson would accompany him and they would leave flowers together, but otherwise, it was just him. He had thought Molly at least would visit, but if she did, she never left anything behind. Everyone grieved in their own way, he supposed. He knew he was the only one though because when he would go to visit, his would be the only ones there from his previous visit, and he would trade out the dead ones for a freshly cut bouquet.
“Yeah, Sherlock.  Of course, I forgive you.”
“About 30 times an hour,” Sherlock mumbled under his breath, and John smiled at the petulant expression on his face.
Nothing new. The same conversations had with the same kinds of people, no matter what their faces looked like. It was all just the same as before.
“This is yours,” he said with a small smile, and John put down his boxes to take it from him.
“No, thank you,” he said. She stepped up to him and placed a small hand on his shoulder. Gave a gentle squeeze.
“Not really. I was thinking about reading that book you bought on apiary practices.”
“May I join you?”
“Soup should be ready,” he said before he stood up and got two bowls down and filled them. As he placed one of the bowls down in front of him Sherlock sneezed again.
No. Better to bury this down and continue on, as before. Sherlock couldn’t make him happy, but there was someone who did, once upon a time. Someone who could do it again. He pulled his mobile from his pocket and fired off a quick text to John.
John’s heart ached in the best of ways as he watched the two people he loved most in all the world. A love that was spoken aloud endlessly for one and unspoken for the other. Well, that wasn’t entirely true. He had told Sherlock he loved him, years ago. He had told him when he asked him to be his best man at his wedding to Mary. “The two people I love most in the world,” he had said in the kitchen of 221B. He had lied to himself for so long at that point that he actually had believed that. That he loved them both equally and that he could have them both.
“I’m still not completely sure, but you’re welcome to ask him again.”
Maybe it wasn’t sun or Rosie, then. John pushed the thought from his mind, that line of thinking leading down a dangerous road, and he cleared his throat before giving a more forced smile than he had previously had.
John put his mug and plate down on the table beside him. Sherlock put down his own plate and mug and stood up. He took the two steps to stand in front of John’s chair and carefully placed his hands on the arms of John’s chair before he leaned down further into John’s personal space.
There may be a little New Years' sequel to this story. I think they might have more to tell.
He wasn’t sure if he had managed to keep it, but he hoped the paper would be enough of a distraction.
Sherlock sat quietly and watched his friend. He knew what John had said. Heard it multiple times over the years. Always a denial of what others suggested about him. Sherlock never admitted it, but each denial had always felt like a paper cut being sliced through his skin. He didn’t begrudge John his sexuality. Of course, he didn’t. A person is what they are regardless of how another person felt about them. It didn’t mean it didn’t hurt when you were constantly reminded that you would never be what someone wanted because of something you had no control over. He took a breath and told John what the man himself always said.
“Indeed we did. He’s up in Rosie’s room as we speak,” Sherlock said with a smile towards Rosie, who nodded vigorously as she grabbed a carrot stick.
, John thought, as blood rushed from his brain to his fastly filling cock. Sherlock speaking was better than any porn he had ever watched, any sex he had ever had. And they had barely touched.
“I met his ex,” he said to the table as he picked at the paper hand protector on his to-go cup. “Came to us for a case, actually. A rather boring one, too.”
John shook his head, clearing the last of the crumbs, then ruffled Sherlock’s hair with his hand, sending his locks into complete disarray.
“The fish, John.”
“Perfect,” Sherlock said and followed her out of the lab and out of Bart’s.
“Sherlock,” John sighed. “You haven’t messed anything up.”
“You look good, Johnny. Happy. Sherlock seems like a good influence on you.”
“Hm?” John asked, unable or unwilling to articulate more than that.
“John,” he spoke softly, and when John didn’t look up, he said his name again louder.
“Yes.”
“One moment. I’m almost done wrapping this gift. Don’t know how I missed it.”
His hand wrapped around the back of John’s warm neck, long fingers brushing against the short strands there, and John relaxed into into his hold. Sherlock smiled and let his thumb brush against John’s earlobe.
John lowered his glass as he realized how close Christmas was. He had had no plans for Christmas beyond that work do he already attended. He had already posted Harry’s gift rather than visit, and Mrs. Hudson had plans to visit her sister for a week starting Christmas Eve.
Sherlock shook his head and shrugged in reply.
“Where do you even find these kinds of flowers in the middle of winter in London?” he finally asked, because he didn’t know what else to say, and the silence that had been growing between them felt suffocating.
“I don’t know your favorite color.”
Oddly, it wasn’t an awkward silence. And considering it was happening while John showered and Sherlock sat on the closed lid of a toilet, that was saying something. When he was about to shut off the water, Sherlock’s voice drifted through the curtain.
It didn’t help that Sherlock Holmes looked like a damn movie star with his porcelain skin, sharp cheekbones, and mocha curls, which just added to the feeling of surreality.
He tossed back the rest of his scotch and set his glass down on the table beside his chair. Sherlock was still as he continued to sit quietly and John was content to live in that moment and the fantasies his mind provided.
“She definitely is.”
The song had entered into an instrumental interlude as John began to lead him in a slow sway to the music rather than a waltz. John’s hand was warm and dry in his own, the one on his back was steady, and applying gentle pressure as he pulled their bodies closer.
Sherlock smiled at his giggle and John let it fade with a shake of his head.
