“Someone is too excited to get to the sex under the tree,” Cas laughs but grabs the final present for Dean.
Lisa had continued High School and went on to get a college degree in education, which she only got to use for a few years as a first grade teacher. Dean got his G.E.D. and started working at a local mechanic shop. When the man retired, he offered to sell it to Dean cheap. He had been his own boss ever since. Dean went on to talk about Ben and how proud he was of his son, even though he hadn’t done so well in school these last few years. Though he had three years to work through losing his mom, the older he got, the harder it seemed to get in some ways for him.
“That would be nice,” Castiel reached into his back pocket and pulled out his wallet as he made his way over to Dean’s window. He then pulled out a white card and handed it over. “Here is my card, the number on the back is my cell.”
The light touching quickly became wet and Dean’s entire body tensed up. Castiel’s tongue started at his lips, making its way down his neck, to his chest, and across his stomach. Just when Dean thought he was going to take him into his mouth, Castiel pulled away. There was no touching. Dean needed him to touch him.
“I am so glad that you made it,” Sam pulled Dean under his arm and squeezed him. “I have a surprise for you.”
“Okay,” Dean agreed. “Can we have hot chocolate instead. Sorry, but that tea you drink is kind of gross. It tastes like tainted water.”
“Then be a good boy and get onto your knees,” Castiel instructed further. “You can hold yourself up on your arms too if you like or lay against the pillow, but I want that ass in the air, understand.”
"I am sure that I do not know what you are talking about, Dean." Cas cocked his head to the side. Dean could picture every time Cas had done that simple gesture. It was many more times than Dean had known Cas in this life.
“Take your glove off, you stupid,” Castiel instructs as he removes his own glove and tosses it into the trash. “I’ve been here before, but never like this.”
“Just a little gesture of I love you,” Dean admitted. “I feel like I haven’t done that as much as I should lately.”
Dean tried to look at the bright side. If Castiel was going to be there, he was sure that fun could be had, or at least he would have someone to talk to through all the lame party stuff. Plus, there was sure to be more alcohol there than there was here.
"That is good,” Grace smiled, checking Dean IVs. “The stubborn ones fight the hardest. If anyone can make miracles happen, my money is on the stubborn ones.”
Castiel started slow and Dean was nearly in tears. He needed to cum but Castiel was going to draw this out. Whatever lesson he was supposed to learn had not been taught yet, though, for the life of him, he couldn’t remember what that lesson was.
Cas lifted Dean a little higher and pressed himself against Dean. Dean was about to stop him, tell him that he needed lube and that Cas needed to work him open but before he could say anything, Cas was already inside of him.
“Now,” he says to the camera, “I am wearing a glove when I handle this thing, because I’m going to inevitably wipe…
“It isn’t wrong either,” Castiel defended. He didn’t believe that anything he was doing with Dean was wrong.
Dean hesitated slightly but pushed through it. He brought his hands up and hooked his fingers into the waistband and pulled. Cas lifted his hips to make it easier. Once Cas’ boxers were off and thrown onto the floor, Dean stood up from the bed. He removed his own boxers, tossing them aside and then climbed back onto the bed between Cas’ legs.
“Mmhmm,” Dean agrees again. “If you normally watch this show with your parents or even your kids, you may want to rethink that today because, well, this episode is about to get all kinds of awkward.”
“Good,” Dean says around a bite of ice cream. “Congrats, buddy. You are on the tag team. I don’t care.”
“That’s okay,” Dean got up from where he was sitting at the bar and motioned to a tall table in the back, sitting right beside a pool table, that lay vacant. “You want to play some pool?”
“No more than one or two a day,” Cas suggests, though he knows that if the pies last more than a week he’d be lucky.
“Really,” Castiel agreed with a nod. “However, we need to maybe take some time to think of other ways for you to handle situations like this when they arise, and they will arise quite a bit in your life, unfortunately.”
“No,” Dean grabbed for the door handle but did not turn to face Castiel. If he looked at him, he knew he would not be able to leave and he needed to leave. “We aren’t done. I just … I need to go for now. Okay?”
“Okay,” Dean moves into the episode, when all Castiel wants to do is back out and leave. “Last year, about a year ago, we made a video where we ate the world's hottest pepper - that we could find, which is the Ghost Pepper.”
“Oh, god,” Dean called out, his thrusts becoming slightly more erratic. “I am not going to last much longer.”
“Gentleman standing over by the door,” Benny pointed. “Said something about his car not sounding right.”

"Okay," Nurse Moseley brought herself to her feet. Had she been expecting something from Dean? Did she want him to protest? "I'll bring you dinner in a few hours. So, don't think I never did anything for you."
“Castiel huh?” Ellen had to think over the name a bit but she didn’t say anything. Dean could tell by the look on her face that she found the name to be odd. Hopefully the man was not as odd as the name but Dean was going to find out soon enough.
“So,” Meg turned away from Balthazar to address the rest of the group. “We all good? Everyone staying?”
He set the cup down, deciding that drinking coffee was not the best option at this time. He needed to keep his mouth clear.
Shrugging it off, Castiel heads back into the room and changes into his near pair of flannel pajamas. That was one of his favorite parts of the evening. He always bought them both a new set of matching flannel pajamas. Dean had protested the first year until Cas promised how much fun it would be to strip each other of them and make love under the tree after the presents were opened. Dean never complained about the pajamas again.
Dean tried to cover himself, but Cas had already seen him. Shit, not long ago, Cas had Dean’s dick in his mouth. This was nothing new for Cas. Suddenly, Dean became incredibly nervous. Shit.
“When you get where Dean?” Castiel wanted to understand and felt embarrassment that he didn’t. He knew that he was slower than most when it came to certain things but he really needed to understand.
Okay. Let me put it this way. You love Cas. You don’t love PENIS. But maybe, one day, once you get through the loving Cas part (1/2)
The fairy looked up at him and nodded before sitting himself down. It was at that moment that Castiel realized what he had just done. He had bought a fairy. What was he supposed to do with an injured fairy?
Dean doesn’t cry this time. Instead, they both lie there, listening to the other breathing. The silence between them saying more than words could. But the silence didn’t last. Castiel could hear the creaks but his mind couldn’t seem to place where any of the sound was coming from, his only concern being Dean. So, when his bedroom door slammed open and the light flicked on, he barely had time to react.
Another shift in the bed and a pop noise caused a burn to run through Dean’s body, his impatience eating away at him. Castiel had always been the one with all of the patience. And then there was cold, spread between his ass cheeks and pushing against the ring of muscles that Dean so badly wanted Castiel to breach, but he didn’t give it up that quickly. He moved his finger around, drawing lazy circles over and over until Dean was begging him for it.
“I see a smooth chest,” Castiel began to speak again as he ran his fingers slowly over Dean’s chest. “One that is groomed to look that way but would also look amazing if you let it grow out into something more. And I see a well-fed man, who isn’t fat but has just enough excess body weight to grab on to if need be.”
“It means that you don’t love me,” Dean answered. There was no way that Castiel loved him, not in the way that he loved Castiel.
“I am sorry that it took me so long to get here,” Castiel whispered over a sleeping Dean. He had completely become human a little over three years ago. Castiel had chosen Dean over everything else. Dean needed him and maybe he needed Dean just as much. That meant that it took him longer to do things. He could not pop in and out of nowhere. Worst of all, he could no longer heal Dean. He chose Dean and now he was losing him. Had he made the wrong decision?
“Dean?” Castiel pushed open the front screen and gave Dean a confused look. “What are you doing here?”
Sorry once again this took so long. I am a horrible person, I know. But hopefully this helps a little.
He made his way through his room, taking off his clothes as he went. He changed himself into his night clothes and made his way to the washroom to groom himself before bed. If there was one thing that Castiel prided himself on, it was cleanliness.
Dean reached out and took a hold of Castiel’s hand, leading him in the direction of his bedroom. This time it was Dean who got Castiel a towel and a dry change of clothes. This time it was Dean who waited for Castiel to get settled before wrapping his arms around him and pulling him close.
“I am going to go get a little air,” Dean let himself up from the couch and flashed his brother a smile. He did not want Sam to think that he was not having a good time, even though he wasn’t. He needed Sam to believe that all was going well, that way he could pass the news along to their mother.
"You always used to tell me I needed to learn personal space." Cas answered. "Now you are angry that I am respecting your wishes?"
"What happened in your dream Dean," Cas started but Dean cut him off, pulling him into a kiss that was nothing more than hard and desperate.
“We need some sort of countdown,” Castiel suggests. “Let’s be like ‘Be Your Angelical Best.’ Yeah, that makes me feel…”
“Works for me.” Meg accepted Dean’s answer. “Maybe we should all get some sleep and start fresh in the morning.”
“Be my guest,” Cas laughed before leaning in and closing the gap, his lips pushing firmly against Dean’s.
Dean had to find out more. He needed to know what happened to his brother and to himself. There had to be clues or answers out there for that night. No one told him anything beyond what he already knew, but there had to be more. How did he do it? No one had told him how his brother had died. And what happened to the hole in the ground?
Off in the distance, Dean could see something that resembled a house but as he got closer to it, he realized that it was a barn. There were no animals to signify that a barn should be here or a house for its owner to live, it was just a barn. It takes him forever to figure out how to get the door open, pushing and pulling with all of his strength and yet it does not budge.
Dean looked over at Bella sitting across the way. Once she noticed she was being looked at, she smiled up at him. She really was a stunning woman, even though she had to be at the least twenty-one and at the most twenty-three. Dean was not against younger women, he just had a kid and girls who were younger did not seem to appreciate that fact about him. Though, he was not asking the girl to be Ben’s new mom, he was just supposed to talk to her.
“Because I,” Castiel started to answer but he stopped. Why had he lied to his best friend for the last year?
As soon as he was finished, Dean headed home. He kicked off his boots, grabbed his one beer out of the fridge and settled onto the couch. There was not really a lot on but that did not stop him from picking up the remote and flipping through the channels. People used to get so mad at him. He was not really a person to sit and watch a whole show. He watched five minutes of one show and then two minutes of another. Nothing ever really caught his attention long enough for him to stick with it. In fact, the only time he ever sat through an entire show or movie was when he was watching it with someone else. Even then, he didn’t quite pay full attention.
“I really wanna push that boy's parents off of a play structure,” Dean began to vent as they crawled into bed that evening.
“I will find a way to fix you Dean,” Castiel tried to be more assertive in trying to reassure Dean but even he did not believe the words. Did he just give up? Castiel did not figure himself to be someone who gave up that easily. It took a lot to break down his missions and this was his most important one yet.
“Remember that time Sam fell in that hole,” Cas laughed, grabbing his side to keep from falling over, tears of laughter streaking the side of his face.
“Honey Bear Latte?” Dean asked, grabbing one of the coffee cups in front of him and handing it to Cas.
Thinking of Cas rubbing his ass quickly turned into Cas licking him open and then fucking him against the shower wall.
“Give it a shot,” Sam lightly punched his brother in the shoulder. “Plus, I already told her you were kind of interested.”
As if reading Dean’s mind, Cas worked to turn them, pushing Dean against the wall, before dropping to his knees in front of Dean. He looked up at Dean, eyes lust blown, the blacks parts almost so big you could no longer see the amazing blue they generally were. Fuck. He was so beautiful.
“If it gets bad,” Dean spoke as he pulled away and began to kiss down Cas’ neck, moving toward his chest. “Tell me, guide me.”
“Here we go,” Cas finally emerged from the kitchen and set the bowls down onto the table. He took his seat across from Dean and quickly reached for his beer, drinking half of it down before even making eye contact with Dean.
“Do you want to get back together with her?” Dean asked, shifting against the car. His hand brushed up against Castiel’s hand and everything stopped for a brief moment. All he could think was how badly he wanted Castiel to say no.
Dean took a deep breath and raised his hand in the air, balling it into a fist. It was almost midnight, so he hesitated slightly. Nothing about this was really a good idea, but he was not really on track for doing anything that was a good idea today anyway. So he pounded his hand lightly against the door, making sure it was hard enough to get to Castiel if he was upstairs but not loud enough to wake the neighbors.
“Please Cas,” Dean tried to buck his hips again but Cas was just strong enough to keep him from the action. “Please. I need you.”
“Fuck,” Dean hissed out when Castiel reached down and grabbed his cock into his hand and lightly stroked around the tip. He could feel himself leaking against Castiel’s fingers, causing it to slide over him with ease.
“I just wanted to let you know what was going on,” Principal Shurley informed him. “I think maybe you both talking with Claire about how people are going to have opinions on gay relationships and maybe how you both deal with those situations. Maybe to avoid her becoming violent in the future.”
“Here we have Bella Talbot,” Sam pointed to a brunette sitting in a corner chair, slowly drinking whatever it was in her cup. She had long brown hair that fell in curls over her shoulders, big eyes that seemed like they would help her get whatever she wanted and pouty lips. Dean made a mental note to avoid this girl. She looked like she could get him into some trouble. Though maybe he needed a little bit of trouble.
Dean laughed at their banter. It was good to be back to the way things were, even though they were different in so many ways … good ways. Maybe? Dean still was not sure. He knew that he wanted this, he did, but it was still new to him. Cas being something other than just his best friend was new to him. Dating a guy was definitely new to him. Being in love … yeah, how that happened, Dean still could not figure it out. Oh … and the whole penis thing. That was a ball park he never thought he would visit. No pun intended … never mind, pun completely intended.
“Not well,” Dean admitted, though it went worse than not well, it went horrible. “I ended up stopping it and leaving. She was pretty angry.”
They sat so far away that it was easy for them to not talk but today was going to be different. It was going to be the same amount of uncomfortable company, only this time there was going to be undesired dialogue to go with it. If anything, Castiel could not wait to be king so that he could send Michael away and never have to speak with him again. If only the time were now.
“Dean,” Castiel fought back tears and for a moment, Dean felt he had messed up. This was too much for Cas. He should have just gotten over himself. Why was he so stu … “I have loved you since the day you came up to me and said, ‘I’m Winchester, as in Dean.”
Castiel looked up from Dean and gave a smile to Grace, Dean’s main nurse. She was not really the main nurse, she just seemed to always be the one who was here whenever Castiel was around. Dean had been here for three months, working to get better. Castiel wanted to be by his side but he used his time to search over the earth for answers. Being an ex-angel did not give him an advantage. He was still empty handed and Dean was still dying.
Dean grabbed the towel and dried himself in the shower. As he finished up and stepped out, he was met by Castiel standing in front of the bathroom door, a smile on his face.
“Thanks,” Dean responded, a look of confusion on his face but no one pushed the subject any further.
“Really?” Dean laughed. “Mr. Holy Tax Accountant loved math in school? I never would have taken you for a numbers man.”
Dean pulled his truck to a stop around the corner from his house. He knew that if he made it home, he would be in for the rest of the night. So he was going to exhaust one more option before calling it quits for the evening.
“The people who help us make this show,” Dean continues, “who are not going to be eating these peppers, have decided that we should wait ten minutes without relief.”
“Just open the fucking door, Winchester,” Dean growled to himself, reaching out and turning to the knob.
Without thinking too much into it, Dean removed his shirt. He didn’t take his eyes off of the mirror, afraid of what would happen if he did.
Dean struggled to turn his head again until he was able to see Cas standing beside him. Had Castiel took him to the hospital when he passed out in his house? Maybe he was truly sicker than he thought if they were willing to admit him. But why did his body hurt so badly.
“If that is Dean,” Meg began, reaching down and grabbing for her clothes, “I am going to be pissed, Clarence.”
“So what brought you here?” Dean asked trying to carry on the conversation. “I mean, if you were a lifer, I feel like I would have seen you around before the other night.”
“You know what?” Castiel asks, leaning forward and looking down at the chocolate ice cream in front of him, Dean having stolen and already begun eating the vanilla. “I’m afraid of putting anything in there that’s gonna make everything come up.”
Dean continued to talk with Cas for the next couple of weeks. It was almost stupid; working to get to know someone you had known your entire life. It was a struggle at times to try and find new things to talk about. But Dean felt it was necessary. He was not ready to see Cas face-to-face just yet but he was almost not willing to lose him now. Though, he was still certain that it was not how Sam said it was. Sure, Dean’s feelings towards Castiel were far beyond that of just being friends with someone … but being in love? Dean had never looked at another guy in a non-platonic sort of way. So right now, he was just trying to figure out the way he could, or does, love Castiel.
“I am fine, Sammy.” Dean nearly growled but kept his voice under control. “He isn’t my personal doctor.”
Dean shook his head at Castiel but walked passed him and into the front walkway of Castiel’s house. It was dark inside, even though Castiel had turned on a light. There was not much around him, almost as if Castiel had not even moved in yet. It was possible that he did not get much stuff in the divorce, though by the way he described Meg, she really was not the type to want or have stuff. Maybe they just never had stuff.
The only upside was that it was a vamp nest. They could track it down, get in, gank them and be done. He would only have to spend a short amount of time with Cas and then he could head home and get away from the angel. He felt bad. He had been blowing Cas off a lot lately and he could see it in Cas’ face that he knew it was happening. He was not as chatty with Dean as he usually was. It made Dean feel like shit but he couldn’t help it. He’d tried for the longest time but he couldn’t seem to be around Cas without having horrible, amazingly delicious thoughts about the angel.
Castiel climbed out of bed, grabbing his boxers and sweatpants. He slipped them on clumsily as he made his way to the front door, Meg quickly appearing right behind him. He knew that an argument was going to come out of this, but he didn’t care. He wasn’t going to leave Dean standing outside in the rain.
Dean looked nervously over at his husband while they sat, waiting for the principal to arrive. He’d hated being called to the principal’s office when he was a kid and that feeling did not seem to be any less nerve-wracking now that he was a full-grown adult. Only this time, it was not him who was in trouble, it was their daughter, Claire.
“No wonder you aren’t married,” Dean muttered to himself as he pulled on his shirt so he didn’t have to look at himself any longer.
"I am sorry that you have lost this life, Dean." This was Cas' only response but Dean could tell that he wanted to say more.
They kissed slowly again. He was not sure how long it lasted, but he never wanted it to end. He never wanted any of this to end. But all good things come to an end and soon, Dean was pulling away. He wanted to reach out, hold him against his body and never let him go but he remained still.
“You have a hat with your freaking name on it,” Dean says again in a calmer and quieter voice. “You can do anything you want … reciprocate man!”
“But,” Dean takes over, noticing Castiel getting off track. “You can use water to help get it down if you’re having trouble getting it down. You can do that. It is part of the rules. If you need water to help you get it down, you can do that as opposed to throwing it back up or something.”
Dean continued to struggle against the weight that was crushing against him. His body was heavy and he was having no luck but he was eventually able to open his eyes.
Dean took a deep breath put his hands under Castiel, forcing him to lift up his hips so that he could pull his pants down. Dean pulled them down to his ankles and moved his hands back up the sides of Castiel’s legs. He felt his skin get goose bumps and that excited Dean again.
They made their way inside to the slighty, but not too badly, busy bar. Luckily, they spotted a booth toward the back that was vacant. That would give them the privacy they needed to talk but would also stop Ellen, or Jo for that matter, from eaves dropping on their conversation. All the needed to see was Dean and his best friend grabbing a few drinks, nothing more, nothing less. They could keep it cool.
Castiel made his way with his hand down to his stomach and then to his sides, grabbing hold of Dean’s hips tightly between his fingers.
Dean took a few deep breaths before rolling over, a slight moan escaping from him when his cock rubbed up against the sheets and pressed into the bed.
Dean looked back up at Castiel and watched as Castiel climbed onto the bed, fitting himself between Dean’s legs. He had a nervous smile on his face. Dean knew that this was probably not the easiest thing to do. They had been best friends for nearly twenty years and never once had anything sexual ever taken place between them. Still, with as strange as this started out and without them ever discussing it, this felt right. Castiel felt right in every way possible.
“You are going,” Sam informed him and Dean grumbled. Ever since they were younger they had been making each other do things they didn’t want to do. It was sort of an unwritten law among them. When one of the finalized it, unless they had a life or death excuse, they had to do it.
Dean appeared in the doorway of their bedroom. He leaned against the door, giving Cas a smile that made Cas’ heart flutter. Six years together and Dean still made him get butterflies. Whoever said that the honeymoon phase disappeared after a couple of years had never looked into Dean’s eyes and seen the way that Dean looks back at Castiel.
Dean tried to fight the jealousy that bubbled in his stomach. He couldn’t stand the thought of Cas with one of those women. If Cas was going to sleep with anyone, it needed to be someone better, someone worth Cas.
“You didn’t have to do that,” Castiel informed him. He stood up from where he was sitting and made his way over to Dean and allowed Dean to take him into his arms. “I know that you are stressed out with work.”
“Suit yourself.” The lady shrugged. “Lucky for you this one is broken. Won't be able to fly away from you if it wanted to.”
"As you know," Nurse Moseley had given him a pause to speak like she always did. Maybe she hoped he would same day answer. He never did. "It is two to a room. When Benny left, we noticed how hard you took it. I know you liked him. We decided then to give you some time. Unfortunately, we are limited in space."
Castiel continued to kiss down, bringing his lips over Dean’s boxers and kissing against his penis. Dean’s penis jerked at the wetness that Castiel’s mouth left behind and he grabbed at the door, looking for anything to hold onto so that he did not lose his footing when his knees gave out.
Dean worked to think back on the years. Cas and he had been inseparable since they were kids. Even with Cas being in and out of foster homes, Dean was always there. Dean had even taken the bus or had his mom drive him across town when they ended up in separate schools. Dean went out of his way to make sure he did not lose Cas and Cas … well, isn’t that what he did?
With that, the fairy, seeming to trust him a little more, stepped out of the cage and into Castiel's hand.
Dean thought it over for a second and then stepped in front of the mirror. Once he took all of himself in, he grimaced slightly. He used to enjoy seeing himself in the mirror but now it was just a reminder of how badly he had let himself go. Why would Castiel want to remind him of all of this?
"Dean?" A female's voice echoed through the house, pulling him back to one reality instead of the many racing through his mind. "Dean, what is going on? Ben was frantic on the phone."
A part of Dean appreciated that his son wanted to see him happy and do things. Another part of Dean was sad. He was sad that his son even noticed these things. Ben should not be seeing that Dean has no life. Ben should not be worried that Dean needs to get out of the house more. These were not things that your twelve-year-old kid needed to notice.
“I would imagine so.” He gripped Dean’s hand tighter. “How about I make us some hot tea and then we can call it a night? Then tomorrow, we will get started on finding the answers that you need.”
"You are in your house," his mother answered, reaching out to touch his forehead with her hand. "Are you feeling okay Dean?"
Dean sat up completely in his bed, sweat rolling off his forehead. That was the fifth time this month that he had, had this dream. It was always the same dream too. Nothing ever changed, from the way things looked to the way that it tasted and smelled. Yet every time it felt unfamiliar, as if it were all completely new to him.
“I know of the rules Anna.” Castiel offered her a smile but the worry did not diminish from her face. “I will not be gone long. There are things I need from the market and once I have procured them, I shall return.”
Castiel’s tongue found his skin again, starting at his ankle and making his way up Dean’s leg until it reached his thighs. He licked and bit at his now overly sensitive skin, causing what Dean assumed was a whimper but he couldn’t tell for sure if he was making noise or not. All he could hear was the sound of his heart pounding in his chest. Along with the silk surrounding his skin and the smell of apple pie. He was lost. And now Castiel’s mouth was wrapped around his cock.
“Don’t you dare apologize, Dean Winchester,” Castiel cut him off. “You know he got what he had coming to him. I am completely on your side. You did nothing wrong.”
Dean smiled up at Castiel, almost happy that Castiel could understand what was going on in Dean’s mind. Dean wondered if Castiel was as nervous as he was about this whole situation. He didn't appear to be nervous, but that did not mean he wasn’t.
“You get used to it,” Castiel forced a smile and Dean could tell that he did not agree with his own words. It was just what he told himself to help him work through it.
“Really?” Cas’ smile spread as far across his face as it literally could, his eyes coming to life and the blue twinkling in the parking lot lights that shown overhead.
“Please, Dean.” Castiel’s tone dropped from authoritative to something so small that Dean could not really place the emotion behind it. “I can not keep up this fight if you die.”
“Well let’s see,” Castiel began. “I am a teacher. I teach Religion. I am not really a religious person, not anymore anyways. My family is big on religion. We were the type of people who were at church every day for some reason or another. So when I decided to go to school to teach religion, they were not that happy about it. It would have been different if I was going to school to teach religion at an all Christian school and only taught the word of the bible.”
The drive from the creek back into town was a long one. He took every back road that he could think of, because even though he wanted to go home, he was not ready to be there yet. So, he was going to drive around, cool his jets for a while and get himself to relax. He also wanted to make sure that he avoided the cops, he was fairly certain that if he were to get pulled over, it would be a night in jail for him.
“Well you better fucking try,” Dean raised his voice. He did not want to yell, Cas had gotten enough of that in his life already, but Cas had fucked up and Dean had every right to be angry at him. “You have no way to explain how you pretended to be some chick online for a year? A fucking year Cas. I told you how I felt about her and you didn’t think maybe you should tell me it was you or cut it off then? What the fuck were you thinking?”
Before Dean could fully grasp what was happening, he was pulling Castiel toward him and pressing him against the impala. Not so hard as to do any damage to the impala, he still cared about the car, even though he wanted to take complete advantage of the man against it. His heart was racing in his chest as Castiel took his hand. Dean felt like he had not been touched in forever, even though he knew he had, but it was enough to make him weak in the knees.
“Of course I came,” Castiel shook his head and repositioned himself in his chair. “I told you on the phone that I would.”
There was a moment of silence while they both looked Dean over in the mirror. It was uncomfortable at first but soon, it becomes something a little more intense. Castiel was not simply looking him over, he was taking him in, devouring him with his eyes. Dean could feel his cheeks grow flush from the attention.
He had been eating healthier these days all thanks to his husband. Castiel did not want Dean working so hard he felt the living off of fast food was an option, so he had been packing his lunches. Dean was stupid. Castiel had been packing his lunches. He made sure dinner was done when he got home. He bought his favorite beer and kept the fridge stocked. He was taking care of him. He was showing Dean that he loved him. He wasn’t losing Castiel’s love.
“I did not cheat on you,” Castiel promised. “This is not what you think if you will just let me explain.”
Dean could feel the headache he had been carrying around for the last month fade away. His shoulders relaxed into the bed and he felt weightless. All the tension was melting into the sheets beneath him. He felt like he was engulfed in the silk. There was no pain, no stress, no noise. It was quiet.
"How long?" Dean asked, trying to keep his questions as short as possibly to minimalize the pain of talking.
“No,” Balthazar puffed himself up, trying to intimidate Dean. “Maybe there is a reason he didn't tell anyone about you. Maybe he was looking for a way out. And when he finally gets out, I'll be waiting.”
Dean was disappointed. He needed to get out but he did not want to do it alone. Charlie was his only option. He would have asked Sam but sadly, his little brother was no old enough to legally drink. Dean could not wait for the day to come.
Dean stands at the back of the set, lightly punching his fists repeatedly against the wall. Castiel is on the other side of the room, sitting on his knees and using the desk to hold him up. He can feel every orifice in his body sweating lava. He just wants to die.
Dean set his phone down and idly began to clean up his desk. He needed to keep himself busy or else he was going to start over thinking all of this. Maybe he should log back in and see if she was back online. They could work all of this out. Maybe it was an accident that she had logged out and she was just waiting for him.
Cas wondered so much about Dean as he looked over his fragile body. He looked physically better. The bruises had faded and the cuts were almost completely gone. It was the things on the inside that held all of the damage. Typical Dean, keeping all of the pain on the inside.
Dean cried out as Castiel dropped back down and took his cock into his mouth, swallowing him down. He’d had many blowjobs in his life but Castiel’s mouth wrapped around him was another experience entirely. It was like he fit perfectly. And the way Castiel sucked and licked and took all of him nearly pushed Dean over the edge. He was holding on by a string, being held back by Castiel.
“Your son?” She seemed to get less angry with him but more disgusted, like it was a horrible thing that he had a child. That is why he never shared that part of his life with people he barely knew. Though now it was helpful. Her reaction to him having a son was enough to make him not feel bad about what he was doing to her.
Dean read the message with a smile, soon realizing it was Sam. That did not take away his smile. He loved hearing from his little brother. Sam was also a busy person, so most of the time, text was the only way he heard from his brother for weeks.
“Let’s go in the back,” Dean suggested as they pulled up to the house the vamps were hunkering down in. The sun had just come up, perfect time to catch them off guard.
"Okay," she finally allowed defeat to claim the day as she turned off the recorder. "We will try again another day. Just know, that when you are ready to talk about what happened, I am here."
Both Castiel and Meg jumped by the knock coming from the front door of Castiel’s apartment. It was two in the morning and storming outside. There was no need for anyone to be at the door. Which meant that it was Dean. The number of nights Dean showed up at Castiel’s house when it rained became less and less over the years. Dean no longer lived with his father. But sometimes, just the sound of rain was enough to put Dean in a panic and Castiel seemed to be the only one who could calm him down.
“I would like that,” Castiel’s smile beamed from ear to ear and once again Dean’s heart began to race and his stomach began to turn.
Dr. Mills looked over at the now teenager sitting in the chair on the other side of her desk. He never looked anyone in the eyes, always looking to his hands, his feet or the floor. It had been six years and still, no one had been able to break through to him. But Dr. Mills never stopped trying. Part of it because it was her job and another part because, somewhere deep down inside, she knew that he could be saved. He was just a scared child.
“I am sorry,” Dean worked to get out but he couldn’t turn off how turned on he was. “I didn’t know you knew I was thinking those things.”
“First time for everything,” Dean whispered to himself as he leaned down and licked at the side of Cas’ cum covered cock.
Dean nodded, pulling blankets back so that he could remove his sweats and boxers, leaving him naked on their bed, while Castiel was still wearing his evening clothes.
“Dean!” Sam’s voice yelled out over the yard of the fraternity house. It was littered with little red cups and college student’s laughing and having a good time. College seemed to be the only place where people could get away with things like that. Fraternities had their own laws in the world of college. If the cops were called, something seriously bad was going down. Maybe they figured that good college students couldn’t get into too much trouble. They were wrong but turning the other cheek was a thing with cops around here.
“Doesn’t mean I am going to heaven,” Dean stared off at the wall on the other side of the room. “I don’t really deserve heaven. I’ve done more bad things that I would like to think about. Those things don’t get people into heaven.”
Dean spent six more weeks in the hospital. His body was healed but it was the weakness from being in the hospital bed for so long that had made him hurt. He had to go through hours of physical therapy in order to get his strength back. And even with that, he was nowhere near where he used to be. He was still thin and would need to continue with physical therapy in order to completely build up his muscles. He even had to relearn how to eat after being on a liquid IV diet.
Before he could contemplate whether or not to go inside, Dean was waving him in. Shit. Maybe he didn’t have to tell him. He could go in and Dean could confide in him about being stood up by Jimmy. He could comfort Dean and then he could wait the rest of his life to die and go to hell, where he obviously belongs.
“I am incapable of getting drunk,” Cas informed him. “Well, unless I drink a whole liquor store, but I don’t think that would be in anyone’s interest. But, if you would like to start with a drink, I would be happy to join you.”
“You want to know what my favorite part of you is?” Castiel asked as he kissed around Dean’s neck, lightly biting every so often.
“That makes sense,” Dean nodded at Castiel. Dean was not really a religious person, in fact, beyond things he had seen in movies, he didn’t really know much about the subject at all.
It did not take long for Dean to adjust to the new situation and sensations. He wanted Castiel and he was not going to let the mysteries of kissing a man stand in his way, not this time. He was not going to run away from these feelings. They were the most real thing that he had felt in a very long time.
“Fine,” Balthazar huffed. “I'll behave. But I will not pretend that I am having a good time while we are here.”
“I thought you loved corny jokes,” Castiel says with a laugh, earning him an elbow to the side, which only makes him laugh harder.
“I’ll be right there,” Dean yelled to Benny before turning back to the piece of junk in front of him.
“They are connected,” Dean informed the man. “If you would have walked around, you would have found the shop. But you entered the diner and asked for a mechanic, so, in the diner, I appeared.”
“Dean,” Bella moved into the middle of the seat and up against Dean. They had been talking for about a half hour in his truck, this time more about Dean, except he left out the kid part. They were not serious enough for that conversation yet. So, mostly they talked about him being a mechanic and owning his own shop. She seemed to love that he was just a normal guy and not some stuck up college frat kid. “Do you want to kiss me?”
"You're awake." Cas said softly, looking down at his own hands instead of looking directly at Dean. "They told me I needed to prepare for you never to wake up. I knew they were wrong but it became harder and harder to deny it over time."
“Allow for me to what?” Castiel interrupted her again. “Allow for me to focus on my studies? Twirl my sword with Raphael? Be trapped within these walls for good?”
Dean pulled his truck into his normal spot around the side of the building. Dean had a thing for usuals. He frequented the same establishments, parked in the same spots and ordered the same thing. He was not against anything new in life, he just felt more comfortable with the things that he knew. He took the safe route in life. He had not always been this way but life shaped him. The parking spot was the perk to being the sort of step son to the owners.
"You are all I have left Cas." Dean stepped closer, pushing Cas until his back was against the wall. "We are all we have left. Please, just be with me. I need you."
Castiel reaches down and pulls up the first card. He gives Dean a quick look before turning back to the card, his face pointing in the direction of the camera. Another deep breath and he begins to read.
Dean stands up from his chair and turns toward the filing cabinet beside him. Castiel jumps slightly as Dean kicks the cabinet, causing a loud noise to erupt and everything on top of it to shake or clatter against it.
“There are four things,” Dean tells him. “One gift that we believe is the other’s favorite snack. One gift that we believe is the other’s favorite color. One gift that made us think of the other person. And finally, one gift that we can do together.”
“Oh yeah,” Castiel laughed, leaning his head back against the wall. “When you came down my throat …”
Dean finished up what he was working on and then made his way into the break room to get cleaned up. He hated making customers wait but he also liked to be slightly clean when interacting with the public. Dirty and greasy was expected of a mechanic but still, he liked to look like he was not just some dirty man who worked on cars. Even if that was all he really was.
The small, broken fairy looked up at him from the end of his bed with worry in his eyes. It was easy to see that horrible things had happened to him and now, here was Castiel, telling him that he was more than likely going to die at the hands of his uncle.
Dean pulled his phone out of his pocket to a text message from Castiel. It was slightly childish how excited he got over the text message. It was like when you made a friend in school and all you wanted to do was hang out with your friend, doing whatever it was that friends were supposed to do. It had been a long time since he really spent time with the friends he did have. They were all married and living their lives, just like he had been. His best friend was the one he missed the most, but Charlie was away exploring the world, doing what they both had dreamed of doing. He may not be doing it with her but he is damn glad she got out of this town.
But on the sixth day, he was free to be nothing more than Castiel. And he took advantage of these moments. Once he becomes King, even his sixth day will become a repetitive nightmare of routine and mundane business. Any semblance of real life will completely vanish and he will look back on these days fondly, realizing how good he truly had it, even if he can still deny that to be the case at the moment.
Castiel made his way over to a small little cubby hole in the corner of his room. He took the blanket from the end of his bed and folded it up, setting it neatly down to cover all the surface. Once he was finished he went over and put out his hand to the fairy.
[angelofthursday] Anyways, we dated all the way through high school. Got married. Tried to make it work but I just couldn’t.
The light tapping on Castiel’s window could have easily been mistaken for the tree, but he knew better. Dean was always sure not to make very much noise. He stayed at Castiel’s house frequently, more so now that his brother had been shipped off to boarding school, which Dean complained about but was secretly grateful for. Sam got away. But Dean made Castiel promise, a long time ago, that he would not tell anyone what was going on in his life. Castiel did not want to keep that secret, but Dean begged until he agreed and kept the secret. Which is why on these nights, Dean had to sneak in. Outside of his brother Sam, Castiel was the only person Dean trusted in this world. Castiel could not take that way from his as well.
Dean finally gains some semblance of control over himself and grabs the Dean and Castiel hats that are sitting on a shelf off to the side. He places the one that says Dean on his head and the Castiel one on Castiel’s head.
“Goodnight, everyone.” Cas smiled at everyone, except for Balthazar, before grabbing Dean’s hand and leading him to their tent.
Dean was getting a new roommate. He hated getting new roommates. In the six years he had been here, he has had fifteen roommates. Of those, he only liked two of them: Kevin and Benny. Kevin, because he was smart and liked to talk about things. Dean tried to ignore him but he always found him more fascinating than anything else. Then after a few more had come and gone, he got Benny. Benny didn't take shit from no one and told people off who tried to talk to Dean. When Benny was here, outside of Nurses and doctors, no one spoke to him. He really missed Benny.
“I wanted to be there,” Castiel admitted. “Then Meg showed up at my door and I just, I hadn’t seen her in so long.”
“Well grab yourself a drink and come hang.” Sam pointed to the alcohol and then began to make his way over to the crowd of people that Dean had met at the last party. Dean was not that interested in hanging out with them, not that any of them were horrible, they were just different than he was. However, he was here, he had to put on a good show for his brother.
[greeneyedhunter] Not that I plan on saying anything inappropriate, I don’t want to get in trouble or piss off some parents if I am talking to some kid.
The water was everything that Dean needed. It hit every part of his skin and worked its way into his tense muscles. He needed to see about getting a massage from someplace; someone who could really work into his muscles. He hadn’t had a decent massage since he was with Lisa and it was about time he got himself one. Maybe he could find one of those places that offered a happy ending. They existed didn’t they?
Before he had a chance to come up with an answer, Cas opened the door and came face to face with Dean; a look of shock on his face.
“Dammit Sammy,” Dean hissed at his brother. He hated that Sam felt the need to take Dean’s life into his hands. It was not his place and Dean did not appreciate it. This party stuff and now trying to set him up with people; that was not what Dean wanted. Though honestly, Dean had no idea what he wanted.
Dean brought his truck to a complete stop. Even though they had only left the party about five minutes ago, Dean felt better already. He was not against drinking and having a good time, parties were just not his way of doing it. He preferred more intimate gatherings. Though lately when it came to drinking, he did it by himself, in his office, after Ben was in bed. Not the best way to go about drinking but still better than parties.
"It was nighttime when the demons attacked my family." Dean said. "My dad woke me and my brother up and gave us swords. He told us to fight for our lives. They got me then. They probably killed my family. I don't know, though, I haven't felt my grace in years.
"Please." Dean begged, his eyes tear-filled. Castiel swallowed, not knowing if Dean meant to stop or continue, and kissed Dean's neck, just above his scent gland. The other angel whined and melted against Castiel, offering complete submission.
They were three-quarters of the way down when the demons began descending into the gorge. They had caught up quickly, they were at full health and had run across the field.
His sight was starting to get fuzzy and blackish. Everything tilted precariously, and Castiel realized he had rolled over onto his side. He stared up at the sky, feeling listless.
!" Castiel shoved his finger against Dean's chest. "This was all a ploy, wasn't it?! A way to trick me into sharing all the angelic secrets? I bet that you were laughing at me all those times the demons took you away to "torture" you! I bet you
Balthazar gave him a shove. Castiel sent him a glare over his shoulder. The merman perked up at Castiel’s presence, though.
it was his biology and their environment that had manipulated him into caring so dearly for the omega. The stress resulting of a shared situation this traumatic would influence anyone's brain and soul. It couldn't be helped.
The anger dissipated from Castiel then and he felt himself wilt as he went over his conversation with Dean.
The drive wasn’t too bad, Castiel was slowly getting used to driving around with Jack. Sam and Gabe hadn’t gotten to the hospital by the time that Castiel had, but Gabe had texted him to tell him to go on without them.
Castiel felt himself being lulled to sleep by Dean's pleasant scent. He tried to stay awake, but in the end his eyes slipped shut and sleep overtook him.
"I was wonderin' since it was a male omega angel," Bobby said, his voice faint, "but you didn't say it was him."
The restaurant wasn't far, thankfully. It was also right on the beach so there was a gorgeous view. It was only nearing six in the evening, so the sun was low in the sky but not setting yet. There were still plenty of people out and about, walking along the beach.
As weird as this Castiel dude is, Dean is strangely fascinated by him. He finds Castiel’s oddness endearing. To show that there’s no harm done, he flashes Castiel a bright smile.
“I hope that you find your comfort.” Castiel said, fretting. “I’m sorry I cannot be there to give it to you.”
Not that Castiel hadn’t been helping out with the company for years and hadn’t studied his head off in college. He had. But there were probably others just as qualified as he was, not to mention more experienced.
Dean looked at him with wide eyes, then nodded quickly. Castiel smiled as Dean pulled himself up onto the stern and then flopped his tail over Castiel’s lap. He twisted around so he was laying on his stomach and Castiel could see the back of Dean’s tail.
According to Charlie, killing Chuck had caused a giant earthquake in the personal heavens. There had been a flash of light too, and Charlie had been sucked in. In the next second, she’d found herself alive again.
It was well past dawn when the doctor announced that Dean was fully dilated and ready to begin pushing with his contractions.
"I'm open to moving, but I am in no rush to do so. I want Claire to have as much stability as possible."
Castiel let out a shuddered breath and released the spell in a hurried stream of whispers. He opened his eyes as the magic poured from him, a shockingly powerful outburst. The bush in front of him greened rapidly and then bloomed with fervor. Castiel pulled back, stunned. Fox-Dean shivered and moved away.
. There was apple and cinnamon, as well as saccharine vanilla, exactly like Gabriel's freshly baked apple pie. Underneath it was a sweeter scent still, one that Castiel struggled to place. Then, he understood.
"Okay, Papa." Claire said, nodding slowly. "I love you too. And it's okay! Mr. Dean is really nice to be around."
Castiel swallowed. He took the sticky note off and put it on the counter, then he went about serving Claire and himself some of the salad.
There weren't many customers. One couple entered and asked for a tea that would help with fertility. It was the first time that Castiel had ever been requested of such, but he had what the couple needed and handed it to them. Their purchase went without a fuss.
It took a moment for Castiel to process what he saw. There was a small, rain-soaked ferret curled tightly into itself. Its head was buried against its belly and under its paws and tail. Its fur was brown, but besides that Castiel could not see well enough to discern any patterns. What was the most obvious and concerning was the stretch of blood that matted the ferret's side.
"And you think I can have it on my conscious?" Castiel asked, almost angry. "It would be agony for me to know that he has you. I can't let you go, I care for you too much."
"You were very clear when you told me you never wanted to see me again, Michael." Castiel said, his voice a low growl.
Dean takes thirty minutes to decide on an outfit. He tries to tell himself not to worry because it’s not like it’s a date, or anything, it’s just a friend hangout thing. This ends up freaking Dean out even more because he has absolutely no memory of ever going on a friend-hangout thing or a date, so he has no idea how to act.
Maybe it would be easier to ignore his attraction if Cas wasn’t so intense. But the alpha always seemed to be looking at Dean in a way that made Dean feel like Cas was seeing into his soul.
"Why did you do that?" Castiel asked. He knew full well the pain that came from plucking feathers that were still young and strong.
“You too, Mother.” Castiel replied. He got his bag from the trunk and joined his mother. She gave him a delicate hug.
It was a Saturday, so Castiel's store was closed. He usually spent his weekends replacing the items that had been sold. His shed was full of all the things a witch could want. He had an area marked specifically for the rarer items he owned. His whole shed was warded, but the wards were even stronger around those rare items.
"Hello, Charlie." Castiel neutrally returned. Despite her age, Charlie was the head of the IT Department. Castiel knew that she could do much more than lead the department, but she had told him it paid well and allowed her enough time to pursue her true interests, whatever they were (Charlie had explained it to Castiel before, but he was not techy in the least).
Dean had said that he hadn’t felt pressured into having sex with Castiel, but what if he was lying? Castiel was sick at the possibility that Dean hadn’t had sex with Castiel out of his own free will. Castiel shouldn’t have gone through with anything. Dean was his friend, one of his closest friends even, but he was also Castiel’s employee, and Castiel had definitely crossed a line.
Claire told him that she wanted a braid and so Dean started to do a fish braid. Claire chatted excitedly to him throughout.
“Well, I think that I’m done watching terrible rom-coms for the day.” Sam comments, standing up. “See you at home, Dean.”
Dean wrinkles his nose. He doesn’t like Sam saying it like that, like he’s some sort of psychologist or something.
Dean tried to resist them at first, he really did, but their little, fuzzy bodies and too-big bills started to crack his defenses. He fucking melted when one of the ducklings looked straight at him and let out a tiny, beeping quack.
Claire was the one to open the door for Dean once he arrived at the Novak residence, though only after she asked who was there. Dean had a key but he felt it would be rude if he let himself in while Mr. Novak was home.
“Of course I would, Dean. I don’t love you for your features, as beautiful as they might be. I love you because you are the most amazing person I have ever met.”
Claire huffed impatiently. “Yeah, you said some B.S. about her not feeling like she’d be a good parent so she left me with you guys.”
He was downright miserable about his discovery for the weekend, only to be cheered on Monday afternoon when he met up with Dean again for tutoring.
“Yes, a coma. I know this is a lot to process. Would you like some time with your mate before we continue testing?”
The elevator arrived with a 'ding,' and Castiel did not hesitate to walk in. He pressed at the 'lobby' button with more force than strictly necessary. The doors closed and, ever-so-slowly, the elevator began its descent down.
“Are you ok?” Cas asked kissing the corner of his eyes. Ok, so maybe he was tearing up but Dean nodded. “I’m proud of you too, boyfriend” he added putting emphasis in the last word and Dean loved how it sounded falling from Cas’ lips.
Dean nodded and forced a smile; he was so busy trying to process everything that happened in the room that he hadn’t thought about what he would say to Sam about…that.
That last word, those simple four letters, that was all Castiel longed to hear. He was always running to try and fix the world, to make up for his mistakes but all he ever wanted was to belong. To be wanted. To be loved. Hearing Dean plead for him to stay was everything he needed and more. It was a promise. And Castiel’s heart had always ached for it.
Sam chuckled “You’ll get used to it.” He said sympathetically but his comment was welcomed by a glare that silently told him
Unfortunately for Dean, Cas started to shift between the sheets as if waking up. “Dean” he mumbled still deeply asleep, patting the space besides him trying to find him.
Unexpectedly, Cas got up quickly and stayed still, his back turned to Dean. Panic overcame him as he thought that the angel regretted what just happened and that he had royally fucked up.
The sound of an alarm interrupted them. It was Sam’s marking what should be the beginning of his annoyingly active morning routine.
Although it being something new for them, it felt familiar, like they were always supposed to end up there or like maybe even they already lived this, in another life, on another universe.
“Talk about what?” Sam ran a hand through his face, exasperated. Dean sighed. “Look, Cas and I… we’re a thing now.”
“Actually, I’m surprised Sam didn’t kill you during all this time we’ve been away” Dean said, genuinely surprised everyone seemed to be acting casually and just threatening enough in case the archangel still wanted to try to hurt them.
It happened so fast, they couldn’t even think about what they were doing or what they would do next.
“It’s not being here that worries me, Dean. At least not as much as the fact that if this temperature thing doesn’t stop, I don’t know what it will do to you and I won’t be able to stop it. I
“Haha” the archangel replied sarcastically “It’s not that, I lost that one millennia ago… No, Sam, what I have to offer you is something you’ve been looking for a very long time.”
The room’s temperature kept on going up and up. Dean had already taken off one of his jackets and was sitting on the floor, his back against a wall, in an attempt to stay cool. Castiel, on the other hand, kept pacing around the room trying to find a way out, a clue, something, anything!
Dean didn’t say anything. He didn’t know what he was supposed to say to that, but he immediately relaxed again.
Cas moved his hand from dean’s wrist to his hand, pressing it against his face and leaning into it with a smile.
“No problem at all, Cassie.” Gabe said, flashing a genuine smile, “We’ll wake you when the pizza gets here.”
"Hey, hey, hey!" Gabriel held out his hands and backed away. "Chillax, man. I swear I'm not working with the demons, though there is one I have been with since, you know, the failed attempt to bust you out."
“I’m glad we’re able to be here together, and to get an actual break, for once. Most of the time there’s always something out to get us, even when we’re not actively hunting, but this time it’s different, and I’m glad for that.” Sam said. He met Dean’s eye with a meaningful expression that Dean decided to ignore.

Gabriel was his attendant in the morning. He acted his normally obnoxious and cheerful self. Dean was sure he was pretending not to recognize Dean’s foul mood, which Dean appreciated. The last thing he wanted to do was explain to someone why he was unhappy.
Dean smiled as he took his clothes from Castiel and started putting them on right there. "Eh. Serves him right. It's payback for all the times I walked in on him and Jess."
Adam and Sam were done with their dinner by the time Dean got home. Both looked overjoyed to see him. Dean didn't get to spend much time with Adam while Adam was awake, but he did get to tuck Adam in for bed and kiss him goodnight, which wasn't something he got to do often.
"Okay, Papa." Claire said as she looked down. Castiel swallowed, feeling a flood of guilt. He briefly considered skipping the charity ball, but he knew it would only cause more problems with Naomi.
Sorry for not updating last week I'm surprisingly busy and for some reason I can't seem to get myself to write when I actually have time lol
“Uh,” Dean shot Castiel a panicked look, “May 18, right? It was after midnight when I went into labor.”
“Isn’t it? We’ve had nine months to prepare, but now that it’s real it’s like we’ve been hit with a truck.” Bobby replied.
“Dean, I’ve seen the way he looks at you, and I can assure you that he’s into you.” Charlie said. “And I promise that even if he wasn’t into you, which he is, he wouldn’t mind if you were into him. Besides, I gave him those Mickey Mouse ears for a reason.”
Dean fell quiet. His head was low and his hands were tucked into his lap. Castiel wasn’t sure how to comfort him. He’d never been good with words. Maybe it would help Dean if he knew that Castiel understood, though.
For Sam, a new yoga mat and some funky yoga speaker that played yoga music to give off the right ambience. Dean’s brother had absolutely no taste.
"Here." He said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a golden feather, it's stem blood-soaked. He tossed to the ground in front of Castiel.
Claire talked about her nails the entire drive home. Castiel was glad that Claire had seemingly forgiven him, but that did not mean that he had forgiven himself.
“Or maybe I wouldn’t,” Dean continued, sighing, “Maybe I’d realize it’d bring nothing but trouble. Maybe I’d see how we’d be doomed from the start.”
Even with the braces, it was nice for Castiel to be able to sort of wrap his wings around Dean again. It felt comfortable. Relaxing. Homely.
Castiel got out of the boat and then helped Dean out. Dean’s first steps were very shaky, but Castiel didn’t mind because it meant that Dean leaned on Castiel.
Gabriel returned a few minutes later. He was sweating and panting slightly. He plopped down onto the chair in Castiel's room and wiped his forehead.
"Well, perhaps not the exact same maturity level." Castiel amended. "I am much more serious than you."
heyyy it's late but it's here! hopefully this chapter wasn't too chaotic and hopefully the whiplash of emotions weren't too much
Dean turned to face him completely and stood on his hind legs with his front paws resting on Castiel's legs for support, much like a dog. He shimmered and shrunk down until he was a hedgehog in the same position. Castiel bent down to pick him up and he cradled Dean carefully in his hand.
Castiel was able to spend some time sitting with Claire and listening about her day before Balthazar came to pick him up. By that time, Dean had finished with the burgers and Castiel was subjected to a mouth-water aroma before he left. Absolute torture.
Their hike through the woods went surprisingly smooth. They never ran into a demon patrol or found any indication that there might be demons near. Dean was able to dig up some root Castiel had never heard of that they could eat. Castiel thought that Dean had probably learned many human hunting skills from his father, which was very handy in this scenario.
The next picture was of a newborn fledgling cradled in the arms of someone. The picture focused only on the baby, so Castiel couldn't see who was holding the baby.
“The doctors said that he had a few seizures while he was in surgery. They’re worried, because he should have been awake already, and since he’s not they think that the seizures, along with the lack of blood, caused him to go into a coma.”
He twisted so he was laying on his side, then reached for Dean and pulled him closer. Dean went easily and relaxed against Castiel.
Dean was bleeding from multiple wounds across his arms. His shirt was gone too, and whip marks marred his back and front. His head was held low, so Castiel still could not see his face, but he knew Dean's expression was one of misery and anguish.
Sam jumped to his feet when he noticed Castiel, and Castiel slowed to a stop. He must have looked flustered, because Sam’s scent sharpened with concern.
"Thank you." Castiel said, softly joining Dean at the counter. Dean made a big show of taking a bite from his food, then moaning as if to rub it in Castiel's face that he didn't have any food.
Castiel left for his bedroom and slipped inside to quickly change into more casual clothing and to wash his hands. After he went to the kitchen. The salad Dean prepared was labeled with a sticky note, just as he had said. Besides the ingredients, there was a little bit more.
He felt his magic flare angrily and suddenly his hair stood on end, static sparking at the tips of each strand.
"Yup!" She squirmed in his hold until he swooped down and placed her back on the ground. She took his hand to lead him inside.
The guards returned before Castiel was able to even begin dissecting all of that. The guards unlocked Castiel's cell, and then Dean's cell. They held their weapons up in case Castiel was going to make a move, but Castiel didn't spare it a second thought. The door of Dean's cell was shut and securely locked behind him.
Castiel was a good man, a loyal alpha to his King. He wouldn’t risk the respect and trust over an omega like Dean.
You seduced me, coerced me into pitying and caring for you! I have no idea what you are, Dean! And now our child will be a monster-"
The walk is long and taxing on his exhausted body, and by the time he’s reached the town he’s gasping for breath and sweating so much he’s almost drowning.
"Claire is usually well-behaved, but even then it can be overwhelming." Castiel replied. April's scent filled with sympathy.
"Would you like to do something beforehand?" Castiel asked. "We could go to the park or watch a movie?"
Castiel excused himself right after breakfast so he could shower and get ready for the day. He took a longer shower than he normally did, admittedly so that he could avoid Dean more. Dean was waiting for him out in the garden when Castiel finally managed to pull himself out of his shower and get dressed.
Michael chuckled humorously. "Well, dear brother, I meant it. You were a curse to our family. You destroyed Anna."
“Yeah, we’re fine.” Dean said, pulling back. Sam moved and revealed Charlie and Jack standing behind him.
There was a swish from behind and a flash of magic across their bond before a golden retriever walked into Castiel's frame of vision. The dog stared at Castiel and wagged his tail hesitantly. Dean took a step forward. When Castiel made no other movement, Dean took another step forward, then another, and he continued to walk forward until he was in between Castiel's legs.
Sam shared a smile with Jess, then Jess held out her left hand. There was a ring with a beautiful diamond on her fourth finger.
?" Dean repeated. "Shit, I don't know a lot about this war but I do know that you should not be here."
. Castiel constantly lost his footing and slid in his haste to climb. Dean was no better, and since he was in front of Castiel, more often than not Castiel had to halt suddenly to avoid trampling Dean.
“I didn’t think you’d be the type to pretend not to know someone,” she said. “I’m guessing you’re here to clear up the misunderstanding?”
"Here." Castiel said. He put the plate and Tupperware down in front of the ferret. The ferret sniffed tentatively at the beef and then started to nibble at it. It was only a few seconds before the ferret was gobbling the meat down in sporadic and snappish bites.
10:23 >> My mother insists it is what’s best for the family. I don’t have the courage to question her. It was easier before, with Amelie, but I’m not so fond of the idea now.
"You are dying." Castiel said bluntly. "My brother Gabriel believes that the only way to save you is if we heal restore our bond. Is that something you are interested in?"
The priest announced them as husbands and the audience, full of people that Dean had never met, went into a loud cheer. Castiel and Dean were ushered out the reception without so much as a pause for them to sit or get a drink. Castiel took Dean’s hand, as was expected, and acted as the host for the reception. He went from guest to guest, thanking them for their attendance and, if they presented Castiel and Dean with a gift, their generosity. Supposedly Dean and Castiel were supposed to have time to eat and drink with their guests, but that didn’t happen because there were so many people to thank and speak with.
They were ambushed by demons. It was not merely a patrol of demons, but a small army. Castiel's angelic patrol of seven stood no chance, though they fought valiantly till the end. One by one they had been slain, until only Castiel was left. But by that point he was tired and weakened by the loss of his companions, and the demons had overpowered him. Castiel had expected death, but instead the demons chained him and led him, head covered, to a demon camp. The leader there, Alastair (and Castiel both knew and feared that name from long-told stories and tales), had taken one look at Castiel, bound and struggling, and had thrown back his head and laughed.
Dean went to get coffee straight after dropping off Sam and Adam (which took forever because the line was so damn
Dean ordered their meals and they got it to go so they could eat on beach. Adam munched away and talked as he ate.
Castiel stared down at his mate and pup. Jack was snuggled up against Dean’s chest, purring happily. He’d been taking Jack to Dean nearly every day for the past month. He would talk to Dean about what Jack had done since the last visit and let Jack rest on Dean’s chest. There wasn’t a lot to tell, but Castiel knew that Dean would want to hear all of it.
"Sounds like a lot of fun." Dean said. "I have to check to see if I can, so for now I'll say maybe. That reminds me, I can watch Claire on Friday."
Dean spends all of his free time either at the motel or walking around town. He still hasn’t recognized anything, but he’s starting to become more familiar with everything. He doesn’t really talk to anyone outside of work, and even then that’s very limited, and so he sometimes feels lonely. Dean never does anything about this, ‘cause he has the feeling that he could have billions of friends and would still feel like absolute shit. He thinks that maybe his mind is missing his family, even if he can’t remember them.
Castiel's eyes slowly drifted down the rest of Dean’s face, then they traveled back up. It was all very intentional, and Dean couldn’t help but lick his lips.
Bobby rolled his eyes. "If you think that for one moment Dean knew about his daddy, you're stupider than most angels."
Castiel went to the dining room to retrieve Jack. Fortunately, the others seemed to understand that he didn't really want to talk, he just wanted to get Jack. He gave everyone a brief goodbye, then Bobby helped him pack everything into the car, and Castiel drove home.
Castiel couldn’t help but smile. The pregnancy hormones had certainly been affecting Dean for the past seven months.
"Okay, Claire, if you'd like." Castiel let Claire take his hand and lead him along. They sat next to one another at the table.
"I would prefer not to lie to my customers, Dean. Besides, saying something like that could still lead to more questions. It is easier to say that you are my employee. It's more accurate, too."
Dean looked absolutely wrecked. His eyes were glazed and half-lidded and his pupils blown wide. His licked his lips.
When they were finish with dessert, Castiel made a big show of checking his watch and letting out a sigh.
"Would you like more?" Castiel asked, offering his own plate. He watched Dean's eyes follow the plate of eggs. The familiar licked his lips.
Castiel had missed this so much. He spent a long time awake on the cot with Dean, despite how tired he was. He was scared that if he closed his eyes, he’d fall asleep and when he’d wake up he would realize everything had been a dream.
About three weeks into his stay, Dean decided he was tired of moping around his bedroom and he wanted to do some exploring.
"You must think it strange that I live alone, near no other witches." Castiel started. He waited for Dean's hesitant nod before he continued. "I was once part of a large coven that was run by my family. I am the youngest of several siblings, so I was often overlooked in favor of my older brothers. They were -
That snapped Castiel in focus and he nodded, not wanting to have to think about the amount of teasing he'd have to endure if Gabriel came to collect them.
“Oh. The doc said that alphas who don’t go into Alpha-rage often have more post-rage symptoms. You feeling sick?”
Gabriel was very surprised to learn that Dean's transformations were limitless, hence the amount of questioning.
Castiel's muscles burned and ached under the exertion and his lungs pumped painfully within his chest. His mouth tasted of iron and he felt dizzy from the heat. Not the best signs.
“Dean?” Castiel said, his voice soft. His hand rested on Dean’s shoulder, pulling all of Dean’s focus to the point of contact. “Are you alright?”
"It is rather remarkable that you were able to pass my wards. They are supposed to alert me if another magical being tries to enter, and they should keep most magical beings out."
Castiel tried to pray to the other angels, but it was no use. He'd figured as much. He hadn't heard any prayers since his capture, but still, it had been worth a shot.
He was led into the castle. Dean expected to be taken to the throne room and given an audience with King Lucifer, but to his surprise the knights guided him down several halls and up a few flights of stairs until he reached a room.
"Damn." Gabriel said. "Michael's fucking heavy." He caught sight of Dean and his eyes roamed over Dean's form.
Dean was already out by the car, so Castiel set the alarm and locked up the house. When he finished, he joined Dean.
Dean rolled his eyes and took off his shirt. Castiel’s gaze was drawn to Dean’s stomach. There was no difference quite yet, but it still thrilled some instinctual part of Castiel to know that
“Actually, I was thinking about showing Castiel around the garden. You mostly stayed around the vineyards and the barn, right?”
Something like adrenaline flooded Castiel's veins and he breathed in deeply. He really hadn't expected Dean to be okay with it. Castiel never thought he would have the chance to have a familiar, even with just a temporary bond, and he was
Claire obediently held her hands out on the table. The alpha did Claire's nails quickly, chatting with Castiel's daughter the entire time. After, she told Claire to keep her hands there as she did Castiel's nails.
Castiel pulled back only far enough to hastily press a kiss to Dean's lips. The familiar startled but kissed Castiel back.
Now intrigued, Castiel glanced once more in the direction of the man. He was looking down at his phone, oblivious to Castiel's interest. He wore a leather jacket and flannel with jeans. Castiel had assumed the man was an alpha at first, but he was starting to detect a hidden sweetness underneath the man's scent.
“Freshman year, I realized I was gay,” Castiel continued. “I told them about it. They’re more… traditional. Anyways, they told me I could stop being gay or I could leave and never come back. So, I left. My brother came with me. He’s not gay, but he couldn’t stand the way they treated me. We moved in with our other brother, Gabriel. I was very lucky that Gabe was already so much older than us, that he could afford to take us in. And, I was also lucky that Gabe even wanted to take us in. I don’t know what we would have done, otherwise.”
“Okay, well maybe that was a little too on the spot.” His brother admitted. “I’m just saying that Dean’s life may have turned out completely different for it to hit the same place.”
The Indiana Jones ride was even more fun than Space Mountain, maybe because Dean could see what was going on, for the most part. It was fun to cross the bridge and to be ‘shot’ at with arrows. Even when the jeep was stuck and there were bugs on the walls, Dean enjoyed it. The Inidiana Jones ride almost felt like it was something that could happen to them in real life, with all its ancient deities and curses, but it was still entertaining.
Dean didn't want to stand there in silence, it felt awkward. "Not sure if you got a chance to check, but I left the leftover dinner and pie in the fridge."
More guests started arriving. Benny arrived with Andrea, Bobby and Jo came next, and Kevin was last, looking as harried as always.
Castiel quickly looked away and pulled back. He could feel his cheeks heating. It was a downside of familiar transformations - their clothes did not travel with them.
Castiel put Jack back down on Dean’s chest and waited. The pup let out a soft noise, almost a sigh, and relaxed. Castiel laid his hand on Jack’s back, and once again he felt the vibrations. He wanted to pick Jack up to figure out what was wrong, but he forced himself to relax. He leaned toward Jack to try and see if there was something bothering him, and that’s when he caught the soft rumbling.
Castiel was Dean’s guard throughout all the wedding preparations. Dean had no say in the actual ceremony, but he had to be fitted for his wedding clothes and prepped on what would happen and all of that. Dean appreciated Cas’s faithful attendance, though it did nothing to ease the immense pressure in his chest.
“Castiel, there’s a difference between having to struggle and choosing to struggle. Just because you don’t go through the same hardships as other people doesn’t mean you’re any less of an alpha or a parent. It won’t make you a worse mate or dad to accept help, ya know? In fact, it might make you a better one. You really want Jackie to grow up thinking that he can’t ask for help?”
"My partner and I were being held prisoner by the demons." Castiel explained. "We just recently escaped. We were able to evade detection for awhile, but we were spotted when we were crossing the gorge, and they chased us."
Castiel waited out in the tavern with Ellen as she cooked up breakfast. Castiel wasn't hungry anymore.
At one point, near the middle of the first watch, Castiel heard several crunches that grew progressively louder. He tensed and held out a branch, his only weapon. The crunches continued and then passed by.
Bobby took a step forward, looking quite intimidating. Castiel swallowed and tried not to look away.
The alpha found the announcer and told him that they were retiring. The announcer let everyone know, and Dean and Castiel left the ballroom to cheers and applause.
Castiel woke gasping, as he did every day, but for the first time it was not because of a nightmare. Outside, thunder crackled and lightning flashed in a furious summer storm. The storm itself had not woken Castiel, there was something more that was making Castiel uneasy. The hair on the back of his head were on end and his stomach churned with the feeling of impending doom.
"No!" Castiel flung himself over Dean's body, ignoring the stabbing in his chest, and cupped Dean's face in his hands. "Dean!"
Castiel's mind briefly flashed back to when he'd lost his patrol. He remember the agony that followed from the broke bonds, as well as pain that came from being separated from his grace. He hadn't been aware of the loss of the angelic light that originated from the presence of other angelic beings, something an angel could sense even with their conscious grace disconnected, but that was likely because he was already overwhelmed.
Castiel also looked away, feeling uneasy. He shouldn't have pushed. Even if Dean was opening up, the conversation had clearly made him unhappy.
wanted to force so much childcare on Sam the way that John had with Dean. Sam must've been able to tell, though, that Dean wanted to do it, because he smiled and said it wouldn't be a problem. Dean felt a bit selfish knowing that Sam would have to watch Adam a lot, but he reminded himself that the job would be to give them both a better future.
“I don’t understand the problem.” Mr. Rogers cut in. “Why are Gordon and Aidan in trouble? They should be allowed to hold their own opinions.”
Castiel could feel the genuine thoughtfulness from Dean's side of the bond and it was touching. He wasn't used to having people care about him, besides Gabriel, but Gabriel had a strange way of showing he cared (it usually involved actions where Castiel had to remind himself that it was the thought it counts).
"No running!" Castiel called, uselessly. He looked back at Dean. The other man gave him a hesitant grin.
In the evening, Dean startles to a knock at his door. He blinks blearily at the ceiling before swinging his feet off the side of the bed. He takes his blanket and wraps it around himself. He feels too much like shit to care that he looks a mess.
Castiel continued to work in his shed for the rest of the afternoon until dinner. Once again, he ate his meal outside in his garden. Since the sun was setting, there were a few nocturnal animals that came over to him. An owl landed besides him and hooted cheerfully before taking off. A badger lumbered by. Several opossums, a mother and her four babies, sniffed at him curiously before moving along.
Sam was up for a couple more hours doing homework. Dean sat next to him at the table, just happy to be home. Every-so often, Sam would look up and tell Dean something that he remembered about the day. There wasn't much time for full conversations though, which bummed Dean out a bit.
(even though he hadn't seen the ambush coming and often missed social cues), but Dean continued before he could.
Castiel glanced up from a shelf to look at Dean. The familiar had his arms crossed as he leaned back in the chair, but he looked relaxed.
“Can you guys come closer? I’m all the way over here, how am I supposed to observe you?” The merman complained.
As Castiel started to warm up to Dean, Dean came out of his shell. Castiel hadn’t even realized it, but Dean hadn’t been as outgoing as he presented himself. Since Castiel stopped hiding how fond he was of Dean, Dean began to open up more. It wasn’t that everything from before was fake, but Dean knew how to be appealing and friendly without really revealing much about himself.
Dean actually didn’t mind cooking too much. It made him happy to have a place to be able to prepare a meal. It was nothing like the holidays he’d spent with Sam (or alone) in motel rooms.
Claire was easily distracted then, but it didn't last long. After each animal they saw, she would ask Dean about Mr. Novak. Dean had no idea when Mr. Novak would be getting there, but he tried to smile and act casual. Unfortunately, Claire must've recognized the uncertainty in his scent. She lost her excitement and started to drag her feet.
"Yeah, about that. I really do not see how it's possible that you could do that. No offense, Cassie, but there's no way you could have bested him." Gabriel said.
It was rather fascinating to watch Dean's pupils dilate and flicker down to Castiel's lips. Castiel licked them on instinct.
"It is no problem." Castiel hummed. "My bedroom door has a lock as well, if you feel as though it will help you."
insult the baby." He growled, voice low and deadly. "Think whatever crap you want about me, Cas, I don't fucking care. But
"The best kind of deal, in this situation." The demon replied, his eyes glinting dangerously. "Don't test me, angel. One shout and you're both caught. Trust me when I say you will
“I only mean to say that you have been a wonderful caretaker to Claire and to your own family. I cannot imagine that such a caring man would have angered some higher power.”
They wandered around Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge for a little longer, then headed to the exit. Sam, Cas, and Jack were already waiting for them. Dean couldn’t bring himself to meet Cas’s eyes. He still felt too open from his conversation with Charlie.
“‘m fine.” Dean muttered. “Just confused and kinda pissed. Scratch that, I’m really pissed. What about you?”
"I miss her too." Castiel said. "But, honey, she's not going to come back. Would it help if we go to the zoo this weekend?"
Castiel felt like he been run over by a herd of horses. He stiffly pulled his arm back. Then he moved away from their shared bars and back to the front of the cell. He absently grabbed at the lock and fiddled with it. It was pointless, though. These locks required a key, same as in the last dungeon. The only difference was that these locks were a little bigger.
A jolt seemed to pulse through Castiel. He hadn’t considered letting Dean go after finding a new mate.
Michael sent his own burst of power in the form of fire hurtling towards Castiel. Castiel shielded back the flames with one hand while shooting another bolt of lightning with the other. It wasn't powerful enough to kill Michael, but it was enough to distract him.
"I must say, I did not expect to meet the great garrison leader Castiel this way." He said. Castiel said nothing.
“Your name.” Dean repeated. “I’m sure you know that I am Prince Dean of Winchester, but I insist you call me Dean.”
Castiel could practically feel his eyes bulging. "Dean, every angel has specific bird wings." This was
"I am." Dean said easily, smile growing bigger. "That's rather observant of you. How old are you? Twelve, thirteen?"
In the end, Claire didn't want to finish going through the zoo. She told Dean that she was tired and she wanted to go home. Dean checked his phone one last time, hoping Mr. Novak had said something, but his texts still remained unanswered.
"Claire and I had a blast." Dean replied. "I can tell you more about it tomorrow at the zoo, you look tired."
The alpha’s clothing was plain but made with obviously fine material, so he was definitely not a servant. A guard then, perhaps?
Dean's deadpanned glare made everything funnier to Castiel and he couldn't keep back the bubble of laughter building in his throat. Dean batted a paw up at Castiel's face but Castiel just continued to laugh.
"Again." Castiel replied, sighing. "They just never seem to stick. Claire's a good child, I don't understand why she keeps acting up."
They moved silently to the kitchen. Castiel could feel that his own bubble of warmth and giddiness was reflected across their bond. Dean was just as happy about their joining as Castiel was.
Except, now that Castiel thought about it, he could not remember if their daughter had been killed or not. He had assumed, since she hadn't been heard from. Castiel wished he could remember the daughter's name. Dean could be the only remaining Campbell.
Castiel reached out to brush his hand against Jack’s back, wanting to reassure himself with the touch, and was met with tiny trembles. Castiel immediately picked Jack up. He was worried something was wrong. Jack’s chest continued to vibrate, could he breathe right?
Castiel watched Dean as the omega focused on the photos of his parents. He thought about how important Dean was to him after only a few months of knowing one another. If Dean died, Castiel would be absolutely crushed.
“I thought we’d be here together, figuring it out together.” Castiel continued, choking on the words. His eyes began to burn with tears. Jack probably sensed his distress because his wails grew louder still.
"Everyone here in Lawrence." Jo explained. "We're at the Roadhouse now, a tavern my mom owns. A scout saw you guys making a run for it and alerted us, so we all rode down to save your asses."
Sam glanced at Charlie, looking uncomfortable. “I don’t know, Dean. Maybe it took you guys longer to get here than it felt.”
"That's not true." Gabriel said. "Maybe it would be different if you didn't want passion or intimacy, but can you honestly tell me that you don't crave just a little?"
"Okay." He said. Castiel heard Dean shuffling, and then the omega was directly next to Castiel and pressed up against the bars. Castiel was hyperaware of where their bodies touched between the bars. Dean's skin was a smooth contrast to the rough and itchy fabric he wore. Castiel's left hand was in complete contact with Dean's right.
Dean nodded, breathing through his teeth. Castiel winced in sympathy for his mate and turned to the nurse that had just entered the room to check on Dean.
Claire's eyes widened and she nodded. The beta led her to an area of the store that had shelves of nail polish. Castiel was shocked by the amount.
Castiel muttered under his breath as he left the room, making Dean grin to himself. It was so easy (and so fun) to rile up his alpha guard.
, he tries. He knows it’s not his own name, but he also knows it may be the most important thing in the world. It’s so fucking frustrating that he can’t remember.
"I used to be different, ya know? I used to be a smartass and feisty. But, not anymore. Now, I'm just some weak, pliant bitch."
"My boss forgot." Dean said with a sigh. "He was supposed to meet Claire 'n me at the zoo, but he didn't. Claire was super bummed."
“I’ll do it!” Charlie offered cheerfully. “I’m more used to the idea because I read fanfiction. So, you can think of alpha, beta, and omega designations as a sort of secondary gender. Traditionally, alphas are the protectors and omegas are the caretakers and bear children. It’s not really like that anymore, at least in this universe. Alphas have ruts and omegas have heats, which are their fertility periods. Betas are probably the most similar to humans in the universe that we’re used to. They still have animalistic instincts but they don’t have heats or ruts. They all have a more powerful sense of smell, so now we’ve all got our own scents.”
"Well, it was nice meeting you, Cas." Dean said, shamelessly shortening the other man's name. It was long and difficult to say, anyways. "See you around sometime."
“Hello Mr. Rogers. Please, come have a seat.” Lisa gestured to the two chairs perpendicular to Dean and Adam.
Ellen was amazing, as always. She helped Castiel clean up the house (because while Castiel stayed home to write, he was never the tidy one in their relationship). Castiel wasn’t
Dean shot him a bitter look before his body shimmered. It took a few seconds, and then a horse was standing in front of them. He had a tan, yellowish coat with a dark mane and tail.
Castiel hoped he wouldn’t be one of those people who never forgot about their high school love and was constantly miserable about it.
Dean’s almost done scrambling some eggs when he hears the doorbell ring. He frowns to himself and wonders who is at the door. It might be his elderly neighbor asking for some sugar again, but she just asked for some a couple of days ago.
"Yes, Papa." Claire said, as she always did (the little liar). Castiel bent down to kiss her forehead. Dean and Claire waved at him as he left.
“Stay back, buddy.” Dean growls. “You keep your distance until you tell me what the fuck is going on.”
"You're only older by three months, Claire." Castiel said, but he still smiled. "We should get you ready."
Ellen was really sweet about it, and she even congratulated him on the job, even though Dean insisted that it might not last.
"Yes." The alpha quickly replied. He masked his scent and stared ahead rigidly, probably ignoring Dean.
Daphne was waiting for Castiel to arrive. She smiled at him when he exited the elevator and he caught sight of the flowers on her desk. She'd accepted his apology, then. Castiel paused next to her desk.
When the doorbell rang, Castiel realized he’d made a mistake. He should have started with the dishes because they needed dishes to eat the pizza with. It was such a small, stupid error, but it made Castiel feel horrible.
Dean whirled around on his heels and marched out the apartment. He went straight to Baby and drove away.
Friday went by much too quickly, which was a weird turn of events since he normally looked forward to the weekend. But when Castiel was finished with work, Balthazar was waiting for him.
In all the months that Dean had known Cas, they’d never hugged before. It wouldn’t have been proper at all.
"It's what Mother wants, Gabriel." Castiel sighed. "It would look good for our family. Plus, Claire could use another parental figure. I'm not around as much as I should be."
"Not for miles. The closest is a few hours away." Gabriel insisted on being "near" Castiel, even though Castiel always said that he was okay by himself.
They go to a diner for dinner, but not the one that Dean works at, and afterwards Cas walks with Dean back to the motel. It feels exactly like the romcoms that Dean has definitely not been watching in his spare time and he half expects Cas to kiss him.
Ellen looked over to him, smirking. "You two slept all day and night, you must be starved. I'll make you a plate."
“It’s not your fault,” Castiel replied, offering Dean a smile. “For the record, I didn’t tell you this to compete with your story or anything, I just want you to know that I understand how you feel.”
Claire slept in Castiel's bed again, unsurprisingly. He woke her up in the morning and helped her get ready. Then while she was eating breakfast, Castiel quickly got himself ready for work.
"Of course I wanna stay with you." Dean said, rolling his eyes. "Of course I love my family, but I also love you and your garden and even your stupid shop. Not to mention the hot sex we can have out in the middle of nowhere. I don't want to leave you. We can always visit, and maybe Gabe can teach Sam that transport thing. Sam's really really powerful, like you wouldn't believe, but we were never properly trained so he's probably got loads of potential."
"Knock it off!" A hard wack was delivered to the back of Castiel's head, abruptly cutting his snarl off. The world spun around him for a second, blackening. Castiel blinked rapidly several times. He thought he might be swaying.
"April," Mr. Novak said, said into the phone, "I have to go. I can't wait to see you tomorrow. Goodbye."
"Fuck yeah!" Dean replied, already shimmering. Jess started to shimmer too, which took Castiel by surprise since he'd felt that Sam was magical. He'd assumed that Sam was the familiar and Jess was the witch.
"I think that you are beautiful. I wish I could have done more to protect you from Michael, but I swear to you that for the rest of my life, as long as you'll let me, I'll do my best to keep you safe. I've sworn it before and I'll swear it again, whatever it takes for you to know it's true."
Dean made them sandwiches for lunch, then he watched Disney movies with Adam. Sam wasn't able to spend more time with them, unfortunately, since he had to study, but Adam was happy anyways. His scent was still young and mostly unspecific, outside of general emotions, so Dean knew that Adam was happy, though there was nothing more.
"I do not know." Castiel answered. "He fell unconscious after I killed Michael. I think that I used too much of his magic reserve and drained him too far."
"Dean!" Castiel lunged forward and tackled Dean from behind in a hug. Beneath him, Dean jerked and tried to pull away from Castiel.
Saturday went by pretty much how Castiel expected it to: slowly. Mr. Kelly showed Castiel around the property and Castiel pretended to be interested. He asked questions, hummed, nodded his head, all the time thinking about if Claire would like to go see a movie, and what movie to watch, and whether he should invite Dean and Adam to come along. Did little boys like the same movies that little girls do? Adam liked Disney, and Frozen II was still in the theaters, so maybe that?
Castiel gnashed his teeth in frustration. He could not stand to see other angels be harmed, especially those who had done nothing to deserve it. Castiel hoped another patrol had been sent out to find him. His patrol may have been far away from the Capital, but the death of six angels would have been felt even from at such a distance.
The flash of relief that Castiel felt could also be seen across Dean's face. He grinned at Castiel, which made Castiel smile in return.
"Claire, that was supposed to be our secret." Gabriel cut in, grinning at her. She slapped her hands over her mouth, eyes wide.
Dean decides to take a chance and plasters on a scowl. “I can never understand the stuff you describe, dude, you know that.”
The two had just made it to the gorge when the distant sound of horns echoed from behind them, causing both to freeze.
None of this helps. There’s not one fucking clue of who he might be. There have been no missing Dean’s in the area for the past year, and the last Dean that went missing was a sixty-years-old woman.
Castiel marched to Dean, burning with righteous fury and protectiveness. Dean stared at him as Castiel grew closer and did not flinch when Castiel took his chin again.
“Yes, that would be upsetting. But this must upset you as well? These parents are holding your life’s circumstances against you, and they have no right to do so.”
Y'all can probably tell, but I'm not very experienced at writing intimate / heated scenes so it's a bit of a learning process here... bear with me as I start trying new things lol
"You tricked me into mating you! You wanted me to pity you, the poor omega angel, and take you with me to Heaven so you could be a spy for the demons!"
Castiel had also gone to a boarding academy for high school, though his had been alpha-only. While he could agree with April that it taught him to be more independent, it had
Castiel returned to his bedroom. The ferret was still sound asleep on Castiel's bed. Castiel took a deep breath before swiftly reciting the spell.
“‘Cause I figured if I’m meant to be here, I’m meant to be here.” Gabe shrugged. “Plus there’s nothing around to kill me. Another plus.”
Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge was probably the coolest fucking thing that Dean had ever seen. He tried not to let it show how excited he was, but his scent must’ve been giving him away if Sam’s and Castiel’s amused glances were anything to go by.
Dean's bottom lip trembled. The familiar glanced away, though not before Castiel caught the sight of the shine in his eyes.
Castiel stared down at the cat in his lap, full of shock. He reached down and ran a hesitant hand down Dean's back. Dean tensed briefly, but he relaxed again and even pressed a bit against Castiel's hand. Encouraged, Castiel continued to pet through Dean's soft fur. He found himself reacting to the calming nature of petting a cat. His heartbeat slowed to a bearable pace and his breathing evened out.
“What a sweetheart.” Bobby cooed. It almost startled a laugh out of Castiel; he’d never heard Bobby sound like that before. “You wanna go see your grandma Ellen?”
"Thank you, Gabriel." Castiel said. "You are truly an amazing brother. Thank you for putting up with me for all these years and caring for me when I did not care for anything else. I love you."
Adam had seemingly forgotten that he had been upset with Dean earlier. The three of them spent the rest of the afternoon in well-deserved family time. Both of the boys were glad that Dean didn't have to catch day-long weekend shifts anymore, and Dean was glad too. He loved spending time with Sam and Adam, and he wanted to be there for them as often as he could.
Castiel glanced over his shoulder at Dean. The omega held up a book to show Castiel. Castiel moved to Dean's side and looked down at the black-and-white photos.
"And I suppose you want to be the one to do this?" Alastair asked in a sickeningly sweet voice. "You would want to pamper and tend to Dean, hm? Make sure his needs are taken care of and he's safely tucked away in your nest?"
Castiel watched him for a moment, taking in his casual appearance. He was wearing shorts and sandals with his flannel shirt, obviously prepared for the beach. He had said he was busy, which confused Castiel. Dean certainly did not look busy.
“Hm.” He said. He looked over his shoulder, then moved out onto the porch and closed the door behind him. “How have you been doing?”
"I will." Castiel said, determined. He would defeat Michael, because if he did not Dean would suffer the consequences, and Castiel would
Castiel swallowed and closed his eyes against the sudden burn. He'd said such horrible things about Dean and their child.
“I suppose that would be rather strange.” Castiel hummed. “I appreciate you letting me inspect your fins, by the way. They’re gorgeous.”
He heard Jimmy’s laugh from the other room. “Just wanted to get you to use that big brain of yours!”
“You two going to keep babbling out here? Or are you going to come in with my grandson?” Ellen demanded, arms crossed.
They trekked for the whole day, past where Castiel thought the secret exit from the original fortress might be. He could feel that they were closer to Heaven. The air seemed lighter and less oppressing, and the trees started to thin from overbearing to bushy. Every-so-often a bird would fly overhead.
"He's still asleep." Castiel said, almost protectively. He knew he should trust Bobby, but something inside of him was fighting to go and keep everyone away from Dean.
The way that Dean's eyes turned wary as he took a step back informed Castiel that Dean was very aware of Castiel's emotions.
"Wait till the angels know we've captured their most precious garrison leader." He had taunted. "Throw him in the dungeons!"
Dean settled in the center of the couch in the living room because both Adam and Claire wanted to sit next to him.
Full disclaimer: I didn't really read over the chapter before posting it so there are probably way more mistakes than normal... also, I have no experience giving advice to kid who's been bullied/picked on so I went with the most generic Winchester thing I could think of which would be (ultimately) not giving up
“You know that you can share anything with me, Dean.” Cas says. “I would never hold it against you.”
Dean laughed. "Nah. I'm just visiting a friend during her break. She didn't have a chance to buy coffee, so I brought her some."
Castiel had seemed nervous when Dean told him of his and Gabe’s meeting, even though Dean assured him that Gabe had spoken well of him.
Castiel stared glumly out the window as he thought it over. It was true that he hadn't spent much time with Claire lately, but he was very busy. If he could focus on his work for one full week, then he might be able to start getting home earlier. As it was, Castiel was constantly bombarded with calls from the various nannies he'd hired as they complained or quit (often both).
Unluckily, Dean’s house was on the other side of town. It took Castiel almost an hour of walking and jogging to get to the house, and by then the sun was starting to set and his stomach was growling profusely. He’d gotten several texts from Gabe, but Castiel just explained that he really needed to speak to Dean and that he was safe.
“We did. That’s a fantastic idea, April.” Mr. Kelly nodded his approval, and April wasted no time in excusing both herself and Castiel.
They don’t talk a lot, mostly idle chatter, but it’s perfect. Castiel doesn’t talk a lot about himself, even when Dean specifically asks about him. He sort of avoids the question and asks about Dean. Dean ends up telling Cas all about himself, which really isn’t a lot. He talks about how he lost his memory and how it’s been hard trying to get back to normal. He talks about the motel and his job at the diner. He doesn’t talk about his nightmares. He doesn’t want to freak Cas out.
Dean twisted so he was on his back instead of his stomach. “Just ‘cause I can, doesn't mean I have. I’ve never really felt like doing it without a reason.”
Castiel glared over his shoulder as he held tightly to Dean's forearm. The demon stared back at him impassively. Castiel unfurled his wing and wrapped it around Dean for good measure, then continued walking.
"That would be good." Castiel said, his eyes slipping shut. He heard Dean chuckle, then the couch shifted as Dean stood.
The salad that was brought out looked expensive and sophisticated and tasted terrible. Castiel felt a pang of envy when remembered how delicious Dean's food was and how good the burgers had smelled.
Dean was a friend to Castiel. Castiel wasn’t good at getting out and meeting and talking to people other than Gabe (and Gabe hardly ever took things seriously), but talking to Dean was like second nature.
"What kind of information could they want from me?" Dean sounded hysteric. "How to cook? Hunt? Steal? Pick locks? Slay a demon? What could I
Castiel considered carrying Dean for the rest of the walk, his weight certainly wouldn't be a problem, but then Castiel had a better idea.
“Thank you for being such a patient and obedient son.” Castiel said, leaning his face into Jack’s soft hair. “It goes for you too that your dad and I will always love you, no matter what.”
Castiel thought back to their last interaction. Maybe he had been kind of cold, but it was nothing to warrant Dean’s reaction, right?
I have 2 weeks of school left (one of those being finals week) so I will not be updating until after then but then I'll be off for 3 weeks so fingers crossed I'll be able to get some writing done
Just as Dean was preparing to serve himself a large portion of mashed potatoes, Sam leaned forward and held out a hand.
It was absolutely abhorrent that witches were allowed to treat Dean, or any familiar, in that way. Familiars were not meant to be forced into bonds and used against their will. He could only imagine how horrible it must have been for Dean to experience it first hand. With just the short amount of time Castiel had known Dean, he knew that the familiar was stubborn and independent. No witch should have taken away his choice.
Alastair looked pleased when Castiel was guided to the designated torture chamber. This put Castiel on edge, and the feathers on his wings flared.
“I found you by accident. When I realized that you didn’t remember anything, I thought that it might be a chance for you to live without all of the past weighing you down. I was going to stay away, too, but I couldn’t, Dean. I always seem to make bad choices, and I can’t regret giving you a normal life, if only for a little bit, but I do regret ever taking part in it.”
For lunch, Castiel led Dean back to the house. This time Dean made Castiel food. He insisted on it. He made them both peanut-butter and jelly sandwiches, probably because Castiel was running low on groceries. Castiel appreciated the simplicity and deliciousness anyways.
Dean shrugged. "Not super surprising. Most parents need a full-time nanny because they have too much on their plates. He had stuff to do."
Castiel wasn’t sure he could bear it. He wasn’t sure he could even stand to face Dean now that… now that they’d been together.
“You are wearing too many clothes for a shower. You’re going to need to remove them.” Castiel informed his mate, ever practical.
Dean glared and looked away. Sam wasn’t really wrong. There hadn’t been a demon sighting since Jack had, more or less, usurped Chuck and absorbed his essence, which meant there had been no hunts involving demons. Sam was sure it was a result of Chuck dying. Dean didn’t care to disagree.
Claire helped Castiel to wash the dishes after they were done with their food, then they settled on the couch to watch a show before bedtime. Claire cuddled against Castiel's side throughout the movie and held his hand in her right while she sucked her thumb with her left. Castiel knew he should probably stop her from sucking her thumb, but he let it slide.
Dean cried out and tripped forward, startling Castiel from his thoughts. He caught Dean's arm and stabled him.
After lunch Claire decided that she wanted to walk through the whole park. It was separated by biomes, so they started with the tundra in the northern part of the park. Claire loved the Arctic Fox and polar bear, but she didn't so much for the muskoxen. She also liked the temperate forest biome because it had snowy owls, deer, and, most importantly, pandas.
Dean leaned back, pulling Castiel with him so they were sprawled out along Castiel's bed, and just like that, the nightmare faded from the forefront of his mind.
Castiel was just as unhappy during the week after spring break. He didn’t share a single class with Dean and their lunches hadn’t lined up. The only positive was that Castiel shared a lunch period with Jimmy, so at least Castiel had someone for company.
“It is.” Castiel answered with a smile. He held out his arms and Jack walked over to him to hug him.
"Well, I can do that too." Dean said, grinning. "It was good, very good. Claire really sweet. I do think that she's having trouble adjusting, though, if you don't mind me saying."
“Shit. Just so you know, I wasn’t upset because I thought you said no, I was upset because you acted like you didn’t know me.”
"What the hell is that supposed to mean?!" Dean snapped. He marched up to Castiel and glared at him with his hands on his hips.
Castiel was surprised by the compliment. As far as he could tell, there was nothing underlying in April's expression. She seemed opened and honest. It was... refreshing, and very different from what he expected.
“I see your point. In any manner, I meant that you were here to guard me from escaping or stop me from doing anything rash and destructive, not to protect me.”
Castiel put Claire to bed and then got ready for bed himself. By the time he had showered and changed, Claire had somehow made her way to Castiel's bed, even though he had been certain she was asleep. He sighed and made himself comfortable on his side of the bed.
also I'm thinking there will be around 5 more chapters after this one, thanks everyone for hanging in there :D
“As much as I’d like to take credit for that, I don’t think they learned that much kindness from me.”
Dean shimmered, startling Castiel. Dean began to shrink and Castiel did his best to keep hold of him so that he wouldn't fall to the ground. Articles of clothing dropped to the ground. Dean weighed significantly lighter a few seconds later when the shimmering began to die off. In place of Dean's human body was a bundle of grey fur. It took Castiel a moment to realize that he was carrying a koala.
"Mama," Adam asked from where he was cuddled against Dean's side with his bowl of ice-cream, "what are we doing tomorrow?"
They retired after dinner to their separate rooms since it was already nearing ten. In the morning, Mr. Kelly explained he would show Castiel around the property and they would be going wine tasting.
Still, Sam looked at him with an expression of gratitude. The taller brother took only two large steps until he was wrapping his arms around Castiel. The hug took Castiel by surprised and he flinched violently. Sam paid no mind and only tightened his hold.
“We say things we don’t regret, kiddo, I understand.” Dean replied, but Castiel could tell from the gruffness in Dean’s voice that the man was holding back tears.
"You care so much for her." April said with almost longing, her eyes glazing just a bit. "It's truly admirable."
As the room burst into laughter at their (not-so) unfortunate luck, Castiel met his mate’s gaze across the room and smiled at him.
He collapsed onto the couch, only for the doorbell to ring not a minute later. Groaning, Castiel stood up and went to answer the door.
“I love you too.” The words caught in his throat a little, but Dean forced them out. They were true and Cas deserved to hear them back.
Gabe must have scented Castiel’s growing distress. “It’s okay that you thought of Dean first. The doctors told me he was already unconscious when the guards tranquilized you. Plus, you just went through an Alpha-rage.”
"I have a favor to ask of you." Castiel said. "Is it possible that you have the early evening free?"
Sam was waiting for him in his room. He looked up expectantly at Dean when Dean came in, and he winced when Dean slammed the door.
Surprisingly, Dean seemed to grow even more uncomfortable. This made Castiel a bit worried that he'd overstepped. Maybe Dean had only one form and he was ashamed of that.
Once he had recovered, Castiel flung himself forward and pulled Dean into a tight hug. The omega was stiff at first, but he relaxed. Castiel could sense his soul better now, and he was not shocked to find it extremely powerful. He was shocked, however, to see it so bright and pure. Castiel didn't think he'd ever seen a soul this bright, and this was while his grace was not completely back.
Castiel pursed his lips. He didn't know how it would affect their child, but he imagined the fledgling would be incredibly powerful.
"Yeah." Dean replied, surprisingly calm. "I told him all of that, too. It didn't seem important. He didn't believe me, though, when I talked about my parents."
More things flew past his vision, much too quickly for Castiel to comprehend. He blinked, eyes squeezing forcefully, and tried to focus.
Dean felt warmth rise up in his chest. "I'm glad you think so, buddy, but there's always room for improvement. What's important is that you know I still love you just as much as I did before, even if I can't spend as much time with you. Does that make sense?"
“This Ms. Braeden’s room?” A voice called out. Dean glanced over at the doorway, his nerves practically ricocheting. An alpha stood in the doorway, his arms crossed.
Dean saw more of his kingdom than he’d ever had in the past, which was horrible ironic seeing as he may never return and the kingdom would likely fall to Sam’s rule rather than Dean’s (and Dean’s husband, by extension).
“You say that omegas have the same rights as alphas, so then can I expect to be allowed a consort or two once I am married?”
"Good choice. Now, we're going to go over to those tables and that nice woman is going to do your nails."
Dean had to wait a couple of minutes at the elevator after pressing the button for the doors to open. There was already another man inside, and alpha, but Dean ignored him.
Dean shrugged his shoulders. "Eh. It's fine. So I'm just going to live in some random house all by myself?"
The ride started up. The cars moved forward and then turned, then started to go up an incline. Dean took a deep breath.
Castiel looked back at him, his eyes sad. He was dressed in a white tunic and a bright blue cape. A crown of gold and jewels lay upon his fixed hair.
“I wish you a happy day.” Gabriel said. “We need to get going, the ceremony will be beginning soon.”
Seconds later, April Kelly sat down. Castiel pushed her in, ever the polite alpha, and took his seat besides her.
Dean relaxed and then jumped up onto the couch near Castiel. He kneaded a pillow a couple of times before laying down and making himself comfortable. Castiel couldn't help the quirk of his lips at the sight.
Anyways... let me know what you think (I really loved Castiel's nail polish idk about you guys but it made me so happy... is it too obvious that I made it rainbow???)
So, a couple of weeks later, Dean found himself in the kitchen cooking up a storm. He’d already banned Sam, Gabe, and Castiel. Sam and Castiel sucked at cooking, and Gabe kept eating everything. Charlie was actually decent. She could follow the directions, at least. Jack helped by cutting up vegetables and peeling the potatoes for mashed potatoes. The turkey had been in the over since early in the morning, so it’d be done in time for a late-afternoon lunch.
Castiel's mind drew to a sudden halt when Dean surged forward and pressed his lips harshly against Castiel's.
I hope everyone enjoyed the animal forms that Dean took (I shoved a whole lot into this last chapter and I tried to get most of the suggestions) also pls let me know if the pictures don't work - there were a lot of them
It made Castiel feel a bit guilty to realize that he hadn't given much thought to what Dean's life might be like. He didn't really know anything about Dean. Castiel had never really bonded with the other nannies, but being around them had felt different. They were polite, professional, and collected, but not outgoing and friendly like Dean. Plus, Claire hadn't liked the others the way she liked Dean.
Cat-Dean closed his eyes and began to shimmer once more. Then, the cat was replaced by a large German shepherd.
It sounded so ridiculous to Castiel’s ears. Comas were things that happened on soap operas, not to actual people!
“Got it!” Sam said, coming back to the group. There was a physical, printed copy in his hands, but he explained that he was also sent a digital copy.
The omega turned around, eyebrows furrowed in confusion as he searched the crowd for whoever had called his name. Dean met Castiel's gaze, and his eyes widened in surprise.
Okay I had an extremely stressful Wednesday... so my neighborhood had a scheduled power outage in the morning that started two hours late... of course I had forgotten about it so I hadn't done my hair which I needed to do before 4 since I had a kind of important presentation for one of my classes... the power was supposed to go back on at noon, which was exactly when my lab started so beforehand I emailed my instructor and told him I wasn't sure I would have wifi... at noon the power wasn't on so I joined my zoom via phone call (a fine idea until you remember that for my chem lab they do an experiment and write the data for us to use so I couldn't see what data they were using)... usually the class ends at 2 but it took the full 3 hours because my instructors would not stop talking omg it was awful... by then my power was still off and my computer was at 33% so I was freaking out and finally I decided to charge my computer in the car but I didn't have the kind of adapter for my computer to charge it in the car so I kept looking everywhere in my house and by some miracle I was able to find one so I went to the car, used it to charge my computer, and at the same time called my lab partner so we could go over our presentation... then like 30 min before the presentation my power finally started coming back on so I was able to charge my computer and then do the front part of my hair so I didn't look disgusting... yeah it was rough lol
who else loves when Castiel struggles with his growing feelings for Dean?? plus Jealous Cas is my jam - it's all sparking some tension between our two boys
Castiel's day was awful because it was so mundane. He'd had his meetings and did his work, and he was on his way home by 6.
“Are they still working on him?” Castiel interrupted Gabe’s nervous rambling. “Do they know what caused the hemorrhaging?”
"You say that now," Dean scoffed, small and sad, "but someday you're gonna resent me for holding you back 'n keeping you from making a real family."
Castiel suddenly found himself at the center of attention, which was something he truly did not enjoy.
could be Santa if he really wanted. Jack also insisted they put up stockings. All six were the same red flannel pattern with green trimming and their names sewn in white thread. Dean didn’t want to admit that he found it kind of cute.
a thought that he should be thinking. Dean Winchester was very much out of his league. Castiel would not allow himself to fall for Dean.
"Not being able to see angelic light does sound horrible. Other things too, of course, would take a toll on one's mind." Castiel said. Dean looked up at him with sad eyes.
“I want to see the gardens.” Dean repeated. “I saw the front ones when I first got here, but I haven’t seen the back gardens.”
“Gabe!” Sam slapped Gabe’s shoulder and sent Dean an apologetic look. “Sorry about him, Dean. You’re looking really good. Glowing, even.”
“Did you learn that from the pizza man?” Dean joked against Cas’s lips, because he was an idiot that wouldn’t shut up.
Still, it was nice for Dean to know that he would be home with the boys for the entire night. He hated leaving them alone at night.
“I’m sure that’s not true, Dean.” Castiel said, frowning. “Are you tails like other marine animals in appearance only? Or do they hold the functionality of what they’re imitating?”
welp a lot of stuff happened in this chapter, so hopefully that makes up for the fact that I haven't posted in a few weeks. Also I once again did not really read over this, so hopefully there aren't too many mistakes. School has started up for me again, and it's my last quarter before summer. I'm a bit busy, but hopefully I'll be able to squeeze some writing time in
Castiel heard the bathroom door lock once he had left. He waited a moment to see if the familiar needed anything. No sound came from the bathroom so he walked over to the kitchen with the decision to make two cups of coffee. He had a feeling that the familiar would not want to sleep around a stranger, or he would leave right away.
“This is kind of difficult to explain.” Sam said. “You know how wolves can be alphas, betas, or omegas?”
Castiel yawned and slumped into the couch, eyes shutting as he continued to pet Claire. Maybe he would take a small nap.
Alastair spent the next hour or so beating Castiel without an aim or goal. He did not interrogate Castiel, but instead he seemed to be taking his anger out on the angel. Castiel managed to stay calm and impassive, but it was difficult. He was bloody and bruised by the end. Feathers had been torn from his wings, adding their discomfort and agony. His left eye was swollen shut and several of his fingers were dislocated. They would heal themselves with time. Castiel's grace May be out of reach from his conscious use, but he did not think anyone could truly separate an angel from their grace, otherwise they would no longer be an angel. Since Castiel could not command his grace to heal himself, the process would be slow and much more painful than usual.
Castiel edged forward and leaned out the window. They were very far up, and a fall at this height would be fatal.
Dean’s heart sunk in his chest. He tried not to sound upset as he replied. “I see. I am even more grateful for our time today, then.”
He was glad when it was finally time to go home. Balthazar arrived just on time, so Castiel thanked his hosts and said his goodbyes before he got into the car and told Balthazar to step on it.
"Yup." Adam replied, grinning. "It's my birthday so my mama brought me to the beach to eat burgers and get ice cream."
thank you all for your patience and motivation throughout this fic (especially thanks for waiting more than a month for the final chapter) it's been a great journey writing this fic and so of course I am sad to see it end, but I'm glad that I've completed it... thanks again for sticking with it and for commenting (your words make me very happy) I hope this final chapter lived up to your expectations and I'm sorry it isn't very long
“Your fingers, or you could swallow some.” Castiel replied, shrugging. “The latter may be easier and less sticky.”
“What the fuck?” Dean murmurs to himself. He checks the receipt, wondering if maybe Castiel wrote down a number with a little, “Call me!” string attached. There’s nothing.
“Awesome.” Dean reached out and took Castiel’s hand. It sent his chest fluttering, but the weight of Dean’s hand felt so perfect.
Dean trotted behind him and nibbled on some grass. He'd explained to Castiel before that while he still had the mind of a human in an animal form, he would still feel animalistic instincts. The instincts would grow stronger the longer that Dean remained in a form, but they were always present and it was satisfying for Dean if he indulged in them a bit. Dean also explained that once he shifted back to a human he could still be influenced by whichever animal form he'd been last. It was rather amusing to watch Dean blinking slowly with half-lidded eyes after being a cat.
Jimmy was right and Castiel needed to rethink his stereotypical views on athletes. Castiel still suspected Dean was a dick, but now he’d at least wait until he had proof.
Sam breathes in deeply through his nose and then lets it out slowly. It’s probably some stupid meditation mechinism he learned in yogo, or something. It makes Dean smile to know he’s getting on Sam’s nerves.
The only parts of his days that Dean actually looked forward to were the times that Dean got to speak with Castiel.
They left Disneyland after that. There were still some things they hadn’t done, but they would be coming back for two more days, so they would have time to do other things or even redo things they liked. Sadly, Sam wasn’t able to get reservations for Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge after the first day.
Castiel was returned to his cell some hours later, always bloody and aching. Dean seemed to fret at this, and so Castiel would sit against the bars that separated them in an attempt to reassure the omega. Dean's hands would twitch, like he wanted to heal Castiel, and he would sit on the other side of the bars. Some days they were silent, others they softly chatted.
Despite Castiel’s original anxiety about meeting with everyone, the lunch went very well. It was more subdued without Dean there, and Castiel knew that he was on everyone’s minds, but they managed to enjoy themselves anyways. Jack got a lot of attention, too, which he didn’t appear to mind. It made Castiel a little protective to watch Jack from afar as the others fawned over him, but he reminded himself that these people were his family and that the pup wouldn’t be safer anywhere else.
"Yes! Let's go!" Gabriel jumped to his feet and snapped his fingers. All of the dishes and utensils on the table were suddenly clean and stacked next to the sink.
Castiel quickly went to his room where he stripped and changed into dry clothes. He brought his wet clothes back to the restroom to dry them. The ferret glanced up at him briefly, but it was still mostly interested in eating.
"I can't believe you're alive." The demon's voice was muffled but Castiel could still understand him.
Castiel chuckled wetly and reached down to stroke Dean's head. His fur was soft and silky underneath Castiel's fingertips. He fought against the tears welling up in his eyes.
“I hadn’t realized that Lucifer has such a reputation.” Castiel murmured. “You don’t need to worry about speaking honestly.”
“Listen, buddy.” Dean growled. “Nobody’s forcing your kid to be around Adam. Adam has just as much a right as Gordon does to play during recess with his friends! Your kid didn’t have to go out of his way to be a jerk.”
"Our parents were a witch/familiar couple." Sam shrugged. "Romance with permanent bonds runs in the family, I guess."
Gabriel frowned and stared down at Dean, looking thoughtful. "Yeah, that would definitely be a problem. Where is Michael anyways?"
Castiel turned off his phone and moved it to the side. There wasn’t much to do but to get ready for sleep and go to bed.
The ride went through a whole story about some rabbit, and in all honesty Dean did not pay attention.
"My nanny has quit." Castiel explained. "Would you be able to watch Claire? You could take her with you to check on your shop, as long as she doesn't eat too many treats."
Claire was in her room, like Castiel had told her to go, listening to music when they walked in. She quickly turned it off when she heard them enter and looked at them. Castiel noticed her fidgeting, he knew she was nervous and uncomfortable.
run to the door. He tried to collect himself as he unlocked the door. It made no sense for him to be in such a state. He had had other nannies last more than a day before, Dean was no different.
Gabriel looked like he wanted to say more, but Claire came bounding around the corner with her backpack.
Castiel brushed up against the magical barrier lightly, and his frowned deepened. The magic did not seem to stem from anything other than the ferret itself, which meant that the ferret was producing it somehow.
"Cream or sugar?" Castiel offered. The familiar took a hesitant step forward and then another. He sat down at the counter and sniffed at his coffee.
There’s something heavy and sad in Castiel’s tone, but Dean doesn’t know what to do about that so he just leaves. He chats with Castiel a little each time he checks in on the table, but after their initial meeting Castiel appears to lose interest in Dean. It’s a bummer, but Dean’s not going to take it to heart. Obviously the guy is dealing with something.
All the logic in the world wouldn’t soothe the ache of knowing Jack wanted what Castiel couldn’t give to him.
The squirrel took a step away from the edge of the hood, closer to Castiel. It still looked like it was ready to dart, though.
Nephilim were powerful. Too powerful. That was the primary reason that angels and humans could not mate. It was difficult to keep them in check, even for the archangels. Castiel had never met one, the last one was born centuries ago. He hadn't known that Nephilim were born with wings.
"Yeah, I heard a few things." Bobby said. "I'm telling you now that we're going to keep them both safe, from you if we have to."
Castiel was deteriorating rapidly. Dean, on the other hand, was not. While the omega weakened, Castiel could see that it was at a slower pace than himself, which reaffirmed his belief that Dean was not an angel, but a Nephilim.
Castiel didn't reply. He thought about how he would love to be excited and nervous to go on a date. How he had often longed to have someone to hold in bed.  How Castiel could actually be happy instead of just content.
"I'm sorry, Dean, but it's a strong possibility." Ellen said. "I would suggest you take a pregnancy test, and then we'll figure out what to do."
"So get this,” Dean said as he entered the library. He ignored Sam’s bitchface and sat down next to his brother with his computer propped up.
