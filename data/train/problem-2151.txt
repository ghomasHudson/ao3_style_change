No, John. Of course he didn’t answer. It’s a coincidence. I shake my head. He’s already turned away again.
I thank him nevertheless, for everything, and he smiles then, briefly and out of Sherlock's field of vision.
.” He’s such a wanker. “How can John be having a birthday dinner? All his friends hate him. You only have to look at their faces. I wrote an essay on suppressed hatred in close proximity based entirely on his friends.” Definitely the
“Yes, yes,” he says with a wave of his hand. “I’m just thinking, John. I’m allowed to think, I gather? Engage in some mental acrobatics?”
He studies his face, the greying strands woven into the dark curls surrounding it, the deepening lines around his eyes and mouth. He takes in his body, or as much of it as he can see from this angle, and he can't help but mourn the loss of the smooth, lanky, almost boyish looks he used to be so proud of in the past.
He doesn't have enough hands. His left arm is trapped between Sherlock's upper back and the mattress, his hand clutching the back of his neck, and his right hand is busy thrusting into his wet, welcoming warmth, faster and faster, and he wants all of it, all at once, Sherlock's mouth against his, his pulsing length in his hand, too, and his tight passage throbbing around his fingers, but it's not possible, at least not while lying here with him like this, so he settles for the next best thing.
"Remember when Mrs H used to complain about the noise?" John wants to know, and Sherlock has to concentrate
, that he thought he was lying in bed with his now ex-girlfriend when he woke up doesn't seem like such a great idea.
He practically rips the clothes off my body as soon as we get to the bedroom, but when he attempts to use the same speed on himself, I hold his wrists and slow him down.
wrong…" John whispers and finally puts his fingers around Sherlock's hot, hard length to caress it with light, barely-there pressure.
, and he slides inside deeply, right up to his knuckle, and stops, and waits, and tries not to cry with relief at finally being allowed to do this.
“Where’s your list?” Mycroft asks and sits down next to him. “You look repulsing. How much did you take?”
“You don’t have to talk if you don’t want to, or if you can’t. But whenever you’re ready, I’ll be there. Anytime, Sherlock. And we can talk about everything else, too, when the moment is right. You can be angry at me. I--- I deserve it. I just want us to get through this together.”
It sounds small and pleading and completely unlike the last time he used that line, and John's heart aches at the memory of losing him back then, and at the thought of maybe losing him again someday. He doesn't know what he'd do without him.
“Hold on, love,” John tries to protest when one of Sherlock’s hands starts to fumble with the button and zipper of his trousers. “Let’s take this sl—
"No." John shakes his head, sounding breathless, but definite. "Don't stop. Just--- need to get used to it. Got a bit… overwhelmed there."
Sherlock gives back in kind, licking into John's mouth to play with his tongue, and at the same time shrugs off his jacket and opens his cuffs.
. It doesn’t take long. After a minute or two, John goes rigid in his arms and reaches his climax, his relieved sigh singeing Sherlock’s skin, and Sherlock squeezes the back of his neck and sobs silently when the wetness of the other man’s semen hits his stomach in three forceful spurts. He loves him so much. “
John is breathing hard, his back rising and falling rapidly, but he doesn't say a word. Doesn't make a sound.
He sits on the edge of her bed for a little while longer, just to watch her sleep and enjoy the first real quiet moment of the day. As he looks at her peaceful face, he wonders if she senses what she’s done for Sherlock today—and how she’s helped him learn to accept himself a little more.
He grins that insanely attractive lopsided grin of his and closes the distance between us. His arms come up and around me, and I stand there, completely paralysed, and let it happen. He sighs deeply and presses his mouth against my ear, then my temple, then my mouth. When I don’t reciprocate, he smiles and bumps his forehead against mine.
He settles back on the floor and freezes, his eyes wide open, his mouth slightly agape. His arm is twisted at an awkward angle. I realise he’s practised this before, maybe in front of a mirror, or with Mycroft.
John's fingers are in his hair now, opening and closing randomly, his face buried in his shoulder, his whole body glowing and heavy with exhaustion and release.
His head is empty. He takes off his jacket to buy some time and watches Sherlock take off his gloves, coat, and scarf, revealing his black Armani suit and that ridiculously expensive purple shirt that's just the tiniest bit too tight (and most definitely too sexy for someone who keeps insisting that sex is "not really his area").
John doesn't need any more encouragement than that. Carefully, he moves his finger in and out in small, shallow thrusts, and with each and every one Sherlock's body opens up to him a little more. The sensation of his muscles gripping him, throbbing around him, is divine, and John has to clench his teeth against the onslaught of desire, of impatience it evokes in him.
"I'm scared. But I want it, and I want it to be you. If--- if you want to, that is. Only if you want to." John licks his lips again and kisses him once more, very softly, and then rubs their cheeks together in an unmistakable gesture of affection. "Do you?" he breathes.
He takes off his sweat-soaked and blood-soiled trousers, shirt, and pants and throws them into the sink. He'll have to try and get rid of the stains later. He hasn't brought too many changes of clothes - if you're on the run, it's advisable to travel light. Then he steps into the shower.
Looking at Sherlock's lips, John remembers his taste and the sensation of his mouth brushing against his and wonders how it's possible that he's the first one to have seen and felt him like that, the first one to be granted this privilege. He's so beautiful, so sensual, and so profoundly unaware of his own attractiveness. It's hard to imagine no one ever tried to make all that theirs. Well. Maybe people did try, but he didn't let them in. John is immensely proud that it's him Sherlock chose to be the first he shared himself with. He'll be the last one, the
Sherlock's cock is nudging his stomach with every thrust of his hips, and John reaches down and between them to wrap his fingers around it.
I clench my jaw. Donovan is lucky – she’s not going to be the one who’ll feel my anger today. Oh, no. I take a step towards the man, staring at his face, blood roaring in my ears. He looks slightly taken aback now.
than John remembers it, but those other ones were not Sherlock, so it probably wasn't the same at all.
I do it again, and again. He stifles his reactions, which are becoming more and more vocal the longer I keep it up, in the pillow, and after a while I deem him relaxed enough to put a second finger in along with the first. He groans deeply, the sound vibrating through him so that I can feel it from the inside, and begins to rock his hips.
“Okay.” I take a deep breath and open my hands in an appeasing gesture. “What do you want me to do, then?”
They're silent for a while, staring into the middle distance. John feels like a stranger in his own home. He thinks of Sherlock, out there with his bees, and wonders if he's cold.
He remembers Sherlock collecting more data by kissing him until they both couldn't breathe and obviously finding his results sufficient to take it a step further; he remembers hands, four of them, tangled in hair, then clothes, tearing, stripping, looking for more more
Crouching there on the street, staring at the unseeing eyes of the only human being that has ever really mattered to him, John feels his soul die.
John's feet are glued to the floor. He knows he should go and check on Sherlock; he knows he's relying on him to be his backup. But he can't. Sherlock sounds shocked and frightened, and the latter is the reason why John in turn feels the ground fall from under his feet. Sherlock is not frightened of anything. Never. What is he seeing in there?
The flickering has stopped and the emergency lights have come on. Considering the circumstances, John is astonished to find that the passengers around him are behaving in an extraordinarily calm manner. The baby’s still crying, but most of the other people are relatively quiet. Some of them are hugging each other, talking in low voices. Some seem to be praying. Others are staring right ahead of themselves, their fingers digging into the armrests of their seats.
“I don’t know,” he answers, his arm tightening its hold around my waist. “There are other countries where the laws are not as strict. If we lived in Paris, we would not have to pretend as much. At least we could share a bed and no one would put us in prison for it.”
John puts down his bags, steps towards him, and holds out his hand, and Sherlock stares at his own feet and hands him a transparent evidence bag like the ones he sometimes takes to crime scenes. Inside, John can see the napkin with his message, carefully smoothed out.
letting go now, John can feel it, and it’s a stunning thing to witness. John can’t remember ever being this aroused before.
Sherlock moans and hooks his thumbs into the waistband of John’s trousers, grazing the top of his buttocks as he does so. The contact is electric.
"Past lovers informed me that--- that the strain this inability of mine puts on a relationship is too much to deal with. That it--- isn't worth it."
Sherlock huffs and tightens his grip on John, his whole body trembling. When he opens his mouth, John uses the opportunity to nip at his full bottom lip, and when the other man doesn’t pull away at that, he lets his tongue sneak out to dip against it. Sherlock’s breathing accelerates. Blindly, John slides his palms along his friend’s arms and shoulders and then up the sides of his neck until he can bury his fingers in his wild, unruly curls.
“Not right now, no. I’m sorry. The doctors have put him on painkillers. He is, to use his own words, completely “shitfaced” at the moment. He loves it, as you can imagine. He’s not fit to talk.”
His beard is rough on my skin, but his lips and tongue are soft. His hands are in my hair, his fingernails grazing my scalp. He sucks at my pulse point and groans, and the vibrations of his voice ripple through me, making me shiver. Everything between us is hot, slick,
He can’t watch the storm raging outside; it’s making him too nervous. His neighbour seems to have withdrawn into her own head to meditate, her hands clasped in her lap, so he gazes at his own legs and tries to think of something nice. The cup of tea he’s going to have when he gets home--- no, first to Sherlock’s. Definitely to Sherlock’s, he thinks. Just for an hour, and then he’ll go home. An hour or two, listening to Sherlock talking about a new case or the idiots at the Yard.
John smiles and turns his head for a sloppy, lopsided kiss, and Sherlock's heart starts to pound. If he's not careful, he's going to say something stupid really soon.
A scream of anguish sits in his chest, right behind his ribs, somewhere to the right of where his heart is beating steadily despite it all, keeping his body alive. But the scream doesn't come out. It just waits there, crushing him from the inside.
on the now seemingly indifferent features, is what causes him to make up his mind. He's noticed the way Wilkes stared at him when he walked through the door and he has to admit to himself that he's flattered – it's been a while since someone ogled him like that, and it feels good. Well. It
He wants this to work out. He's scared for their friendship, more scared than ever before, but he's determined to give his all to do it right. This is too important, too precious to lose. He'd die if John took it away from him again.
"You taste like bergamot," John whispers, trailing messy, open-mouthed kisses along his side, his hip, then coming back up to tease his navel with the tip of his tongue. "Do you taste like that
"Dada!" she said when he approached them, and he pointed at Sherlock and asked, just to make sure: "Who's that, Rosie?"
Up until the moment John touched his back he thought he'd never want anything more than he wants the drugs, the hazy fog of forgetting, of peace and quiet and warmth, to be enjoyed all by himself, wrapped up inside the comforting blanket of his high mind.
He closes his eyes and gives himself over to the rhythm – Sherlock is so hot inside that the still warm bath water seems almost cool in contrast, and John drowns in the sensation, his whole middle pulsing,
“Hmpf,” John huffs and bites down on Sherlock’s bottom lip, tugs at it with his teeth before letting it go again and pulling back to look at his face. Sherlock’s pupils are blown wide, making his irises look almost entirely black.
Sherlock smiles again and wraps his fingers around John’s hand, lifting it to his mouth and setting a kiss onto it. He then sets another, and another. His eyes open, and they are bright and full of honesty. “John Watson,” he says. “Right now, the only wish I have is to kiss you.”
“It didn’t, Holmes.” I try to speak gently, perplexed by this uncharacteristic outburst. In all the years I have known my friend, I have never seen him lose his composure this completely. “The only casualty are my favourite trousers - that bullet and your pocket knife saw to that. You do not have to blame yourself for anything. It was my decision to come along on the adventure, and I knew about the dangers it might pose. It may have been a close call, but I’ll recover. We’ll be more careful next time. You don’t have to forgive yourself anything. There’s nothing to forgive.”
Even now, after all those years, he sometimes still can’t believe it’s real: how much he loves Sherlock, and how much Sherlock loves him back.
There’s a challenge in his words, a challenge for me to admit my doubts in him, but he also sounds insecure, so I turn to look at him again.
Lestrade is right in front of the bedroom door now, and I can hear other voices in the background, too. They’ve come to take him away.
They stay like that for a minute or two, looking at each other, but John knows they'll have to separate soon – it’ll be more comfortable to do so while he’s still at least half-hard, and his arms are beginning to cramp from carrying his weight for such a long time.
He groans and laughs simultaneously, still shaking with the aftershocks of his climax, sounding happy and carefree for once, and I hold my finger inside him until he stops moving, revelling in the waves of release thrumming through my own body.
They're in bed together, lying next to each other like they always do, after any normal day, and yet
She looks up at him, and suddenly the little girl she used to be is sitting there right next to him on the couch, blonde and blue-eyed, her face so much like his own that he sometimes, after looking at her for too long,  had to shake himself in wonder –
Sherlock’s bedroom smells just like him, and John feels intoxicated by the scent when Sherlock drags him through the door and then kicks it closed with his foot before embracing him again, his face nuzzling his hair.
He knows the feeling – he's felt it before, during the war. But this time it's different. What are the chances of another Sherlock coming along to pick him up and save him and bring him back to life? How often do you get a second try at being happy? There's no one else like Sherlock, anyway. And John doesn't
"You said you wanted Sebastian to think that a person like you could catch himself a person like me."
He pulls out, immediately missing John's presence around him, and rolls onto his side to give him room to get up, but the other man surprises him by moving with him and fitting himself against his front, not an inch of air in between, and kissing his shoulder, almost aggressively, seemingly lost for words.
John kisses him on the forehead delicately. “No. Listen to me,” he says, the firmness in his voice a stark contrast to the tender kisses he places on Sherlock’s skin. “You are one of the kindest, most loving people I’ve ever known. Though you put on this harsh, mysterious persona, you aren’t fooling anyone—not anymore. I’m sorry that people were terrible to you in the past, and I know how much it must have hurt you—and must hurt you, still—but things are different, now. You, like Rosie, are loved by so many, and we would never allow that to happen.” He glances down at the tiny scar on his hand; the one he’d gained by breaking the eyeglasses of a police chief who’d dared to call Sherlock odd. “In case you’d forgotten,” he adds.
“I love you, Sherlock,” he tells him, for what feels like the hundredth time that night, as he begins to circle Sherlock’s opening to spread some slickness there. “And I’m so proud to be the one you’ve chosen.”
“I’m ready to go home,” Sherlock replies, wrapping his arms more tightly around their daughter and standing up carefully so he doesn’t awaken her.
His legs are quivering. Sherlock smiles as a surge of possessive power floods his insides, and he wants to see how far he has to go to make John lose control.
"Of course," Sherlock says, his tone slightly metallic. "This is your bedroom. You do whatever you want in it."
They fall asleep eventually, and when they wake up again, lunchtime has long come and gone. John helps Sherlock to wash and put on a fresh pair of pyjamas, then puts on his own. He can tell it's going to be a slow day, so why not stay comfortable right away?
I feel him breathe under my palms as I open his waistcoat to give me better access to what lies underneath, and when a satisfyingly large part of his endless neck has been freed from the confinement of his shirt I pull him against me and latch onto the white skin on display to kiss my way up towards the edge of his jaw, careful to employ my moustache to my advantage. He tastes like heaven and feels like expensive silk against my lips and tongue.
"You never cease to amaze me. You've hidden this part of your personality quite well for a very long time."
He walks in on him just like that, naked, and joins him under the warm spray, and John is surprised, but goes along with it.
But John is also a father now. And he swore to himself that he'd never have other people look after his child if he could help it. He doesn't want to be a burden to anybody - not to Mrs Hudson, and neither to Molly. Shortly after Mary's death, both women were indispensable sources of comfort and support to him, and he'll never forget how they helped him to get through the first rough months. Even now, both keep offering to take Rosie if need be, but he's trying to keep it to a minimum. Molly has a job to take care of, and her free time is scarce as it is. And he doesn't want Mrs Hudson to have to add "Not your babysitter!" to her long (and completely justified) arsenal of reprimands. Soon Rosie will be old enough for day care, and then Sherlock and John will be able to go back to how it was before, at least during the day. At night, still only one of them will be able to go out to investigate, and it will still most likely be Sherlock.
Sherlock's smile fades into a more serious expression and John can tell he knows, but he's relieved to see that he doesn't look upset. He looks wistful.
At long last, John's arms come up as well and he slings them around Sherlock's back and grips the fabric of his shirt, as if to make sure that he's really there.
Then, suddenly and without warning, Sherlock turns towards him and fixes him with a look that pierces right through him, ripping his heart apart and taking his breath away. He's hurt him; it's plain to see. And, even worse, Sherlock never expected him to.
John is crazy for Sherlock, more infatuated than he's ever been before. No other lover has ever made him feel like this.
No one has ever done something like this to me, and no one has ever spoken words like these to me either. It’s hard to think straight with his tongue pushing its way inside of me, but I still marvel at how he’s expressing his desire. I’m all for dirty talk, love doing it myself, but he’s so delightfully old-fashioned. It’s arousing and endearing in equal measures.
His large hands are gripping the back of John's neck by now, and John revels in the feeling of connectedness this gives him.
"Are you serious? Why… didn't you say anything? I would have--- I don't know, I probably would have done a few things differently."
The cool water running over his body shocks him at first, but after a minute he gets used to it, and he closes his eyes and puts his head under the spray, feeling grime and sweat and blood being cleaned off his skin. It's a divine feeling, although the gash in his arm hurts as the water hits it and washes clots of old blood and specks of dirt away.
tomorrow morning. But who could care about that with an armful of half-asleep, thoroughly debauched Sherlock pressed against his body? It’s too sweet.
When they disembark the cab and enter the corridors of Rosie’s school, John is astonished to see that Sherlock isn’t exhibiting telltale signs of nervousness. Sherlock is so well-practised at hiding his emotions, though, that even John, who knows him better than anyone, can barely perceive them at times. But this time, even the faint twitch at the corner of his mouth and the barely-there hunch of the shoulders are hidden amidst his trademark air of confidence.
, to say the least, doesn't make it easier, but there you are. Sherlock has made it clear that he's out of bounds, and if, now and then, John allows himself to venture into the realm of imagination and indulge in that somehow forbidden fantasy to let off some steam, it's perfectly fine. It's not like he's going to act on it and ruin this, whatever it is.
John could never deny him anything, not when he begs like this, and he can feel that he’s still slick down there, still relaxed and open for him, so he just continues where he’s left off, teasing him with a few light brushes over his perineum before sliding two fingers back inside.
He’s adorably soft and slow when under the influence, John thinks. He nods, his vision trying hard to keep up with the movements of his head.
I run my tongue along the tendon standing out at the side of his long, white neck and moan against his damp skin, feeling the frantic beat of his pulse flutter against my lips. It is utter bliss to be with him like this, to see him let go of all his demons and be the one responsible for it, and in a fit of possessive pride I put my palm over the place where his heart is drumming as if it wanted to burst out from behind his ribs.
"That is your wish, and I'd never deny you anything," he replies lowly. "Just know that you can always change your mind, up to the last minute, and I won't think any less of you and--- and our love."
It's their first time, and occasionally he feels clumsy, but it's still the best thing he's ever done.
I lie awake for hours and gaze at the ceiling while I play with his hair. I hope the touch will reach him, deep down in the realms of dreams, and prevent him from slipping back into the nightmare to get a good night’s rest instead.
They look at each other, the short expanse of floorboards beneath their feet stretching out like an insurmountable obstacle, like an ocean of unsaid things. John hates it.
He enjoys it immensely when John takes control - letting go and giving him the lead is an almost cathartic experience, because it's so different from what they usually do, from everyday life and work. Sherlock needs it, needs to shut off his brain and surrender from time to time, and John knows that and is willing to cater to that need.
“There’s nothing to forgive,” Sherlock says and raises a hand to brush some stray strands of hair that have fallen into John’s forehead aside.
His breathing picks up; his nostrils flare. Sherlock can see his abdomen move up and down rapidly as both his hands curl into fists at his sides.
Sherlock isn’t sure whether he should be happy or upset that John is still there when he finally enters the sitting room again, freshly showered and dressed in his favourite suit. He feels slightly more comfortable, now that he’s equipped with his usual armour of impeccable style and impassive expression, but the latter is difficult to uphold with the cause of all his troubles so close by.
“I can’t go any deeper…” he rumbles. “But give me some room and I’ll give you the best… fucking… orgasm… of your life…” He accentuates his words by grinding his hips in slow circles, his bollocks sliding against Sherlock’s arse. Sherlock moans and laughs and loosens his grip on him.
He distantly remembers a dream he's had while he was asleep, one about Sherlock standing on the roof of St.Bart's, his eyes wild, his voice desperate.
"I know that, and I'm grateful," he tells her. "But I don't want it to happen like that. I want to do it on my own terms."
John is so warm there behind him, so silky-smooth and yet rock-hard, and he closes his eyes and waits for him to come closer still.
John and Mrs Hudson and Molly and Mycroft are there all the time, but he's still alone, and no amount of monitoring will ever change the fact that John has stopped believing in him. He's stopped
"Your priorities are becoming clearer by the second, Mycroft. Your reptilian reputation might do you an injustice after all."
He thinks of the last time he did this, years and years ago, and hopes his body still remembers, because his brain is shutting down in anticipation of what's to come, and he really can't blame it.
“Sherlock, you’re so special. You’re unique,” he tells him, his hand still on his cheek. “Donovan has no idea who you really are. None of them has. Hell, sometimes I’m not even sure
, Sherlock,” he pants, his tongue running along the insides of Sherlock’s lips, luxuriating in his familiar taste. “Mmhhh.”
“Do you see now?” Sherlock continues. “Do you see what I am? I’m trouble. I make mistakes – so many mistakes, John. I ask of you not to feel guilty because of me. It would break me to know you did. Stop it right now.
Their difference in height makes it impossible to grind against each other the way Sherlock wants to, so he takes hold of John's thigh and pulls until he can feel the shorter man's arousal throb against his stomach, and it's so good. He's rock-hard and silky as he glides against Sherlock's skin, and then John moans and lifts his leg across Sherlock's hip to give himself leverage, which allows Sherlock's cock to slip between his thighs and slide against his arse, and that is good, too. Very good.
Sherlock shuffles forwards a little and puts his face right against the trail of silver-blond curls leading from John's navel down to his crotch. He smells different here, like clean skin and musk, and his muscles are rippling against his lips, betraying his excitement. He can't deny that it arouses him to be John's first man - to have Captain "Three Continents" Watson here in his bedroom, naked and trembling and all his to seduce.
Sherlock raises his eyebrows, but doesn't reply. John knows he despises irrational reactions like the one he's experiencing right now, but thankfully he keeps his thoughts to himself.
He storms off and into his bedroom and throws himself onto the bed, his head buried in his pillow. He needs it all to stop. Why don't they just let him be? Why isn't he allowed to numb the ache?
uses this shower gel, and John mocks him for spending so much money on it, so he doesn't really need to point it out, and
John’s arousal wanes a bit. He’s sure Sherlock can feel the blood pounding through his veins from how he’s holding on to his arms.
He holds on to John when he begins to establish a rhythm, presses his heels into the mattress to give him leverage, and after a minute or two his mind goes blank. He stops thinking about doing things wrong, of losing control, of losing himself in this. Maybe it's supposed to feel like that, even. What does he know?
sorry I brought it up. Let’s not talk about it all tonight. Not while I’m here with you like this. Please. Let’s enjoy this for a little while longer.”
," he curses lowly and nuzzles the place, inhales Sherlock's scent, and then he licks up his whole clothed length, gently scraping his teeth along it.
He feels himself get angry - at himself, at John, at the man that made John what he is today. It's too much to handle, especially right now, with them in bed together and John's cock inside of him, and he can't
John places one hand on each side of Sherlock’s face to steady him, his fingers tugging lightly at Sherlock’s curls as he kisses him back. He can feel Sherlock’s lips smiling against his own, and he can’t help but mirror the expression.
His fingers trembling, he holds out the petroleum jelly to me, and I dip into it and then take myself in hand to spread it thickly all along my shaft. He drops the tin to the floor, where it rolls away and comes to a halt halfway across the room.
He doesn't know what this will become, doesn't know if they'll make it in the end – but he's looking forward to more "data", more Sherlock, more of
From the moment I woke up, I’ve been thinking about how little I’ve actually thought about what exactly it is that Sherlock’s been up to for the last two years. Sure, I’ve been worried about him, scared that something might happen, that he could be injured, or worse, but I’ve never really wondered what it is that he’s doing. Plotting, waiting. Hunting down Moriarty’s men. Hurting people. Being hurt. Killing people.
And if he, already half-asleep, feels a twinge of sadness afterwards, when John gathers up his things and leaves to go to bed, it's not nearly as bad as when he was lying here, craving for his pills.
He disentangles himself from John’s embrace and gets up from the floor. Then he holds out his hand. John looks up at him and takes it, allowing himself to be pulled to his feet. His legs are still shaking.
“The newspapers were right all along. I want you to tell Lestrade; I want you to tell Mrs Hudson, and Molly… In fact, tell anyone who will listen to you that I created Moriarty for my own purposes.”
wish I could, to show him that he is the best thing that has ever happened to me, but of course I keep silent and bite back my cries of relief as I spill my release inside the only person in the world I have ever truly loved. It is bliss beyond measure, pleasure so great that it borders on pain, and everything around me goes black.
“Good,” he says and slowly scissors his fingers, opening me up even more. “Get on your back, John… I want to look at your face.”
I snort out a chuckle and bite the insides of my cheeks to distract myself. He opens his lips once more and slides them up and down the vein pulsing on the underside of my length, his tongue flickering out teasingly from time to time, his challenging gaze fixed on my face. Watching him like this drives me out of my mind with desire, and when his teeth join his tongue to glide along my hardness, not in a bite, but in a gentle caress, I cannot contain myself any longer.
I cringe. Even with her face all puffy and her mascara running down her cheeks she manages to look extraordinarily intimidating.
He grumbles and shifts, the bedclothes rustling at the other end of the line, and then I hear his breathing even out. He’s falling asleep.
“Sherlock,” he interrupts him and puts his palms on Sherlock’s sides to rub up and down soothingly, the heels of his hands brushing the waistband of his black boxers every so often. “There’s no reason to be scared. It’s an experiment, remember? We can do everything we want. We don’t
The lamp is still burning. The condom has slipped off his limp cock and is now dripping its contents all over his thigh. He doesn't care.
“I have no idea what I’m doing here,” he mumbles into Sherlock’s ear and licks his earlobe. “I apologise in advance.”
“What is it, my love?” I ask, panting, pleasantly surprised at the ease with which the term of endearment falls from my lips. “Getting weak in the knees…?”
All of a sudden, he can’t breathe. He grabs the zipper of his jacket and pulls it down hastily, almost aggressively.
– know. It's so good to have him back. But is he really here to stay? He wouldn't have made the decision to come back and bring Rosie if he didn't mean it to be permanent, would he?
"I'm--- I'm sorry if I hurt you, okay?" he tells Sherlock, his hands held up in an appeasing gesture. "It was stupid. I didn't think. I just hated him so much for assuming you didn't have friends, and I--- I mean--- It made
Sherlock looks at him, calmly and steadily, and lets his thighs fall open in a very plain gesture of invitation. Then he takes John's hand and pushes it between his legs, down,
“I’m--- I’m jealous, I think,” he says lowly. “I was very jealous last night. It confused me. I’ve been jealous of your girlfriends before, but that was different. You didn’t… belong to me back then.”
all around you now, love… I’m there with you, holding you, caressing you everywhere… kissing your face, your closed eyes, your lips…”
John looks at him then, his dark-blue eyes glowing with an intense emotion Sherlock finds difficult to read.
), and then his finger goes away and returns again immediately, slicker, to go back inside, deeper this time. Much deeper.
I feel myself blush. He shakes his head, but his gaze softens and he leans down again to kiss my left nipple this time, ending the kiss with a bit of teeth and tongue. And a lot of beard.
"Sorry… I didn't mean to wake you," Sherlock whispers, his voice carrying an undertone that John can't identify. "Sorry, John. Go back to sleep."
“I’m sorry,” I whisper when I’ve found my voice again. I know she loves you too. “I’m sorry, Molly.”
"Baby," John says softly, and he can't remember the last time he called him that. "You're the best thing that's ever happened to me. Come on now… Hold on to my shoulders."
Hettie does play the Stradivarius later, for all of them, and Rosie laughs and almost-cries at the same time, telling her not to drop it. Sherlock holds their daughter's hand all through the song, and when it ends and everyone claps, the shuddering breaths he takes tell John that he's having a hard time not to give in to his churned-up emotions as well.
, right there at the entrance to the place he wants to go so badly, and then he slides inside, slowly, steadily, and Sherlock shakes in his arms and moans and bites his lip to stifle the sound.
John takes off his clothes, then helps him to take off his own, and he tries to participate somehow, but feels clumsy and like his limbs do not belong to him anymore.
I'm not afraid of this at all, I find. I'd let him do anything to me. I know this should worry me, at least mildly, but it doesn't. It makes me want him even more.
He loves feeling John come inside him, has always done so – nothing makes him feel more connected, more as one with his lover than the sensation of liquid heat being poured out inside his body, because it's proof of what they've just done, and proof of John wanting him, taking pleasure in him.
His voice trembles, and John can hear his heart stutter. And suddenly he knows what to say, and what they need to get out of all of this alive. It’s so simple, really. It’s the only thing on his mind right now that might be enough to make it all right again.
When he’s satisfied that his right hand is as prepared as it’s going to get, he uses his left to caress Sherlock’s abdomen.
I trail off and sink back down on my chair. I know the way this man moves, and I know the way he holds his head.
,” Sherlock utters and grips John’s buttocks to squeeze them, and when John uses his teeth again, he feels the other man’s cock harden against his stomach.
"Fuck me; fuck me---" he hears himself whisper, and he can't control his voice; it just bubbles out of him, like an involuntary mantra.
I want him to bite me again, but I don't know how to ask for it. Turns out I needn't have worried - he seems to be able to read my mind.
“My fingers…?” I ask lowly, trailing them down his side and between his cheeks until I reach his hot, damp opening. It twitches against the pad of my middle finger as I stroke a light circle around its edge. “Like… this?”
Sherlock doesn’t react. His eyes remain closed, and judging by his steady breathing, it seems that he’s already doing just that.
Sherlock tastes of honey and lavender, which is not unpleasant, but John wants the real thing, so he bends down as far as his back allows him to and sucks the way he knows the other man likes it, determined to keep at it until the only taste left on his tongue is
He’s seen it happen in porn movies, and he hopes against hope that despite being completely out of his depths when it comes to sex with a man he will be able to make Sherlock come without using his hands – he’d be so proud of that.
“I get it,” I interrupt him. “I get it, alright? Listen…” I close the distance between us and take his head in my hands. “This is the last time I say sorry for this – the last time, okay? I’m sorry for being so fucking dense. I’m sorry for hurting you. I’m sorry for being weak and self-centred and whiny. And I’m sorry for saying sorry instead of doing something about it.”
“I'll make up for the time we've lost, Sherlock,” I say between kisses. “For all those years. I’ll love you with every fibre of my being. Every single day. That is my promise to you.”
He runs his fingers down my temples, my jaw and the sides of my neck, and I shudder - he's so gentle, so soft right now, and I can't believe how proud it makes me feel to be the focus of his tenderness.
John shakes his head and trails his palms along his sides, then up to his chest. Finding his nipples, he flicks them with his thumbs, and Sherlock trembles in response.
“Let’s dim the light in here a bit, okay?” he asks and walks over to the window to draw the curtains until only a narrow ray of sun is left, bathing the foot of the bed in its washed-out yellow glow.
Sherlock’s body is limp and heavy when he manoeuvers him into his lap again and helps him to sling his legs around his waist, but when John slips his hands under his arse to lift him up and give himself space to enter him, he suddenly comes back to life.
His skin, over-sensitive due to fatigue, tingles everywhere they touch, and John only intensifies the feeling when he clambers between his legs and rubs his whole front against his, all the way from chest to groin. Sherlock moans lowly, and John gives a deep chuckle and buries the fingers of his left hand in his hair, rocking his hips with small, slow thrusts that drive Sherlock insane.
"Sherlock, I---" he starts, racking his brain for a way to apologise, but Sherlock doesn't let him finish.
John doesn't know what to do, and not even Mary's ghost provides him with insights as to how to proceed. She made him save Sherlock. Made Sherlock save him, whatever that means.
John kisses his brow and doesn't answer. Maybe his comparison is faulty, he thinks. Sherlock's feathers won't grow and eventually turn him into a beautiful, proud creature that'll one day spread its wings and fly away. He shed them all during a long, laborious and completely pointless treatment that's left him weak and a mere shadow of his former self, at least on the outside. How John had wanted him to be like a phoenix, dying just to be reborn, strong enough to overcome the threat of the cruel, merciless disease that was trying to take him from him. He'd been hoping for so long.
I bite my lip, feeling the giddy feeling ebb away. I’m so happy that my last days working here will not be tainted by the icy silence of the past weeks, and I want to let her know.
There's a barely-there prick on the side of his neck, and a second later he feels his knees buckle. Hands being pushed under his armpits prevent him from falling over, and then Mycroft half-carries, half-frogmarches him towards the door leading to the stairs.
“You know what, on second thought… Let’s not use our daughter’s favourite picture book as dirty talk material. It feels… wrong.”
"I have to put some things in the fridge before they go off," he says lowly. "Do you have time for your first lesson then?"
"Your wellbeing was always his first priority," Mycroft says, not letting on that he's in any way offended by John's tone.
Ever so gently, he dictates my movements, pushing and pulling me up and down, and I suck with all the finesse I can muster, determined to make it the best experience of this kind he has ever had. My cock, still overly sensitive due to our previous encounter, is pulsing violently, the friction of the sheets against the tender skin almost too much and still not enough.
When I come back to reality, I'm always a little sad that I'll never have the real thing, a little disappointed in myself because I still haven't managed to get over it, and a little embarrassed.
John sighs and turns away to go back inside and finds himself face to face with his son-in-law. He jumps a little – he thought he was alone.
Sherlock starts to pant and attempts to simultaneously get some distance between John's mouth and his neck and pull him even closer against his body by pressing his hands against the small of his back.
But not today. Today he needs to rest, and John has to grin when he thinks back to what happened yesterday afternoon (twice, and in two different beds) and last night (unplanned, on the couch, and really quietly, with Rosie sleeping in her cot only a thin ceiling away), and a juvenile kind of pride fills him –
“Sherlock,” John repeats. “We’ve got to—” he cuts his own words off by latching onto the long, white neck so conveniently located in front of his face and licking a deft stripe from his pulse point up to his jaw.
He’s busy between my legs, sucking me with wanton sounds of pleasure, his middle finger sliding in and out of me at the same time, going deeper and deeper, preparing me for what’s to come. He’s passionate, but very gentle, listening to my responses and adjusting his ministrations accordingly, and I’m surprised to find that I'm already so far gone, already halfway out of my mind.
, and now he's got neither the time nor the nerve to evaluate the data that's crashing in on him from all sides.
John smiles to himself and slips into bed beside him, wrapping his arm around him from behind and bringing his front flush against his back. Sherlock is warm and soft and feels like heaven, and he closes his eyes and settles in to go to sleep as well. They normally don’t sleep in the nude, not after the first time Rosie had a nightmare and found them here stark naked and still caught up in the afterglow, but he thinks they’ll be alright just this once.
"Let it--- wash over you," he says, leaning forwards until his palms are resting beside John's on the mattress and he can rub his face into his hair. "Don't fight it."
He has to break off because the wave is rolling towards him now and he forgets how to speak, and all he can do is watch John watching him in return, his mouth open as if in awe, his face contorted in a grimace of lust.
“If they ever find out what I did, I’ll go to prison for the rest of my life. Not even Mycroft could save me then… and I’m not sure he should.”
Mary’s face flickers before his inner eye, frowning at him, but the vision is pushed aside by an image of Sherlock’s mouth on his penis, his tongue pink and glistening, licking his tip.
When they first started sleeping together, Sherlock needed some time to get used to the pillow talk – not because he didn't like the way John whispered into his ear what he wanted to do to him and called him
Murmured conversations break out all around him, and in the midst of the snippets he can make out (“No,
"Can I taste your beautiful cock, Sherlock?" he asks huskily, because he can't resist pushing him a bit.
His lips slide along my penis from base to head, his breath so hot on my skin, and then he pushes at my hips to turn me around and administers a gentle bite to my left buttock before licking his way right into my crack.
"Let me," John pants and blindly begins to unbutton Sherlock’s shirt, starting at his collar and working his way down until he has to pull it out of his trousers to reach the last button, and Sherlock isn’t wearing anything underneath, and then their fronts are touching, and John moans and slides his arms to Sherlock’s back to feel him closer,
He wants him to stop and turn around. He wants him to stay. He wants to call out his name, tell him all the things he didn't,
Sherlock shudders at that, and John nearly goes crazy with possessive pride. Lust is raging through his system, blinding him with its white heat, and he has to consciously rein himself in not to overwhelm his new lover with his enthusiasm. He wants to own him completely, more than he’s ever wanted to own anything else.
Then Sherlock is gone, and John whimpers and utters wordless protest at this loss, but a second later he hears Sherlock open the bottle of lube and slick himself up and stills again. Now. Now.
They have truffle risotto and red wine, and it's delicious. John wonders whether it's really that good or if it feels like that because his body knows that it's the last time it's going to taste it, but stops thinking about it after a while, because Sherlock seems to be enjoying it all so much and keeps eating enthusiastically until his plate is empty, which hasn't happened in a long while.
I have an idea. I know that if the worst case occurs, we won’t have the opportunity to talk to each other, maybe for months, and I want to give him something to hold on to – and if I'm honest, it's just as much for me as it is for him.
"Hmmm…" he hums around him and feels his own voice vibrate through his flesh, pleased with himself when Sherlock jerks violently and a drop of searing-hot fluid trickles against his tongue in response.
. I’m not used to it. But I'm enjoying his outbursts of tender praise, and the more unadorned parts as well.
He means it. Over time, ever since they started to grow closer again, his anger has been slowly evaporating, and he thinks he understands Sherlock a little better now. He was trying to protect him. He should never have attacked him the way he did when he came back.
I watch his muscles flex under his skin and marvel at it – he’s alive, so alive now, and all mine. I’m glad now that we haven’t had sex since he suffered his breakdown at the breakfast table – I’m already hard again, and still
Sherlock wakes up with a start and sits up in his bed, soaked in sweat and panting for air. His chest feels constricted, so much so that it hurts, and it takes him a while to identify the reason for it – he's crying, loudly, sobbing hoarsely, his cheeks wet with tears. And he can't stop.
But revealing all that would be too much, surely, would probably scare him away, and he can't jeopardise this now, not when John is here in his bed, begging to be taken.
He had intended not to wonder what this all means until later, but now he’s forced to follow that train of thought, and he doesn’t think he’ll like where it is going.
"No," he answers truthfully. "Not really. Just… remembering the old days. When we first got together. Missing them a bit."
Sherlock allows it and kisses back, but when John closes the distance between them and slips his hand underneath the waistband of Sherlock's pyjama bottoms to knead his buttock, he pulls away, panting and red-cheeked and, John thinks, looking absolutely delicious.
"I hate the way I look," Sherlock says, standing in front of the bathroom mirror. He sounds hollow, hopeless. "I
“Curious,” he repeats slowly and motions for me to take a seat on the settee, still not meeting my gaze.
“Yes,” he says slowly, his eyes boring into mine. I'm falling into them. Drowning. “I think that’s for the best, brother mine. I’ll call you.”
Deep inside, he knows that John is yearning for him the same way that he is yearning for John. He knows. He also knows that even if John decided to come back upstairs right now, things would still be just as messed up.
He’s letting go more beautifully than I could ever have imagined, so I decide to tell him about what’s going to happen as soon as he’s well again.
He sets his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, lightly grazing down his arm as a gesture of comfort. “I had the same reaction,” he explains with an encouraging smile. “It’s not as big of a deal as it sounds. We’re just meant to go and talk about what we do for a living.” He reaches into his pocket. “Here,” he says as he pulls out the folded paper from earlier.
His hand is shaking so badly now that it makes the table wobble a little, and John feels colour rush to his cheeks. He's ashamed of his own body betraying him like that. Rosie tightens her hold on him.
“Mycroft had me tested after--- well.” He gestures at his back. “I’m clean. And I--- I haven’t used needles in ages.”
“You think seeing you all wet and slippery will cool me down? Seeing the waves lap at those tight blue trunks when you walk into the water? Those are hugging you in all the right places, by the way…”
"She's not hiding anywhere, John. I've checked. Very thoroughly, I might add," Sherlock mumbles. "It's nothing of the sort."
Lie down. It begins to sound tempting. Maybe it will help to get rid of the incessant distractions my body keeps providing me with. Maybe afterwards, I'll be able to focus.
Sherlock studies the texture of the ceiling without registering what he's seeing. He could fall asleep now, he thinks lazily. Sleep has never come easily to him, not even as a child, and after his absence from London and everything that followed it, nightmares regularly disrupted the few hours of rest his body claimed for itself when his exhaustion became too severe. But right now he feels so calm, so detached from the disturbing thoughts usually keeping him up and alert when everyone else is resting, that he could doze off just like that.
His heart clenching in his chest, John allows his gaze to return to the huddled-up figure half-hidden under a thick woollen blanket. Sherlock seems tiny right now. It's John's watch this afternoon, and he knows the younger man has been awake for days. When John arrived and took over for Molly, Sherlock barely had the strength to greet him. He just lay there, completely exhausted, and then drifted off. He says he wants to go cold turkey, but John is not convinced.
"This building is where we first met. It's where you solved dozens of cases, helped hundreds of people. Let's keep these memories and get rid of the rest."
of him, even. I want to spend the rest of my life with him, want to wake up next to him in the mornings and nuzzle his curly head, want to hold him, taste his mouth, feel his fingers leave their imprints on my skin as we make love in his bed.
John doesn't know how long it lasts, and when they finally part, gasping for air and trembling all over, he's dizzy and weak in the knees and feels the tell-tale tug of a beginning erection throbbing between his legs.
John doesn't tell him that it's okay, or that it'll get better soon. That would be a lie. Sherlock sniffs, and it sounds angry.
He doesn't answer, just keeps looking at me with this dark, empty gaze. I try to fill the silence with more words, to make him stop looking like that, to make him believe me.
John purses his lips and looks up at him, raising one eyebrow, and then he shimmies out of his own, already open trousers by wiggling his hips. He attempts to do so more or less seductively, and he apparently succeeds, judging by the way Sherlock bites down on his lip and inhales a loud, shaky breath through his nose.
“I love you, John… I’ve loved you for such a long time,” he adds throatily and kisses the corner of my mouth, and then he goes in deep and rubs that perfect spot inside of me again, harder this time, and I sob out a desperate groan and raise my head to pull him close and kiss him properly.
John throws the napkin onto his seat before making his way to the exit, willing himself to erase this moment of weakness from his memory, but halfway down the docking gate he changes his mind and hurries back, dodging confused and slightly annoyed fellow passengers walking in the opposite direction.
Oh God. This is a rather rapid change from frenzied (albeit imaginary) fucking to, well, relationship talk. He’s being so open, and I know that it’s not easy for him to let his walls down and allow people access to his heart. I want to show him that he’s the only one for me as well.
“Please, Daddy,” she mumbles into his neck as he carries her upstairs, which makes him smile despite himself.
John is there, furious, charging at him. He throws him down onto the floor and is all over him in an instant, his hands around his throat, his knees digging into his sides. His face is contorted in an ugly expression of such hate and contempt that looking at it alone causes Sherlock physical pain, and it's almost worse than the actual blows and kicks that are now raining down on his face and chest. There's blood in his mouth. He feels lightheaded, but he can't move to defend himself. John is merciless in his assault, and Sherlock knows he'll die. His best friend, the man he loves so deeply, is going to kill him. Nothing has ever hurt this much before.
“I wish we lived in another time, John,” he murmurs, suddenly serious. “I wish I could look at you and not hide my true intent, even when we are out on the street - or in the bathhouse. I wish I could kiss you in the back of a hansom, and hold your hand while we walk in the park. I wish we did not have to live half a life.”
“Why are you crying, love? Can you tell me?” When Sherlock doesn’t answer right away, he adds: “I just want to know whether it’s good or bad crying. Please?”
He carefully steadies me as I try to sit, my limbs slow and uncooperative. When I get to my feet and rub the tense muscles of my neck to loosen them, swaying slightly because my injured leg protests the exertions of this day, he rises as well and takes hold of my arm.
At first he can't place it, his brain slow and sleep-heavy, experiencing difficulty to form a coherent thought.
the one who's guilty. You hurt me by leaving me. But I wronged you in the most terrible way. I--- I overstepped a line I should never have crossed. I hated you for a while, and when you returned to me, I wanted to make you pay. And then--- then Mary died, and we had already sort of lost touch somehow, and it was so easy to just cut you out of my life entirely. If Mrs Hudson hadn't forced me to talk to you… I don't know, Sherlock. If you had died because of me neglecting you--- If you really had overdosed, or--- I don't know---" He breaks off and tries to breathe through the panic settling in his chest. "When I attacked you after your relapse, and told you to--- to just die---
I can hardly wait, either. I give him a few more thrusts, and soon he starts to move with me, easing me into a rhythm he likes. His eagerness is so mind-numbingly erotic that I have to bite the insides of my cheeks to keep myself in check. I want to be inside him
the first time, and not doing it sooner was probably reckless and irresponsible, but John freely admits that it never occurred to him to ask his friend if there was any reason for concern – not while seeing him lying there, his hand moving under the covers, John's name a soft sigh on his lips, and definitely not once they’d started. John had long stopped thinking then. Bless Mycroft – he forced his brother to go through a complete check-up when he discovered that Sherlock had started to use again, and he came out clean for everything. He says he hasn’t taken anything for a while now, and John wants to believe him. The scars on the insides of his arms are fading, and soon they’ll be gone completely. John has resolved to try his best to help him keep it that way, because it would kill him to lose him, and because he knows that he, John, is the reason why Sherlock turned back to the drugs to help him cope in the first place.
He’s getting more and more furious, but I don’t know what else to say to make him see that I’m on his side – always have been, always will. I turn around and look out of the window.
Mary smirks, and I feel anger rise up inside of me. Why the hell is he covering for me? I went behind his back and had a date with this woman, and he decides to protect me from losing my face in front of her when she asks me whether I tried to go behind
He shudders and comes, moaning loudly, his whole body convulsing in his chair, his back arching and his mouth gasping for air, and Sherlock sucks and swallows and mirrors his moans with glorious, wanton groans of his own, and even while still floating in the middle of his orgasm the sounds alone make John want to do it all over again.
. Yes, I did. I knew the whole time," I say. “And I told him about you when he got back about a week ago.”
"You want my fingers, hmmm…?" John mutters and bites Sherlock's bottom lip, pulls at it with his teeth. "Want to feel me deep inside?"
John hums and lifts his head again to look up. The crackling fire throws flickering shadows across the room, making his hair look like a golden halo surrounding his face. Gently, he lets him slip from his mouth. There are streaks of moisture glistening on his cheeks.
Sherlock has gone very quiet, his heavy breathing the only thing breaking the silence around them. John can feel every breath he takes from the inside, and he's never wanted to tell somebody
He removes his hand from John's lips to stroke it along his jaw instead, and it's a gesture so tender, so out of place amidst all their combined moaning and panting and their sweaty, exhausted chasing after John's climax that it sends him right over the edge.
a farewell, after all, one of many, and he muses on how bizarre it is that all of this will still be here a week, a month, a year from now. The tables, the chairs, the bottles of expensive wine behind the bar, and Angelo, ancient, but seemingly indestructible, as well.
"Christ, you really are determined, aren't you?" he asks and shuffles upwards to get more comfortable. "Get over here, come on."
, stressed on the second syllable – a bit old-fashioned and very posh, just like the man himself. He laughed at Sherlock's dumbfounded, awestruck face, and at the proud way Rosie smiled when she noticed that she had obviously done something extraordinary. Sherlock, visibly shaking himself out of his stupor, told him to forget about the case then, and that it wasn't urgent, and asked him to go downstairs to tell Mrs H thanks, but they'd be fine.
“Ohhh… ” I moan when he’s all the way inside, and he bites my earlobe and begins a slow rhythm of in and out, pushing against my prostate with every thrust, the lubricant coating his fingers making slick, pornographic sounds that only heighten my excitement.
John doesn't stir for several minutes, and Sherlock knows he wants to give him time to calm down and loves him for it.
John opens his lids again, but doesn't turn around. It's private, this moment. He wants to protect Sherlock from taking the blame for his decision, but still he doesn't dare interrupt whatever is happening between the two people he loves most.
When his whole frame starts to shake uncontrollably, Sherlock digs his fingers into the muscles of his chest and just tries to not lose his mind - he wants to consciously experience this, wants to feel and see it happening to John, who's falling apart right there in his arms, and he never expected him to be like that if they ever did this together, but here he is, his John, coming all over his bed (
Sherlock squints at him, seemingly trying to focus, but giving up right away. John is glad that he’s taken the sticky note off his forehead. He’s close to a hysterical fit of laughter as it is. Spending this night with his friend has made him happier than anything has done in a long time, and he’s been feeling the relief over their healing relationship bubbling inside himself for hours now. It’s only a question of time until it comes to the surface. Who knows. He might hug Sherlock or do something equally out of bounds, and then what?
John is seething by now, and hearing Mycroft say "my brother" is the last straw. He feels himself losing control.
I stare at the phone in my hand, and keep doing so long after we ended the call. Despite his annoying habit of outsmarting and continuously interrupting me, I think I’m getting attached to Mycroft Holmes. Who would have thought.
His head is swimming. He lies there spread out in front of his friend, waiting, thrumming with want.
"Come closer," John whispers and lifts his leg to put it over Sherlock's hip, drawing him against himself in the process, making their cocks come together in a silky slide of skin on skin. "Closer…"
John wants to give Sherlock all of himself. He doesn't know what he'd do if something, and be it his own body, kept him from doing so.
“I mean it… You’re so passionate, so adventurous… so different from what I expected you to be. You turn my world around when we’re together like this, Sherlock. You take my breath away. You make me see stars. You---”
They lie together in the afterglow, not speaking a word, not moving at all, just breathing, taking in each other's presence, just
We do that for about a minute, our breathing slowing down in the process, our bodies relaxing into the sparkly warmth of satisfaction that follows amazing sex, and then I stop moving and gently pull out of him. He slumps forwards and against the mattress, boneless and limp.
He licks me clean, the texture of his tongue velvety and rough at the same time, and then grazes my tip with his teeth, lightly, carefully, and I never would have thought that teeth on my most vulnerable parts could excite me so much, but they do.
“Do not do yourself an injustice, Mrs Hudson,” Holmes says and sits down in his own chair again. “You are far from old - or deaf, for that matter. You did not hear me come home because I was never out in the first place.”
And as they finish their snacks, Rosie leans her head onto Sherlock’s chest, seeming to have reached a stage of delirious exhaustion. Sherlock smiles down at her before taking a napkin from his pocket and wiping a speck of green from her cheek. As she drifts off, Sherlock pushes a strand of blonde, curly hair behind her ears. She begins to snore lightly, and Sherlock looks down at her with so much love. John can’t find the words to express how he feels, so he says nothing as they bask in the autumn breeze.
“Come here,” he tells Sherlock, who reaches out to him and lets himself be pulled up from his sitting position and right into John’s arms.
They made their wills long ago. They put their papers in order and decluttered the cottage so as not to leave Rosie and her family with too much chaos to sort through afterwards. They gave away personal effects they don't need anymore and put the rest in boxes that Sherlock labelled with the names of their loved ones in his bold, slanting handwriting. They wrote letters and put them on top of the boxes. John put the password to the private section of the blog in Rosie's letter; Sherlock included a very detailed guide to bee-keeping in the one he wrote to his eldest granddaughter, in the hope she might take up the hobby he's always cherished so much.
"Whatever you need," Sherlock tells him, and feels the corner of John's mouth twitch in a small smile as he kisses him there as well.
Surprisingly, it doesn't take as much courage as he would have expected – it comes quite naturally to him, in fact. He closes the distance between their faces and kisses Sherlock, very tenderly and yet with enough determined pressure to show him what this is about, and that it's
"Sherlock," he says softly, glad when the other man raises his head and meets his gaze. "I--- It makes me so happy to hear you say that. Happier than I could ever explain to you. But the way you're handling it--- It's not right. We can't build a relationship on this.
doing it to John. There's a slow ache pulsing in his loins by now, and he can tell John is in a similar state, judging from his deep, heavy breathing and his dilated pupils.
When he enters John's room, Rosie is already awake, her eyes puffy from crying, her cheeks flushed. She's a pitiful sight, and Sherlock bends over her cot and puts his hand on her head to check her temperature. No fever. That's good.
," John suddenly growls, almost aggressively, and before Sherlock knows it, his legs are being pushed apart more widely and John puts his face right between his buttocks and kisses his opening as if it was his mouth.
He's lost the ability to form sentences, so out of his mind that he can't tell Sherlock what he needs, but Sherlock understands,
He nods slowly, sucking his bottom lip between his teeth. He seems to be thinking it over, in that lightning-fast way of his - I can see it happen behind his eyes.
John reaches down and gropes around until he can wrap his fingers around Sherlock's hardness, which, despite his reeling, stuttering mind, makes it known that it is interested, very much so, by twitching into his gentle grip right away.
Later, Sherlock takes a cab to the Yard and John goes and gets his overnight bag and checks out of his hotel, and then he goes to the shop and buys lube and milk, and smiles at the cashier when she grins at him.
The not-quite-conscious half-smile that gets him makes his heart melt. Suppressing a sigh of bittersweet affection, he turns and leaves the room.
So they talked, the day Sherlock decided to stop going to the hospital, and made a plan, and John is scared, but also so, so relieved. He doesn't want Sherlock to suffer any longer, and he himself is tired, too.
of it, but doesn't get it. He just wants to numb himself a little, to finally be able to function again, without pain, without
John's body wonders how to deal with this confusing mixture of arousal and emotion coursing through its system at that, but gives up immediately when Sherlock goes in for a second, deeper kiss.
"You've been so good," John coos, by his side again now, still out of breath himself. "You've been so good for me…"
“I know that for one thing, it’s none of your concern, and for another thing, he won’t ever have a reason to do so.”
The last remark hits me like a kick in the gut, because I know it’s true. Not even I could have gotten him to stop, and that knowledge hurts, even though the rational part of my mind knows why he had to do it.
"Thank you." John turns his head away again and takes a sip. "That's good," he then adds quietly. "Really--- thank you, Sherlock."
When he turns and goes to Sherlock's bedroom, he feels Wilkes' eyes on his back. He imagines sharing this bedroom with his flatmate, imagines being allowed to enter it at will, knowing its scent and the way the sunlight shines through the curtains in the morning, and he imagines dragging Sherlock here by the collar, stumbling against walls and furniture as he leads him towards the bed to lay him down and---
He shudders through it, his face pressed into Sherlock’s neck, and then, gradually, his movements slow down, and so does the whirling mess of colours and noises filling his brain. He’s tingling all over.
He’s left me alone, yes. I’ve missed him terribly, yes. He almost didn’t tell me, and the thought alone is killing me, yes. But what about him? He risked his health, his life out there, and he was alone, too. I wonder if he’s been traumatised by whatever it was that he had to endure, and I hope he’ll open up when he gets home so that I can assess the situation a little better.
to, John. It’s not your fault that everything’s so… difficult. And it’s not Rosie’s fault, either. I just--- I need a little more time."
In a tiny part of his mind, he's immeasurably sad that this might be the last time he's allowed to feel this, and yet it's really complete and utter
want to be with you. You raising a child is really not the worst case I can come up with. And I don’t
The mere idea makes him break out in cold sweat, and he fights down the panic starting to constrict his chest.
On their way out, Sherlock takes a last glance at the painting, now propped up against the wall, his brow furrowed.
"You were quite straight-forward the first time we were sitting here," Sherlock says as he puts a spoonful of tiramisu into his mouth. "Asking about my love life and all."
Sherlock’s fingers are warm on John's skin when he pushes his shirt open and down his arms until it falls to the floor with a rustling sound. John's trousers and boxers, still sitting low on his hips, follow suit, and he tries to step out of them as gracefully as possible while simultaneously getting rid of his socks, and then he's naked in front of Sherlock, who is still immaculately dressed in his expensive suit.
When their lips meet, it's sweeter than anything has ever been before. It's slow and languid, the way their tongues slide against each other, the way their breath mingles, and when John takes Sherlock's bottom lip between his teeth and pulls a little, Sherlock's knees buckle even while sitting down. John moans and deepens the kiss, licking into his mouth again and again, his hips pressing into their embrace, the fabric of his jeans chafing against the sensitive skin of Sherlock's bare cock.
for John. It's hard work to stop his lids from fluttering shut again, especially when John aligns himself with his entrance and begins to push in, but he manages, and John rewards him with a crooked, amazed grin that speaks of so many things all at once – desire, wonder, and the purest, deepest love imaginable – that it takes Sherlock's breath away.
His words are fluttering against damp, over-sensitive skin and Sherlock's heart beats faster. He still doesn't know what all of this is about, what John wants for the future, but the way they're talking now gives him hope that it might be more than just a one-night thing caused by grief and self-loathing. He is aware of the fact that their relationship is messed up, has been ever since he got back from Serbia, and that adding sex to the equation is unlikely to make things easier. But maybe, just maybe, this is not only about sex. And that is why he decides to be brave and open up, regardless of what it might cost.
“Alright,” he agrees, knowing that she won’t make it further than a few pages in this state of exhaustion. “Suit yourself.”
The candles he's lit and put up all over their bedroom bathe the two of them in their warm, golden light, making everything look soft and shapeless, and as John stares out of the window and at the dark evening sky, he sees the first snowflakes of the season beginning to fall, illuminated by the orange glow of the lonely street lamp burning outside their cottage.
His length feels like hot steel sheathed in silk, twitching into my touch as soon as I begin to stroke it, and I lean heavily onto my other arm and fight to coordinate my movements to make it good for him, make it perfect, better than anything has ever been before.
He’s already hard, and Sherlock is, too, and there’s nothing he wants more than to throw him onto his back, peel him out of his expensive suit, and make love to him right here on the floor. But he knows he can’t. Not there.
The slick wetness between their stomachs and chests is beginning to cool down, leaving their skin sticking together everywhere. It should be uncomfortable, but John finds that he doesn't mind at all. Their hearts are beating against each other through so many layers of flesh and bone, synchronised, slowing down as tension dissolves and satisfaction settles in.
He smiles around me and lets me slide from his mouth, and the air feels cool against my wet flesh when he lets go of my cock to let it rest against my abdomen again.
He can’t wait to see her blue eyes light up, her pink cheeks dimpling with excitement as he walks up to meet her after school. It’s her first year of primary, and she has already exhibited the signature Watson self-reliance—but each time he takes her tiny hand into his or hears that small but stubborn voice, he’s reminded that she’s still his little girl.
I try not to think about the fact that our moments together might be limited, at least for the foreseeable future. We need to seize the day, so to speak, and make it good. Something to remember.
They breathe together, hearts beating in unison, and John is just about to drift off when Sherlock begins to shiver in his arms.
I stare, even though I know I shouldn’t. This is so out of character for both of them, and it’s the most intimate moment I’ve ever seen them share. It’s equally beautiful and terrifying.
"That's the first time you've said that since… before," Sherlock replies lowly, his mellow tone belying his aloof exterior quite spectacularly.
," Sherlock says against his lips, rubbing their noses together, and John wraps him in a half-embrace and feels that he's in the same condition.
"Not there! Sorry," he calls and approaches the two men in the living-room again, coming to a halt behind the clients' chair.
John’s stomach clenches at the thought of the man he loves, lost in the haze of drugs, trying desperately to feel better, to feel less alone. He swears to himself that he’ll take care of him, help him heal. But he doesn’t want to think about that now. Now he needs to help Sherlock deal with what he knows is almost unbearable to his mind –
Sherlock swallows. He's known this moment would come, thought it would come much earlier, in fact, and yet he feels not remotely ready for the goodbyes they need to say in a few minutes' time.
“Moriarty is playing with your mind, too.” I glance behind myself to see him slamming his hand down on the desk in an uncharacteristic demonstration of nerves. “Can’t you
Everybody who knows Sherlock Holmes, however distantly, is aware of the fact that he doesn't do sentiment. He doesn't entertain irrational ideas, and he doesn't wish for things that are impossible to attain, because there's simply no point.
tight. Sherlock grunts against his temple and runs his nails down his spine in an erratic, fumbling fashion, casting about for something to hold onto as his body opens up to accept John’s presence inside itself.
She sends him a crooked grin that, bizarrely, reminds him so much of Mary that it gives him a twinge.
“I’m more than fine with that,” John says with a grin, allowing his hands to fold and fall into the space between the two of them.
"Don't you feel it here?" he mumbles against him and pulls his hand out of Sherlock's grasp to slip it between their bodies and caress the flat plane of Sherlock's stomach. His little finger catches in his navel, then lightly brushes the trail of curls starting just below it. "Deep inside?"
Sherlock purses his lips together and nods. “For Rosie,” he says, leaning forward to rest his head in the crevice between John’s shoulder and neck. “Besides, I’ll have you with me, and there is little I cannot do with you by my side.”
“Hey, love,” John replies. He leans in for a kiss, but the fluffy hood of Rosie’s coat is in the way, and their noses collide as they try to avoid it.
John smiles at him and bends down for a kiss, leaning onto his elbow, coaxing Sherlock’s mouth open with gentle nudges of his tongue, and immediately he senses the other man sink a little further into the bed beneath him.
The cuffs are the last obstacle, but when they’re open as well, Sherlock grips John’s wrists before he can push the shirt off his shoulders and down his arms.
“Oh, err, mmhhh. So, what do I--- what do I--- what do you want me to do at the end? Shall I, umm… smile and wink; I do that sometimes. I’ve no idea why. People seem to like it – humanises me.”
“After tonight, you’ll have seen all of me, it appears. Everything I usually keep hidden, body and soul. I did not anticipate to be so shaken by that. I’ll--- need some time to get used to it.”
John feels dizzy. His fury evaporates, being replaced by the most confusing mixture of heartache and bliss. He's blown away by the intensity, the suddenness of this revelation. Before he can answer (
"Here's your tea," he states, pointlessly, as he hands John his mug, and as John looks up at him from out of his armchair, his cheeks red from sitting so close to the fire, the place almost feels like home again.
John does, and soon Sherlock’s trousers, pants, shoes and socks have joined his own clothes on the floor, and then Sherlock pushes him towards the bed with gentle determination, and they sink down on the mattress together, their limbs entwining, fitting together perfectly.
He needs it to stop. The restlessness. The visions of his past, his sister, Victor, and the memories of Mary, and blood, and the morgue, and the pain. The emptiness inside his skull that makes the idle whirring of the unoccupied gears of his mind seem all the louder. The heartache.
"Yes," Sherlock replies, lowering his voice to a sultry drawl. "And who knows... I might find a way to get you to rejoin the proceedings after a brief refractory period... I haven't tasted you yet, after all..."
"I can't find my notebook… Can you check the inner pocket of my blue jacket, John? It's in the bedroom," Sherlock says, seated in his armchair and patting the pockets of his trousers and the Armani jacket as if looking for said notebook, which John knows doesn't even exist.
him, John. For a very, very fleeting moment I couldn’t help but marvel at his--- his brilliance. And he knew. He looked at me, and he
Sherlock bends down to kiss the tip of his cock, then opens his mouth and lets him slip inside, so slowly that it’s almost painful. His tongue moves against every single one of his most sensitive spots simultaneously, or so it seems to John.
He grumbles and makes remarkably short work of said tie and my shirt, which then both join his clothes on the floor to our feet.
She whimpers and digs her nails into his back, scratching him until it hurts. John revels in the pain that's grounding him to reality.
The word bumps against my lips on a warm puff of his breath, and I have to close my eyes for a second. When I look at him again, his expression is so, so sad. I’ve never seen him look so sad before.
, we’re going to crash,” a woman’s voice that John can’t localise says. “Can you text the kids, Steve?”
John shuts his eyes. Everything inside of him is dying, but Sherlock’s not the one he blames. He blames himself, and himself alone. Too slow. Too scared. Too
too straight-forward now. I’ll never learn. I’m sorry, John… I’m talking too much. I’m--- really scared of doing something wrong right now. I’ve thought about us being together like this… but reality is so different. I’m--- I have no idea how to proceed. I want it to be good for you.”
They lie still, tangled up in each other, filling their lungs with large gulps of air that aren't enough to quench their thirst for oxygen, eyes closed, hearts hammering in unison against each other through multiple layers of flesh and bone.
"Hrmpf," he suddenly grumbles and stirs, pulling me out of my ponderings. His tousled head comes up and he squints at the room in confusion, and then his heavy-lidded eyes find me.
"I can't lose him without saying goodbye. Not this time," he then says lowly. "I'd--- I'd die inside. I--- can't bear the thought of losing him. I'm…
Sherlock bites his lip, overwhelmed by the sudden rush of affection washing over him, and kisses the crown of John's head, making the touch of his mouth linger and inhaling the essence of his lover – sweat, soap,
After tea, Rosie chats about her schoolmates and the things she’s learning in class; Sherlock chats with Rosie about bees and organic chemistry and DNA technology; John listens to both of them with a smile on his face. John cooks dinner that evening: Asian stir fry with chicken and vegetables. John and Rosie end the evening reading a book together on the sofa, the way they often do, Sherlock watching over them from his table as he continues to tinker with his experiment. Everything feels perfectly normal at the forefront, but John knows Sherlock well enough to know that something is bothering him. He’s been deep in thought all evening, and it’s not the “thinking about how to solve a murder”-type deep. Rather, it’s the type of deep he’s in when something is troubling him.
It goes on forever, his own pleasure building slowly, and he’s glad he’s already come once today. He’ll last longer that way – as long as it will take to get Sherlock there as well. John has never been one to leave his partner hanging, but tonight it’s even more important to him. Sherlock is clinging onto him for dear life, his muscles tense, his breath loud and erratic. He
He ignores the mocking voice in his head and puts his arm around John, whose cheek is pressed against his chest now.
Without thinking, he raises his hand and tucks some tousled curls behind Sherlock's ear, using his thumb to trace the skin around the shell, so soft and velvety and hot, and Sherlock leans into the touch, maybe unconsciously, his lids fluttering, long lashes making shadows dance across his pale cheeks.
I crouch down and slide my mouth lower still, never ceasing to stroke him, and when I reach his perineum I rub my tongue against it and simultaneously press my middle finger against his hole.
acknowledge that they were wrong. I really do by now. Your violence shocked me, because I--- I trusted you, and I never thought you'd ever turn against me like that. And your words hurt even more than your physical attacks, because… I knew they were true---"
My voice breaks and I swallow down the tears rising up inside of me. I can’t break down now. Not in front of Mycroft.
We laugh, and the laugh turns into another kiss, and then I slide down on the floor with him and lean my forehead against his shoulder.
When the sound of her steps has died away, Holmes and I look at each other. His pale cheeks have turned even whiter than usual, the beautiful flush of ecstasy already gone and almost forgotten in the face of this narrow escape from being caught red-handed by our landlady - and, even worse, a potential client.
"Excuse me!" he tells the surprised flight attendant standing next to the door. "I've left something on my seat!"
For a moment, he looks straight into the camera, and our eyes meet. It gives me a pang. Then he addresses Lestrade.
He props himself up on one elbow and moves upwards until their faces are level again, grabbing his discarded jumper on the way and using it to wipe his fingers with it before dropping it to the floor.
Sherlock hums and buries his fingers in the hair at the back of John's head, pulling him even more deeply into the kiss.
“Thanks,” John grinds out through clenched teeth before managing to balance the dishes out again. “Very considerate of you.”
--- I want you," he then mumbles into the kiss, his hands sliding up into Sherlock's hair, his hips grinding into him. "
“Sherlock--- Thank you for apologising. I--- I’m not even sure you have to. But please believe me – I’d never leave you. I’d never want anything,
cold and still feels slightly dizzy. His back is covered in goose bumps, and briefly he asks himself if he's maybe going into shock. He felt like this after being shot in Afghanistan.
Hearing Sherlock Holmes say “cock” in his deep, sultry baritone is something that could kill even the sturdiest of men. My heart starts to pound.
“Bitte bleibt ruhig,” a man sitting somewhere behind them says in a would-be confident tone, and John’s limited German tells him that he must be the leader of the student group he saw entering the plane before he himself got on. Maybe he’s a teacher, and they’re a class of English learners on their way to London to have a great time in the capital.
John puts his arms around him, purely on impulse and glad not to be rejected when he does, and sighs into the crook of Sherlock's neck.
He hoists Sherlock's thigh up and re-enters him, finding him soft, wet, and pliant to his touch, and Sherlock throws back his head, his eyes snapping shut in abandon again.
He chides himself for indulging in this neither new nor (usually) unwelcome fantasy while his secret object of desire (or is it the object of his secret desires?) is lying right next to him, so close that he can probably use his superhuman deduction skills to read his thoughts.
After a while, Sherlock stops moving, and John with him. They lie there, legs entwined, arms slung around each other, catching their breath.
"God, I want that, too. I can't tell you how much. But it'll have to wait until tonight, I'm afraid… Rosie will wake up soon. And I'm not going to rush this… I want to savour it. I want to--- to give you all of me tonight."
I feel an impossible wave of relief wash over me at hearing his words, but the implications of what he is saying are not easy to comprehend.
"You're exquisite, love," he then whispers and begins to move back and forth with small, shallow thrusts, each and every one of them nudging into Sherlock's prostate, and Sherlock's legs begin to shake uncontrollably.
, Sherlock thinks, from the arches of his feet to the wayward silver strands falling into his eyes as he gently threads his fingers through his hair and stares at him from under heavy lids.
“Mmhhh…Getting numb?” John asks and opens his eyes, having a hard time to focus, because he can somehow feel Sherlock speak from where he is embedded in his body, and it’s a glorious sensation.
Throwing caution to the wind, Sherlock allows himself to live in the moment. They are so good together. This is worth it. He smiles at the ceiling, feeling his skin burn everywhere they touch.
Wow. So he’s discovered that he loves his little brother after all. And I feel like I’ve been caught red-handed, even though nothing happened. (Did you
"No," a silky voice says, and before John has time to be surprised, a hand grabs his upper arm and pulls him back.
"Do you know what day it is?" Mycroft wants to know, sounding so absolutely serious that John wants to punch him.
Sherlock lost his hair, his gorgeous salt-and-pepper curls, first. Then he lost his appetite, and the little weight retirement had put on him as well. He lost his strength. In the end, when it became clear that nothing they did made only the slightest difference, he lost his will to keep fighting. And that was that.
John takes a deep breath and tries to calm himself. Maybe there's still time to fix this, to make up for it and make Sherlock see that hurting him is the last thing he'd ever want to do.
your father, John!" Sherlock says urgently and reaches up to put his hands on John's legs. "I know you won't do it again. I know it. I
“Mm,” Sherlock sighs, but makes no move to disentangle himself from John’s embrace. Instead, he slips his hands beneath John’s jumper and pulls at the shirt he’s wearing underneath, trying to get at more bare skin to stroke and knead and scrape against with his blunt nails.
Sholto and Sherlock. They're so different, and yet… Looking at them together, being in the same room with both of them, confused John more than he's ready to admit. He remembers feelings he shouldn't have had in the past when he looks into Sholto's steely eyes, but they're veiled and softened by time and his reluctance to accept them. When he meets Sherlock's kaleidoscope gaze, he
Sherlock lets go of Rosie and puts his hand on John's cheek instead. John shivers when Sherlock uses his thumb to trace the edge of his jaw. He puts some pressure on the back of John's neck and pulls him towards himself.
, okay? I understand why you're unhappy, and you're entitled to mourn the things this disease took from you, but I want you to know that it doesn't matter to me. I know I can't really show you the way I used to when I was younger, but I hope you're aware of the fact that I still fancy you. I'll never stop."
She sounds proud instead of repulsed, which irritates me beyond belief. This is all unfolding so completely differently from how I expected it to go that I find it difficult to wrap my head around it all. Holmes nods. He seems to be not as taken aback by her reaction as I am, but I can sense his confusion nevertheless.
John laughs quietly, rustling the dark hair on Sherlock’s head before kissing it once more. “Rosie will be so happy. I can’t wait to tell her.”
He nods and sinks onto the bed with his upper body, his head turned to the side, a long sigh stuttering out of his throat. I take in his profile. His mouth is open, showing a hint of teeth, and his eyes are half-closed, staring into the middle distance with a glazed, slightly intoxicated look. He looks completely relaxed.
"John," Sherlock says in a serious tone that clashes severely with his flushed cheeks and erratic breathing. "I've read about--- this. I'll do my best to put my theoretical knowledge to use, and if--- if it should prove unsatisfactory, I'll delete the information and look for more useful sources."
His legs sling themselves around my lower back, and my next thrust misses its aim and causes me to slip-slide further down between his thighs, past his scrotum, nudging the soft, damp place between his buttocks. He's so hot down there. I feel the urge to just
Out of the corners of his eyes, he sees Sherlock twist the bedsheet in his hands, his knuckles white, and it makes him proud to be the one to make this otherwise calm and collected person lose control like this.
He breaks off again and chuckles helplessly. Despite everything, Sherlock's heart goes out to him at that. He looks so lost. If he had the right words, if he was any good at this at all, he might even help him to get it over with, to dump him and move on.
His bare feet make no sound as he walks down the hallway and into the living-room. No Sherlock. He turns and passes the bathroom (empty as well) and tries Sherlock's bedroom instead, coming to a halt in front of the closed door. He must be in there. Has he gone to sleep?
The freakish way the noises and the voices and the shaking and the roaring of the rain suddenly just
I gently bite his left buttock, catching a bit of taut flesh between my front teeth. He groans. Then his hand is there, two long, elegant fingers coated in thick, milky salve, and I pull his cheeks apart to reveal his entrance, rosy and soft and so inviting that I can hardly contain myself. Still - I need to make sure this is something he wants.
, pulsing out of him and into the space between them, his gift to John, who's responsible for all the pleasure taking his breath away.
“I’ll think of you every day, but especially at five o’clock. I’ll have a cup of tea and think of you, okay? No matter where you are, you know I’m here in London, thinking of you at tea time. Okay?”
I incline my head, trying to hide my relief. I would not dream of forcing him into anything he does not wish to do. But to stop now, after having this first taste, would have torn me apart inside.
. The sensations are coming in waves now, and John slips under and enjoys it, no longer able to think straight.
John wonders if what they’re doing is making up for two years’ worth of lost time, or atonement on Sherlock’s part, or him getting cold feet because deep down inside he is very aware of the fact that his haphazard proposal only six months into his and Mary’s relationship was born out of despair and grief, and who knows what would have happened if Sherlock had come back
It's barely a sigh, but he knows John has heard him when the other man looks up and into his eyes with an expression of such tenderness that it takes his breath away.
“God, you're the most amazing sight,” I tell him, taking in his pupils, widened with want, his burning cheeks, his tousled hair. “Sit up against the headboard.”
“My love… You’re wonderful…” I tell him and twist my hand while scissoring my fingers, just to see what it will do to him.
John hums lowly and presses his own cock against his friend’s hip to grind against him, and Sherlock grips his right buttock and groans, baring his neck as he throws back his head in abandon.
He hears his own name, spoken so softly by the voice he loves so much, and suddenly John realises why Sherlock didn’t tell him. Why he
, and this knowledge gives him thrills of excitement he's never experienced before. Even as he reins in his lust, he revels in how powerful John's longing for him makes him feel.
“Lean back if you want… Get comfortable…” John says and spreads Sherlock’s legs a little more, careful to give him the opportunity to rest his heels against the bed to ground himself.
She's grasping at straws by now, and somehow he senses that she knows it, too. He raises his hands in a placating gesture, hoping against hope that she'll sit back down, that she'll allow him to touch her, to hold her. He wants to hold her so badly.
His heart beating in his throat, he circles his entrance with the pad of his middle finger, massaging the muscle to make it loosen up and pressing down harder and harder ever so slowly, and after a minute of teasing he feels the tight ring give way to allow his fingertip to slip inside.
He’s actually quite excited for the opportunity to show off their little family, to watch Sherlock speak about the brilliant things he does, and to meet the parents of the students Rosie speaks so fondly about. Sherlock probably won’t be so keen on interacting with the other people, but that’s fine. They’ll make it work; they always do.
"Lube," he mutters into their kiss and gestures towards the bedside table, and Sherlock, the marvel, opens the drawer and gets the required item without even glancing at what he's doing.
John doesn’t dare to hope, not yet, but if Sherlock can’t talk, there’s only one way to find out what this all means. He’s gone and crossed the line today, so he’s got nothing to lose.
After Evans had been arrested, Holmes “borrowed” one of the Yard’s hansoms to rush me to the hospital, even though I could very well have taken care of the wound myself. I told him as much, but he would not hear of it, and, tired and in pain as I was, I soon stopped protesting. If I am being entirely honest, I rather enjoyed being fussed over by him in such a way - it happens so seldom, after all.
But that was then. Now I'm lonely, yes, and I crave a bit of the famous "human touch", but I'd never do something about it. I promised him I'd wait for him, and wait I will. As long as it takes.
“Hello, Dr Watson.” It’s Mycroft’s silky voice. “I have a message from the prodigal son. He wants you to know that he always remembers tea time. Whatever that might mean. I trust you can decipher that code.”
"Sherlock… I've been reading your signals for a while now," he says, his hand resting on my chest now, caressing me through the thin, worn-out fabric of my t-shirt. "I just--- I needed time to work it out. And today--- God, I just couldn't help myself. You're gorgeous when you're flustered. I wanted to talk to you, finally get it out in the open. And then I saw you lying here, completely out of it, pleasuring yourself… saying my name… I couldn't turn around and leave, Sherlock. Maybe I should have, but I just couldn't. I'm sorry."
"This didn't seem to be a very safe place to be standing," he says. "Not with your current level of blood alcohol."
He lets his gaze roam over the angles of John’s back, for a moment allowing himself to bask in the warmth of recognising the way he moves, so familiar, then looks up again to study his profile, noticing the stubble on his haggard face and the grey streaks in his hair that weren’t there the last time they saw each other, which feels like a lifetime ago somehow.
I smile to myself. I'm proud to call myself the only person in the world who really knows most of the many faces of John Watson, but the two he shows me today are new to me. The wild, sometimes even almost-too-rough lover, taking what he wants and giving everything he has, and now a softer, gentler version of that man, one who enjoys being held and caressed.
Holmes gapes at her for a moment, then collects himself, his trademark mask of cool composure sliding back into place.
You have to hand it to Mycroft – he won’t bring you down and then stomp on you. He knows he’s won this argument, but he doesn’t gloat.
His shoulders slumping, relaxing into the sensation, he closes his eyes. The gloves he's still holding slip out of his grasp and drop to the floor. He doesn't care.
Now they're face to face again, kissing like there's no tomorrow, and John doesn't know whether he'd like to just stay like this forever or rather move on to something more intense – Sherlock's mouth is like a drug and he can't seem to stop, no matter how much the rest of his body is shouting at him to hurry up and get on with it. He's breathing Sherlock's air, drinking in his low groans, and there's nothing else he needs.
He’s smiling, but it’s nothing like the smiles he gave me when we were in bed together. Why did he always feel he had to hide himself behind his mask of indifference, even when it was only the two of us? Was he so scared that I’d reject him? Hurt him? Was he careful because he thought he wasn’t safe with me? He says he’s been in love with me for a long time – when did it all start?
"Is it--- monosyllabic sentences already?" John jokes breathlessly and reaches out to grab the small bottle of almond oil from where it's sitting on the edge of the bath before turning them both around again so that Sherlock can return to his place in front of the mirror. "You… might want to hold on to something again, love," he then says and slowly breaks the kiss, and it sounds so sultry that Sherlock's cock gives a small twitch.
The dressing gown makes a whispering sound as it slithers to the floor, and then John is in bed with him, smooth and firm, his hands already wandering even before their lips meet in a kiss that's far from chaste or careful.
I grin, and my eyes fall on Sherlock, who’s still lying there in this strange, uncomfortable position, but who’s not rifling through papers anymore. He’s looking at me with so much longing on his face that I forget how to breathe for a second.
be at home right now, in front of the fire, steaming cups of tea in their hands. He could have taken a hot shower after dinner and then put on his soft flannel pyjamas and a dressing gown. It would have been just another cozy, uneventful evening at Baker Street. Or they could have gotten two rooms at the pub and waited until tomorrow to go and investigate here. They could have sat together and had a pint in well-practised, peaceful silence, and everything would have been nice and normal and---
He somehow looks taken aback by his own words and by what he's just revealed about himself, and all John wants is to turn back time and never act on that ridiculous idea of his. He'd do anything to undo it all and start over again.
“Go on.” Sherlock says, lightly shooing her away. “It’s a surprise.” As she trots off, the corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitches in what might be amusement, but John sees something else in his eyes—something that wasn’t there when they entered the flat.
Sherlock takes a few breaths to calm himself enough to answer. The surreal quality of seeing John like this, with his hand around the base of his cock and his lips shining with saliva, makes his head swim.
"Get comfortable, love," I murmur and glide my hands down his flanks. His skin is smooth and warm. "I want you to leave it all to me now…"
, God," John moans and licks a wet stripe up Sherlock's neck until he reaches his ear. "You're--- gorgeous…
It takes an incredible effort to raise my head and glance down at my thigh - I cannot feel my legs at all at this moment. He is right. The once white dressing covering my wound is stained red, which means I will have to change it, which, in turn, means I will have to disentangle myself from his embrace and get up.
“Mmhhh, that was nice, yes… John… Close your eyes now… I’ll take care of you… I’m kissing down your ribs, your abdomen… Your skin is so
When he enters the flat, Sherlock is already there. He tries to hide something behind his back when John steps over the threshold, but it's crackling in his hands, and after a second in which John can see him go through the pros and cons of letting him in on whatever it is that he's doing, he rolls his eyes and sighs.
“I’ve already told you. I needed to see her. My imagination had been, for lack of a better phrase, running wild. It’s okay now. If you need to hear it again - I forgive you. Nothing happened. You had a weak moment, and that’s okay.”
Sherlock runs the tip of his middle finger against John's perineum, back and forth, a feather-light touch that he knows he himself likes a lot, and goose-bumps spread all over John's arms. It's a mesmerising sight, and Sherlock takes him in and does it again.
Sherlock is interested in that, too. When John returned from his walk with Rosie a few moments ago and saw that they weren’t alone, he noticed him deliberately avoiding any behaviour that could possibly give them away, probably because he wasn’t sure how Sherlock would want to handle it. John didn’t look at him too intently, and he didn’t invade his personal space. They were quiet last night, so that can’t be it either. How can she know?
Then his lips are upon mine and his hands are in my hair, and I feel my back hit the door, none too gently, but it does not hurt at all.
There she is, the woman he's going to spend his life with. Sitting on their bed, cross-legged, grinning up at him. She's beautiful, he thinks. She's all he needs.
I take off my shoes and jacket and make my way over to him, but he doesn’t turn his head when I take the clients’ chair and sit down next to him. He’s wearing his favourite pair of striped pyjamas and a burgundy robe, and if this had been a normal day, I would probably bend down and kiss his head, or maybe, if I felt playful, one of his bare feet, and then I would check his back or make tea or dinner and everything would be fine.
"It's okay with me, Sherlock. I--- It's always complicated, isn't it? I'm not easy to live with either when I'm in one of my moods, right? But that's just something you put up with when you commit to someone. If I want something, I can tell you. If you don't understand something, you can ask me. That's how it's supposed to work."
Whenever it's John's turn to watch him, Sherlock tries to get a few hits into himself beforehand, just to take off the edge. If he doesn't, the memories are too much, still too fresh, and he can't handle them yet.
He sounds confident, and I cling to his words and try to believe them. Mycroft will do what he does, and everything will be alright. Soon.
Sherlock shrugs, trying to get rid of the feeling of unease and embarrassment coiling in his muscles. "Nothing. Sentiment. Never mind."
"I didn't know where I was when I woke up," he mutters. "I slept in so many beds in the last two years, and on so many floors… But then I saw you, and it was alright."
Every pair of eyes settles onto Sherlock, and the room begins to buzz with an excited energy. But once Rosie lets go of his hand and darts off towards her friends, Sherlock wilts. John can tell how nervous he is, that he’s now questioning his decision. He touches Sherlock’s shoulder lightly in solidarity.
Sherlock kisses back and swallows John's moans as they mingle with his own and rests his heels against the small of his back, meeting his thrusts and giving back as much as his limited range of movement allows him to. His arms come up and he wraps them around John's shoulders, one of his hands cradling the back of his neck, the other one digging into his shoulder blade for support. They're so close, so perfect together.
Wilkes to still be there, to see them do this, he laughs into the kiss, then nips at Sherlock's bottom lip, sucks it into his mouth and luxuriates in its taste, its plumpness, before letting it go again and gently pulling away to look at the man in front of him.
Afterwards, they lie together in the stillness of John's room, entangled in each other, and John runs his fingers through his hair and hums low, lazy sounds against the top of his head.
to want before I realised that I’m not the only one who’s had to struggle in the past months. He’s saying sorry. Does he even have to? I thought this would be easier, now that he’s here again, but at the moment I feel like I don’t know anything anymore. I just want to lie down with him and kiss his face and hold his hand and sleep until I can think clearly again. I want us to have time to find the words we need to communicate. We lost them during all the hard times that lie behind us.
He returns his friend’s gaze and slowly opens his legs to make room, and the right corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitches upwards in a small, barely noticeable smirk. He shuffles closer and puts his hands on John’s thighs, his fingers digging into the muscles with gentle force.
"Gorgeous," he murmurs and bites down on the taut flesh on display, and then he uses his free hand to spread John open for his eyes and mouth to roam. "If you need me to stop, say so and I will," he says lowly. "It's okay."
the one who made mistakes. Please. You won't heal before you do. It'll always be there, in your subconscious, and one day it'll come to the surface, and then the ground will fall from under your feet. I know it. I--- I saw you flinch when I was around, Sherlock, in the time before your relapse. I saw how scared you were. You're traumatised, and it's my fault."
"Are you comfortable, love?" John asks and cups Sherlock's face in his palm, tracing his cheekbone with his thumb. Slowly. Tenderly. "Are you warm?"
Sherlock's fingers tighten their grip on him, strong and warm and oddly comforting despite the surreality of the situation.
I've never heard his voice sound like this before. It's a little rough, and very low, and it's reaching places inside of me that I didn't even know existed.
I take your hand again, rub my palm against yours, memorise your fingerprints pressing against my skin. How am I supposed to sleep tonight, without you by my side? How am I supposed to get up again tomorrow?
He takes a step back again, and now it’s me who’s on the receiving end of a deadly glare. I shake my head.
before and after him, other bullies who made fun of Sherlock, called him names, revelled in the knowledge that he didn't,
"They tortured you," I state lowly, because it feels as if the way he's describing it doesn't do the severity of his injuries justice.
"No, no… keep those beautiful eyes open for me…" John says lowly and runs his hands up and down Sherlock's back, slowly, soothingly. "I want to watch you… watch you
His breath catches in the back of his throat when I squeeze him gently and rub my middle and index finger against his perineum to tease him through the thin material of his pyjamas.
John wishes he could travel back in time to that very first day and do everything differently. He regrets so many things. The sensation of warmth and peace and
, for God's sake. And this is Sherlock Holmes, the one and only, the amazing human deduction machine.
They are silent for a while. Sherlock drinks his tea, and John loses himself in the sight of his lips touching the mug, maybe in exactly the same spot where John's mouth touched it, too. Sherlock takes a sip, swallows, then repeats the process. John watches him, watches his Adam's apple bob, watches his long fingers flex as he raises the mug to his lips again and again. It's hypnotic; he's transfixed by it and only jerks out of his reverie when Sherlock puts the mug back down on the table with a low
Sherlock looks at the ceiling for a moment, then back at the mirror, avoiding John's gaze when he does so.
He wants to call out to John when it takes him, but all that makes it out of his mouth is a garbled moan that might have been intended to be the first letters of his name. He can't tell himself, what with the blood roaring in his ears and his heart pounding so hard that he's afraid for his health for a second. He can't breathe. It's too much pleasure, too strong,
His heart bursting with emotions he doesn't have names for because they are just too momentous to describe, he closes his eyes as well. He feels like crying, like
On the other side of the road, a CCTV camera slowly turns its cold eye away. I suppress the sudden urge to give it the finger.
"I'd like to preserve this. I've already built a new room in my mind palace to store everything connected to---" He gestures back and forth between the two of them. "But sometimes it's nice to have the physical memory as well. I was just going to put it away when you came in."
John stares at him and wishes he was younger – he knows he won't be able to join him in this early-morning adventure. Despite the tingling in his loins, he's still soft, and he's sure he'll stay that way, at least for today. Two times in a row would have been a miracle – but that doesn't mean that he won't enjoy giving Sherlock pleasure and release.
John's knuckles still hurt from repeatedly colliding with Sherlock's face last night, but the satisfaction it offered him is almost completely gone by now. Now a strange kind of emptiness has started to fill his insides; it's been wafting through his mind like grey fog, accumulating around his heart like it wanted to suffocate it, and no matter what he does, the feeling just doesn't go away.
A shudder runs through me, and my awkward embarrassment suddenly turns into helpless desire. My body tenses, not knowing how to process the onslaught of emotions, not knowing what to do to quench the thirst for contact, for touch, for
It takes Sherlock a bit longer to accommodate to two fingers – "Sorry… out of practice…" – and John does his best to make it worth his while. His hand seems to have a mind of its own, remembering exactly where to touch, where a crooked finger or some rhythmic teasing will feel exceptionally good and make Sherlock jerk and tremble in his half-embrace, and he's thankful that his tremors are usually focused on his left side. His right hand seems to still possess the skills he needs to methodically take his lover apart, and he's determined to make good use of that.
