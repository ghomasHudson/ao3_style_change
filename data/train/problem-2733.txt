As the rain touched him, Castiel could tell that unlike so many of Gabriel’s parlor tricks, this moisture was real instead of an illusion.
It involved a truly terrible family gathering at the Campbell house, where Dean had brought Castiel home to meet his grandparents for reasons that would only make sense in dreams. Everyone got roaring drunk on cheap wine, until they discovered that Deanna was possessed by a demon and Sam put his hand on her, just like he used to, and tried to draw the demon out over and over again, but it wouldn’t work.
Dean pulled the needle off the record and jerked the door open, yelling to Sam’s retreating back, “That better, princess?”
After patiently answering questions for about twenty five minutes, Dean finally hammered out a plan with Missouri, who was elated at her special escort for the following morning. He explained the scant clues they had so far about whatever was occupying the bunker, and she rushed him off the call to do some research of her own and pack up her implements for the next day.
He could, of course, ask Gabriel to help and the room would immediately be truly lush and overflowing with life. As an archangel, Gabriel’s grace was like the cosmic forces of a galaxy, and comparatively Castiel’s was like the reactor of a single sun. He was beyond even Castiel’s understanding.
“I’ll help them when the time is right,” Gabriel replied tensely, responding to Castiel’s aggressive energy like a dog raising his hackles.
“Do you have any theories on what broke the bottle of liquor?” Castiel pressed. “I have not felt any foreign presence here.”

Together, Dean and Sam glanced over at Castiel, who looked rumpled in his trenchcoat and even a little bit dirty, oddly enough.
Much of the illusions or temporary creations that Gabriel peddled were just frames of reality, like a lattice of ice that would evaporate into the air the moment Gabriel took his mind off it. Creating something independent and real was far more difficult.

“I have been thinking,” Castiel started, his voice a little hoarse at first as if from disuse, “perhaps we should seek out a medium.”
After making sure the Impala was in tip-top shape and ready for winter, he’d taken apart the Model T just to see how the engine worked. Unfortunately, he’d found it more difficult to put back together, and he was slowly watching YouTube videos on his phone to reassemble it.
This had finally culminated in Mary slapping both of them upside the head and threatening to make Jack dump them both on the floor if they didn’t cut it out. Sam watched them with an amused and mildly rueful smile - this was just the last in a long line of increasingly infantile attempts to one-up each other in the powers department.
Time slipped by as they stood there together, almost shyly, as if it didn’t want to disturb them. Eventually, though, Dean released Cas, and pushed himself away from him, just a little, and smiled. Not widely, or even really happily, but it was mirrored back at him, like an agreement. Like a promise. Behind them, car doors echoed as they slammed shut, good-natured bickering fading in and out as everyone argued over seats. Dean turned around to walk back to his family.
Sam knew he was staring at her, but she was staring right back, so he couldn't bring himself to mind all that much. This was his
This kid really needed to stop casually breaking Dean's heart like that. It wasn't like he had much of it left as it was.
He refused to look back at Lisa, because he knew that she would be wearing that expression that made him feel flayed open and exposed, like she could see straight through to his soul.
The bottle slipped from Dean’s hand, disintegrating before it could hit the ground, and he lifted both hands to scrub down his face, spun on his heel as if to storm off only to turn back after five paces, grabbed at his hair like he needed something to ground himself on.
"Yeah, kid," he said when the pause began to drag on a little too long. "Tomorrow afternoon okay? I can show you the basics when I gived the Impala a tune up."
He opened his eyes.  The house in front of him didn’t look like anything special – it could have been any house on any street in America, except for the fact that he knew that it belonged to her. He’d been here once on Earth, one nail-biting weekend when Jess had taken him to her home to introduce him to her parents. He’d spent the whole time torn between longing and fear, wanting to be accepted by them by terrified that they would see past his paper-thin façade of normalcy to the freak underneath.
“I thought,” Cas said quietly, “that you would want to know.” He met Dean’s infuriated gaze, carefully keeping his own face blank, until Dean scoffed at him and stepped back, the strength of his rage fading.
"Wait!" Said Samandriel. He coughed awkwardly. "May I come and visit you all?" He looked each human hopefully in the face. "You are very interesting."
“Good!” She stepped forward and gave his ear a gentle flick. He clutched it, pantomiming grave injury until she was through the doorway and out of sight. He dropped his hand and sighed deeply, bowing his head, letting his shoulders sink under the weight of the world on them. Feigning normalcy was so friggin’ exhausting. But fake-it-till-you-make-it had been Dean’s policy for years and it had gotten him this far.
"Rachel, Hannah, my apologies." He started gravely. "But I must go and see Sam Winchester. He may have news that could aid us."
Four hours later and Sam’s voice was hoarse from talking, the table was littered with tissues and cups of coffee, and Jess had her head in her hands, staring down at the half-full bottle of scotch that had been full when they started talking.
At that moment, the Roadhouse door flew open and Sam Winchester came barreling out, face split open with a milllion-watt smile.
"Seriously," He said, looking Jesse in the eyes. "I've been worrying about you ever since you took off."
Jesse sat on the edge of his seat, tense as a wire, eyes flickering constantly between his plate, Dean and the door, so regularly that Dean bet he could have set a clock by it. He ate methodically - not rushing, trying to to seem rude, but quickly all the same, without wasting so much as a few crumbs. It pained Dean to see it in a kid as young as he was, but he knew better than to comment.
"Oh, he's here. Don't ask me where specifically, because I don't know. Wherever he is, it's gonna be far away from me."
Words rose up and caught it Sam’s throat as her stared at her, her wild blonde hair, her brilliant smile, her too-big t-shirt. She was here, perfect and happy to see him, against all odds. She faltered, her smile fading the longer that he stood still, staring at her with tears in his eyes.
"He'll be real glad," Victor told them seriously. "He was worried about you when he got in. Said Lucifer did you a serious injury."
Dean groaned as he climbed the stairs, making his way back to the guest room to get dressed, smiling to himself when he spotted Ben peeking through the crack in his door to see if he was ready yet. It was cute, how excited the kid seemed.
"Well, you'd better keep on truckin', then," Ellen said faintly. "I don't particularly feel like havin' a do-over."
Inexplicably, the idea of Jesse taking off again made a solid cold lump settle just under Dean's ribcage. Maybe he was latching onto a new cause or whatever, falling prey to his hero complex, but he really, really wanted to see the kid sleeping properly, eating something decent, smiling without it seeming forced. Wanted to do something nice for someone for a change.
So he'd gone through the trunk and the glovebox and his jackets, pulling out the bottles and flasks that he'd stashed there over the previous months and handed them over without protest. Lisa had taken them away, and brought the flasks back empty and squeezed his shoulder with a sad smile that he didn't deserve.
"Well, yeah," Ellen agreed. "Have you seen the decisions these morons make when you leave them to their own devices?"
Ben moved around the house like he belonged, like he couldn't imagine there being any danger there. He ate like he had all the time in the world, like he'd never been truly hungry, because he hadn't.
“I’ll be back down later.” Dean lied. He knew he was going to spend the rest of the night in his room like an antisocial teenager. He was such a little bitch.
"It ain't a proper road trip if you're not cursing the map you fucked up reading." He said as he reached onto the dashboard to grab a piece of beef jerky.
“Hey, don’t put me in the same category as those two. I’m a Winchester now.” Cas said proudly. Jo laughed hysterically.
“Well, we’ll have to be quick. No foreplay, just plain ol’ fucking.” Cas said bluntly. Most people would have blushed at Cas’ words but Dean was far too used to it. He’d heard much worse from Cas in the past.
“Castiel Winchester?” Dean offered. Cas kissed him again and even in the dark Dean could the huge smile on his face. "You're stuck with me for the rest of our lives, Castiel Winchester." His fingers traced over the inking across Cas’ body. “So, overpriced wedding rings or another tattoo?” He asked.
“Nothing is-” Dean started to say but he stopped when he saw Cas hurrying towards the trailer. Instead of his smart suits or shirts and slacks, Cas wore a pair of ratty-looking jeans and an old-looking Yale hoodie and baseball cap. A bag was slung over his shoulder as he hurried towards the trailer, stopping when he looked up and saw Sam. Sam followed Dean’s gaze and swore him he saw Cas stood there.
“Sam!” Mary snapped, finally reaching her limit. “For God’s sake, go and talk to the girl. Say you’re sorry, tell her the truth, and for crying out loud, stop making her decisions for her!”
Cas sighed and lowered himself into the seat, Sam perching next to him and Victor propping himself against the bar behind Ellen.
, and Dean decided that that was close enough to normal getting up time and stood. He’d changed into sleeping clothes, at least, a token attempt at normalcy while he invaded Lisa and Ben’s lives. The first of many, probably.
"Yeah, Dean gave Jo a bit of trouble when she first started out." Sam took a sip of beer, reminiscing fondly. "I think it was his big-brother complex coming out more than anything else, but she still set him straight."
By the time he had reached the end of the story, Jess had been almost catatonic, so drained by everything he’d already told her that she had nothing left to give. Really, her reaction had been a lot better than he’d been hoping for, he mused, as he washed out the coffee mugs.
“Um, I’m half demon?” Jesse said hesitantly. “I was meant to help the devil win the apocalypse, but Dean and Sam helped me get out of it.” He glanced around the table and started attacking his eggs with single-minded ferocity.
"I confess, this was the outcome I most hoped for," Cas admitted. "The idea that your fate would be a terrible one pained me to contemplate. But there were so many variables to consider, I didn't want to give you and your brother false hope."
"It also means that Raphaels options are extremely limited," Cas mused. "Either he accepts that things have changed for good, or..." He paused, suddenly noticing that everyone human had focused on him with hawk-like intensity, and Samandriel had apparently joined in out of solidarity.
Holy shit. How the hell was Sam supposed to respond to something like that? He’d been braced for an eternity trapped in the worst part of hell, had welcomed it, even, knowing that it was the only way to save the world. But now – what? He’d somehow managed to weasel out of it? He got to go to Heaven? It sounded way to good to be true.
“So he isn’t alright,” Dean snarled, low and furious. “Not even fucking close, Cas. He’s still gone.”
Several bets had been placed on him being murdered yet again for playing one too many pranks on the more violent of the bunkers inhabitants. (His excuse was that to much work and no play would be detrimental to their health - Mary suggested that at least it was better than trickster-induced heart attacks, but, sadly, she had been ignored).
Dean’s subconscious was no different, though Cas knew it far more intimately than he did most humans. It was darker than he remembered though, more tumultuous, full of things with sharp teeth and sharp words, strengthened by Dean’s memories and fed by his emotions.
It was around midnight that the sound of the front door swinging open woke Dean out of the fitful doze he'd fallen into on the couch. Lisa was nothing more than a dark silhouette in the hallway, identifiable only by her curly hair and sweet-smelling purfume. She flicked the light on, gasping when she caught sight of Dean, sitting up and yawning, one hand going to her chest in fright  and knocking the heels she must have taken off earlier against her chest.
"I'm pretty sure we only got away with it because all the angels were so busy getting ready for doomsday. Bigger problems, you know?"
Sam jumped slightly, sitting up at Cas' sudden focus. "The reapers informed us that Death himself brought you here."
So that was what it was like to have your be mother angry at you. It felt startlingly similar to when Dean was angry at him, which wasn't a feeling he wanted to examine too closely. He didn't like it.
“Honestly, what did you think would happen when you dragged Michael and Lucifer into that pit with you? That they would sit down and chat to each other for eternity? Gabriel and Lucifer might have, but Michael always did have a temper. He killed the two of you the second he got his feet under him in the Cage.” He brushed an invisible speck of dust off the shoulder of his jacket.
“Still, you could wipe this out in a few hours,” Gabriel pointed out, as if he was listening to his thoughts. Yes, even Castiel could return the garden to its glory in a few short hours, then spend the next few days in the ether regenerating his grace. But it seemed unwise - it also didn’t appeal to him.
Dean seemed as if he couldn’t be bothered to tear his eyes away from a contestant frantically running fabric through a sewing machine. “Yeah, it was on when I came in here.”
“Once we have ruled out restless spirits, perhaps we should consider a conversation with Henry Winchester,” Castiel continued serenely, as if he’d suggested running down the street to the store.
Of course, Castiel could fly anywhere he would like to spend time: the Swiss Alps, the Great Wall, a jungle in Malaysia, the rings of Saturn. Angels were accustomed to long silences, waiting for a need to arise. They had no need to exist on the mortal plane at all.
In the way he said it, Castiel assumed that Gabriel was quoting someone, but he did not know whom. Metatron would have enjoyed talking with Gabriel, although he wasn’t sure if Gabriel would have returned the sentiment.
Gabriel shut it off suddenly like slamming a door closed, and Castiel jerked back his probing thoughts at the last minute, stung. Castiel rose slowly to his feet, not looking away from Gabriel’s eyes. They both stood still for several long seconds, surprise reflected in each other’s eyes at how much power had accumulated in the room before it dissipated.
Opening the refrigerator, Dean considered whether to cook a full breakfast, but he just didn’t feel like making eggs and toast and the full shebang for just him. He decided on a wholesome breakfast of just bacon and beek jerky, so there was only one pan and plate to clean. It was the sensible choice.
Taking on the garden through grace alone would take either a single, immense influx of power or a steady expenditure over a long period of time. He could replenish his grace, but it would require rest, which was not a luxury that Castiel often afforded himself.
Castiel jumped, losing focus briefly and shattering a terracotta pot, before he recognized the voice. He closed his eyes and continued collecting his grace into a single purpose.
Then he opened a hand and condensation beaded up on the glass as if it was horribly hot and humid outside instead of frigid. Rain began to drop from the ceiling, thick and slow like a rainforest. Gabriel’s warm, golden eyes held an apology.
He knew that their last night in bed had ended on a prickly note, but goddamn - if Cas was scared off by prickliness, he surely wouldn’t be around anymore.
“ANGEL OF THURSDAY, do not forget I am the left hand of the most high, steward of souls yet to be, fifth of the eternal watch, the mighty herald, keeper of holiness!”
“You cannot harm me,” his voice boomed, then faded back to his earthly voice, “although you need not try.”
Gabriel had settled into his own odd pattern around the bunker, disappearing for hours only to reappear without warning to make a well-timed joke or help out with a random task. Even Castiel was uncertain where Gabriel went when he was gone - perhaps he went to the aforementioned rings of Saturn.
“I do not want to expend too much energy on this project while we are still uncertain if the bunker is safe,” Castiel explained.
“I could go fetch her,” Gabriel’s voice likewise appeared from nowhere, and suddenly it was a big family meeting. “I’ve always had a thing for psychics. There’s something sexy about someone knowing what you want before you even want it.”
They sat in companionable silence, with Castiel not asking for Gabriel’s help and Gabriel not offering it, while Castiel focused on several other pots and planters, slowly restoring the soil.
Once he got the dream down on paper, he stumbled out of his bedroom, his circadian rhythms fucked to hell. By that point, Dean was sacked out in the den, a blanket over him, while a marathon of Project Runway played. Sam had never seen Dean watch Project Runway before - he definitely enjoyed some good reality tv, but Dean’s tastes veered toward trashier shows, like Jersey Shore or the Bachelor.
“Blimey, the angel is drunk,” Crowley gawked, looking from his glass of whisky and up to Castiel as if he’d snuck a drink, or several, while Crowley wasn’t looking.
“Right,” Dean mumbled, putting an absurd amount of cured meat on his plate. He thought about scurrying away to another room, but he had no good excuse to leave the room, so he put his plate down and sat at the table across from Castiel.  “I’ll call Missouri.”
He’d finally fixed the leaky faucet in the hall bathroom, a simple repair he’d been meaning to do forever, but never had time for. And he was pretty sure he was either going to have to start exercising or change his diet if this house arrest lasted much longer.
“Tim Gunn is hot, or Heidi Klum is hot?” Sam asked, almost with sincerity because it seemed like a legitimate question given that his brother was in a same-sex relationship. Or well, kind of.
The plants there had been neglected for so long, there were only a few petrified shrivels of leaves left, and all of the dirt was bone dry, cracked and peeling away from the pots and beds. The Men of Letters had used the Green Room to grow herbs, medicinal plants and some edibles that they needed for spells or potions, as well as to provide an ongoing source of food if they’d ever needed to hide in the bunker for an extended period of time.
It was unclear whether the mundane nature of the activity was because their dreams were stunningly mundane, or if their poltergeist was just unimaginative. Either way, Dean was grateful that angels didn’t have dreams to haunt, because who knows what they would find when one of them woke up.
“I do not believe the bunker is haunted by a ghost or lost soul, but a medium could give us certainty.”
Dean sat on a bench, looking remarkably whole. His first reaction was to throw his head back and laugh.
There was nothing physical or mental that tied him to the bunker. But he found that he took greater pleasure and delight in the small details of the world as time went on. Not to mention, he felt a need to be near.
He wanted to watch the Princess Bride on tv and re-enact the sword fight in it with the Christmas sword, but no part of the bunker was safe for such activities with Gabriel in it. He would never live it down.
Dean released Castiel with a frustrated exclamation, “Alright! Alright. Ask your damn questions.” But his smile was undimmed, softening the bite.
Some small part of Castiel recoiled. Just as soon as his father had come, he’d left again, and Castiel had so little time with him. But it was a distant pain at this point, soothed over after centuries of adjustment to abandonment.
In a bar on the other side of the country, Castiel stumbled into the wall and three heads whipped toward him in alarm. He almost responded to Dean’s prayer reflexively, flying immediately to his location, then he remembered Sam.
“Dean Winchester,” she said again, but this time scandalized, “are you boys tangled up in something dark?”
He blasted AC/DC from his record player and put on his clothes in a stupor until Sam banged on his door, shouting, “I’m trying to fucking sleep, asshole.”
As Dean stepped into the kitchen, his mood lifted because at least there was bacon. Then he noticed Castiel sitting at the table, and just like that even the promise of bacon wasn’t enough.
Together, they watched the designers present to the judges, trading occasional comments between them like “says the dude wearing soccer socks” and “those earrings would be a helpful hunting accessory.”
When the judges eliminated one of the contestants, Dean yelled “Robbed!” and threw multiple jerky wrappers at the tv. Sam just said, “Dude, you need to eat better.”
“What if I could arrange for you to be, uh,” he couldn’t think of a good word for it, “teleported here?”
But three days in, it felt awkward and conspicuous, and Dean had no idea how to broach the subject without sounding like an asshat. From the very first days that he and Cas had started hooking up, Dean had never once had to ask Cas outright to sleep with him. Now they were several years in, and he found he didn’t know how.
Dean rose after several hours of fitful, daytime sleep in a cold bed alone. He made a futile attempt to hold onto the last dream he’d had, but his phone’s alarm had already dispelled it and all he could remember was something about Bobby and Rufus and beer.
“No,” Dean lurched up from the couch to glare at Gabriel. “She watched us grow up. I don’t need to ever think about Missouri in that way, fuck you very much. But also, she’s already pretty blown away by the prospect of Castiel picking her up tomorrow. If an angel celebrity shows up tomorrow, you’re gonna spend the entire afternoon on her couch answering questions instead of here communing with the dead.”
“That doesn’t seem like a great plan,” Dean responded, thinking of all the trouble Castiel had caused in heaven and the fact that they were leaderless right now. He halfway envisioned it looking no better than purgatory up there.
The room returned to the bright, cold catacomb in an instant. “Ah,” Gabriel sighed in understanding, then smiled and said loftily, “‘I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars.’ And all that.”
Sitting on the ground, he put his hands on the cool tile floor. He asked his being to expand beyond his human body, and he felt the slow fission of his greater self unfold as his wings opened up from his back.
“It’s coming along very well, thank you,” Balthazar said, finally seeming to trust his food when he took a bite out of it. Gabriel shot Cas a smirking smile. “The dancers are incredible but we’ve always had high hopes for this class.”
“It’s probably just mom or a message for Jo, play it if you want,” Dean said shrugging. Ellen Harvelle’s messages to Jo were always hilarious as she pretty much ranted through the whole thing, even if Jo hadn’t done anything wrong, called Jo by her full name but then always ended it with a promise of a care package coming in the mail. Man those care packages were a blessing just for the cookies alone.
“Fuck, it’s getting late guys.” Charlie said between yawns. Jess was falling asleep on Sam’s shoulder and Amelia had already bid them good night while Anna sat and laughed with Ruby. It was a strange sight to see the two women get along seeing as they were so different.
“I wouldn’t piss him off dude, he’s got more reasons to kill you than I do and I won’t stop him if he wants to do so.” Dean
“I…I love you too.” He said. The words tumbled out of his lips and Castiel was scared as they did so because this was the first person to ever hear those words, said in that way, from Castiel. He didn’t give his love out easily. He had originally thought he didn’t love in him to give but Dean changed that. Dean Winchester had come along with that damn leather jacket of his and made Castiel love him but as Dean pulled him in for a chaste kiss a thought boomed through his head.
Cas grabbed their wooden rehearsal swords while Dean plugged his iPod into the speakers. The track started and they got into their first positions.
“Because I’m just going to leave you here and act like your constant mood swings don’t piss me the hell off! Because even though you’re a total asshole I might actually think of us as friends and I might care about you.” Dean snapped back just a fiercely. “Why can’t you just fucking see that already? Are you blind or something?”
He stayed sketching until he heard the front door downstairs open. His father called out into the house and Castiel responded by turning up the music he was playing. He heard Michael say something though he couldn’t pick out the words. No doubt it was something relating to the music Castiel was blasting out which was the same music that Luke used to try and drown the house in when he was a teenager. It was thanks to Luke’s determined noise pollution that Castiel had grown to love the same classic rock which no doubt pissed off his father and Michael but Castiel was long since passed caring.
Jo’s eyebrows shot up almost as quickly as Sam’s but the grateful smile on Cas’ face was the only thing that matter.
“Oh ok…” Hannah said looking put out. Most of the company members lived their lives via their assistants and it pissed Castiel off to no end. Zachariah’s assistant was close to a break down from all the work he was given. “Oh hi.” She added once noticing Dean stood next to Castiel. “My name is Hannah. I’m Mr Nov- Castiel’s assistant.”
Castiel raised his head and instead of red rimmed eyes Dean saw nothing but steely determination. As Dean stepped closer he saw that the normally bright white light of Castiel’s soul was cracked with red, almost like veins. Indignation surged like a frenzied river current under Castiel’s paint splattered skin.
Instead of going into the warm looking living room, Cas took Dean upstairs and into a spacious guest room. The walls were painted a deep, honey colour that matched the wooden furniture perfectly. Unlike Dean’s guest room, which was really a junk room, it was immaculately clean. Dean was about to make a quip about the cleanliness of the room before he stopped.
but we're sinking fast out here and we've gotta act soon. You don’t need to get out here, we just need pages from your dad's journal or your advice. I hate saying 'please' but please help us." Jo said pleadingly. “We’re running out of ideas here Dean.”
Dean chuckled and Cas was flooded with memories at the sound. His stomach ached with longing to make Dean laugh like that again and again. This really wasn’t going to end well at all.
“Stop avoiding me then.” She shot back kicking Dean’s leg lightly. “I know I pissed you off the other day with the whole Novak thing but I’m sorry. Stop being a pissy little girl and just talk to me! Drinking at the bar is less fun when you have only Adam talking about random crap or Charlie either talking about whatever ‘Larping’ is or how one of the nurses on the third floor has really pretty eyes.” Jo said looking thoroughly pissed off.
"No, I'm at Stanford and I couldn't miss a really important test." Jessica explained with a blushed.
“Yeah. When’s the party again?” Dean asked. Instead of an engagement party (because the engagement had been so short) Anna had planned a pre-wedding party. Amelia and Jimmy had forgone a normal bachelor and bachelorette party. Apparently, they had far too much to do to waste three days recovering from killer hangovers. They may have had a point there.
"I believe you." Dean said. Josie called for filming to stop while Jess grabbed Ruby for makeup touch ups. Dean motioned for Cas to follow him while he distanced himself from everyone else. "Hey, the date is going well but Josie wants you to ramp it up a bit."
"Dean Winchester you have been ignoring my messages." Mary Winchester said as soon as she picked up the phone. Damn, she sounded pissed.
"What is it with this Jess girl? Who is she, Helen of fucking Troy?" Dean asked. Sam and Gabriel stared back at him blankly. "Homer? The Iliad?
“If you don't want to take it I understand because you have a life here and friends but there we could just be us, there would be no judgemental interns giving you shit over our relationship. We'd be working together to improve the lives of millions of people around the country with heart problems. We’d be together in Baltimore saving people’s lives." Cas added almost babbling and dean could see he was becoming excited by the idea.
!” Becky cried, frantically typing before she looked up and motioned for Castiel to sit down. “So, Castiel...apparently you’ve been terrorising Mr. Henriksen’s English class again.”
"Like you said, I was the only one taking notes. I know what to do." Dean said cockily because he actually did know what to do. Sure Novak would also make him hold a clamp or be on suction duty but Dean was still going to watch heart surgery. Actual heart surgery.
“Mom, Dad. This is Cas Milton, he’s my roommate here at Lawrence.” Mary looked over at him with a smile while John looked thoroughly bored by the whole thing. “Cas, this is my mom Mary, my dad John and my little brother Sammy.”
“Yeah and that’s why I’m not leaving him here with you. You’re sober now…but for how long? How long until you get a call and have to leave Sammy here with just Bobby? How long before you just take off for weeks on end without a real reason?” Dean snapped. “I ain’t leaving and you can’t make me. It’s as simple as that.”
He did not stop for nearly three hours. For the entire car journey he had refused to look back, refuse the think about how Gabriel’s body lay on the backseat of his car. He kept driving, music blaring loudly to stop the screaming in his head. He heard his father’s voice yelling at him over and over again. He heard his mother sobbing about losing a son and he heard Samandriel question repeatedly over how Castiel could have let Gabriel be hurt. He heard this until he thought he was going to go insane, that was when he’d turned the radio on to any random station that got signal and turned it up as loud as it would go.
“Gabriel just sent me a text message saying that I should prepare myself, what’s happened? Did Luke finally go crazy and kill your dad or something? Did he kill Michael?” Anna asked. “Oh my God, Nana Novak hasn’t died has she? That woman makes the best beef stew I’ve ever eaten.” She added with a voice full of concern.
Dean was walking over towards his girls when he spotted a familiar jawline. A very familiar jawline. The owner of that jawline was holding a steady cam and focusing on a few of the girls. What the fuck?
As if by magic, the relief in everyone’s face disappeared and were replaced with looks of worry. It was only the second day and Cas could already feel the pressure of senior year. How the hell were they all going to make it through the year without going insane or killing someone?
“That’s one way to put it I guess.” Castiel said. “I’m sorry you had to see that though.” Castiel added with a weary sigh. “It’s like the sharks are circling and I can’t do a thing to stop it.”
“Oh hi! You’ve finished it already?” Charlie asked sounding surprised. Castiel nodded at her as she beamed at him excitedly. “Wow and I thought I was a fast reader, what did you think of it? Didn’t you think that the main character’s core ideals were completely farfetched and…wait you probably want to get to lunch don’t you?” Charlie said.
“Mom this is Castiel, we have a few classes at school together.” Dean said nodding over towards Castiel. He braced himself as Dean’s mother looked over at him and was amazed to see her smile was just as bright as when she looked at her son.
“James was my father’s first name and Milton is Anna’s last name.” Castiel replied. “Both Gabriel and I have various pseudonyms we go by, as did Anna before she gave up hunting to focus primarily on research. Samandriel doesn’t have any because we’ve tried to keep him away from this lifestyle; he deserves a chance to live a normal life.”
“Hey Dad!” A kid around Claire’s age called out as he raced over to Dean. Dean looked over his shoulder, guessing that there was another parent near him. No. Just Dean. He looked back as the kid stopped at his feet.
with you. You were a gift sent from Heaven or Kansas.” Josie snapped. “I put that new skinny intern, I don’t know her name, on ‘suitor watch’ and she lost him. She
“Will you be ok?” Anna asked Castiel blatantly ignoring Dean’s remark. From the small pout on Dean’s face it was clear he was not used to being ignored by anyone. Castiel had to resist smiling at the thought of an angel pouting because it really didn’t go with the image he had held for so long of what an angel was meant to look like.
“It was the least I could do. I grabbed your jacket and stuff from the table.” Castiel said, holding out Dean’s worn leather jacket. “Listen…” he said, glancing down to a hastily written note in his hand. “This is my address, if you ever need to talk or you just want to get drunk on gin and tonics, I’ll be there.”
"Hey, uh..." Sam paused, glancing around the room. In the corner, Victor Henriksen raised his glass at him. Caleb and Pastor Jim offered him proud smiles, and Pamela gave him a blatant once over, complete with a salacious wink. He looked back at his mother. "Where's Dad? Is he here?"
"Yeah, maybe." He ran a hand through his hair. "I have been told that I have a saviour complex." Time to change the subject. "What brings you here, anyway?"
“So, Jesse,” Lisa cut in, kicking Dean under the table. “Did you sleep okay? I know Dean’s been fine on the spare bed, but he grew up in motels so I don’t trust his judgement.”
Thankfully, Ben chose that moment to shuffle into the kitchen like a pint-sized zombie in soccer pajamas, and the food was ready to dish up, so Dean was saved from having to continue making awkward small talk with the woman whose life he’d butted into.
"Wait," Sam said, frowning, "But thats all over now. And Lucifer is dead, so its not like they can restart it. Whats stopping them from breaking in here?"
“Three? I still love you.” She finished simply. He sucked in a breath, hope flaring to life in his chest. She held up a hand. “I don’t – I need time to process.” She said. “I need to think about everything you’ve said, and I need to figure out what I want from you, what I can give you back, knowing what I know now.” She chewed her lip. “I need time, Sam. And a promise that if I ever need more answers, you will give them to me, straight away. No lies.”
“I don’t.” Cas repeated. “Death has reinstated control over the souls within heaven, with extreme prejudice against resurrection. He interferes in nothing else, but there is not a single being in creation powerful enough to cross him.” He paused, allowing humor to creep into his voice.  “Not even you, Dean.”
Dean froze, bottle halfway to his mouth. His head snapped towards Cas, his brows angled downwards in a way that looked angry, but on Dean meant that he wanted to hide whatever it was that he was truly feeling.
Cas frowned, shrugging slightly. “I knew that you were likely to have a strong reaction. You and your brother have always had powerful emotional responses when receiving news about the other.”
"But he cannot currently move against me. He has the power currently - almost all of upper managment are backing him. But we -" he waved one hand at the room at large "- have numbers on our side. A full scale conflict would decimate both sides, and Raphael needs the full might of heaven."
A gentle hand touched his hair, and he jumped, but it was just Lisa, running slender fingers through the slightly greasy strands. He needed to shower, but the feeling was so nice, he couldn’t help butt lean into it, fresh tears streaking their way down his face even as he gasped and shuddered, trying to keep them back.
"You will not become an alcoholic under my roof, Dean Winchester," She'd snapped at him, truly angry for the first time. "My son lives here. I don't care how other hunters do it, you will not deal with your crap like this. It doesn't work, and it hurts the people around you." Shame had clawed its way up Dean's throat, because, God, she was right, and what kind of a peice of shit person did that? He'd been there for two days, and there he was, throwing all of Lisa's goodwill back in her face.
But all of that paled in comparison to the woman sat at his side, hand in his, blue blue eyes filled with tears. Mary Winchester was radiant here, dressed in a flowy top and jeans, hair long and impractically loose, beaming at Sam like he was a miracle, like he might disappear at any moment. There was no plaid camoflage, no concessions to the  hunter aesthetic. She was defiant in her softness, and Sam loved her all the more for it.
“Not unhappy.” She repeated. It sounded like nonsense, and the little smile she wore on one side of her mouth said that she knew it. “Not miserable. Not… drowning, the way you are now.” And… that was the thing, wasn’t it? Dean was drowning. Drowning in fear and sadness and anger so deep that even the idea of happiness seemed like the childhood dream of catching stars. Fundamentally impossible.
"Non-family hunters. Everyone who wasn't in the inner circle, or whatever we're calling it these days." She sounded begrudgingly entertained by the whole thing. "Only Harvelles and Winchesters allowed in at the moment, a few exceptions aside." She winked at Victor, who rolled his eyes.
“No,” Sam whispered. “I only just got here, remember? The last time you saw me –“ He cut himself off, suddenly uncertain that she even had seen him from her horrific pose on the ceiling of their room.  “- the last time we spoke, my brother had just come to see me, remember?”
“Uh, yeah,” he said, glancing between her and the pan as he flipped the bacon. “I was up early, figured I could help out a bit, y’know.” Lisa was still looking at him with that soft look on her face, and he felt his shoulders go up, defensive. “It ain’t gourmet or anythin’ but, uh,”
"Christ, you scared me," She whispered. "What are you doing downstairs?" She sounded slightly suspicious, which was more than fair, considering.
She let out a soft huff of laughter, face twitching in confusion.  “What do you mean?” She said, eyes flickering around the room. “This is my parents house, you know that.” Something a little like fear shone in her eyes, and Sam hated himself for causing it.
Which meant that he was going to get dressed and smile and teach a kid how to fix a goddamned car, and he would not curl up into a pathetic ball in a corner and wait for death to come and take him. He wouldn’t. Even if he tried, he had a sneaking suspicion that Lisa would appear and kick his ass back to functionality, and call Bobby to help her.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cas looked both worried and hopeful, terrified and impossibly determined. His face said “I’m here”. It said “whatever you need”. It said “let me help you". Crazily, after years of cut off moments and unnamed feelings, Dean felt like maybe, finally, he could accept. They had been to hell and heaven and purgatory. They had fought off gods and monsters and even their own Goddamn families, and fuck it, right there, right then, they could be brave.
At six o'clock she'd appeared from upstairs in a cloud of perfume, all dolled up in a nice black dress that made her legs look endless, and it was a sign of just how far gone Dean was that he hadn't even thought about trying to flirt with her. All he'd ended up saying was,
Lisa had announced that she and some of her friends from yoga had planned a girls night out at around lunchtime, and had let Dean know that he'd agreed to babysit.
“He reminds you of yourself, doesn’t he?’ She asked softly. He paused in slotting the rinsed plates in the dishwasher. He risked a glance up, but he’d been right about her expression, so he glanced back down again and nodded.
“It was good. I normally sneak into empty hotel rooms to sleep, so it was nice no know no one would come and try to kick me out.” He’d somehow already cleared his plate and was eyeing the leftovers. Dean wordlessly pushed the pan with the extra bacon towards him, trying to rub the bruise forming on his leg as surreptitiously as possible.
“Good. Now,” She clapped her hands together. “Show me how to get the hell out of this place.” She cast a look around the facsimile of her old house. “I’m tired of living in memories.”
Dean didn’t sob or scream. He still wasn’t capable of that, not yet, not really. All he could really do was gasp into Cas’ shoulder and bring his other hand up to grip shakily at his back, tendons spasming minutely as though being electrocuted. His lungs were working overtime to make up for the months of running on nothing but grace, his arms wound crushingly around his best friend, his brain emptying for the first time in forever, because the endless struggle for his own body was finally, finally over.
Except cars, he supposed. He like fixing cars, getting his hands dirty and making something broken whole again. Maybe he could do that. Call Bobby and ask him for weekend work fixing up some of his old junkers. Take Ben along, if Lisa didn't mind. Show him the ropes. Give him an actual skill. It was a nice thought, and Dean clung to it.
"Well, that would be Cas," Ellen leaned her elbows on the bar,  proud smile pulling at her mouth. "Came right in the other mornin' like a man on a mission, handing out warding sigils, telling us that he'd try and keep the others of our backs."
They both smiled, warm and tired at each other, until Jess looked away, out of the window, her expression turning lost. “Sam? Where are we?” She asked. He closed his eyes briefly.
Ten minutes later and they were in the garage, leaning over the open hood of the impala, dean with practiced easy and Ben with wide-eyed excitement, balancing carefully on an upturned box so that he could see properly.
Dean clenched his jaw, the muscles in his cheek jumping. He didn’t say anything. Cas released his hold on Dean’s arm, but he didn’t move away either.
Sharing close quaters with the Winchesters had made the very idea of solitude a terrifying one. It was ridiculous - Castiel had lived for uncounted millenia without friendship, and yet a few short months with humans and his very makeup had been changed - though he believed it was for the better.
"Mom, no," Sam said, "Don't do that. They had all of us on strings, all of us doing exactly what they wanted us to. It wasn't your fault."
Gabriel was still sore from the failed portal of the year before, for all he denied it. These days dead set on proving he he was back to full strength - hence the unnecessary display of power. Rowena, however, was the reigning champion of these competitions; it seemed that what she lacked in power she more than made up for in imagination and trickery.
“This is really Heaven,” he whispered, hope like he hadn’t felt in years springing to joyful life in his chest.
Castiel now had an office. It was large and bland and would have been incredibly empty if he hadn't strong-armed Rachel and Hannah into sharing it with him. They had both protested, unused to having a superior willing to lower themselves to their level, but Cas had steamrollered their arguments out of sheer desperation.
"Everything went quiet about a week ago," Jesse said, impressively clear through his set of chipmunk cheeks. "All the demons just - disappeared."
She shook her head at him, eyes fixed on his.  “I… I don’t…” She stopped, looked around the room as though searching for answers as the faux calm that heaven had cast over her began to crack. “Did we drive here?”
“Dean,” she started, and oh, God, that was a serious face if he’d ever seen one. “You show up at my door, traumatized to Hell and back – literally – after losing the last bit of family that you had, telling me that you have been fighting a war for the last two years – which isn’t even counting the rest of your life – asking me for help. Well, guess what, bucko, this is me. Helping.” Her dark eyes bored into Deans, and he looked away. Her voice softened. “You can’t stay in my guest room forever. You’re thirty, Dean. You have a lot of life left to live, and your brother wanted you to live it.”
“What, the angels are all out of resurrection juice? You couldn’t bring Sam with you when you came down here for a little chat? Did you expect me to be fucking grateful?” Deans voice got louder, his steps faster as he paced murderously. Darkness crept in around them until all they could see was each other.
“In heaven.” Cas told him, allowing the relief he felt to seep into his voice. “I spoke to him earlier, in Ash’s Roadhouse.” He watched as Dean cycled through a thousand different emotions, the sheer force of them warping the fabric of the dream, whipping wind over the surface of the water, the sun winking out behind a sudden surge of grey clouds. He gentled his voice. “He’s alright, Dean.”
She buried her face in her hands, wheezing, while Sam peered at her with concern. Her head snapped up. “Oh, God,” she said blankly. “I’m the fridged love interest, aren’t I?
It was the birdsong that first alerted Sam to the fact that something was very wrong. The birdsong, and the fact that he was lying on something that felt an awful lot like dirt and pine needles, the air around him still and warm.
"Yeah, thanks for inviting my dad in for an I-told-you-so lecture," Mary cut in, swatting Ash over the head good-naturedly. Ash pulled a face at her but kept going.
“I have my own people to go and see, mister. You’re a big boy, Sammy, you can handle this. Get!” She made a shooing motion at him, and he laughed and turned back to the blurring line of the threshold between heavens.
"He informed me that Lisa Breaden had been encouraging to reach out to people he... cared for. Bobby and myself were the only ones he mentioned, but I expect there will be others. She also has given him some literature designed to aid humans coping with grief."
"Don't." Mary cut him off, voice sharp, eyes bright with anger. "Don't you defend him. Don't you do that, Sammy. I've heard his excuses a hundred times, and they are not good enough. Not by a long shot, and you know it. So just..." She breathed in, slow and shaky, drained her glass. Sam swallowed, shifting guiltily in his seat.
That night, he'd had nightmares about his dad coming home the way he used to, drunk and miserable, snapping at Dean while Sam hid away, pretending to be alseep. John's voice had gotten louder and louder, his taunts crueler and crueler, until his face turned into adult Sam, furious and betrayed, and Dean had  jerked awake, gasping. That had been almost a week ago, now.
“The same way everyone gets here, Sam,” Death told him patiently. “You died. As did Lucifer. I’m told that’s what happens when an angry archangel sticks his sword between your ribs and burns your body to ash.”
Two couples, one very old and one very young were eating in quite. finding  himself a booth to sit at castiel tried not to be too self conscious.
"I don't know man but I get it, you had rough day. Come, sit, let me get you drunk and we can talk."
They had the rest of their lives, maybe eternity to try make it perfect and romantic. For now they stayed lazily in bed kissing like an old married couple and they were happy.
"Thank you Claire, lucky for both of us I'm completely fine. I'm sure you'll drive very carefully in the future just stay away from dogs."
Dean rolls his eyes at him "look This place is full of old people, you're gonna have tons of customers AND you'll be surrounded by books which is freaking awesome. plus it's peaceful and you can have your privacy."
"Let's see, I cook although not good enough for any payin customer to eat" I plan hits "exercise" I clean and organise my weapons "I read a-"
"Yes let's put it that way, I'll talk to crowly tonight and let you know how it goes. Can you come around tomorrow? I'll either be here or at Bobby's"
He dreamed of happy things, a road trip with the four of them. Later jody and the girls joined them. They were laughing about something, dean wasn't sure what but he felt good and happy when he woke up.
His headache is still going strong and most of his body feels sore but it's nothing a hot shower and a couple of hours of sleep can't solve. God knows he's had worse.
He did a few with sam but mostly he tells him to go with Eileen. They work well together and he trusts her to have his little brother's back.
Dean is getting old, it doesn't hit him suddenly like the aging spell did all those years ago. He notices it in the little stuff like how his back hurt alot more than it used to when he passes out drunk on a chair or more likely the floor, how his headaches the morning after are far worse and last longer.
He didn't know any words that could deliver all the emotions going wild inside of him at the moment. He doubted there were any.
"Yes sam, it's me" he sounded like cas, dean thought "Jack brought me back I-" he was cut off by sam throwing himself into his arms, he hugged him back with a soft smile.
"I wanted to dance with you forever but we had to get back or your dad would've killed us" he says with a small laugh "I knew from that day tho, I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you"
"Yes, thank you for furnishing the house before I arrive" he hates most of it but he also knows interior design isn't a part of his vast skill set.
Not that he's gonna let it stop him from drinking, because frankly he doesn't know what else to do with himself.
Their happy faces, the good food and the music really make castiels plans on being annoyed with the world difficult. What in the 80s crappy sitcom is happening here? Kind of feels like he's intruding in a private moment, leaving money for the food and a generous tip on the table he sneaks out while everyone is busy pretending they're in a freaking musical.
"Yeah He does that" dean sounded amused "I'm sure i can get him to give you a good deal, don't worry."
"oh it's not a theory, generations have done it before us my friends. It's practically a tradition." He has that little proud smile on his face again and cas finds himself smiling back. He's starting to feel the buzz of the alcohol.
"I'm sorry I was too afraid. I was afraid and I lost my chance and now you're-" a quite sob broke the sentence and he realized he was crying "and now you're gone"
"Pancakes" he said Starring at the green GOD so very green eyes "uh coffee, Black and pancakes please"
"Should you be drinking this much?" Hey if dean can find him a new job he can ask a damn question "I mean do you usually drink this much on the job?"
"I'll sit here and watch over you" cas said as he settled on the small chair in the corner of the room.
He's not saying hello to a cas no matter how hot the owner is. thankfully dean doesn't ask him to, they get into "baby" (God these people are weird). Dean asks him for his address and when he gives it to him he half expects dean to say he knew the previous owner too.
"Oh God please don't use your young lady voice I'm sorry"  she doesn't seem sorry but dean let's it slide.
"What if I never let go?" Dean thought to himself "who's gonna make me let go?" He was sure he would kill anything or anyone who tried taking the angel away from him again.
When dean got back he saw the angel standing exactly where he had left him. He remembered that time he told him "don't ever change" and when cas said "you changed me" he fought to urge to attack hug cas untill he realized he didn't have to. He could just hold cas and it would be okay. So he did.
"I forgot to ask is there anyone you'd want us to call? You're probably gonna be stuck here for a while"
"Yes. walk, run, hyke that sort of thing" he can see the look of disapproval on dean's face. Facanating how every single feeling he has is so clearly and honestly shown if you pay the slightest attention (or borderline stare in cas's case).
"You know the dog too?" Cas said with raised eyebrows making dean burst into laughter, fuck that's a beautiful laughter he would like to hear it again, when he's not lying in a hospital bed.
A few minutes later the food is ready and on his table with a sincere "enjoy" from the unfairly good looking waitress.
Dean laughed " oh well I think I've learned my lesson" he raised his head closing their distance. Fear and doubt found their way back to his mind, he looked at cas for a moment then closed his eyes.
"You better still be here when I wake up" he mumbled what in his head sounded alot more threatening.
"serving an special request for an special lady" dean says from behind the rusty computer and happily.
"One hundred percent. told you, most people here are on the run." Dean responses with a satisfied smile
Dean ponders for a moment then grabs a bottle of bourbon from the shelves and pours him a glass, an arguably safe choice but not wrong.
Jerry slowly leads dee to the smal empty space between the tables. Cas's eyes go from them to the young couple slow dancing alongside them and then to dean looking overtly proud of himself for making this happen.
It wasn’t particularly graceful; he essentially face planted Cas’ collarbone. His nose was crushed sideways; the weird canvas material of the trench coat was rough and the buttons dug uncomfortably into the side of Deans chest. The fabric itself still smelled of blood and gasoline and he was clutching at Cas’ hand so tightly that, had he been human, his fingers would have probably been in splinters.
“Just in time, Jesse. I’m about to plate up,” Dean nodded at the empty seat and grabbed the plates, setting them out on the table. Hesitantly, Jesse made his way over, offering a shy smile to Lisa and Ben as he sat. He looked better after sleeping, his eyes clearer and his shoulders lees tense, though he still wasn’t anywhere near relaxed.
"Yeah, good call. Uh, Lucifer? He's gone. His older brother, Michael, too. Sam, uh, you remember Sam?"
"Why?" Jesse screwed up his face, like Dean had announced that he thought tuna jello was a good idea. "I'm fine. It's not like anything can hurt me."
"You can say that again," Ellen knocked her shoulder gently against Sam's. "Michael trapped, Lucifer dead, Sam up here where he belongs. Almost makes up for all the crap that came before." She shook her head. "Almost."
“Shit,” he said at last. “I bet she kicked Dad’s ass.” His mouth pulled up at the corners in an uncertain smile, his eyes shining with tears. “You know, Sam never really got to meet her? Not as our mom. I bet they’re catching up.”
“I can’t imagine what you’ve been through. I know you told me a lot of it, but the amount of pain you must be in? It’s… there’s no way for me to wrap my head around it. I bet that happiness seems… further away than the moon right now.” Dean didn’t respond beyond a shrug. She wasn’t wrong.
When Ben had put away an impressive amount of pizza for someone barely scraping five foot, cleared his throat and asked,
They sat there, holding onto each other for a long time. The light outside changed, fading from clear blue daylight to the dazzling array of stars and galaxies that filled heaven’s simulated sky. Sam watched it with dull eyes, feeling cracked open and raw.
“Wife and kids, I think is what Sam had in mind.” He admitted. “I don’t know if that’s on the table, though.”
Samandriel wasn't young - no angels were 'young' anymore - but he had been one of the last angels ever created, and he had spent almost his entire life in heaven. This combined with his exuberance and chirpy nature served to cement his position of 'baby of the family,' muuch to his continued protests. Almost all of the angels working for Castiel found him endearing, and many of them went out of their way to protect him.
“A for effort buddy,” He said, and Cas tried not to preen, glad that he’d at least given Dean something to smile about.
"I leave you alone for a few hours," She sighed, but it didn't sound angry and Dean allowed himself to relax a little. She looked up at him, strangely two-dimensional in the sleepy haze of after-midnight.
Cas smiled ruefully. “Heaven is… tense at the moment. But currently it’s nothing I can’t handle.” He looked Dean in the eye. “I appreciate your offer of help, Dean. If I ever do need it…” He let himself trail off. Dean nodded, cleared his throat.
"Oh, Sam," she whispered, face pained. "I'm your mother. I was meant to protect you. There shouldn't have been anything in the world that could get through me to you. Nothing."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Fair enough, man." He said around a surprising set of dimples. "Fair enough. Guess we'll just have to make it up to each other, won't we?"
Cas found himself inspecting Dean, cataloging his every movement and expression, the microscopic changes of his body and face since the last time they had spoken. On the surface, he seemed much the same, but underneath the usual masks of bravado and indifference, Dean carried a kind of brittleness – a soul deep weariness that showed in the hollows of his eyes, in the slump of his shoulders, in the creases around his mouth.
“Dean?” He turned, offering a smile to Lisa, who stood sleep-tousled and groggy in the doorway, watching him with a bemused expression. “You’re making breakfast?” She sounded perplexed, but not unhappy.
"Leave that poor boy alone and come help me out back here Joanna Beth, before I stick you with dish duty." while Bill laughed at the two of them, eyes shining.
“Is Mom there?” He finally asked, eyes fixed on some distant point, his voice and face deliberately disaffected.
And she stood and walked out of the room, leaving Dean sat on her nice couch in front of her nice bay windows, feeling more lost than ever
"He might've already taken off," Dean said quietly. "But he just looked... I don't know, run down. Like he hadn't had the chance to stop for a while."
“Oh my God!” She took a single, hesitant, step forward, then threw herself at him. He caught her easily, arms sliding back into place against the familiar shape of her body, face coming to rest on her shoulder as he lifted her up, the smell of her favorite apple-scented shampoo filling his nose.
Sam’s blood turned to ice – this was it. She’d gone nuts. The insanity of his life had finally managed to ruin someone else’s death, which would be impressive if it weren’t so awful. Why had he let Mary convince him this was a good idea?
"Thank you." Cas said softly. It was strange how much a little encouragement could bolster his spirits. He paused to reorganise his thoughts. "Sam."
Lisa's book had said something about that. 'Healthy coping mechanisms,' or whatever. A hobby or something that you could do to make yourself feel better, or express your emotions or some kind of shrink crap. It made sense, in a way, but Dean's 'hobbies' were all either violent or self-destructive in some way, and the odds of him changing that seemed pretty slim.
“Your unfortunate younger brother is still alive, and therefore, for now, not my problem.” He straightened his coat with a sharp tug. “Goodbye, Sam Winchester. I wish you luck. For some reason, I think you’ll still need it.” And with that, Death vanished, like he’d never been there at all.
He wondered if Lisa was having fun, out doing whatever it was that women did when they got together. Get drunk and talk about boys, maybe? Though maybe that was more middle-school than single-mom. When was the last time Dean went out with friends just for fun? Never, most likely. Friends were few and far between, and the ones he kept were hunters too, on the road just as much as he was, always busy.
She flapped her hand at him. “No, no, I’m totally right. You know, at the start of a movie when everything is great and they want to get the plot moving, they have to pick someone to kill off and it’s usually the hot but underdeveloped female love interest – that’s me. Jesus Christ, I died and became a cliché, that’s…” She sank down in her chair, fingers pressed into her cheeks until the skin went white from the pressure.
"Yeah," Dean said. "Sam too. He sacrificed himself to do it, which..." He chuffed, without humor. "Is how I ended up here."
“How’d you know Dean?” Ben piped up after about three bites, clearly unable to hold back his curiosity any longer. Jesse looked surprised, eyes flicking between Ben and Dean, but Dean stayed quiet, unwilling to say anything that Jesse might not want shared with two complete strangers.
Something dark crept into Dean’s expression. “This isn’t a social visit, then.” He reached into the cooler sat next to the fishing rod and pulled out a beer, popping the cap off with practiced ease.
It didn’t even hurt any more, which almost worried him. How fucked up was he, that even his worst nightmares couldn’t break through the numbness? In a way, though, Dean was grateful. Numbness was better than pain. He’d had enough of that for a thousand lifetimes.
Death hummed quietly. “Not your personal Heaven, I’m afraid. I believe Raphael destroyed it when he received the news of what you did. This one, I believe, began as your friend Ash’s, and has now become something of a communal midpoint for hunters who knew each other in life.”
"Samandriel is one of my most trusted lietenants. He watches over this heaven when I am unable to." Cas informed them dismally, watching Samandriel fawn over an amused looking Sam, who seemed flattered by the attention.
"Why, because you're a kid." He held up a hand against the stubborn set to Jesse's jaw that definitely preceeded some sort of offended outbust. "A very mature, powerful,
"Don't sweat it, Cas, seriously," Sam said, though his face was disappointed. "You've got a hell of a lot on your plate right now. It was good just to see you."
The doorbell rang, and Dean jumped, then frowned. Lisa hadn't said she was expecting anybody, and she'd always, always let him know about stuff like that before. Sometimes it felt a little like being treated with kid gloves, but Dean was a paranoid bastard and he knew it, so mostly he just felt grateful.
The smell of bacon sizzling woke him up properly, along with the sharp sting of hot oil leaping from the pan onto his wrist and making him hiss loudly. It also seemed to act like a beacon, summoning the other occupants of the house downstairs in their pajamas and bedheads.
Jesse had eyed him skeptically at that, which Dean found mildly offensive since for once he'd been telling the truth.
“Well, what is on the table, then?” Dean shook his head. Nothing, was what. At the moment? With a gaping hole in his chest were his brother used to be, with a brain full of shit that would send most people howling to the nuthouse, with a soul so battered that it was a miracle there was anything left to it? There was jack squat on the table, and Sam had just been too stubborn to see it.
"So you're going up against Raphael," Sam said worriedly. "The same  guy who smote the crap out of you the night Lucifer got free?"
"Now don't you start up that nonsense, Mary Winchester. Sam's right. You were up against Heaven and Hell and destiny and all that crap, and you can bet that if they hadn't gotten through you one way, then they would have found another. Most likely one far worse than what you got. So you accept that you did your best, and that your son grew up into one of the finest men on the planet despite everythin' that those bastards put him through, and move the hell on." She pulled out a bottle of whiskey and poured a healthy serving into the glass before pushing it at Mary. "Or you'll drive yourself mad." Ash poked his head out from the back room and hollered at her, so she patted Sam's hand and went to deal with him.
There's obviously an story there and it's obviously not his place to ask, not that he cares ofcource. Maybe just a bit curious.
"Yeah, some time" dean mindlessly licks his lips and cas barley suppressed the urge to pull him close and taste them for himself. Neither of them breaks the silence or whatever the fuck it is they're doing with their eyes until they hear people coming in.
"He has the hots for my uncle" Dean sayed with wicked giddiness "They had a thing back in the day, before he left for the big cities, made some crappy deals with some shady people, got himself in trouble and ran back here."
There is an angry bark behind him as he's about to walk into the street, he freezes immediately trying not to ask himself "why does the universe hate me?" Because there are a lot of decent answers to that. but dogs? That's just being petty. It's not that cas hates dogs, really he tries to be friendly, it's the dogs that hate him. Always have
"Hello dean" he said and Dean's gun dropped to the ground and he was running to him without even realizing it himself. He only felt it when he was held tight in cas's arm and he let out the breath he was holding for weeks.
The thing about dying, Sam supposed, was that it eliminated a lot of people’s skepticism, so at least the disbelief had been kept to a minimum, but all that had really done was leave more room for horror and disgust at the reality of his life. Jess had cried when he told her the details of his childhood – more so than when he’d given her the sanitized version when they were in college – had turned green when he talked about the death he’d seen and caused, had sobbed when he talked about Dean’s sacrifice for him, the hopelessness and despair of being hounded by Lucifer.
It was a beautiful evening, Dean noted absently. The sun was hidden behind engorged thunderheads congealing on the horizon, the clear sky above his head purpleing like a fresh bruise, freewheeling birds silhouetted against the dying light. He could hear his family behind him, murmuring softly to each other. Part of his brain whispered that he should join them.
