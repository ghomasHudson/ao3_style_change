“But you did get us 50 dollars brother.” Benny commented. “And 390 dollars just from the auction. I am sure you would have surpassed 500 with the ticket collections.” Garth added.
“Caaas. Sta – hahaha – ap. Ple – eeaa – sse.” Dee cried between giggles. Cas loved Dee’s laughter. He wished he could hear that from Dean. “Caas.” Dee yelled, getting Cas out of his thoughts. Cas looked at Dee, how tears of laughter pooled in her green eyes, how her face was filled with glee, and how peaceful and relaxed she looked, for a person who had just been tickled to death. “Hey, its been a while since we decided to watch a movie.”
“Belphie, its none of your business.” Adam scolded, “But are we?” He questioned, getting a smack on his head from Kaia.
“Eileen?”
“I might be. He’s so dreamy.” Charlie said.
“We don’t have to let your efforts to go to waste.” Dean said in a squeaky voice, and Cas smirked, lifting his eyebrow.
“Birds and whales can’t talk.” The boy frowned. “Moreover, birds are known for singing and whales just yell. Like yeeaAAAAAAAAAA-”
“I told you. You are li-”
Sonny looked at the boy assessingly, then replied, “I don't see why not, man.” Deputy took his sunglasses off, revealing his bruised eyes, as he thanked Sonny. “Where'd you get the shiner?” Sonny asked and the boy snickered.
“No,” Gabe replied softly, “you look beautiful like the way you are always.” Gabe brought their foreheads together, “Now, Cassie, let me sit on your lap.”
“4 of them are yet to come.” Sam replied instead, looking through his phone. “Three of them-” he jerked and sat up straight, turning to Gabe who was glaring at him. Sam’s face then morphed to realization before he continued, “-already… um… have been given… directions. Yeah.” He ended and bowed down.
“I confessed my love to  Dean and I don’t know. I just don’t know how he would react.” Cas shared.
“What about you two?” Eileen asked.
“I like you too Adam. Why would I not like you? We are friends after all.”
“It’s ok Garth.” Eileen said. “We all didn’t think about it. We can ask him tomorrow or something.”
Castiel was freaking out. Sure, he played it off cool but his sons’ teacher all this time had been their dad! And his sons loved him. And he had been crushing on him. And still loved him. From the twins’ stories of him, Dean hadn’t changed a bit. He had made his sons watch the movies Dean had showed him. And more. He didn’t know what to do. Does he talk with Dean? Run away? Curl up and cry? Did Dean still love him?
“1!” Cas leaned in and kissed Dean softly. He pulled back and smiled lovingly at Dean. “Happy new year, honeybee.”
, Belphie thought.
Eliot winced as he heard a flowerpot crash. He turned to say sorry to Jacob, only to find him an inch away from his face, with an amused smile, that now fell, as his eyes went to Eliot’s lips. “Hey.” Jacob whispered softly.
"Oh." The mother said before turning to Cas. "Oh! You are a Prince? I am stuck in a room with a Prince?"
“You can use the cord for charging.” Hannah said. “Easier to speak and save battery.”
“You know what happened Adam.”
“Yeah sure man.” Sam was ready to help. This guy looked really confused and lost. “What do you wanna know?”
Castiel had met Meg, Balth, and Gabe during his run to the hospital. Jack, when he was 2, had gotten a fever, and the temperature was very high. And his unfortunate luck, his car wasn’t starting, and his phone wasn’t working, so he had to do the inevitable, talk with his neighbors and ask for help. Since he had shifted to La Honda, Castiel had stayed home and taken care of his two precious gems, living off the money he had earned during his time at Sonny’s (which was a LOT).
“Meg. I think my water just broke.” Jess looked at Meg with wide eyes. Meg could see she was panicking.
“I don’t want that. I had a nice time in the park.” Dean argued.
“Awesome!” Dean breathed out. For the next few minutes, the air was filled with Dean and Cas’ breaths. Regaining their breaths, Dean asked, “Hey Cas… remember our Summer of Sex.” At Cas’ ‘hmm’ Dean continued, “Clit fetish, check.” Dean ticked the air, causing Cas to laugh quietly.
“No. I got over that. I actually wanted to talk to you about something yesterday, but it slipped out of my mind due to the fight. You got a minute now?” Sam asked, and Bobby nodded. The two walked to the main room and slipped into a chair. “Do you remember that boy I told you about and you called the Child Services?”
Next day, school was buzzing with the Hook Man fight and a recount from Lori Sorensen. Dean felt a little guilty that all the credit went to Hunter and Psychic, when Angel was the one who turned Hook Man into dustman. The football team was talking about their planned dates and how some already had them this weekend.
Belphie stood frozen on the spot. He didn’t know how it was able for him to get angry but when Krissy had told Eliot that she likes someone, he saw red. Krissy could have dismissed him, saying it was none of his business, but she didn’t. And now he had upset her.
“Ignore him Cas.” Amelia said. “But I do not get why you are embarrassed to meet Dean.”
“Sure!” Sam said, calling the planners.
“Alright then. Let’s do it. Let’s have a baby!” Dean said, closing his eyes to sleep.
“With the collar pulling and stuff. Why were you so mad?”
“What is that language though?” Dean asked. “You are yet to tell us what that language is.”
“Why? Without telling us that too?” Charlie asked. “Just can’t understand…” She trailed off as she saw unhidden fear and worry in my face.
“DEAN! Not in front of Mary. Apologize to your brother right now.” Ellen yelled as Mary gurgled. Dean muttered a sorry, and Sam whispered Jerk. When Dean complained to Ellen, she asked, “What are you, 5? Finish your dinner.” Jo, Jess, and Sam snickered while Dean sulked the whole dinner.
🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅
“So, five days before the wedding. How are you two doing?” Ellen asked setting the table for dinner.
“Fuck off Crowley, I am leaving.” Sam was bored. He finished whatever he had to do, and there was still 10 hours left for tomorrow. He hated it.
“Papa. Yesterday Krissy and Belphie danced together. First, they were so awkward, even Mary cringed. But then they relaxed and were fine. We all said goodnight to each other and went to our rooms. After I talked with you this morning, I noticed Krissy and Belphie were talking with each other. Better, but not like last night. They are still awkward around each other. They danced as friends yesterday, but they haven’t crossed the line, you know?”
“Loki!” Kali screamed as she ran down to see what had happened to her love. If his brothers had something, she would kill them. Slowly and painfully.
“I don’t have a crush on Dean.” It had been 3 weeks since he had confided with Kelly. Kelly let out a sigh and was about to make Cas understand when he said, “I like him. It’s not a mere crush.”
. Meg, their wedding planner, had told them to use the time as a brainstorming time. She wanted to know what theme, flowers/ice/balloons, cake, and food they would be interested in, and told them to use the whole of November to really think about it. Sam and Jess had thought a month was a lot of time to brainstorm, but by the meeting date, the two had narrowed down to 4 different themes, each having a related flower, cake, and food. They had argued a lot, only to be broken up by Dean the Peacemaker.
“Oooh! That wood be lovely! Pray tell, wot have you got there?”
“STRATEGIST!” Dean hollered in protest, from outside, as he got into his car, and drove off.
“It’s fine. I am comfortable here.” Cas smiled. “Unless you aren’t!” Cas exclaimed as he tried to get off Dean.
.” Dean said.
“Oh… that wasn’t a girl. It was Angel.” Dean said.
“Charlie! You are here. SETTLE THIS NOW!” Jo almost jumped on Charlie as the three sat down.
“Dean was absent today,” Cas replied solemnly, “Don’t know why.” Cas went back to staring at the ground, not noticing Bobby looking at him knowingly and smirking to himself.
“Bye Ro! Thank you for getting Kevin back and tracking the tablets.”
"Alright." Jo said, squeezing her mate's hand, "let's do this."
“Exactly. I am not going to punch you.” Dean said to Sam, who huffed annoyed. “We are good ok. For real, we are good.”
“So, Krissy, what are you doing later?” Belphie asked, then cringed because they were both in the same house and he knew they were going to eat dinner.
“And I love you.”
“Um… I remember the ball coming to my face. Why?” Krissy asked.
The 3 had dinner later then went to sleep, happy to have got some information about Angel.
He sent a message saying he had to talk with Cas and slept. He knew what to do now.
“That he was uncle to 3 not 2 boys.” Angel whispered. “Anyway!” He said loudly, “Next.”
“Hi Lydia. My date and I will take a while to decide.” Dean said taking the menu from her, subtly letting her know that he was on a date.
Rowena glared at Loki before turning her head to the side and downing her bottle. “Oh yeah?” Loki said and turned completely around, his back facing Rowena. They couldn’t remember what round they were on, but they felt a familiar buzz. Rowena turned to see if Loki had turned back but he hadn’t. She wanted to turn her head back to where it was, but it moved down on its own accord, focusing on Loki’s tight pants that accentuated some beauties.
“The past few weeks Batman has looked stressed. Sure, he makes us laugh like usual, but I noticed he is a little nervous about something. I asked Belphie and he said he too noticed him acting different than usual. He usually makes us laugh so me and Belphie thought we could make him laugh.”
Jack’s father and his uncle had dropped Clark and Jack in front of the aquarium and left. Clark had gone to get the entrance ticket, that were free on Saturday, for both him and Jack.
“I’ll stall your old man.” Sonny took the duffle Dean was carrying and left.
“You kill the witch. But looking at how Kevin already killed him, if you want to break the curse, we need to find that book.”
It was the second Sunday of January and they met again. Meg and Gabe were meeting with the Campbell-Moore couple, while Balth was checking on some stuff for the Blake-Cooper wedding. Castiel loved hearing his twins call Claire as their sister. He could also see Claire visibly brighten up when they called her that. Amelia and Claire had gotten used to seeing a copy of Jimmy by now and were able to talk with him about how Jimmy used to be. Castiel wanted to learn more about Jimmy, him being the most recent death of his family. Castiel was sad that his sister had died when she was 5, and his parents weren’t alive to meet their grandkids. He couldn’t believe how fate worked. He had shifted to La Honda, California after Sonny’s death, and so had Jimmy after his parents’ death. They weren’t able to meet each other but at least life had gotten their kids together. Castiel was really happy. Right now, they were in a beach, while the kids were squirting water guns at each other.
“Then?”

“Jacob!” It was Eliot. He skated right towards Jacob and collapsed onto him. Jacob held Eliot as the skateboard went and crashed into another flowerpot. “Sorry.” Eliot said with a small smile and nervous shrug.
“I’m going go change, and help you whip up some bad boys using Bad Boy.” Deanna said as she ran to her room.
“Sam!” Dean yelled. “Get some cushions.” He said as he fixed the main room up and moved the clutter from the table.
“It’s a nest. A vampire nest.” Psychic informed. “They have kidnapped a girl in there. There are a lot of them. We need more Dead Man’s Blood.”
“Well looks like I have to go. Luci’s looking at me viciously.” Kelly said as she went to work. The owner of the restaurant was Nick. No last name. More like he didn't bother sharing it. Kelly called him Luci but Cas didn’t understand why. No one knew where he came from. The only thing they knew about him was he was 20 and rich, opened this restaurant, and was someone to stay away from. Cas didn’t know why the last one was a thing. He didn’t agree. Nick was a quiet, nice man, who minded his own job. Unlike the townspeople.
“We have to go back.” Psychic said.
“We won’t if you can share a copy of the provenance of the original painting with us. We need it to spice up our high school project.” Sam said before Cas could disagree. Sarah nodded and left to the staff room. Sam turned to find Cas looking at him with a weird look. “What?”
“Well, then, why'd you steal bread and peanut butter?” At that, Dean halted. He shrugged and then asked.
“Sam? Mary?” It was Jess.
“Hey… you are back.” Sam said between grunts. Jess, Jack, and Mary got off Sam and sat near him, Mary trying to roll onto her dad. “What’s up?” Cas had gone to get Belphie and Krissy into the house, while Sam asked Dean what was going on.
Sorry I didn't post yesterday :(
“He was in a rush.” Bobby said as he came to Sam’s room with some drinks. “When do you need to be home by Eileen.”
“Sorry. Dean.” Cas said distantly then turned to him. “I… I have to leave… You can have my candies, bye.” Cas said shoving his bag to Dean and ran away.
"Well you've got no brownie points from me missy." Ellen muttered, glaring at Meg, who glared back.
(See the end of the chapter for
, Sam thought.
Jo and Jess’ cousins had come one week before the wedding to meet Mary and help with anything they needed. Jess’ cousins had gotten rooms in a hotel, while Jo hogged the couch.
“You lie.” Cas suggested. “Dean does it all the time.”
“You know, every time you humble me.” Hunter chuckled as Cas’ frown deepened in curiosity. “Hi there stranger, name’s Hunter.” He said as he extended his hand.
“I am Hunter,” Hunter said from his place, “I have nothing to say too, except for thank you. Thank you for helping Fighters like us and give us some break. I am sorry we have to stay in secret but all for the good right?” Hunter smiled nervously, for which everyone nodded, saying it was alright.
“Bugs Bunny.” Hunter said.
“Research”, Cas said, lifting her book and went back to burying her nose in it, to get rid of thoughts of how plump his lips were.
Krissy nodded and decided to just get over it. “You know Bel…phegor right?”
“Yeah. Dean didn’t allow me.” Cas said, then laughed as everyone scolded Dean for being selfish.
Cas fluttered his eyes open and gasped in a breath as he got up. He then turned to Loki, and his eyes widened in terror. Loki went for a hug, but he scrambled away from Loki, almost falling off the makeshift bed. “No!”
“Dibs on not digging the grave!” Sam yelled as he ran to his room, getting a ‘Son of a Bitch’ from Dean.
said the whale,

“Bad Boy?” Sam questioned.
“But that is due to complications… mom died because of my powers. The energy my powers gave. I was born as a 15-year-old. Not a baby.”
The brunette, now who he knew as Meg, calmed him down and told him to come inside. She then went out and brought two other people in. A short, long sandy-haired man, and another man, tall with short blonde hair. “This is Gabriel and Balthazar. I see you have two boys, which one is sick?” She asked.
“Awesome. Thanks Bobby!” Jody said as the two went to get their things from their car.
“Oh, and Bobby. Sammy wanted to ask you whether he could get his friends over to do the group project, but I didn’t know whether we could due to the Bat Signal. Nerd ran to his room without asking you to do homework.” Dean said pulling back.
"I have always been open with everything, have I not? What made you think that you not understanding your gender was going g to be accounted as a fuckup in my eyes?" Ellen asked.
“I set the cameras, not only to record the proposal, but also to live stream it. It’s on! Come watch!” Dean went and saw the laptop show Jess standing alone in the park.
“You wanna fart? Go out.” Jo said as she threw a wet tissue at Sam.
“Oh my god. I hate you all!” Sam exclaimed and Cas started laughing hard, Dean joining. Sam packed his stuff and walked to Eileen, who extended her hand to him. They held hands and left the cafeteria.
“Wow. Mine is really short.” Jess said, making everyone laugh, “Ahem. Ok. Sam. You’re smart and I’m funny. You hate olives, I love olives. I lose my keys, you find them. I eat like crap, you eat healthy. You bake brownies, I eat them. In other words? We’re perfect for each other. I will love you every day and every second. Even when I’m hangry. All in all, I love you, with all my heart, and I can’t wait to start a family with you and Mary.”
“An-” Dean stopped himself, “Who are you?”
"I am sorr-" The man started but flinched as Ellen roared.
“The football team’s having practice right now. Looks like coach felt they weren’t ready for the upcoming game.” Charlie said.
“I think we had a raincheck to… take… on.” Castielle hesitated, not knowing how to end the sentence, making Dean chuckle.
“Hi bees, wherever you are. I feel so disoriented Gabe. I hate you.” Castiel said trying to stand by himself.
“Hey, hey look there.” Cole, Free Safety, came up to Dean and pointed at the bleacher. Dean turned and a group of girls shrieked and started yelling ‘I love you, Dean!’ Cole chuckled and said, “Dude, you can get anyone of those this evening.”
“Goo-”, began a student.
THANK YOU FOR THE 500 HITS!!!!!!
“But what about the kids? Where will they go during the strip show?”
Dean didn’t know how karaoke night turned to Bluff night but now there were 5 pairs playing a really stressing game of Bluff.
“What’s going on?” Kali asked scratching her arm.
Dean turned around and beamed at Cas but then schooled his features and turned around. Cas attacked him from the back and sat on his lap. “Hey angel.”
“I don’t like Cas.” Dean quickly denied.
"And when Gabe grabbed your hand, he triggered it?" Anna said uncertainly.
Sam was feeling a little sad that Dean wasn’t here. Maybe he could get him a pie when he goes back. Jess and Sam had come down to their top 10, and then comparing their lists, the came down to 5. They were in a stalemate, not knowing which two to eliminate so Sam called Dean.
Claire walked up to him, looked him in the eye with a watery smile. “Hi Uncle Castiel.” She whispered, looking at her dad’s copy, for the first time since the convenience store incident.
“Dean-” Cas started but the dude spoke over Cas, “Mick Davies. Pleasure!” The dude, Mick, extended his arm for a shake.
Jack was speechless. He never thought that he liked Clark that way. Sure, Clark was his best friend, after Belphie, but now that he confessed, Jack feels maybe he likes Clark that way too? He thought about how he liked Adam, Alfie, Claire, and Kaia. They were fun to spend time with, he can play anytime he wants, and they had his back. Jack then thought how he liked Clark. Same as the others, but five times more. Belphie was incomparable. He loved Belphie, but his feelings for Clark were close, yet far. He couldn’t think of Clark as his brother, but also not as his friend. Clark was something else.
“WE WANTED TO KNOW IF BELPHIE WAS ALRIGHT CASSIE!” “Shut up, Gabey!” “I swear to god, Clarence was joking, and now he knows it’s true.” Gabriel, Balthazar, and Meg talked with each other, making Belphie laugh more. Castiel smiled fondly, happy to see that Belphie was laughing. After a round of bye and hugs, Belphie and Castiel left.
“Sure Donna!” Dean beamed at her. As soon as she went into her room, Dean turned to Sam and Bobby. “Ok… so?” Dean asked. “So, this kid, Casper the friendly ghost, or whatever, was weird.”
“I smell bacon. Let’s go.” Castielle released Deanna and left the room.
“July.” Sam replied.
“Cas,” Deanna called breathless, “I need you in the closet, please. Now!” She demanded yet pleaded. There was no verbal response from Cas, but seconds later, Castielle heard the grunts and noises from before.
“Right Ro!” Angel exclaimed. Rowena smiled at him and sat down. “Anyway, that’s the last of the Men of Letters. We can shift to the Warriors.”
“I know.” Eileen said, smirking as an idea appeared in her mind.
“No!” The twins yelled. “Let us get prepared.” Belphie said.
‘Awesome idea!’ Victor, another classmate said.
The next day everyone woke up late, due to the yesterday’s tension. Sam and Dean talked with the others, letting them know what had happened. Everyone was glad that Cas was alright. Dean had deliberately omitted the detail that him and Cas had kissed, thinking of sharing it after confirming it with Cas. Sam, being the younger brother he is, had teased Dean that he will tell the others, for which Dean threatened he would spill about Sam and Eileen, not only that they have been dating for 2 months, but also that they LOVE each other.
“Just one moment.” Cas said as he went to his car and got a duffel out of it.
“Will you marry me?” “I am pregnant.” Both looked at each other, then questioned, “You are pregnant?” “You are proposing?”
“It’s fine, I’ll go get my car.” Gabe said as he left. Jack turned to Clark and smiled.
“Papa. I don’t want to talk anymore… Can I just take the pie to my room?” Belphie asked in a really weak voice and Cas couldn’t deny him. At Cas’ nod, Belphie went to his room, just as Jack came out of Krissy’s room.
“Yeah ok.” Sam said, guessing Dean was joking because he didn’t want to stop correcting papers. Sam went back to Charlie and Gilda and talked about their wedding. Cas had approved Charlie’s small wedding, yet big Christmas/New Year party. They decided that everyone will wear normal clothes except Charlie and Gilda, who wanted to wear their LARPing costumes. The Queen and Fairy getting married would be awesome. Gilda’s fairy dress did look like a wedding dress, and Charlie's was a red flow-y gown, which could pass as a wedding dress. So they decided they will alter a little bit of the costumes to make it look more regal than torn.
“Good enough. You remember the story of how I became good?” She asked.
“How do you say I do that?” Cas asked, ready for a fight.
Dean was a mess. One look into those blue eyes and he was gone. He was really ashamed of himself. He had wanted to ask how Castiel had gotten the key but the words that came out of his mouth, in a really harsh tone due to nerves, were ‘Sticky fingers got you here, huh?’ The dude looked at him with a head tilt,
Overall, Belphie was now acting as a subtle wingman for Clark, and his OTP was Jack/Clark.
“Nothing…” Dean responded shaking his head and thinking of a quick lie, “Nothing. Just thinking about the auction.”
Grade.” He saluted and stomped his foot down, standing in attention.
“We’ll take the bags.” Sam said, as Dean and he got the bags from there and taking it upstairs, as the three adults followed.
Psychic stood there stunned. “Wow. That’s – That’s cool.” Psychic heard Hunter yelling his name. “Look I’ve got to go. Um… thank you.” He said as he signed, a poor imitation of something he saw in the movies.
“Cassie?” Cas heard Gabe’s voice.
“Well, have this.” Dean said as he launched a bullet into the witch’s head. She dropped dead. After cleaning, salt-and-burning the corpse with the hex bags, the three started back to the bunker. Little did they know that a shadow lurked behind, eyes purple.
The gang spend some time... Destiel spend more :)
After making sure with Benny that he doesn’t tell anything to the couple, they bought everything and left.
Dean and Cas had taken Belphie and Jack for baby stuff shopping, and the two bought all red things, saying they were shaping Grace up to love the color red. Mary had been happy to have someone in her age group as Grace and her were inseparable when they met. The two cried whenever they had to be separated. There were many times Sam/Jess and Dean/Cas had to pack extra, worrying the girls would have a sudden impromptu sleepover.
"What do you mean?" This time, the mother spoke up.
“That’s actually a good idea.” Dean said.
“NO! We will not tell anyone papa! We will not let anyone take you! We NEED you!” The twins alternated between exclaims, then crashed into Cas for a hug. A while later, the twins pulled back then looked at Dean. “You are our dad?” Jack asked.
Cas stood there for a while on his cycle, fiddling with his cycle handle and bell before shaking himself and settling back onto his cycle. As he cycled, he looked back, hoping something would happen… but nothing. He cycled with a forlorn look before stopping midway on the bridge. He was contemplating but didn’t know what to contemplate about. He was having a dilemma but what was that dilemma about.
“I can replace me with someone else. I have to erase myself.”
Unaware of the look Sam said, “Then why don’t you? The tour ended right?”
“Yeah. All thanks to Clarissa.” Bobby smiled. “She had learnt about the angels’ plan and also learnt about Angel and Demon tablets.” Bobby was about to get the book but saw how Cas and Loki were looking at their mom and talking to each other about her. “Turned out these tablets were written in Enochian and were buried in different locations. Clarissa had started an expedition tour and found the two tablets, Demon in Barbatos, and Angel in Missouri. She also discovered there was something called the Leviathan Tablet in Israel but that didn’t hold any instructions to how to shut off Angels. But had information about how to defeat Leviathans. After Clarissa got the key to shut Angels off, she did the spell and a barrier was formed. She had translated the Demon, Angel, and Leviathan tablets, but after that she left. No one ever knew why.”
Charlie came back and Dean glared at her. “Phone.” She replied with a glare of her own before retrieving her phone and leaving. The two waited for Charlie to leave before turning to the table.
“Ok.” He said to Charlie, then repeated it to himself. It was time to get ready for his next class.
“I’ll bite,” Dean said, “Why?”
"Jo, Charlie," Anna's voice came from across the kitchen. "Matron Ellen wants you guys to be out there."
This is fiction so hop off my ass for it not being realistic (please)
“Huh.” Sam said.
“We actually thought you were clueless, to be honest. But now I understand.” Sam’s face turned really angry and everyone was intrigued. They asked what had happened and Dean and Sam tensed. Even Eileen didn’t know about how the two had gotten together.
With Dad dying, Dean realized that he felt relief instead of grief, and that made him guilty. Sure, dad used to be abusive, but he was still their father. Sam had run away as soon as he became 18, with a full ride to Stanford to do Law, travelling on his own from Lawrence, Kansas. How the son of bitch did it, Dean would never know. Sam was angry that Dean hadn’t run away with him, even after he pleaded Dean to stop accepting his dad’s abuse. But Dean didn’t feel right abandoning his dad alone. Sam didn’t run away, per say, Dean had helped him unknowing to Sam. Dean knew that with the times they had shifted, and Dad always out on the brawl, Dean had to take care of Sam.
“Loki.” Cas sighed in relief as he fell into his arms, clinging and sobbing. “They’re really gone.”
“Alastair.” Dean said as he nodded. Why was Cas bringing him up?
“Anyways, get in. And change out of that horrendous costume while I try to convince Dean to not kill you two.” Cas said as Dean was moving and disrupting the dog pile above him.
Dean leaned very closely to Cas, his eyes flickering to his lips. Cas leaned in and right when their lips were going to meet, Dean jumped out of the way and fell to the bed and burrowed himself in the bedsheets. “DEAN!” Cas yelled before tackling Dean and hitting him with a pillow, while Dean laughed.
“How did you know?” Gabe asked.
“Why honey? Jealous. Remember darling you’ll always be number one.”
“Eileen. Eileen Leahy.” She extended her hand, “I could say the same about you.”
“And that’s my uncle Bobby.” Sam said walking towards the kitchen, Castiel and Eileen following him. “Hey Bobby!”
“Well. Now that you all are quiet, I suggest we go to the main room and leave the two to sort this all out.” Everyone nodded and left leaving Dean and Cas in the room alone.
“I don’t know Rach, but you don’t need him.” April said. The class then started, and Mr. Adler dragged on about something, but Sam wasn’t hearing.
“Dean – oh Dean – rub it… rub it faster, GOD YES!” Cas couldn’t believe he can feel pleasure like this. This was better than heaven.
“Wait a minute.” Sam said. There was a dialing tone now and another phone crackled.
“Guys,-“
“So, you killed him?” Cas asked.
“Come on Loki.” Kali said. “They are his friends. We had time to pack… he didn’t. And I believe they will be happy to join.”
“Dean! We need to talk! And no, we are not breaking up. Come to our room.” That dork then slid across the room, towards their room, while Dean ogled at that cute Bee PJs. He went to his room to find Cas on the bed, sitting. “Good. Ok. So. Yeah.”
“May I enter, your highness?” Dean’s head poked in.
“Meet Mary Adrianne Campbell-Moore. Born June 20th, 12:05 am.” Sam said, giving her to Dean first.
“Dean,” Castielle called running towards Dean. Dean had been laying on the grass, while Cas went to look around the garden.
“He did?”
A little cliff hanger chapter
It was the last school day of the week and the basketball game was today after school. Krissy could see Jacob and Eliot go out with each other more and send gooey eyes to one another. She loved her gang a lot except for the fact that everyone was dating everyone, and Krissy felt jealous looking at them. The plan to avoid Bel was going great. On Thursday she found Bel hang out with the gang at recess but not in lunch, so she sat with them during lunch. Today she sat with the gang at recess but not in lunch. It was an unspoken agreement between her and Bel.
grade, I had a crush on Andrea. She invited me over for a Halloween party. I was super nervous, and when I had to bob for apples, I ended up puking everywhere. Even on her.” Dean sniffed, trying to hide his laugh. “Since then I hated Halloween. Didn’t wear costumes and didn’t go trick or treating. But now I have Jess. She is the love of my life, and I thought, ‘What if I made Halloween a day I could love, with the love of my life?’ So yeah, Halloween.”
Sam and Jess didn’t care as they were looking at her. Below the pic were the words ‘Meet Cassandra.’ She was beautiful. Jess pictured Castiel striping down to her lingerie and… wow. Pregnancy was making her horny af.
Same smiled at his mate and squeezed his hand reassuringly. “Yes, we are doing this.”
The first few paragraphs are a song from the movie mentioned earlier that has been translated loosely. In this work, it's a poem written by Castiel.
“WHAT THE HELL GUYS?” Bobby yelled this time and smacked the two on the head.
“We gotta let them go on their own pace. You do know that it took them 3 months to finally tell each other they like one another. It’s a miracle they are at least sitting together and holding hands and stuff. They are not used to being vulnerable to people other than family.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Huh?”
“Seriously?” Dean asked puzzled, “I am the best man.” Sam didn’t budge. “Wow, ok. So, this is how it’s gonna be, huh?” Dean shook his head in disbelief as he went to his room. “YOUR OWN BROTHER!” Dean hollered before he slammed the door close.
The next two weeks had been hectic due to high monster activity. There had been a swarm of old monsters called Leviathans roaming in Earth. Cas had sent a mail to the Men of Letters asking if they knew anything about Leviathans and learned that acid slowed them but decapitating the Alpha Leviathan would get rid of all the Leviathans. Cas had tried to read their memories but wasn’t able to, so he ended smiting them, which slowed them down but didn’t kill them.
The four arrived at the same time and entered the shop. The shop looked really something out of a vampire movie. The walls were wrought with black vintage wallpaper, with frames of vampire-related porn posters. The shelves looked like Victorian bookshelves and had been divided into different levels of BDSM. There were signs helping people navigate. At the back was a window with red velvet curtains, and a sign that said ‘Roleplay’.
"Of course not." Ash said. "I decided we stay in my diner for the night and start tomorrow for the rescue Cas mission." Ash said, totally ignoring to further elaborate how Charlie and Gabe had raw ingredients without knowing Ash’s plan to come to diner.
“Cas?!” Jack exclaimed worriedly. He placed his hand Cas and realized what was happening. “Oh… why are you fighting it? Why are you not leaving to meet Dean?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Um… not to be rude or anything,” Sam started, “but that doesn’t explain everything.” He fiddled with the soft toy near him as he asked, “Who are you? I mean yeah, you are Castiel. But you popped out of nowhere one day, suddenly joined our school, turns out you were living there too… Who are you?”
“Belphie, come on, we’ll let her rest. It was a dramatic day for her already.” Dean tried to console Belphie.
“Huh?” Jacob pulled back confused.
“Ah yes. Well this was quick.” Donna said.
“You know what I mean. Stop deviating from it and tell me. You told me you like me, didn’t you?” Belphie visibly tensed at that.
Everyone ate, talking about yesterday and asking what Dean and Cas had done yesterday. Cas had shrugged and said they’d taken a walk in the park and had a pajama party, watching Game of Thrones. Dean nodded to that, internally blushing at what they had really done.
Castiel reached his office, Bee Mine Wedding Planners. The logo was an adorable bee, holding up a heart with the words ‘Bee Mine?’ And a ring in between. He entered the building to find Meg, Balthazar, and Gabriel sitting in front a computer and laughing.
“We have a Jack the Ripper Shapeshifter fan gone rogue in Hibbing.” Donna said. “Slit throat, intestines removed, melted flesh, the whole ni-”
“Yeah? What’s your costume?” Hunter asked, even though he knew.
Cas looked back to the chessboard confused to find him in checkmate. “Gabriel! Stop using your powers on me.” Cas pouted as he shoved Gabe.
“That’s great! And I can’t wait to meet the strippers.” Jo exclaimed, getting smacked in the head by Ellen.
“Hey.” Garth responded, as Dean raised an eyebrow at the two.
“Laurus and Gari. We had such a wonderful time. We go to know each other and how we were all similar yet different. Our housing arrangements were also different. Our children’s room, who are now in universities, were switched, our guest room was their master bedroom, and the toilets’ decoration were changed. It was different, but still had the same idea. The days we spent together was fun.”
“Save it Sammy. Like I said, I’m fine. We’re good. Now you remember to ask the school for the enrollment evidence thing. And other things you need.” Sam nodded and stewed in silence. Dean didn’t want Sam’s apology and was stubborn pretending nothing happened. And so Sam went with it. They reached school and before Sam could get out of the car, Dean said, “Heya Sammy?”
“No- “
“Woah honey! If you’re feeling frisky tonight, let me just tell you I love being in control.” Angel wiggled his eyebrows, gaining another slam to the tree. “Okay. Not frisky then.”
“MAX?”
“What about me Dean? I was there too!” Sam exclaimed. “Dean, not everything is on you. I had an equal share in his death.” Sam saw Dean flinch at the last word.
“WHAT?” Dean yelled trying to move.
“That was almost a decade ago, Dean.” Cas turned fully to Dean. “The emotions were high. Of course, you would say that. What about now?”
“Well, sunshine,” Dee said, ignoring Cas, “I am gonna go and get us some snacks, and you,” she poked at Cas’…
“Sure man. Whatever you need. You are in Lebanon, Kansas. I can show you around if you want to.” Sam said.
“Cas, come on.” Dean said but Cas shook his head.
“No, you are not.” Belphie said in a defeated tone.
“Why do you not want Belphie to know?” Both Cas and Jack couldn’t comprehend.
“Haha… yeah… Let’s not waste time then.” Dean suggested. “Lead the way, my lady.” Dean cringed but Bela didn’t mind. She dragged him towards the exhibit. As soon as he entered, he noticed something was odd. Before they could enter, Auntie Gert from before caught them.
“You know what Cas.” Dean got up from his chair. “It’s fine. You don’t have to join. I have gotten used to you always bailing on us. See you later.” Dean walked out of the café not caring what Cas was doing. He tried his best to get Cas to mingle with the group but whenever they got close, Cas suddenly went in his shell, trying to disassociate from the group. And Dean was annoyed he didn’t know why and just wanted time to cool down.
“If you had spoken more properly, I wouldn’t have had a heart attack and died at the age of 27.” Castiel muttered as he walked to his room.
“Well whatever it is, let’s go gank us a son of a bitch.” Dean said happily as he got up from the table went to his room in the bunker.
Cas replied, hearing a no from Sam.
He was also happy that their gang accepted and made Krissy feel like one of them. Adam and Alfie started playing basketball, so they could play with Krissy, and Claire and Kaia learnt martial arts from her. Jack and she had bonded over Batman previously, and they were still close. He wasn’t sure about Krissy and his relationship. They were the same as before, but the dance had eased up some awkwardness. She called him Bel, saying Belphie and Alfie were really similar, and she wanted to call him something else. Belphie didn’t understand why he felt so delighted whenever she heard her call him that but that happened. The two hadn’t outright said that they liked each other, so Belphie wasn’t sure what was happening between them.
“Dean, DEAN, SLOW DOWN” Castielle yelled as the Impala drifted into a turn. The information that no one else except the four of them were present in the universe was a level-up for Dean’s reckless driving. He was belting out Ramble On, beating the steering wheel like a drum, not on tune though, and he had the audacity to close his eyes and get mesmerized by the music. “Dean, I swear on my Father, if I die because of you, I will haunt you for the rest of my life. Different universe or not.”
“Alright then.” Cas said to Dean’s retreating figure.
“Well Charlie told us to join in an hour… And I don’t know where she lives. I hope it’s somewhere nearby.” Cas said.
“What do you mean Cas?” Dean asked. Was Cas saying what he was saying?
“Oh! Okay, I will just inform Garth, you know just for him to know. And I will get you some pie!”
“O-kay.” The dude said picking the card from Cas’ hands. He did the needful and gave the card and bag to Cas. “Have a nice day.” He said with no emotions.
“Why did he lie to me papa? Was I not a good brother?” Castiel’s heart broke hearing Belphie cry. He grabbed his keys and started towards the car.
“Krissy,” Castiel started, now rid of his makeup, “Do you think Mr. Rogers will come in search of you?”
It was September and Charlie had got Dean’s room to be shifted so that he now shared it with her, instead of cramming with the English department. Bobby and Ellen had left at the start of September, saying they had to return to the Roadhouse and Auto Salvage Yard, even though Mary hadn’t turned 6 months. Sam and Jess were busy with Mary, while Charlie and Gilda were nerding out. They did yell at Dean for forgetting them and not hanging out as much after moving in with Cas, so they had dinner at their home. Meg, Balthazar, and Gabriel were the same with Cas, so Cas told them to join dinner too. And that ultimately turned into a party with everyone singing Disney songs at the top of their lungs, making Mary giggle and roll on the floor, doing her first tummy-time. That night was awesome.
Destiel fluff :))
“Yeah!” Sam smiled. Was Dean going to address it at least now?
“No, you two go in.” Cas said. “I don’t sleep.”
“BOBBY! BOBBY!” Sam yelled running towards the shop.
“H – h – h – ha – hap – hap…” I was stopped from stammering as Dean asked.
“Wait what?” Cas backtracked and turned to Rowena, who was blushing red. “First Bobby and you too?”
Belphie couldn’t take it anymore. Sure, first he despised Clark. But after hanging out with him, he found him to be actually… kind of… good
“Robin is really embarrassing. Batman can do better without his whining.” Krissy said.
Castiel, oblivious to what had happened prior to him entering the scene, went to help Castielle from the floor. He could see how scared she was, and how she looked like she wanted to run out of there as soon as possible. He knew that look. He had that look when Dean took him to the den of iniquity. Dean had though that Cas was nervous because it was going to be his first time. But only Cas knew that he was scared of how much he wanted it. And how much he wanted to do it with Dean. It was the first time he had had thoughts like that, so, he did what he always did with his feelings. He squished it down and tried have an emotional range of an angel.
Dean was in his homeroom, as Benny, Jo, and Andrea were talking about the Ghost Ship hunt, when the speakers crackled to life.
“Are you out of your mind?” Claire shrieked, “You, not only want me to distract Belphie so that you can talk with Jack, but also want my girlfriend to be involved in this crap?”
“Jeepers!” Daphne exclaimed.
“N-No Michael.” Cas stammered. “I am about to get it-”
Castiel looked up to see Claire looking at him with hopeful eyes. The first words Castiel uttered after a period of silence was, “You know, the doctor did say that twins run in the family.”
“I am Castiel.” He said.
Cas thought of the worser things he has been through and started “I have-” but stopped as he got smacked in the head.
Hello all!! Hope everyone is doing good after 5th of November trauma. Hope this chapter helps to alleviate that stress. If not, here you go 🤗🤗🤗🤗 #virtualhugs
The gang, except for Krissy and Belphie, woke up to a scream. A little while later, someone was shaking Belphie awake.
“It’s time we tell the twins about you being their dad, and my ability to get pregnant.”
century. Reaper, real name Tessa, had been the first to establish that not all monsters were evil. There were some who wanted to live a normal life and found alternatives to satisfy their needs. She had given her word to not kill the good monsters and used her ability, Soul Absorption, to reap the evil monsters. The other Fighter, Crowley, or the King of Hell as he called himself, had joined with the evil monsters, saying he would protect them if they helped him overthrow the Reaper. Crowley had made himself the leader of the evil monsters and the good monsters had made Reaper their leader. It ultimately led to a war between Reaper and Crowley’s army. Crowley had used his ability of Charm to get the evil monsters to do what he wants, disrupt peace on Earth. Reaper had tried to talk with Crowley’s army and get them out of Crowley’s charm, but she wasn’t able to. So, she absorbed all their souls, but she knew the consequence of it. Absorbing a lot of souls at a time would lead to her imminent death with a blast of energy. She died, but taking Crowley with her, due to the energy blast. This had led to the names of their Mark’s. Reaper’s was called the Devil’s Trap, a pentagram with ancient language. King of Hell’s was called the Reaper’s Trap, a square and a diamond overlapped over each other, with ancient language at the gaps between the two intersections.
“How’s the auction preparation going Dean?” Bobby asked a beat later.
“Of course not!” Sam exclaimed. Everyone turned to him, and Dean gave him a ‘What the Hell’ look. “I mean… why call it Ghost Smiting when call it Smiting.” Sam chuckled nervously.
So, what would be the name of their relationship if Cas had a choice? Cas was able to see that he admired Dean like Sam did but at the same time not exactly like Sam. One moment, Dean’s voice would be the most soothing melody Cas had ever heard, but the next moment, filthy thoughts of Dean screaming Cas’ name would fill his mind. Butterflies fluttered whenever Dean spoke. It was indescribable. Overall, Cas believed he had an idea of what his feeling was towards Dean. Cas didn’t love Dean like he did Sam. Sam was his best friend.
“Hey Ya Boii!” “Hello Batman” Two voices answered the affirmation, instead of Charlie.
“What’s the matter Sammy?” Dean asked.
And yes, Gabe talking to Raphael (more like mocking) was something I loved writing 😆
“Tell us, Clark!” Belphie exclaimed.
“What do you mean?” Bess asked.
“Hi Batman!” Jack’s voice got Dean to the present.
“Oh… ok then… um do you mind if I eat then?” Dean asked raising his sandwich, wrapped in plastic foil.
Deanna now knew. Deanna didn't love Cas; she was in love with Cas. She tried make her feelings seen like she did always, flirting, but Castielle was Castielle. Deanna didn’t know what to do. So, Deanna did what she usually does, go hit on other dark haired, blue eyed cuties in a bar, hustle pool, and drink booze like there was no tomorrow.
Clark took a deep breath, “To tell you that I like you. Since day one, I have liked you more than a friend. Don’t you dare ask me ‘like best friends?’ I like you like Adam likes Alfie, you like nougat, heck like Belphie likes the thought of punching my face. I like you. And if you don’t like me back, I will stop. I will try to stop liking you in that way and be friends with you. Belphie was the one who told me you like the aquarium and told me take you here. If you don’t like me back in that way, can we still be friends?”
To say the least, Cas didn’t know how he was going to survive his wedding and the later 6 months.
“You are innocent and shy,” Meg said, “but when it comes to sexy times, you are kinky.” Before Cas could ask, Meg said, “You have extreme or out of the ordinary ideas for pleasure.”
Let me start by saying i am not a wedding planner, havent planned a wedding, nor have i attended a wedding. I am sorry if I have messed crap up. "Timetoplanawedding:)
Castiel had dashed to the kitchen as he heard Sonny’s footsteps reaching the hallway, he was hiding in. He heard Sonny tell the boy who would share a room with him. “Castiel!” Sonny’s voice bellowed from the hallway. Cas grabbed a piece of bread and bit a piece off as he walked towards the sound.
“Moose! Did you get all the ingredients? You should have brought them yesterday, well it’s going to take longer to get them back.”
“Just let him be.” Bobby said dismissively which annoyed Sam.
The gang got up to see what was happening. And Belphie saw it. Krissy was unconscious on the floor, with blood flowing through her nose non-stop. “KRIS!” Belphie yelled and ran towards Krissy’s unconscious body.
“What was that?” Sam asked turning to Dean. Before Dean could ask what he was talking about, Sam elaborated. “Spacing out. The wrong hand. And not to mention, your face is deep red right now. How’d you get the chain out of Lori and burn Karns?”
“Don’t worry. I had tended to a male pregnancy before, but after delivery they were taken away by corporates. Because this is rare, and corporates get consent, we can’t fight against it. I suggest we keep this a secret.” Ruth said.
“Yeah…” Cas said. “They got my head this time.”
“This can’t be happening!”
“Good on you for getting how the days work Crowley but-“
“I should be treating him like my brother, shouldn’t I? Like I do with you?” Krissy said directing it to Jack.
The kids being outside all the time gave Dean and Cas to continue their Summer of Sex exploration. Cas had bought a bondage set that restrained Dean in a ‘X’. Not only was Dean tied around the ankles and wrist, the rope went around his waist and then wrapped around Castiel’s ankle, getting Dean’s back arched. Dean’s balls were suspended in air while his member laid freely on his stomach. Whenever Cas pounded into Dean, his balls swung erratically, as his rock-hard dick bounced beautifully, getting off both Cas and Dean.
“Well you might not know this but,” Jo started, “Dean has had a crush on you forever!” She whispered.
“Hell yeah!” The two said. “We have no one here except you.” Meg added.
“He doesn’t want to talk to me about it. What do I do?”
“I was just asking Jack what was up. Chill Belphie.” Clark said. He had found Jack absolutely cute. Clark was in the year ahead of them, but English was not his thing, so he had to reattend the class. He was dreading English until he saw Jack. The boy was… wow. Then the teacher came, and though he was great, Clark’s attention didn’t waver from Jack. The way he smiled and interacted with the class was… Wow. Clark wanted, no need to know who Jack was.
“Charlie it’s been 20 years since we left school.” Cas said astonished.
“Wow,” Sam breathed out, “Jess check this out.” Jess rolled to her side and looked at Sam’s phone. It was a picture of brunette with plump lips, and sharp jaw. She did have a flat chest, but it worked with her. She was wearing a schoolgirl outfit, all small and revealing, yet managed to pose shyly. She was looking to the side, making it hard to see the eye, but it looked big.
“Hey.” Psychic returned with Gavin, not able to make him stay in the other hallway, before Hunter could curse Angel. “What’s happening?”
“That's why I gotta find him.” Kat said firmly. Hunter and Psychic looked at each other. Psychic shrugged.
Asking Castiel to join them on Wednesday and Thursday was a bust. Castiel had vanished as soon as classes got over and so Eileen and Sam thought of asking him to join during their meeting Thursday evening for lunch. Sam had asked Dean to drive him, Eileen, and Castiel back home but Dean had to stay back and help the team decorate and rehearse the auction. Bobby had offered but Sam refused, saying the three will walk back. Right now, Sam and Eileen were walking out of the school building to find Castiel waiting for them.
“Hey Dean. Sam and I were talking about having our bachelor’s party but we both want the same stripper. We have been arguing about this since the cake tasting. Sam says we could have our bachelor party at different dates but most of our guests are not from the town. They are arriving at least two days before the rehearsals and are leaving as soon as possible. As the peacemaker, tell us what to do.” Jess turned pleading eyes towards Dean.
“My name’s Haley… Haley Collins. My brother Tom had gone missing few days back during a camp trip. Ben, my other brother, and I had come here to search for him. We heard Tom’s cries for help and walked towards it.”
“Everyone, meet Tom Nook, the Grim Reaper, and this lovely little girl Emma.” Gabe introduced.
“Eileen and I could throw the trash out.” Sam said as he got up and collected the bags. Eileen did the same and they went out from the shop’s door.
Everyone returned to their room, this time Castielle joining Deanna in her room, and Castiel taking over Castielle’s room. It was a really good end today in opposite day.
Hearing the commotion, Jack, Clark, and Claire came to find Sam and Mary sitting on what used to be the Grim Reaper. Jack went to get Mary and check whether she was okay, and Clark followed him. Sam tried to get up, holding the banister nearby, but ended up tipping a flower vase nearby, getting the black paper wet.
“I wanted to take her!” She exclaimed then calmed down saying, “Well, I did have a hot make out sesh with your angel, so, yeah, call it even?”
Cas looked at Dean’s face dropping into sadness. “Shall we leave?” Cas asked to distract themselves from the topic. Dean nodded and Cas walked away.
“So you are telling me what I felt all my life was Chuck?” Dean asked frowning.
“YES!” At Eliot’s fallen face she corrected, “I mean no.” Now Eliot looked just confused. “UGH! I LIKE SOMEONE ELSE OKAY! Jacob likes you and I know you like him so I wingman-ed you two yesterday.”
“Hey, what about Belphie?”
“Jody is fine.”
“What he said.” Scooby added.
“What? Just stating the facts here
“Hiya Cassie.”
“Deanna,” he started, just to get interrupted by her.
“Ok kiddo, let’s get you ready.” Dean got up, to take Belphie to the school’s entrance, finally getting to meet their papa. But before he could get out of the room, his phone rang. It was Benny.
“It’s ok Jack, lets go out.” Charlie said, leaving Dean in her room. Dean didn’t know why but he felt angry that Jack wanted to speak with Charlie alone. What were they talking about? Why couldn’t Dean hear it? His thoughts were interrupted by Charlie opening the door. Jack wasn’t there. “Cute kid. Anyway, you have a class in 5 minutes, but we aren’t done talking. Come to my room afterschool.” Charlie finished with a secretive smile, but Dean didn’t notice it. He left to go to his class to do his work, but his thoughts were all about what Jack and Charlie had talked about.
“Sam. Calm down.” Dean said. “I know everything okay! But Cas was comforted by Loki’s presence. He told me he was the good one.” Sam was about to talk but Dean interrupted. “We know where Loki is okay! We can always go check on Cas… as Hunter and Psychic.” Dean said, wiggling his index finger between them. “Eh?” Dean asked wiggling his eyebrows and stopped when Sam responded with a bitchface.
🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅
“YES!” “FINALLY!” “WHOOOOO!” Clark, Jack, and Claire yelled. Getting Belphie and Krissy to reality.
“First of all, hey! I am not constipated in anyway. And secondly, how’d you know I like Belphie?”
“CASSIE!” Cas was woken up by Loki’s scream. “Did you sleep?!”
“Yeah. You two were busy with Tauriel’s wedding announcement. We get it.” Jack started.
Dean thought. That Sunday, Charlie and Gilda had come over to Sam and Jess’. Sam and Jess were out on a date, so Charlie and Gilda had come over. Dean told Charlie about what he had witnessed. Gilda knew everything that happened in the school because Charlie loved to talk about her ships. Charlie had told Dean about Claire and Clark’s relationship, but she herself didn’t know the relationship between Claire and Jack. Talking about them led to talking about Charlie’s ships.
“What is going on?” Belphie’s voice came from the hallway, in front of a really exhausted Krissy rubbing her eyes.
It took a little more time for the two to get Cas’ costume on. Hunter flustered whenever he touched or saw Cas’ bare skin, while Cas blushed whenever Hunter looked at him. “I don’t know how to wear a wig or eyeliner…”
“Really moose, a summoning spell?”
“Fine.” Angel pouted and did as he was told.
Esiasch – Brother
Hunter remembered how Sam told him Cas maybe homeless, and he wanted to know whether it was true. “I’ll walk with you to your home.”
“Who are you?” Gabe asked as he carried his love in his hands, bridal style, and followed her to a vehicle with wheels.
“What?” Loki asked shocked.
“Why?” Jo asked.
“My time with Deanna was really wonderful, I won’t deny that. She was everything you are, with slight differences, but she was still you. I knew that at the end, when it comes down to it, she and I wouldn’t be together. She harbored feelings for her Cas, and I did for you. But it felt nice. Nice to be wanted by you. Even if it wasn’t really you.” Castiel ended, looking at Dean with a wistful smile. “I am sorry if I crossed the limit.” He said, taking one last look of Dean, then walked away.
I excitedly ran out of my house, with my usual gear. I slid into Baby, my dad’s Impala (now mine as I turned 16) and took off for school. I parked my car in the parking lot – not before showing it off to Bobby and others - and walked into the building, all happy and excited. I ignored everyone’s ‘Hi’s as I ran through the hallway, trying to find my classroom. As soon as I found it, I dashed in, only to be attacked by my moose of a brother Sam, and Gabriel, and Charlie.
“You guys were out trick or treating so I didn’t bother letting you guys know, seeing you two have gone through this hunt many times. He told you to call for him by telling his name, so I tried, and it worked.” Bobby said, then rubbed his face as he frantically tried to say, “I swear I didn’t think this would happen.”
“It’s fine Dean.” Sam said. “You sleep. I’ll report to Bobby. Okay?” Dean didn’t reply, as he got into his bed. Sam gave one last look before closing the door and going to the main room.
“Weirder than what papa, Meg, Balthazar, and Gabe? It’s ok dad. Tell us!” Belphie said.
Dean took a deep sigh and put on a fake smile, “I’m fine Sam. I’ll go sleep, now.” Dean said then went to his room. Sam could see defeat in Dean’s walk. He hated it.
“Do it once more please?” Dean laughed as he asked. Cas smiled at Dean’s laughter and repeated the motion. Anything to hear Dean laugh again. Dean burst into another round of laughter, and Cas joined, silently laughing as he enjoyed the moment, enjoyed the way Dean threw his head back, the way his eyes crinkled, and his lips stretching, showing those bright white teeth.
“WHAT?” Bobby came to his room running and panting. Sam followed.
“Nothing!” The brothers replied and moved away. Dean caressed Cas’ thighs while doing that, but getting no reaction from him, yet again. Before anyone could say anything, the bell rang, notifying the end of lunch.
“What are you two doing?” Castiel asked.
Dean smiled at that and wiped his eyes before giving the picture to Sam and hugging Lisa and Ben. “Thank you.”
They wanted to call him papa, but that would be confusing. So, they thought of different words that could be used. They would have settled on Daddy if Clark didn’t ruin it (don’t ask them how.) So, they settled with Dad. There wasn’t a right time for them to casually use it instead of forcing it, but now they had done it, and they weren’t going to take it back. They definitely didn’t regret it. Not one bit.
“She is in the hospital. Usually takes 48 hours for the delivery, but Jess’ cervix has dilated enough that the doctor thinks she will be ready to deliver in 24 hours.”
“Sorry to interrupt, I don’t mean to be rude, but I think the photos of Claire we saw first were supposed to be here, inside the book. That means we will find more news excerpts in the box. Do you want to read them?”
“6:30 am.” Dean replied.
“WE REQUIRE STATUS REPORT! NOW!” Charlie bellowed, making Mary ooh and Krissy laugh even more.
“Dude really?” Dean asked through wheezes. “You are scared of your girlfriends?”
“Well that was a bust.” Bela muttered.
“Thank you, Rowena, for your help.” Gabe said. “I’ll take my leave now.”
“Yeah… Sure…” Dean said, his eyes on Sam, Eileen, and Cas, who were frantically signing to one another.
“About what?” Angel asked.
“It was better than perfect, Dean.”
“I will get my things this night.” Cas said and they agreed. The rest of the day was spent with Gabe telling him what had happened and that he was in a different year from his birth year. Cas was shocked to realize they were from the 19
“Is that… Angel?” Psychic asked from behind Hunter.
It was the fourth week of school, end of the month, and Sam and Dean’s last four days of the week were really busy. On Tuesday, Dean had informed the gang in lunch that the football team was auctioning themselves to gain funds for the football team. The gang had agreed to join and see the football team make a fool of themselves.
Dean got up as the teacher called him. “Um Cher,” Benny said as he went to get his guitar, “Fan request. Falling in Love by Elvis. Please.”
“Tauriel!” The twins bellowed. “Oh, it’s on speaker and there are kids here. Mind sharing us the story?” Balthazar’s voice crackled, subtly informing to censor the story.
“Thank you.” Dean said to Eileen as he arranged it. He could see Garth and Bess fluffing the pillows up, while Benny got a blanket from… somewhere.
“3 years coming this new year’s… wow.” Garth said. They were all sobered up now, a little thanks to Cas, and Sam and Eileen had just finished their recount.
“We will be.” Andrea said, hugging Lucas, and stepping away from Jake. “Thank you. Thank you for your help.” She nodded.
“Yo Tauriel, how you doin?” Belphie hollered as he opened the door.
“What if he says ok because he doesn’t want me to feel bad? He gave me you guys, friends, school, and an awesome life. What if says ok just to make me included?” Krissy questioned.
“Clarence you are here!” Meg took the bags from him, “Go sit on the chair. Gabe and Balthy have a business idea to pitch.”
“Yeah… So that means I did this for nothing?” Cas asked, now his voice clear, meaning he was out of the restroom.
“15 dollars!” Garth was interrupted the voice that sounded so much like his ex-Lisa Braeden. It was an amicable breakup, so Dean didn’t mind.
That got Jack to frown in confusion. “Sorry?”
“Nothing wrong…” Charlie trailed off before hesitantly saying. “Um… Cas is here.”
“Where is he anyway?” Eileen asked Sam.
“Hiya Cassie.”
“A monster that scavenges on-”
A man had come behind Jack, shocking Claire. He looked like her Dad. Really similar, but her dad was dead. “Hey little girl, what is your name?” He asked, and Claire started crying. It wasn’t her dad. She remembered her dad’s high pitch voice. She hugged the man and sobbed, and he wrapped his arms around her hesitantly, patting her back.
“Shut up boy.” Bobby grumbled. “We were just talking about you. Cas just dialed your number…”
Meg and Balthazar had identical Marks but differed in positioning. Meg had hers below her right ear, on the neck, while Zar’s was on the left. It was a beautiful entanglement of lines that resembled a stick figure with wings and an upside-down heart. Rowena said it looked like a Guardian Angel Celtic knot, and so the called themselves the Guardians, and the Mark was called the Guardian Knot. Mary had her tiny Mark a little above the left chest, and below the collar bone. It was a cross with two curly line flowing down like hair, forming a M. Mary was too young to name herself, given that she couldn’t even talk, and so the Mark had no name.
“Hey Eliot!” Krissy called Eliot, as she was sitting with Jacob. She was telling Jacob about the misunderstanding and getting a ‘told you so’ from him. They were bickering with each other when Krissy saw Eliot. “Come here!” She waved Eliot towards them.
“Sam, do you have anyone to call?” Sam nodded, getting his phone out. “Rachel, thank you so much for your help. Ah! Balth that was quick.” Meg said, as Balth came running towards the car.
“Ok, but if you break his heart, Belphie and I are gonna massacre your ass.” The girl, Claire, walked away.
“I too wanted to kiss you. I was going to after the basketball game.” Belphie blushed as he admitted.
“Freak?” Cas asked.
“Hello Jody.”
“Guys-”
“Mildred.” She smiled brightly getting Hunter uncomfortable.
“They are right there!” The man said pointing to the stand. He got up and searched the stand, then realized that the newspapers were not there. “Oh. Maybe they are outside.” The man walked out but Cas stopped him.
“I will tell you all later, please. Just leave.” Cas pleaded.
“You know me. Come,” Cas said as he kissed Dean, “Save me knight.” He winked.
“nO, we have to get ready Cas. I cant believe we are so late, quick help me find somethi-“ Deanna was interrupted the best way possible, by Cas’ lips. After a while, Cas pulled back.
“Who are you?” The awake man asked, raising his weapons and covering the fallen man.
“IT’S THE RULES. When will Cas and Deanna come back. I have stooped so low that I am playing Go Fish with a demon.” Sam complained.
“I am not that big fan of the ‘Lemon Fever’ theme. It complements summer really well, but it doesn’t show… us.” Jess said.
“Yeah. Thanks.” Gavin said, kicking the bike into life.
Everyone saw the man and gasped. Dean, Eileen, and Jo followed her lead gasping, while Cas looked confused. The werewolves and vampires moved into the store more consoling the startled customers, and Sam just stood in the corner, smiling at the scene that was happening before him.
“Well done troop. We shall not yet share this approach with our men as there could be a power-hungry moron amidst us. I trust each and every one of you in the room to keep our discussions for today a secret. Understood?” Charlie addressed the group. The group nodded their agreement. “Great. Now who wants pizza?”
“This is the first time I have ever felt to bang a dude so hard.” Charlie whispered, getting nudged in the ribs by Gilda.
“You guys ready to leave?” Cas asked wiping his hands down his apron and transforming into Angel. Others had left already and only the three were left now.
“That’s kinda stalkerish, dude.” Dean commented.
“Ok, ahem, yeah ok,” Dean started trying to clear his throat, trying to rid himself from emotions, but failing to do so, “Ahem, well it was good progress for today. I… School starts tomorrow. I’ll… ahem… I’ll go get things done. Yeah. Ok, I’m going to my room.” Dean said, getting up, hugging the two, and returning to his room.
“Awesome! Let’s do this.” Jo slapped Garth’s back as she took on the lead. The others followed but crashed into her when she stopped abruptly.
“Strippers? What about strippers?”
“I have the whole collection of your poetry. Or should I say of Jimmy Novak’s?” Dean smirked as Cas looked at him with a dumbfounded expression.
“Kelly and Nick were dating?”
“The mine… We will save them but Haley.” Psychic turned to her. “Please, at any costs, stay with us. Even if you hear your brothers scream, stay with us.” Psychic then went through his bag, getting out a flame-thrower. “Here… have this. Do you have a lighter?”
They’d gotten themselves out of their pants and jerked each other off, making out sloppy and dirty. Mid make out, Dean and Cas had stripped each other off, Dean playing with Cas’ clit while Cas fingered Dean’s hole, rubbing his prostate. Their moans were swallowed by each other’s lips. Cas suddenly shifted the two, making Dean straddle him. Dean fingered himself a little while, restraining Cas’s hands, looking at him straight in the eye. He then maneuvered to get himself full of Cas. Dean rode Cas happily, losing his hold on Cas due to the pleasure. Cas had taken the opportunity to carry Dean, whose hand moved to Cas’ hair on their own, and snap his hips hard and fast like the pizza man.
Dean tried to push Cas away from him, as he felt his tears fall more. But Cas stood his ground and stared at Dean with tears running down his face like a river. Dean closed Cas’ eyes with his hands, not wanting Cas to see him cry, but Cas crying made his hands wet. Dean moved forward and enveloped Cas in a bear hug, Cas letting out heart-wrenching sobs. Dean tried to control himself. He knew he would be wailing if he wasn’t closing his lips tightly. But Cas didn’t care. He was sniffling and moving closer to Dean, trying to bury himself in Dean’s chest.
“What does that mean?” Sam turned to him and found Bobby standing with a guilty look. “Bobby?”
“Fine. I told him about the case. How you two always forgot why you had gone there. I gave him the location and he disappeared for a minute before reappearing saying he figured out what the case was and how to solve it.” Bobby said.
Before he could finish the thought, a light focused on the doors of Gabe and Balth’s room, which opened to reveal the two in costumes. Gabe was wearing a slutty angel costume, and Balth was wearing a slutty devil costume. Looking closely, Castiel could see that it was his sons’ normal Halloween costumes. Jack had been an angel, while Belphie was the devil. The size made it slutty for the two adults.
Bela had come and talked to Dean, making sure he was ready for the Sea Pines Museum party. Dean rolled his eyes and replied with a curt yes and left her. That’s when he realized that he hadn’t talked to Sam about who the kid with the bedhead and stunning blue eyes were. He tried to remember to ask Sam later, but forgot as school went.
“I am going to my room now.” Sam said.
“Bel… Bel… He…” Krissy started only to be overtaken by sobs. Dean looked to Charlie, and Charlie understood. She left the two in the room and went out. Dean pulled back from their hug and made Krissy sit in the couch.
“Um…” Sam started but the rumble of Impala distracted Dean.
“Don’t you dare lie to me Bel. Tell the truth right now. You like me, don’t you? I know you do but tell me. Tell me that you like me.”
“Banshee. I know. I was there yesterday when Harold was attacked. I came out of my room when I heard him yell from inside of his suite, ‘Get it out of my head’ so I knocked on the door and called to him. Harold never locked his room, so I opened and saw it. A black figure, perched on top of him, reaching for his head when it suddenly vanished. More like dissolved. But nobody believed me. Telling me I was cuckoo.”
“Should I… not smile?” Cas frowned confused.
“You didn’t share it with me!” Charlie let out in mock outrage.
"Please?" The guy added at the tone. Ellen released her hold on the man, before staring at him, who was trying his level best to avoid her eyes.
“I have to get going.” Dean said as he walked towards the stage, waving his hand as they wished him good luck. Right before he went backstage, he found a familiar green sweater and dark bedhead enter the auditorium. Before he could get a good look, he heard Benny yell his name out. “I’m here! Jeez.” Dean said as he entered the makeshift backstage. The auction was going great. Cole had gotten a date for 25 dollars with a chick named Loretta. A fancy Italian exchange student that many guys and girls had their eyes on. Victor had gotten a date for 30 dollars with the shy kid Nancy who everyone adored. She was a sweet little thing and Victor had been crushing on her for a long time. Benny had gotten a date for 40 dollars with his sweetheart Andrea, who wasn’t willing to share him with anyone else. Everyone laughed at the bid war that happened between Andrea and Jo.
Thank you for reading. This was just made from the scraps CW gave us, and I hope y’all enjoyed it 😊
“But is it okay if I- I… um see?” Cas asked looking everywhere except the two.
“Yeah, lets watch Horror.” Cas replied, wondering if he could get a repeat of what happened with him and Deanna, but now with the real deal.
“Angel is alive?” Bobby asked but Sam’s yelling drowned it out.
It was around the last week of June when it happened. Cas was trying to get some snacks for their daily movie watching when Dean entered the kitchen.
“You know how everyone says Nick is someone you should stay away from? He isn’t. He is just misunderstood.” Kelly said. “The town heard a rumor of how he had left his father and had rebelliously stood up against his morals. But actually, his father had tried to make ties with the wrong crowd, and he wasn’t up for it. Long story short, his father kicked him out for not doing as he was told.” Cas replied with a simple ‘oh’. He had never cared for the people’s gossips. He lived in his own world, trying to get money, and get ready for his life. “Anyway, I called for a totally different reason.”
“Dean, no. We have other issues right now, like going back to our universe and working out-“
“FINE! I can’t even have my Tyra Banks moment. Ok, talk with him, like you did yesterday. Then by the end of the day, I should get the info that you kissed him. Or else I will kick your ass and-”
Leviathans!!!
“I don’t understand what’s so special about that song.” Charlie grumbled as she slid into the chair near Dean. “He’s been asking you repeatedly, so many times, to sing that song, right? Why don’t you just sing it bitch.” She shoved Dean’s hand.
“Hey, if it feels too easy, you’ve done it wrong. It’s a Fighter’s motto honey.” Angel said as he tapped Hunter's nose and circled Hunter, making him a little flustered.
“Not any Fighter.” Bobby said and Sam and Dean looked at each other confused.
“Step back.” Jody warned Loki who lifted his hands up.
“What?” The twins asked confused.
Dean had locked himself in the room, to avoid getting questioned by his family. He chose the same green Henley he had worn for the talk, but with ripped jeans. It was 1 when he left his room. The house was eerily quiet. He looked around the house to find no one in.
“Oh yeah! That’s what dad told you.” At Sam’s confused and curious face Dean added, “I was in a boys’ home to help young men avoid jail.” He ignored everyone’s ‘what’ and continued. “Sammy was sick one day, and I had cooked dinner, and went to buy some medicine for him. I came back to find dad drunk off his ass, with dinner empty. So, I had went to get some dinner for Sammy.” He avoided the part where dad yelled and beat him, making him run away. Dad already had a bad name amongst them, he didn’t want to corrupt it more. “I had spent the money we had on medicines, so I tried to steal food, but got caught by a cop. Judge wasn’t available, the Deputy said I was too young for County, and when dad called and found out what had happened, he…” Dean didn’t know whether to tell them what dad had said.
Today was the day of the wedding. The arrival to the beach was to be done at 12pm, giving everyone ample time to get ready. Everything was set ready. Castiel didn’t have to come because the other three had everything under control. It was at one when the Balthazar addressed the group.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas, meanwhile, took something out of the schoolbag and gave it to Dean. It was Cas’ school uniform. Especially the one Dean had messed up with ink after their first kiss. Dean brought the shirt to his nose and took a deep breath in and smiled when he smelt Cas in it. Watermelon and cinnamon.
“Ok, ok. Just start with his eyes. Like ‘Hey, your brown eyes remind me of the forest. Can I walk in them for the rest of my life?’”
Cas loved gardening, and Dean loved watching Cas garden. The whole of August was also spent trying to set up a garden. The kids enjoyed gardening too. The 5 spent Saturday and Sunday gardening, planting seeds, and watering. Whenever Cas bent to set flowerpots down, Dean couldn’t resist his urge to slap Cas’ ass, basking in the yelp and glare Cas sent his way. It was after a week when Dean was about to slap Cas’ ass, when he was blocked. By Cas giving him a ‘low-five.’ The two stood there staring at each other, Cas glaring and Dean astonished. It was only when Krissy started laughing that the two broke off the staring and joined her too. And that began the friendship between Krissy and Dean.
“As always.” Psychic answered as Hunter placed his left hand on Psychic’s shoulder. Psychic was able to find the lady who was drowning, pour salt down her throat and stop the drowning. Hunter, by that time secured the premises with salt and got rid of the ghost. “Can you tell us what happened?” Psychic asked and the lady said how she had seen a ship near the harbor during her jog and when she came back to take a shower, the ghost had placed it’s hand on her head, causing her to feel like she was drowning. “Thank you. And don’t clean the salt lines. Please don’t leave the house until we come back to give a clear.” Psychic said before Hunter teleported them back home. It was almost dinner time when the two reached. Bobby informed them how he’s close to getting a location. He asked the two to go sleep after their report, reminding Dean about his date tomorrow. Dean groaned and returned to his room, so did Sam. The fight was really tiring.
“We gotta leave. It’s time. Come on.” Dean interrupted as he got up and left. “Bye Bobby.”
Ellen chuckled and nodded. “Yes. Well he is back-”
“ADAM! I swear to Satan. It’s just an idea. You think of something similar.”
“Yes.” Dean said. “And Jack and Belphie are our sons.” Cas added.
“Imma go christen Bad Boy with today’s dinner, Burgers.” Dean ended in a dramatic flair.
Dean covered his mouth with his hands and giggled, as Cas turned on the call. Cas mouthed ‘quiet’ before turning the call into speaker. “Yes Sam?”
I want cake :(
“Sam Campbell. Sammy?” Cas asked getting a nod from Dean. “What happened to Winchester?”
Krissy and Belphie had gone (more like sneaked) on the rides together, and learnt about each other, finding they loved gore and macabre genres. She had asked why he wore that sunglass, for which he shrugged. Even when they went on rides, he wore, not cooperating with the people. She had a suspicion that they were glued to his face.
Dean liked Cas a lot. He was his best friend, in forever. Sure, he had friends, but Cas was something else. When Dean lost Sam and Dad, Cas was there. Sure, he left to heaven and shit, but Dean had a sense that Cas was always with him. Even when he was with Lisa, he checked the windows before closing the curtains, not only to check for the evil sons of bitches that lurk around, but also for Cas. He was out there somewhere.
Cas supervised, walking 12 minutes back and forth between the Museum and the statue. Being a semi-known travel-photographer, the museum was more than happy to let Cas and his students work. He had helped a student to get the focus right on the camera – more like pulled him back by the hair, wondering how one could be stupid to place the camera 1 millimeter away from their targeted object. Another student was just lazy to not crouch down and get the beautiful shot of the statue. He rather enjoyed bending a little, resting his hand on his knee, and lethargically taking pictures. Cas got him the kid to kneel and get the photo – more like pressed his shoulders and kneed his shin, getting the kid to lose balance and fall to the ground.
“I had a vision of how the Shadow Orc’s have strategized to surround us. I require the assistance of our map.”
Rowena stared at Clarissa stunned. “Come on.” She walked towards her, “get up. Let’s go find that book.” She gave her hand, which Rowena accepted. Reaching the Men of Letter’s rooming, Rowena entered the main room, while Clarissa went inside, to finish her journal report on what had happened. A flash of purple light distracted Clarissa and she turned to the door, as Rowena said a spell. The door opened and Rowena and Kevin came into vision. “You good?” Clarissa asked.
“You can buy some.” Eileen suggested.
Castiel suggested that instead of buying a whole mermaid costume, they could buy a black high waisted mermaid skirt and wear it on top of the lingerie, making it reach till the lining that run through the middle of the lingerie. Balth had said that even if the skirt wasn’t Velcro, Castiel could strip out of it slowly, enticing the audience, which made Castiel blush deep red. With this decided, Meg said she will buy one on their way to the office, along with some contact lenses to make Gabe and Castiel’s eyes look merpeople-ish.
“I am now back in Warrior in training, in order to control my werewolf abilities.” Garth said. “And I joined recently, with Garth.” Bess added.
“What took you guys so long?” Gabe asked.
“Hello Dean.”
“Da—Da!” She squealed and fell to the floor giggling.
“Are we telling this to others?” Jess asked.
“But?” Meg asked, sensing a but coming.
“I promise I don’t know anything.” Gabe said. “I just came back from my vacation this morning.”
“You guys kissed!” Garth squealed and Jo, Charlie, and Eileen joined.
“Cas, are you ready?” Jess asked. “I can see her head.”
“WHAT?!” Charlie, Jo, and Gilda exclaimed.
“Psychic!! The doors aren’t opening!” Psychic heard Hunter yell.
“Charlie and Jo were talking about naked making out and I was wondering how to do it.”
“Have fun, bitches.” Charlie said as she returned to dancing with Jo. Cas looked to a blushing Dean, before shrugging and continuing to dance. The party ended much later, and everyone started to leave, tired and ready to sleep. “Dean. Drop me at my home.” Charlie said.
Grace had a pair of green-blue sectoral heterochromia; the left with small green sector and blue dominant, while the right was the opposite. She shared her hair color with her brothers. While from the far it looked dark brown, from near each strand differed from black to blonde. The three shared almost similar features, which was cute.
The class talked with each other, in groups and in pairs, but Dean and Cas never got a chance to talk with each other. Sam, Gabe, and Charlie noticed the longing looks shared between the two but pretended to not see as they didn’t know what they could do. Sam didn’t want to accept it but the way they looked at each other was mixed with heat, desire, and loneliness… he was scared of what was going to happen.
“Is it Alex?”
We are coming back to Terra!!!
Before Krissy could answer, Cas came in with Belphie. “Dean. Jack and I need you to take us somewhere. Come.” The two left the room, leaving Belphie and Krissy alone.
Dean grabbed the washcloth on the dishwasher and wrapped it around Cas. “Now you’re super angry!” He beamed, and the twins couldn’t resist the laughter that fell. Dean looked to the twins proudly, as Cas glare softened, hearing the two laugh.
“Watch your fucking language!” The lady replied, sounding like-
Deanna was staring at Castielle with unshed tears in her eyes. Castielle had just confessed to her that she loved her. The love of her life loved her back. She was elated. And a little angry because who the FUCK told Cas that she didn’t deserve her love. She knew what she had to do. Prove that Cas deserved to be loved, and she was going to do it now.
“PILLOW FIGHT!” Belphie bellowed as he ran towards Jack and smacking him on the head with a pillow.
“Stop messing around Auntie Jo!” Jack cried. “Tell us if it’s a boy or girl. At least you two?” Jack addressed Charlie and Gabe who acted innocently. Knowing the three were not gonna say anything, Jack turned to Uncle Sam. “Can you tell us?”
“Well they might have lied.” Sarah said smiling fakely before she let out. “Okay. We had sold the original in an auction before, but we have fakes stocked behind. My dad, the owner of the auction house part of this museum, does this. To gain more money.” She said. “Please don’t tell anyone.”
“Yeah… I understand if you don’t want to be with them. I will not tell them abou-”
“You mean how’d the fight go. Angel was already there in the Hand of Glory exhibit. Turns out it was a fake.” Dean said.
Dean smiled at Cas before nodding at Gabe and getting up. Cas eagerly waited for Dean to get his guitar and get to the front of the classroom to sing Cas’ favorite song. Dean strummed his guitar for a while, before he sang.
.” Cas said silently, his pleading eyes directed at Loki.
“You two can squabble later.” Bobby said. “According to this, the painting is Portrait of Isaiah Merchant's family, painted 1910. Comparing the name of the owner of the painting with the victims of the Fights that took place, died the same month they bought the painting.”
“Why?”
“Oh I,” Cas blushed deeper red, “I’m uh… I’m going out today. For Halloween.” Cas said.
week when Cas felt someone was calling him. He went towards that source to find a posh man standing in dress robes. He had given Cas a pair of dress robes and told him to enter the room after changing. Cas changed and went in, following the man. He was awed by the gala that was happening, the grand chandelier, staircase, and most importantly the dance hall. Cas has never danced but he has read about it. The man in front of him kept on walking and Cas ran behind him. They walked through the kitchen and to into a room.
“Castiel…” The man in suit said stretching his hand towards him. “Richard… Richard Roman. But you may call me Dick.”
Jack and Belphie went out to the main office to find a woman in short plaid skirt, long stockings, and crop top. Her eyes were blue, her hair brunette, her jaw really sharp, and overall, just beautiful.
“I can’t understand how he turned me down. I mean I was open my intentions. I asked him whether he worked out, felt his biceps, but Castiel was not responding. He said he had work to do and left. I don’t understand?” Rachel said.
Castiel reached the junction and dropped the kids. “Have a nice day, and year.” Castiel said to his sons, to get two beaming faces replying a ‘Thanks Papa’ in chorus. Castiel rode off to his office, looking at the twins walk towards their school through his rear mirror view. He loved his sons, but he wished they grew up with their other parent too. Castiel became a papa when he was 17.
“Caaaas! Ugh fast.”
“They are soo cute!” Charlie shrieked. “Come we have to leave ASAP if you wanna get ready and reach Pamela’s by five.” Dean nodded and left to get his stuff from the office. From his window, he was able to see Jack, Belphie, Clark, Adam, Alfie, Claire, and Kaia go towards a car that had just arrived. He had a bad view of the parking lot because the trees obscured his view. He was able to see a short man get out of the car,
Now, as a human, Castiel finds his past self to be oh-so wrong. Exploring his feelings as a human, and having gained knowledge in the field of sex, Castiel has finally understood what his feelings are. His feelings for Meg, though was filled with shame, was nice. She was beautiful lady who cared for him a lot. As an angel, she was a demon – a filthy abomination – for whom he had feelings, and that disgusted him because A. he was an angel therefore NO FEELINGS, and B. she was the enemy and no one should FRATERNIZE WITH ENEMY. Crowley, yes, he worked with, but for his own advantage, but Meg, he could now admit that it was somewhat for selfish reasons, and not completely based off ‘saving the world’. He doesn’t know whether his feelings were mutual. He is yet to understand how humans know that someone is interested in them. With April, it was different. She was trying to gain his favor, later to torture him and kill him for information. And also, she kissed him first. That was an obvious sign. Overall, Castiel is yet to master how one knows that someone is interested in them.
Maria Hill and Black Widow made silly faces at the kid, the werewolves tickled the baby with their furry ears, and the vampires let the baby play with their fangs. Captain America and Iron Man had done a civil war fight in slow motion, which made the baby laugh. They all turned to Cas, and he looked at everyone no knowing what to do.
Sam signed to Eileen who nodded in relief.
“Okay.” Kali nodded. “But let’s be quick. Before your brothers come back.” She shouldered her bag full of money and clothes she had been saving.
Sam, Dean, and Cas had wanted to reveal themselves to their friends, but Bobby said there were enough people who knew about them and if they revealed themselves again, it might give leverage for monsters. Sam and Dean had learnt from Bobby that their mom was an exceptional Warrior and had retired after marrying their dad. The two had read their mom’s profile from the Men of Letters reports. Bobby told them how she was to become a Women of Letter but she had stepped back as John didn’t know that Mary worked for the community. Sam and Dean were happy to know that Mary was a Warrior, and that motivated them to do better in the field.
“Well, that’s a shame. Seeing the fear in those bright blue yes would have been a sight for sore eyes. Anyways, I’ll get the pliers. And you can get the knife.” Mrs. Carrigan, Madge said as she left. “We are going to be having a healthy dinner today honey!”
“Honey,” Angel started, “It’s the only way.”
“WE YIELD! Sir Fitzgerald has beheaded our leader. We surrender to the queen of Moondor, and the Followers of Moon.”
“Oh.” Cas said. “Well, thank you for your help. Much appreciated.” Cas bowed stiffly then moved to the stand. He saw that the stand can revolve and pushed it. Intriguing. He pushed it again and again, giggling at how the stand spun around.
“Gabe, they would look right through me.”
“And then,” Jack gasped trying to regain his breath, “and then when I told him he loves crisps, he yelled I HATE CRISPS and told us to leave him alone!” Jack ended crying on the floor, while Belphie assaulted him, telling to shut up. Cas had tried to break the fight while Dean looked at Krissy with a ‘told you’ look. Krissy stuck her tongue out but was actually relieved to know that Bel didn’t yell out to the world that he hated her.
“You know,” Cas did the same as before, “you are a dad too.” Dean smiled fondly at that.
Since his birth, Cas had stayed in the basement, reading. No one talked with him, except Gabe. He had spent time with mom during the pregnancy and could see that mom definitely had a connection with Cas. The abuse started 2 weeks after mom’s death. Gabe had brought Cas food the first two weeks, but then Dad started getting food for only for 4 and not 5. He forced Gabriel to eat all his food, and not leave any. All Cas’ clothes were the three’s old clothes. They made Cas do the journal entries, that were to be sent to the Men of Letters, go out for night watch, and do house chores, many more. Cas had been confused at first, not understanding why his family didn’t talk with him like they talked with each other when he was in his mom. And two weeks later, when his dad had come talked with him, he understood. They hated him. Except Gabe, no one really loved him.
“I’ll just clean then.” Bobby muttered to himself. “Morons.”
The next day was annoying to say the least. Sam and Dean had entered school to find everyone talking about the fight that happened last night.
“I don’t know how Gilda puts up with you. Bless her kind soul.” Dean chuckled when Charlie slapped his arm.
Dean was chanting Cas’ name as his hands went to free Cas from his pants. Cas tugged at Dean’s t-shirt, interrupting him from his task. Dean got up to get rid of his t-shirt, only to be pushed back down by Cas, after the t-shirt was thrown to the side. Cas kneeled over Dean and caught his chin. He bent down to give a wet, dirty kiss before pulling back. He released Dean’s chin from his grip but maintained eye contact as he slowly got rid of his pants.
“I don’t think that’s going to work. There’s something in here. It doesn’t want us to leave.”

Dean was standing in front of his closet mirror, checking whether his green Henley and grey jeans, the ones that resembled his clothes he had worn for Cas and his’ first date, would be ok. Last night, he rode as fast he could, with Mary in the back babbling, and Jo asking questions which he ignored. As he reached home, he ran to his room to find the digital student information binder, ignoring Jo’s yelling, and Bobby and Ellen’s insistent ‘what’s, woken up by the former. Sam and Jess would be coming home tomorrow so he had only 3 people’s questioning to ignore.
“Nice. Venue?”
“Dude!!!! What are you doing?” Jacob hissed as he started combing his hair with his hands, messing it up.
"Nothing." Cas said, getting two confused faces. "They usually just restrain me and leave me alone, except taunt me for some entertainment. I have been blacked out many times now. But it’s because I resisted so unless we don’t resist, they don’t do anything."
Fast yet sweet development :)
“More like fight. Come. We are writing the report. I’ll tell you everything.” Dean said and the three went to the Research Lair.

Loki closed his eyes and thought about drainage clogs full of hair, or rotten food as he left the house, getting himself composed. He took a deep breath and left. He was all ready for Halloween. He had got his costume, Loki Odinson from Avengers. He had made his own spear and Tesseract from candy and had stored them in the store’s fridge. This whole month was going to be hectic with everyone wanting to buy candies for Halloween, and this time he had decided to have the store open during Halloween, to attract kids, who would guilt their parents into buying more candies for them. Thus, he had to make more amount than usual, to stock up the candy supply.
“That is him, the same guy from last time. And the twins entered happily. Maybe it was just your mind playing games with you.”
“Well you get it out of your mind, feel yourself get better, and at the end forget you ever told me about it. Helps your mind and doesn’t damage your ‘I don’t have chick flick moments’ ego deal… Don’t worry. It takes you a few minutes to loosen up then spill it out to me. Until then, tell me what that thing is.” Angel said, as he got off the swing and walked towards the thing he was talking about.
After the kiss Cas had told Dean that he likes him too. The next few weeks the two being sappy as hell. Sonny got to know about the two but didn’t care. He just told the two to be safe. Dean and Cas both got to know they were each other’s first kiss and that made them kiss more. Dean learnt that Cas didn’t see any movie because he spent all his free time finding jobs and collecting money to pay Sonny, even after his consistent refusal.
“It doesn’t make me any less of a man.” Loki defended.
“Dean! I forgot to give you the landline voicemail key to use.” Sam said as he opened the door.
Dean stood in the threshold between the kitchen and the main room as Bobby walked up the stairs.
After a round of goodbyes, they hung up the call. Before Cas could set his phone down, a notification popped up saying he was added to a group. Hannah side-eyed Cas as he perked up.
“Let it – fuck – let it out Dean. Me too, ah fuck. Rub harde – OH LIKE THAT YES!”
What the ACTUAL fuck was happening here? Yesterday, they were almost cuddling during dinner, and today they are calling each other sweet nicknames. And first of, he was the one who came up with Cas. Not
“Of course, we do! I will get her to join me and put on a show for you. Anything else?”
“I didn’t hear anything about that. Do you know anything about it?” Adam asked the twins.
“Well male recounts talk about the height… female recounts more about the hair and… physique.” Gavin informed, as he dramatically flexed his muscles.
“Yeah. She doesn’t have one, but she said she can find a karaoke app and use her projector to project the lyrics.”
She turned to find Psychic and said, “Hello Psychic.”
“Thanks angel.” Meg said, kissing his cheek. Cas smiled at her then turned to give Zar his blanket. Before he could get himself a chair, Zar pulled him down to sit on the cot.
“But it was bad that we had to know you two were engaged today during breakfast when the light reflected from your rings.” Belphie complained.
After the movie, they had gone to get some dinner in the diner nearby.
“FUCKING FINALLY!” “Deanna!” Both Deanna and Castielle exclaimed from their hiding. They returned to their beds, as did Dean and Cas.
“Not it!” Sam yelled and hung up the phone.
“Assbutt?”
Bobby walked to the car and opened the back door to find a familiar face. “Castiel?” He called as he moved in. “Boy get up.” Bobby said as he shook Cas’ face, slapping it to wake him up. “Goddammit.” Bobby tried pressing his chest, but the space was too confining. Dean had just lost Angel, and if something wrong went with Cas, Bobby was sure Dean would lose it and… Bobby didn’t want to think about it. He was getting better due to the party and the kids. The kids! Bobby contemplated whether to get the kids out but decided against it. The kids knew Bobby was a jack of all, so they never questioned whenever he asked for absurd help. And moreover, Cas was their friend too.
“Damn! I wanna meet the dude who shut Adler’s mouth.” Dean said. He was curious as to who this dude was.
Dean didn’t know what possessed him to do so, but he swiftly got up from his chair and threw his leg over Cas’ thighs, ultimately straddling him. His hands were doing their own work, following the hard lines on Cas’ body, and Dean couldn’t stop from telling Cas’ name. He wanted something but couldn’t get it out. Cas’ hands were suddenly on his hips, grounding him, and making him gasp. Suddenly, there were lips on Dean’s. There was a fight for dominance, but Dean knew that Castiel had won. Cas’ hands were now one on Dean’s hip, and another in his hair. Dean was loving this feeling. He was elated. He was finally kissing Cas.
After the first week, Rowena had returned to the store, packaging, and stocking. She too was drawn into the busy of the store, thus the two reached home and slept without any funny business. Halloween had come quickly, and Loki was ready with his costume. Rowena had dressed up as Sigyn, Loki’s wife.
“I think that’s a swell idea.” The two’s attention was brought back to the gang by the dude dressed up as Fred spoke. “In fact, I think it’s high time we hit the road. I’ll go pay!”
“Cas was telling me how he came on his own on his…” Dean looked at Cas.
"Great! We won't have that oaf with us then." Meg cheered only to get a chorus of 'shut up, Meg' directed at her.
“Ok.” Suddenly music filled the air and the principal’s voice informed everyone the dance party had started. “Hey, I have some ice cream left.” Dean said, ignoring the people running to the center of the auditorium to dance. “Wanna share?”
“And our hangout last week. Cas wanted to listen to the song Garth was singing. Poison by Bell Biv Devoe. But you demeaned Garth’s taste and made Cas listen to Zeppelin and AC/DC.”
So Asshat Asher :)
“We could ask them. Imagine it being Meg. All badass and petite and just so-“
“I was telling Castiel about the garden nearby, that had a beehive. Castielle heard the word bee and started talking about them, and of course Castiel joined her.” She said, looking at the two with an amused, fond smile.
“Me too. But stupid coach called us. But I am happy we did now.”
Meg and Balthy shared a look before they said.
“Don’t ‘Hey Sammy’ me… Tell me what happened? And you and Cas?”
“Ever.” Dean nodded determinedly.
“Of course. If Meg and Zar were here-”
Some fast paced development coz come on! 10 years' a lot.
Cas chuckled nervously before saying, “In a moment of bravery, I asked you out.” Dean’s heart thrummed at that wording, but he knew this wasn’t a date. “But I haven’t gone out anywhere.” Cas continued. “So, tell me where should we go?”
Wait, Castiel? Wasn’t that the dude everyone was talking about in lunch? Huh. Now he understands. The guy has a charm to himself. Dean made his way to the library. The rest of the day was spent in classes, thinking about those beautiful blue eyes he wanted to swim in, and the dark curls that were so soft that he wanted to curl into them and be safely havened in.
“I spy, with my little eye, something… green!”
“Well don’t worry about that.” Iron Man said, jerking her head to Sam, “That sasquatch with beautiful hair didn’t dress up, thinking he was too old for Halloween.”
“No man, I insi-” Sam started but was interrupted by a car horn, getting distracted. Cas took this opportunity to teleport himself to the boulder.
“Miss me, honeybee?”
“No sir. But I believe he will come. I have changed from calling him to sending distress signals.” The man carrying the dress robes replied.
“Dad!”
“Hey there lover boy.” A girl’s voice brought Clark out of his thoughts. “Who’re you staring at?”
“Anyways, what were you doing, hanging off my Baby.”
“Clear April 25
“You had talked with the Child Service people after Sam told you right?”
“Well, let’s find them. This can be like a Halloween adventure. Let’s go!” Clark said.
“You saw her yesterday. Krissy. She was with me all the time. I brought her here.” Belphie said, confused.
On Tuesday, Dean was walking towards the café when he saw Cas in the hallway. Dean had dragged Cas to the café, arm in arm, and made Cas sit next to him. When Sam and Garth sat, Dean was squished into Cas. He blushed deep red and was about to apologize when he noticed Cas didn’t even care Dean was almost sitting on his lap. He was just doing his work, not perturbed by the lack of personal space.
“If you tell anyone I will find out who you are and tell everyone.” Cas threatened. “Hunter,” he sighed defeated as he placed his hands on Hunter’s chest and looked at Hunter through his dark lashes, “please promise me you won’t tell anyone. My brothers will get to know, and I can’t-” he took a stuttered breath, “Please.” He begged as a tear rolled from his terror-filled eyes.
“DAMMIT CAS!” Dean exclaimed before slamming his lips to Cas’, of course without getting Mary squished between them.
, “we should have rings to commemorate our engagement.” Dean pulled back and got the box with the rings.
"Anna you are a genius!" Bobby explained. "Sit with me on the chair now, no argument. I need you to help me format the form of resignation so that we are ready to get them down as soon as possible."
“Of course not.” Cas said genuinely. “You sure you’re okay? You seem a little… sad.”
“What do you want Rowena?” Gabe asked, with no hint of emotions.
“Meet the Grim-Nook family.” Gabe said as he opened Castiel’s door with flair. “I made the Grim Reaper, Balthy made Tom Nook, and Meg made the sweet baby.”
“Don’t act coy sheriff.” He said in a threatening voice. “Not only did you kill the poor boy,”
“Sammy!” Dean’s voice was much closer. Sam scrambled near Eileen, trying to look like they didn’t do anything. “Everyone’s here.” Dean said as the door opened, “Come ou-… Ewwwww. You know just because I know about you two doesn’t mean you should do it in front of my salad. And Eileen you can do better than this Yeti.”
Meg, unknowing to Ellen's inner thoughts, continued. "He grabbed my phone and notified others in my group. Mick just up and left because he didn't want to get killed." Everyone in the room were now standing, scent radiating fury and worry. "So if you are done with your familial crap, I say we start ASAP."
“How else are we gonna tell it?” Sam asked, rolling his eyes at the two’s antics. They were just so good for each other.
“We got waffles!” Jack beamed, and that made Krissy laugh a little. As she ate, Jack started. “I am sorry for what Belphie did. It was stupid of him to do.”
“Huh?” Cas said then looked down. “Oh,” he blushed, “yeah, I’ll do that… Thank you.”
Cas nodded but added, “You didn’t mess my life up Dean Winchester. You gave meaning to it. With a dead mom and a deadbeat dad, you brought light to my darkness. You gave me Charlie, Gabe, and Sammy. You gave me you, and you gave me your love, and allowed me to love you. So, don’t you ever say you messed my life up.” Cas pinned Dean down with those blue eyes as he said, “Never feel guilty as to what happened. It was never, ever your fault.” Dean nodded and Cas returned it, then looked away.
The brunette sighed and exited the building and went to meet the dude outside. “He saw you from there and yelled at me badly. Don’t know what the problem is. Maybe, if you had spoken directly to him, things would have been better, I suppose.”
“Oh, here you are!” Jody said, Donna and Psychic behind her. “I just wanted to thank you for your help.”
“OK! FINE!” Belphie whined, “My papa sometimes he has to go long distances to check and take care of stuff. The two times he was on the other side of the town were the times either me or Jack were sick. The first time when I was sick, Uncle Gabe came to pick me up, and told the school that he was our papa. Today, he was the one who came again, but Jack was always bad at lying. The school allows only family or guardians to pick up, and Uncle Gabe was neither. Well he is family, but not by blood. Papa will be coming to pick us up, our real papa. If the school knows that we’ve been lying, we’ll be in trouble. So please don’t tell anyone, please!!”
“Got some soft toys and stress balls!” Loki said as he came in with a bag, Cas following with another bag.
“It’s okay Sam, I saw how you reacted to their antics.” Cas smiled at how annoyed Sam looked.
“Well Sammy, you should have said that.” Dean said, ignoring Sam’s ‘I did say that!’ and turned to Eileen, “Hey there. Dean Winchester. At your service.” He said with a flirty grin and bowed a little.
“And I remember saying that I wished it was opposite day so that my yes would have been a no. You know, like how the children play,” the husband, Gary added.
“Hey Dean, how are you doing?” Sam asked, suddenly.
“What if I tell her I like her, and she says ok because she thinks she has to? She has to because she wants to reciprocate a deed that I did?” Belphie questioned.
‘Didn’t think you had it in you Gabe.’ Benny said.
“Dean, Jess is in labor. Her water broke.”
“If I may interject,” Cas started, turning the twos attention towards him, “how long have you liked Belphie? I know and it’s ok. That day’s recess, Dean had told me about it. Was it then?” Krissy shook her head.
“Punch me.” Sam jumped on spot, getting himself ready to be punched. “In the face. Come on!”
“A clock.” Dean said, “The rhyming helps. But which one? There are clocks everywhere.”
“You know… there is a way you can retain your memory even when it gets erased.” Bobby informed. “Go to bed. You’ve got school tomorrow.”
“Yeah yeah… congratulations but your moment was over yesterday.” Sam had let out an indignant ‘hey’, but Charlie talked over it, walking towards it, “Dean! Mind telling us why you were smooching with the wedding planner?”
“I too couldn’t understand how my skirt-chasing brother turned into a gooey sap with your papa. You have seen Dean, haven’t you? With the cool attitude.” Sam said.
It's Halloween!!!!
“Cassie,” Loki started as he sat on the couch holding his hands as Rowena sat on the other side of Cas, pushing him down to sit and rub his back.
“That’s enough!”
🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅🐋🦅
“And you two.” Dean reminded.
Cas was cute. Her innocence mingled with her wide blue eyes, was endearing. And when she ganked those evil sons of a bitches, she was downright hot. She did try flirting with Castielle but her adorkable, nerdy gal in the trench coat was too oblivious to understand that she was being hit on. How one could be both hot and cute, and sometimes at the same time? No one knew.
Castiel didn’t know what to do. First the car ride, and now he has a family? He was shocked. He was confused, happy, sad, everything. He wasn’t even sure what was happening was real. It all happened so fast, he felt like he was suffering from a whiplash.
“Oh, I am… You can’t just accept that I really hate you.” The shapeshifter said, then started laughing. “Oh, you got me!” It then transformed into Kaspar Hauser.
“What are you tw-”
“Yes, I did. Why? Do you have something to do?”

Right person, Wrong time – It happens.
“I found her in Instagram and followed her.” Sam said ignoring Dean.
“GABE! Can you come to my office for one second?” Meg said in a really sweet tone, and Gabe knew he was in trouble. He nodded and walked towards her room, glancing at Castiel and Balth, who mouthed ‘We will remember you’ and ‘R.I.P.’
so we’ve got ourselves a summer wedding to plan.” Balthazar said.
“I don’t know Jackie… I didn’t like how he looked at you. Just be careful with that Clark Barker. Ok?”
“Letting Meg, me, and Gabe help Charlie?” Balthazar asked.
Dean took the microphone from Gabe and cleared his throat. “I’m so happy. I feel I have become half my age. I came here thinking everything and everyone would have changed. Or act different with me.” Dean subtly looked to Cas, who sat up straighter and secretly smiled. “But nothing has changed. I feel like wearing my blue and white uniform and want to go to school with all of you again.” Sam, Charlie, and Gabe smiled at Dean’s words. “Thanks.” Dean said as he felt his eyes tear up. Before he could leave the stage, someone yelled his name out.
“What the hell does that mean?!” Cas asked as he tried to fight Loki’s restraints.
“Dean!” He exclaimed and slid across the room to crash into Dean’s chest, and Dean, in instinct, wrapped his hand around Cas. “I can slide!” He said with excitement and Dean couldn’t resist the chuckle that came out.
Fuck.
Cas had called Dean the next day to watch Loki’s selection of porn. Dean was first shocked about this but went to Loki’s anyways. Cas always watched the film with eerie concentration, but his face and the moaning from the tv always made Dean hard. It was weird but Dean hadn’t had action other than heavy make out for 3 months so screw yourself.  It was on Dean’s birthday when it happened.
“Well aren’t you young too?” Eileen asked smirking. Psychic gave an unamused look and Eileen continued. “Okay. You know the Banshee we hunted today? That was the one that caused me this.” She said pointing to her ears. “My mom and dad were a part of the Irish Men of Letters. The Banshee had attacked our house when I was a baby and the Warriors had helped in getting rid of it. But not before the high pitch screaming damaged my ears. My mom found me in my crib crying, with my ears bled out. With the help of the Men of Letters, we 3 moved to the states, and I was taken care of. I learnt to be a Warrior, living with the Men of Letters and am one of the Banshee specialists.”
“And you thought we were dating because of that?”
Meet the gang, and meet Dean W- Campbell.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you sir.” Castiel said, extending his hand.
“Gabe, I don’t have boobs.”
Mary was now 7 and had joined a school in Palo Alto itself. Sam had become a lawyer while Jess became a nurse. The two worked secretly to help male who can give birth and help them from not getting taken away by research groups. Sam was in the process of bringing the research company to light and get access to their documents. The world will a hard time adjusting to the fact that there were few males that could give birth but in the near future they will. Jess secretly helped to deliver male pregnancies but will start her own hospital specialized for male pregnancies. The two will become one of the most known power-couples. But that was in the future.
“No… no.” He wrapped the cloth in the front and noticed there was extra clothing. “I think… um, you need to… uh.” Hunter gestured a tuck in motion.
“Welcome back once again to the Music Talk Show. Take it away Dean.” The host said and the spotlights fell on him.
“So, what do you say Cassie? Let’s transform you and ask the boys.” Jack and Belphie were in Castiel’s room studying for their mock-exam. Castiel had no problem crossdressing. It was that they were lying to the customers and he felt guilty.
“There's no such thing as ghosts.” Velma said. “Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.”
“Krissy, I don’t need your hel- OH NO HE IS NEARING US! Krissy help!” Jacob panicked.
“For people who don’t know,” Bobby started, “Clarissa McElroy was one of the best Women of Letters. She had saved us from the attack from the Angels on Earth.” Bobby went on, sharing with the group about Clarissa’s contributions, getting oohs and aahs from the group. Bobby turned to Angel and smiled, “-And she was also the mother of this Fighter right here.”
“They’re dead?” Cas asked. “They’re dead.” He repeated.
Ready for a bachelor party?
“What raincheck?” Deanna asked, looking at Dean.
“Cassie. They are dead.
“What do you mean?”
“Dean-” Bobby started, noticing Dean’s face but was ignored.
“I was thinking we shouldn’t lie about the duration. Try to keep it as much to the truth so we won’t have to lie a lot.” Sam said.
“Hi.” Jody said, “Could you get us Bobby? Bobby Singer.”
By this time, a teacher had called an ambulance, the people who had left came back, and Dean had come near Belphie, trying to get his hold off Krissy. The ambulance arrived in few minutes and asked everyone except family to leave. “We would be needing one person to join us. Sir, as her guardian would you like to join?”
