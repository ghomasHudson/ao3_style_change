John turned, smiling up at the man with more malice than mirth. “Keep it up and you won’t have to imagine,” he clipped, and Greg laughed, throwing his head back to the clouds as he released John from his grip.
“Sherlock, I-” he stammered, adjusting the knot of his tie. “I hope- I hope you understand it was never my intention to…to harm you in any way.”
“You can have history professor,” Molly interjected, brokering a begrudging peace before turning to Greg. “What do you think, hon?”
“Well, you know what they say,” she shrugged, rising from the chair, John looking away just in case as the robe swirled around her legs. “If you’re good at something, never do it for free.”
Sherlock shoved his food to the side, scrambling off the bed to grab his mobile out of the coat draped over his desk chair. The screen glowed with the notification of a message, and he grinned as he opened it, turning to face a rather perplexed John.
,” he mused, shaking his head perplexedly as he stepped forward, Sherlock matching it with a retreat. The blond man then moved again, shifting back toward the center of the room, blocking off Sherlock’s path to the door, and Sherlock swallowed, his hands beginning to shake with adrenaline. Moran’s gaze tracked down his arms, his lips twisting as he saw the quaking digits, and then he lifted his eyes, brown sparkling over the taunting smile. “Well, how ‘bout it, Sherlock?” he quipped, tipping his head as he lifted the gun in the air beside his face, twisting it pointedly in his hand. “Let’s see if gods bleed.”
“Then, I’m gonna hail a cab,” he growled through bared teeth, his eyes not even seeming to see Sherlock as he passed, stomping toward the front door, “tie his scarf to the bumper, and drag him in circles around London.”
“Yeah,” John sighed, turning to face the dreaded opening leaking light and music. He twisted his body back to their impromptu meeting. “Let slip the dogs of war!” he proclaimed, lifting an arm toward the door in charge, and Sherlock shook his head as Dimmock laughed, but they both followed him toward the party.
Yes, the secret admirer thing was romantic, poetry and all, and, no, Sherlock did not believe they were anything close to a psycho, but, on the literal other hand, John Watson had given him his phone number. And invited him to a party. And told him to wear green.
“So, you-you never call them?” she asked, jaw dropping as John shook his head. “Why not!?” she demanded incredulously, and John shrugged, opening his mouth just as Molly chimed in.
to be in a relationship with Sherlock, officially, properly, with sickening pet names and inside jokes that made everyone else around them mime vomiting at one another when they weren’t looking. He wanted to know what Sherlock’s hair felt like running through his fingers, what section of the paper he read first on lazy Sunday mornings, what his smiled tasted like, what he looked like drifting off to sleep, everything, he wanted everything. But it wasn’t right, wasn’t fair, not so long as they were both keeping secrets, and his deception might be so off-putting, Sherlock would want to abandon the whole thing entirely, if not get a restraining order. Still, he had to tell him first, had to talk things out. But how?
“Everything’s been taken care of,” the woman assured, nodding down to him. “Soap, shampoo, shaving cream. Sherlock even told me what toothpaste you prefer.” Her smile brightened, but John’s face turned thoughtful.
“Um, yeah, sure,” John replied, making a mental note to ask Sherlock who Mrs. Turner was later. “Thai sounds great.”
Molly smiled, pityingly now, and his leg shook with the restraint of not snapping at her for it, genuinely curious what she was going to say. “Okay, what if it were someone else?” she asked, leaning closer to him across the table.
“Okay, grab a green one,” he muttered, because there was no way he was getting one of those horrid orange things, and he couldn’t very well let John down when he looked so delighted at the prospect of larceny.
Lestrade’s snarl cut through their rapid descent to primary school, completely unintelligible to John, but Sherlock shot him a final, narrow glare before turning back to the conversation.
“Please, let me.” Greg swept back in to her side, placing gentle fingers over hers on the plastic handle, both of them freezing a moment before Molly slid away, tucking her hair behind her ears and going from pink to red as Greg took over the steering. He cleared his throat, neck looking a little sunburned all of a sudden. “Follow me,” he said, and started toward one of the exit doors, Molly pointedly looking anywhere but Sherlock’s smirking face.
John snorted, barely covering it as a cough at the end, but his hand hovered over his mouth until he was absolutely sure the grin was gone.
Now, it was Sherlock’s turn to look caught in the headlamps, his cheeks darkening as he bit at his lip, eyes darting aimlessly.
The first day back at school was, as it turned out, much easier than John had thought. Well, easier may not have been quite the right word, but at least he wasn’t worrying about how to handle his relationship with Sherlock.
“No,” he snapped, and Sherlock shrunk back, “no excuses. You’re not tired, you’re not hungry because I made you eat breakfast, and you’re not coming down with yellow fever.”
about going against me again”—he stepped closer, hands sliding into his trouser pockets—“I will take up smoking just so I can cut off your hands and use them as ashtrays. Clear?”
“Amelia Vance. 45, recently divorced, two children—both sons, one in his final year of secondary school, and the other-“
Immediately, sirens started to wail, the high pitch of police cars mingling with the bellow of firetrucks, and John watched as people on the street around them turned to stare, some clutching their hands to their mouths, their children to their sides, while others took off running, no doubt worried for the fate of their loved ones who resided at the school.
John pushed off the floor, taking the computer and moving back to the edge of the mess. “Always?” he repeated, his eyebrows furrowing as he glanced down at the phrase on the glowing screen. “You mean, they never give your name?”
Sherlock flinched, his hand twitching, and the soft impacts of Irene’s boots stepped over the carpet toward him.
“She’s not seeing anyone,” he said, the car weaving a little to the right as Greg spun his neck to look at him. Sherlock met his eyes, a slow smirk crawling up his face. “That is what you were getting at, isn’t it?”
John got up, peering open-mouthed into the room. They already had practically their own wing of the dormitory house, and now a private bathroom!? Was there anything the name Holmes couldn’t accomplish?
He looked to Bonny, leaning in close to the cage. “You don’t think he meant- No,” he decided, shaking his head. “No, of course not. That’s ridiculous.” He bowed his head to the clipboard, pen poised, teeth pinching his lip. “Right?” he asked, lifting his face again.
it, blindly, desperately, and, though there was certainly a lingering need that played into it, that wasn’t why Sherlock hadn’t been able to handle disposing of them himself, why he had
“It’s a rare inflammatory disease,” John explained to the man’s nonplussed expression as he swirled whipped cream atop Irene’s cup, “as opposed to a bruise, which is, as it turned out, what I
“Trying to climb onto the roof,” John answered, Sherlock’s question formed in the curve of his eyebrow. “Mum and Aunt Claire were fighting,” he explained, voice fading to a murmur, and Sherlock looked away, his eyes drifting across John’s chest.
“He hasn’t?” Greg confirmed, and John shook his head. “How did that happen? I mean, he’s coming to a match, isn’t he? So, you two must have talked or something.”
took the car, and I couldn’t afford a cab.” He stopped, his back to Sherlock, form silhouetted in the afternoon light as he slumped, bowing his head and gripping the bridge of his nose. After a moment Sherlock didn’t even dare breathe, he sighed, spine straightening as he turned. “I’ll just have to stay here,” he said with a shrug, eyes disappointed, but resigned. “Maybe clean out that fridge of yours,” he joked, jerking his head across the hall, a smile trying to form as he looked down, and Sherlock’s stomach twisted at the lie.
“No, I-I couldn’t,” Sherlock breathed into the vacuum of the room, his own voice frail competition against the roar in his ears.
“Irene, hi!” Ethan touched her upper arm with his free palm, leaning in to kiss her cheek, and Sherlock took the moment to analyze the man—second year, law major, avid cycler,
He ran even faster now, leaping the first flight of steps, losing his footing on the landing and crashing into the wall, but he immediately pushed off, gripping the railings and catapulting himself down to the second floor as the door opened overhead, his teeth rattling as another shot echoed around the stairwell.
Mrs. Hudson smiled kindly at him. “Oh, don’t worry, dear, that’s just there to keep people out. If there’s no smoke coming from under the door, it’s perfectly safe.”
John huffed a frothy laugh. “Yeah,” he mumbled through a mouthful of foam, “you do ‘at,” and then grinned with smug eyes through the polished glass.
“Well, if he’d kept up his conditioning over the summer,” he muttered bitterly, and Lestrade laughed.
Lestrade was backing away along the wall, carefully extricating himself from a conflict John wasn’t entirely certain wouldn’t come to blows. Did Donovan have her Taser on her? Oh, he would pay to see that.
Sherlock’s eyes opened, and he sat up, legs kicking in the air as they dislocated themselves from the sofa, coming to rest on the floor as the detective bounced to his feet.
John didn’t know anything about ballet. He’d done a bit of research since beginning his leering, but he still didn’t really
“Well, come on then,” Sherlock snapped, jerking his head toward the door, a curl bouncing across his forehead with the motion.
“What happened?” he asked, bobbing his head to indicate the injury, unable to suppress his instinctive concern.
Sherlock shrugged, walking back through to the living room as he remembered their gone-cold tea. “Whichever you think,” he said, picking up both their mugs before returning to dump the remnants in the sink, finding John blinking at him when he turned back around. “What?” he questioned, and John rattled his head, dropping his eyes back to the menu.
Sherlock blinked at him, brow furrowing as he looked over John’s face, clearly trying to piece out what the appropriate reaction should be.
On Tuesday, he actually needed to go to the library, internally bemoaning the fact that it was one of John’s days off all the way to the poetry section, where he’d somehow been roped into picking up a book for Molly that she was worried would be taken by the time she got out of class, an emergency SOS text pinging into his mobile from Studies in International Poetry the second the paper had been assigned.
Tension rippled through John’s limbs, his arm tightening around Sherlock’s waist, and Sherlock summoned all his restraint to move slowly, sliding his palm up to rest over John’s hammering heart, because this wasn’t last night, wasn’t a clumsy thing born from pain and desperation, it was a
John was looking over his shoulder, his body turned to pass the bundle of paper along the row, and, in the second their eyes locked, he smiled in that same small way Sherlock decided right then and there would forever be his favorite.
It wasn’t too long of a drive to Baker Street, but it was long enough for John to work himself up into heart palpitations, his palms sweating where they shifted against the steering wheel. Normally—as in, with every other person he had ever had an interest in—it would be no trouble for him to reach across the gearshift and take his date’s hand from where it rested on their knee, wouldn’t cause his mouth to dry out thinking about whether or not to go for a kiss with the goodnights, wouldn’t twist his stomach into knots wondering if and how and when he should bring up seeing one another again, but, alas, it seemed Sherlock Holmes was destined to smash all of John’s preconceived notions to pieces, and, as they pulled up to 221B, he frantically tried to pull some of them back together.
“I-I just- I prefer you…with…me.” He finished with something like a grimace, his hands twisted together in front of him as he looked up at John through his lashes.
“She was there when I dropped off those case files on Saturday. You know, when you wouldn’t come downstairs?” he added, lifting his brows, and Sherlock huffed, glowering away to the floor. Lestrade sighed, unfolding his arms as he rolled his hands imploringly in the air. “She’s just worried about you, is all,” he urged, and Sherlock’s jaw shifted, a swallow moving down his throat. “We all are. You’re not eating; you’re sleeping even less than normal. Frankly, kid, you look like hell.”
It had been a quiet evening so far. Unexpectedly quiet after days and nights of Sherlock moping around the flat, sulking on the sofa, terrorising poor Mrs Hudson and pestering poor him.
"No, I can't, thanks though…" he hastily said in his confusion. What was happening? Goddammit. He should have stayed in bed, he knew it.
When a wintery brisk sunbeam found its way through the window and tickled his skin, he couldn’t help but feel curiously motivated to head out to make use of the rare occasion of sunny weather in London and John Watson in a good mood. At least it would get this battered body moving, maybe loosening some muscles too. Also, it would probably be good to clear his mind a bit as well — no use lingering on a pipe dream. Yeah, well, that actually wasn't such a bad thing now he thought about it. He was sure a bit of piping wouldn't do any harm…
John hadn’t expected the immense relief rushing through his body feeling like a wave crashing over him, choking him, tears welling up, threatening to spill over. His head sagged forward, trying to hide, although he knew it was impossible and not what he wanted. His forehead bumped on the table between their hands. He tried to breathe evenly to avoid the tears; needed just a moment to regain composure. When suddenly Sherlock loosened his grip, John already started to panic, but only a moment later he felt fingers tentatively threading through the hair at the back of his head. He inhaled shakily, didn’t dare to move despite feeling slightly awkward lying on the table. His scalp prickling under Sherlock’s touch, John was almost aware of every single hair moved by Sherlock’s fingers.
He had laid his heart bare with the song he had sent to Sherlock. He still stood by what he had said… well, written actually. He meant every single word of it. Now though, it was Sherlock’s move. And John was afraid of what it would be. He couldn’t pin Sherlock down. Sherlock was the master of mixed messages recently. There was nothing John wanted more than to be with Sherlock, but only if Sherlock wanted it just as badly. All in or not at all. But even that part was all true…
“Why else would you just ‘end up’ somewhere late at night?” There was a confused uptilt in his voice, but somehow he seemed rather intrigued than averse.
Slightly turning in his office chair, Mycroft greeted him with a blasé: “Sherlock”, which was accompanied by the tight smile peculiar to Mycroft. Sherlock was never entirely certain what it was meant to express. Surely not joy to see him nor affection towards him, as these were sentiments Mycroft wasn’t capable of. So was it just social nicety? What a wasted effort then, especially between the both of them. Their relationship had been sorted a long time ago and did not include niceties in any form ever! Sometimes Mycroft was just irritating, or rather he always was, and that was probably exactly what he was aiming for.
The moment the door closed behind them and the buzz of the music and the hum of the late night crowd was dimmed, the fog in his mind lifted slightly and he realised the force with which he still held on to Miss Pirate’s wrist. He also realised the radio silence from his partner and winced.
He felt his orgasm building, buzzing under his skin, in his mind, fogging all his senses; in the end he no longer knew where Sherlock's body ended and his own began. When finally all sensations overwhelmed him and his orgasm took over it was like a maelstrom  sucking him deeper and deeper under the surface. It seemed to last forever, tension steadily brimming, flowing over like a high tide breaking a dam.
Like a mantra he repeated it until Battersea Power Station came into view. A feeling of relief flooded his whole body and he allowed himself to ease his numbness, allowed it to change to some kind of determination. He could do this. And he would start NOW!
"No!" John said forcefully and dropped the phone between them to have both hands free to grab Sherlock's face, to force him to look at him. "No, not the point. Listen to me, alright? Just… listen. What I wanted to say is, when I thought I'd lost you again I realised the only thing I wished for was to have another chance, to make it up to you. I wanted a chance to prove myself, to show you how much you mean to me." His heart pounded fiercely in his chest. Why was this so insanely difficult? He even felt his hands tremble; Sherlock took hold of his wrists and lowered their arms to rest on his lap. On the way down he pressed a kiss on each of John's palms and then covered it with his own hand. A kiss held close and safe.
that easy, John. That’s the whole problem!” Sherlock said, tensely. He pulled his hands back and folded them, leaning heavily on his forearms. “You know perfectly well that I’m not good at explaining myself. I never find the appropriate words, I lack the skill of…”
Instead, he was utterly irked sitting in Mycroft's kitchen. The most terrifying thing about it was that Mycroft was preparing tea.
“I thought you loved everything about the solar system…” Sherlock said hoarsely, still laughing himself. “And for the record, I'll take the complete package of Captain Doctor blogger partner John Hamish my love Watson as well, please. Take away, if possible.”
A moment of silence fell in the room before John turned on his heels, stared at his friend, eyes big like saucers.
He didn’t take off the sweaty shirt, because otherwise his dress shirt would be ruined for sure. Pulling on his jacket he felt sticky and dirty, but couldn’t help it at the moment.
He tried to breathe calmly, closed his eyes and listened. Just listened and tried to make sense of it all. How could he get them both out of this unharmed? How could he keep John safe? Because that’s all he ever wanted, that’s all he ever fought for.
and a piercing melody that sounded as familiar as his own heartbeat. He must have heard it for hours now. For days? He didn't even know. But even now after this whole time the words didn't fulfill their promise. He still listened wishing, hoping, doubting, dreading, pleading…
Caught in his trance, John startled when Sherlock, inevitably bent forwards in his movements, murmured right next to his ear.
“So, that’s why you’ve been so livid with me for interfering? You wanted to do it all alone? All heroic like a fucking duel at dawn?” John asked, not only a bit irritated. “You’re aware that in the end always one of those heroic morons is dead, yeah? Fucking always!!” John said, more forceful and grimmer than he had intended. He inhaled, scolded himself, and said calm and more controlled, “Sorry, imagine I said that without shouting. So, that is why you’ve been angry with me? Because I’ve ruined the showdown?”
He finished the last remaining steps down the ladder and straightened his spine. Now, back inside, he felt the chill the evening air had left on his skin despite its summer-like disguise. He made his way over to the couch, his bag cramped next to the armrest, his makeshift home. He cringed at the thought of Greg's home being this muddled because of him. He pulled a jumper out of his bag, pulled it on and went to the door to slip into his shoes.
But what has all this hoping been good for, all this being hurt and being crushed into pieces over and over again?
“Nice,” he purred and stretched the hiss like a snake, which sent a shiver down John’s spine. He looked down at John with his dark rimmed eyes, the dark purple eyeshadow accentuating the colour-shifting irises, making them gleam like fireflies in a night sky.
"Ladies," John tipped his non-existent hat and nodded in their general direction as a farewell and rushed after her.
John stilled, took a deep breath, too exhausted to take any more. Why was he so devastated by all this? Why couldn’t he stand a silly argument? They had argued before, before all this fucking shit had happened and threatened to destroy them. They were shouting and swearing at each other, running off… but they’d always come back, most of the time just grinning at each other, giggling about their silliness and that was it. Now it felt as if his world would fall apart. He drew another deep breath, tried to get some oxygen which he felt had left his body entirely.
He would have died. It had been his heart on the trigger. He would have done it. Pulled the trigger. Died. But only together with John. But he hadn't. Because of John. How was he supposed to knowingly…
"But you just said something about not pretending to be someone…" John wondered but was quickly interrupted by Sherlock.
“Hey, mate!” Greg greeted him with a friendly slap on the back. “Good work here. Looking for that lot for ages now. Pretty cool Sherlock was willing to help out with this one. I hope you recorded evidence,” Greg winked at him, the boyish grin beaming even from behind his mask. “Not something one gets to see every day, ey? The great detective in panties?” He laughed heartily. “Pity he had to change already, would have loved to see him all made up… We had a pool running, you know…”
Sherlock checked his own texts, his gaze flipping back and forth between the screens of the laptop and phone before realisation dawned. Of course he had to spell it out for John. After all, he'd always be the idiot that he claimed not to be.
"Together," he said and pulled John's face towards him with both hands, almost painfully crashing their mouths together.
John groaned, for one because of the ache the twisted arms caused in his shoulders and second because of the slightly sweaty body pinning him against the door, pressed flush against him. He felt the contact from top to toe so to speak—Sherlock’s feet were spread, placed firmly on both sides of John’s, caging him in; his calves, his strong thighs steadily leaning against the side of John’s legs all the way up to his hips, as the V of Sherlock’s legs only met at a height where his groin was in one line with John's waist. Which meant that Sherlock was now grinding his crotch just above the swell of John's arse where it merged into his lower back. The rough fabric of Sherlock's denim, strained by his erect cock which was apparently ignoring his anger, rubbed against and above John's waistband, slowly un-tucking his shirt, baring his skin.
“He asked me if he could stay here until… as long as needed” She trailed of, a puzzled look on her face, brows furrowed. "Silly man, why would he ask?" She glanced at Sherlock. “Do you know what that's about?”
John Watson loves Sherlock Holmes. Perhaps, the best approach to Sherlockian problems were Sherlockian methods. John needed a spreadsheet. For now, he had to rely on possibilities, probabilities, options. He had to sketch the both most extreme edges of the spectrum of possibilities and find options to be able to move in between.
“Yes? And? You’re not going out, are you?” John got up and called after him, slightly horrified. “You’re in nothing but your dressing gown!”
"I have business to attend to. I'll see you at dinner and we'll discuss further proceedings." He got out and headed towards the house without waiting for Sherlock.
The Pirate wasn’t a pirate anymore though. High heels had given way to shiny black leather dress shoes. The costume was gone, no breasts, just a flat chest. Amazed John realised that he didn't care.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. John winked at him and, elbows leaning steadily on the tabletop, he rested his cheek on the knuckles of their joint hands.
He turned his head and looked Sherlock in the eyes for the first time in a long while. What he saw there caused a turmoil in his belly. What was this mix of emotions battling in Sherlock’s expression? At least, there were actual emotions. This wasn’t the cold Sherlock throwing him out of Baker Street. Although he'd never actually done that, had he? John had left before he could. This also wasn’t Shezza 2.0, who had wiped out all emotions by exhaustion either. This was different. It was an open and raw overload of emotions that John couldn’t unravel, let alone understand and most of all not handle! He looked away quickly.
"Yes," John got irritated, struggling to free himself without success. "Rescue you!" he growled. "You know, that is what one does when the other is in danger." he tried to colour his voice as rich with anger as he managed in his restrained position.
This was the first time though, that he wouldn’t have to do it alone. There was someone standing next to him on that cliff. Someone telling him that the ravine wasn’t dark but lit by sunlight, that the landing wouldn’t hurt. That the tingling in his stomach wasn’t gravity pulling him down but happiness making him float. He trusted this someone, he trusted John, like he had never trusted anyone before.
From his crouching position he made out a glimpse of black leather. Hidden behind the sofa, tightly stuffed into a corner was a doctor's bag. John's, obviously. But Sherlock had never seen it before. But of course John would have one, he had ‘cared’ for Sherlock after all. Maybe his old scruffy one which he had used so often to stitch Sherlock up after cases had been worn out. Probably. Doesn't matter. This was just Sherlock's muddy brain trying to deduce… he should stop trying today. Frustrating.
is, ever since I put the costume of the Purple Pirate back on, the way you looked at me changed. More so, the way you treated me was different, too. Only ever when I became Miss Pirate, as you like to call me then.”
Sherlock huffed a laugh. Yes, it was true. John did know best. So what if he's right? He's always right. It's boring. What would it change anyway?
"Sherlock…" Mycroft sighed and leaned back in his chair, "I agreed to help you translate your plan into action, but as it says in the description—this time it's
"Obviously." Sherlock said cheekily, the corner of his mouth twitching as John glared at him. "I didn't get the impression that it was a burden for you to help though…"
But not yet. Not now. It was still in the middle of the night. Not even dawn yet. Certainly this wasn't what Sherlock had meant by 'tomorrow'. John wouldn't compromise his only chance… his last chance… by disrespecting Sherlock's request, by being too eager, by being impatient. He was though. Impatient. He didn't want to waste any more time. The trepidation and restlessness were crawling across his skin like ants, thousands, millions of ants. It made him tingly, it made him anxious.
go sleep on your own side of the bed, you know?" he laughed while running his hand up and down Sherlock's back.
Without saying another word, John nodded, turned and left Baker Street behind. Out again, into the rain, away.
And before he could think twice, let alone answer, he was dragged into the small corridor next to him and was pinned against the wall.
“So”, Mycroft began his brotherly speech by stretching the “o” to an unknown length. “To which extraordinary occasion do I owe the pleasure of your company at this, for you at least, uncommonly early hour of the day, brother mine?”
Sherlock scanned his face for a moment then bent forward and caught John's lips in a deep kiss, taking his time in a way that felt to John as if Sherlock tried to confirm and refresh and seal their bond. Warm soft lips caressing his own, without any heat but with even more heartfelt emotions. A promise and a confession.
John's eyes roamed over Sherlock's form. Clothes torn, shirt hanging loosely, buttons ripped, trousers filthy, covered in something John didn't even want to know.
“John is the most common name in Britain since the 16th century and was given to more than two million people since civil records were established. I should have guessed that a man with your trust issues wouldn’t reveal such an intimate fact to a random stranger and would settle on a misleading and ordinary and bleak alias even though it’s obvious and beyond doubt that you of all people wouldn’t be given such an unremarkable name.”
Despite everything, at this point he wanted it. He wanted to face John, look at him, deduce his sincerity, his willingness to transfer all those words, all those unspoken promises into reality. To develop all the blurred and roughly sketched pictures those words had painted in Sherlock’s mind into something realistic, recognisable, tangible. To fill it with colour and memories, to let it show all the details Sherlock wasn’t able to imagine. He couldn’t estimate them yet. He had no data to base his expectations on. He had no room in his mind palace to retreat to, to prepare him for what was about to come. He felt helpless like during the first days of his teenage years, his young adult life, when he had to face
Imagine my delight, when I discovered that there is a pier close to Battersea Power station!! I was fortunate to visit London not long ago (at that point Greg's boat was already written and a core element of the story) and of course I went looking for Greg's boat!! Real Life Research. And you know what?? I found it!! It was an indescribable moment...
So Sherlock gathered all his strength, all his courage, and spoke up. If he didn’t dare now, who knew if he’d ever would.
He moved faster and faster still, breathing heavily, no orientation left. His hair and his body were wet with sweat, curls flying, whirling around his head. The air brushed his damp skin, numbing it, cool enough to let the fire die down. Hiding it underneath the remains of the burned, under grey ash. Ash of the colour of greying hair. He knew ash. Ash was safe. At least he could pretend.
“We? No! Thought you’d have caught up on that. Well… too occupied with your own stuff I guess, huh?” He waved off John's concerns. “Nah, we both
"My… Captain," the other man flattened and straightened his jacket. "Westwood!" he said shocked, as if that would mean anything. "Don't worry," he continued appeasingly, "
"Hey… you okay?" He asked amused, but also concerned that Sherlock might be seriously angry or hurt by it. John swallowed. It was only meant as a joke though.
"Was it?" Greg asked incredulously. He stretched his back, yawning himself. "However, I'm off to bed now. You?"
Sometimes he would get a text saying “Home late. Don’t wait up! SH” or “Case solved. At the yard, paperwork. Boring! SH”.
Suddenly two buffy guys appeared out of the shades, positioning themselves to each side of John's opponent, and John felt inclined to let go of the man.
His breath was slowing down, he was able to swallow, the pressure on his heart eased. He nodded, telling John without words that he had heard, that he had understood. That he knew.
When the music started, Sherlock’s posture shifted immediately. Radiating determination, vigour. His eyes snapped open and his fierce gaze bored directly into John’s soul. There was no doubt about Sherlock’s seriousness in this. John could feel Sherlock’s volition and power seep down his own spinal cord and spread through its axons until every single corner of his body was brimming with tension.
Seriously, my advice is: scroll through my and other people’s blogs, enjoy all the glory content *pun intended
He nervously shifted from one foot to the other when the tube finally arrived. He hopped in and made a dive for the separated seat in the corner. Not that the tube was that packed this time of the day, but sitting as far apart as possible from the other people was apparently the most desired form of travelling on London’s public transport. Fiddling with his phone in his pocket he estimated the time it would take him to get home and cursed his life. Only he could get a chance like this and ruin it faster than Scott could say ‘stupid’.
fully. It’s raw, it’s pure. It’s so... you.” John’s gaze was warm, admiring, fervent. He roamed Sherlock’s face with his eyes. “It’s extraordinary really. Quite... extraordinary.” He murmured and turned to look out of the window again.
And no, it's neither ignorance nor creative license that I made John make a call on the tube nonetheless.
John inhaled sharply and was about to move towards Sherlock and therefore step out of his hiding place, when Miss Pirate finally started to move. How long had he been staring at his Pirate? He realised he really didn’t know. He had forgotten about everything else around him, totally faded out. That was so not on during a case! John groaned. This one would be really hard. And futile innuendos: shut the fuck up!
here's a friendly reminder of the #happy ending tag and that you signed up willingly for the #angst tag...
“Oh Sherlock, you’re up!” She said with a hint of relief in her voice, clasping her hands in front of her purple dress.
There was a pause John didn't know how to interpret before the incredibly dark sultry voice dripped through the speaker again.
"Sherlock, I'm sure. I've never been more sure about anything in my life. I'm sure of this. I'm sure of you!" He spoke softly which didn't lessen any of the intensity of his words. "I don't love you despite but
Slowly it dawned on John. Sherlock, who had given up everything and put his own life in the line of fire to protect him; Sherlock who was the reason that John was still alive… He still didn’t know his value in John’s life. Sherlock needed to know! John had to make sure he did! Involuntarily he took a step in Sherlock’s direction and almost bumped against him when  the man suddenly stood right in front of him.
," John moaned. The heat, the buzz, the raw and ruthless want of his approaching orgasm built and swell in his lower belly.
John looked up at him, intensely observing him, scanning his face. He loosened his hold on Sherlock and Sherlock immediately craved his touch to be back.
"When they found out about Harry. And Harry's girlfriend. It was hell, Sherlock. I couldn't stand the constant fighting, stayed over at friends more often than not. I left her there all alone. I didn't stand by her side." He swallowed, hard, and felt his throat choke up. "And then, one day, it escalated. As much as my mom and dad hated each other, that day they were as a unit against Harry. And where was I? In my room, muffling the arguments with music. Did nothing but wait for the storm to pass. And she knew, Sherlock. She was called names and got insulted and I didn't do anything about it. A fucking coward." his voice was strangled.
So, John swallowed, squared his shoulders and walked over. He sat next to Sherlock on the bench and without saying a word or even acknowledging him, Sherlock handed over the coffee. Their fingers brushed for a tiny moment and John wanted to jolt back in reflex but that would have made the coffee fly. And what would Sherlock deduce of that? Inevitably his thoughts went back to his nightly wank and he turned his face away from Sherlock in the attempt to hide the probably plain evidence of the nature of his thoughts. Right this moment, John's mind was that muddled by the memories that he wasn't even sure if they had ever touched for real before! This felt so new. This felt different. This felt thrilling and terrifying at the same time. Of course they had, he scolded himself. They had even held hands, although John had been Sherlock’s pretended hostage back then. John had patched Sherlock’s injuries up more than once. And he had hugged him at his own wedding of course. And he had… John swallowed thickly, why were his thoughts always straying back to that point… he had touched Sherlock, Sherlock’s cold hand, taken a non-existing pulse. He had wanted to pull Sherlock in his arms, brush the bloody curls from his forehead, hold him, hug him, squeeze him back to life.
"I don't know, I don't have a plan in this case. Do you?" Mycroft asked, almost desperate. John only shook his head, because if he had he wouldn't be here, would he?
“The man it is attached to.” He laughed and got punished for it with a foot rubbing over his groin. Only barely holding back a groan, he grabbed the leg by its ankle, tight, and growled, “Hold. Still.”
,” He lowered the rest of the zipper without any hesitation left, felt the unmistakable bulge under his fingers. Sliding his hands around Sherlock’s hips, underneath the inconveniently tight waistband, he once more reached for that plush arse he had dreamt about far too many times. God, separated by the thin fabric of Sherlock’s pants only, it felt so much softer, warmer; so much more real. Stepping closer again, putting some pressure on his wrists, he eased the waistband over the curve of the behind he was holding firmly right now and finally Sherlock’s trousers slid down and pooled around his feet. Without wasting a second, Sherlock stepped out of it, simultaneously slipping out of his socks the same way John had witnessed him doing on that memorable day at Battersea; the last time John had seen Sherlock in not much more than his pants. Who would have thought then, that he would have this now. Not him.
“No. Just the name. Of the song. I had to look it up. But only tomorrow.” John said without hope that this would make a difference. Not after their conversation at the park. He appreciated Greg’s support and enthusiasm. But Greg hadn’t been there, in person. He hadn’t seen Sherlock, heard Sherlock.
John was right. He always was. Boring! Except, it really wasn't. Nothing about John Watson was boring.
While watching Sherlock with piercing eyes, John took hold of Sherlock's hands, eased them from his hips and guided them around himself, leaving them resting low on the small of his back.
“Oh, sorry, I didn’t want to…” she stammered, “... I didn’t mean to… this is nothing serious… I mean, it’s purely platonic, collegial, …”
Slowly, Sherlock made his way up the stairs. John could literally sense Sherlock's nerves strained to the limit, each of his steps telling a whole story of fear and bravery, of hurt and hope, of loss and love. His heart swelled with pride of Sherlock to have cut through his doubts and fears and opt to face their future.
And when Greg finally had said a bit awkwardly, “Here we are,”rubbing the back of his neck in self-consciousness with one hand, John had looked up and groaned in resignation.
His eyes widened in realisation. He fumbled for his phone and tried to open it with trembling fingers.
Still gripping his head, his whole upper body came to life, gliding in one powerful circle around his middle, head thrown back, fingers clutching his hair as if to be afraid to lose hold of something.
last night that was. Had he called Sherlock to pick him up perhaps? No, why would he with the man having no car. Also, the call had been much too long for a short request.
Without further warning Sherlock turned and strutted to the living room, picked up things John didn’t know they owned from drawers John didn’t know existed, put them all in a travelbag and grabbed his coat from the rack.
“I guess,” he said, followed by a comfortable mutual silence. Watching nightly London from the window seat he had flopped into, John wondered when he had last felt this not-lost in a silence and this not-trapped in a conversation.
Because that person in front of him was definitely anything but not sinfully physical - pure presence, pure sensation, pure sex.
." Sherlock grunted while simultaneously thrusting his hips forwards, shamelessly frotting his rock hard dick against John's lower back, forcing John's own groin against the door, mimicking Sherlock's movements. John moaned and closed his eyes. God, that man would be the death of him.
They snuggled in bed together, as John thought that might be most comfortable, and John opened his laptop.
“Are you… alright?” He heard the deep velvety voice next to him ask hesitantly. Christ, when had Sherlock Holmes ever been this cautious around John. This was not okay.
, the first rhythmic beats crackled out of the sorry excuse of a speaker on John's cheap phone and they both fell silent.
They laughed, enjoyed each other’s company, the intimacy of their own little island of warmth and coziness and love in midst of a world gone crazy. In his totally insane way Sherlock had known exactly what John needed. Forgotten were empty shelves, forgotten were restrictions to leave the house, forgotten was the anxiety slowly creeping in. They were together, they were home.
“You want to… watch.” Sherlock put it as a statement although the slight hitch of his voice at the end showed John that he was in the process of investigating, deducing, narrowing down. So it was actually a question to be answered. Why didn’t he dare to ask? John had thought it would have been fairly obvious what his intentions were.
The thumb pushed past his lips, dipped into his mouth and when he whirled his tongue around it, started to suck it, he tasted his own come. His eyes flew open, his gaze immediately landing on the Battersea Station he had been facing.
“Why?” Scott sounded a tad insecure. He was so endearing it almost hurt. “Isn’t that something one does?”
Knowing he had to take the lead here, he held Sherlock’s gaze, hooked his thumbs under the waistband of his own pants and pulled them unceremoniously down. He stepped into the shower and held his hand out for Sherlock to take, leaving it to Sherlock to discard his last item of clothing at his own pace. Sherlock took a moment, just looking at him with, well, hungry eyes; running his gaze up and down John’s body, the lingering look on his crotch hardly missable. John was more than aware of his erection bobbing at the prospect of what was coming, although he suspected he wasn’t alone in that.
John stood without another word and obviously tried to hide how hard it was to stretch after having crounched for so long. Sherlock tried not to show his fond amusement. John tried to pat the dust off his trouser legs but gave it up quickly. He looked down at Sherlock and held out his hand.
Then, of course, John was alarmed by his reaction but when John wanted to pull his hand back, being the considerate person he was, Sherlock’s distress had only increased, because… had he already ruined it? They hadn’t even had a chance to clear up
"Dehydration, physical exhaustion, malnutrition. Sherlock, from what I could estimate, you hadn't eaten for more than two days. Don't know about drinking. And Mycroft said…" he cleared his throat, "... you danced for hours, Sherlock.
"No, John, no!" Sherlock squirmed in John's hold, trying to escape the doctor's mouth. "No mark, no mark… please! You're supposed to help me!" he grunted. "You're one of the good guys!"
"So, tell me! Do you want me to go out there and Do. The. Work. or not? You do have to make a decision, you know!" Miss Pirate raised her voice as well.
to have around.” At this point Sherlock’s brow furrowed and John couldn’t quite believe his eyes. “For saving my poor arse once and again, for coming back to me.” He swallowed hard. “For giving me a second chance.” The sudden understanding of the magnitude of his own gratitude felt like a punch in the gut and he had to pause to get back on track.
John marveled at the realisation of the difference between the Sherlock 'then' and the Sherlock currently lurking outside of 221 Baker Street. The progress they had made. Both of them. No, John corrected himself, the Sherlock downstairs wasn't a different man; it was the same man, the same stir crazy genius he had always loved along the way. That open, vulnerable side in need of affection and love had always been there; safely bottled up and locked away behind thick walls of self-protection, only showing its face every now and then in Sherlock's most vulnerable moments.
“The thing is, I have seen it all the time, from the beginning; but I did not observe after all. I only now start to understand.”
The instant they opened the door, the silence around them burst into life, as if it was a magical portal to a parallel universe. As if to prove this image right, the very moment Sherlock set foot into the narrow hallway it was as if he changed shape, pulled over a mask; only it wasn’t a disguise—John could see that—it was still him, but different.
“It’s as if you’re swallowed by it, as if you’re drowning in it. And when you’re done sorting, you’re coming out on the other side even stronger than before. It changes me, too, to see you like that. It makes me think, it makes me question myself.”
"Not your only one though…" John responded warmly and cradled Sherlock's face in his hands to pull him down and claim him with a deep felt passionate kiss. After a moment, Sherlock abruptly withdrew from the kiss and looked at John with childishly innocent gleaming eyes.
“You go back in, observe people, talk to people… or rather let them talk to you. I’ll see you later.” And without another word she turned and left him behind, confused, exhausted, annoyed.
Knowing the song by heart, remembering each word as if it were burned into the back of his mind, John silently started singing along. Nothing more than a whisper at first, but each note echoed boisterously in the hollow of his heart…
“You can tell me, Sherlock. You can tell me everything. Let me know, don’t hide it from me.” The whispered words close to Sherlock’s ear loud enough against the music. John’s fingers abandoned the strands of hair to brush over the stubble underneath, on Sherlock’s neck. He trailed them over goosebump-y skin until he was stopped by a stiff shirt collar and up again.
“Ow!” Greg half serious rubbed his side. “I speak nothing but the truth! And you know it, Molls!” Greg defended himself, pouting.
Just when Sherlock suspected that John's plan to add a video hadn't worked out after all, the screen suddenly came back to life and a man's voice immediately started to sing. Sherlock looked up, but of course John was gone. Some inane video clip playing. So Sherlock closed his eyes and
John tried to stop his own thoughts but was caught off guard as Sherlock started to sway his hips. He didn’t even realise how Sherlock’s face fell into an indifferent mask, didn’t realise where this all was leading to.
But this question was answered when Sherlock raised one eyebrow questioningly and silently asked with a low rumble: “So John, very telling choice of food you have there. Enjoying it?”
And that was the moment Sherlock fully understood why a life without a John Watson in it felt like it felt.
He realised that he hadn’t heard anything from Sherlock the entire day, which was extremely untypical when Sherlock was on a case without him. Normally, Sherlock would inform him about every important and not so important and absolutely useless little detail. John checked his phone, but there was not a single message. To be sure that he hadn’t missed anything, he also checked for missed calls and frowned. There was an outgoing call to Sherlock last night. An
“Woah there… bit less enthusiastic maybe… We don’t want to break Mrs H’s bathroom furniture.” John murmured, grinning against Sherlock’s lips.
"Purple suits you. Maybe you should try it at some point." She smirked and John snickered, because no… that wasn't something for him and neither did he think that Sherlock would want it. It was just so screwy to joke about him crossdressing while Miss Pirate looked at him in all her stunning beauty. It was crazy. It was perfect! It was so them.
In the meanwhile, Sherlock had laid back, thrown one arm over his eyes and did his utmost best to breathe calmly. When John ran the flannel over his glans, he was still twitching; a little grunt escaping him now and then.
“It’s not how we’re doing this! You’re thoroughly mistaken if you think I’ll just watch and accept you going off on your own!” he glared at her, cursing that he had to look up to meet her eyes.
Both fell silent, knowing that neither of them could provide an easy answer of a few words. Too much water under the bridge, too many bridges burned, too many words unsaid.
“Still wanna have some? I’ll set the kettle…,” Greg was already on his way, apparently trying to find something to comfort John.
“Everyone is an idiot!” the man huffed. “However, you seem to be less of an idiot than the average population.”
This probably-relief had the unfortunate side effect of being an emotion. Allowing this one in, it opened the floodgates for emotions in general. He had to fight hard not to drown in them and to keep them at bay behind a solid dam of indifference. In a not so wise decision, Mycroft had chosen an evening out of all options as the time of the day to drop the news. Which entailed that Sherlock spent the entire night mulling on it. Without much distraction. Which didn’t help a single bit with the flood dam. When he got too restless in his room, he went outside into the backyard. He hadn’t much hope to meet the little bee, she would probably be asleep at this time of the night. Nonetheless, out in the garden he felt a curious feeling of calm settle in his bones. The same atoms, which formed the oxygen and carbon dioxide he was now breathing, feeling on his skin, ruffling his hair and carrying the scent of blossoms and fresh mowed grass… the same ones would be pushed and pulled across the whole surface of planet earth. With a bit of luck and coincidence he would breath exactly these atoms again, wherever he was going. He didn’t want to know in advance. He didn’t want to leave clues. But the day after tomorrow he would know. Two days…
"Not exactly sappy, but it'll do for a start," John grinned, one unruly tear escaping and rolling down his cheek, washing away the fog of the past that had overshadowed the first glimmers of a bright future ahead.
Suddenly he remembered and re-experienced the first moment he had stepped into the labs of Bart’s again, handing Sherlock his phone, hands and gazes lingering much longer than necessary, too long, not long enough.
The time until dinner was tedious. There was nothing to distract him. He had forgotten to take his violin and Mycroft was—of course—not equipped for experiments. Also, Sherlock couldn't contact the yard—if this plan was supposed to work, he couldn't show his face anywhere where people knew him and consulting with the yard in disguise wasn't really an option. But then, Lestrade hadn't asked for help for some time now anyway. He wondered if London's criminal class was getting lazy or if Gavin was otherwise occupied, informed about his relapse, had already given up on Sherlock... Probably, he could start to call Greg by his real name now. Of course he knew his real name. He just enjoyed John's reaction so very much that he couldn’t make himself stop—to Greg’s immense annoyance. He craved John’s irritation and insults that actually were an expression of their friendship. He was John's madman. John was his idiot. And that was the highest praise there was.
Oh dear God, was he wanking himself? Jesus Christ, John closed his eyes and groaned. Not that he'd really need any further assistance at this point anyway, but — this couldn’t be over already, right? At least, he realised, he didn’t want it to be...
His legs were weak and his hands shaking while preparing his breakfast and he was relieved when he could finally sit down. This bit of effort already felt like running a marathon.
He tried to shove his thoughts aside. After all he was here to forget, to clear his mind until nothing was left but blankness.
“Body hair?” he inquired, no longer caring if someone overheard them. “Leg hair, you mean.” John forced out, frowning.
. Have you heard yourself lately? Damn… vocabulary of a fucking Victorian dictionary! You know perfectly well how to use your words when you want to dissect someone at a crime scene! Rattling off deductions at lightning speed… Damn, Sherlock, you
“Well, that’s the sort of thing people dress up as for Halloween,” he explained, genuinely uncertain if Sherlock would know, considering John had seen more American high school movies than his counterpart—which was to say he had seen any at all. “Policemen, doctors,
“Good,” Greg said as he snatched it away. “I’m going to put my number in here, as well as Sherlock’s brother Mycroft’s,” he informed him through periodic glances up from the task. “If anything happens, if you even suspect anything, let us know.” He held John’s gaze until John nodded in acknowledgment, and then handed the phone back. “Better get back in there,” Greg said begrudgingly. “Those three can’t be left alone too long without some blood loss.”
John regarded him for a moment, searching for a trap, but Sherlock didn’t appear to be implying anything. “Not really. I mean, I guess I wouldn’t really know for sure, having never seen one in person.”
John tilted his head, his eyes shifting between the laptop and Sherlock with mounting confusion. “Er, it’s just my name,” he said hesitantly, twisting the screen further Sherlock’s direction as he pointed. “’The Personal Blog of John H. Watson’, see?”
“Yes,” he said, as if John were somehow the one being absurd. “To get the mobile phone. Honestly, did I slip into French at some point, or-”
him.” He chuckled. No one else did. “I assure you, I’ll send him right back. Not a hair out of place.” He continued grinning jovially, and Sherlock narrowed his eyes, but it was clear there was nothing for it, so, reluctantly, John followed Mycroft’s direction, heading out of the living room and down the stairs.
John was attempting to get his key into the lock, holding onto the metal handle for balance as he lunged, missing and clinking against the surface. He turned his palm up, staring down at the key as if it had personally offended him. “Sh’lock?” he slurred, and Sherlock blinked against the potent wave of liquor. John looked up at him dolefully, eyes heavy-lidded and blinking slowly. “The door’s broken,” he said piteously, lifting the key up toward Sherlock’s chest. “Make it not,” he added, swaying dangerously, and Sherlock caught him by the shoulder, pressing him back into the doorjamb with one hand while the other took the offered key.
around it,” Irene snipped, and John smiled, chuckling faintly as he leaned his hip against the counter. “But yeah. Surprisingly, Valentine’s Day isn’t all that big for cocktails.”
“Wait,” he bade, and Sherlock turned back, puzzled. “What was her name?” John asked, directing it now to Lestrade. “The victim, what was her name?”
Mycroft cleared his throat, his eyes shifting and unfocused. “I believe John is referring to the matter of your...
Sherlock shrugged, twisting to face the woman, his knee pressing against John’s thigh. “Once you’ve seen one genetically modified super soldier, you’ve seen ‘em all,” he retorted, and John ducked his head with a snort.
On the opposite side of the car, Mycroft quietly rose out, exchanging a quick, wary glance with Sherlock.
“Passable,” Sherlock remarked with a flick of his brows, and John frowned, wondering what would’ve merited an ‘impressive’. “And when they arrived?”
John didn’t know quite what to say to that, so he settled for glaring, content that, whatever Mycroft meant, it was something to be glared at.
Sherlock shot him a tired sidelong smile. “Just be glad you don’t smoke,” he muttered, and John laughed, the rattle of his body bringing his elbow next to Sherlock’s on the tabletop, a faint pressure shifting at the linen of his shirt as Sherlock’s arms moved slightly with his breathing.
the text read, the latest in the thread of his conversation with John—the previous installment being a series of ridiculous faces when the boy discovered an entire new page of emoticons—and Sherlock hesitated a moment, bare thumb hovering in the cold winter air.
“You don’t wanna see it!” he urged, and Sherlock’s struggling ceased, his eyes slowly drifting to the man’s face. Anderson’s brown eyes looked steadily back at him, a sheen of moisture glittering off the dark surface as the man gently shook his head. “You don’t wanna see it,” he echoed, the words cracking, and Sherlock simply blinked at him, dumbfounded, before turning his gaze back out.
Sherlock smiled, chuckling softly as he shook his head and turned back to the phone. “One day and you’re already solving crimes together?” Sherlock recited, overdramatic in his imitation, and John beamed. “Should we expect a happy announcement soon? A white, winter wedding at the Dorchester?”
“Not quite,” John said, the hand holding what looked to be a rounders bat bobbing to him. He shifted, flipping the smiley face to the other side and halting it against his leg, revealing a piece of paper taped to the visage. Grinning, John looked back up at him. “A piñAnderson,” he corrected, waving the rounders bat in a demonstrative circle around the blown-up face of the technician, which appeared to be the same picture used for the man’s ID badge.
Sherlock blinked at him, mouth popping open, and then burst into laughter as John waggled his brows. “
as he lunged forward, his salt-soaked lips crashing against John’s like waves beating over rocks, and it felt like drowning, like being devoured, Sherlock eroding him with every slide of lips and pinch of teeth.
The man was still turning, spinning on the spot so many times, John lost count, feeling off balance just looking at him twisting like a top, but the man never faltered, curls bouncing as he whipped his head around again and again.
“What is? What list? What are you doing?” Sherlock stepped forward, peering upside-down at the screen of John’s mobile.
John sneered at him, and then smiled, somehow feeling better under the barrage of insults. “Well, not tonight, okay?” he replied, rising to his feet again as he headed to his dresser for pajamas. “I’d rather save that for the more dire cases.”
Swallowing stiffly, he was about to give up on chemistry for today, heading down to the nurse to fake a migraine and get a lovely little excuse scrawled on a slip of white paper, when, quite possibly for the first time
“They wouldn’t think that,” Sherlock interrupted, shaking his head, and John snapped his face up, eyes expectantly hopeful. “They’d see it as you planning ahead, being self-sufficient. It’ll help more than anything,” he explained, and John smiled softly to himself, dropping his head back to the steam rising from his cup. “What did they say at the end?” he asked, and John shrugged.
“Well, then what’s the problem?” she asked. “Sounds to me like you’ve got the whole buffet lined out in front of ya.”
“Mary?” he echoed, shaking his head. “No. It was Irene wondering where we’d gone. Why would Mary be texting me?”
“No,” Greg laughed, shaking his head. “No, I do not. Plus, this way you’re all involved: Mary is setting up the flat while we’re at dinner; you played the music; and Irene helped pick out the ring. And my tie.”
Sherlock spun toward him, heart skittering with shock, because, though that had been obvious even at the time, it was different hearing it, a comforting confirmation he hadn’t even known he’d needed. “Really?” he questioned, voice creaking in betrayal, and John smiled up at him, a blush tinting his cheeks.
He rallied, though, hitching up a leer and leaning forward once again, Sherlock quickly running out of room as he neared other patrons. “Come on, let me buy you a drink.”
“Maybe just the chips to start,” he mumbled, John smiling as he nodded, removing the grease-stained packet of newspaper.
However long Sherlock lived—and he was under no disillusions about how not-long that was likely to be—he knew just as sure as he knew Mrs. Hudson would make him try on that sweater later to see if it would fit her nephew that no one,
Sherlock lifted his gaze, sighing noisily through his nose. “Mr. Tyson never does anything requiring actual work on the first day, so I knew all I would need is this, and you were already carrying around a perfectly good book bag without me lugging one as well.”
“So it would seem,” he replied, and John grinned, walking ahead of him as they converged in front of the ‘Please Seat Yourself’ sign.
He planted his hands on Victor’s chest, pushing him so hard, the man stumbled back against the opposite stands, clattering against the metal as his limbs scrambled for stability.
John peered back around the computer, eyes warm over a soft smile. “You’re welcome,” he replied, and, though his voice was loud enough to carry clearly to Sherlock’s ears, it felt soft, a gentle sort of sincerity that wafted through the air like the hint of sugar in the steam rising from Sherlock’s cup.
Harry shrugged, slipping her hands into the pockets of her army green jacket as he kicked at a loose stone. “You’re my brother,” she mumbled, and John’s spine stiffened in surprise, blue eyes blinking to Sherlock a moment as if to check he’d heard it too. “Granted, you’re a git most of the time-“
Mycroft nodded, bounding up the concrete steps and throwing the door open, waving Sherlock in ahead of him. “Yes, and we have very little time. We have to scrub the flat of anything that could hint to John’s presence.”
He clutched his arms over his stomach, toppling sideways onto the floor as he choked and gasped, legs rolling up toward his chest.
“I- Are you sure?” Lestrade asked, brow furrowing. “I mean- You can’t know that for sure. This could- It could all be a coincidence.”
The reaction was immediate, Mrs. Hudson even abandoning her chair to latch onto him, whispering pride in his ear before darting to fetch some sparkling cider for a toast. Mycroft hadn’t said anything beyond a remark that Bart’s was an extremely selective school, but John could read between the lines enough to know he was impressed. Mrs. Hudson returned, glasses were passed, and, though even John’s internal organs were probably blushing, he had grinned through the quick dedication and clink in his honor, a bit dizzy with the feeling of family, of home.
Okay so the scene that popped into my head first was the bees. It was just a few lines of dialogue, just a thought that that's how I wanted the conversation to start-Sherlock waking John up with some random nonsense about bees-but it wouldn't really work for current Johnlock, so I figured I'd make them teenagers! And that's how this epic Teenlock adventure began! Just a quick origin story for you.
“No,” Sherlock said with a decisive shake of his head, “you’ve made a point to learn the basics of the city—enough to not get lost, at any rate.”
you late?” he asked, angling his body to talk to Sherlock over his shoulder as he poured the milk into a small silver pitcher used for steaming.
He turned back to Mycroft, but his brother was pointedly ignoring him, eating his salad with all the focus of defusing a bomb, and Sherlock turned his attention to the same, a helpless smile on his face as he rolled a beet across the bed of arugula.
Sherlock leaned against the dumpster, ankles crossed and arms folded, the corners of his mouth lifting higher as John’s eyes narrowed.
“You just let me know if you want to stay with me over leave,” she said, but the intensity in her eyes said so much more.
A burst of laughter bubbled from beyond the door, startling him out of his spiralling thoughts. Checking the time on the mantle clock, he saw dinner was approaching, and begrudgingly moved away from the window, knowing his mother would want him to be there for the dining room’s unveiling.
Up to the point he almost felt out of his mind and wasn't able to withstand the urge to take Sherlock right there and then anymore.
“But... you know... you could have kept your handcuffs,” he smirked and wrapped his arms around this mysterious Pirate-Detective that somehow chose him out of all people.
“I wasn’t able to hold up that farce though, when my mom got us our first video tape player. It was some time after the movie came out already, but it was the first movie Harry got and it became our go-to movie for… everything actually.”
Now, with at least his breath being back to normal, the fog cleared a bit and the room around him looked more and more familiar. He recognised the pattern of the cracks in the paint on the ceiling, the prints on the wall, the noises around him. He tried to relax into the homely comfort of Greg's boat.
“No. Unfortunately not.” Sherlock rolled onto his back and crossed his arms under his head, staring at the ceiling.
"Well, I'm a Dancing Drag Detective. The only one in the world. I invented the job." Sherlock grinned mischievously, and John was certain both of them were thinking back to their first night when John had heard those words for the very first time. Well, not
He thought he had been careful and subtle. It seemed however that he had been sorely mistaken. Why was he surprised anyway? Was there anything one could keep hidden from Mr. Obvious? Apparently not. One day, when John had been very innocently preparing their afternoon tea, Sherlock had startled him. They had enjoyed their companionable silence, each going their own way, doing some more or less important stuff. Or rather, nothing important whatsoever. It had been tea time, so John had got up to set their tea. As was their habit. Without any indication Sherlock’s low baritone cut through the cosy quiet of their flat.
Then why not take it. I’m right here Sherlock! I’ll give you all the chances you'll need. JUST TAKE IT! WHY DON’T YOU?
"Come on, let's get out of here. I'm done with this shit." he growled, marched in direction of the exit, throwing glares at everyone who made the tiniest attempt to approach them, holding Miss Pirate in a tight grasp around her biceps.
An impish smirk on her face Miss Pirate rose to her full height. Without waiting a single second, she hooked one of her knees around the pole and spun in circles holding onto it with one hand, the Jolly Roger held in the other wafting after her, floating in the stream of air she created.
“Well, I’ll just…” He said, pointing towards the bathroom, “I’ll go take a shower, will take a while though...”
Sherlock never took his eyes off John who had now taken to the sparse chest hair. He especially took his sweet time with the fuzz of scattered hairs around Sherlock’s small deeply red nipples. It wasn’t exactly necessary, but John enjoyed how Sherlock’s breath hitched when he grazed the small nubs with the buzzing and vibrating device. They hardened and stood immediately and John couldn’t resist to lean down, put his lips on one of them and suck. The hitch turned into a hiss, then turned into a moan when John added the press and the teasing touch of his tongue.
"Would be the responsible thing to do indeed…" John grinned and lowered his voice. "But seriously, Sherlock,..."
“No, you may not!” Sherlock responded harshly without avoiding Mycroft’s look any longer. “So, can you arrange it or not?”
The day had stretched in agony from dawn till dusk. After the last texts, John had given up hope to get any reaction this way. He took the next step… crossing a line or no. He'd only know if he tried. That's what Greg had said. Pushing the speed dial 1 button he waited for the line to connect. He waited until the call was transferred to voicemail and then he cut the line. He didn't know what to say. He didn't want to talk to a stupid voicemail. He wanted to hear Sherlock's voice. He wanted a reaction from Sherlock. He wanted at least a word from Sherlock. He wanted Sherlock…
His mind was fogged. He was shocked. He was confused. He felt old wounds being torn open to bleed again. It hurt. Damn! Shit! Fucking feelings. He thought he would manage. He thought he had found a way to handle it.
Pushing open the door to the back alley felt freeing like breaking through the surface of the ocean when the lungs had already given up on the hope to get in contact with oxygen ever again. John almost stumbled when he was hit by the chill of the nightly air. He stopped in his tracks and inhaled deeply. So deep that his deep purple shirt was straining and the buttons threatened to pop off.
“Not a problem. You’re heading north I assume?” Scott said flatly as if working for an insurance callcentre rather than for a sex hotline.
Johns eyes were glued to this expression when she raised her head and her eyes snapped open and immediately locked with his.
Apparently that was it, John had to take what bit of information he was given. And if he was honest, he didn’t mind. Not much at least. Scott or Darren or Humphrey — it didn’t matter, right? Okay, maybe not Humphrey. However, his stranger could make up for that with a gorgeous face. Or arse. Or… No, not the moment, Watson! Different thoughts! Now!!
He was beginning to get disoriented when Sherlock slid his arms even further around John's shoulders, pulling him impossibly closer and into a tight hug; their mouths inevitably losing contact. A displeased whine escaped him and Sherlock, panting heavily, cupped the back of his head and just held him; after a short moment he slowly lowered his head and rested his cheek on top of John's hair.
What he did like though, was—proudly presented center stage, lit by a fuckload of spot lights—a shiny and promising dancing pole. John licked his lips and shifted on his feet. This might be worth the hackles-rising after all.
Sherlock smirked, very pleased with himself and mischievous in a way that told John he was in trouble. Oh god, maybe he'd better stop working at the GP office all together...
Their lips met slowly and the tender kiss they shared in relish lacked any hint of heat but was filled with warmth and comfort and love.
Remembering the last time he felt this drained he moved over to the couch and opened his laptop. Music, television and a drink had always been the only distraction for his tortured mind. He did not let himself drink. He had been drowning himself, his problems, way too much after...well after
With that he let go of Sherlock’s hand and took a step back towards the front door of 221 Baker Street.
"No," John barked out a laugh. "Rest assured, no need to serve the queen for me. That would be more my area anyway, I guess." He chuckled. Then, when he realised what he had said, he hastened to add, "Don't mean that in a kinky way though!" and winced.
His pulse was throbbing in his ears and was muffling all noises even more. He cursed inwardly; he couldn't afford missing the tiniest sign of danger or signal to act. First of all though, he had to find out what was going on in the first place. It didn't need a genius to know that this wasn't the cosiest of situations they could find themselves in.
The low silky baritone voice came as a surprise but oddly suited the exotic creature. It ran down John's spine like warm honey.
“Ha… tell me something new!” Greg interrupted him laughing. John couldn’t help but join him. After that, talking came a bit easier.
He had built his walls against superfluous sentiment up again at vast expense. He was very keen on keeping it that way. For everyone’s benefit! He could take John’s anger, because that’s what he had expected after all.
How could his determination only have lasted this briefly? He had to get it back. He was weak. He had never been weak. At least he had never wanted to be weak. And after the last slip he had managed fairly well. But now…
"However," Mycroft continued unperturbed, "that notwithstanding, we welcome your partaking. It will undoubtedly entail a great asset, although it wouldn't have been necessarily required."
"It got easier each time I said it until I internalised it at some point. And the easier it got the more it hurt Harry. At the end there, I could just as well have kicked her with my feet, already lying on the ground and bleeding." He shifted in Sherlock's arms, drinking in their closeness, scarcely able to believe that Sherlock still held him… tender, loving… as if he was worth it. "And to top it all off, I kept blaming her for her alcohol abuse and her anger issues, never openly acknowledging my own problems. There's a pattern, you see? I'm a coward." He noticed that Sherlock's hands had halted their wandering, arms encircling his shoulders, the thumb of Sherlock's left hand cautiously moving over the scar of the bullet wound in a careful caress.
Hunched on the chair, hugging his tugged up knees against the cold. His eyes traveling inevitably to the ghostly facet of the four chimneys of Battersea against the pinkish night sky above London. He sighed. How was this supposed to work in the future. Would this be the result of every time he thought about Sherlock in a moment of solitude? As pleasurable as it promised to be, this would tear him apart. He wouldn't be able to just go on like this forever.
Spreading the fresh shaving foam over Sherlock’s groin area, John cherished the sensuous slide of his hands over the smooth tissue of Sherlock’s lower belly nonetheless. How could he not; he’d never tire of that sensitive pale skin hidden under all those posh clothes, for unknown reasons his to uncover and to worship. He had to rigorously remind himself of the task at hand, not to forget to move on to the razor at some point. Cautiously, he guided the sharp blades over the plains of Sherlock’s body, anxious not to cut him in any of the delicate places. He held his breath, pulse accelerating at the thrill, when he slid the razor over the creases where thighs meet lower belly; the existence of the rapidly pulsing arteries just beneath the thin layer of skin all too present to his doctor’s brain. Sherlock’s breath hitched when John had to fondle his scrotum to get access to the fold to the legs. Sherlock let his legs fall open to the sides even more. John felt them trembling underneath his palms, apparently in a fight against the urge to move, to writhe, to buck his hips. Sherlock’s breath was slow even if stuttering, his lips slightly parted. The tip of the tongue darting out from time to time, running over the plush lips to moisten them, kept distracting John tremendously. He had to concentrate hard to keep his focus on the last remaining bits in need of shaving.
They immediately flew open again when he was taken by surprise by the almost spheric sounds of some sort of electronic music and a choir starting to sing.
He followed the foam sliding over Sherlock’s naked form with his eyes, envying it until he realised that he was allowed to trace its path with his fingers. Not bothering with soap, he lavered Sherlock’s skin with the remaining foam, running his hands over every single square centimetre, hoping he didn’t cross any line when he nudged Sherlock’s arms for him to raise them over his head to have access to the tender skin on the inside of his upper arms, his armpits, his ribcage, all the way down to his hips.
? It was unheard of and the most suspicious thing Sherlock had ever encountered in his whole career as a Consulting Detective. Something was seriously wrong and Sherlock was fuming that he couldn't figure out what Mycroft was up to.
“Among other things,” Sherlock suddenly murmured and John’s head snapped up where he had lowered it, lost in thought.
“Don’t know of any agreement…” Sherlock purred, his baritone voice sounded much too smug; the bastard knew exactly what he was doing. When Sherlock started to let his hands roam over John’s backside and one of his fingers slid down John's crease and pushed daringly against the tight ring of muscles of his entrance, John jolted back, sat on his heels, gasping for breaths. Not that he minded, not at all, but if he’d waited one second longer he would have been lost for any conscious thought.
"John," Sherlock pressed a kiss on his worriedly wrinkled forehead, "it's all fine!" he said in a low voice; John sighed.
"Don't know if that's advisable for our health though," Sherlock said thoughtfully, slowly regaining some composure. "They might want to give a demonstration."
Sherlock was deleting him. That's what he did to things he had no interest in, that were useless, that were boring. He deleted them from his mind-palace to not waste valuable space. John had become the solar system.
He grabbed his pants from the floor. At the same time as plugging his phone to the socket above the kitchen counter he hopped on one leg to get into his pants. He then picked up his trousers from where they'd fallen and struggled one-handed with the zipper, his other hand currently tangled in a shirtsleeve. He did neither care that he looked slightly ridiculous nor that  they were yesterday’s clothes. No time to gather new ones from upstairs.
"I can imagine." John reluctantly said but couldn't help but add, "Fascinating. Yeah, quite...extraordinary, really."
“Just… curious. Bad habit of mine.” Scott said, apparently trying to sound apologetic but failing spectacularly.
Hesitantly he pulled it out, tucked it under his arm. After one look around the room he slowly made his way downstairs again. His belongings still lay in a heap on the floor. He'd put them in the bag later. It wasn't that much anyway.
A moment of silence followed, only interrupted by quiet panting and hurried rustling and shuffling, which made John wonder if Scott didn’t even put the phone down to get out of his trousers. It was absolutely endearing somehow. John’s heart did a somersault, which didn't quite fit into the picture of the Captain bossily getting some random guy off on the phone.
John was confused, had to rewind his memory to be able to catch on to the conversation. When he did he stopped short; behind him a woman with a pushchair only just avoided crashing into him, giving him an angry glare.
,” Encouraged by Sherlock’s responsiveness John ran his thumbs over Sherlock’s nipples, circling them, felt the tingling of the hardening nubs under his own sensitive skin. The sharp inhale through Sherlock’s parted lips, sent a buzz through John’s body, causing a tension that had nothing to do with the former hesitation, but all with restrained impatience and want.
Her eyes widened a bit, then softened. Then she smiled almost shyly, leaned forwards and pressed her soft lips on John's. When she pulled back her smile widened into a grin and she raised her hand to wipe her thumb over his lips.
“John, really… What is it with you today?” Sherlock pulled him from his thoughts. “So… which one?” He wiggled the objects of interest in front of John’s eyes.
“Christ, Greg!” John shouted and slammed his bottle on the table, hunched forwards and grasped his hair. “He didn’t say it, alright. It’s just… I heard it… in,” John winced, embarrassed about his own assumptions. In the general direction of his knees he now mumbled. “There was this song, okay. He was da… no… no, not the point. Don’t ask why, but I know it was important to him, and that was what this song was about. That he needed someone. That he wanted someone. Quite desperately if you ask me. Yeah, and now… shit Greg, now he said there was something that needed his attention.” John straightened, looked up at Greg, lost. “Do you understand, Greg? He wants distance from me. And he has found something new, whatever or whoever that is. He… doesn’t need me anymore.” John’s stomach twisted and he felt the weight of the words spoken aloud settle on his heart.
“Just pretend, nobody’s watching!” John said, softly. “As if I’m not here.” He searched Sherlock’s face thoughtfully, then slowly, deliberately shook his head. “No,” he said, stretching the word. “No, actually... You have to be aware that I’m here. And that I’ll stay. You have to know that I’m watching you and that I will love it.”
“It’s from a movie, you know?” He let go of the cuffs, sliding his hands up Sherlock’s arms instead. “A romantic and sentimental, not very ambitious and pretty predictable movie. You would’ve hated it.” he said, reaching Sherlock’s shoulders. “I must have been… what? 15? Maybe 16 years old? … You probably had much more important things to do at that time.” He let his hands glide up Sherlock’s nape and cupped the back of his head, fingers tangled in curls. “For example blowing up your mother’s kitchen.” John grinned and got up on his tiptoes to press a firm kiss on Sherlock’s lips.
“I’m scared.” Sherlock said quietly. Molly stopped in her attempts to leave and stood still, watching Sherlock. “I’m scared like never before, Molly.” He looked up, locked eyes with her.
John had never heard anatomy used as dirty talk, but damn — it was the hottest thing he had ever witnessed. Just imagining said quite deliciously sounding anatomy, his breathing had become quicker and there was no way hiding it.
"That's not all, is it?" he said under his breath, and John needed a moment to make sense of it. What did he mean? The moment his mind caught up, he groaned. He hated Sherlock just the tiniest bit for reminding him, but he loved him even more for staying true to their promise, to their agreement. For both of them. It was just… he was tired of it. All he wanted was to hold Sherlock, to drown in their kisses, to explore what lay ahead of them. To leave the past behind. But for that…
He wanted to. God, how much he wanted to. If only John would be brave enough for both of them. If only John would dare to take Sherlock's hand and jump. Together. And wouldn't let go.
He watched her pick her belongings, which were strewn across a desk in front of a giant mirror; everything got stuffed carelessly into her bag. John realised all the other girls were in different stages of changing and removing make-up, but Miss Pirate didn't seem to bother. She grabbed Sherlock's coat from a chair it was draped over and hurried to the exit again.
"This is the ludicrous sex telephone number for bisexuals. You’re speaking with Scott. At your service. What is your concern?" he was greeted by a silky deep but monotone and apparently pretty bored voice.
Despite not-as-short-as-expected chapters the chapter count was raised once again. The boys have a lot to talk about (of which even the author sometimes didn't know) and demanded a bit more time to be happy together... who am I to deny them? *innocent blinky eyes*
John chuckled a bit helplessly at the man, as he could now address him correctly, was standing much too close for John to think clearly.
“No, Sherlock. I’m not doing it. I’m a doctor, I made a vow to never intentionally or knowingly and unnecessarily harm other people. And
After he had replaced his finger with his lips and had shared a tender kiss with her, he reached for her chin to hold it in his hand to steady her face. He took one of the cotton pads he had slathered with make-up remover and softly brushed it over one of the sharp cheekbones.
His head rested limply on the soft cushion his neck was forming, eyes closed, curls tickling  his nape where it was merging into his upper back, bouncing to the rhythm he held by.
The laugh bursting from deep in John’s chest was freeing somehow, releasing an anxiety he hadn’t known he had developed, that he in some way would offend this fantastic guy and ruin what they had built. No matter how much or how little it was. John already loved every bit of it.
The last time he had held this disc in his hands the circumstances had been totally different in one way, but in another way it had been exactly the same to what he lived through now.
This was so different to the last time John had found himself in this place. Sherlock’s movements were more cautiously yet with much more certainty. His whole body quivered as if being part of the music. His muscles working, his arm and leg movements looking small but so strong at the same time. The air seemed to hum with crackling tension.
That’s how he found himself surrounded by some old friends - very old and some he’d never been even close with - and some army mates on leave or discharged and injured home same as he himself.
“See? That’s the problem. You see two different people. But it’s all me, John.” Sherlock said urgently.
"Deduced as much." Sherlock said calmly and turned to look straight ahead again. Easier to walk. He would never acknowledge the relief he felt.
After a while a triumphant smile spread on John’s face and ceremoniously he placed his phone in the middle of the tabletop.
John had to smile at the extraordinary and enthralling but at the same time so lovely and endearing creature in front of him.
But the rest, God, he didn't know what to make of it. He wasn't able to wrap his mind around it. Of course, he had been aware of Sherlock's shifting and obscure moods, but then… hadn't he experienced the same thing throughout this whole weird case? He'd never expected Sherlock to react this fiercely. Was this… what was this?
He looked lost and without thinking John reached over and laid his hand over Sherlock’s, which stopped his fumbling immediately. It was meant to reassure him, to calm him, but the moment skin touched skin John felt the air around them getting charged again. Sherlock’s eyes widened and he looked slightly panicked, which surprised John considering the acceptance of John’s touch he had shown earlier. John already wanted to pull back again, cursing his own over-eagerness, when he saw the level of panic in Sherlock’s eyes only rise at the realisation that John was about to let go. Confused, he left his hand where it was and slightly squeezed Sherlock’s to show him that he had understood. Just holding his hand in place, very intently not moving it, John looked at Sherlock, signaled him
“You…” John growled, almost stabbing his pointed finger into the guy’s nostril, and scowled at him. Words failed him in his whatever-dark-mood-muddled mind and he simply turned and pulled Miss Pirate along.
Ah, John's tiny lizard brain struggled, not exactly the most calming choice of words. He’d rather not think about Sherlock preparing himself right now. Probably not what she meant though. At least, John hoped not…
"Oh, don't play innocent, Mycroft." Sherlock growled and looked at his brother with undisguised scorn. "Don't pretend this doesn't suit your needs."
Sitting straighter he calmed his breath, shook his shoulders and arms to loosen all the tension he had built up and silently sang along the next lines…
"So, that's what you're going for?" John tried to handle all this weirdness as stoically as his soldier self expected him to do.
A puddle of blood seeping into the desert sand changed into blood spread on a pavement, clinging to dark curls and a pale face.
“Am I? Good…” The shock in Scott’s voice had turned into his sultry smugness, which made John swallow and speechless. “Still no reason.” Scott added, voice skipped to businesslike again without transition.
Sherlock felt the rough material of John's denim scratch against his hand palms with each still sway-y movement of John's hips. All his senses on high alert, he was aware of every shift of his clothes where they were rubbing against John's; the sensation transferred to his skin like a blueprint; causing all his synapses to fire information to his brain he was barely able to process. The bump of John's belt made his hand curl slightly and his fingers dig into soft tissue just above John's back pockets. He swallowed.
Arriving in front of Sherlock again he looked up into eyes like black holes, a gravity holding him in place, sucking in everything he was.
"Yeah, stop, I get it!" John, whose face was beet red by now, shouted to interrupt his partner in his lecture. "I think it's more… I don't like the thought of it… for you." he added sheepishly. He cautiously looked at Sherlock, whose expression softened slightly.
"Shit, Sherlock… Fuck…" John panted. "Stop. Wait… Sherlock…" He reached down for Sherlock, helplessly fumbling to get hold of the over-enthusiastic vampire. "Come here. Come here!" he puffed out, voice hoarse, breath ragged, and pulled the man up when he finally got a grip of the back of a neck, of a bony shoulder.
“I have absolutely no idea how to handle this. Reactions, as just now, I don’t want that.” He curled his fingers, wanted to claw the kitchen worktop, crumble it, crush it. Let out the destructive forces that were his emotions on anything but John.
Standing here now, secretly observing Sherlock, he wondered how he had never known. He knew Sherlock was fit even if his lean body had always been just this side of skinny. Since they've been hunting down criminals and running the streets of London often enough, it was only natural to be some kind of athletic. But now, faced with well pronounced abs and pecs, upper arms shaped with bulging biceps, the whole body pure muscle, John found himself staring, swallowing hard, heart racing, holding his breath.
Sherlock winced and he radiated agony, John could almost feel it physically. John closed the last remaining space between them and laid his hands on Sherlock’s waist. A connection, a reassurance, nothing more.
He pulled away a bit, but only so far that he could take Sherlock’s face in his hands, tenderly holding him, wiping away the tears with his thumbs. It took a moment, some unsteady breaths, before Sherlock cautiously opened his red rimmed eyes to look at John.
John's hands held him together, squeezing his shoulders, rubbing over his upper arms, stroking over his back, between his shoulder blades, up along his spine. Fingertips tickling his curls. Soft palms cradling his face.
“No, I merely implied that I need to get rid of my overly male body hair.” Sherlock carried on as if nothing had happened.
That's why he tried to stay out of his way. But then, he hadn't many places to go to. It wasn't convenient to stay anywhere longer than a couple of cups of tea or some pints or a meaningless chat or a dinner. He had tried to go to the park, sit in a cafè or a restaurant, but it hadn’t worked. He felt even more alone, he was painfully aware of the absence of his counterpart on all those occasions. It was a tangible gap, the empty chair across the table, the vacant space next to him on the bench. He had got all snappy when a nice enough looking woman had asked if it would bother him, if she would join him, take a seat. Yes, he had nearly yelled. He was waiting for someone, he had said. The seat was occupied, he had said. And in a way it was. The space next to John, at John’s side would always belong to just one person. No matter if physically present at the moment or not. She had shot him a quizzical look when he had left two hours later, obviously alone, with no-one at his side who would have required waiting for. If only she would know…
Eventually, John stirred beneath him, planting a kiss to Sherlock’s temple before his hands urged Sherlock to rise again.
Sherlock froze in place, his expression closing off quickly. But not quickly enough for John to miss the flash of hurt and rejection that tightened his mouth and darkened his eyes.
Sherlock glanced up at that, John’s tone bordering somewhere between glad and nervous. He watched as John licked his lips again-a tell. John was nervous. About what? Did he think Sherlock was going to make a scene? Was he about to give Sherlock some carefully thought out speech, explaining that what they had was just a casual fling and oh by the way, I’ve decided to move on to the hot redhead at the bar? Before Sherlock could launch the offensive, tell John he needn’t worry, that he was leaving and John could do as he damn well pleased, John was stepping back and holding out a hand.
) lean body  softened in all the right places. On suppressants, Sherlock was gorgeous, no doubt. Off suppressants, his body practically screamed ripe, unbonded, ready to be claimed, filled, and bred. Even more noticeably, he'd been moodier than ever. There had been moments when John was certain Sherlock's Omega side was running the show-moments when he would practically purr with happiness while sitting next to John on the couch, eating takeout and watching movies. Other times, he'd find him curled up on the couch, sullen and unspeaking, practically hissing insults at John when he dared to show concern.
He entered the flat, setting the takeout he’d picked up on the kitchen table after he toed off his shoes by the door. He listened for sounds of Sherlock, grateful relief filling him when he didn’t hear sounds of Sherlock being ill in the bathroom. Of course, that didn’t mean he hadn’t been already. But the morning sickness seemed to have passed, for the most part. In fact, Sherlock’s appetite had picked up a bit. Well, picked up for him. Still wasn’t eating enough, as far as John was concerned, but at least he was eating regularly.
John met and held his accusing glare with his own hard stare. “I'd do it again, in a heartbeat. Someone wants to hurt you. I will do anything. Anything. To keep you safe.”
“You! You made me take contraceptives! You don’t want to have a baby with me!” Sherlock’s voice hitched at the end of his declaration.
“Oh, really, Mycroft! Did you really think John was some Alpha knot head who was going to force me to breed whether I wished it or not?” He let his amusement show on his features, before shooting a glare at his brother. “If you truly wish to make amends for what you’ve done, you will release my trust. We will need the funds when John quits work to stay home with me and our child.”
Sherlock nodded eagerly. “They’re fascinating, John. And they make honey!” he beamed down at John, who was looking up at him with a familiar look. Oh. He recalled all the times he’d seen John look at him like this, eyes shining, mouth quirked, face soft. John loved him. John. Loved. Him. “I love you too!” he blurted out, realizing he hadn’t returned the words.
John's eyebrows rose. “Oh, it was implied all right. And I had every intention of bonding with you as soon as I could.”
“I am afraid apologies must be made. I didn’t foresee the potential consequence of my recent actions.”
John closed his eyes and exhaled heavily. Clearly Sherlock wanted this, wanted to make John come just by his voice alone. Who was John to deny him? John allowed the shudders of pleasure to wrack his body, giving himself over to the building tension, no longer fighting it but embracing it. His mouth dropped open and he breathed heavily, his hips shifting and his legs falling even further apart as he focused entirely on Sherlock’s voice.
Being unable to find a button-down shirt that would close across his chest was clearly an indication that he was losing the battle with his transport. Looking in the mirror, he raised a hand to his ribs, noting the flesh that had filled in the gaps between them, the softness that had settled around his lower stomach...the weight he’d first noticed in just his hips, thighs and buttocks seemed to be settling elsewhere.
John plated the bacon he had been frying, then set down the pan and spatula and turned to face him. He gave Sherlock a searching look, then stepped away from the counter.
Sherlock knew John must be looking at him, watching his hole twitch. He tried to imagine what John was seeing-Sherlock's hole gaping and wet, loosened and filled with John's come. Perhaps a bit rosier than its usual pinkened hue, thanks to their play today.
Sherlock’s chest heaved as John fluttered the tip of his tongue against Sherlock's hole, the motion causing his muscles to flutter in response. John hummed in approval and Sherlock whimpered against his arms, which pillowed his head against the tiles.
John frowned as he took in the set of Sherlock's shoulders, the way his arms crossed his chest, the downward tilt of his chin.
John pulled away after placing a gentle kiss to Sherlock’s lips and stripped, grabbing the lube off the side table before climbing up against the headboard and settling Sherlock against his chest. Sherlock rolled his head to press his face against John’s neck, slouching back against John in a boneless sprawl.
Sherlock gasped as John’s hand drifted across his pectoral. He had noticed recently that his nipples had become sensitive, even slightly swollen. What once would have been a teasingly pleasant caress now felt like a torturously painful grope. He winced as John’s hand passed over his nipple again, shooting painful sparks across his chest. He pulled away.
John pulled out his fingers, holding his hand out so Sherlock could see the come coating them. John opened his fingers and Sherlock could see it spread between them, oozing and thick. He wanted to lick, to taste.
Also there was a dark blue slim cut suit with underneath a white dress shirt, visible under a dark woolen coat which was pooling around the figure on the roof.
“NO! Of course not! No! Why would it?” That... had been too fast, too many words and too loud a voice to be a simple ‘No’. John felt his stomach drop. Which was more of a tumble right now, churning as it was anyway.
Sighing John brought himself to say: “You know it hasn't been easy. Lately. The last... months. With Sherlock and me… I mean. Hmm… who am I telling, you've been there. Seen it. Haven't you?”
This gaze made John quiver to the core and he had to control himself not to pull that gorgeous face down from where it was towering high above him for a deep thorough kiss. He felt slightly ridiculous—or rather not only slightly—next to Miss Pirate whose heels added at least another 4 inch to the usual 5 Sherlock had on him anyway. He felt like a hobbit. However, nobody but him seemed to care, which might have been caused by his possessive hand visibly placed either on her back, arse, hip or occasionally on her nape, even though he had to reach up for that. Or, Miss Pirate’s bashful attitude displayed in the moments John paid her obvious attention. The way she created the illusion that she'd deliberately make herself smaller while still losing none  of her grace—John was fairly impressed—might have added to the image that John was fully in charge.
Sherlock cleared his throat and didn’t look at John, when he picked up where he had stopped. His hands still clutched the coffee cup and John was afraid he would crumple it with hot coffee and all the way he squeezed it. Sherlock took a deep breath.
After a while during which Sherlock barely dared to breath, John's voice came tired and muffled through the phone. He could hear scratching close to the speaker. John was running his hand over his face? Through his hair? Sherlock could see it before his eyes as if John was standing right next to him.
”. Honestly, those names! Although, there was one person who would be allowed that name—John Hotson would be pretty accurate—but what in God’s name could be the excuse for a random ordinary blog to claim this honour. Either way, there was work to be done…
he thought. London was too expensive for his small army pension. And who would want him as a flatmate.
way at least… Sherlock couldn't hold it against him though, could he? He couldn't expect John to find him in such a precarious situation, left in the dark and then keep a clear head.
“So will you tell me or not?” Scott’s voice shifted to annoyed but he couldn’t fool John. Definitely pouting, definitely adorable as fuck. Jeez, John was so done for. Ridiculous.
Your patience with these two Idiots is finally paying off as they're finally (slowly) getting there! Hallelujah!
“But if you didn’t want to lose me, as you say, then why… I thought… You were tired of me. I’ve become a burden for you.” Sherlock said, urgently, as if he wanted it to be confirmed. Was that what Sherlock had thought? John’s heart was pounding frantically.
There was a moment of silence and John saw Sherlock swallowing. He immediately regretted his temper and felt slightly guilty at the hurt expression on Sherlock’s face. Sherlock lowered his gaze and nodded slowly.
‘Angel with a shotgun’... he’d said it before. He would fight for love. For Sherlock. If that’d be what Sherlock needed. Sherlock had thought it to be foolish. Nothing to fight for, because he would never have expected… could she be right? Love? John hadn’t articulated it explicitly this way though. Was there room for misinterpretation? What was more likely… that the Bit Not Good High Functioning Sociopath would be wrong in matters of … sentiment… or Lovey Dovey Flirty Jenny? But John was so… rugby… and beer… and pub… and girlfriends. A
“No. No, it doesn’t.” John laughed, the humour reaching neither his eyes nor his heart. “But what has recently, Sherlock?”
"Oh, believe me, that'll be absolutely not a big stretch for me, babe." John growled, his recent encounter in mind.
Maybe that was it. Maybe his plan had gone wrong and he had been lying in hospital ever since. Has everything he thought he remembered just been a coma induced dream?
