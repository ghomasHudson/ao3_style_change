“I’d like to head behind those curtains. Just to see what’s there, I mean.”
“He’s certainly, at the very least, earned himself a spanking,” Irene said, “but if he behaves, and eats his lunch, we can play this evening! How does that sound, Sherlock?”
He gave him a suspicious look, but let go. Sherlock knelt.
“Don’t,” Sherlock said, and the reason for the effect became apparent, as he stood in front of them with a tray of champagne flutes. He was dressed identically to the other servers in the room, white shirt, black pants, black vest, black tie. His wild curls were slicked black. He shot a worried glance at John.
“Touch me. Please.”
John cut him off. “Three! It’s three.”
“Yes, very intimate,” Irene said, ignoring Sherlock.  “Yes, I do think they need my help. I’ll be back in touch tomorrow.”  She thumbed the phone off and slid it back into her purse.  “Well, boys, it seems you’ve got yourselves in a bit of a pickle.”
He traced on the screen with his finger, as if to confirm, but in reality, he had been quite familiar with the place: its Friday night King’s Chaos parties. And the Saturday BiBash parties. And Corrosion, the gay male BDSM parties--whenever he wasn’t nodding off in a heroin induced stupor. It had been a long, long time since he'd been. He wasn’t allowed. Rocco, the club owner, had strict instructions to make a call on a secured mobile if he showed up in any kind of an impaired state.
Irene waited, tapping her foot. Under his breath, Sherlock continued. “And as needed.”
Sherlock took a deep breath and relaxed completely, almost melting into the bench.
When he finally walked into the sitting room, his eyebrows lifted in shock. John was kneeling next to Sherlock’s chair wearing pants and a chest harness. The table was set for one, formally, with the fine china, silver, and a linen napkin. Candles were lit and serving dishes were steaming.
As I approach, I say, “John, I’m sorry.”
I ignore him. End goal.
“It’s the least you can do,” he told Mycroft, once he found his voice. “We’re trying to clean up your messes, for god’s sake.”
“Son’s birthday.”
“All right, that’s it! Just stop it, both of you. I refuse to be a tennis ball batted back and forth between you. Now unless somebody else wants to go first, I’m having a wash-up and going to bed. Sherlock, you can join me or you can work yourself into another snit and take your mattress off across the floor. And you,” he pointed at Irene, “there will be no more Mata Hari in this,” he flailed at the concrete surrounding them, “bank vault.”
“No. Not really. Wasn’t the point of all this to neutralize the threats against us?”
Irene must have read his thoughts in his face. She stood, smiling primly, and walked over to her suitcase. “Don’t mind me, darling. I’ll just go have a bit of a wash-up and leave you two alone for a while.”
John gave him a wicked grin. “We have an ice bucket.”  He fished an ice cube out of the bucket on one of the nightstands.  “And it’s full of ice.”
He contemplated downing the glass in one go, but took a sip instead, and was rewarded for his restraint.  It was very good champagne, and deserved to be savored. That didn’t do anything to relieve the restless thrum under his skin, though.
“What are you doing?” he asked.
Sherlock shifted, wincing slightly as his arse rubbed against the towels.
“Absolutely not.” John walked over to him and pulled him to his feet. “First we talk. As humans. One person with another. Turns out we hardly know each other. Or at least this part of each other. So sit.” John looked him up and down and licked his bottom lip. “No. First we change our clothes. Then tea and sandwiches. And then we talk.”
“Yes, John said—I don’t need permission!”
Accepting his defeat, he grudgingly recited the litany. “I’m getting a spanking because I threw a strop.”
“That is NOT fair!”
After a few minutes during which John finished his seltzer, Sherlock jangled his chain and John left a few notes on the bar. Sherlock guiding him subtly, they walked in the direction of an armless sofa against a wall. John sat on the end, so that Sherlock could kneel beside him and still have a view of the entire floor.
To illustrate, she brought the brush down with a crack that made both men wince. In contrast to the steady rhythm she set with her hand, the hairbrush fell randomly. “Changing the rhythm sets him on edge and forces him to pay attention. Otherwise he might enter a meditative state and block out the pain. He focuses on the sensation and gets lost in it.”
John pushed Sherlock away, just enough to give himself room to sit down.  "I'll be fine, Sherlock. No major arteries were hit, and the bullet went clean through."
Sherlock very, very reluctantly left, standing only a few steps from the door, pointedly watching as they spoke.
John offered a weak smile and blinked back unconsciousness.  "Put pressure on the wound.  Here, use my-"
And he was out the door, hailing a cab and directing it to Barts.  The ride was much longer than he'd have liked it to be, but when the cab pulled up to the morgue, he felt a nervous energy settle in.
Sherlock watched him go, feeling a twinge of guilt at abandoning his doctor so abruptly after his nightmare.  His mobile pinged and he scowled down at it.
here ya go, guys.  happy reading.
, that sent him into a downward spiral that he willingly participated in.  The suicide that Sherlock didn't seem to think of as relevant, at least not outwardly.
John stared up at him in the darkness, and finally he let his guard take a break for a while.  He squeezed his eyes shut and let his words come.  "It was of you, Sherlock.  It was of you, of every time you almost died, except I wasn't there to save you."  He shuddered out a sigh and held back his tears.  "You died.  For every time I saved you, you died."
Nothing, for a while.  He felt a twinge of panic in his chest.
And after John was up in his bed, sleeping soundly, he did try.  His stubborn mind refused to be shut down for the night, so he sighed and settled onto the couch, wandering his mind palace.  He sifted through the past few days and when he reached the day John was shot he felt his heart clench.  He blinked, a tear falling from his face as he left his mind palace.
They both ignored the tension and John spent the following days teaching Sherlock everything he wanted to know.
"Oh you didn't have to! Thanks Ms Hudson."
Sorry this one's so short, I've been busy.  The next one will hopefully be longer, and better.
the moriarty chprs are going to be a bit shorter than the rest. sorry.
to." Sherlock was whining, and John honestly couldn't have cared less.  His head was pounding and his wound was throbbing painfully and a haze had crawled across his vision. Sherlock continued to rant, either not noticing John's pain or not caring.  "John, are you listening?  You must.  There is simply no one else who is even remotely competent enough."
"Put it on the ground!" he commanded.  John obeyed, and the man put a bullet through the offending object.
before he left for work.  He let Sherlock lead him to a chair and sit him down without argument.  Sherlock made toast -- really the only thing he
The detective scowled at his brother. "It's no business of yours."
He sniffed.  "Just a nightmare.  Sorry I woke you."
Thank you all, lovelies!
John just smiled.  "Sherlock, I love *you*, for everything you are.  I wouldn't have you any other way.  Just be yourself; that's the Sherlock I love." He stood to press his lips to the detective's nose.  "Let me be the affectionate one, and you be you."

"You're angry."  he stated plainly.

they ever had a relationship, it would fall apart the instant John realised that Sherlock was incapable of the level of affection he craved. Of all the people in the world, of all the people he could have, why did he fall in love with John?
Just two days later, John was finally allowed to leave.  He suspected Mycroft had something to do with it, as he most definitely should probably not have been released so soon.  But he said nothing of it to Sherlock.  So they took a cab home, Sherlock helping John up the stairs to the flat.  They collapsed on the couch, John already winded and weakened from the steps.
“Do you remember when I mentioned how difficult it was getting you out of the country? And how many times must I tell you, Bolivia, this is Not. A. Secure. Line.”
John waited until he had walked away and spoke to Sherlock. “Ready, Pet?” John pointed at the bench and, Sherlock knelt on the lower level and John gently pushed him down so that he was bent at the middle, his chest over the top. John ran his hands over all the areas that Sherlock had given him license to, lifting the shirt this time, to feel the warmth of the skin below it. “Shall we try it out?”
She tousled Sherlock’s hair and beamed at John. “You see? Poor thing just needs a firm hand. On his arse. Regularly. Isn’t that right, Sherlock? It reminds him who he belongs to. And he belongs to you now, doesn’t he, John?” Sherlock thrust his lip out with a vengeance and pouted magnificently, although there was the hint of a smile at the corner of his mouth.
Once everyone had finished their meal, Irene indicated Sherlock to John with a raised eyebrow and a tilt of her head. John looked puzzled and she rolled her eyes. “Well done, Sherlock, that wasn’t so terrible, was it?”
“Hmm. Well, I never really had all that much experience and it’s been a long time so I’m probably a little rusty.”
John made a slipknot, looped the end of the scarf around Sherlock’s ankle, then fastened the other end to the bed frame and pulled it tight. Sherlock suppressed a whimper as John walked around to the other side of the bed, hands already busy forming a loop in the last scarf.
Sherlock hummed happily, his arms sliding around John’s waist.
“Oh, John, really. Squeamish about your uniform? It’s the perfect outfit. It’s the only way anyone would ever believe that you’re a dom. It’s going to be challenge enough convincing anyone that I’m submissive.”
He stood up quickly and said, “Good boy. I’ll forgive the disrespect. For now. I’d like you to lie along it and clasp your hands underneath.” John took up the handle of the leash before Sherlock stood up.
“Where’s that lube?”
“I’d like to see the various positions you’re describing to me. You do seem to be having trouble getting into character, Sherlock. I’m thinking, it might help if I actually do apply a little discipline.”
“No,” he growled, tugging at his tie again. “Just don’t like wearing this monkey suit.”
“The next time Mycroft gets in touch tell him it’s not a very safe room if the people in it are driven to murder one another out of sheer boredom.”
"No, my classmates are okay," the child sighed, slumping forwards. Her skirt and jumper crinkled at the movement, her chin falling into her palms.
"I wasn't informed, either," Sherlock answered, still pointedly looking away from his relative. "How peculiar."
, as the case may be."
Now, at first one might think that the groundbreaking investigative work required in a case is a riveting, edge-of-your-seat endeavor. This was Rosamund's impression of her parent's daily work, and on the whole, she wasn't wrong. This line of inquiry she was so desperate to fall into was dangerous, imploring, and very, very complex. However, every occupation has its lags, and the initial scouring of documents was far from the intense chase scenes and murders she had witnessed so far.
"Working on the case.  Simple one.  The man confessed as soon as we found him."  Sherlock replied, hanging up his coat.
"Okay," John nodded.  "I can work with that.  I can show you how to handle a wound until medics arrive, and how to do emergency care if you need to get moving again.  But, Sherlock, why do you want to know this so badly?"
John tensed when Sherlock brushed the Scar and pulled away, though only just.  "Sherlock. . ." he breathed, a pained hitch in the back of his throat.
"I'm aware of the consequences, which are precisely why I have chosen not to act." he snarled.  "Thank you for your incredible insight."
At that, Sherlock fell silent, his expression turning from frustrated to concerned and worried.  He flexed his fingers and stood awkwardly at John's side, not knowing what to do.
"Yeah. . . Tell him I say 'hi' back.  I still have off from surgery.  Anything you want to do?"
, I suppose.  I didn't
John frowned, drug-filmed brain not capable of thinking through Mycroft's words just then. "How do you mean?"
John went to the kitchen to put the kettle on, and Sherlock pretended to be preoccupied in his mind palace.  He tried, at least.  He couldn't help a glance at John as he passed, and Mycroft noticed.
Anyway, thanks a million for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it!
She stayed for tea, and asked how John was getting on and all sorts of useless small talk that Sherlock despised.  He ignored them and set up a small mould experiment that he pretended to be occupied with until Ms Hudson left.
Sherlock stiffened and shuddered.  "John. . ."
Sherlock was the first to spot him, unsurprisingly, followed shortly be Lestrade, who let out a sour curse.
Sherlock scoffed. "I am never careless, John."
mess."
"John," he began, calling to him from the couch.
"Keep me talking, and keep pressure on it.  The ambulance should be here soon.  I'll be fine, Sherlock."  John smiled again, curling his fingers against Sherlock's over his wound.  His friend swallowed hard and nodded.
Sherlock knit his brow. "John, you have
John's fingers found their way to the buttons on Sherlock's shirt and easily undid them, doing the same to the sleeve cuffs.  Sherlock sat up to toss the shirt away before pulling John's night shirt off over his head.

OH AND ALSO! I haven't seen series 4 (*distant sobbing*) so forgive me for not writting anything at all about Sebastian Moran.  I've only heard tidbits, not nearly enough for me to write him in.  So it's just Jim, all by his lonesome. Sorry.
this is one of my first few attempts at smut, so I apologise in advance in case it's horrible.
He tried so very hard to look confused, or lost, or something as he approached the suspect.  So very hard.
A shot rang out just two blocks away, and his stomach lurched and panic overrid everything else in his precious mind palace.
"But you're always capable of comfortable others, and I just--" he gestured vaguely.
"No, Sherlock." John shook his head.  "They're no more dangerous than before.  But . . . you've gotten
*l been by my side when I needed you.  I am
Suspicious, but also far too tired to care, John yawned, "What is it?"
Next few chapters will be a tad shorter than usual, sorry.
His doctor said nothing, but laid down, pulling the detective with.  John lay facing the window, Sherlock facing John's back.  After a long while, John's breathing evened out.  Sherlock brought his spidery fingers to his back, tracing patterns along his spine.  The patterns turned to letters, spelling out the words "I love you".
They'd been up since the previous night.  John had spent the entire time teaching Sherlock how to handle different emergencies.  Sherlock had learned easily, pressing John for more each time he was finished; John had happily obliged, until his eyes were refusing to stay open and his limbs were growing heavy.
"Morning Sherlock," he said, smiling up at him.
"But he must know it isn't his fault!  There's nothing he could have done!"
Sherlock stiffened.  Can't do what? He didn't mean- no, of course he did.  What else could he mean?  "You're leaving then," he said. It wasn't a question, but he hoped John would say no.
John woke the following morning to Sherlock's arms draped loosely around him, stroking invisible patterns into his back.  He sighed contentedly and nuzzled into the detective's neck.
So just so you all know:
Anyway. . .
The shot.  John.  Their suspect hadn't had a gun on him.  John.
John knocked his feet from under him, but the man was fast.  He was on his feet instantly, pushing off a wall at John, who was reaching for his gun.
"No no.  Rest. I'll be back soon."
Sherlock sighed and attempted to refocus on his experiment.  He couldn't love John. He was straight, firstly, as he constantly said.  And secondly,
In the weeks that followed, he became increasingly concious of how his body had become aware of where John was, constantly.  His closeness to John during the medical "lessons" made it that much more difficult to concentrate.  John would peer over his shoulders and guide his hands to the proper positions and he felt his skin tingle with every touch.  The feelings didn't fade.
"Then I now pronounce you married. You may kiss." The officiator, with gray hair fading to white, nodded in approval. The lapels of John's suit were gripped as his partner pulled him in, putting lips on lips before John truly registered anything. It was sweet, actually, and the brunette nearly looked away. This was their moment, after all, and she almost felt as though she was intruding.
"I couldn't find my coat today, Sherlock, but you didn't have to give me yours."
, Sherlock." In a genuine, brilliant smile, the detective responded.
"Thank god you're here, Molly," the doctor breathed, readjusting his grip on his daughter. "Lestrade just begged us to take on two new murder cases -
"That was
"Not nearly as clever as your parents, I'm sure," she said wryly. The blonde shook her head.
She clearly referred to the others as 'her classmates'. There was a sense of belonging there already, an establishment of a unit. The inflection was fond, as was the experience itself, then. As she had already explained, Rosie didn't have a problem with her new peers - on the contrary, she liked them. There was more exasperation in her tone and stance than sadness or pain, anyhow. The struggle must be internalized or stem from another spring.
"I'm warning you, Sherlock, you need to control yourself. I can't keep going shopping for new sweaters every single time you decide to destroy them."
"Tea. And here I thought you wanted to investigate my marital status."
"Oh, that's nothing. My Daddy once flipped off Uncle Mycroft in full view of his staff and Dad. Without being assassinated later." The thought of John Watson, or anyone, really, doing something remotely vulgar towards
"Never. I've come to appreciate that quality."
"I've got it, yes," the detective answered with his usual exasperation, as if she couldn't ask a more ridiculous question.
This was why, when he proposed, she didn't question it. She didn't think he was anything less than serious as he asked. She didn't hound him with doubts or make sure he was certain about this.
What was less hilarious, though, was the fact that John instantly started choking on air the instant he understood what was happening. Sherlock stood next to him, awkwardly patting his back and generally looking very concerned. This continued for another five minutes while Molly spectated, resisting the urge to call Greg and inform him of this new development.
Eventually.
"You don't even understand rugby, though."
"Oh wow," she breathed, gazing at her laptop's document reverently. Reyna nodded quickly. "You bloody proved it, Rey."
He was an analytical. He kept his mind sharp, his wits and instincts even more so, and this cool detachment and brilliant mind made him such a good detective.
"Right. Good movie, though. Good cast." The detective snorted.
"I appreciate the sentiment behind that, then."
"I have no clue what I'm supposed to be doing," John said the instant they arrived at the thai place on their first date (yes, an actual date, Sherlock really wishes everyone would just
now or never, actually, unless we had attempted to wait until tomorrow afternoon in the first place. I guess the bright side is that we caught him severely off guard, but hindsight really is 20/20, isn't it?"
"No, no, pumpkin, just . . ." His face was red, though this could have been from a rise in self awareness or a decrease in temperature rather than the intense gagging of before. She settled on embarrassment or a new state of self consciousness, given the lack of a chill. Never before had Rosamund felt so proud that her detective had begun teaching her the fine art of deduction. "Why do you ask, Rosie?" he eventually sputtered out, viciously clearing his throat and sitting up straighter.
"I swear I put it back in the closet! I know I did, and clearly you didn't take it." Molly could guess who stole it. "But speaking of missing clothing, where are my jumpers?"
“I saw you.”  Sherlock’s eyes were fixed on the ground.
Accepting the challenge, he threw his shoulders back and walked towards the chair. Irene stood up and dumped Sherlock unceremoniously off her lap. She handed the brush over to John, who sat. Clearing his throat, he said, “All right, Sherlock, up you get.”
“Of course.” John led the way. They found three beds, a massage table and a DM keeping watch in the center. Couples occupied two of the beds, and on the massage table was a young man with nothing but black leather briefs and a blindfold on. An older man stood near his head, holding his hands, wrists crossed above his head. A third man was on the side of the table, holding a lit candle over him, tipping it now and then on different spots on his body. They watched as he let the wax fall onto his chest, then his nipple, drop by drop. The captive flinched with each bit of wax that landed and pulled against the hands holding him. The man leaned over to speak to him and he settled down again. John said, “That looks like torture.”
“And we still have to talk--”
Sherlock nodded and ran his hand over the smooth leather. The words came more easily now. “Yes, Sir. A bottom can lie parallel along the top or bend over, perpendicular in this direction, or—“
Sherlock closed his mouth and straightened up, like a man who’d made up his mind. “Yes, Sir.” He put both of his hands on top and backed up so that he was bent over and at arms distance from the horse.
By the time we reach Baker Street and enter the flat, I am actually trembling with excitement. John takes my coat and says, “You stink. Strip.” As I do, he prepares himself, sitting on the sofa and then patting his knee.
“Oh. Oh. I…I see. Sir.”
As they walked out, John was asking, “Dungeon masters? Rumbustious?”
“You’re not going to be able to punish me anymore, are you? Spanking won’t work.”
“Sent any postcards?” The irritation was much clearer now.
Sherlock stared at him a moment, mouth hanging open.  Then he looked away, a pink flush blooming on his cheeks and the tips of his ears.
They each headed to their own room, John calling out, “Put clothes on.” Sherlock grumbled.
“Genius my arse.” They laughed and Irene patted Sherlock’s bum lovingly.
“I did what?” He felt his cheeks flush. The tips of his ears grew hot.
With a deep breath, John backed up and sat on the director’s chair, elbows propped on the armrests. Irene was gathering a pile of objects on the small table in the center of the room, including silk scarves, a belt, a hairbrush and a bottle of hand lotion. Sherlock’s blush had disappeared, his skin paling so suddenly that John was suddenly concerned about his blood sugar. When was the last time he had eaten? Stupid--of course he wouldn’t have eaten last night, not while the game was on. Food was the absolute priority: a new game had begun.
The Count’s study was dim and quiet after the bright clamor of the party. A massive wooden desk stood in front of a bay window, with a sleek leather chair. The remains of a fire smoldered in the fireplace, which had a sumptuous leather couch and two club chairs arranged in front of it.  A zebra-striped rug – probably real, John thought – completed the cozy space. On the other side of the room there was a beautifully crafted bar, with dusty golden-brown bottles of whisky and cognac arrayed against the wall.
“Or a basement in Serbia,” said Sherlock.
Sherlock focused on breathing, and trying to temper the sighs and groans that burst out of him with hums of pleasure at the results. Finally, John sat back and said, “There. You’re as limp as boiled noodles. Most of you, anyway. Your trousers are looking a bit tight.”
“What on earth is the matter with you?” he said, as he followed Sherlock into their hotel room.
“Uh-huh. Well, let’s see. I could...” He made a ring of his thumb and forefinger and slid it over the head of his cock and gave a little twist. When Sherlock rose up to meet him, John pulled his hand away. Sherlock clenched his hands into fists and grunted in frustration.
“Ms. Adler,” he said, pretending to a calm he didn’t feel, “I cannot wait to hear about your spanking Sherlock, but first,” now turning to the proprietor of the arse under discussion, “you heard what the lady said. Lunch. You have a choice between Spaghetti w/Beef and Sauce, Brisket Entree, or Chicken Chunks.”
“Riiiiiight. Why don’t I just follow your lead?”
“Well, I just wanted to welcome you. I like to greet everyone who comes through the door, even if it’s a one time visit?”
“Yes, but at least they’re replaceable.”
“Stop it. I know what you’re doing and you need to stop it. Nobody could have done what you did and if you torture yourself like this, you won’t be able to keep on. I won’t let you. I’ll tell Greg to stop calling. You’re making yourself sick. You’re getting a migraine, aren’t you?”
“Don’t scoff,” John replied. “The research is very promising. You may be able to induce a relaxation response. You’re excellent at deducing, why not inducing?”
“Ah!” Irene grinned triumphantly, and reached into her cleavage, pulling out a slim thumb drive.  She inserted it into the side of the laptop and began clicking and dragging things. “You were right, it was one of those dates.”
Sherlock was a heavy weight across his lap. As he shifted his legs to accommodate, he felt something hard bump against his thigh. Shocked, he realized that Sherlock was aroused.
“Of course!”
“I can do that. I’m so grateful that you shared this with me, Sherlock. You really didn’t have to.” He took the full shaft into his mouth, moving up and down, building up friction. At the same time, he kneaded the soft, round globes of Sherlock’s arse. The reaction was even better than he expected.
Sherlock became aware that John’s foot massage was having an unintended effect. He was half hard inside his trousers, and each stroke up his arch—John had switched back to his left foot now—was causing heat to pool in his groin.
“This is different, Sherlock. It’s to do with sex.”
Irene smiled and seized the opportunity. “Why, Sherlock. Has John not yet learned to manage your behavior? That would explain a lot. No wonder the two of you are so grumpy all the time!”
“You don’t have to say anything. I’m sure you already know what I’m going to have to do.”
They interrupted one another and froze again. Finally John said, “Wow. You look amazing. I mean, considering the outfit and all. It looks great on you. I mean, you—“
John began to run his hands lightly over Sherlock’s chest, over his pectoral muscles, then down his ribcage and around his belly, repeating the pattern over and over as Sherlock’s cock twitched and swelled. He sucked in a breath and tilted his head to the side, nuzzling into the side of John’s neck, the scent of tea and crisp aftershave from the warm flesh wrapping around him like a blanket. When John started circling his nipples and skimming over them with his fingertips, Sherlock’s hips began twisting and he grabbed John’s hands.
“Probably not.” He rubbed his hands together to warm the lube, then encircled John’s cock, smearing the lube and covering every inch of it. When he was satisfied, he placed the head of it between the cheeks of his arse.
“Then don’t. Would only be a waste of time for both of us. Just focus on the polishing.”
“Now you can reward him a little,” Irene purred in his ear. Her breath was warm and he shivered as goosebumps prickled across his shoulders.
Mycroft sounded defensive. “I’ll have you know I’m drinking a high-protein yoghurt. I haven’t had time to eat a proper meal in days.”
“I know you’re considered some kind of carnal relations expert, Doctor ‘Seven Continents Watson,’ –“
His speech was cut off by the harsh light that streamed through the stained glass window atop the entranceway, as well as the
“And Sherlock, how often did we have one of our little get-togethers?”
Irene grabbed his hand and headed for the staircase, hurrying but trying to look casual.  He followed as fast as he could, with just one look back to check: yes, the guests were all looking at the door and the newcomer, and no one was paying attention to him and Irene.
John bent his head to nose at Sherlock’s cock, stiff and purple, as hot as the flesh under his hands. He gave the head an experimental lick.
John kept up the irregular rhythm and, as Irene predicted, John could feel Sherlock twitching and tensing, trying to anticipate the location of the next blow, trying to use his mighty brain to suss out an impossibly unpredictable lack of a pattern. John’s hand was heavy and the hairbrush fell over and over with more of a thud than the sharp smack that Irene delivered. And sure enough, once the great machine accepted its failure, Sherlock collapsed into a certain bonelessness and John knew the job had been successfully completed. He laid the hairbrush gently on the floor and let his hand rub the warm, pink skin.
“Nope.”
“Mycroft was quite useful, managing an invitation, but do you really think the nobility is ready to welcome Lord and Lord Castamere? The Lord and Lady will be far less conspicuous.” She raised an eyebrow at John again. “Rethinking our plan, are we?”
“What fetish gear do you think we can collect? We have handcuffs, rope. You have anything else up in the attic? Or should we go shopping?”
John nodded and turned to the instructor. He showed John how to remove the wax with the edge of a credit card. He thanked the man and waited for Sherlock to get up and replace his shirt.
“Come. I’d like to wash you.” Suddenly shy, he added, “I mean, if that’s all right…”
Sherlock would never admit it, but Mycroft had probably saved his life. He had only, as he described it, “relinquished authority and terminated the continuous surveillance of Priority Package One,” when John moved in and Mycroft handed the responsibility over to him. Although Sherlock was not completely convinced that there wasn’t a tracker embedded under his skin somewhere.
“Distract him,” Irene murmured low.
Sherlock squirmed.
He winced. There was a weird Doppler-like effect going on; Sherlock’s voice echoed oddly in his ear. He started to reach for the receiver.
Sherlock opened his mouth, but his answer was precluded by a gasp when John bit at the other nipple, then immediately soothed it with the same ice cube. Sherlock felt goosebumps rise on his skin, watched John chase them with the flat of his tongue, naked enjoyment on his face. “Oh, you’ve no idea how pretty you are,” he murmured.
“‘I think there’s leftover takeaway in the fridge. I’ll put it in the oven. You get in the shower and I’ll be there in a minute.”
He blinked at her, and then the penny dropped. “Listen,” he snapped, “Mary was not... I wasn’t… we didn’t….”
The medicine was beginning to take effect, and his limbs were beginning to feel heavy. He drifted, drowsing, until he felt something damp and cool placed across his eyes. He inhaled and the gentle scent of lavender tickled his nose, reminding him of summers spent at his grandmother’s estate in France.
“Listen,” he said, pulling his wallet out of his jacket pocket. He put a hand on the man’s back and turned him towards the door to the room, so the desk was solidly at his back. “What would it take for you to, ah, forget we were ever in here?” He opened the wallet and fingered two 100-lb notes.
Sherlock groaned and buried his face in his hands.
Sherlock lifted one shoulder in a half-hearted shrug.
They both looked expectantly at Irene, but she turned up her nose and said nothing. John shrugged at Sherlock and began to push two of the mattresses together. After a moment, Sherlock came over to help him.
“Your wedding,” she clarified.
John frowned up at him from where he was lying between his legs and reached up and tweaked his nipple hard. Sherlock hissed, the mingled pain and pleasure making his cock throb.
“Now?”
John chuckled. “One of us should turn it off then.”
After everyone had finished their ablutions and were lying in bed, Irene clacked quietly away on her computer for a while and then said, “Britain says it will take two days to sweep up quietly, or three to do it silently. Preference?”
John left the room muttering under his breath.
Sherlock jerked his chin and John replaced the phone on the bed next to Sherlock’s head. In a harsh whisper, Sherlock said, “You’re not to say a single word against Jo- against Sweden’s blog! It’s saved lives, very close to home, as it were, and it made an actual success out of certain incorrigibles. In the eyes of real people!”
He watched her sashay into the tiny shower, then turned his attention back to Sherlock, who hadn’t moved from his position over John’s lap. He ran his hand lightly up underneath his shirt and e down Sherlock’s back, lingering over the heated flesh of his rump. He felt more than heard Sherlock sigh in response, and a warmth began to pool in his groin.
“You said you trusted me.”
“Taken any good photographs?” Sherlock thought he could hear annoyance in Mycroft’s voice.
John stared at her for a moment and burst out laughing, loudly enough to cause Sherlock to grumble from under his sheet. They both hushed immediately, then glanced at each other.  John could tell that Irene was struggling as hard has he was to suppress her giggles.
“You’re right. And now?”
“How…?”
Sherlock heard John from a distance: “You kept them from blowing up three entire factories,” “explosions that could have wiped out entire blocks,” “an entire network of arsonists.” Bollocks. He countered each “entire” in his head. Three entire factories saved? Four entirely destroyed. Wiped out entire blocks? Seven entire families left homeless. Entire network? Entirely impossible to determine. How could anyone think the matter had been concluded successfully? How stupid were they all? Failed, he’d failed, he was too slow, he’d missed at least three details that would have saved…
Once they had finished with the legal business, they headed home. On the ride, the tension built until Sherlock was twitching harder than he ever had during any substance withdrawal. John sat still, jaw clenched and staring out the window.
A black limousine drove up. Sherlock was in the driver’s seat, still dressed as a waiter.  “Get in,” he snapped. John handed Irene into the back seat, then came around to the passenger side on the front.
“Please…” he whined.
“John. Lestrade has sent us a case…however I’m inclined to decline.” He grinned at his cleverness, but this was wordplay, but he didn’t realize it gave him away. It was a shell game and it meant he was trying to distract from something he didn’t want to address. John ignored the joke and reached for his computer; actually more like snatched it.
“Are you mad? Both of you?” He looked at Greg and pointed at Sherlock. “You really think this non...un…” He shook his head in frustration. “He? Will be able to function at a sex club? Let alone pass as a…patron? Or client? Or whatever they’re called?”
Wool retains little to no odor. Silk is far more absorbent. I say, “Experiment.”
Irene retrieved some loungewear from her suitcase and turned her back to them, then looked back over her shoulder. With a smirk, she asked, “Could one of you help me with this zipper?”  John got up and came over and unzipped her for the second time, and she shimmied out of the dress., Despite his best intentions, John licked his lips, appreciating the view, before he collected himself and turned away to see Sherlock watching him out of the corner of his eye.
“Seltzer, please.”
“Concerning…I don’t suppose you fancy returning?”
He stood up abruptly, rearranging his trousers and his shirt, which had ridden up. “Yes, Sir.”
He swallowed the retort he was about to make and, with a deep breath, handed her out of the car to the waiting doorman. The noise of the party flowed out of the massive doorway and eddied around him as he stepped out, giving his cuffs and his cummerbund a quick straighten. Irene smiled at him and held out her arm for him to take as they walked forward.
“I can guarantee that he hasn’t forgotten. Either your irritation is an inadequate deterrent or he’s being deliberately provocative.”
The DM gave Sherlock a cursory nod, but Sherlock kept his head down and only raised his eyes.
While he’d been adjusting to having his eyes uncovered, John had slid around to sit behind him, a leg on either side of him. Sherlock exhaled and relaxed back against John’s chest, tilting his head back until he could see the beloved face looking down at him, dark blue eyes and snub nose and crooked, beautiful mouth. John reached for the coffee on the table and held it to his own lips to test the temperature, then handed it over to Sherlock. “Just right. Here, drink.” He took a sip, then a long swallow. “You know why you’re gulping that, right? You’re dehydrated AND your blood sugar’s low. Both of which contribute to migraine.”
Sherlock popped up. “Sir?”
When we start downstairs, he says, “You’re going outside without your coat?”
“Different remedies work in different ways,” John said quietly. He was using his doctor voice, the one that could soothe small frightened children and irritable consulting detectives in pain. Now he was back to working on Sherlock’s right foot, sweeping firm strokes up Sherlock’s arch, and then cupping his heel in one hand and rubbing the back of his ankles with his fingers. Gooseflesh prickled across the back of his calves and thighs. “Some, like the cool cloths and the coffee, even this gooseflesh,” John drew his fingertips, ever so softly, tickling and spreading, up the sides of his ribs, “help to constrict your blood vessels.
“You know you can’t trust them, they’re into all sorts of …strange things. High-protein diets. Posting photographs of food. Voting.”
“Sorry,” John murmured. He slid his hands underneath Sherlock to cup his arse. “Guess that wasn’t as soft as I thought.”
“I don’t know,” she said.  Her eyes were wide with fear.  “But somehow they figured out where we were.”
“Didn’t stop me from being jealous, or being a bit of a prick about it.”  He gave Sherlock another kiss in apology.  “And Irene is… intoxicating,” he continued.  “But my heart belongs to you and you alone, now and forever.”
Sherlock’s nipples were aching and he could tell that John was taking a personal interest in monitoring their swelling and shrinking. “Let’s conduct a little experiment. Ice on one side, mouth on the other.”
“Insulted? Pfft. You with your cheekbones and turning your coat collar up so you look cool. Insulted my arse.”
“Let’s begin. How frequently would you say your mad genius has one of his black moods? Assuming there aren’t any cases, of course.”
“No. I have not been hiding them. This is not an international game of sardines.” He was quickly reaching the end of his patience with his brother.
“Here, yes. Not new to the scene.” They continued small talk while Sherlock scanned the dungeon, paying special attention to the men wearing glowing armbands. Sherlock tugged slightly on the leash and when John looked down, he pointed with his chin. John followed his gaze. “That’s a lot of dungeon masters for a club this size, no?”
His excitement ramped up to a manic level as the time drew closer, while John immersed himself in the details of the case, the BDSM community in London, and researching the latest club protocols.
Sherlock groaned, “Yes, thank you, doctor, I should drink more. And eat. I know.”
Irene tapped some more, then shook her head.  “Mm-mm.”
Where was I? I’ve lost my train of thought!  It’s unacceptable and it will not stand.
“All right. How many strokes, then?” He was almost nonchalant now.
Sherlock walked into the sitting room reading off the screen of John’s laptop.
Oh God, how humiliating. I’m lost.
Sherlock quirked his lip, then opened his mouth meekly, letting the bitter pill melt under his tongue. They rode the rest of the way quietly, John with one arm around him, scratching Sherlock’s scalp and combing his fingers through his hair.
“That will be hardly necessary. Your commitment to your role is admirable, Jo—I mean, Sir, but--.”
I breakfast with John, which raises his suspicions initially, but he is pleased by my toast consumption, so it passes. I explain that I have various trivial matters to attend to at The Yard and in the lab and bid him farewell at his usual hour. I put on a few patches to ward off temptation, tidy up the mind palace for a few hours and do a bit of quick research on the comparative odor retention of cotton, silk, and wool. Data trends are somewhat conclusive but woefully deficient. I plan several experiments for the lab. John has forbidden olfactory experimentation in the flat, even though the rotten eggs were clearly an accident. I’m off.
Sherlock ignored him and shut the laptop. “We’re expected at the Yard at four.” He looked looked at his watch. If we rush we can get ravioli. Might be the last time I eat for a while. Call Angelo.”
John exhaled and lowered the SIG to his side with a look at Sherlock.  “To what do we owe the honor of this visit? Is there a purpose?” he grumbled.
“More...” It was the barest breath of a whisper.
“Aren’t you supposed to call me Sir? I know I’m a novice, Sherlock, but I have picked up a few things on those three continents you’re always reminding me of. I think you might need a session on one of these…” he pointed vaguely at the furniture. “... things.”
John had applied both hands to his right foot, now, and was alternating strong sure strokes of his thumbs up Sherlock’s arch with firm tight circles on the top with his fingers. He stretched his toes out and John slid the fingers of one hand in between each of them, rubbing gently, and Sherlock thought he might actually explode from delight.
Irene came back to his side, slipping her arm into his, just as a shrill ting reverberated through the room, the sound of silver on crystal. All eyes rose to the top of the staircase, where Count Sabatier stood, resplendent in a crimson velvet smoking jacket. “My friends,” he announced in a booming voice, “be welcome! My home is yours. Eat, and drink, and—”
Before Sherlock could reply, someone hammered at the door.
“My...my cock.”
John lifted his chin and touched his lips to Sherlock’s. All the tension drained from his muscles and he sank into the kiss like slipping into a warm bath after a long hard day. John slid his fingers into Sherlock’s hair and said, “I very much liked taking you in hand last night, but I think I’d like just to get to know you this first time, Sherlock. Yeah?”
He was reeling a bit, squirming against the pressure in his trousers, but he took a breath and turned his head to see an older gentleman, holding some files in his hand, glaring at them.  “Sorry, old bean,” he said, trying to keep his voice even.  “We were just looking for a little privacy. We took the Count at his word, that whole, ‘My home is yours,’ thing.”
John waited. “Are you sure?”
Three-quarters of an hour later, he’d nearly finished the glass of wine, and his opinions on the role of the nobility in modern-day England had solidified into a plan for its overthrow. The conversations had been stultifying, endless rounds of wittering about taxes and tariffs, scandals and scarcity contingencies. Irene had thrown herself into the fray brilliantly, he grudgingly admitted, meaning that he had had to do little more than nod and hum affirmatively at her statements.
He was so relaxed, it took a mammoth effort to form words. “Head?”
“And the oven is still on.”
Irene clucked her tongue. “John, honestly, I thought the army would have prepared you for this type of insubordination. You’ve let him go on too far already. Watch me.”
They worked up an outline of a plan and arranged to run the operation two nights later, the night of the most popular BDSM party, Whiplash. Sherlock assured them that he would take care of the details, as usual, and left in a flourish.
John placed his hand on his back. “All right?”
“We agreed you’d eat at least every twelve hours. It makes me worry when you don’t take care of yourself.” A deep sigh.
I lay myself across his lap and feel the first swelling in my groin. He shifts his legs so there is no chance of my meeting with any friction. That will have to wait for later. Now, I resolve, I will focus on the experience I’ve worked so hard for.
“Come along, dear,” Irene said, crooking her elbow, and he took her arm and let her lead him around the room.
I have a plan. It will require exquisite timing and all of my dramatic skills. And a transgression that merits a spanking: smoking.
Sherlock answered, “Yes. One. Thank you, Sir.” The words came to him without thinking.
John cut him off sharply, whispering directly into his ear. “Enough. If we’re going to do this, let’s do it. You were the one who assured me that this would be no problem for you. You want to stay undercover? Obey your dom.” John widened his stance and grasped his hands behind his back. In a voice that would have made lieutenants tremble, he ordered, “Bend over the horse.”
They spent the next two hours speaking as seriously as they ever had about things they’d never mentioned before. Sherlock didn’t tell the whole truth and he knew John hadn’t either. It didn’t seem to matter much at that moment. All of a sudden it felt like they were starting over and had all the time in the world to discover new things about one another and that things would proceed in due course. By the time the sandwiches were down to crumbs, they couldn’t keep their eyes open. They were due at The Yard mid-afternoon for tying up the loose ends of the case and John, at least, needed sleep.
“How’s your head?” John murmured, fingers carding through Sherlock’s hair.
Sherlock looked at him, puzzled. He shrugged off John’s arm. “We don’t need cover anymore. I’ve solved the case, somewhere back around the...wax table. I sent the signal and Gary should be here--”
“Yes, Sir.” John looked up to see Sherlock looking back at him. After a moment, John continued and Sherlock waited patiently until the collar and leash were removed then lifted his shirt over his head. John casually took his hand and led him to the table. When he was settled, he arranged Sherlock’s arms so that they were crossed under his head.
Irene proceeded headlong into her description, moving fluidly around the room. “If he’d been on a case over the intervening period, his instructions were to keep track of his infractions, which included,” she ticked them off on her fingers, “making anyone cry, endangering himself or others, insults, and various other issues. The Detective Inspector would get in touch for anything particularly egregious.”
Sherlock was still shivering at those words, coming from John’s mouth, and heard the whistling noise a split second before the crop landed on the seat of his trousers. He breathed in sharply, more in surprise at the unexpected, almost surreal aspect of the situation he found himself in.
I shiver again and curl my face into his neck and he hugs me harder. I’m an idiot. But I’m still clever and I point out my advantage.
Sherlock stiffened but resisted the urge to stand up and look at him.
And what is that prickly feeling in my trousers when he says I’ve been a good boy? I do not blush. I have never blushed.
John whispered, “It’s a dangerous habit to finger loaded firearms in the pocket of one’s dressing-gown, Sherlock. We’ve discussed this." Muttering to himself, he continued, "Pointless. Why do I bother? Less frontal development than I should have expected."
“Oh come on, you know the answer to that.”
John tugged at his bowtie and sighed, eyeing the line of sleek black limousines curving up the driveway ahead of them. Warm golden light shone through the open door of the castle, which still looked miles away, no closer than the last time he had checked.
The man looked over at the desk and John’s heart sank. Then he felt Irene’s hand on his elbow.
“Can you hold off for a second? I’m going to take notes on my phone.” John began tapping away slowly.
Sherlock circled his stomach and followed the line of his abdomen down around his inner thigh. He came back up lifting his bollocks gently. John let his head thud softly against the tile wall. Sherlock ran the sponge back and forth a few times then around and up and down the length of his heavily hanging penis. John hummed and Sherlock looked up at him with a half-smile.
“Yes, Sir.”
“I don’t begrudge him a few complaints here and there. It’s one of his less annoying habits.”
He gives me a very insolent look and makes a rude noise. “Yeah, he is. He’s kept you in one piece hasn’t he? And he’s kept everybody else from killin’ ya. Berk.”
“Obviously. The punishment is for lying to get what you want, and yes, trying to trick me is lying, so no arguments.” He puts his finger over my mouth to keep me from speaking but I feel so calm and happy, I cannot be arsed to object.
John held up his hand and jangled the leash. Sherlock was stunned into silence. With his very sternest face and in his deepest brogue and burr, John said. “Haud you wheesht, lad. Scotsman, remember? Patron saint? The Scottish flag for chrissake. Saint Andrew’s Cross. Don’t you know the story?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“Oh, you think?” he asked, smiling to take the sting out of his words.  “What were you doing there, anyway?”
, John mouthed silently, and climbed up onto the bed.
Sherlock cut him off. “Try the date he inherited.”
Automatically, John said, “Greg.” He looked at Sherlock with affection. “Brilliant. You, I mean.” A puzzled look came over his face. “Wait. You knew on the wax table? And you let me keep on with the riding--”
Their next stop was a piece of furniture with two upholstered benches, one below the other. John gestured toward it and Sherlock responded, “Spanking bench.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and John straddled his hips, moving down his body slowly, kissing the line he’d drawn with his fingertips.
John muttered, “What’s an extra day when you’re among such splendid company?”  He rolled onto his side, pulling the blanket up around his shoulders, and fell into a restless sleep.
Inferno was as classic a dungeon as John might have been able to imagine, complete with hanging human sized bird-cages. John stopped at the front desk and stood, trying to take in all the sights of the club, The clerk was engrossed in a large textbook and Sherlock coughed loudly to get their attention. They looked up and held out their hand. John opened his wallet and  handed over a cash card that they had picked up from Lestrade earlier. The clerk took the card for a moment, but the machine appeared to reject it, so John inserted the plastic into the card reader. The lights on the machine flashed and emitted more beeps, but John was still transfixed by the dungeon floor. Sherlock stepped up beside him, careful to remain slightly behind his left shoulder.
“Now, down to business. Has Sherlock discussed our recreational activities with you, John?”
“Hmm. What if you lie on your front? Head to the side?”
“No, Sir. Ten is—doesn’t seem so many.”
“Hang on, don’t get your pants in a twist, I’ll be right back,” John said, the warmth in his voice belying the sharpness of his words.
His trousers and pants around his ankles now, Sherlock drew in a deep breath and stepped out of them. He turned around to face them with his eyes on the floor.
“I know, I know, it’s all I’ve got to hand right now,” John muttered. He heard a sloshing sound—presumably the cloth hitting the bowl of now-half-melted ice—and then John shifted them both so that Sherlock was curled up on his side against John’s chest, head resting on John’s good shoulder. John tugged the throw from the back of the couch and spread it over both of them.
Mycroft carried on, “No. Thought not. I thought not. Well, then, you’ve driven me to it. We are simply short of minds. No amount of quiet recruitment can compensate for our sheer dearth of numbers. We shall have to recruit…publicly.”
“And would you… I mean, when you were… when you and he…”
This rankles and I answer, “He’s not my keeper.”
“You’re left-handed aren’t you? You’ll want the brush in your dominant hand. Sherlock you have to face the other way.” Huffing in frustration, he got up and reversed himself. Both men shifted, trying to find comfortable positions.
“Is that him?” Mycroft exclaimed. “That’s him, isn’t it? Put him on the phone.”
In his younger, more self destructive days, Sherlock was a reckless regular, until that, combined with his other habits, put him at so much risk, and alarmed Mycroft so much, that he seized him, took him up and out of range of all temptation until he was judged capable of monitoring himself. Since those days, he had mainly kept to himself. It wasn’t easy to find a sub who topped, especially with a dom as demanding as Sherlock. And if he wasn’t floating comfortably above his usual disdain for the vast majority of humanity, he was bored out of his skull.
At eight p.m. John emerged from his room, to find Sherlock on the sofa. “Well, Sherlock, you were right. If this doesn’t shout dominance, I don’t know—“
Keeping Irene’s tips in mind, John administered his first spanking. “Do you usually keep count?” he asked her.
And then the equilibrium is shattered when I feel the hand pressed against my back slipping around to stroke my cock. I throw my head up and arch my back. I gasp his name and he answers, “Shh, I’m here.”
Sherlock ignored the question. How do you explain to your best mate that it makes you feel closer to him to be able to see his browsing history?
John stood, mouth open. “Wha--how--explain.”
“All right, all right.” Sherlock tilted John’s chin up and kissed him. He turned and shut off the water while John wrapped himself in a towel and held another out to him.
She clucked her tongue at him. “I wouldn’t tolerate it, John. I prefer to nip those little things in the bud, before they escalate. And the closer the correction comes to the behavior, the more effective it will be. Sherlock knows how to behave himself, and he’s perfectly capable, no matter how peevish he feels. Don’t let him fool you.”
He closed his eyes briefly. Why couldn’t people keep things in paper files anymore? “Have you got any suggestions?”
Sherlock shouted, “I don’t care--” but when John frowned at him, he lowered his voice. “However would make you happy, John.”
John walked to the side of the man with the candle and proceeded to take instruction on how to use the wax to create a sensory experience for the sub. John experimented on himself first and although there was an instant of pain, the wax cooled quickly. Nevertheless, he was tentative first, despite knowing Sherlock’s pain tolerance. The drops affected Sherlock much less than the man who had lain there before him and he was able to keep his eye on the floor. He was stoic, motionless, and the more wax that fell on him, the more he relaxed. After about ten minutes, John asked, “How was that, Pet?” There was no answer and John laid his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. There was no response and John took a firmer grip and shook it gently. “You didn’t fall asleep, did you?”
“I don’t care in the slightest with whom you copulate, little brother, but if you will not protect yourself, I will protect you. I’ll not have Mother weeping over your cold, lifeless transport, and blaming me for allowing you to take absurd risks. Therefore I will assume control over your physical well-being until you can be trusted with it yourself. “
Collapsing onto his back with his forearm thrown over his eyes, he mumbled something about “take care of you, now.”
Lestrade showed up smiling and thumped Sherlock on the back. “What’s that, a new record for you, Sherlock? You were inside there a little less than three hours!”
“Some distraction,” he muttered, and heard Irene chuckle.
John saw Sherlock watching him out of the corner of his eye, then quickly looking away so as not to be caught when John looked at him. “You’re saying that he actually knew that he was misbehaving?”
As they walked farther into the club, Sherlock said, “Do try to keep your mouth closed. You’re not supposed to be a tourist. Pretend you’re being brave for the troops.”
Sherlock glanced over at Irene, shaking his head more vigorously now.
“I don’t want to hear it, Sherlock.” He tapped his knee, emulating Irene’s earlier gesture.
Sherlock nodded, then said, “Yes, Sir.”
“Darling, perhaps we’d better go. I think we’ve had enough excitement for one night.” Her eyes twinkled at him as she snapped her clutch closed.
“No worrying about me, you’ll waste all those lovely hormones. Sleep now.”
He sighs. I must remain steadfast. I try to avoid looking at him, but I fail. He looks very sad and my impulse is to blurt out the truth, but I pinch my leg and remind myself: end goal.
“Agreed on what? You harassing me, haranguing me, trying to bash your way into my—” He cut off with a choked sob and hunched over. John slid his arm around his shoulder and pulled him to his chest. Sherlock felt even worse. Here he was, an obnoxious, childish, ungrateful—
Sherlock mumbled, “Everything feels good, John. So good.”
Sherlock mumbled under his breath and Irene cleared her throat in John’s direction. “Speak up, please, Sherlock. John can’t hear you.”
They made their way downstairs and through the crowd.  The celebration had reached a fever pitch and it was slow going, but they managed to reach the foyer, where Irene retrieved her stole, and then were out the door and standing on the stoop in the chill night.
Innocent lives. Saved property. Genius, amazing, bollocks. The shrieking of the words set his teeth on edge. He tried to still his twitching, knowing that John, bloody, brilliant John, was just beginning to see the tension worming its way out of his gut and crawling up, over his shoulders and knotting the muscles of his neck. He could hear the rushing, seashell sound in his ears, advanced warning of the migraine now stalking him. Soon he’d feel the point of the spike drilling into his temple, letting too much light into his skull.
Sherlock opened his mouth, and Irene held up a finger. “Not. A. Word. And now you have forty-five seconds.”
“Well? How was it for you? he said. “Not your usual cup of tea, eh? Like the outfit.”
For the August 2018 Twitter challenge from fin_amour, “beard”
Mycroft asked uncertainly, “Are you still there? Bolivia?”
He scrambled to his feet and tried one more time. “John--”
Sherlock devoured the case file, then interrogated Lestrade for the details he felt he were missing. John took notes and made copies of the pages Sherlock had marked. There was very little more than what Sherlock had summarized. The coat check and bartenders and were on cctv, and not under suspicion, but he and Greg came to the same conclusion: the case would be solved most quickly if Sherlock and John went undercover.
John turned as Irene barreled through the connecting door, still in her dress, a small netbook open and balanced on one hand.  “We’ve got to get out of here,” she said.  “Moriarty’s agents are approaching the hotel.”
Sherlock stared back at him, eyes glazing over. Dreamily, he murmured, “Daddy. Daddy?”
“Ahhh, Sherlock, I can’t…”
When they broke apart, Sherlock was looking at him with starry eyes, and the flush had spread down his cheeks and neck.  “I…I  may have jumped to conclusions,” he said, his voice a low velvet rumble.
He says, “Not yet, no. Soon.”
“Do you even hear yourself, John?” Sherlock sniped, seeming to have momentarily regained his normal imperiousness. “Chicken chunks? Are you actually expecting me to eat something called chicken chunks?”
“Noted. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been drawn into a ridiculous argument and forgotten what I asked him to do in the first place.”
“Being very intelligent people you may be able to deduce what it is,” she said.  She looked both of them up and down, smiling when John, still naked, stepped behind Sherlock. Then she opened her purse, pulled out a mobile and pushed a single button. “Kazakhstan here.  They’re fine, both of them.” She gave John a wink. “Exquisite, actually.”
"Do you remember Reichenbach?" Suddenly, the doctor is far more awake. His arms, despite their apparent heaviness, wind around the genius' back in a comforting way, drawing him nearer.
"Here's your tea, Molly," he said, dropping off a tall cup. It seemed odd, being out of the morgue and the labs and not being the one to
"I can always say that two girls arrived in my house in the middle of the night. It was dark, and they attacked me when I was in bed, hoping to steal my manuscript for themselves. Luckily, I disposed of them during the attack and was able to escape. Self defense, extraordinary circumstances." Rosie's eyes narrowed as he lunged, a bullet flying loose. Reyna narrowly dove behind the desk before throwing the closest object within reach, which was a bulky lamp, in his direction. He yelped at the offending light fixture hit him squarely on the jaw.
"Well just don't
"I do, for some reason. Haven't quite figured it out yet." He was smiling brightly.
"Oh, here's the good part! I love this episode," the teenager sighed, burying her face into Molly's shoulder and the couch cushions. "Ten is great."
"Good, then, you are capable of making comebacks. I was beginning to wonder."
The next thirty minutes until the police actually showed up were a blur. They both pretended that tying a man up in his own bedsheets and locating and cracking a private safe ("It's super easy if you set your mind to it, Rey." "No it's not, how did you

"Look, just look," she squealed, shoving the computer at Rosamund's lap with ferocity. Confused, the young Watson surveyed the page, coming to the bottom for a second time. Her eyes widened.
So, it's a new hospital, only open for about five months at most. Now it's only a matter of
"Ready to go, Sherlock?"
John, do you recognize how precarious a position that would put our dynamic in?"
"Rubbish. You wouldn't go out for a stroll if your life depended on it. You enjoy cakes far too much," he muttered lowly, turning towards his companion. "John, I believe Lestrade wants us down at the station. There's work to be done." John sighed, already foreseeing the obvious conclusion, while Mycroft blinked.
"I've no idea," Sherlock simply replied instead of giving an actual response, flicking out his violin and setting down the cup. "Mind if I play for a bit?" John, surprised that Sherlock would ever ask permission for anything having to do with his music, merely smiled once the shock has set in.
"And since you know, Rose, that the term red herring wasn't conceived until 1805 - "
"Don't act so surprised, Holmes," Lestrade chuckled, letting a small smile encompass his lips as he let himself out. "Aren't you her dad, too?"
Damn it all. There are too many hormones. Too difficult to predict the outcome.
"How droll." John snorted, re-situating himself into something more comfortable, an arm lazily thrown across his companion's shoulders.
"So, you and Dad made out," the official teenager starts - being thirteen
"You could, but the explanation might take longer than it is worth repeating. You'd almost certainly get lost in the fine details," he mused, waving him off and sipping the tea. It actually was quite good - perhaps he'll go along with John's favoritism of the branding, just this once.
There were only a grand total of fifteen people at the ceremony, positioned on wooden benches beneath the rickety pergola. Mycroft, the one exception to this rule and number sixteen, stood up, refusing to sit, and remained off to the side, watching the proceedings with a casual fondness. In the left wing, there was Mr. and Mrs. Watson, Rosamund and Reyna, as they were inseperable, Mike, Sarah, Harriet and Clara (they had, miraculously, been available at the last possible moment and had flown in just for the wedding - Harry even seemed to be sober this time, and Molly didn't doubt for a second that this had to do with Clara coming back into her life), and another two friends from the hospital. The right side, containing the smaller Holmes party, lied Ms. Hudson, Mr. and Mrs. Holmes, Billy Wiggins, and then, of course, Greg and Molly Lestrade themselves. A sparse population, save the officiator, but it worked. Only those who were immensely important were present, just the way the two men would have wanted (Rosamund herself had wanted another guest, Bailey the malamute, but John had firmly turned her down - the dog would have been an absolute nuisance in a cab). The only music came from classical violin recordings, many of those directly from Sherlock's endeavors in their own flat, and as the garden was already filled with flowers - it was a
What a curious phrase.
This couldn't be reality, for she wasn't even certain the men in her life knew how to cook at all, let alone prepare entire meals without supervision. There was a reason Rosamund struck out on her own when it came to food. Anything Sherlock even attempted to produce could hardly be deemed edible, anyhow.
It was little things like these that had made the dark haired man fall for his partner in the first place, as odd as it sounded.
"Obviously, one day. It's the inevitable conclusion to a long term, serious relationship." For once, though she couldn't quite tell, Rosie swore her Dad was blushing, or at the very least flustered.

"Henderson was hardly a criminal mastermind, John, and Rosamund sees us do this every single day. Have a little faith; she's more capable than we'd like to admit. What do you think she'll be doing for a living when she's a fully functioning adult?"
"Great. Friday, then, after work?"
"We can share. You know that, right?"
Uncle Mycroft isn't around too often, but Rosie loves it when he is. He's no good with people - he's
There are salty, surprised tears streaking down John's cheeks, and for the first few seconds everything tastes like saline. And then, he molds to the surface, learning the dips and curves of his partner's mouth, trying to memorize what it feels like to press against him like this. Then, there is tea leaves, a sweet undertone in contrast to the bitter, stinging drops of before, and traces of spearmint from a stick of gum, and it is a unique yet enticing taste.
In other words, Rosamund had taken every possible precaution to ensure that Sherlock wouldn't have a distraction, and therefore an excuse to dodge the question.
And love. That is something often associated with the inexplicable as well.
"As if anybody in London could stop you from playing. Where was that question at four this morning?" The detective grinned back, relaxing all of his numerous features, and he appeared years younger.
Molly's not entirely sure how she ended up where she is now. Only a few years ago, she was still single. She was doing the same job as she had the last two decades of her life. She was 'babysitting' Rosamund whenever she was required.
This was appropriate, considering how often she ended up babysitting.
"Fair enough. And where's Rosie?"
seriously just knock him out cold? That was pretty damn brilliant, Rosie. Like, the most badass thing I've ever seen anybody do."
was on their side, silently trying to instigate an intervention without actually instigating an intervention.
and a hardy faith in her abilities have been thoughtfully nurtured.
Rosamund honestly had no idea what to do. She was a great aim, but Henderson still had a gun without the safety on. A surprise bullet to the the leg might prompt an itchy trigger finger of his own, and that would almost certainly hit Reyna. And that was assuming he wouldn't move last minute - the way he and her best friend were struggling on the floor was chaotic, unpredictable, and if Reyna rolled over she could easily get caught in the crossfire.
die, actually, and we're still together. If we can make it through that, I doubt the rigors of marriage are going to stop us." Sherlock smiled, faintly, and John laughed. "So, instead of talking about how great you are, I'm going to talk about how great you've made me. I would be dead about a thousand times over if you hadn't been there alongside me. I wouldn't have had nearly as much success, and I certainly would have relapsed. Unfortunate, but no doubt true - you were the anchor that grounded me, that told me to pick up my messes, that forced tea and sandwiches down my throat, that made sure I actually slept occasionally. I would never have been anything
"You guys can watch me play together!" Rosamund tells them when she makes the team - she's always had a way of picking things up effortlessly, and rugby tryouts turned out to be no different. John, who was quite the rugby player back in high school and uni, beams at his daughter like she's just invented the cure for cancer, and Sherlock nods and says something along the lines of 'sports are wonderful for blood flow', which is technically approval. Molly, of course, simply hugged the blonde preteen and muttered, "I knew you could do it," into her ear.
It turns out that sports matches can be interesting, after all.
So he's the injured sop in this scenario. That rarely happens.
, after all - there were barely any arrangements, and where they were present, the buds were white and simple.
"I'm not going to say any of that because everyone already knows those things. And honestly, John, if I didn't see anything in you we wouldn't have been friends in the first place, let alone been here today." Alright, that was better. "In sickness and in health, death do we part - we've lived that already. There's no point in restating it, though we will in just a moment. I
"You were
"It's not so much a date as it is us eating outside the house. We're just getting some thai," he said, tugging at his sleeves. "I mean, we're not exactly made for romance. I just got off work, got cleaned up, and - "
And then he knew: those feelings that tormented him in the night -- he could name them.  It was love.
Sherlock made a noncommittal sound and shrugged.  John cocked a brow, but didn't pry.  He settled in his armchair, across from his flatmate, and thumbed through his book.
The cabbie stopped outside Baker Street and they stepped out.  Sherlock stopped John outside the front door.
anything." He sucked in a steadying breath.  "Mostly, I wondered if I would see you again if I . . . if I died."
With that, he left, striding purposefully to the door.
The doctor laughed at that, a cold, rueful one.  “Yeah.
John sighed again.  "You almost got yourself
Aaaand I am now on Tumblr, aspontaneouswritingpineapple.  I don't know that I'll post a whole lot of fanfiction-type things, but there will be some. Primarily OCs and responses for writing prompts.
"I know that as well as you, but we both know how he is.  I must ask you to help him recover from this, as much as he helps you to recover as well."
There was a distinct wail of sirens, and John could have laughed.  They were only -what - four blocks from the Yard?  Why bother with the cars at all?
The detective swallowed, tightening his jaw.  "Of course.  Why wouldn't it be?"  It wasn't really a question, he supposed, but a way to keep John talking, keep the conversation going.
The detective offered only a vague sound and a shrug.  John rolled his eyes and went back to his room to read.
"It's no worry, dear. Happy to help.  Oh, and Sherlock, I got your honey.  But they were out of your tea."
There was a lengthy pause, and John knew he'd said either the perfectly right thing, or the exactly wrong one.  He was beginning to regret starting a conversation with the man in the first place.
Of course he was angry.  Sherlock had almost gotten himself
I HOPE to update once a week, probably Thursdays, but honestly I have no idea. We'll see what happens and I'll try to keep you up to date on my inner monologues.
And his mind went horribly, utterly, totally and completely
Sherlock hesitated again, but pressed on.  "What of?"
Sherlock frowned.  John was lying.  And he wasn't trying very hard to hide it.  It had something to do with his fall, that much was obvious.  He couldn't figure it out, and it bothered him immensely.  He decided to try again. "John, something is obviously bothering you.  What is it?"
John rolled his eyes.  Mycroft had been checking in on him with obnoxious frequency.  Lestrade’s doing, he supposed.  The elder Holmes -- the
Surprise lit her face.  "
"Sherlock, I'm
him.  Asked ‘im out on our first case, sorta.  Turned me down, ‘married to the Work’ and all that shite.”
"Brother mine, may I have a word with our dear doctor?"  Mycroft's voice floated naggingly from the door.  Sherlock turned to scowl at him, and Mycroft sighed.  "Won't be but a moment, Sherlock."
A shake of a blond mop.  “No. I
"Sherlock will blame himself for this, you must know.  He will blame Scotland Yard first, of course, then the criminal, but ultimately, the guilt - in his eyes - will fall to him."
John scowled and typed back angrily:
"Don't
John frowned.  What was Sherlock up to?
"Breakfast?"
John nodded.  "Fine, yeah. Thanks." He sighed, knowing that with Mycroft, a greeting was rarely only that.  "What d'you need?"
Sherlock's eyes widened and fear unfolded across his features.  He was at John's side in an instant.  "Where the
expertise? On what?"
The shower was fine.  It was after, with the temperature difference and the fact that he hadn't eaten anything substantial since breakfast the day before, that he stumbled and fell.  Sherlock was up and at his side in an instant.
John didn't answer for a long time, and he started to wonder if he'd even heard the question.  "Everything is fine, Sherlock."
"See? Almost here. I'll be-" John had to fight off the black spots again.  "I'll be fine, Sher-"  And this time he couldn't win, and the blackness took him and his grip on Sherlock's hand loosened and his fingers fell.
John woke far later than normal, to the sun prodding him through the window.  He groaned tiredly and turned on his side.  He sighed and slowly dragged himself out of bed and hobbled down the steps to the kitchen.
"John," the detective whispered hoarsely.   "I . . . I am so sorry, John."
With that, the conversation was over, and John silently rejoiced.  Conversing with Mycroft was always mentally exhausting and emotionally frustrating, moreso then than before.  With a sigh, he tapped out another message on his mobile and grabbed his coat.
"Here, John. I'm here."  Sherlock murmured hoarsely, gripping John's fingers just a little too tight.
He scowled at her.  "What do I
John rolled his eyes, but accepted that he would get no more information from the man.  He set about preparing to show Sherlock what he wanted to know, shambling about the flat collecting the necessary supplies.  "Where were you?" he asked, setting his medical bag down on the table.
He felt his cheeks warming and he turned his head to the floor.
He couldn't just see someone's guilt from their stride, like Sherlock could.
"John . . . I'm not good at these things.  I don't know how to give you the affection you desire." Sherlock's face folded into concern and fear.  "I want you to be happy, John, but I don't know how to do this."
“I’m not sure if I should be relieved or insulted.”
He stood up at parade rest. “That will be enough for the moment, Sherlock. Take your seat, please.”
“No,” Irene said, her eyes twinkling, “he preferred to take care of that himself.” She smiled at John. “But he’s all yours now, isn’t he, now that you’re here…”
“I’m more interested in his armband. Did you notice--of course not. You’re oblivious to--I mean...You’re more of a… Sorry, Sir. His is red and so are about half of the others. But a substantial number are green.”
Relief at their narrow escape flooded him and he giggled, feeling light and dizzy.  Then he glanced over at Sherlock, who was gripping the wheel of the limo, eyes grimly fixed on the road ahead.
“Never mind. Just follow my lead.”
During breakfast on the morning of the undercover, Sherlock said, “I suppose we should discuss how this evening is going to play out. And we should probably talk about limits, if you’re going to play the part of a dom.”
“Nothing.”
Despite John’s admonition, Sherlock held off until he felt John’s breathing slow and lengthen in sleep, and then he drifted off against him, content.
The maddening slide of his fist has me thrusting and panting, while he never slows in covering my arse with the heat of his hand. I hear cries and don’t connect them to my own actions. Just as I think I cannot bear the impact of one more blow, he begins to rub instead and speeds up the stroking of my cock and I come and come and come, shaking until he soothes me to stillness. Then he draws me up to sit, gently on his lap, holding me close and whispering nonsense that fills a hole inside me.
John’s fingers were in his hair again, rubbing his scalp gently. He tried to say something but could only exhale. He heard John chuckle and then his fingers were gone. Moaning in protest, he reached out a hand, wiggling his fingers in what he hoped was a beseeching yet dignified way.
“Tell me the details if you’re not going to let me read them for myself.”
Sherlock sucked in a breath and attempted to answer his brother. “No, it’s been… it’s been raining, and… we, we haven’t got any stamps, and….”
“Hmm. What?”
“No,” Sherlock replied, “but he’s famous for not making an appearance until later.”
“Mm.”
The bartender, happy to chat, said, “Well, like I said, it’s early. And at this party the crowd can get a little, maybe, not quite out of hand, but let’s say there will be a lot of energy flowing once things really get started.”
John watched closely as Sherlock looked up at him, then swallowed, cleared his throat, and croaked out, “Yes, Sir. Sorry, Sir.”
They wandered slowly, pausing first at a large wooden X fitted with eye-hooks along each upper branch. Sherlock began, “This is—“
Irene went and whispered in John’s ear. “Captain Watson. Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers.”
Sherlock was gripping the sides of the seat of his chair, shaking his head back and forth slightly.
John preceded Sherlock into the flat and said, “How about prawns for--”
“I mean,” he took a deep breath, “Could you repeat that, sir?”
“That sounds lovely.” He stepped over the edge, Sherlock taking the sprayer and wetting him down, head to foot. He used his own shampoo and lathered up John’s short, coarse hair. He took the large soft sponge and gently worked it over his body in small circles. He slid the sponge up along his ribs and lifted his arms to get underneath eventually reaching around in a pseudo-hug to clean his back and when he reached his arse, he began to lower himself to his knees.
A cab! The enclosed space will preserve the odor. Brilliant! I will sit in a cab outside Baker Street and await John’s arrival. I must be at the door and allow him to come close enough to smell the smoke, which will, I hope, still be pervasive. I will have to take care not to actually lie. Is the failure to correct an inaccurate assumption lying? I will ask for clarification later. He will be disappointed, but after the spanking, I will be forgiven. I will decide later on whether to reveal the whole truth. John might even be pleased with me for resisting temptation and call me his good boy!
“This is opening up a whole new world for me. For us,” he said lightly as he ran his hands over Sherlock’s chest and sides, luxuriating in the feel of lean muscles and smooth skin under his fingers.
Sherlock watched John set his watch for five minutes, and then apply ice to one nipple while lapping and pinching the other. “Of course,” he said, looking up at Sherlock with a wicked grin, “for the testing to be reliable, I’ll have to replicate the conditions on each side.”
“Yes, yes. To the point, then,” Mycroft said quickly. “Certain cells of the network have gone rather…quiet. They’re not with you by any chance?”
Sherlock paused for a moment longer then said, “Yes, well enough showing off, let’s get going. I want to be there early enough to observe the dungeon masters before the crowd gets too...well, let's say rumbustious.” He picked up a large, tightly packed knapsack, the handle of his crop poking out at the top.
John sat back with a serious frown. “You say that now, but let’s not forget one of my favorites...” He bent at the waist and took the whole pink head into his mouth, engulfing Sherlock in soft, wet, heat.
Irene looked positively gleeful. “Aren’t you excited, Sherlock? I have missed our time together and this is just perfect that we get to share our memories with your boyfriend.”
“Anything for your pet?”
Quietly, John said, “It looks like a low risk activity for us to try. To be convincing I mean. ”
I feel so remorseful that I’m no longer relying on my dramatic skills. “John, I…I don’t know what to say.”
“Now, before you start, always have him recite the reasons he’s being punished. And try to use the word spanking as much as you can. He hates it. I recommend that we address the strop from earlier. If you can convince him that you mean business, you may not ever have a razor problem again.”
Oh, God, yes. I’ve done it. End goal. I allow my anticipation to present itself as anxiety and the rest of the ride home is silent.
“Ahh. But there are so many options. How exactly?”
“Fantastic,” he replied. “How are we supposed to get up there?”
John choked back a laugh. “Sherlock! Yes or no? I can’t hold off much longer!”
“Could you give us a moment?” he asked, motioning at Irene’s state of undress.
“Is he always this restless?” Irene said aloud.
Lifting the knapsack from Sherlock’s shoulder, he asked, “Why don’t you show me?”
John flipped through the sheets. “I don’t know why you didn’t bring this up sooner. We should have practiced or something.”
The noise of the party grew louder, and John realized that the distraction was over and the festivities were continuing.  He heard footsteps approaching, a measured, careful tread. “Someone’s coming!” he hissed.
John smiled. “I like cleaning up
“That might work. The Firemaster may have been hired by the club to give demonstrations. Ask if he’d mind giving you a few tips.”
When he entered the loo, Sherlock was waiting in the shower, hot water filling the room with steam.
“I said, don’t be stupid. Or more stupid than absolutely necessary. If he would pick up the phone, I would call him!”  Mycroft’s voice sounded tinny and distant.
The rapid breathing continued. “Ten, Sir.”
John stripped himself with astonishing efficiency, then gripping his own cock in his fist. Sherlock heard John grunt and knew he was close, so close to his own release. “Good, good boy, stay with me. Does anything hurt? Sherlock, does anything hurt?” He gripped Sherlock’s curls and jostled his head a little. “Does anything hurt, Sherlock?”
“Mmm.”
“Sorry, we’ll just have to wait for them to return to baseline, Sherlock. What shall we do while we wait?” He narrowed his eyes at him and it sent shivers down Sherlock’s spine. John put the ice bucket back on the nightstand and settled on his knees between Sherlock’s legs. “Any ideas?”
“That’s a good boy.”
“A surprise guest!” Sabatier cried.  He was smiling, but his eyes had a dangerous look about them. He motioned to the three men John had noted earlier and strode down the stairs and into the foyer. The party guests milled after him, curious stares and whispers running through the crowd like lightning.
“Oh, it’s early yet. Things don’t really get started till twelve or twelve-thirty. This your first time?”
Still grinning, John thumbed the phone off with one hand and with the other, slid the ice cube up Sherlock’s chest to his collarbone.  Sherlock gasped, twisting against his bonds involuntarily, his heels scrabbling on the bedsheets.
When John unlocked the door, Mrs Hudson popped her head out. “Well, that was quick! Come in and tell--”
Sherlock groaned. He hated it when John put on his inquisitor persona like this. It was torture trying to coordinate his brain and mouth to answer questions, when all he wanted to do was surrender to the sensations.
Sherlock exhaled.  “Fine.”  He went to the closet and pulled out John’s duffel, started packing clothes into it.  “I’m assuming that you’d rather be over in the other suite with Irene--”
“The card, John. They're asking you to swipe it now.”
John was slightly startled. He had adopted a completely hands-off approach to his flatmate after the first few times he'd flinched at John’s casual touch. It was difficult for him to hold back because he was usually physically affectionate, not just with his romantic interests, but family, friends, anyone who gave consent. He was just cuddly. Sherlock, on the other hand walked through the world like some kind of bristled creature, subconsciously transmitting the confidence  of a porcupine: touch at your own risk. And now, here he was, practically rubbing himself against the hand (of his flatmate!) resting on his head. John shrugged internally. If there were ever a time to live in the moment, this was it. He scratched Sherlock’s scalp gently. He was rewarded with small movements that were more like a cat than a porcupine. After a few moments, John realized that the movements facilitated Sherlock’s observations of the room. Eventually, Sherlock looked up at him to give his next set of instructions.
John bucked up and cut Sherlock off abruptly. He pushed up and into him, at the same time, tightening his grip and beginning to pump in earnest. It didn’t take long and Sherlock came first, head back and spurting come over John’s chest. When he looked again at John, it seemed it was the sight of Sherlock abandoning himself to his pleasure that sent John over the edge, more than the crescendo of physical sensation. Sherlock stayed upright until he was sure that John had experienced the fullness of his climax and allowed him to soften inside of him. Then, ignoring the come, he collapsed onto John’s chest.
