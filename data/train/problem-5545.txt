Natasha frowned because she’d heard the speech front to back, left to right, up and down a dozen times and she’d never strayed from the script.
“Sending the first group of people down now! Iron Man, can you-?”
But if she tried hard enough she could almost convince herself that she was doing it for herself and not for her parents’ killer.
“No,” she said, shaking her head and opening the door. “That was all you. I dig it.” With one last, fleeting smile, she jumped out of the car and ran towards Happy.
She twisted to look over her shoulder, glaring as she saw them all standing there, eyeing them one by one. Her frown deepened and her shoulders rose defensively, like someone caught in an ambush.
“Please come back.”
Barnes. Why do you hate him so much?”
He let out a soft breath, trying to ease the pressure in his throat.
Then there’d been the guy in the red cape with the glowing hands, the one who somehow managed to contain an entire explosion within what looked to be a globe made of green light.
“Yes,” she answered truthfully, even though the words felt like the worst betrayal as the image of a metal hand closing around her mother’s throat played itself in an endless loop behind her eyes. She wanted to be sick. “Why does how I feel about him matter to you so much?”
He blinked rapidly and turned to find Stark gazing not at him but at the arm, which he was holding up in front of him.
“I count on what I know. Rhodey, Vision, FRIDAY. I count on Pepper to run my company. I count on aliens falling out of the sky to kill us all.” She smirked at the young king, and it was bitter and cruel. “That’s what I count on the most.”
And Steve. Steve couldn’t… Not a second goddamn time. He just
She stood a little straighter and plastered on her best polite smile as T’Challa came to a stop in front of her.

Hopefully she wouldn't have to deal with Secretary Fucking Ross until a time when it really counted. And at that point, she would
“But you
A breathless laugh that was a decibel away from a sob escaped his throat as he took another step.
To their credit they didn’t ask if she was okay; she was simply herded back to the auditorium with a slightly more imposing group of bodyguards. They all knew this was going to happen eventually. She was just glad Ross hadn’t decided to pay a visit to the Compound because she doubted she could’ve slotted in any extra time to improve security in between working on Rhodey’s twenty-fifth prototype, the Accords, and B.A.R.F.’s recalibrations.
“Hey,” he murmured as he came up beside them. “Hi Colonel. Nice to see you again. Those’re some sweet braces.”

As they slid into their chairs, the glass walls clouded over, blocking his view of the outside.

Toni grit her teeth, squeezing the tablet under one arm as she stopped several feet away from the door, her insides twisting unpleasantly at the need, the
“Be on standby; he may be injured. You have everything you need?”
He arched an eyebrow in her direction.
“Whoa, hey, easy. Not that kind of doctor,” she said, holding him back down which might have been difficult had he not been in pain. “You’re coming with me to the Compound. Get you looked over there by Black Panther’s sister, Shuri. She’s awesome, you’ll like her. Hell of a genius. You guys’ll have a lot to talk about.”
And that was that!
“Kamala Khan. She and Mr. Keener started coming to the Compound around the same time as far as I can remember. They usually hang out in the West Wing with Ms. Stark and the other Avengers.” She stilled, face coloring awkwardly. “Uh, I mean—”
Cloak - as Peter and Shuri and now Vision had taken to calling it - hovered just over her shoulder, slotting himself - because according to Stephen it was male - into the space between where she and Stephen sat. The red collar tilted itself slowly from side to side and Toni took a moment to really come to terms with the fact that she was being studied very thoroughly by a sentient piece of
“I can’t wait,” she whispered, then caught sight of the HR lady’s irate glare and cleared her throat. “You’ll be right here?”
It was so incredibly
Laura nodded and grit her teeth for a second before forcing out her next words. “Where’s he now?”
. Whose hands would you trust? Who would you look to to protect everything that you hold dear? You trusted the Avengers once.”
The weight of more than a hundred and fifty eyes on her should’ve been something she was used to. She’d done speeches at colleges, at her expos and she’d had enough experience with politicians and and savage journalists to have built skin stronger than adamantium.
And no hero-ing. If you’re in trouble you call one of us,” was all she offered and something in Harley’s shoulders gave way to relief.

“Oh, right, introductions. I’m Doctor Strange, former neurosurgeon, currently a sorcerer and recently-appointed Master of the New York Sanctum. Hence, my appearance here.” She twisted her head to look at him and he had the gall to fucking
Toni’s arm automatically tightened around Vision’s. She remembered how she’d found him, digging himself out of the hole that Wanda had put him in, and her heart clenched painfully. Because Vision may not have been hers. But he also kind of was.
He tapped his temple with an index finger. “Eidetic memory.”
set Steve’s teeth on edge.
“Dummy is about as intimidating as a kitten wearing socks. He is heavy, though, so watch out for your—”
Her fingers massaged a sore spot above her sternum. “But what if...what if the pieces just don’t fit? And the things that were holding it together have weakened so much that… Or what if,” she continued, her voice softening, “what if there was one problem all along. A runaway cog that threw everything else out of whack. Something that...something that needs to be replaced?”

Not just for him but for you as well.” She shrugged again. “I think you may be creating something beautiful and precious out of fear and chaos. You just...might not see it for a while.”
Her gloved fingers stilled. She didn’t know how Laura had done it, kept the secret for this long but a part of her had hoped that just for a little longer, she could’ve pretended.
“Is it working?”
thing,” Peter said solemnly, holding his hand over his heart and Toni nodded earnestly.
“Well,” she said, raising her near empty mug, “be thankful there’s only two of them.”
Her eyes widened in horror as if he had just struck her, and as he took a step forward she took one back, her tight fist pressing into the center of her chest.
When she went back inside Lila dragged her over to the kitchen table and forced her to watch flower arrangement videos with her on YouTube.
, and all she had was herself, a barely put-together group of heroes and the best legal team that Toni could ask for, to deal with the onslaught.
T’Challa studied her face and her words, nodding slowly. “Why didn’t you go to see him in person?” When it was so painfully obvious she wanted to.
she thought, with no small amount of indignation. She deserved to know more than what little Clint had relayed to her.
I see him again.” She didn’t offer any more; she didn’t need to.
— that cut him right to the core —
So then there was B.A.R.F.. And Shuri. And Vision. And hours upon hours in Toni’s lab, which she’d had to extend and partition off just to hold the machine the size of fucking Alaska. It wasn’t just one machine, though. It
He sat in the plush club chair while she lay on the bed and spent another hour pretending he didn’t know she was awake.
He wanted to believe. God, he wanted to believe so badly, but it was so hard to look past everything that went wrong, everything that they’d done, everything he wished he could take back.
Barton swallowed and took one step forward but no more.

Bucky gave him a playful wince. “Yeouch.”

“I’ll take that under advisement.” Laura grinned, tossing a torn bit of kale over her shoulder. “You said...you said
T’Challa eyed her warily then nodded slowly. “I will see it done. Perhaps Natasha can be the liaison.”
“Open and close your fingers?” she murmured softly, her eyes cataloguing every movement as he complied, marveling at the feeling of control even if it was without the physical sensation. Then she twisted her head over her shoulder and looked at Vision, who analyzed the readings then nodded, his own smile spreading across his face.
Nat was sending him a despairing glare over the top of Toni’s head and Bucky cursed under his breath, turning away in embarrassment or frustration. Steve couldn’t blame him and his ears burned in humiliation because
“Static,” she stuttered, convincing no one as she started walking away towards one of her screens and tapping something - it might even have just been nonsense - onto the holographic keyboard beneath. She cleared her throat, then continued in a clearer voice, “We’ll have to monitor...function and efficiency for a while. Durability too. We’ll do some tests over the next few weeks just to make sure your body’s adapting. I’ll have the list of exercises and tests sent to you so that FRIDAY or— or one of the others can see how well you fare.”
FRIDAY seemed to hesitate for only a second before saying,

It was pretty straightforward.

It was about Steve.
Helen looked to the side in remembrance, a rueful smile in her voice as she said, “I was only seventeen then. And

, to their advantage. And you told them to go fuck themselves. I saw you after Afghanistan, how you chose to destroy your father’s legacy because you didn’t want to be an instrument of war. And I saw,” her voice cracked and Toni heard the sound of breaking glass, “I saw you fly that nuke into outer space. I was fourteen and I cried until I was sick because I never got the chance to meet you and I wanted to show you all my inventions. And then you did come back and you continued to save people. Not just to complete a mission but
He felt Bucky’s wince more so than saw it and Steve quietly wished the floor would swallow him whole.
To anyone else it might have been similar to the motions of one holding a long-range gun - like an M1941 Johnson rifle. Like a
, of one woman alone.
After a moment, the AI spoke, her painfully warm, breathy voice weaving itself down into Toni’s soul, making her shudder with emotion.
He shifted his weight from one foot to the next and it was so minute that she barely caught it. But the gesture was so profoundly human that it hit her right in her core and all she could think of at that moment was how much she’d missed him.
“Natasha Romanov’s told me good things about you. Look forward to working with you in the future.”
“You’re here about the arm,” she said in a no-nonsense tone of voice.
. Her mother.
“What are you saying?” she asked, staring at all their faces; some looked grave, others resigned, some looked regretful while others remained stoic and cold.
During that time, Bucky became acquainted with a couple of the other robots -
“How would getting
Toni obviously hadn’t been able to articulate enough to them how there was
She’d been aware of it all along but coming from Cooper, it was a stark reminder that her time here, in this beautiful little world, was finite, that all good things had to come to an end. She’d known and yet it still felt like the ground had shifted beneath her feet, aligning itself on a different fault line completely, one that was unsteady and constantly shifting.
“I shall accompany you, Sergeant Barnes,” Vision said politely without missing a beat, and as he glided past Stark, he briefly placed a hand on her shoulder and murmured something that she didn’t respond to, but neither did she lean away from his touch. As he came up beside Bucky, Vision gestured towards the door with one red hand. “Shall we?”
The same passion, the same attentiveness to her work.
“Toni,
Steve frowned. “Not Toni?”
It was easier, she thought, to think of it in those terms. To focus on the practicality of her work and ignore the roiling mess of emotions in the endless cavern of her chest.

Toni didn’t miss a beat. “Somehow you don’t strike me as the superstitious type, sir. Too...logical.”
He had to.

Through the window of an old rustbucket behind her, she could see just one bag in the backseat.
Toni didn’t say anything. Couldn’t say anything. Because that was Helen’s trauma and her fear and Toni didn’t have any right to protest and say
Shuri leaned forward, her eyes sharpening, and Peter looked even more confused.
A flash hit the corner of her eye and she flinched instinctively. When she looked, Princess Shuri had just gestured at Vision with her fork, a look of intrigue on her pretty face as she inquired about his abilities.
Opening her eyes, she surveyed the suit before her with a heavy sigh, letting her fingers brush against the smooth, near impenetrable material. Hesitating for a bare second, she slipped her hand inside the mask and it came to life under recognition of her heat signature, the fabric stiffening and the visual mechanisms adjusting themselves.
Clint’s little outburst.
. This, she had to do because right now it was the most important thing in the world.
The truth was that she did too.
“The Ancient One didn’t say but...I suppose an army from space is bad enough,” Stephen was saying, and he sounded far away to her ears. “Question is, who assembled it.”
There was a subtle roaring on the other side, like the loud hum of a highway. He wondered where she was going. To town, maybe? Food shopping? Maybe to visit some friends or drop some of her harvest off at the farmer’s market.
Twirling the stylo between her fingers, she paused for a breath of a second before putting the tip to the screen. She wrote with bright red scribbles and splotches of crimson, large circles and violent underlining, until words and questions and
to accomplish, they weren’t a team yet. And Nat could only do what she had always done and she hoped that in that at least, Vision would respect her for it.

Toni had mentioned him before...before.
“How long have you been working on this?” he asked in a quiet voice reserved for sanctums and other holy places.
Just before they landed in the middle of a spot the police had cordoned off just for them, T’Challa grabbed her arm and surveyed her up and down with a proud smile. In the suit she was just as tall as him. Which meant she’d be just as tall as-
treat her differently. I can...I can see it. I can
And she’d seen first-hand how taking that stance would end.
The silence reigned heavy for a long moment, everybody processing T’Challa’s words.
“Not lie so much as omit the fact that we spoke. At least for now,” FRIDAY chirped innocently. “Of course I won’t stop you from waking her up right now and informing her that I’ve disobeyed a command but I believe it will be in both our interests to keep this private in the meantime.”
been Steve.
“Just Toni, Shuri.”
Maria sent her reports every three days, updating her on any new appointments and training exercises for her recruits. Toni admittedly only glanced through the sometimes pages-long emails but trusted Maria’s skills and her diligence enough to give her free reign.
“So,” she began, grinning down at the mask with misty eyes, “how long did it take Peter to break past the safety protocols?”
“All right then.”
He stared at her as if he couldn’t decide whether she was joking or not.
“He was retired,” Toni said with utmost honesty. “It didn’t seem right to call him into our mess.”
Sam shook his head. “When we first came here, when Barnes was first going under, we all had a small talk. Wanda knows something went down, something bad. Said she felt it from you when you saved us from the Raft. She thought maybe Stark had hurt you somehow-”
“You don’t need to be a genius to help people, Kama Llama,” she said after a few beats, turning to face her fully. “Did someone say someth-?”
“Surprisingly no,” Vision replied, placing a calming hand to her back and leading her to a fallen log so they both could sit. “He appears to be avoiding any talk of the incident at all, save for with his therapist. Both of them,” he added and Toni suppressed a guilty wince.
Doctor Cho smiled politely as the three of them entered and showed no indication that she was aware of the thick, murky tension that wafted around them like a dense fog.
He set his book down.
. Was that she knew that if she turned around she’d be lost. If she looked into those green eyes she thought she knew so well, she might has well sign herself away right this second. And she was not ready. She was
“Already there, Aragog.”
“Remove your hands from her,” he said, and Toomes let go, the police immediately grabbing his wrists and re-cuffing them behind his back.
She remembered Stephen’s gentle hand on her arm. Something - she couldn’t remember - softly spoken. The scent of tea leaves. The scratch of his goatee as he lightly kissed her cheek and then—
She didn’t have to hurt tonight.
When he jerkily turned to look at Stark, she was sat there glaring at the skeleton of his arm, breathing in and out of her nose, and Bucky could see the fingers of one hand digging into her thighs while the other tapped incessantly on the metal slat next to his unmoving fingers.
“Well,” she finally said, clapping her hands together, “you guys know where everything is. If you don’t I’m sure FRIDAY will be happy to help.”
Steve watched for a few moments longer until Toni, Spider-Man and the other kids were all hanging in mid-air, like a group of lazy trapeze artists on a break. He watched the way her nose wrinkled when she laughed, drank in the almost languid expression as she swung back and forth, the motions making her chin-length hair blow around her face.
Not close enough.
And when Toni would wake up at night with her hands clasped protectively over her arc reactor and a scream caught in her throat, Vision would bring up every single thing she was working on and resume where he’d left off before she’d fallen asleep.
“I believe,” he continued slowly, thoughtfully, “that I was hesitant to read anything that could be construed as happy.”

It was the tremor in her voice that broke Toni’s heart twice over and she reached out and took Kamala’s hand in hers, squeezing it gently.
Because it was just an arm. She could do that.
She was burning. And then she was freezing.
,” she said, with some disbelief.
They used to do those things together and he found himself yearning for the simplicity. The simplicity that he’d dropped everything for when Cap had called. Because he hadn’t really wanted to stop at all.
She reached across the table, hands open. “May I see?”
He’d been quiet even as she’d cried gross, ugly angry tears, had rubbed her back as she hyperventilated and coughed up last night’s dinner. And when she finished he had hugged her, a gesture instigated by no one else but
The camera switched to an overview of the entire auditorium, Toni a small speck in the middle.
A beat, and then, “It’s not your fault, Toni.”
Bucky stared at it long and hard then rotated it, flexing the fingers several times.
She eyed her for a moment longer than necessary before nodding and greeting Rhodey and Vision.
Nat stood to the side of them, a little away, her hands clasped behind her back. She was it, the clear delineation between the two groups. Toni with Peter behind her, Vision to her right, Rhodey standing with his body angled towards her, Stephen standing behind a chair with his arms crossed and Hope rigid, looking like she was physically trying to hold herself together.

“Ease up there, soldier boy,” she murmured as she settled on the wheelie stool, eyeing first his tightly clenched fist in his lap, then the chart that monitored his heart rate, indicating it was slightly elevated. “We don’t have a replacement right arm in case you decide to break that one too.”
Shuri, Vision and Natasha had been waiting outside with a biodbed when Maria’s black Land Rover screeched across the lawn, narrowly missing a water feature that Toni had been complaining to Natasha about getting rid of, before it came to a halt in front of them.
It sounded like sorrow and shattering glass.
“They know something happened but,” Sam shrugged, “they’re not gonna ask.”
She said something bashfully funny and people laughed. Her eyes widened at the laughter and for a fraction of a second Steve saw someone he knew intimately well, a woman who hadn’t intended to be funny but was pleasantly surprised by the outcome. He’d seen that expression before and oh god, it hurt.
. Because this...this she couldn’t fix. As much as she wanted to, as much as Laura deserved
than he could’ve ever hoped.
Toni was sure that wasn’t the case, but she supposed she could see it from Laura’s point of view; having her husband deck it to rejoin the Avengers when he’d only just given it up. But she also knew Clint not as a husband, but
Hope found her a few hours later in one of the training rooms, and didn’t bother to quieten her footsteps as she stepped over the tiered wooden seats and sat next to Toni.
The bands around his wrist powered to life and the flat disc hummed, drawing in the power generated like liquid through a straw.

“What?” she whispered.
The phone blurred before her eyes.

“And she
“I’m okay.” Nat fiddled with the strap of her bag before placing her tablet on the coffee table. Then before she could think twice, she forged ahead with her next statement. “He read it. They all did.”
Toni’s favorite moments, the ones KAREN let her linger on a little longer, were his quiet times alone as he swung between buildings and under bridges, or perched on the very top of buildings, watching the sunset melt into the molten metal skyline. Those were beautiful moments.
Hope gave one of her chuckles that always seemed to border on sardonic, but Toni had come to realize that it was just the way she sounded.

And there’s gotta be a lot more people like him who have abilities or powers that they can’t control and I’ll bet my money that more than half of them actually
“Covered. Wrapped.” Her words were jilted, almost choked, like it was a challenge to get out. “There was...damage.”
Ueno and Ackerman looked unruffled but some of the others, including the angry man from earlier, grumbled and shared concerned looks and mutterings between one another.

that he needed to confess what he had done, whether he’d had the autonomy or not.
,” he said again, blinking rapidly, “she- Stark’s the one who - does, does she know it’s for me? Did - did your brother-?”
The smile she received told her just how stupid her argument was because of course Laura would know about JARVIS and FRIDAY. They were famous. People even tried -
Toni backed down first, nodding in an approximation of understanding, the most that she could provide to him at this point.
Maybe she’d never be able to reconcile those parts of her. The dark places inside that hated James Barnes and hated Steve Rogers with the large, looming cavern, the shape of a cave in Afghanistan, that hated herself for what she’d done.
“She still working for Fury?” Steve spoke for the first time since they landed, his voice a low rumble.
Colonel Rhodes had a calm and competent air about him that Bucky appreciated. He was a military man through and through without any of the condescension or bravado. Bucky had dealt with men like him before; they were the ones who made battle plans and kept everyone together and
For a while only the sound of uprooted cabbages filed the air. Toni wondered whether they were having sauteed kale or a kale salad for dinner, or whether Laura was going to sell her harvest at the farmer’s market in town.
“Excellent work.”
And that was such a Kamala thing to ask, and it pressed into the tender peat of Toni’s soul, leaving an impression in the shape of Kamala’s own. Kamala was a soft one. All the kids were and tended to treat the bots like people but Kamala had a special kind of empathy that made Toni proud and terrified in equal measure because she
“The country I was born to permits it. Not many would. For that, I am grateful.”
“No, he didn’t. But when Rogers called...” With a sigh, she looked at the ground. “It was like he couldn’t get away from here fast enough.”
She did the next best thing and sat in the back with his head cradled in her lap all the way back to the Compound. Every so often T’Challa would glance into the rearview mirror and see her gazing down at Peter’s sleeping face, or gently wiping away the dried blood with a wet tissue.
Steve. I
So she wasn’t worried because she knew they had it handled.
He stared at her. “With you and Jim?”
Also, I'm my own beta and I do my best to proofread my own work but if there are mistakes, I am sorry and I humbly grovel for your forgiveness.
. “I didn’t at the time. I thought I could- I mean. I got big-headed and thought if I just proved myself to you that I was...that I could do this…” he trailed off sheepishly, feeling heat creep up the back of his neck and suddenly very grateful for the low lighting. “You were right to take away the suit back then. It didn’t even...I was kind of a jerk.” He shrugged, the motion causing his collarbone to twinge uncomfortably. “Plus I got my friend to bypass your safety protocols. Uh. Sorry about that.”
At some point during the first month of his stay, Steve had graduated from training with Shuri to letting - most of the time it didn't feel like he’d had much of a choice - the Dora Milaje train
Soft, worn hands touched her jaw and slid up to cup her face, coercing Toni to look at her. It was dark but Laura’s eyes glistened and Toni felt the absurd urge to follow suit and sniffed embarrassedly.
“They can’t,” she interrupted softly. “I mean they can but I’d still—” Unable to grasp the words, she switched tactics, gripping his hand and looking him in the eye. “Peter, I want you to know. They are

And apparently that was that. Within minutes they were outside in a large stone courtyard, the shadow of the cliffside their only protection against the midday sun. Steve had trained in all sorts of environments but he had to hand it to the Wakandans and to equatorial nations in general, because his lily-white ass was going to have a hard time in this stifling humidity.
There were multiple screens throw up around her, all of them videos of Spider-Man from different angles that she would alternate her attention to before working on a number of miniscule gadgets on the table.
Vision stopped, looking up, looking beyond Wanda’s reflection and out onto the frosty grounds below.

Toni shook her head. “It’s fine.” It wasn’t. But she knew Natasha didn’t mean it like that. Maybe. But she also knew what people said about her and Ross and okay, no,
He was silent for a while and Toni stewed in her own misery, thinking about how a year could change so much. How before, Toni wouldn’t have dreamt of planning her course every time she stepped out of the safety of her lab or Vision’s bedroom - though even
“How’ve you been?” she asked, and she found herself truly curious about the answer. They hadn’t parted on the best of terms, through no fault of his at all. It had been all her.

But Peter seemed both surprised and intrigued.
She wanted to weep.
In spite of it all, Bucky couldn’t help but notice that Stark was as thorough as Doctor Cho was in her explanation of the arm and how she intended to install it. She expanded on terms like nerve electrodes and neural interface, broke them down to concepts all of them could grasp and went into the finer details of care and maintenance.
“Huh,” Toni managed as she brought down another one of Spider-Man’s human packages. “Took them longer than I imagined to get to that stage. Thanks, Vision. How about you give me a

“I saw you and mom talking about the Sokovia Accords. They were the reason you guys all fought, right?”
He didn’t glance at the time, he didn’t need to, but Toni could feel the silent judgment anyway, and rolled her eyes as she pulled him to his feet.

Shuri swallowed thickly, staring down at the thing as if it was the source of all her pain. “It was found ten years ago at the height of Obadiah Stane’s weapon smuggling. One of our War Dogs had been present for the arms deal and notified my father. He sent a group of Dora to take care of it and bring the weapons back to Wakanda.

Steve worked his jaw for a moment, his eyes still burning with a fight before he sighed and his shoulders sagged.

The surgery was slow-going, with every care taken to removing the implant and ensuring that the process of it didn’t traumatize Barnes’ nerves, muscles and bones more than they were already. The first time Toni had glanced at the clock, it had taken her a moment to process that four hours had passed since they’d started. The second time she checked, another two and a half hours had passed.

There was indeed someone standing by the ledge - a

“It’s HYDRA, all right,” Natasha grunted to the sound of someone getting knocked out in the background. “And they’ve got a lot of weapons I’ve never seen before.”
Something cold trickled down the back of her spine. It was there for a bare fraction of a second before vanishing.
Steve saw the screen flicker, then Shuri’s easy grin appeared, the familiar white walls and blue screens of her lab behind her.
“Is she gonna be okay?”
He ran out into the living room where they were all gathered around the TV in various states of undress and sleep-wear. Natasha was indeed on the screen, her hands clasped professionally in front of her. Next to her was Colonel Rhodes - Steve heard Sam exhale a shuddering breath - and next to him was Vision - Wanda was practically pressed up against the screen, drinking him in even as she clutched her shawl tight around herself.
Stephen’s look of resigned suffering crossed her mind and she bit back a chuckle. “That we do. Though, he prefers to refer to himself as the
“Yeah,” he breathed, after a time. “Me too.”
It was strange. It was the one question he hadn’t wanted answered, and yet he knew, he
“You should be ashamed of yourself.”
“You’re angry at them.”
She and Rhodey had eaten dinner in Vision’s room, an enlarged projection of the Accords floating in front of them.
Toni blinked quickly, momentarily distracted from imagining Everett Ross being dropped from a great height by Iron Man. “But Shuri and Harley
Bucky seemed to study his expression before dipping his head once. “Yeah. I did.”
it was
And Toni had to try really hard to suppress her inner squeal of utmost adoration because
Laura’s smile softened as she settled into the opposite chair, and she reached across the countertop to squeeze Toni’s hand.
Toni sneaked a look at Harley, who was sitting on the kitchen counter, a bottle of ginger beer held loosely between his thumb and forefinger. She sidled over and hopped up on the counter next to him, nudging him with her elbow.
Wanda looked down at the ground, her hands shaking. She opened her mouth to say something, but all that left her throat was a quiet sob.
He thought of Toni, a million miles away. Her hair would be an unbrushed, fluffy mess, there would be bandaids on her hands and around her fingers. Maybe a smudge of grease on her forehead. Her tank top would be damp with sweat and blackened where she’d wiped her hands. Her feet would be bare even though she was insecure about her toes and always curled them when people were around so no one would see.
“Night, Nat. Sweet dreams.”
She blinked at her. “What?”
“We’ll fix that right up soon enough. Say, can you get legal-”
Clint clutched the phone to his chest and
listened to you, Ms. Stark.” Councilwoman Ackerman clasped her hands together, resting them on the table, coincidentally right into the path of a sunbeam.
“Not yet. Soon, though.”
“That sure is something,” he murmured finally, some unnamed emotion in his voice and she felt his hand shake for a moment before he let go.
“Catch,” she breathed.
For a moment she could almost imagine that Jarvis was behind her on a cool April night, showing her worlds beyond her most fantastical dreams.
T’Challa smiled and gripped Clint’s shoulder. “It wasn’t my idea. But I hope it brings you some comfort. You will not always be away from them. This, all of this, will change. It is already starting to.” He nodded, then walked down the stone steps to where Shuri was laying into Steve, who seemed to have finally gotten into the whole gig and was shouting out praise and giving pointers.
Kamala hummed, appeased, and continued to watch, asking questions every now and again that Toni was happy to answer. It kept her mind off of her meeting with Ellis and the rest of her problems that sat on the horizon, an impending shadow that grew in size with every passing day. Sometimes she didn’t even know how she’d gotten this far. But if it was one thing Toni had grown to be, it was resilient, even if it felt like a little bit of her was chipped away with every catastrophe, every struggle.
“That is not my intent at all,” he interrupted smoothly, then added in a softer, gentler tone, “But after everything that she has already done, does she not deserve to be?”
And then the shouting had started because Clint had been so angry-
It wasn’t something he thought he could ever do and yet here he was, a million miles away in the blink of an eye. He’d left Toni alone in a goddamn HYDRA bunker in Siberia with a suit as broken as the trust between them. He’d thrown the shield Howard had made, the shield her

than what happened between you and her and Barnes...
“Anytime. You keep an eye on that. Let me know if anything goes janky or whatever.”
The fight drained out of her and she sighed again, unhappy and anxious and miserable and
Hope had looked at her and done that thing with her mouth that Toni strongly suspected was her trying to hide a smile.
The woman had the patience and the poker face of a Virgin Mary statue and answered everything with enviable ease, never slipping and always with a calm smile on her lips. Toni marveled at it, wondering whether the Phil Coulson-level of indecipherability was a byproduct of parenthood or marriage.
“A conference in Tokyo,” Toni told her dutifully. “I asked Rumiko to introduce us after listening to your talk on catalyzing specific genetic mutations to cure disease.”
Bucky couldn’t help it but something warm stiltedly stirred somewhere inside, even if her very well-concealed amusement was at his expense.
“C’mon, let’s get her inside. FRIDAY, get Vision to Lab B now!”
At that Shuri looked simultaneously offended and intrigued, but the expression was quickly replaced by realization as she caught onto Toni’s thread of thought.
“I will. And I’ll drop Helen and Shuri an email to let them know I got their gift.”
flinch as she threw her tiny soldering iron to the ground, grabbed something that looked like a knife with a laser and dug it into his arm, flicking the still-smoking panel up with ease, then flinging it violently to the side, narrowly missing one of the many other machines in her workshop.
“Zemo played us. The other winter soldiers were already dead when we got there. He showed…” His voice had broken partway through the sentence, like rocks chipping as they tumbled down a cliff. “He showed us a recording. It was meant for Toni.”
“I...yeah,” she croaked, squinting around their hotel room that she barely remembered stepping into last night. “Best sleep I’ve had in a while.”
Sam didn’t answer for a long moment and Steve almost wanted to wave it off, take the question back so he wouldn’t have to hear-
Grimacing at the hardy leaves, she hoped it would be the last one.
“Okay,” she said to herself, pacing around the workspace and rotating her wrists. “Okay. C’mon Stark. Increments...increments by quarters instead of halves. It’s simple. Common sense,” she muttered, nodding to herself and behind her Bucky saw Vision lift the lid of the smoking can and fish out the charred device.
consisted of a dentist’s seat, which Toni had promptly scrapped and replaced with a more comfortable lazy boy chair because she doubted Barnes would appreciate the HYDRA parallels, however unintended; a bunch of screens would help her monitor and record Barnes’ vitals and brain patterns, and rather than a pair of glasses, she and Vision were creating a streamline dome that hovered over the circular space surrounding Barnes’ chair, which would both tap into Barnes’ memories and project them around him so he could literally immerse himself in it.
Toni was elbow-deep in kale when Laura spoke up for the first time that afternoon. There had been a nervous tension surrounding her all morning, and Toni, who was still on unsteady ground with the other woman, had opted to wait for her to make the first move.
“Yeah,” Steve said meaninglessly, sounding lost and unsure but
The sound of breaking glass.
She was saying something to the newcomer but all Steve could hear was, “-
“We’ll keep that in mind for the next upgrade,” Toni said with a smirk. “Visuals okay on your end?”
“Peachy,” she said with a tight smile. “Just...peachy.”
“You are,” Laura said thickly from behind her curtain of hair. When she turned and looked at Toni, her eyes were damp with tears. “We’re gonna have to fix that one of these days.”
He stilled at the mention of Stark, his mouth suddenly dry.
“—toes,” she finished. Her lips were pursed together but there was something that almost resembled faint amusement in her eyes as she took in the pained grimace he was trying and failing to suppress. Then she leaned in to Dummy, who was throwing what sounded like an electric tantrum, and whispered something that Bucky suspected was, “good boy,” before kissing one of the prongs of the claw and sending him on his way.
Toni clearly thought it was, for she was already turning around in a clear dismissal.
“How far did you go, Steve? You and Barnes? How far did you go in Siberia?”
Even the bots had come to watch, their whirring both curious and intrigued by this young hero.
There were several empty glasses with dried smears of whatever concoction they’d previously contained clinging to the edges and settling at the base. Some of them had lipstick marks on the rim. There was a small couch with a duvet hanging off of it and slipping onto the floor.
With a sharp hiss that was more devastation than disgust, she tore her hand back and hastily stood, sending her stool rolling away, where it crashed into a machine, making them both flinch.
She swallowed then straightened. “Doctor Cho, the stasis rings, if you wouldn’t mind? After that, everybody take fifteen. Bathroom break, lunch, hydrate, whatever. Just be back and ready in fifteen on the dot. It’s the homestretch, guys. We got this.”
, perhaps, and she might have thrown her mug at him in rage and snarled,
“Hey, c’mon, Rhodey, man, ease up—”

If Ackerman could smile, this was as closed to one as Toni suspected she would ever see. It was difficult to decipher something that was decidedly
“That is
“C’mon. You don’t sleep anyway.”
She was the reason he was even here to learn and experience the world in a way he’d never quite been able to comprehend when he was JARVIS.
. And she couldn’t afford that. No matter what the voice in her head whispered.
She’d worked it out, though, at least a small piece of it; Rhodey didn’t know what happened in Siberia. Vision did.
Once again, Nat tried to direct the conversation back to the point at hand.
“What makes you think I hate him?”
Laura hummed and knelt by her, watching her work. Her sleeves were rolled up to her elbows and she smelled of sweet tea and cake. The scent filled her with comfort and made her eyelids heavy.
And he’d laughed and kissed her on the forehead - her heart might have fluttered - and told her that it was a well-deserved gift for being able to synthesize Vibranium in her lab while half-dead. The gift of actual, real - holy shit it glowed the same color as her arc reactor - Vibranium felt sorely disproportionate to her achievements. She might have gone all misty-eyed but T’Challa was too much of a gentleman to mention it.
has been thrown around. Kamala’s the good one, though. Polite and shy. I think even Agent Hill has a soft spot for her.” Agent Fern hesitated once more looking at him sidelong. “If...you don’t mind me saying, sir. Just a word of advice. I’m looking at this as an objective outsider but they’re great kids. And they’re...protective over Ms. Stark and she of them. I mean just last week Mr. Keener nearly broke his arm when he slipped while one of ours was trying to demonstrate a shoulder lock on him. Ms. Stark laid into that recruit so bad we all thought he was gonna piss himself. She apologized later, but still. It was quite the show.”
didn’t like it - Natasha was and had always been someone she needed on her side.
She smiled and it wasn’t pretty.
And T’Challa; for someone whose composure was to be envied, looked stricken but unsurprised.
Toni hit the ground before she had time to process the punch and Vision was already kneeling beside her and examining the side of her face which was turning a glorious shade of purple. Nat hissed, taking a meaningful step towards Van Dyne, whose face was twisted into a sneer of anger, satisfaction, and above all, pain. And it was
“Vis—”
Ah. There it was.
Finally, she pushed herself up from the stool, yanked off the magnifying visor and tossed that to the side as well. He watched, mildly intrigued, as once more, Vision caught it with one hand while never taking his eyes off of the 3D rendering of the internal going-ons of his arm.
“Hello, Toni.”
“I’m coming back, Toni,” Natasha told her quietly. “I’ll go, say my piece and a couple more and I’ll be back. And when I do you can tell me everything that happened with Ellis. And after that it’ll be time for Phase Two.”
wasn’t entirely sure what he had against it in the first place.
“Very well.”
“Hey,” Nat began, twisting her ring around her finger in what Toni had come to discover was as close to a nervous tic as Nat could get. “Good luck with Ellis. Just like we practiced. It’s gonna be fine. He has a soft spot for you and Rhodey. Use it.”
Dutiful, firm,
“It’s gonna take a while, Toni.” Then she added, so sincere and so familiar in its affection, “But he’s worth it.”
Her voice faltered for less than a second, the irony of her own words trickling down the back of her throat like her own blood. But she swallowed down her own fear and forged ahead. Just like she’d always done.
One of the newer bots, a little zooming cleaning bot named Rosie, was particularly enamored with Peter and chirped excitedly until Toni had picked her off the floor and set her on the table for a closer look.
Squeezing her eyes shut, she rubbed the center of her forehead and repeated, her voice sounding distant to her own ears,
Back home.

Once was devastating but twice might be too much to bear. You are afraid that the people you knew, the people who trusted you, no longer will. That they have changed beyond recognition. You are afraid that the chasm between you is irreparable.”
Toni’s jaw worked for a moment but it was Vision who spoke.
“Sergeant Barnes,” she greeted mildly, then her gaze flickered to Steve, something passing over her expression before disappearing entirely. “Captain Rogers, Natasha. Please. Take a seat and we can get started.”
Because Barnes was on this side of the glass.
“Sergeant Barnes, if you are so inclined,” the android,
“Thank you all for your time.”
“Well,” Harley said smoothly, brown eyes glinting excitedly, “we were hoping
Not all this time.
“Eh, I deserved that. Cassie Lang. Let’s get her a phone to her dad.”
Shit is starting to go down. I hope Toni's brief foray into madness wasn't confusing for you? It worked in my head but, well.
Bucky’s eyes met his through the glass and Steve smiled and nodded, but the stretch of his mouth felt tight.
“Russian literature mostly.”
She knew that smile well and imagined that it only served to further irritate his victims as it once did her.
So it was funny how all it took to make him freeze was a word from Antonia Stark’s mouth.
“Only if that’s okay with you,” she said, a little unsure.
The group gathered in the room had started arguing amongst one another.
When T’Challa raised his head from the dense paperwork in front of him his eyes were suspiciously shiny, and Toni felt her ears burn self-consciously.
Clint tried to be discreet as he rolled his eyes but he mustn’t have been cautious enough if Ayo’s unimpressed glower was anything to go by.
“We were

Nat offered a small smile and rested her elbows on her knees, her hands clasped in the space between.

And Steve believed in the very core of him that whatever simmering rages they harbored towards him, towards Toni and towards one another, they were all good enough, respectful enough,
“When exactly are they making a formal announcement,” Rhodey asked, a conflicted expression on his face and his eyes darting between Toni and T’Challa.
Peter somersaulted mid-air over a five-foot foam cube; Cooper’s eyes were first wide with amazement, then narrowed with determination as he pointed at Peter and demanded he teach him how to do that.

“You received the package, then.” After a brief pause she prompted, “Did she

Toni looked at her for a long time then slowly tilted her head to the side.
About an hour later the boys finally burst out of the control room, smelling of electric burns and manic laughter, carrying what Toni assumed was
Toni dropped her gaze to her clasped hands on the table in front of her.
“No second thoughts.”
“I was only eight when you first came out as Iron Man and I can’t remember it much but I remember seeing Iron Man flying around sometimes and I thought it was so cool.” She grinned and it lit up the entire room. “I think a lot of people never thought they’d see a superhero in real life. Like they were only in books and comics and movies and stuff. And then you came and you were a

A gaping maw of darkness.
“She knows my name,” Scott said in surprise. “I thought she-”
“No. Just facts.”
She had her back to them and was leaning forward, both hands braced on the edge of the kitchen counter, and Steve saw it in the stiffening of her spine and the way she abruptly cut off her words when she realized they had company.
Clint swallowed thickly and squeezed his eyes shut, nodding even though he knew she couldn’t see.
Rather than her best friend in the entire world, Toni had revealed that one vital piece of information to her most sophisticated creation.
“Captain Rogers?”
She came forward, taking something small out of her pocket and as if their minds were linked for a second time, Toni knew what it was before Shuri dropped that cold, dead weight into Toni’s hesitant, outstretched palm.
She made a beeline for the kettle while Toni gingerly hoisted herself back onto the stool.

But there was no dream. Helen had said-
“FRIDAY, what time is it in Seoul?”
“From my limited scans of heart-rate and breathing patterns I’d say it’s a negative on the heart attack front, Boss, and probably some form of an anxiety attack instead.” She sounded distressed herself and Toni could imagine a frazzled Ana Jarvis with her wild red hair as she fretted over her.
Vision looked down at her and again, she felt something. Something…
A muscle clenched in Bucky’s jaw and Steve saw him wipe the palm of his hand on his sweatpants before pushing to his feet.
But hurting Toni the way he had. The rage-fuelled violence. The

When Laura came home, all four of them were in the lounge watching a David Attenborough documentary. Cooper was on the floor leaning back against her legs, Lila was curled up next to her and Nathaniel was on her lap, a teething ring in his mouth.
“Stark,” he said in a raspy voice that sounded like gravel and smoke. Like hardened boots crunching over gritty shards of ice and glass.
“Council members,” he began, and Toni felt the hairs on her arms stand on end. “My fellow representatives.” She turned her hand palm up and laced her fingers with Vision’s, acutely aware that he was still shooting her worried looks. “And my most esteemed guests. Thank you for coming here today.”
His stomach dropped at the sound of his name coming from Bucky’s lips because he

,” Shuri declared, grinning at the images projected from her bracelet.
“Machines don’t have that kind of thought process.”
Nat’s world suddenly felt blank, like all color and sound had been sucked from her surroundings. White noise muffled in her ears and her hand moved on its own, her fingers subconsciously reaching for the gun in her jacket in response to a threat that she couldn’t understand, couldn’t even

that I would never—”
She whirled around so fast a sharp pain shot up her neck. Ahead of her was just an empty corridor all the way to the end, where it curved around the rest of the building.
When she looked at Vision, she found a gentleness to his eyes, something soft and fond. “She will never admit to it.” The softness gave way to what she could only describe as concern a moment later, his jaw ticking in a way that Nat was almost entirely certain it was not meant to.
“Fuck,” Hope cursed, stumbling over a few wires to one of the metal trolleys and filling a needle full of god knows what.
Maria Hill walked in to the communal kitchen one morning during breakfast with several busloads of recruits, both new and old, waiting outside.
his own voice kept whispering in his ear.
Rather than dampen her mood, the familiarity of it filled her with a nostalgic kind of fondness as she recalled many a family or school photo where she’d adopted a similar stance. Shuri’s eyes were softer, though, and sweeter. At least to Toni.
“Vision, start up the-”
“Hey,” she said quietly once the kids had offered their greetings and turned back to their show. She casually took a seat next to Toni, who made space for her on the couch. Behind them Vision was making tea.
“Sure thing,” she said with a forced smile that she knew he saw right through.
But there was no use thinking about such things.

that voice. And it sounded sad. It made him feel sad too.
Speaking the words that had been on her tongue was going to reveal a lot more about her to this stranger - because he was a stranger - than she was ready to reveal. But maybe that was the perfect reason for her to do so. Maybe.
“I don’t know how I feel about it.”
Straightening her sleeves, she glared and made to move past him. “I need to get ready for my speech. So if you’ll excuse me.”
Inhaling deeply, she clasped her hands in front of her body and raised her chin. This was it.
She stood abruptly. “What?” she demanded, and FRIDAY automatically pulled up the news of a large fire on Coney Island and the DODC plane in ruins in the sand. T’Challa and Shuri stood as well, looking between her and the live feed. “What ha-”

Steve inhaled, then let it all out slowly, but it did nothing to release the tension held within his body.

According to Laura it was the only time the kids actually deliberately stayed behind to help clean up and Toni was touched, even if it only made it harder to say goodnight to them later. Afterwards, they’d gone into their respective bedrooms, all save for Toni, who lingered downstairs, letting her eyes rove over each room, trying to memorize as much as she could. Upstairs, she had pressed her hand against the kids’ doors, then Laura’s, then padded downstairs and walked outside barefoot into the breezy summer night air.
T’Challa blew out a puff of air, then sat in the empty seat beside Toni. “I’ll answer as much as I’m able to at this time. I’ve requested to sit on the Accords subcommittee. There will be seven others appointed by the Council, whom I’ve been told will all be neutral and objective members of the international public. That means we have three extra spaces which will be filled by Avengers. This will hopefully provide a more grounding link between us and the Panel and the Council and help us police one another more effectively. The Council has...made several remarks in passing that it might be prudent, at least for image’s sake, that Captain Rogers be on the subcommittee.” When he said this he looked at Toni, who stared back, so many things,

Toni demanded, already striding towards the door.
“Just as we predicted. The implant is going to be a perfect fit,” Shuri said above them, projecting her own joy as warm as the sun until Toni could feel her fingers again.
Laura knew nightmares and she knew loss and fear and grief when she saw it.

Like the curtains being drawn prematurely, the fight left them both at the same time. Steve slumped onto the ground, his legs resting on the lower stone steps and Natasha took a seat a foot away. One time she might have pressed up against him in shared camaraderie, but now, maybe the effort was too much or too many things between them.
Warm, cautious fingers slipped down the side of her wrist before sliding between her fingers. As if he had given her the all clear, as if he’d broken whatever spell the cold had cast on her, her lungs resumed their work and she released a slow, steadying breath.
She sighed and looked at Hope, feeling heavy and tired and
“Is there...any chance that Clint will be coming home?”
And she all of that and more in Toni.
