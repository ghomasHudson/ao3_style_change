"We have to stop," Tony tried to catch his breath between kisses. "Believe me. I don't want to, but Peter's in the next room."
"It's Papa," Peter hurried to unlock the door, flinging himself into Steve's arms.
"Right," Steve let out a huff of air. "I'm sorry I got carried away. But I've been wanting to do that for a long time now."
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony looked up from his new smartphone that Steve had given to him three weeks ago. He had to admit, Peter was enjoying his nightly video calls with Steve and the internet access he now had on his phone allowed him to get homework done while he was on break or lunch when he was at work, giving him extra time with Peter and Steve on the weekends.
He sat in the chair, allowing this robe to fall open, "Be patient with me. I may look like your daddy, but this is all new to me."
“Are you alright?” Steve rolled to his side and put his hand on Tony’s. “Your smell is a little off.”
"Well, that wasn’t so bad - ouch! A little gentler with those teeth," Tony cooed at Peter.
The photographs that peppered the room gave tribute to a happy and loving relationship not only between Tony and Steve, but with the entire team. And when Tony came across their wedding photo, he noticed for the first time the simple gold band that adorned his left hand and his heart began to flutter. And when he moves to the next photo of Steve leaning over him while Tony is in a hospital bed holding their newborn son, his heart clenches. He has a son.
"The woman was actually Loki. He was standing over us when I regained consciousness."
Steve stood back as well and slowly exhaled and gave a weak smile, "Yeah, I better get in there before he finds someone else to call, like in Japan."
Steve was dumbfounded, "What?"
“Are you nervous?” Steve asked.
"You know we're not doing that anymore," Rhodey said, and the irritation was clear this time. "We were barely doing that in the first place; the trainees were only to be sent into action as a last resort." He frowned, and paused for a moment, adding, "I'm pretty sure Baron von Blitzschlag was trying to set up some kind of under the table black ops program with some of the recruits, but he's gone now, and I can personally assure you that none of those kids are going to do anything more dangerous than put out forest fires in Colorado until they're eighteen. Trust me," he looked up at Steve, meeting his eyes directly, "there's already been one lawsuit, and we don't want to give any more parents a reason to sue us."
"Tony," Steve said slowly, the worry that had been filling him joined by a sudden urge to grind his teeth, "are you actually suggesting that I should reconsider our relationship because someday you might end up being mind-controlled?" If he let that possibility keep him from getting close to people, he wouldn't have any friends left. If he'd been able to forgive Sharon for shooting him, forgive Bucky for trying to assassinate him as the Winter Soldier, what made Tony think Steve would be willing to give him up over something that hadn't even happened. "Should I get rid of Sharon and Bucky, too? And Sam, just to be safe?"
"I knew better," Jan said, tucking her stinging hands against her sides.  "Are you okay?"
"Right there. If you unhook that part, I can get the rest just fine." His arm didn't want to bend at that kind of an angle without sharp protests. "We were on a team together for a long time," Steve added, as Sam undid the tiny hook and eye fastening and then, without ceremony, nudged his arms upward and yanked the entire top of his costume off. "Before he..."
Sin was working with Doom.
Tony's smirk faltered, and then he was wearing the slick, polished smile he reserved exclusively for reporters. Jan fluffed her hair with one hand, and put on a smile of her own, one hopefully less superficial-looking than Tony's.
"By the time I found out, the whole thing was over," Clint said, feeling thoroughly on the defensive now. "That's why I was mad, because Wanda didn't tell me about it until it was too late to do anything."
"They didn't make out because of Loki. They made out because they're both idiots."
Hank looked less than convinced, but he nodded, pulling his arm free of Tony's grasp, and started moving.
So much for being or even limited usefulness.
"If you don't get some sleep, I'm going to get Jan to take you off active duty until-" Tony had his eyes closed, Steve realized, and was frowning thoughtfully, fingers still pressed against the side of his face as if to hold his skull together. Steve stopped pacing abruptly. "Are you using the Extremis?"
"Am I supposed to be intimidated?"  His mask was just as expressionless as Tony's faceplate, but it seemed even less human, despite the open mouth slit and the glimmer of his eyes visible through the eye holes.  "I grow tired of you."
he thought, and in a vivid flash of sense-memory, could smell the drowned remnants of smoke and ash and feel Steve's hands holding him down, violent and angry and so painfully far from what he'd wanted. It had been strangely appropriate, in a warped way – the two of them fighting in the ruins of what had once been their home, now as shattered and broken as the Avengers had been. As their friendship had been. "Chthon did. And I helped, to be honest. I turned us into a giant target, getting involved in politics the way I did. And there should have been better guards in place against Jack of Heart's power, and against Ultron."
The quinjet arrived at ten in the morning, which mean that it had to have left LA at five a.m. Which meant that Tony and Wanda had probably gotten up at four.
"Yes," he said, before he could lose his nerve. "Yes, I'll marry you."
Tony grinned even wider, and let Steve drag him down the hallway to their bedroom; he did, in fact, have a reputation to maintain.
Well, that hadn't been unpleasant for him. He could only hope it hadn't been unpleasant for her. Did it make it better that she apparently couldn't remember it clearly, or worse? Worse, probably – God, he might as well have been sleeping with a puppet, for all the input she'd had.
Sleeping in this hollow shell of a dwelling place out of pride was as foolish as refusing to speak to Tony or Hank had been, and served as little purpose.
Carol shrugged. "Oh, he doesn't die. He just loses both legs in an unfortunate teleporter accident."
He was a fraction of a second away from contact when a bright flare of light whited out his vision; it snapped through his body like an electric shock, the hair on his arms standing on end, and then he slammed hard into a female body too tall and solid to be Sin's.
Hank tensed, clearly readying himself to shrink just enough to get out of his restraints and throw himself at Doom.  Jan shook her head, and watched with relief as he visibly forced himself to relax again.  Hank wasn't always good at subtle signals, and didn't always listen even when he was aware of them.
Steve gently disentangled himself from Tony’s arms, trying his best not to pull on any of the tubes and wires attached to him, and carefully lowered his right arm back to the bed.  They had put the IV line in Tony’s left arm – they always did, unless Tony was awake at the time to insist they use his right.  “I love you, too,” he said.
Everything he thought or felt about Steve was so convoluted. He was still so angry at the man, but how much did that matter to him?

trusted you. I want to tell you all the mistakes I know I made during that time. And I want to give you my reasons and I want to explain the things I still wouldn’t change, even if I had the opportunity to.
He caught his breath, not caring he was currently being propped up by 200 pounds of super soldier beefcake.
He finally relented, allowing his whole body to relax under Steve’s embrace. His head was tucked neatly under Steve’s chin with his face buried where neck met shoulder. Their bodies were flush against each other and exchanged nothing but warmth.
“Tony!” The shout was louder this time, and Tony assumed Steve was running.
“I’m going to head to sleep. Just… just think about what I said.” Tony’s voice sounded deflated, as if all the air rushed out of him as soon as the words did.
“Yeah, exactly. What do you think that means?”
He originally planned to lecture Tony on the importance of staying together. What he wanted to do was yell at the man for scaring him so badly. He wanted to tell him that he ran around screaming his name, terrified something happened or that Tony left him behind. Steve wanted to remind him they had no idea where they were or what else was here.
Steve did his best to remove the image of Tony under the waterfall out of his mind.
He shouted. He was
he says” Tony mimicked, but it was without heat and with a bit of a smile. He clapped his hands together, “alright, I’m assuming that’s dinner? I prefer pan seared salmon but I guess I can make an exception.”
“Tony, what are you talking about?”
The hike was hell.
“Yeah, of course I did.”
to save millions.
Tony’s eyes were soft as they trailed from Steve’s face to the fire and finally to the ground.
Normally Tony would’ve refused to drink random river water in fear of flesh eating parasites, but the aching burn that lined his throat had him instantly cupping and slurping up the water from the river, ignoring Steve’s half hearted protests.
Tony held himself back from a snarky comment, “right here Cap.”
Witchypoo was sending copies of herself all around to attack each of the Avengers individually all while spouting some nonsense about dimension shifting & how this was her life calling.
His longest & essentially only relationship was over. His best friend was paralyzed from the waist down. His so-called family hated his guts. The world looked to him for answers he didn’t have. And Steve.
No matter if he was supposed to keep a watch over the now not-so-former former Avengers, Tony stayed as far away from them as legally permitted. He’d said a combined total of 7 words to Steve since they’d returned and Tony was hoping to keep it that way. The one & only time they’d all been in the same room together he’d gotten glares from Clint & Wanda, an unimpressed glance from Sam, an ever-unreadable blink from Natasha, and a painfully miserable look from the Good Captain. Tony swallowed down the bile that threatened at the back of his throat.
Steve stood their stupidly, mouth slightly agape. He didn’t know how to help. Watching Tony have what, a panic attack? when Steve simply
As soon as he got to the place they’d decided on for a temporary camp, he got to work.
him felt like a stab in the chest. He watch the brunet on the ground as he attempted to calm himself down. After a minute or too, Tony looked back up at Steve.
“You can’t…” he gestured wildly as he spoke,

Steve hummed a noncommittal noise.
was complete before nightfall, giving them each an opportunity to rinse themselves off in the waterfall before starting the fire up again.
Because the whole thing was selfish and stupid. And Tony hated him right now & probably always would. And Steve was still not happy with Tony and some of the choices he made. Even if Tony thought they were right at the time.
Instead, he was honest.
“You’d rather starve to death?”
Because Tony’s a shit he kept going only to have all the air knocked out of his lungs as the suit abruptly stopped 20 feet away from the floating witch. She smirked sinisterly at him as she twisted her wrist in a rapid motion and Tony felt the comforting metal rip off his body. He was still in air, floating only in his undersuit & jeans as he stared at the witch before him, wide eyed.
They walked for probably two hours, venturing away from the river every 10 minutes or so to check for any sign of animals or food. Walking next to the river was easier as the shoreline a mix of mostly flat sand & mud. Tony was never one for hiking before, but if they managed to get out of here alive he’d be content to never step foot in another forest again.
Tony’s body was tense as he started to walk away from Steve on trembling legs, he was breathing forcibly even and loud.
The gash wasn’t actually that deep once he cleared away most of the dried blood. It was about 1 1/2 inches long & 1/4 of an inch across. Tony scooped and poured the water over his ankle until the water ran clear.
he internally scolded himself as he turned to make his way back to camp.
Steve half carried half walked with him back to their camp, looking for freaked each time Tony glanced behind their backs.
of Howard Stark.
He didn’t really feel like that was appropriate anymore.
Tony smiled, “But instead I get what I’ve always had & always deserved: isolation.”
I might have had a few people in my life that had stuck around long enough to actually care, at least a little bit.”
Steve let out another sigh and rolled his hips until he was back on his back. Tony’s breath caught up with him. His shoulders dropped and his dick throbbed at the lack of attention.
he was taking this in stride. Mr Man With A Plan would never let any actual emotion through. He was better than the lesser folks. He didn’t have to think twice about what he did because he
Steve meant to ask ‘what’ but no sound came out when he tried.
But maybe it was weaker to hide behind the distractions.

Her smirk transformed into a somehow more sinister grin, “not so powerful with that suit, are you? It’ll be so much easier when you’re out of the way,
It was vulnerable.
“Steve” he whispered.
Either way, hearing Steve’s explanation-not-explanation two nights ago made Tony come to the heartbreaking realization: Steve
They were under the house arrest & supervision of the former funder of the Avengers: Anthony Edward Stark.
Steve swallowed and nodded. He had a million things to say already and chewed on the inside of his cheek to keep from blurting out.
Steve knew it didn’t mean much, it was only a little tiff and Tony wasn’t talking about anything else but this morning, but his mouth tugged up at the phrasing. He nodded, “yeah Tony, let’s start over.”
Tony actually smiled at that and pointed at him “Ah! Got you, that’s a twofer.”
“Not like I was going that far, O Captain my Captain,”
He shouted, “I don’t want to see you, I don’t want to speak to you. I would be so much fucking happier if you were out of my life! I’d rather be back in that goddamn cave in Afghanistan than stuck here with

Steve looked… worried.
The sound of a soft splashing interrupted his thoughts. He moved forward quickly and his eyes widened at the sight of a small, clear pond with a… fish?
He began sprinting back in the rough direction he came, using the beaten down brush as a guide.
As Tony pushed through the trees he froze when he caught movement ahead. He moved behind a tree, ducking his head around just slightly to stare ahead.
The left side of Tony’s face was pressed into the soft earth and when he raised his head he was hit with a wave of motion sickness. He managed to open his eyes, blinking as he adjusted to the darkness.
Steve nodded.
, “Nor do I of course,” Tony quickly (and poorly) played it off.
He ran for only another 50 feet before he felt himself crashing into something hard & warm.
Their

Tony couldn’t even find any comfort in his nearest and dearest science bro considering the fact he was still MIA along with Thor.
Steve’s heart tightened, but he nodded softly. “Do you want to go to bed?”
"And had I been a mortal mage, or some pathetic human scientist, I'm sure they would have worked." She gestured airily at the laser pistol still trained right between her breasts. "Why don't you put that away, Victor von Doom? I'm here to help you. My enemies have something you need, and you can give me access to something I greatly desire."
Tony blinked. "Actually, no. Come on, if I were flirting with you it would be intentional and a lot less subtle."
A low, creaky purr started up behind him, and the cat's needle-sharp little claws dug into the back of his neck, then let go, then dug in again.
"That's not real art. Not unless they made the doll themselves or painted something on the trashcan. Art should create something." It was old fashioned, Steve knew, but art should be about more than just shock value or being confusing for the sake of being confusing. It was supposed to communicate something to people, or, failing that, be aesthetically pleasing.
"Sorry," Steve said, after several deep breaths to make sure his voice wouldn't come out in a shaky gasp.  "I didn't mean to wake you up."
Clint stared at her, not believing his ears for a moment. Maybe he did need to have Don check them out again, because she couldn't have just said–
Tony shrugged, grinning up at him disarmingly. "So? I'm paying. I always pay for my dates."
"He's tough." Sam was staring down the hallway at Tony and the others' departing backs, with his head cocked to one side slightly the way he did when he was thinking about something. "I don't know why I didn't see the two of you coming. As a girl, he's just your type."
"I don't know. I don't think he really knows what's going on right now."
The floorboards beneath him were just beginning to become uncomfortably hard when Steve's Avengers communicator, lying out of the way atop a pile of boxes, came to life with a soft ping. Beside him, Tony went stiff, his shoulders jerking.
Tony rose up onto the balls of his feet, grabbed Hank by the shoulders, and pulled him forward into a kiss.
Steve groaned. "Damn it. I was hoping she'd stay Nick's problem." He turned to Ben, holding out a hand for the other man to shake. "Thank you for being understanding. Jarvis will see you out. We can finish the interview later."
"I-" Tony started. Then he was silent for a long moment. "I don't know," he said finally, voice uneven. "I was so sure that- I said I sounded crazy. Maybe I was. Things haven't made sense in so long that I just don't know anymore."
Carol shrugged, tucking a piece of hair behind one ear. "If there hadn't been... a lot of missed opportunities, the two of us could have-um..." She waved her hands in an equally vague gesture.
After nearly four straight hours in the air, it was a welcome sight.
not to use them. Because not using his powers was better than being miserable and out of control all the time, and being left out of things was better than losing it at the wrong moment.
Steve let the topic of Happy drop. "I still think Carol and Clint would have enjoyed it if they'd come."
She made a face, gathering them up again. "Every spread I do comes out like this. It's statistically impossible. Even
Steve nodded.  He  didn't even consciously think about not ordering alcohol when Tony was  around anymore, which probably should have been some kind of clue that  things between them had been more serious than Steve had realized for a  long time.  He didn't mind; he'd always liked coca cola.  During the  war, you could get it on all the American air bases in England, and it  had tasted just the way it did at home.  He liked M&M's for much the  same reason -- the army had put them in C rations, and when it was cold  and wet and you'd just walked ten miles in ankle deep mud listening to  the Howling Commandos bicker with each other, you were really grateful  for those pathetic little pieces of candy-coated chocolate.
Hank left the elevator quickly, his movements jerky, every line of his body radiating a mix of anger, frustration, and guilt. Clint sidestepped just in time to avoid running into him; Hank had a bad habit of taking his anger out on other people. Verbally, usually, but Clint wasn't in the mood for a pointless argument with Hank right now.
"This is different," Steve muttered.
"Have you seen Tony?" Steve's split lip was immaterial; he needed to find Tony, to deal with this, whatever it was, before it got any worse. "I need to talk to him."
He'd go insane, the way all the other surviving Extremis test subjects had.
She'd already asked about Pietro, even though just the thought of what Strange might say had filled her stomach with a sick, hollow pain, but he had been able to tell her nothing, offering only the vague reassurance that Chthon had probably not been able to possess him the way he had Wanda, and that he'd likely been able to influence him only while he'd been in close physical proximity to her. Did her brother still have his powers? Had he been one of the lucky ones who'd been spared, or one of the people her spell had destroyed? Even if he had been, it didn't mean—his powers might have been restored last night, when she had ended the spell. His mutation was primarily energy-based, like hers, like Magneto's. It had been the people with major physical mutations who had died, and the mutants with flying powers who had been airborne. Unless Pietro had been running over water. He did that, sometimes, just to show off, or for the sheer joy of running as far as he could without needing to slow down.
Thor took a step back, clearly preparing to kick the door in, and Tony quickly over-rode the electronic lock with the Extremis and ordered it open.  Doom was going to do enough damage the Mansion without them adding to it.
There were things he ought to be doing, but for a moment, he let himself sit quietly across from Wanda and just be grateful that she was all right, and to try, again, to block out the memory of Tony’s blood seeping through his fingers.
"... and Hank was a really bad idea, but I've always had a weakness for blonds. And for people who would be terrible for me."
Every time she and Hank had returned from some social function, Hank had always come straight into the living room, thrown himself down on a couch, and sighed about how awful it had been to anyone who had been willing to listen. Jan had always followed close behind him, except for the couple of occasions when it truly had been awful, in which case Hank had gone to hide in his lab.
"No, it's all right," Tony interrupted. "I don't mind. Since I'm stuck with this body at least until morning, I might as well start figuring out how it works."
Steve began pacing back and forth from the massive black gas range to the table, still strewn with cookbooks. John Walker's book of manly grilling recipes had been relegated to the far corner of the table, along with a vegetarian cookbook that he was pretty sure belonged to Wonder Man - Simon went through periodic health-nut phases that only ever lasted until the next time Beast showed up bearing grocery bags full of Twinkies and potato chips. "Strange doesn't like to leave the Village, unless it's to visit other dimensions. Maybe you'd better send Tony here. Wanda, too. She'll be able to give Strange a rundown on what happened." And, Loki or no, she was still the Avengers' expert on chaos magic.
"I wouldn't wish the kind of press this would have gotten you on anyone." Hank said. He held up one finger. "But if you ever call in for emergency backup again and refuse to tell anyone what's wrong with you until we get there... I thought you were dying."
There was at least a quarter of an hour until Tony had to leave for his meeting; Steve let himself soak in the sound of Tony's breathing, the press of his weight against him, and stared up at the blank, white walls around them, trying to envision them covered in paintings and photographs. All of his old art had vanished somewhere, but he could always draw more, and Jan would probably leap at the chance to look through a few art galleries and help find them something to cover all those barren walls. If he left it to Tony, they would either end up surrounded by images of the Avengers, or live in modernist sterility surrounded by ugly, angular furniture.
Matt's boots were silent on the stone floor as he came to stand beside Strange, the soles made of soft leather, or something else designed to let him move with barely a sound. "Do you... hear something?" he asked quietly. His chin was tilted up, his head cocked slightly to the left, as if he were trying to pinpoint the source of a sound. "Something whispering?" Strange began to say no, his attention still on the coil of energy in front of him, when he heard it, a faint susurrus of sound just within the threshold of audibility. As soon as he became aware of it, the volume increased, until it sounded as if someone – or something – was whispering in his ear, the words too garbled to make out.
"Not in combat."
Clint sighed. "Damn. I was afraid of that."
Thor frowned. He hesitated a moment, then gave voice to the concern he did not — quite — resent feeling. "It is more than that."
Wanda was saved from having to reply to his probably-trite platitudes by their arrival at the Mansion's back door, where they caught up with Tony, Don, and Hank.
All right, Steve decided. They all needed sleep. The media would just wait, because there was no way most of the people in this room were going to get through a press conference without making absolute idiots of themselves.
"I have to hit you harder to knock you down than you have to in order to knock me down. It's basic physics."
"Oh.   Right."  Peter made mental note to avoid asking about kinky lawyer  threesomes next time he saw Matt, no matter how tempting it might be.   He didn't really want to know; Matt just turned really entertaining  colors when you asked him personal questions.  On the other hand, Foggy  Nelson, Matt's legal partner and possible fellow kinky lawyer threesome  member, might hear him and actually answer.  Foggy was good at answering  questions you didn't really want to know the answers to, and also liked  seeing Matt turn colors.
"It doesn't look too bad," Wanda offered. "I've seen Clint's car look worse, and you were always able to fix that." Jan wasn't sure if she was trying to be helpful, or making a joke at both Clint and Tony's expense.
He could see his chances of that receding as Steve frowned and shook his head. "I haven't spoken to either of them in a week."
The ice pack felt good against his shoulder, but it was starting to make his fingers numb; the leather of his gloves was thinner than the rest of his costume, for flexibility's sake. Steve shifted his grip on the ice pack and wondered when exactly his team had started to fall apart.
Or he hadn't been able to bring himself to change it and shut Steve out of his life that last little bit; the way Steve hadn't been able to keep himself from answering when Tony had called his cell phone.
She was trying out a twelve-foot tall height similar to Hank's old Goliath form, so the lasers affected her less than they would have at Wasp size, but the unfamiliar size also made her less graceful than usual. Jan had been able to grow as well as shrink for over a year now, but she almost never used the ability, and it took significant amounts of practice to get used to fighting while giant-sized, or even simply moving around.
The elevator doors opened with a discrete, expensive-sounding chime. It was a far shorter ride than it had been in the tower, but by the time he stepped out into the ground floor hallway, Steve's frustration had shifted focus from Tony to himself. Why had he let himself get sucked in to such a pointless argument? He knew Tony hadn't been using the Extremis — if nothing else, he wouldn't have been typing so fiercely if he had been — but he still couldn't help worrying, or the momentary flash of suspicion he felt whenever Tony closed his eyes and rubbed at his face or temples while working on something. He'd seen that gesture so often while they had been trying to take down the Red Skull and the Mandarin, when Tony had been so completely and continuously immersed in the Extremis that he'd forgotten to eat, stopped sleeping, and begun having the first few of what had become a long series of nosebleeds.
"Fine. The autopilot kicked before that happened. That's what it's there for." Tony paused, then added, "This is going to take forever to fix. I don't even want to look at the quinjet."
"I didn't think it would work," Steve explained. "I just couldn't stand doing nothing. The over-ride code I used was my old one. Tony never changed it."
"I'm trying not to think about that." Tony sighed. "Let's just go tell everyone else that I'm stuck like this and get that fun experience over with."
"I don't think I've been to this restaurant before," Tony added. He would have remembered the Art Nouveau murals on the walls, particularly since one of them featured a nude woman whose modesty was preserved only by a few peacock feathers and some wisps of white cloth. The peacock motif was echoed in the architecture, and Tony suspected that the murals were as old as the building, though beautifully restored. He wondered if it restaurant was a family business, if Steve had ever been here back when it had been new. From the look of the place, the hotel the restaurant was attached to was Edwardian, and easily predated Steve, but its old glory days would have extended well into the twenties. "What do they have that's good?" he asked.
He and Wanda had been waiting for Strange for fifteen minutes at this point. Tony had given up any pretense of patience three minutes ago and gotten up to pace back and forth across the lab. Hank's lab. He still thought of it that way even though Hank hadn't used it in nearly a year.
"The timing worked out very nicely for you, didn't it?" Byrne said. "Captain America coming back just when you needed him. Talk about fortunate coincidences, huh?"
"The city's going to want me to pay for that lamppost," Tony said. It wasn't an actual answer, but he wasn't sure he could give one right now. He wasn't actually injured, beyond the bruises, but there was definitely
It felt no different. Not forced or hesitant. Steve wasn't holding anything back, was kissing Tony with as much enthusiasm as he ever had. He released Tony's arms, one hand suddenly flat against Tony's back and the other sliding into the back pocket of his jeans, pulling Tony's body against his. "You didn't come home last night," he said into the side of Tony's throat, pressing an open-mouthed kiss against the pulse point under Tony's jaw. "I've wanted to get my hands on you like this for two days now." The words vibrated across his skin, and Tony could feel the hard length of Steve through both their clothing, the evidence of Steve's arousal sending all of Tony's good intentions out the window. Screw being noble, he decided, letting the screwdriver clatter to the floor and sliding his hands down to Steve's impossible perfect ass, grinding his own erection into Steve's. No one should be expected to be noble under these circumstances.
He'd been wrong about a lot of things lately, but not about this. He couldn't keep this baby. Even if it meant losing Steve. Not telling him about the pregnancy would have been easier, and would probably have hurt Steve less in the long run, but Wanda was right. He had had the right to know. And the guilt over keeping the secret would probably have eventually become even more painful than the misery of having Steve know everything. Probably.
He let go of Tony's shoulder and took an abrupt step backward, feeling his face heat. "Thank you," he said, feeling suddenly awkward. "For explaining."
"Captain America, Steve, have you ever been with another man before Tony?"
Sam was leaning forward slightly, looking deeply relived that the conversation had gotten away from Tony and back to the matter at hand.  "Luke and Spiderman still have their Avengers communicators," he said.  "We can stay in contact with them that way."
. Chthon's hollow, whispery voice stabbed at his brain, the syllables like the crackling of fire, or the crunching of tiny, dried bones.
Steve found himself snorting with suppressed laughter. It probably wouldn't been so funny if he weren't so tired, but he'd never heard Clint's inexplicable combination of suede kilt and geometrically patterned headband described quite that way before, and Wanda was so utterly right. Clint had looked like Pocahontas from that Disney cartoon, except blond, and with biceps.
"My device worked just fine," Tony snapped, a brittle edge in his voice that probably had as much to do with pain as anything else.  "He was using some kind of magic."
"Superpowered people depend too much on their powers in a fight," Clint said, and Hank didn't have to look at the monitor screen to know he was smirking, "and now that you can't use yours, you need to practice fighting the way us mere mortals do."
"I'm not hiding," Hank said sullenly. "I'm avoiding him because he hates me."
For an endless moment, nothing happened, but then the soft beep of the heart monitor sped up slightly, and Tony’s eyebrows drew together in a faint frown.
When Hank arrived fifteen minutes later, Barnes was slumped in one of the kitchen chairs with his head resting on his folded arms, breath wheezing painfully in his lungs. Sharon was sitting next to him, one hand on his shoulder, while Steve hovered awkwardly in the background.
"Leave it alone," Hank snapped. "Half the equipment in here right now is in a state of dimensional flux. One surge of chaos power while it's still recovering the rest of its mass will fry everything."
It just hadn't felt like the right time to unpack them yet.
He and Jan had been in a restaurant. There had been poison, and a riot.
Steve shook his head. "No," he said gently. "They're unconscious. No one's dead."
The air was thick with dust, and her eyes kept tearing up. Carol tried to use the back of her arm to wipe some of the fine, grey and white powder out of her eyes, and only succeeded in making it worse. There were times when she seriously considered adding goggles to her costume, regardless of how silly they would look.
Steve checked his watch, found that only seven minutes had passed since the last time he'd checked it, and sighed. Calling Tony's office again would only get him an answering machine at this time of night, and contacting him via the Avengers communicator built into the armor would be an abuse of team communications equipment.
"Of course it does," Tony interrupted. "You're you. Always so chivalrous; it's one of the things I like about you."
Sam didn't need to know.  And telling him about the dream wouldn't help, anyway.  Talking about them had never had much of an effect on whether or not they recurred or how quickly they went away.
they'd submitted the lowest bid, without sacrificing quality or functionality to do so. Tony had worked fourteen-hour days with the engineers on the project for two weeks straight, to ensure that their prototype was ready under budget and before the deadline, despite the fact that they had begun work on the project months - and in one case, over a year - after their competitors had.
Steve set a hand on each of Tony's shoulders, turning him gently until they were facing one another again. "It's okay," he said - babbled, really, the words sounding like they were coming from someone else. "We'll figure this out."
Sam was frowning now, his initial shock gone. "What happens if he changes back by himself? If the spell wears off before the kid is born?"
Outside the airplane's thick window, the tops of fluffy white clouds glowed in the sun, almost blindingly bright. Only when she touched the window and felt the chill seeping in through the glass did it become obvious how cold it was outside. Those smooth, white mounds of cloud might as well have been snow.
The room was still littered with the remains of deactivated Doombots, which meant not everything that had come with Doom had vanished when he did.
He was pretty sure that if Pepper had been around during the past couple of years, rather than taking a well deserved break, he wouldn't have lost the company and had to scramble to get it back. He was never, ever going to tell her that, though. It would make it sound like he was blaming her for leaving, when all the blame lay squarely on his own shoulders.
There was a blur of red at the corner of his vision, and Steve automatically focused on it long enough to see Sam dive through Doom's legs to snatch the Dee manuscript up off the pavement.
Doom laughed.  It was the sort of sound that should have been accompanied by pipe organs and a crash of dramatic thunder.  "You think to insult Doom?  I will beyond such petty concerns soon."
And just like that, Jan realized, the painful, frozen tension in the air was gone. Well, if you ignored the fact that Hank was still staring at his feet and hadn't spoken since apologizing for being here, Vision was still pretending to be incapable of speech at all, and Tony was doing the bantering thing with everyone
Tony nodded tiredly, then watched in silence as she left the lab. He didn't want to think about wearing women's clothing yet. He wasn't entirely sure he wanted to take the dress shirt and trousers he currently had on off; the body underneath wasn't his anymore. Admittedly, his body was on the battered side, even attractive as it was, but he'd rather have his own damaged heart and liver and shrapnel scars than some strange woman's body, even if it was genetically identical to his own save for a single chromosome.
Magic?  Some kind of coercion?  Thor would have given himself up for any one of the others, probably even Tony.
"I didn't mean it that way," Clint lied. "You're not a doctor. You haven't taken the Hippocratic oath."
Tony gave a little half-smile. "That's my fault," he said wryly. "I tossed you into the deep end of the pool without bothering to tell you how to swim."
Several endless seconds passed, during which Tony failed to open his eyes.  "What's wrong with him?" Steve asked, tearing his gaze away from Tony's face to look at Thor.  He was a doctor, some of the time, or at least, Don Blake was.  How much of his medical knowledge did Thor have?  However much, it was more than Steve, whose knowledge of medicine involved mainly CPR and first aid and how to administer a morphine injection and apply a tourniquet in a battlefield situation.
The thing's jaws snapped shut on empty air, and then Sam dropped from the sky and hit it full-force, the momentum of the impact knocking it away from Clint. Sam thrust the canister of antidote in its face, only to be brought up short as its tongue wrapped around his wrist.
No matter how tempting it became, he was not going to point out how much better it would have been to have her nominally on their side rather than against them.
Carol commented, tone dry as she could keep it while holding up several tons of brick and mortar.
Steve wasn't sure what he'd been expecting, but it wasn't this, wasn't Tony stiff-shouldered and refusing to meet his eyes. Tony on a stretcher, maybe, or Tony visibly ill.
Tony’s eyes widened, and he lifted his head slightly, trying to look down at his chest.  “I’m not going to die, am I?”  He sounded honestly concerned.  Then he closed his eyes for a moment, wincing, and answered himself.  “I’m not hooked up to enough monitors for that.”
Only, she had never told him why, and dying and coming back, getting a second chance... it ought to mean something, right? He hadn't had much time to think about it before, with everything going to hell, and then seeing Cap on the news, alive once more, and then all the reunions in DC, but he had time now, and the more he thought about it, the less sense it made. Why had Wanda chosen to bring him back, and not Vision, or her kids, or anyone else? She'd brought Simon back because they were in love, and had had that link thing going on. Cap coming back had this feeling of rightness to it; he deserved it, and people needed him, and it wasn't as if Clint thought he didn't deserve his own second shot at life (because he certainly hadn't deserved to die), but he wasn't Captain America. He didn't have people who needed him.
"He only fractured it," Steve said defensively. "He could have caved my skull in if he'd wanted to." Unarmored, Steve could mop the floor with Tony, but in the armor, Tony could go toe-to-toe with just about anyone short of the Hulk. And that wasn't even counting the repulsor gauntlets, which, as Tony had pointed out, could be deadly weapons.
Everyone in the room except for Clint was laughing. He suspected that they were all starting to hit the point where good judgment went out the window, himself included.
"The water is cold," Steve said, after a moment. "And I'm pretty sure the original point of this shower was to warm you up."
Wanda reached inside herself for the chaos magic that always waited there... and found nothing.
rests."
Sam had four tiny punctures on his shoulder, identical to the four tiny punctures on Clint's arm that Don Blake had rolled his eyes at and doused with hydrogen peroxide. "Don't forget to give him a tetanus shot," Clint called after them. "You have to take these sorts of things seriously."
"Are you all right? You sound strange?"
"That's great, Hank." Clint drew a deep breath in through his nose, and reminded himself that he really did like Hank. "I'm really glad I'm not a mutant and you and Jan are some kind half mutants or something. What's the medication for?"
The bolts attaching the chain to the wall gave with a violent jolt, Hank yelped as some part of him brushed the energy grid, and Don was suddenly dangling from one arm.
The alert jolted Tony out of a sound sleep, the Extremis sending it ringing through his skull and flashing the data against the backs of his eyes.
Steve wrenched harder at the breastplate, and was considering trying to pry one of the seams apart with the edge of his shield when a shadow loomed over him, blocking the light and making the near-invisible line that marked the border between the two plates of armor completely invisible.
"You don't have to stay," Steve said, more abruptly than he'd meant to. "I don't think it will do any good. I'm not sure
He understood storming out of a fight because you were too angry not to do or say something stupid if you stayed, but Tony hadn't looked angry when he'd left. He'd looked... strange. Upset. Steve had wondered for a half-second if he'd just been informed of some kind of disaster via the Extremis. Then he'd come back in with Jan, only a few minutes later, and appeared perfectly calm and in control. Reasonable. Willing to accept the team's decision, but with that tightness around his eyes that said he wasn't entirely happy with it.
He would have to think about it eventually, but at the moment, the mess she had left behind her was more than enough to deal with.
Steve grinned, feeling ridiculously pleased. Pepper was one of the only people left who had known Tony longer than he had, and her opinion was important to Tony; it was good to know that she didn't have any problem with their relationship -- though given how long she'd worked for Tony, the fact that Tony liked men as well as women couldn't have been much of a surprise.
"I'll go first," Jan said. "Here's an easy one. I've never slept with a woman."
"Are you okay?"
There were a few moments of silence while Steve listened to Tony breathe. Then, from beside the bed, there came a sort of scrabbling noise, the kind of sound that might be produced by claws on metal. It was followed by the very faint thud of a small, furry body sliding off Steve's shield and onto the floor, then by an even fainter hiss.
Afterwards, the two of them sat side-by-side on the floor, their backs against the wall of boxes, shoulders touching.
"Oh," Steve said, softly, hands twitching uselessly at his sides. He'd been almost certain something like that had been going through Tony's mind, but hearing Tony actually say it made Steve ache all over again, for how badly he had been hurting yesterday. He laid a hand on Tony's shoulder, just the way he had before they'd gone to bed, and brushed his thumb gently over the bare skin of Tony's neck. "I'm right here. None of that was real."
"Clint, does any of this sound like something you would do?"
"Even if they do, they're not leaving with it.  At least, not the way they came in."
At least they hadn't taken Sam.  The thought made him feel like a selfish bastard, as well as a terrible friend and team leader — he shouldn't be relieved to have one friend's safety come at the expense of another's — but Sin had a personal vendetta against all the people who'd been directly involved in the Red Skull's death, Sam included.  Tony was probably right that she would hand Jan and Hank over to Doom in order to keep his goodwill.  Sam, she would never have given up, no matter how many alliances it cost her.  And if past experience was anything to go by, she might actually have lived up to her threat to send his body parts to Bucky in a box.
It had always been the person, for him, whenever it had been serious, not the body they came in. Whitney's scarred face hadn't made a difference to him, and Bethany's strength and Indres' seductive smiles would have been just as irresistible if they had been men. Rhodey's piloting skills and ability to hold his own against Tony in a race or an argument and Steve's passion and confidence and overwhelming physical presence would have been just as sexy in a woman.
"Which part, the part where I'm being honest, or the eyelashes?" The music was winding down, the song coming to an end. Tony stopped moving, and Rhodey stopped with him.
Actually, it hadn't. And he preferred not to think about the fact that, as a high ranking SHIELD agent, Sharon had to have known. "Most of the time I have a longer reach than whomever I'm fighting," Steve observed, as he and Tony circled one another again. "I haven't got that advantage with you."
Repulsor blasts had no effect on it. Of course.
"I don't have a healing factor. I just heal quickly." Steve sat down on the edge of the bed, rotating his shoulder carefully. It really would be fine, he decided. Also, he needed a shower before he put civilian clothes on. He smelled like leather, sweat, and grass stains, thanks to all the rolling around on the lawn he'd done. And speaking of the fight earlier,..
"I know that whatever you do," Steve said, "it will be what you think is right. For yourself and for everyone else."
"Well, I guess you are Spiderman," she said, eyes widening for a second, before her expression eased into amusement. "Second floor, left wing, room 37a. Do you wear some kind of device that lets you do that, or is it organic?" she asked, tugging at the strand of webbing that was now attached to the corner of her clipboard.
"No, he's more like five people." Okay, it was a cheap shot, but he was so definitely not above it.
Cap sat down abruptly, hands over his face. There was a sudden flutter outside the window as Redwing took off, probably to go fetch Sam.
He brought his mouth down on Tony's hard, his tongue demanding entry, his fingers digging into Tony's arms.
Doom threw back his head and laughed.  "You and your pitiful fellow superheroes are no match for myself and Loki working together.  You couldn't even defend your own home from me, so how do they imagine you're going to stop me?"
His vision was coming back into focus now, and he could see Sin smiling down at him, all freckles and innocent-looking dimples.  "No," she said, "but that will change.  You'll beg me to kill you before I'm through with you.  You," she jerked her chin at her men.  "Grab the other two.  We're taking them with us.  Daddy did so much for you," she continued, pressing the knife harder into Sam's throat until he had to lean his head back as far as it would go to keep it from breaking his skin.  One scratch, and the snake venom she'd poisoned James with would be in his bloodstream.  "He gave you powers, the opportunity to serve a greater cause despite your inferior background, and you rejected it."
"Hmm- maybe, maybe not today. Still plan on riding you, babe."
Peter's answer was a big yawn and to stretch his arms out for Tony, who was closer. "Carry."
With an eyeroll, Tony took the tumbler out of Steve’s hand and gestured for them to sit back down.
“Let me make it up to you?”, Tony said in a soft voice. Steve felt a tingle running down his spine, turning his head slightly to look at Tony’s face, his smile, his eyes. He looked so earnest and mischievous at the same time and it broke Steve’s heart to know how many times Tony had gotten hurt in the past by him.
“Are you here to get your shield back?”, Tony asked hostilely.
Except, Steve had never come back from that mission.
“I never wanted to hurt you”, Steve whispered, tightening his hold on Tony’s hand.
After a leisurely early evening watching of The Lion King, a home-made dinner and the muffin as Peter's dessert, the kid was actually back to yawning. He almost fell asleep where he was sitting over his plate, only crumbs of the muffin left.
Tony shook his head and prepared his mouth to say ‘No fuck off’ but the next thing he knew was that he had basically jumped into Steve’s arms.
“I could just need some steadiness”, she said instead of wording her thoughts and smiled at the Captain. She reached for his hand; half a gesture for balance on the uneven battlefield that she still refused to look down onto, half a plea. “May I?”
Tony tensed up a little, Steve could feel it because he had his arms around him and his face pressed against him and his heart ached. “Sorry, I-“
Now it was Tony's turn to roll his eyes, but he giggled, leaning up to brush his fingers through Steve's wet hair. "Well, I guess if I get seduced by a beautiful blonde merman I won't be able to say no. What will my husband say when he hears about this?" With a theatrical sigh Tony threw his hands in the air and winked at Steve.
Mantis took Steve’s hand and reached for Tony’s. “Can’t, not until I know that you’re not getting worse. You’re like a feedback loop”, she added, her entire body trembling under the intensity of the emotions she picked up from their hands. She placed them on top of each other and Tony immediately tried to pull his hand away but she didn’t let him. “One negative emotion and you’re falling into a void”, she whispered. “How do you want to get out of it, all alone?”
, but Tony pressed a finger to his lips. “Now you say this?”, Tony went on quietly. “Now you say I’m
Tony was a little disappointed when it turned out to be empty – or at least its inhabitants had gone into hiding when Tony and Steve had started to jolt their homes with their rock climbing. But it didn't matter much because he had a far more interesting specimen right in front of him.
For a moment Steve just kept playing with Tony's hair until he softly asked: "Did you tell him to go to sleep?"
“You should have thought of that sooner”, Tony finally said. His voice sounded hoarse and he couldn’t look Steve in the eyes anymore.
After this small speech Steve exhaled and took a tiny step back, waiting for Tony’s answer.
"Perfect", Tony whispered, only pulling back enough that he could actually move his lips to voice the words. "Then I'll enjoy a wonderful evening with my family until then."
Steve had to grip the door frame to not fall back over. He was not over it. No matter how much time had passed in his perception since that day, since he had seen Tony’s body there on the battle field, he wasn’t ready.
Tony's pout got worse and he narrowed his eyes at Steve, crossing his arms over his chest even though Steve was still holding him safe and close in his arms. "Can you please stop making fun of me? That ruined it!"
“It means, we still changed things in the past. I think you fought yourself in the past. Things like that. It would’ve created a paradox. For example... let’s take an easy example. There’s a cake in the past and you time travel to eat a slice. Even if no one saw you, the person who would’ve originally eaten the slice of cake can now not do so. What happens now? It’s a paradox. Even if you bring the cake back – there is now somewhere, somehow, a reality where the person couldn’t eat their slice of cake. How will this impact the person’s future? It sounds ridiculous when it’s a cake, but every action in the past can have repercussions.” Tony had looked at Steve and licked his lips, putting his fork down. “Now I want cake.”
"Nah." Tony opened one eye enough that he could take a sip from his coffee. "He's so excited about reading it, want to encourage that. He's old enough to decide on his own if he needs an afternoon nap on an exhausting day or if he just wants to stay in his bed calmly for a while."
“That’s the last time we saw you. That was a couple months ago. You never came back from where you were supposed to place the stones back in 2012. We thought you’d maybe taken the chance to return to the 40s”, Tony had said over the curry he had heated up for dinner for them. He had looked like he had a lot of thoughts about Steve possibly returning to the 40s, but he’d kept them to himself. “Sam wanted to go look for you, but Bucky convinced him not to.”
"I think that was enough for today anyway, wasn't it?" Checking the big clock, Steve realised Peter had really been in the water for over half an hour.
Steve only nodded, the warm thrum of the arc reactor strangely familiar under his fingers.
“Can I take off your shirt?”, Steve asked out of breath, when Tony had taken off his and thrown it into a corner of the room only to lean up and kiss and lick and bite every inch of his chest.
He resumed his kissing and Tony started to move a little against Steve, their crotches brushing through the wet swimming trunks.
"You're pushy today", Steve remarked when Tony bit his bottom lip first and then kissed his way down over his neck again only to leave a bite mark there as well. Steve reciprocated by dragging his thumb over Tony's nipple and then over the arc reactor to the other nipple.
"Love seeing you like this", Steve whispered and lifted Tony's legs a little, adjusting his own position from kneeling to almost lying down. He took his time to lick over Tony's balls, swirling his tongue around them and making Tony curse loudly at the feeling before he pressed his thumb to Tony's perineum.
“Bedroom”, Tony agreed with a smirk; and then almost squeaked when Steve picked him up and carried him. “Fuck, that’s hot.”
“Well”, Tony had said with a sour expression on his face. “Wasn’t like we could’ve known that you were somehow still traipsing through the time stream. So after we all returned, Strange sealed the time stream off.”
He took a deep breath. He wasn’t prepared for a meeting with Steve. Not now. Not when he just spent five minutes staring at his bed and not, definitely not thinking about Steve. But apparently he didn’t have a choice because Tony was pretty sure that there weren’t 240lbs birds around New York City. And there was also only one face he had deleted out of the database and it belonged to a certain blonde super soldier.
Steve was still trying to catch his breath while Tony looked at his face. He was smiling, and he looked like he’d finally found what he was looking for. “I love you”, Tony said quietly.
"Hey, tiny, let's go and get you to bed, shall we?", Steve asked.
"Was a good day", Tony yawned.
anymore, do we?”
Tony was watching Steve, his every movement when he lubed up his fingers and started to massage Tony’s hole. “Hurry up”, Tony rasped out when Steve took his time to even dip the first finger inside. “I need you inside me!”
A few meters next to them Mantis breathed out. “I’ve never felt so many repressed feeling before”, she said, her eyes big and sad. “Tony may have been disappointed by the world more often than anyone else, but that might be the only thing he never placed his trust in.” She pointed at the kissing couple. “Steve’s love.”~
Suddenly Tony sat up though and made his 'I am a genius and just had the best idea ever' face. It usually made Steve suspicious, but the hour of jumping through the pool with Peter, the pool side picknick and now a cuddle session had made him sleepy.
Steve watched him, Tony's lean body between his legs until he decided it was time to tease Tony back. He pulled him back up and sat him on his lap so that his erection rubbed against Tony's ass. "Want to bet how long it takes me to make you impatient?", Steve purred into Tony's ear. He let his fingers dance over Tony's cock, using a light rhythm he knew drove Tony insane.
Steve slowly pulled out and rolled to the side, keeping his arm around Tony and pulling him on his chest. Tony immediately snuggled closer, pulling up the duvet with neither of them caring that they smeared lube and come all over the sheets.
“So what am I going to do now?”, Steve asked when Tony came back, drying his hands on the towel before throwing it on the counter.
Scrambling to find a good ending for his sentence, Steve lamely settled on: “If we won.”
A little giggle escaped Peter, but it disappeared into another yawn. "They invaded the tower, dad! I couldn't do anything about it."
In a few months the house arrest rules would be retracted along with Tony’s position as the fellow super humans’ keeper. Then he could go and run off in the woods and drink himself to death for all anyone cared.
“Tony?” A slightly groggy voiced Steve called out from under their tree as he buttoned his jeans.
But Steve’s frustratingly pretty blue eyes gave him nothing. It seemed like the more you pushed the man the less you got back. He was a wall.
Tony looked serious again, “what if it did kill you Steve? Why would that be the better option? If one of us gets out of here it’ll be you.”
“I’m just saying it could be best if we stayed closer together when we slept tonight.”
Steve popped a few of the salvaged berries into his mouth after they’d washed them off in the river. Then, Tony brought him to a few different spots of underdeveloped trees that Steve could easily snap into smaller sections.
Brain like a bag full of cats, huh?
long term relationships in the news before Pepper.
long?”
Steve closed his eyes.
“Tony?”
And Tony knows all too well what happens to you if you get in the way of said mission.
His voice came out softer than he’d spoken to anyone in probably years. There was no trace of Captain America in it, no demand or or pressure behind it. It was 5’4” tiny Brooklyn Steve Roger’s voice. The voice he used when he’d comfort his mother, or asked Rebecca Barnes how school was. The voice he used when he & Bucky would lay awake in a tiny apartment and talk about what the future held.
After that idiotic letter that essentially was only an apology for Tony’s
Tony noted the scowl that threatened to envelope the Captain’s face.
He was still breathless when he looked up at Steve, “I know, I’m sorry… I don’t know what the fuck I just saw.”
per say, more like two faces. Two freaky, golden eyed, tongued out faces.”
His own traitor brain teased him.
It was as if Tony lived his life unable to flip into the default settings so many people appeared to operate under. So many people had normal childhoods with normal parents, went to normal schools and normal colleges, found normal jobs and developed normal habits. People married those they loved and those that loved them, unconditionally.
Call him self absorbed, call him a pessimist, call him pathetic,
“Tony?” He called out again, louder this time.
Its antlers were a deep emerald color, its eyes a golden yellow…all three of them. Two snouts pointing away from each other at a 90 degree angle. There were each eyes on the opposing sides of each snout and one in the middle of its skull.
The power of the water fall drowned out Steve’s voice as he called out Tony’s name. He figured it would be better to just approach him and get his attention in person. Steve rounded the textured wall of rock to look upon the waterfall.
It was daytime, he guessed only because it was slightly lighter out than the previous night. His face was pressed into the pine needles on the ground and he narrowly dodged some of the lower hanging canopy branches as he sat up. His jeans tugged awkwardly as he stretched his legs & hissed in pain.
“God I Hope not.”
“Yes and no, like I said it didn’t have two
Steve’s stomach decided it was an opportune time to grumble, and he made the snap decision to catch it. The water was shallow enough to walk in with his boots. The fish payed him no mind until he quickly snatched it up with his hands.
Even in the throws of a brainwashed bestie, the UN’s looming asses, and his teammates begging him to come with them, he was a man on a mission.
deer?” Steve asked for what must’ve been the third time once they finally settled on the ground.
“And… and you don’t want me to say anything?”
Tony gave the slightest nod and they both smothered the fire until it was out.
But Steve hadn’t realized how quickly he came to care about Tony until the man finally opened his eyes after dropping from the wormhole. He knows his face was pretty damn obvious: huge smile plastered on a face filled with relief. It took him a while, a
He couldn’t call out to Tony now, it would’ve been too obvious he’d seen at least some of it. He ducked his head, cheeks red with shame and quickly made his way back to the camp while ignoring the uncomfortable feeling in his uniform pants.
"Steve, I swear", Tony moaned when Steve rubbed deliberately over Tony's prostate while tracing his rim with his tongue. "You swear what?", Steve purred, his voice so low and rough that it made Tony jerk his hips up a little.
For a while they just kept sitting there, hands running over each other's bodies and making out without hurry; just enjoying the feeling of each other's arms and tongues and lips in the warm sun.
Tony still waggled his fingers around. "It was that damn algae! It's on my fingers now!"
Tony was lying comfortably in a beach chair next to the big indoor pool in the Avengers tower, enjoying the view of a wet Steve in shorts. Of course that was not the main point of him being here; he was here to cheer Peter on who had another swimming lesson under Steve’s supervision.
"There's nobody like you", Tony said, leaning his forehead against Steve's. "'s why you married me", Steve gave back; both of them referencing their new status as husbands as often as possible.
Tony hid his face in Steve's neck, mumbling something into the sensitive skin there and sending a shudder down Steve's spine.
Guilt, anger, sadness, shame, self-hatred, disgust. Agitation and so much self-loathing that Mantis’ vision went blurry with tears. The emotions seemed to whirl together and multiply with every passing second, frustration, anger and trepidation mixing into it; making him seem alone and helpless in his sadness and dread. But everything was tinted with a layer of hope, bittersweet and misfitting and somehow making everything worse. She took in a deep breath, drawing her hand back so forcefully that she stumbled backwards but she’d rather sit in the mud all day than feel that any longer. Her heart beat was booming in her head, her breathing coming in short gasps and the feeling of unease didn’t fully leave her body even when she didn’t touch Tony anymore.
He looked away, and grasped for a new subject. "According to Steve, Fury's afraid Doom's still working with Red Skull."
It looked barren, he decided. Bare wooden floor, bare brick walls with nothing on them but the couple of old war bond posters he'd stuck up yesterday. It was nothing like the Avengers Mansion.
He threw a jab at Sam's torso, already knowing which direction he was going to turn in order to let the punch slip past him, and followed it up in quick left hook that connected solidly with Sam's jaw.
"So," Wanda said, her expression serene, "in order to give Clint's brain time to start functioning, because we all know his fragile masculinity would never have stood up to this one: I've never slept with a man."
Tony looked up at him silently. Steve looked tired, with red-rimmed eyes, and unshaven, though the stubble was so blonde that it was barely noticeable. As soon as Tony got dressed and checked himself out, they could both go home and go to sleep.
"Oh, it won't be because I'm a woman." If there was one thing his fellow businessmen excelled at, it was finding justifications for not hiring or promoting women or minorities that didn't actually involve their being women and minorities. Tony had used it to his advantage before; people who'd been unjustly passed over for promotion three times tended to jump at the chance to leave their current place of employ and come and work for him, especially when he offered them the higher paying job with greater responsibility that they should have already had. "It will be because they 'don't believe' I'm really Tony Stark, or because being transformed into a woman has clearly unhinged my mind, or they're concerned for my health, or something."
"Actually, no," he said. "She was a very good dancer. She was very good at everything."
The lost time hadn't alarmed him then, unimportant in the face of everything else; it was only looking back that he could see how fucked up he'd been.
"Steve left me a message?" The disproportionate swell of pleasure he felt at the idea was silly, he knew, but even having Steve's friendship back was still enough to make him want to grin uncontrollably, and now... Tony had thought their friendship had been destroyed for good, had never expected Steve to so much as exchange the time of day with him again, let alone forgive him or understand why he had done the things he had, and while he was pretty sure that Steve still didn't understand, he was going to assume that the sex meant that he was forgiven.
Tony held a small, glass vial out to Hank, its contents as clear as water. It looked ordinary, non-threatening.
Sin turned, either sensing them or hearing Tony's jet boots, and swept the spear sharply in their direction.
He and Thor turned at the same time, both of them shouting warnings.  The Doombot fired, Steve ducked, and Mjolnir smashed into the Doombot's skull all in the same instant.
The glass wall of the shower was completely transparent, not clouded or rippled to create privacy -- Fury had said it was a security measure -- and so Steve had a clear view of Tony.
cared about Narnia, but that didn't change the fact that he had visibly teared up at the end of
The breastplate finally came free, a hole wide enough for three of Steve’s fingers punched straight through it.  Beneath it, his white dress shirt was soaked in blood.
"I had..." He'd eaten something that morning, hadn't he? "A muffin. With my coffee."
Going by the radio chatter that kept intruding on Carol's concentration, the tentacle monster secreted some kind of acidic slime. And had barbed suction cups on the undersides of its dozen arms. Carol breathed through her mouth, trying not to sneeze at the haze of plaster dust in the air, and reflected that it probably said something about her that that sounded like a more appealing challenge than this.
"I can imagine quite a bit of power." The mask did not permit him the luxury of a sneer, but Doom had had years to practice conveying emotion with his voice. "I do not need your aid to gain possession of the spear; once the book and the ritual it contains are mine, all will fall into my hands. Why settle for the favors of a god when I can become one?"

He'd never asked her what she wanted him to tell the rest of the team. Maybe Cap and Sam and Thor didn't have to know; at least she'd have some privacy left that way.
"She's who?" Sam was staring at him, eyebrows arched. "Since when has Loki been a woman?"
Tony shook his head, his stomach hollow. "Just tell me now and get it over with." She wouldn't meet his eyes, which didn't necessarily mean anything with Maya — like Reed, she didn't feel that actually looking at people was necessary for conversation — but they never asked you to sit down for good news.
