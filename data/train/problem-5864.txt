He made Pepper CEO and devoted his time to working on his Iron Man armor and being Iron Man. With it, he was not only righting the wrongs his company’s weapons had brought about, but he was also brought people hope. He was considered a vigilante by the U.S. government and a lot of major news corporations but he was beginning to hear whispers of words like “superhero.” It made him giddy whenever he heard it and was reminded of the feeling he had as a child, bearing a fake shield and searching for Hydra in his mother’s prize rose garden.
“He stepped out this morning, said he needed to get something,” Tony murmured then yawned loudly. His boyfriend’s lips twitched into a smirk and he added, “A
“Gimmie,” Tony murmured, making grabby hands at the water. The water was passed down the line of men and Tony finally poured the water in his mug and sloshed it around to better mix in the powdered coffee. He sighed, “I miss real coffee…”
Natasha didn't know what to expect when she lowered her weapon and decided not to shoot her soulmate…
They were ambushed and, when it looked hopeless, they both turned their guns on each other. Natasha’s aim was unsteady because her hands were shaking but she was able to clearly state for the first and last time, “I love you, James.”
“…And I’d be alone,” she replied, kissing the pulse point in his neck. She continued, “I was nobody…just a puppet, before I met you. My world has changed too, Stepan-not-Stepan.” She said the name with a wily grin and cupped the side of his face.
Peter bit his lip and felt tears pooling in his eyes again. It seemed like all he was good for now was crying. He sobbed, “I am
“Pops, just get dressed and don’t look at anything too close and Dad, give me your hand,” Peter said.
Steve nodded with a clenched jaw. It was a problem but it was one he would have to face tomorrow. Today, he had to get Peter to Bruce.
Tony’s first reaction was to bristle with indignation. Bruce had a cure already?? Why hasn’t he said anything?? Then he processed the rest of Jarvis’s words and his anger dropped significantly.
The Hydra agents all looked to one man in particular and he nervously stepped forward, saying, “That would be me…”
Cable and Fury came to a stop before them and Cable grumbled, “Before we go back to the past, I need to stab Wade at least three times.”
“Promise me not to overthink everything?” Steve asked because Tony was always overthinking and he did not want to make this situation any worse in the confines of his mind.
“Best. Birthday. Present. Ever.” Peter replied breathlessly. Wade chuckled and lay on top of Peter, resting his chin on top of his arms right above Peter's receding heartbeat. Peter put his hands on Wade's biceps and reiterated, “You are the best.”
Tony felt a flair of indignation at the mention of Wade. Of course, May liked the man. She was civil with Tony and just barely at that…
Steve raised his head. Pepper was kneeling next to them with a large, wobbly but happy smile. Around them, hospital staff and patients were openly staring and several had their phones out pointed at him.
Tony ducked his head under the showerhead one last time and reached up to run his hands through his hair. He flexed his muscles out more than usual for Steve’s benefit and Steve hummed in approval.
Steve instantly fisted the mattress, digging his fingers deeper inside the mattress as Tony’s finger stretched him and touched him where he never been touched before.
They stood in the wreckage of their living room, their hearts heavy and bitter from the senseless loss of both the peace of their new home and of the attack in their city.
This time it was Steve to break it as he stated, “In the future…when Fury…when Fury was trying to bargain for your life with the Goblin, he had mentioned the Chitauri.”
Mary ducked her head and murmured, “You’re being nice. I have some wrinkles that have cropped up over the years.”
“It’s Vibranium, like your shield,” Tony explained. Tony pulled out his ring and stated, “And like the core of my heart.” Steve wordlessly took the ring from Tony and slid it onto Tony’s finger. Steve took the same hand and kissed its palm. Tony watched it all with a hooded gaze then met Steve’s eyes and smiled.
?!” Peggy’s voice called over the radio in front of them. That’s right, Aunt Peggy was there for him at the end. The heartbreak of their romance and final moments were as well known as the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet…
The entire team attended as support with the exception of Bruce was back at the Tower with his soulmate, Betty. Their relationship had been strained over the years as Bruce had been scared to be close to her with the Hulk looming in the background. With his move to New York, he had reached out to her and they were rekindling what they once had.
The gas was turned off and an expert was promised to come in, in the morning to fix the oven and, until then, the house was safe enough to return to but…but Howard did not feel safe. Maria must not have either because she put up no arguments when he suggested they all get a room in the city for the night.
“You two scared the Devil out of me I thought you were dead!” Tony gasped indignantly. He glared down at Steve and said, “And you! That’s twice
“Not to mention how yous met,” Bucky added, a little bit of a Brooklyn drawl slipping into the words as he slouched on the stool, leaning slightly onto Steve.
“Oh, come on, I’m trying to do the same with mechanical science! Maybe whatever you did will help me with what I’m trying to achieve…”
Wade wryly chuckled and let go of Peter’s waist to cup his cheek. He whispered, “Last time they were too late and I didn’t even hear them until…” Wade dropped his head on Peter’s shoulder and gasped, “We did it, baby boy. You’re alive! We beat them.”
“—and don’t forget the eggrolls, Jarvis,” Tony commanded, drawing Steve out of the comatose state he was in.
The others laughed at him as he marched over to Tony but Steve smiled at his friend, grateful for his nurturing albeit concerned nature. Bucky pulled Tony out of the tent and whispered to him, probably telling him off for being such a civilian. In moments, Tony’s tent was down and they were working together to get it rolled up.
! No! What are you doing!? Stop!” Pepper wildly gasped and pulled him upright. She continued, “We have a broom and dustpan. You could hurt yourself! Let me see your hand!”
Steve grinned ruefully and said, “I’m sorry to disappoint you, Marston, but I’m not here to talk about Peter.”
His question was answered as they entered the kitchen and found it completely destroyed. The refrigerator, thrice the size of a normal one, had been ripped out of the wall and lay in the middle of the kitchen with a dagger sticking out of its side. The microwave was half imbedded in the wall. Nearly all the cabinet doors were broken, either caved in or totally torn off. The oven was the only thing that was still whole, probably because the assassins still had enough semblance not to mess with the lone appliance with flammable gas.
Tony groaned deeply and threw back his head into the couch’s cushion. He and the others were sitting in the main room with the news playing out over the big screen. They were getting little to no tidbits of information and the news stations were switching from the scene between Steve and Tony to Steve entering the police station. His laptop was providing no better information. Everyone wanted to gossip over the drama of the arrest and their emotional parting. It was like something out of a soap opera and the media were eating it all up.
The man, Harold as stated by his name tag, put on some glasses and peered at the list. He nodded and said, “Yes, yes…and….yes, we have all of these. I just need to go into the back to retrieve them.”
Steve's blush returned with a vengeance as he remembered last night and Bucky smirked in victory. Steve grumbled, “Tony may have said some things…”
“Tony,” Steve gasped and he remembered his body’s condition and quickly sat at the counter to hide it. Tony stood on the other side of the counter and was in the middle of making coffee. He too looked like he just rolled out of bed and was wearing flannel pajama bottoms and nothing else. Steve’s eyes were drawn to the glowing arc reactor in Tony’s chest then trailed down, taking in his defined muscles and the little trail of hair that disappeared into his waistband. Steve flushed and dropped his gaze before Tony noticed.
“You’re responsible for all of this! You created Venom! How do I save my son?! Tell me!!” Iron Man demanded.
Clint grasped the phone with a pained hiss. As he held it, another text came in. Clint whispered, “All it says is Ohio.”
The door had closed behind them and blue glow from Tony’s arc reactor was the only light for them to see by. It bathed Steve in its illumination and reflected brightly in Tony’s eyes. Tony’s eyes glowed like a cat’s in the dark and made Steve feel like a mouse cornered and caught in his gaze. Tony slunk over Steve with practiced grace. He sandwiched his legs around Steve’s hips and ran his rough fingers over the skin of his abdomen until his fingers caught the top of Steve’s slacks.
Peter turned around to watch Steve walk up to the table. He went straight to Tony and placed his hands on his shoulders. His father instantly leaned into Steve but Wade did not react to Steve’s presence.
Bucky finally smirked at that. He returned to Steve and pulled him into a tight embrace. Steve returned the hug the best he could with his one arm and even pressed his face into Bucky's shoulder.
Natasha positioned herself in the doorway and had her gun level at the only exit, waiting for the Red Skull or his agents to storm in.
[Because the world’s eyes will be on us! Imagine all that disgust! I can feel it crushing me already!]
By the time Clint reached the scene, Natasha was sitting on a pile of police officers and any bystanders had fled the area. She stated, “The Winter Soldier was seen exiting this alley holding this guy by the neck and shooting him in the chest. He ran back down the alley and disappeared less than an hour ago.”
“Well…this is awkward,” Tony said, slightly exasperated. “You tried to save me the other night and my first assumptions are that you’re a stalker or are after my stuff.”
Tony was where Bucky and Steve had left him hours prior in his private room. Steve stood outside it for several long moments, collecting his nerve.
Steve stared at the foldout with a bewildered expression and then asked, “Am I supposed to choose one of these women to be my ‘girlfriend?’”
On the remains of the floor above him, was an enormous green monster. The SHIELD title for it came to him immediately. “Goblin,” was definitely an appropriate descriptor.
The elevator doors opened and Jarvis stated, “Most likely because Master Parker is with him. I tried to warn you, Sir,” his AI added, with a hint of aspiration in its voice.
Tony slid his tongue up his cock from the base to the head then swallowed him whole. The breath caught in Steve’s throat. He had lost count the number of times he masturbated to the thought of another doing this to him and what he imagined was nothing close to what it really felt like. Tony’s body heat engulfed him and he slid Steve deep into his soft mouth.
His anger abated slightly. He was confused by the flicker of hope in the other man’s gaze and his own misery doubled with Steve’s. Could he be reading him wrong? His confusion was added to the mix and it made an odd blend of emotions that did not settle right within him.
“Venom would take control before he would let that happen!” Steve easily deduced. Tony winced and uneasily glanced behind his shoulder.
Steve glance at the metal suit. When it had opened he didn’t remember seeing any padding on the inside. He commented, “That doesn’t sound very comfortable.”
century was more of a bump and grind in loud, dark clubs with strangers. Steve, murmured, “Listen, the dancing was just me thinking aloud. It was more for me than Natasha. She would probably break Bucky’s nose again if he tried.”
“Miss Potts is coming down to the lab and the Colonel says it is a matter of national security that you tell him what you just did,” Jarvis relayed.
That’s right, Wade slept over. They had talked late into the night and Peter didn’t want to return to the Tower so Wade escorted him back to his aunt’s place in Queens. It’d been so late and, Wade looked exhausted, so Peter suggested Wade stay. They both collapsed onto his bed and Peter fell asleep in seconds.
“I’ll do it in a couple hours. I just want to lay down for a bit before I have to deal with them again,” Peter sighed.
Peter felt his emotions swell again as he looked at both of the men. Venom had tried to kill both of them and Peter had been forced to watch both men bleed for him.
Steve stretched and then leaned into Tony as he murmured, “Sorry to have fallen asleep like that…I feel exhausted.”
“It’s nothing,” Tony murmured and moved in to kiss the side of his jaw. Steve stopped him by lifting Tony’s shirt.
It pissed him off. It disgusted him. This was Bucky. This was his friend, a man who supported him and Steve when the rest of the world was against them. He had been one of the most caring, funny, and loyal men he’d ever met…and Hydra turned him into a monster and then treated him like trash when they had no use for him.
“Could that be why I didn’t have a match? Cause…Cause I got bad genes and like boys?” Steve asked in a small voice.
Eventually, Tony butted in and said, “We’re going with the blue one!” When they all stared at him questionably, Tony retorted, “It’ll go with Steve’s eyes.”
Mjölnir sent out another shockwave when Thor raised it over his head for the first time since Odin had cast it to Earth.
Tony smirked at the horizon and then added King Kong onto one of the mountains and several planes began shooting at it.
He shook his head and murmured, “I am a machine for my master. I am not allowed to have a name, only a mission.”
SHIELD considered him for their initiative but deemed him unfit. In response, Tony hacked their network and decided to be as “reckless” as they categorized him with the information he gained. The eventual outcome was Tony going to India and befriending Dr. Bruce Banner and bringing him to New York.
The next morning came quickly, Steve had a meeting with Tony’s lawyers to go over what would happen if there was a possibility that this went to trial. Tony, of course, was going with him.
They followed Hill in with Coulson surrounded on all sides by his Avengers compatriots. Steve couldn’t stop looking at him and he was so happy he felt near to tears.
Steve cupped his face and swallowed the rest of his groan with his perfect mouth. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s head and returned the kiss just as passionately.
They did not ride for long and by the looks of the brownstone they stopped at Steve guessed they were still in Brooklyn.
Until I know if I will be writing one or two chapters, I cannot give you guys a proper chapter title!
“Do you want to reschedule the meeting with the board for a later date?” She gently asked, softly grasping his arm.
Tony paused, his heartbeat picking up a little more, as he turned to the Captain. Steve’s face was a mask but Tony felt trapped by his worried eyes.
“I-I heard…I see…” He motioned to his phone and then he murmured, “I’m still trying to process it…I think…”
Steve wasn't sure if he or Tony did it, but their clothes were willed away and in an instant their bodies were naked. They both moaned and Tony's hands were quick to run down Steve's back and cup his behind. Tony murmured something in an appreciative voice and Steve flushed again.
Peggy ran her fingers through Tony’s hair and whispered, “Tony, dear, there’s something I need to tell you…”
,” Tony gasped his name like it was a plea. “They’re d-dead.” He gulped for air and couldn’t speak no more but he didn’t have to. Steve picked Tony up and held him close. Tony buried his face into Steve’s chest and tightly held Steve back. Steve lightly patted Tony’s hair and whispered, “I’m here. I’m here for you. I’m here, Tony.”
Steve’s face split into a wide smile after noting the look. It’d been so long since they had last shared it…
Natasha had her freedoms stripped from her but she still retained her own mind at least and she couldn’t imagine accepting the Academy or anyone having such control over her. It was frightening…
Steve chuckled and reached out to run the back of his fingers over Tony’s prickly jaw. Tony leaned his head into Steve's touch with a relaxed sigh. They stared happily at each other and all the bad feelings Steve had disappeared.
Steve grinned as Tony slid his hand off his cheek. Steve caught that hand and whispered, “Thank you.”
The baseball game was still playing and he glanced at the radio, an older one from his era. In fact, everything around him looked like it was from his era…
MJ chuckled as she drew back but she kept her hands on him as she looked at him. she asked, “So who is Wade? And how did you make Pete fall for you in the middle of this mess with the press?”
James sat up sharply and the breath froze in his throat. Natasha looked at him with a pinched brow, not understanding.
“But Peter –,” he gasped. Steve should find him and offer himself to Venom to spare Peter from his continuous suffering.
“How many times must I remind you?” She whispered, “We’re soulmates. I love you. I always have and I always will.”
“…It was a picture…from that day,” Steve replied, drawing Tony’s hand up to his mouth and lightly kissing his knuckles. He still marveled at the fact that he was alive and couldn’t stop touching him.
“I am not leaving you alone in here,” Wade whispered harshly, coming up to Peter’s side to show him he was committed.
“Do you have somewhere in mind?” Steve asked and paused as Peter answered. He then said, “Alright, I will see you at two.”
Steve’s throws came to an immediate halt and he turned to Tony with a serious expression. Steve’s eyes raked over him and, by the sound of Tony’s voice and his current appearance, Steve instantly knew something was off.
The Venom patches shot off Steve and across the room in an attempt to escape it. It curled into a writhing mass against the far wall. All three of them exchanged incredulous expressions.
“Okay, I’ve set up base in the dining room. When you are done, we can all share breakfast together.”
“It’ll take time, but I’ll be able to do it,” Cable promised. He nodded to the frozen mass of bodies where the Goblin was in the middle of it all and he said, “I can only keep time frozen for half an hour more or it’ll start to warp. We have that time to find all of the remains of the reactor and then go back in time to fix this.”
Steve let go of Tony and felt his mind connecting the dots with amazing clarity. He whispered, “That’s how Hydra ends, with Schmidt. Something must have happened in the other timeline because of Bucky’s presence that prevented that…”
“We are but it would seem odd if my lawyers floundered, not knowing what to do when this gets out. They need to look prepared like they always knew we were together…plus they’re not going to keep their mouths shut about this, it’s too juicy. They’ll talk about it with their spouses or family who will in turn talk about it with others…”
“I don’t have Jarvis record anything in your personal rooms,” Tony retorted and Steve dropped his head in relief.
Tony grasped Steve’s cheek and stared into those concerned blue eyes. Steve was such a caring person…how long did they have to torture him to break that central characterization?
“This is going to be interesting,” Wade murmured. Peter glanced to him and Wade elaborated, “What ‘dirty details’ are we going to discuss exactly?”
For a moment, Tony thought the AI was going to disobey him. Its gaze slowly spanned over all of them and it said nothing more in rebuttal. However, it finally turned its head to the side and the projection returned.
Steve never got a break with his position. He made his rounds, talking to the leaders of the various squads or individual soldiers. He was checking in on their progress but, was mainly checking on moral. The men seemed to mostly be in good spirits, they had taken down another Hydra base after all, but he made sure to sit down with the few that were in bad ways. Casualties happened. It was the way of war, but that didn’t mean the soldiers had to easily accept it.
Susan Tyler stepped aside to not impede his fall and smiled at his prone body at her feet. She was holding a large, bloody shard of glass in her hand and her front was covered in more blood.
She wiped away those tears and beamed at the both of them with a happy smile. She gasped, “Tony…you found your soulmate.”
The projection of his father reached out to the suit and grasped its neck, emulating what Howard had done at that moment in the alternative future. Howard whispered, “I would
Steve eventually collapsed on top of Tony with his head nestled on his stomach and he fell asleep there with Tony gently carding his fingers through his hair.
Longing thrummed through his body at the thought. If they still remained friends, maybe he could do casual? They’d still have a close relationship as friends. Maybe that would be enough?
The doctors worked on him for about 30 minutes. Steve was silent throughout it. The last bullet to be removed was buried in his femur and its extraction was so painful he thought he might blackout. It was a blessed distraction from his warring thoughts.
Wade pressed kiss after kiss on the side of his head and Peter leaned back into his boyfriend and, in a serious voice stated to the merc, “
They shook hands and exchanged slime from their respective trash. Both of them grimaced and flicked off the slime.
“J, show me the scans!” He demanded. Jarvis opened the two he just took, the full bodied one and one with its head cut off, and one of the last scan he took over a year ago, before he went to the past.
Natasha’s gaze revealed nothing but Clint’s eyes flickered with sorrow as he looked at Steve and Bucky. He demanded, “Is this a hostage situation?”
“Like I said, only once a year!” Tony replied, exasperated. He groaned and leaned back against the glass. His head was pounding and it was only getting worse from the stress. He wished he had taken some aspirin before talking to Steve.
In the meantime, however, Tony needed to get his soulmate out of there before the reporters descended.
“Why?” Peter asked, he looked up to Steve curiously. Steve grinned upon his question. Peter was in his questioning stage and every other thing he said was usually a question. Steve loved explaining things to him and watching the wonder grow in his boy’s eyes as he learned something new.
Was this what Dad was working on in the lab? A replacement for Pops? The very thought made his entire being shudder.
Peter didn’t know Wade had started to cry until he cracked open his eyes and saw Wade’s eyes were edged with tears. He wrapped his arms around the back of Wade’s neck and whispered, “Wade…” Wade blinked open those big, beautiful, blue eyes that Peter loved so much. A tear escaped Wade’s right eye but he made no move to stop it falling down his cheek. It hurt Peter to see his boyfriend so distressed but he was like this because he almost lost Peter. Peter couldn’t imagine what’d he do if Wade’s mutation suddenly stopped working when he had a mortal wound. It’d…It’d probably destroy Peter. He shouldered so many deaths his parents, Uncle Ben, Gwen…but Wade…
Clint turned up the music and groaned, “I think they are intentionally trying to smother me with all of this fluff.”
One dressed, he picked up the water bottle and threw back his head to finish it in several more quick gulps.
He had been sitting on the bed ever since Sam texted him. Standing up felt like a gargantuan effort but he was able to do it with one mighty heave. He was still wearing the nice clothes he had changed into after his shower so, when he stated moving, he did not pause to slip into something else.
He kissed her gently, kneading her breasts and thumbing her nipples, and then whispered into her mouth, “I want to make love to you, Natalia.”
The green beast stomped away and Venom did not give chase. He needed to stop chasing volatile food. He needed to hunt weaker prey.
Steve tightly clenched his jaw as he pulled back his hand and, in a measured voice, stated, “I did this for you. I couldn’t do anything for my Ma when she slowly died from cancer, but I could do
Father Michael commanded, “Take that to the super market down the block! I’ll meet you back here and explain everything!”
Steve stood stiffly and James helped him put on the lab coat to spare him some dignity. While he helped him, Steve whispered, “I have a soulmate, Buck. He’s a fella. Like I always wanted.”
“V-Venom and Peter,” Bruce gasped in explanation. “Th-the symbiote sample I analyzed…It’s not perfect, it’s flawed. They can probably never properly bond unless Peter completely accepts him.”
Steve clenched his jaw, refusing to reply, but, internally, his heart cried out in agreement. Ever since he and Tony realized they were soulmates, they were never far from each other’s sides. He didn’t realize how strong of a connection they had formed until they were forced apart like this. Steve missed him and craved for information about him but dared not ask the Red Skull.
“Ugh, no, gross,” Tony groaned. He did not need that visual of Aunt Peggy with his dad right now. Tony paused, collecting his thoughts and then asked, “Wasn't – Isn’t there something going on between you and Peggy?”
Steve ran as soon as he was able with his possible location. The rest of the Avengers followed closely in formation. Natasha was the closest to him with only a few feet separation them. The rest were fanned out or, in Thor’s case, flew above him. When they were close enough to hear the Goblin laughing, Steve slowed them down and they cautiously approached.
“Pete, you’ve got to be shitting me!” His father gasped, “There’s no way in hell am I leaving you with this thing!”
The way he’d been acting made so much sense now. Her mate would not act without orders. His interactions with her were limited to what his master had ordered, to train her. The only deviation was when they first met and he asked her to go against her orders…what if he did that only to keep
“He’s angry with you right now but he clearly loves you too,” Peggy said and Steve’s heart clenched at her misguided notion.
The detectives glared at the lawyers but Steve shot a grateful glance toward the woman. Steve usually would have berated Tony for talking to an officer like that but he was currently having trouble finding his voice at the moment. His shock returned and he currently was baffled by the fact he was being treated like a criminal by people he had worked with and helped. Did they really believe he did it?
Later that night, the entire team was gathered in the communal room, watching an 80-inch hologram of satellite footage from Vision’s journey. He would be in safe throwing distance to the sun soon. The Avengers watched the tiny smudge that was Vision with good spirits.
They pushed through the doors and into the lab where the chair was and then jolted to a stop as Natasha's worst fears were confirmed.
“It’s been a big day,” Steve agreed. It was crazy to think he woke up that morning, alone on a bus, wondering if Tony was still afflicted by palladium poisoning...It already felt like years ago.
His heart raced faster than it had when Hydra almost got him again and he almost collapsed from the resulting vertigo. He had held it back from the father in his retelling of the story, but the white lie festered within him and it felt wrong denying the man this last bit of critical information, especially with all he was sacrificing in order to get Steve to Tony.
His dad’s cheeks were flushed with emotion and he opened his mouth to retort but Steve grasped his arm and stepped between him and Peter.
Pepper was sitting down. She had to sit down. She stared at the same information Tony was with large eyes and a white knuckled grip on her phone. She saw him looking at her and gasped, “Do…Do you think Phil is…?”
Steve adjusted Peter in his arms and he said, “He is my son. SHIELD just found him, Hydra has had him this entire time.”
He touched the railing to Steve’s bed and peered down at him a moment longer. Steve continued to slumber and Tony’s heart squeezed painfully. He whispered to him, “I will be right back.”
“If we go into the relationship with a certain mindset, I think it can be,” Tony confidently retorted. Tony had personally been in relationships with a few celebrities just for the press and they went into it with a contract laying out how long the relationship would last. Steve was obviously different than the more callous people he’d been in a relationship with and Tony couldn’t wait to see how their relationship would progress.
Tony pulled the covers over both of them and said, “Ugh, waking up, gross. J, what do I have on my calendar.”
was not the one who started it. We were having a pleasant conversation until you tried to make a wedge by bringing up his past dalliances.”
He had multiple gunshot wounds but he had to ignore them in favor of getting to Schmidt. He had to stop him. He was almost done.
Despite being isolated in the dreamworld, Steve felt like he was a part of Tony’s life because of their nightly talks.
Wade raised his arm and then hesitated for all of three seconds before taking off his mask. He rubbed at his scalp as if to fix his imaginary hair and his blue eyes regarded Peter self-consciously.
His masters changed all the time. He could fight his masters whenever he regained enough memories, but the words –
The implication behind Tony’s words washed over him like ice cold water. With it, all of his emotions flowed away and he was left with a hollow feeling.
“Hey,” Steve murmured. “Stop overthinking. You know that I like to kiss that little furrow between your brows when you start overthinking and you know where that usually leads…”
Steve nodded and turned back to Tony. He gazed down at his husband and watched every precious breath he took.
Venom attacked Hulk again, drawing the green man into another fight. Iron Man, however, blast off the ground at a death defying speed and flew straight to him.
“My dear Captain,” Tony purred when they finally broke away to breathe. “I thought you had to cook?”
Jarvis ran a quick diagnostic to double check the suit’s systems and then gave him the green light. Steve stepped up to them in the meantime and his gaze spanned the gathered group.
Peter took the shield and then held Tony’s hand to transfer the nanorobots over to him, leaving Tony in nothing but his boxers and Peter with a new backpack.
“I want a tag to describe us, something more than Taco Tuesday, there are six more days to the week you know?”
“A server said Tony was flirting with her and she bet she could get his number and she…” Steve paused, hurt just thinking about it, and then said, “I saw him smiling at her the same way he does when he flirts with me and…”
Tony had been lounging in the main room with his feet propped up on the coffee table and his laptop on his lap. He was still in his swim trunks but had slipped on some jeans and an AC/DC shirt. The suit had soaked into his jeans and made him mildly uncomfortable but he was able to easily ignore it.
Steve was euphoric. He no longer had to live a lie. He and Tony could be intimate outside the Tower now without fear. He could not stop smiling. His cheeks were starting to hurt but he doubted he could break his smile even if he tried. Tony wore a similar expression but his hazel eyes spoke more than his smile. Whenever he met Steve’s gaze, Steve could almost melt under the warmth of his love.
The sound of Steve's voice alone scared him. He was furious on Tony's behalf. His anger at Peter, and the context behind his words, made Tony's heart drop and that little hope he had flicker and die. He fell back onto the bed and stared at the ceiling, willing his eyes to keep from spilling over.
Tony clenched his fists and silently swore to Steve that they’d be there soon. They’d save him before it was too late.
“I can’t,” he gasped, struggling to regain some ground. “I-I am with Tony. I care for him Buck, I can’t.”
Captain America’s identity was still unknown to the world at large. Only the conspiracy theorists had touched upon the truth that Steve had never died but most of those people believed the new Captain America was a zombie being controlled by SHIELD, not the actually living man. To the rest of the world, Captain Steven G. Rogers was dead and the man running around as Captain America was a new hero with a secret identity.
“It’s a trilogy, babe, don’t worry we are definitely going to have to have a movie marathon with that one!”
He felt out of his element and lost in the haze of desire. He let Tony lead them and followed his touches and kisses until Steve finally used their connected hands to press Tony into the bed.
“Tell us, Natasha,” Tony said pointedly to the newly dubbed super soldier. “What is wrong? Why is a codename such a big deal to a spy? I bet you’ve had thousands of names while undercover.”
Steve pushed himself just enough out of Bucky’s grasp to look up at him, but not enough to leave the safety of his arms.
“It was practice and we learned from it,” Tony replied, when referring to Steve’s freak out at the end. He slipped his hand off Steve’s face. Thinking about Steve’s reaction, Tony chewed on his lip and then dropped his own eyes. He murmured, “Listen…when we are kissing…if it gets too weird, just imagine someone else.”
Tony leaned back in his chair and collected himself. He needed to appear cool and calm and not like the scared child he felt like he was moments prior. He was Tony Stark after all, and Tony Stark was not afraid of little things like the dark or death.
“That sounds great,” Peter laughed. He hadn’t even seen Gwen this much when they first started dating but he was excited to see Wade again.
He didn’t know how long he sat there just staring at the reactor, waiting for the pain to eventually make an appearance. But it must’ve been some time as Jarvis eventually announced, “Sir, Master Rogers is back and is headed in your direction.”
Shaking, he wrapped his arms around himself and ice splintered off his body with every tiny shudder. His mind was coming back to him slowly and he looked around the cockpit and barely recognized it thanks to the ice and snow.
Steve smiled diminutively at him when he turned from the stove and crossed the kitchen to place a plate down in front of him. He then rounded the counter, sat beside Tony, and began to eat from his own plate.
Tony wanted to hold him to try to comfort him but knew it was no longer allowed. Their affair was over now and they had to put a wall between them to prevent anymore change to the future.
Tony nodded too knowing exactly to what Steve was referring to…hell, at one point he had thought Steve was dead and the world just became…bleak.
They kissed again, this time it tasted salty from their tears and they broke apart with Tony chuckling, “We’re a mess.” Tony looked to Pepper and said, “Pep, I’d like to introduce you to my mess.”
Howard felt like someone just switched the OFF switch in his brain. Tony didn’t seem as affected and his eyes were flickering and beginning to close.
A dark shadow jumped in front of Solo and he heard his bullets bounce off it with multiple loud twangs. The rubber bullets ricocheted into the neighboring building and the glass exploded, making everyone underneath it scream and scatter.
“We open up to total darkness and the sound of chirping bugs but then the orange sun breaks over the horizon and ‘The Circle of Life’ begins –,” Wade began.
He tried to keep his mind blank. Venom knew everything he thought. So he kept talking to keep his mind busy, and continued, “Bruce and Scott expressed an interest in my shield and I bet their interest is piqued now! It is certainly acting beyond the parameters I had set for it. I bet, with their help, we can
“Godfather is more of a religious role anyways,” Tony later told him. “I’m not religious but both you and Ben are. It fits.
dinner so we can get to know our son’s boyfriend.” Tony looked up to his husband and Steve deadpanned, “And that’s final, Tony. I know you aren’t happy about Peter’s choice but you need to accept it or you might hurt Peter in the process and I know that’s the last thing you want.”
“We’ll go to Wade’s, the same address we went to last time!” Peter said to Happy and pressed the button to put up the personal screen between them.
“Peter’s a smart boy,” May stated, tightening their clasped hands despite the tremor in hers. “If he’s outwitted this thing before then he can do it again. We just need to have faith in him.”
Bucky slowly lowered himself to the floor as if standing and this revelation was too much for Bucky to handle at the same time. Sitting on the ground, he looked at Tony like he was the oddest thing he had ever seen. He gasped, “You knew?? How – Why…Why did you take me in? Build my arm? How can you even look at me? Or – Or call me friend?”
He came to a halt where the footprints showed signs of bending down and he felt his stomach drop as he took in the large, circular formation left imprinted in the ice next to the footprints.
Bruce’s statement only made it worse. The last time he saw Tony alive, his back had been turned to him because Steve had betrayed him.
Steve jerked like Tony had slapped him, but he pulled back all the same. Steve’s expression faded into something unreadable, but his eyes glistened with pain. Most probably wouldn’t have noticed but Tony had spent many hours just staring at Steve’s beautiful eyes, even when their gazes were not locked. He could easily read Steve’s gaze by now. Tony continued to watch it as Steve stepped back and saw his heartbreak.
Tony took Steve’s hand from his reactor and brought the appendage up to his mouth. Steve watched breathlessly as Tony kissed the same fingers that had touched his reactor. His lips were moist and left traces of himself on his skin. Then, without any warning, Tony drew Steve’s fingers into his mouth. His hot tongue caressed his fingers and he sucked on them, hollowing his cheeks as he did.
Steve felt his jaw drop in surprise but he made no attempt to pick it up. He looked across the room to where Bucky had been lounging on the couch next to Clint and saw him sit up straighter with his eyes locked onto the Black Widow.
“I understand,” Steve whispered to Bruce. “But you have to understand I just learned of Peter’s existence and I am trying to make a new life with him…”
EDIT: With the comments I'm getting, I just want to assure you guys that I tag my fics appropriately! However, if you've read my other fics you'll find I am a big fan of "
Tony crooked an eyebrow at him and said, “What? Sorry! We’re trying to save your ass! Next time I will ask permission before I set you up and clear your name in one sitting!”
Steve smiled and said, “It’ll be your first time all over again. You get to awkwardly relearn everything! It’s scary. I know. One of the scariest moments in my life was my first date with your father. I was scared of his experience, of openly being gay for the first time in my life, and I was scared of allowing someone into my heart after guarding it for so many years…Love is scary but it’s also rewarding.”
“And what about the next time? Or the time after that?”  He argued sadly. He was making no attempt to break away from her so she wrapped her arms around him and cushioned her head just above his heart. His heart was beating faster than usual but she couldn’t tell if it was because of their contact or conversation.
The brat’s parents weren’t supposed to be there! Hell! The kid was supposed to be here alone! It was going to be an easy kill and
But his conflicted heart made him bite down on his lips and the knife in his heart twisted more, making it near impossible to breathe, nonetheless reply.
“Of course,” Steve whispered. He drew Tony’s lips back to his and whispered into his mouth, “I love you to the ends of the Earth, Tony. Even if we are fighting about something stupid I will still love you.”
Tony meet and held his gaze, his eyes searching Bucky’s for some unknown factor. Bucky murmured, “What is it?”
Bucky struck him again, breaking his nose. He was hit a few more times and he heard Maria screaming his name.
Tony had to get it into his head that Steve was not interested. Tony needed to find himself a Victoria Secret model and take out all his sexual frustrations out in a couple of casual hookups…then again, maybe he needed a Calvin Klein model. Tony’s flush deepened as he instantly imagined Steve wearing nothing but Calvin Klein’s signature, tight and white briefs.
Steve leaned over and pressed one of the said cheeks with many little kisses. Tony turned his head to claim Steve’s lips with his own and Steve accepted his lips with a happy hum.
“Mr. Stark, I require another charge,” Jarvis’s voice came out of nowhere making all three of them jump.
“You’re half frozen, you lug,” Tony grunted. He rubbed his back and arms. The heat coming off Tony’s body hacked away at the icy growth in his muscles. Steve groaned and leaned into him, greedily taking what he had to offer.
“Do not get in her way or she will bite you. She will bark orders at us in a minute. Give her time,” Tony stated. He was used to the drill. Hurricane Pepper was a Category Five and she only just hit the coast at this point.
He was still wary about Tony’s endgame but Tony wanting to talk about “stuff” was encouraging. At that moment, all he cared about was that Tony had done this for them and not the cameras.
“Sit,” Steve commanded and Tony did automatically, as if he were following orders in battle. He moaned as his ass unexpectedly came into contact with Steve’s growing erection. He bit down on his lip and rubbed into it. God, he felt so good. How was he so hard already? …Who was he imagining?
He coughed for another minute, clearing out the congestion in his throat and Steve slowly sat back down.
Bucky snatched the reactor out of Howard’s hands. He did the only thing he knew worked with janky equipment...he hit it.
Steve dislodged Bucky’s grip and continued, “It’s not in the suit however. It’s embedded in something called an arc reactor. It's in the chest of the suit’s occupant, your future son, Tony.”
“Steve?” Bucky asked, noticing his odd behavior. Clint and Sam both stopped talking and eyed him with concern.
“Firstly, release a statement confirming you two are in a relationship and demeaning the photographer for intruding on a private, emotional moment,” Pepper stated. “Which I am writing right now and will be sending out within the hour.”
And then there's also that meddlesome SHIELD... hmmm hmmm, what will happen with them in response to this?
Tony was young. He may be smart for his age, but he still didn't seem to grasp the greater picture of the fact that Steve was Captain America…that he was…dead…
The AI did as he asked, and a video file opened on the screen, replaying the scene. He paused after Steven said his name and rewound it and played it again.
On Steve’s birthday, Tony had outdone himself and broke the world record in the private purchase of fireworks. The fireworks display lasted late into the night and they used the fireworks so much that the sky never really grew dark. Tony had to pay a lot of fines for breaking countless city ordinances but he claimed it to be worth it.
Dr. Kaswani was unofficially named Steve’s caregiver and he escorted Steve over to the Sno-Cat. He pointed out different aspects of the machine and explained all their functions to Steve. Steve listened attentively, fascinated by what he was learning.
Steve’s throat tightened and he grasped it, remembering his own drowning: the cold freezing his limbs, the salty water burning his throat and choking him with its soft caress. It was a torturous experience and horribly slow.
“He’s doing his lone wolf routine again,” Natasha supplied, there was an edge to her voice cuing him into her annoyance with Tony’s act too.
For a second, Steve reflected on the moment he learned about his son’s healing factor, only hours prior.
Spending the night with Tony. All night. Alone. His cock throbbed at the thought. He had dreamed about it and now that it might actually happen he could not help but feel nervous. Steve was a virgin and he knew Tony was not.
“I want to get to know you better,” Peter agreed. He reached over and grasped Wade’s arm. He was glad for the mask as it hid his flush and he whispered, “My knowing you better will definitely make this more serious…But, if this is too fast or soon, you don’t have to…”
Grinning, Peter wrapped an arm around Wade’s waist tightly and pulled his mask back down. Wade also pulled his mask back down and Peter said, “Hang on!”
Marston’s jaw dropped a second time and the audience went insane. Steve did not think they could get any louder until Tony leaned in and kissed him. The kiss was chaste and lasted maybe a dozen seconds but Steve’s heartrate had never before escalated so quickly. His ears began to ring from the shrill, excited screams.
Steve bit the inside of his cheek upon Tony’s question. It was a question he had been asking himself ever since Peter came into his life. He wanted his son to have a normal life but the cold-hard truth was, his son was not normal. He could easily kill a grown adult with his strength. Children were more fragile and if Peter became upset with them Steve was afraid what he would be capable of.
He could not break his smile even as Steve kissed him. Their kiss was mostly teeth and Steve made an annoyed noise when Tony didn’t pucker his lips. Tony chuckled, “Sorry, just too overjoyed to stop smiling.”
“I’m not older than you,” Steve stated, already in Disney prince mode already pulling some cheese out for the grilled cheese sandwiches he planned to make.
Peter was trembling beneath him with silent tears streaming down his face. Steve wiped them away with his thumbs and smiled sadly at Peter. With a thick voice, Steve continued, “Promise me you will continued to be strong. Promise me you will still ignore your sense and help others because it is the right thing to do. Promise me when you’re older you are going to use your powers for good. I know asking you to live a normal life is too much so join the Avengers and take everything we taught you to do good…And Tony…your Dad.” Steve’s breath hitched and felt tears prickle his own eyes. Steve whispered, “Please keep calling him ‘Dad.’ He’s as much as a father to you as I am…Let him be the one you look to whenever you need help, or your inspiration for your graduation speech, and mind him at your wedding he’s going to make a fool of himself.”
“Only in the cold,” he murmured, pressing his face into her hair. The metal would become bone numbingly cold in extreme weather and painfully freeze the area where it was attached.
Thor seemed to be handling the rest of the Hydra agents and was laughing at their attempts to overpower him. Tony did not even spare him a glance but haughtily stated to the Red Skull, “You might be physically stronger than me but you’ve lost. Face it Skeletor, you’re done.”
Tony chuckled to himself and turned back to watch the hologram with Sam and Rhodes as the couple behind them began to bicker and flirt.
Steve had taken his heart and trust and wrenched it from his chest in a vicious pull when he kissed Bucky back.
They exited together, Steve exiting the bathroom to go to his son and Tony going to the closet. Tony slapped his ass as they parted and shot Steve an impish grin.
,” Steve gasped. He grasped his son’s arms and hissed, “When they thought I died, they released my identity to the world and there are so many times I wish that they did not! And it’s not just because the paparazzi get annoying sometimes,
Bucky nodded and confirmed, “Was…Like I said, I remember falling out of love and remember attaining an attraction for…others. I…I’m sorry about the kiss by the way…”
Kilian smirked and said, “Power of course. Air Force One has crashed, my soldier brought her downright after he captured you. The President was aboard and went down with the ship. Now, my man in the White House is in power…By bombing that base in Kuwait and the Chinese Theatre I have frightened the American people but their anger is only a dim, flickering fire. Killing you, America’s favorite son, will turn that dim fire I started into a raging inferno. The American people will be clamoring for revenge against the Mandarin and I will supply the army of super soldiers to fight him…It’s brilliant really. In the end, I will be in control of both sides.”
Tony knew little of Spider-Man. He was a vigilante who handled mostly small crime. Whenever the Avengers were saving the world other than in New York, (yes, Tony could admit the world did not revolve around New York) Spider-Man went head-to-head with the big villains. His first one had been a Lizard man, Tony only remembered that because Dr. Connors had been a colleague and he had been horrified by what happened to him. More recently he had fought with Electro, who had put Jarvis offline for over an hour and scared Tony to death. He had feared the AI received permanent damage but, luckily, the fail-safes worked and Jarvis had been fine.
Tony closed his eyes as he snuggled up to Steve with a content sigh and was half ready to take a nap in his arms, but then he heard the light crack of the lubricant being opened and then felt Steve's slick fingers reaching behind Tony.  His fiancé lightly bit his earlobe and whispered, "Your turn."
He dragged his feet over to his bed and pulled out his phone from his pocket. He kicked off his pants and drew off his shirt. He turned off the light and was settling under his covers as he called Wade.
Peter’s eyes became calculating and he lost all traces of the dark humor that was beginning to unnerve Mary. Peter cautiously stated, “Dad just left. He and the other Avengers are going to Pops. Jarvis said he’s hunting at a hospital right now. I want to go too. I need to at least
“Work,” she replied and it was the answer Peter expected. It seemed all she did was work. Even with Peter’s scholarship, there was an enormous amount of money need for his schooling. Textbooks and supplies for a science degree cost a fortune! They were asking over fifty dollars for a single beaker alone! A little container of glass! It probably only cost a dollar to make!
Wade pressed his forehead to Peter’s and glared at his boyfriend as he grumbled, “That was the only time you’d bottomed…”
Pepper placed his personal laptop on his lap and he almost cried. He inhaled deeply through his nose and whispered, “Thank you…I…I will work on this…I can do this.” He pressed the button to have the bed push him up into a sitting position and opened the laptop. Two holoscreens opened on either side of the main screen. Sam’s old laptop from a prior century was a thing of the past and Tony dove into his work.
He brushed it off too, trusting Tony's knowledge in the subject, and settled into their cuddle with a happy sigh. He observed, “This is the first time I have ever had a ‘post-ejaculate cuddle’.”
Bucky clenched his hands, his nails digging into his flesh, and, as the others teased Tony, he watched Steve. Steve did not join the others in circling Tony and stood off to the side alone and looking at Tony as if he were unreachable.
“Tony,” Steve murmured, leaning closer to him. Tony paused and looked to him in question. With a warm smile, Steve whispered, “This is your hourly reminder…”
Thinking of Peter, Steve felt a twinge of guilt and almost ran back into the building. He stopped himself because he knew as soon as he held his son again he would start crying and he could not do that to Peter. He needed to go to Bucky. He needed him to help him with his grief again.
Tony slowly moved against Steve, waiting for Steve to mirror his movements. Steve did but stared at Tony with large blue eyes, almost as if he was bewitched. Those eyes drooped with pleasure as Tony pressed into him and Steve grew more comfortable with his own movements.
“What is he talking about?? What was this other Tony looking for? What else was he going to say?” Tony demanded of his AI.
“Peter,” Steve called over to him, his voice tense. Peter and Wade looked up to him and Steve asked, “What can we do?”
“Everything is going to be alright,” Uncle Tony whispered. His eyes were closed so Peter could have assumed the statement was meant for both of them but he had a strange feeling that it was directed more to his father. It left a bad taste in his mouth and he could not help but fearfully wonder what had happened with his mother.
“I am late,” Peter stated. “I need to get back before my dad sends the Avengers out looking for me. Your kisses and reactions are just
“Do you think she got it??” Bucky repeated, most definitely referring to the letter he had written Natasha. He stood in their doorway, clutching the frame.
“You are supposed to be melting right now,” Kilian commented. He inhaled deeply and suddenly spewed molten fire out of his mouth, totally taking Steve by surprise. He rose his shield just in time to take the brunt of the damage but he went flying across the room and was imbedded into the metal wall.
Steve pushed himself up to his knees, putting himself a little higher than Tony. But he did not pull away or relinquish his hold on Tony.
Steve cupped his mouth to stifle the cry that threatened to escape but Jarvis still managed to hear him.
“We’re going to work on his flips. He’s a natural but he keeps landing in a crouched position and catching himself with his fingertips and making them stick to the mats. I keep telling him to not use his powers but he forgets in the heat of the moment,” Natasha said with a shrug. Peter had run the entirety of the gym in less than 30 seconds without a sweat or becoming winded and was slowing to a stop. Natasha yelled out to him, “Don’t stop until I tell you to!” Peter instantly leapt back into his jogging.
He gently pushed Tony back down and Tony lay back into his bed. He turned his head to the side and stared at the wall to his left.
“Actually, no,” Steve replied. “We need to secure the area. It's why it took them so long to get here. Apparently, the forest outside the perimeter is crawling with Hydra agents.”
Grinning, Steve pressed his forehead to Tony’s and whispered, “I am head-over-heels wooed.” He kissed Tony and let his mouth show Tony how enamored he was with him as his tongue found its way into the other's mouth. The hands on Steve’s neck suddenly dug into his flesh and Tony moaned encouragingly.
“We’ve been over this countless times, I’m not that kind of doctor, I’m not a therapist,” Bruce stated. “Last time we talked like this I almost lost my temper.”
“Please don’t,” Steve gasped, his fingers dug into Bucky’s flesh for an instant then he lessened his hold slightly.
He wasn’t going to have to worry about the press or being Tony Stark’s son. Tonight, he was just going to be Peter and he was going to spend time with Wade.
But then Steve smiled and it was filled with such emotion that Tony felt his knees tremble because...wow, what a smile. Steve whispered, “I always dreamed of...maybe finding someone one day. Even that dream seemed farfetched and if I had found someone we could never be public…But, to know that it’s so accepted in the future, it makes my heart soar…” Steve dropped his gaze and smiled sadly as he whispered, “Even if I won’t get it.”
Tony nodded and said, “Alright, let me get dressed. I don’t want to let them think you and Peter are running around with crazy people!”
As he went to his room, he went over the conversation he had with Pepper in his mind again and flushed at the memory. Why would she think he and Tony were an item? And why was she so accepting of it? She wanted him to sign a contract to be quiet so it was clearly still a bad thing.
Steve looked away from the malicious smiling face of their son and to Tony. Steve did not know what his face portrayed but it was powerful enough to draw a painful hiss from his husband.
“Triple shot coming up!” Gary replied with a smile. He gushed, “You know I’m famous now? They got a picture of me serving you two your coffee yesterday and it’s all over the internet!”
“Usually they only notice me at my worst,” Tony said with a sigh. He picked up one hologram with a smirk and then threw it at Steve, saying, “I like this one.”
Wade smiled bashfully at Peter and Peter curled his fingers into Wade’s as if to assure him all was fine.
Heimdall sighed and loosened his grip on his sword. He stated, “The mortals think it is possible for you to awaken the Captain. You and Mjölnir have done so before.”
The confession twisted his heart painfully in a viselike grip. Steve was torn between pushing Tony away and pulling him in.
Peter jumped away from him, going over the couch and landing on the side of the opposite wall. He stuck to the wall like glue. There was no questioning he was Spider-Man now.
He’d changed out of his stiff uniform the night before so he didn’t have to throw anything on to protect his clothes from the bacon grease stains. He may have hung his dress uniform up nicely but his current clothing consisted of boxers and an undershirt. He’d changed enough times in front of the Avengers into his Captain America uniform though that his undressed state did not really bother him. He grinned to himself as he realized this was just another sign of him belonging with these people..his family.
“Just promise me that you won’t do anything rash,” Steve sighed and Tony laughed, reminding Steve of their good times. The burn in his gut lessened and he didn’t notice that Tony did not promise him anything.
He watched the recent events as they unfolded like an epic of old. He saw the rise and fall of Hydra. He saw the fall of the Man of Iron and he saw the fall of the Avenger’s Captain. And with his all-hearing ears, he had heard the Son of Coul murmur his suspicions with Bruce Banner.
“I saw it with my own eyes,” Steve replied with a shudder as he remembered his son’s terrified face being swallowed by the dark mass.
The glow from Tony’s reactor illuminated Steve’s form and Tony sunk into his soulmate’s side with a relieved sigh.
There were three white foam containers within and he opened all three displaying the chimichangas, rice, and beans.
Time passed slowly for Tony with nothing but marching, hunching over fires, eating unappetizing dry food, charging the suit, unpacking tents, and repacking them on constant repeat.
His blurry gaze focused on his father’s figure in his doorway. Tony was standing there in his pajamas looking flushed. Steve strolled up behind Tony and sheepishly murmured, “Sorry, Pete…”
Had Steve survived he would have loved to see the drawing…but he and his shield were now lost forever…He still had people looking for him, but he knew by now it was a lost cause…Poor Tony would have no grave to return to…just the memorial in D.C.
Steve released Peter from his embrace and let the boy reach out to the bush again. The toddler enthusiastically played with the leaves and was absolutely enthralled.
“I’m sorry too,” Peter whispered. He didn’t want to fight with Wade or his father. He wanted peace between all of them.
Before the Goblin is properly introduced I just wanted to make it clear that the Goblin in this fic is not the Goblin seen in any of the Spider-man movies. This one is based off the Goblin from the Ultimate Spider-man comics in both his appearance and convictions.
“I have no idea!” Pepper gasped. “All I know is that madman, Kilian, is working with the Mandarin and he pumped me full of this stuff that made me feel like I was burning alive!” Her eyes widened as she looked over his shoulder and she gasped, “Steve! Look o-!”
But, more importantly, he remembered holding a bloody implant out to the memory of his target, and pleading to the woman, “
Steve stated, “Peter wants to meet you. Ben’s told Peter stories about you and has given him some of your old heirlooms. We have pictures of you in our home. You have been ingrained in Peter’s life all these years – and we want Peter to become ingrained in yours…Peter is dying to meet you.”
Yet Mary’s lab was in Oscorp and the boy had originally been found in one of his “abandoned” labs. He knew it was only a matter of time before their suspicions were cast back to him.
“By the time we are done here, this place is going to be crawling with reporters,” Tony murmured to Steve.
“Yeah, I like it. Fabricate it. Make it,” Tony said and then fully turned to Enigma’s screen. Jarvis had
Wade gather Peter's hands together and then brought them up to his mouth to kiss them. He revealed in an earnest whisper, “I'd rather lose my life than lose you.”
“…You are as freaking adorable as your son,” Tony commented, making Steve flush. Tony stepped up to them and kissed Peter’s forehead then grabbed Steve’s collar and dragged him into a quick kiss on the lips. Steve’s chest swelled with a pleasant warm sensation.
“I know but another smart option would be to leave and go back to our normal routines,” Tony tried to rationalize.
They strongly debated where the ceremony would be held. They were tempted to be one of the first to marry at the courthouse but, in the end, decided against it. They would give those happy couples the press and not let their marriage overshadow their long awaited marriages. Steve and Tony had been together for a few years. Some of those couples had been together for decades. It was their day so Steve and Tony only attended as a show of support. It had been a moving day filled with happy tears and wide smiles.
want any more surprises or-or…” He paused to collect his breath and steady his voice. He continued more slowly, “I just want to know when things are real. Alright?”
Tony pressed his face into his boyfriend’s chest and reminded him, “I love you. No matter what happens, I am going to stick to your side, teasing and mortifying you all along the way…”
He shot down the thought as soon as it appeared. Tony Stark wasn't his father. He had no part in Peter's life and his sudden emergence in it wouldn't change that. His aunt was probably right...This was all probably a publicity stunt.
Steve quickly stepped over to the desk and grabbed the complementary pen and paper pad there. He quickly jotted down his cell phone number and tore the slip of paper from the pad. He pushed it into Bucky’s hand before he could reject it.
Bucky expected more of a fight from Howard. Howard’s face changed several different shades of red and he was clenching his jaw so tightly, it looked like he may pop a tooth. Instead, the man stormed out of the meeting and it was the last the Colonel heard of it from Howard.
Tony shook his head and whispered, “J…his systems got messed up. He doesn’t remember all of it…” The AI didn’t remember Tony and Steve falling in love, or the different realities of the future they experienced, nor how Tony got sick in the first place.
Others guessed Pepper and Tony laughed aloud imagining the two together. Pepper was grounded whereas Steve was always in motion. It would never work!
They pulled up to the bus station and then Father Michael proceeded to take money out of his pocket and hand it to Steve.
If Steve sounded betrayed before, now the level of Tony’s treachery was so great he sounded utterly destroyed. Tony wanted to embrace him and kiss him until he erased that look of hurt with passion. But he did not move, knowing Steve would not want that, not right now. He stared at Tony with a hurt expression and his question lingering in the air between them. Seeing Steve like this totally shattered Tony.
He slammed the door closed and bolted the lock. He turned back to Steve with a furious glare and hissed, “Are you
“You’re filthy,” Steve stated with mirth. He rubbed some grease off of Tony’s cheek and Tony took the opportunity to grab his soulmate by the hips and drag him into his embrace.
It distracted Tony enough from his fight and one of the metal tentacles was able to slip through his defenses and grab onto his throat with a crushing force.
Steve’s own body clearly could not deny the man and his heart was already head over heels for him so…why deny him? Why question it?
“Oh, Peter,” Tony moaned. How was he still alive? It could not be possible. He looked like he would shatter if Tony touched him.
Tony swiped his hand down, closing all the holograms and he asked his husband, “Is everything alright?”
“Alpha Jarvis reconnecting…” The statement nearly made Tony cry. He was back. He was in the future. He survived.
Bucky met them halfway and, with one look at Tony, he wordlessly went to Tony’s other side and supported him too.
They heard his hurried footsteps before they saw him. Both assassins sprung to their feet and turned to the noise. The warmth that was in their eyes seconds prior was replaced by cold, detached, and calculating gazes.
James dropped to his knees immediately. Natasha held her bleeding hand to her chest and lowered herself more slowly. She reached out to her mate with her good hand and he clasped her hand tightly.
He still could not get over it. It was like he was going into shock because his body could not handle the amount of joy he was feeling. This was really happening. They were going to get the impossible...they were going to get forever.
Steve was going to move to Brooklyn because it had been his home since the 1940s but now… as he thought on it, maybe it was time for change. Peter would be safer in the Tower and once it got out that Steve had a son he would be hunted by both reporters and enemies. Steve would have an easier time protecting him surrounded by Avengers than everyday neighbors. And the Avengers were the closest thing Steve had to friends other than Sam and Buc-.
“I’m sorry, Peter,” his aunt gasped, her voice contorted with a pain he never heard her express before.
Tony turned to Steve and hissed, “How the hell has he seen Star Wars already and, you who have been unfrozen for
When Steve woke up, he had an atrocious hangover and was laying in the middle of a pile of the slumbering bodies of his friends.
Peter swayed and Wade grabbed a hold of the back of his arm with his one good hand and fearfully hissed, “Peter?”
He was in complete darkness, laying on silky material, and enclosed within a tight space. It took him only a few seconds to realize it was a coffin.
For a moment, Steve was tempted to ask if the robot had “known” him too. He pushed the reckless idea aside. He didn't want to change the future but, also, he did not want to have the timer ticking down in his head for his own death.
There was no Hulk room to contain it here. They had to get it off Peter now or risk it slipping away again with his son.
The psychiatrist slipped past him and Coulson closed the door. As soon as the door sealed behind him, Coulson sighed heavily. Yes, he definitely saw the first meeting with the Captain turning out
“I love you, Peter,” Steve murmured, running his nose through his hair and inhaled the fresh lavender smell of Peter’s no-tears baby shampoo.
Wade watched Banner as he sighed heavily, his exhaustion and worry was prevalent in the dark circles under his eyes and the pale parlor of his skin. It was late. Peter had gone down hours ago. Most people would be in bed at this hour...This time yesterday Peter had been sleeping peacefully in his arms. The thought did not sit well with Wade as his insides twisted unpleasantly.
Everyone always ate together and seemed to only store snacks in their personal kitchens, which Steve was happy to replicate. Breakfast and dinner were team affairs and they all gathered in the large dining room on the community room floor to eat the takeout Tony or Clint ordered, or the food Bruce or Steve made. Steve had helped his mother cook so he made wholesome meals that Tony called “All-American.” Bruce made more exotic foods he had learned from his travels and every dish was something delightfully new to Steve always with a touch of spice.
Steve watched in amazement as he pulled the calendar up. His jaw dropped as he watched him do it and when he held it out to Steve, Steve confirmed that the doctor’s and the “phone’s” dates matched.
Peter nodded, remembering his nerves with Gwen. He murmured, “It just seems more frightening with Wade…” More frightening but also
I've used some of Natasha's background from the comic book universe which is not mentioned in the movie verse!
He trimmed Steve’s beard first by putting an intimidating, pointed plastic piece on the end. When Tony approached him with it, Steve asked, “You sure we can’t just use old fashioned scissors?”
He probably was not used to such emotions and she felt pity for him but also relief. Her mate was not wholly machine. There was a man in there somewhere, struggling to get out.
Steve’s breath broke free from the blockage in his throat and his moan ripped through his throat. It was so loud and heated he feared the entire Tower heard.
Steve was distracted for a moment as Tony hopped on one foot to get his leg in his new pants. Steve laughed at him and Tony playfully smacked him on his side so he hadn’t noticed that only five of the six were there.
“We’ll have to watch a video of the speech later,” Howard whispered, grasping Maria’s hand. She leaned into his side and they both looked to his son as he stubbornly glared at a spot in the crowd that wasn’t them.
Tony began to press more kisses down his chest, following the crevice of his pectoral muscles until he made to his abdominal muscles. Once there, Tony’s tongue came out without any warning and licked the skin above his navel. All the muscles in his abdomen clenched and his dick twitched.
“I am not trying to murder you, Master Parker,” Jarvis stated. “I am merely enforcing the new restrictions constructed by Sir.”
The bullet pierced her side, above her left hipbone. Natasha tried to stay standing but swayed under her weaken legs and fell to her knees. Her instructor cautiously approached her with his gun caulked and ready to shoot again.
we have to work together instead of against each other!” Steve tore off his helmet and vehemently countered, “If we don’t work together, then that chaos will overwhelm us. Together we are stronger.”
Peter ignored the other woman and rubbed the back of his head to try to comfort himself and brush away the sudden surge of bashfulness. He ducked his head to hide the flush growing on his cheeks and kicked absently at the ground. He murmured, “Yeah, it’s me…” He paused then remembered his manners and said, “It’s nice to meet you.”
“Nope! The robot says I retain a full head of hair in my later years!” Bucky proudly retorted, slicking back his hair with a grin.
Steve innocently licked the sauce off his fingertips and Tony stopped chewing. His brain decided it could handle only so much when Steve was…was doing
“Using her powers for something other than the greater good, shame on you, Pepper,” Tony murmured but Wanda merely laughed.
command it,” Tony smartly countered, shooting Pepper a grin over his shoulder. He looked back to Bucky and said, “In fact, let’s make this a thing. You will not hurt me or Pepper, that beautiful red head over there. You can kick the ass of anyone from Hydra, I’m sure they deserve it, so you have the freedom to do that.”
Or maybe it was the fact that he was clearly upset. She probably assumed it had something to do with the role she played in the deception about his parentage and it made Peter feel like an ass for the way he responded to her.
Without turning around, Steve twisted his shoulder and reached behind him, placing his hand on the wooden barrier between where Steve was sitting and where Tony was. He did not look back but he heard Tony stop struggling and, after a short pause, Tony’s warm hand was placed on top of his. Tony’s squeezed his hand tightly and Steve reluctantly pulled his hand away when the bailiff gave him the stink eye. Steve cradled his hand as Tyler made her statement.
“Be that as it may,” Natasha gritted. “Coulson is going to put you on babysitting duty. It is up to him whether or not you are watching the President or Barnes.”
The tinkering was a distraction. He had fully upgraded his suit three times but had yet to use it. No one was calling on the Avengers for help. It was like the world collectively agreed to give the team time to grieve.
Tony did not linger in the cold water long and grabbed the towel he had left at the water’s edge and patted himself down as he shivered. Jarvis opened the suits hands and turned the thrusters on their lowest settings to help warm him up. The air heated around him and his shivering lessened.
“Yes, with the helicarriers,” Sitwell gasped. He gulped and hissed under his breath, “Oh, God, Pierce is going to kill me.”
Steve recognized the voice. He had pinned to hear it for days. Was it real? Was Tony really there? He looked beadily around for Tony but did not see him. It was another trick of the mind he surmised until he saw the figures running beneath him. Kilian’s men were in a frenzy. Some were falling to an unseen foe.
Tony rounded the front of the car and hopped into the driver’s seat. Steve went to the backdoor, where Peter’s car seat was. He tore open the door and shoved Peter inside. Tony reached into the back and was buckling Peter in just as Steve closed the door. He felt immensely better having the barrier of the car door between Peter and the reporters.
“Soon,” Steve promised, wishing he could wipe away that expression from Peter’s face. “Your dad and I just need to confirm something with Uncle Bruce first, were going to meet her one more time for coffee, and then you can meet her. It’s going to happen soon, Peter.”
“Yes!” Tony replied then looked down to Peter with a stricken expression. He looked to Steve in question.
“I’m not Grumpy. If you’re Snow White, then I’m Prince Charming.” Tony grabbed some jelly out of the fridge and when he turned back around he spotted Steve’s expression and asked, “What’s got you smiling like that?”
Coulson’s brows shot up in surprise. He probably thought Peter did not remember him and would be as shy as when they last met. Coulson look awkwardly down to where Peter had attached himself to his leg and said, “Hello Peter. Happy birthday.”
With an unsteady voice, Clint gasped, “You would not believe how unbelievably happy I am to see you right now.”
Peter chuckled but obliged and leaned down to kiss Wade again. It was different kissing him upside down but it was a
Steve couldn’t stop smiling because of it. It…it just made him so happy to know someone he liked was also interested in him.
Norman straightened his suit and stated, “I consider Peter to be a second son. The boy is close to my own son and shows remarkable genius akin to my own. I would never hurt him which is why I never told him of his mother. If you really must know, Dr. Parker blames SHIELD for what happened to her and she blames you, Captain.”
Eddie didn’t even pretend to be doing something like Peter was. He stood at the station, staring straight at Peter. After a moment, he whispered, “Hey, Parker.”
Mary cringed at the hurt that broke through in Peter’s voice. He must have been fighting to repress it this entire time. She carefully replied, “I was programmed with emotions to better convince your family that I was your mother…They did not affect me strongly until I met you. At the time, the whole reason for my entire existence was only to deliver Venom to you. But afterwards, I felt guilt for what I did to you…I am sorry, Peter…If I could go back and change what had happened I would.”
Steve woke slowly. He blinked open his eyes slowly and the world was blurred around him. He inhaled deeply and as he exhaled his breath shuddered as it struggled up his throat and then he coughed madly in its great expulsion.
Tony had to smother his chuckle upon that retort. He was smiling idiotically at Rogers but he could not help it. Tony grew up idolizing this man and now here he was, in the flesh, interacting with Jarvis.
“Don’t tell me they’re your NOTP??” Wade gasped aghast. “We can’t associate if you do not support the now
, was clearly defending Stark because of their close friendship and...and it pissed Peter off that he did not have that with his
Steve leaned into him but his eyes had the blank gaze of someone more preoccupied with dark internal thoughts than what was going on in front of him.
Peter rolled his eyes and actually felt some humor brush through the terror and fragile patchwork of calm he had buildup to subdue Venom. He gasped, “Of course!”
A nurse rolled in a crib for Peter but neither he nor Tony made a move to put him in it. He stayed nestled at Steve’s side and would likely stay there the entire night.
Sam sighed and accepted the child saying, “I thought I saw Mandy upstairs with another orphan. I’ll see what she wants to do with this guy.”
Originally, she only had to wait. Would her instructor find her first? Or her soulmate? With the months that passed, however, it seemed her soulmate was the unlucky winner.
He took off his suit, being careful not to wrinkle it more than it already was, when he saw something sticking out of his breast pocket. He pulled out the napkin and smiled at the scratchy phone number and doodle of a cartoonish Deadpool.
Wade closed the door behind them and bolted it shut. He stepped behind Peter as he surveyed the place and wrapped his arms around Peter, crossing them over his chest. He pressed his chest to Peter's back and leaned into him. Peter leaned back with a light smile.
Tony wordlessly held out the phone to Bucky. Bucky smirked and held up the phone to his ear and said, “Heya, Dum Bum. How you doin’?”
“Yes, sir,” the junior agent murmured on the other end. The young man had to be standing only a few feet dozen from history. They had finally found it: the plane that had crashed into the arctic decades prior – the Captain’s plane.
“But she blasted that bitch out because she was a badass!” Sam said with a laugh. He pointed at the screen in front of them and stated, “Vision is about to blast our alien into the sun so I think we skipped that part of the movie!”
Enigma was wearing a ballcap and sunglasses, but Tony recognized him instantly. The Audi had tinted windows so he openly stared at the man as he slowly drove by. Now that he was no longer covered in fire extinguisher ash and flinching away from Tony, he saw the blond in his beard…and that he was stacked. Jarvis’s security cameras did not do this guy justice. He was definitely ex-military so why didn’t they find anything on him in the database? Maybe he was special forces? But what would special forces want with…
Jim and Dum Dum lowered Tony to the floor as Howard jogged back over. The AI didn't seem to remember what happened so Howard explained, “It’s palladium poisoning. The reactor is barely held together because the core has practically disintegrated and, unfortunately, that mean its waste went into Tony’s body.”
Tony’s eyes snapped open in shock and he heard Steve inhale sharply beside him. They both looked to each other with wide eyes.
The hospital was a bustle of worried patients and pale personal. Most did not know the cause of the shake just yet and all were speculating its cause, nearly all of which sounded Hydra related. Tony ignored them in favor of getting to Thor. Jarvis kept him updated on the Norse God’s status. Coulson and Bruce met him out in the fields and were walking back to the hospital when Tony finally reached them.
“When was the last time you slept with someone?” Steve played along and countered, “I don’t date anyone who is seeing other people.”
concentrate. He wanted a sixth but Jarvis had locked down the espresso machine, stating it was for health reasons.
His fingers jerked when his eyes landed on the suit. He blinked a few times, unsure if he was really seeing this. Slowly, but steadily, his heart began to drop as he took in the glaringly obvious changes to it.
“It’d be something Jarvis would do,” Tony sighed heavily. “The suit is probably in full stealth mode and, from this height, even I wouldn’t be able to see it. You don’t have to worry about it. Jarvis will only come if my life is at stake.”
Tony’s lab had been broken into and his door had been blown off its hinges. Bruce and Peter did not her any explosions but Peter thought he might have heard someone laughing.
Steve sighed as he thought of Tony. He redirected the conversation with Bruce back to his question, “…So Tony?”
Uncle Bucky smiled and let him slide out of his arms. He stated, “Go on then and be sure to tell Tony you are sorry.”
A man walked through the smoke in a green body suit, with a purple cape, and a…fish bowl on his head?
Aunt May always hated superheroes, including the Avengers. She claimed it was because she thought what they did should be left to the police,
Cable stopped moving and then slowly turned to Steve. He cautioned, “You cannot approach him. It is the year 2008. This is several months before he time traveled and meets you. He doesn’t know who you are.”
Tony’s skin was a lumpy, continuous bruise that ached in a constant throb with no relief. And breathing alone was near impossible as every time he inhaled it felt like someone was stabbing his side with a pitchfork. His muscles felt like someone pulverized them with a serrated hammer and his bones felt brittle and cracked.
The father reached into his pocket and held the tickets to Steve. Steve took the tickets from him and saw Los Angeles written as the final destination.
“Going with my idea to explain why you haven’t been dating then, eh?” Tony grinned as he referred to their prior conversation.
He woke with the memory lingering behind. The feeling of safety and acceptance in Steve’s arms remained and enveloped him in comforting feelings.
He blanched as soon as the words left his mouth. He all but confessed that he had thought what they shared was real.
When the questions were winding down, they unexpectedly asked him, “Who are you in a relationship with?”
He pretended not to notice but Tony very pointedly called him Howard, not Dad, even after Howard discovered their relation. There was a history there that Howard had yet to experience but Tony had already lived. A history where Howard and his son were estranged…
Eddie exhaled deeply, like he had been holding his breath, and leaned heavily onto the counter beside him. He gasped, “Thank God!”
Steve shook his head and murmured, “It doesn't affect me like it used to…plus, someone's got to keep a clear head to clean all of yous up before the Colonel sees this.”
He crumpled in on himself and a relieved sigh escaped his mouth. He unwrapped his arm from his head and hissed as his skin stuck to his arms and tore off his scalp. His right side of his head was not as badly burned as his left. He could not see out of his left eye. His left ear was ringing and no longer there and his face felt like it was still burning despite there no longer being flames. His nerves were all aflame, burning with indescribable pain, making it hurt to move, even breathe.
They had fallen into bed with the clothes they wore that day so a few layers separated him from Natasha’s flesh but he could feel the heat coming off her body and the softness of her breast. He trembled from the intimacy and felt humbled by the fact that she wanted this…wanted him.
Tony didn’t need to turn around to know Wade and his son were looking at each other with warm gazes that one would only see in couples happily in love. Once again, Tony replied truthfully, “Yes, they are.”
“If you do go to them, take me with you,” Tony said, his eyes still lingered on the swimming bear. He continued, “It will be emotional. You’ll need a friend.”
,” Steve could not get the words out. He betrayed Tony. He broke his heart. He never got to make it better. He never got to tell him in person how much he loved him.
“What was that, lovely?” Tony whispered, his eyes were so dark that Steve could no longer tell they were hazel. Tony cupped himself through his jeans and began to lazily stroke himself. Steve’s own dick throbbed as if Tony’s phantom fingers brushed against him. He bit down on his bottom lip and focused on Tony’s eyes, hoping to escape the feeling of his phantom fingers but his eyes were worse than watching him stroke his cock. In his eyes, he could see Tony’s desire. He see Tony taking in his body, he could see his want, he could see his fantasies, and he could see the sexual prowess that promised to consume Steve whole.
Steve had the strongest urge to reach over and pinch his arm. They’d gotten into the habit of doing it whenever one of them wanted to hold the others hand but couldn’t do so because they were in public. That urge they’d developed was still there as were his feelings…
“I am not going to let you sacrifice yourself needlessly,” Natasha retorted, sounding just as angry. Tony looked between the two in confusion. Wasn’t Barnes trying to kill her? Why did he care if she followed?
Tony did not pause like he usually did to admire the way Steve’s ass clenched as he punched. There was no time for naughty thoughts about his best friend right now.
Memories came trickling back to him. The last thing he remembered was being swallowed by the same thing that had swallowed his son.
“We need to issue another statement,” Pepper replied dryly. “You need to stand by Steve, remember? The sooner we get it out the better. Had you answered your phone I wouldn't have had to come up here and tell you this.”
Wade laughed and he eagerly replied to May, “Yes, please! I always wondered if it were possible for Pete to look any cuter!”
There had to be something Steve could do…He was willing to do anything at this point to save both Peter and Tony.
“You know you love it,” Wade retorted as he leaned toward him making kissy faces. He expected Peter to playfully push him back but his baby boy leaned in and lightly kissed him.
His words were…mellow and Steve even felt a little sad by it too. They wouldn’t last forever… even their time at the fortress was coming to an end. The Colonel issued the move order just yesterday...
BUT I was able to squeeze in some writing time and now here's the new chapter! There is science in this chapter and I tried to research the correct science but it may be the incorrect science! XD
Peter rolled his eyes and walked into the kitchen, groaning, “I don't want to fight about this again. Let's talk about something else. Anything else.”
To Tony, one thing was certain: Steve was the media’s sweetheart and Tony was the old dog they liked to kick.
He could hear the smile in Tony’s voice as he replied, “With me teaming up with you, we’ll be indestructible. They made a big mistake!”
“I think we need to add this to our training regimen,” she murmured jokingly and kissed him again. This time it was short and she broke it with a smile. She got to her feet and helped him up.
Tony grasped his hand again and Steve carded his fingers into his, making sure they would not disconnect for a while. Tony’s body would take twice as long as his to heal. It’d probably be weeks until he was out of the hospital. With the damage inflicted by the stones, Steve didn’t know if he would return to full strength either…
“Like I said last night, we need to be in each other’s personal space and touching all the time,” Tony said and elaborated by grasping Steve’s hand. Steve jerked in surprise and his muscles tensed beneath Tony’s grasp.
super solider! Tony was an idiot! He shouldn’t have let him get so close. His helmet was malfunctioning and the visor was going out. He needed to remove it. He took it off and glared at the Red Skull with his own eyes. He dropped the helmet as the Red Skull sat himself up straighter in the rubble.
Sorry for the long wait! BUT I have finally made up my mind on where this fic is going so the tags have been updated! And I once again deliver unto you two chapters!
They shared an awkward silence as they stared at each other, both wondering how to interact with the other. Peter darkly wondered if Harry feared him now. Had he looked online at all the articles and reports about Venom? Venom was reported as a demon from Hell. The monster was vilified as being one of the worst as it was responsible for a number of deaths, Pops included…
Venom rose with them and remained attached to Peter by several points and began to start sticking to Steve. The mass on Steve’s back had already fled and rejoined the main body.
Tony and Peter were laying on the floor. Peter, as always, was curled into his father’s side and his young face was contorted in anguish, even as he slept. Tony was awake and sitting at an uncomfortable angle with his unbroken arm slung protectively around Peter’s back. Tony motioned Bruce to be quiet so he tiptoed the rest of the way and silently knelt beside them.
Steve grabbed his shoulder and quickly pacified, “We’re telling the truth, Tony. The judge will hear that.”
But he also discovered a sweeter side to his soulmate when they made love. In the act of sex, when either one of them were thrusting into the other, Tony was always talking…but it was always about Steve. He would gasp how much he loved him and how wonderful he was in bed or in general. At the end, when they were all blissed out and cuddling, he’d whisper to Steve how fulfilled he felt with him and that he no longer felt alone ever since Steve had welcomed him into his heart.
Steve’s hands spread across the muscles on Tony’s back and then he rubbed Tony’s shoulders as he murmured, “They’re almost done.”
Their conversation in the hospital came back to him. Tony had said since Steve did not kiss Bucky he did not cheat. There was nothing for Tony to forgive.
“Whoops,” Tony chuckled beneath him. Steve looked down at Tony in surprise. He was expecting annoyance from people prying into their private lives. Steve himself was a little apprehensive about the reaction from the press.
Natasha regarded him then turned to leave. With her back to him, she whispered, “The flowers did it.”
“What if…?” Howard began but Tony was already out. The implications of this new discovery changed everything. What if everything that had happened was meant to happen? What if it happened like that in Tony’s timeline too because he was always meant to be here?
Additionally, Steve and Tony are going to grow closer and eventually live up to their Super Husbands tag (hint hint hint!!)!
They stepped out of the room discussing the coffee provided by the hospital and just missed Steve’s hand sinking into the warm spot left by Tony’s body.
He hadn’t really thought how to bring this up or go about doing it…when Peter was kidnapped and his fate unknown, so many different fears ran through him but the strongest had been regret. There would’ve been so much they hadn’t done yet. He didn’t want to miss out on any of it. So, on the plane ride back, he resolved to erase some of those regrets by the end of the night.
Steve and Tony froze and then slowly turned around. The same young man from the photo stepped in from one of the outside doors. He was wearing black workout gear with a small, white slanted “A” in a circle over his heart. He walked toward them with a confused expression.
“Yeah, it’s about Tony…” Steve sighed. “Howard said he needed a centralized location…him being in the field will make him useless for Tony…”
They both laughed and answered the call. It was a video chat so Tony positioned the phone so all three of them were in it and Tony greeted Bucky with a happy, “Hello~!”
Natasha did not break Bucky’s nose but at dinner he was sporting a fairly large bruise under his right eye. Tony also appeared off edge and shot Natasha wary glances.
thought he'd go back on his word. Even when they had to reveal it to others, Steve always looked to Tony to make sure it was okay…except now.
Before she entered, Steve positioned himself between the door and his teammates. His right hand twitched for his absent shield. For a moment, he felt nauseated and weak without it. It had never been far from his hand in all his battles but now it was gone. He clenched his fists and pushed aside the uneasy feelings. If he needed to fight his fists would do just fine.
“Perfect,” Tony stated, turning his attention back to the other two. “That leaves us enough time to discuss all of
Steve still couldn’t get over the fact that this was real, that Tony was real, and what they were creating was real. Steve broke their kiss and whispered into Tony’s mouth, “Thank you.”
Tony flew for another hour, reviewing all the information SHIELD was posting about the situation. Apparently, Steve had gotten help from a local clergyman of the area and he was taken in for questioning but was invoking his right as a priest to keep what was said between him and Steve private.
! Jarvis Security Override Alpha-Foxtrot-12. Who is it??” Tony demanded. They all rushed into the elevator and the doors closed behind them.
Tony sat on the guest couch and Steve sat close next to him. He would only need to shift slightly to lean into him but he held back…for now. An excited thrill ran through him and he and Tony exchanged wide grins.
“Fuck,” Tony cursed when he saw the combined worry in Steve’s eyes, the anger in his clenched jaw, and the sadness in his knotted brow.
Tony had yet to sleep in his and Steve’s bed since they last shared it. Instead, he first slept in his workshop then, after the funeral, he slept in Peter’s room. Peter seemed contented by his presence so he easily reasoned he should keep doing it. Every night, Peter buried his face into Tony’s chest, closed eyes that were bathed in the light from Tony’s reactor, and sighed contently.
Steve had a sharpie in his jacket, he was used to giving autographs and was always prepared. He signed the only paper available to them, a piece of the brown paper bag.
But Tony broke their kiss and pulled out of their embrace. Steve groaned with need and pouted at Tony. Tony was smiling and whispered, “Our island getaway, remember?”
Steve listened with a small smile and nestled his face closer to Tony’s to follow along better and to just be closer to Tony.
she gasped, her voice filling with horrified realization. "He must have sent the suit to me right before the explosion..."
He studied his son, taking in his apparent fear, his shaking, the way his head was drooped, and how he kept looking over his shoulder.
So Bucky did. He told Steve of when he met Natasha, a young woman, cold and hard under the near lifetime tutelage under the infamous Red Room. He had been assigned to teach her what he knew and was to spar with her so her superior strength could be matched. The beginning was fuzzy to Bucky, but he had a feeling they did not speak much, as they were conditioned to by their masters.
In the last few years, Peter was beginning to notice his fathers had aged in more ways than one. Physically, they had both changed differently. Dad’s once dark hair was now sprinkled with grey and his wrinkles, which he jokingly called ‘laugh lines,’ had become more pronounced and numerous. Pops had no grey hair but his blond hair had grown lighter as if it had faded with age and was preparing for the greys to come. He also had similar ‘laugh lines’ as Dad. Most noticeably, he had grown pronounced crow’s feet at the corners of his eyes which he was absolutely ecstatic about as it was a sign that he was not immortal despite the number of times he came back to life from mortal injuries.
Tony made Peter a number of new toys, including a new Iron Man action figure to replace the one that had been lost to the wreckage of Air Force One.
Peter's eyes spanned from his parents and then to the digital clock at his bedside reading 6:05 am. Both of them were still standing in his doorway therefore whatever the problem was, it was clearly not urgent so Peter fell back into his soft mattress. He sighed, “Wha’s up?”
Tony smiled warmly at him then lifted the toys up for a second. He said, “I need to take these to the lab. I will be back in a minute.”
Tony nearly jumped out of his skin upon Peggy’s question. He pulled his head out of from underneath the hood of the car he’d been working on and found his aunt to be leaning against the car.
“I guess we’ll just have to keep going out on dates and looking cute,” Tony said with an exaggerated sigh.
"And I hear, Peter's back too?" Natasha asked with a smile. Steve had never seen her smile so much before. She'd been so broken by the loss of Bucky, their friends, and his son. To be back, with Bucky and everyone else returned, she must've been so overjoyed that her usual reserved demeanor was cracked.
“As well as one can be still recovering from several stab wounds…” Peter retorted dryly. He looked to Tony and teased, “Next year, I think we’ll forgo the alien abduction for my birthday, sound good?”
“No prob, Cap,” Tony replied with a shrug, not meeting his eyes. He continued, “Look, I am sorry if my hug or warming your hands was awkward. I did not mean anything by it. I know it upset you…”
They landed with a breathless oomph and the Soldier’s back was aching from the impact but Natasha chuckled, pressing her face into his chest to muffle it, and he barely noticed the pain.
He wordlessly came up behind his friend and wrapped his arms around Steve and pressed his face in between his shoulder blades. He had expected Steve to push him away. Instead, Steve leaned back into Tony and wrapped his arms over Tony’s on his waist.
Tony squeezed Steve a little tighter and inhaled his unique scent, solidifying the man in his mind. He just needed to keep reminding himself of that he was here to stay and eventually he should be able to stomach the darkness.
Steve squeezed Tony’s hand and whispered, “I am alive, you don’t need to worry about me anymore. We need to worry about Peter now…”
As soon as the doors reopened, Tony rushed out of the elevator and straight to the kitchen where he had left Peter and Steve.
He heard Maria panting in shallow gasps beside him and he saw she was pinned, her legs trapped and her beautiful face pale, half covered in blood, and twisted in pain.
For the first time, in a long time, Steve felt safe. He was one step closer to getting home and was surrounded by his countrymen.
“You're no good at fibbing, especially to me,” Bucky stated. “And you've been making goo-goo eyes at each other
Peggy must have been able to read him like a book because she stated, “Tony and Bucky may disagree, but I think you did the right thing.” Steve turned to her but saw her eyes were on Howard. She continued talking to him, however, and whispered, “If I was in your shoes, I would have done the same thing…”
He thought he was in a foreign city until he saw the familiar spire of Empire State Building in the distance. Steve climbed to the top of a building and spun around, taking in the familiar and unusual skyscrapers. Under his breath, and with his pulse picking up, and his mind grasping for answers, he gasped, “Wh-What?”
The metal doors opened up to the training gym and they all made their way to the locker room to change. Peter dragged Wade over to his locker and whispered, “I want to surprise the others about Venom. Can you shield me as I ‘change’?”
Tony’s immediate flush answered that question, making Steve smile. Tony grumbled, “I just wanted today to be special…”
“…No, Peter,” she replied. “But he is more of a father in the five years he raised you than that man would be in a lifetime.”
“Tony, you brought a Howling Commando into the house. One who everyone thought died 70 years ago until you found him in the middle of a coverup made by Hydra, an evil society everyone also thought dead! And he’s frozen in this thing in the middle of your lab! How – How are you going to get him out of there? Is he okay?”
“Yes, I did,” Steve whispered hoarsely. His leg was tense at first but he quickly relaxed under Tony’s touch. He moved his leg closer to Tony and Tony’s foot moved with him. He began to caress his inner thigh, his foot coming within centimeters of his crotch. Heat began to pool in his groin and Steve bit back a moan.
It was the first time he and his son would be separated for a prolonged period. He inhaled another shuddering breath then straightened, his hand tightening on the toy Peter gave him. Guarding the President was going to be an easy, safe gig and Peter was going to be just as safe with his aunt, uncle, and the hive of SHIELD agents watching over him. Steve closed his eyes and whispered to himself, “Everything is going to be okay…”
“Tony gets a little grumpy when he’s woken earlier than he’s used to,” Steve whispered apologetically and rubbed some calming circles into the flesh of Tony’s back. Tony leaned into his touch with a light sigh. Bucky did not seem to hear him however and he stopped pacing and stared at the wall, his gaze calculating.
Buchanan Barnes, was the James I knew. I thought what he was remembering about New York was about a past mission, until he confronted our supervisor about it. I thought they had killed him the night they took him away for remembering something he was not supposed to!” She laughed ironically and gasped, “That’s why I changed my codename to Black Widow because I thought I had lost the only man I could ever love. It was stupid really. I should have known they would just erase him again. A damaged super solider is still better than no super soldier at all!”
He walked over to the plane controls, his heart growing heavier with every step. He tried, there was the slightest chance that he could gain control of the plane, but he had no response from most of the controls…only the flaps seemed to work meaning he could position the plane pointed up or down…
They left the command tent and, unsurprisingly, Peggy was quickly on their shadow. Bucky led them away from the main activity of the camp and found Steve a quiet stump to sit on. Bucky shooed away the soldier on watch and took his spot, scanning the perimeter.
“And both of you are sneaking around my workshop!! How did you get in without a code??” Tony demanded.
Rogers smiled sadly at him and said, “We haven’t even properly introduced ourselves to each other and you’re doing this for me?”
He cracked open his eyes and took in his surroundings. He was in a huge tent shaped similarly to a house. It look to be twenty-by-thirty feet in size but seemed smaller because of all of the equipment…and this equipment, he’d never seen anything like it.
Peter knew he was pushing his luck but he asked, “Can Wade come over tonight? He won’t come for dinner! It’s definitely too soon after the last one but…I just…” Peter flushed and murmured, “I’d like him to spend the night.” The muscles in Tony’s jaw flexed as he clenched his teeth so Peter added, “I can pick him up later,
Steve never felt as free as when he was making love with Tony. In the time since they started, Steve learned more about Tony than he ever thought possible. In the throes of passion, the older man was more lose lipped and tender. Tony whispered endearments that made Steve’s heart flutter and eyes prickle.
“Tony,” Steve whispered. He tugged their clasped hands in the direction he wanted him to look. Tony lifted his head, followed his point, and smirked.
Tony’s face broke into a smile and he took Steve’s bandaged hand in his, interlacing their fingers. Steve’s breath caught in his throat.
This time it wasn't Steve who flushed and Tony embarrassedly flushed but also fondly smiled down at his notes. Steve's eyes were trapped by those lips. He was becoming obsessed with every way they moved. Tony's gaze rose back up in seconds and Steve saw an excited spark that wasn't there before. His lips quirked into a coy grin and Steve's breath caught in his throat.
Ben stepped up behind her and gently placed his hand on Peter’s head. Peter lifted his head and peered at his uncle with damp, glassy eyes.
He could see annoyance in Steve’s eyes, no surprise there. It seemed like it was an automatic reaction for both of them when their eyes met but…that wasn’t the strongest emotion.
Steve heard the teasing timber of Natasha's voice in the background and felt tears come to his eyes again.
“You bet your ass I’m worried,” Bucky hissed.  Bucky crossed his arms over his chest and whispered, “And he will hurt you just like all the others because he cannot
“We…ah…can take them to my tent. No one can intrude on…whatever is going on here?” Howard volunteered, clearly a little confused by the turn in conversation.
Peter nodded sadly, feeling bummed by the fact someone he knew had sold his image to the tabloids. He had hung out with Mac on numerous occasions. They got along. His number was one of the ones he did not delete from his phone. Peter couldn’t believe he’d do that to Peter knowing that it was an invasion of his privacy…
Tony turned back to the Mark III with a huff. Things were not adding up and he did not like it when that happened. He used to ignore it, but that kind of thinking was what lead to his weapons being sold under the table to groups like the Ten Rings.
. You woke me from all my other nightmares, please take me out of this one…” Tony waited and hoped against hope…but Steve did not wake him, because Tony was not asleep, and what remained of Steve was laying only a few inches away, sealed away in his eternal rest.
He knew now that those running shoes he had seen were the Captain’s. Captain Rogers had been in the same building as Coulson – maybe just in the other room, when Coulson was there…He could not believe he missed it. But, most importantly…
“I have been getting more action. Tony hasn’t hooked up with anyone since he and Pepper broke up,” Clint informed them with a smirk.
“I can go to the west side of the building, the furthest area from Steve, and cause a scene to draw most of his forces to me. Schmidt would fight to get me alive. Then you guys can come in the east and get Steve,” Tony stated, already coming up with half a dozen ways he could do it.
Steve followed Bucky out but the Winter Soldier disappeared as soon as he stepped over the threshold to the hotel room.
He finally acknowledged what he had been avoiding for days: there was nothing more they could do for Steve.
Breath caught in his throat, Steve’s head snapped to the side as Bucky stepped aside, revealing the other hospital bed in the room.
“He’s different now,” Peter whispered as he thought of the man who had stepped into his life, hours earlier. “Ever since the Avengers…”
Steve. Steve never before felt so blessed. He wished he could launch himself across the room and embrace Tony tightly out of gratitude but he held back to keep from being thrown out of the court.
Steve nodded and without another word stomped out of the tent with Tony in his arms. Peggy had a smaller Command tent set up for the British liaisons part of the company. Mostly the espionage for the company went through her so she needed the privacy to hold onto the secrets they had. It had enough room for a 4-person table and a few lockboxes to hold her coded paperwork.
Smirking, Tony leaned into Steve and Steve lay his head on top of his. Just as Tony was beginning to feel a little dozy from the car ride, Steve whispered, “So we’re really dating now? We’re really not just doing this on the side anymore?”
“A fake relationship with a man you coined ‘Stars, Spangles, and Sex?’” Bruce stated as soon as they were alone.
He saw Bucky openly compare Tony and Howard, looking between them for similarities. Steve purposely did not do so. But, as he looked at the two newcomers, he couldn’t help but note little things about Howard that he saw in Tony, like the way they each held their shoulders in the same confident manner and had the same dark brown hair. Otherwise, they seemed to be virtual strangers...But, would Howard notice anything?
“I’m here, Tony,” Steve whispered. “I will always be here. Why else would I be here other than to stay with you? You’re my soulmate. I am not going to leave you.”
time traveling. So, to answer your question, no, it isn’t the last of it. Your hand will unwilling be in every paradox that was created because of this.” Tony stumbled back and Steve helped lead him back to a bench and he sat down heavily. Cable continued, “Your granddaughter will even be forced to use it to travel back to the past to chase after a Neo-Hydra agent but will not be able to stop the man from divulging the secrets of time travel to the first generation Hydra scientists…”
Steve played with the flask in his hand and he thought about Natasha’s words and Tony. Steve had missed so much from his mate’s life but he still felt uneasy.
Gasping like he had run miles, Peter used the alleyway’s wall as support as he pushed himself toward the main road.
Steve rolled his eyes and murmured, “Disgustingly so. I don’t think we have any problem there anymore.”
God had a plan for him and in a week’s time, he’d meet the person he would spend the rest of his life with…
! Jarvis lock down the Tower and all the Avenger’s phones against searches for banana hammocks!! Pepper, where’s my luggage? Why haven’t you packed it?! I have been waiting since yesterday to see Steve!”
Steve rolled his eyes and said, “Let’s focus on the mission, guys.” He turned to Sitwell and asked, “Who do you want to kick you off the roof next? Clint? Tony? Sam? Or maybe I’ll take a whack at it?”
There was no turning back now. Everyone believed they were together. Now Steve and Tony had to continue their act to convince everyone of his innocence…
Steve barely knew the man, but the sound of Fury’s voice just now unnerved him. He wasn’t alone. The others too were quiet and looked between Fury and Wade with concern.
Tony went to do his duties with Panzer and Steve was about to go to his room to drop off the coal when Tony suddenly pinched his arm again. He whispered, “I’ll see you later…”
“It’s strange to imagine a future where holding your hand in public would be considered okay,” Steve whispered wistfully. “…But, I'm more than happy with this arrangement.”
Tony felt his “unfit” tendencies tingling and he asked, “So, if you had data to work with, it’ll help?”
Tony groaned loudly into Steve’s chest. He stopped swaying and whispered, “We’ll continue this later…” Tony turned to Bucky but stayed connected to Steve with through a lightly clasped hand and by leaning into his side.
The tension escalated when Steve placed his hands on Stark’s shoulders. Stark could not see Steve’s face but maybe he could sense his husband’s wrath. Wade was both scared and fascinated. He’d never seen Steve this angry and he’d fought with the Avengers against Hydra.
Everyone was excited to be back but James was the only one who had never been to the building before and he did not know how to react. He was cautious and still wary of the trigger words but he was also…content.
“Arguing with me!” Bruce gasped, “You know for a fact that I turn into a murderous, rage machine when I am angry but you insist on always being right!”
They were getting close to the French coast now. They could already smell the salt in the air and the men were getting anxious to reach the ocean and let off some steam in the cool waves. They were in Allied territory too and the men were more relaxed and talkative as they marched. The mood in the company was good. They passed more civilians now on the roads and they always greeted the Americans with a wave of the hand or smiles.
In Steve’s mind’s eye, he saw the time machine in the French Hydra base that Tony had traveled through. He specifically remembered the giant circular structure that sat behind the seat. It had looked eerily similar to the gears in Cable’s glove and the one’s they had used to gather the infinity stones.
“Gimmie, gimmie,” Tony gasped, making grabby motions for the coffee. Steve sighed heavily and stepped back to let Tony grab the drink.
Iron Man was silent but he could imagine Tony laughing behind his mask. Steve knew him well enough that he probably looked up the term as soon as Bucky said it.
He was going to gain the weapon and then rip Tony out of Bucky’s hands but froze a few feet from the gun when Tony cried out sharply.
Tony flew him level with Mary’s floor and Steve swung from his hold and crashed through the glass. He rolled into the landing and stood in the hallway he and Tony had twice crossed to get to Mary’s lab.
“I-I don’t have any lube,” Tony stuttered. Steve didn’t either and he hadn’t been planning to do this until Tony asked him to touch him in such a sultry voice.
He didn’t think he would be able to fight with Bucky until he met Dr. Erskine and his entire life changed.
Peter smirked as he remembered Wade’s cheesy one-liners. Laying in Wade’s arms, Peter truthfully replied, “I feel blessed too. You are the greatest thing to ever happen to me…”
“What is going on?” Peggy demanded as soon as Steve as sitting. He buried his face in his hands and did not reply. He just closed his eyes and breathed steadily, trying to calm his heart into submission. The steady pain remained but the urge to falter lessened somewhat.
Steve was tangible. Steve was alive. Steve was the center of his universe and Tony came to the horrific conclusion that he must do all that was within his power to save him.
To which, Tony grinned and replied, “I’m just hoping he makes two cards because if he gives us only one I am stealing it and hording it in my workshop…”
“What did you expect him to do? He saw Venom eat you, then me, and Peter was gone so he undoubtedly assumed he was eaten too…Stark thought he just lost his entire family. He went a little mad.”
Tony led the way and Natasha asked the other two about their old place in Brooklyn. Steve and Bucky traded off as they described it. Tony wordlessly led them all, wearing a big smile that none of them could see. The stairs led them down into a hall and Tony opened a side door that led them the back way into their new living room.
So we're coming near the conclusion, how many more chapters to go, I can't say... originally this was only going to be like 4,000 words and fluffy but then I remembered Venom and this angsty multi-chapter beast was born!
Steve grasped Tony’s arm and whispered, “Tony, we knew the DNA would match. We thought this would happen…Please, let me go.”
Steve listened and watched it all happen numbly. The breath froze in his lungs and his body had solidified into a statue.
“Floor or highchair?” Steve asked Peter. Peter lifted his head to peer at his father from his upside-down position.
Peter was sleeping. Even in sleep, his small hands were latched tightly onto Tony’s hospital gown as if he expected to be torn from his side at any moment.
Steve chuckled and then, in the most husky voice he’d ever come out of his husband, Steve whispered in his ear, “Where is it?”
“We don’t have to let the horror continue,” Tony stated. “I know you don’t trust us but we are willing to do anything you want to gain that trust!”
The suit was pressed onto him quickly and he would have bruises later but Tony made it do just that because the threat was real and he needed to be in his suit
As the hole in his chest was revealed, Peggy was surprisingly the first to curse with Bucky joining her by agreeing, “You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.”
Wade asked, “How are you feeling?” He shifted against Peter, moving closer to him by hooking his legs behind Peter's.
Tony got to his feet and all the hairs stood on end on his arms. Tony guardedly approached him. Peter watched him from the corner of his eye and tried not to draw attention to the fact that he was watching Tony’s every move.
“Bucky is going to have a fat head the rest of the night just because of his hair, you know?” Steve whispered to him in a tease.
They reentered the building. The note that Steve had ripped off the wall was still on the ground and they stepped over it. Natasha only spared the paper a glance.
He had struggled with Bucky’s fall from the train before and after traveling back to the future. He couldn’t save Bucky in the past because of the threat to the future…but he could save him now.
Deadpool was one of the few people whom he could fight at full strength without having to worry about hurting or killing. In the lull of any type of quarrel with the X-Men or Avengers, he would call the mercenary up to go a few rounds.
Eventually, they ventured back into the team’s common area. Tony had texted ahead to tell the others they were finally coming out and they were all waiting for them. Steve held Tony’s hand in his without notice and when they came to a stop, Tony leaned into his side. Over a week earlier, Steve would have been fumbling from Tony’s touch but now his presence at Steve’s side was as natural as breathing.
“Hey, buddy. You can’t sleep here.” Steve’s foot was nudged and he snapped open his eyes and sat up just as quickly. A tired looking, police officer was staring down at him in predawn light.
She continued to murmur names as their carded fingers moved and caressed one another. The strange feeling returned but he embraced it and was finally able to label what was growing in his heart: love.
“That will make your eyes sting,” Tony commented, when he saw the suds on Steve’s fingertips. The water soaked Steve, washing over his head and into his face.
Hearing his fathers’ surnames on her lips seemed so strange and drew Peter’s gaze back up. Why didn’t she call them by their first names?
Tony grumbled unintelligibly and shifted on his side and closer to Steve, burying his face in Steve’s pectorals. He leaned into Steve with a content sigh and his breathing began to even out as he returned to sleep.
Steve crossed the stage and went straight to him. He took Tony’s outstretched hand with a firm grip, and, with his other hand, he tenderly grasped Tony’s jaw, leaned into his personal space, and then kissed him.
Steve nodded then went to the cabinet she point to and found the kit she was talking about. He silently placed it next to her then turned to leave.
Sneaky nodded once more and flew out of the broken window. Steve and Bucky turned in unison to watch it go.
Steve pressed his face into Tony’s neck with a chuckle but his hands snaked their way around his hips.
His relief was short lived as Venom was being attack on all sides by the Avengers. Venom was quick and its body was almost like fluid as it moved and dodged attacks by taking inhuman forms but the Avengers were still able to hit him, Tony especially.
Tony’s lawyers had been reduced to a smaller team. Four of them were there, probably to make defending Steve a little more manageable. The others were mostly busily preparing for the trial. Marcel was leading them and directed the other three’s attention to Steve and Tony.
Tony had summarized Bucky’s retelling, “Okay, so one day when you two were training and you pinned her down and stole a kiss and things went ba-da bing ba-da boom from there.”
“No and it’s really starting to bother me,” Tony murmured and hit refresh on his computer again. Could Tony have miscalculated? Did they move too fast? –
Steve adjusted his arms around Tony and then lay his head on top of his lover’s. Holding Tony like made Steve's entire being content and he couldn’t help but agree, “Yeah, they are…”
“It’s his odd way of showing he cares about you. He thinks Wade is taking advantage of you,” Steve explained, folding up his newspaper and crossing his arms in front of him to give Peter his full attention.
They cleared away the last of the blankets and Peter pulled Wade into his embrace. They fell onto the bed together, hooking their legs and shifting their arms underneath their bodies so they wouldn’t fall asleep immediately. Peter inhaled deeply, drinking in Wade’s scent again, and then letting it go with a content sigh.
“Looks like you need help elsewhere, soldier,” Steve replied. The Captain reached over and pinched Tony's chin where Tony had nicked himself shaving. He’d been practicing on himself ever since Steve first helped him shave. With every day, he had improved but still made accidental cuts.
Stark read between the lines and his anger returned with unrestricted ferocity. Stark’s body was still bond by the weight of his suit but he screamed with all of his might, “HE’S A HUMAN BEING! He does not deserved to be locked away just because he’s a little different! I swear if you hurt him I will drag down your organization down until even its foundation is dust!”
“…I shall take you to your apartments, Master Rogers,” Jarvis stated gently and the elevator began to move.
Tony spun around and smirked as his eyes fell on his lover. Steve was back in his bathrobe and was holding a second comforter.
Steve believed him because he trusted him. Yet the super soldier almost did not go until he suggested Steve take Bucky with him. The Winter Solider was still having a hard time with his memories and the trip might do him good. Steve wholeheartedly agreed and thanked Tony.
They were several miles away from the target location and on the roof of some nondescript office building. The entire team was surveying the location in their own way. Clint was at her side also looking through his own binoculars, Thor was flying reconnaissance, and Bruce and Tony were still in the quinjet, looking up the blueprints to the building.
Steve felt jittery. He needed to go to Tony and Fury must’ve noticed as he said, “You want to go right to him?”
Steve learned all he could about Tony’s body in the period when they couldn’t get their hands off of each other. He knew where to touch him just right to make him moan in ecstasy or tease him just enough to make in groan from sexual frustration. He realized kissing him along the ribs made his toes curl and he became more turned on by Steve’s strength when he pushed him into the bed.
???” Wade’s heart dropped and Peter’s eyes widened a fraction in surprise and, in those few seconds, the symbiote attacked. It screeched in vengeance, “If
“We’re not going if James doesn’t consume any liquids today,” Natasha murmured, sliding next to Bucky. She placed a bowl of oatmeal and a mug of tea in front of her. She began to eat leisurely but her shoulders were rigidly set in a way that spoke volumes to her lover.
She stood up and gained her composure as she glanced back to the corpse. The man had been shot multiple times in the chest and his throat had been crushed by an inhumanly strong grip. The Winter Soldier’s metal arm came to mind and she turned to the officer.
Peter dutifully listened and finished off two more chimichangas as he did. The hand he had on Wade’s arm eventually slipped down but Wade kept his hand connected to his and their entwined hands lay between them. Peter turned his hand over and carded his fingers through Wade’s. Wade sat up a little straighter after he did that.
Steve pressed his face into Tony’s hair and inhaled his scent deeply. Steve closed his eyes and whispered, “I can get used to this too…”
