“You can't make us stay.” Sherlock stared at him with his jaw defiantly set. Holmes only looked back at him sadly.
“It's strange, though”, John says, keeping his voice casual. “When she cheated the first time, her cat went crazy. I'm telling you, it's the laziest cat I've met, but the day after, it completely wrecked her apartment. Toppled the Christmas tree, broke all her plants, played with the rubbish, it even took in a rat and ate it on the couch.” Sherlock keeps looking out his window, pretending not to listen. John is unfazed: “That's justice, right there. Almost like God intervened to punish her.”
He reached past Sherlock and picked up a jewellery box. It opened with a creak, revealing a necklace made out of a hundred small diamonds. Sherlock exhaled in real shock at the sight of the treasure.
“Don't feel bad for me, John, I told you. I want to go where you want to go. It provides me with more data about you.” John tightens his arms, and Sherlock contentedly wriggles back into him. “Also, it's a sex holiday. It doesn't matter
He slowly leaned down, brushing his smooth cheek against mine ever so softly. I could barely breathe, but I heard his breath in my ear, steady and familiar. When he sang, his voice was so quiet it nearly disappeared in the air.
you don’t feel up to”, John rushes to say. “It’s just that… well, I don’t want to part from you. I just want to know you’re there.”
At eleven fifty-nine, John gets up from his chair, stretches his arms behind his back, then walks over to the couch. It strikes him, as it daily does, how incredibly beautiful Sherlock is – even when he’s sulking. His perfect lips are turned down and his thick brows knit, making him look like a thundercloud; just as dark, ominous and awe-inspiring.
I raised my eyebrows in surprise. “Well, you need to work that out with your choreographer, don't you.”
“I was interested once. Surely you know that already. You said it yourself; if I were to be with someone, it should be someone like you. I’m not idiot enough not to recognise that when you turned up. But it was evident that you weren’t interested, and it was more important to me that our living arrangement worked. So I made myself stop thinking that way. It was a long time ago. It has not been an issue since.”
I want to create a sanctuary around her. I want to provide the place that she can come back to after she has run all over the world, a place to rest and be free for a moment. I want her to feel that she has the space to be whatever she needs to when she is with me.
(The Fervour) – Writing soundtrack for John and William's summer together, snogging outside the dance barn and whatnot
It hurts less than I thought it would, to write all that down. Sherlock was right, of course he was. Even when… even in a moment like that, he was right. There is a way for me to keep him with me. I have made that night in the elephant immortal, and though it's not nearly enough, I have time. I will write down everything that would be a sin to forget.
John chuckles while he runs the tap. The sofa's leather creaks when Sherlock sits down on it, spewing insults about John's movie taste and his ignorance about what
in a previous relationship, and so I could not know what that feeling of safety would bring. I think the difference is that I don’t feel any pressure from you to change. And I’m not afraid that you will leave when you discover what I am like, or what my Work is like. You already know those things; you
John looks into his serious eyes, and his heart beats harder when he hears what else it is Sherlock is saying.
He sprinted through narrow halls, knocking into people in his way without so much as an apologetic look, leaving any politeness for me to take care of when I followed a second after him. He burst into cluttered dressing rooms, tore his way through costume cupboards, rushed up staircases to run recklessly across unstable wooden attic floors.
As soon as he starts talking again, Sherlock moves his fingers. He slowly traces the hem of John’s boxer briefs with one light finger, nearly feeling the heat of John’s trapped privates through the thin fabric. John soldiers on:
. Our eyes lock instantly when I enter the dance barn, and the tension between us is so thick my breath catches. There's a happy bounce in my feet that would carry me across the room to him if I didn't watch it; there's a heat in my hands that would make me reach out and touch him if I came too close.
I opened the button on Sherlock's suit jacket, sliding my palms across his chest, under his hidden braces, hearing his shaky exhale when I skimmed past his nipples. He kissed me, his mouth immediately open, soft and filthy, his hands grasping at my thighs.
This kiss is more earnest, more fitting for their January First anniversary. Sherlock’s mouth opens slowly under John’s lips, inviting him inside. John breathes in the sweet scent of him for a few moments before he ends the kiss and turns back to the fireworks outside. For a while they just stand there together, watching the sparks rain over the city.
“I'm serious”, I said, refusing to let his display get to me. “You're a genius, Sherlock. Martha told me about how you put her abuser in jail. That's incredible, Sherlock. Simply incredible.” He looked at me in silence, and I tried a small smile. “The police needs you.”
I turned my gaze to Sherlock, who had something almost pleading in his eyes. I understood perfectly well what was on the line for him. A singer, a dancer, an actor like him, trapped on the dance floor of a brothel. He needed a show that would allow him to shine in all his grace and dignity, and by God, I was going to give it to him.
Turning back to his mirror, he picked up a lipstick from the table. He started to redo the make-up smeared during his fainting spell and pretended to ignore Holmes, who stood in silence, contemplating his words.
I actually laughed at that, a hollow, frightening sound. “Yeah, someone talented enough to write him his breakthrough show, and stupid enough to fall for his lies.”
John gazes up at him. He looks soft and honest, the way he only ever does in bed with John; when he doesn't impress John with his genius, when he doesn't appeal to John's weakness for the thrill of danger; when he's just Sherlock, John's best friend, his very favourite person.
“Are you finished?” John teases when there is a pause for breath. “However long you talk, it won't stop me from noticing you can't tell me what this cookie will say.”
The brass band started playing on the stage, the trapeze was lowering in wide circles, and the audience was whistling and reaching up to touch Sherlock's outstretched hand. When he started singing again, his tone had changed with the quickening beat; the dreamlike smoothness was gone, and in its place was a confident ferocity.
No one said anything more after that, and neither of us even glanced to the side. We watched the movie to the end and then we went to bed.
“Hello, Doctor Watson-Holmes”, Sherlock breathes across his lips before kissing him again, deeper this time. His caresses over John's breast can't be called an accident now.
It's unexpectedly difficult to make himself move forward. There are only ten inches between their faces, no distance at all, and still it seems insurmountable. It feels as though he is about to leap off a cliff. His heart is almost choking him and his hands are trembling. After a minute, he gives up.
Knowing the reason for all this doesn't change shit. He still killed himself in front of me, he still left and let me break apart, I still lost the love of my life. Now I don't even know where to aim my anger and I'm afraid it will soon rip me apart.
“Just, that’s very different from the flat Harry and I grew up in. I wouldn’t even know what to use all that space for, with just two kids.”
“Goodnight”, John says and pulls Sherlock into the most indecent kiss yet. Sherlock is unprepared and nearly looses his footing, but John’s strong hands grip him, holding him in place. One hand rests firmly on the back of his neck, and the other caresses his side.
John comes home from her flat, and is surprised every time at how easy it is to breathe in 221B. Everything is effortless, even the arguments about inappropriate experiments; it only makes him feel safe, relaxing some part of him that he didn't know was tense. And Sherlock looks like home. He looks like something John wants to bury into and just
John picks up a half-read novel from the side table and continues where he left off. After a while, there’s an enraged growl from the couch. “The smug bastard!”
I only had to undo two of the buttons to reach him. He fell back onto his elbows with a groan at the first touch of my lips. I opened up slowly, tasting him and the sweet bead of liquid he had already released.
I imagine his words hitting my solar plexus, seeping through my skin and carefully starting to bloom inside of me. I allow myself to sit with the radiating warmth of them for a moment.
John does, and then freezes. There's an engraving on the back of the phone, looking just like the one for Harry.
John's mouth falls open: “Oh my God”, he gasps. Sherlock's deep voice settles in his very bones, deeper than any female voice could ever be, and it's the most erotic thing he has heard in his life.
Fresh air. Melting snow, slush and mud. Pouring water in spontaneous brooks. Hint of sun through thin cloud cover.
He barely even looked up at me, casual and care-free. It was as though no time had passed since we last shared this space, back when John was always running one step behind me wherever I went, back when his eyes were bright and his smile kind when he looked at me. Before I lost him during the three seconds it took me to fall to the pavement outside of St Bart's hospital.
Sherlock finds himself quite drawn to John’s hipbones, and especially the dips inside them. They create a small gap in the waistband which seems to invite a finger to accidentally slip inside. Whenever Sherlock pauses there and dips his fingertip a few millimetres in, John stops breathing.
They manage an outing to the grocery store. There they can, at the very least, link their arms together. Other people get annoyed when they take up space in the queue.
A body; an intricate system. A factory of chemical reactions. Air in, oxygen absorbed. Nerve impulses, heart contracting, blood rushing. Nutrients transformed, energy, heat. Muscles tensing. Nerve endings perceiving. Brain processing, accommodating. Carbon dioxide eliminated. Air out.
how Sherlock behaves. But when Sherlock walks across the platform towards John, he is still struck by insecurity. How are they supposed to greet each other after spending time apart? Is there an etiquette for that sort of thing?
He turned from me to lift the bottle from the ice bucket, and I hoped I wasn't being rude: “If you don't mind, I'd rather just get it over and done with.”
I've danced with Täpp Lisa quite a few times. We have found each other in the dance by now, have each learned how the other's body moves. She is lovely within the circle of my arms. Her back feels delicate beneath the palm of my hands, and the smell of her hair is sweet. Her feet move in flawless time with mine. I let us spin for the duration of an entire polska just to see if we can; we don't lose our balance even once. Over her shoulder, I watch the red of her skirt flowing beautifully behind her.
She is no weight at all on top of my breastbone. Her head rests in the hollow beneath my right clavicle, slightly tilted back so I can see it. It makes her mouth drop open a bit. Her eyelids are smooth with trust.
“Perhaps that's why you always type with two fingers on your laptop”, Sherlock goes on. “You can't reach across the keyboard.”
When I ask him about the songs he played tonight, I finally manage to coax him into speaking. He has some fascinating takes on the interplay between music and dance. Every good dancer knows that what takes place on the dance floor is a dialogue, really. The dancers are inspired by the subtle changes in the music and move in answer to it, and the fiddler in turn plays off what happens in the bodies of the dancers.
Even though it had all been an act, I kept imagining Sherlock's blissed-out face as if it meant something. And then I imagined it again in the arms of another man. For a moment, I thought I was going to throw up.
He barely thinks about Tori until a text from her wakes him, where he's sleeping against the wall of Sherlock's lab at Bart's.
At eleven a.m., John is comfortable in his chair with a newspaper and a cup of tea. The paper is unceremoniously snatched from his hands and a mop of curls swoops down into his face. A sharp cheekbone crashes into his nose when Sherlock presses his lips to John's. John barely has time to take part in the kissing before Sherlock pulls back and straightens.
John remembers Christmas Day; Sherlock getting a gift from him, unable to give him something in return for fear of revealing his feelings. Probably knowing that John would think it meant he didn't care, and no doubt seeing the scarf from Tori around John's neck later. He had been in such a bad mood that day.
Which is fine. John is happy. He got what he wanted. There's no reason to miss Sherlock as much as he does, not when he sees him every day, not when their friendship is everything a friendship should be.
“Yeah. I'm working on the shape of the top surface.” I gesture at the piece of sandpaper lying beside the wood.
“No, no, I just mean… to have some tea.” I smiled at him. I had it on good authority that I had a charming, disarming smile, and it had been a great asset more than once. “You could tell me how you knew I was a soldier. At the time, I assumed Stamford had told you, but you didn't know anything about me, did you? Except you did.”
Every time he goes home, he reminds himself to be fine. But then he sees Sherlock with his hands steepled beneath his chin. Or with his furrow between the eyebrows. Or with a reckless smile at an inappropriate moment. And suddenly John longs for him from a place so deep in his soul that it scares him.
But someone else was to meet Sherlock that night. Someone lurking in the darkest shadow of the room, a thorn driven through the Moulin Rouge heart. Someone watching the singing man with his unblinking, dead eyes fixed on the vulnerable skin of Sherlock's core. Someone who could afford far more than one night alone with the sparkling man above.
After that there is no calling this off. John presses himself against the iron gate, trying to get closer to Sherlock behind it, his pelvis hoping in vain for some decent friction. He can feel Sherlock's erection in the gap between two railings. John sneaks a hand through the opening in Sherlock's coat, splaying it across the front of Sherlock's trousers. Sherlock throws his head back and moans.
“But, sorry”, he called from the stage. He was standing on the side in his Maharajah costume. “With all due respect, that doesn't fit with the bohemian spirit that this whole show is about.”
I smiled despite myself. “I guess that's just Sherlock”, I shrugged. Mary looked murderous, and I returned my attention to my coffee.
“Him”, I said weakly, but I couldn't take it back, I couldn't crawl back into the shadows and hide under the illusion of an unassuming poor man. “He doesn't love
Sherlock dropped his hands, finally satisfied with his hair. “Psychosomatic limp”, he said, meeting his own eyes in the glass.
(Lydia's) – I've listened to this song a lot during my travel across the world and my work with this fic. Especially while writing the scene in John's wood workshop!
And what a blissful existence that had been, because now that my brain was back in the works, I remembered that I was soon to meet that sparkling creature all alone. That I was here to impress him.
The scowl disappeared from Sherlock's face along with the colour on his cheeks. His lips shook around an involuntary word. “John.”
He was stopped by a punch to the nose, forceful enough to make him stagger backwards and fall. Before him stood Mycroft Holmes, looking shocked at what he had done. The gun flew through the theatre, shattering a window and disappearing into the Paris night.
Two young men with burning torches approach the bonfire as the choir bursts out in the first, grand words of
My mind was reeling, going over the facts of the diagnosis, looking for something useful in my years of medical studies. What good were they if I couldn't save this man? But I knew what consumption meant. I had seen it take more people than I care to remember.
Apparently, we were heading for my flat. We walked quietly through the windmill vestibule and onto the street. I was acutely aware of his body moving beside mine, face half-hidden behind the high, upturned coat collar. The twilight made the sky a deep-sea blue and made Sherlock's figure shadowy and thrilling. I was constantly on the border of an embarrassing blush, remembering how wrecked this now perfectly composed man had been in my arms just one day prior.
And now he's here. Sitting at our desk wrapped in a sheet, and the purple lines on his back look paler in the morning light. Gladstone is standing next to him with his tail whipping through the air, tongue out, almost jumping with enthusiasm, simply because he loves Sherlock so much. Sherlock strokes the dog's head with his delicate hands, tearing his eyes away from the laptop screen to look down at Gladstone. The furrow at the top of his nose appears in a fond smile, and I want to bloody marry that furrow.
It was strange, looking from the outside at the little cell where I was sealed off from everything remotely lively. I wasn't quite sure how I suddenly found myself in this exotic chamber, a room the opposite of my flat in every respect. Even more baffling, I was weighing my cane in both hands, wondering what to do with it.
Her right hand has come up to rest near my suprasternal notch, fist closed. My heart lies in this frighteningly breakable hand.
The empty air in my room fills with the quiet tapping of keys hitting the paper. The white sheet looks blue in the moonlight, and the black little letters look at once tentative and final. The worn keys greet my fingertips the way a bed greets the exhausted. Before today, I had not written one word since I walked out of the Moulin Rouge for the last time.
The forty-fourth year, Rosie gets out of hospital and Lestrade goes into it. Sherlock gives a beautiful speech at his funeral and then they go home, Lestrade somehow going with them and staying for a while. They talk about him and Mrs Hudson and Mycroft, and they smile.
Sherlock comes back again with wetted lips, and John can't help it. He means to keep still, because this whole thing is based on the simple rule that
The telly is on with the sound turned down so low it's almost muted. There is some sort of dance competition on that I pretend to be more annoyed with than I actually am; the premise is somewhat silly, but the choreographies are surprisingly enjoyable to watch.
But there was a small voice lodged somewhere behind his breastbone, quiet but clear, undemanding but persistent. It sang of safety and completeness. It sang of warmth and calm. It sang of softly stroking fingertips and beautiful breaths.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “That girl would never have agreed to sleep with him anyway. If anything, we spared him the humiliation of rejection.”
“Hello, boys”, Mrs Hudson smiles, standing in the door which they were too frozen to be able to unlock. “I thought I heard you. Oh, you're soaked!” She glances out the door. “It's not raining. Where have you been?”
His face nuzzled in between my thighs at first, moving upwards as his cock slid in and out of my mouth. Then his tongue was on my root, lapping its way up along my shaft. I gripped his hip, fingertips digging in.
, emphasising it by raising his hand high into the air afterwards – all the while staring at me with positively smouldering eyes. Without really thinking about why, I suddenly know with crystal clarity that this dance is solely for my benefit.
“How could you know about how long I've been in Paris, and that I don't have any…?” I trailed off, but Sherlock clearly remembered the rest.
My song was imperfect, but I had Sherlock's full attention. He didn't blink once, and I never looked away. When I fell silent, he kept gazing at me, his expression unreadable.
Soft music played when I opened the black door. Otherwise the house was quiet and still, dust particles hanging in the air in a ray of sunlight from the window by the stairs.
Gregory's arms ached under Sherlock's weight when he followed the purple-dressed Martha through the hallway. She waved impatiently at the girls standing in her way, until they reached the door to Sherlock's dressing room. Leaned against the wall stood the woman with the short, blonde hair who had tried to get me to dance. The glint in her eyes was hard as she watched Sherlock's slack face.
I drew back to rest my nose against his, and he slowly opened his eyes. There was bravery in them for looking at me in that moment.
The Hindu Dancer was surrounded by worshipping peasants. He was raised into the light, and there stood Gregory in the Maharajah's attire, holding up the expensive diamond necklace. It was even tighter now from being put back together after Moriarty broke it. The lock snapped shut around Sherlock's throat, and he was carried to the front of the stage. Gregory advanced behind him, wrapping his arms possessively around Sherlock's gaunt body.
He kept humming when he was getting dressed and I was making breakfast. He ate what I put before him, and he didn't sing then but it was as if the notes were still clinging to him. To his face, glowing with the winter sunlight, to his body's cosy movements inside a fresh grey shirt and his burgundy dressing gown, to his hair curling with damp.
“No one has touched me like this before”, Sherlock hears himself say. The pleasure cocktail has dismantled his brain-to-mouth-filter.
Sometimes the skin of Sherlock's cheek slides across his lips. He likes the feel of that, but he never does it on purpose, and he doesn't think Sherlock plans it either when he does the same to John.
She wants to return a shirt he left behind in her flat. John has no desire to come over, and she says she doesn't blame him, bitterness heavy in her text; the prawn smell is as strong as ever. It can't be the carpet and it can't be lingering in the curtains, because she's washed those. There must be some shells she never found, she writes, and she doesn't understand how the cat managed to hide them so well from her. She desperately asks John if he has any ideas, but he doesn't. And he doesn't want the shirt, either.
“Yeah, but then you would lose your super hearing skills and no longer be the world's best consulting detective.”
He eyes me intently, his gaze flickering down to my hands once. He doesn't speak, which is maddening. I want to ask him what he sees when he looks at me like that.
Sherlock's arm, stretched at the beginning of some grand gesture, falls to his side. “What do you mean?” he frowns.
He strokes her hand with his forefinger. Her fingers close around his in her sleep. Seeing the two of them together is the most beautiful thing I know.
“Perhaps not”, Moriarty said, leaning back in his chair. “But we will make it regardless.” He lowered his head, looking dangerously from under his lashes. “Or have you forgotten I am the one holding the deeds to the Moulin Rouge?”
Sherlock squirms on the sofa; the leather makes his back sweaty. “Deserving it will not make it happen.”
His pelvis was still moving, small, rhythmic thrusts that he didn't even seem aware of making. He was making tiny sounds into my mouth, words trying to break loose, stifled before I could more than guess what they might be.
I was thinking, maybe we could do the same thing. If you let me in we can sit in the kitchen and just write to each other on here. Would you think that's silly? I hope not.
When the silence was growing uncomfortable, there were hard steps on the floor, and Holmes appeared from one of the shadowed alcoves.
The room is bare; the sofa is gone, as is the large rug and all her plants. There is a very noticeable absence of the Christmas tree that took up a third of this room last time he was here, and one wall is covered with scratch marks.
He nods, averting his gaze back to her. His hand strokes through her thick hair. I watch his face as he carefully chooses his words.
is important to me.” Every trace of a smile was gone from his face, and I recognised the hard and arrogant man from the stairwell after the party that first night. “I told you before; all I care about is the work. Music, art, acting. It is the only thing that lights a spark in this dull existence.”
My typewriter shines in the moonlight. I push slowly at the line space lever. The carriage rattles when it slides to the right. The space within the type guide is empty, white and vast, and I need to fill it. I need to say it, if there are ever going to be any words following these. It is the one thing I do not want to tell, and the one thing that I have to.
“It will have to be a contrast between innocent and provocative – boyish hair, coy manners, and then the black suspender belt, the lace stockings, and the long negligee. A blushing bride”, he said ironically, then considered. “In black.”
But when the city was swept up in the sharp air and colours of autumn, and when darkness conquered the sky and seeped into the alleys of Montmartre, electric lights began to glow. The windmill was bestrewn with red light bulbs, the blades glowed and turned into a hypnotic advert, the Moulin Rouge started its pulsing beats and beckoned every pedestrian to come in and play.
Moriarty walked aimlessly through the room. Sherlock moved in counterpoint with him, always keeping as much distance as he possibly could, never taking his eyes off Moriarty. His body was screaming with the need for Moriarty to leave, but Moriarty only kept talking as if he had all the time in the world.
Again, it's too quiet around them. Sherlock curses under his breath when he realises what he's forgotten.
I haven't told them about my strange visitor last Sunday. I don't know what to say about it. It's a good thing no one noticed; no one in my house heard Holm William entering my room, and they didn't hear us talking all night. Greger did notice me falling asleep while carving out the scroll of a fiddle the following Monday, but he just had a laugh about it and let it go.
I have kept the place meticulously clean. John is quite awe-struck when he steps into the flat. I am used to him making this face because of something I did, but the reason has always been my genius. Usually he compliments me by calling me
His hands are on Sherlock’s backside and Sherlock is going insane. He distantly hears himself whining, feels his spine arch and the back of his head dig into the mattress, messing up his hair.
He studies their hands intently. The size difference is oddly captivating. John's fingers are quite short in proportion to his palm, his ring finger is longer than his index finger, and his little finger is crooked. His long finger ends almost at Sherlock's first knuckle; Sherlock could bend his finger in a sort of embrace of John's.
He has barely finished the last word before regret floods him like ice water. He's already asked Tori. He can't stand having the two of them in the same room; even when they're being civil his skin crawls with the need to separate them. He doesn't know who he should be when both of them are there.
The corners of Sherlock's mouth twitch downwards when he eyes the cookie between John's fingers, the same way he would an enemy. He waves his pale hand condescendingly and takes an ominous breath. “The business of fortune telling capitalises on taking advantage of people's feelings of confusion and desperation”, he starts, throwing himself into an analysis of the stupidity of fortune predictions. John watches him with amusement, enjoying the look of concentration on Sherlock's face even when he is talking nonsense.
Stopping him felt like getting in the way of a hurricane, but as a soldier I was taught how to ignore the reckless nature of my actions in high-pressure situations. I shot out a hand to grasp his elbow when he blew past me.
“That for him, by any chance?” I asked her. She winked at me, and I laughed. “I'm glad. He never eats with us. Good to know that someone is making sure he eats at all.”
At the same time I feel hollow. I walk around, work, eat, talk to people, laugh, and it just echoes inside me.
Sherlock lay on the mattress, exposed in only corset and stockings, head turned away and eyes screwed shut.
Sherlock barely registers entering 221B and climbing the stairs. He is aware of sitting on a kitchen chair and unbuttoning his shirt with numb fingers, and John being all Doctor Watson with him. Steady hands care for his wounds. Sherlock closes his eyes and makes himself notice, for the first time in days, that he is breathing.
“I’m sorry”, John says. “I just don’t want to make any promises I’m not absolutely sure I can keep. The last thing I want to do is break your heart.”
We made it. The audience was whistling, stomping and cheering. Holmes appeared behind the curtain with the closest thing to a real smile I've ever seen on his face.
He blushed faintly, opening his mouth a few times. I smiled at him in encouragement, but in the end he only left without another word. There was something adorable in the way he fumbled for ways to agitate me, only to be completely disarmed by a simple, friendly smile.
Sherlock pulled one hand out of her grasp to grab a handkerchief. He coughed violently into it. When he lowered it to his lap, they both stared at the red spot on the white cotton.
John puts his nose in the tumult of Sherlock's hair, breathing quietly. He can feel Sherlock's heart beating against his hand, and his own heart beating against Sherlock's back. At once, every trace of awkwardness and worry leaves him. Sherlock in his arms is all that matters, and he isn't about to throw away a night they both badly want, for some irrational feelings of guilt.
“Oh, shut up, you git.” The response comes automatically, breaking free from a tight space in John's chest. He waits for Sherlock to open his eyes, then lifts his hand to Sherlock's cheek. “Idiot”, he smiles, letting all his love fill the word, just as it always has.
Wordlessly, I dumped the sheets of paper in his lap and sat down beside him. I got lost in the hypnotic turn of the windmill blades while Stamford read through my script. The lights were out at the Moulin Rouge, but the blades kept turning, reminding us that the mill was alive though it was asleep.
John blinks, trapped between Sherlock's words, voiced as if completely self-evident, and Sherlock's gloved hand gripping John's securely. The leather is smooth and cool, quickly warming beneath John's palm. Sherlock's face turns impatient, and John tries to shake himself and look at the curtain. Sherlock speaks coherently now, gesturing with his free hand to explain his observations, and John tries to play his part and ask questions and not think about the firm grip of Sherlock's hand.
All there was were my own panting breaths echoing from the stone walls. The ticking seconds were deafening inside my head.
Everyone was singing. Sherlock and Molly stood before each other, arms stretched out, voices gleaming above the orchestra: “
Holmes inclined his head, leaning forward in his chair. “A considerable sum, yes. We are quite grateful-”
I've never seen anyone look so beautiful in my entire life. I want to feel his wet hair in my fist. I want to taste the sweet freshwater on his skin.
“Um, yeah”, John says, rubbing his neck and failing miserably to hide his smile. “Yeah, you just sort of threw it away.”
“What are you thinking about?” I ask and give in to the impulse to tap his forehead with two fingers.
I make a show of eyeing the hat and gesturing to Ida to lift it even higher. The crowd loves it, of course. When it comes to this one, you have to understand that the anticipation of the trick is half the show. You have to build it up. It's even better when I know some of them doubt I'll manage it at all, given my height. Oh, they are in for a surprise.
“John, it's just me”, he says. “Do you see? Our definitions, our identities, our inexperience – none of it matters. Don't think about all of that, just… think about me.”
He took my hand gently and led me to the bed, carefully undressing me before helping me down. I couldn't see his face as I lay on the mattress, only the silhouette of his curls and his slender shoulder against the window.
Even when John doesn't miss the way Sherlock now sleeps every night, slotting his bedtime routine into John's.
A cane clattering to the floor, a lean body pressed up against me. Fingers tingling to reach out and touch, daring escapes, him leading, me following. Reckless giggles.
She is five weeks old and has finally reached the size of an average newborn baby. People who do not see her every day comment on how small she is; to me she is positively gigantic at this point. The changes she has gone through since birth are staggering.
He pops a raspberry caramel into his mouth and lies back down. I watch as he thoughtfully sucks on it, his cheeks hollowing. It makes his cheekbones even sharper. The buzzing tension that so often arises between us is back; it seems to be urging me to reach out and touch him.
I licked my lips in a moment of indecision. “Damn it”, I murmured, and hurried back across the courtyard.
It looked even more wonderful now that Sherlock knew for a fact how soft it was. Did he? He did. The events of this morning were something of a blur, but of this he was certain. In fact, when he thought about it, John's mouth had been surprising in its softness.
Last chapter finished already! Thank you for reading and leaving comments and kudos - you people are so lovely. Another super soft fic is coming soon!
The fifteenth year, John turns fifty. Sherlock is nervous about what he is supposed to do to celebrate it, and in the end he overdoes it completely. He wakes John with breakfast in bed at six AM, leaving John to eat it alone while Sherlock gets Rosie ready for school, then comes back for fifteen minutes of morning sex. John tries to cuddle with him afterwards, but Sherlock announces that they have a strict schedule. There is a violin composition, a meticulously cleaned flat, chocolates spread out over every surface of it, a whole set of new shirts, some jewellery, a scavenger hunt, a picnic in the park, a visit at the cinema, a dinner at London's most expensive restaurant, and a surprise party that John doesn't realise is a surprise party until weeks afterwards, because the guest list was pretty thin, and John is never too surprised to have Mrs Hudson and Lestrade visit their flat. When he stumbles into the bedroom at midnight and sees the rose petals spread out over the bed, he tells Sherlock that he really has to sleep now. Sherlock gratefully falls asleep in his arms.
The movement of Sherlock's lips is careful and tentative, and his jagged breathing is reverent through his nose. John's pulse rate has increased so quickly that he's dizzy. The
The transformation of John's features happens in a split second and is the purest thing I have ever witnessed. He almost jerks, eyes coming alive with a crystal clear moment of joy, lips forming a silent
A long supper table in a cold room, a suited man on one end, a man with naked shoulders on the other. A mile of exotic food between them, champagne cooling in an ice-bucket, silverware reflecting on the blank surface of the table.
I shudder to think what would have become of me, had I not heard someone call my name when I crossed the park one morning in the early summer. Or had I followed my first instinct and walked on, pretending to be someone who didn't answer to the name John Watson. But at the second call, I did turn, and found Michael Stamford standing behind me. The surprise of seeing him in London lowered my guard enough for me to feel actual joy, and I agreed to have dinner with him.
He might as well be a million miles away. It's unfair how someone who is so far out of reach can at the same time be so close that every detail of him makes John ache. He can't stand Sherlock's smooth cheeks, his straight nose and his warm lips being more than a few inches from his own face. He barely remembers what it's like to run his fingers through those beautiful curls. The yearning for it makes him wish to look away, but he has nowhere to look.
You smiled at me, I don't know if you knew. I would have cried at that if it wasn't for the remaining adrenalin, because I haven't seen your smile since before you died.
My mouth never closed, jaw stupidly slack when I accepted the cane from him. I shifted on my feet, for a moment forgetting which leg it was that usually didn't hold my weight.
“Right. Sorry”, I murmured, clumsily helping him get me properly dressed. A tiny smile tugged on one corner of his lips. I didn't dare kiss it.
They stay silent until they are seated in the car, John by the wheel and Sherlock staring out the windscreen. He waits for John to start the engine, but it doesn't happen. Instead a warm palm lands on his thigh.
He said it off-handedly, as if it were the most simple truth of the universe. I stared at him incredulously.
When the sunlight was sharper and the sound of the city no longer awkward and clumsy after sleep, Stamford stopped playing.
After our fourth dance together, she looks up into my eyes. The moment stretches and has suddenly gone on for too long, and red spots appear on her cheeks.
Every time Sherlock and I looked at each other, some quiet understanding seemed to pass between us. It was ironic, as I didn't understand it at all. Sherlock looked annoyed when we shared one of those looks; his lips pressed together, he set his jaw and fired an insult that made me snort. Then he would storm off, not joining the rest of us for the coffee break. Typical.
As he treads the steps, he is acutely aware of John behind him. He wonders whether John is looking, then dismisses the thought; of
John squares his shoulders and stares at him icily. A wary glint in Sherlock's eyes shines through his arrogance. “I am going to leave this flat”, John says calmly, suppressed rage jarring the edges of his voice. “And when I come back, the furniture will be back in place, the floors will be clean, the rubbish will be taken out, and the food will be in the fridge. Understood?”

But Molly's lip had an unhappy crease. “It's not that I doubt you, John, but… I'm sorry, but have you ever written anything like this before? It's just, Holmes will never agree.”
Harry's flat is too bright and too loud, the ceiling too high and the glasses too full. Harry's eyes are too wide and all the smiles are too fixed, Tori laughs too much and John breathes too little. His skin crawls, the row with Harry flares and passes, and he barely makes it until he can pull Tori away from the others and go numb between her legs.
He had barely said a word to me since rehearsals started. And when he did, the words were cuttingly cold. Most of the time he ignored me so completely that I might as well have been air, not even a shadow in his peripheral vision. Sometimes, I had the fleeting feeling of someone watching me, but when I turned around Sherlock's face was a stone statue, never turned to me.
When he finally closes the front door behind him and locks it, he takes off his shoes and jacket as quietly as he can not to wake anyone. He doesn't get farther than the darkened bathroom before his hand falls to his belt.
My brain was effectively wiped clean, but my hand shot out on instinct, grabbing his hand. To my surprise, he actually turned back around. He didn't smile any more. He looked young, eyeing me with quiet vigilance.
As I look across the dance floor, I catch William eyeing my moves while he's dancing. I throw him a smile as well while I'm at it and playfully copy the kicks he's currently doing. An answering smile tugs on his lips at the same time as someone hoots from the audience. My smile grows. I think I've won them over.
Something about the contrast between the panicked, pink-feathered escape and the calm, confident stroll, made my guts stir with unease. But I lost sight of the man when the music suddenly silenced, the lights dimmed, and a rain of silver confetti fell over us in quiet grace.
The first kiss, we fell into. His upper lip passed by my open mouth, and I nipped at it, suddenly finding myself with the tip of his tongue past the seam of my lips. I was suddenly too hot, our mouths opening lazily and without restraint, inviting each other deeper, deeper.
“So that is your plan, then?” Holmes almost smiled, as if in curious inquiry, but his condescending eyes destroyed the display. “You are going to take off right before the opening night? Throw away everything we have worked for, you and I, our whole lives.”
I sat on my bed and watched the stormy day elapse outside my window. The time for the show's opening came and passed.
Sherlock gave up on the clothes and raised a handkerchief to his mouth. He coughed into the stained fabric, his thumb already smeared with blood from his last attack. He could barely hold himself upright from the force of the cough while Martha tied the last corset closed.
“I know. But we simply cannot know beforehand whether the experiment will be a failure. And it’s too late to back down now. Isn’t it?”
On cue, Holmes' gaze swept over Sherlock's face and the slight swelling on his left cheek. Sherlock's spine straightened in grim satisfaction. Holmes looked away.
Slipping the braces back onto my shoulder, I took a step back. The space between us could be felt like a physical thing, and I could almost see him eye it.
John is silent for a while. “I don’t know”, he finally says. Sherlock turns his head on the bed to look at him. “That’s what I’m thinking about.”
I put my hands on his waist, sliding them under the open coat and pulling him in. Through two cotton shirts, I could feel the warmth and solidity of his chest against me. Of their own accord, my hands found their way to the spaces where they fit so well; his shoulder blades, the nape of his neck, the dip of his spine. His body was so familiar at this point, so
John accidentally takes a sip from the tea that's gone cold long ago. This isn't how he wanted to spend their anniversary.
William lies on top of the blankets with his arms folded beneath his head. The buttons of his white shirt strain on top of his chest. I lie on my side and pretend not to study them.
His silk stockings were so soft, I couldn't resist putting my cheek to his inner thigh to feel them. His hips arched upward a bit and his breath stuttered. Encouraged, I put my mouth against the thin fabric, breathing into it. He made a breathy sound above me. By the time I had gotten his shoes off, my face was at the hem of his skirt and his breath came in short gasps. I massaged his soft, stocking-clad feet while I tilted my face forward, the bridge of my nose bumping the lowest button of his dress, and I inhaled deeply. The scent of his hidden arousal made my head foggy and we moaned at the same time.
Sherlock swallowed and blinked hard, but otherwise didn't let his face betray anything. “I have no choice.”
He sinks down into his chair opposite mine, a cup of tea in hand. He looks entirely at ease; as if nothing has changed over the past week. As if nothing has happened when in fact everything has. If I didn't know better I'd have thought the news had failed to reach him.
That meagre body, just barely containing its breakable heart, sleeping on dirty cobblestones, safe for only as long as Mycroft could ensure it. Every time he disappeared, every time he came back, every time he danced confidently and every time he smiled insecurely, Mycroft's ribcage threatened to crack right open. He could never keep up, he could never understand, he could never do enough. How do you protect something that is too good for this world?
I can't tell you how I knew. But every hair on my back was standing at attention at the presence of a silent body, and when I felt a hot exhalation graze my neck, the presence was confirmed. It made me strangely calm; where other people tremble in the face of excitement, thrill and threat, I become rock-steady.
“I suppose that’s better than shooting it”, John comments and goes back to his reading. Sherlock huffs and stomps back to the couch to finish his task.
He didn't. He regained his composure rapidly, raising his chin defiantly. But I could see his chest rising and falling fast. When I advanced into the room, he nearly backed into the mirror as though terrified that I would touch him.
He watched the lights of London beneath us. I had watched his face shift on our way from the morgue to the roof, starting with something oddly, shyly hopeful and changing to pale dread. I wasn't sure who would need to comfort whom, but standing before the little door leading to the roof, he was the wrecked one.
He sang through the crowd, playfully scattering touches and air-kisses around him wherever he went, and I could finally see him properly. He moved with flawless grace, in control of every single atom in his body, an entire lack of self-consciousness despite his state of undress. His hipbones caught my eye and held it, visible above the low waistband of his shorts, the V disappearing enticingly under the spangle. His hairless legs virtually never ended, and when he moved them, the tight fabric of the shorts hugged his backside in a way that elicited a little moan back in my throat. The top hat looked wrong combined with his nearly naked appearance, his dark hair hidden under it.
John tells Sherlock about the lost man with the cane, and his stupendous misconception that his life was over, and how surprised he is to discover how much time of pure
It suddenly dawns on him that he could well be dreaming. Yes, that makes more sense than John actually wanting Sherlock in his bed; it makes more sense than anything feeling as good as John’s hands on him do.
It felt almost unbearably good; his lush mouth sliding around me, the velvety skin of Sherlock on my tongue, the proof of his desire hot and hard. I couldn't stop moaning around him, and I had to let go to gasp for air when he gently suckled at me. I forced myself to dive back in, seized with a need to take him with me.
I smiled and tried to look kind. “I'm sorry”, I said, just when Sherlock managed to duck out of the brunette's grasp. He headed for the door, and I left Mary and followed him.
are going to learn your lines and listen to Stamford's directions. And in the break, you are going to eat something.”
Sherlock's face is just a few inches away in the half-dark stairwell, and he meets John's gaze intently. “John”, he says, his voice deep and quiet, yet loud in their intimate bubble. “I am quite all right.”
There is a love that defies everything. There is a love without laws, and a love without limits. There is a love that knows no borders, not even those of time, of life and death. There is a love that will live forever.
I snort, mostly because I wonder how William manages to make even words like that sound alluring. “Either that, or you're just a coward.”
That invisible halo around him, the one that appeared after our first kiss, has become more solid. I can see now that it wasn't the kisses that did it. No, it's because of what he is to me that he bathes in a subdued light only I can see. It's because he is the one I have chosen.
The whole day went by and Sherlock didn't look at me once. I never saw him speak to Moriarty, I didn't even see them touch. But the fact that he never left the duke's side made it quite clear where he belonged.
I whimpered, the sound sudden and shockingly high in our quiet bubble of darkness. Then the tip of his tongue took a careful taste of me, and I did it again.
The chances of that happening this year seem more slim with every passing minute. When Sherlock has a project on, he can zone out completely for days. It happens when he’s on a case, of course, but then he communicates more; when it’s an experiment, he simply disappears into his own world. He’s barely slept at all for the last few days; and when he did, he shot out of bed as soon as he woke and picked up where he left off. It usually ends with a day of lying on the couch just like this, filing the results in his mind palace.
I couldn't see what they were doing, but I heard the rustle of fabric and Sherlock's loud breathing. Just when I started to wonder if he had managed to distract Moriarty enough for me to take a chance at escaping, Moriarty took a step back.
She stared back at me for a second as if daring me to say something, but then changed her mind and averted her eyes. She hurried out of the hall without a word.
Sherlock pauses by the bed and removes his clothes, everything but his underpants. John grins sleepily. It occurs to Sherlock that he should feel self-conscious about stripping like this in front of someone else – especially his best friend – especially someone he has not yet had sex with (although that one is debatable). He would have, were it anyone else.
“John” – it's a breeze ghosting through the hair on John's crown. The sound doesn't travel farther than John's ears.
Stamford was standing by the far wall with hands folded behind his back, examining all the sheets of paper that I had pinned there since his last visit.
The first spin I go into leaves me a little dizzy; for a moment I forget to keep track of where William is in the room. I am brutally reminded of it when I drop into a crouch and feel the gust of air from his foot, kicking the air right above my head.
Moriarty looked after him, then slowly turned to me. His face didn't give anything away; a blank, dark mask, a dead stare.
Violent breathing, slick sweat, humid scent of skin. Things of secrecy that should be concealed within a bedroom.
John's radius bones dig into Sherlock's throat. Sherlock's arms are big enough to be everywhere, a blanket around John's trembling body.
“Uh-huh.” John sits down in his chair, rests his chin on the fingers of his right hand and watches Sherlock carefully eye the socks one by one. “I’d take you for the type of person to buy all your socks from the same poncy place, though. Then they’d all be the same.”
Sherlock lets him go with a gasp. John looks down at him, at his black eyes and his swollen, slack lips. John can't tear his eyes away, and he involuntarily raises his hips, seeking contact. Sherlock closes his eyes and takes him again, sucking as if he can't function if he doesn't.
Sherlock is dizzy. Short of breath. Is it supposed to be this difficult to breathe? Breathing should occur automatically, shouldn't it? Sherlock has to consciously make the air pass in and out through his nose, and it steals precious attention from the feel of John's slick tongue inside his mouth.
Moran quickly jumped to the side, hiding from the audience behind the back wall. Sherlock and I, however, were framed by the golden stage doors at the very top of the stage. We were frozen in place, Sherlock on his knees and me bent over him, hands grasping each other. A gasping sob broke loose from Sherlock's lungs as an afterthought.
I am no musician. I can't compose, and my voice isn't trained to sing. Not that I never do – in Afghanistan, when I was working all night, all alone with far too many patients, then I would sing. Quietly, simply, just to fill the silence with something that maybe, hopefully, could comfort someone who woke up when they wished they hadn't. In any case, I did sometimes comfort myself with the familiar sound of my own voice in my head – a reminder that I was alive, and who I was.
I trapped his hand against my chest, closed my eyes and leaned forward until I felt his forehead meeting mine.
“You need me.” Moriarty's words grazed Sherlock's shoulder and made his skin prickle. “Or you're nothing.” Sherlock stifled a cough, masking it as a gasp. “We're just alike, you and I. Have you worked it out yet?”
is running around here all the time” – he gestures at Tori with his chin, not even looking in her direction – “did you promptly have to invite
He threw a new door open, and I was halfway through the room before I realised it wasn't empty. On the floor stood Irene, clad in black lace and holding a riding crop, and on the bed lay a man, naked and tied to the headboard. He stared at Sherlock and me, and I stared at Sherlock too, because that seemed like the safest place to look for the time being.
“Clearly, you're an English army doctor recently invalided home from service. Your left arm has been injured and you have a psychosomatic limp – or perhaps I should say
The rooms of his mind palace are illuminated by an unseen source of light. The air has a luminous quality; the hues hint at gold rather than the common grey. The dark corners seem to have soaked up the glow of John's skin, infusing it into the very foundation of the construction.
Sherlock looked up again, his eyes at once young and a hundred years old, his lips shakily parting around a silent breath.
Thank you for reading (and listening)! My beta and I have had a blast with this, and I hope you did too. If you have any questions about the Swedish folk culture, don't be shy to ask! Take care and stay safe!
We don't talk about it, but I don't think he minds. I don't know if I mind, by the way. It's painful, being with him. Sometimes I have to leave in order to keep myself from hurting him, when the anger flares up.
I wish I had a mind palace to commit his face to memory. This was the last time I saw him like that. My own Sherlock, warm and damp with sweat, tired breaths pumping through his lungs. Even when every bit of emotion is cried out of me, there's a solid, shining fact settled in my whole body. I love him. I love him so much, I love him.
“Holmes.” The owner turned to find Moriarty standing behind him on the former dance floor, his mouth a grim line.
John drives but leaves his hand on Sherlock's thigh. Now and again he idly caresses Sherlock's leg, and Sherlock shivers. He had forgotten how good it feels to sit in the front seat beside John as his husband, and have John's steady hands drift towards him whenever they get the chance. It makes him feel treasured. As if it's somehow important for John to have Sherlock beside him wherever he's going.
He spends time at her flat, and it's buzz and lewd and ecstasy. He feels virile, sexy, he's surfing on hormones that smudge out everything but freckled skin and what he can dream up doing to it. The sex keeps getting better, and the talking isn't too bad either. Even her cat isn't the worst thing in the world; he wasn't overjoyed to learn she had one, but this one does little else than lie around sleeping.
“Well. This will be an extravagant show. Musical numbers with dozens of dancers, bright colours, the most talented singers of the Moulin Rouge. Sherlock here will play the Hindu Dancer, and Molly Hooper will play the Penniless Sitar-Player. Their duets will be heartbreaking, their love story will be very touching, and in between there will be spectacular cancan scenes.”
“I don't dance with the girls”, is all he says, crossing his arms and looking out over the dance floor.
Electric light bulbs. Red velvet. Then: explosion of rainbows. The whole spectrum of light mingling in skirts twirling across the vast dance floor.
I found his pulse. I let his hand rest there, half on my face, and let the tides of his blood drum against my lips. Steady, unwavering, like nothing on earth could stop it. I know, of course, that that isn't true. But it was good enough to let me fall back asleep and be spared any more dreams.
When John came out just now, Sherlock imagined his taste in men; broad, muscular, blond. (Sounds more like
When the soldier spots him he jogs over to greet him. “Doctor John Watson”, he says as he closes his fist around Sherlock's. He gives one firm shake, watching Sherlock expectantly. Sherlock makes an embarrassing pause before getting out:
It's not forbidden to find someone new when your spouse dies. But it doesn't change the fact that you're married to that person. You carry them with you. You move on, you love again if you're lucky. But you never divorce that first person.
He's not sure Sherlock cares, or if he knows. John's guts twist when he debates with himself; they aren't like that any more. They were never meant to have it anyway.
He looked back at me for a long moment. He didn't speak. But his eyes were slowly becoming wet, filled with bottomless sadness. In that moment, his face was open again, as if letting me pour into him so he could save as much as possible of me, before he turned away.
This is the only thing making it remotely acceptable that Sherlock is such a reckless idiot; that John knows how to take care of him after. Sherlock doesn't let anyone else do it, and sometimes John isn't sure
Holmes' mouth had turned into a thin line, making Sherlock's stomach roll with nausea at the confirmation that he was right.
(one of my personal favourite moments in the movie, and my favourite lyrics for sure), and the film score pieces
His delicate hands move over his microscope. His curls are boyishly untamed. His smooth cheekbone begs to be kissed.
He breaks away from the kiss, glancing around them. They have the seats farthest back in the bus, and there is no one near them – perks of having a husband who intimidates everyone. The bus is big and relatively empty, with the nearest people four seats ahead. They could easily turn their heads, though, and get a good look at the newly-weds in the back.
Her head is cradled in my left hand and her bum fits in the palm of my right. I carefully slide my arms beneath her delicate body, letting her rest on my forearms. Staring at her face and infinitely careful about where I set my feet, I make for the exit of the empty building.
I turned around, still with that stupid smile on my face. Sherlock stood unsteadily on the stage floor, head tipped back, mouth gaping. His gasp was sharp enough to slice through my skin.
These questions shake me. I am unfocused for the rest of the afternoon, barely noticing the departure of John's friends, all my senses blurry until we are in a cab on our way back home. I am grateful for the dark. The hum of the engine grounds me. In the companionable silence I rest my hand on the feathery back of her head and close my eyes.
Sherlock grunts and flops onto his side, facing the back of the sofa, before John can see the mortification on his face.
Moriarty ignored him, taking the opposite chair. Holmes held himself impassive as he himself sat down in the discarded chair.
Yeah, they must've known. Wish I could remember their faces but they're all blank, I don't know who they were.
“Sherlock, stop it!” John gasps from the ground when he flies up into the air, the long swing ropes stretched out almost horizontally behind him. Sherlock ignores him, but John shouts again, and finally Sherlock lets the swing slow. He rolls his eyes when he knows John can see it properly.
“Of course not”, he scoffed. “All that matters to me is the work. If I don't stay focused, I will never be anything more than a whore on the streets. I care about music and acting, I care about learning and perfecting, thinking and calculating; caring about
me, Sherlock had made me real. He had made John Watson into something that made sense to me, and the foggy lines of my tired, young body were turned crystal clear. For the first time since the war, I could trust that something I did might matter, one way or another.
The sound of his voice made me relax. It was like a sigh of relief, my body thanking me for finally being in the same room as Sherlock. There were his curls, and the outline of his chest visible through his shirt, and his high cheekbones and sparkling eyes – and everything was right with the world.
“But you could. I honestly believe you could.” I stepped forward, trying to close the distance he had created. “You could be so much, Sherlock. If you gave it time, I know-”
Climbing the stairs is shockingly uncomfortable. Sherlock has defeated these stairs drunk, drugged, and once with a fractured patella; he never would have imagined it would be so difficult to do the same while simply aroused.
It's impossible not to be pulled in by the music. I forget everything about introducing myself to a few people before I dance, instead leaving Mikael and Greger at the door to go straight to the bench along the wall. I hold out my hand to the first girl I see, barely having time to look her in the eye properly before she's next to me on the dance floor with her hand on my shoulder. I secure my arm around her waist and we flow effortlessly into the circle of dancing couples.
Mrs Hudson invited me for tea today. Well, us, but Sherlock couldn't take a break from his experiment so I went alone.
The earth blooms with an abundance that almost seems too much. The sun shines every day of July, making the days too hot for wearing shirts. I swim in the lake several times a day, and the water is so warm that you can stay in it for hours if you want to. Everything seems to blossom now, in every colour of the rainbow, and every day there are enough ripe strawberries in the garden to make a strawberry pastry.
“… I was nervous about being with a man, but it… it feels so great. You are so sexy, and your body is amazing, and I want nothing more than to just… just touch you… I want to see you come, Sherlock.”
It's easy to read between the lines in what William is saying. If he's so shocked at being accepted the way he is… I think I might just be the first person his age who's wanted to be with him. It's unfathomable.
He wasn't prepared. He flinched, and for a terrible, blessed second I felt grim satisfaction instead of agony. Stamford got up, grabbed his coat and left.
I kissed him to the sound of the rehearsal close by, made reckless and bold by the hormonal cocktail surging through my blood since our cupboard encounter.
When John comes back to the cafeteria, my coffee has just cooled enough that I dare drink it with her on my chest. He is in a good mood, optimistic about how well this outing is going. He offers to take over, which is of course a ridiculous idea when she is still sound asleep and snuffing happily in the baby carrier.
