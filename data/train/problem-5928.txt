“hmmm… I don’t know Steve, this is so sudden. I was going to go with my fake boyfriend” Tony said smiling as he get closer “but I think you are such a better option”
Steve take the rose and read the note attached to it -  who the hell you think you are hanging on me? - was written.
I think I'm going to writhe one last chapter as an epilogue. Thank you so much at all the people who read this sugar bomb,
“What? Tony?”
“Ouuu” Tony said as grimming his smile “and what? do you want to check on the competition? or you want to do the adult thing to wish me luck to look better than me?”
“I was wondering if you would like to go at the dance with me?”
Both of them started walking at the SHIELD quarters. The flowers of the spring started to bloom and the wind run pleasant for the Academy. They cross with Hulk and Hawkeye as they walk, Black Cat and Mary Jane smile at them and they feel the flash of a camera disappear.
“Tony?”
Steve turned to Tony. He felt warm and exposed, surely the genius could see his feelings. The eyes of Tony were looking at his lips and Steve couldn´t stop to move them.
I don't now why or how but the epilogue is more angsty than the fic. Really this end up like way more dramatic that I intended to be. But it is a happy ending, so enjoyed.
Maybe it could be true. Maybe he can had everything that he want.
“I’m with you, so it is already…”
He turned at the room when his classmates look at them with pity.
Laugh burst out of Tony.
“Can we” he asked.
“if I make you uncomfortable...”
“Tony?” Steve asked.
Tony saved his piece of teck and turned to his classmate. Steve usually just talked to him with a purpose, to Tony’s bad luck Steve wasn’t a man of small talk.
“I know, I know…”
“No, I’m just thinking” Steve said as he get close to Tony like telling him a secret “that maybe fight between us is not the best way to win, maybe we should collaborate instead”
Steve stopped by the Stark tower and saw Tony on the top of the building. The genius started the repulsors, flew out  and landed near to the door. His hair was messy for the flying and a big smile adorned his face. Steve felt the warm up on his fingers, Tony‘s hair looked warm and fuzzy maybe now he had permission to touch it and get close to him.
“No way!” Tony interrupted “You are Captain America, The Captain America, and you know… apart of handsome and brave as the publicity said, it turns out that the real you is super sweet, like diabetic sweet, I mean, your jacket?? really?? you give ME your jacket in our first day as boyfriends, how are we going to top that? you had to propose or something to even catch some attention tomorrow and we are at one week of the dance, we need to made a scandal every day...”
, Thor.’
Loki comments.
Peter winks at Wade then downs the bottle; the mercenary’s eyes go wide. When he finishes he wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and shrugs. ‘Never specified which half.’
Maria Rambeau?’
Tony doesn’t blink. ‘And what do you think this is going to achieve, Captain?’
‘I can’t imagine what he’s feeling right now,’ Steve shakes his head in sympathy.
‘You’ll miss more than half a year if you don’t get out of my city,’ the man says, the dark red suit almost blending him into the shadows around them.
‘What…what is this?’ the look of confusion on the ex-assassin’s face is priceless.
‘Well he did a lot with Peggy and, from what I’ve gathered since, Fury as well. His grandson is the Principal at Peter’s school.’
‘I promisssse,’ Venom nodded, and Peter found he trusted the creature.
times. Anything looks wrong? Anything
The trickster shakes his head. ‘No, that is going to be the first challenge.’
‘Ok… Sam.’
. Move.’
‘Ready?’
‘It’s not that I don’t trust him,’ Steve argues, ‘it’s just I’m not sure I
‘Don’t even go there,’ he huffs, then feels bad at taking out his frustration on yet another person who doesn’t deserve it. ‘Sorry Happy, just been a rough first day back.’
Thanos is indeed standing there, a golden gauntlet on his hand where four stones are currently nestled into their own slots.
‘You’ve got cancer?’ Peter asks.
‘This is borderline mutiny!’ the blond complains just as Tony walks through the door.
‘Your choice,’ he reminds her, settling into his own cocoon.
‘No. And he shot his target right through her. Hence the scar on her hip. When she realised he didn’t recognise her and he’d do that to her now…well she closed herself off, decided not to let anyone else get close.’
A/N: Hi everyone! Sorry it's a little later than normal this week, but I hope you enjoyed the opening clash of the Battle of Wakanda. I'm not going to lie, I took the opening of this chapter from a post I saw on the internet one time; I found it so funny I couldn't not include it here.
‘You know what? I don’t have to sit here and listen to you two. I’m going to listen to the kid’s report,’ he says, feigning hurt.
‘Of course I can. I’m sure Bucky could help you too, and I know Tony’s fluent in French and Italian as well. What did you want to start with?’
‘More than some,’ he laughs, ‘what we betting with?’
as well as the team. I’m trying to Spider-Man on the down-low remember?’
Tony rolls his eyes. ‘Are you going to tell me the truth?’
Steve blushes and he can’t help but feel intrigued. ‘Could I- I mean, would you mind if I stayed here?’
‘Damn it,’ Clint curses softly. Just then he hears the sound of Tony’s suit approaching. ‘Hang on Rhodey, Tony’s coming. Maybe his suit can help get you out of this.’ He turns, mouth already open to ask for the genius’ input when he realises his mistake: it’s not Tony’s suit it’s Rhodes’.
‘Nothing, I just want to drop my bags-’
‘And more importantly does not leave the team open to abuse from any one or more particular governments,’ T’Challa adds. ‘I will be presenting it to the UN, as a leader of a country who is growing concerned at the amount of control the US government is trying to exert over the team. How long before they start attempting to use the Avengers to further their own interests rather than the interests of the world?’
Loki smiles at him. ‘I shall bear that in mind.’ As they leave the room Loki places a hand on Bucky’s arm to stop him. ‘Thank you. I’d appreciate it if you didn’t tell Thor about my worries. I don’t want him to worry or to try too hard, he deserves to enjoy this.’
Natasha scowls as she takes off her sunglasses. ‘You really need to work on your undercover skills,’ she grumbles, taking the offered seat on the bench next to him.
‘Err… what did I miss?’ Tony asks. Steve briefly explains, still caught somewhere between exasperation and amusement.
‘I should have pushed her more before this,’ Tony sighs, rubbing his temples with one hand. ‘If she’d had more experience of how much power she has she may not have lost control like this.’
‘But it was my fault too,’ Steve’s frown deepens.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘It’s not?’
‘We so need to get you to do that when you’re better. That would be so cool!’
‘Getting ready for Christmas should not create so much mess,’ Steve counters.
‘Can you teach me how to do that?’ Nathaniel asks.
‘Love you, too,’ he replies.
‘No,’ he sighs in response, and presses a quick kiss to Tony’s lips, ‘but I’m going to anyway.’
‘How are you staying on?’ Sam demands, and Bucky sees him fly down near the youngster but can’t get closer because of its thrashing.
‘Hey it’s Stark Industries that pays for all your needs at the facility I’ll have you know. Which means
Bucky smiles and ruffles his hair. ‘That’s why we’re going to work on it. I can take a lot of what you can throw at me, Pete, trust me I’ve faced people stronger than me before in a training arena. Now come on, let’s get to work.’
‘Shit!’
A pained groan comes through and they all breathe a sigh of relief. ‘I’m alright. Damn that came out of nowhere.’
‘Depends on if the kid is going to insist we watch every film tonight,’ Steve chuckles.
‘And you don’t want him to find out you’re Spider-Man?’ Rhodes guesses.
‘He makes a very sound argument,’ Strange points out, ‘why not start it after midnight? That way everyone can join in the rest of the party before. It’s only a few hours.’
‘What was the prince like?’ she asks.
‘Nope,’ he shakes his head as they work on the lights. ‘None of the rest of us had the mistletoe tradition that Rhodes’ family does either, we just started combining everyone’s traditions.’
‘I didn’t realise he’d been working himself that hard,’ Sam mutters, swirling the last bit of his whiskey around the glass, frowning at it.
‘How about this: when I first met you, back when I asked you to come help in Germany, you said you couldn’t come because you had homework,’ Tony finishes and takes another step towards him. ‘Or how about that I still have a piece of the brickwork from the building Vulture dropped on you to remind me why I don’t ever have to doubt you again?’ Tears blur Peter’s vision as Tony takes another step towards him. ‘Or that when you found out I’d made your override code “Baby Genius 2-0-0-4” you moaned for two weeks and tried to convince me to change it.’ Another step closer and Peter can feel his whole body trembling. He’s just over an arm’s reach away, but Peter still can’t bring himself to trust this is real. ‘Or that you recorded a message right before you jumped off the bridge when Venom had hold of you? But I deleted it before anyone else could listen.’
‘Natasha?’
Peter grumbles to himself as he walks down the stairs, pulling his mask down over his face as he does. Dinner is nearly ready and he’s starving after training earlier.
She rolls her eyes. ‘Oh come on! Anyone tries to take him out I’ll stop them. He’ll be fine.’
‘How the hell would we know?’ Tony demands.
‘I’m not a damn messenger pigeon tell him yourself!’ Bucky throws a sponge over the counter and it hits Sam on the back of the head.
Peter gets changed in record time and is back in the common area as the rest of the team are finishing bringing out all of the food.
'Boss there's an incoming video call for you, would you like me to put it through?' FRIDAY says.
I’m leaning against this particular bit of wall,’ he teases her.
Thank you to everyone who has commented over the week, I think there's still a couple I need to respond to so I'll do that as soon as I've finished updating. Please do let me know what you think about this chapter - I found Peter and Shuri's meeting a bit of a tricky one so I'd be interested to know what you thought.
‘FRIDAY where’s Ross?’
‘Even if you don’t choose to stay you can still drop in.’
He sees the hope starting to shine in the soldier’s eyes and sighs. ‘Alright,’ he nods. ‘But I warn you I’m going to be crap at this.’ The smile that lights up the blond’s face makes Tony feel that maybe sucking in his pride might be worth it. ‘First, though, I’ve got a date with the Council, and if I don’t leave soon then I’m not going to around long enough for this wonderful intervention to start.’ He manages to dart around Steve, screwing the lid of his thermos shut and heading for the door. ‘I’ll see you guys later. This time I should be more prepared for my team ambushing me.’
‘My own entertainment, obviously.’
‘He told me too,’ he says, voice getting sulky.
‘I’m a merc, baby boy,’ Deadpool explains. ‘I’m used to getting called into fucked up situations. What if I said I’d give you my contact, then if you’re up shit creek like that again, I’ll come kick the bastards’ ass?’
‘I really don’t get what Pete sees in that guy,’ Natasha sighs.
‘Point taken.’
As they round the back of the facility the sound of a fight reaches their ears. ‘What do you thinks going on?’ Sam asks as they speed up.
‘How about you all clean your own rooms?’ Tony suggests. ‘Or are you prepared for Wade potentially going through your unmentionables, Widow?’
‘Yes, Colonel Killjoy,’ Bucky rolls his eyes. ‘We promise not to misbehave, now put the kiddie reins away.’
‘Alright everyone,’ Tony says, clapping his hands together and grinning at the gathered group, ‘the mistletoe challenge is about to start! Rules are: you have to catch as many people by surprise under the mistletoe as you can before this time tomorrow. The one who has managed to catch the most people wins.’
‘With good reason,’ Rhodes mutters.
‘Is that?’ she whispers.
Loki gives a mirthless laugh. ‘The Casket of Ancient Winters was destroyed with Asgard, so unfortunately no.’ He sighs. ‘Having spent some time in my Jotun form, however, it is now easier for me to see where my Asgardian visage ends and my Jotun one begins so I am hoping it will be easier for me to change between them.’
‘Kid you there?’ Tony asks.
(See the end of the chapter for
The Black Widow is leaning against the doorframe with her arms folded, smirking at him. ‘I’m your ride this week, Pete. Tony got caught up in a meeting with the Council, and since Steve was in there with him and no one trusted Bucky to not make your life hell I volunteered.’
‘You seriously telling me
Peter laughs and thanks him. ‘Can I play some pool while I wait?’
‘I think they might,’ Peter interrupts, his voice quiet. He’s trying to remember something he read in Strange’s library. ‘We might want to ask Doctor Strange, but I seem to remember something in a book in his library about a multi-verse. How there are infinite versions of us out there all created from different choices we made. Like, remember how he looked at all of those futures before the Battle of Wakanda?’
‘Uh, Doc? I think Natasha’s here,’ he tells the sorcerer.
than I should have gone,’ Peter hisses back. ‘I’m supposed to struggle to do ten sit ups!’
‘Alright, I
‘I’m sorry,’ Peter looks down again. ‘I just…sometimes I feel like there’s two people inside of me right now, and one of them just wants to use these abilities I have to take out anything I face.
-What do you think?- Loki snaps back. –Do try and remember, Barnes, these are the people that abandoned me as a child and then I tried to destroy. If they are coming to Earth they are not going to be joining my fan club.-
‘Pete, you know Beck’s not going to be-’
stronger than Steve, despite what he might say, so I was going to ask you to train with him soon anyway.’
‘It’s alright, sir,’ Peter says, ‘I don’t mind at all. It’s what I’m here for: being helpful.’
‘Oh yeah I forgot that happened before we got round to that,’ he rubs his forehead. ‘Shit Pete I’m sorry, I thought I’d told you.’
thing you could do better than me was be a pain in the arse. Well and look like a complete fucking idiot. So,’ he fixes Hammer with one of his stares, the ones he’s been perfecting ever since meeting Peter, ‘just how did you manage to find out about the fact Bucky had feelings for me, and that Cap and I were dancing around each other? Because not even the rest of the
‘But-’ Peter cuts off Deadpool’s argument by webbing him and dragging him away. ‘Sorry guys got to go! Have a look at the sneak peeks below for more an idea. I’ve got a hormonal teenager to deal with!’
‘Peter?’ Tony asks, looking worriedly at the boy.
‘I like that idea,’ Bucky says, metal arm whirring as it takes most of the strain from the load, ‘then we only have to replace it if it starts to rot.’
Heart pounding from nerves after finally having got everything off of his chest Peter waits nervously for Loki to respond as they continue along the street.
‘Alright, children let’s settle down and watch the film,’ Clint rolls his eyes.
‘Clint,’ her tone is warning.
‘So, you won’t care if I tell her it was you that snuck into her room and stole all her jumpers so she had to wear the pink fluffy one with the unicorn on the front then?’
,’ Natasha calls out to him. ‘Come on, Pete, you’re smarter than that.’
‘It is!’ Wade agrees quickly, looking back to Peter. ‘It’s just… you’re the first person whose seen my face and hasn’t reacted with some form of disgust. I hadn’t prepared myself for any part of me to be called “gorgeous” so I just…panicked.’
‘FRIDAY? Get the NYPD to set up a road block and start on citizen evac and I want someone to go after Hammer to make sure that slime ball doesn’t get out.’
‘I know. But she feels this is the only way she can still protect him. Although Iron Man made a lot of positive changes in Tony’s life, it’s the one part Pepper’s never really been able to accept. He’s always been self-destructive and she sees Iron Man as the accumulation of all of that.’
A/N: Hey everyone. Thank you for all my comments and kudos on this story so far. Do let me know what you think of these two chapters, especially about Peter's thoughts on Ultron and the stories with the Commandos here.
squad didn’t it?’
‘I don’t think he meant to, but he had some of the drink Valkyrie made for me not realising what was in it.’
Between the four of them it doesn’t take too long and they’re able to start trying to organise how to drag the tree back to the front of the facility before it gets completely dark.
‘What? Since when?’
Steve just laughs at his friend and lays back, pulling Tony into his side again as the dark haired man smirks at their visitor. ‘Sorry, Bucky, if you want him to leave you alone you shouldn’t wind him up so much. Now why don’t you go sort out that bird’s nest you call hair and we’ll see you upstairs soon?’
Bucky just nods thoughtfully. ‘So where am I allowed to go tomorrow then?’
‘He’s putting up traps. I think it’s better to leave him to it,’ Bruce chuckles. ‘It’s almost as bad as having a furry uncontrollable-stage Tony.’
‘I swear Tony you say make one joke and I’ll give you another black eye,’ he growls as the inventor takes a seat next to him. He sighs as Tony makes a zipping motion over his lips and grins. ‘We’re not going to be able to manage it.’
‘You and me both,’ Clint grins as he joins them, ‘if they’d done it a couple of years sooner I would have won my bet with Nat.’
and then tell me I have to wait a
‘Yes,’ Steve sighs, then heaves a laugh. ‘But they’ve had so little time to themselves recently I can’t blame Wade for wanting to drag Peter off for some one-on-one time. Come on, let’s get the cocoa heating ready for when everyone gets back.’
‘I swear you start apologising and I’m banning you from touching any and every bottle of alcohol in this facility.
He doesn’t pull it out like Steve is expecting. He crushes it. Just closes his fist and the arc reactor shatters.
Dinner doesn’t kill anyone. In fact it’s nothing less than the usual indescribably wonderful food that Mama Rhodes has turned out for years. Or at least as long as Tony has known her. The conversation flows easily, so do the drinks, and the food disappears quicker than usual; by the end everyone is stuffed and not really willing to move.
Francis just laughs. ‘Oh please. Don’t you realise we’re  moving away from here? I mean sure we’ve still got the last few bits to move out, and I thought: why not keep it running with volunteers just so I can lay a trap for whoever it was that’s been fucking around with my other labs?’
‘Of course,’ she nods, then taps her head, ‘I know these things you know.’ Then she winks at her.
I would love to hear your ideas on it all though, on Tony and Bucky's relationship and also on how you think Tony would have behaved had the team all come back. I get the feeling from his interactions with Peter in the films that he would really try with the relationships this time around: he's lost so many relationships in his life it seems only Rhodey, Pepper and Happy have stuck around. What I also find interesting is Vision is the only other who sticks around, and he has all of JARVIS' conscience as well as his own.
Everyone laughs at the teenager’s plight and Wanda moves the box out of the way for him to lower another. ‘Any news on how he’s getting on?’ she asks.
‘Steven!’ Thor greets him with a one armed hug, his cape flowing out behind him. ‘Congratulations on the day of your union!’
‘I’m not sure that’s encouraging,’ Wanda mutters.
Eventually they agree to keep Matt out of it for now and say that Peter and Loki picked up on the energy signature and went to investigate and ran into Wade during the ensuring fight.
‘Hey you alright? You looked like you spaced out for a second.’
‘Not to mention dinner,’ he mutters.
‘I’m never letting her live it down that I beat her,’ Scott proclaims proudly.
‘It helps us to see where the scar tissue is and what can be repaired and what cannot,’ Vision explains. ‘When we tested it with Tony we were able to see which parts of his psyche could be healed and which were damaged beyond repair.’
‘Don’t worry,’ Tony comes to stand next to him, ‘we’ll go check out the runes, check to make sure they’re just really old graffiti, and then we’ll head back to the hotel, get in the Jacuzzi together and warm up. Alright?’
Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian have arrived in New York. Steve and Tony help Strange and Wong hold off the first of Thanos' lieutenants until more of the team can reach them to help.
She does as he suggests. ‘Two minutes. I think we’ve hit the jackpot.’
The next few days is a flurry of activity and Sam is positive he’s never known the team this busy outside of a world ending crisis. Strange had been over a couple of times but has been called to Kamar-Taj to help with a situation, and Sam is surprised to say that they were actually disappointed the doctor couldn’t join them for more of the preparations; he has promised to be back in time for Yule, however, and to bring Wong with him. Despite himself Sam is looking forwards to seeing the stoic man again.
It feels like it takes hours before there’s finally a hole big enough and stable enough for the first of the trapped civilians to be coached through by Rhodes and Clint; Clint steps out of the War Machine suit and has it stand sentry in case anyone tries to attack them from behind whilst he lays on his front and helps pull the three trapped in there with Rhodes and Hulk one by one.
‘Where’s everyone else?’ he demands.
‘Not exactly, not the way it is in the story at any rate. We’d been sent to do some task for Odin and it ended up being a trap. As we were attempting to escape Sif’s hair, which at the time was long and braided like the majority of Asgardian women, got trapped; there was no time to try and free it as our enemies were closing down on us so I simply used a dagger to cut it free and we left. She was not amused and suffered many weeks of teasing from the other warriors at the state of her hair, but at least she was alive. Thor at least came and thanked me for the quick thinking that saved her life, but Sif was too proud to say it herself. Although for a time she was a little less hostile towards me, so I suppose that was thanks enough in itself.’
‘No wait!’ everyone turns to stare at Peter who sinks back into the chair as if he wants it to swallow him whole.
‘Can I bring you anything? Something to drink perhaps? I shall ask T’Challa if we can postpone our trip to the UN.’
Then those are the memories flashing across the back of his eyelids. The chair. The machine they would use to recalibrate him. His missions. The pain. He suddenly realises he’s shouting out with the remembered pain, and then he panics. Being dragged further into the memory.
‘I know,’ he swallows and moves to the corridor which will take him to the room Tony is using. Every step his heart pounds a little faster, and he finds it a little harder to breathe. When he finally reaches Tony's door his hands are shaking as he knocks. ‘Tony?’ he calls when there’s no answer.
‘So you’re not intending on coming here and kidnapping me are you?’
Love always,
. My hand hurts. Why did we have to hand write the invites?’
‘I’m sorry.’
‘Oh you were always as shit at lying as you were everything else,’ Tony waves his comment off. ‘Tell me Hammer, did Ross also supply you with notes on my capture in Afghanistan? Is that why you tried to imitate that so much? Because you also knew about my hydrophobia? About where it came from? Did he tell you to make sure I died or did he just tell you to break me?’
‘Why is it still in my chest?’ he chokes out again, tears filling his vision.
Steve walks up and raises an eyebrow at the identical grins on their faces. ‘Are you two plotting?’
‘So do you, Nat, you look beautiful,’ he smiles at her.
‘When did that happen?’ Bucky grins.
‘Wade this is Harry, he’s just started at our school but we were friends since we were babies,’ Peter says, dragging Harry over to the merc. ‘Harry, this is my boyfriend Wade.’
‘We’ll work out where it’s going when we actually get it home,’ Tony says. ‘Though personally I think it should go out the back so we can see it from the common area.’
‘Obtain glorious victory!’ Thor answers.
shouting, then I’m not allowed on patrols during the
‘It’s a distinct possibility,’ the humanoid reassures her, ‘but may require some work and for now it’s better if it stays where it is so I am better able to study it. I’m hoping we can find another solution, but I do wonder if destroying it might be the best answer.’
‘Oh Spideykins!’
‘Because it’s the only one he learnt all the way through,’ Loki sniggers. ‘He doesn’t know any of the others well enough.’
‘Thor, what happened?’ Steve asks.
‘That is…’ Betty looks a little green.
‘Ugh, fine,’ Bucky grins up at the ceiling where Peter’s still crouching. ‘Call it even now?’
‘Not in the mood,’ he says.
‘Well I suppose that really depends on what he classes as ‘enhanced abilities’ doesn’t it?’ the third woman, who Tony thinks is the one called Val, adds. She turns to the camera. ‘Just to remind all of our viewers that Secretary Ross is proposing legislation that means anyone with enhanced abilities must register with the United States Government, he says as a way to ensure the safety of the individuals as well as the general public. It would mean everyone on the Avengers team would need to register, as well as several of the vigilantes we see around the country. Ross himself named some of the vigilantes he’s be working to find the identities of, including Spider-Man, Daredevil and Deadpool. That’s just in New York alone.’
Peter hangs up after his latest check in. He’s gone from doing one update per patrol to one every two hours as per Tony’s request, and he knows the man is monitoring the GPS on his suit every time he’s on patrol. He would be getting annoyed, but he remembers how scared Tony had been after the call with the guy named Hammer, and it makes him smile to know the man does actually care about him.
‘I’m starting to really wish you’d grow a beard,’ Tony responds, firing up the boots so he’s now hovering in the air. ‘Don’t know why just suddenly got this urge to see you with a beard.’
‘Because Wade was already causing trouble,’ he huffs.
(See the end of the chapter for
bad,’ Peter argues, ‘and I think he feels really guilty over everything that happened. It’s not like he
‘Yeah well I figured you’d rather me move in here than you move into my room,’ he replies, ‘besides I’ve got less than half the amount of stuff to move than you have Mr Billionaire.’
‘I have a feeling you’re going to tell me anyway.’
Steve sees what Wanda showed Sharon Carter and Tony reads a letter from his Aunt Peggy
‘Come in,’ comes the voice from inside, and he gingerly pushes the door open and steps into the man’s bedroom. ‘You alright, Pete?’
‘Scott?’ she suggests. ‘Clint?’ her voice is quieter now. ‘You know they’d be willing to help.’
‘Is that a puppy?’ Pepper asks, moving closer to scratch the soft fur on the small thing’s head. ‘It’s so cute!’
‘You know,’ Valkyrie says as she chews her way through a sweet roll, ‘there is one thing I miss from the Yule celebrations.’
‘Sorry Quill, my orders are to leave you there.’
‘Yeah no,’ he shakes his head firmly. ‘I have trouble when family shouts thanks to sensitive hearing. I don’t need to hear two people screaming at each other about whose turn it is to wash the dishes.’ He turns to look at the mercenary. ‘Where have you been the last week? I haven’t seen you around.’
Bucky and Loki are finally able to break the link
‘Captain America is still the coolest though.’
‘Now there was a hell of a lot of shit that we’ll discuss when we’ve got Wanda and Bucky back, but there’s one thing I’m really disappointed in, Peter, and I feel like we need to talk about it right now.’
‘Yep.’
Peter lets go of the breath he’s been holding and smiles at the older man. He pulls the books back towards them and turns to face his mentor. Over Tony’s shoulder he notices Steve’s soft smile before the man enters the kitchen again to help Natasha, and Peter’s attention is taken up with Tony’s explanations.
‘If you say so Tony,’ Steve chuckles. ‘Come on we better get a move on or else one of them will be coming down so we can all start decorating. The look on Wanda’s face when we agreed we wouldn’t do the Christmas tree last night! I thought she was going to murder someone.’
‘Who are you talking to anyway?’ Peter asks, coming into view, mask in his hand. ‘You’re not on your phone.’
‘Alright children that’s enough,’ Steve rolls his eyes. ‘Let’s make sure everyone’s presents are under the tree.’
‘You and me both,’ Bucky grumbles as they fall into step behind Sam.
‘Bucky! You’re stood outside a
At that moment Tony walks into the dining room, looks between the door to the kitchen where Natasha’s still laughing away, to Steve’s expression which is caught somewhere between trying to look stern and trying not to laugh, and Peter’s wide eyed innocent expression at the Captain’s question. ‘Peter I hope you’re not doing this in some form of revenge for him winding you up earlier.’
‘Who says I need saving?’ he says, willing his brain to process this situation faster.
‘Moving on,’ Natasha interrupts. ‘Who were the suggestions for the other two? Steve was mentioned yesterday.’
‘But Pete we’ve still got twenty minutes-’
‘You don’t know what he’s like because you’ve never taken the time to actually meet him!’
Tony blinks and looks at Steve in surprise. ‘What?’
‘He’s got your good heart, Steve, and he’s got your moral compass, rather than my screwed up one. So what he thinks is the right thing to do, usually is. But he wants to look out for the little guy, as well; and he has your aversion to bullies,’ Tony shoots him a smile out of the corner of his eye.
‘Tony?’
‘Only if you plan on stabbing me in the back, which is no more than what you do to me on a fairly regular basis,’ he replies, leaning back in his chair.
‘Are you attempting to be humorous or consoling? Because you are being neither.’
‘You know I always meant to ask you,’ Natasha says quietly after a couple of moments, ‘but I’ll understand if you don’t want to talk about it.’
‘Medical have given him the all clear,’ the soldier reports.
Oh right, the first was last week after the…
Steve just rolls his eyes and places a kiss to his lips, which Tony chases as Steve pulls away. ‘You look tired, honey,’ he says, running his fingers through Tony’s hair.
‘You know him?’ Steve asks.
Bucky frowns at him in confusion. ‘What do you mean?’
‘My king, what would you like me to do?’ a woman steps forward, addressing Thor.
‘Wow, actually threatening to lock us in our rooms? He’s really gone Mama Bear hasn’t he?’ Hope laughs as Peter digs in to the food Tony has laid out for him. ‘You know you guys really should be making notes on this visit.’
‘I take it you’re the Colonel’s sister?’ Wade supplies.
‘I’m heading to the bathroom I’ll meet you at the bar?’ she says, walking off before he gets a chance to say anything.
‘You’re looking a little confused, dearie,’ Agatha’s smiling again, ‘so I’ll enlighten you. I’ve been in your head and I’ve seen what you’re capable of, what you’ve held back from doing simply because you’re scared. You’re scared of your powers but you have no idea just how dangerous you really are, buttercup. You’re supposed to be a myth. You have the ability of spontaneous creation. Your power exceeds that of the Sorcerer Supreme! It’s your destiny to destroy the world. The funniest thing, toots? You had the ability to bring back your dead boyfriend all by yourself, and instead you hide away. You’re the Scarlet Witch, Wanda, and you just gave me everything. Which means
‘What is it Tony?’ the blond asks, looking up from his conversation with Vision. A few of them are sat having breakfast, he’s just finished a workout with Sam and Bucky and they’d come up to find Vision at the table. They still weren’t sure if he actually needed to eat, but he seemed to anyway.
‘I think I’m with Nat on this one,’ Steve says, eyes sparkling with mischief. ‘Thinking about it, I owe him a bit of embarrassment.’
‘Who’s next?’ Peter asks Wanda.
In a way she thought of Peter as a mix of her and her twin, but he’d never replace him. Pietro had been the other part of her soul, her opposite and yet her doppleganger; losing him had been like losing half of herself. Pietro had always tried to protect her, seen it as his duty to look after her once their parents were dead because he was the man of the family. It was why he’d signed up to Stryker’s experiments and he’d tried to tell her she couldn’t do the same, all in an effort to protect her from the man they saw as causing their parents’ deaths. The very man who now housed her, fed her, paid for everything she wanted, and who she’d freely admit she loved like a second father. The man who made sure Pietro wouldn’t be forgotten.
‘I think the team might disagree.’
‘Any last words for your friends before you forget who you are, little spider?’ Francis taunts him.
‘On it,’ she says, manoeuvring the jet.
Wanda tries to lead a session of Christmas cookie baking, when things escalate
‘You two should become friends,’ she points between the two rulers, ‘you’ve both got exactly the same problems.’
‘It is too late for platitudes and pleas of mercy now, brother,’ Lautenus growls. ‘Face me. Or are you now a cowardly Asgardian?’
‘Aww poor birdy doesn’t like pulling his weight,’ Bucky laughs. Thor looks behind at the sound of a grunt and two bodies hitting the floor as Sam drops his web rope and tackles Bucky to the floor.
Peter turns to look at where he’s pointing, and his spidey senses start tingling. ‘Karen? Can you get me sound?’
‘Six in total,’ comes the reply, Ross turning to face Rhodes. ‘It seems to have been some kind of science event that was taking place. The majority of the crowd have managed to get out. The speaker, a Dr Judith Monroe, is one of the hostages.’
‘Yeah well you left me riddled with holes so I think we’re even,’ the man replies.
Now what was next? Oh yeah! Alternative take on Infinity War and let’s save time by saying: Battle of Wakanda with all the heroes there; contrived reason to get Guardians to turn up; Gamora’s still dead. So’s Vision. Banner can now Hulk out. Storm turned up – because that’s not even more contrived than the rest of this shit is it? But hey at least the rest of the spandex squad isn’t there, just her and her tribe. Basically an excuse for the author to show she’s done some research into the comics. Big deal.
Peter pauses as Wade turns back to the bar and orders a beer from Weasel. Then he takes a deep breath. ‘Is it something to do with the Weapon-X programme?’
‘Like who?’ Peter asks. ‘Just as an idea for who I could be looking for with some other people.’
‘Yeah alright you can let go now. We are still at your school you know,’ Happy grumps.
time you grin at him?’
again.’
‘Alright, Pete, something only I would know?’  his voice is calming, like Peter’s gone mad. Which doesn’t feel too far from the truth right now. Tony takes a step towards him and Peter resists the urge to step back into Wade. He
‘Sounds like a challenge to me,’ Clint grins.
Thor opens his mouths to argue with his second in command but shuts it again at the withering look Valkyrie gives him. ‘I just don’t want you to feel that I’m abandoning-’
Pepper looks at him with amusement. ‘Oh don’t worry Steve he wouldn’t actually fire me. He knows the company would fall apart if he did, not to mention he’d never know where he’s supposed to be.’
Peter presses the end call button and heads towards the platform. ‘Sorry, Wade,’ he mutters, pulling up the map function on his phone, ‘but I can’t sit back and do nothing, and we’re going to need all the help we can get.’
Progress on the Christmas story is slow at the moment, but I should have something to post next Monday. As to this one, I'm probably going to do a couple of updates this week and next week as I have more chapters than weeks to update!
He looks back down at the man lying across several seats, blankets already wrapped around him in an effort to keep him warm.
‘I didn’t,’ Tony chuckles, wheeling his chair over as Peter ducks his head out, grease staining his face, ‘I nearly ended up flat as a pancake.’
Thank you so much for all your support for this series, you are all so amazing!
‘Have we put anything out looking for Francis?’ Wade asks. ‘We know he’s linked with HYDRA too, so it might be worth trying that avenue as well.’
‘Didn’t see any need to,’ Natasha shrugs. ‘And I’m sure Tony would have done it anyway.’
‘And I love walls that don’t have hand and foot prints all over them,’ May counters from her seat next to Mama. ‘I’m sure the Avengers would appreciate their walls being free of them as well.’
(See the end of the chapter for
There's a couple of hours of calm before the team have to start their planning. Steve and Tony discuss everything that's happened since their friends returned; Loki and Thor clear the air a bit; and Bucky is still more interested in Peter's choice of boyfriend than the world ending.
Their reply is the reverberating roar of Hulk echoing across the battlefield.
‘But if she’s using that to try and get a response, that implies there is a grain of truth to the statement. You feel affection for Captain-’
‘Thank you, Pool,’ he says, cutting off the merc.
It’s a kick this time, meant to knock him off balance. Instead he jumps up, using Steve as a springboard to flip over the top of him, landing and spinning a kick into the small of his back.
‘Let’s do this team!’ Scott’s voice rings through their comms as FRIDAY sounds the starting claxon.
‘I’m surprised she left them alive!’
‘Tony-’
‘I’ll warn you, Steve,’ Pepper sighs as he walks towards Tony’s office, ‘he’s in a particularly difficult mood today.’
‘Take it up with, Nat,’ he waves in the red-head’s direction, ‘and let me get back to my fixing. Is Scott here yet? Scott’s actually helpful in these situations.’
‘What is it?’ the man who is obviously the leader of this little bunch snaps at her, looking up from his phone that he’s been focussed on for the past twenty minutes.
‘Why do you call me that?’ he asks, turning back to the god.
It’s a couple of hours later, and Steve and Bucky have brought Peter back up after an intense workout. The two super-soldiers are sweating and out of breath, but Peter still seems to be bouncing on his toes.
‘Peter…’ Steve struggles to get the words out. ‘Peter’s bonded with the Symbiote again.’
‘Been kind of busy looking at a load of uglies,’ Natasha responds.
‘You going to just stand there all afternoon or you actually going to do something?’ Natasha asks him during one such day that Tony has come down to the gym to get some training in. Only Steve and Bucky are already sparring and Tony may have got a bit distracted.
‘Oh really?’ Steve grins and climbs onto the bed to crouch on all fours above his boyfriend. ‘So was I imagining you enjoying it when we were chopping wood at Clint’s farm back when we faced Ultron?’
He’s cut off by a cry of pain from both Bruce and Thor and the pair drop Loki to the floor. Except Loki looks very different to how he was a couple of seconds ago.
have chosen you over Steve. Now don’t get me wrong I don’t want to break them up or anything, those two work well together and they’re happy and I don’t want that to end. What I don’t get is why
‘Then in which case we shall say goodbye, ladies and gentlemen. Enjoy your meeting with Ross,’ and with that Tony turns on his heel and marches out. When they are outside the door and a safe distance away, he looks at Steve out the corner of his eye and grins. ‘I never get to go in there with the upper hand. That was fun!’
‘I’m the one with the Spidey senses, I’ll be able to dodge them. Regeneration doesn’t count in this game,’ Peter points out and they head around to where they head round to where they last saw the couple.
‘I thought it was taking you a while to catch on. Now come on, Elsa, we’ve got more work to do.’
‘What’s up Nat?’ he asks taking the tablet from her and frowning down at it.
‘No it would not,’ the man is firm, ‘you will find reasons to use your magic and not to recover. You will be better to go to the facility where our friends can look after you. I’ll be back in an hour.’
‘Agreed,’ Steve nods. ‘Thanks, Nick.’
‘Got any information on him?’
Tony huffs another laugh. ‘Yeah that was an interesting conversation with May Parker.’
I’m a genius.’
‘It’s on the vanity, Vis,’ she laughs and points it out to him. ‘You sure you don’t mind being here? Wouldn’t you rather work on the stones?’
There’s a pause. ‘I never wanted it.’
‘I understand, Steven, thank you,’ he replies.
‘I’ll have less of an impact on the balance,’ he answers, jumping down and landing dead centre on the platform, only causing it to spin rather than to tip. As Steve lands next to him, Peter scrambles to accommodate the shift in weight, ending up closer to the edge of the platform. He manages to grab hold of the next monkey bar and pulls himself up, pretending to struggle, as Steve grabs the next one along, and they repeat this for the next two platforms.
‘Tony who is it?’ Steve’s sleepy voice rumbles from behind him.
Peter groans and buries his head in his hands. He knew she was going to bring up what had happened with Lisa during his week-long interview at some point, he just wishes it wasn’t in front of the whole team right before he’s about to go on a school trip.
‘I need to get him stable,’ Wanda sobs, ‘I can partially close the wound with my magic.’
‘This is why we’re friends, Stephen,’ and Bucky sees Stark give the doctor a relieved smile, the soldier in him noting the loosening of the tight shoulders. He turns back to Bucky. ‘Sergeant Barnes this is Doctor Stephen Strange, and he is now going to be in charge of your care.’
‘Spoilsport,’ she grins.
what you’re calling it these days?’ she raises an eyebrow with a slight smirk. ‘Looks like much more than a conversation if you ask me.’
‘Well we thought it better to make sure both magic users were on different teams,’ Tony grins sheepishly. ‘I didn’t fancy ending up on the opposite team and having to take you both on.’ He takes a coin out and flips it, catching it and covering with his other hand. ‘Call it, Cap.’
A middle-aged man walks out of the back room that Steve had seen earlier, a group of teenagers following behind him, and Steve finally spots Peter, looking like he wants to run as fast as his enhanced muscles will let him.
‘And kid? You should know better than anyone I make it very clear when I’m not happy. So don’t you
‘Dare I ask how Yule went?’ Bucky grins as Loki comes to stand next to him.
Peter and Shuri groan in unison from their place at his bench. The Wakandan princess had been giving him suggestions for his new project based on how she uses some Wakandan technology to help their agricultural industry. Bruce just waves his hand. ‘Yeah, give me twenty minutes to finish this.’
‘I’m sorry, Colonel, but I’m afraid I do not have an override protocol,’ he replies.
‘Not got your buddies Captain America or the Winter Soldier to help you this time?’ one of the boys scoffs.
Tony doesn’t get a lot of sleep so he gets to breakfast a lot earlier than normal; he says a brief hello to Steve, Bucky and Natasha who are all sat finishing off their own meals.
‘What? I’ve not shot him yet, I’d say I’m on my best behaviour.’
That’s when his senses set off a new tone, and he dodges a blow from behind him. ‘Who’s fighting you now, Peter?’ Steve asks, his voice further as he continues to dodge attacks from his new sparring partner.
I manage to take advantage of the person’s surprise and pin them down on the floor, ripping off the mask. Peter’s face looks back at me. ‘What the fuck you playing at Francis?’
‘Yeah,’ he groans, ‘apparently our alien friend doesn’t appreciate the local flora. Oh boy,’ he dodges out the way of a blow from the alien’s hammer, only to have it throw a piece of debris towards him. ‘Please tell me you’re close, babe, because I need a bit of help here.’
Bucky gets a visit in hospital from the last person in the world he was expecting to see. He also learns his best friend is even more of an idiot than he first thought.
‘Pete?’ He turns to face Bucky.
‘Did…did he just use Natasha’s signature take down
The team know the only way to end this fight is by using the Stones. But who will be the one to do it?
Peter goes to stand next to Wanda as Mr Harris puts everyone into two groups, and he’s relieved to see Ned, MJ, Betty and Harry heading towards them. ‘Why hasn’t Bucky been assigned somewhere yet?’ he whispers to Wanda.
Peter tries not to choke on a laugh at the last comment and immediately reaches for his phone.
‘Of course,’ the AI responds.
After a couple of seconds Natasha chuckles and points at the last step on the instructions.
‘No,’ Strange replies, landing next to them. ‘No, he had to get the Space Stone, but we needed you to get this group here first.’
Natasha looks at him for a few seconds. ‘I didn’t think Nick needed to know. You’d been through enough and Pepper said you were getting better with it.’
‘Tony,’ she replies, ‘he said it might make you feel less uncomfortable at having to dance in the first place. Though I must admit I don’t know what he was so worried about, you’re a pretty good dancer.’
‘Awww come on. I’d dress up as you for Halloween,’ he teases.
first.’ They walk for a few minutes in silence as they follow behind the two soldiers. ‘Hey, you thought about going to visit your mom’s grave at all? Might be a good opportunity. And we could keep the others busy if you wanted to go without them.’
anything for certain,’ Wade snaps. ‘Hell, I’m just being honest here we have no fucking clue what is going on. HYDRA have disappeared into thin air and they’ve taken back the two members of this team they helped create.’
He drinks some of his coffee as he takes a stool at the breakfast bar next to her. ‘Nat you know I’m crap at this, but…’ he trails off, and a brief glance at her from the corner of his eye shows she’s patiently waiting for him to speak. ‘I can’t do this alone anymore, I need help.’
Clint has an arrow to his bow faster than Steve can blink, and Natasha has her guns up. Immediately the former spy lowers them when she sees the newcomer. ‘Daredevil.’
Tony laughs. ‘You’re a true friend.’
Bucky laughs. ‘This is much more entertaining than the gossip that Karen’s been feeding me. Did you know they all think Doctor Strange and Doctor Palmer are shacking up?’
Tony leaves the apartment with a secret smile on his face as he hears Peter’s excitable voice already trying to convince May to let him come up to the facility more often. All previous sadness forgotten. Tony knows the guilt will come back, but hopefully, tonight at least, he’ll sleep soundly.
Tony can’t help but join in with the other man’s infectious chuckle. ‘Alright I’ll admit you surprised me.’
‘Uh….not sure. Maybe? There’s been so many changes I just gave up keeping track,’ he shrugs in response.
He turns and smiles at the teen, pulling him into a one armed hug as they leave the training room.

too much faith in those two being adults.’
‘Bucky…’
‘So will mine!’ Peter chimes in, trying to give his brain a break from algebra. He
‘You’re more than welcome,’ she turns to Tony. ‘I assume I leave this particular patient out of my reports Mr Stark?’
‘You are in Wakanda now,’ T’Challa tells her. ‘Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.’
‘No, we can get you out of here,’ she sobs.
I love you all so much and I cannot begin to describe how much all of you wonderful readers have meant to me whilst writing this; getting your comments and kudos notifications always brightens up my day. I hope you can continue to enjoy the journey in the rest of this series.
Blinking awake the next morning from where they’d both fallen asleep half on the bed and half-off, he has to admit he’s a little impressed at what they’ve achieved.
‘No, Wade.’
‘Oh shut it, Stark,’ Bucky huffs a laugh, and Steve notices him squeeze back. He sits opposite the two of them as he ties his own skates, trying to block out the cold he can already feel seeping from the rink only a couple of feet away.
Stark sighs and slumps into a chair, taking out his phone. ‘Sorry, Barnes, I need to make a very important call. Then I’ll explain what the fuck is going on.’
‘My name. It’s Peter Parker.’
The evening has been entertaining to say the least. Peter watches, grinning to himself, as Steve continues to scold Bucky; the Winter Soldier had tried to sneak him some alcohol to try, but Steve had caught them before Peter had been able to take a sip.
‘Farewell for now friends,’ Thor turns to them all, ‘and my thanks again for agreeing to protect my people and my brother.’
again because of him.’
‘Me neither,’ Rhodes adds.
bed now is it, Spangles?’ Tony grins, making Steve blush.
‘He’s been climbing up the walls.’
‘Why would you make her a gun?’ Natasha asks, voice soft as she goes to sit at the table near him.
‘Well I’m not going to be able to see where you’re going,’ Matt says with a slight smile. Peter feels himself blushing but takes the man’s arm and starts to lead him through the crowd. All the time his brain is working in overdrive trying to place that voice.
‘Have fun kids. You let that thing get anywhere near me and I’ll find some way to make you suffer,’ he says as he jogs away. He watches the other three have a quick discussion before Rhodes calls Peter over to the middle to start the game.
‘Aww Mommy Spider and Baby Spider,’ Sam teases; which quickly turns to a frown when he finds webbing covering his own mouth after the comment.
?’ Steve asks as he appears out of the tree line.
‘Hey,’ Steve catches his arm and pulls him to a stop, turning him to face him, ‘soon we won’t have to,’ he tells him quietly. ‘We’ve already got so much groundwork down with T’Challa to move…
‘Wanda and Vision have gone to a restaurant,’ Rhodes says, ‘and you’re acting like they’ve gone to take on a supervillain. They’ve gone on a date, chill out.’
‘He still not happy about Venom?’
My heart stops. Pretty sure I actually fucking die for a minute there. It can’t be.
‘Hey boys, good week at school?’
Neither of them replies. Which is all the answer they need.
‘Oh my god, what has my life come to?’ Peter groans, covering his face with his hands. ‘Stop laughing MJ.’
‘What’s got you all energetic today, Baby Boy?’ Deadpool laughs. ‘Finally asked the girl out you’ve had your eye on and she say yes?’
will just accept them back with open arms like nothing ever happened? Ross challenges him.
‘Fine, Wanda and Peter can show Wade to his room,’ Natasha rolls her eyes, ‘Bucky you show Nick to his.
‘Why should I tell you why I do anything?’ he says, arms crossed over his chest.

‘In his room.’
‘Last present of the night, Peter,’ he says, handing it over with a small smile.
‘Ned,
‘The only reason I’m still in the bed is because you’re subconsciously sticking yourself to me,’ Wade cuts him off.
‘You know I’d do anything for you Baby Boy.’
‘Err…hey Widow? Please tell me that isn’t-’
‘Nat, seriously I’m fine, I can go by myself just give me a minute.’
Here's your sneak peek:
‘She’s a witch,’ Wanda explains. ‘She managed to twist my own magic against me, but I know how to fight her now. You can’t fight her without me.’ She looks to Strange. ‘She absorbs people’s magic. She’d drain you and leave you a dried-out husk. Together we might be able to beat her, but we can’t face her alone.’
“You are not proud of anything. Tony and I…”  A music interrupted Steve. Somehow I love you baby was playing on his but. “Hello?” Steve get a phone call from Tony.
“J.A.R.V.I.S. you can take my old jacket back on my closet, I’m gonna wear this until the last student of the Academy dye by envy” Tony said proudly as Steve laught.
A beautiful kiss. Their lips touched slowly, carefully.
“Yeah, we are going to break up just after the Dance, you will yell at me because my arrogant and over the top personality and after two or three days of drama we would agree on be friends and lead the school together as usual, just you know, with fake royal titles” Tony said as it was nothing, as the idea didn’t break Steve’s heart. They were close and Steve was afraid that their broken heart were so much over his face.
“NonOnoNO no.. No nO no”
“We are a very productive group” Steve said with proud.
“Nothing, nothing, I’m fine, I’m just...just…” but Steve was holding him. An all Steve hug, with his arm around his body and a hand over his head and his sweet, sweet voice saying sweet things.
“Tony hates me” Steve said dramatically as he get up showing that he wasn’t crying at all “this is a mess, I don’t know why I am even trying…”
“I promise it, Tony.” Steve said kissing his hand “but please, if something in this relationship scares you, no matter how silly you think it would be, I what to hear it”
Steve stand up and offered his hand to Tony.
“Take a deep breath and face the day, Steve” Sam said cheering his friend. Steve square his shoulder and started walking, no one is going to accuse him to be a coward.
“I miss you” Steve said dryly and then hang up.
JARVIS appeared with a clean suit and bright shoes for him.
“Tony, I am afraid that we are doing different things here, and you know that lying is not my…”
“What is a mess? for what I know you and him are going to prom together”
“Steve… you didn’t know”
“RIght…   I am sending you a  lot of selfies, put one of them as your lock screen”
“No, no. I told you. You had to call me baby or honey or something like that”
“Stark” Steve said sitting next to him on the couch of the Avenger’s dorm.
Tony had confident on his beauty and charisma, the King and Queen competition of the prom will be an easy win. Sure thing. He got it on the pocket. Zero problems.
“But you like me, Tony, and you are not exactly single, right?”
“Its lying…”
“Well Captain, maybe I don’t have a date yet, but I’m going soon, and then we are gonna beat you and Carter or were ever you are going to take to the dance”
He was swirling around, laughing and making faces. Steve stayed there, losing at the thought of how happy his new boyfriend was. Only the smug look of the butler wake him up of his daydreams.
“What? Oh, yes, yes everything is fine, Sugarplum.” Tony said with his best false smile.
They are totally going to win the prom competition.
“I AM FINE, STEVE”
“I didn’t mean it like...” He totally did. “It is just, It would be easier to believe that you break out with me, I am an awkward and boring person, Tony, you can do like so much better”
Steve feel Tony get close to him, his big brown eyes were smiling and the top of their fingers were touching each others.
“Obviously, the Academy loves me”
“Our break up…” Steve repeated sadly, it looks like Tony had everything planned.
Steve hear a lot of movement on the other side of the door. He was thrilled, they finally are going together at the dance, after all the games and doubts they are going to dance together and had the most romantic date ever. The past days had been a dream come true. They had walked together holding hands and Steve founded that Tony loves to hear him talking about his feelings, his eyes grown so big when Steve hug him and go forever about the much he admired him, or the pretty smell of his hair or how many times Steve had imagined they both dancing together. He know he is being cheesy and that he was oversharing. But it was Tony. And he can’t content himself. He know the clock was ticking and soon enough Tony is going to get tired of him. No, Tony had tell him that that is not going to happen. That he can never get tired of Steve.
Steve put his hand over Tony’s shoulder. The genius had agree to kiss him. He had agree to kiss him as much as he want. Maybe Steve can had everything that he want.
“I am… what?”
“I just.. I just don’t get it” Tony said, and he honestly didn’t know what he was talking about “I never want it this...I never want it…”
“I kept thinking about all that thing you said about how I was going to break out with you because you are too needy and cheesy. And I kept thinking that I am the one who is too needy and cheesy. You had to hate that”
“I would never break up with you, no one is going to believed that”
“A meeting?”
“Tony?”
“My what?”
“That sound like fun” Tony said fondly.
Sam started to push Steve out of the room. The taller man looked scarier than when he face Hydra.
“Yes they are, good thing you are not”  Tony said looking at his boyfriend “I now is ridiculous, but please, if we are going to change our close and fly over the bunch of cowards that we are going to lead, just promise me that you are not breaking up with me at the end of the dance”
Tony hold a breath and Steve had to repeat the words on his mind before figure it how it had sound it.
“No” Steve said firmly “I don’t want an act, I want you”
Steve stayed in the middle of the ground. Seeing how Tony left. He was trying to express his feelings, but Tony didn't want to hear them. Maybe in some other moment he could negotiate a goodbye kiss.
Oh wow I cant believed I actualized. I promise that the next one is going to last least. Im not shure how many chapters is going to be but i had so many feelings on AVAC stony that I just want to writhe them forever. But well, this is the second chapter.
“Do you know why I am single?”
“Because I can assure you than not your ridiculously handsome face neither your perfect body or lovable personality is a match for me” Tony said with all the confidence that he could, the true was that the Captain is going to be a hard opponent.
“Sometimes I felt you unreal”
“What?”
Something odd passed over Steve face, like the ghost of a sad thought and for a moment Tony was afraid to had misunderstanded Steve’s plan, but when Peter Parker asked for a picture for the school newspaper Steve tooked his hand gently and smiled as Tony rested his head over his big shoulder.
“what?”
“That’s ridiculous!”
“Oh wow” Tony take the jacket that Steve was holding “This is yours”
“Wait! I be ready soon” A glance and JARVIS disappeared.
“Tony?” It was Steve’s voice “It is everything okey?”
“Only if you said yes” Steve said with the lower voice that he used to discuss dangerous strategies “but if you said no, I just gonna find a more difficult way to win”
“I didn’t intend to interrupt you!” Steve said
“Why? Oh god.. why. Steve I’m a mess, I’m not that brilliant and nice person you kept saying I am. DAMN Steve I… I get panic over a suit and shoes that we had already decided, I’m trembling on a the night that should be perfect”
Steve smells like soap and fresh air. Tony was thrilled, not only Steve had give him his jacket, but they had walked around all the academy together, all the people had see him smiling next to the good old Capitan. And the kid from brooklyn had made a perfect performance, he was all flustered and shy. Even after the ball, when Steve and him will play their break up Tony would be able to come back and check the records and photos of him and Steve, maybe he would be able to convince his future self that it wasn't pretending, that Steve didn't hate him and that it was a time when he was worthy of this affection.
“Tony, i…”
They stand awkward for a while. The half meter between them feels like so much more.
“I bring you a gift”
“No… You said you want to date me, for real. And this is it. This is what real is for me. I cry without reason and invented compuleted things on my head that no always had sence. But you… you are still this perfect boyfriend who gets out of a Hallmark movie and honestly I can’t… I can’t understand…”
“What?” Steve answered confused
“Do you have a date, already?” Steve asked with least confidence than before, he almost looked sad.
The billionare get silence a few seconds. His smile grown different at his first one and an adorable red cover his face.
on breaking the law.’
‘Which cell did they target? Anyone we should be aware of?’ Tony asks, following Vision out of the jet and ensuring it was secured behind them.
‘Indeed. I have many years left ahead of me, unless I should fall in battle, so it not something that needs immediate attention but it is something I have had to consider. Though part of me has been too nervous to give it much thought. I…I had always thought I would wed for affection, if not for love. It’s what Mother had always told us. Though she and Father were an arranged marriage and they grew to love each other.’
lifetime with him. You will never be able to join him here in the land of the dead Wade Wilson. You will have one lifetime with him and then you will be cursed to forever walk the world above, never able to see him again or join him in eternal rest. You are cursed to live forever. I hope he’s worth it.’
Suddenly Christmas was looking a lot better.
‘And you believe Sergeant Barnes wants this process to work?’ the same council members asks.
‘Tony just press the call button,’ Steve’s exasperated voice rumbles behind him. He’s currently using his boyfriend as a pillow to try and give him the courage to call May Parker.
‘Good morning, Sergeant Barnes, how are you feeling this morning?’ The nurse is far too cheerful and it makes Bucky grind his teeth to bite back on his annoyance; he knows she’s only doing her job but it’s the exceptionally cheery tone that he can’t stand.
Peter shrugs. ‘Possibly. But honestly? I’d rather stay here and help you feel better.’

‘Me too,’ Sam agrees, ‘I think it’s been made better because we’ve got more people as well. Though if you’d asked me before I’d have said more people would have been too much craziness.’
year, otherwise we’ll run out of trees.’
‘Best not to keep him waiting,’ Loki smirks, ‘he does get rather irritable.’
‘Turns out they heard about Ross’ little power play yesterday,’ Tony responds, taking a seat at the end of the table. ‘I think they want to apologise.’
have used his webs to grab the last set of monkey bars that’ll take him back to dry land, but that would mean revealing Spider-Man just for the sake of the assault course.
Looking down he realises he has an answer. ‘I guess because it reminds me I’m alive. If the light was on I was alive and I’d stay that way. After Obi and New York it was comforting having that reminder. And when I’d wake up after a nightmare all I had to do was look down and see the light and know none of the dream was real anymore, I’d come through it all. Now, when I wake in the middle of the night that’s gone. Sometimes I hate that it’s gone and I almost wish I could put it back; and other times I just want to throw all of them onto a fire and watch them burn.’
‘Possibly or probably?’ he asks. Vision pauses and Bucky gives a small laugh. ‘Don’t bother, Vision, that’s answer enough.’
‘Kid? Shut it.’
The nurse huffs in annoyance. ‘Go up to the tenth floor, he’ll be in C ward, you can ask the nurses there where he is.’
The man is standing in a fighter’s stance, ready to fight back should Peter get closer. ‘Why didn’t you tell them?’ he asks.
‘Then tell them to piss off.’
‘What’s that supposed to mean?’
‘Oh yeah, damn trash panda is getting turned into a hat by the time I’m done with him,’ Quill grumbles, then yelps as he falls to the ground, landing in a heap at Steve’s feet. ‘Don’t mind my head, it’s fine.’
The group heads to Norway; Wanda and Vision have an accident during training; and Natasha finds some strength from those around her.
Let me know what you all think. I hope you're all getting ready for Christmas!
‘I know. But Peter’s special, Ms Parker. More special than any other boy his age. He’s incredibly smart and his heart is in the right place. But he also has these powers, and if he doesn’t find a way to control them he may end up getting caught and used as some kind of experiment by the military, or by someone with less than honourable intentions. He keeps the mask people look out for the suit; they focus on
‘I’ll go with the boys,’ Natasha says, hurrying out after the soldiers.
Tony grins. ‘He did.’
‘No man, my dance routines are limited to the robot from now on,’ Rhodes laughs, putting his phone away.
.’ She points to a spot on a map.
‘Mmm… Merry Christmas, Steve,’ he says, finally opening his eyes to look up at the blond. ‘Now how about you give me a proper Christmas wake up?’ Another rumbling chuckle from Steve and the soldier leans down to capture his lips in a bruising kiss.
sit down.’
When he reaches the common area he finds Bucky where FRIDAY says he would be. ‘If you’re trying to decide between the scotch and the gun I’d go for the scotch. Tastes better,’ he says, going to a cabinet and taking out two glasses. ‘Plus it’s easier to share the scotch,’ he puts the two glasses down in front of Bucky and pours some of the amber liquid into each.
‘It’s the Midgard equivalent to our Yule celebrations. The reason you never took part is most likely because you’d returned to Asgard for Yule,’ Loki explains, addressing the last part to his brother. ‘Except there is quite a lot of differences between the reasons for the celebration, and also in the actual celebrations themselves. I for one have never quite understood the concept of a red clothed man flying through the sky in a chariot.’
‘Dammit Loki keep your damn mouth away from me!’ Clint roars after him.
‘Alex Williams,’ she responds so quickly Steve wonders if she’s memorised the names and faces of every person on the guest list. ‘His company is into pharmaceuticals but is making progress to bring the costs of manufacturing down so more can be sent out to less developed countries. They donate a lot of medical supplies to relief organisations, hence his invitation.’
‘Is it because I made a new suit?’ he asks, as the music comes over the speakers on the plane.
‘Precisely,’ he nods in answer to Tony’s question and laughs as Peter sticks his tongue out at him.
‘Nope,’ the inventor cuts him off, ‘no I didn’t. I may have not told you everything back then, but I never lied. I don’t believe it in. Even when I spoke to Ross the other day I was careful with how I worded my answers so I wasn’t outright lying.’
‘This sounds like an excellent idea!’ Thor booms. ‘What are these wildebeest you speak of and who is this Mufasa I can avenge?’
‘Always, Peter,’ she says as he climbs out of the window. ‘Did you remember to do your algebra you’ve been procrastinating on for the past two days?’
‘What-’
Valkyrie sobers up, casting a quick glance around the table to make sure no one is listening to them she then lowers her voice. ‘Tell me truthfully: how difficult are you finding this without her here?’
were the one that got that reactor to me in Wakanda in time.’
‘You did really well today, kid, I’m proud of you,’ he slings an arm over Peter’s shoulders and walks them over to their drinks, impressed with himself for making the youngster out of breath for once. ‘Next time we get some training time together I’ll take you through some boxing moves.’
‘For me!’ he cuts across the inventor’s protests as the team laughs.
Vision appears next to her. ‘I have located the mainframe. Shall we collect our information?’
‘I agree,’ Steve nods.
‘I’m hoping it’s just our paranoia about enclosed cold spaces,’ Steve replies, earning himself a snort from Bucky. He notices Tony giving him his ‘are you alright?’ look and gives him a reassuring smile and nod. They’re just being paranoid.
‘Quill and Nebula?’
‘Fuck that’s bad,’ Bucky says.
Thor and Valkyrie return alongside some new allies. Though as soon as the battle turns in their favour, Thanos arrives.
Natasha takes a seat on his other side, the super soldiers having taken the rest of the school for the treasure hunt, and leans back on the couch, also leaning a little closer to him as she does. ‘So,’ she asks, voice low, and Peter’s immediately wary, ‘you know when the team was having their little meltdown about not realising you were bi?’
Wade helps Tony to clear away the plates and they send everyone back downstairs. He notices the look Steve sends him before following everyone downstairs, but he just rolls his eyes at his boyfriend. He’s not going to be
‘I’m freaking out
‘Wait. What?’ Peter blinks. ‘I’m not in trouble?’
Thank you so so much for all your support.
‘Probably still down in your room,’ Tony answers, following him out into the corridor. ‘You alright?’
‘No he wanted the more refined technology in my chest.’
There’s a convoy of three vehicles just pulled in. One is a longer truck, the other two are SUVs. A motorbike pulls in behind them and the rider turns the engine off, pulling the helmet off and turning to the men climbing out of the SUVs.
‘Bucky,’ he manages to get past his tight throat. ‘I’ve had enough “Sergeant Barnes” from overly cheerful nurses.’
‘What the hell?’ Natasha asks. Steve looks up from where he’s been tending to Ned and spots the burning wreckage.
‘I suggested Nick is one,’ Tony says before Nick can open his mouth, ‘he’s already got experience dealing with this kind of thing, and mistakes made in the past can hopefully be avoided again. He’s got the spy connections and he’s used to dealing with politicians; not to mention he seems to know where to find “enhanced individuals” before they even make themselves public.’
‘Right, got it. How’s things your end?’
‘The what protocol?’ he finishes making his coffee and leans back against the counter. This is possibly the longest conversation he’s had with this iteration of Tony’s AI, he’s only just gotten used to the fact that it’s not JARVIS anymore.
‘Since now. You want me to just cover you in bright neon fucking paint while we’re at it? Get out of here and there’s no one for them to look for.’
‘Maybe I should-’
Peter grins. ‘Deal.’
‘Sam? You alright?’ she manages to ask.
‘We weren’t
In the meantime do let me know what you think of these two chapters. I hope you continue to enjoy the story and, as always, do let me know what you think.
Tony laughs. ‘Not like you could anyway.’
Loki places a reassuring hand on Peter’s shoulder and smiles at him. ‘Let him make his own choice, Spiderling.’
‘Should I say anything?’ he questions, he’s used to avoiding these kinds of situations. He’s always stuck to his path in the future, and it sounds like that’s not what is needed in this room.
Thor interrupts them by coming over. ‘Loki he is wonderful!’ he says, bending down to look at the puppy. ‘He reminds me of Fenrir.’
‘We’re over the other side of the prison,’ Steve’s voice replies. ‘Tony what the hell is going on?’
Peter nods. ‘On one condition.’
‘The Maw is dead, as is the Cull Obsidian,’ Loki says, apparently ignoring what the alien is saying to him. ‘I know Proxima is never far from your side, Glaive. Where is she? Tell me and I shall ease your suffering.’
‘You miss Nebula don’t you Tony?’
‘Tony he needs help,’ Bruce says, cutting across whatever Thor is about to say.
‘Oh my god you’re such a moron!’ Bucky laughs from the bed. ‘Stevie you ran into Tony
‘What are you doing?’
‘Like you need to make a phone call not alright?’ Ned asks, eyes wide and looking around.
‘You need a break.’
‘Yep. Most of the missions he was on are highly classified, and I thought it best not to get JARVIS to pry. What?’ he asks at Pepper’s raised eyebrow. ‘I want to stay on his good side alright?’
‘No,’ Wanda replies, staggering to her feet, ‘but I have to.’
‘I think,’ the god of thunder replies, ‘I may have one more snap left in me.’
New Year's Eve arrives and Tony has a couple of interesting conversations before Peter and Wade take a big step in their relationship.
‘Why the sudden concern?’ Steve questions as he follows his friend out of the common area.
‘Guys? Hey where did you all get blasted to?’ Scott calls.
Bucky stays silent and continues to unpack his clothes, only now realising he’s been folding everything on his bed with military precision. Part of him is tempted to mess it all up.
Clint swallows. ‘Yeah, I’ll come part the way in now so you don’t have to come so far,’ he calls, and crawls a little further into the hole. There’s the sound of pained grunts from the other side and then Rhodes’ arms and head appear in front of him, the man in obviously considerable pain. ‘Grab onto me,’ he says, reaching forwards until their hands are linked. ‘You ready?’
Steve pauses halfway down, Natasha is a few steps behind him and Sam is still at the top by the door. As he catches sight of the soldiers Steve frowns at him. ‘What’s going on, Tony?’ his voice is cold and dangerous.
‘He and Nebula are still arguing over whether to go straight to Vormir or not apparently.’
‘We need a couple more minutes.’
‘Seriously?’
‘They doubted her loyalty.’
Natasha enters the common area the next morning, the tablet in her hand causing the worried frown on her face. She sighs with relief when she sees Tony and Steve sat at the breakfast bar with Vision, Peter’s sat in one of the chairs reading a book for school. There’s still popcorn littering the floor where they’d sat watching the two films last night. They’d only been saved watching the third by the fact that both Peter and Wanda had fallen asleep and had been carried to their rooms by Steve and Vision.
After the
‘Apparently I’m slightly better at keeping a secret than you are,’ Harry grins at him.
‘What?!?’
‘My only curse is you,’ Tony spits back at him.
‘I just wish you’d be more careful,’ is all he says as they leave the warehouse and hurry after the other two.
‘A fine idea!’ Thor booms out in laughter.
‘Stark Industries will fund it, you just tell me what you need,’ Tony says. ‘One of the things I’ve been working on is setting aside some of the money the company gives to charity in order to fund projects like this. If I set some of it aside to be from the Avengers rather than SI then you can dip into that.’
‘Of course I am,’ he winks at Peter, ‘but I’ll go easy on him, promise.’
A/N: Ok feeling slightly less guilty about missing out on a week's update for the first time ever, but still not fully gone. I am genuinely so sorry for forgetting last week.
‘Headache,’ comes Bucky’s raspy voice, ‘I’m alright. Steve get back to the prisoners.’
As always here's your sneak peek:
‘Did you,’ Tony pauses, then forces himself to carry on, ‘did you have any nightmares last night?’
Peter tries to speak around his mouthful of sandwich, but it doesn’t even make sense to him. He swallows and repeats. ‘Didn’t get chance to eat anything before I came down and I’m starving.’
‘So was I. It’s just a shame the Guardians couldn’t join us.’
‘Technically I’ve just been walking to a couple of meeting points and talking to people. It’s other people that have done most of the work. Ned and I have just been collating information and listening in on police radios. Uh-I mean-’
‘Then pack your bag for a couple of nights stay. Bring the mask if you really want to, but don’t be surprised if it goes missing. I’ll be waiting downstairs. Be there in ten minutes tops or I’m coming back up here and dragging you down. I need someone who supports the watching of Die Hard.’
‘How much longer?’ Deadpool hisses in his ear. Peter jumps, not realising the merc had gotten that close. Why does his spidey sense decide to take a holiday around the man?
‘Who’s this, kid? Your girlfriend?’ another one asks, that Peter recognises from last time.
‘Fine by me,’ Peter shrugs, ‘but I’m handing over.’ He grins and passes the cue to Wanda, setting up the balls for their game.
‘What kind of a project could you need
‘Alright I’m going to go scan the building first, then Pete I’m going to give you a spot to enter in and I need you to check the coast is clear ready for Nat to follow you. Sam and I will keep checking the outside and I’ll follow you in after.’
Rumlow stomps back into the living area, pulling Steve from his thoughts, Blake and Andrew behind him looking curious, followed by Sam who looks more than a little annoyed at being dragged out.
He knows the punch is coming, and he staggers backwards, feeling the air stir as Steve’s fist moves past his face, missing him by inches. ‘Good,’ the captain’s voice is happy, ‘try to keep steady on your feet, don’t move so much.’
‘That’s a lot of trust to place on a sixteen year old,’ Bucky observes.
‘At first it was because he reminded me of myself. Well the better parts of myself anyway. He’s smart, he’s resourceful, and he can be stubborn when he wants to do what he thinks is the right thing. Then I realised the reason he didn’t have my bad traits as well is because he also reminds me of
was I need to be checking where they are so I know if I can do things like this,’ he points to the web the merc is currently prising away from his face, ‘when you start talking shit like usual.’
This place is so monochrome it makes Colossus look like a fucking rainbow. And apparently the owner goes in for the same monochrome colours if the black hooded dress is any indication.
‘Pretty sure I took that off after we beat, Thanos,’ Tony muses. ‘FRIDAY? Why have Strange’s calls not been getting through?’
‘Did the monsters get them?’ Peter asks.
‘Yeah well as much as I love Capsicle, he isn’t exactly speaking from any kind of experience whatsoever.’ He notices the curious look Bucky tries to hide and sighs, rubbing the back of his neck. ‘How much do you know about how I became Iron Man?’
‘I should have checked,’ he whimpers. ‘I should have looked. If I had, Uncle Ben could have just picked up the victim and taken him back to his station. Instead he got shot. It should have been me-’
‘Still,’ he mutters to Karen as he catches his breath in a room of the building the showdown is currently happening in, ‘I wish they’d actually given me some kind of plan rather than just asking me to distract them. I mean I’m not exactly the greatest fan of guns.’
texted you to say he’s picking you up today and you want me to focus on Shakespeare?’ Ned whispers, casting a look at the teacher who so far hasn’t paid any attention to their conversation.
Sam jumps, putting a hand to his chest. ‘Vis you
‘Well that makes me feel a little better,’ Steve chuckles, and the sound reverberates through his chest and into Tony, making him relax even more. ‘Though if we’re going from not wanting to admit it, then I can honestly say I can’t remember a time when you got carried away explaining one of your projects when I
‘Thanks Doc,’ Peter offers him a shaky smile.
‘I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. Please Mr Stark, just hang on. Don’t go. Please.’
Wanda feels her smile grow. ‘You know what?’ she kneels down so she’s at the girl’s eye level. ‘I think you’re going to be even better.’
Love always,
‘I was not!’
The inventor shrugs. ‘Why not? Been a while since I had a nice friendly poker game.’
Just when Peter is certain his luck couldn’t get any worse he steps out of the main school doors and sees who is picking him up.
‘Well if you want to take a seat, either he or Mr Nelson with be with you-’
Peter takes a breath then nods. ‘Yeah, Mr Stark. This is going to sound strange but… my spidey-sense doesn’t go off around him.’
‘Wanda?’ Peter’s question pulls Tony and Steve from their conversation, and they see Wanda standing up, backing away from them.
The doctor looks from the folder to Bucky and back down again, and he can see the man’s face slipping into a look that Bucky knows very well and has come to term “professional worry”. Everyone seems to wear it around him. ‘What the hell has been going on here?’
‘Fine,’ is the short, strained answer. Steve thinks it’s probably best to leave them to it.
‘Is that so?’ Tony leans back in his chair, turning his attention back to Rumlow. ‘My proposition may alter that slightly.’
‘Forgive my friend,’ the first man drawls, ‘but we have information that suggests Mr Wilson knows a resident superhero, name of Spider-Man, and we’d be very interested to speak to him too.’ Peter tries to keep his breathing even so he doesn’t worry Wanda, but that last sentence has his heart pounding.
‘Punk.’
‘That too,’ Loki grins at Matt and receives one in response.
‘If you can hear me over the wind,’ Steve shouts.
It’s only as he walks down the corridor to Peter’s room, the last person he has to let know that dinner is going to be ready soon, that he realises the other thing that’s been nudging at his mind. During their whole conversation Tony hadn’t looked at him once. In fact, although they seem to talk as though everything is fine, Tony rarely looks at him when he’s talking to him. And that causes a painful twinge in his stomach.
‘Can you?’ he counters.
Loki gives him a half smile and looks at him out of the corner of his eye. ‘Some of your dream-memories came through the link.’
Tony faces his past trying to keep his team safe
‘You don’t…do you want to get rid of it?’ Bucky tries to keep his uneasiness from creeping through.
Another roar is his answer.
‘Here to give me some great big fucking speech on how I should be nicer to people?’ Bucky snaps as he senses Steve’s presence behind him.
Peter nods, apparently satisfied when FRIDAY interrupts them. ‘Boss? Miss Maximoff has just arrived at the facility. She says she’s escaped HYDRA.’
‘No, no friends you need to turn in the other direction. Otherwise we’ll be colliding during the next stage!’ Thor’s voice booms across Loki’s concentration and the trickster grimaces, looking up from his book.
‘It’s Sam,’ he says, ducking down and swinging his legs out to down his opponent.
‘No,’ he shakes his head, ‘no I don’t expect anything from you, Natasha. I came to ask for a chance.’
‘Seriously? Tony’s right you really did walk out of a Dickens novel,’ Wanda mutters.
‘Do we want to know?’ Bruce asks.
‘I’m sorry,’ Steve mutters into his hair, then leads them over to the next part of the course.
‘The fun ones,’ Valkyrie interrupts. ‘Only the fun ones.’
Peter blushes, but he’s still grinning. ‘Sure thing, Dr Banner. Can I come see you this afternoon?’
‘In the meantime,’ Natasha says from her spot on her sofa surrounded by Clint’s children, ‘we better update you on the Capture the Flag.’
‘Can I be godfather when you adopt him?’
Tony screams.
‘I understand if you don’t want to talk about it yet, Tony. But I wanted you to know that I’d worked it out and you don’t have to feel like you can’t talk about it. I promise not to use it as an excuse to try and beat up Cap during a training session.’
They finish the day playing as many silly party games as anyone can think up, and most of the adults are pretty far along the way to drunk by the time they start wrapping up.
A/N: Hi everyone. I am so so sorry I am late with posting this week, I'm afraid I have no excuse except that the jobs I had planned to do at the weekend all took far longer than I expected and it was Sunday evening before I realised where the time had gone!
Wade rubs the back of his head, and looks out of the window.
Loki knows if Thor were in this situation he would launch in with an attack as quickly as possible and try and surprise his opponent. Unfortunately he’s never had the same kind of physical strength as Thor, nor is he that comfortable fighting in this form to emulate his brother.
‘But… why didn’t you tell me?’
Wanda gives a small laugh. ‘Hello, Loki. It’s good to hear your voice.’
As always please let me know what you think and thank you so much for all the love that has been shown to this series so far. I genuinely can't believe how far this series has gone. It was just supposed to be a quick 'fix-it' story to get all the team back together - I didn't even intend re-doing Infinity War and End Game and now look at us!
‘When you two first met on the Helicarrier I could see the sparks flying, I just didn’t know if either of you would ever act on it,’ she replies, then continues with what she had been saying before. ‘You and Steve always had
‘Is the Pope Catholic?
‘Silence!’ the crack of thunder that accompanies Ororo’s voice had the arguments stopping before they even begin. ‘When the gauntlet was destroyed the stones chose vessels to go to,’ she says, once more her tone is calm, ‘I say those who the stones chose should decide their fates.’
dating life. It’s more May’s than mine.’
The tightening of the arms around him is all the answer he needs.
‘Neither did I,’ he admits. ‘But Peter looked so down when he was talking about him spending it alone, I couldn’t
It makes it easier to say the truth, even if he doesn’t reveal all of it, when he doesn’t have to look at them. What did surprise him was the second evening they did this and Steve brought down his sketch book, arguing that if Tony was allowed to do something to make him feel more comfortable then the rest of them should to make it easier. And Tony had to admit, tinkering with bits and pieces whilst Steve sketched on his pad, and Bucky and Sam sat on the sofa with cups of coffee, it made it easier to talk. They didn’t often ask questions, and if he said no to answering one they didn’t push him.
‘Same time he did everyone else. I hoped whining enough would get him to leave me alone, unfortunately it didn’t work.’
He’s pulled out of his thoughts by the sound of his name being spoken through the door he’s stood outside.
‘But I didn’t get a turn!’ Tony pouts.
‘I don’t think they’re leaving,’ Steve says.
fond of Peter. Apart from Venom.
‘That would all be included in those parts of the Accords relevant to you I mentioned earlier,’ Nick reassures him. ‘Should you need help you will be able to contact the team and we can arrange for a part, or even the whole, of the Avengers to be with you to help. Any of the other resources at our disposal would also be available to you.’
The boy looks up at him, tears streaming down his face. Tony reaches up with his hand and wipes away some of the tears with him thumb. ‘I don’t care what you say to me, Peter Parker, I’d take your place in a situation like that any day. You understand me?’
‘Thanks Daredevil,’ he says, sliding the paper over to Deadpool who reads it carefully. ‘I owe you big time.’
‘And what would that be?’
. We’re never going to be free of them, Nat, even Steve knows that although he doesn’t want to admit it; but don’t let them take away this chance to celebrate what we still have.’
‘Hold it. You’re only telling me this
‘Shut up,’ Peter mutters, knowing he’s turning bright red.
He notices Wanda lean forwards and say something in Peter’s ear, the kid nods and manages to look a little less pale. The atmosphere in the room is still a little tense as everyone seems unsure of what to do next.
She laughs. ‘Clint did, and slept for some of it, but I’m not used to the jets so didn’t get much shut eye.’
‘As you command, my king,’ the voice responds.
‘He means Peter hung up on him before answering,’ Wanda explains. ‘It’s called ghosting when you stop taking calls and messages from someone when there’s no apparent reason behind it.’
‘Who are you?’ Wanda demands, finding her courage as her rage returns.
‘And you, T’Challa,’ he gives the king the Wakandan salute.
‘Yeah well having a fully functioning brain can do that to a guy,’ he replies, then grins. ‘Plus getting all the embarrassing growing up stories about Tony from Rhodey helps.’
Peter laughs, and pulls the merc into a tight hug. ‘Thanks, Pool.’ They’ve hugged before, many times when they’ve been fooling about after patrol, but this one feels different. It feels like, in the course of this conversation, they’ve crossed a bridge, and Peter’s not entirely sure which one it was.
‘The right to rule,’ the Jotun smirks. ‘I suppose I should not be surprised you do not recognise me, Laufeyson. But then this is not the way I perhaps should have greeted you…
Tony looks round at everyone, then he laughs and puts his hands up. ‘Alright, alright. Let’s do it. Let’s go to the house and start our own DIY project. Someone going to tell Scott and Hope to head back there and open it up again?’
Strange smirks. ‘No, Wong has been called back to Kamar-Taj. Apparently some of the new students have created an issue in the library, and as the temple’s librarian Wong has to go and sort it out. I pity the students, it wouldn’t surprise me if he turns
. He’s
‘All of the team, we’ve got Tony, Steve and Natasha listed as our next of kin,’ Rhodes explains, ‘in case anything happens.’
Harry scoffs. ‘Like I give a shit what that guy thinks. I missed you, Pete, and no one talks to my best friend like that.’
‘Pull up a chair,’ Tony pulls the one out next to him and Peter sits down, pushing the sleeves of what looks to be one of Wade’s hoodies up over his elbows as Tony and Bucky begin explaining the rules to him.
Peter shrugs. ‘My guess would be Redwing, but I’ve not found any proof yet. Hey Shuri? Can you keep my new project quiet for now please? Just until I’ve worked out what I want to take to Miss Potts.’
Peter just reaches down and takes hold of the young boy’s arms, pulling him up against his chest so he can look around the room. ‘This is so awesome!’ the boy shouts, making Peter wince at the volume.
‘Doctor Banner is taking me through equations,’ Peter explains, not taking his laser focus away from the scientist, ‘it’s keeping him non-green.’
Really there’s no competition, Wade thinks as he kisses Peter again, burying the fingers of one hand in the teen’s hair and pulling him closer. ‘You’re going to be the death of me,’ he says when they pull away.
