“He doesn't have to, I mean, it's his place right? I don't want to impose.” He's hesitant to just move into a veritable stranger's place, but Jan just shakes her head.
“You did no such thing. You were quite cuddly in fact.” JARVIS sounds so pleased that his world is ending.  Tony is going to scream.
“Wha-” He gasps out when Tony sits back, taking most of that lovely heat and the warmth of his body with him.
“Hey.” Steve says, smiling when Tony passes him a bottle of the sweet lambic beer he hates but Steve has come to love.
“Steve!” Tony grabs his shoulders, fingers digging into the sleek fabric. “Steve, breathe, breathe, I'm right here, I'm here with you. I'm oh god, I'm sorry, I didn't know you felt that way, Jesus, fuck.”
Instead, when they arrived back at the mansion, he made to walk down towards the training room, only to be stopped by Tony.
“That so?” Steve doesn't sound convinced at all, what a blow to the ego.  Tony shifts on Steve's lap, about to launch into a speech when Steve reaches up and rubs the back of his neck just where the ends of his-getting-too-long hair begin to curl. Not fair. Tony goes boneless, dropping his head against Steve's shoulder and shutting his eyes. Strong thumbs press against the tendons in his neck, and Tony resists moaning by sheer willpower alone.
he wants to say
“Yesss..” Tony hisses out on an exhale, spreading his thighs wider on the mattress, offering himself up. Steve holds him there, one hand set on the small of his back, tipping his hips up and pushing his fingers in deep. So deep that it presses him down into the mattress, makes him gasp and hide his face in the pillows, makes his hands claw on the sheets when those fingers twist inside him just so to rub against his prostate. Tony bucks as best as he can with Steve holding him there, his toes curl, legs kicking when Steve taps at his prostate, then rubs there in slow circles-perfect pressure that makes his eyes roll back and the breath stutter in his chest. There's more lube drizzling over him, being fucked into him, wet, and slick, and sloppy, but Tony doesn't care. It feels so good. Letting Steve have what he wants always feels good, and Steve is always so careful. Even when he's rougher than usual, he never hurts Tony, not in a way he doesn't love at any rate.
Tony just can't deal with that.  “Steve are you out of your mind?” He mutters, grabbing Steve by the front of his uniforms and planting a kiss on him that they both feel in their toes.  “I love it, I love your gifts okay. You could give me a fucking-” Tony flails for words, stealing another kiss when Steve seems at a loss too. “Singing fish. You could give me one of those stupid singing fish and I would still love it. Because it's from
this. No sweat.
“Quiet Shellhead, think of the children.” He says, angling his chin in Sam's direction.
“You ransoming me now?” Steve says, but he crawls up on the bed and leans in, trapping Tony beneath him where he's bundled in the covers. Tony wriggles his other arm out from beneath them and pulls Steve down. The first touch of their lips is soft, and it stays that way, presses of their mouths between shared breaths. Steve sinks down over him, tracking kisses over his cheeks, his jaw, the bridge of his nose, and then back to his mouth. Tony feels hot beneath the covers, burning up, just from the way Steve feels over him, kissing him like this.
He finds himself in the gym later that day, and he stays until JARVIS all but kicks him out.
As nice as that had been, the way he’d curled around Steve afterward had been almost as nice.  The warmth of another person, the steadiness of his breathing, Steve’s body had synced to it, and he’d slept well that night for once.  He’d even made breakfast for them in the morning, what a guy.
As he thought on it more, something dawned on him. Between the horrible drop after what happened with Amora and Executioner, and everything after, a matter of great importance slipped his mind. Zemo was still out there, running around free and a real and present danger to anyone unlucky enough to encounter him. There was no doubt in Steve’s mind, that the lousy sock faced bastard would turn up again like some kind of nasty fungus. He would put Steve’s team in danger, if he were allowed to plan unopposed until his trap could be sprung. Zemo could always be trusted to be too ambitious for his own good, and too spiteful to leave something alone even when his goose was cooked. He would attack the team again, and that was just unacceptable. He was one of Steve’s villains, and truth be told, he wanted nothing more than to take the rat bastard out himself.
“Mmm.”  It wasn’t really a word, just sounds, all he could manage.  He turned into Tony’s touches.  His hands felt so warm, his fingertips like little points of light filling him with a lazy contentment he had never experienced.  Steve let out a long exhalation, and finally let himself sink into a deep dreamless sleep.
“I don't recognize this place.”
“Heimdall, open the Bifrost, I call you to banish this creature into the dark.” Thor calls, drawing their attention from each other. Out of the corner of his eye, Steve sees Iron Man press a gauntleted hand over his chest. The comm line is silent from his end, Steve feels concern well up, a question on the tip of his tongue, when the other Avengers scatter back as a blinding flash of light fills the clearing. The monster rears up, voice cacophonous and deafening as it's torn away from the Earth in a dazzling display of light and sound. When it's gone only a great ring of twisting runes remains.
“Hi.” Tony says dumbly when Steve tugs his hands out of his pockets by the wrists.
Steve groans, pushing Tony's thighs apart to settle his hips between Tony's lean muscular legs, and leaning down to seal their lips together again. Tony is a generous lover, that's an understatement. He had brought Steve off three times just a short time ago; fucking him with such perfect skill that Steve felt half delirious by the end. Steve's never been particularly shy, but Tony makes it so easy to let slip things-desires he would never share with another person. He seems delighted when Steve initiates anything, throwing himself so wholeheartedly into their mutual pleasure that Steve sometimes wonders if this thing between them is all a fantasy. He's taken to pinching himself now and then, when they lay there sated and lazily wrapped up in each other.
“No sir, they appear to have merely dropped off an envelope, nothing was taken, but there was nothing gleaned from biometric scans.” There are precious few people who know how to get around Tony's biometric readers. One was upstairs eating Thor's meatballs the last time he saw her, the other he used to call a friend.
“Not silly, I always want you to tell me when you want things. Do you even know how hot it is when you look at me like you can't get enough?” Tony's voice has gone deeper, dropping an octave as he whispers encouragement against Steve's lips. “You want me so badly, don't you darling, tell me about it, I can't go again, but you can, c'mon baby.”
“Oh no.” Tony whispers to himself, expression becoming more and more sheepish the closer Steve approaches. Steve is about to ask why his presence is making Tony so uncomfortable when his entire face scrunches up and he lets out a painful sounding sneeze. Steve freezes in his tracks.
“Yeah but...uh, most people they don't see this kind of stuff as art. I mean it
“Well now, you beat me to it.”  Tony laughs, sprawling out further on his back in a way that can only be described as decadent.  The robe sleeves are bunched around his elbows, the red silk creased beneath him where he lays on it, and when Tony reaches down, hooking a hand beneath his knee and pulling it up almost to his chest, Steve groans low in his throat.  “Do you like that, hmm? I know how you like me messy. Look, honey, I'm all full of you,” And it's true, positioned like this, Steve can see everything-Tony's hole looks soft and open, wet with Steve's come, and it's so hot Steve can't help but whine to see it.  Tony is so red, but he still reaches down with his other hand, spreads himself wider for Steve to get a good look.
Tony swallows visibly, but soon his eyes are slipping shut again as Steve runs his fingers through his dark tangled hair. He doesn't fall as deeply asleep as before, but he dozes on and off until lunch rolls around. His squawk of affront is absolutely worth the jab to the side when Steve rolls him up in the blankets and carries his squirming package into the kitchen.
The twenty fourth rolls around more quickly than Steve anticipated. The villains have been more active than usual, and Steve has been thrown at Tony so many times that the armor now has a Fetch Cap protocol-Steve knows that's what it's called, he's heard Tony talking about it to JARVIS. Tony seems unconcerned by all of this however; thoroughly decking the tower out in more decorations than Steve has ever seen. It's impressive, as are the ridiculous hats he passes out to the Avengers after using their communicators to call them all down to one of the common areas.
“Your mama helped keep my Mia alive during the Spanish flu, bambino, it is not charity.”  Lorenzo’s tone brooked no further arguments.  Steve hadn’t known that, Sarah had never said.
“Very good sir, shall I begin drawing up drafts?”
“The suit's just a fancy tin can without you in it Shellhead, the pilot makes the plane, and you're an amazing pilot, so I'm gonna say it again. Don't devalue yourself.”
, he realized.  All of these seemingly innocuous office workers had a gun under their desk.
All too soon Tony turns away, arm sliding back under his sweatshirt anew. His hand makes an indistinct lump below the fabric, pressing tightly to his chest. He curls inwards, sweatshirt riding up to expose the edge of his hip, the beginning of his ribs. Steve tries not to look, but his eyes snap to the skin upon seeing something odd.
“Sweetheart?” Tony repeats dumbly, Steve's answering smile is small and intimate in the shifting light of the television.
“Yeah, I'd like that, like that a lot.” He breathes out.  Tony smiles, taking his hand by the wrist and walking backwards towards the entrance to the gym. He's still flushed attractively, mouth reddened by kisses, and when he turns around to lead Steve up to his room, Steve can't help but let his gaze drop down to admire the backside he's been covertly ogling for quite some time now. Tony hums, smirking at him over his shoulder, clearly having caught on to what Steve is up to.
“The something blue is the lingerie, but you're the something old, just in case you were wondering.” Tony sounds all too pleased with himself, grinning when Steve leans back to stare at him in equal parts arousal and amusement. Steve kisses him, crushing their mouths together before he can say anything else terrible and enticing.
“So what are we watching?” He asks, eyes widening slightly when Steve plops himself on the couch and then winds him in close when Tony sits too. Steve lets go of his hands, but throws an arm across his shoulders to pull him close. It's almost as if Steve is afraid that Tony will run off if he stops touching him.
There's whine in those words, and a demand, but Steve ignores it, circling the plug with his fingers again, then grasping it to slowly, tortuously draw it out. He lets Tony's body close up behind it, eyes raking over the red, red slash of the thong stretched over Tony's skin, Tony's fingers digging dents into the flesh of his firm asscheek as he holds himself open, his mouth is bitten red, brown eyes hazy as he glares at Steve over his shoulder. Those eyes drop shut, and a shaky moan falls from Tony's lips when he works the plug back inside him, thrusting it slowly, and angling it down to press against his prostate.
“Tony, please-” He gasps, pressing his heels into the mattress, clutching at the covers as Tony swallows him down almost to the base. Tony's breath fans out over Steve's abdomen, and when he looks down the flushed length of his body, Tony is looking right back at him, eyes focused and intent. When he notes he's being watched, he deliberately swallows around Steve's cock. It feels incredible, all that wet heat, the look of Tony's mouth stretched obscenely wide around him. Steve moans, feeling overwhelmed, so good already, just with Tony's mouth on him like this. Tony's hands aren't idle either. They stroke over his thighs, scratch blunt nails down his stomach leaving goosebumps in their wake, and finally slip between his legs to spread them out further. Steve can feel himself panting harder, going hotter, but he spreads his legs wide for Tony, clutching at the sheets to keep from sinking his fingers into the damp tousle of Tony's hair. “Gonna come if you, if you keep that up.” He manages to get out, his voice sounds strained, feels as if it's coming from far away. Tony pauses though, slipping off of his cock and licking his lips, blue eyes fixed on Steve's face.
“I had my plans darling, thought I’d sit on the best seat in the house and we could share.”  Tony leans in for a brief kiss, which Steve melts into happily. Tony’s hands are cool on his face from holding the chilled bowls, but his mouth is scorching hot, perfect in every way.  He pulls away all to soon, and Steve grunts in dissatisfaction. “Darling I can’t feed you dessert if we’re kissing.” Tony says, affection coloring the words as he reaches into one bowl, pulling a ripe red strawberry from within, before dipping it in the other bowl.  He brings it to Steve’s lips after that, gaze hooding when Steve licks the cream from his fingertips before eating the proffered fruit.
He shrugs, crawling out from beneath his hiding spot, only to come face to face with Steve. “Oh shhh-sneaky! You're way too big to move that quietly.” He exclaims, but Steve just smiles, reaching out to pick a feather out of his hair.
His other belongings arrived just a few hours later, boxes of letters, art supplies not seen since he packed them away in the forties, and most importantly, a few pictures of his dad encased in the same museum grade glass Sarah’s portrait was in. He sat down on the bed for hours, reading letters and holding back his tears. There were countless letters calling him a hero, many of them dated long past when he’d gone into the ice. There were even a few from Russell, apologizing for all the mess when they were kids, telling him he would be a fine protector for a lucky omega or beta someday. There were letters from the De Rossi’s too, praising him and telling him how much they missed him, along with little cards full of recipes for him to make one day when he found himself a nice partner or partners to settle down with. They knew he couldn’t cook his way out of a wet paper bag, but rut always made him want to provide food regardless of his skill level. Nonna had even sent him a stovetop espresso maker, with a long note in Italian telling him American coffee was nonsense. Steve wiped his eyes with the back of his hand and smiled the best he could with how much his lips were trembling. God if they could see him now in this big fancy mansion.
“You don't want to come and eat something, maybe get some rest?” Steve asks softly, carefully, and Tony feels something bitter and ugly curl up in his chest. He regards Steve from the corner of his eye, head tipped back against fine leather, and the words just rise out of him hopeless and bitter and poisonous.
“Namor!”  He called, “What are you doing?”  His question met no answer however, and Namor himself seemed to look past Steve, through him.  That wasn’t right at all.  Namor had always been a bad tempered kind of fella, self assured (and boy Bucky would have had something to say about that assessment) but the look he turned on Steve was more hostile than any he had ever seen from him.
He has no idea how long they spend wrapped up in each other in an abandoned SHIELD room, but Tony thinks he may have left his sanity somewhere in the perfect curl of Steve's tongue against his. Actually, that's a lie, not the part about the sanity, but the part about not knowing how much time has passed. Barring kidnapping and caves, Tony has a really unfortunate grasp on the passage of time, an unpleasant consequence of having a mind that just never stops. Still, while kissing other people he's designed entire aircraft carriers, with Steve it's all he can do to keep a handle on what time it is. Tony had thought Steve might be experienced before, but he takes that supposition and tosses that out the window.  Steve is a super learner after all, and it seems he's taken that ability and applied it to making this possibly the best kiss Tony's ever had.  The man is
“A cat?” Tony asks, already walking towards the source of the sound.
about this before, this is not just a sex thing.” Rhodey goes quiet for a moment, and Tony vibrates with tension in the interim.  “It's not just a sex thing is it? Do not. Do not make that face, I can see you. Stop doing that thing with the eyes and the drooping.” Rhodey sounds fondly exasperated despite himself. Tony has enough experience with Rhodey-speak to know when to press his advantage. Tony hangs his head and puts on an expression he hopes conveys a message of '
It all came to a head one afternoon during an Avengers alert.  They were fighting two of Thor’s countrymen.  Amora the Enchantress, who was both beautiful and dangerous, and Executioner, who he guessed was there to cheer her on and punch things.  He supposed it was a job.
come by and try to throw me in a van, but I know he hired the guys that made the attempt. They didn't count on me knowing how to defend myself, or Iron Man being nearby for that matter. Thanks for the save by the way.” Tony says blithely, saluting JARVIS with his glass before continuing to speak before Steve can give voice to the anger bubbling up within himself. “Two weeks prior to the attempt he pulled me aside at a party, and let his freak flag fly so to speak. He uh..confessed to me, gave me a whole speech about how we could be powerful together. It was very super villainous, and villainy doesn't really turn me on, you know? Apparently he didn't get that memo.”
How long has it been since he has allowed anyone to touch him? Really touch him? Not casual pats on the shoulder or a handshake. Tony closes his eyes, trying to imagine what it felt like to be wrapped up in Steve's arms. Even on the screen it looked nice. Tony shakes his head free of the images, dismissing the screen now playing footage of him passed out dead to the world. There's no use in dwelling on it, it's never going to happen again.
He's around Steve's age, wearing a perfectly pressed charcoal gray suit. The jacket is tossed across one of the couches haphazardly. His hair is dark and styled immaculately. Dark lashes frame honey colored eyes, he's shorter than Steve, smaller framed but not thin, with a fastidiously trimmed van dyke.
“Thank you Mister Stark, that's really. Just thanks for everything.” He rakes a hand through his hair self consciously, but Stark waves the thanks off, staring fixedly at the glowing light once again in his hand. He takes off after that, spinning equations and talking to JARVIS at a rate so fast all Steve understands is that he doesn't understand it.
“Ah friend Anthony, I did not know you were fond of these.” Thor says with a broad smile.
“What, we're married? Well that's unexpected but not entirely out of the realm of possibilities since I do think you're way too attractive, actually all three of you are scary hot, and wow I said that out loud.” Cap looks like he doesn't know how to react to that statement, but his cheeks turn a pretty endearing shade of pink beneath his blue cowl.
“Sure, sure thing fella, I’ll be right back.”  He said, turning to very purposefully leave the kitchen.  As soon as the doors swung shut behind him, he ran to his room, afraid if he was any slower his better sense would kick in and his nerve would fizzle out.
“Oh my god.” Tony whispers.
Above the fray, Iron Man made a loop, and then called a pool shot, before lining up and blasting the Moloids trying to climb up into the stands back.  The crowd cheered.  There was a moloid trying to crawl up his leg.  It let out a horrible caterwauling sound, and he spun, kicking the little creature off in a high wide arc.  He didn’t stop to watch where it landed, but he heard the announcer yell ‘Field goal!’, and saw screens pop up with the refs calling it.  Over the comms Tony was laughing.
“You...you lying rat, that was
“Only if need be, now if you will-” Jarvis says primly. Steve smiles, crouching down next to Stark at a good distance if he throws a punch. He recognizes the careful wording of JARVIS' instructions for what they are. Men back in the war coming back hollow eyed and jumping at shadows could have benefited form having their own JARVIS around. He doesn't doubt that Mister Stark could land a solid punch.  He is smaller than Steve, but he's fit, compact and well muscled with a mean right hook if the stories about his boxing training are to be believed. Steve has seen him carting around enough heavy Avengers gear to know he's certainly no slouch. It just makes him want to be even more careful. JARVIS is trusting him with a lot.
“Yes, so many
“I’ve seen him in ah, pictures with gloves but, I haven’t even given him a letter of intent yet, seems a little premature.”  He said, but still reached down to touch one of the gloves, it was a velvet burnout lace, fine and probably handcrafted.  Wedded gloves were made of silk, often with the fingers exposed or the fingertips capped with precious metal.  Steve imagined Tony wearing something like that and felt himself flush red.
“The reactor.” Steve starts.  Iron Man hums, scanning over his injured arm again.
Widow climbed into the front seat of the car and spread her fingers over glowing dials, she was nice enough not to mention the scent of badly in need of a bath alpha that must have been wafting off of him.  There was no steering wheel, of course there wasn’t.  It was all beautiful, glowing technology, and he was lost, not in space, but in time.
“You're going to love this,” Tony freezes, he shakes his head, continuing on with just as much excited steam, “or uh, I hope you do. Anyway, JARVIS, activate WINGI45 protocol please.” He throws up dual peace signs, and JARVIS takes that as his cue to open a sliding door off to the side of Tony's work station. A tall robot with a pincer wearing a party hat comes rolling out. It's holding a very heavy looking hanger, and hanging from that is-
Tony would like to paint the universe a giant sign, and that sign would say '
He knows it's not possible that he heard Bucky's heartbeat over the charging of the train when he fell. Fast too fast, battering like a terrified bird in cage. He knows it's not possible, and yet.
Jan finds him there, curled against the wall with the flowers in his lap, hugging them close and staring out at nothing. “They're from Steve right?” Jan says brightly, but her approach is cautious. Tony doesn't blame her, he probably looks like a mess right now. Jan is an old friend though, she's seen much worse from him.
“I want you Tony, so much, anything you're willing to give me, even if that means this is all we do today.”  Steve says, almost before Tony can finish his sentence.  Tony stares up at him, shivering when Steve traces around the round edge of the reactor. “But if you're offering, then yeah, I'd love to.” That Tony would even offer is something Steve had not anticipated. Not that he thought Tony would be particularly shy, but he had not counted on Tony wanting this as badly as he does.
“No, darling, not yet. I would dearly love for you to touch me, I always do, but, that is not the name of the game today.” Tony smiles, urging Steve further back on the bed, climbing up over him, rubbing over Steve's bottom lip with his thumb. The soft silk of his robe brushes all along Steve's skin where it hangs open, and he shivers, willing himself not to reach up, grab two handfuls of that robe and pull Tony down against him. “That is if you want it, but I'd like a clear yes from you. You remember your colors, don't you, tesoro?”
“Steve, listen to me okay,” Tony squeezed his shoulders, leaned in close, “I want you to come to me, if you need it, even if you don’t need it, if you’re just kind of having a crap day. Come to me before it gets so bad you look like you’re dead on your feet. Please.”
He should have known Tony would be right. He can almost hear him, see him in the lab, half turned towards Steve with a grin of self satisfied triumph.
that-but the mental image is compelling to say the least. Compelling and distracting as Steve soon finds. Tossing and turning on the bed feeling hot all over with want was not how he planned the events of this evening. Steve glares down in the direction of his persistent arousal as if that will help. It's either ignore it, or do something about it. Steve knows enough about his own anatomy to not want to deal with the latter. One time will turn into two or three, and then he'll end up sticky and guilty in the shower. The pattern has already been established.
It's an odd disconnect for a man with the reputation he has. Then again Steve lives with him, it's all one big long front. Steve is just happy he gets to see behind the curtain. He really likes the wizard hiding back there.
“Still up?” Steve asks, Tony jumps slightly, levering himself up on the pillows to blink tiredly over at where he stands in the doorway.
“Couldn't sleep. Broke another punching bag-sorry.” He mumbles sheepishly.  Tony just laughs, leaning back to look at his face searchingly.
Falcon, Wasp, and Thor remain airborne, calling out locations and dropping down where Steve sends them. Iron Man is on Steve's unshielded left putting on a laser light show and shooting off repulsor blasts. A lucky shot earlier rent a hole in Steve's uniform. Iron man seems to have taken that as a personal affront and has been muttering on and off about flimsy material and risk taking behavior. Steve doesn't think the man is even aware of his own continuous ranting. Nonetheless Steve appreciates the cover as well as the concern.
Zemo had goons all over the island, but they were clearly not expecting company. He found the first group of them playing cards around a fire. Even in the semi darkness of early dawn, rut and the serum made them all but glow to his eyes. On another day, another time, with different villains he might have made his presence known, made it a fair fight, but this was different. He didn’t owe any respect to the kind of people who would ally themselves with someone like Zemo. Still, he didn’t kill them, standing over their unconscious forms, he was certain the concussions would be deterrent enough. Besides, given the opportunity to raise the alarm, he was certain Zemo might turn tail. For all his bluster and talk of his superiority, the man was a coward at heart.
“Hey there, my sweet, beautiful guy, you with me?” Tony murmurs, and Steve just smiles, still not wanting to open his eyes.
“Shellhead, cut it out, it's not about what he does for us, for me. I just.” Steve looks embarrassed, but he clears his throat and carries on. “I don't have any illusions. Guy like him could go spend dinner with anyone he pleased. I'm sure he has little book full of names, I was just hoping he would like to. Spend time with me that is. Do you think-” Steve licks his lips, looking away. Tony can't tear his eyes away.  “Do you think he would want to?” He asks quietly, as if rejection is even an option. He supposes before he got jacked on super steroids that little Steve got rejected a whole hell of a lot. Tony feels a sudden rush of protectiveness overcome him. Scrawny Pre-Serum Steve Rogers had still been a looker, and no one should make Captain America look sad. Tony still feels like he needs a glass of whiskey in his hand rather than the cold remnants of his green shake though.
He streaks out of the mansion as quickly and stealthily as he can, which means no going supersonic. What a shame. Still, he allows himself some indulgent loops in the air, as he guns it all the way to Seattle. The trip takes far less time when encased in a super powered armor rather than a jet, although it is nice to have a bed to sleep on in said jet. He wishes he could take Steve flying like this. With nothing pressing over their heads', or a mission to complete. Steve is such an adrenaline junkie, he would probably love it.
“I love you.” Steve says, his thumb rubbing in a distracting circle over the small of Tony's back. “You better believe it sweetheart.”
“Call me Steve off the field, I’m only Cap out there.”  They were so close, Their eyes met and held, and Steve felt his heart rate jump up just with that look.
“Stark industries-The Maria Stark Foundation is holding a fundraising gala to funnel money into clean water services for communities around the globe.  We will match any donations made to the foundation through S.I., I'm not an Avenger, but I like to think I can make some kind of difference-it doesn't make up for what I-” Tony stops when Steve reaches out to tip his chin up so their eyes meet.
“I don’t know.” Tony whispers, standing with his feet in the sand. The surf breaks over his ankles, soaks the legs of his trousers. “I think it feels like drowning.”
His mind seems to be stuck in a loop of confusion.
over the desk.” Steve is proud of the frankness of his own voice, even if he feels the tips of his ears warm. Tony lifts his head, eyes wide as he gapes at him, setting his phone aside, and sliding further up his body to press their lips together in a slow lingering kiss.
“We watched a movie together, I got to cuddle you, which was really great. I want to do that some more soon if you'll let me. I thought it was a pretty nice date, but I'd like to take my fella out somewhere too.” One of these days Steve is really going to cause him to short circuit out of sheer confusion.  Tony stares at him utterly gobsmacked. His brain just doesn't ever seem to want to work right around Steve. This is not happening.
Rhodes sighs, he seems more resigned than on guard now. "Godspeed, soldier, I hope you know what you're doing."
“Tony-” He laughs, dropping his head to rest on Tony's shoulder, drawing his hand away to thumb over one of Tony's nipples until it pebbles beneath his touch. Maybe Tony is right after all.
“We'll talk later. Well, I'd like to.” Steve says, turning away to go buckle into his own seat beside Tony, taking his hand in one wide palm; thumb rubbing small soothing circles over scarred knuckles. Tony just nods, even though he wants to rip his harness off to climb up into his lap, and tell him just how mutual the feeling is.
“Oh? Not even the Captain of America, should he make the offer in sincerity?” Steve can
When he walks into S.I. Pepper is waiting for him. She smiles, bumping her shoulder against his while they walk to R & D.
The first time they share a bed it's a bit of an accident. A mission calls for them to camp out in the Arizona desert, far from any towns or reasonable camp sites. Why Asgardian's love popping up in desolate areas Steve will never know-it's not as if they're hiding their presence any longer. Still Thor was adamant that his friend would be arriving sooner rather than later, so they set up to wait.
“Yeah, you need Taxi service Mister Stark?” Cheeky. Tony smiles, sighing when Steve runs his fingers through his hair and bends to kiss his forehead.
“That's your plan?” Steve grits out. Tony tips his head back, jaw jutting stubbornly as he meets his gaze dead on.
“Steve, I will absolutely teach you how to make something other than boiled potatoes, my god, what have you been eating?” Tony sounds more than a little scandalized, but he doesn't resist when Steve winds him in to steal a kiss.  His mouth tastes like red wine and dark berries, warm and sweet and hot, Tony's tongue curling around his when the kiss deepens. His skin is warm, so warm when Steve slips his hands beneath the opening in his shirt that Steve feels he’ll never be cold again. The smell of him, hot metal, cinnamon and expensive cologne, wraps around his senses, and he chases that scent with his lips, mouthing along Tony's jaw until he can rub his nose just behind one ear where he helped Tony dab cologne the last time they were together. Tony sighs, leaning into his touch for a few moments before the growling of Steve's stomach interrupts their moment with a loud complaint.
“Might I direct you to the bouquet approximately three steps to your right and ten steps forward. The one with the red Camellias and orange roses.”
“I-” Steve clears his throat, tugging Tony more fully against his body, stilling those wandering hands.  “I wanna go to bed Stark, that's what-what I want.”
“Wow.” Is all he can get out. The schematic is
“Guys, hate to interrupt you, but, the press approaches.”  Jan said, growing to her regular size.  She went to hang off of hank, dragging him over to smile winningly at the approaching photographers.
“I...have to-” Then he's up, staggering through the garden and banging through the outer doors to stumble into a bathroom. Dimly he's aware of Steve having followed him into the room, but that seems unimportant compared to making it to his destination. He has a moment to think
Tony strolls in five days later as if he never left. His hands are full, tech glasses across his nose, a tablet in each hand, and tiny little glowing lights peek out from inside his ears. JARVIS is having a discussion with him that is moving too quickly for Steve to follow, but he catches the words “New material” and “fucking tights” and he just knows Tony is talking smack about his uniform.
“If you go to sleep I'll go to sleep. Deal?” Tony drives a hard bargain, but the thought of both of them sleeping at the same time in rooms just down the hall from one another makes the sappy romantic Steve really is at heart perk up and take notice.
_________________________________________________________________
“Gimme the stylus, I'll show you.” Tony says, putting his shake down on the coffee table to free up his hand. Steve silently passes it over, watching raptly as Tony makes a complicated motion with the fingers of his other hand. Little light nodes glimmer on his palm, the hologram expands to fill the room, and Steve sucks in a shocked breath.
date. Most people would have jumped on what he was offering without a second thought. He guesses that's his problem. Steve's not like anyone else. It's as confusing as it is the sweetest thing anyone has ever offered him.
“Sometimes.” Tony says softly, one hand going up to press at his chest. “Sometimes even Kevlar isn't enough."
“I’m not givin’ you the purse, I don’t know what’s wrong with all of you, but it’s not mine to give away.”  The nerve of the guy, thinking he could pay Steve off, like he was some kind of lousy cheat who’d give away someone else’s property like that.  It was a lot of money, and sure Steve needed it, but he’d made do without it, and he’d keep making doing do.
Iron man sighs, turning to face him and scanning over the arm with a glittering network of lights. He tsks. “Not good.” Iron Man murmurs and Steve grunts, looking down at the arm in question, even through the padding of his uniform it's clearly at the wrong angle. Adrenaline is still high, but it's still incredibly painful, he knows if he allows time to pass it will only get worse. Steve has set bones in worse places before, this is going to hurt though. “Gonna need to apply traction to that but I've got some painkillers in here.” Iron Man starts opening up flaps, producing a thin syringe from god knows where and manipulating it surprisingly gently between metal clad fingers. Steve can read the label on it from where he's standing.
That was where Tony found him, sometime after midnight.  He was still partially in his suit, but his ritzy dress shoes were off and in their place was a pair of bunny slippers.  He shuffled over, dropping into the seat across from Steve and pushing a deck of cards towards him.
He began painting her that night.  The canvas was the largest he could afford, the paints limited by his budget as well.  He painted her as he remembered her, as the smiling, larger than life figure in his life.  The truest model of what an alpha should be, in her brilliant starched white nursing dress.  It took days, but the look on her face when she opened her eyes and saw it was worth the sleepless nights, and the constant paint stains on his fingers.  It was the last time they spoke, the last time he saw her alive.
“Very well, but you must listen closely. I am placing a great deal of trust in you Captain Rogers.” JARVIS begins crisply, but there is an unspoken warning there too.  Steve feels like he's getting a very high tech shovel talk, but he nods all the same.  “Call to him first before even attempting to touch. Speak with him as you move him. No sudden movements. When you place him in his room, the lights will stay on. If he becomes agitated set him down and do not stand over him.” The words are clear, concise, but Steve's not stupid. JARVIS is worried.
When Steve manages to crack his eyes open again, Tony looks up at him and winks, before laying down on his side between his legs as if he's decided to take up residence there. The robe pools over Tony's hip, and Tony grabs the corner of it, and wraps the red silk around his own cock, stroking himself once and giving a slow rolling thrust into his own silk covered hand. At the same time that hot wet mouth slides further down, and Tony moans around him. Tony wants him to see, has probably noticed how Steve watches him when he's all draped in luxurious fabrics and a little mussed. He's so shameless; and just amazing, and Steve can't contain the sounds of pleasure he makes, or tear his eyes away as Tony touches himself in slow languid strokes.
“Alright, I have quite a bit of experience helping out with that type of thing.”  She stood, her arms were stacked high with velvet trays full of a king’s ransom worth of jewels.  “If you’re not sure, it’s probably best to avoid bracelets, collars, rings can even be tricky, depending on how married to looking like an alpha your fair friend is.”  She separated a few of the trays away, the ones containing slender diamond encrusted chokers, and a few more substantial looking ones.  Steve flushed, a necklace was a
“So eager, my darling, I'm glad.”  Tony reaches for him when he crawls closer, curling his fingers in blond hair and giving it a light tug that makes Steve gasp.
He takes me to places
Steve grunts, patting around the bed to find Tony's pillow, pulling it over and squashing his face into it.  Tony's pillowcases are silk. It always seems like a tremendously unnecessary thing, but right now the cool fabric feels amazingly decadent against his skin.  So does lounging around in bed like this. Steve thinks Tony might like it if he indulged himself a little, and he does always say Steve never rests. How long has it been since he slept so well?  Since the last time he and Tony spent the night together, he knows that without really having to think about it. Here laying in Tony's huge bed, getting up to start the day is so much less pressing.  Maybe if he goes back to sleep Tony will join him again. Maybe he'll kiss him some more. Steve feels himself turning red at just the thought and clutches his stolen pillow closer, breathing in Tony's scent on the silk, and resolving to go back to sleep.
With a sigh of resignation he pulls the covers up, tucking them around Tony and pressing a comforting hand to his shoulder. Backtracking to the sitting room he gathers up the tablets left there to bring them into Tony's room. No telling what sort of confidential stuff is on those things.
“If you let him go, Tony will give you kisses!” Jan says suddenly, from where she's fluttering around Steve's face, waving her hands in front of Steve's eyes. The room goes silent, Hammer looks like he might have lost consciousness; dangling limply from Steve's hold. The tense line of Steve's shoulders eases, and he looks over at Tony, who shoots him fingerguns on reflex.  He's not arguing with that.  “Then Widow will question him, because um-” She trails off, watching Hammer fall to the ground with all the grace of a sack of potatoes, he lays there for a moment before scuttling off to hide in the corner of his cell-and would you look at that, he's
Tony practically liquifies against the sheets. Steve's big hands are on him, pushing at the muscles along his spine, slippery and sweet smelling with Tony's favorite lotion. He's whispering soft words as he works, kneading at Tony's biceps, wrapping his hands around his elbow and drawing them upward, then repeating that on his other arm. Tony groans in appreciation when those touches sweep down again, and Tony raises his hips so Steve can peel the lightweight blue pajama pants down his legs. Steve tugs them off carefully, hand kneading, pressing against his thighs as he does so, then down until he's dropping a ring of kisses around first his right ankle, then the left. Tony sighs, the sound loud in the quiet of the room. Steve tosses the pants off somewhere. Tony hears a quiet thump as they hit the floor, but he doesn't care.
Soon after that Steve finally falls asleep too.
Eventually they do part for air. Tony sucks in long pulls of oxygen, head falling back against the table with a moan when Steve leans down to bite a mark into a very visible part of Tony's neck, somewhere even his fancy dress shirts won't hide. Tony seems to understand what he's doing, and he goes absolutely crazy for it, arching against Steve, his nails catching and scratching on his clothed back.
By the end of the day, everyone had their head stuffed with enough arithmetic to bore a cow to death, and no one seemed to remember how bad Steve had stuck his foot in it in the morning.  Steve remembered though, sitting at his kitchen table, boosted up by a book while he scribbled on a worksheet. He was still sitting there when Sarah got home, he could tell it was her, her walk was slow, the way it always was after a long night on her feet.
“Aw, ma’, I’m not going anywhere, gotta wait ‘til I’m all grown and strong anyway.”  He tried not to sound bitter, but he still thought he might of, a little.
“I thought the flowers made it pretty clear that's what I was up to, and I meant what I said in the limo. Every single word of it.” Behind them the muted television is throwing colorful lights across the walls, but Tony can't tear his eyes away from Steve.
“Indeed I am Captain Rogers, do you require my assistance in picking flowers for Mister Stark?” JARVIS asks, expectation clear in his tone.  Steve stares at his phone.
When they arrived at their seats up in the club area, Tony immediately set his briefcase beneath his seat, and Steve put the portfolio behind them, where it would cause the least disruption to anyone walking around.   A tall reedy looking beta was already there waiting for them.  He was a little stringy, with small watery eyes and one of the worst toupees Steve had ever seen.
Tony pushes away that voice, he doesn't need Sunset Bain's cruelty in his head right now. Steve is not like that, he doesn't think it's even possible for Steve to project that level of artifice. Steve is a lot of things, but he's not a liar. He feels like if that unspoken thing between Pepper and himself had survived past his superheroing and palladium poisoning it might have been something like this. Steve is the first person to hold him like this since Afghanistan. He remembers Steve's words, his despair and loneliness, the way he spoke of missing touch. Tony understands more than Steve will ever know, more than he will ever be able to put into words.
“Of all the rotten times for you to act up.”  He muttered to his own lungs as he trudged down the street towards the subway station.  He was still close to the recruitment office, his steps intentionally slow, when a ruckus just a little ways ahead made his head snap up.
The walk back to the mansion feels short with the buzz of Steve's nerves unhelpfully carrying him along. He places the flowers in the cold, ignoring Natasha's pointed glances from where she's perched at the kitchen table as he does so.
“Tony.” Steve says, drawing Tony's eyes away from his drink. He nods when Steve reaches for his hand, swallowing audibly as Steve pulls their chairs closer together and presses close.
“Bucky!”  He cried, running towards his friend, the man he failed to protect so completely.  He disappeared before Steve could reach him.  Steve’s head whipped up, seeing a flash go around the corner.  There he was.  There was noise in his ear, garbled voices.  He ignored them, giving chase to that apparition.
He swallows, staring up into glittering blue eyes wordlessly.  “I'll be fine Steve, really.” Tony says, trying for annoyed, but arriving at fond instead.  Steve just smiles, leaning in to press the ghost of a kiss over his lips.
“You gonna put her name on the research anyway?” He asks knowingly, when they've wandered down into Tony's lab again. Tony should be jet lagged and exhausted, but that seems to be the opposite of the case.
“Boyfriend? Lover? Partner?” JARVIS supplies much more carefully than tony would have expected from his ever snarky AI. “Whatever the case, yes I have, and the results are overwhelmingly positive.” JARVIS finishes smugly, bringing up an array of charts, graphs, and one really sad video of Tony staring at a picture of Steve in the workshop after the whole gala incident of ultimate FUBAR-itude. Maybe that's not a word, he doesn't care, it is now.
“Steve, darling, touch me.” Tony moans, letting out a sharp gasp when Steve reaches beneath his crop-top to pinch and roll dusky nipples between his fingers; he knows tony likes more pressure, a harder, sharper tug, and he's rewarded by Tony arching beneath him, spreading his thighs in a way that screams invitation.
“Well. I'm not. The chairs in the boardroom are ridiculously comfortable, and they're used to me fidgeting anyway. They don't have to know that today the cause of my wiggling around is Captain America's giant d-”
“Of course I'm right.” He'd say. “I'm a futurist.”  The thought of Tony's smile lifts his spirits for a moment, but that too fades.  Only the sound of an urgent call for Assembly gets him out of his room and running toward the jet.  This at least he can do.
“Steve, this isn't, it's not just about me, tell me what you like, anything you like, I'll-I'll do it, I want to make you happy too.” He realizes he's getting a little worked up here, but he can't help it. Most people have been all too happy to let Tony run the show so to speak, but Steve just continuously leaves him guessing.
Come yell at me on my
Steve, that’s not,” Tony slid closer, his hands fluttered around, and finally rested on Steve’s shoulders, warm through his shirt. “Steve, you’re supposed to be brought down, supposed to have reprieve. No one is meant to stay in a rush, drop cycle indefinitely. Even alphas who aren’t supersoldiers, and I can only imagine what the serum is doing to you, oh my God, Steve.” He looked horrified, his eyes so wide and blue.
“All the good stuff is um, it’s been true so far, I have to say. Better even.” Tony picked at his gloves, and then looked up. “You’re really sure that it’s alright?”
“We need to get at her all at once.”  Steve said.  “She’s trying to split us up, fight us one on one.”  There were affirmatives over the comms, Tony looped back around to where Thor was engaged in a shouting and hammer match with Amora.  It sounded a little like a very one sided lovers’ spat.
Tony blinks. Even JARVIS is utterly silent
“Careful” Tony murmurs, dark eyes fixed on his, the pupils blown out wide.  "Or I might think you mean something by all this.” The words are hesitant, clearly meant to give Steve an out-to turn this into their usual banter, but Steve is done being cautious, has been for months now. This is it. He thinks. His chance to lay it all out, to make Tony see what he's been trying to show him.
“So then he has no one taking care of him?  Not uh, not that he can't it's just, you know, you're around him all the time,"  Steve trails off, looking sheepish and more than a little shy, and Tony is not at all sure what to make of where this conversation could possibly go. "He works a lot, don't think I've ever seen him come in here and eat a full meal.” Steve says, unknowingly dragging Tony out of his thoughts. Tony is going to get emotional whiplash from this conversation, he just knows it.
He leaves to pull himself together for the unspeakably long list of obligations he has lined up today. Things he's been putting off while he found his center again-a center point he feels shifting more and more towards a certain supersoldier and towards the team he's grown so fond of. Tony won't let himself think about that right now though, that way lies madness. Madness and probably more panic attacks. It's cold outside today, Tony can feel it in the vague ache in his chest, in the chill in his fingertips. He wants to go curl up with Steve again, but there is too much work to do.
when Steve grinds into him with a hard involuntary thrust, both of them startle and curse, their rhythm thrown off, but Steve picks it back up again. He knows he should be focusing on getting Tony off too, but he has a few ideas as to how to go about that. Now in this moment it's all he can do to stay upright, thrusting and thrusting into Tony's welcoming body, hands on Tony's hips hard enough to bruise until he's coming, sagging over Tony's back and dropping panting open mouthed kisses over his neck and shoulders. Tony just groans, rolling his hips back and letting him ride it out. He doesn't know how long they rest like that, but Tony's sweaty hair is tickling his nose, and he's still flushed beautifully when Steve blinks back into the world of the living.
“Good, because you are, so good, and pretty, and sweet, and just absolutely stunning.”  The words are so much, they slide through him, dropping into his belly like the first hot sip of hot chocolate on a cold day.  He feels good, he feels happy, he feels
He thinks, more than a little glumly.
“I do, and you love me too.” He also grants several of their mutual wishes that night. What can Steve say, he's always been weak for Tony Stark.
Warnings in this chapter for Steve being VERY depressed at times and coping badly, references to the A-bombs, and canon-typical violence.
“Come in, door’s unlocked.” He called, looking up when the door swung open to reveal Tony in one of his swanky suits, looking over caffeinated and bright eyed.
“Wow, I can see your nipples.” Clint says snidely.  Steve throws his water bottle at him. His screech of indignation is worth having to mop up the spill.
be trying a little harder to talk Steve down when he presses Hammer against the bars, and gets in his face, but it's an inspiring sight, and Tony is only human.
“Come now, you’re coming to the infirmary,”  He said to Waters, then turned to address Steve, “and you, Mister Rogers, I will speak with you this evening.”  Usually that kind of statement preceded a dressing down in Steve’s experience, but somehow Dr. Erskine’s tone made it seem warm, that Steve had done well.
“Shh honey, I've got you, just relax.” He moans, nails scratching down Steve's chest in zinging lines of sensation “Beloved, oh that's so nice.” Tony's voice is a throaty purr, dropping off into a sigh as Steve finally bottoms out inside him. He rests there for a moment, still everywhere save for the rippling clutch of his body as it adjusts. His cock has gone a little soft, but it's still dark, flushed and dripping a thin stream of pearly white precome onto Steve's abdomen. Tony smiles, clearly noticing where Steve is looking, and wraps a hand around himself, giving his dick a slow indulgent stroke that makes him clench around Steve with pleasure.
“What, really?”  He looked a little blown away, all big blue eyes and sweetness.  Steve didn’t know whether he wanted to hug him more or kiss him.
“Wow, um, yeah, okay.”  Tony’s eyes were wide and dark, he fumbled to open the velvet box with the links in it.
“Mister Stark.” He starts.
Steve watches him and realizes that for the first time in a week he feels well and truly relaxed. The ever present tension that makes his body thrum with barely contained agitation is gone, and it's gone because of Tony. Tony with his sweet words and his endless desire to please, and his shocking thoughtfulness. Tony who has halted in his progress towards the Stove because Steve has been staring at him, utterly gobsmacked and silent for the last few moments. He doesn't look like a billionaire right now. He looks soft, attractively rumpled, and at home in his warm slippers and half open shirt.
Tony wants those hands all
“Love peas, one of my favorite vegetables.” Steve answers, peering into Tony's pot and noting the diced carrots and peas already in the mix.
“Staring awfully hard there darling.” Tony murmurs, the flickering of his lashes, and the sliver of brown beneath them the only sign he's awake. Steve's flush deepens slightly, having been caught staring, but he's allowed to look now isn't he?
So wrapped up is he in what that could possibly mean for the man inside the suit-how hurt is he? Where is he? Is there anything the rest of the team can do to help? Who is controlling the suit if Iron Man is not in it?-that he almost misses the figure of someone in the sitting room just off the hall.
There were no omegas in the camps, the Nazis had no use for their compassion, for their empathy.  However, they were too valuable to kill, but too dangerous to the party’s demonic rhetoric to allow free movement.  There were pamphlets, posters of Nazi propaganda that spoke of omegas in glowing tones, how they had been sequestered away for their own safety, how they supported the AXIS powers, Steve knew it was all a lie.  All known omegas had been shipped to Nuremberg before the war began, so Steve fought for them too, with Bucky furious and just as determined at his side.  It was his purpose, his goal above all other goals.  It made his rushes stronger, his drive to stamp out everything the Nazis stood for burned within him even while he clutched his ineffectual hot water bottle behind enemy lines.  He couldn’t rest, not while those camps existed, not while such flagrant atrocities were being committed.
“Tis no fair competition, I know when I am bested good Captain-but perhaps I shall find some of yon sweets you spoke of in glowing tones.  What was it you spoke of?  Ah yes, Necco Wafers.” Thor says with a good natured smile over at Steve.  Tony tries not to stare at Steve like he's a madman.  Necco Wafers are
Loot in hand they take their seats near the back of the place. Steve looks almost too large to be sitting in such a tiny plastic chair. He's smiling brightly at Tony though, watching him eat his yogurt as if there's nowhere he would rather be. Tony is shocked to find he agrees.
“I'll um...pass that along if I see him before you do.” Tony manages, aware that the silence has stretched on a bit too long while he's been staring up at Steve with veritable stars in his eyes. Steve nods, stroking over his cheek wordlessly, blue eyes so intent on his face that Tony feels stripped bare; as if he could tell Steve anything in the moment, and Steve would say '
“Yes, absolutely, Jay, add cookie dough to the grocery list and block off some time.” JARVIS' affirmative is almost lost beneath Clint's whoop of glee. Natasha hits him with a snowball, and within a few moments the party deck has erupted into a massive and only slightly terrifying snowball fight. Tony doesn't join in though, choosing instead to remain bundled against Steve. He does offer commentary however, and his laughter is infectious when Hulk hits Clint with a snowball big enough to flatten him to the floor.
“Tony.”
Movie nights become one of Steve's most cherished events because Tony allows him to bundle him close, sometimes he can be coaxed to lay across his lap, where Steve rubs his shoulders, and strokes over his belly like a cat. Some nights Tony is wide awake, doing a million things at once while Steve snuggles him close. Other times he's clearly exhausted, melting into Steve's touches, dozing on and off while movies flicker over the screen. The others are there too, it's true, but Steve enjoys that too-that he doesn't have to hide how he feels for Tony from the team. Even if the man himself can't seem to wrap his head around what Steve is trying to show him.
“Get in the quinjet Hawkeye, we can gossip later.” She signs something at him and he staggers back in mock pain. Steve blinks and files that tidbit of information away, as he does all noteworthy things about teammates, would be, or otherwise.
Bucky is in this because why not.  He was found earlier than in MCU canon, and got to work through his conditioning and such in a proper way-obviously he's still recovering, but there will be no crash course de-winter soldiering here.  In this sort of AU he's an Avenger as well.  Anyway, happy reading, I live for comments as always, and hope you enjoy!
“Is there anything else you need, anything else I can get you?”  Iron man asked, he was close, almost close enough to touch.  Steve desperately wished they had been close enough to where it wouldn’t have seemed too strange for them to huddle together.  He had done it so many times after a rush, during the war.  And wasn’t that something, the war was over, had been over for decades.  Steve sank down to sit on the bed.  The trembling was only getting worse.  It was warm outside, but Steve only felt the ice.
he thinks somewhat hysterically as Steve starts waxing poetic about his tech.
“Got me, right where you want me, gonna kill me.” He wants to touch Tony, make him feel good too, but Tony wants this. Tony wants to do this, and it feels good, knowing Tony will take care of everything somehow, even if it does make him feel a little selfish. Still that awareness, that desire to do whatever Tony wants, it buzzes beneath his skin, spools out within him when Tony squeezes his wrists again and smiles at him as if he's the best thing he's ever seen.
“It's gonna be okay Tones, we've got you.” Rhodey is still speaking, but behind him, the television has shifted to a breaking news story. He hears it as if from far away, and in the glass of the big bay windows he sees his own face reflected back. A news ticker rolls beneath it, stock prices and something called S.I. Is blowing up the market with fantastic new technology.
“Mister
“You-really Steve?” Tony's voice cracks with disbelief. He sits up on the desk, and Steve reaches up to tug him down by the back of his neck.
“Okay, okay, wow, this is the best thing to wake up to ever, god.” Tony babbles, turning from the kiss to drop his head back on the pillows, taking a few steadying breaths.
“Okay yeah. I do have a splint too, but it's not stored in my shiny metal ass just so you know.” Iron Man says, pulling Steve from the direction of his thoughts. He's trying for levity again but it doesn't quite work, there's too much concern there, even through the voice modulation. Iron Man sighs gustily, hand rubbing over his shoulder again in slow soothing motions.
Then, the unthinkable happened.  In September of 1939, Steve had woken to find the news stands full of papers plastered with dreadful news.  Europe was at war.  The great war should have been the last war the world had seen, but it looked like that wasn’t going to be the case.  Steve bought one of the papers and paged through it with shaking hands.  Everyone had known things were not going well in Europe, but the politicians in the states had been trying to downplay it, to keep the unrest quiet.  It wasn’t quiet anymore.
“It's not that I don't think you can take care of yourself. That's...that's never been what I thought.” Steve's throat clicks on a swallow, Tony wonders if Steve's own heart is pounding away as rapidly as his is now. Distantly he can hear the sound of Happy playing really peppy music behind the divider.
him and would have been all too happy to destroy one of the best men Steve has ever met.
“Yeah here.” Tony motions all the Avengers over to a pile of shoe boxes, passing out green and red slippers to all of them.
“I wanted to be over here too beloved, now be a dear and sit back, and I’ll keep you warm.”  It doesn’t sound like an order, but Steve moves to comply immediately just the same. “There we go, thank you.”  Tony says, climbing onto the seat with him. He crouches between Steve’s knees, fussing with his robe so it doesn’t get tangled in their legs.
“Come with me.” Tony licks his lips, blue eyes lifting to meet Steve's. “We've both had a long week, I thought you might like to relax.” Tony's gaze darts from side to side.  Steve has noticed since they started this that Tony only ever truly looks nervous when he's talking to him. “The car is around the front, what do you say, weekend getaway?” Tony smiles, stroking a hand down his back with a featherlight touch. Steve just barely represses a shiver, eyeing Tony for a moment. With other people he's always a little shuttered. Here though, with Steve, his expression is unguarded, eyes bright with hope. He looks a little strained though, as if the week has taken its toll on him as well.
“Arsenal is to me what Bucky is to you. I'm sorry that I couldn't put it into words before. I'm so sorry Steve.” Tony says, afterwards, when their skin has cooled where they lay in a nest of pillows and blankets on the floor.
“Why did you choose me?”  Steve asked, after the silence between them stretched on.  The building around them was alive with activity, scientists and personnel preparing for something important:  Project Rebirth, him, he supposed.  “I just don’t really understand is all, there were better soldiers there than me, and I kind of got the impression General Phillips wasn’t too keen on an alpha, for this.”  That and, he often looked a little teary eyed when Steve was doing drills, as if watching Steve struggle was ruining his entire day.
“Do you want to build a snowman?” Tony asks, shooting Steve a nasty look over the little girl's shoulder when Steve starts humming the tune to a song.
“No hammer shall ever best mine.” Thor says proudly, hefting his prize up to the sun, his golden mane blowing majestically in the wind. Tony winces. Now he's definitely going to be replacing at least one attraction here, even though they're all obviously rigged.
“Ah, I see, well then, you are in the right place, go get changed, and meet me at the punching bags in the back.”  Lorenzo said, his gaze warm and understanding.
“I love you too.” He breathes against Steve's neck.
“God, yes Steve, but that better be a mutual arrangement.” Tony says, darting in for a kiss-which is returned immediately.  Steve grins, rolling them both off the bed to carry Tony into the bathroom on slightly wobbly legs.
When he comes back into the bedroom, Tony is waiting for him; just as he said, almost in the same position he left him.  There are a few toys on the bed he recognizes, but he doesn't get long to look at them, as Tony slinks off the mattress and into his space.
“Follow me then, handsome, let's go to bed.”  He breathes against Steve's cheek, steering him towards the staircase as he speaks.  Steve goes without complaint, letting Tony steal a few kisses as they make their way up the steps, and stealing a few of his own in return.  Tony's arm is strong around his waist, sure and steady, and Steve turns into him when they make it into the bedroom, slipping his hands up to cup Tony's face between broad warm palms.  Tony's blue, blue eyes are just visible beneath the dark fan of his lashes, but they drift shut when Steve pulls him in for a kiss. God can Tony kiss, it's always so incredible. Like a match striking flame, hot and consuming but still so so sweet, as if kissing Steve really is taking all of his concentration.
He thinks, staring up into eyes too green to be human. “You never wanted them, you Midgardians are so fickle.” The tone is almost fondly amused, but venom can be sweet. Tony knows this in some deep fundamental part of his soul.
Before they left, Iron Man paused to do a dance in the endzone before jogging back over to Steve and flying him back up to their seats in the stands.  “Sorry, always wanted to do that.”  He said, letting the armor recede back into the briefcase.
Steve nodded, waiting for him to continue. “Yeah, what’s in the warehouse, more fancy planes?”
“Oh.” Steve says, a smile breaking over his face. “
, and despite knowing he can't stop the screaming terror overtaking his mind,
Next week rolls around both more quickly and more slowly than he anticipated; the New Year coming and going without Steve even registering it has passed.  Without Tony in the Tower to plan the party, none of the Avengers had really felt like throwing a party; least of all Steve. He supposes it probably has something to do with the low level anxiety constantly simmering in the back of his mind. He's had many nights to think over what could happen if this goes wrong, but Steve is notorious for his stubborn demeanor for a reason; he just hopes he won't lose his best friend in the whole world if this all goes south.
