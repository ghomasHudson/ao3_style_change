Sherlock pulled off just long enough to reply, “Mrs Hudson will keep her company. And if you hurry, I can finish you off faster before you help me.”
“Sorry. Who are you?” John asks worriedly, as he's walked out of the bunker and into the glaring Afghan sun.
going to take part in that crappy tradition.” Sherlock snaps, glaring at Greg.
“With you two around? No way. I don't wanna know what either of you are thinking.” I reply, watching as Dad blushes and Father smirks.
He's stopped when lips meet his own; soft and gentle, and experimental.
A mysterious stranger changes all that
“You're a vampire.” I reply with a soft, reassuring smile.
"No, for once, it's
"Apologies." He says softly, pulling back from me.
"Thank you,
The Doctor quickly started pressing buttons and turning the dial; he knew it had been a bad idea to bring Sherlock to his own future.
“You better be.” Greg smirks, giving him a wink before walking off.
It's nearing the end of Sherlock and John's second year of college and the boys have been together for seven months now. Unfortunately, it's also six days until John goes off to start his army training and Sherlock doesn't take it well.
John tries to regulate his breathing, struggling to find his mobile with his free hand and searching for Greg's number; he presses the call button and hands it to Sherlock.
“John, it's not you ...”
"Night, my love."
going to get me presents from different planets.” Harriet giggled, giving her dad a reassuring smile.
“Why would you do that?”
“We are trying to find him, Sherlock. And Mrs Hudson is right, we don't leave our own behind.” Mycroft says calmly, his anger now hidden away under his mask of professionalism.
“That's just it, I don't. I would wait around for you. I'd wait until you came back on holidays and I'd wait until you came back for good. But would you still want me then?” Sherlock asks, sitting up with his back to John.
“For coming over to talk to me when we were little. For always accepting me … For not taking advantage of me earlier.”
“Oh, right. Well, I thought that's what we were about to do.” Sherlock replies, blushing bright pink.
“I said,
He pulled away from Sherlock and whispered, "After tea."
“Can we do it now? I know you don't want to rush this but … can we?”
Thankfully, John and Lestrade come running into the alleyway as I struggle to fight unconsciousness. Lestrade cuffs him as John hauls me to my feet and insists that he's taking me back to Baker Street because he 'won't hear the end of it if he sends me to hospital'.
that party. Didn't you, Sherl?”
“That would be lovely, Mrs Hudson.” John replied with a smile.
“Do you even realise everything your brother is doing, has done, for
“Well, maybe it will stop him being such a freak, having a distraction. Well, good luck.”
“Um, sorry. I'll just stay out of this.”
“I told you not to call me that!” Sherlock snaps angrily.
"Well, thank you." Sherlock replied, heading to the door quickly.
“Oh, for the love of God. Gregory, please behave.”
“That was just mean and you know it.” Greg chuckles, leaning down to kiss his boyfriend.
“No! Don't say that!
“What if I’m not his type of girl …”

“Apologies.” Sherlock moans, bringing a hand up to John's shoulder.
“Get him to the station.” Greg orders, lowering his gun and turning to leave.
John has been in the army for six years and the relationship between him and John is going strong,
, Sherlock? He isn't just facing arrest here, Sherlock, he's facing probably death ...”
John leans in to whisper in his boyfriend's ear, “I love you, Sherlock Holmes.”
John moans again, closing his eyes to stop himself from physically holding his best friend down and having his wicked way with him.
“Oh, John, so eager.” Sherlock purred, as he lubed himself up.
“Now, tell me. What the hell have you been doing to yourself?” John cries, stepping back and looking his partner up and down.
“Oh so you are, love.” John replied sweetly, a devious smile on his lips.
“Aren't you going to put it on?”
“Now it sounds like
“Yes, well, there's nothing wrong with looking presentable.” Sherlock snaps, bringing his hands to his hips.
The next time I met him, I was eleven. This time, he looked sad as though he'd been hurt by someone.
“Sherlock? Shit, I'm on fire. I feel like my head's about to explode.” John replies, blood dripping down his chin.
decide to go in then it can cause a collapse in the space time continum."
“That's some wake up method you have there.” John grins, running his fingers through his boyfriend's messy curls.
One day, the emails stop coming and at first Sherlock thinks that it's just because John can't answer them yet. John successfully completed his army training and is now a fully qualified medic, which of course made Sherlock immensely proud.
"No, really, I have."
“The night you got stabbed I checked on your wound.”
“Answer me, William!” Mycroft yells, roughly grabbing his younger brother by the chin and forcing him to look him in the eyes.
“Fine, whatever. Kid wouldn't even give it up anyway. Take the stupid prick, see if I care.” Davies laughs, letting go of Sherlock.
“Oh. Well, I guess I better get back to my own bed then.” Sherlock replies awkwardly, sitting up.
daughter.” Sherlock corrected with a soft smile.
John sighed but smiled at his daughter; at least Sherlock was actually taking notice of his daughter, even if it was to teach her some Not Good things.
Sherlock walked in the room at that moment and instantly knew he'd regret it.
"Oh. I'm sorry." John replied sadly.
"She figured it out ... At six."
“Oh, God.” John sighed.
Yep, I
“I didn't say we would be learning
“Right, if you're going to scream about it, we're going back to our room. No arguments.” John replies, grabbing his text book and bag.
“Oh. So you …
“I want to experience it all, John. And I want it to be with you.” Sherlock says desperately, looking at John with pleading eyes.
"Fine."
John suddenly gasps and Sherlock looks up into his eyes; completely black which can only mean that he's survived being turned.
"Um ... Wow. This all looks amazing. You did this for us?"
. Plus he's useful for my cases and everyone seems to like him, even Mycroft which is unusual.
“Fuck your brains out? Make you scream my name to the heavens? Make you feel like you'll never walk again? Oh yeah, been meaning to talk to you about it for weeks but didn't want to freak you out.” John replies, grinning at his mate's reaction.
“Wow, nice to meet you, Sherlock. Mags, I could do with your help in the kitchen sorting the last of the food, okay. Don’t worry, I won’t keep her too long.” Amy smiles, grabbing Maggie's arm roughly and dragging her to the kitchen.
“Sherl, I've always loved you. You're my best mate and, sure, I thought that if you ever needed advice on dating or you had a crush on someone then I'd be there for you. If you'd have told me that it was
Immediately, Greg lowers his hand and realises his fatal mistake; he raised a hand to a man who's been to hell and back, probably had a hand and fist raised to him more times than he can count, and suddenly, Greg drops to his knees and pulls the frightened young man into his arms.
“Good boy.” John smiles, kissing Sherlock's neck and getting up off his lap.
“God, yes.” John replied, forcefully grabbing Sherlock and dragging him down for a fierce kiss.
“Yep, that's the one. We're Black Ops. Special Forces.” The operative replies, herding John and the others into a chopper.
John jumped at the sudden question and replied; "As good as always. Harry loves my stories."
“I'll explain later, Gregory. Right now though, we should make our way to our home. It's been a long enough wait for my little brother.” Mycroft replies with determination, “Thank you, Anthea, my dear.”
“You really fucked up there, Sherlock. But you're not a bad guy, no matter what anyone says. Granted, you're still a dick.” I chuckle, smiling at him.
“Thanks.” Sherlock replies sarcastically, taking the beer anyway.
Sherlock tries to hide a gulp and walks passed Greg to the entrance of the building.
“John. Stay with me, please. We're getting out of here. We're only a couple of streets from from home but I can make that distance in a few minutes. Hold on, John.” Sherlock says desperately, picking John up and carrying him out of the room.
"What did you say?" Sherlock asked, finally finding his voice.
“Thank Christ. We've been looking for you bloody everywhere, man.” The voice laughs in relief, shouting orders to his squad to get the others out too.
too?”
He drops me on the couch and lifts up my shirt, I just barely hear the gasp of shock before everything goes black.
He knocked on the door and John Watson answered.
“Jawn, don't go mad with it.” Sherlock whines, dropping his shoulders dramatically.
"Okay. Yes, I'd like to go back in time. And dare I say it, to see you being born again as that was the second best day of my life."
Sherlock smiles shyly at his boyfriend, gently pulling him down onto the bed and climbing on top of him to kiss him softly.
“Sherlock, sorry, I dropped a plate. You’d think with me being a waitress I’d be a little less clumsy but you know. Anyway she kicked me out the kitchen …” Maggie rambles causing Sherlock to smile at her.
happy man in the world.” Sherlock replies sarcastically, crawling up John's body.
But he's a gorgeous young vampire and who can stay at them very long.
Mycroft walks over to his brother and holds his arms out, the younger Holmes practically falling into the welcome embrace.
She grabs his arm and pulls him in the direction of the back garden, opening the patio doors and pulling him into the cold night air.
“No, I’ve only just met him. I mean he’s a guy from work, we just started chatting one day. You know how it is.”
He asks to check my wound and I tell him that I've fixed it up myself, he just nods at me and continues to make breakfast.
“What? Jesus, what happened to 'go home or you'll be my next meal'?”
And before Sherlock could say anymore, John took his cock in his mouth and slowly licked him.

"So it reads minds?"
"Good phone call?" Sherlock asked.
"I did?"
“Why aren't you upstairs with your dads, dear?”
John suggests tea at our favourite take away and I have to agree that I'm a little hungry myself, and honestly, I feel like a walk now.
.” Greg growls, completely ignoring the man's remark and focusing on how tight a hold Davies has on the younger man.
“My brother, Mycroft.” Sherlock snarls, clearly not happy with his brother's actions.
can survive another two years of Sherlock's destructive behaviour.
Sherlock moans loudly at the new feeling and the vibrations send a shock wave into John.
“Wait, you knew he'd do this? And what do you mean always? Mycroft, what haven't you told me?” Greg asks angrily, with a slight tone of betrayal in his voice.
"Harriet Holmes-Watson." I replied.
it wasn't obvious to me.”
"Why?"
“Not yet, love. But I won't give up, you know that.” Greg replies, walking out of the third drug den that evening.
“Well, look at you two, you’ve got this lovely glow about you. What have you been up to?”
John lunges for Sherlock and pins him on his back on the couch, driving his teeth into Sherlock's neck and drinking his fill.
“I need to talk to you, outside.” Maggie suggests, looking around to make sure nobody follows them.
“I'm home, Sherlock.”
He kisses back gently, wrapping his arms round my waist protectively. I instinctively wrap my own arms round his neck, pulling him close and deepening the kiss.
“Yep, let's go.” John smiles, grabbing his jacket and keys.
“What sort of friend … would I be … if I did that?” John asks breathlessly, taking a deep breath in before letting it out slowly.
"Definitely beautiful, my love."
"Okay, John, I need to turn you. If I don't you'll die. You know what you'll become. And you don't …" Sherlock breaks off to sob, “You don't have to stay with me but … You need to know that I love you. I'm in love with you. I can't let you die, my love. I'm sorry.”
“Never, John! I would never walk out on you! You're my best friend. You're my
Mr Cambria makes a move to get up but Sherlock is faster; lifting him off his feet and pinning him to the wall by his throat.
"Harriet Hamish Holmes-Watson. Sit down, otherwise I'll take your telescope away." Sherlock shouted.
“Then bloody well act like one. What would John say?” Greg replies, opening the car door for Sherlock.
greatly.” John moans softly, chewing his lip again.
He makes it back to Baker Street in five minutes, running up the steps to 221 and hammering on the door.
“What is it, Anthea?” Mycroft demands, catching up with his assistant as she stops by her desk.
What happens when John is finally found alive, after those two years, with a bullet in his shoulder?
I know eaves-dropping is wrong, Dad's always telling Father off for it but I've always been a curious person, so what Dad doesn't see, doesn't matter.
“John, I'm not ready.” Sherlock whispers, grabbing John's wandering hand.
“Alright then. Let her have it, Sherlock.”
“Yes,
"Is this true, Harry?"
“For the love of God, Sherlock. He's
"One every year since she was born." The Doctor smiles proudly.
“Fine. Draw some eye-liner on me then.” Sherlock snaps, frowning at John.
“Who? Not Molly is it? I mean, she's cute an' everything but I don't feel that way.” John replies sheepishly, looking over at the young girl.
"Of course he isn't. I'm staying right here, Harry."
“Goodnight, love.” Sherlock smiles.
.” John grins, leaning in and kissing Sherlock.
"Oh, the eyelashes are out now, are they?"
“There is when you try to
"Now, enough talk. Make yourself useful, Doctor Watson." Sherlock growled seductively, directing John's hands to his jeans.
Sherlock hears the front door close and collapses to the floor; tears burning his eyes as he drops his head into his lap and, for the first time in years, actually cries.
, dear brother.” Mycroft scoffs, watching his brother carefully.
John followed soon after, screaming Sherlock’s name loudly.
"I'll be with you in a moment, just have to make a call." The Doctor replied, waving his mobile at Sherlock.
They walk back to their room in silence, Sherlock stamping and fuming all the way while John just walks slowly behind him, determined not to let the whole of college see their little
Harriet giggled at her father, grabbing her own plate and filling it up before adding a large portion of beans.
sanity.
"John?"
“It's six thirty in the morning, what the hell are you doing in my house? In fact, how the hell do you know where I live?”
He walks down the stairs, quickly but carefully, listening to John's breathing as it becomes more harsh.
.” Sherlock replies and he actually sounds sad.
"I won't."
“I think this one's just an ordinary Earth necklace, Dad. I don't suppose the Doctor is
"Okay." And for once, Sherlock was unsure.
“This is going to take a while, I want to worship you. I want to take care of you. But most of all, I want to love you, Sherlock.” John whispers into Sherlock's ear as he moves in and out of him.
“You … You look good, John.” Sherlock replies unsurely, looking down at the floor and blushing again.
“What do you … Oh, right.” John stutters, seeing Sherlock's erection through his pants. “I … Um, okay.”
John blushed at his daughter's critical observation before looking at Sherlock, who smirked and took a seat at the table.
. But this was too much, John was struggling to cope.
"Okay."
The younger man buried his face in John's neck as the older man got to work, slowly stroking Sherlock to completion.
Almost as though he realises this, Sherlock pulls off to give his boyfriend a few minutes to wake up.
“What's that supposed to mean?”
“Because I'm going to wash that filthy mouth of yours out with some soap.
to blackmail people for stuff. No sexual tension there, Sherlock.” John replied, glaring at his partner.
"Bye."
“Well of course I did. How else is she going to survive high school?”
thing.” Harriet groaned, looking wearily at the landlady.
“What was that for?” I ask softly, smiling at him.
“Y .. Yes. Doctor Watson. I'm … I'm Doctor Watson.” John replies nervously, adrenaline coursing through his veins.
“Sherlock, I've fancied you for
“Damn.” Sherlock muttered, glaring at the older man.
“Don't care. Busy.” Sherlock mumbles into John's neck, moving to leave a love bite on the older teen's collarbone.
"Sherlock, it's wonderful." John replied, walking over to Sherlock and kissing him.
was the word you used." Sherlock smirked.
“Yes, well, maybe just a nibble.” Sherlock replied, even as he piled his plate with fried eggs, bacon and sausages.
“How is Analiese? Safe, I presume.” Sherlock asks softly, stroking his husband's cheek.
"Wait, this is a psychic necklace."
"He made a compromise."
“Not now, Mrs Hudson!” Mycroft shouts, roughly picking the folder up from the floor at his feet.
He ends up in a seriously bad way with little chance of surviving without Sherlock's help
!” Sherlock scoffs, rolling his eyes again.
“No really, I am. Come with me and I’ll show you.” The Doctor replied, pointing in the direction of his time machine.
"John ..." Sherlock moaned, gripping John's arms tightly.
“Yeah, but you're important to him. Or more specifically to his
“We're best friends, John. It
“I'm home now, baby.” John whispers, kissing his partner's hair.
"What? When?"
"I will. I promise. And I love you too, John." Sherlock replied softly, bringing John into his arms and hugging him tight.
Mycroft replies before hanging up the phone.
says that! It's not you, it's me … and then they walk out on you! I can't have that from you, Sherlock! We've been best friends for years ...”
“Some vampires are born human and some are turned. Well, you've probably read the books. Anyway, Sherlock and his family are vampires, his mother was turned by a rogue vampire. And so both Sherlock and his brother were born vampires. Sherlock is a danphia. Half vampire, half human. I don't suppose he's told you the story of his mother. Has he? No, he wouldn't have. Anyway, we'd been living together two years before Sherlock turned me. A week after he did, we got married.”
The Doctor grins, and so do I, because I already know the answer, I always have.
The older teen smiles and moves his hand faster, moaning softly into his friend's lips happily. Sherlock's continuous moans encourage him to go even faster and in a few minutes John feels Sherlock spasm as he comes in John's hand.
"Thank you." John sighed, kissing Sherlock softly.
Needless to say, I was the one who washed the blood stains out of his clothes that night; it wouldn't have been right to frighten our poor landlady to death.
I'm going to apologise in advance for the next chapter and say, I turned into Moffat and Gatiss' evil little love child with the next one.
“I knew you were perfectly capable at getting Analiese back, John. And I wasn't
about the experiment and you chose to ignore them.” John corrects, smirking at his boyfriend.
"I love you, sweetheart." Sherlock replied, forcibly grabbing John and kissing him passionately.
But will he tell him what he knows?
He looks back up and replies, “I know there are things you're never going to be able to tell me, matters of national security and everything. But things concerning your brother, that's different, Myc.”
“Our own? They're just pawns to you. Pawns to fight in a war that isn't of our concern.” Sherlock sneers, turning to look out of the window.
He ran his hands down the detective's chest, plucking the buttons of the shirt as he went.
“Hey! It's alright, ya know. I understand, he's an attractive guy and you're worried people are gonna notice.” Greg shrugs, swigging back his drink.
John barely squeezes his hand in response and Sherlock continues.
“Now we're getting somewhere.” Sherlock moans with a slight hint of a giggle.
“Definitely.” Sherlock replied quirking an eyebrow.
"Yes, I know. Don't get used to it."
Mycroft immediately jumps up, helping Greg and his little brother to their feet and not even bothering to straighten out his suit as he bolts through the door.
“But you still want to go.”
The Doctor flicked switches and turned dials and with a whoosh, the time machine disappeared into the vortex.
“Alright.” Sherlock replies unsurely, before going back to root through his wardrobe.
“Ah I don't think so. Sit down and I'll feed you your muffin, then
"Do you want to help father fix daddy's mug?"
“Shut up, Sherlock.”
we wouldn't be in this situation.” Sherlock smirked, his voice dropping even deeper.
Sherlock laughed, “You make out like I taught her how to pull off a bank heist, John. It's only blackmail, she wouldn't get any jail time for blackmailing the girls at school.”
"Yes, um, I'll be off then." The Doctor coughs awkwardly.
"That last bit's a lie." John cried, blushing profusely.
“Oh great, an awkward vampire, nice.”
"Sherlock!"
And John finally finds out Sherlock's secret
of these two things.
“Why would I need a shower, John?” Sherlock asked innocently, a slight smirk on his lips.
? My, my, dear brother, you
“Oh, here we go.” Greg sighs, rolling his eyes.
“You're right.” John continues to giggle, “Let's go.”
Sherlock takes a deep breath before sprinting down the street; the houses becoming a blur as his speed picks up to an inhuman pace.
“Oh God, we're dating emotionally stunted men. If we were women, our mates would be telling us to pack up and go. And we'd be meeting up to have a good cry about it.” Greg sighs, picking up his coffee.
“When we kissed, you said it was your first kiss. So, you've never, ya know,
“I do.”
up again.” John chided, but it was impossible to keep the laughter out of his voice.
“It's okay, baby.” John reassures him, kissing his neck.
It was the first time John had lost his temper so badly and it caused Harriet to jump and move away.
“How could I not be, what with a sexy angel sucking my cock.”
“Our daughter is going to be very mad with us. We'll have to find a way to make it up to her.” John continued, stroking Sherlock's hair.
"It slipped out of daddy's hand."
“Who are you?”
Sherlock starts to breath properly again, gingerly standing up and willing his brain and feet to work together.
John groaned loudly, signally that the detective had definitely achieved his goal.
Hopefully, he'll let the matter drop and we won't have to have a discussion about what I am.
.” Sherlock drawled, sitting back in his seat and receiving a sharp kick from John.
Sherlock sighs happily and wraps his arms around John tightly, nuzzling his neck.
“What sexual tension?
Sherlock scoffed before replying. “I don’t

A small smile unconsciously forms on Sherlock's lips before it vanishes with the remembrance of what's happened.
“So, same tomorrow then?” John asked, finally getting his breath back.
"Harry, I'm so sorry." John replied, grabbing his daughter and hugging her tight. "Go to your room, sweetheart."
Well, of course, she'd
"Look at you, you've found your heart." The Doctor replies, a sparkle in his eyes.
“I love you, my love.”

.” John smirks, creating an innuendo from his friend's words.
“Yes, well, don't let the door hit you on the way out. Off you go.”
She blushed as one particular moment came to mind where she'd walked in on them when John had Sherlock bent over their desk while he was going for it like a champion.
"I already have a blogger." Sherlock replied coldly, not even looking at the stranger.
, at least allow me to go to my room.” Sherlock drawls, rolling his eyes.
Maggie disappears back through the patio doors to her friends, completely baffled as to what just happened.
“No, you can't cross timelines. If the other you
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John and bit his lip tentatively, causing the doctor to moan.
Amy grabs another bottle of wine from the fridge and places it on the counter before grabbing some more crisps and pouring them into some bowls.
She thinks resentfully, pulling her phone out of her pocket.
“So, Father, about that psychic necklace. I'm fifteen now so ...”
special, Sher.” John smiles softly, sitting up to kiss his boyfriend.
John ran after him and slammed the door shut.
Her breath catches in her throat as she sees his long canine-like teeth.
“I thought you might like it.” Sherlock grins back, running his fingers down John's chest and to his cock.
“Sher, talk to me, please.”
When John returned, Sherlock was lay on the couch; eyes closed and fingers linked on his chest.
. As you can tell.” He smiles at Maggie, stepping into the light and leaning against the shed.
“M’ning.” Came John’s reply; not fully awake just yet.
“Sherlock Holmes! Honestly, teaching a thirteen year old how to blackmail people. You'll regret it.” Mrs Hudson warned, giving Sherlock a displeased look.
“There's still things we haven't done. Things that you said we'd experience together.”
“I shall see you at half twelve then.” Sherlock smiles back, grabbing his bag before looking for his shoes.
“Sher, you can … um,
. Do you want to see what happens when you reunite with John?”
“John, Sherlock. Good, you're both here.” Greg grins, holding up the mistletoe.
"You sure?"
John smiles and moves his fingers slightly, touching the little bundle of nerves again.
Sherlock crawls back up John's body as the older teen shuts his eyes and turns his head away, determined not to embarrass Sherlock.
. We don't know where he is. We're trying to locate them but we've had no luck as of yet.”
Sherlock brings his free hand up and cups John's neck, kissing him with more force.
"I do, everyday."
Sherlock moaned in response, grinding his hips into John’s causing the doctor to moan and respond in kind.
"Bedroom now!" He growled, pushing Sherlock off him and in the direction of the bedroom.
He watches the fragile and abused form of his brother as he sways were he stands, his legs barely strong enough to support his weight, as depleting as it is. He's watched his brother since the day John was declared M.I.A and has seen his increasing decline and self destruction.
.” He sighs, walking back over to John.
“Besides, we're young, right. I mean, I'm seventeen and you're eighteen. Who knows where we'll be in ten years time.” John adds, summoning the waitress to get a muffin.
“Move away from him, Sherlock. He's going to need blood, and he's going to be much stronger than you. I'll need to …”
“And besides if he sees you as a friend then at least you can stay mates.” Amy smiles, giving her friend a reassuring squeeze on her arm.
The Doctor pays a visit to Doctor John Watson in order to help their future.
“Well it was to everyone else. Even John knew that. And that was over eight years ago when he realised it.” Mycroft remarks with disdain, wondering how long he's been wearing his heart on his sleeve when it comes to his partner.
Sherlock moans into John's mouth before blushing as he realises that his erection is probably digging into the older teen's thigh and he can feel it. He pushes John off and dives off the bed in a flash.
When did I last feed? I'm sure it was only yesterday but then again, this case has been going on for days so it could be longer.
“His troop was captured and they have been missing since. Six men missing and four dead, it's a bloody cock-up.” Mycroft growls, revealing his true feelings for once.
“I'm sorry about him, love. He has a thing for
He gets a lucky punch on me that actually leaves me a little dizzy and he's about to stab me again when I barely manage to pin him once again.
“So, what do you think?” John asks with a grin, once Sherlock has come out of the bathroom.
“You can't taste a laugh, Sherlock.” I giggle.
“Thank you, Mrs Hudson. At least someone else agrees with me.” John replied, pointedly looking at his partner.
John chuckled at Sherlock's obvious avoidance of the word 'sperm' and instead using the scientific term.
“Give me … five minutes.” Sherlock gasps, gripping John's hips hard.
Mycroft falls silent before whispering softly, “How did we get here, Gregory? We used to know each other so well. We used to be happy.”
"You have beautiful eyes. Mine are just dull and plain, like me." John said sadly, staring at his very beautiful partner.
"Thank you."
I worked it out a few days after moving in with him, it was obvious really; especially when I tried to check on a stab wound that was already healing, Sherlock was practically unconscious by then so I just left him to sleep it off.
John reluctantly pulls away, finally breathing properly and stares at the younger teen.
John smiles softly, curling into Sherlock's side as he switches off the lamp.
“I don’t know an Arthur Conan-Doyle.”
“Don't think you're off the hook either, young lady. You should know better.” John called from the kitchen.
“I know, Mrs Hudson. But the wound sliced a main artery, he'll be dead before they get him ready for surgery.”
“Of course I have. Isn't that what couples do when they're in love?” Sherlock asks cautiously, confusion furrowing his brow.
“I love you, John.”
John’s hands moved from Sherlock’s sides to his back and he scraped his nails down, causing red scratches that made his skin look even paler in comparison.
"Oh God, why didn't you run as fast as you could away from me?"
“I’d rather not.” Sherlock replied, still staring at his own tombstone.
!" John's voice almost broke on the last word; the truth of the situation being thrown into an argument that could make or break their relationship,
“Well, I can hardly help it when my partner is looking ever so delicious.” Sherlock grinned back, leaning down and kissing John fiercely.
So, it's the morning after and John still can't believe what happened between himself and his best friend.
“Oh, okay." Maggie replies unsurely, wondering why the hell she even came up with this lame story. “So, just out of curiosity, how old are you. I'd say thirty but I'm guessing I'd be wrong.”
“Oh, cool. So what does that involve then?”
“Do you think we'll still be with them in ten years?” Greg asks, looking dead ahead.
“Mm, fine.” Sherlock mumbles distractedly, before tugging the blanket off the bed and covering himself with it.
“And I don’t want to. Can’t you see I’m busy?” Sherlock snapped, purposely not looking at the man.
He flinches slightly, a low growl in his throat as warning.
“Well, if it's so confidential, you shouldn't have brought it here then.” Mrs Hudson replies, turning around and leaving.
“Yes, Sherlock. It is. But it's better than having a daughter who blackmails people. You're going to turn her into a criminal, Sherlock.”
"Oh, of course." Sherlock replied, following the Doctor's lead.
Sherlock pulled a face in response but agreed.
Maggie finishes work after another impromptu late shift at the bar. She's tired and just wants to go and meet her friends, Amy and Tisha for their movie night.
"Daddy, father! I have a present! It says 'Hope things are good. Love The Doctor'. Doctor Who?"
John tries to suppress the moan in his throat at his husband's authority but it comes out as a whimper and Sherlock's eyes go black at the sound.
"No, we just don't get seen. Normally."
Greg falls silent, he knows it's pointless to argue with Sherlock about this and he still has to address the issue of what Davies claimed.
“I … I thought that … I dreamt
“What? I don't want to end this. I love you, Sherlock. I was always planning on going in the army but that doesn't mean I want to break up with you.”
“Yes, Sir.”
"I'm not a girl and my name's Maggie!"
"Good. Oh, we've landed."
John's hand starts to work on Sherlock slowly, preventing the younger teen from worrying. Sherlock moans into John's lips, indicating for him to go faster.
“Now, be a good boy and fuck me like you mean it.” The younger teen smirks, his fingers tangle in John's hair.
“Yeah.”
And Sherlock spent the following two years doing heroin, getting blind drunk and doing sexual favours for anyone and everyone.
“Mr Cambria, don't … do this. You're already wanted for … murder, you don't want to make … it worse.” John tries to reason, struggling for breath.
“You little … At least I'm not an insufferable little brat, Sherlock. You bloody little sod.”
"Say it again." Sherlock said, a twinkle in his stormy blue eyes.
"You better be!" Amy jokes.
He leans in slowly, pressing his lips to Sherlock's softly. Sherlock responds slowly, moving his lips slightly to accommodate the height difference.
Sherlock is an arse but why is that a surprise
Sherlock hums before gently scraping his teeth over the sensitive head and the moan John makes has probably woken up their classmates in the other rooms but neither teen cares right now.
John crawls back up Sherlock's body, brushing back the curls that are starting to stick to his boyfriend's forehead, “Let's go get a shower, baby.” He whispers softly, kissing Sherlock's cheek.
"Take a look."
Unfortunately, John is only half awake and trying to get his bearings so his brain is not fully aware enough to enjoy the experience.
"See what you make me do? You never show any interest in our daughter, ever! She tries to talk to you but you're too wrapped up in your bloody experiments!"
“Behave yourselves. Please.” Harriet sighed, leaving the room and directing her friends to her bedroom.
“No, John and 'm tryin' to sleep.” Sherlock mumbles, pulling the covers over his head.
“I don't feel as hungry, if that's what you mean. Now I just feel horny as hell and want to fuck your brains out.” John chuckles to himself.
"No." The Doctor didn't look at Sherlock but his voice remained dark.
“I know you do, love. I want you too. Let's get you home, you beautiful creature.” John sighs, reluctantly pulling away from his husband.
"Wait, Sherlock, a strange man says he'll see our daughter soon and you think that's
"What?"
"You called me 'love'." Sherlock replied, looking awkward.
“I thought you had
John moans softly and presses his body flush against Sherlock's and resting both his hands on the other's hips.
touch.
"Yes, let's."
he'd say.”
Sherlock hummed once more and sped up in his actions, causing John to moan louder and louder.
I was going to call this My First Blow Job but after the re-naming of the first chapter, I thought I'd try a classier approach. That and the fact that the boys spend more time talking about how they should progress than spending the morning giving each other blow jobs ;)
"Judging yourself. I love you just as you are. And to me, you are so beautiful. So stop."
John pushed Sherlock back into the counter as his hands roamed over the detective's chest. As he did, Sherlock's hands moved to untuck John's shirt and scratch down his back, causing the ex-army doctor to moan again.
“I know. You always have. You think I didn't notice that little eyebrow quirk back at Baskerville?”
It wasn't exactly a lie, just not the truth either.
"What about true love?" Sherlock asks awkwardly.
to know that they arouse their partner. It's a natural thing, baby. And I
"How long has it been?" Sherlock asked, pulling away from John.
"Your child, John." Sherlock called from the kitchen.
“Because that was … unbelievable. And fantastic. And you've always been the best decision I ever made.” John smiles, pulling out slowly and curling up next to his boyfriend.
“What's the point, you're leaving me. We might as well end this now.”
So Sherlock and John have morning sex (after Harriet is taken to school of course)
“Harry, please can you just do this? For me and your father? Please?”
wish, more like, sweet-cheeks. Mikey says I have the body of a God and I'm the best shag he's ever had.” Greg grins back, nudging his friend again.
Sherlock tugs his jeans and boxers off in one, throwing them off the side of the bed before remembering how sticky he is.
“I … I could bite you.” Sherlock whispers, looking at Maggie through his eyelashes.
further? Which is fine, we can … just forget about, whatever this was. I'm okay with that.” John whispers awkwardly, rubbing the back of his neck.
“God, I've missed this.” John laughs, nudging Greg.
"Ha. I just thought you were being arrogant and rude. If I'd known ..."
Sherlock gives an exasperated sigh, stepping away from John and flopping down onto his bed.
parts of your anatomy this early in the relationship.” Sherlock replies with a smile that John can only be described as
Greg and John have a heart to heart about their boyfriends and their future.
“I'll make it worth your while.” John whispers in Sherlock's ear, his hand running further down to the younger teen's cock.
"Time to go." The Doctor slammed the doors quickly.
“Idiot.”
“Oh I think I
"What? Oh, yes. Just fine."
"But ..."
Maggie turns back to Sherlock, trying to figure out the play of emotions across his face.
more useful alive than dead.
“Just tell me everything, from the beginning."
“Just try and relax, it's better that way.”
“On the couch, of course not, baby. I'm going to take you to bed properly, treat you like a proper lady.”
“What did you call me?” Sherlock squeaks, eyes going wide.
“I'll get us some drinks, Sherl.” John smiles back at his friend and disappears into the crowd.
"My pleasure, Sherlock. Just remember what I said."
“Calm down?! You just told me you're going into the army and you're telling me to calm down?!”
“Enough, Gregory! Remember, you're not supposed to know any of it.” Mycroft growls, silencing his partner.
“What's wrong with my shirt?” Sherlock asks, his voice going up higher a few notches, before he coughs to clear his throat.
“Shit, does it always feel that good?” Sherlock asks in wonder as his body twitches from over-sensitivity.
John splutters on the smoke in his lungs and blushes bright red, coughing out a “Oh God.” before waving his two friends goodbye and heading back to college.
"So it can take us to the future?"
John rests his hands on his boyfriend's slim hips and kisses him back, tangling their legs together. He pulls away slightly and looks up at Sherlock.
Simple,
“I thought it was blatantly obvious how I felt.” Mycroft replies, looking away.
"Just that." The Doctor replied, walking away from the confused Doctor Watson.
Sherlock smiled in satisfaction, standing up and crowding John into the corner; the older man reaching out to help Sherlock with his own issue.
John manages one last thrust before Sherlock screams his name and comes all over John's chest.
"I can see that. So, who's her mother?" The Doctor asks gently.
“Je te désire, John.” Sherlock moans softly, rolling his head back.
Sherlock bites his lip and continues to thrust slowly into John's mouth, until John speeds up in his assault and Sherlock can no longer hold back anymore; driving his cock into his boyfriend's mouth hard and fast.
"Good. Anyway, I'll be off then. Goodbye, Sherlock."
Sherlock growls in reply but climbs in the back of the car anyway.
“Really? Is this some sort of joke?” Sherlock scoffed, rolling his eyes.
“Wha- me and Mycroft aren't together.” Greg splutters, blushing a lovely shade of pink.
“Who's the terrible one now.” Sherlock smirked, walking into the kitchen and kissing his partner.
“Nope, someone
“I haven’t finished yet.” Sherlock scolded and was graced with a teasing smile in return. “So, yes, I was thinking, how would you feel about morning sex? We’ve never actually done it due to Harriet’s school schedule but Mrs Hudson has offered to take her to school today so we … will have the flat … to ourselves.” Sherlock grinned, punctuating the last half of his speech for affect.
“For the love of God, Sherlock. Do you have to do that, it's our daughter's birthday.” John half-moaned, watching as his partner continued to seduce him.
“Oh. You have? Right, well that's good. So, do you want to kiss again?”
. If he would just realise the damage he's doing and stop.
“Come on then, you two. Breakfast is ready.” John grinned, summoning the pair to follow him.
John doesn't notice Sherlock trying to suppress the shiver down his spine as John touches his face.
John pulls out and pushes back in slowly, kissing his boyfriend's knee.
You really
would have been, still chasing that piece of skirt around.” Greg grins, nudging his friend.
“Say it, John. Please. Before I ...” Sherlock begs, struggling to hold back.
They watched as the future Sherlock waited for someone to answer the door, and Sherlock mirrored his fidgety future self.
“John, what are you …
“Like you don't love it.” Sherlock grins, climbing into John's lap.
Maggie looks the other vampire up and down and thinks that the two
“There's gonna be a little pain but it'll subside, okay.”
But now at seventeen, John drags Sherlock to a Christmas house party and the boys end up under the mistletoe.
“Me too!” Greg giggles back, clinking their bottles together with a grin. “Ooh, guess what … I know a secret you don't know.”
“I know it’s not but then again, I know I probably don’t want to
Please don't hate me, I just felt I had to write this as everyone has their first heartbreak xxx
“I know, Gregory. I truly only wanted you not to worry. And I had it in hand.” Mycroft replies, resting his hands on top of Greg's.
“I'm ready, John.” Sherlock moans into John's lips.
“If it gets you off my case, then I will.” Maggie smirks, winking at her friend.
"Are you okay?" Maggie asks again, kneeling down by his side and placing a gentle hand on his shoulder.
“Oh.” Maggie replies sadly, falling silent.
Sherlock sighed and glared at his daughter; who promptly glared back.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Watson. Doctor John Watson, yes?” The voice asks him, pulling him carefully to his feet.
“Okay.” Sherlock replied, speeding up and making each thrust harder and harder; causing the doctor to moan louder with each thrust.
"What was the first?" I ask with a smile, I already know.
“Oh God, you're vile, Greg. I mean
"Doctor."
"A what?" Maggie asks in confusion, because obviously she didn't hear him correctly.
John kisses Sherlock's curls and runs his hand up his boyfriend's back, settling it into Sherlock's hair.
“I might not, but
"Okay." John replied, closing the door and shaking his head.
John pulls out his favourite pair of faded grey skinny jeans and his tight black shirt; deciding that the full Goth-Rock look would be a bit too much for a party.
child, Sherlock." John corrected, wanting to punch the younger man.
"Well, actually ... I don't know. Mmm ... Good question. You'll have to find out."
"Thank you, Sherlock." John replied, tears in his eyes.
In all fairness, John did receive the letter two weeks ago but with all the course work he's had, he sort of forgot about it. And now, he's just told Sherlock he's leaving in
That's all the consent Sherlock needs as he digs his fangs into John's neck, still crying and holding the older man close.
good. So stop worrying, Mr Holmes." John smiled, stroking the curls on Sherlock's forehead.
“Fine!” Sherlock snaps, pulling himself up off the couch as well.
The Doctor waves goodbye before stepping into the TARDIS.
“I agree it would be in our best interests but we
She considers ringing Mycroft but decides against it. She knows why he wants to turn him; not just to save his life today or even to stop him dying of an injury in the future, the poor vampire is in love with the good doctor and wants to keep him forever.
to ask that question.” He replies, glaring at Sherlock again.
. But there's not even a single drop of blood and with Sherlock's sensitive sense of smell, the common household bleach used to clean up is making his nose itch and his eyes burn.
Mycroft is ready to argue with his brother until Sherlock moans loudly and he sees John's hand descending south on his brother's body.
“John, I didn't know when you'd be back. I got …
“I told you I'd make it good for you, baby. And it was, wasn't it? I bet you've been wanting to do that for a while. I
"He was chasing a monster. Then he asked me my name and when I told him, he said he'd see me soon."
“I've always wondered what you tasted like when you laugh.”
"Is that what you call yourself to everyone?"
“Oh. I'm sorry, Harry." Sherlock replies, cupping my chin softly.
He didn't speak this time, just gave me a sad smile and walked back into his time machine.
"We're back." The Doctor announced; the two hadn't spoken in over twenty minutes.
“Well, to be fair, we don't
“Sherlock, we're in the library, keep it down.” John whispers calmly, closing his text book.
“Well, apart from you and Father doing that
Sherlock smiles widely and runs his finger back up John's cock; earning another moan from him.
"Doctor?" Sherlock asked in confusion, spinning on his heels.
“You always be my fallen angel, Sher.” John breathes into Sherlock's lips, causing the younger teen to chuckle softly.
“Let's do this.” John sighs, standing closer to Sherlock.
John looks up at Sherlock through his eyelashes and smiles again, speeding up as he digs his nails into his boyfriend's hips; knowing that there'll be bruises on his beautiful pale body in a few days.
“Definitely a terrible man, Sherlock.”
Sherlock pulled out and thrust into the doctor harder, making John’s hips rise of the bed and a loud moan to escape his lips.
“Yes.”
“I'll make it good for you, I promise. It's alright. I got you, Sherl.” John whispers into Sherlock's ear, his hand pulling the strap through the buckle.
“Believe it or not, they gave me some supplies to fix it up myself. Apparently they needed me alive for something.” John replies with a humourless laugh.
“You know what I mean, sweetheart. I want to make love to you properly. Not fuck you roughly on a couch, so send your brother home and we can get to it.” John grins, climbing off Sherlock and heading to his mate's bedroom.
"Good."
John gently stroked Sherlock's inner thigh, reassuring him that it was okay.
“I know that too, baby.” Greg replies softly, letting his old pet name slip through for the first time in years. “And I will find him. Even if it takes me all night. I'll get our boy back safe.”
look.” John grins before disappearing into the bathroom.
“Baby?” Sherlock squeaks.
Sherlock's hand moves back up to John's arm and the younger teen tries to relax.
And John asks Sherlock about their future together.
John smiles softly, pulling away from Sherlock and bringing his hand up to his face. His tongue darts out to lick experimentally at his fingers, causing Sherlock to moan loudly.
“What?” Sherlock asks in confusion.
“What are you thinking about, John?” Sherlock whispers in his best friend's ear; low and seductive.
John tugs Sherlock's jeans and boxers down a little way, pulling Sherlock's erection out. Sherlock freezes up and his breath quickens.
"Yes, well, I've been taught well." Sherlock replies, kissing John slowly.
John screams in the otherwise quiet flat as Sherlock drinks his blood and waits to see if John can survive the ordeal.
"Damn it!" John exclaimed, throwing his favourite mug across the room and watching it smash into pieces.
to … we should take this slow.” John replies, finally looking his boyfriend in the eyes and stroking his cheek.
Don't worry, this wasn't inspired by the song by 3OH!3 ft Ke$ha (just in case you thought it was ;)) xxxxx
“I love you and I always miss you when we're apart, Sher.” John chuckles, resting his hands on Sherlock's hips.
don't wanna know what they're thinking.
I've had my way with it.” John growled dangerously, dragging Sherlock up by his shirt.
“I know you did, baby. And it was, it was perfect. You're so good to me, Sher.”
Or will he make a choice that could change their relationship forever?
“Has someone been threatening National Security, Mycroft? And committed
“I just … I was talking but you weren't listening. Well, you were
“Hey. I didn't say it was easy for me to process. I thought I was going mad.” I laugh, giving him a little shove.
"Anything."
“I'm so glad she doesn't want to use that thing around us. You can hardly control yourself at the best of times.”
Sherlock looked at the console and replied, "To what exactly?"
destructive hobby?”
I laugh at the younger man because it's such a typically Sherlockian thing to do.
There's a pause as both men process this, of course their other halves have unofficially dubbed them as boyfriends but officially, well ...
the husband hadn't been so good at covering
"Then sit, we're going seeing Aunty Alcoholic Harriet."
“Your dad is in the kitchen and your presents are next to the couch.” Sherlock grinned, causing his daughter to blush at her actions.
“Yeah, love, they do. Is that how you feel?”
But being Sherlock's flatmate probably isn't the best standing point.
“God, I've wanted to fuck you since I met you but
“So have you worked it out yet?” He asks me, so I smile back at him.
, saying that in a well-to-do place like this at such an early hour.” John replies, raising his voice so the nosey old biddy can hear him before breaking into giggles.
Harriet grabbed the rest of her presents and made her way out of the room when she heard her dad call her name.
"Well, I could use other ways." Sherlock smiled seductively as his hand roamed down John's chest and towards his crotch.
“Urg.” Sherlock groans again, batting John's hand away.
“What?”
“I was
“And what would that be?” John asks curiously, quirking an eyebrow at Greg.
“In fact, Sherlock,
“Y' should be.” Sherlock mutters again, snuggling down under the covers.
"Later. I'm spent." John replied, grabbing the cover and pulling it over them. "Time to sleep."
“You're so beautiful, Sherlock.” John whispers into his boyfriend's lips, cupping his face in his hands.
“That's not funny, ya bastard.” Greg replies, fighting the urge to grin. “And if we're anything, we're
“Let it out, sweetheart. Let me hear it. Tell me how good it feels.” John whispers, kissing Sherlock's neck.
“You’ll never know unless you go for it, it’s no big loss if he isn't interested, is it?”
"She's amazing. Brilliant, in fact."
She thinks, heading back into the kitchen for another glass of wine.
“I think our daughter is referring to the
"Yes."
“God,
“For presents, actually, John.” Sherlock corrected with a smile, “I've taught you well, Harriet. And I'm so proud of you.” He adds, high-fiving his daughter.
“Yeah, they look fine. You okay, Sherl?” John replies, looking at Sherlock curiously as he sees the blush on the younger teen's face.
“Too much, mate! I'm fuckin' wasted. But, it's a fan-tastic party. I bloody luv it.” Greg grins, straightening himself and gripping John's shoulder for support.
Sherlock just chuckles at Maggie, before pulling out a cigarette and lighting it.
Sherlock is just about to reply when he hears a noise from the shadows and steps in front of Maggie.
“Leave, Mycroft. You won't want to see what happens next, especially not when your little brother is involved.” Sherlock says, looking at his brother carefully.
“I'll see you soon, love.”
“Can we trust you with it?” John asks carefully, raising an eyebrow.
Gosh, there's been a hell of a wait for this one. Sorry about that guys, real life does have a habit of getting in the way. Anyway, a long awaited update is here :) xxxx
"Wait, how many presents have you bought her? The only one I know about is the psychic necklace." Sherlock asks suddenly.
Sherlock stumbles as John pulls him up, his limbs still heavy and numb. John guides Sherlock into the shower, leaning him against the wall as he grabs shampoo/conditioner and soap to clean up his boyfriend with.
Six years ago, John went missing in action
Just a taste, that's all I need. No, can't do that to John. Must protect and keep him safe.
attention away from that shirt.” John grins, walking back to his friend.
Tears stream down Sherlock's face as he leans over John and presses his lips to his neck, opening his mouth to reveal his fangs.
“Fine. I'll prove it.” Greg smiles, eyeing the mistletoe that's being handed around to everyone.
“We still have time. You can do a lot in six days.” John smirks suggestively, sliding onto the bed to sit behind his boyfriend.
Even despite the long-distance of it.
Suddenly, the door bursts open and there stands Anthea, looking every bit as worn and tired as the three men, gasping for air as her long hair fights to free itself from its hair tie.
"John!" Sherlock replied, grabbing John and hugging him tight, John responding in kind.
leave.” Sherlock replies, waving a hand to his land lady.
“So, how are you and Sherlock doing?” Greg asks with a smirk as John sits down at the table.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and sighed.
"Aren't we already crossing the timelines?" Sherlock asked smugly.
"Thank you, love."
The man gave a brilliant grin and looked at the younger man with bright eyes.
“Since you're always my voice of reason!” Sherlock snaps back, getting in John's face.
"Mr Holmes-Watson." Sherlock corrected with a smile.
Even in his half-waking state, the doctor could feel Sherlock’s eyes on him and almost trying to will him to full awakening. John chuckled and opened his eyes; his deduction being correct.
She continues walking past the street the guy came from when she hears a noise from the alley.
“Thank God.” John sighed in relief, after all, they were running out of places to hide all of Harriet's alien presents.
“I'm sorry, Sher. I really am. I'm so, so sorry.” Greg soothes softly, as Sherlock's broken sobs reverberate through his own chest.

“If you want to. But I warn you, I sleep
anything with anyone before?”
“I'm sorry. For turning you. But I couldn't lose you, John. I know we haven't been together long but I had no choice.” Sherlock sighs sadly, tears appearing in his eyes.
"What?"
John moaned in response as Sherlock got back to work on his cock.
“Well, me and your father thought it would be a good idea for you to interact with the other children but, we know you hate breakfast club so we’re sending you a little later so you can still socialise but you don’t have to be there long.” John smiled at his daughter.
“Sherl, you alright?” John asks softly, looking over the edge of the bed.
Sherlock looks in the mirror and quirks an eyebrow.
"Well ..."
“Merry Christmas, John.”
“This is nice. I could get used to this.” John sighs happily, once they're both back curled up in bed together.
"Payback." John whispered into the detective's neck.
” Sherlock replies awkwardly, looking down at his pants and trying to make John understand. “I mean,
Harriet looked around at her presents and spotted one from their old friend; the Doctor. She picked it up and ripped off the wrapping paper, wondering what he had got for her this time.
"I thought my hostility towards your dates spoke volumes."
.” Sherlock whispers sheepishly, looking down at the floor.
“That was … thank you, John. You were perfect.” Sherlock whispers, kissing the bite on John's neck.
"Okay then." Sherlock replied, pulling the sleepy doctor into his arms.
"What?"
getting all dressed up now.” Sherlock smirks, looking at John through his eyelashes.
, Doctor Watson.”
"Are you saying that I would make something like that up? Is that why they call you 'Three Continents Watson'?"
"But they're just fiction, like characters in a book." She sounds scared, balling her hands into fists to hide her shaking.
I hope you all like this. I skipped ahead a few years. Just to keep the story moving along. So I decided to change this around a bit as it was probably a bit confusing so bear with me please xxxx
We wrestle a bit longer until I manage to throw him off me and back into the alley he dived out of, I instantly leap on him and use my strength to wrestle the knife out of his hands so he resorts to punching and kicking me instead.
“Well, we’ll have breakfast first and when Mrs Hudson takes Harry to school, we can have some … fun.” Sherlock grinned wickedly.
"Right.” She replies in a nervous whisper, stepping back from the strange man. “What did you mean, you need ... blood?"
“You look fucking gorgeous when you're so into your work.” John comments, seeing his boyfriend practically poured over an experiment involving; what he hopes, are
“I’m sure Mrs Hudson wouldn’t mind taking Harry to school early. She can finally go to that breakfast club.” John smiled suggestively.
“We haven't done it yet. We're taking it slow because Sherlock's never done it before.”
“I don't think I can … hold on …
“You're going to need to drink, John. Come …”
“Yeah, but we know them better.” John replies, giving a wistful sort of smile.
“Oh God, you're not thinking of setting John up with the
Sherlock sits down next to his partner as they watch their daughter leave.
“Let's go home, baby. You have a lot of explaining to do. And like I said I've
Suddenly the bedroom door explodes and there stands Greg Lestrade, a gun aimed at Davies' head.
"Yes, and you can have it when you're nineteen." Sherlock replied, eyeing the necklace carefully and placing it on the mantel.
“Living together in a flat in London, of course. I'll be doing my consulting work, which you will help me do and then you'll still be complaining about all the experiments I do.” Sherlock says matter-of-factly.
“Then what do you propose, Sherlock? Turning him into a vampire? Are you even going to ask him or just bite him and hope he's okay with it?” Mrs Hudson snaps, wondering how her poor boy could be so reckless.
"Sherlock. You daft, stupid, wonderful and utterly beautiful man! Why didn't you tell me?"
It's not that she isn't glad for the extra money but she'd already cleared it with her boss to leave early tonight. It wasn't her fault that lazy shit, Marcus couldn't be arsed turning up.
“I know, love. I am trying to. I've got to go. I'll ring you when I've checked the next one.” Greg sighs, rubbing a hand through his silver hair.
“Oh, so now you want to talk, do you? What are you going to tell me next? That
“I promise.” John whispers back, resting his hand on Sherlock's cheek. “You ready?”
His hands slammed against the walls of the shower as he felt himself on the edge, before his ears made out the sound of Sherlock jerking himself off and that was it, the doctor came with a low moan and nearly collapsed with the force of his orgasm.
“Baby, don't you remember last night? I thought I'd be the one with the hazy memory due to alcohol but you, you were barely even tipsy.”
“Never said I didn't.” John smiles, resting his hands on Sherlock's hips.
make an attractive couple. Sherlock being lean and beautiful while John is broader but equally as handsome.
"Sounds just perfect, Sherlock." John pulled Sherlock in for another kiss, his hand still in the detective's hair.
“I've missed you, mon chéri.” Sherlock whispers, wrapping his arms around his husband.
"Mark me. Bite me. Make me yours.”
The blow to his head is serious and the knife sliced through a main artery in John's chest, meaning he doesn't have long to live.
"Okay, amazing. And you swear I said that?"
“What happens?”
“I know you do.” John replies, smiling up at Sherlock. “Talk to me, tell me how it feels.”
“It's just a precaution, my love. I nearly … I nearly attacked her once … I hadn't fed in days but I'd had heroin at the time and I … I went for her.” Sherlock murmurs softly, lying down properly.
“Wow, you must be some kind of genius then.”
John finally gives in and starts to suck his boyfriend off with slow, long strokes, making sure to lick the underside. Sherlock's hands bury themselves in his boyfriend's hair, gripping tightly as he thrusts into his mouth.
the husband had made checks on their life insurance.
I go and call for a cab, I already know he's going to follow so why should I waste time waiting for him?
The Doctor ducked behind a car, gesturing for Sherlock to do the same.
crimes that could have him killed.” Sherlock replies with a sinister smile.
“What?” John asks in a confused tone, looking over at Maggie carefully.
"Bloody hell, John." Sherlock gasped, gripping John's hair. "Now I know why they call you 'Three Continents Watson'."
"Three years into your future. Do you want to see?"
I try to help the doctor as he practically lifts me up each stair but it's just too hard; my head drops to his shoulder and I see the blood running through his veins.
"Okay, then." Harriet replied, quirking an eyebrow.
“After breakfast it is then.” John sighed, moving his hand back up Sherlock’s chest and letting it rest there.
“Art, Psycology and Maths.” Sherlock replies, pulling on a shirt and looking around for his jeans.
“It's John Watson, Sir. He's alive.” She replies, pointing to her laptop.
I should know because I'm Harriet. I'm fifteen years old and just as clever as Father, if not more so. But I'm also compassionate and like to help people, just like Dad. All in all, my dads are raising me well.
"I said thank you."
." Sherlock saluted before running off to the bedroom.
"John?"
“That was my first kiss.” Sherlock whispers, a blush creeping up his cheeks.
“Sherlock, who is he?”
“You're the one who's so weak-willed, John. If you had more
Sorry, I almost forgot. My name is Arthur Conan-Doyle and please, enjoy my other stories;
Sherlock continues to ruffle his hair frustratedly as it refuses to co-operate.
John snarls at the young girl causing her to slowly back away from the pair.
"Where are we? In time I mean." Sherlock asked, looking around.
John feels his heart pounding in his chest at the realisation that once again he's on the brink of death.
The Doctor ran to the door and pulled the doors open.
But of course, now there's a war on and Sherlock has to admit he's more than a bit terrified. Obviously, he knew this was likely to happen, what with all the news reports and he knew John would have to go out into the field one day but after three days of no replies, Sherlock thinks the worst.
know. You want to pin me to this bed and
“John! Can I get you a drink?” The older teen greets drunkenly, stumbling over to the two teens.
“It doesn't have to be a snog or anything. Just longer than twenty seconds.” Greg replies, unsuccessfully trying to suppress his amused smirk.
Sherlock ran his hand down John's chest, softly stroking the old scar on his shoulder.
“Shut up, Sherlock!” Both men shout together, Greg still glaring angrily at his partner.
Even John works out that foul play was involved and that the husband murdered his wife to claim the life insurance, simple really.
"Sherlock, we'd known each other five minutes ..."
“Urg, Mycroft is making out with Lestrade!” Sherlock growls, snapping his head back towards the door and allowing John to drag him out.
“I'll have a car come for you in five.”
“I'm not going to draw a clown face on you, I'm only lining your eyes.” John smiles, holding Sherlock's face gently as he applies the eye-liner.
go in?" Sherlock asked, slowly standing up.
“No, thank you, my love. Thank you for letting me do this and thank you for saving my life in so many ways.”
And what will John say when he finds out what Sherlock's been doing?
John felt himself going hard already.
“I'm in love with you too, Sherlock. I think I always have been.” John sighs softly, nuzzling Sherlock's hair and breathing in the scent of his shampoo.
“You’re terrible, Sherlock.”
“For your information, I was asked to recover my niece after she was kidnapped!”
.” Sherlock drawled, rolling his eyes.
Obviously, I stayed awake all night wondering if I'd lost my mind and if it wasn't for the blood on Sherlock's shirt, I could have convinced myself that it hadn't happened.
Sherlock brings his other hand up to the back of John's neck as the older teen's tongue runs teasingly across Sherlock's lips. The younger teen opens his mouth and allows John's tongue to roam his mouth; causing them both to moan softly.
“You mean the British Government can't find six British soldiers?! Then what bloody good are you?!” Sherlock yells, throwing the folder at Mycroft.
He kissed Sherlock forcefully and passionately causing Sherlock to blush and cough awkwardly.
I told you I was a clever kid, but I think that little discovery upset my dads a bit.
again.” Harriet sighed, dropping into Mrs Hudson's other armchair.
"How ..."
Sherlock flinches slightly but doesn't push John away, he just breathes deeply and waits for the pain to give way to pleasure.
” Sherlock gasps, his grip in John's hair getting a little painful for the older teen.
“Not blatantly obvious to me, it wasn't.” Greg sighs, slumping down in the chair Sherlock vacated.
"Wow." John replied, once the kiss broke.
"Wait, three years?! I wait that long to return?"
The Doctor stood and headed for the TARDIS, watching as future Sherlock turned and walked the opposite way up the street.
“So you kept it from me instead!” Greg yells, combing a hand through his hair.
And was creating experiments with her dad by eleven.
"Not good?" Sherlock asked, suddenly looking worried.
“Come here.” John smiles softly, blobbing a bit of gel onto his hands and styling Sherlock's hair with it.
“Yes, of course.” The stranger replied, utterly unconvinced.
“That didn’t stop you before.”
“You too.” John smiles, moving back over to his bedside table. “Have you finished in the bathroom, I'm gonna do my make up.”
“That's the point, Sherlock.” John grins, styling his hair into a messy bed-head style.
“You had just been promoted, I didn't want to jeopardise that, Gregory.” Mycroft says softly, turning to look at his partner.
“Sherlock, go and get in the car.”
She climbs out of bed and heads downstairs, looking forward to a nice cup of tea and some breakfast.
Of course, he was a complete arse when Mike first introduced us, but he was clever and mysterious, and quite amazing with his deductions; even if they were personal to me.
Sherlock disappears into their bedroom and returns with the necklace, looking wearily at John.
“I think I'm going to be sick.” Maggie replies, looking away from the vampire.
Sherlock holds the door open for John before following him out and locking up.
Meanwhile, Sherlock is causing trouble with staff and students with his experiments
The mystery girl is revealed and she's none other than John and Sherlock's future daughter.
"Nice to meet you, Maggie." The vampire smiles, struggling to his feet.
“Get off me, Lestrade. You can't drag me around like this. I'm a grown man.”
"Hello?"
John smiled in satisfaction and climbed out of bed to get a shower.
“Sherlock Holmes. I'm a consulting detective, well, consulting vampire. Only one in the world.”
“Oh, yes, because turning you into an immortal blood drinker during sex would have surely made you the most
"A friend of ours; Irene." Sherlock replies, almost bitterly.
“You've become a real bastard, Sherlock Holmes. This is no laughing matter. He's only done all this so he can help you. And you dare stand there and make jokes about it! I should have given you a crack years ago!” Greg yells, raising his hand to Sherlock, hating how funny he thinks this all is.
Oh and for those of you who are Marvel fans, you'll recognise the code name for John which is Mockingbird. Its a reference to the character Barbara Morse from the Marvel universe who has a Ph-D (a form of doctorate) and is code named Mockingbird. Kind of my sly way of crossing fandoms. Wren is also a reference to Eurasian Wren which is the national bird of England and the smallest of the bird species, a slight nod to Mycroft's minor position in the British Government ;) xxxx
“What do you … Greg!”
It's not a bad year but very different from my own, I must say. And I do miss John and Sherlock terribly.
John continues to kiss and nibble at Sherlock's neck as he slowly runs his hands up his boyfriend's chest and begins to undo his buttons slowly.
"I've loved many people." The Doctor replies sadly.
"Where are we?" Sherlock ran to the Doctor excitedly. "And who's that little girl?" He added with confusion.
“Sherl, I
John giggles again, putting his make up away. “There, you're done.” He smiles, grabbing his hair gel to do his hair.
He shifts over and sits up as Sherlock pulls out some lube and pours it on his fingers. The younger man starts to prepare himself and John watches with undisguised hunger as Sherlock moans softly.
“Yes, Sherlock. You look like a doll.” John replies distractedly, shoving on his boots and lacing them up.
“Ooohh I see. Mycroft's got you on a chain with a big yard, has he?” John grins, nudging his friend.
The younger teen's eyes scrunch up as he feels the impending orgasm and he tries to pull John off so that he can let go but John just drops his head harder and suddenly Sherlock is seeing stars; his grip on his boyfriend's hair loosening as his eyes flutter shut.
.” Sherlock moans softly, voice low and husky again.
Maggie thinks to herself, putting the sim in her pocket and turning back to the injured man.
. Promise me you won't die.” Sherlock whispers, looking up into John's eyes.
. Uh, more,
a body, Mycroft! Just confirm it already so we can put this to bed!” Sherlock yells, jumping up from his chair and swaying.
“You're welcome. Now, time to sleep. You will need to feed in a few hours. Mrs Hudson has gone to her sister's for the night.” Sherlock replies, climbing off John and crawling up the bed.
Greg stumbles off and up to the group of teens, “Hey, can I borrow this?”
“Oooh, thinking of getting off with someone are we, Lestrade?” The young teen asks with a cheeky smirk.
me.” John whispers softly, continuing to lick Sherlock's neck.
This is set right after the last chapter so Harriet is still eleven (I changed her age, just because lol). And she still has to be taken to school because it’s miles away (just go with it) xxxxx
“I'm surprised you noticed.” John chuckles, leaning up and kissing Sherlock.
Mycroft rolls his eyes, opens the front door and disappears into the night.
Will Sherlock let the man he loves die
"Let's head off then."
“Who bit her?”
“Just remember, you're not the only one who can be manipulative.” John grinned back, pulling his partner towards their bedroom.
“Hey, you.” John smiles sleepily, eyes half-closed and a yawn approaching.
“What for?”
“Precisely.” Sherlock grins wickedly.
please.”
“Jawn … are you sure? I mean … I wouldn't
"It comes close? I show you an amazing time machine like this and it only 'comes close' to impressing you? Honestly, I knew I should have chosen a regular human."
"Well, I'll see you out then, Doctor."
.” Sherlock smiles sleepily, looking at John through half-closed eyes.
“Of course I would, love. Distance doesn't mean I'd want you any less.” John replies surely, reaching out to touch Sherlock's curls.
"Oh this man isn't a blogger. What is a blogger anyway, is that internet writing? Never mind. He's wanted to be a writer since he was a child and after meeting you and John, he was inspired."
"We should sort you out now." Sherlock breathed, stroking John's crotch.
“Are you up for a little faster, John?” Sherlock whispered into John’s ear in a husky and seductive voice.
“Oh, God. Sherlock, you're a terrible man.” John moaned, gripping Sherlock's damp hair tightly as the younger man did that terribly wonderful thing with his tongue.
Once Sherlock had finished, he grabbed the soap and started to wash John slowly.
"I'm taking you home."
John relaxes into the kiss and moans softly; completely at odds with his earlier outburst.
Premature greyness in his early thirties and he's pretty sure between the Holmes boys and John Watson, they're the route of it all.
“Okay.”
“Like what you see?” John asks innocently, fluttering his eyelashes at Sherlock.
“I heard you the first time and I told you no.”
John blushed but wrapped his arms around the younger man and kissed him softly as Sherlock ran his fingers through John's hair while they kissed.
"Cool. What's it do? Or does it react with chemicals?"
“If you want to. And if you're sure that you won't regret it in the morning.”
“In a minute, let me finish.” John scolds, as he adds some mascara to his fine lashes. “Right, get here then.”
things.”
The waitress returns with the muffin and smiles sweetly at John, taking his money and heading back to the counter.
“Why are you lonely?” Maggie asks softly, raising a hand to Sherlock's cheek.
John was dramatically losing control but did as Sherlock asked; biting him hard and sucking at the skin, leaving a dark purple mark that was beautiful against the stark paleness of Sherlock's skin.
Of course, their story is much longer than this but unfortunately I'm relying on the Doctor to bring me news of the Holmes-Watson family now.
"A vampire." The man husks, creeping closer to the girl.
“If I do scream, it won't be for you, dear brother. I can …
Sherlock grabs the mobile and relays the address, telling Greg that John is hurt and he is taking him home.
, are you?”
. I don't care about eating right now. I can manage without food for a while.”
John smiles and goes back to kissing Sherlock's neck, nibbling slightly as he pulls Sherlock tighter.
“Stop worrying, Dad. I promise from now on, I'll only use my powers of evil for good reasons.” Harriet grinned, proving she was getting more like her father every day.
“Sorry, Father.” She replied sheepishly.
“What do you mean 'friends with benefits'?” John asked carefully, causing a snigger from Sherlock.
“Please, John. I think I've waited long enough.”
“I'm sure they'll find him, dear. We're not the type to leave our boys behind, are we, Mr Holmes?”
John smiles softly and grabs the muffin, breaking a piece off and holding it to his boyfriend's lips. Sherlock takes it between his lips and uses his tongue to slip the piece of muffin and John's finger into his mouth.
two years ago.” Sherlock replies cruelly, but there's no mistaking the hitch in his voice at the word 'death'.
“John, what are you …
“Well … never mind. So, if you're going to break into my house at half six in a morning, I should at least know your name.”
"What? Oh God, I told you that!"
"John. Stop it."
fucking Romeo and Juliet. Star crossed bloody lovers who topped themselves at the end, yeah, right. We're just Greg and Mycroft. No labels.”
“Good.” John smiles, pulling the shirt from his shoulders slowly.
I don't want him to leave me, I've actually started liking him being around and doing …
“Why would I change my mind? I
“Ah, your decision, not mine. I’d quite happily pound you into the mattress right now but, you said we have to think of our daughter.”
“Stop thinking so much, babe. It's
I got a new pair of earrings from Emma and a new necklace from Jade.” Harriet smiled brightly.
“Piss off, Lestrade. You can't tell me what to do.” Sherlock scoffs, grabbing his mobile and wallet from the table.
Can I first just apologise for my absence, real life tends to get in the way AND I have a new job - yay. On the up side only two chapters left after this guys (I'm adding a final one given where this is heading) and I've already started the next chapter after this :) xxxx
“Love some. Thanks, Mrs H.”
This follows on from the last chapter but about two months into John and Sherlock's relationship. It's a long one so bare with me :) xxx
“You're doing what?” Sherlock yells, slamming his bag down on the table.
An old woman across from them throws the teens a glare and huffs, making it known that apparently that kind of talk isn't welcome in a café at 11am.
John moans and bites his lip, still surprised at Sherlock's new found confidence in his sexuality and how he teases the older teen with it.
“John? You're back?” Sherlock asks in a shocked tone.
The look of surprise is amusing but he quickly recovers from it and asks if I'd like some tea.
"Please, what?" John teased, trying to ignore his raging erection.
“Yeah right, Greg. So what are you then? Fuck buddies? Friends with benefits? Romeo and Juliet?”
"Is that what you feel now?" The Doctor asks with a smile.
“As in Satanists and what not.”
“Oh, please, if you two are going to have a
Maggie turns down the next street, debating whether to get chips for tea or just have some toast when she gets in.
“Slow down, baby. You haven't eaten all day. I don't want you passing out on me.” John breathes, trying not to moan as Sherlock nibbles his neck.
"Don't worry 'bout it, you've said before that Friday is when all the drunk buggers come in to sober up. Tomorrow will be fine and I'll tell Tisha. You get some sleep and be ready for an all-night party tomorrow!" Amy replies, understandingly.
“Yeah, well.” Maggie replies with a sad sigh, pouring herself a glass of wine.
“Let's work up to that, baby? First, let's try this.” John smiles mischievously, rolling Sherlock over and sliding down his body.
"Sherlock Holmes, right? I’m the Doctor. Did you know that one day a man is going to write stories about you? He's called ..."
“Why?” Maggie asks curiously, staring up at the sky.
“Not worried enough to find John though.”
He reaches over to the bedside table and pulls off the box of tissues, cleaning himself up quickly.
“Well, try and get some rest. It's a long journey. That goes for the rest of you too.” The operative replies, nodding to the rest of John's troop. “And we'll need that shoulder checked out too.”
"Of course. I've always known."
“I was just thinking, besides the burning and blood drinking, nothing's really changed.”
“Used to what?” John called after her, but didn't get a response.
It's a good enough answer for me.
“What's going on, dear?” Mrs Hudson, Sherlock's land lady asks carefully, having heard the yelling.
“I didn't tell you to stop, Sherlock. Get back to it.” John ordered, causing Sherlock to shudder.
"Leave it, Sherlock." The Doctor replied darkly.
“God, yes, Sherlock. Faster.”
Final chapter, guys. And its a little angst but with a happy ending. Hope you all enjoy it.
Sherlock applies enough pressure to Mr Cambria's throat that he struggles to breathe before he passes out.
“I’m the Doctor. And I’m a traveller, I was looking for a companion and I thought who better than the great Sherlock Holmes. I mean, you’ll be able to understand all my technical language better than anyone.”
“Oh, you’re definitely your father’s daughter, alright. Same dramatic flair.” John grinned at his daughter, who shot him a glare in response.
John shot him a glare that clearly said 'shut the fuck up' and Sherlock went back to his food; albeit still smirking to himself.
John hummed in agreement and the vibrations shot through Sherlock, this time he didn't have time to suppress the loud moan that escaped.
“Under the bed were you threw them last night while you were sulking.” John replies, opening another bedside drawer and pulling out a bottle of whiskey.
The next thing I know, we're in a cab and I can hardly keep my eyes open as John tries to keep me from unconsciousness.
“That's confidential information, Mrs Hudson.” Mycroft snaps, glaring at the land lady.
“Oh, I didn't. Kate told me that it was lunch time before she saw my experiment and started screaming.” Sherlock grins, a shimmer of glee in his eyes.
“I'm not your
John caught Sherlock’s smirk from across the room and tried to ignore it.
John walked away and Sherlock was greeted with silence.
“Don't frown, you'll get wrinkles.” John's grin drops to a playful smirk as he continues to line his eyes with the black pencil.
Tentatively, John brings a hand up to Sherlock's curls, tangling his fingers in them and pushing his head slightly so the kiss deepens. Sherlock's eyes flutter and he feels like his brain is going fuzzy, caught up in the moment, in John.
“Just relax, baby. Let it happen. I got you.” John replies softly, resting his hands on Sherlock's hips.
"I know it's impossible, considering it was my genetic material, but she's starting to look like you too, John."
“Wow, that was a really nice dream. But just a dream.” John sighs to himself, rubbing his eyes.
"Yes, I love him." Sherlock growls in a low tone.
? Never mind, where's my converse?” Sherlock asks, shaking his head and searching around their room for his shoes.
dead until we find a body, Sherlock.” Mycroft sighs, having had this argument one too many times.
“Now you’re being incredibly dull, John.” Sherlock replied in a bored tone.
“Keep going. Come on, baby. Keep going, please.” John moaned encouragement to the younger man and that was enough to send Sherlock over the edge and cause a white blur behind his eyes as he came loudly.
John smiles and hugs Sherlock a little tighter, “Merry Christmas, Sherlock.”
"Making tea in the kitchen."
“But baby, it was good, right?” Davies asks, looking a little confused.
“No.” Sherlock snaps, his head snapping back round to glare at Greg.
“Cult?”

“Wait, I'm
“It's Christmas day, we don't have school.” Sherlock replies in a confused tone.
“I said,
John startles awake suddenly, trying to remember where he is.
don't want this.” Sherlock replies, sounding almost defeated.
"So are you, Mr Holmes."
That was why he was stood in the graveyard watching John and Mrs Hudson mourn his death. He smiled sadly as Mrs Hudson recalled his atrocious habits in explanation as to why John was angry.

. So vampires
to sell. We had a deal.” Davies grins, licking his lips.
Unfortunately, that's the worst mistake the pair make because as soon as Sherlock steps outside, a figure appears in the darkened hallway outside the bedroom.
“So you expect me to wait around for you then?” Sherlock asks, looking over his shoulder at John.
“If it's with the right person, yeah.” John breathes, laughing softly at the fact that he's just had amazing sex with his best friend.
They continued to watch as future Sherlock suddenly runs down the steps and hides in the doorway of Speedy's cafe.
“Like that, yes, Sher. There. Oh, God!” John continued his praising of Sherlock.
Sherlock hadn't dared say anymore to him, he sensed that this man was very dangerous and he didn't want to make him angry.
"Just help me, please."
I agree and sit down at the kitchen table. I wait for him to mention about the events of last night but he doesn't.
"You're alive." John stammered, still gripping Sherlock.
“Hey, what's up? I thought we were having fun.” John whispers softly, looking rejected.
"Sherlock?"
bet you've been wanting to do something
“God, you're mad. Come on, take a seat and eat your muffin.”
John stalks closer to Sherlock and flashes his fangs in warning, causing Maggie to take a few steps back.
It's been two months since I moved into Baker Street now, and from that very first moment it was hard to deny there was some chemistry between us.
“That thing they do that I'm not supposed to know about yet. The
Anyway, back to the case; stolen artefacts, money laundering, murder. Oh, I love the fun ones.
Harriet knocked gently on Mrs Hudson's door, smiling gratefully when she opened the door and ushered the girl in.
"We've never had pet names for each other."
, I was making friends. You always tell me to make friends.”
For once, Sherlock was terrified, more than he'd ever been in his life and he decided not to ask again.
, ya know.” John adds, chewing his bottom lip.
John walked back into the living room with his tea and looked his partner over carefully.
When I wake, John is gone but I'm still on the couch so maybe now is the best time to feed.
Sherlock stops dead and looks at Greg in the eyes, “John's dead. It doesn't matter
"Right."
“She's going to be eighteen before we know it, Sher.” John sighs sadly.
"And what about Harriet?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock nods in reply, gripping out to John as though he'll vanish like smoke in the wind.
“Yeah, I suppose you're right. And besides, I've always wanted to be a doctor. I always thought it was something I was good at, taking care of people.”
The Doctor pulls a face and I just chuckle. It's nice when Father shows affection. I guess Dad has had some effect on him.
"Doctor, I meant to thank you ... For what you did for me."
“Urg.” Sherlock groans, rolling over and burying himself further into the blanket.
“I told you, I don't do that. And you weren't complaining when I was sucking your cock, were you, arsehole?”
Will Sherlock kiss his best friend because he's had a crush on him for four years or will he back out to save his friendship?
“Well, I have such an enthusiastic partner so it only seems fair.” John grinned wickedly.
“Morning.” Sherlock smirks, crawling up John's body to kiss him softly.
“You taught our daughter how to blackmail people? Really, Sherlock?”
After Sherlock reveals personal things about Greg's life
Hurry
“And now you must go home. Get some rest and take the next three days off.”
“Then you shouldn't be discussing me with friends,
Sherlock threw the newspaper down and sprinted after John, slamming the bedroom door shut after him.
. Now!” Greg orders, leaving no room for argument.
“Well, after breakfast you can open your presents, then I've invited some of your friends around for a party. They can sleep over too, if you want.”
"Okay." Sherlock replied, eying the Doctor cautiously.
She sighs but backs away from the younger man, turning around and heading back to her flat.
"Calm down, John." Sherlock's tone was steady and low, making John want to punch him.
“No, but I can taste
Sherlock pulled away to grab the lube and a condom from the bedside cabinet as John smiled in anticipation.
Sherlock for once decides to keep his mouth shut and go back to staring into the fire.
sulking!” Sherlock snaps, crawling under his bed to grab them. “Are you ready?”
“... Never mind. It wouldn't be right. You'd end up lonely, like me.”
“Guess, I should have expected that.” John sighs, opening the door and watching his boyfriend curl up onto their bed.
“I should let you suffer, Holmes. Don't think I don't know manipulation when I see it.” John smirked dangerously, seeing Sherlock's disappointed expression.
“Well, we know were
“Oh.”
Greg pulls away from the kerb and continues his hunt for the younger Holmes. Finally, eight drug dens later with a lead telling him were the younger man might be and Greg pulls up to the kerb of the shadiest den he's seen so far.
“Shortly after John went into the army, I found Sherlock high in his room. It was weed at the time and I hoped that if he must do drugs to cope with his situation, then that's as bad as it would get. Until two years later when I found him unconscious with a needle in his arm. You were liaison for a case in Cardiff at the time so I felt no need to worry you.” Mycroft replies carefully, standing in front of the fire place  with his arms behind his back.
“Why are you laughing?” Sherlock asks in an annoyed tone, folding his arms across his chest.
Sherlock rests his hand on John's waist, pulling him closer and nipping at his lip experimentally.
He looks down into his partner's face and sees his own tears reflected there, the lives of three men turned on their heads because of one man; John Hamish Watson.
John smiled in appreciation and continued to work on Sherlock until he panted out, "John ... I ... can't hold back ... for any longer."
“What does it mean 'missing in action', Mycroft? How can he be missing?” Sherlock asks desperately, re-reading the file in the hopes it will say something different.
.” Sherlock moans as John's lips find his neck again, gently nipping and licking.
“Three hundred and fifty?
and the mysterious mistress up quite so well.
John set a glass of orange down for Harriet and handed a tea to Sherlock before sitting down and grabbing his own breakfast.
“I told you, I thought it was obvious.”
“Fine.” Sherlock squeaks, running off to the bathroom.
John sighs softly and allows sleep to take over him once more, and if Sherlock invades his dreams then that wouldn't be so bad.
"You're so good with her, not that I doubted you would be. And I know it's difficult for you that we used Irene as a surrogate."
“Clearly. Mr Watson isn’t the only man in mourning, I see.”
“Did you …
. Fuck me, please.” Sherlock moans, running his hands down to John's arse as he continues to grind against him.
“Yeah. Anyway, bye guys. Hope you sort everything out.”
“Yes.” Sherlock replies huskily, reaching out to touch John's chest; glad that he can finally look
“We're doing great, yeah, mate. What about you and Mycroft?” John smirks back, sipping his tea gratefully.
"Harriet's making friends, John. You should be happy."
“And what do I do if you
.” John replies sleepily, relaxing into Sherlock's touch.
"You're .. What?” John asked with a smirk.
John is completely undone and he orgasms shortly after, looking up at the blood he's drawn from Sherlock's neck.
“Exactly. So I gave them some time to get it over with.”
Sherlock froze; they had never had pet names for each other before.
“Oh. I should have told you before then. Potential flatmates should know everything about each other, after all.” He grins at me, his fangs catching the light of fire.
Sherlock just smirks in response, hooking his finger into his boyfriend's belt hoop and pulling him forward for a kiss.
“I'm sorry, John. I … I thought you were dead. I … I just … I couldn't cope.” Sherlock sobs, the shudders shaking his small frame.
"You shouldn't be embarrassed, Sherlock. As much as I hate to admit, even people like us can love someone."
Hope you like this one. It's the first glimpse of my own original character. Sort of. Anyway, enjoy xxxxx
Sherlock leans in to kiss me one last time before moving back to his violin and starting to play a slow melody.
"Wow, I never thought I'd hear you say that, Sherlock."
“It's okay, Father. I know how much your work means to you.”
“Who are you?” Maggie asks in surprise, stepping round Sherlock to see the man.
“They're perfect together. And you know it. No one puts up with Sherlock like John does. And John totally fancies Sherlock, no matter how many times he denies it.”
“Goodnight, sweetheart.” John replies, smiling softly.
But what better time than now to give his boyfriend something before he leaves.
John spluttered on his drink and tried to process what she meant, because he hoped it didn't mean what he thought it did.
“You mean you … you really want to …”
“But in fact, Mrs Hudson, this really isn't a good time so please
“Mr Holmes sent us. Unofficially of course, so try to keep that bit to yourself, alright.” The man replies, a hint of a smile on his face.
“Are you ready to? Because if you're not, we can still wait, I'll be on leave after a few months.”
“It's okay, baby. Let it happen.” John soothes gently, his hand slowly moving Sherlock's belt.
John just sits on the desk and grins, watching his boyfriend's mental struggle and wondering what else he can convince him to do.
John closes the door softly, drops his bag on the floor and carefully makes his way over to Sherlock.
"Yes, well." The Doctor replied affronted.
for me. I want it to be special, because
“Don't talk to my land lady like that!” Sherlock shouts back, glaring at his brother.
“Ah, I thought that would get your attention.” The Doctor replied with a grin.
"It's like a mood stone. Sneaky way of finding out if you should talk to someone or not as they don't need to touch it, you can just tell what they're feeling from about two feet away." The Doctor replies with a smile.
Then the vampire turns on the mistress, grabbing her and shoving her against the wall with such force that she too blacks out.
(See the end of the chapter for
, huh? So you flashed your fangs at him then?”
“Urg, too tired.” Sherlock mumbles, eyes still closed.
“Oh.” Sherlock squeaks, looking down as he blushes a darker red.
“Goodbye, Mycroft.” Sherlock snaps back.
“Me too.” Sherlock replies softly, kissing John's forehead. “This is all I ever could have asked for, falling for my best friend.”
“Yes. Sleep now, my love.” Sherlock replies, kissing John before turning round and snuggling against his mate.
“Arrest him. For drug possession with intent to sell.” Greg tells the assisting police officers he texted before he entered.
Greg obviously walks out and John considers going after him
Sherlock stepped out of the TARDIS and immediately recognised where he was; Baker Street.
"I have since we got our civil partnership."
“Yes, Sir. Look.”
"I guess I have."
This time John blushed and smiled sweetly before going to get their daughter.
“Of course it is.” Sherlock replies, snuggling down and resting his head on John's chest.
He rolls his eyes when he gets to the top of them, walking down the hall and into the bedroom he hasn't stepped foot in in over ten years.
Sherlock nods in agreement, a lump forming in his throat at all the possible ways John could be killed.
Oh, wait, that sounds like the Doctor now. Well, until next time, goodbye, dear readers.
I can't help myself now, there's something about him in that moment. I lean in and kiss him. I don't know what makes me do it, just that it feels right.
“None of the other students said anything about the experiment.”
the truth.”
The second time Harriet met the Doctor. Unfortunately, John doesn't take this encounter too well, unlike Sherlock.
"Is John there?"
"Hey Amy, sorry but I won't be able to meet you and Tisha tonight. Only just finish and I'm totally beat. Maybe we can meet tomorrow, it is my day off after all."
He quickly heads back into the flat and dumps the bags onto the kitchen table, pulling off his shirt as he enters the bedroom.
So if you're reading my other fic Our Love Is A Tragedy, you'll know that I promised to update that before anything else but I'm struggling with inspiration.
