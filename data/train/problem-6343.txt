“We should head back. If we can convince Delmar that we have Beattie as well, maybe he’ll talk some more.”
Steve could have roared in satisfaction, unable to stop himself from reaching out to touch the tanned –
Steve took a final look around the dimly lit room before turning, jogging up the stairs and out of the speakeasy.
“He doesn’t mean it,” Steve said to Lucky, as if the dog could even get offended. “He’s a big softie. You’ll be in his lap by the end of the night.”
Loki barked out a hollow laugh. “Well, I hope you have nothing else to do today, because you’ll be here a long while. Over half the mobs in this city would kill to kidnap Stark. That worm is worth millions; his mind, billions.”
There was no one out there, no man, woman, or child that could make Tony Stark behave. Not even Steve could, on his best day. But here the man was, a man that Bucky had seen prowl into past meetings like a predator, armed only with a cutting smile and a wicked tongue, standing almost docile in front of the cameras. No snide comments, innuendos, anything. Just the cards. And after proof that everything that could have gone bad did, Tony Stark continued to be a dancing monkey for the FBI.
Tony hummed as he gratefully sucked the water down. “That bad, huh?” he managed to grit out after the cup was finally empty.
Howard never yelled at Steve. Steve was the one person who never got the tail end of the man’s temper.
Bucky almost missed it, the way it was uttered so quietly. “What do you mean you can’t? Steve, if anyone’s going to find him, it’s you. What happened at the warehouse?”
Bucky shot him an exasperated look. “Steve, you’ve been walking around this apartment like you’ve seen a ghost for the past three days. I haven’t seen you eat, you go in your room, but I don’t know if you’re sleeping. And today? I’m not even sure what you were doing during today’s podcast. I’m not an idiot, Steve. Something’s wrong.”
Pepper stared in shock down at the Avenger below her. Clint was staring at her, looking paler than a ghost.
“You’re right,” agreed Stark. “God,” he continued, “this is too fucked up. Life was so much easier when you stayed on your side of New York, and I stayed on mine.”
“Don’t be silly,” Tony smiled in return. “You have nothing to worry about, darling. Not as long as Natasha is still on this Earth.”
Natasha shot him a dirty look. “You two can’t be in there. You’re letting him get to your head; we’re not gonna get anywhere like this.”
Bucky thought to himself, mentally adding another item to his to-do list. “Uh, no,” he finally answered. “I think I’m alright. I’m pretty jittery, but I think it’s just an adrenaline rush. The new reactor has a higher cycling rate, so my body’s trying to adjust. I’ll, uh, let you know if anything changes.”
Steve took the tablet, looking down at the mess of information in front of him. It the end, none of it mattered. There was only one word that stuck out to Steve.
Hill sighed, but eventually gave in. “When the first shots went off, it was pure chaos. While originally, we thought that was HYDRA’s end game, we think they were using it as a smoke screen. Most of the targets went down in the Pentagon. While they were being taken out, HYDRA had a strike team waiting, using the panic to their advantage to try and break in. They were eventually subdued, but they’d made it all the way to the archives, no doubt to steal confidential information.”
Even if Hammer was working with HYDRA, there was no way they didn't view him as something dispensable. Considering the fact that no effort had been made by HYDRA to try and get him back, Steve guessed that the rival mob was confident that he didn't know anything worth saving. With that in mind, it had him and the rest of the group desperate to try and get something out of Loki.
“I know,” said Steve. “You think I want to leave you here? You think I don’t just want to go as well?”
“If not now, when?” Steve asked. “You know we’ve been putting off saying something. We’ve had plenty of time to talk about how distant he’s been lately, but we never have? If we don’t do it now, we might never. Don’t you want to know why?”
And there went that theory. Clint did see that there were a few members of the group that didn't appear to appreciate his statement. But he hadn't ever got a chance to confront them, as when he went to go look for them the next day, they were nowhere to be seen. All he did see was Steve, giving him another smile and a tight nod. He should have known that if Steve was willing to accept him being a deaf, homeless hitman, he wouldn't have a problem with him being gay.
While Tony saw his work in very high regard, he held himself to a pretty low standard. Tony knew he was nothing special; his dad has spent plenty of years drilling that into his brain. Living as he was, it was easy to forget that he wasn’t unique, that he wasn’t one of a kind. He wasn’t the only big guy walking around that had weight to their name. Leave it to The Captain to get a few words in to remind Tony that he isn’t any better than the homeless than sift through his trash.
Sam touched down on the Helipad softly, Steve jumping out before the blades had stopped completely. Of course, Steve had forgotten about his current status and quickly crumpled to the ground. He heard a shuffle before both Sam and Hill were pulling him up balancing one of his arms on each of their shoulders.
Natasha tutted quietly, slowly pulling her supporting hand away. Emily made a distressed noise but after catching Natasha’s raised eyebrow, she puffed out her chest and moved her hands to first position with a determined look on her face. The wobble of the supporting leg was still there, but Natasha just focused on the Emily’s chin, growing confidence raising it with each passing second.
Steve couldn’t help but smile. Last night was intense. It was nothing he had ever felt before. He knew now more than ever that he would do anything to keep Tony safe.
“Alright, quit your naggin’,” Steve grumbled, checking through the rest of the sheet bundles. He sighed when he reached the back of the shelf. “How much bigger?” he asked.
“I don’t need of the same guns, I need variety. I need a golden egg, and you’re going to help me get it.” He reached into his pocket, pulling out a worn photo to hand to Tony.
“No, those doctors saved his life. I just sat by and watched him bleed out on the table.” Steve huffed out a hollow laugh. “What good is Captain America if he can’t even protect his own husband?”
She let Ward lead her down the hallway, Sam trailing behind him. Once in the bathroom, she stalled, waiting the appropriate amount of time to wait before flushing an empty toilet. She walked over to the sink and turned on the water, looking in the mirror instead, fixing her hair. After a few moments she flicked the faucet off and wiped her hands with an unneeded paper towel.
Tony laughed again, relishing in the way it bounced off the walls of the small room. “You need me. You
A large chunk of roof came tumbling to the ground just feet from where Clint was sitting. Clint jumped, trying to retract further into the alley where he sat, looking up at his former home.
Seriously, that man could put a mother bear in its place. Of course, he was exactly the same when the team was dealing with HYDRA the first time. Sure, Steve hadn’t known half of the people for more than a week before their final showdown with HYDRA, but Steve had never faltered in treating everyone like family. That’s what Clint loved most about Steve. He was so genuine, so loyal; everyone had a place in The Commandos. Clint couldn’t hear, Dernier struggled with English, hell, Nat probably wasn’t a US citizen at the time, but Steve didn’t care.
He knew Tony would be pissed, probably even murderous, once he found out what Steve had done, but there was no changing his mind on this. The FBI would love to finally bag Tony Stark, but he wasn’t sure that they would. He was an asset for them, and if anything, they would lock him down with unbreakable contracts. Steve, however. Steve was a cash cow. He’d been on watch and wanted lists for longer than he could remember. And since Steve already knew everything that Tony did, there was no reason why he needed to be involved in this anymore.
“Relax, Rogers,” Natasha chided. “I think you’ll forgive me when I show you the presents I brought you.”
Steve did not have time for this. Tony was still in the building, and potentially hurt. He pulled as close as he could to Stark Industries, leveling out with the gaping hole, and flipped on auto pilot. He smashed in the coordinates for the home base, feeling the quinjet start to turn around to head back to base.
“Hey, hey, hey! Calm down; I’ve got you, Stevie.” Bucky’s arms were around him, holding him through his tremors. Steve sucked in quick breaths, hoping the air would quell the freezing burn in his throat.
Steve’s response was cut off with a moan as Tony ground his hips up to meet Steve’s. “I’d be more than happy to oblige,” Steve gasped. “Just give me a second here. You okay?”
Across the street, a man with curly hair and glasses searches for his keys with one hand, groceries balanced in the other.
Bucky slumped in the wet sand, head dizzy with relief. “We need to move,” Hill continued. “Got word from Fury; Pierce is dead. Once they catch wind of that and this explosion, the rest of HYDRA will be on the move. Up,” she said, prodding at Bucky’s shoulder. “You need to stick to the plan.”
“That’s the thing,” Fury continued. “They didn’t. It seems as if they swooped in, shot you, and then left.”
They are living among us. Average citizens, average heroes. Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.
He’d left him. Left him bleeding in the sand without looking back once. Left him injured and alone while FBI agents hauled him into an unmarked van and brought him south. That last glimpse of Steve, pale and bloody, was the only thing that followed him there. It lingered in his thoughts and haunted his dreams every day and night. He remembered Sarah Rogers whispering in his ear,
Seriously. The best thing about doing a work in progress is that I can take in to consideration any ideas/comments/concerns you guys have. Tell me what you think! What you like, what you think I can do better, anything to make this story the best it can be.
He glanced down at the screen, frowning at the unknown number that blinked up at him. Calling from the capital, as well. He tapped the decline indicator on his screen.
Tony hummed in agreement as he downed the rest of the water, placing the cup of the side table before he got a whiff of his clothes.  “Jesus,” he whispered, taking another smell. “You know, that sewer was rank. Why the hell do you even use it?”
advise you to fill out and file a WS2475 form with our legal department on the second floor. I wouldn’t expect someone to get back to you quickly to resolve the matter. I’d like to help, but there’s nothing I can do.”
As soon as he flicked the television off, he started to sob. For Riley, for his nephew, for believing in any semblance of fairness or justice in the world. Riley’s father would spend the rest of his life in prison, and it still wasn’t enough. It would never be enough.
Steve snorted at Sam’s outburst, Bucky pulling slightly away from Natasha to shoot the man a dirty look. “You want me to kiss you so you don’t feel left out?” Steve chided.
“I wouldn’t say we’re exactly buddy-buddy,” Rhodey replied. “But we do all have the same interests in mind.”
His meeting with Stark was anything but normal. If anything, Stark had managed to get more of a rise out of him. And now that Stark knew what he looked like? Steve was in big trouble. Of course, Steve could just call it in and have Stark dead by dinner time, but that wouldn’t solve anything.
“So if you don’t work with this mysterious government and supreme leader, you’ll get used as an experiment?” His arms moved tighter around Steve’s back, hearing the muttering in his ear again which was reassuring, strangely but still made him worry.
“Impossible. Reed must’ve caused some sort of time skip again, that’s the last time I leave him in the lab after 1AM alone.”
As soon as a blast came their way, Steve held up the holographic shield that seemed to soak up the energy and bounce it back.
“Steve!” Tony cried out as loudly as he could. He shrieked, almost, his heart pounding. This was the first time he could
“Captain Rogers, of the kingdom of Brooklyn!” He said, quick to latch on, after all he had been friends with Tony for over a decade, he knew him well.
Steve wasn’t about to sit there and let someone who he was trying to help literally throw him about. He pushed himself off the wall and grabbed Tony’s arm again.
Rain from the broken ceiling fell on both of them, as if they were in a tragedy on stage, the water dripping down each bump and crack of metal. Steve stooped closer, holding Tony tightly, trying to ease him.
He knew he had to slide over to the colder side of the bed, which was something that he was truly dreading. But it was the only way he could check the time, since Steve had made him disable JARVIS in their room. He did deserve it after he was using the AI to either startle Steve for giggles or record their ‘activities’ for future reference, he claimed.  Unfortunately, Steve didn’t fall for that and demanded that JARVIS had no power in their small room.
The new HQ for the Avengers was spectacular. It was something that the team had spent months building the tower from the remnants of the mansion and adding so much more.building and perfecting by themselves, building their own new home together. It was a tall, beautiful white tower with the signature ‘A’ branding the front of it near the top. It was so large that it felt as though it were piercing the heavens, but boy, was it a sight. Everyone in the city marvelled at how beautiful the structure was, given that it looked far more modern and sleek than your run of the mill office complex.
“And what about you? You’re a super human too, with that serum of yours! You’re basically a giant walking man on steroids!” he barked back.
“No, no no no!” Tony yelled, clutching his jaw sporadically moving from his neck to his lip with his other hand before letting out a yell of frustration, spotting Steve trying to get through and break the handle of the door just behind him. He held up his hand and fired a repulsor, shattering the door in front of him and tumbling out. He was bleeding badly, his jugular had been punctured and he knew that he couldn’t last long. He had ended up on his knees, trying to craw and cry for help, his bots coming to his aid with first aid kits, even Extremis trying to work by covering him with an undersuit to try and heal him in a cocoon. His blood began to change in colour as black colouring danced along the exposed wound, slowly changing it, even changing the texture of the coagulated blood into a thick mess.
“Anaesthetic.” Tony replied before Steve even had the chance to ask the question. “Got a lot more where that came from.”
Of course at first glance it looked like just a regular island, but Tony’s scans revealed much more than that. He slowed to a halt as his boots skimmed the surface of a hillside that was covered in lush greenery, just looking as though it were a normal hill enclosed in the countryside which seemed rather typical for the area. The thrusters dulled to a spark and then finally his feet touched the grass with a light shift. Instantly he turned his head from side to side, taking a couple of more steps forward and then kneeling as his faceplate slid to the top of his helmet before the entire thing slipped back into a compact that fit neatly around his collar. The fresh country breeze skimmed through his dark hair, pushing it back in a gentle wave. He sighed, unable to prevent himself from inhaling how fresh it all was which was considerably different from spending so much time in the city, not that he would trade that lifestyle for anything else in the world. His hands felt around the terrain, through the blades of emerald grass before his gauntlet finally latched onto something. “There’s no escape from Detective Stark.” He muttered to himself, pressing the hidden button and then punching in a security code whilst using his internal decoder. When they called him Inspector Gadget, they weren’t really kidding, his suit could do anything he wanted if he so chose to.
Tony flew through the now opened doors and placed Steve down, quickly getting their footing and running, again there was another hitch in Tony’s running. His back was still in agony but now his leg was acting up again. Steve glanced at him over his shoulder and Tony quickly dismissed the concern, continuing to run alongside the man in the red white and blue armour.
Now geared up to perfection, it was time to get going back to the mansion to get the communication systems up to help locate the others. Their safety was paramount, and they both knew they couldn’t spend more time fiddling around with parts, not when the others were in a compromised situation. Steve nor Tony knew what the Purple Man and Hammer had up their sleeves, needless to say it was going to be big.
The billionaire sat up properly, trying his hardest to get to his feet, his legs dangling from the table which was when he had spotted it. It seemed as though his arm wasn’t the only casualty of the explosion – his left leg was also bright red. It looked just like his boot from one of his suits, but minus the jet propulsion system which he couldn’t spot on the sole of it. Internally he scowled at the fact that the longer he was awake the less human he was becoming, or rather, had already become. But his rage was far from subsiding,
“We don’t have time for that, T’challa.” Tony growled. “Plus he’s fine, look at him! Do you see anything wrong with him?”
Tony’s vision was deteriorating, but he grabbed as much as he could onto the cabinet, heaving himself to his wobbly feet, of course his left leg taking a little longer to regain its balance.
“Hey Cap… I’ve been waiting for you…” he powered up his repulsor blast, which was pointed directly at Steve, the brightness forcing Steve’s eyes to narrow. Instead of getting up, he was forced to roll to the side to avoid the blast that was aimed right toward him.  He was unmasked, eyes a bright purple – just like Taskmaster.
He was so weak that he couldn’t call for help, so dazed, still as though he was being tugged at by a leash. Tony groaned, but not even that would escape his mouth.
“I’m sorry, Doctor Doom!” The head yelled in that high pitch screech of a voice that it had, manically trying to return to the robots that were set up in a line by the back of the huge, dark room only lit by torches and a couple of monitors.
So there he was, walking down the street with his paper in his hand when a car zoomed by, horning loudly at a passer-by that stepped into the road. The angry pedestrian smacked the bonnet of the car; the calamity was starting to cause a row. But the loud bang on the cast-iron car made him jump, the hollow drumming ringing through his ears as he stood, staring at the near-collision with wide eyes.
Together they both ran to the car with JARVIS barking after them, his little wheels popping out from the soles of his metal paws as he scooted along.
Peter tapped his masked chin, “I don’t think you’d be far off with that hypothesis.” He said, crawling up to Carol. “Carol, you hear me? Do you know who I am? How many fingers am I holding up, and yes, thumbs count.” He said as he waved his hands in front of her face. She snarled through the webs, letting out that Amazonian scream that could make any man quake in their boots.
Reed had woken up to the sound of dark laughter, slowly coming to seeing the blurry silhouette form the shape of someone familiar. The last thing he could remember was working away, hearing the alarms go off for a microsecond and then there was nothing – absolute silence. In fact the entire lab went down. There had obviously been an EMP set up somewhere; all of the robots slumped down, all sign of the AI was gone for that moment. There was absolutely no life in the lab, and this was all while Tony was out dropping Steve back home. He panicked for a moment, trying to stretch over to reach the control panel, but as he reached over the power surge sent a powerful blast of electricity through Reed’s limbs and he collapsed where he was, only to wake up, finding himself tied to a chair.
After it was installed there was always a strange glitch now and then, where his fingers would move of their own accord, but strangely enough that was a reassuring feeling.
“That means no communication; again, we’re going to have to go all the way home for this to work. I’m sure I can fix something up when we get there, and use that to get in touch with the others.” He replied, his eyes occasionally drifting down to Steve’s legs to make sure they were still functioning. He didn’t exactly know how reliable HAMMER tech would be.
“At ease…” The man muttered whilst he sat in a huge dark leather chair, arms resting either side, face on to the door with the light shining through the pane from behind him. He had a huge cigar resting between his teeth, making everything he said sound like it was coming out of the side of his mouth that wasn’t chewing on the huge cigar. “Take a seat, Rogers.”
Tony groaned, his body ached, but none of that mattered. All of the pain seemed to fizzle away under the sensual touches.
“Thanks, JARVIS!” Steve replied to it enthusiastically, always awed by how observant the little bot was. Tony was beaming with pride yet again that one of his creations had saved them. Carefully they tiptoed over it, and Steve turned around to pick JARVIS up so that his wheels wouldn’t trigger off the alarm.
“It feels like a big part of me is missing,” Tony replied bluntly, “I feel like I’m part of my suit, to be honest.”
Fury was content with what he was seeing, as sad as it was to keep a national icon like a caged eagle cooped up in this place, he knew it was needed. It would heal him, he convinced himself. With that he backed off from the screens. “Make sure he gets home, safe and everything is kept as it is. Minimal changes and we can start the adaption process once he shows mentality stability and the symptoms of PTSD decline.” He would salvage his mentality if it was the last thing he would do.
properly. Something streamlined so you can wear your old boots, I won’t let you go without the old signature look.  I promise.”
Tony’s boots flickered whilst he was in the air, his air time vastly decreasing just before they shorted out. “Go go Stark fantastic-arms!” He stretched his hands out, trying to reach the bumper of the car but they didn’t extent to a normal length, no it was far beyond that. They extended with mechanical tubing stretching out to allow Tony to grab onto the bumper, just as he wanted. But oh no, it wasn’t
He stood to his feet, head lowered, rim of his hat shading his face, trying to compose himself against Doom who stood there so triumphantly towering over his fallen comrade. His arms were trembling with pain, fingers slowly curling and balling up into fists. Tony closed his eyes for a moment, opening them with a bright blue glow to the iris, power surging throughout his body and all channelling down to his chest, to his beating heart.
He distracted himself by trying to repair some of the bots that Steve had trashed when they’d gone in to perform maintenance checks and procedures (apparently he certainly
Sitting it out was all he could do at present, walking around down the sewers to see if there was anything of use, and then walking back toward Peter, having not gone far from him. He knew if he decided to scout the area then Peter would probably jump at the chance to leap into action alongside the two ladies, and right now, Tony couldn’t afford to lose the one guy that was providing him intelligence; not that he was going to lose
“You will, I’m sure, boyscout. There’s no reason to look like you’re next in line for the electric chair.”
Steve snorted. “Same goes for you. Night, Tony.” They locked eyes for a second and then there was silence while Tony returned a smile just as warm as the stare he was receiving, a stare that could make even his cheeks twinge with a hue of pink.
“Sounds rather possessive.” Steve couldn’t help but smirk. Maybe he enjoyed the banter a little too much.
“After years of not saying it out loud… This was… Fantastic,” Tony had to whisper, his voice hoarse, the physical toll on his body finally becoming prominent, curling closer for more care. The coolness of the reactor was much appreciated, and Tony pressed his face against it, hearing the hum that was as close as he was going to get to an actual heartbeat, masking the internal drumming, just like his own.
Tony’s attention was one again stolen from Zola. His eyes rolled as he expected it to be another creature of Zola’s trying to rattle the cage, but when he performed a quick visual sweep of the room he spotted something that made him jump to his feet right away.
Steve was mesmerized and in awe of the emergency tactics that Tony had just deployed, fixed on him when he was reminded by the loud sirens that he had a job to do, so he didn’t have long to stare and wonder what else Tony had up his sleeve. Quickly he slammed down the acceleration, trying to get the old coughing car to go as fast as it could.
It looked as though a bomb had gone off; there were boxes everywhere and members of the team were scattered around the room. Tony’s eyes instantly darted toward Luke who was carrying a giant tree. And by giant, he meant huge in that the peak of the tree was scraping against his ornate ceiling and scratching some of the detailing that Tony remembered doing himself.
Fury looked just about ready to smack the man in the face. “You’re lucky Stark, you say anythin’ else funny and I’ll smack that goatee right off your face. Capiche?”
Nothing was escaping, but Tony knew why – the Purple Man was getting to him. Killgrave stepped closer, calmly parting the robots as though they were the red sea and grabbed hold of Tony’s head, staring deeply into his eyes.
His hips bucked up one last time, crying out Steve’s name. Simultaneously the sight of Tony climaxing over himself and Steve being able to feel the stickiness between their bodies over his own abdomen made him deliver one last powerful thrust, gritting his teeth and finally releasing in him, slumping on top of the man in sheer exhaustion. Tony fell back into the mattress, then let out an added ‘oof’ when Steve fell on him, nuzzling him with tenderness.
“Zemo, myself and Crossbones – we were all in prison at the time when these things were first made, after your super pals got their own chips. Call us lab rats, but they were tested on us first. We behave, then they don’t flip the switch.”
His attention turned toward the tree that had an Arc Reactor, a smaller model, sat at the top. Peter chuffed with pride when he spotted Tony’s eyes focus on the cyan glowing model. It was definitely the boys handy work.
“No… No…! NO! BUCKY!!!” Steve screamed as he hit the water, the impact shattering pain throughout his body, disbelief and utter guilt running through his mind. He plunges deeper and deeper into the blue, the salty filter stinging his eyes as they remain wide open, seeing nothing but that explosion, hearing the scream of his best friend resound over and over. He’d never felt so much pain in his entire life, and not because he’d crashed into the water and that he was sinking lower and lower into the perpetual abyss, it was because he had seen his friend scream out, reach his hand to him, but he just couldn’t touch his fingertips, he couldn’t move that inch closer to grab his arm. He couldn’t save him.
“How?” he asked, looking from side to side. Looking around was like regarding the world after the first time he’d woken up, a stranger in a strange land. He pushed himself up and quickly glanced around, far too hesitant to leave Tony in the state that he was in.
“All clear,” he said, pulling himself up completely as he was followed by the eager spider that jumped out of the manhole right after Tony. Peter remained crouched on all fours whilst Tony walked toward the bodies of the fallen berserkers, rolling one to its front to check that it was dead, which it clearly was. The searing hole in its chest should’ve been enough reassurance, but it was better to be safe than sorry.
“We’re going toward the robot rampaging the city, we’ll take care of it, you two go and prove your innocence to Fury!”
It was no surprise to see the love bites that Tony had made the previous night had only dwindled into dark marks as opposed to bruises; such was the effect of the super soldier serum. It made him pout, leaning closer and biting harder on the marks on Steve’s skin to try and darken them, even if the effect was temporary, he needed that confirmation that the man now belonged to him in a sense. Even if he was the more submissive one that night, that wouldn’t be known to anyone.
.  As much as Tony wanted to question him and ask him how he did that he could feel the rumble in his stomach intensify. Bypassing the interrogation Tony stepped up beside Steve, and tilted his head, trying to speak but only a mishmash of groans escaping his oesophagus. Steve seemed to understand him though, dipping his already hunched posture down and grabbing something from under the broken ribs of the corpse. With a powerful tug he yanked it out – arteries that were attached to it spilling crimson splatters all over the floor. Carefully Steve cupped what he held in his hands and held it out to Tony, tilting his head in response. The living-dead-engineers eyes fell to what Steve held; a heart, he was offering him the heart of his kill. He didn’t know why he found that sweet, endearing and even romantic. The quick corruption of the virus (fuelled by Steve’s super solider serum and Tony’s which acted as a catalyst, hence the quick infection) had warped Tony’s brain during his brief time being ‘dead’. Tony reached for it, grabbing the still warm organ in his own hands and then sinking his teeth into it. It was juicy, like biting into a fresh strawberry, strewn with flavours that he had never tasted before, possibly the best meal he had ever had. Tony ate the heart with considerable care, with Steve staring at him the entire time. He was said to have had minimal brain function, to give in to hunger, but Tony now knew first hand that there was more of a thought pattern and one other remaining emotion asides from the need to eat and constant hunger and emptiness – love. Tony made a chuffing noise when he had finished, with Steve stepping up to him and growling face to face, but it was a strange growl, a happy growl if that were even possible.
“Seems the Captain is on his way…” Hammer groaned. “And here I was having so much fun with my new toy.”
“Listen Stark, we don’t know much, but if you act up and you got this chip in you, if you try going toward that tower, then you will get killed by an angry mob or go bat-shit crazy,” Masters so eloquently explained.
“I was there, Peter. He was right next to the bomb.” Tony’s voice raised an octave, his heart raced as he talked about the super soldier.
It was Tony’s turn to collect the samples that the others needed. He looked behind him at the empty lab and sighed, realising that they had been taking turns to observe Steve. It turned out that staring at a man that was lying still meant time passed far slower in comparison to when Steve was awake. It was a regular procedure, he would just go in and take some of his blood and check him out.
“Geez Louise! I’m sorry ma’am!” Steve exclaimed, reaching over to try and meekly dust a little of the foam off the black cat.
Tony jumped into the passenger’s seat, clipping his antenna on the roof of the car causing it to bend a little, but he didn’t seem to realise nor react to it. “What’re you waiting for? Let’s go!”
“Tony..?” He whispered, skimming his metal fingertips over the man’s face. From the corner of his eyes, he caught the reactor with no light, and then he focused on the man himself. He couldn’t even breathe. He just stared at him. “Tony…” He whispered over and over, searching for a reply. His lips were moving but not a sound escaped them, mouthing Tony’s name and shaking his head as uncontrollably tears fell from his eyes, mixed with each drop of rain from above.
“How…?! How are you two standing!? No one can withstand this, no one!” Killgrave tried to use his powers just as he had done before, but it wasn’t effective in the slightest.
Steve smiles to Tony’s retort but feels the wall he’s chained to start to vibrate. “Tony..!” He let out a cry of warning.
That was the best apology he was going to get. Steve could tell that Tony wanted more, but instead patted his back to signal that if he pushed Fury further he’d probably get a knock in the teeth judging by the chief’s temperament.
Tony clutched his jaw and spun around with a powerful acrobatic kick to get his distance, something that Steve had taught him. Once Tony had regained his footing, he held his repulsors up, shooting the swarm of bots that came at him.
The brush of their lips was electrifying; it sent shudders down Tony’s spine, and Steve felt just the same. He needed more, they both needed more.
Tony nodded eagerly and positioned himself, raising his hips over Steve’s lap, gripping his firm muscular thighs for support, trying to prevent his sweaty palm from sliding across the metal.
“That’s a movie reference.” Steve snapped his fingers excitably, eyes lit up as he actually smiled and flashed his deep set dimples.
Rubble trembled as the footsteps of the many began to near, but then it kicked in as an instantaneous trigger.
“Oh-ho! You came close to catching me, mon ami, but it appears I have outsmarted you, as I will do the rest of your fellows!” He chuckled. “You will remember my name, Batroc, the leaper, the pride of Paris!”
Tony shook his head. “He’s been there for me all this time, he’s been carrying my weight on his shoulders for so long. I went to go and see him just before I came down here, actually. It helped clear my mind just a little. I don’t know where I’d be without him… He’s helping up top, keeping things in order. You know he’s better at organising the troops than I am. I think it’s an armed forces sort of gist, they’re so used to that, the others.”
“See that doesn’t make much sense to me. Why would it be global unless there were numerous culprits?”
“You may be a hero because of your unwavering drive and potential, but your faith in humanity is lacking.”
He held the pillow close, and there was silence minus their soft breathing, the occasional creek of the springs when either of them turned, particularly Tony with the weight of the armour. They both needed food and water, but that could be settled later, knowing Peter and how he was surviving – he probably knew somewhere to get the supplies.
“I’ll kill if I have to.” The figure replied from the other side, though his voice was distorted with the barrier of the mirror in the way.
The mud was mucky, thick and heavy, with rocks buried into it that joined the pile they made, damp with the rain that must’ve recently fallen. “You do this for everyone?” Tony asked.
“You get closer, and he’s losing more memories. You know, I can see them all here – on this screen.” Norman pointed. “Let’s get this one up, hmm, what is it now…? The moment he first had woken up and saw you.”
“Like I said, Stark, we’ll make a deal. Ya do what you need to do and we won’t be usin’ you for the next mask of our gang,” Taskmaster said from behind his mask. “Cap over there ain’t in good shape, you ain’t goin’ to risk it so just do what we tell you to and we’ll give you your info.”
Steve could barely see now the lasers were gone, everything was dark aside from the faint blue light that seemed to be emanating from under Tony’s shirt. His hand clasped around Tony’s shoulder. The young detective smiled back at Tony before flicking his cap, just when he did that a light blue bulb lit up in the centre of it.
“Together.” The alternate reality Tony said, grabbing Steve’s hand and tip toeing just a bit to peck his cheek. “Come on, beloved, we have other dimensions to save. Let these two rest together.”
time.” An extremely unenthusiastic Clint rolled his eyes…then turning his head back to the left. Concern touched his voice. “That smells
“Get out of here.” He snarled, “How dare you imitate Steve, how dare you..!” He yelled with a shaky tone of voice, his nose crinkling as he snarled.
He pushed his barely clothed hips against Steve’s, rubbing over the fabric, trying to figure out in his mind how this would work.
Tony cleared his throat. Steve couldn’t help but smirk when he saw a huge arrow pop up from Tony’s hat, pointing down to him in a flashing neon red.
His eyes filled with panic as he felt the force of gravity weigh on his suit, descending from the sky as though he were Icarus. Steve was his sun, clearly, and just having made contact with him sent a warmth through his body that couldn’t be expressed through words.
Steve swerved around the corner, the heavy back of the car drifting along the road before they reached the park. He leaped out of the car, with Tony taking the lead.
“He did stop breathing when I was there, I mean, I think he did but that’s impossible.” Tony said, trying not to give too much away.
At that moment he didn’t think of holding back, if this was a dream he’d go for it. Steve always was so perfect, and now his mind was creating this illusion that he was an angel. How stupid. But he thought to embrace it while he could, slowly letting his hands move from Steve’s wings to the back of his head, stroking the spikey tufts of hair. Internally he questioned himself, how could this man make him believe in angels in such a short period of time? Probably because he was one. Because all this time he’d done nothing but try and save him and look out for him when no one else did. It was then he realised how better his life had become once this ‘angel’ had fallen in front of him, always answering his calls. Even that very night, Tony was suffering from nightmares and in he walked, accompanied with a golden shine around him like some sort of God. There was a reason that Tony was deeply in love with Steve, and it wasn’t just because of his Greek-God-like looks. It was because he had a heart of pure gold. And there he was hurting him, disbelieving him, making his beautiful wings fade away. No. He couldn’t let that happen. He couldn’t lose this, not when they’d come so far together.
“I will; you see, it’s my hard work that’s managed to shut this entire lab down. All I have to do is get those schematics and then I will be capable of building my own bots with double the functionality of that tin man’s. I’ll use it to shut down this city, then the world. The entire world shall turn to Latveria as their saviour!”
Luckily, he’d managed to save one of his prized possessions, and he stooped down to pick up an old Captain America comic book, one of the first he’d ever gotten, one of the only things that Howard had ever allowed him to keep without saying it was too childish.
“The Tony I knew wouldn’t walk around with that sort of hobolicious hairdo. Now, tell me you li’l terminator, who are you? Don’t make me angry...”
Steve stared at the holograms, eyes following their every move as Tony began to flick through and bring up projections with ease, into buildings, people that moved, people that talked. He had never seen anything like it in his entire life and he didn’t know whether to be afraid of it or whether to accept what he was being told. Everything seemed so factual, so real and solid. Information being thrown at him and being forced to accept it was an extremely bewildering feeling. But the man next to him seemed so thrilled to be preaching about development and how things have changed, even introducing his company to him. Steve was familiar with the company; in fact it should’ve clicked sooner – Stark.
There was a look of worry that painted Tony’s face that moment as he bit his lower lip. The treacherous thought compelled him to drum his foot on the metal floor; his expensive shoes with hardened soles made a clip-clop whenever he did.
“What do you think I do, Tony Stark? I am a genius, I am a man that invents superior beings and pushes them to achieve their full potential. Steve Rogers was one of those men that had become the pinnacle of the human race, but none of you truly utilized him – why not make him better? He has much potential, and under my control he would have been the greatest asset.”
to be the host of this thing, where is he? Some host… Sorry guys, just make yourself at home, I’ll go and find him.” She zoomed off, searching the main living quarters. “Tony..!”
It was Tony’s turn to tackle the bars. He stepped up to them and powered up the beam in his chest again but made a whimper of hesitation when he remembered how terrible the force of recoil was and how far it sent him back in the building. Although he couldn’t feel the pain to its full extent, he didn’t like how it had shaken him. Tony’s brain still had memories, it still had certain thoughts and had the feeling of hesitation that Steve had seemingly lost and thus restraint held him back.
“Reports suggest that the masterminds behind it are none other than Tony Stark, the famous robotics engineer turned detective, and Victor Von Doom – reported dead by the NYPD, but after careful research we’ve determined this was incorrect. Stark’s motives are unknown, but his ties with Victor Von Doom suggest that this has a financial motive behind it.
Tony winced, crying out as he tried over and over to fight whatever this was invading his mind. It felt like before, like that dark power slowly dragging him into the abyss again, he had to fight it, he needed to.
“We can’t risk pulling over, Steve, what if she arrests us? We’ve got to go and get Reed! Y’know the guy has a family, he’s got kids—His wife is going to kill me when she finds out…”
“Tell me while I’m working, what is this radar?” he asked, wondering if Masters knew more specifics. “You worked for Osborn didn’t you? Once upon a time.”
“Wait!” Steve called out, trying to listen close. He was sure he could hear them using their loudspeakers, but it wasn’t a usual call to pull over.
Tony placed the mug down and fell into his seat, placing his hand over his red bloodshot eyes. “I just want Steve out of here…”
Visions of the Captain appeared, fighting him, hiding from him, running from him – everything was unclear, a blur where all he could see was Steve…
“Tony Stark, detective extraordinaire, master of technology. I’m sure you’ve heard of me.” Tony shook Steve’s hand too. The first thing that Steve noticed, however, was how cold Tony’s touch was. It sent a shiver running through his spine, and just as he pulled back the tips of their fingers met and there was a small spark, causing Steve to sharply withdraw his hand and shake it in the air a few times.
He may have been this attached to it because he was deemed as evil so many times by his fellow agents, that his actions were dark and violent. Being called a merchant of death over and over and then after being kidnapped he had turned a new leaf, but even then there were actions that others disagreed with. He pushed forward a legislation that caused a massive conflict and thus caused the death of friends, he had consented to things with his group, the Illuminati, that he may not have condemned if he had to stay on the moral high ground and think with his brain and not his heart. Maybe if he could fix this it could be symbolic that he could be fixed, that all of his wrongdoings could be repaired. But then again, perhaps he was looking too into this all and being over analytical. But he still had hope.
“No, tell me what the hell is going on!?” he shouted, only to be muffled by a red gloved hand that was firmly placed over the mouth slit.
“I will return him to one of the safe houses for a thorough medical analysis.” Vision replied with the calm, cool, and collected manner that always surrounded him.
Jessica had managed to get to her feet, hunched and in agony, but soldiering on as she launched her strongest series of kicks toward the two figures that loomed over them. Tony knew he couldn’t leave Peter by himself when there was practically an army of these things on the other side of thin netting.  “Jessica-“
“Tell me what you did! You tell me right now!” He screamed. He was no geneticist, but if he could find some way to reverse it – but there was no way he could bring the dead back to life.
“He does not care for you like I do. I can make you a better man, he cannot. I can make you complete, Tony.”
Once more he had to shut his eyes just for a while as his suit picked up more and more speed, aiming toward the jet that was flying away and out of his grasp. He had to open his eyes, even if this would hurt him. Slowly his eyelids fluttered open, immediately filling with tears at the speed he was going. He reached out an arm as the wing of the jet came close, gritting his teeth and pushing with all of his might.
“The longer you keep him there, the longer it’ll take for him to get a footing in the real world. There’s no better way for him to adjust then to throw him in the deep end, but he sure as hell won’t be alone in it. Fury thought for some absurd reason that we weren’t ready for him, that he wouldn’t survive in this world. Oh ye of little faith. This is Captain America, not just any regular guy!”
calmly, toward Killgrave, and with all of the emotion and power they had left in them, Steve drew his left arm back whilst Tony drew his right, mirroring each other before throwing that final punch, and knocking The Purple Man unconscious for the time being. That would give them long enough to tie him up and hand him over to SHIELD.
Finally, after the mirror had shown him many possibilities but none meshed with what Tony had in mind, Tony sighed resignedly. There was no Steve out there that paralleled his ethics, but there was one that came close, and he from a dimension that the mirror knew very little about. This Steve was a tall, handsome unmodified version of Steve, but after closely scrutinising his personality traits, Tony saw that he held far greater potential. Steve had strength and determination, and according to the files, he would become much more in the future; he would be an agent of Ultron’s, self-proclaimed ‘
“Look, I’ll pay them back, you know I will. Your foot is taking way too much damage there. I don’t think that those legs are equipped to take on the pavement and your weight, not saying that you should lose a few pounds there Cap, but you know…” He tried to joke, giving Steve a coaxing nudge. “So let’s get you some shoes.”
“I’m so confused right now… So the government provided these augmentations? Why help people who aren’t submitting?”
Steve punched the wall again and shook his head, drawing back and looking at his knuckles that weren’t even close to bruising. There were absolutely no signs of it at all, his skin remained fully in tact with not even a scratch.
And then he snapped out of it and pushed back, raising his shield and hitting one of the armours hands back, skittering back a little before jumping to his feet and leaping up as high as he could, throwing all of his weight into a powerful dropkick to the helmet of the suit that fell to the ground with a heavy thud.
He made his decent, taking each step in its own stride, slowly, cautiously, head snapping toward any sound that was made including that of his own footstep.  The lights flickered and lit just enough for him to see where the next step was, before the bar of light next to it would shine, alternating, clearly motion sensitive activation.
Tony was trying to recover as much as he could, running from the courtyard to that special room, grabbing everything he’d held from his childhood and transferring it outside including a vintage Captain America shield and ensuring that it was safe for Steve to use to replace his damaged one. Tony Stark was by no means a sentimental man, but when it came to that room in particular, it just contradicted his nature entirely.  Some of the items in that room had been in his collection since he was years old, and there was no way he was letting them go now. He’d also managed to find a few parts to use later. Like he said, he’d upgrade their bionics (he was still resentful that he was using something of Hammer’s).
“DNA traces sir; that and the front camera caught sight of someone resembling his stature, but covered in a metal armour. Iris scans suggest it was indeed Victor Von Doom.”
Tony cleared his throat to regain his leader-like posture and composure. “We’re heading to Hammer’s main building, that’s probably where they’ll be. It’s not far from here. If he’s got a similar set-up to the factory we first fought him out he’ll be there with a boat load of drones. So we’ll need all the power we can get.”
Tony rested his head back just a bit, rolling it back a bit, just to stop the ache somehow. “There are a lot of things that people don’t have me down for. All they seem to see is what the media portrays me as, a genius and womaniser. And yet, my last girlfriend was one that I’d actually moved in with. Her name was Maya…”
“Just making sure…” Tony replied in a dizzy haze. “I need this.” An unintentional whisper escaped that caught Steve’s attention, making him dip and press a line of butterfly kisses down Tony’s neck, slipping down his body, then to his chest.
“Someone forgot to check out, or… Checked out too soon,” he said, staring at the skeleton in the bed, its clothed arm draping off the side of the bed as rats surged from its ribcage, squeaking as they made their way out in a miniature pack.
Tony decided to distance himself just a fraction, though there was only so much he could pull away considering he didn’t want to break the hand-hold he had going with Steve while they were walking to meet the others. “Maybe.”
The repulsors shot a burning ray which Tony managed to sidestep. His eyes widened and he tried to make his way toward him without being shot in the process.
Tony’s eyes focused on his friend, feeling his heart sink when he nodded in consent. “We’ll inject him this afternoon.” He met both of their eyes, one after the other. “You both make certain the sedative is completely ready and inserted into one of the bots I’m going to send in. I’ve had to make them more…
Steve recognised the man that stood before him. It was Howard Stark, Tony’s father, engineer extraordinaire.
“You have no idea what you’re god damn saying, you’ve gone nuts!” Tony barked in denial. “Besides…” His tone lowered to a more sombre choice. “I’m not going to let that happen, I’ll fix you, remember I promised?”
He managed to talk after he’d recovered from the hard pat and caught the breath back that was knocked out of him. “Transferred from Brooklyn ma’am. But this feels like I’m straight out of the academy, if I’m honest.”  Steve had worked in the NYPD back in Brooklyn but that was nothing compared to working in the main city, in the heart of the USA.  There was far more pressure, which he was ready to carry on his shoulders.
. Then, as Tony’s attention began to dwindle to his own expectations and linger on how much he had failed within that period, he heard a loud thump which snapped him out of those thoughts in an instant. Steve had collapsed face down, motionless with his eyes closed. It had been the first time in days that Tony had actually seen him with his eyes closed...and completely insensate. There was a feeling of relief that washed over him; seeing Steve relaxed was an accomplishment all in its own. Yes, it was minor, but still a small step towards finding the cure towards whatever hell Zola had inflicted on him.
Peter nodded, though he didn’t know much about the other woman. But if she managed to put the heebie jeebies into Tony Stark then it really was someone to worry about. But right now he was supposed to be angry at Tony, not sympathising with him. He huffed afterward to show his mood but something in the back of his mind was telling him that Tony was here for a mission, and he was just doing what needed to be done. Although they’d lost someone because of his mistake, pinning the blame wouldn’t do much good. He just decided to keep quiet and kept his head facing forward and walked along the dusty roads that obviously weren’t used too often, in fact this part of the city in comparison to where they just were was significantly different; broken buildings, rubble, bricks just lying there. But there were noticeably more trees whereas the other part seemed more like a concrete jungle.
The metal suit sizzled and cracked off. That was one arm taken care of, but Hammer was a man of many tricks and began shooting lasers at the two, flailing his hand around with a faulty sense of accuracy. It made it harder to predict a man who clearly had no idea what he was doing, and Tony hid behind Steve’s shield, waiting for his repulsor to recharge and giving the Captain the nod to surge forward, throwing his entire weight into a brutal drop-kick.
“What? How did we get here…? Last I remember was the explosion, what’s going on?!” He yelled with panic, looking at his body and then at Tony’s.
“Yes, I know that, Tony.” He rolled his eyes at being underestimated by his friend, his hands reached over for the food that was in Tony’s arms and he gathered it up. “I’ll purify this; make sure that it’s clean.” Reed said, gesturing for Tony to have a look at Steve’s state.
The darkness began to reappear from the shadows that were in the room, and as much as he tried to struggle this time, it managed to engulf Steve once more.
“What?” Tony’s eyes shot open wide and he ran toward the monitors to watch how the blood was reacting on the screen, having put nano-cameras the size of cells into the blood that they were transfusing.
“Right away sir,” the dog replied, barking and then running over to the elevator. Steve’s brows furrowed right away, wondering how on Earth they were going to get a car down into the basement, but lo and behold, moments after querying it in his head, the ceiling above began to open, slots and panels moving out of joint with loud clunks of metal scraping against one another filling the room with noise. Slowly on a platform the smoking heap of a police car began to descend through the hole in the ceiling before the panels slid back into the places they were before and returned to a regular looking ceiling, well, somewhat regular with all the rivets now far more noticeable by Steve’s eyes.
“Ah, you brought a friend from the department back? Pleasure to meet you, Officer, I’m Doctor Richards, Reed Richards. I work alongside the police in their research and development team.” His arm extended again to offer his hand to Steve, even though he was standing a fair distance away. Steve couldn’t help but blink once at it, trying to tilt his head to find a screw or panel like Tony had in his arms, but he couldn’t see a thing.
Tony smiled, starting his propulsion system in his boots and soaring up with the much heavier armoured man in his grip. Steve kept on the look out for the numbers that were painted along the inside of the walls. He tilted his body a bit toward the walls, just so that he could use the light from his own reactor to make things a little more visible.
“Hey, have some faith. It’ll work, trust me on this.” He placed the radio back into her hands safely. “If anything happens just press that button.”
Bullets were being sprayed left and right, the heavy sound of the Gatling guns being reeled out and having their handles cranked as bullets were being fed to them, then the clank of the shells to the floor was heard like a song – load, fire, clank, a repeating rhythm.  Hydra agents were scouring the base, but Captain America was far from the front lines at that point, not while the Commandos covered down below.
Tony’s mouth opened wide, letting out a yelp at the feeling but then what came next surprised him. Steve’s movements were short and jerky, quick though, as the fingers began to pulse inside him. Steve had managed to get the fingers to vibrate. The flush extended from Tony’s face down his entire torso, his body filling with jolts of pleasure.
He sighed deeply at the loss of his friend, trying to not let it wain on his conscience too much, and began navigating the same way through the rubble as he had entered the first time. Though it did occur to him that jumping through the broken window that he was dragged through earlier was probably a shortcut. Either way, he didn’t want to risk hurting Steve on shards of glass in the process.
“It can’t be him. Tony died in that explosion,” Jessica whispered to Carol after she tried to shield her words by using her hand.
Beams of sunshine broke past the tall canopy of buildings; light broke through the shadow as though it were a sign of what was to come. In the distance Tony could clearly see the tall structure that he was heading toward, looming over the city, casting its shadow.
Steve didn’t talk very much. What he would do was pace the containment chamber that he was in, his head slightly tilted to a side with jolty movements. He would jump on the meat as he had done before. There were wounds around his knuckles from where he was constantly either punching the wall, broken mirror which they had decided to not replace, and the visual screen. Those wounds seeped with black, the skin pulling back over the bones to reveal the sharp edges of the knuckle bones protruding from his broken flesh. From a dry scratching tone of voice that he once spoke with, it had further broken down to dry growls instead. He wouldn’t even form words any longer, he would just stand in silence which was far more eerie than the dark words that had escaped. The speed of the virus was quickening.
Steve’s wings ached for a moment as he felt something change, his heart sinking was causing his wings to react accordingly.
“What happened?” he asked in a whisper, unsure if he should ask that question in the position that he was in. But a pure interrogation wasn’t his style, he had to get answers for himself, especially since this was taking far too much of his time up.
Killgrave’s finger tapped the bottom of his chin as he eyed Iron Man, laying there still, a pained expression painted over his face. It was extremely satisfying to see Tony suffering again, but this would definitely be his own comeuppance considering how the last time he had planned something to this magnitude it was messed up by Captain America himself. It was about time the mighty Captain paid for what he had done. His plan was going so perfectly until Steve had come along, and now it was his chance to continue where he had left off; for Tony to feel what it was like to destroy his team mate. It was all part of a larger plan he had in mind.
Tony always had a thing for medieval history, ever since he had visited Camelot – no, even further back, he’d loved knights, loved the mythology of kings. You could even say that the Iron Man armour was based off a knight in shining armour, the one that Tony had always aspired to be.
“We will find out,” T’challa contributed, stroking his chin with his sharp claw that was on the end of his glove.
“Tony just wait!” Reed said, ensuring the food was clean before placing it in the small pigeonhole that they dispensed the food in. The tray slid down the chute and slid in front of Steve who turned around right away, practically jumping on the food and scoffing it down as quickly as he could. He took large bites, barely taking any time to chew before swallowing, ravenous hunger consuming him and making him eat like a wild animal. He picked through the wrappers, shoving them to one side while he chewed the meat and swallowed with heavy gulps, eyes turning up to the glass that was returned to its regular transparent setting.
Gradually, Steve pushed himself to his feet. “What’s the matter with you, Masters? You’ve not been as chatty as you usually are… No taunts? No ‘aim of Hawkeye’ or ‘just like Cap, but better’ quips?”
He hadn’t heard that thick of an Australian accent since his time at war, and even so, it was a rare occurrence. The guy stood in purple and blue, with boomerangs in either hand, leering at Steve as he approached.
“So thank you Tony, you are officially one of the departments… Prized inspectors.” Every word that escaped Fury’s mouth held a grudge to it, but at least he was being honest. “You’ve earned your place in the precinct, and your title, inspector. Along with your partner. I suppose tin-men are okay…”
He took that as his cue to commence running. With fewer obstacles, he managed to leap from rooftop to rooftop. Steve kept up with his tremendous momentum as he jumped between gaps with precise accuracy, landing just on the edge of each rooftop before pushing against the gusts of wind that came his way and jumping to the next spot. Each leap and each bound brought him closer to
With that, Steve pulled himself up with Tony’s help. It was clear Tony struggled with the weight but the amount of times they had trained together meant that Tony was used to carrying him. It just helped to be wearing a suit sometimes.
“Just hold on a second, y’mind giving me the skinny? Listen buddy, detective, all I’ve heard about you is that you’re a special detective but all this? Rocket boots, gizmos coming out of your leg? Glowing hands? I need to know what the heck is going on!”
Another mission another day – returning home from Madripoor after a tedious mission involving the likes of Taskmaster meant that things had become far more complicated than first anticipated. Nonetheless, the enemy was taken down, Taskmaster was behind bars again, and Steve and Tony were making their way back alongside Rhodey who was accompanying them. The Director was wearing the suit that he’d been working on. The refurbishment was rather impressive, and the once scary looking suit that was hanging on the hooks in the lab was now being worn and used and packed a hell of a punch.  It was clear that Tony really did mean it when he said he was fixing it, and yet he used a different helmet, most probably a newer model. It certainly wasn’t his area of expertise, so he couldn’t really judge, just so long as he did his job and the suit protected him. He’d been using it ever since that incident in his lab.
He squinted a little blaming it on his tired hazy vision but as he crept closer he noticed that he wasn’t breathing at all. Slowly but surely he placed his hand just under Steve’s nose only for Steve to open his eyes and bat at Tony’s hand.
Clint definitely heard that and directed his full attention toward Steve. “Hey, newbie, I wouldn’t be getting cocky. Even though Carol’s gone ahead and told you my entire life story. But yeah, new guy… Wait, wait, you’re THE new guy, aren’t you? The one that’s gonna be the detective’s new partner?”
His heart paced as he tried to creep closer and closer without seeming too obvious, but it was difficult when Steve kept flinching like that, jerking with movement. Tony understood his pain but he needed to stop it completely. With a rapid movement he pulled the exposed part of Steve’s neck, apologising profusely as he crushed the metallic plate that he could find. Steve’s eyes shot open with pain, his pupils dilating before he fell forward, whispering his friends’ names; Sharon, Sam, Bucky… Tony.
Tony combed his fingertips through his long grown hair as he watched everyone gawk at the screens. He shook his head and continued onward trying to comprehend what exactly he’d seen. Technology wasn’t meant to be cosmetic, and he’d spent a long part of his life trying to distinguish himself from machines. Uploading his consciousness was the first mistake, when his armour had turned sentient and the last resort was Extremis. After that he could communicate with technology, he had become one with his machine, he was Iron Man – even after the countless times that he said he wasn’t.
Tony glanced back up, still hurt. “I know Steve, I’m trying to make this process as quick as I can… McCoy is coming in and he should be able to help more than I can.” He muttered. “I want to get you out of here Steve, do you think I enjoy seeing you cooped up like this?” Tony’s eyebrows slanted and he pressed his palm against the glass, resisting the urge to punch it.
Yet he just remembered Steve’s words before he thought of acting on those dark thoughts. It should never be an option…only those words would prevent Tony from taking that plunge.
Without thinking twice Steve stared at his watch, pressing the tiny button to the side of it, and then before he knew it his watch lit up. Defensively he drew his arm back, watching as a holographic shield appeared over his wrist, his eyes lit up with awe. The shield looked magnificent; red and white circles with a blue circle and white star in the center, talk about
Civilians began to leave their homes and resume their natural state, although to their horror there were some portions of the city that had been destroyed overnight by the on-going conflict between superheroes and berserkers. Luckily they were in the safety of the high walls again.
“Let the boys play, we have more important things to do.” Maria summoned them as she effortlessly strode forward ahead of them, past the junction in the hallway. Just round the left hand side Steve and Tony were on the floor.
Steve was still trying to get over the bruises, yet alone another serum being developed from his own. Probably a more advanced one by assumption, but so long as it was in the right hands, being used for good, he couldn’t lecture Tony… For now.
“Well… This is a rebuild; the old place was destroyed, so they’ve not moved in yet. You and I are the first, the others will come eventually.”
“Don’t blame me!” Tony stood up from his chair, stepping around his table and as close as he could to the glass. “I’m trying to help!”
The injection contained some cocktail of chemicals that had been directly injected into Steve’s blood stream and had stopped his organs from functioning and thus had managed to stop the serum from being pumped through his veins causing an instantaneous death. Zola must have harvested enough data on the serum back in Dimension  Z to learn more about the serum, so much so that he had learned how to stop it from flowing, he had learned with that concoction to disable it.
in here,” Tony corrected, as he crouched down and gently scooped up some bits of rubble. Bits of rubble, that seemed to have a mind of their own as they started wiggling in Tony’s arms.
Coulson’s plea had tormented him the whole way home and followed him into bed with Steve. It wasn’t hard for him to see that history was repeating itself – a huge secret that would make or break the two of them.
“What more do you want me to do?” Steve asked loudly. “My question of the week can’t exactly be hey, are any of you murderers?” A woman bustled past him, but didn’t give him a second glance after his outburst.
Working alone was like the good old days. Clint could move fast, taking down the rest of the operation silently. There was no one to worry about, except for himself. But at that point, dying on his vigilante mission didn’t seem to be a major concern for Clint.
“Like you didn’t have any comments to make,” Tony pouted, slapping at Steve’s bicep before turning to look back at Bucky. “I have no idea what the FBI was thinking, giving you this identity, but what a present it was. Jury’s still out on if we think of you more as a 15
Steve beamed as the woman took the picture, only hoping that Tony didn’t decide on any rude gestures. “Thank you so much,” he said as the woman handed Steve his phone back.
Natasha sighed. “Well, we’re getting nowhere. We should get back in there; see if we can pry anything else out of him.”
Right on schedule, the front door was kicked in, and SHIELD agents flooded his living room. It wasn’t that hard to subdue him, he was not as young as he used to be.
“And last night,” Bucky added, “you were so beautiful, baby. Not because we lasted longer – you really don’t realize that we’re the ones that have trouble keeping up with you?” he laughed, pressing a kiss to Tony’s neck. “You could say anything, and that voice about brings me to my knees every time. You laugh into your kisses, and its euphoria for me. And your smile? God only knows how much time I’ve lost thinking about you laying in bed, smiling back up at me.”
“No, no,” Steve sighed, rubbing a hand against his aching temple. “We shouldn’t put this off. We’ll do the big ones tonight, and finish the rest off by the end of the week. Once they’re all accounted for, I’ll see if it’s worth moving some around to be safe.”
Clint frowned at him, obviously not pleased with the answer but dutifully stood, reaching down for Tony to clasp his hand in his. “What a shit show,” he said, yanking Tony to his feet. “Fine. Let’s go be the good guys.”
“Alright, alright. Jesus, you made your point.” An awkward silence fell over the two, the pair pointedly staring at the photo, avoiding eye contact.
Tony nearly shouted. “Steve, Clint has been gone for over a month! How did no one know about this?!”
“What are you trying to do here, Barnes,” snapped Tony. “Is this the part where you play my shrink? Because I didn’t sign up for this either.”
The Captain furrowed his brows, staring long at Tony before nodding his head. “Yeah, yeah we do. Nat caught wind of some weapons just sitting around in a holding facility. It’s time we went shopping. And no,” The Captain added, taking in Tony’s face. “They’re not yours. We’re not that stupid. The guns are Hammer's.”
“No,” Bucky snapped. “You cut that shit right or you can leave. Stark wouldn’t do that. He wouldn’t do that to Steve.”
It had taken months to set the whole thing up. What with Tony redesigning each of his extra floors for each member of the team, putting in gyms, extra labs, anything he thought they might need. And that was on top of the other SHIELD consultations he had. And on top of his load here at Stark Industries.
Steve gave Bruce a warm smile, one that was happily returned. Despite their first meeting, Bruce had proven himself more than enough ways to be in the crew. He was quirky, an odd duck, but wove perfectly in with the patchwork of The Commandos.
“Nah,” Clint said, grabbing a banana from the fruit bowl, hopping onto the kitchen island, his feet swinging. “These were from the ‘90’s.
“I’m just telling you what I’ve heard. There are whispers going around that they’re not all gone and that they’re hiding out in the city.”
Tony nodded, leaning down slightly. Steve tilted up immediately, not even hesitating to connect them together when a huge crash sounded, the window behind them shattering.
Not this time," Stane interjected. "You've cost us both Stark and Rogers. You can't be allowed to continue."
Pierce snorted. “Stane convinced me to wait. Probably just an excuse to hold us off until he could take care of them on his own. Well, screw him; I run this show. I’ll take a few of my boys down there, wait till it’s night and torch the joint. You in?”
“I think he’s finally good to go,” said Bruce, pulling Steve out of his head. “Of course, God forbid we get an actual doctor that can give you actual answers.”
Steve hissed, smacking his shoulder sharply. When he turned back, the woman was already gone. He could practically hear her fuming a few aisles over.
Tony could see how Steve’s eyes were dimmer, his steps heavier as he tromped through the house. He deserved so much better than this. He deserved so much more. But no matter how many times Tony would say, Steve would never forgive himself for what he thought he started.
Tony fell to the floor, Steve's head snapping around in alarm at the sound. He heard Tony scramble to stand up, but he couldn't tear his eyes away from what had flown in through the window.
Clint had been everywhere. He hopped for vantage point to vantage point, trying to keep his team safe. Or, as Tony like to put it, checking to make sure all of his baby chicks were accounted for.
“There are a lot of things you’ve been kept in the dark about,” Bucky replied. “And we’ll get to that. But first, we need your help.”
Clint’s heart rate skyrocketed, the man dropping the phone from his ear. He pushed away from Bucky, trying to get to Phil.
“Tony!” The man reared back towards him with a growl, and Steve caught a faint glimpse of the reason why Tony Stark was known as ruthless in the boardroom, before his face softened, Hyde returning to skulk behind the cowl of Jekyll.
“What the hell, J,” hissed Tony who at first tried to slide his feet against the floor to hinder Steve’s progress, but being a super soldier has its perks.
As for where they were staying, Clint couldn’t tell anymore. They had stayed at Thor’s for a while, but Steve’s paranoia kicked in; the mother hen trying to protect the chicks he had left. From there, they’d been moved to wherever they could find: old warehouses, abandoned houses, anything to keep them hidden for a few days. Then something would tip Steve off again and process would repeat.
Tony reached forward, grabbing on to Barnes and the suitcase, throwing the three of them down the steps. Collapsing onto the hard ground, Tony moaned in agony, back arching as his vision whited out. At the top of the stairs, the ceiling had completely caved in. Large slabs of the destroyed building now blocked the entrance. While it solved the problem of burning to death, it posed the new threat of trapping them down there if the other end had already collapsed as well.
Steve rubbed at his eyes. Part of him just wanted to cancel the podcast entirely. Whomever this criminal is, he shouldn’t have the luxury of listening to him each week. But he couldn’t find himself to do it. The podcast was all he had, really. It’s all they all had.
Clint sat in a diner picking at his eggs. He had stopped by a safe house earlier in order to restock in funds. When he got there, Clint froze.
Steve looked up, meeting the gaze of an equally disheveled James Rhodes. In fact, he looked worse, Steve noticed, just by looking at the state of his clothes. Of course, while the last three months had been pure hell, the last few days for the Colonel had been a nightmare. Apparently, the military didn’t take too kindly for taking such an extended leave. Rhodes had been on the phone constantly, begging his commanding officers for just a little more time.
“Look at this,” Loki continued, sneering at Thor. “Defending the enemy. If only father could see you now.”
Bucky shrugged. “I think we’ve still got some pasta in the cupboards. Besides, Nat’s coming over tonight, and if I pout long enough, she’ll buy us Chinese.”
But it was gone as quickly as it appeared, replaced again by that invisible weight that tugged at Steve’s face, leaving a furrowed brow and a deep frown. Tony’s fingers twitched, wanting to rub away at those lines until they disappeared. Steve finally pulled Tony’s hand away, keeping it palm down, his thumb moving to gently rub over a thick scar at the base of his wrist.
Steve nodded in agreement. “Consider our knowledge on the files pro bono,” he said. “Because it doesn’t matter what’s on there. Names, locations, dates, it doesn’t matter. All that does matter is that they’re all at Pierce’s disposal. The SSR collected whispers and scraps since World War II, all hand written and organized into a massive filing system. And I mean a massive system; like several buildings worth of it. With this power at his fingertips, HYDRA would be unstoppable.”
Steve deflated, his hand dropping from the door handle. “You and me both, Buck,” he sighed. “But will not saying anything be any better? I mean, if we’d never told Tony we loved him, would we even be here? He didn’t say anything then, and he probably won’t say anything now. It might not be in our best interest, but if something’s wrong, that has to take precedence, right? No matter the consequences?”
But that all seemed like a dream. Like ever disliking Riley, thinking of a time in which Steve and Stark were at odds was almost inconceivable. Sure, he could list a million reasons why they shouldn’t work, but here they were anyway, working.
Both men stopped as they finally reached the other wall. It was impossible for them to have seen it upon walking in, the shadows and the furniture blocking any sort of clear view.
Guilt washed over Steve. He hadn’t even remembered to call Pepper. How long had he been sitting there?
“It doesn’t have to be physical to be fucking assault, Sparky,” Clint hissed. “He had no right to say those things.”
that you had something to do with it,” Tony murmured, eyes wide as he scrolled through his phone. “Look at this,” he said to Steve handing the phone over. Clint caught the towns local website pulled up on the screen. He knew the article that Tony found. He knew what the headline read.
Mission accomplished, Tony changed the subject. “You have a nice little chat with that Hammer drone?”
“Steve, no,” Tony interrupted, rushing forward. He grabbed Steve’s outstretched hand and pressed it to his neck – his new favorite habit – and felt Tony’s pulse jump under his fingers. “JARVIS wasn’t wrong; I’m probably the healthiest I’ve ever been,” he smiled. “Steve, yesterday I held up a ceiling! Last night, I bent in ways that I definitely thought were impossible for the human body to achieve before. Jesus, last week I went on a run with you and Sam!”
“Steve, I may not be in expert when it comes to this, but I’m almost positive camping doesn’t consist of me sitting in the car in the middle of the woods.”
scream – as he whipped around, a hand already over his arc reactor while the other grasped for the gun he knew he didn’t have on him.
"I've been thinking about that, these last few weeks. On what I should do. How I should move forward."
“So testy,” Loki smiled. It looked even more terrifying with the new look that he’d been sporting. His face was ragged, hair in a tangled mess. His clothes were dirty, almost stale looking, no doubt from being locked in the same room for weeks. It just made him look more menacing. “I said I couldn’t help you in here. I can help you if you let me go.”
Barnes tilted his head minutely, before standing up, slowly stalking up to Tony, a menacing force towering over him. “I wanted to talk to you.”
Steve stepped between the two of them. “Alright, let’s calm down.” He turned towards Tony. “You know he’s more valuable to us alive,” he said calmly, trying to soothe Tony’s bristling anger. “He’s not exactly my favorite person in the world either, but we can still use him. Besides, someone once told me that blowing people’s brains out isn’t always the answer. I reckon he was right.”
Rhodes stood, walking towards the door. “The military doesn’t want to lose its golden egg. I’m gonna go pull some strings and get the techs looking into it. If we’ve got every possible side of the law looking for him, there’s no way we won’t be able to find Tony.”
Phil raised an eyebrow. “Maybe one day. Alright, I’m off. I’ll start to dig around for HYDRA, let you know if I hear anything.” He gave a small salute before walking back towards his squad car.
The Captain caught his foot mid swing, easily using the momentum to flip Tony over and onto the ground next to him. With the air knocked out of him, Tony had no time to recover before The Captain was back on his feet and dragging Tony along with him. He grabbed fistfuls of Tony's shirt, pulled him up like he was a sack of flour, and forced him against the wall.
But Steve found himself slipping. He knew it; everyone else knew it. To be fair, just by looking around the state of the room in front of him, the rest of his team wasn’t doing much better. Clint was nothing more than a stumbling bar now. Steve knew he would forever have nightmares of even going so far as having to check the man’s pulse a few times. Bucky is withdrawn, again. With the loss of Clint and the weight of Coulson’s demise, his friend had closed up so far into his shell, Steve wasn’t sure he’d ever get him back out.
This shouldn’t be happening. Tony had made sure the warehouse he chose was free of security or and shipping employees. The trail of bread crumbs he left Hammer was almost embarrassingly easy. There would have been no reason for that extra firepower.
Steve shook his head. “I don’t know what they’re doing. But whatever they’re up to, it can’t be good.”
“Force of habit, I guess. Why do you care? Didn’t realize my father was such a sore spot for you as well.”
The duo stepped in and Steve reached over to his right, flicking on the lights. The room was washed in the florescent glow, revealing walls of empty cabinets, dusted over desks, and abandoned chairs.
Not trying to convince the man otherwise, Loki flew down the hall, turning right to find the door, just as Barton promised. He flew it open, ready to run into the sewers-
He could still feel heat of his anger smoldering in his veins. Cap bringing in Odinson in the way he did was a mistake, but Tony didn't exactly handle it with grace either. This game that they were playing with each other was childish, and after the consequences of today, Tony knew he had to change his tune. Maybe that's why The Captain invited him here, to finally sit with his family. An extension of an olive branch. It was the start of something more meaningful between the two of them; he knew it, Cap knew it. Barnes sure as hell did.
Now that he found himself sitting between the two and their staring contest, Steve itched for his gun. There was a high probability that this turns bloody very quickly.
The pair raced off, following the AI’s directions. The crumbling house – of course it was the collapsing one,
to them. But the last time he and Obie had talked about The Commandos, Tony and The Captain were… less than friends. At least in the public eye.
“You are,” Natasha argued. “I would know if you weren’t. Besides, you lasted longer this time. You’re getting stronger.”
“A doctor?” Tony asked, watching as the man tilted the tongs, the boiling metal slipping seamlessly into the mold he had earlier created.
He’d read the report that Fury gave him. He read how Stane had almost taken Tony from him. He read how he almost walked into this house only to find it empty.
Loki pushed away from the wall, stalking over to Steve. “HYDRA has you between a rock and a hard place. They've scattered your warriors and removed your allies. Why do you think they haven’t struck yet? You’re weak, vulnerable, but yet they haven’t made another move. Want to know why? Because they’re waiting for you to choose.”
It was mainly Phil’s doing. He caught on to it pretty quick; then again, he always did. He was always so sharp, so bright. It didn’t take him long to see through Clint at all. That every time he tried to push away, it was a silent plea to never leave. He was never overbearing. Just simple things – a cooked dinner here, a foot rub there. Just small reminders that he cared; that Clint always had a home with him.
“None this drastic,” Steve retorted. “They’re fighting as if they're completely different units.” The thought hit him like a ton of bricks. “Maybe because they are different.” He knew something didn't add up, he
Tony uploaded another picture of the now dead HYDRA goon. There was no way that he couldn’t find out who the man was now. The crystal clear pictures Tony had taken before he left The Captain with the body would give him answers in a matter of minutes.
Steve doesn’t remember when the battle was, or where he was. He doesn’t even remember what the Commandos were doing there. He just remembers the thud of his shield off of his body.
Hesitantly, Tony laid a hand on Steve’s forehead, happy to find some warmth finally reach back at him. Without thinking, he slowly pushed his hand farther back, pushing through the barely damp stands of Steve’s soft hair. He sighed, before leaning against the wall, letting gravity do the rest as he slipped down to the floor, making sure his hand still rest in Steve’s hair. After staring for long moments at the steady rise and fall of Steve’s chest, Tony finally felt his eyes slip shut.
Steve shook his head, his hand tracing Tony's beard. "I mean us. What is this? What are we doing here?"
A small ding came from the elevator, and the two men stepped on in. “And what about Clint? I thought I saw that- ”
He reached back down for Barnes, swallowing past the nausea that tried to make another appearance, and began to trek in the direction of their only salvation.
Tony tilted his head, as if to ponder. “There was something else, wasn’t there,” he murmured, tapping his fingers against his chin. “Ah, yes. Just so happens that I’ve got family at each of these destinations. If we’re going to continue with this little tryst, you’re going to have to get my family’s approval, right?” Tony questioned. “That is, if you’re interested,” he added with another shrug of his shoulders.
Steve sat down on her other side, a strong arm tugging her to lay against his chest as it wrapped around her shoulders. “They sell a pizza here called
Natasha couldn’t help the laugh that escaped her chest, the smile on her face wide and carefree. She grabbed the laptop for Tony, making a slight detour to the fridge for the takeout menu. Walking back over, she handed the menu to Steve, curling up on the couch next to Tony, shoving her feet under the man’s leg.
He sprinted to the nearest corner, pay phone in sight. He didn’t have any change on him, but that didn’t matter because he didn’t know any of The Commando’s numbers by heart anyway. That didn’t mean he didn’t know where he could find help, however. Tony quickly picked up the receiver and smashed 0.
“I’m not talking about Lucky,” Clint replied, biting his lip. Of course, the universe was rarely on his side, and he was stopped by Tony shouting in surprise yet again. The other men raced over, following the sound. Once he saw what had caused the scream, Clint groaned, wiping a hand over his face in frustration, ignoring the sharp pain that pulsed on his face when he did so. Tony had opened the closet, but he certainly hadn’t found the first aid kit.
Her skin was still warm as he tugged her across his chest, arms winding around the still body as he sobbed into her perfect hair. If he had been ten minutes earlier, he might have been able to save her.
Scrambling out of the car, the pair raced to the back as Sam popped the trunk, tossing Steve a ski mask before putting one on himself. Not waiting for Sam to try and talk him out of it again, Steve raced down the block, towards the burning building.
Clint looked away, rubbing hand through his hair. “I don’t know how to tell you. I asked Delmar how he got they managed to get the bombs into SI, and well, he used to work there.”
They’re easy to pick out in a crowd. Overlooked by most, but not by Steve. Not by anyone who’s worn the fatigues. They’re drawn to each face, staring at it like they were looking in a mirror. Knowing eyes and a faint nod, the only confirmation that they as well share the look. That they’re stuck with it too.
A burst of angry tones blasted in response, and Steve slumped in his seat, realizing that he probably should have answered his phone.
"No," Tony laughed in honestly. "But I don't really have time to sit back and think about it. It’s time to buck up, soldier, shut your goddamned mouth, and let your engineer help you.”
Steve raised his gun again, ignoring the pleas before shooting another one down, humming slightly when the other men cowered as blood sprayed over them. Without another second of hesitation, Steve moved to the next target, stopping only when he felt a hand on his shoulder.
“No way that you woke me up at the ass-crack of dawn and dragged me to this hellhole all for nothing, because you didn’t check the damn sizes!”
The attacker smiled, getting ready to pounce shed came flying out of the air, hitting the man square in the chest, taking him down easily. Before Tony could get his bearings, a muscular blonde man came running in front of him, picking up the shield.
“You got about fifteen seconds to get out of this house before I come over there and start swinging.”
“See! There you go again. What work could you possibly have right now? We have no leads, no raids, nothing. Steve, you’re running on fumes. Go home and take a day.”
They stumbled, Steve catching Rhodes with one arm and the railing with the other before the both of them went crashing to the floor. The floor was trembling, as if an earthquake was approaching, the lights above them shaking like leaves in the wind, dust and plaster from the ceiling falling through the light rays.
Clint crouched low, creeping to where the sounds were coming from. He peeked around a tree to see a man with his back turned to him, looking around, as if lost.
He groaned, rubbing a hand across his forehead. Turns out there was much more to Tony Stark than meets the eye.
Steve groaned, rubbing his hands over his face. “I have no idea. Who knows what Stark will do now that someone has made a- wait,” Steve stopped himself. “Do you hear that?”
“It’s simple military tactics. Tricking the enemy into thinking they’ll get what you want when you really get what you want.”
Steve rolled his eyes. “I didn’t think it was a good idea, but it was a necessary one. You need to fall in line and realize you aren’t in charge here.
Clint had never been much of a reader. No one had really bothered to teach him when he was in the circus, but even when he finally did learn, it seemed like a waste of time. Natasha, on the other hand, always seemed to have a book at hand. Whether she was curled up in the tower or on the way back from a long mission, Clint constantly saw her with a different classic in her hand.
“The kidnappers,” answered Bucky. “They must have wanted time before Stark’s disappearance went public. Maybe they had to move him somewhere more secure.”
Steve stood in the lower bowels of the speakeasy, staring at an unconscious Loki. The man had a nasty head wound, blood dripping down his pale skin. He had been bound to a chair, positioned directly under the singular hanging light bulb.
Tony pulled away from Steve’s grip. “I’m not some wilting flower, Cap. I don’t need a keeper; I can handle myself just fine.”
Tony slumped against the closet wall, letting his weight slide him down to the floor, his hands still white-knuckling his scotch.
“Out,” Bucky snapped. Steve lifted his head to see a poor Commando waking up from his slumber, seeing Steve and Bucky, and making a hasty retreat.
Piece rolled his eyes. “Please. You’re an idiot if you think I’ll believe anything that comes out of your mouth. You gave me a fake location to where The Captain was hiding some of his files.”
Tony nodded through another gulp of water. “Swimmingly; I should be good to go for a couple of days.”
That was five days ago. Ever since then, a new warehouse was constantly getting overrun by HYDRA’s forces. As soon as Steve and his men would race out to help, there would be two more problems waiting for them. Steve actually had to call Clint back in to help before he had a chance to talk to Phil. With the increased criminal activity, Coulson was putting in the extra hours as well, so there was no free time to snag the officer to ask him about Pierce. Steve knew it was driving Clint up the wall, but until they figured out what was going on, it was out of their hands.
"Wait, Clint, don't!" he yelled, grabbing at the man. "You go in here, he'll roast you." He could see the argument building in Clint's mouth, eyes alight with rage, but Tony placated him before he could utter a single word. “There’s a maintenance entrance this way,” he stated, tugging on Clint’s arm. “We’ll sneak through without Obie noticing.” Clint followed wordlessly, but he could feel the buzzing tension radiating off him.
“Touché, Captain,” Stark responded with a smirk. “I’ll be in touch,” he added before sauntering out of the room, giving a small salute.
The man doubled over when Romanoff pressed a finger against his shoulder wound. “I asked you a question. I expect an answer.”
Looking down at the photo, Steve could see an aged Amand Jernberg surrounded by family, laughing brilliantly into the camera.
Steve had lost count the number of times he read over that file. He just remembers ending up in Tony’s arms just holding him and refusing to let go. There was a very short list of people Steve thought he could actually kill, and if he was still alive, Stane would have met the wrong side of Steve’s shield.
Steve blatantly ignored Natasha’s heated stare. “Coming,” he muttered, walking away from the redhead.
Steve looked away, biting his lip. When they’d married, Steve had promised Tony a better life, not one where they’d have to hide who they were on a daily basis. Steve had promised him happiness and love, something that the smaller man had never had. He couldn’t consider himself much of a superhero if he couldn’t even take care of his husband. But Steve wasn’t a real superhero. Not anymore.
"Ah, Captain," he jeered. "Finally awake. I was wondering if my men had actually killed you or not."
"Haven't you heard?" Stane continued. "You've been convicted for the murder of the upstanding officer of Phillip Coulson."
Tony shot an arm out and grabbed at her scrubs. “Is he… Will he be- ” Tony broke himself off with a sigh. He couldn’t even get through the words. Tony had prided himself on how he’d created an armor over the years. A way to protect himself for others. Their feelings, reactions, problems. But Tony knew, deep down, that there would be no way to save himself from the burden of Barnes’ death. That after everything they’d just been through, Tony would still have to go back to The Captain and his men, and tell them that he hadn’t been quick enough. That he hadn’t been good enough. He could almost see The Captain’s face now. And Tony knew that it would kill him.
Bucky took over pulling the suit down, huffing in frustration as the fabric got caught up in Tony’s current position. He yanked Steve away from Tony, pulling the smaller man off the counter. Tony sucked in deep breaths in front of them as he stood on shaky legs. His eyes we’re almost completely black, and a tent had formed in the front of his suit. Steve and Bucky each grabbed the suit at a different shoulder, pulling it down to his waist.
He was sure that was the point Fury was trying to make, by sending them to different corners of the world.
“Because that implies that he can behave at all,” Sam countered, opening the screen door onto the porch.
When he first got involved with The Commandos, there were plenty of nights that he lay awake wondering how Steve not only kept the rag-tag group together, but also drove the reins. It seemed like all of them had a reason to do what they did, and given their backgrounds, would have ended up resorting to some sort of crime in their lifetimes. But Steve, or the illusive Captain, as he was known at the time, didn’t seem to fit that mold. Of course, now he knew better. He knew why Steve was the way he was. He knew that he of all people had the most reason to be involved in what they were.
“Well, I seem to be getting mixed reviews on my performance,” he answered, wiping a hand across his sweaty brow as he eyed the traffic lights sway in the wind. Weather in the city was always a menace, but none more than summer. Each day had a person feeling like they were melting into the concrete, but even the nights, even after the sun long disappeared from the sky, did the weather continue to reign. The humidity hung in the air like a damp rag, and the city-folk would sweat and groan, and pray for winter. On the worst nights, on nights like this, the ocean would answer their prayers, and send a harsh breeze up the harbor and in between the buildings. It would blast over skin-soaked clothes and chill anyone right down to the bone, bringing with it the salt of the sea and the threat of a storm, enough to make anyone pray for the sun again. It was a vicious cycle.
know where Stark was,” Stane mussed, standing up slowly. “Anyway. Loki’s being sent away; our business is done. Do yourself a favor and stay out of my way. Don’t forget that you’re not the only man with power in this city.”
say to Clint. Phil was family to all of them, but to Clint? To Clint he was everything. And now it’s all gone, in a blink of an eye. Steve could understand what that was like, but it crushed him to know that there was someone else that shared the same fate.
Steve gave her an odd look before busting out in laughter. “What Hallmark card did you steal that shit from?” he grinned.
It was over before he could even enjoy it, his release spilling onto Steve’s chest with a broken cry. Steve followed soon after, a few more rough strokes and he was gone, biting into the meat of Tony’s shoulder. He gasped, and relished in the pain, pulling Steve closer.
“Here,” Steve said, shuffling close enough to Bucky to stuff a grenade in his pocket. Bucky’s hand quickly replaced his, no doubt trying to distinguish the object. “We follow along until we find the files. Then, we’re going to improvise.”
He saw Steve open his mouth to talk, but Tony brought his other hand up to cover his mouth. Steve stopped, eyes widening just a fraction. He knew what Steve was going to say. It was the same thing he whispered each night they were together, just as Tony was drifting off to sleep. It was the same thing he’d admitted to Tony on the floor of his office, the words fumbled out of a nervous mouth. It was the only thing that had seemingly kept Tony sane these past few weeks.
“No time,” Tony retorted, swinging his legs back over the chair. “You heard Wilson. We’ve got work to do.”
“Tony. I’m still on my way: I just need to stop at headquarters first. Call me if anything happens, and please stay safe.”
Bucky’s hands tightened on the wheel, pressing harder on the gas pedal as they raced through the cramped New York streets – well, as much as one could race through them. Bucky swerved left, just dodging the station wagon that had cut them off, speeding past them with a metal middle finger pressed against the glass. Beside him, Tony didn’t even comment on the erratic driving, his eyes never leading the phone in his hands, fingers typing wildly on the screen.
Something told Tony, however, that usually these interviews yield better results. Barton was pacing up and down the room, biting at his fingernails with a tight face.
Tony sighed before getting to work. Stark Industries was in the clean energy business now, and hopefully, at some point, Tony will be able to create individual systems for businesses, hell, even homes.
Tony drained the rest of the glass, shuddering at the thought of Steve out there in danger without him.
Clint cursed again, desperately searching for his phone. Phil must think that he was in there. Clint got more frantic, searching every pocket he could.
Steve walked to the pawn shop after his meal. Nodding to the cashier, he made his way to the back of the shop. The pawn shop was a front of course. Steve dropped his shield off at the back of the store, ‘
“Sam, hold on a second,” Barnes muttered, watching with disgusted fascination at Pepper kept reaching down his chest.
“It was nice, until history started to repeat itself,” retorted Barnes with a shake of his head. “He’s not cut out to handle another loss like that. Steve’s strong, but this thing is killing him.”
Steve had been against it for the longest time; he’d seen it kill enough people. When he became a Looper, however, things changed. The serum gave the user heightened abilities. Faster reflexes, impressive strength. Perfect for work. It wasn’t too long before Steve found himself depending on the small vials to get him through day to day.
The drive was quiet, but it was pleasant. Steve let himself drift; Clint and Natasha’s soft conversation in the back seat, as well as Tony’s tapping against the steering wheel lulling him to sleep. It seemed like no time had passed when he felt Tony’s hand shake his shoulder gently. “Rise and shine, buttercup,” he teased. He let Tony manhandle him out of the car, staring blankly at the building in front of him.
“And drinking the hard stuff again, I see.” Natasha pointed down to his cup. It was a glass tumbler. It wasn’t Tony’s fault he couldn’t find a coffee mug.
Bucky shoved him gently, as if reading his thoughts, before crouching down and slipping between Tony’s legs. He cast a final glance at Steve –
"Ok, normal speed. Keep playing the footage." Tony watched the cameras minutes after he had already driven off when finally a hulking figure stepped out onto the road. "There. Can we follow him through other cameras?"
His eyes had been opened. He saw the man behind the curtain, he saw the true face of the system on how the country worked, and it sickened him. Riley’s father was just the beginning. War profiteering, lobbying, hush money, scandals. They circled him like buzzards, suffocating him.
No, not that kind of warm. Not the kind where he had to roll up his sleeves to stay cool in a sweltering summer. Not the kind where his legs always stuck to the backs of leather seats. Not where he tasted the salt from his brow, or felt the dampness of his clothes.
JARVIS’s words had Tony tearing down the other side of the hallway, hoping to reach Obie before he’d descend the stairs. Steve was right – Obie couldn’t know that he was harboring The Commandos in his basement.
Another hand pressed against his forehead, shaking as it brushed lightly through his hair. “Buck?” he heard.
“Are these your friends?” she continued, blatantly ignoring his tone, taking another step across the street. She was wearing yet another atrocious outfit, a horrifying tracksuit with an equally vile print to go with it. He knew that she was probably getting ready to stomp down the street to pick up the rest of her gang, the gaggle of ladies swooping through the neighborhood like a pack of Botox-ridden wolves.
Without even thinking, Tony burst from his chair and into The Captain’s office. The man sprang awake instantly, aiming his hidden gun towards Tony immediately. Upon seeing Tony however, his face crumpled in embarrassment, the gun falling away quickly. “Sorry,” he forced out, still breathless with adrenaline. “What’s up?”
Tony’s smile. The way that it could light up a room more than fireworks. Or his eyes. How the amber specks seemed to be constantly moving, like tiny little gears continuously moving in those brown orbs. When Tony would bite his lip when he has caught up in his own head, nimble hands dancing over his creations with practiced ease. Or when he scrunched his face when the days first light hit his tanned face, causing Tony to burrow further into Steve’s chest.
“And you lived here alone, after the- ” Hill paused, looking down at your notes. “After the death of your fiancé, is that right?”
And then all of a sudden, it will be tomorrow and I will have lost a full night’s work due to your excessive mother-henning.”
Tony thought the man looked perfect before, but after this morning? There was still a 65% chance that he had a stroke.
Tony felt wetness form along his collarbone as The Captain burrowed his face into his shoulder. Tony almost groaned. He did not sign up for this.
Eventually Phil sagged, almost crumpling against Tony. Tony just tightened his arms, frowning at how quickly his hands were able to join on the other side of him, Tony basically engulfing the man. He was so small, so
Tony finally did stop when he felt Steve frozen beneath him. He pulled away, staring into Steve’s eyes that had found a way to become even wider.
“Many times on Asgard, my warriors and I were sent to fight on different realms. And I did, of course, for the glory of my home. But after each one I couldn’t help but be faced with grief. And even now, after my brother and the Chitauri, I am faced with the same guilt. I call myself a god, but I am no different than a simple beast, reigning down lightening and terror onto different worlds. I often find myself asking about all the lives that have been lost at my hand, sometimes so much that my grief consumes me.”
he thought to himself. He toed his shoes off, kicking them towards the general direction of the front door before turning around, intent of heading to the bathroom to start up the shower. His journey was stopped however, by the ringing of his cell phone.
Before he knew it, Sam was charging, pushing him down until he was sitting in one of Tony’s plush armchairs. “Sit your ass down, you’re pulling out your stitches,” was all he said, steady hands roaming over Steve’s body until he was satisfied that Steve wasn’t going to keel over. “You’re going to go over the deep end, Steve,” Sam continued. “Don’t lose it here. Stark wouldn’t want that.”
Tony snorted, leaning back into Bucky. “Yeah, right. Maybe I wore it just for you. Maybe I was looking for a reason to be late to this meeting.”
“Not a good idea,” Tony continued. “Given the right price, these people would do anything. That’s what makes them so dangerous. Provoking them while we’re in the middle of this shit storm probably wouldn’t be your finest move.”
Tony slammed the door to The Captain’s office harshly, some of the sketches flying off the wall from the force of it. Tony glared at the papers drifting through the air as his temper continued to rise. In another grunt of frustration, Tony ran over to the wall of pictures and let loose, arms moving in a whirlwind until every sketch, photo, and memory were torn off the wall and strewn onto the floor at his feet.
“Of course, Sir,” the disembodied voice replied. If Steve didn’t know any better, it was said almost smugly. “Shall I start another cup for you, Captain?”
There was no time like the present. Yinsen was right; he may not have constructed the bomb, but the situation doesn't seem to sway in his favor. While The Ten Rings have kept him alive this long, there's no telling how they'd respond to their own men being killed. They don't exactly have the best track record of keeping their cool - in fact, Tony had records on more than enough instances where they'd retaliated with gruesome violence and murder for events that were eons less devastating than this. Tony knew first hand that a mild inconvenience would be enough to piss them off.
They’re everywhere. You should stop while you’re ahead, before you get too deep. Quit poking around the different groups here, because every friend you make in this city will give you three more enemies. There is no way I’m going to get myself involved over something like this just based on your paranoia. You know what they say; curiosity killed the cat.”
Steve rubbed at his forehead. “Look, I’ve been nice, I’ve stood for photos, signed every scrap of paper you pushed at me. But this?” Steve gestured to the costume.
Clint Barton sat in the back of a nearly vacant hospital’s cafeteria, flanked by Bucky and Nat, staring incredulously at a smirking Tony Stark.
Barton was making amends, assuming Tony was here to stick around. Was he? When he jumped in the car with Barnes to go and save Steve - there was no hesitation. It was if all of their problems had evaporated, and his brain couldn't focus on anything besides
Tony whirled around frantically, Steve shooting a concerned glance him way.  “Steve,” he breathed shakily.
Tony hummed, but pulled back, face still distraught. “Well, yeah. Relationships are all about communication, right?” he tried to joke.
Steve sighed softly. He knew Natasha had made the right call. SHIELD was compromised; that meant everything had to go. But Steve found himself wondering if they were ready for the backlash. But not right now. That was a problem for another day. There were more pressing matters, like-
But, there was a larger part of her that was pleased that Sam was by her side. Upon Steve sharing the news yesterday of their fate, Natasha was conflicted. She has spent a majority of her life on her own. And while she knew that she would be able to thrive in whatever environment the FBI put her in, she couldn’t help but feel a certain uneasiness, one she hadn’t felt since she was a child.
She glared at him in return. “Compliments will get you nowhere,” she snapped. “What on Earth are you doing here? Tony, you should be in bed, you almost had a heart attack today!”
Steve spun around, brain scrambling for a response. Any answer he could have concocted fell apart when he saw who was speaking to him. A woman in a hard stance, with an equally stern face, glared up at him.
“Although, maybe he’s already scared everyone away by threatening them with the lamp,” Tony laughed. “There’s always a crazy in every suburb.”
The plan was beautiful in it's simplicity. Pierce sent Rumlow out to look for Stark and The Captain to “place another bomb” all the while The Monger traced the electromagnetic waves of the transmitter. Rumlow gets caught by The Captain’s men, and dragged back to one of their hideouts. Rumlow refuses to cooperate, biting on the tooth, which of course crushes the transmitter along with the cyanide, making it impossible for Stark to trace it back to them.
Tony bit his bottom lip. “Not sure. Only a few people have access to my calendar, but since JARVIS can’t find the initial coding to have come from their computers, that means that someone hacked into the private server to update my calendar. Which means we have to go through the CPU’s individually to find a trace.”
“Captain, this man is going in to make his final move, do you really think he’s going to half ass it?” Fury countered. “Now, while you’ve been guarding the SSR secrets all these years, how much have you updated the files?”
and there’s still no sign of him. No proof, no demands, no….. no body,” Steve cringed on the last word. “I don’t know what to do. You two are my last options; Tony never shut up about you two; I know you love him, just as he loves you. And I know that you’ll do anything to get him back in one piece.”
Steve was in his office when he got the notification that Hammer’s men had activated the sensors. He thought about calling Stark, but Steve’s foolishness probably burned the bridge with that relationship. The least he could do was stick to the plan and protect the man's warehouse and weapons. Later, when they'd brought home a few of Hammer's men, maybe Steve could use them as an enticing apology.
Who was it this time? Another delivery man confused by the lack of apartment markings, or another group of Jehovah’s Witnesses’ hoping for a conversion?
“This isn’t a joke,” she hissed. “Tony, you’ve been shot, kidnapped, assaulted, and tortured! Ever since you’ve gotten involved with this mafia, it’s brought you nothing but pain.”
But Steve wasn’t listening. He practically skipped across the street, giddy in a way he hadn’t been since he was a child, listening to Tony’s complaining huffs as he dragged his feet across the pavement behind him.
Steve turned to a blur, a blob of black and red with a yellow halo. Something was patting his check gently, but it seemed to reverberate through his skull. There were sounds, but they were so far away. He was drifting, sailing on a boat, finally at peace.
Steve nodded. “Stay on my six,” he replied, charging off into the least lit space. He could feel flames licking against his legs, singing his clothes, but Steve pushed forward, aiming for the east wall. With one good shove, Steve felt the wall give, bricks and mortar flying everywhere as they managed to not only break out of the building, but break into the next one.
“Don’t worry about it Happy, I’m just gonna slip in backstage. Won’t even be here for two seconds, promise.”
“I’m going to tell you the same thing I’ve told you every time you wake up,” answered Fury, crossing his arms. “You don’t get to ask any questions until you answer mine.”
“Shame,” Steve murmured, leaning in close, hovering over Tony’s mouth. “I would have let you throw me onto a flat surface.”
“Yes,” Steve confirmed. “For everyone.” He reached into his pocket, placing a sheet of paper on Fury’s desk. “I made a list.”
Bruce smiled. “I don’t think you realize who your roommates are. Let’s count, shall we? One, you’ve got a crazed mechanic who never learned to share. Then there’s your other half, a man who I heard went through hell to get you out of Budapest. And then a super soldier that carried you ten miles out of a bomb blast in New Jersey. Let’s not forget that there’s an actual god upstairs. And then there’s me, who could always improve on my anger management.”
Questions built up in her mind, but she already knew the answers. Why were they here? Easy, they were being stupid. How’d they get here?
Obadiah Stane burst through the doors, excitement getting the best of him. He watched at Justin Hammer skyrocketed up from his chair, Pierce himself even taken aback.
Steve frowned, looking at the ceiling. “You saw for yourself. JARVIS wasn’t on; there wasn’t any way for him to get the message out.”
“I’m a wanted man, Pep, I can’t go outside. Besides, Obie and I got to hold down the fort here. Please, Pep. I need someone I trust on this.”
Loki shrugged, peeling another portion of the apple. “Wasn’t my building that blew up; not my problem.”
wouldn’t be there. Leave it to Tony to distance himself from them in the most Tony way possible. Buying them a fucking building complex on the other side of the city.
Ward looked up from his phone, giving her a blank stare. “Well, can I use it? Or are you going to make me go on the floor?”
Hammer stuck his hand out immediately to shake with Pierce’s. Sure, Tony Stark may be out of their reach due to his recent break with Grant, but The Commandos were still a force to be reckoned with. Passing up an opportunity to eradicate them would be foolish. And who knows, maybe Stark will come out of his hole with The Commandos out of the way, thinking himself safe. Nothing a simple sniper round couldn't handle, and that stain would be out of his life for good. Regardless of what happened, attacking this base will end up with Stane furious with Pierce. From then, it would only be a matter of time before one kills the other. And wouldn't that just solve the rest of his problems? Time to sit back and watch the show.
Steve rolled his eyes, shoving Bucky out of the way far enough so he could saddle up behind Tony instead, the smaller man fitting perfectly against his front. Tony leaned back into Steve instantly, the man’s shoulders shaking as he looked over at a grumpy Bucky, a look of glee no doubt gracing his face. Steve’s hands drew over Tony’s hips, fingers running up and down the expensive fabric.
Abruptly sharing the information with the team seemed like a decision that would be out of Steve’s wheelhouse. He’d never given anyone the full story, and here he was, giving the go for everyone to put the final puzzle together with the each of the pieces they had. Sure, with some of the files missing, it was more than enough reasoning to check the rest of them, but Bucky would have guessed that Steve would have gone and checked them all himself. Just an extra precaution, giving him a way to protect the rest of the group, as well as protect the location identities, if he stumbled on any that weren’t touched.
Tony froze at the subject change. Barnes snorted. “Please, like you would stop looking for them even after you left. I’m not stupid. Let me guess, you’ve found jack shit.” At Tony’s scowl, the man continued. “That’s alright, we haven’t gotten too far either. Stevie usually kills them before they step through the door.”
The benefit of having his identify unknown was that when he did actually make an appearance, it usually scares the living daylights out of whomever they were dealing with at the time. Steve puts in a few threats here and a few glares there, and boom: Steve gets everything and anything he wants from them.
“No offense old man, but are you gonna be able to make it all the way there?” Clint had already noticed Tony’s labor breathing.
Steve felt his hands clench into fists. “How is this so hard for you to understand?” Steve hissed at the other man. “Tony’s dead. He’s
was dead. Each day was a blur of alcohol, each night nothing more than a faint whiff of smoke and blinding lights. It wasn't until the day of the funeral that everything had changed. Obie had found him passed out in some coke den, dragged him into the shower to spray him with a icy spray to sober him up. Tony sat idly, face blank as he was dressed, carted off in a car, and pulled to the cemetery. He didn't want to be there - he'd made his position very clear. He said that he'd only attend if Jarvis would be laid to rest the same day. It was then that they told him that Jarvis was already taken care of, already laying in the ground. They didn't even bother to hold a ceremony for him. To say Tony took that well was a lie - he did, after all, end up in a coke den.
Steve nodded. “I’ve thought about it many times. The SSR has been done for years, sometimes I find it ridiculous that I’m still guarding their mysteries. But every time I think about it, I just – I can never bring myself to do it. Honoring their memory, I suppose. Continue to hold the line and keep at my job that I swore to all those years ago. But I refuse to use it, either.”
The shrill beeps rang loudly through his ears, each tone like a hammer against his skull. As if he couldn’t read.
Tony pulled Coulson closer, almost shoving the man into his embrace. He could feel the other man tense up and well, it wasn’t surprising. Hell, what was surprising was that Tony went in for a hug at all. He and the less-than law abiding cop had never been close; they barely interacted. In fact most of their dalliances consisted of snarky comments and dull sighs. The only real coexistence between the two was the time Coulson sprung him from jail and in return, Tony played a role as a key player in the arrangement of his murder.
“Please, Coulson,” Fury replied, shaking his head. “That’s old news. Word travels fast on the streets. Everyone knows that it was a set up and the two of them are working together.”
“Have you lost your mind?! You let Stark live and he’ll take everything you’ve got. Everything I’ve got! You’ll see what he becomes.”
The sun beat down on his back like an old, forgotten friend. Sure, New York had its fair share of harsh summers, but down here, the sun was a different beast entirely. He strolled down the street, smiling as he passed the screaming children roughhousing in their front yard. The walk home from work was long, but Sam never took the car. As routine as the route was, there was something about it that never bored him. Maybe it was hearing the children playing every day, maybe it was the smell of freshly cut grass, or even the Sun heating his skin.
Steve hummed, not looking up from where he was untangling the mess of cords left behind by Clint, set on rewrapping the microphones neatly. For as many times as he’s chastised Clint for mishandling the equipment, his friend always had the same response:
Steve grinned, obviously pleased with the answer. He took one of Tony’s hands and kissed the inside of him palm. “Let me know if anything hurts, and we’ll stop, alright?”
She yanked the door open and lo and behold, Steve Rogers and Tony Stark were stood in her hallway, backs facing her.
“Yes, Cap, I’m peachy,” Tony smiled. “In desperate need of a shower,” he added, picking some stone out of his hair, “but in one piece.”
“What?” Steve snapped his head towards Bucky, finally taking his eyes away from the door. “What do you mean? Are you sure you checked everywhere?”
“All these states have shit about Lincoln in their state slogan because they have no accomplishments other than some past president walking through their fields.”
“But how?” Loki found himself whispering. He prided himself on being able to stay one step ahead of the rest; its how he was able to thrive on his own. But nothing - none of his contacts or his own notes - had even hinted at a rat within The Commandos.
Steve snorted into the phone. He had to hand it to the guy; that wasn’t one you heard every day. “You expect me to believe that?” Steve scoffed.
The pair broke off into silence, just laying together on Tony’s floor. Clint was trying to figure out what he should do when Tony met his gaze. How long had he known Clint was there?
With that, he slammed down on the gas, the car lurching forward as he gained speed. Hitting the underside of the steering wheel, a hidden console appeared, Steve’s fingers masterfully dancing over the panel to lock the car into auto-drive. Another series of taps and Steve felt his seat fall back, his tux already being pulled away until only a familiar suit of red white and blue remained. Smiling down at his costume, Steve reached behind him and pulled up his cowl before grasping back at the steering wheel.
The Air Force was a blessing. The structure, the comradery, the pride of it all. He could see how his father had ended up here. The idea of fighting for a higher purpose sang to him and he was immediately addicted.
Steve woke up late at night, still in the alleyway. Trying to piece together what had happened, he cursed. His future self was nowhere to be seen. At least he left the shield.
“The mob for the mob man,” Steve responded from memory. “They started small, picking up bits and pieces, whispers from the streets. They knew who to talk to, and it wasn’t long before they had enough to start tipping off the local mafias. Who had the best guns, which routes to avoid when smuggling, the best times to operate their business.”
Tony, after hanging up on Coulson, continued on his venture of getting the hell out of dodge. The Commandos knew where to go, and Tony was given the perfect window to slip out of their lives for good. And, of course, the lying Captain got the added benefit of knowing that his just as deceitful best friend had survived.
“Pulling away. You’re doing it again. You starting to look more and more like the Tony Stark I met when first assigned to you.”
Sorry Civil War, I know which direction you wanted me to go, but I refuse to acknowledge your existence.
“If necessary,” Natasha shrugged. “I wasn’t lying when I said I needed to see if Fury was going to do his job or not. His real job; putting the American people first, and not worrying about government guidelines.”
Steve walked down the hall and down the first flight of stairs, peering into the main room to find it empty. He didn’t expect it any other way. Sam was watching Thor, Natasha was watching Clint, Tony was safe, sleeping upstairs, and Bruce passed out long ago. And Bucky was downstairs, waiting for him.
Yes, everyone in New York knows about Tony’s little scuffle with The Captain and his men. Then again, there was no way Tony could hide it when they basically had a battle royal in the middle of the streets just three days ago. Turns out, despite how hard he had tried, he still ended up trending on Twitter anyway.
Steve looked around, seeing the rest of his crew filing back into the room. “But how?” Maybe this was another distraction. Another plot to draw them out of the speakeasy and into the streets.
Rumlow didn’t look impressed. “Come on. My friends here are going to watch your apartment while we have a little chat with Fury.” Steve grabbed his shield and let himself be forced out, not sparing a second glance to his floor.
Barnes sighed. “Listen, I can understand that you’re pissed. But you can’t blame Steve for what your father did or didn’t do.”
Steve shook his head. “This whole time you were alive? Why didn’t you- ” he broke off, a chill spilling over him. He glared back at the screen, staring back at the not-so dead man. “It was you,” Steve whispered hoarsely. “That whole time, it was you. You were the mole.”
“Because that’s not all,” Clint continued. “I just got off the phone with Phil. I asked him about Stark.”
“Clint, if I would’ve known, I wouldn’t have- ” Tony broke off. “They came out one day with his hat. They threw his officers hat at me and his blood was on it and I just
“What the hell is your problem?” Sam snapped. “If Tony Stark was dead, his body would be right over there, Hill. There’s still hope.”
“Clint, come on; let’s try and find him.” Tony and Clint raced off into the streets, but Natasha knew it was pointless.
“People have gotten the wrong apartment a few times before,” Natasha said. “I may or may not have ordered a few items from the local sex shop under her place just to watch her argue with the delivery man that she didn’t order a strap-on. Honestly, it’s better than cable.”
“You’ll get over it,” Steve chided, rubbing a hand down Tony’s flank. He stopped, however, when he reached back up towards Tony’s chest, where the new addition of an arc reactor currently resided. Carefully, watching Tony to make sure it was okay, Steve pulled down the sweatshirt he was wearing, the pair’s faces becoming washed in soft blue light.
“Being a public figure, he can’t exactly go into hiding and stay there for too long,” Steve continued. “His company is in shambles, and he’s got to go pick up the pieces. I guess Fury wants him to take care of it, the sooner the better.”
“Stevie doesn’t much like the current predicament,” Tony returned, tapping his fingers against the arc reactor. “If anything, he might like this one a little bit better,” he said, turning back to the new arc reactor that was sitting on the lab table, illuminated in a halo of white light from the nearby desk lamps.
There weren’t any. Coulson has basically sold himself in order to pull the FBI off their trail, and onto Pierce’s. “I don’t know what you expect me to tell the team,” Tony said finally. “Clint will have my head if I let you walk out that door alone.”
“Where’s Steve?” Tony asked. He knew who that blood belonged too. Part of him still clung to the slight uneasiness of violence, but it was barely present. After everything that had happened over the course of his relationship with The Commandos, Tony's tolerance for being directly involved in daily gang brutality had increased immensely. So much so, that the slim part of him that wasn't clouded by these doubts, were reveling in the fact that
“No!” Tony cut him off sharply. “It’s not that,” he reassured, giving Steve’s knuckles a quick kiss. “We’ve had this conversation already – you’re the only person left that has to forgive yourself for that.”
She sighed, and started to walk away. To Tony’s surprise, she came back, gently placing a first aid kit at his feet. “Just in case you change your mind.”
“How did you do this?” Steve snapped, gesturing to the rest of the room. “You didn’t know about any of these places!”
“A new reign of terror. Mass executioner, purging places everywhere. He came out of nowhere. In six months, he managed to get control of everything. What’s even worse, is that he did it all by himself. No army or anything.”
“We’re not all gonna fit down there!” Sam’s voice carried from the surface. Sure enough, by the time him, Rhodes, Bucky, and Natasha had made it down, they were basically pressed up against each other. “I’ll stay up here with Barton! We’ll keep any interested parties away.” Sam called.
Steve nodded slowly. “When The Commandos first faced HYDRA as a team, we were woefully unprepared. We lost a lot; we didn’t understand the things they were capable of. We barely able to scrape through a with a win. This time, we thought ourselves so much better. We thought that taking care of them would be no more work than dealing with the common pest. I was too headstrong to realize that we’re in the exact same boat as we were before.”
He still remembered, of course. There would be no way he could forget; Steve doubted he ever would forget. Everyone else was already gone: Howard, Erskine, even Phillips. He had managed to get Bucky hidden away, but he had been too late for her.
