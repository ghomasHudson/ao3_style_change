Nat seems to take this as confirmation of something. With a smirk, she pats Steve on the cheek and says: “Go.”

Tony gasps wetly. It’s too much. It’s too much, and it’s not enough. Tony makes a high, plaintive noise in the back of his throat and releases his cock, instead grabbing Steve’s waist with both hands and holding on for dear life as Steve does it again, and again, and again, short, slow, deep thrusts that keep Tony full to bursting, so much he can barely
Blessed silence envelopes them as soon as the doors close. When they reach the elevator, Tony drops his hand. In a flash, Steve reaches out and takes it before Tony can shove it back in his pocket. He looks past the fiery shield of Tony’s sunglasses directly into the man’s eyes, which are widening the longer Steve touches him.
Tony’s slightly hysterical, religion-hopping thoughts immediately hush. He’s always been weak for the way Steve says his name, with its soft

If Tony dies of happiness or asphyxiation (or both) here, so be it. There are worse ways to go, and none of them involve Steve Rogers making throaty sounds of bone-deep pleasure whenever Tony dares drive his hips forward to grind against Steve’s dick.

team, with as big a smile as he can muster even as he shoves his trembling hands into the back pockets of his jeans and pivots on a heel, fully intending on beelining it straight to the elevator and down to the workshop.
“Just want to make sure you get home okay.” Steve looks at him when he says it, but his eyes are shadowed, his expression suddenly remote.
“You can do it,” he replies, leaving Tony’s cock to run his hand up and down the outside of Tony’s thigh stretched around him, the curve of his flexing hip, his heaving side; Steve kisses him to drive the point home. “You feel so good, Tony.
“We broke up because you didn’t want the world to know about us,” Steve grumbles. “Now everyone definitely knows, and it took you almost dying for them to find out.”
Steve darts forward to nip and lick at Tony’s lips and groans before switching the rhythm of his hips to a slow, hard, purposeful grind that makes Tony’s whole body flush hot and his skin go tight. Someone is moaning like they’re dying, and Tony’s pretty sure it’s him. He grasps frantically at cloth and skin, takes and takes and
Tony feels reshaped, divinely molded to Steve’s perfect, overwhelming shape. And then he feels Steve’s mouth on him, lipping over his shoulders, dragging his tongue up the side of Tony’s neck and biting him on the meatiest part of his trapezius, holding him there like fucking animal with its willing prey. Tony makes a mindless, openmouthed sound of pure fucked-out
“Just waiting for the cavalry to arrive!” With a bloody grin, Piledriver reveals his other hand: in it, an old Stark bomb that went off the market
Sam laughs, clapping the sitting man on the shoulder. “Dude, if Tony told us you were here, I would have come downstairs and bugged you, myself.”
“’Course,” Tony replies, shifting aside to let Steve in. Even Steve looks tired after days of relentless action, ups and downs and everything in between—he looks hopeful, tired and harried, and a little lost, but there’s an undercurrent of something behind his eyes that makes the hairs stand up on the back of Tony’s neck. Steve’s always had issues with adrenaline after long battles, Tony remembers; he’s probably wondering where the heavy bags are.
“It was easier than going through with it,” he says, fingers fidgeting in his lap. It always strikes Steve as incredible, the fact that so few people know this side of Tony Stark, or know that it even exists: this is the same man who fended off an entire phalanx of reporters for Steve, a man who can charm his way through an entire room like it was a dance, a man who gives away billions faster than he can make them. And here he is now, hunched in on himself, fidgeting and quiet, breathless after just a few words. He sounds like he’s dreading whatever’s about to happen to him—to

of his heart) that he’s looking directly at Tony Stark, whose face has gone an endearingly bright shade of red, almost the same shade as the armor.
At 4:30, Steve looks himself over in the full-length mirror in his bedroom. The black jacket seems overbearing for early summer, and he wonders if it’s worth keeping on. Should he bring it just in case? Is the tie too much? It feels like too much, especially after thinking about Tony and his tongue. Now he’s hot under the collar, about to go on a date with someone else.
able to talk,” Steve huffs a laugh, presses a searing kiss against the bruise he left on Tony’s neck earlier and licking it with the wet flat of his tongue for effect. “You amaze me, Tony. You’re so—how are you so
“There you are,” he coos at a tiny device that looks remarkably like a laser pointer. Knowing Tony, it’s probably a real laser. He pockets it, assumably to put away later (or fish out of the laundry at the last minute).
Tony doesn’t need to see them to know that the woman’s hand is currently working its way up Steve’s arm from his wrist; he can hear it in the way Steve makes a point of clearing his throat, a laugh catching the tail end of it, and the whisper of hard soles chafing against concrete as he takes two steps back. Even when discouraging someone’s unwanted advances, Steve is the consummate gentleman.
The Soul Stone is hard, not because of the climb, or the Red Skull (although, in fairness, it does throw Steve for a moment), but because he has to watch the soul stone plummet to the earth knowing it won’t bring Natasha back. There are only so many things he can fix, and this isn’t one of them.
people, Tony. We’re allowed to be, at the end of the day, to each other if not the rest of the world.”
“What’s that face?” Tony asks, curious but still smiling. He pokes Steve in the middle of the forehead with a cheeky grin. “Keep frowning like that, your face’ll stick.”
Steve chuckles, nuzzling Tony’s nose with his. This close, Tony can count the freckles on Steve’s cheeks. There are twenty-seven. “I did.”
Steve, starfished on the mat, closes his eyes. “The only reason I’m the only person he follows on Twitter is because the rest of you aren’t on it.”
“Uh,” Steve is too distracted by the furious blush currently working its way past Tony’s pristine white shirt collar to respond at first. “Hi, Tony. Wanna, uh, have a seat?”
Later, Twitter gets hold of a picture of them walking out of the restaurant, smiling goofily at each other and totally unaware of any photographers.
“I meant to ask,” Steve says, sweeping Tony’s hair back from his forehead with an affectionate smile (and how,
Bruce, Wanda, and Vision stay behind with Steve to let the first wave through. Steve watches his teammates greet the airmen without fanfare, welcoming strangers into their private midst like it’s routine.
“Good afternoon, Captain,” Vision intones, looking up as Steve walks past. Steve’s tried over and over to get him to use his name, but just as he insists on calling Tony “Mr. Stark,” Vision only ever calls Steve by his title.
; Steve leans down and teases a nipple into his mouth, sucks hard with his damp, burning mouth while Tony tries to think past the way Steve is breaking him open on his cock and he’s barely even inside. Steve distracts him gamely, biting and teasing his nipples with that hot, wet tongue, staring down at Tony and smiling, his dog tags tickling Tony’s sternum, before he reaches for his cock and guides Tony’s hand, up and down, leisurely to make him relax, enough to make his muscles loosen and allow the head of Steve’s cock, the biggest part of him, slip inside fully.
It’s solid advice, actually. But for a moment, all Steve can think about is how dearly he misses that voice in his ear, his head, his
, he’d cried, so confident, so certain that his hero would come and put Howard through the wall and carry Tony away to safety—and then down the bottle comes…
Steve smiles again, bigger this time, and leans forward to kiss Tony properly, palming the small of his back but not pulling him in any closer. Tony is so greedy, so eager and weak, he takes Steve’s kiss without a second’s hesitation, rolling into it with a moan that’s been caught in his throat since Steve left the bed to—
Tony is up and calling the suit before the thought can finish itself. It’s waiting for him in the lobby by the time he steps off the elevator, rushing to fill the vacancy as panic claws at his throat. “J, cross-streets.”
“God, Tony, you look…” Steve’s words drop off. Tony isn’t so far gone that he can’t peek over his shoulder at him and raise a questioning eyebrow. Steve is flushed, pink and ruddy all the way down to his nipples, which are tight and the same pretty-pink as the tip of his cock standing up proudly against his abs. His hands come down to knead and massage Tony’s ass; he digs his thumbs in between them and pulls, spreading his cheeks so Steve can look his fill. Tony can feel how wet he is, dripping with lube and Steve’s come. He must look a mess. But based on Steve’s poleaxed expression, that’s not what Steve thinks. “Gorgeous,” he husks, looking Tony in the eye when he says it. Tony can’t
goes unspoken. One look at Steve and the Ancient One knew exactly what his plan was, apparently. He’s still reeling from their earlier comment. He watches the stone float up from the suitcase and drift toward the amulet resting against the Ancient One’s stomach; their hands flicker and move as it opens with a whisper of metal and gears that reminds Steve poignantly,
“Can’t have that,” Steve says, pressing a kiss between Tony’s shoulders. “I haven’t even gotten started with you, yet.”
Tony is distantly aware of his mouth hanging open, but he’s too caught up in how awful he feels seeing that smile on Steve’s face to respond. He shouldn’t be
this, because Tony’s focus is lasered in on only him, and it's easy for Steve to imagine Tony drawing up the schematics of Steve’s body in his mind, brainstorming all of the ways he wants to undo him and put him back together again.
It’s just Tony’s luck that the first person he runs into is Steve, glowing from a workout (it’s Thursday, Tony remembers, which mea ns cardio and time on the heavy bag) and just as beautiful as the last time Tony saw him.
Just as JARVIS reported, Tony finds the man in question standing outside on the northwest balcony, a stubby glass of something amber in one hand, the other resting on the sleek steel railing in front of him. Steve looks resplendent in the New York glow, dressed to the nines, his hair beaming golden in the city lights and against the flat blue-black sky. He’s smiling, looking off to the side, and Tony is forcefully reminded of the fact that just because something
“You try any harder and I might actually pass out,” Tony says, sliding off of Steve’s lap and leaning back on his elbows to drink in the tableau that is Steve Rogers reaching sideways for a pillow and stripping the white silk case right off it with his teeth. He’s still so hopped up on giddy endorphins
in ways he can’t articulate, not to Natasha, not to Sam, not to anyone. Sometimes, not even to himself. But the idea of dating, especially being set up on blind dates, makes something twist and sour in Steve’s stomach. The thought of being pushed into something despite his wishes because other people
Steve gets on his bike and hightails it upstate without another thought or word to anyone. The traffic is light once he gets past Yonkers, and it’s a blazingly fast straight shot to the compound from there. He pulls up to the main gate just as the press conference is supposed to be starting—did Pepper cancel it? Is she speaking on their behalf?
“I didn’t,” he says, watching Tony’s face intently. He knows it so well at this point, he can tell when Tony’s smile is fake or real, when he’s wounded and won’t admit it, when he’s tired but can’t sleep. So Steve notices all too easily when the corner of Tony’s mouth dips down, a fraction of an inch of a frown, before he recovers with a laugh and claps his hands.
“Yeah...yeah, Tony, that’s it,” Steve groans against his mouth, touching Tony’s fingers where they’re wrapped around his now-hard cock before covering them with his own, easing Tony’s hand up, down, up, over the head and back down, smearing Tony’s pre-come along the way, “fuck yourself on my cock, want to feel all of you.”
because it was so easy to go from best friends to romantic partners, and you had years of friendship between you to hearken back to. Plenty of moments when you thought you'd made it clear to Tony that you loved him, that you cared about him, that you admired and respected and yes, deep down (not that deep, really) were very much attracted to him.
The sound of Tony’s laughter could power a suit all by itself. His happiness makes Steve downright giddy. “I can’t believe I ever thought you were a stick in the mud.”
. Easy. Being with Steve feels like coming home. The superheroics are more than enough to satisfy their respective need for high-octane thrills; this need, now, here, is far simpler, and far easier to satisfy. He wants to see Steve, so he’s going to go see Steve. If it’s cheesy and saccharine and cliché, fuck it—they’ve earned the right to be.
Tony balls up the bandages from Steve’s hands and tosses them over his shoulder onto the chair behind him, a perfectly calculated arch from hand to seat that makes Steve’s head spin. Tony crosses his arms in front of him and hunches his shoulders up toward his ears. “Anyways, I’d rather
“Not yet,” Steve growls, but it doesn’t sound like it’s for Tony. More like Steve is talking to himself. And then Steve’s hand is in his hair, the other on his ass, and he’s taking Tony fast and hard, fucking up into him as he kisses Tony hard, slipping him tongue just to give him something to hold onto while Steve fucks him into another plane of consciousness entirely. Tony is powerless like this, speared on Steve’s hot, throbbing cock, being moved up and down by Steve’s hand on his ass, being held in place by Steve’s mouth, the hand on the back of his head; he hangs there and takes it, takes him, bounces helplessly on Steve’s dick and sucks on Steve’s tongue in lieu of his neck, which is now mottled with deep, purple bruises and livid red bite marks that will fade before the sun rises on another day.

“Ah, there’s your knight in shining armor!” Piledriver cackles, squeezing his arm harder around Steve’s neck. Steve is turning purple, scratching and kicking at the body behind him to no avail. It’s hard to get a good shot in a dark, contained space like this—a bullet might ricochet and hit Steve, or Sam, and absolutely no way in hell is he firing off a bomb down here. Tony doesn’t linger on the
“Oh, you will,” he answers, low and hot against Tony’s mouth, kissing him slow and heavy and deep like it’s an act of mercy. Tony moans into it, arching up on his elbows to meet Steve halfway, rocking back with what little leverage he can muster under Steve’s weight to grind against his cock, which he wants inside him
, Tony thinks to himself as the kettle clicks off, ready to pour. Steve’s sense of diplomacy is truly on another level, considering how this exact topic of conversation came up in the first place.
Tony slides Steve a look out of the corner of his eye, face still directed toward the screen, a classic
“Doctor says you can come home in the morning,” he says in a low voice. The lights are dim, Tony notices, and the blinds are shut. There are more ice chips on the table next to the bed, which Steve hands to him without prompting.
“Send a note to Pepper to look into this charity tomorrow—my gut tells me someone on the board is skimming off the top. If they are, I’d like us to do something about it.
“Three things,” he says matter-of-factly as he moves in closer. “First: I’m going to kiss you. Second: I’m going to tell you you’re an idiot who riled himself up for no reason. And third: I’m going to tell you I love you too.”
“Uh. Maybe?” At Steve’s look, Tony bites his lip and sighs. “Fine. Yeah, I am. Can you blame me? The thought of Sputnik wandering around the tower with that Cold War-era paperweight hanging off him when I’ve got brand-spanking-new, finely-tuned StarkTech all but ready to go? Perish, Steve,
“I didn’t come alone, though,” he replies earnestly. There’s also the distinct tone of a man insulted, like Steve resents the idea of people thinking his coming here with Tony is anything less than a date.
“Look at all of that hair! Danny Zuko’s got nothing on you, Stark,” Clint laughs. Tony nails him with a popcorn kernel right in the ear.
that is Steve stroking and grinding against Tony’s throbbing cock while wrecking suggestive havoc on Tony’s ass with his nimble fingers. There are at least eight girthy inches of heart-stopping promise cleverly concealed in those godforsaken chinos
He’s so caught up in thinking about all the ways this could backfire he doesn’t realize JARVIS has let Steve into the workshop, regardless of Tony’s feelings on the matter. The realization sets in when Steve’s voice appears close to his ear, soft and low with a frisson of urgency, like he too is slightly out of breath.
Rogers’ face tightens. “What about—” he glances down through the glass. “The others? Will they know? Will they be alright?”
, he tells himself, watching condensation streak through the remnants of steam on the mirror. This is just like any other breakup, only slightly complicated by the fact that he leads a team of superheroes with his ex, and was best friends with his ex for years before they got together, and still thinks the world of his ex, and still wants his ex, and is still madly in love with his ex.
“J-just for you, handsome,” Tony slurs, swallowing around a mouthful of drool because Steve’s cockhead keeps grazing his prostate and it’s so, so fucking good, it’s
“A lot of things of mine you haven’t seen, Cap,” he replies, too late to stop the innuendo from slipping out. He looks at Steve after he says it and almost, almost lets out a gasp: when did Steve get so close? And why is he looking at Tony like that? All intense and considering?
, and that there’s nothing stopping Steve from getting an eyeful of Tony’s scarred, brutalized chest, or the bright blue battery in the middle of it.
He can’t even finish grinning before Steve is on top of him, kissing every last trace of cold right out of Tony’s heart.
,” Tony breathes, kissing Steve because he’s close enough, because he can. Writhing against the man on top of him, Tony tilts his hips just so, feels the whole slick length of Steve slide up against his balls and swallows the shocked groan that spills out of him. “Fuck me, Steve. Please,
Maybe it’s for the best Tony never kissed him like he did the others before now, Steve thinks, and that’s the last coherent thought he has before Tony steps in impossibly closer, enough that Steve can feel his belt buckle against his sternum, and runs all ten fingers through the hair on either side of Steve’s head.
When he leans down, slowly, Steve gets to watch Tony’s beautiful eyes flicker and shut. He counts the dark lashes where they rest on Tony’s high cheekbones, breathes in his smell and listens to the shudder in his exhale before drawing him in for a kiss that draws everything else to a quiet, blissful blank.
“It’s ancient history,” Tony replies, maintaining eye contact through sheer willpower when all he wants to do is look at Steve’s mouth, now so close to his.
“And I’ve heard you talk about how convoluted the VA is when it comes to services and benefits and whatnot. I figured, my tech
Biting down a smile, Tony offers: “Gym’s on the 40th floor. Living quarters are on floors 57, 58, and 59.”
So without a single thought beyond a passing prayer for the best, Steve raises a still-wrapped hand and knocks on Tony’s door.
but something isn't right, because even as weeks, months go by, and you move into Tony's suite and fall asleep wrapped around him almost every night (except those when he's in another country, and the bed is almost as cold as the ice, or when he's consumed by some project in the workshop and loses track of time), and you tell each other "I love you" out loud multiple times, and say it without words in a million other ways, you get the feeling that Tony. doesn't. believe you?
“Very good, Captain.” At Pierce’s nod, Steve straightens, looks back with a knowing smirk, and nods in return. Rumlow would have already updated him about Steve’s words in the elevator; now the rest of it—rescuing Bucky, infiltrating SHIELD, destroying HYDRA and Pierce with it—is up to Steve.
the muscles quivering where Steve presses his lips, pressing hard before humming deep and low in his chest, a resonant sound that vibrates through Tony and makes him gasp and buck against Steve’s mouth with a choked
“It always is,” Tony murmurs, dropping a kiss to Steve’s lips to chase away the sour taste speaking that particular truth always leaves in his mouth. Steve breathes in deep and pushes up, grazing his chest against Tony’s, not even flinching at the arc reactor as it grazes his sternum, pulling Tony in closer for another deep, hard kiss that makes Tony’s head spin. Steve presses down with the hand on Tony’s back and Tony gasps, forced forward until there isn’t a speck of space between their bodies, not an inch of skin Tony can’t feel acutely. Every nerve ending is precisely attuned to Steve, the soft wet heat of his tongue—which he’d had up Tony’s ass not five minutes ago—fucking his slack mouth, the hand on his jaw moving him this way and that at Steve’s whim, the burning brand of his massive, hot swollen cock grinding ever so slightly against his own.
What the team isn’t expecting when the elevator doors open onto the communal floor that sunny Tuesday afternoon is a living room scattered with men and women in various states of modest undress, all of whom immediately pivot in place to take stock of the new arrivals. Three men, one woman, and in the middle of their protective circle is Tony, eyes blazing with the same thrill of invention he often gets in the lab, a pair of needle-nose pliers clenched in his teeth.
“I’m just saying,” Steve giggles, leaning forward to press a too-sweet kiss to the corner of Tony’s mouth, “if you’d believed me when I said it the first time, we could have done this a week ago.”
“I wouldn’t tease you about this, Tony,” Steve says quietly. No daylight between them, now. He reaches out a bare hand and wraps it around the hard, shallow curve of Tony’s waist, thousand-dollar silk smooth and giving under his fingers. “Never about this.”
to convince me to let them in.” Breathing hard now, Tony rubs the heel of one hand against his forehead. “I just want my brain to shut off and to not have to think about the real world for two fucking seconds.”
The elevator spits him out on the team floor, empty but for Vision, who’s in the communal living room reading a book, of all things. Steve doesn’t point out that Vision has the entire internet at his mind’s disposal and every book that can be found on it; he suspects that, much like he did after coming out of the ice, Vision wants to do things that root him in the same reality as everyone else around him, and reading a physical book is such a purely
The fact that he’s about to see those pretty lips wrapped around his throbbing cock in a few seconds is neither here nor there.
Steve surges up to meet Tony’s next kiss, and the next, and when Steve opens his eyes Tony’s there, smiling down at him.
Then, he looks at Steve, lit up the way a child whose parent has just given them a whole dollar to spend might be.
he’d told him once. Steve had watched Tony’s eyes glaze over and his tongue slowly slide out to lave his bottom lip, obviously salivating at the thought of some random pasta dish, and it had taken just about everything in Steve’s power not to launch himself across the kitchen counter and chase Tony’s tongue with his.
The smile that splits Tony’s freshly-shaven face is so bright it warms Steve down to his toes. When Tony walks over—barefoot—and takes the plate from Steve, he can feel Sam and Natasha watching the entire interaction with laser focus. He expects Tony’s thanks; he doesn’t expect the second cheek-kiss of the day, let alone one that lands smack-dab on the corner of his mouth.
Tony’s voice snarks. Steve bites his tongue for a second to hold off the snort threatening to escape him. The Ancient One raises an eyebrow (or lack thereof) at him with a smirk.
. Tony shackles Bulldozer with twin sets of reinforced power-dampening manacle and leaves him writhing on the floor in pain next to Thunderball before going off into the dark expanse of the old basement in search of Steve. Sam he finds on the way, locked in hand-to-hand combat with Wrecker—Tony pauses on his way to Steve to knock Sam’s opponent out with an iron hand to the back of the skull.
Suffice it to say, Tony Stark is extremely tactile in his affections. But Tony has never, not once, kissed Steve.
Sure enough, with a too-soft kiss to Tony’s shoulder, Steve switches his movements on a dime, turning those long, aching, endless thrusts short and driving and
It’s so good and so sweet, Tony could cry all over again, but after a minute of delightful, closed-mouthed kissing, he desperately wants to know what
Tony starts moving around, shuffling back and forth across the living room floor, looking for something that probably isn’t there. Steve knows when Tony is avoiding eye contact with him—it happens often enough.
He tosses the phone away and buries his face in his hands with the beginnings of a sob, a sound he chokes down like the booze he kind of wishes he still drank. He’s not proud of the thought, but the misery of truly losing Steve—and any hope of fixing what he broke between them—has opened a window to everything he’d ignored while in Malibu, sunning himself and pretending he hadn’t wounded himself beyond repair.
The entertainment “news” “reporter” says this footage was taken minutes ago on a bystander’s cellphone. Tony sinks into a chair in front of the widescreen TV, helpless to stare as he watches the 15 second clip repeat itself over and over as the airbrushed talking heads gush and gossip about Sam and Steve, two all-American good guys making up the hottest couple since sliced bread.
Tony startles and turns on his heel with a gasp to watch as Steve—glorious, beautiful, stunning, distracted, nervous, harried,
Steve makes that little huff-laugh sound again, softer this time. “Tony,” he says warmly, and so close: “I couldn’t ignore you if I tried. Hugging you now.”
As they talk, their bodies never move an inch apart; chests pressed flush against each other, Steve’s fingers splayed along the side of Tony’s neck. All of it—the proximity, the tenderness, the intimacy—feels as natural as the breathing they just did together. Ten-plus years of friendship will do that. But then, the way Steve is looking at him doesn’t really scream
, standing there in the kitchen at—Tony glances over Steve’s shoulder at the microwave—three thirty in the morning, arms full of a blushing and bewildered Tony Stark, who may or may not be hallucinating all of this.
Steve sighs for the millionth time and gives Tony a look. It must need work, because Tony just shoots it back at him tenfold.
, Steve,” Tony gasps, burying his fingers in sweaty blond hair as Steve trembles bodily, the thick muscles in his thigh quivering between Tony’s useless legs, “yes, yes,
Steve’s watched Tony kiss Thor for bringing him seconds of whatever he’s snacking on without having to ask; Tony’s kissed Clint for beating him at poker, much to Clint’s extremely vocal chagrin; after Bruce, who has been resigned to his fate since Day One, Natasha gets the most kisses out of all of them, for everything from saving Tony’s life on missions to fixing his tie before an Avengers press conference. There was Bucky just the one time, on the back of his prosthetic hand, after Tony finished soldering a plate that had come loose during a fight. Bucky didn’t say anything at the time, but Steve remembers how he wouldn’t stop staring at the place where Tony’s lips touched for hours after the fact, like he couldn’t believe anyone, let alone
He doesn’t say it, but at least Tony looks more relaxed now. Smiling, they both take a sip of champagne simultaneously.
“You gotta tell me, Steve,” he groans, watching the door slam shut behind Steve with the kind of resolute sound that usually means someone’s angry and not very,
“I was awake,” he says. It shouldn’t sting, but it does. ‘I was awake’ is a far cry from the lines Tony’s fed himself to fill the deep, aching emptiness in his heart:
“Look alive, soldier,” he barks. Rogers coughs and splutters and springs to his feet like something stung him right on the ass. As soon as he registers Steve, his copy, standing in front of him, he falls back on his heels into a fighting stance. It’s wobbly around the knees, but Steve doesn’t bother correcting his stance. This isn’t what he’s come to do.
After almost an hour, Tony apologizes for hogging the conversation and Steve can’t hold his tongue: “Maybe I like listening to my
Above him, Steve moves liquid-smooth, fucking Tony with all of that enviable stamina right there on display. With each giant hand planted on the mattress on either side of Tony’s head, Steve holds himself low over Tony’s back and groans deep in his chest, cursing when Tony’s hole squeezes around him in response to the new, deeper angle. Tony is loose and tender, moaning uncontrollably as Steve presses featherlight kisses to his temple, his cheek, the corner of his lips, never losing his rhythm the whole time, just fucking Tony with those smooth, steady, rolling thrusts (
Walking in deep shadow, Tony slowly works his way toward the front of the ballroom where a lectern has been brought out with a single microphone attached, jutting out insistently into space. The silk pennant on the front bears the name of the foundation Tony is about to plug, but the words seem to blur the closer he gets. From the dark outskirts of the busy ballroom, he watches the crowd move with and against itself—toward the food, toward the bar, toward and away from each other—and wonders, not for the first time, why he bothers coming to these events at all. No one has spoken more than a few sentences to him all night; he might as well be a particularly expensive window dressing.
Before he can pull away and apologize (again) for his behavior, Steve feels more than hears Tony sigh against his lips. Then Tony tilts his head a fraction and suddenly
The conversation devolves quickly from there, and within a couple of excitable minutes, the airmen are eager to get a look at the Avengers’ game room. They pile into the elevator, talking animatedly over each others’ heads, placing bets and picking teams as the doors close.
To Steve’s surprise, Tony doesn’t even blink when he says: “What if I told you I think about that exact scenario every time you walk into a room?”
“I heard that!” Steve calls out, emerging a moment later from the bathroom with one of Tony’s fluffy white hand towels against his face. He drops it and smiles, which would normally be enough to make Tony’s heart skip a beat—Steve really does have the most gorgeous smile, big and a little goofy, nothing at all like Tony’s plasticine fakes, thank goodness—but then it hits Tony with the force of a chest blow from the Hulk that Steve, Steve
This will do for now, though; Steve’s touching him, and he’s not running away. If anything, he seems more than happy to stay right here, in bed with Tony, touching him like he’s something precious to be cherished and kept safe. When Tony opens his eyes again, Steve is right there, smiling down at him.
Sleep is the furthest thing from Tony’s mind now, his Hammer-induced mini panic attack from earlier so far in his memory’s rearview, it’s not even a dot on the glass. This—Steve holding him, Steve looking at him, Steve wanting him,
. “Is that right?” Steve says. Tony looks—Steve’s grinning like a cat that got all the cream, eyes glinting in the low light, and he realizes with a swirl of dread amid the bone-melting
And then there’s the rest of him—Steve, standing there waiting for Tony to react, a shit-eating grin on his face if Tony ever saw one, and Tony has seen Steve’s shit-eating grin so many times over the years, but never with this heady undercurrent of promise. He’s massive even out of the suit, tall and broad, but graceful, gentle as he climbs back onto the bed and reaches for Tony; even as he watches Steve move, all that muscle and strength, he can clearly see the guy Steve used to be—that bony, sickly kid who picked every battle that was worth fighting, even if it was the neighborhood bully for stealing the neighbor’s milk money.
the one who’s been suffering under this misunderstanding. Sam comes to stand next to him, leaning against the kitchen counter, eyeing the still-cold plate of leftover lasagna in Steve’s hands.
“Not exactly,” Sam says. Then, at Tony’s what-the-fuck look, “I was just stopping down to ask your doctor if you were up and at ‘em yet, but now I don’t have to.”
Twenty minutes later, the phone buzzes under his leg. Tony’s mature enough to admit that Steve was probably in a meeting or the gym, but the thought of him pulling a petty move like “can’t reply right away, gotta wait so Tony doesn’t get the satisfaction” is highly, highly amusing.
“This isn’t about showboating how much better we’re doing,” Natasha hisses at Vision before turning her eyes back on Bruce. Her pretenses are slipping; Tony doesn’t know if she’s letting emotions through to play an angle here, or if she’s really getting heated. “This isn’t part of a press release to prove we’re normal people getting normal help.”
But Steve’s still here, sleeping in a hospital bed, and it easily could’ve been worse. It conjures images of Rhodey, breathing deep and looking at the ceiling as he tries not to panic, and of Happy, his face slack but swollen and purple—and the guilt flares to life. But that’s not quite right.
“A few options are from SHIELD,” Tony says. “Nobody touched by the Hydra doxxing, of course. Some known personally by our resident double-0’s, or other trusted sources. A couple are ex-military psychs too, people with experience handling classified information.”
"I'll drive back," Tony decides, even though he technically has places to store his cars in the city.
Tony smiles because, holy hell, yeah, this creature is definitely a mini-Lang, genuine curiosity and twinkling eyes and all.
DUM-E whirs his claw from the far side of the workshop (where he’s been wisely avoiding Tony and his jittery energy for the better part of an hour now), and starts rolling over.
nobody’s surprised him like that for days now—he used to be used to this, living in close quarters with the resident SHIELD spooks back in the day, but he supposes he’s gotten cocky with his newly heightened senses.
“I—” Tony says, stops. He really does feel emboldened being alone with Bucky, freer to speak even though he knows that’s not the case. It’s just that alone Bucky’s just Bucky, they’re just two pretty screwed up dudes awake between super-late and nobody-wakes-up-at-this-hour-voluntarily o’clock. With any of the others around, the social context between the two of them becomes unavoidable. “Just. If there’s anything you need, you know you can always ask me, or Friday, or Steve.”
"A couple of the more in-tact ones self-destructed after you left the scene,” he admits. “Heard a fed talkin’ about how useful a man named Hawkeye would be to an operation like that.”
“Shh,” Steve says, hand landing on Tony’s head, combing through his hair. “She’ll hear you and you’ll end up drinking decaf for the next month.”
“I miss you,” he says suddenly, and, by God, how he means it. “And I’m sorry. Whatever’s been happening, I’m the one who’s been absent. I’ll fix it.”
Steve maneuvered Tony until he was sitting up with firm touches, not tickling, ghosting touches, and Tony was glad he didn’t have to walk Steve through this. He didn’t have the verbal capacity for it at the moment. They ended up in Steve’s chair with Steve sitting and Tony in his lap, one knee on each side of Steve’s hips, which in any other situation would’ve been Tony’s every teenage fantasy come to life, but as it was his face was smushed into Steve’s neck, the hood pulled up protectively over his hair, his fingers in Steve’s hair, and Steve’s fingers on his back.
Tony curses. Any other arrow and he and Sam could go collect them from the ground, but the explosive arrows are a one-and-done kind of deal.
“Keeping tabs on me, old man?” he asks, but there’s no heat to it, only tiredness, and maybe the barest hint of fondness.
“Pshh,” Steve says and thinks, to hell with it. “There’s saying Captain America needs Iron Man at his back—which is true, why do you think you have the shield?—and then there’s this,” he drags the metaphorical knife a little deeper, through the muscle, “Steve Rogers to Tony Stark: my life tends to be better when you’re there.”
He hears the next people coming long before they get to the kitchen—two of them, he thinks. But he’s neck deep in setting up wireless tripwires for Ross and his minions, and he doesn’t look up until the room grows deathly still and quiet. Tony looks up and sees Clint, head still tilted down toward his phone, but eyes raised and resting on something beyond Tony’s shoulder. Tony turns around, and—oh.
“She was also the first one to come back,” Tony admits, and honestly, he’s never going to figure out the Black Widow. He thinks he finally gets how she operates, the conflicting modes of decision making she goes through, even though he can hardly predict what she’ll settle on in any given moment. The thing is: even if she’s just as likely to poison him as help him to his feet, he knows she cares, and that it hurts her to choose against him, against any of them. “She snuck back into the compound before anything was settled, before there was any emergency or threat.”
and I can’t believe the Avengers have actually been afloat for so long without any kinda framework whatsoever.
“Your two o’clock,” Clint says. Tony turns his head and sees the building. Not quite a skyscraper, but it’s a high rise and definitely has the best vantage point. Tony deposits Hawkeye and gets back to circling high. Sam steps off the back of the Quinjet finally and glides in a giant arc. He deploys Redwing, too, and the little bot takes off into the broken window of one of the closer buildings, probably checking for people.
“Hey,” Tony says in reprimand, but there’s no real edge to it, because Karen is overprotective, a little bit, but she’s better for it, “leave the girl alone. She’s just looking out for you.”
“No, no, no,” Scott’s saying. “It’s the concentration of mass that makes me stronger the smaller I get. The absolute density of my atoms jacks them up, but the Hulk—”
Tony’s thigh feels like it’s burning from the surface down by the time Wanda comes over and lifts a huge hunk of wall off their lower legs. They’re on their feet now, under their own power, and Tony’s rather impressed with himself. He’s restless and twitchy, and he wishes he could keep still, or that he could make it not hurt. He reaches a hand up to run through his hair and is met with the dull
“I don’t think so,” he says, raising his hands in an exaggerated shrug. “I am intimately familiar with guilt-as-motivator, Pep. That’s not what this is. It’s just not.”
Tony knocks on the table twice in acknowledgement. He’s the slightest bit disconcerted. He’s never had this problem with accepting drinks before, not from his team, but maybe it’s a one-time thing, like when Natasha first returned. He decides not to worry about it.
“Tony?” And Steve sounded anxious, but at least he wasn’t disappointed, and holy shit, would Tony ever stop caring about what Steve thought of him? The tablet from earlier slid off Tony’s legs, and Tony got the urge to rip his pants off, rip his skin off, muscle, down to bone, just to make it all go away because he was feeling so much. “Hey, Tony.”
Tony does kind of want to rip Steve’s hand away from his chest then. He wants to run and hide, but not as much as he longs to stay. So he sits there, very still except for how he rises and falls with Steve’s breathing. For a while, he matches their breaths, inhaling when Steve exhales, keeping himself at an even level. He wonders if it’s uncomfortable for Steve at all, to have the weight of Tony’s skull, his shoulders and spine against his torso, holding him down.
“Oh, my God,” Tony says. He’s going to protect this man until his dying breath. “I just got this new heart, green bean, you can’t ruin it like this.”
“I’m not trying to—this isn’t some sort of designed punishment,” Tony says, and it comes out stern, almost confident.
“In other words,” Tony says more boldly, “I’m an entire asshole, and an especially manipulative one at that.”
“Oh,” Pepper says, and she sounds genuinely surprised. Even at the height of their relationship, there are certain things they failed at. Problem solving being chief among them.
“I wanna be,” he says. He’s not looking Tony in the eyes and that, more than anything, convinces Tony that he’s being sincere. Steve’s almost as shit at emotions as Tony himself. “We were, for a while there. Or we were on our way. And.” Steve leans a hand on the counter and his eyes flicker to Tony. “I miss it—you. I miss you being around.”
Tony’s not entirely sure and, to be perfectly honest, Bruce probably knows better at this point. But Bruce is pissed and so obviously above Tony and his petty grievances. (Bruce doesn’t have the whole story, Tony knows, or he’s just hurt by Tony’s involvement with Secretary Ross, and Bruce should be allowed to get emotional about things that hurt him, but damn if it doesn’t sting Tony too; he thought, out of all of them, that Bruce was really his friend.)
Since becoming an Avenger, Wanda’s gotten her driver’s license and taken a defensive driving course, and she knows how to land the Quinjet in case of an emergency (because that’s one of the first things they teach newbies), but apparently nobody’s taken the time yet to actually teach her how to fly one of those things.
He’s looking at his reflection in the mirror, shirtless still, only a towel around his hips because he’s still not cold, eyes locked on his own face and avoiding his torso, and he’s twirling the scissors idly. Even without looking for his missing scars, there’s plenty odd about the picture. His gray hair is gone, the near permanent bruises underneath his eyes have vanished too. It’ll take some getting used to, that’s for sure. And his wrinkles, his face looks downright alien with his skin smoothed out like that. He rotates his left wrist, which has been aching almost constantly since the Accords, and it doesn’t hurt, so at least Extremis was good for something.
Tony keeps his eyes on the hologram in front of him, still making notes, but he can feel Steve’s eye roll all the same.
“Sometimes," he says quietly, “I feel like the butt of the biggest joke in the world. I’m just—” his lips quirk and it feels cruel and honest and unfair to put this burden on Steve but fair he should have to know if this is how Tony feels anyway, “—so convenient to have around. Any World War II master strategist worth his salt would know when to put me in my place, when to beat the shit out of me in a Siberian bunker, when to disappear for months and months while I dealt with the angry bureaucrats and the 12-hour hearings and the public scorn, and when to play nice and bat their eyelashes and get me to build their buddy a new arm.
He starts to cut apart another piece of tortellini, slitting it length-wise and separating the cheese inside. It takes only a couple of minutes of staring at it from the corner of his eye and shifting it around before he scoops it all onto his fork and puts the bite into his mouth. It’s cold by then, but still tasty.
Briefly, he considers bolting. It would be the easiest thing to do. But he promised he’d give it time, that he’d stick around and see what happens. Moreover, he doesn’t want to leave. Terrified as he is, he’s content in this moment; all his fear revolves around what might happen, or what Steve will do when he wakes.
Tony takes a moment to consider it, but really, he knows the answer. He’s not exceptional company right now, but having Steve here makes him feel less like he’s brooding and more like he really is just taking a minute.
He doesn't want to know if Barnes is being shipped back the States, or what treatments, if any, he chooses to try first, or if he decides to retire quietly on a diary farm in Wyoming. Sadly, the luxury of ignorance isn’t something Tony’s granted often, and this is no exception. Tony will count his blessings when they come, though, and thankfully all the information on Bucky comes from T’Challa in that calm, respectful tone, and not a peep comes from Rogers on the subject. Tony simultaneously wants the recognition, because he knows Steve knows this is hard for him, and also that he knows how much work Tony personally put into this outcome. At the same time, he logically knows that if Steve decided to say something, Tony wouldn’t be able to handle it, not yet. But that’s besides the point.
“There something on my face?” Steve says. He finishes balling up the wrapper for his second energy bar and cuts his gaze to Bucky. Sadly, Bucky doesn’t play along.
“That’s enough, I think,” Tony says. “Listen, Wilson, I said something to Steve when he was here, and I said it in a way probably not conducive to any real progress—”
“I’m always right,” Bruce mumbles around a pen from where he’s hunched over a sample of something-or-another on a glass slide. He’s literally just sitting there, poking it. Wet sciences fascinate Tony.
Tony breaks his newfound routine that night and finishes the lighter weight struts for Rhodey’s legs. He mails them out the next morning with an apology note. Rhodes is an aerospace engineer, he literally has the qualifications of a rocket scientist, and he can screw the new struts into place himself.
One of their major issues, Tony’s found, was that Steve takes everything at face value, takes all of Tony’s words to heart, and Tony sees subtext that isn’t always there.
“Here,” Steve said from above him, around him, his voice almost echoing. Tony realized that Steve was standing by the arm of the couch and that he was putting a plate of Indian food right by his elbow, right under his nose, right in his face.
“How did you choose these ones?” he asks and, okay, Bucky’s last session with an unknown therapist didn’t go exactly according to plan for anyone except Zemo. Tony’s throat loosens and he becomes just aware enough to feel the sweat dripping down his back, glad he’s in a suit dark enough to hide his sweat.
And, God—no, Tony doesn’t want FRIDAY to call anyone. He doesn’t need anyone to see him like this, he doesn’t want anyone to see him like this. Half the team thinks he’s too unstable to be an Avenger anyway, and the other half would probably think he was attention seeking and—why is he so happy to have them back, anyway? If this is how they see him, and how he has to work around them?
Tony rolls his eyes because, really, they both know that’s not going to last. When it comes down to it, Bruce is just as bad of a workaholic as Tony, and he gets just as little sleep (at least pre-Extremis). Ever since he first came to crash at the tower, Bruce has had the tendency to act like it might be his last time allowed in a lab even though Tony's made it a point to gift the space and funding to Bruce to do with as he sees fit. Unless Bruce can suddenly go twelve hours without coffee or tea or some form of caffeine, this rule’s doomed to fail.
He doesn’t have to look to know Steve’s frowning at him. He looks anyway and—yep, right there. Steve’s given up pretending to watch the road, and he’s looking at Tony like he’s trying to parse his words.
Tony stays for the next few hours. Bruce explains his current experiments—all seven of them, dear God—and Tony alternates between conducive brainstorming and being an absolute nuisance to the very idea of science. Bruce tolerates it for a surprisingly long time, which is more of a testament to how he feels about Tony’s decisions of late than any conversation ever could be.
“What’s up?” Steve asks. He’s watching more carefully now, with tight eyes. Tony just shakes his head sharply, once, twice, and then stops abruptly when it makes his nausea spike.
“Well,” Steve says, and he crosses his arms. His tone isn’t outright mean, but it’s not too close to being gentle either. Trust Steve to never shrink away from a challenge. “I don’t see why not.”
The others get to drink, no problem, Tony thinks petulantly. He knows it’s childish, and he’s mad at himself for ruining his own good mood even as it plummets. He’s also, if he’s being honest with himself, a little pissed at everyone else too, flaunting their alcohol like that.
“The Brood has a standing treaty with Asgard, apparently,” Vision says. “Neither party seems overly eager to breach it.”
Steve’s gotten out a knife and a bowl to go with the cutting board, but he’s just staring at them on the counter now. Tony turns his back to get a mug and the sugar down from the cabinet.
“By next year,” Steve says. “There’ll be an emergency eventually. They’ll need us all, and we’ll show up. And then we’ll deal with all the legal stuff, but this isn’t forever.”
“I can’t do this,” Steve says again, emphatically. He steps away from Tony then, flails his arms out and gestures at the space around them. Tony spins to face him and narrows his eyes. When he speaks, it’s with an attempt at lightheartedness and a reminder that matching Steve’s tone is rarely helpful.
“You did do what was best,” Steve says, talking over him. Tony’s so shocked by the fact that Steve’s agreeing with him, he shuts right up. “For the mission objective, there wasn’t any decision you could’ve made that would’ve been more tactically sound. You were right, and the Extremis saved your life. None of the doctors would’ve been able to do that.”
It is horrendously, exceptionally bright in this room. Tony blinks, scrunches his nose up again because it makes his eyes water, and blinks some more. He rolls his head to the other side and, holy shit, that really is Bruce, not Tony’s imagination, Bruce is right in front of him.
Steve still thinks he’s losing Tony, that Tony’s trying to leave his life for good because Tony hasn’t said or done anything to contradict that theory. And since he’s realized it, he’s only become more and more acutely aware of how he just doesn’t know anything else about what’s going on in Steve’s life. He supposes Steve’s been at the compound this entire time, but what he’s doing is anyone’s guess. Training Wanda? Keeping busy? Being upset? The only thing Tony knows for certain is that Steve’s emailed their lawyers a couple times about the amendment proceedings, and he only knows that because Steve’s cc-ing him.
And Tony doesn’t have an answer but he doesn’t think one exists, so he’s trying to just not obsess over it.
“We’re gonna be okay,” Tony tells him, lies to him, because it’s a nice lie, and Steve did it earlier. Tony doesn’t know when that became something they do, lying to each other to make them feel better. It’s nice though. He wants to keep it, this thing between them.
Tony busts in through a wall on the third floor after a scan reveals no lifeforms on that level and he flies down the stairwell. It doesn’t take him long to find Wanda, in what looks like a destroyed office, red energy holding the
He looks up to see Steve watching him from the other side of the island, mug in hand and a smile on his lips that tells Tony he’s not fooled at all, but that’s probably okay because Steve himself looks absolutely dopey with that expression. Tony lets himself smile back because who else is going to see? Bruce is out like a light.
He can’t lie here, and he doesn’t want to, at least not to himself. They haven’t spoken about it yet, or changed anything too drastically—nothing they couldn’t come back from, at least. Plausible deniability is still tenuously in place. It’s also a joke, for sure, but there nonetheless.
“Yeah, duh,” he says. “I remember that. Gimme the where and the when, I’ll bring the will and the way.”
It’s easy to admit this to himself as he lays in Steve’s bed, the both of them covered in a clean darkness. He can feel Steve’s warmth this way, knows that this must be the warm Steve here with him, though he feels more like a small forest fire when the stimulus is limited like this.
“We’ll see,” he says, even though he knows she’s right. If they end up giving away reactors it should be to people or cities who can’t afford it. (See? He knows how running a company works.)
“Next version?” Tony says. “Oh, damn, nobody told you. This is it, sour patch. Final product, no refunds.”
“I never said you should,” Tony says evenly. Wanda seems to shrink in on herself even as she sits up straighter, and Tony feels a little bad about that, but not bad enough to take it back. He turns back to Clint. “You can take a Quinjet tomorrow. Until then, they’re all locked down. FRIDAY?”
Happy has Peter on his way to Illinois, too, but he’s on standby only until they figure out what kind of threat this is. T’Challa’s aware of what’s happening, and he’s on his way, but even in one of his jets it’ll take hours.
Eventually, the steady updates from Natasha stop. She informs them that the portal has been found, and they’re about to go through and then—nothing. The signal must not be able to travel like that. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything, but it’s not ideal for either group.
They continue as they have been, but the chain reaction seems to have started. Tony’s fingertips tingle, and he smiles at a man in a three-piece. His jaw clenches, unclenches, clenches, and he loses his half-empty glass on a passing tray. He can’t get enough air, but Sam says something in a tone that suggests a joke, so he laughs because he knows, Tony knows it’s not real—he can breathe, even if he feels like he can’t. It’s just too bad that knowing the difference doesn’t actually help in any practical way.
“Tony,” Wanda says. This might be the first time she’s called him by his given name, this horror show must really be bringing them closer together. It makes Tony hate himself all the more for what he has to ask.
“But then you were….then I decided I didn’t care if we were getting along. No, I mean—I care, obviously, or I wouldn’t be going to so much trouble.” Tony raises an eyebrow at Steve, but doesn’t jump in right away to save him. “Not that you’re—” He huffs out a sigh and looks skyward like he’s praying for divine intervention. “I do care. We work better when we’re on the same side, and it’s been…emptier here without you around, but I could deal with that as long as I knew your were alive and well somewhere.”
Tony turns just in time to see Steve smack into a tree, back first, head hitting the bark with a dull
The thing hisses again and wrenches its torso around. Tony’s arm flares in response, red-hot under the armor in a way he’s come to associate with blood. He grits his teeth. His hands are still holding firm on the back of its head, but he manages to angle his shoulder enough to fire a small laser at the thing’s tentacle of an arm where it’s wrapped around his bad arm. Its grip tightens at the sudden, unexpected pain, but the other tentacle loosens and starts blindly groping for the laser. It’s just enough for Tony to get his good arm free, and he put his palm against the unarmored, squishy tissue of the tentacle and fires a rupulsor. It goes through parts of the human arm still hanging on to the larger alien. Tony knows there’s no way he can smell anything through the suit’s filters, knows he must be imagining the burnt skin smell, but he suppresses a gag anyway. He flips the transmission off on his comm so he can hear everyone but they can’t hear him.
All in all, it’s a sensible list. It was probably a good thing that Steve sat with the lawyers first, so that someone other than Tony could explain why they can’t do certain things and why certain restrictions have to be in place. They even seem to have made Steve understand the ‘sign now, amend later’ part of the process, which Tony should really give them all raises for. He tells himself that it’s good they’re on the same page now, at least, even as part of him sets up a pity-party in a not-so-far-off corner of his mind, asking why Steve couldn’t have just asked Tony about this from the start, why Steve always assumes that Tony’s just trying to piss him off.
“I did,” Tony mutters, leaning back so he can fish his phone out of his jeans pocket. And he did, or FRIDAY should’ve done it for him. An automatic Priority Alerts Only setting for when it’s movie night, or he’s in a meeting, or anywhere he’ll get in trouble for it.
“Of course not,” she says. “We are exemplary teammates and Vis has been teaching me how to fly the ‘jet.”
SHIELD doesn’t exist anymore, per se, though the FBI snatched up a great many ex-agents when the organization dissolved. Basically, SHIELD has become a subdivision in the FBI, and—by some divine form of punishment—is even more annoying for it.
They even manage to surprise Natasha, which Tony will freely admit delights him to no end. She stops half a step out of the elevator, frozen and taking in the scene. And then she laughs, surprised and real, and it sounds weirdly like a dog’s bark before she claps a hand over her own mouth, stopping it. Her eyes are crinkled and happy when she meets Tony’s gaze, though, and he remembers their mornings before everyone else came back. Breakfasts together, stilted and suspicious. He feels a swell of gratitude for them—for her—all the same. He loves her, always has, and he understands parts of her he thinks the others have a hard time grasping. She’s seen him at his lowest points, during the palladium and after the Accords, seen him bleeding in just about every way, and he’s seen through her, called her out, seen the thing at the core of her she thinks is ugly and ruthless but necessary, and he knows what it really is: strong and empathetic and not at all necessary but extraordinary. She tries so hard to do the right thing, to keep the peace, to minimize the damage—even when people would like her more if she didn’t, even when she hurts herself and the relationships she’s cultivated. No matter what else has happened between them, he respects that about her. She really did agree with Tony, he thinks, and she didn’t go with Steve because she necessarily wanted to, but because that was where she was needed most. She didn’t come back because she wanted to face Tony’s coldness and the rest of the consequences, but because someone had to take the first step if they were going to reconcile (which they had to, for the sake of the world). She’s very exceptionally talented at setting her ego aside to get the job done, but this—this breakfast, in this room, in this building, all of them together, this isn’t necessary at all. It feels like a blessing.
This is, thankfully, one thing Tony’s been thinking about for a little while now. He’s glad they’re facing the same direction so all Tony has to think about are his words and the tone he uses.
“They’re liable to fly off the handle,” Sam concedes. “Possible, though I really did expect more...hierarchy.”
Tony’s breath does a funny thing on the other end of the line, and Steve wants to cry all over again, but he feels too tired. It’s the quiet resignation of bleeding in front of another human being.
He flips the comm off again and concentrates on weaving through the trees. The sound of one falling behind him thunders through Central Park, and he makes a mental note to help them plant some new ones.
While Extremis fixed Tony's circulation problems, his skin doesn’t run that much hotter than a baseline human that he’s noticed. Steve, on the other hand, is naturally a few degrees warmer than most health professionals are comfortable with. It’s ridiculously pleasant.
“Hi, Boss,” Happy says back as Steve sets his book facedown on the arm of the couch to hold his place, making his way over.
“And Tony?” Steve said, pivoting in the doorway and leaning against the frame. Tony looked up, quirked an eyebrow. “Next time you’re feeling on edge and I demand you come upstairs for bonding time, just tell me, you stubborn fool.” But he was smiling, so Tony grinned too. The strange moment had passed and it didn’t bring the world crashing down around them. All it did was supercharge Steve’s words, his care, his teasing affection.
He knows he has responsibilities, but he finally feels like he can breathe. That’s what he told Steve he’s out here to do, and he meant it. Even if he’s still up-to-date and working on projects for everyone else, he’s not in a state of constant performance. This is the most freedom he’s ever had. He just doesn’t want it to end.
“The rest of the plan is just to wait, I’m afraid,” Steve says, though he doesn’t sound apologetic in the least. “Patience and exposure.”
Bruce is suddenly in front of Steve, and he didn’t notice when that happened. One second Steve’s thinking about the broken beer bottle and the next Bruce’s hair is inches away because Steve's taller and Bruce is looking down. Steve’s face feels like it’s flaming hot right on the surface, and his hearing has tunneled out. He's leaning back again, which is starting to hurt his back more, and Bruce’s thumb is pressed to Steve’s exposed wrist.
The conversation flows easily, and Tony eats slowly, in the pauses between conversations. If it’s early in New York, it’s practically the middle of the night on the West Coast. Tony asks about it when Cassie hangs up, and Scott shrugs and says something about nightmares. Scott downs two more cups of coffee in rapid succession and declares he’s going back to bed.
“Black Widow,” Natasha says. “I’m able to stay if needed, but I would prefer to accompany back to the compound.”
“Technically, yes, that’s all I called for,” Steve says in a rush. “But now I’m trying to say something else so please don’t hang up.”
at that, like he does every time—like he did every time before. Tony’s stomach twists, two parts bitter and one part sweet.
When Steve pulls away, just barely, it’s with the thumb of his other hand gently keeping Tony’s chin in place, contrasting the hot hand still on the back of Tony’s head.
“I was afraid,” Tony admits quietly. The movie drones on in the background, Amy Adams’ marriage dissolving around her, lights splashing against Tony’s eyelids. The paintings in the movie, the children with their wide eyes, they remind him of kids whose lives he’s ruined all over the world, children like Wanda and Pietro and countless others.
Steve looks thoughtful as he reaches up to cover Tony’s hands with his own. Less sad, and Tony will take that as a win.
“Aw, crikey,” Tony says. Rhodey looks at him with that superior smile that says ‘I understand people and social situations better than Tony Stark!’ and Tony rolls his eyes. Like that’s something
What it ends up being is more writhing than sex. They quip, and sigh, and toss thinly veiled compliments at each other. Their clothes don’t even come off all the way, but Tony comes while he’s giggling, which he can safely say he’s never done—sober—before.
The point is that Barnes decides he will come to America, to New York, to the Avengers compound. Barnes has decided that the BARF tech might help him in the future, but it’s too soon for him to try that yet (Tony grudgingly agrees with him). He’s starting with sit-down-and-talk therapy, and Tony has to admit he’s rather impressed by that choice. Stupidly, Tony hopes this is the final push that convinces Steve to get his own shrink.
“It is! I never saw him care about you until after Chicago.” She takes a deep breath and is a more appropriate volume when she speaks again. “Do you remember what you looked like when they brought you back to the states? After he
“Jesus Christ,” Bruce says. His coffee mug has been firmly set aside, and he lowers his face into his hands briefly.
He tries everything he can think of: lavender essential oils on his pillow, FRIDAY playing ocean sounds, getting buck-ass nude underneath the softest sheets money can buy.

The logical part of Tony’s brain is busy being proud of himself, for listening to his gut and knowing he wasn’t ready before, and for having enough respect for himself to be honest about that.
He flips the lid of the box open and starts eating a slice right there in the doorway. It’s absolutely shocking, then, when he realizes how much he wants a drink. He’s craving one, content and full of camaraderie.

He seems relieved, the muscles around his eyebrows not drawn so tight anymore, his fingers uncurled—not all the way, just enough to go from gripping the arms of his chair to just resting his arms there—and his chin even lifts from where it was starting to tuck down toward his chest.

Thor calls the aliens the Brood, and he talks about them as if they’re pests. According to him, the only way to stop this attack is to either kill every single alien present or to find the queen and either kill her or force her to order them to stand down.

He’s got FRIDAY fully installed but not uploaded yet. All he has to do is flip a switch and she’ll be live, in his private space again. To keep him on an even keel, to hold him accountable.
