"We play pranks here now punk?" Bucky asked, tongue poking between his teeth like he was trying to scrape the taste away. Steve was laughing, taking a bite of it and shaking his head right alongside his boyfriend, and Tony's jaw was hanging open because it couldn't be that bad. "Where'd ya get this one, the dumpster?"
"He's... waiting for Bucky," Tony suggested. "Buck's parking the car." It wasn't like Rhodey had asked, or like Rhodey really cared to ask (not that Rhodes didn't care about their customers, but he wasn't as attached to these two as Tony tried not to be) and they both knew that Tony was saying it out loud for himself. He waited a solid minute, just staring ahead at Steve even as the man continued to look down the street, stock still.
"Hurts," Tony finally grunted, voice a thin rasp and once more Natasha's eyes were rolling. Oh boy. This was the last time she was helping Steve find Tony.
When Steve woke up to an empty bed.. His heart fell. For a moment, he was hopeful, but a quick run through of the apartment and he found no Tony. And maybe that was what he should have expected. Over the last few months, he'd come to know Tony pretty well. He might even be ridiculous enough to say he was falling for Tony, but he'd known from the moment he read that letter that Tony was not a relationship kind of guy. Still, he'd thought Tony had more respect for him than this.. that the man would at least talk to him about it. Explain that he couldn't settle down. It wouldn't have made leaving the apartment any easier, but at least he would have left with some dignity.
Steve would later admit that his favorite part of the night was getting a full view of Tony’s entire body reacting, his jaw going slack and his eyes rolling slightly as he lined up and thrust himself into that familiar slick warmth.
"For me to be able to yell at you again?" Tony replied. "Well you're a little strange with your kinks, I'll give you that-"
Tony let all of these thoughts consume him and before he knew it, he was sitting in the parking lot of the bar and gripping the steering wheel. This was no big deal. It was just hanging out with Steve. And Rhodey and Clint. And.. Steve's friends.
He fell silent, suddenly listening to shouts from upstairs. Steve listened, too. It was definitely a feminine voice, and the stomping sounded like heels. Steve fixed Tony with a wary look. Tony rewarded him with a nervous smile. After a moment of thought Steve sighed and shrugged.
There weren't words. Not ones that Tony could figure out. He lifted up onto his elbow, shaky and exhausted, and leaned down to press a tender kiss to Steve's lips. The answering smile he got was worth the effort, and Tony collapsed onto Steve's chest for some much needed sleep. They could.. talk in the morning.
Silence, brought on by a forceful kiss from Steve. Tony groaned into it, pressing his still cloth-protected erection into Steve’s leg. Dammit. Steve was just as hard, and it thrilled Tony to no end to realize that Steve genuinely wanted to explore this kink with him.
"Are you five?" Tony wanted to know as he jogged over, crouching down next to Steve to admire his work. It was a pretty sad castle, actually. Tony didn't say that though.
"I will talk as loud as I damn well please Rogers, and if you're here to take me out of the lab you can forget it! I've got too much to do, so you'll have to make do with your hand tonight or something. I am not about to just drop everything because you've decided to grace our home with your presence you big, stupid-" Okay, and his throat was actually starting to get sore now, so he threw his hands up and just gestured to Steve. Big stupid you.
This had become like a strange little game, if Steve was being honest. Each time he came home there was a prize of sorts for letting his neighbor use his home without calling the police. First the new door handle, then some fancy pens (Steve had to assume it was because he kept using the ones laying on the coffee table) and a toaster. Which was great, since his didn't work. Normally Steve might be a bit put off by how many one night stands the stranger had, but he was so amused by it all that he didn't really care. Now he was eager to run into A. E. Stark.
Harley, his oldest at 14 years and an Alpha, was already as snarky and clever as his Mom. Additionally him being the only Alpha in their small family, not counting Rhodey, Pepper or the Avengers that is, the teen was pretty protective of both Tony and Peter, but mostly Peter since Harley was aware of Tony’s skills at self-defense due to him having survived as an Omega in a business world full of Alphas for years now and, of course, of him being Iron Man. Still. If it came to his younger brother Harley has always been extra protective and Tony, as an Omega parent, was preening at their close relationship. Even though the small Alpha liked to play tough he was secretly a cuddle bear at heart, always searching out contact to his Omega parent and scenting his family happily with a wide grin plastered on his face. Nevertheless no one wanted to get on Harley’s bad side, at least a few of the other Avengers could agree, since the young Alpha was capable of being a salty, vengeful little shit.
Steve blinked before opening his mouth again, now sitting down in front of Tony. “But you’re in heat,” he stated simply.
Pepper was casually sitting in an armchair across the room, Stark Pad placed in her hands she was clearly concentrating on some company related issues, the all strong, respectable business aura engulfing the female Alpha. No one dared interrupt her when she was like that, not even Tony himself, way to thankful for having Pepper in his life and managing the company nearly all by herself. She was a force to be reckoned with and Tony loved her like that.
“I can only speak for myself but I thought we’d actually fit well together. We’ve been friends for years now, even though we had a bad start, and then we spent your heat together which just-just felt so right”, he continued with face full of honesty. “Every time I see you my inner Alpha feels like howling, wanting to cover you in my scent so no one can doubt that you belong to me, that you’re my Omega. Your heat just intensified those instincts which is why I can’t ignore them anymore.”
And wow. His pups couldn’t stop surprising him, could they? Tony smiled at the words, touched that his son was so considerate to actually try to build something from one of Tony’s favourite movies just to make him happy. He really had the perfect family.
“Meet me in the common room in half an hour and I’ll have breakfast ready”, the blond smiled sweetly at the Omega, a content rumble being carried across the room reaching Tony.
Being fed up as it was Tony didn’t hesitate one second as he slapped the Alpha’s back of the head with a firm, reminding blow. “I have two pups, stop being the third, Steven”, Tony finished with a glare and pulled away from the man.
“Don’t worry, you’ll do great! Trust me, the project will be amazing,” Peter tried to reassure the Alpha and let out an encouraging purr in the process, the typical behaviour of an Omega trying to soothe an Alpha. “And remember: YOU OWE ME,” he finished with a whine and started tugging at his arm to get him to move.
Not wanting to tell his Dad, because, well, he’s Tony Stark, someone who’d call his teachers explaining for over one hour why his son deserved better. Peter just couldn’t risk it.
The Alpha chuckled softly and gripped Tony’s ass tighter while shoving the door close with his left foot. Another moan reached his ear and according to his wet T-shirt the man in his arms was dripping with arousal, the scent of slick flooding his nostrils. The sweetest smell Steve could imagine.
“Mom? Is Harley alright?”, Peter asked carefully and stepped closer slowly, the need to make sure his older brother was alright overpowering him completely.
That damn Alpha. What the hell were the two hiding?! “I DEMAND TO KNOW WHAT THE EVER LOVING FUCK YOU TWO ARE PLANNING!!”, Tony screeched angrily and pouted at the silence he was presented with.
The pup looked at his brother once again with worry filled eyes, his older brother, his Alpha brother. He never really got sick, it was rather unusual for Harley to catch something, so why now? The whole thing didn’t seem right.
It was already half past midnight and Tony just wanted to go to sleep, cuddle with his boyfriend, at ease knowing his child is peacefully sleeping in the next room over. Call him old, but he truly had no energy left for this.
“Today I’m going to tell you a bit about the years between 1929 and 1939 in the United States of America, their fundamental aspects, the struggles and issues,” Peter started the presentation with a eager eyes and then gestured to Steve who was still taking in the whole scene and the plenty looks of admiration thrown his way. “At the end of my presentation a real witness of the decade, Mr. Steven Grant Rogers aka Captain America, will be talking about his personal experiences and answering a few questions.”
“What the actual fuck are you two thinking you’re doing?!”, the Omega yelled with furrowed brows and a frown on his face, signaling his anger clearly.
“You know, considering one of you is a Super Soldier with enhanced hearing and the other has an AI that could alarm him at any notice, you’re both terrible at keeping watch of your surroundings.’’, Natasha’s smooth voice cut through their steamy moment, like one of the knives she used during combat. “Maybe you should rethink your career choices.”
Harley was an Alpha just like Steve. Alphas rarely got sick due to their immune system being above an average one, something to do with and overdrive of hormones and their metabolism. Well, of course they could still get sick like everyone else and catch any disease like the other dynamics, but the simple things like a common cold, now that was something their bodies were close to immune to.
“What the? Steve you haven’t cum yet!”, Tony exclaimed with a raised eyebrow. The Alpha was so into it, so what happened?
Grasping the small bag tighter, Steve was now already halfway across the room, now emitting deep purrs in hopes of calming the nervous looking Omega a bit. Why couldn’t he see how serious he was being?
Meanwhile the other man retreated from his lover’s mouth and started trailing small kisses down his neck, which Tony arched into so beautifully, so what else could the blond do than take and take, as much as Tony was willing to give.
The Omega took in the state of the Alpha in front of him with curiosity, such an unlikely act for someone as stealthy as Steve Rogers, the whole being nervous part. Though, truthfully, Steve has tended to being more anxious those past two weeks and if Tony were to be more self assured he would have guessed he himself must have been one reason for it.
The genius complied naturally and stretched his wrist out with a slow sigh. As Steve tightened the bracelet around his small wrists the Omega’s mind swooned with want, the light touch of the man spurring on his inner want.
Thankfully the screen, touch pen, or whatever Steve tipped the numbers into turned green soon after and the voice of Jarvis announced the glass door opening with success.
Steve’s purring intensified at the mere sight of the winking Omega hole. The hole his cock will soon feel around itself. He let out a moan at the thought. Tony was going to be the end of him.
“it’s the code to enter mom’s lab.”, Peter concluded with a grin. “He’s always by himself on Thursday afternoons, so don’t mess it up this time.”
The man in question walked back into the living room a few minutes later, an easy smile on his face as he saw his boyfriend sitting cross legged on the big couch, fiddling with his phone.
A few minutes later Steve’s trusts got more sloppy as the base of his cock kept swelling more and more, catching on the rim of the hole a few times. The Alpha sped up his strokes, making the mess of an Omega moan out once again.
“Now if you ever disrespect an Omega again, if you ever target Peter Stark or any other person again I will make sure it’s going to be the last time, understood?”
Tony, clearly not satisfied with the non existing response walked up to the boy carefully and to his horror he didn’t even notice. “Peter have you been awake the whole night?”, he placed a hand on the small boy’s shoulder and shook him ever so slowly.
The sudden loud voice startled the Omega and he dropped the shirt in a heap of surprise and shock. Whirling around the genius came face to face with one of his oldest friends, Pepper Potts, the female Alpha who managed the lot of Stark Industries like a second nature and somehow still got enough time to deal with Tony’s personal shit.
Soon both reached Peter’s homeroom after whispers followed them wherever they went, now rumors already probably spreading around the school in a flash. The second ring of the bell went off just as Peter and Steve sat down at a table in the back with stares, of course, wordlessly gazing at them surprised. Peter’s phone was also constantly vibrating, texts from Ned surely being the cause.
The growl that escaped Steve instinctively didn’t even faze the Omega a bit as he continued eating the baked good, Tony’s courting gift, with absolute delight.
“Get your clothes off, Omega”, Steve ordered with another growl, already working on loosening the buckle of his own pants, not wanting to wait any longer to feel the blissful skin skin on skin contact to match their mixing pheromones in the air.
Yet, when the food arrived and Steve happily asked the Omega if he wanted to try his meal Tony was brought back to reality.
“I. Do. Not. Snore”, Tony hissed and god, did he wish he could glare at the blond right now, but due to their position it was impossible. “Why can’t you mindlessly look at your phone like everyone else does after waking up?”
The thing was even though Steve was the official group leader and thus the head Alpha of them all, it was a different relation with Thor. Since the god wasn’t from earth his behaviour differed greatly in comparison to the other Alphas on the team when facing the soldier. Normally any Alpha ranged beneath Captain America would submit, acknowledge their hierarchy and back down as not to spur the blond on, to avert a challenging fight.
He could spot his trembling hands from afar and god the scent, the hurt and anxiety ridden smell made the Alpha dizzy and rung his alarm bells. The pup, his Omega’s pup was hurting, was harassed at school and probably only a few minutes away from having a full on panic attack.
Walking closer to the Omega, not listening for a second to the genius’ protest, Steve came to a stop right in front of the machine. And like that, a huge amount of pheromones hit him, setting a growl free from his throat, cock pulsing in his pants.
The growls, snarls and pheromones were already hard for Tony to bear but for an Omega pup it was impossible, not having learned how to generate his own contributing instincts triggered by an Alpha yet.
As the movie kept on running the Alpha beside Tony started smelling something off. Looking across the room the pack leader didn’t notice anything unusual, just a few already sleeping Avengers, some watching the movie lazily cuddled up and, well Tony petting Harley. Nothing out of the ordinary if you asked the man.
The Omega sighed deeply while fidgeting with his hands in his lap, the nervousness getting to him, the fact that he finally spoke out loud what was the issue. That he finally confronted the confused Alpha. He should have done it sooner, he blamed himself internally, if he hadn’t agreed on this damn forsaken date everything would have been easier.
Peter waved lightly and smiled in return. “Thank you! Good luck on your art project!” The sarcastic middle finger he received only made him laugh.
The Omega couldn’t believe Steve was able to create something like this. He was truly stunned, speechless and so utterly close to presenting his neck wholeheartedly, instincts demanding for him to mate the Alpha right her and now.
His heart yearned innerly at the thought of snuggling his pups and just caring for them, taking in the scent of family and content pups.
Nonetheless the students only laughed lightly at the photo and promptly began to raise their hands excitedly, everyone having a question for the Captain and at the corner of his eyes Peter could even spot Mr.Johnson holding up his hand lightly.
“So yeah, basically he yelled at me to get rid of it, that a child would ruin his oncoming career. He didn’t want to do anything with it and kept blaming me for not taking birth control like ‘every Omega should be on at all times’. His words not mine”, Tony said with a shrug.
“I’m happy right now, very happy. And truly internet, non pickled food and the sweet thought of equal rights, that’s something I wouldn’t want to give up,” he finished with a laugh making the class join at the comment.
“HARLEY!”, Tony exclaimed as he let his cutlery fall onto his plate with a loud clinking noise. “That’s enough, young man”, the pissed of scent coming from the Omega took affect quickly and made the pup wince apologetic.
Wait what?! Peter’s face turned white and his head started spinning. Tomorrow was the deadline, his assignment, his grade! He still wasn’t close to being done, damn it.
“I used the code”, the taller man admitted easily with a shrug and before Tony could open his mouth to ask any questions the Alpha stretched out his palm, opening it and revealing a small black satin bag.
Though his Omega acted on his command with no hesitation and rather scrambled around on his front out of sheer horniness and desperation.
With that Tony got back to lowering his head down the thick Alpha girth, getting lost in the sensation of being finger fucked and close to the edge.
“Steve, fuck, I’m sorry for Harley’s behaviour”, Tony admitted all of sudden. “But that doesn’t excuse your reaction either! He’s a young pup and you should have-”
The teen relaxed into his father’s grasp and closed his eyes tiredly. Shit, he really had overdone it last night. Exhaustion was pulling at his very core and the warmth of his Dad was slowly, but surely pulling him into a deep slumber.
He came face to face with Jason, one of his classmate and his goons. A group that consisted only of Alpha boys, who had an obvious superiority complex and loved targeting Peter for his Omega status and his background. Though, they only messed with him when his brother wasn’t around, too afraid of the impulsive Alpha Stark at their school.
Steve cleared his throat awkwardly, feeling the presence of the Omega beside him, affecting him strongly with the thickening sweet pheromones in the close space. The sweet, sweet smell Steve was able to smell once before. Innerly he growled wanting to just claim, take and possess. The Omega was so easily getting to him.
Tony pulled back, and this time he was red for a different reason. He'd never really.. talked about this with Steve. He didn't exactly bring it up a lot. "I uh.. I wasn't always a vacuum inventor," he admitted softly. "My dad's company- when it was his company- made weapons. I wanted a piece of the action, or rather the money, so I was a part of it. While demonstrating some new stuff out of the states, the unit I was with was attacked. Rhodey barely got me out of there alive, but I got pretty messed up in the process. Didn't quite have it in me to make weapons after that."
It was the first time Tony met Steve and Bucky, but it was far from the last time he saw the couple.
Just how bad had that fight been? Tony hadn't looked all that bothered. At least, not enough to warrant him going to such extreme lengths to avoid Steve. The super soldier immediately took to thinking over the entire conversation from the night before. He couldn't imagine anything that would send Tony into such a fit that he'd even abandon the sanctuary of his labs, and five minutes later he was tracking down Natasha and Clint. Who better to find Tony?
When Tony Stark was eighteen, he could have left Red’s. He could have left sooner than that, really, but he liked making himself available for shifts during the holiday season to help out. And if he made absolutely positive that he always had hours on the day that Steve and Bucky were meant to come in for their cake, Rhodey was the only one to call him out on it. Once. Tony had put so much salt in his apple pie afterwards the Rhodes solemnly swore to never comment on it again (and Domitus MacKinnon, trying not to cackle, had warned him about ever ruining a perfectly good slice of pie again). He couldn’t exactly pick a favorite interaction with the two, but Tony
It took Steve a lot longer than it should have to get dressed. He was honestly hoping that Tony would walk in, explain he'd just gone to get breakfast. He didn't expect Tony to cook, after all. After a solid twenty minutes swept by with Steve sitting on the couch and no noise from the hall, he slipped his shoes on and took what he definitely considered his walk of shame.
"I'm not an idiot!" Tony paused, considering. He lifted his hands in surrender at the very clear look that Rhodes gave him. Fuck Rhodey for knowing him better than anyone in the world, honestly. "Okay I can be very, very stupid with people sometimes but even I'm not that bad." The look just kept going. "I'm not!"
Finally he found him. Tony was sitting on a stump breathing as carefully as he could. Steve wasn't sure what was wrong but he was determined to find out.
Ya'll waited over a year for this and I'm honestly sorry. I've been working at it for months. I just hit a rut man. I loved this story. I knew from the SECOND I got the prompt how I wanted it to end. I can't apologize enough to those of you who've been waiting for this for so long.
"Tony relax," Steve laughed, turning the genius to face him. Their lips crashed together. Tony didn’t need to be told twice- his body went soft against the dresser, pressed down into it by the weight of his dear Captain. "The closet? I know you have mirrors in there but- ah, that’s right. There’s a bench in there. Not just for sitting while you put on shoes?"
“I have a piece out in the car,” Steve replied. “I honestly kinda thought you were jokin’ when you offered to buy one last time we were in here. You know you don’t hafta do that, right Tony?”
"God yes," Tony breathed. "You’re getting into this aren’t you? Fuck that is great. This is great. Steve, baby, wonderful precious oh Captain, my Captain, you are just-"
Tony turned, trying to figure out how to not make this awkward. The sex was still a thing he very much wanted. Just, alright, not against the mirror.
Hours passed, and a short nap later Tony was stretching out and rolling over. Hands connected with something solid, and he opened one eye to find he was holding onto Steve's thigh as the super soldier sat up sketching something. Probably him. Tony propped himself up on his elbows, trying to peak. Steve promptly shut the sketch book.
he’d been safe guarding it all night? Blasphemy, Pep, honestly.) and offering them both that usual charming smile.
Steve was actually a little more aggressive than Tony would have anticipated. Not that Tony was upset about that- he was all about Mr. Big and Muscular tossing him around the bedroom. But the thing was, they weren't in a bedroom, and that right there was why it struck him as surprising. He hadn't taken Steve for staking his claim in public, but there was a tongue shoving past Tony's lips and fuck yes, fuuuck yes he was all about this.
Hey everyone! Sorry for the delays, my life has been super hectic! I think part of the problem too is I knew how I wanted to end this, and how I wanted to start it, but I stalled out on what should happen in the middle. I'm getting there, though, I have more ideas and I'm ready to write!
And of course Tony helped his customers. He moved from table  to table. He dropped a dollar in the jukebox and played a few songs, kept conversation light at his tables. Tony had definitely associated Steve and Bucky with the word
His stomach curled. He didn't want a slice of that damn cake. Don't get him wrong, it was delicious. Adrian really did know how to make the perfect Irish Cream Cake you'd ever sink your teeth into, had it down to a science even. Tony could build and tinker and science his way through a lot in life, but you put him in front of the oven with Adrian while the man gave him in depth step by step instructions and there was always some sort of disaster to follow. He didn't understand it. He'd tried after the second year that Steve and Bucky had come in to give them a slice of his own, and he could still remember the exaggerated face Bucky'd made when he took a bite.
"Here, would it be better if we pushed the bench up against one of the mirrors?" Steve offered, a hint of excitement in his voice now.
There was a silence between them for a moment, Tony fighting to focus on Steve at his side rather than the stars above. Finally he glanced over, and Steve reached out to give his hand an encouraging squeeze. Tony didn't want to sound stupid, but he'd seen Steve through some of his nightmares, and Steve had definitely been there for a few of Tony's. Steve wouldn't think he was stupid over this.
"Look it’s alright, we can move, I just- I thought I would mention," Tony assured Steve. "It’s no big deal. It’s a small kink, not really important. More of an accidental discovery than anything. We don’t have to- but can we still-"
"Enough," Natasha hissed at him, giving him a quick nudge with her elbow. "I'm sure it's not that bad Steve. Maybe he was in the bathroom. Do you really want us to waste our time tracking down your boyfriend?"
"Of course man, Tony's got actual owner things to do anyway," Rhodey said, cupping his hand on the back of Tony's neck and drawing him away by the shirt. They didn't stop behind the counter; they made it into the kitchen, and Tony sagged against the wall where Steve couldn't see. "He say anything?" Rhodey asked, voice gentle. He knew that Tony was torn up about this, and Tony hated himself for it. He had no right to be, but watching Steve hurt after every laugh he'd shared with him and Bucky, the stories, the smiles... It was difficult, to say the very least.
"Nah, but I think I'm gonna start staying in your apartment for a whole new reason," Tony replied. Steve's answering kiss was the reason they had breakfast cold.
"That's a long time to park a car," Rhodey offered gently, putting a hand up on Tony's shoulder. Tony's world was spiraling. If Steve wasn't waiting for Bucky, Bucky wasn't here. Which wasn't right. You can't just get a slice of Red's cake without Bucky, or without Steve. It wasn't- Where was Bucky? What was taking so long?
"Broke in?" Nat was all ears at that, fixing Steve with a stern look. "And you just decided to make friends? I knew the security here was crap but-"
"Rogers what do you think you're doing?" Natasha demanded. "After all that coaching you're just giving in?"
Steve had come up with the idea at the team's last post-mission meal. The winter had been kind of a long pain in the butt. Spring had been one of the colder ones, too, which didn't make matters any better. Everyone was tired, they always looked so tired lately, but it hadn't hit Steve until the Summer weather rolled in how pale they all were. He was the Captain of this team and it was his job to keep his soldiers in fighting form. As hard as they'd all been working lately, he decided it was time for a day off.
They were still dancing. Kind of. Mostly, they were making out. And Tony was completely okay with that, until he realized that a few songs had gone by and he had a very, very uncomfortable erection which was being pressed down by the tight jeans he'd worn for the night. Okay. He could fix this. He just had to.. stop kissing Steve for a minute. It actually took a minute for that to happen, and then he was grinning up at Steve, enjoying the way his cheeks flushed, the way he shrugged his shoulders like it was no big deal. But it was. To Tony, it was a huge deal.
“You ain’t always been ya rotten little punk,” Bucky snorted. “Ignore him, doll, I get the bigger piece. I know there’s a bigger piece. Don’t hold out. And two coffees!”
"Because I missed you, Tony, you know I hate being away- Tony, stop yelling, you're going to regret it- And I knew you'd be down here trying to avoid the bedroom because I wasn't there-" Steve wasn't stopping.
"Tony!" Steve called, smile splitting even wider if possible as he followed the gaze of the pair. Luckily, Tony felt Rhodey, Clint, and Bruce at his back, so he didn't end up rushing out of the bar as though his life depended on it. Instead he walked over, happy to accept the pat on the back from that familiar stocky blonde as the two groups merged.
"I'd like to say you have a really nice apartment." Tony was apparently trying to make small talk happen. Steve might not have laughed, but his eyes definitely lit up and Stark's smile had Steve sure he'd been caught. "Simplistic usually doesn't feel homey, but it's comfortable. And the art is nice, but I don't think I've seen it anywhere else."
So maybe this was a bit of a big deal. Maybe he was hoping that this was more than just hanging out with the friends. He wanted this to be meeting the friends. The big introduction. Honestly, that was why he wanted Rhodey and Clint to tag along. He had been toying with the idea of asking Steve on a date for a while, and if he did he wanted to get this part over with quick and easy.
"Well I just figured this is the kinda thing you're supposed to do at the beach, right?" Steve countered.
"I was in the military for a little bit," Steve admitted, finally deciding he'd had enough pizza as he sank back into his couch.
Admittedly, he and Steve had been tipsy that time, and Tony had cracked up while he watched Steve turn red and give Bucky the Look that Tony had learned wasn’t really an angry look at all.
"How'd you tell Jarvis not to let us know where you were?" Steve wondered, pulling down a fresh tea bag and coming to rest with his chin on the Island that Tony was seated at. Stark finished off his firecracker and flicked the stick at the super soldier. "Jarvis, secret code one zero five." Steve dropped his voice to a mocking rasp, and he couldn't quite complain about the shove it received.
Steve had been looking at the menu, but he glanced up at that. He didn't look surprised. Tony had always talked about the other things he thought about doing. "You look like you're working?"
“If there’s a bigger piece, I’m gonna make you guys wrestle over it,” Tony declared, earning a laugh from both that left him feeling a little dizzy. “I can’t interest you in some dinner to go with?”
"Steven Rogers get down here and kiss me now," Tony demanded, and Steve complied. He kissed Tony until they were both breathless, and then finally blessed them with faster, harder thrusts like before. Tony was a mess of wanton moans and misguided demands. Harder? Steve was already railing into him at that point. Tony was saying words just to say them, because if he didn't he might forget how to speak.
"He's not. So it doesn't matter. And he's not going to be." Steve tried to make that part perfectly clear. Nat especially had a habit of trying to set him up with people and he just was not in the mood for that. What he had going with Tony was good. Maddening, but good. "He sleeps around way too much for me and I don't think he wants anything serious anyway. He's had opportunities to make a move. So have I. Neither of us have taken them. So.. just.. drop it. I'm inviting him, though, yes. I think you guys will love him. He's.. he's really great."
He was supposed to be honest with Steve. Pepper said. Happy said. Rhodey said. Steve said. Literally everyone, okay. Steve was going to accept him, or he was going to work around it. But he and Steve had to be open and honest with each other. Steve was doing a good job at it. Tony wasn’t sure this was what they all meant- maybe blurting things out like this wasn’t the best method- but it was too late to take it back.
"Sorry, he just got here," Steve noted. "I would have called off the search but I was a little preoccupied. Apparently Tony is much more interested in this pop-"
"Steve, fuck, Steve," Tony gasped. "Didn’t- god didn’t think you’d- fuck you really like this don’t you?" It took a bit of grunting to get out, but Steve’s answering thrust was enough to confirm.
"Tones?" It wasn't Steve or Bucky; it was Rhodey, reeling him back in as gently as he could. Tony blinked rapidly, turning to look at him before sighing quietly and pulling a rag from his shoulder to start wiping down the counter. Rhodey was... he was right, it was time to close up and move on. Maybe next year he shouldn't come out here on this night. Maybe he should take that night off, specifically, and move on from this weird fixation he had on Steve and Bucky returning. There were a million and one possibilities, ones he'd gone over more times than he should have.
He glanced back at their friends, who all seemed to be pretty interested in their table. Had they been watching them? Not the whole time, he was sure, but probably checking in every once in a while. Good. That meant they could sneak away without any unnecessary comments or knowing smiles or more shovel talks. Good, good, good. Eyes were back on Steve, and he took him in for a moment. Flushed, but obviously thrilled with himself. Well kissed lips, and a shine to his eyes that told Tony he had all the same thoughts that Tony did. At least, he hoped that's what that look meant.
After that, mirrors became the star objects of some early scientific experiments as a teenager- what was really on the other side of this thing? Was there another side? Was this a secret portal, simply waiting for the right key to unlock it?
Steve found A. E. Stark- Tony- to be really easy to talk to. The conversation was all over the place, and at one point technology somehow got worked into the mix. Steve ended up completely lost, but hearing Tony talk about it was absolutely mesmerizing. He didn't have the heart to tell the man that he had no idea what he was talking about, but Tony haad caught on about ten minutes in when he started making shit up on the spot and Steve just nodded.
"No, no, he hasn't said anything," Tony replied. "I dunno what that means. I saw a ring. He has a ring, Rhodes, they went off and got married. And he's wearing it. And you know, maybe Steve did something bad and Bucky left, because if Steve left Bucky I don't think he'd be wearing the ring, but I can't imagine Steve doing anything wrong to any-"
Quiet stretched for a bit longer. Steve usually didn't mind- living alone meant it was usually quiet. Noise was saved for the weekends when he got to gether with his pals. What was he supposed to say, though? Should he try to get to know his neighbor or should he just let him go on his way?
Tony didn’t register the third finger, he was too far gone. He could see it in his own eyes, could see the glimmer Steve’s held as they met his in the reflective glass. The hunger, the need. Looked like Steve wasn’t all that disturbed by this at all.
"Brought you more tea," Steve told him, trading the book for the cup on his bedside table. "How's your throat? Better?"
"Oh no," Steve said firmly, grabbing Tony by the arm and tugging him close. "You're not getting away that easy. What's the matter, cat got your tongue? You had to go see a doctor to figure out exactly what I told you last night? You could have asked me for a remedy- you know, if you could talk, which I'm betting is pretty hard right now." He was so smug, and Tony's brows drew closer and closer as he spoke.
favorite waitress, not some punk kid who just bordered on being too sharply dressed for this sort of restaurant.
"What were you thinking about?" Steve had stood at this point and wandered over, wrapping his hands around Tony’s hips and pressing up against his back. Steve left a lazy trail of kisses along the brunette’s ear.
"Push you into this," Rhodey snorted. "Wow. I can't believe you Tones. Since when are you afraid to try to fuck someone?"
At age twenty, Tony did get involved with the company. Of course he did. But he made sure he had a clear spot in his schedule for those two (and the MacKinnon’s! It was all for them! So they didn’t have to hire new help! Totally!) and at twenty years old, Tony was standing right by their usual table (what do you
just stop and take our order, can you?” Tony gave him a scandalized look at the accusation, before letting out a little laugh and shrugging his shoulders. Well, you got me. After that, it was pretty much his usual night. Tony got their order, he let them eat in peace. He watched, occasionally, letting himself get swept up in the love in their eyes and the way that Steve laughed at Bucky’s jokes. Steve, who’d laughed at a lot of things in this diner, but seemed to have a
"No, Tones, look," the man urged, and pointed out the large front window of the diner. Tony stopped cleaning the counter immediately. For a moment, he wasn't sure what he was looking at. Because that looked like Steve, an awful lot like Steve, with a little more facial hair and some slack in his posture. He was standing out there on the sidewalk, staring ahead down the street with his hands in his pockets. There was something off about it. Tony's slowly forming smile faded away.
Steve looked up from his own work and offered Tony one of those genuine warm smiles of his. Tony waited for it. This was the perfect time for Steve to tease him. But instead, Steve stood up, stretched.. and promptly stomped all over his own castle. Tony's jaw dropped.
"Sorry, I'm with you, sourpatch," Tony said by way of the worst apology ever, but Rhodey slapped his arm and Tony gave him an offended look. What? What could possibly be wrong with his usual half-assed apology?
"Welcome to casa de Stark," he said, leading Steve into the apartment and looking anxiously at his reaction. Tony's place wasn't exactly fancy, but it had a very modern feel to it. Most of his expensive stuff was stored in his vacation home. This was where he liked to relax, not to show off. Usually, he didn't care what his dates thought of the decor, but as he turned to press his lips to Steve's again, he was very pleased to see the appreciative look on his face.
"Oh we can tell," Steve added helpfully, and Tony just threw up his hands and rolled his eyes, stormed off to the kitchen to get them an authentic piece made by Adrian. It was a fond memory, one that he liked to sink into. Tony loved those little moments. It was his favorite thing about working at Red's.
Thor and Bruce were putting up a canopy for shade, equipped with a net to keep bugs away from their table. It was comical to watch (if you asked Tony, anyway, but Steve didn't find it funny so much as sad) Thor get aggrivated with the poles for the canopy and Bruce try to patiently explain that he couldn't just cram them together. Tony had tried to bring along one of his new prototype electronic ones but apparently Steve had insisted they do it the old fashioned way. Which was cute. At least, to Tony.
"We grabbed a spot over here," he told them. "Should be enough for all of us. I was thinking about grabbing some drinks." He looked apologetically at Tony, but it passed quickly as Tony shrugged. "And probably an apetizer. Sound good?"
"I love you too, Cap," Tony replied after a moment, leaning in to rest his head on his shoulder. "I guess I'm kind of sorry too. For uh... yelling louder than you did. Or something." He could feel Steve's chest rumbling with quiet laughter, and he flicked him. "Hey, I'm trying to be genuine here."
"They're still beautiful," Steve told him firmly. "You're just looking at them the wrong way now. Look, Tony, that cluster there." Steve pointed one finger up to the sky, and watched as Tony hesitantly followed it's direction. "See, the little dipper. When you look at that-"
He still remembered (with great clarity) the first time he was fucked against a mirror. His face pressed against the cool reflection. Cock gently rubbing against it from time to time, leaving thick, slick residue that definitely was not window cleaner. What Tony remembered best, though, was staring deep into his own eyes and reflecting on how absolutely shattered he looked. He’d come completely undone at the hands of his lover- who’s name he unsurprisingly couldn’t remember- and Tony had openly wept at how beautiful this surrender was.
Tony didn’t pick up the job because he needed it. Working part time at a diner was never really in his cards, not with well established parents and a mind that would secure a future in robotics and wealth. It had been a pure need for socialization. A thirst for something that was out of his element. And above all? A suggestion from Rhodes that it wouldn’t kill him to experience a minimum wage job so that when he followed through and took over his dad’s company one day, he wouldn’t forget what it felt like to be on the bottom. Rhodey had the absolute best suggestions from the very first day they met, standing awkwardly in a dorm room and trying to figure out how to bridge the gap between roommates caused by the age, the reputation, and the uncertainty.
"I promise, I'm not going to take too much time for this," Steve assured him as he broke from the kiss. "I want you stretched just enough. No more. Want to feel you relaxing around me.." Tony sucked in a breath, and Steve offered him a grin. "You like that, huh?" Another kiss was pressed to Tony's throat, and with it there was a second finger. This one spread him. Tony could feel those fingers twisting him apart, and he wrapped his legs around Steve's hips, trapping his arm.
"Reporter, huh?" Steve realized that in all the talking he and Tony had done the other night, most of it had been about himself. Now it was his turn to press. "You see some crime or something?"
Maybe that was why he hadn't. Maybe this strangers plea via paper had just been that strong. Ah, who was Steve kidding? He was just being soft. This guy obviously hadn't meant any harm. Steve didn't have much experience with 'crazy one night stands' but he could imagine it was something worthy of escape. At any rate, he just wanted his new key.
"Yeah well..." Tony paused, realizing that it would be strange to tell Steve that he specifically came in on this night to see if Steve and Bucky would come through. Three years was a strange amount of time to fixate on people who he didn't know outside of his job. His old job. "You know, busy time of year. I'm part owner, it's only right that I show up when they call."
To the water he went, and within minutes he had returned to begin his work a few feet away from Steve. He was considering the possibility of how to make a working draw bridge, and wondered momentarily if Steve would call it cheating if he got some... accessories from the jet. Probably. Fine, good old fashioned sand castle couldn't be too hard. Look at all the suits he'd built! A little bit of sand was cake.
The third wasn't quite so menacing, probably because he was the one making Steve laugh. But that dude with the man bun and the red head under his arm had locked eyes with Tony the second they saw him staring, and Tony knew that they knew that he knew that he was completely, totally, irrevocably fucked.
Tony Stark was twenty three years old when, on November 19th, Steve and Bucky never showed up for their slice of cake. And everything was, most definitely,
"Busy yelling over nothing?" Steve countered playfully, hoping to ease Tony into a better mood with that winning smile of his. The way Tony's eyes flickered told him no, no that was not the case.
Steve hadn't really thought about the fact that the key had turned easier than usual in the handle, and as he opened the door he found himself chest to chest with just the man who'd been running in and out of his thoughts. And, you know, apparently his apartment.
Tony looked over just as Rhodey was shaking his head, his eyes fond but exhausted. Being best friends with Tony Stark was a full time job; or at least, Tony insisted it was. He'd tried to pay him for it before. He'd been really drunk. Story of his life right? "You can lie to yourself all you want tonight, Tones. C'mon, man, why don't we start cleaning up the place and get ready to close? We can take a slice of that cake back to your place and argue about what to watch on Netflix."
“Where’s Adrian?” Bucky growled, playful and smooth. “I tell Stevie every year I’m not gonna put up with your shit, punk, and then every year you get away with it.”
Steve didn't let him keep going. He closed the distance between them, tugging Tony into his embrace, and kiss him hard. He would have lifted him onto the counter if there weren't two plates of steaming food in the space he would have used. As he broke free, all he could do was offer Tony a stupid smile.
“You already go on the news,” Bucky pointed out. “Don’t think you need Stevie’s art for that. But you’re damn right to wanna buy some, ‘cause it’s beautiful like him.”
"Anyway," Tony cleared his throat, while Steve looked at him with a puzzled expression at his sudden tense posture. "We should uh. Listen, if you're not busy one day this week. I could treat you to- that is, we could go hang out.. not here, after I've-"
"It's mostly mine," Steve supplied after a moment. Tony stared. "It's a hobby. I don't know that I'd want to sell any of it, so when I do a really good piece I just.. hang it up."
With that, she and Clint were gone. Steve spent the next forty minutes scouring the tower. He'd asked Jarvis, finally, but apparently Tony had set his location to be accessed only upon emergency. Of course. Steve was frantic, heading for the elevator to check the lower floors when..
"This morning. Nat and I took a power nap and figured we'd stop over to grab you and hit a bar. Sam said he's down. And he said that maybe you'd bring your boyfriend along? Why didn't you tell me you were seeing anyone?"
Sure enough they did, heading out to take a quick shower and slip back into their suits. As they reached the front door Tony shot back up to their room for his watch, and when he returned to Steve’s side minutes later, the super soldier was shaking with silent laughter.
Tony honestly could have done it forever. He’d already gone into talks with the MacKinnon’s about how one day he’d really like to partner with them, provide some security to the diner, make sure it was always a staple in their city. The bakery wasn’t happening,
knew how and when to drop a line just right to leave you cracking and it seemed like he never failed. The first thing Tony noticed about him was the way he wore that ragged worker style while still looking so
Tony left the two to bicker about what made a good cake, although he wasn’t so sure Steve wasn’t going to be eating his words- after the cake, of course. Adrian MacKinnon was a man who’s food could literally
For a moment they were apart, catching their breath, and Steve was staring at Tony so intensley that the man actually blushed. And what the fuck was with that? Blushing? Was this college?
"But he's always in the lab," Steve protested, and perhaps it was because she loved him or perhaps it was because Captain America had a really nice set of puppy dog eyes, but Natasha was rolling her eyes and shoving him aside.
"Stevie, it's so good to see ya," Bucky offered with a broad grin, stepping inside and glancing around. It was so much less depressing in here than the last time he'd been around. "You cleaned the palce up! And it looks like you're back to doing art?" He recognized the style in a few of the things hanging along the walls. Steve just shrugged, not wanting to get into the reason why.
do anything.” Tony loved to tease them on their occasional slang and accents. Bucky’s was thicker and raw, in a way that Tony honestly felt wasn’t real the first time. Who the fuck had a Brooklyn accent that thick these days, anyway? “Secondly I love art. And one day you’re gonna be big and famous, and I’m gonna be able to go on the news and say, ‘Hey! I know that guy! Look at this cool painting he did for me!’”
There was one time in a fun house, in the hall of mirrors, the little maze. He’d brought a fling there and.. well, one thing lead to another, he’d been asked not to come back and-
There was a moment of awkward silence as Bruce and Thor found their own reasons to disperse, and then Tony was clearing his throat.
There was suddenly a surge of upbeat, electronic music, and Tony's face split into a grin. He didn't care that Rhodes rolled his eyes, or that Clint was snickering. He turned towards Steve, ready for his moment and-
"Well I don't want to see what a team would look like with you as captain," called Bruce, seemingly un-phased by the glare Tony shot in his direction.
The first time, Steve was a mixture of furious, amused, and concerned. Furious because an absolute stranger (he didn't count the time that apartment 6E dropped a heavy box with clicking mechanized parts in it on his foot as a meeting) had the audacity to not only break into his apartment, but also had left a note. Amused, because the note was oddly charming and this was certainly a way to finally officially meet. Concerned because there was no damage to the door or the frame. Apartment 6E was apparently good at breaking into things. Should he be worried?
“Nah, we’re just here for the cake,” Steve explained. “Buck dragged me here to show me that there’s no better cake in the city. I was gonna have a field day with him if you guys didn’t serve it anymore.”
Steve was obviously trying not to laugh at him, and honestly Tony adored him for it. "Well, this is Bucky." Okay, man bun had a surprisingly non-threatening name. "Natasha." Yep, looked like a Natasha. "And Sam."
Tony’s mouth opened and he cried out. It wasn’t the first time Steve had heard him make a sound like that, not even close. It was the first time Tony’s breath left thick fog against a mirror. His eyes were blown wide, staring into his own soul. Steve rode his orgasm out moments later buried as deep in Tony as he could manage, gripping his hips near hard enough to bruise. They took a moment to catch their breath before Steve draped over him once more, placing gentle kisses against the shell of Tony’s ear.
"There are just... so many stars out here," Tony confided finally. "They're so big and bright. I used to think they were so beautiful, but anymore.. Anymore they're just.."
"Yeah?" Quite the opposite of Steve, Tony sounded as though he'd had all the breath sucked out of him.
"I want to fuck you," Steve breathed, leaning in to press their lips together, tongue sliding into Tony's mouth long enough to taste before he pulled his face back again. "I've wanted to for weeks, and now that I'm here.. Fuck, Tony, this is just how I want you."
"I felt bad that I suggested we all hit a bar when I found out you were recovering," Steve called over the music with a shrug. "Figured if you were going to stay sober, I would too."
There he was, stunned into silence again. Except Tony was supposed to answer that question, wasn’t he?
"Isn't there one called Hydra?" Plan b was of course to try and push Steve away. The super soldier was a little too sturdy for that.
There were the bad possibilities, too, but Tony had done everything he could to push them away even as they became more and more frequent. What could have happened to the two? What the fuck would Steve and Bucky ever deserve in this world besides something good?
"Wanted you so bad Tony," Steve said as he gazed down at the man, one hand resting teasingly between Tony's thigh and pelvis, holding him in place. He slowed his thrusts for a moment, and Tony, god bless Tony, he did his best to grind against Steve but that grip was so strong. "Want you so bad," Steve corrected. Tony stared up at him, catching the meaning behind the words. Steve didn't want to be a one night stand. Tony.. didn't want him to be, either.
"To bed," Tony replied simply, shaking Steve's hand free. "You can come if you'd like." It was the least inviting invitation Steve had ever been given, especially by Tony, who would typically drop every hint ever that he wanted Steve in his bed. The soldiers confidence was knocked a little, but he did follow Tony up to bed. He even held him, albeit a bit awkwardly as both of them were still a little stiff from the tension between them.
Before he could explain himself, Steve was kissing him silent again. This time held more passion rather than raw need. It was very reassuring, and then Steve was breaking away and planting a gentle kiss in Tony’s hair.
Steve absolutely didn't think about Tony at least once a day for the next week and a half. And he especially didn't grin as broad as possible when he returned home one night to find the door yet again unlocked. At least he was able to whipe the smile from his face before he walked inside, though it was right back in place when he caught sight of Tony on his couch with a pizza in front of him.
"Wounded in an op." His voice was a little more somber now, but at least he was able to talk about it. A year ago? He would have choked. "My best friend lost his arm. I almost lost my leg. Honorable discharge. Therapy for a while, but I figured out that just getting back out there and trying to live a normal life was what I needed. When I came home.. it felt like the entire world had changed. It's so weird. Everything keeps going while you're away from home, but all you know is what was happening when you left."
The Alpha who fucked him through the last two days. The Alpha who was cuddling his backside at the moment. The Alpha who was way too good for Tony and out of his league for miles.
A small whimper caught his attention. Right across the room a head slowly peaked out from behind a machine. Tony!
Just like that both men breathed out exhausted, lying on the bed in a sweaty heap of limbs, at a loss for words and just plainly staring off into nothingness.
The part of Tony which wanted to leave quickly, erase any trace of him ever stepping a foot into the man’s bedroom and hide for the rest of his pathetic life to contemplate his embarrassing actions in peace was screaming at him, not doubt there. However, the part that was still loudly purring due to the strong scent engulfing him and the warm presence against his back that grounded him, close to pulling him back to sleep, somehow overpowered any similar reaction from the last time he woke up in the same bed as Steve.
They should have known better, both of them. Harley was raised not to present his inner Alpha this strongly whenever he encountered another Alpha, not to challenge someone's dominance like, like a feral animal. Sure, he just wanted to protect his mother, which Tony’s inner Omega secretly made proud, but this wasn’t the solution.
“Sir, you’ve reached the penthouse”, the calming voice of Jarvis cut through his messed up thoughts, which Tony honestly was thankful for. Having a mental breakdown twice after spending the night with Captain America really wasn’t on his bucket list.
What the hell could the man do? He wasn’t Tony, he wasn’t his mother and not even sure if he could call himself a friend.
“Tony, whatever your brain is just overthinking, you better stop now. I have a proposition to make,” Steve offered honestly.
Tony begged innerly that Steve wouldn’t judge him too much after he finished his story. Many Alphas wouldn’t hesitate to slutshame him cruelly due to the conception of Harley, old notion still firmly set inside their heads that an Omega shouldn’t have sex outside of a mating.
Peter squinted his doe eyes at the tall man and whined loudly at the implication. “Clumsy?! I’m pretty sure I have more qualities than that!”
“You’re way more interesting, Tony”, Steve admitted with a lazy grin and kissed the Omega’s neck in hopes of calming him.
The words hit Steve directly as he let go of the Omega, stammering out a few words. What the hell? That manipulative minx. Nevertheless he simply couldn’t tell Tony what Peter was planning, it was one of his condition when he demanded to be repaid.
Just what was the man stirring inside of him? He can’t remember ever being so Alpha hungry in his whole life. A brush against Steve’s morning wood was all it took! All it took to make them have sex.
Blinking open his sleep ridden eyes carefully the man came face to face with bright rays of sunlight streaming through the tall windows facing the bed. And, shit, bright, fucking bright. Who the hell let the curtains open before going to sleep?
His kids, naturally, already finished all their work on Friday, not really challenged by their grades assigned tasks. Well, this again proved they surely were the kids of Tony Stark.
Tony and Steve spend the morning after together in bed, not as innocently as the Omega would have thought at the beginning.
Thankfully a metallic sound could be heard right way, Bucky, due to his quick reflexes, was able to catch the mug before it could create a big mess right beneath Peter’s feet.
The female Alpha was listening intensely the whole time, but didn’t comment nor interrupt the man once, like she usually did to get an honest picture of the situation.
Steve, still startled from his gift that just disappeared into Clint’s mouth, awkwardly mirrored the gesture.
“Well who demolished our common room then, if it wasn’t one of the scientists?”, Sam questioned simply.
Steve smiled lovingly at the back of his head and stroked his cheek. “No Tony, you were the best Omega an Alpha could wish for.”
Tony reacted instantly and presented to some extent, though not much, and purred in delight, instincts happy of being in such close proximity to the Alpha.
His AI answered right away with the ever calming voice. “It’s May the 3rd, Sir. Time, 9am sharp. The weather today-”
The strong build of his heat mate turned him, and especially his inner Omega, on to no end. His brain preening at having scored a strong mate this heat, because strong mate equals strong pups and his instinct reduced brain was a little overwhelmed at the fact.
“Steveee, what are we doing?”, Tony asked as another whine left his mouth and the grip on his waist tightened.
Before Tony could open his mouth to clarify his point, Steve stepped in, all righteousness and bossy, which, yeah, Tony wasn’t complaining about after their make out session a few minutes ago.
And, wow, Tony rarely noticed how much Steve cared about his simple well being. It was nice and close to domestic, which shoved another desire at him, the Omega really had no patience to contemplate.
The brown haired teen was frustrated and annoyed, but didn’t see any alternative solution in reach, which is why he mumbled out a small agreement and started working on the outline until the bell went off half an hour later. They had three days. Three days which Peter planned to spend in the labs with his Dad and Bruce, helping them with an Avengers related issue.
Like that several minutes passed with Tony trying to lower his head more and more down the thick cock, though, at one point he choked, this length simply being too overwhelming for him all at once. Hands in his brown locks kept him going, tracing through his strands and lightly tugging which got the Omega to emit a few moans of his own, joining the noises the Alpha made in the room.
“I love you too, baby.” Pepper with a big back affected by every attribute in the tone Tony was using. While Tony had one hand around her waist, and adjusted his fixture on the coffee cup he had in his other, Pepper rubbed circles into the shielded surface of his back.  Then, she patted him on his back - one, two, three - times. “Get in the car, baby.”
But - apparently not - because as soon as Tony even began to say her real name,Wanda, Mrs. Maximoff stopped him in his tracks.
Considering their most recent stint, Tony felt that he and Mrs. Maximoff were on a first name basis; because when they last met, Wanda called his name several times in a row.
“You’ve been made redundant, Tony.” his facetious grin disappeared quickly. “You haven’t called us at Eazy, you haven’t called me, in a year. We have a new producer on our line so, out with the old. You have one album left, unless you wanna extend your contract?” Wanda spilled, suggestively.
“I’m gonna go broke in three days, if I keep this up.” His roar: rough and ragged. Tony was looking directly out the windshield. A basket of remorse, feeling much like butterflies, placed carefully at the base of his stomach.
Wanda sniggered. Finger running over one disc coloured in red, white and blue. She reached down to her Louis V bag, and threw her pink jacket on, proceeding to escort Tony out of her office, discs still on her desk.
The car ride home was quite in its first quarter, Tony relieving his phone from the ziploc iit was placed in when he made admission to the prison.
“Tony, it’s not an industry secret that you are an addict. Civil blood makes civil hands unclean, have you heard that before? You ask any producer to work on a project with you right now, you get a resounding no.”
At a red light, when the car was stationary, Pepper caught a glimpse of Tony, undoubtedly distressed, and got the message at the heart, what was going on.
Tony looked onward to a sight of wonders, on either side of Wanda’s cross pendant. This wonder, Tony lived and breathed only a year ago.
Tony had met three days out of the ninety he was sentenced to. Before his hearing, his lawyer promised Tony that’d he’d only be spending thirty days in the ‘hell hole’, if any, for driving under the influence. That was before he found out that Tony refused to take a indicator test. That was before he found out Tony resisted arrest. Because Tony didn’t tell him the whole truth. Tony never did, to any body.
Pepper’s hair is flapping at the force, and Tony doesn’t know to feel about that, he hadn’t felt it before.
“Viv?” He used that sweet, smooth talker voice ‘that killed all the ladies!’ back in the nineties. Apparently, it was enough to knock the granny panties of off Vivienne.
“Eazy?” Vivienne at reception: a sweet, seventy-year-old darling. She had a crush on Tony, he was certain of it.
“Tony,” Pepper said once more. “I know this is hard. I know you feel you’re at the end of your tether. I know you want to get in your bed, or in a coffin. But if you want this to stop, for yourself, Eazy is the only way out of this mess.”
Wanda walked back to her drawer and released twenty discs from her capture. “These are starting stage projects. Tony, this isn’t about you and me. It’s about you. I know why you’re here. I know why you’re here now, and why not a year ago. Make this easy for yourself and put your heart into it. The public eat up a sob story.”
The blond Alpha made his way down the hallway with a whimpering pup in his arms, who nudged his cold nose against his neck every few minutes. At least the halls were clear of students since class was currently being held.
Tony was pleasantly surprised how much he enjoyed the friendly exchange and the light flirting going on. And the best part, his head felt lighter, the nagging feeling of having to let Steve down and end the date now gone.
However after a while the stomach rumbling got louder, even to be heard over all the purring and he was sure both of his pups were craving food as well.
“Shit”, the genius called out with teary eyes, brought up by the sneezing. His eyes then singled on the flowers in Steve’s hands and he jumped up quickly.
Also the collar thing even surprised me but I think it's rather fitting. Steve is a closeted pervert lol
Raising his hands to calm down the blabbering pup Tony cleared his throat. “Slow down pup, you’re making your old Ma’s head spin. What idea are we talking about?”
However, as soon as it started Peter came to an end of the presentation with a relieved sigh as he changed the slides on the whiteboard one more time.
Peter, still slurping his apple juice loudly, gazed at the flowers in Steve’s hands before looking the Alpha into the eyes with a raised eyebrow. “Business. Sure”, he commented knowingly. “He’s in the office down the hall, can’t miss it.”
The atmosphere in the car was tense with Happy concentrating on driving, Peter still starring absentmindedly at his hands, the teen was fumbling with shakingly, a trait he sure picked up from his mother, and Steve feeling as out of place as ever.
The courting gift was a simple, but delicate and beautiful looking leather armband. A piece woven by Steve himself with the uttermost care, making sure the bracelet was going to mirror the Omega he wanted to give the gift to in some way.
As they reached the bedroom Tony turned around swiftly and threw his arms around the blond once more with a wicked smile. “You remember my heat, Alpha?”, he purred in Steve’s ear and gave the lobe a small teasing lick. “Remember how you fucked me good, took care of me so nicely, such a caring Alpha you are.”
Pulling his fingers out the man reached them in front of his face and slowly sucked them into his mouth. Moaning at the taste, his Omega’s taste.
“It’s fucking obvious Steve! You and me, we just don’t fit, it’s- I’m not made out to be a proper mate”, Tony quickly forced out with eyes downcast. “You can’t be that ignorant not to see it. Which is why we shouldn’t be here right now, pretending this date could evolve into something else, something unspeakably stupid.”
Then Tony quickly felt fingers wrap into the cloth of his sweatpants and a pull downwards, his legs now exposed to the Alpha’s intense gaze. The slick and come soaked underwear didn’t even manage to hide the Omega’s arousal one tiny bit and Tony moaned as the blond rubbed his upper thighs, fingers trailing along the underwear and most importantly his ass.
The genius furrowed his brows at the scene but quickly gasped at the obvious facts. ‘Stunning Tony’, no it couldn’t be. Was Steve, the pure image of perfection, jealous? Because of a complimentary comment from Thor, a usual occurrence in the tower. The intimate times he’s spend with the Alpha already must have caused something deep inside of the blond, let loose a whole new set of instincts.
Okay what? The Omega wanted to open his mouth to reject the idea but the Alpha cut him to it once again.
Steve looked on wordlessly and, honestly, frightened of the small omegan teen. The boy was now cursing widely, flashes on the screen, Steve didn’t understand, signaling something happening on the screen.
“Yeah obviously we did end up fucking during my heat and only a few weeks later I was undoubtedly pregnant and feeling like my world was falling apart. I told him regardless, not wanting to keep such an information from the father and it went as expected.”
Next to the Alpha the Omega was in a similar state, the act of the Alpha before making the genius swallow. The whole Alpha act just got to him, which, yeah, was simple biology, but Steve was affecting him differently. So much more intense. The heat in the elevator was getting close to unbearable as Tony inhaled another dose of potent Alpha pheromones.
After she left again with a noticeable skip in her steps the two started another conversation, the previous story having helped them loosen up and continue talking like usual.
“Clint”, Tony sighed and slowly loosen his hold on the now content Alpha in his arms to look up at the now wickedly grinning Omega, who was eyeing the whole situation with too much interest for the genius liking. “Let me just remind you how you were cowering on the floor just a few minutes ago.”
Before the Alpha could even react to the striking words, open his mouth to ask Tony to elaborate, the Omega was already talking again.
The Alpha began to blush lightly, god, he’s never done that before but it’s been a prominent fantasy of his for a long time now. “I’m going to lie down and then you sort of get on top of me but facing the other way, of course only if that’s alright with you.”
Steve squeezed his hand making the Omega lose his words. “The only reason we’re here today is because of your pup. Peter was the one helping me give you the courting gift, he told me the entry code to the lab.”
“That old shirt isn’t suitable for a date, Tony”, her green eyes once again narrowed at him, eyeing the fabric, now laying on the floor again, with disdain.
The Omega blinked at the statement and promptly picked up the small, pretty looking box. Another courting gift? It was official, Steve was fucking acing this whole courting thing and Tony clearly had to step up his game.
But what the ever loving hell did Alphas like? Except sex and scenting. He could buy Steve an art studio, however, aware how much the man treasured the simple pleasures of capturing feelings on canvas. Yeah, maybe that would do. Or sex, if nothing else worked.
“I wouldn’t even say it was a friends with benefits sort of relationship since the Alpha and I weren’t even friends, just lab acquaintances that worked together one the rare occasion. Anyway, we had sex a couple times and it was all good, peachy even and not complicated with feelings or some shit. So yeah, I wasn’t on birth control, since it’s not needed outside of a heat and I never planned on spending my heat with that Alpha anyway.”
“Peter, are you alright?’’, Steve asked concerned, voice full of worry. One zombie like coffee addict was enough for him to handle, he didn’t need to add a kid zombie to the list, though Tony seemed to be in better shape than ever these past days he noted.
“Besides your slut of a mother probably only got Captain America to come along today because he gets fucked by the guy on a daily basis, such a fucking whore.”
Ah, Steve remembered. The code, the only reason he’s gotten this far with Tony the past days. Well, he should have guessed the small Stark planned something and wouldn’t just give him the numbers without having a repayment in mind.
A comforting scent reached Tony’s nose, replacing the sour and bitter smell of disappointment as he was softly embraced by the Alpha, the familiar feeling of his friend’s close contact settled his nerves for the moment as he took in the surrounding smell.
At with those words the room erupted into light laughter, Steve casting his friend a knowing look and Tony smirking at the comment of the ex-assassin. Yeah, despite everything, the event turned out to be a great story.
After a rushed shower Tony got dressed in a flash, taming his dark thick hair and freshening up one last time, while Pepper watched him closely from an armchair next to his bed.
Thor, who was still rather sane, stared at the brunet in question. Why would Omega Stark disrupt their challenging fight? Didn’t Omegas love when Alphas fought for honor and status? But as he looked upon the posture of the man he noticed the tense shoulders and trembling hands against his sides. Delight surely looked different than that even on earth.
The Omega came to a stop in front of another pile of clothes and hummed softly, sorting through the many pairs of pants he owned he soon let out a victorious ‘ha’ and pulled a pair of grey jeans from the mass of clothes. “I don’t have any clue what you’re talking about my dearest Pep”, he answered innocently as he examined the pants in his hands.
“Daad, I brewed something exquisite, really, you should all try it! It makes your mind go wooosh.”, he laughed loudly, eyes transfixed on the two men, proud as ever.
Thankfully the Beta didn’t ask any more questions and simply told him he’d be in front of the school as soon as possible.
Maybe it was his heat sabotaged Omega brain but the next think he knew Tony was crawling towards Steve, like a cat advancing its prey. He was feeling even warmer now, his cock still painfully hard but now his slick was mainly the problem, leaving his whole backside wet.
It wasn’t that anything was wrong with his living arrangement, or the other Avengers or, hell even his Dad. No, turns out, school was the culprit, trying to ruin his life all over again.
Soon enough they would both get tired of him and leave to never be seen again, the only loyal pup being Harley who’d stay with his poor old Omega mother.
However, before the god could answer a low growl sounded off from the kitchen counter, making all heads turn in surprise. Steve was openly growling at the taller man, a snarl on the tip of his tongue already, food on the stove forgotten for the time being.
Crouching down in front of the sitting Omega, the Alpha looked him slowly up and down. Taking in the ruffled hair, loosened shirt and wet patch at the front of the man’s pants, Steve smirked in delight. He couldn’t get enough of this view, wishing he had some sort of camera to capture the moment. Though that would take too long, the Alpha wasn’t going to wait any longer.
Steve noticed right away and cockily placed his own hand on his clothed cock. “Don’t worry, Omega. You’ll be getting your fill soon enough,” he smirked and squeezed his dick in confirmation.
With that he started the class, naturally also not letting it be taken from him to introduce Captain America to the whole class, only partly gushing about his historic achievements and pointing at several pictures on the wall featuring the man, all while Steve stood to the side with an awkward smile.
And Steve, as tired as he was, took Tony’s hand without any further questions, vanishing into the room with him. Finally. Sleep, he thought happily, hugging his boyfriend from behind and sinking into a dreamless slumber.
“No, damn it Tony! I’ve liked you for years now! My feelings have nothing to do with your heat, I’ve been pining for so long at this point now and until a few weeks ago I thought you’d be unreachable for an Alpha like me!” Steve was now gripping the table forcefully, the conversation weighing down on him, food now totally forgotten on the table.
At least now he had a bit of quiet and peace, since the other Avengers left for a mission a few minutes ago and wouldn’t be back until tomorrow morning. Thank god.
Tony huffed at the position, not really having thought anything else of the Alpha next to him. Though the warm presence close to him and the strong arms over his waist with the thick Alpha scent in the air quickly calmed his mind down and lulled him to sleep even more so.
God, Steve hasn’t been to school in like seventy years, how was one supposed to act in such surrounding. Not even mentioning the fact that he was clearly an adult and Captain America at that, a national hero which everyone would recognize. Why did he agree to this once again?
Sleepy Tony was the embodiment of cute, closely followed by his own pups who must have inherited that specific genetic aspect.
Therefore he would do it, go on a date with Steve. Something he owed the Alpha now. Though, naturally Tony would also use the event to clarify to the man why he should forget about this ridiculous notion, the idea Tony could be a potential mate. He just needed one evening to talk about his past, his struggles and demons and he was certain that the blond would forget about whatever happened between them, move on and hopefully find some Omega worthy of Captain America.
As the blond began to crowd his space, nuzzling his neck and, was that, biting? Steve was openly nibbling at his neck, like a starving man who has just tasted his first meal in weeks.
Though, wrong answer apparently as the man started getting red in the face and glare at the boy with annoyed eyes. He cast a glance at the weird atmosphere around the classroom, students hushly talking, a sight fairly unusual for a bunch of twelve year old children.
But at least he could pretend he didn’t feel his heart pounding whenever the tall, blond alpha walked into a room. Pretend he didn’t blush at the smile the hero gave him, those pearly white teeth and kissable lips seemingly just mocking him at this point. Pretend like he didn’t feel his hole get wet, an empty ache deep inside of him when Steve’s body brushed against his in the most innocent way possible.
Okay sorry first of all for the long wait! I am rather busy at the moment and despite that I feel like every chapter deserves enough time to write, since I also want it to turn out well
Somehow he would always miss the time he got pulled from so suddenly, the things he would never regain and were lost forever. Peggy being one of those.
The next minutes seemingly passed in a blur for Tony, the arm now around his waist taking all of his concentration while they entered the restaurant. Warmth and the strong muscles around the man threw him back to the three days they spend together, the familiar grip making pictures appear in his head. Pictures of lust and want.
“What do you want me to say Steve? Want me to admit what an Omega slut I am, so desperately begging for cock my teammate has to offer himself up out of pity?”, Tony asked with a frown. And shit, he could already feel another heatwave on its way.
Still the child wouldn’t come down, no matter how much the adults complained and tried to reason with him. Actually, he even laughed the whole time, scattering across the ceiling, like it was a game they were playing.
“Oh Steve”, a new voice said across the room. “What are you doing here?”, Tony asked sitting at a desk and typing something on a laptop, books randomly scattered and opened around the Omega.
“Omega, would you like to go onto a date with me?”, Steve suddenly asked with a serious look, taking Tony’s wrist into his hands, stroking the bracelet and his skin tenderly.
However, wasn’t it worth a try? As a scientist himself he always swore to try every possibility before coming to a conclusion and were relationships really that different? If he looked at it like a thesis he already knew what to do to get a scientifically reliable evaluation.
And Steve. Steve shouldn’t have allowed for it to go this far, he was the older, wiser and more experienced Alpha and should have drawn a line as soon as Harley released his first snarl.
However it didn’t. The only thing the Alpha did was spur his inner Alpha side on like crazy, a boiling feeling of anger settling in his stomach with a strong side of possessiveness and the need to protect. Protect his family.
Fucking super spies looking through his carefully build up walls, like the trauma and pain he experienced in the past were meaningless.
“But-”, the Alpha tried but got cut off by the engine starting and Happy throwing him a meaningful look through the mirror.
Steve leaned down slowly and captured the genius’ lips in a sweet kiss, squeezing his sides lightly.
“I’m just gonna wait out in the hall,” Peter mumbled out and trailed out of the door with a small wave.
Yet before she could ask the question everyone’s been thinking about the Alpha already stood up. “I excuse my unannounced and sudden appearance, ma’m. But I’m here to experience the education of the 21st century and to share my past knowledge and impressions of the past with the young minds of the future. Therefore I hope I’m not intruding in any way,” he explained with a determined gaze at which Peter gasped in awe.
The Omega let out a sigh of relief, at least they could talk now and he’d convince Steve to leave. “Don’t ‘what the hell’ me Rogers. You damn sure know that we can’t do whatever it is you were just trying to do!”
The Alpha was holding his head more in surprise than anger and for the moment Steve snapped out of the feral Alpha behaviour, now looking at Tony confused, eyebrows drawing up in a silent question.
“No, don’t come closer!”, Tony shrieked. The orgasm prior still tingling his whole body, the body which was already overly sensitive due to his heat.
Steve didn’t like this, didn’t like using his Alpha voice. But seeing Tony like a submissive Omega, similar to the ones in those old movies he liked, turned him on to no end. His cock was throbbing painfully, eyes darkening the more seconds passed.
Not Steve though and maybe the realization, the fact that the blond didn’t just take without any further concern for his partner, was what spurred Tony’s nature on with a swarm of horny omegan thoughts taking his usual logical brain hostage.
“Pup, god, I’m sorry I wasn’t there last night because honestly? Building a death star sounds awesome, smaller and without the destructive functions in the movies, but awesome nonetheless”, Tony laughed and squeezed his Omega pup’s shoulder. “You two are too smart for your own good, you know that?”
The blond’s heart slightly broke at the Omega’s reaction. Even though Tony had no way of knowing the pie was from Steve it still hurt the Alpha’s ego and pride, the reaction of a rejected courting gift making his mood even worse.
Just his timing the boy remarked innerly and panicked at the advancing group. He was the perfect target right now, all by himself in an empty hallway, his protective brother sick and probably being talked about in the school for bringing Steve with him.
“Nope, I was pretty out of it after I finished my assignment. Oh speaking of it, I gotta go hand this in, bye guys!” and with that he waved one last time and ran out of the door.
The headspace was literally only a certain amount of time in which an Omega could only concentrate on an Alpha’s presence close to them, a prominent need to seek comfort which did not leave any room for other thought. It was usually caused by trauma, panic or pain, so it wasn’t a surprise the pup dropped.
Bruce thought about it for a second before answering the young Omega. “Well, according to the rules of pack dynamics the place of team leader, just another title for pack Alpha, can be-”
Natasha sighed into the disheveled hair of her chaotic friend and traced his neck along the man’s nape, keeping a lookout for any new changes, which have happened more than ever since both her teammates got their shit together more or less.
Now the whole family was sat in the common room in front of the huge, especially designed, TV, currently deciding on what to watch.
Though when Tony looked up Steve was only watching him with curious eyes and mouth set into a firm line, clearly waiting for him to continue.
His kid swung back and forward in his webs, still giggling like a madmen. “I mixed coffee with an energy drink!”
Expensive dress shoes covered his feet, the shining leather clearly noticeable to the eyes. And finally the smart black frames on his face finished the look, underlining his deep brown eyes and framing his face lovingly.
Tony interrupted both of his, now rambling, kids. “Okay, you know what?! I’ll just make both before you two kill each other,” he stated exasperated as a deep sigh left his lips. So much for a peaceful Sunday morning. Not in this family, apparently.
Though the other part of him, mainly his Omega nature, was purring at the words, instincts of presenting his neck for mating and offering himself up to a strong Alpha like that. It stirred that part of him on, the thought of being able to proudly wear a mating bite from Steve Rogers on his neck. And ideally being filled with another pup.
In an instance a loud ferocious growl ripped throughout the whole room, walls shaking from the sheer volume and disrupting both Alphas.
Finally the boy started his presentation with a pleasant flow. Steve was listening interested, liking to hear stories he actually could also talk about and didn’t miss out on due to being frozen. Also the boy was handling the whole thing spectacularly in his eyes, even though the small hint of a panicked spiced scent tickled his nose.
“Young sir, it’s time to get up. If you don’t get up in two minutes you won’t have enough time to get ready and will ultimately miss your first class. To prevent such a case I will contact your mother in a minute.”
“First of all ‘perfect’ Omega? I’m pretty sure such an old timer ideal shouldn’t come from someone who calls himself a futurist, Tony. And damaged? You seem very much intact to me”, Steve explained with a pointed look.
And his Dad didn’t disappoint him, like he ever could, Peter thought fondly, as the man eagerly invited him to stay at the tower during the two weeks on the phone. The teen could hear Steve, his Dad’s boyfriend, laugh fondly in the background, and Peter smiled looking forward to it even more so now. He liked Steve, even though the instruction videos were cringe worthy, the real Captain America was actually a pretty laid back guy.
Soon after the pup was ready to go and on the way to the kitchen. However, just as he passed the room of his brother Harley he could hear a worried voice and pick up a distressed scent. His instincts flared up at the smell, something had to be wrong he thought worried and entered the room with a small, unknowing whine.
Steve nearly howled at being addressed properly once again and as a reward quickly pulled down the Omega’s pants with one hand to take the smaller cock into his hand, stroking the warm, slick flesh leisurely. The mewl he received was to die for. Though, truthfully, every sound Tony made like this was to die for.
The Alpha growled playfully at the reaction, carefully placing his hands on the man’s waist, squeezing the flesh lightly.
A few moment passed with no one speaking in the room, not daring to rile the now purring Alpha up once again.
Of course teenagers having secrets wasn’t anything new. Hell, Tony still had his oldest pup, who was probably onto something that very second, the troublemaker he was and the man loved to pieces.
Steve looked at Peter with a shrug and nodded at the teacher, who was already pulling out sheets of paper, probably to be signed by the hero.
“Be quick, you only have-”, she looked at her watch and yelped as she saw the time. “20 minutes Tony!!”
Tony quirked his eyebrow at the two but didn’t say anything, just hoping his pup wouldn’t rope Steve into any trouble and got back to cursing at the stove, not noticing the tense look Harley had on his face beside the fridge.
Though, the only person currently sitting in the living room was no other than Tony’s youngest pup, Peter, who was playing some sort of video game on the TV. And due to his angry shouts Steve guessed he wasn’t doing so well.
The first thing Steve did when seeing the Omega walk towards him was die a little on the inside. Whatever the man did Steve wouldn’t have thought the Omega could look any more beautiful than he normally did,, but this, the outfit nearly forced the blond into an asthma attack Something he didn’t get since the forties.
It’s been him and his pups for year, no intruders, no other family, just them. As much as Tony blamed himself for depriving his pups from growing up without a second parent, he was also kind of relieved sometimes. The possessiveness that boiled inside of his stomach was pretty much sated the whole time, as he knew that his pups would always rely on him and come to him if something was bothering them.
The short Omega was beautiful, stunning and looking as tasty as ever. Steve’s inner Alpha was preening in satisfaction, the Omega in front of him being perfect in every single way. His cock was rather short, but nothing out of the ordinary for a male Omega. Though, Steve was truthfully more focused on his behind, the firm round butt and his slick leaking, gaping hole.
Grasping the right side of the Omega’s waist with his hand that rested around Tony’s side a few seconds ago, the Alpha let out another growl and promptly lurched forward with his head, settling his nose against the smooth neck close to him. The smell, god, he couldn’t get enough.
Clint fucking Barton was sitting cross legged on the counter, plate in his left hand and muffin half eaten in his right. Steve wanted to scream at the sight.
Noticing the Alpha’s stare the archer gulped down the bite quickly and grinned at the man, who stood wordlessly across the room.
"Don’t bother Nat. When they’re in love mode everyone could sneak up on them, even an excited Thor freshly back from Asgard.", Clint sneered beside Natasha.
Steve’s thick long cock was proudly standing up already, head glistening with precum and Tony was nearly drooling at the sight. Yeah, Steve certainly wasn’t small and the Omega just loved that. Slowly he sat up and moved closer not retracting his eyes for one moment, while he could feel the blond’s gaze on him.
his mind and mostly his stomach were still bugging him, but honestly, how could Tony leave his kids like this. Breakfast clearly had to wait, at least until all of them were truly awake and able to produce more than a few sentences.
When they reached their home Steve parked the car in the garage once again and got out of the vehicle quickly to open the door for Tony once more. After all the date wasn’t over yet and the Alpha loved acting around the Omega like that, his instincts guiding him.
“I made this for you and I’d be honored if you could accept it”, Steve explained carefully, trying to keep his scent calm and collected, not wanting to scare the Omega even more. Even though he was so sure of the gift this time, somehow it still didn’t work out like he wanted to.
The other man stared at the strong hand in front of him, the hand that has touched him already in the most intimate way. He sighed internally, just wanting it to be over with now and slowly placed his hand onto Steve’s. “Sure, whenever you’re ready”.
The slap to his butt was worth it if you asked Tony. Though his pleading was successfully after all, feeling the hot tongue retreating from his ass and another pair of hips lining up with his rear. He it comes, he thought blissfully, already gripping the sheets for sheer support.
“Steve, you’ve already seen me come in my pants, if this isn’t the moment to be bold I don’t know what is,” the Omega whimpered as another load of slick wet his bottom.
Curiously he picked a black shirt from one of the many piles around the Omega, holding it in front of his face he noted the mostly faded print by now, an indication of one of the many old band T-shirts he owned and loved. A smile spread on his face, the shirt was perfect for the date he was going to ruin anyway, a once in the life time date with Steve Rogers. Not too loose but not too tight fitting it was comfortable enough, now Tony just had to find a nice pair of pants to-
A few minutes passed with none of the men saying anything. Though Steve’s arm was getting heavy and Tony was starting to sweat from nervousness.
With that Steve quickly placed Tony down on the duvet beside him, placing the blanket over the tiredly watching Omega before spooning up behind him, right arm circling the man’s waist and face close to Tony’s brown locks. Sighing into the pleasant smelling hair Steve couldn’t stop the constant grin on his face.
The Alpha raised an eyebrow at the statement, looking as ridiculous as ever with the bed head he was sporting, blond hair sticking up in every direction. Tony couldn’t help the small grin that grew on his face at the sight of the blond, trying to look all serious but getting betrayed by his surprisingly cute appearance.
Tony fidgeted, a little overwhelmed with how sweet Steve was. Sometimes he just got so caught up in his own pride that he forgot how nice it was to have his super soldier here to take care of him.
"That's not what I want from him dammit!" Silence. Tony knew that Rhodey was grinning. He did not want to actually see the smile, so he stood straight once more and huffed. "Fine. I'll do it myself. Thanks a lot sugar bear, knew I couldn't count on you." Before Rhodey could talk him down (as if he even would), Tony was out the door and headed straight for the all too familiar office. He'd been there a time or two, and not just to catch up. On some of his lower nights, Bruce had pulled him into the office and made him sit until he sobered up some. Tony was never sure if he was comfortable here, or if he just felt like a kid in a Principal's office everytime he crossed the threshold.
"Why do you have to say it like that? It's absolutely not what you're making it out to be." If Tony didn't sound at all convincing, it was because even he was having trouble lying to himself these days.
The concept of sex with Steve had definitely crossed Tony's mind a time or two. He would be a shitty liar if he even tried to say it hadn't. Steve was so attractive, and deeper than that, he was an incredible person who Tony definitely had some feelings for. But Tony liked the bachelor lifestyle. Kind of. Even if lately he spent more nights hanging out in Steve's apartment than bedding strangers, even if he preferred eating the home cooked meals Steve insisted on making ("You order food too often," he'd argued with Tony) to dining with beautiful men and women who he wouldn't want to see again. Fuck.
Tony had a lot to think about after that. That was a heavy dose of advice. Steve and Bucky, they seemed like they knew all about the perfect moments. Tony could only hope one day he’d know what Bucky meant.
"I don't know, I didn't get a menu," Steve replied. Tony rolled his eyes and handed one over. "Good to see the service is still terrible. You're lucky the MacKinnon's are too nice to fire you."
Steve watched him go, completely aware of the goofy grin on his face and absolutely uncaring of how ridculous he must look.
After deciding that he'd probably see more of Tony now, especially if he kept breaking in, Steve figured he might as well get to know him. "I work at the museum." There was maybe a little too much excitement in his tone. "The art branch."
"I hope I wasn't just the weird serial-break-in-neighbor?" Tony pressed, but before Sam could get any further Steve was clearing his throat and pointing towards a table.
"Jerk," Tony squeaked at him, and then dropped his head into his hands. He hated when Steve was right. He'd known last night- when they stopped arguing- that he'd have a sore throat today. It was why he'd said so little when they went to bed. He was hoping to fix the situation before Steve caught on. Too little too late now, wasn't it?
Steve also became increasingly aware of the fact that Tony was having less and less one-night-stand problems. He couldn't bring himself to ask if it was because Tony simply wasn't bringing people home, or if he'd settled down with someone. He didn't want to know. Okay, that was complete bullshit. He just.. didn't want to admit he wanted to know. The chemistry between him and Tony was definitely there, even if Steve was doing his best to ignore it.
To get the message across, Tony leaned up and tugged at Steve's shirt until the man relented from sucking Tony's nipple and broke away. The shirt came free, and Steve laughed at Tony's whispered, "Fuck yeah!" There was passion and fire between them, but not so much that they were able to hide some of the nervousness they both posessed. Tony wasn't stupid, and he didn't think Steve was either. A lot was going to change after this.
It had been so stupid. Tony was cranky, his latest science-binge was not going well. Dum-E had just poured scalding hot coffee all over Tony's crotch and for some god awful reason one of the speakers wasn't working correctly. The bass sounded way off, and that threw off the ACDC Tony had been trying to enjoy. One of those days where anything that could go wrong, had gone wrong, and now Tony was throwing things.
It was comfortable. Steve, Bucky, Tony, chatting like Tony wasn’t in the middle of a shift. Never once did he feel like he should take for granted the warmth they afforded him, the way that they invited him into their night for conversation and laughter and soft teasing. Tony would like to call them his friends, if he didn’t only see them a few times a year and know nothing more about them than the fact that they had a romance of epic novel proportions. It was good. It was wholesome.
Steve offered his own broad smile at this, and leaned down to kiss Tony's lips once more before breaking his grip all together.
"Slow down," Tony said, tugging Steve back a bit using the man's grip on his wrist. Steve looked worried, like maybe Tony was going to deny him a dance, and all the brunette could do was smile. Steve would worry about something so ridiculous. "I'd rather walk with you than have Bruce worry that you're dragging me outback to beat my ass for making a move." He nodded towards the door, where Bruce was chatting with one of the bouncers.
For a moment Tony was shocked into silence- and hey, Steve deserved applause for that right? But then there was a goofy grin on his face (uh, no, Tony would later insist it was a really seductive and attractive and manly and... just not goofy!) and he was reaching up to tug Steve down to him.
Part of him wanted to call the police immediately. He had proof right here. A note! Handwriting, finger prints. So how he ended up knocking on 6E's door minutes later was something Steve often looked back on and wondered about. What had he been thinking? There he was, clutching the note which he'd found taped to his door as if this was the most logical thing for him to do.
It was a Saturday night and Steve was just about to call Tony when there was a knock at the door. Which meant it definitely couldn't be Tony. Knocking just wasn't a thing for his quirky neighbor.
Steve switched on the light and deposited Tony on the chair, moving to unbutton his own shirt. Tony huffed and made grabby hands, but Steve just chuckled.
Notice anything new about your door? Besides the note. That's right, you have a new door handle! Why? Because the old one was way too easy to break into, and we just can't have that. Don't worry, I didn't steal anything. In fact, as you can see, I replaced the only thing I broke. To be fair, it only broke because of faulty production- you should really be thanking me for breaking in. Imagine if someone bad had done it. Anyway, the point is. I had a crazy one night stand pounding on my door and needed a place to hide. I'm really sorry it was your place but I remember that time I dropped that box on your foot. You apologized to me. It was totally my fault. So I figure you're a nice guy. I'm sorry, this is long, isn't it? I had a lot of time to kill. What the hell are you even doing that has you away this long? Alright, in closing. I got you a new door handle which means new keys. Come up to apartment 6E and pick them up.
Rhodey gripped his shoulders, looking him in the eyes. "Tones. C'mon man, don't do this to yourself. I'm sure Steve'll tell you if he wants to. You shouldn't ask, though."
"Stevie's not going to be one of your one night stands." It wasn't a question. It was a very, very firm statement, and Tony nodded vigorously. "Because the thing is, Stevie is our boy. He's sweet, he's handsome, and he's the sort of bleeding heart that guys like you could eat for dinner. But you seem like you've got a real good head on your shoulders, so I'm sure you understand that eating him alive would essentially ensure that me, Nat, and Sam here would beat you senseless if you hurt our boy."
Tony had asked him when he was seventeen, after seeing them three more times that year, why he stuck to jobs like that- not to be rude, but because he was curious- and Bucky had grinned and wiggled his fingers.
"That's not even a little surprising," Tony said with a grin. Steve looked almost like a kicked puppy, and so Tony quickly held up a hand. "Not a bad lack of surprise, don't worry. There's like this whole retro vibe going here, and then the art everywhere. I don't know, it just makes sense to me. Huh. Never thought to check out our art museum. You give tours?" Steve's nod earned a bright smile. "Well then I guess I'll have to swing on by and take a look."
Cue Steve. Big, dumb, beautiful, wonderful- okay, no, just Steve. He'd been away on some super special secret mission with Natasha and honestly all he wanted to do was drag Tony to bed. What happened once they got to the bed was honestly free to the imagination. Point is, he was tired and a little sore, pent up from a few nights on his own, and overall not thinking when he entered the lab and actually turned off the music.
Steve wondered what sort of things Tony had gotten up to when he was tired of Netflix. Wondered where he'd sat, what things he'd touched. It was strange to think he was okay with this situation, with a stranger in his home, and honestly he couldn't explain why. Maybe it was because there was something incredibly non-threatening about his neighbor. The worst thing he could imagine Tony doing was peeking around in the bathroom for toilet paper.
Calling them regulars might have been too much. Bucky and Steve weren’t the sort to come into the diner once a week, if only because they didn’t really have that sort of money. Steve was nineteen, working through art school, and Bucky’d been working through different warehouses to secure experience and one day become a foreman.
"Hey Tony." There was something thick about Steve's tone, and the small smile he offered wasn't like any Tony had ever seen on his face. Dread filled the pit of his stomach, but he didn't know how to ask. Something awful had happened, he was sure of that. But Tony didn't know what. He couldn't imagine a horrible break up, but for a moment he contemplated if he should give that praying thing a shot. The alternatives were awful.
"That one that talks! And has a supposed personality!" Steve's excitement over the product had Tony laughing, and he watched as Steve fought to contain himself. "Tony that's amazing. I never really understood how that thing works, but I've always wanted one."
That wasn't the end of the shenanigans for the day. There was lunch, which was pretty uneventful. Everyone had worked up an appetite. Natasha took the opportunity to lay in the sun while Clint went to climb on submerged rocks down the beach, and Bruce explained Earth's sea creatures to Thor. Tony was about to flop down for a nap and some needed sun when he caught sight of Steve.. building a sand castle.
"You know no one ever believes me when I tell them its your fault." Tony was trying to be good about this. This was a fairly important get together. Something about money, and donations, he was sure of it. "They always just roll their eyes."
Completely spent, Tony melted into the sheets and Steve rolled out of him, collapsint at his side. For a moment all they could do was breathe. Tony turned his head, staring at this beautiful man in his bed.
"Anthony," Steve tried again, this time at least getting a scowl. But Tony went right back to sucking on that popsicle, and Steve found himself steadily becoming distracted with it. No, wait, there was a real problem here!
Tony knew, of course, that there were well over a billion stars. Infinite, even, some would argue. But billion seemed like such a smaller amount than infinite, and Tony needed to imagine there weren't much more than that. Because Tony still remembered being up there. Feeling the cold over take him. Feeling the world slip away, knowing that his last moments would be spent surrounded by darkness and stars. Tony didn't take the time to look at the stars anymore because all they did was remind him how close he'd come to floating through them, lifeless, until he collided with a planet and rotted away.
"Steve, looks like Stark went to see a doct-" Natasha entered the kitchen, only to find that Tony was here. "Oh, good. You found him. Thanks for calling off the search."
"Will you can it and carry something Stark?" Clint demanded, jogging to retrieve the ball and stick it back in the basket he'd been carrying. "We're at the beach, not creating your newest source of unnecessary income."
Steve shook his head, tried to crack a smile and failed. "I wanted to be here tonight," he admitted, and Tony didn't dare interrupt. "I wanted to be here a lot of nights. I wanted things to feel normal. Everyone keeps telling me that I have to just do things to feel... But I don't think I would have come in if you hadn't come outside."
to you, who cooked from the heart and who’s adorable young husband had really brought perfection to the baked goods here. Tony was banking on them opening a secondary spot, a bakery, one day and he would honestly fund it if Domitus MacKinnon would just promise him free dessert for life.
"It's really worth it," Steve assured him, and Tony laughed at the enthusiasm. Steve would later insist that was absolutely not a blush on his cheeks, and Tony would only bring it up twice.
"Steve has told me all about you," Same piped up, and as Bucky smirked Natasha smacked each upside the head. Tony's heart leapt a little. His friends knew about Tony. Good. That was good, that was.. irrelevant. This wasn't..
Steve grinned at this, and leaned in for a lighter kiss than what they'd had in the club. This was.. well, it was tender, and Tony reveled in it. He had known exactly what to do when Steve was trying to tongue fuck his mouth, but this? This was really interesting territory. He hadn't wanted to be tender with someone in a good while. But with Steve's lips carefully caressing his own, all he could think to do was lean in and cup his cheek.
"Come on, I can handle a loss, but that scowl on his face?" Steve replied, and Tony tried to ignore the way that warmth shot up his spine. Steve liked his face without the scowl, then?
Tony was touched. Honestly. It wasn't like Steve had known- Tony had given him no indication that he was recovering. It was moments like these that Tony found himself truly thankful that he'd had a crazy one night stand waiting for him that first night he'd broken into Steve's apartment. It had been the best decision he'd ever made, and hello, he'd invented something.
"So I’ll tell them," Steve offered, nipping the assaulted ear now and carefully untucking Tony’s shirt.
Steve knew he should probably leave well enough alone, but come on, how often did he have a chance to tease a silent Tony?
The closet was more like it’s own room, of course. Tony had a lot of clothes. A lot of shoes. A lot of ties, and non-mechanized suits, and basically just a lot of things in general. Steve’s favorite part of the closet was Tony’s silk collection. Steve had his own personal kinks too, after all.
Steve just grinned, coming to a pause now that they were in the tangle of bodies on the dance floor. One hand went to Tony's hip to pull them a little closer together, staring down at the man with an expression that left Tony wondering. What was going through that mind?
He had a bit of a reputation, after all. He could whisper sweet nothings to Steve now but.. well, their first fight, Steve might worry. Nope, he needed a grand gesture. He broke away from the kiss, but not Steve's grip on his hips, to start pondering that when suddenly Tony was the one being caught off guard by a pair of lips.
"You've got it bad man," Clint commented with a sigh, causing both super soldier and genius to glance in his direction. Clint didn't seem to want to elaborate, though, and Natasha promptly grabbed him by the wrist to drag him towards the ocean. Tony didn't ask why, silently thanking her for taking him away before he could say anything more.
Tony held the door for Steve, following him inside and after a moment of thought flipping over the closed sign. They didn't need any more guests tonight. He would have absolutely followed through on closing up if Steve hadn't been the one to show up. Tony didn't have to be the genius that he was to tell that Steve really needed this, for whatever reason. He watched him freeze in his place and seem to consider as he stared at the booth he usually sat in. With Bucky. After a moment Steve finally made his decision, wandering over to the booth and taking a seat. Tony looked to Rhodey, who wore sympathy on his face as he set to making Steve's glass of Pepsi. Steve had once confided that he didn't often drink soda, but their trips to the diner were meant to be a special treat, so why not?
"Absolutely gorgeous," Steve whispered in Tony’s ear, reaching his own free hand up to grip Tony’s chin, tilting his head to nip at his neck. "Look at you Tony, god why didn’t you ask for this sooner?"
"Forgot you- well it's been put to good use for this month at the very least." This got a laugh, and silence fell for a short period while both drank.
"Listen it sounds horrible I know," Steve cut in, not wanting a lecture. "But he fixed my door handle after that, got me a better lock, and started coming here to escape his one night stands when they-"
This chapter is kind of heavy, but I think that's kind of the mood from here on in. I promise a happy ending, but there's a lot of development and whatnot that's got to happen, y'know? Steve's going through a LOT right now, and I plan to get into all of that in the next chapter! I'm actually thinking it's going to be his POV but I'm not positive yet.
Nearly an hour later, and Tony was getting antsy. He'd gathered the group back together, and everyone seemed to get on just fine. Clint and Natasha were swapping stories, Rhodey was discussing the armed forces with Steve, Bucky, and Sam, and Tony.. well Tony was watching and enjoying. There had been the occasional drink offer, but Tony had been on this sobriety kick for a while now. As much as he had wanted to say yes to each, he was at a comfortable point where he knew when and how to say no. Now was a good time for that, not only because he had a group of friends ready to jump him upon sight of a glass in his hand, but because if he wanted this thing with Steve to work he couldn't have a glass of liquid courage to spurr him on. As rare of a thing as it might be, Tony Stark wanted to be sober when he finally fell into bed with a gorgeous blonde man.
"You've been breaking into my apartment whenever you please, and you're going to keep your middle name a secret?" Steve lifted an eyebrow, but Tony didn't seem to want to budge.
"Tony it is," Steve replied, offering his hand. "Steve Rogers. Gonna tell me about the E or should I just guess?"
"Hey!" Tony snapped, rubbing the offended spot just as they stepped out into the hallway and almost walked into Clint. He had a look on his face, and Tony groaned, because he was about to be sandwhiched into a lecture and he was so not about that right now. "Listen. I know. I know it was stupid, I know it wasn't my best idea, but Steve asked me out. I mean, he asked me to come meet his friends. At a bar. And I agreed before he said at a bar, because-"
Steve knew Tony pretty well by now. Maybe he'd missed out on the star thing, but that was because even he couldn't know every thing that Tony tried to hide. He'd picked up on some of the minor ones, but he could only be expected to do so much. They'd been together for a whopping three months so Steve felt he had a decent excuse for still learning some of Tony's quirks.
For a moment the room was quiet, Tony giving Steve a moment to collect himself. He couldn't imagine what it was like, couldn't begin to grasp it, and didn't want to say he did. In fact, he was pretty sure this was where he was supposed to leave.
"You’ve got to be kidding me!" Tony shouted. "I told you! Steve! I said it didn’t I? You’re gonna tell them, right? You’re gonna tell everyone it was you?"
Steve laughed deeply. “I’m fine, thank you. And well, it’s not a lie if I say without you on the field it’s just not the same, at least for me.”
The boy, in question, at first didn’t react at all, way too concentrated on his webs to be paying any attention to the adult in the room. Though, a loud cough, thanks to Steve, pulled the teen from his deep thoughts.
The adults, even though completely drained of energy, smiled at the boy’s now calm faced, though let out a relieved sighed.
The black pants fit perfectly as well and shaped his ass in a way Tony hasn’t seen in some time, his omegan curves highlighted stunningly and in a teasing manner.
The brown haired boy didn’t quite catch the sentences directed at him at first, content to bury his face into his mother’s stomach again while letting out a string of small, high pitched, whines. Noises typical for an awakening pup, full of annoyance but satisfaction nevertheless. Yet, after a while of Tony raking his hand through his hair and Harley smiling down at him, having rested his head on the older Omega’s shoulder again, Peter bleakley opened his eyes.
Peter was blindly obvious to his situation and just hoped they’d be sated with throwing insults at him.
Peter scratched his head dumbfounded while Harley just crossed his arms and shrugged his shoulders as if he didn’t have anything to do with the mess around the living room.
Tony, on the other hand, smiled at both his pups, taking in the positive scent coming from both of the young boys. This was one of the few things he didn’t fuck up over time, no matter how messy the start was, and the man was gonna make sure it’s going to stay like this.
As long as his pups were alright, the omega kept repeating in his head. His extreme worrying was probably because he didn’t have an Alpha in his life, according to Pepper. Which, okay yeah, admittedly she could be onto something there the older Omega noted but it’s wasn’t something he’d like to think about. An Alpha mate. And only one name came to his mind when he thought of a mate.
“It’s probably from the grocery store, Thor’s purchase if I had to guess. Guy loves sweet stuff”, Tony explained. “Now put it away or so help me you two will live of vegetables the rest of your lives!”
Nudging his pup in the direction of his older brother, making sure the young Omega wasn’t left alone, Tony faced the scene. Both Alphas were now only a few feet away from each other, not as much of a distance Tony would have hoped for.
Tony already damned himself if this would turn out being a mistake, but his mind was set now regardless.
The Alpha was looking at him with hopeful eyes clearly waiting on an answer. And Tony, well, his mind was in pieces. One part of himself screamed at him to run and hide, not worthy enough to date the Alpha and far too messed up to be the Omega mate of someone like Captain America.
The others, including Steve, looked at the grumpy ex-assassin dumbfounded until the laughter started from anew. The blond Alpha bending over and slapping his knee due to the hilarious situation.
As the Omega was cautiously retrieving the gift and losing the threads that held the bag together gently, the other man was holding his breath in anticipation, waiting for Tony’s reaction with attentive eyes.
A moment later the waitress returned to their table with the drinks and took their food orders at the same time. The beta beamed at the two men at the table, obviously having noticed who she was serving tonight and by the looks of it the night was quite serious. A date she giggled internally as she wrote down the orders for the two heroes.
“Yes”, the young Alpha forced out through his teeth and watched his arriving brother uninterested. Tony squeezed his shoulders in affirmation with a worried smile before turning slightly just in time to catch his other pup, who was smiling from ear to ear at his mother, oblivious to the tension and unnatural strong Alpha scent coming from his brother.
Not wanting to listen to anymore speculation Steve stood up easily, walking to the door Tony disappeared through a few moments ago. “Please make sure Mom’s alright,” Harley’s voice stopped him.
Maybe he should get Steve a gift as well. Just to change some things up, not as traditional, but the genius really just wanted to give something back, to show his appreciation. Steve has done a damn lot since they started this whole thing and it was starting to weight on Tony’s conscience.
“Speak up, Omega. Tell me what you want, what you really crave!”, the blond hollered with a few more aggressive trusts.
Used to the awed expression of people meeting him for the first time, though, a class of thirty students did not have the same effect at all.
After a few moments though they accidentally nudged Thor, who was still sat at the counter just finishing his breakfast. The god now ridden with energy jumped up excitedly and with not even straining a single muscle, lifted all three of them up in the air.
Jason only rolled around on the floor with a bared neck and wide eyes but did not answer the Captain.
Ned, who was still asking a now tired looking Steve about his life and more, quickly ran the other way though when he saw the time. “Sorry Captain! Responsibilities call but we can keep on talking later!”
God, he felt like such a bad mother lately. Actively seeing somebody sure did take up a lot of time, time the Omega usually spend working or with his two kids. So they just had to feel neglected lately, Tony was positive. Even though Harley and Peter were both growing up steadily - god did time pass quickly- they still relied an awful lot on their mother.
The boy in question didn’t seem to hear the man and continued to try sipping his coffee. Tried being the keyword, as he kept burning his mouth, gasping loudly and then repeating the process.
A loud sneeze interrupted the man suddenly. The Omega was sneezing loudly, not seeming to stop all of sudden.
The Omega’s head snapped up, throat bared in submission, a whimper leaving Ton’s lips while his mind screamed at him to obey. Fuck his damned Omega nature. There was no possibility of escape now, he was completely at Steve’s mercy.
Tony, on the other hand, didn’t even notice being lifted up at first, still on his phone texting Pepper about an important appointment. But as he felt the soft yet firm surface of his lover underneath him, he instantly grinned cheekily and let himself fall into him.
The reaction that followed was worth it all. Clint erupted into laughter at the butthurt look on Captain America’s face, like a scolded dog who just got caught chewing on his owner’s favourite pair of shoes. Who knew a super soldier could look as regretful and apologizing, mirroring the look on the pup’s faces whenever they caused trouble.
Without answering the kid’s question the Omega crossed the room and quickly threw his arms around the kid, taking in the calming Alpha scent, the feeling of home and pup getting him to let out a few deep purrs.
His maternal instincts kicked in at the scene unfolding. His pup was in danger, his brain kept screaming at him. Challenging an older Alpha ranked way higher than Harley was dangerous and so, so stupid. The distressed Omega mother could only watch in fear.
Bruce furrowed his brows. “Not likely, needing to use the bathroom doesn’t usually make you curse like crazy.”
Blue eyes meet brown at the statement as Tony nodded at the box and scooted closer with his chair towards the wide eyed Alpha.
The man growled in satisfaction and the Omega reacted swiftly, bearing his neck voluntarily, true to his submissive position in that moment. The Omega accepted the Alpha as a heat mate.
Just like that everything from the previous day came rushing back to the Omega. The date, the Alpha’s mannerism, his own confession about his past, Steve not backing down even then and finally, the night they spend together. He had sex with Steve fucking Rogers, Captain America, once again! Tony winced at the realization and damned his horny Omega brain consequently.
“Omega, you’ll get your reward. But first present for me, show me that greedy hole of yours,” Steve ordered with a steady voice, Alpha voice close to the surface.
Well, guess it’s gonna be another all nighter, he thought bitterly. He, truly, just wanted to spend time with both men, this sucked.
Steve was in heaven. Truly the taste that flooded his mouth and the scent clocking his nose as his tongue licked into the inviting hole in front of him, were intoxicating. He couldn’t get enough.
The blond Alpha squeezed right back and gazed at the shorter man in adoration. “I’m glad, Tony, I really am.”
Did he mention the shirt he was wearing? Because, yeah, skin tight shirts should truly be illegal at this point before Tony acted on his instincts all over again.
“To be completely honest I do miss my old friends and the many people that I will never see again but without me having been frozen in the ice I wouldn’t have been able to meet all my current friends, the people I love in this time.”
“Well look around us! My suit won’t work with those webs all over the place!”, Tony complained, crossing his arms with a pointed look at the blond.
Peter was amusingly watching the stumbling Alpha, who kept his eyes traced on the ground and scent with a strong bitter hint.
“Alright kiddos but first let’s get some food into the both of you since I’m guessing you haven’t eaten anything proper all morning”, the Omega said eyeing his pups, who now stood in front of him with downcast eyes. Yeah, he totally guessed right. “And why the hell did I step on a freaking lego brick? As far as I know we haven’t owned any since you declared the bricks boring and wanted to play around with real tech instead.”
Now that put a smile on the teen’s face. The project he worked on for four days straight was due today.
Though, the questioning look from across bore through the man with a sting and he obviously had no other choice.
“It’s nothing”, Steve answered immediately, casting a cheeky look at the Omega with a strained neck. Yeah, the position they were in really wasn’t made for holding a conversation.
Tony’s purrs halted to a stop as his ears picked up the feral sounding growls coming from his neck all out of the blue. His pup, was tightening his hold while his scent turned into a bitter, pissed off smell. What the? The Omega looked at the child confused, but pressed himself closer nonetheless. Stroking through his blond locks with one hair and purring once again while rubbing his head lovingly against the Alpha’s scent glands Tony hoped it would calm the growls down to a certain degree.
The other man was close to sobbing at the feeling of bliss and belonging. The arm around him, Steve’s presence made him feel special and safe, so safe. He needed more. “Fucking knot me, you knothead!”
“Mom!”, the young Omega whined, only half audible due to the unchewed food in his mouth. Swallowing the piece of meat in one go the boy smiled up at his Ma, reaching out a hand and clasping his fingers around the older Omega’s wrist. “The food’s nearly gone and you still haven’t eaten!”, Peter whined worriedly. “And besides Aunt Tasha wants to see you.” Pulling his startled father along, he cast a short glance to the tall Alpha standing in the hallway with them, eyes gleaming challenging.
The genius was winning against the young Omega and Alpha, laughing loudly and joyfully, happy Omega scent flooding the room.
“You were lucky Steve isn’t a total stranger, because a strange Alpha sure would have charged at you without another thought”, the worry in his voice was prominent and hitting Harley head on, making him feel even more sheepish than before.
“But you know what the parents get up to when the kids are asleep?”, Steve asked with a glint in his eyes, rocking his hips up in the process, hardness brushing Tony at the same time.
The Alpha, in fact, just rolled his eyes lovingly at the sight in front of him, being used to Peter’s uncoordinated movements when half asleep. Even got a few bruises because of it a few times, but Harley wasn’t one to bear a grudge, not in case of his younger brother that is. Though teasing surely was allowed in his books.
Both men, after cleaning up, disappeared into the living room, wanting to watch a movie the rest of the evening. And Peter desperately wished he could join them, but he only had until the morning left to finish the school project and, well, he had no other choice.
Now Tony only had to deal with Steve, alone, in close proximity. Great, swell, everything Tony would have wanted after the awkward act of him escaping after they spend his heat together.
Rhodey sighed with a light laugh and faced the other Alpha in the room. “Cap”, he nodded in greeting.
However, Steve was pointedly ignoring the growing hardness close to him and rather cocked the man’s head to the side, purring in satisfaction at what he saw. No marks, no bruises and most importantly no mating bite. The Omega hasn’t been taken yet. Steve wanted to howl with joy. Now, Tony was his for the taken.
The pup, even though he acted the way he did at home, hated attention at school due to his family name and the other students who thought he was just a snotty and spoiled brat, smarter than everyone and damn annoying. He was glad he did have a few friends, Ned and MJ, who were outsiders themselves and didn’t give a damn about his background. Yet, the comments and glares got to him.
On the third day though Tony woke up, feeling as normal as ever. Well, except the cum that was pooling out of his hole steadily and the warm, strong arms around his waist.
Stopping right between Steve’s legs the Omega leaned down shortly. The spicy scent of Steve’s raising arousal hit his nose straight on, their pheromones mingling together due to their closeness. And like that he placed small licks over the still clothed bulge in the Alpha’s scent, making him groan in anticipation.
“If you’re really doing what I think you’re doing I swear to god Tony you better stop this childish act now”, she said exasperated.
Tony was in a familiar state, the combined pheromones acting like a drug and spurring him on to the edge. “I’m close, Alpha”, he admitted with another mewl as he pulled off from the thick cock for a second.
“Without the Omega you’ve been calling all those vile words, you wouldn’t even be alive right now, do you understand boy? Tony Stark flew a nuke into space to safe everyone, even your sorry ass of an Alpha,” Steve growled and squatted down beside the trembling boy.
Happy looked at both of them intensely before shaking his head wordlessly, clearly expressing his disappointment. “Whatever, just don’t mention my name when Tony finds out about this.”
Harley, the young Alpha, still on the blink of reaching his true Alpha status, was growling fiercely at Steve. The actual act looked pretty cute Tony noted, his son pulling his lips in a mocking snarl and emitting a warning scent from his scent glands, signaling for the other Alpha to back off. A pup trying to protect its mother.
And he was prepared, having picked out a gift that wasn’t edible this time, having learned from the situation with Clint. Leaving food out in the open with hungry heroes roaming the building truly wasn’t the smartest idea, the blond admitted.
“You know, considering everything, this could have turned out much worse.”, Steve’s calm voice sounded off. And was that, amusement seeping through his words? The Steven Grant Rogers being amused at a sight like this, a completely trashed room. Tony was sure he wasn’t drunk, perhaps his morning coffee got spiked as well.
Then the car was already off again and leaving both standing in front of the school, one wearing a grin and the other looking worriedly at the building.
“You better have a good excuse for the fact that it’s nearly noon and none of you have eaten anything sooner,” the low threatening voice of Natasha reached the Omega’s ears.
The close touch to his back made goose bumps appear on the man’s skin. The hands were big and warm, the hands of his Alpha, as they wandered downwards, grasping his rear in a firm hold and presenting Tony’s gaping hole.
The Alpha retreated from the strong hug and placed her hands firmly on Tony’s shoulders, looking him up and down. “You’re not in heat yet.”
Two minutes later the bracelet was bound around Tony’s wrist and Steve was smiling happily at the man in front of him. Now just one more question.
Tony’s first date in roughly fourteen years and he was already failing at the simplest task there was when going on a date. At least he wasn’t alone, alone in the middle of the heaps of clothes laying around.
Tony sighed behind the menu and pulled the sheet down a bit to cast a look at the blond in front of him, eyes narrowing at the question. “Since it’s 7pm and I haven’t eating anything this evening, I’d say I’m rather hungry.”
Though working through his usual self worth issues, insecurities and anxiety Tony wasn't sure about anything going on at this point anymore. Mostly worrying about the well being of his pups, as much as figuring out why Harley was acting so different lately.
“Oh but I do”, Steve clarified. “Please accept this gift, Omega”, he tried once more, empathizing the Omega title this time, trying to convince the man’s stubborn nature. Couldn’t Tony see how he felt?
He carefully licked across the wet rim, the sweet omegan taste reaching his tongue as the man under him began to moan.
“Your pup must be okay with us dating or he wouldn’t have helped me like that, which means you don’t have to feel guilt in any way. You deserve to life your own life outside from your kids. It’s nothing shameful, Tony”, the blond carefully explained with another gentle rub to Tony’s hand.
Him and relationships just didn’t get along. Never before and Tony highly doubted this time would be any different.
His next plan, plan C as he liked to count, a bad idea according to Bucky, who said something about keeping count of his failed tries making him even more desperate.
You could miss the moments you were never able to experience as well as move on to something new entirely. As it was Steve lived in the present and the present gave him reasons to stay every day.
The blond dutifully, though with a constant grin on his face, freed the genius a few minutes later, the webs thankfully dissolving slowly, and placed a chaste kiss on his lips. “Gotcha.”, he smiled.
The sleepy man thanked Steve with a quiet mutter and tried to stand up, but before he could think about it a hand reached for his arm and he was hoisted up into a standing position, eyes blinking perplexed.
Maybe he should have stayed home he kept thinking as he slid down the wall with his knees pulled up and face now resting on his crossed arms. He let out a sigh and just wished for Steve to finally free himself from Mr. Johnson’s clutches so the day could be over sooner than later.
And Tony, well, he totally forgot everything around him as he relaxed into the hold of his boyfriend. Who could blame him?
The lunch they shared was, like expected, amazing. Steve really did went all out even if it was just supposed to be a small meal. Both sat close to each other at the small table in the kitchen, talking about the usual things, joking around and occasionally flirt in a teasing manner. It really did feel like nothing had changed between them.
Quickly he hoisted up the Omega into his arms and walked through the door of his bedroom, all while keeping a firm grip on the round ass in his hands. As soon as the door closed Steve placed the whining Omega down on his soft mattress, now looking down at the whimpering figure with a smirk.
Tony swiftly wrapped the boy up in his arms and scented him deeply, in hopes of his Omega scent calming the young Omega down. A smile graced his lips as Peter’s scent slowly changed back to its natural sweet cinnamon smell, yet throughout it all fast asleep.
With that they were off on the way to school, trying to maneuver through the horrible morning traffic of New York.
The young Alpha happily started purring as his mother trailed his hand up and down the pups back. Damn, was Harley a sucker for a good petting. The 14 year old arched up into the hand on his back, purrs getting louder as more seconds passed by and a relaxing scent mingling with the older Omega’s calm scent. Tony just smiled softly at his child.
Peter was, if Tony was being completely honest, a really bad actor. His pup, god knows why, never really learned how to lie or to cover something up without someone finding out. And, yeah sure, the responsible parental side of him was preening at the matter of fact but every other part of him was full on worrying.
In spite of everything, however, Thor simply loved getting in a fight. He treasured a challenge against another strong Alpha, especially against the team leader, whom, for the looks of it, was close to charging across the room without another care.
Right, Tony concluded. His teammates, who were away on a mission, were supposed to be back today. The mission he didn’t have to participate in due to him being an Omega close to his heat and, well, no one wanted a heat ridden teammate endangering a secret operation with his desperate moans and strong intoxicating scent.
Enjoy the new chapter and thank you all again for sticking with me, for your sweet comments and the many kudos <3
The teen didn’t even change his expression at the statement and simply kept on crawling around in the corner, creating his webs, but always keeping a close eye out for the adults.
Tony’s mouth formed an ‘O’ as his eyes rolled back into his head and he came on the spot, the thick dick penetrating his prostate spot on.
Though, when he asked Steve the Alpha quickly clammed up with a nervous stare and vanished from the room, like Tony had asked him about his genital hygiene. Rude for once and again damn suspicious.
The braided leather bracelet, made for him especially, was breathtaking and Tony’s mind always blanked when looking at it, which may have stalled his work process in the last days. But what was he supposed to do? Take the bracelet off? Even though it was selfish and stupid, so unbelievable stupid, the Omega couldn’t bring himself to take it off, not this, not the first courting gift he has ever received in his life. His instincts rioted at the mere thought of entwining the leather strings and losing the contact of of the smooth material, the traces of Steve’s Alpha scent stamped into the material, reminding Tony of the man wherever he went.
The genius squeezed his eyes shut, trying to hold in his tears. Why? Why did he always manage to fuck everything up! Now, the Avengers team will suffer from his horny choices.
“Mom, where were you after the date? We waited in the nest for you!”, the question coming from his youngest who was currently pressing his face against the man’s neck broke Tony’s heart somewhat. How selfish he was! His pups, they waited for him god knows for how long and what did Tony do in the meantime? Fuck Captain America.
Please leave comments and kudos if you liked the new chapter <3<3<3 it would mean a lot and keep me motivated!
Tony was dazely eyeing the Alpha, mind confused with want and anxiety at the same time, the overwhelming feeling making him see stars.
Tony could still feel the icy gaze of the Alpha as he informed him of his pregnancy, how he dropped the files in his hands and charged at him with dominance overthrowing the scent in the room. It wasn’t something the genius liked to remember.
As he reached the foot of the bed, right in front of the grinning, tall Alpha who now firmly fisted his cock in his hands, he reached out with a whine. His Omega instincts went wild once again.
Flowers it was this time and surely nothing was going to stand in Steve’s way, not even a hungry Avenger could ruin this present, he proudly purred as he stood in the ascending elevator on the way to Tony’s personal floor.
With a swift stride the Omega placed himself between the Alphas and emitted as much comforting scent as he could. The reaction was immediate. The growling halted to a sudden stop as did the dangerous snarls while both men stared at the sudden appearance of the short Omega, who was blocking the view with his distracting smell.
Steve smiled at the man politely and promptly stood up to offer the older man his hand in a greeting. “It’s nice to meet you Mr. Johnson, I hope you don’t mind me tagging along with Peter today, I’m part of his project,” the blond finished with a flashing smile, putting on his Captain America charm. Everything to keep the gruff teacher from scolding Peter one more time.
Steve listened to the shrieks and laughs coming from the kitchen and sighed deeply. Well, time for plan B.
Steve carefully took the bracelet from Tony’s hands and slowly unwind the two ends and gesturing for the Omega to hold out his wrist.
It was scary, or it would have been weren’t Tony occupied by the moans coming out of his mouth right now. The low grumbling and grunts sounding in his right ear, signaling the pleasure searching Alpha was just as affected as the genius was.
Sniffing the air curiously Tony could already smell the sizzling bacon from the hallway, making his stomach rumble hungrily. Another extra rumbles next to him confirmed the Omega’s suspicion, his pups obviously were desperately in need of nutrients.
To no one’s surprise the Alpha reacted instantly with a sharp slap to the Omega’s ass. The noise echoing in the room and Tony yelped at the impact, eyes closed but still releasing slick nonetheless.
“But promise we can all sleep in the nest tonight!”, Peter begged as he pulled away from the hug and beamed up at his mother. God, cuteness alarm Tony thought amused.
The Alpha, though was exceptionally gazing at the brown haired Omega. Did he say something wrong? Steve just wanted to help and, okay, maybe he had hoped for Tony to accept him as a potential mate so he could start courting him for real. But, now, Tony was just staring at the floor, sweat dripping down his neck, with flushed cheeks and a bulge still noticeable in his pants.
Tony winced as another wave of slick soaked his underwear, his hole close to hurting from being turned on so strongly. Damn, the Alpha in front of him. The genius has never reacted to someone this intense before.
Tony couldn’t believe the view in front of him. The Alpha greedily lapping his slick of his fingers, while letting out deep purrs. The Omega was close to howling.
Yeah, Steve wasn’t the best at baking, still, food was, if you asked him, one of the best courting gifts an Alpha could present. The edible goods a sign of being able to take care of the Omega, something Steve so desperately wanted to do with Tony.
“That’s good, meaning between the both of you you possess enough brain cells to clean this mess up before breakfast in fifteen minutes down in the common room”, the Omega smirked watching the amusement on his pups faces turn into disappointment. With that he made his way towards his bedroom in desperate need of a change of clothes.
So Tony, for the love of god, still couldn’t grasp why, of all the Omegas available, Steve chose him to ask on a date. And, most importantly, why the hell did Tony accept the Alpha’s offer just like that?
Turning around again the older Alpha gave the young one a calm smile. “I’m sure everything’s alright. I’m just going to bring him back, pup.”
Not because his AI alarmed him or Steve’s Super Soldier ass, who was asleep already snoring on the couch, sensed any danger.
The fed up Alpha scent thickened in the room the longer Tony didn’t  answer her, signaling his inner Omega to finally open his mouth and say something, anything really.
The two stood in a mess of feathers and dirt, while furniture was lying sideways around the room and kissed deeply. Tony’s arms came up to tuck at Steve’s hair sensually, yet also to try spurring him on to deepen the kiss and the blond eagerly complied, surrendering to the short brunette in his arms.
Tony didn’t wait one second and promptly licked across the glistening head, tasting the precum on his tongue, something he didn't get to do last time. Then he slowly lowered his mouth around the whole tip, moving his lips and tongue in a massaging manner. His hands travelled up the firm, muscled thighs of the Alpha and  finally settled on the base. With a tight grip he losened the Alpha’s own hands from around the cock and placed his around the girth instead, moving his hands up and down in a steady motion.
The genius turned sideways while losing the grasp on Pepper’s waist in the process and promptly caught the eyes of his eldest.
“Your move Captain,” Tony whispered huskily into the Alpha’s ear. “You have officially received permission to wreck me.”
Yeah no. Where was the strict Captain America, the guy from the videos he and Peter kept laughing at while a blushing Steve rolled his eyes at them.
As he opened the door he cast one last glance at the perfect specimen of Alpha snoring away in his bed and sighed sadly. In his dreams, he reminded himself and sneaked out of the door.
After the phone call Tony sighed tiredly. God, being a parent was exhausting, especially the constant worrying.
Yet, the calming purr of his mother settled his nerves, they weren’t in danger after all and Harley sighed in relief. You never know. Settling back down slightly, the boy moved closer to the older Omega and nuzzled the man’s neck in search of closeness. Harley treasured their Sunday rituals, waking up in his mother’s nest and just relishing in the comfort of family. The Alpha inside of him was the most content during that time, the one day of the week the family fell asleep in the familiar nest in the tower.
Muffled laughter, laughter he would always be able to recognize, reached his ear. Turning around, not sparing the dreamy Alpha in front of him another glance, the Omega marched up to the counter where his two delinquents were cackling like crazy.
Tony’s half hearted grip slipped and he watched as Pepper threw the pants into the corner of the room, disposing of the idea in Tony’s head. Of course. Pepper has known him too long to not look through him like that. She was very much aware of his insecurities and anxiety, which was probably why she was the one that demanded to help him today.
The Omega’s eyes widened once more at the Alpha’s words and he gulped audible. “You don’t mean that”. His Omega instincts were going crazy inside his head, making the man dizzy from its sheer pressure.
Though, Steve stays the perfect Alpha and gives him another, rather exciting and surprisingly kinky gift. Something Tony didn't know he was craving before.
was here, in his arms. He was safe and with Steve now, not with any other Alpha, but with Steve. The man wanted to howl, tough, rather pressed his nose even closer to the source of the perfect scent and let out a rumble instead.
Steve now looked up again from his hands tracing patterns on the deep brown wood of the table and looked at the speechless brunette across from the table, who left the menu laying beside his napkin on the table in disinterest.
At least Tony didn’t run off this time, the Alpha gleefully took in. It was an improvement from the last time they spend the night together, when Steve got stirred awake by his instincts howling at him and the stabbing pain in his chest making him feel the absence of his heat mate.
A few minutes passed with both of the Omegas embracing each other on the floor, a content Omega scent rising in the air. All while the two Alphas stood behind the pair, eyes traced on the ground, a guilty, bitter scent emitting from their scent glands. It was humiliating.
What was he supposed to do now? He was plainly aware that all of this was his fault, like usually. He was the one that kissed Steve in the elevator, which brought the following actions on and landed him in the bed of the respected Alpha. A very comfortable bed he noted.
Thankfully though Peter’s mind was bad at staying focused on one thing for too long, so a few minutes into the drive he was looking out of the window again and excitedly pointing out a few buildings he seemed interesting enough to direct Steve’s eyes at. Questions like ‘Was that building already there back in your days, Mr. Captain?’, ‘Do you know where the first Mc Donald’s opened in Manhatten?’ and ‘Even though Superheroes are a real life thing, isn’t it weird that cities are absent of any statues build in their honor? Wouldn’t you want a statue, Cap?’ soon followed the pup’s excitement. Steve was for all that mattered quite overwhelmed, but also so very fond of the curious nature of the child next to him as he tried to answer any single question he threw at him, while Happy occasionally let out a light chuckle.
They both smiled at each other sweetly. Steve shook his head in affection, taking Tony’s hand in his and squeezed it lovingly.
Around 3 am in the morning both, overly exhausted and panting heroes, got the kid down from the high ceiling and hugged the still rambling boy tightly. Content he was safe now, but mostly afraid he would run off again.
If the man found out Peter kind of blackmailed Captain America for his own personal advantages he’d sure be grounded for life. Or for till College according to his mother, he thought amused.
“The Stark men have finally arrived! Good morning my dear friends!”, the loud booming voice of the god of thunder hollered across the room from the couch. “Stunning Tony, mischievous Harley and clumsy Peter, how has life treated you lately?” The blinding smile from the blond stunned the three lightly, still, after these years, not having gotten used to the positive manner emitting from Thor.
“Sir, Agent Best Aunt is approaching the lab, which I’m pretty sure she is somehow able to enter even with the lack of a key.”
The genius smiled at her placing his hands above hers, his scent glands emitting a calming  omegan smell. “It’s fine Tasha, just a little later than usual I guess. And regarding breakfast, you know it’s nest Sunday,” Tony answered easily. “If anything it was the pups’ fault I couldn’t leave the nest sooner.”
The Omega moaned loudly, feeling slick escaping his hole and rubbing his growing erection against Steve’s leg, relishing in the simple pleasure it brought him. “Alpha”, he started and traced a hand up the man’s head, gripping his soft hair and making him look downwards into Tony’s eyes. “We already had sex you buffon, there’s no moving slow in that department.”
Like that both pulled apart, a light shade of red covering both their cheeks. Well, in Steve’s case his ears, a cute image if you asked Tony.
But now, looking at the man in front of him, the still potent Alpha scent tickling his nose playfully, Tony was getting bad ideas once again. And, yeah, his heat was very much over. So why was he acting like a virgin who’s just received a dick pic for the first time in life?
Before the soldier could advance one again though Tony stepped in and promptly took hold of the Alpha’s blond locks with his trembling hands and, without thinking about it, pressed the growling face against his neck, directly above his scent glands.
The man in the front just rolled his eyes fondly at the kid’s antics but didn’t say anything else. Oh and mentioning kids. “Anyway, where’s your brother, has he gotten lost on the way to the car once again?”
The booming voice of Thor filled the silence immediately. “You guys threw a party and didn’t think about inviting your friends? That’s certainly not an honorable way of celebration, you should be ashamed!”.
“Nah I’m good”, the man casually answered and shoved the last bit of courting present into his mouth, the sound of loud chews audible.
The other Alpha at the table reacted similarly, gripping the table even tighter and Tony could have sworn he heard a crack. But before Steve could open his mouth Tony continued.
And, wow. Tony, if he weren’t so worried by the statement, would have been in awe at how similar they were, because, damn it, he would have tried something like that too. Probably. Not around Steve, naturally.
A stare Peter has been the victim of quite a few times, however, that still didn’t mean he had gotten used to it.
“Good luck on your project,” MJ wished them with a small smile before walking towards her own class after lunch ended.
The Omega was sure this wasn’t healthy, another side factor of not having an Alpha by his side while his kids grew up. But he was trying, really he was. Since Steve was, kind of, courting him and clearly interested in the older Omega, he tried to be open minded. That their conversation was probably nothing serious.
Harley wasn’t normally this aggressive and easy to anger. What the hell triggered his pup like this.
Back in the kitchen Tony finally caught a glimpse of the chaos across the food ridden counters and in the middle of it all his oldest and the several aunts and uncles of his. Big families sure cause big messes the genius noticed.
Tony, still having his balled fists in front of his face, grimaced at the sudden intensified pressure against his side and the pair of blue eyes trained on his face. Too soon, fuck, he thought the man would be asleep longer, leaving enough time for Tony to calm down.
Moaning like the little slut in heat he was, Steve continued his spiel, tongue sneaking deeper and rubbing against his walls hotly. A mess of spit and slick was pooling out of the hole and creating a puddle on the bedding beneath them.
The other man shivered at the memory and placed his hands on the Omega’s hips, squeezing the skin slightly and growling into the Omega’s ear, scent clouding his mind. The scent of Omega sweetness. Though his mind kept screaming at him for another reason, clearing the blur for one second.
“Okay”, the boy simply answered, closing his eyes and blending out anything else that wasn’t his mother’s presence at the moment.
For once something was working out. Now he only had to face Tony and present his courting gift, in hopes of scouring a date in the end.
“You know I could help”, the Alpha informed the Omega for fourth time as he sat at the counter reading a newspaper, like the old fashioned fella he was.
Steve, for his part, couldn’t stop looking at the Omega, who now seemed to hold himself differently than before. More open, not as guarded and seemingly enjoying the night. The blond wanted to howl, he couldn’t believe Tony actually took a chance on them. Now it was the Alpha’s turn to not make him regret it, to make him see it could work out between them.
Natasha’s firm gaze across the room caught Steve’s eyes and he cocked an eyebrow in question. “You’ll see,” the female Alpha smirked.
However, a sudden ripping sound disturbed the sucking Omega shortly as he left out a mewl of confusion.
God, he hated it. The feeling that consumed him when a pup of his wasn’t alright. Tony couldn’t help himself. Even though his two pups weren’t small children anymore and rather teenagers, which Tony truthfully ignored most of the time out of pure angst his children one day might not need him anymore, he still babied them quite a lot.
Tony snorted at the cheesy answer but let the topic slide. If this was something you had to get used to when dating Steve, he’d gladly comply.
Tony standing with crossed arms beside Steve, who still to Tony’s admiration, had an arm around him, rolled his eyes fondly. “Thor, let me be frank when I say, that Steve and I never would have any intentions of throwing a party without you. How would I get Steve drunk without your help, anyway.”.
“What are you talking about?” the Alpha answered with furrowed eyebrows and confusion written all over his face.
“Steve?”, the sweet voice of his Omega caught his attention and made him look down at the pretty eyes trained on his face. The smile that grew on his lips at the sight of the perfect Omega quickly vanished as a sharp pain replaced his content state.
The moonlight from the tall windows graced the Omega’s face. Sweat glistening in the light, long eyelashes touching Tony’s reddened cheeks and puffs of air leaving his full lips, the man was a true symbol of beauty, Steve decided.
“What a sad fucking excuse of an Alpha”, the words of Steve sounded through the room, anger and ferocity present in only one mere sentence.
He didn’t plan on running into Steve only a few hours after his heat. A few hours after the Alpha fucked him full of his cum, marked him up and knotted his hole, like the heat struck Omega he was.
A sudden sigh from his left side got his attention quickly. “Uhh, I- uh,” the deep voice of Steve sounded off, nervousness clearly present.
Pepper’s eyes softened at the sight of the genius, who was looking at the wall behind her with a pained look, scent tinting bitterly. “Messed up or not Tony, you deserve to be happy and I can’t take it, you throwing something good away again out of fright”.
Tony was letting out small moans between the wet kisses on his neck. A hand slowly crept around his waist, sinking lower and finally settling on his ass to squeeze it playfully. Captain America really doesn’t do things halfway, Tony could ensure personally.
The Alpha nodded thoughtfully, before a gleam caught his eyes and a small smile began to form on his lips. “You know, the first time I’ve been to this place was back in the forties, though not literally this place since the original restaurant was placed in Brooklyn at that time”.
