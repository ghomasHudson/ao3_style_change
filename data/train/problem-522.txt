Oliver’s voice was raw and full of gravel, when he turned to John to say, “I don’t want to talk.”
John coughed and spit, his eyes pricking and his grip on the porcelain bowl knuckle-whitening. He took a deep shuddering breath, and squeezed his eyes shut, willing himself to stop thinking. Why did he think he could do this? Stupid. He couldn’t take care of a teenager. He couldn’t take care of
He threw off his covers and stumbled out of his room, down the stairs and crept through the dark sitting room, then kitchen. John gently pushed on Oliver’s already open door and looked in. The boy was sound asleep in his bed, the covers gently rising and falling with his breath.
First of all, I just have a few short things I'd like you to keep in mind while reading:
“Oliver, do you need me?” He asked hesitantly.
John almost laughed aloud at one of a stricken-looking Mycroft holding toddler Oliver out at arm's length, while Oliver was mid-laugh, covered in mud and leaves. By far the most interesting, John gently lifted off the wall to inspect. It had been taken without the subject’s knowledge. Oliver, a few years younger than he was now, sat across an empty table from Sherlock, who was younger and looked much more tired than John at ever seen him. They were staring intently at each other with passive, somewhat curious faces, as if they had never really seen each other before. Sherlock’s hair was longer in the photo and he wasn’t as impeccably dressed as usual. Oliver’s hair was a few shades lighter than now, and his head tilted slightly to the side.
John came home late that night, and Oliver had beat him there. Because of John’s extended lunch break, he had to make up an hour at the surgery, meaning he got home only a just before Oliver was supposed to help Emily with her studies.
Mycroft shook his head. “I apologize for the attitude, John. He’s going through a bit of a… phase.”
“I can send a copy of his new schedule home with him,” he said. “You’ll just need to sign the paper and send it back with him at the earliest convenience.”
John looked down at the notes all over the table. “The panic attacks haven’t happened this often in a long time.”
John nodded.
Oliver will be okay. They could fix this.
Oliver’s room was on the second floor towards the back, and when the nurse opened the door, John was glad to see Oliver awake. At the same time, it hurt. It hurt to see Oliver looking pale and breakable with dark rings under his eyes. He was looking out the window, and there was a big, blossoming bruise on his jaw. Despite the situation, and despite everything going on in their lives, it could have been a lot worse.
Again, he ran. Oliver had stopped moving right by the river, only a block away now. John swung around the corner and slid on the ice again but caught himself and kept running. The street lights that lined the embankment wall lit up the devoid area, and John knew Oliver should be
If this is how Oliver acted after doing something he loved, John figured next time he wouldn’t be as anxious about him being out on his own, as long as the boy stayed happy.
Mrs Hudson invited them down for dinner, and they sat and talked with her for almost two hours. She asked how Oliver’s guitar lessons were going, and Oliver said well. John said he learned fast - he could hear Oliver trying to play quietly in his room, and John knew he already made amazing progress.
John looked to Oliver, brow furrowed. Oliver only spoke in French when he didn’t realize he was doing it or if he didn’t want someone to hear what he was saying. John positively heard his name too.
“No…” Oliver mumbled.
“Finally!” Caden grinned, grabbing Oliver’s wrist and pulling him so he fell back onto his bed with an
“Tea?” asked John.
It read ‘
“Hello, John!” Violet Holmes greeted warmly.
“Hey, hey, hey, it’s all right,” John rushed toward him, then put his hands on either side of Oliver’s face. “Just breathe, okay?”
“This is Mrs Hudson, our landlady,” introduced John. “She’s a very good friend of mine.”
“What?” Oliver shook his head, looking upset, “Why didn’t you ask me first?”
Oliver shrugged. “Hmm, there’s… four bedrooms, the master, two guest rooms and one the used to be used as like a servant’s quarters? But that was never used and there’s just storage in there. There’s two libraries, the kitchen, dining hall, drawing room, three sitting rooms, and two studies. A lot of bathrooms. I’m probably forgetting something too.”
“He hasn’t gotten back to me yet, but I assume he will be,” John said. “At least for a little while.”
Oliver’s brow drew forward and he didn’t looked too chuffed. “Do I have to?”
“No, no, of course not,” he said. “Oliver, you and I came to an agreement before the holidays that if he raised his marks by the new year, I would help change his curriculum around to better suit his academic needs.”
The second day Oliver was in the hospital, he decided he hated hospitals. He'd mostly slept through the first day, but was in too much pain to do so today. He'd never really been to a hospital before - that he can remember anyways. When he was younger, all of his doctors had been personally hired to come right to the estate. He'd never really gotten sick and anytime he was hurt it could be taken care of at home or at a private clinic. The smell of bleach, and sickness and the sounds of crying families, babies, and beeping drove him nuts. He hated hospitals.
Oliver was definitely half-asleep and heavily medicated.
also the "i love you" scene with john and sherlock was literally the first thing i wrote for this WHOLE SERIES, thank god you guys can finally read it.
Oliver’s face lit up and he ran into his room. John put on his own coat, and they left the flat a few minutes later. Oliver kept running ahead and then back, eager to get to the park and John watched his childish excitement fondly. They found a place under a large pine tree in the park, shielded from the dusting of snow falling from the sky and watched the moon turn a glowing orange.
How the hell?
John paid for those guitar lessons and the next day, Oliver’s birthday, gave him the rental guitar he purchased. His grandparents had a few gifts for him, as did Mycroft. Before they left for home, though, John put a folder on the table in front of everyone. Of course Mycroft already knew of it’s contents, as he gave it to John a few days prior. Sigar must have figured it out, and Violet looked from the folder of papers to John, her face lighting up.
“I’m glad you ate,” Mrs Hudson said, standing and picking up their plates. John took them from her and put them in the sink. “Getting Sherlock to eat felt like feeding a baby. He always forgot to and complained when we made him.”
John listened intently, fidgeting with his hands.
Oliver felt Emily's hand on his, but he didn't turn to look. He opened his palm, letting their fingers fit together, and squeezed. He wanted to cry. Oliver wanted to cry so bad, because everything hurt but the stab wound was the least of it.
for Oliver.
“Again, I apologize, John,” Mycroft said, giving Oliver a stern look.
John shook his head and took a deep breath, wiping a hand across his eyes. He didn’t know if they were tears of mirth or hurt, but at this point it was all the same. He didn’t know what to do. Sherlock was here, and that changed
John sighed and moved towards the desk in the sitting room, but saw Oliver pause in the kitchen. Oliver turned to look at John, his eyes wide and his knuckles shaking where he gripped the back of the dining chair.
“Where are you now?” Mycroft asked. John could hear him shuffling around papers and moving.
“Okay,” John stood and took Oliver’s hand to help him up. “Shout if you need anything.”
Sherlock stepped forward and kissed him. John reached up to hold Sherlock’s face in his hands, kissing him back. He could feel Sherlock’s long fingers curl against his jumper, pulling him impossibly closer.
Olive spoke again, “I don’t hate you because you were absent my whole childhood, I hate you
So, warning, the next chapter I've literally been planning from the beginning of this ENTIRE series. It's intense.
The women on the end of the line made a noise of understanding - John couldn’t be quite sure what that suggested. Then she said, “I assume you know why I’m calling - about Oliver’s marks.”
and John
Oliver gagged when Caden’s knee met his stomach, he doubled over and coughed, then Caden swung him to the floor. Oliver tried to catch himself but his right wrist landed under his weight and a sharp pain shot up the inside of his arm, making it feel numb and cold. He pushed the pain away and pulled his body up, spinning around in time to see a flash of something metal and Caden’s hand rushing at him.
“A focus is good, but don’t forget to take care of yourself,” Ella said. “Don’t make Oliver feel like a replacement. He’s his own person.”
“I love you,” John blurted as a whisper, like the last words on someone’s dying breath. It blew through the room like wind from nowhere, carrying words not dared be spoken by either of them in all their time together. It was fleeting, said by millions of people everyday, but to them it was so taboo that the silence that filled the air around those words was so thick they could carve it out with nothing but the sharp edges of their fractured hearts.
“They - they let me up here,” she said. “Even though I’m not - I’m not family. Is he okay?”
Lestrade brought his mug to his lips, “It’s a slow going thing.”
Oliver shrugged.
didn’t want to punch him. I hope you punched him. And I don’t know, it’s probably been four years maybe? I don’t keep track or care. I just care that he’s a bastard.”
“How do you feel about it?” Caden asked. Oliver looked at him, sitting on the bed with his lip caught between his teeth and a weird jolt of electricity shot through Oliver’s stomach. He looked away.
Something brushed his fingertips, he jerked his arm and grabbed onto it - cloth, Oliver’s school shirt. John hauled him up, his grip knuckle-whitening on the clothing until he broke surface, gasping for air and pulling Oliver’s limp body above the surface. Adrenaline was keeping his tired body going while he held Oliver across the chest and dragged him to the small shore, then pushed him up onto it.
The park looked empty when he arrived, and he double checked his phone to make sure he was in the right area. Oliver should be right there somewhere. John began walking closer to where it showed Oliver should be, while looking around. He stopped in front of a bench and his heart dropped into his stomach. Oliver phone sat abandoned on the bench. He picked it up with shaking fingers and tapped the screen. It lit up with an unsent message typed into the box.
Oliver stood up, his chair scraping the floor. “
weekly updates?
; again with the silence.
while John tried not to have an absolute breakdown. John wished he knew what Sherlock was thinking.
She shook her head and looked between the two of them. “There’s going to be shouting when that boy comes back, I just know it. It’d do you three well to sort things out quickly. I don’t want to be kept up into the depths of the night, and the neighbors will start to complain. Sit and talk to each other like adults.”
A few moments later the nurse left Oliver’s room and gestured that they could go back in. Emily looked up, biting her lip and John nodded that she could go ahead. She slipped through the doorway and shut it behind her. John remembered Oliver telling him they had a fight a while ago and wondered if they had ever resolved it. Maybe Emily would be able to get through to Oliver better than John or Sherlock could right now. If Oliver talked to
When she finished cooking, she put together plates for everyone, even Sherlock who said he wasn’t hungry, and John sat at the table with Mrs Hudson and Oliver. Oliver mostly pushed his food around with the fork, taking an occasional bite while listening to John and Mrs Hudson’s small talk.
I need your guys help real quick, so please read this!!
“I love you too,” Sherlock whispered.
John sighed, washed his hands, then sat at the desk in the sitting room and tried to read.
Mycroft stayed, “As I said, a bit of a phase.”
John curled his hands on the wooden table and closed his eyes. “Sherlock had more friends than he thought.”
“Emily caught on, but you’re so desperate for physical attention you ignored the fact that I’ve been brainwashing you, and using our
John pushed the door open. Oliver sat at his desk, his headphones around his neck and a pencil in his hand. A work in progress drawing laid across his desk, on a large sheet of paper he had brought home in a roll the day before. John couldn’t tell what Oliver planned out yet, most of it looked sketchy and rough, but he had no doubt it’d be a masterpiece.
… I can’t…” means "I'm so tired"
John sighed and leaned back in his chair. “You know most of that is him putting up a front, right?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m fourteen,” he said. He heard the snap of gum come from her mouth, and almost smirked.
He found John’s hand, and dug his nails into John’s palm while he choked out a sob and hid his face in his knees. John didn’t wince at the pain while he kneeled on the floor next to the boy and squeezed his shoulder.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, I’m leaving in a few days to visit my sister for a bit, he’s welcome to use my room while I’m gone,” She said, handing him a pot to dry. “Least until you three sort yourselves out.”
Oliver shifted, sitting up straight in his chair. “For how long? Who? Were there anymore? Wait - was it one of Uncle Mycroft's?”
A fond smile crossed Lestrade’s face. “Good, that’s good. I got my job back too. It’s a little weird, but it works for me.”
In Oliver’s hospital room, as the doctor went over the at-home care John already knew, he took a moment to watch Oliver out of the corner of his eye. He had no idea what the boy had been thinking about the past five days, he’d barely spoken more than a few words to John. Oliver looked nervous behind his tired eyes, fidgeting with his cast and the corner of his blanket. It broke John’s heart.
,” Oliver said sarcastically and John had to fight a smirk.
“Give him a chance,” Mycroft said. “If this really doesn’t work out, I can figure out a different situation for him. If you need anything I’ll be in touch.”
“We’ll have to figure out where you’re going to sleep.”
He looked down to his lap so John wouldn’t see his face pale, and pretended to check a message on his phone.
John nodded, letting him talk.
John didn’t know what to expect in the morning, but wasn’t very surprised to find Oliver already awake and making tea when he stumbled down the stairs into the sitting room. He gratefully accepted the mug Oliver offered him and sunk into his armchair. The winds whipping around outside had kept him up for the better part of the night, but looking outside now the world seemed still - frozen with the ice that hung from the window.
“Tomorrow? I can bring him and his things by in the afternoon.”
Brushing out his uniform with one hand, Oliver lifted his other to show John he had the route pulled up on his phone. “I’m fine.”
They walked around the park, laughing and talking. Caden either held his hand or put his arm over Oliver’s shoulders, and it was nice. He felt like Caden really cared about him, which was a wonderful feeling. He knew John and his grandparents cared about him, obviously, but with Caden it was different.
"Dieu, ça fait mal!" - God, that hurts!
“Oliver I need to talk to you about something,” John said, and Oliver’s stomach
!!! IMPORTANT STUFF !!! PLEASE TAKE A MINUTE TO READ THIS !!!
Oliver walked from the room and led John down the hall to a door that had shapes crudely carved into the bottom of it, like from a child with a dull knife. Oliver pushed the door open and John saw the room was just as large at the guest room, but this one had light blue walls and dark paneling. Many of Oliver’s things were still in the room, and John smiled a bit at what felt like the leftovers of a bright childhood. Oliver walked into the room and started shuffling around, looking for something, and John followed him in.
I came back then!”
Sighing, John went into the kitchen and made tea, leaving the kettle on the stove in case Oliver wanted any and sat back in his chair.
Oliver nodded, looking thoughtful. Their comfortable silence continued, only the low crackle of the fire and soft winds outside speaking to them until they headed off to bed.
“I know. I just… want you to try.”
“Well - no. I’m his guardian, since no one else can take care of him,” John realized how strange his situation sounded and didn’t really want to explain it.
“I don’t care about Sherlock!” Oliver snapped. “All I
Their lives seem to move in fragments of moments and milestones. Some days passed in a blur, and John wondered if they even ever happened, while others dragged out with stretches of boring or mundane. But John loved every moment he lived, and he can’t remember feeling like that ever before.
Sherlock shook his head, looking down at the floor. “I was counting on Moriarty missing her. He hadn’t considered her… important enough.”
The driver huffed and drove anyways, John could hear Oliver’s teeth chattering. He couldn’t imagine how cold Oliver felt, John himself was shivering and he had more layers on. John looked out the window to see a dusting of snow start falling from the sky.
“Truly, John,” Violet said. “I’m grateful to you. I think he really trusts you, and that’s a big deal for Oliver.”
Anna talked about her last job as a barista and a bit about her hobbies and John politely nodded along, but found her to be… boring. He knows she’s a nice girl, pretty enough, but she just seemed so… average. John couldn’t figure out why something like that stood out to him suddenly. Average was good, right? John knows he’s average, so why did it bother him if Anna was?
see him. Which pissed Oliver off.
Thank you all for sticking with me!!
“It’s all right, shhh,” John said. He led Oliver towards the window and yanked it open. A gust of cool air blew in, making him shiver, but Oliver’s face relaxed a bit, his hair blowing off his forehead. John put his hand on Oliver’s back and pulled him towards the window.
“I figured as much.” Sherlock didn’t seemed too bothered by this information. He shifted a bit in his chair. “Mycroft must have told you, then. About how Oliver came to be, and - and why I never mentioned him.”
And she didn't talk to him.
Visions of semi-smirks, blue eyes behind a magnifying glass, swishing of a coat and wind through curly hair danced behind his eyes. A baritone laugh ran through his ears, fading into a familiar song on a violin. Too much.
John looked up to him, confused.
“Oh! Oliver asked you to adopt him didn’t he?” Violet interrupted, excitement bleeding into her voice. “I knew it would only be a matter of time, I’m so glad. We didn’t want to ask you right out, because it’s always been up to Oliver first, and of course we hoped you would agree - oh, Sigar come here, listen.”
“Finally.” Oliver sighed. He curled his fingers in the sheets of his bed, looking down at his dry hands. With the relief of going home came anxiety - the dread at going back to the flat, where he could no longer avoid talking, no longer have his own space.
“We’ll gladly sign the papers,” Sigar told him. “It will mostly be a private affair, and done quicker than a normal adoption would happen.”
Once he’d wheeled Oliver out of the hospital, he caught a cab, helped Oliver into it, and took it back towards Baker Street. The whole ride Oliver leaned his head against the window and seemed to be fighting sleep. The grey sky out the window reflected both of their moods and the dark smudges under Oliver’s eyes made him look skeletal.
Mrs Hudson burst out laughing, and John joined in - the irony was almost painful.
PLEASE leave a review and tell me what you thought about everything that happened in this chapter. There's quiet a bit of development for John and Oliver here.
Oliver shook his head, then stepped out of the doorway to let them in. Emily, who had been to the flat almost every week for a year straight, brushed past Caden and started up the stairs. Caden shrugged to Oliver, then they followed her up. She waited for them outside the door to the flat, and Oliver pushed it open, walking into the living room.
“A rubik’s cube?” Oliver asked, turning it over in his hands.
After that, January passed in a blur. Oliver finished rest of his prescription by taking a pill every other day for a week, then every two days until they were gone to lessen the withdrawal effects. He became a bit more irritable, but kept busy with school and his club. John focused on work and writing when he needed it.
John unabashedly gave Oliver a look that said
Long chapter, mostly a lighter break from the angst, I hope you guys liked it!
Then, rather suddenly, it was Christmas Eve.
This was new. How many more things would Sherlock neglect to tell him before the night ended? “A target? You didn’t say anything about that.”
Oliver sat up. “What? No! He doesn’t deserve anything from us!”
“I found an alternative school for Oliver,” Mycroft said. “It’s a little farther away, but the teachers are top of the line professionals, and the students come from respectable families. I can guarantee he won’t have problems with the students there.”
“Nothing explicitly,” Mycroft leaned on his ever present umbrella. “He starts school next Monday, it’s a new school but I stopped there on the way over so he knows where it is.”
Oliver glanced away and lifted a hand to twist a finger into his curls. “I want to stop taking them. Even if it makes the anxiety bad for a while.”
Eventually, he rolled over and checked his phone, relieved and almost… disappointed… to see a message saying John and Sherlock had left the flat. At least he didn’t have to face them yet. There was a message from Emily too, but he deleted it and dropped his phone on the mattress next to him.
Today is chapter 9, and in two days (on Thursday) I will post chapter 10, so make sure you don't miss it!
John didn’t really know what to say to that.
“At times,” John admit. “But he’s rather reserved.”
In full color, it depicted the beach they went to that summer, the night sky glowing off the dark blue water and the stars lighting up the surface. The painting looked like it came from the perspective of the cliffs above the beach. Two tiny shadows sat on the beach by water, who John could only assume to be Oliver and himself.
This chapter is a little dull, sorry. This chapter sets up a couple plot points for the next fics in this series.
“Hm? What?” Oliver’s head jerked up and he looked around, then turned to see John. John turned away quickly while Oliver stood up, put his notebook down and began fidgeting with his sleeves.
“Can he do the deductive thing Sherlock could do?” Harry asked. She’d never met Sherlock face to face, and it made John sad to think about. That his sister would never know the man that had such an impact on his life. She knew enough about him from the blogs, newspapers, and reports, though.
Sherlock obviously didn’t know what to do with himself and John didn’t know what to say. It was just… awkward. And
Out of the corner of his eye he saw Oliver slide his headphones off so they hung around his neck, then look up at John. He didn’t speak so John pretended not to notice, investing himself instead in the black search screen. Hm, what a nice shade of white.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock head into the shower a minute later, and John worked on repressing thinking about last night. Ten minutes later Sherlock is out and dressed, his black hair still wet and a little frizzy.
face on this boy. He felt his stomach drop and he chest filled with cotton. What if he couldn’t do this?
“How many rooms are in this house?” asked John as they scaled the stairs.
“Mycroft,” John stepped aside and motioned for them to come in. “Hello, Oliver.”
Oliver sighed. “Can I go up there now and get this over with or are we gonna keep looking disappointedly at each other?”
Yet as soon as he said it, he wished he could take it back. Keep it hidden in the dark recesses of his mind, pretend it never happened and go on still, both pretending to be oblivious to the unnamed tension constantly between them that they tried to ignore day after day.
Oliver jerked his head up, and his face was just as read as his ears had turned. “No!”
“Oliver, your room is just through there if you want to unpack,” John said, looking past Oliver and towards the hall. “The door at the end of the hall.”
“Do you want to read it?” John offered.
“Oh, I’m well. Sigar and I just spent a week in Venice, such a quaint little place,” she said. “You and Oliver are still coming up for his birthday, right?”
’ and Oliver felt his gut twist. A third message, ‘
John shrugged and shifted so he was cross legged. “I don’t know. It’s not always inherited. Something else could have caused it when you were young, or it could just be a part of your genetics.”
John left out a huff of breath and nodded, his lips in a thin line. He started clearing up their half finished dinner. “We’re okay Mrs H, just had a bit of a row.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ah…” John leaned back. “My sister lives over in Luton, but that’s about it. Though I live with my… I take care of a kid; Oliver.”
“All right!” He shouted over them, and both heads of black curls whipped to look at him. In literally any other situation John would have laughed. “Stop. Both of you are too worked up. Sherlock, take a walk - just give us five minutes. Oliver, sit down.”
John’s phone beeped, on the table next to him. His eyes flicked to it and he saw a message from Oliver light up the screen. Sherlock looked at it too, and John flipped the phone face down. Then, with a sinking feeling, he realized Oliver coming to face Sherlock would have a drastic and loud outcome. He sighed. Sherlock’s without a doubt realized that Oliver lived here - there’s evidence everywhere. He supposed it was just another awkward topic they had to talk about as well. Before, Sherlock hadn’t even told John he had a son. Now, Sherlock’s come home to find his son living with his best friend. It must be odd, but they had to talk about it. He didn’t know “the right time” to do it, and frankly he didn’t want to be the mediator.
“Really?” Emily’s eyebrows lifted. “You look like you’re twelve. At least I
I don't know if anyone noticed yet, but the chapter titles are the names of constellations. Each one relates to the chapter on a very low scale. In this one, John had Oliver get his telescope and they went to the park (even though that isn't a scene), hence the name Telescopium “The Telescope” constellation. The last one had the clock (timer) on the bomb and it was the constellation Horologium “The Clock”.
Sorry about this being short, I'm going through some stuff in my real life and it's affecting my motivation with this story. Don't worry though, I refuse to give up on this one, and for sure will finish.
“Do you know what triggered it?” John asked, waiting patiently for him to compose himself.
He told her about Oliver, because he saw no reason not to. She asked some questions, but listened and wrote while he talked. John asked why he felt so worried for the boy already and Ella smiled and said it’s instinct.
Caden was waiting, sitting on a crate. He looked relieved when Oliver walked in, standing up and smiling the smile that made Oliver’s heart pound.
Oliver’s face turned beat red, and he took her hand, nodding. “Y-you too- er, nice to meet you. Too.”
Well, that didn’t mean John couldn’t write. In the end, writing really helped him sort through his thoughts and extraordinary life. And writing took up just enough time that he could do it when he had nothing else to do. John picked up his laptop and sat down in the armchair, propping his cane against the side table. He wouldn’t post his writing anywhere, but he would start writing about his life again to sort through all his emotions.
Two in the afternoon the next day, John opened the front door to see Mycroft, Oliver - headphones on and a bag over his shoulder (John immediately looked away) - and some faceless man that worked for Mycroft holding two cardboard boxes.
A loud knock on the door sounded and John hustled down the stairs, then pulled the door open. Mycroft stood with a rather neutral face, his hand on Oliver’s shoulder - John had a flashing memory of the first time they met. Oliver’s hair was frizzy and sticking up and he had his head tilted down in embarrassment, his hands in his hoodie pockets.
Oliver shrugged. Maybe. Probably. He had been easily hiding it from Sherlock, and the man had suspected but yesterday all that had been ruined. Ugh, he didn’t want to think about it. He didn’t want to think about going home and sitting down to talk to them, he didn’t want to go through any of that. Oliver wished he could pretend none of that happened. He wished yesterday didn’t happen. Caden was right, they should run away together, no more problems.
John folded his arms and leaned on the windowsill, and listened to Oliver name as many stars as he could.
that kind of thing doesn’t bother-”
. He didn’t want to talk about it. He wanted them to forget about it and everything to go back to normal. Before he met Caden, before Sherlock came back. When it was just him and John.
. At least at work he could stay busy and forget about everything that was changing in his life.
So Sherlock nodded and sat down at the kitchen table, pretending to do something on his phone. John thought it funny that Oliver did that sometimes too, when he felt awkward. Pretending to be busy.
John spent the rest of the day talking with Violet and Sigar, or listening to Oliver.
he is.”
“Why?” Oliver’s voice rose louder than John had heard it yet, almost a shout. “Why wouldn’t he tell anyone? You’re supposed to be his best friend, right? Not a word about him having a son?”
Sherlock sighed and responded, “
“I’ve been wanting to check on you,” Mrs Hudson says, “But I know you must be tired and I didn’t want to bother you three too much. I’m glad you’re okay, Ollie.”
Oliver put his hand back in his pocket and stepped into the living room, facing Sherlock’s armchair. He moved past it and sat down in one of the chairs at the desk, and kept looking around the flat. John wondered if he could deduce things like Sherlock and Mycroft could. The same people raised them, they grew up in the same home. But - times also change. No doubt he was smart though - that, at least, seemed to be a Holmes trait.
(Oliver speaks French once in this chapter, to Emily, saying "stupid girls")
Oliver nodded, his watery eyes flicking back and forth between John’s. Oliver inhaled sharply, then let it out. John breathed too, feeling his shoulders untense with each breath, until Oliver looked calmer.
. Gone went the shy, angry boy that was dumped into John’s life, and a whole new person emerged that John watched grow with captivation. Oliver kept his grades up, told John about his club, went to his guitar lessons on Wednesdays after astronomy and tutored Emily on Fridays.
Anyways, an
Sherlock threw his hands up. “Oh,
“You should finish it,” Emily encouraged. “The colors are incredible!”
He woke up late because it took him ages to fall asleep. He stretched his arms out then hauled himself out of bed and checked his phone. Oliver left him a message about twenty minutes ago saying he was leaving to go meet Emily and Caden, and Sherlock was downstairs. John didn’t mind that Oliver went with his friends, but it left John feeling a little lonely knowing the shy thirteen year old he once knew was growing up.
If you guys haven't noticed, this is marked as the first fic in a series. I know people who write fan fictions into series run the risk of losing readers, but I really hope you guys stay with me.
A grin crept along Oliver’s face while his eyes skimmed the paper. “You - you’re actually are doing it?”
“Shh, don’t talk,” John put his hand on Oliver’s back. The position was awkward, with Oliver crouched on the floor and John knelt next to him, one hand on Oliver’s back and the other letting Oliver dig his nails into.
“These are his things,” Mycroft said, gesturing towards the boxes.
Sherlock nodded. “I gather,” his head turned, looking into the sitting room. “Just over a year?”
Then Oliver turned and sat down at the desk to eat.
The advisor made a noise of affirmation. “He said it will be easy to keep his marks up now. He looked rather excited, and I’m glad to see him with an expression other than bored,” he chuckled.
“I… apologize - if it seems like I’m not worried for Oliver,” Sherlock said. “I just - don’t know how to deal with everything I’m feeling. I’m just trying to do what I know best for him. Solve the case.”
Oliver half-shrugged again. “It’s boring. I don’t like doing it, I’d rather read on my own. The work is tedious, I already know the content.”
“I was at my mom’s that night,” Emily frowned. “It’s still weird to see someone
A week later, John still hadn’t the chance to talk to Oliver about changing schools. Oliver had been busy with schoolwork and his club, and John had to take extra shifts at the surgery after one of the other doctors fell ill. He was always exhausted when he got home late at night, and Oliver usually fled the house too quick to a get a conversation in in the mornings.
“I’m making the process faster, yes,” Mycroft nodded.
The door creaked and a nurse popped her head in.
Sherlock waved his hand between them. “This… awkwardness - between us. I want everything to go back to the way it was. Two years ago.”
“Better. I returned to work a bit ago.”
“I just… don’t know if - if you’ll be okay with it.”
Where were you?”
“No no no,” John took a breath - he couldn’t panic. CPR - he’s done it plenty before, he could save Oliver, he could do it if he didn’t panic. John laced his fingers and pressed the heel of his palm against Oliver’s sternum. He forced his racing thoughts to the back of his mind and went through the motions. One, two, three four… to thirty. Check for a pulse. Nothing.
Not much later, when it was nearing noon, Emily walked through the sitting room towards the door. John thought it odd that Oliver wasn’t with her.
Oliver nodded, that wonderful smile stretching across his face again.
John was around the table before Oliver hit the floor, his eyes rolling up and head lolling onto John’s shoulder. Sherlock hovered close by, but all of John’s attention stayed on the limp boy in his arms. Oliver’s socked feet slid backwards, and John sunk to the floor with him. He held Oliver up and shifted him so he could see the boy’s face, fighting unconsciousness, expression pained and eyes barely cracked.
“Maybe once or twice… I don’t know,” he said. He was fiddling with his hair, then his sleeves, and his hands were still shaking a little.
“It wasn’t your decision to make!” Oliver shouted, his face twisted with anger.
Later in the night, after dinner, Sherock hadn’t texted or given any indication that he’d be back anytime that night. John tried not to care. Oliver had stretched out on the couch, his notebook on his stomach and a pencil tapping on it while he stared at nothing. John sat in his armchair, reading. He liked the peacefulness, and for just a moment allowed himself to forget their life is changing almost completely now.
“Don’t worry about price, if it’s something expensive,” John assured. For Oliver, if something fell out of his price range, he knew Mycroft would help out. Sometimes John felt guilty about it, but after a year of Mycroft covering anything John couldn’t for the boy, he didn’t anymore.
, I know it’s important, but he’s safe here,” Sherlock said. “Don’t you want to find out who did this?”
The genres of music I imagine Oliver listening to can be found
“Because of everything that’s been going on at your school, we think it’d be safer if you moved to a different one,” explained John.
It was almost twenty minutes later, when Oliver had dressed in warmer clothing and John had started the fire that they sat on the floor with big mugs of tea. Oliver had his cup on the floor in front of him, his knees drawn up to his chest and chin on top of them. The boy stared intensely into the fire, his face blank, the flames flickering off his eyes and making them look brown.
He wasn’t going to get there fast enough and John’s head spun with half-formed thoughts as he ran. He got to the rail and looked over, his blood rushing in his ears. “Oliver!”
“Thank you, John,” Molly sighed. “She needs to raise her marks, else she’ll have to stay back a year. Her parents haven’t found anyone else to tutor her, since she’s always jumping between my house and theirs. Oliver’s her age, right? Maybe it will be different.”
Sherlock pushed a folder across the table toward John and flipped it open. “This group might be related to the alleged terrorist attack we shut down weeks ago; the bomb on the train.”
A knock on the doorframe, “Good morning dear, I brought bacon!”
“You all right?” John asked, pulling his shoes off.
“Have you made any friends?” Violet eventually asked, a bit gently.
John looked out the window and tapped his lower lip with a finger. He didn’t even know if he’d be allowed back there, after leaving the way he left. “I could… I’ll call and see if they are hiring again.”
“He has an anxiety disorder, and a monthly prescription for it,” Mycroft said. John’s mind went to what he knew about anxiety. It could be genetic sometimes, but he doubted Oliver got it from Sherlock. It also had to be relatively inhibiting if he needed medication for it.
please review it's the lifeblood that keeps this story going
“Remember how I said sometimes my astronomy club would meet on Saturdays after sunset?” asked Oliver. “I sort of forgot to tell you that today is one of those days, but can I please go anyways?”
“He’s quiet, actually,” John said. “Maybe you can meet him over the holidays. I’ve been thinking about having some people over for New Years. It’s been very quiet and I think he and I need some company for a bit.”
… I can’t…”
She popped her hip out to the side and put her hand on it.
They arrived at the Holmes estate later on, and had dinner with Violet and Sigar, who told them Mycroft would be visiting a few hours the next day.
(See the end of the chapter for
John glared at Sherlock, how could he even
“Both of you! Stop!” John shouted again, then stepped forward and grabbed Oliver’s shoulder, pushing him back until he sat on the couch. “Sherlock, just - walk, okay? Go for a few minutes.”
“Really, I don’t mind paying.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“S-something’s wrong -
John nodded. “If you promise to tell me if you have another panic attack.”
John shrugged. “I really don’t mind. It’s nice having the company.”
Oliver’s eyes shot down to the duvet he sat on, and flicked across it while he thought. “Um, if- if it’s all right I could stay here,” he looked back up. “I’m pretty sure Uncle is busy during Christmas.”
A sheepish nod.
Emily nodded then left, and John went back to cleaning up their messy bookshelves.
“Start by finishing that, and I’ll give your school a call in the morning,” John said. Oliver’s lips quirked up and he spun around, going to his room.
“I will.”
“You… want that?” John asked, and it felt like someone else controlled his mouth.
Turning his head, he watched Emily walk in and shut his eyes, willing himself not to cry. She was one of the last people he wanted to see. He didn't want her, or her anger, or her pity. He could remember calling her in the middle of all that pain, but not much else. Just sounds, a heavy pressure on his numbing stomach, flashing lights and someone sobbing. A brief moment of wavering consciousness where he could see Emily leaning over him, yelling something while tears dripped off her face.
“Well,” started Ella, “Maybe instead of looking for the similarities between them, look for the differences.”
Oliver stayed in his room most of the day, which was fine. John checked on him a few times and each time he was sat in front of his closed window where snow lightly fell outside, headphones on and drawing book balanced on his legs. It was serene and John, not being able to help himself, lifted his phone and snapped a picture of him, intending on showing his grandparents to embarrass him.
John panted as he crawled onto his hands and knees and rolled the boy onto his back. Oliver was completely limp and pale, his arms flopping to the ground and his head bobbing to the side. His dark curls were flat against his forehead and stuck to his cheeks, instead of wild and full. John held his hand over Oliver’s mouth - not breathing. He put his finger under Oliver’s chin to check his pulse. Nothing.
John sighed with relief, then went back up to his room, prepared for another sleepless night.
“Oliver?” John asked through the doorway to the boy’s room. With only a few days left to Christmas, he wouldn’t be surprised if Oliver felt homesick.
Molly answered sounding dead tired, but delighted to hear from him. She had been working extra hours at Bart’s and John realized with a sinking feeling that she probably took Sherlock’s death just as bad as John had. He felt terrible now, for never calling her or checking in, and told her so.
Oliver perked up.
“No, but Oliver, you must understand, Sherlock  -”
Sherlock’s room was the opposite of Mycroft’s. Some of the walls had random paint splatters on it near the floor, probably done when he was a child. The floorboards were scratched up, like the furniture had been regularly moved. There was a huge scorch mark that hit the ceiling on the wall above the desk, heavily cluttered in beakers and chemistry equipment. Papers were
“You’re a saint, Mrs H,” John said, giving her a one armed hug.
wow the weeks are FLYING by like where is February going??? January lasted like a decade but it's been two days and February is almost over?
when Sherlock was gone, and now he sat there in front of him but it still -
Sherlock put his hand on John's arm “John. I - I have a feeling this… whole thing is related to whoever is spying on us and that organization. They’ve been targeting Oliver from the start, remember?” He paused, looking at the floor. “This is my fault.”
And he looked just like Sherlock.
Ella nodded, “And you’ve been writing?”
“I’d prefer if you did,” John said, giving a somewhat ‘you’ll do it anyways’ smile. “I think it’d be good for you. Could help your own work as well. And you’ll make some money you can spend on art supplies.”
Do you think I handled John's grief well? Did you like the scene with Harry? Let me know in the comments!
-------
John chuckled, “I can help set it up. Come on.”
Oliver pursed his lips and nodded. “Okay. Thank you.”
okay but seriously I'm going to make an effort to get back into weekly updates, because this story is almost over and it's the longest thing i've ever written. i just have had writer's block with the last couple of chapters (i write ahead by two or three chapters)
“I’m very proud of you, Oliver,” John said. Oliver looked up with his mouth dropped open. “You pushed yourself to do what you needed to better your education. For that, I’m proud of you and I’m sure your grandparents will be too.”
They head back inside, passing Mycroft who was talking quite aggressively into his phone. Oliver found his grandmother in the pantry, digging around for something and John stepped into the kitchen where Sigar leaned over something cooking in a pot.
Oliver walked out of the kitchen then, calling for Mycroft to help Violet in the kitchen.
It took close to ten minutes for Oliver’s breathing to even out and the fingers still digging into his skull loosened, then dropped to his side. He heaved a sigh and lifted his head, dragging a hand down his face.
Something flashed across Oliver’s face, but he looked neutral before John could figure out what. “Do you not want me here?”
Violet sobbed and Sigar wouldn’t meet Sherlock’s eye while he swallowed his pride and sat across from them at a table, apologizing and explaining everything, and answering their questions. When his mother eventually did stop crying, she held him for a very long time. His father did the same.
*swaggers in on rollerblades, holding a cat and tea*
It was Oliver and John now, and Sherlock was the space between them.
to update this week. Can you believe that? Whoops. Wow finals are taking a lot out of me... I didn't have time to edit this thoroughly, so if there are any blatant errors PLEASE point them out, and I will fix them.
John put his hands on the counter, leaning on them. It wasn’t fair that everything was fucked up now. It wasn’t fair that someone got in and destroyed everything right under their noses. Now
John accepted it, and after a moment’s hesitation, flipped it over.
John had moved into the kitchen to talk with Mycroft after Molly assured him she was doing fine (just a few rough days here and there). He glanced through the doorway to check on Oliver and Emily, and saw Oliver had moved to sit in John’s chair and Emily now sat on the couch, typing on her phone.
“Because, it made sense that something like this would happen. I knew he wanted me to kill myself, that why he was destroying my image, and I was going to make it look like just that,” Sherlock explained. “I couldn’t tell you beforehand, because the sniper watching you had to believe your reaction. It had to be entirely authentic.”
“You look better,” he commented instead.
“Uh, everything’s well, other than the few problems with Oliver at school,” John said.
John doesn’t blame him. “Did you take your anxiety medication?”
(See the end of the chapter for
he was having issues, then we caught him and,” John’s voice cracked and he looked at the floor. “And we just left him here,
“Well, take your time,” John said. “Call me when you decide.”
“I’ll get some from the café downstairs,” Oliver said, zipping up his bag. He picked up the mug and took a big gulp, apparently not minding that it had just boiled.
After a nudge from Mrs Hudson and that mention from Lestrade, John finally got around to calling his sister. Harry had tried calling him over and over right after Sherlock’s death, but after the millionth time of him ignoring her calls and she gave up. She sounded a lot more awake and sober in the call than he had ever heard before, which made him happy. They both seemed to be dealing with their demons.
Oh boy, so who hates me?
Oliver showed him some of the other rooms, then the downstairs library - which indeed was massive, there wasn’t a bit of wall in sight with the floor to ceiling shelves. Then they put on their coats and took a walk around the grounds. On one of the back porches had an old fashioned telescope set up, bronze in color and probably not very accurate. The mostly dead grass was covered in a layer of snow and frost, and the wind blew around them, but the estate was truly beautiful. A massive garden would grow out behind the house in the spring, and John found himself wishing he could see it in full bloom.
… Sherlock is on.”
PLEASE REVIEW, IT MEANS SO MUCH!!!
(Also, I know a lot of people worry about cliches that happen with OCs, but don't worry, I hate that stuff too. So you don't have to worry about any cringe-y MarySue stuff with Emily. Honestly I just want a rival.)
After a moment, John said, “Green.”
Oliver’s been with John for over a year, and his fifteenth birthday approached faster than John had time to prepare for. He had an idea a while back, to maybe get Oliver guitar lessons. He listened to music so often, he definitely pretended to play an imaginary guitar before and John didn’t think he knew how to play anything. It might be another way for him to make friends, too.
John looked down, only now realizing he hadn’t grabbed it on his rush out of the flat. He sighed, not surprised that another Holmes cured his psychosomatic limp with a wild endeavour. He just shook his head and Oliver went back to staring at the ground.
Sherlock nodded and took a sip of his tea. “It’s okay, I deserve it from him.”
John groaned in the back of his throat and looked at the closed door to Oliver’s room. He still didn’t know why Oliver left the house yesterday, or why he was at that warehouse. He felt like he
John nodded. “Yeah. Yes, that’s perfect.”
Sherlock sat down at the desk across from John, then cleared his throat. “When we left Oliver here and that lead was a dud… The man that had tipped Mycroft off double crossed him. Mycroft thinks it was part of their plan to get us out of the flat, and lure Oliver to that warehouse. We can also confirm that boy - Caden - is part of the organization. He had been the whole time.”
“Sorry to interrupt,” she said, “Do you two mind stepping into the hall for a moment while I change Oliver’s bandages?”
Sherlock wasn’t back home until late in the evening. John heard his feet heavy on the stairs and when the door opened he looked worn out. He lifted his head to meet John’s eyes and John felt an odd sensation jolt through his heart, so he looked away.
He ran towards the body on the pavement, but everything jolted and he was too far away and his feet wouldn’t move. The pavement turned to tar and he desperately dragged forward as it slowly crept up to his thighs, then waist. John called to the limp body on the pavement, but the tar still crept up his body. Then the form on the pavement moved, and John was there, leaning over the black coat and dark curly hair. His tears fell onto the sidewalk, but they were red and he flipped to body over to look at his face, but it was Oliver’s face that stared lifelessly back at him.
(Shameless use of google translate for Oliver's French)
“Certainly.”
Sherlock looked at him. “Does John know? What you do when when you leave with that boy?”
“Yes,” John smiled at him. Oliver looked to his grandparents, who wore the same encouraging smiles, then to his uncle. “You’re helping?”
“Is it because I look like him?” Oliver asked, his voice hardly audible. John spit in the sink and turned off the water, then looked at his own tired eyes in the mirror. “I’m sorry if… if my being here causes you trouble.”
John frowned. “Does he need information from you again?”
Oliver snorted and shook his head. Caden looked desperate, and sounded sincere. Oliver believed him, and hoped it was the right thing to do. “Okay,” Oliver said. “I forgive you, but I’m done taking those pills.”
“Should I stay?” Mycroft asked.
“So how’s that boy?” asked Lestrade. “Oliver, right?”
me here?”
John tried again. “You like music?”
John hadn’t entirely decided yet, and the Saturday a week before Oliver’s birthday, John asked about it. “Is there anything thing you’d like for your birthday?”
They arrived at the hospital and had to wait two long hours, and it was dark when Oliver came out of surgery. His doctor materialized in front of them, and John jolted, not realizing he had been entirely zoned out.

“There’s no doubt he will.”

Sherlock’s fingers curled on the table, and John saw the leftover scarring on his wrist where Sherlock used to have a dark bruise and a splint. John took his wrist and ran his thumb over it. He couldn’t recognize what made the scar.
Then they left to go to the hospital, hoping for good news.
“I wouldn’t change what I did,” Sherlock said, voice low. He looked down at the table. “But I did regret it everyday while I was out there.”
“D-ad,” his voice cracked, and John whipped around in his chair. Oliver was sitting on the edge of the couch, his hands gripping the edge, looking like he might vomit. His pupils were blown and he’s shaking, trying to take a deep breath that kept hitching in his throat. Panic attack.
“I hate maths,” Seemed to be the end of
John could probably see the anxiety on his face, and he said, “Sherlock and I are working with Mycroft to figure out who was planting them and why. That’s actually why he’s out right now.”
“Is Sherlock going to move into your room, then?” She asked, leaned over the sink to wash some dishes.
Oliver nodded. “Thank you.”
It took Sherlock a long, draining fortnight to get to where he needed to be in East Russia. He knew where the main bases of operation for the people working under Moriarty were, and he had a plan to take them out. In the time it took him to get started under a masked identity, he caught wind of people working for his brother already dismantling the web. He used them as cover.
Can y'all BELIEVE this is the last chapter? AND I ALMOST FORGOT TO POST IT? ....I can't.
John didn’t say anything, feeling like Oliver wasn’t done yet.
! I want to talk to you, honestly, without all these complicated situations around us!”
“I feel a little feverish.”
The flat fell still, and the world rushed around them.
Anna, the new receptionist, asked John on a date.
(See the end of the chapter for
John felt odd talking about Oliver around Sherlock. There were probably a million reasons why but he couldn’t come up with any right off. He avoided looking at Sherlock when he said, “Oliver’s fine, Mrs H, he’s with his grandparents for now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Mrs Hudson knocked on the door while he was in the middle of scrubbing the counter tops, and John called for her to come in. She had a smile and a container of biscuits.
It was only a matter of time until Oliver had another bad panic attack.
Especially the other night, when he came home still a little buzzed off of whatever Caden had given him. Sherlock nor John were in the sitting room or kitchen so Oliver beelined to his room and stayed in there the rest of the night.
The next day, before Oliver came home from his club, John called Mycroft first. He planned on calling Mr and Mrs Holmes after, because of course the matter needed to be discussed with them, but first he wanted to ask Mycroft how hard it would be.
, really. I can’t believe Emily is
“His - This is his guardian, yes,” John answered.
Oliver thought for a moment, pushing a cooked carrot around on his plate. “The school has an astronomy club I joined. Every few Saturdays we meet at the park and stargaze, the club leader has a really nice telescope because his dad works for the UK Space Agency. Oh - but John bought me a telescope for Christmas, so now I can work on astronomy at home with more accuracy, which is awesome, and -”
Oliver pushed the door to their flat open and beelined towards his room, so John let him. He didn’t want to push right now - he had a million questions and needed to sit Oliver down to talk to him, but now wasn’t the time. Oliver would probably spend the next day or two mostly sleeping anyways, now that he’s off the consistent painkillers.
“What do you mean?”
The bathroom door creaked, and John jerked his head up.
(See the end of the chapter for
John closed his book, set it down on the coffee table and picked up his beer. “I hope you don’t mind. It would have been a hassle to switch the furniture around since the other bedroom is upstairs.”
His phone beeped and he checked to see Oliver’s message saying he made to to the park fine. John was just worried, that’s all. He knew Oliver would be safe, but he didn’t trust… other people. Especially after what happened with the dumpster.
Mrs Hudson stood in the kitchen doorway and asked, “Are you two all right?” Which caused them to laugh even more.
, but he just wanted space to think without being analyzed or looked at with worry and pity.
, how difficult would it be to-” he took a breath. “to adopt Oliver?”
“I’m going to search Oliver’s room for cigarettes or any other drugs he might have,” John said, and the words tasted sour in his mouth. He took a sip of his scalding coffee.
John shook his head, “No - I want to. I really do, Ollie, don’t worry.”
“Really, Molly, how have you been?” John asked.
Violet and Sigar were outside waiting to greet them, and after Violet thoroughly embarrassed Mycroft with her doting and held Oliver in a tight hug for a while, she pulled John into a hug, saying she was glad to see him and it’d been too long. Sigar gave him a firm handshake, and told him their visit was all Violet had talked out leading up to it.
In the next chapter there's a scene with a lot of spoken French in it (yes, I shamelessly use Google Translate for it).
“Hey, Johnny,” she said when he sat down.
She scoffed. “As if. I’m the same age as you, but at least I make it look good.”
John paused, not expecting that. Wouldn’t Oliver rather be with family? “Do you - Would you rather stay here? I figured you’d want to be with family.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Oliver hesitated, looking away, then pulled an envelope out from behind his back and handed it to John. “My teacher told me to give this to my guardian.”
Oliver nodded vigorously, panting from his rush to get home. “There’s - there’s a penumbral lunar eclipse in twenty minutes, we could see it from the park! The moon changes color, will you come with me?”
“Oliver, don’t be rude,” scolded Mycroft, and he took the headphones off of Oliver’s head so they hung around his pale neck.
Oliver’s hands slid over the paper before ripping it off and pushing it too the floor. A simple, unmarked cardboard package stared back at him. He glanced at John, then back down and let his hands flit over it to the edges. He worked his fingers under the edge and lifted the cardboard open, then froze, his mouth open and eyes huge.
my age.”
Happy day-after-Halloween! And good luck to anyone starting NaNoWriMo today!
John glowered. “I just - what if this doesn’t work out?”
“No,” Molly said. “Not right now anyways. My little niece is with me for the hols; my sister and her husband are on a cruise until January.”
Sarah gave him a half smile of sympathy that just made him feel worse. “You were a great physician, John, and we’d love to have you back.”
“You smell of alcohol,” Oliver said, after a moment.
His voice was quiet. “John,” he twisted his fingers in the hair at the nape of John’s neck. “You’re too worked up right now.”
A light dusting of snow fell from the sky, and he could almost make out the long strides Oliver made in the snow. A gust of wind hit him and he pulled up his collar a bit, then headed for the park. His leg twinged in pain while the snow fell heavier. Only few cars were out and the sun had set minutes ago, the streetlamps lighting up the sidewalk.
” Oliver imitated her in a high pitched voice.
That didn’t make sense. Oliver stopped walking. “What?”
Sherlock abruptly stepped back and looked away towards the windows, his hands closed into fists.
She nodded, “Give him time.”
Incase you missed it, I'm double updating this week! This means I posted chapter 9 AND 10, so make sure to go back and read the last chapter too!
“Come on, Molly, it’s just going to be a few of us. Like Christmas last year,” he swallowed thickly, trying not to dwell on
About an hour later John didn’t really feel any different than he did before, but now he knew the first few things he could work on. He headed to the shop to buy some groceries. He had enough money in his bank account, the number hadn’t changed in months (probably Mycroft’s doing, as much as John didn’t want to acknowledge it). He just bought the basics so they would make it through the week, figuring he’d bring Oliver to the store with him on Saturday so the boy could pick what he liked.
” Oliver rolled his eyes and brushed by her. He walked over to John’s chair and sat down in it, picking up the book John had left on the table. He opened it to the middle and pretended to read, intending on ignoring her for the rest of the night. She followed him and leaned against the mantle at his side. He didn’t look up.
to be said, but John couldn’t find the words. One thing popped into mind, and he went with it. “Where did you stay last night?”
(go check out her other art!).
Oliver spun his phone in his hand. There’s no way he’d bring Emily even if he did go. She already rat him out to John. He did want to go see Caden, because he wanted them to be okay, but he was still worried. He put a hand to his hair, tugging at a curl. Then he saved Emily’s contact in his phone to speed dial, because if Caden was going to be awful again, he’d rather call her than anyone else right now. If he was going to leave, John didn’t need to know. John was with Sherlock on a case, so what were the actual chances that he’d look at the tracker on Oliver’s phone? He could just go to the warehouse quick and be home quick.
The door opened and Oliver’s doctor walked in with her clipboard. Oliver wondered if doctors just carried those around to look important sometimes.
“I look forward to working with you again,” smiled Sarah, reaching out to shake his hand.
Oliver
!” John shouted. This wasn’t even about the cameras and microphones in the flat anymore. It was about
John ended the call and sighed, running a hand down his face. Christmas rushed towards them, and John still didn’t know what he should do for with Oliver. A call back from Mrs Holmes should be coming to see if they wanted Oliver at the estate for Christmas or not, and he still had to figure out what to buy the boy.
“I got that call back from your grandmother, she said they’re out of the country the next few weeks,” John explained. “Would you like me to see about you going with your uncle for Christmas?”
all the time!?”
“I can’t keep doing this,” John said, sitting in the back. Sherlock didn’t respond.
(See the end of the chapter for
John tilted his head down and smiled. “He made that much clear when we met. I’m afraid he doesn’t like you, really.”
Then he swung around and pulled a bottle of alcohol from under the sink and poured a glass, downing it in less than a second. Then another. Then he threw the bottle back under the sink and washed all the dishes.
Oliver emerged from his room in his school uniform - a navy blue blazer, dark trousers and a white button up. He put his bag on the kitchen chair and unzipped it to rummage around for something.
She really had no idea, though. She says she’ll leave them be, but if they need anything just to shout because she’s always here. John nodded, and she shut the door behind her.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Come in!”
After pulling apart from the hug, John and Sherlock sat across from each other at the kitchen table. Sherlock spoke, John listened. He still felt angry, and he would for a while but he patiently listened to Sherlock explain where he’d been and why it had taken so long. At the end of his somewhat broken and scattered explanation, they both sat silently for a moment.
had just been in his flat, and he looked every bit the part. John pulled a beer out of the fridge and popped it open. He could only hope he could keep himself together when the boy moved in. How long could he go not looking someone in the face because they resembled their deceased father?
It took a moment, then Oliver looked back down with wide eyes, and flipped it open.
Some of the references will be more subtle, but I thought it was a cool idea.
Mrs Hudson handed them each something to eat and shuffled back down to her flat. John stood in the kitchen, his back to the sitting room while he pulled apart the sandwich, too lost in thought to really be hungry. When he walked back into the sitting room, he thought Sherlock must be the same, as the untouched food sat on the coffee table and Sherlock at the desk, his fingers soundlessly tapping against the table. They stayed in the somewhat comfortable silence for a while when John sat down in his arm chair.
John smiled at him, wondering how he was only fifteen years old and already thinking like that. “Of course not. You don’t have to put yourself in a box.”
“Sherlock’s
“Do you need money?” John asked, trying to remember where he put his wallet.
Oliver and Caden laughed and talked, and things felt fine again.
Oliver’s eyebrows raised and he nodded. “I will! I will, thank you.”
Regaining very little control of himself, Oliver stepped backwards. His body didn’t feel like his own, like his mind had detached and he was watching his entire world fall apart in third person. His heartbeat thrummed in his ears and a voice that didn’t sound like his own shook while it asked, “What do you mean?”
A beautiful charcoal drawing filled the canvas, of the two arm chairs sitting in front of the unlit fireplace. The attention to detail made it look like a black and white photograph, the crinkles in the leather of Sherlock’s chair, and the blanket hanging off the back of John looked like it might actually be a swaying piece of fabric rather than a drawing.
“Well,” Sarah lifted and dropped her shoulder. “We’re shorthanded right now, and could use someone with your level of experience.”
Molly nodded, and gave him a hug. She said goodbye to Mrs Hudson, then turned to Oliver and held out her hand.
John pulled back just a little, “Is that a good enough answer?”
John chewed his lip. “What do you think?”
“Can I see him?” She asked. She looked shaken and tired, and John figured she might be able to talk to Oliver before he’d talk to anyone else.
“Oliver!” John shouted.
“Yes, is something wrong?” John asked.
The next chapter is 100% John and Sherlock, though, so I think you guys will really like it!
“I don’t know! What do you want to to say?” John shouted back.
“All right,” breathed Molly.
“Nonsense,” Mrs Hudson shooed him away from the shove and pulled out a pan. “Now, where’s that boy?”
It happened while they were both at home, thankfully. Saturday morning John woke to rain pounding against his window and his thigh twinging with pain. While relieved it had stopped snowing, it meant the roads would be icy and the sidewalks covered in half-melted muddy snow. At least he didn’t have to work until Monday. He pulled on a jumper - the flat felt a bit chilly - and stumbled down the stairs into the sitting room.
And John laughed. The metaphorical glass that separated them shattered in an instant, and Sherlock choked out a laugh too. It started quiet, then blew into full blown laughs, both of them probably looking insane to poor Mrs Hudson. John could feel his chest tighten, he wanted to cry and scream but all he could do right now was laugh.
“John, must I remind you who has the eyes in the sky, so to speak?” Mycroft said.
He helped Oliver up onto the walkway and sat the boy down on a bench while John called a cab. While they waited, John shifted from foot to foot, glancing to Oliver then back at the street. Oliver’s eyes were blinking sluggishly and he still shook violently. John couldn’t help the mantra in his head,
“I will.”
planned to punch Sherlock, but instead the boy snatched his notebook off the desk, looked Sherlock dead in the eye and said. “I hate you.”
The call ended and John dropped the phone onto the couch, his head pulsing in pain. He needed a shower and a strong coffee.
“Oliver?” John asked, his voice soft. Oliver’s entire back tensed. He looked so small curled up like that. John inched forward and lowered himself to his knees, balancing with one hand still on his cane. He lifted his hand and hesitated before resting it on Oliver’s back.
It’s eleven at night and John hasn’t moved from staring at the spot in the carpet. The waiting room is empty and Sherlock’s taken to pacing around the room, wringing his hands. He sat down, then stood up, walked to the window and stayed there for a minute. Then he walked back over to John and sat down.
The cab pulled up to the kerb in front of the café, and John paid the driver. He stepped out and opened Oliver’s door, holding out a hand. For a moment, John thought Oliver might ignore him, but he gripped John’s arm with shaking hands and pulled himself out of the cab, wobbling a little. They walked into 221, and Oliver leaned against the banister on the stairs, making his own way up. Just in case, John walked behind him, watching his unsteady feet.
John stepped away from the bookshelves, intending on going to check on Oliver and make sure everything was okay. Before he even made it to the kitchen, Oliver charged out of his room, yelling something in French and brushing past John to the living room. John rolled his eyes at the dramatic antics he was used to. He crossed his arms and leaned against the doorway while Oliver paced all over the sitting room, vaulting from French to English as his words tumbled from his mouth.
He saw Sherlock’s hand crinkle the paper he was holding. John sighed, then readjusted his laptop and settled into working again. After a moment, so did Sherlock. They worked in mostly silence until both of them were too frustrated to continue. John felt like they were making zero progress, no matter how much they dug.
Enjoy!
;) I hope you guys enjoyed this one.
I want to know all of your predictions for the next story!! The next one is the longest and the most angst filled. Honestly... it's going to be intense. What do you think will happen?
She didn't say a single thing, just sat there, and eventually Oliver opened his eyes, wondering why. She looked so tired and her brown eyes were red around the edges. Brown like Caden's. Oliver turned his head away.
Christmas swept upon them unexpectedly, and they were back at the Holmes estate for the day. They had an extravagant lunch and exchanged gifts and laughs. Oliver was talkative most of the day, which used to be unusual for him, but now happened often. Mycroft couldn’t make it, but he sent something for everyone, and by the end of the day Oliver had fallen asleep on one of the sofas.
A light snow had started to fall in mid November. John invited Greg over for tea on a Saturday afternoon, just for a chat since the coffee shop they usually met at had been closed for renovations. Greg said hello to Oliver and ruffled his hair. They laughed and talked, shouting at the telly and talking about ridiculous people at their respective works. John told him that he’s working on adopting Oliver, and Greg’s mouth dropped open, then he grinned and squeezed John’s shoulder.
The phone clicked and John shut his eyes, lowering the phone from his face. He looked around the park once more, then numbly made his way back to Baker Street, walking through what felt like a thick fog. He went through the motions of taking off his coat and didn’t even think as he opened the cabinet under the sink where he had put all the alcohol he hadn’t opened. This was his fault,
“I’m the one that told you to come with me,” Sherlock said. “Be mad at me, it’s not your fault.”
“You just need the signatures?” She asked.
Violet sighed. “That boy.”
“Just be careful,” John said. He looked down at the glass all over the floor, glad he had shoes on. Oliver didn’t. “Did you step on any?
The following day he got a call from Molly saying she’d be over for New Year’s Eve with her niece. John walked on eggshells around the topic of Oliver, before she had the same reaction as Lestrade but with a lot more silence followed by the quiet question, “Does he look like him?”
Another impact of his absence. John scratched his nail against the table. A moment passed.
How do you not have him?” John knew first hand the impossibility of avoiding Mycroft Holmes, how could a fourteen year old do it?
“It’s so good to see you again,” said Ella, picking up her notebook off her desk. She sat down in her chair. “I worried about you.”
“Fair.”
“No, we’re shouting!”
“I hope not, I’d rather like to see someone of his talents succeed,” the man responded.
“A few,” John said, looking hesitant. “One in Mrs H’s, two in the hall, and a few around this flat. Even one in my room.”
Oooo, what does Sherlock know?? And hmm, why does Caden's name sound familiar?
John shut his eyes and leaned forward, pressing his forehead on Sherlock’s shoulder. “I’m sorry Sherlock. I’m sorry everything is so awful.”
John sat across from him and Mrs Hudson at the head of the table. Oliver didn’t speak much, pushing his food around on his plate and chewing silently. Mrs Hudson spoke about the café downstairs and the rude trash collector. John nodded and commented when expected. He drank his tea and took a bite of toast but it made him feel sick.
That weekend when Sherlock was out for some reason and John and Oliver were home, they sat in the kitchen while waiting for dinner to cook. Oliver was trying to read, but his leg was bouncing and he had to keep re-reading the same paragraph.
“I don’t think he can,” John said. “At least not at the intensity that either the Holmes brothers can, but he’s very smart. I think he pretends to be less smart than he really is, actually.”
Oliver looked at John, then to Mrs Hudson. “Sorry?”
He wished John would just stay home with him instead of going with Sherlock.
Sherlock took John’s hand from the side of his head and folded their fingers together on the pillow between them. It started to rain outside, the drops tapping on the glass of the window.
John took another moment to compose himself, then took out his phone and opened the GPS tracker and watched as Oliver made his way towards the park. The little dot on his screen stayed at the park, and when John felt sure Oliver didn’t intend on leaving, he pulled on his jacket, grabbed Oliver’s - which the foolish boy had left behind - and left the flat.
Oliver’s fingers loosened slightly on his coat, while his sobs slowly turned into hiccuping breaths. He pulled his face away from John’s shoulder and sniffed, bringing his wet sleeve up to rub across his nose. John brushed Oliver’s hair out of his face and lifted his chin up.
Sherlock was looking now too, his brow drawn and head tilted, fingers paused over the laptop keys. John moved out of his chair. Another attack? They hadn’t happened his often for over a year now. God, Oliver’s been set so far back. Maybe he should go back on his medication.
His face was devoid of any telling emotion, other than his tired eyes and the downturn of his lips.
I struggled with this one a lot, but I hope you guys enjoyed it!
They weren’t staying the night, because Violet and Sigar had a plane to catch headed for Paris at dawn. After a few minutes of exchanging hushed words, not to wake Oliver, Violet pulled John into a hug and Sigar shook his hand in farewell.
Summer moved slowly, the days dry and humid. The sun doesn’t always come out, but when it did John and Oliver took walks through the park. Once in awhile Oliver asked if they could go out with his telescope at night, wanting to keep up with what his club had been studying during the school year. Some days things were quiet around the flat, and they could go hours without a word spoken between them. John sat in his chair, typing or reading or watching the telly, and Oliver sat in the other armchair, drawing or twisting the rubik’s cube. On days like those, John wondered why he was ever hesitant about bringing this boy into his life. Everything seemed frozen peacefully in time, not a whisper could be heard from the outside world, only the serenity and soft movement from inside the castle they’d built around themselves. And then - John understood what Oliver meant when he said it felt like he was the only grounded person in the world, and everything else was rushing around him.
Oliver lifted his hands and thread them through his hair, pulling while a choked sobs shook his entire body. He buried his face farther into his legs. It broke John’s heart to watch, but he knew Oliver wanted to deal with it alone. So he stood up, stepped away and waited by the couch. He would stay in case Oliver needed him, but gave him the space he wanted.
“Oh, and your grandparents invited us to spend the weekend at their house.”
“Yes, I’ll help,” Mycroft said. “It’d do you well to call my parents, talk to them about it. I know they’ve wanted this for a while and were hesitant about your reaction.”
Oliver wet his lips, ran his hand through his hair and tugged at some of his curls, “I don’t - I already stick out enough. People think I’m weird.”
“Are you going to go after him? It’s a bit nippy out.”
Surprised by the question, John looked up, to the left of Oliver’s face, and drew his eyebrows together. “Er - through a mutual colleague, I guess. We were both looking for a flatmate.”
“Is Uncle Mycroft coming over for New Year’s?” asked Oliver.
The door opened immediately. “Did he really not tell you about me?”
John hesitated. “Fine, I guess. Better than I had been.”
Oliver had a minor panic attack a few days into February, and he let John sit on the couch with him during it, but other than that, things were going well at Baker Street.
. John why those two years were harder on him more than anyone else. It was more than just losing a best friend, and John was starting to realize maybe Sherlock thought the same thing. They loved each other. He realized both of them knew it, but neither of them would say it.
Make sure you didn't miss the chapter I posted last Thursday (there were two last week)! That was chapter 10!
He made his decision, and let the flat. The clock on his phone read almost one in the afternoon, and he figured he’d aim to be back home by two. He crept past Mrs Hudson’s and out the flat, shutting the door softly. He didn’t know if John had told her to keep an eye on him or not.
“How do you figure that out?”
THANK YOU SO MUCH to everyone who commented, gave me kudos and bookmarked this story!! I love you all sooo much and you're the reason this series keeps going.
“Perfect, thank you,” John said. She insisted on a hug and told him to say goodbye to Oliver for her, then left the flat in a flurry. Oliver was still in the bathroom and John turned to the sink to wash the plates and silverware, then put them on the drying rack.
“Thank you,” John said, squeezing his arms, then pulling Oliver forward into a hug. He stood up after a second.
John just stood there, watching his child’s face for a moment. He didn’t want to leave Oliver here, he didn’t want to go, but Oliver was clearly not going to talk to him. He looked like he didn’t even want to be near them and it broke John’s heart. It’d be better to give Oliver some space, though, just until he’s more willing to talk. But he doesn't want to leave again, he can’t bring himself to.
Oliver nodded.
The reason I pushed back the date to two weeks from now, is because I'm starting college in a few days and don't want to worry about updating for a bit. I hope you all understand.
John glanced at the boy again. His feet had dropped back to the ground and he bent over the notebook, his pencil running all over the page, concentration by the set of his shoulders. Oliver still felt like a mystery yet to be solved.
John walked back into the living room after ending a call from his sister. She just wanted to check in and chat with him for a bit, which he always enjoyed. Sherlock looked up when he stepped into the sitting room, and opened his mouth to say something, but his phone rang and cut him off. John moved to sit on the couch with his laptop while Sherlock checked his phone.
Oliver’s brain stopped working.
John nodded. “During my time in Afghanistan, I knew someone who developed a panic disorder. Their way of coping was to focus their mind and hands on something. I figure this might work for you. You’ll start to think about solving the puzzle rather than what’s causing you distress.”
“This is incredible,” John told him.
John hadn’t thought much about where Sherlock will sleep when Mrs Hudson returns from her sister’s house, because they didn’t know how long she’d be gone and Sherlock couldn’t sleep on the couch forever. Oliver sure as hell won’t give up his room, and John wouldn’t even think to make him. That room belonged to Oliver now. For a moment, John considered putting a second bed in his room, but there were so many reasons that wouldn’t work and before his brain could start listing them, Sherlock interrupted.
He turned on the telly for background noise, then opened up the document he had been writing in for almost a year. John knew none of it would ever be posted onto his blog. That was a thing of the past, and he talked about so many personal things - his life with Oliver, those months after Sherlock’s death, thoughts he had on bad days, his confusion - all of it needed to stay private. Someday he might just delete all of it. Not any day soon, but in the future when he didn’t need to write to think.
” for ten minutes.
It passed quickly, then Oliver practically bounced on his feet as he stared out the window waiting for the sun to disappear. The soft orange glow accentuated the reddish tint to his hair and bounced off his blue eyes, making them look like the the glowing sky itself. The the sun vanished below the horizon and Oliver bolted to his room to use his telescope.
“I slept on Molly’s couch.”
“Yes,” Mycroft said, clearing his voice. “Oliver called me, a few weeks ago, and told me that he wanted you to adopt him.”
I'm doing a DOUBLE UPDATE this week, meaning I'm posting chapters 9 and 10!
Oliver looked tired during breakfast, but still gave his grandmother a soft smile and answered his grandfather’s questions about London.
,” the mouth moved, but it wasn’t Oliver’s voice.
John cleared his throat. “Oliver’s going to come back tomorrow before lunch. He doesn’t like being away.”
Oliver gave John ‘a look’ right back. “Don’t tell me that
John snapped his book shut, startling Sherlock, and stood. He grabbed an extra blanket and dropped it on the couch for Sherlock, then walked up to his room without saying anything else. Things were awkward enough, and John was prepared for the little sleep he’d get that night.
“But -
John chuckled, listening to her. The phone beeped and Violet said she put him on the speaker so both of the could talk.
“Hang on,” John said. “I have something else for you.”
the standard and goes to the required classes,” explained the advisor.
“Don’t worry about me, John,” Molly said. “I spent a few weeks over in Harlow with my sister’s family.”
“You can bring her along,”  John encouraged. “How old is she?”
There were two packs of cigarettes in his room, and he felt a surge of anxiety. He rushed into his room and dug the first one out from between two unused canvases, and rooted around his bed, trying to find the other one. It had been crammed between his mattress and the wall. It must have fallen. He slid to the floor and looked under his bed, but it wasn’t there. Where the hell did he put it? Wait - did they search the flat last night?
John took a breath. “At first glance. But not really.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“How did it go?” Oliver asked, not looking up.
It didn’t hurt. It didn’t feel like he had been punched again.
. John must know, because Oliver came home blatantly smelling like cigarettes, and Sherlock graciously pointed out he’d taken drugs. Oliver put down his sandwich, suddenly not hungry. The look on John’s face when Sherlock asked what he was on made Oliver sick. He dumped his sandwich in the trash.
Regarding technical stuff:
Really, Harry was glowing. Her smile upon seeing him was big and genuine; gone were the dark rings around her eyes that plagued her for years, and the glinting silver ring on her finger reminded John of why. Her fiancée, Genevieve, was so good for her.
(See the end of the chapter for
The sun had already sunk below the horizon, and Mrs Hudson yawned, then said goodnight. She’d be off somewhere else for all of tomorrow, so she wished them a happy Christmas and John gave her a gift early (tickets for a cruise in a few weeks), then said goodnight.
“There’s no stopping her now, John,” Sherlock said from the sitting room. Mrs Hudson was already pulling out dishes. She started making some kind of vegetable dish, when Oliver came out of his room for the first time today. He looked really rough, eyes dark and sunken, his skin clammy and he stumbled when he walked into the kitchen.
Their evening filled with warmth, all of them in good moods. They enjoyed dinner together in the kitchen, and sat in the living room after, content to be in each other’s company in front of the fire with snow gently tapping the windows outside.
” Oliver tugged at his hair. “
Oliver’s stomach twisted and he dug his nails into the doorframe, looking away from Sherlock. “You don’t know what you’re talking about.”
One of the dreams started on the embankment, where Oliver fell, but the railing was missing. John looked down at the black water, then at Oliver, standing in front of him. Oliver smiled and shoved John in the chest, pushing him off the wall. John fell in slow motion, reaching up, and just as he hit the ice water, Oliver vanished in a burst of black ravens.
The door creaked open again and he suppressed a sigh. He wanted to be alone.
John put his hand on Oliver’s arm to get his attention, “How do you feel?”
I love hearing what you guys think about the chapters and it actually benefits the story a lot!
No, he couldn’t fix himself and “going back to before” didn’t exist. He just didn’t know how to start a new life altogether. Maybe going back to therapy would be a good first step.
Oliver felt itchy all of the sudden. “Were there any in my room?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s difficult,” admit John. “Anytime I see his face, I see Sherlock.”
“Yes, well, I’d love to adopt Oliver. As long as everyone’s all right with it, I know how big this is, and what it means for everyone,” John explained, feeling the nervousness bleed back into his gut.
John glanced at Sherlock, then nodded.
“Are you bleeding?” John asked, walking over to him, being careful of the glass.
John hesitated then nodded. “Okay. Okay we’ll go home.”
John tried to roll over what he’d learned. There were obvious pieces to the puzzle missing, and he didn’t know if Sherlock left them out intentionally or accidentally. He knew it was Sherlock’s call towards danger that kept him out there. Sherlock could have come home at anytime, but the man’s stubbornness to finish the job kept him away.
Probably won't happen again, but here you go!
Hello to those of you who stuck around for the second chapter! I'm Silver, and welcome to WYCQR!
Oliver nodded and John left. As soon as the door closed Oliver took a deep breath. He didn’t want to have the conversation with John about the smoking, the drugs,
On a totally unrelated note, are any of y'all Dan and Phil fans? If you are, and are going to the Interactive Introverts tour, hmu
“John,” Sherlock’s voice sounded just as raw as John felt. John lifted his head, then Sherlock moved forward and kissed him.
“Why don’t you go talk to Oliver,” Molly encouraged, nudging Emily in his direction. The boy looked content, reclined on the couch with a mug of hot chocolate. He observed Mycroft and Lestrade’s animated discussion about some kind of political thing John didn’t care about.
Oliver lounged on his bed, his door shut. Sherlock was out in the living room and John would be coming home from work soon. He didn’t really like being home with Sherlock all day because it felt so weird, and they didn’t talk, so he stayed in his room.
“I don’t mind,” John said.
“Ugh!
Sherlock sighed and the couch dipped when he sat down on the other end. The silence came back, and John could feel every single inch between them, sitting like strangers on opposite ends of the couch.
“Dizzy-” Oliver gasped, shutting his eyes tight. John nodded, moved to the side, then guided Oliver until his head was tucked between his knees. Oliver crossed his arms over his head, gasping for breath while John put a steady hand on his shoulder. This wasn’t a bad one, and Oliver didn’t take long to come out of it.
Sherlock looked up, but didn’t say anything, holding John’s eye contact. John watched as Sherlock’s eyes surveyed every inch of his face, not quite sure what Sherlock was looking for.
It was two hours after she arrived that she said goodbye and left the flat. Oliver had taken to laying on the couch, while Sherlock and John laid out their case notes across the table and desk in the sitting room. There’s newspaper clippings and scripts from the unsuccessful interrogations, photographs, and files from the base they raided.
He became more excited with each word, sounding more awake and more passionate. Violet listened patently, with a fond smile as Oliver told her about the astronomy club, his drawings, and his new school schedule. Sigar encouraged him to talk about his classes, even the ones he hated, but Oliver stayed in a good mood, excited to tell his grandparents about everything that had been going on in the past few months.
As always, please please leave a review telling me what you think of this chapter! Two words or a paragraph, I reply to every single comment!
how smart Oliver could be.
“And you?” asked Sigar, looking at him with an eyebrow raised. “How are you doing?”
“It just had water in it.”
Oliver took a deep breath and nodded again. Then he walked over to the bookshelf, picked up his sketchbook and pencils and slid to the floor near John’s arm chair, his back against the side of the unlit fireplace. John sat in his armchair and picked up his book.
“Sherlock call an ambulance,” John said and Sherlock rushed away to find a phone.
Lestrade invited him out for coffee again after work on Friday. He left Oliver to his own after the boy promised to work on some of his missing assignments. John trusted Oliver to keep his word, and said to call him if he ran into any problems.
“Hello, is this Oliver Holmes’ father?”
leave, he was so guilty for leaving yesterday. He knew Oliver was safe here, and he knew Mycroft himself could probably watch Oliver, or even have one of his men make sure Oliver was safe at all times. They really did need to find out who did this, especially if it was related to who was spying on them. It’d be better now than when Oliver comes home.
She reached out and took Oliver’s hand. “You look just like him,” she said. Then she smiled wide and shook his hand. “Welcome to Baker Street, dear.” She pat his cheek and turned back to the stove, all business again. “Now, how do you like your eggs?”
John knows this. None of it was Sherlock’s fault, either.
“It went horribly. Don’t let me do something like that again.”
Here's the translation for Oliver's French when he began arguing with Emily:
His fingers itched for a cigarette to dull his thoughts away, and his stomach knotted, because John
John glanced up and caught odd expression cross Oliver’s face, but he kept his head tilted towards the table. “He never told you…?”
John nodded. Oliver looked up the steps and nodded too. “I want to punch him,” he said, then started walking.
So, not super happy with this chapter. There's probably mistakes because I only had time to skim-edit it. But oh boy. This is where everything really STARTS. Also... yikes. You guys may
“What?” Oliver asked.
John nodded. Oliver lifted the mug and practically chugged his tea. John felt like he needed to do more. Were kids already independant at thirteen? Could John be missing something vital? Why did he think he could take care of a kid again? He couldn’t do this, he was going to screw up and -
John kissed him again, hand on Sherlock’s collar, holding him in place. Sherlock put his hands on John’s shoulders and gently pushed him back.
“Afternoon, Violet,” John smiled, her motherly voice immediately putting him to ease. “How have you been?”
“Have they ever been that bad before?”
John looked out at him again too. Sigar was saying something, causing Oliver to giggle a little and look up at the night sky.
They really were lucky Oliver was alive.
That was a good idea. Oliver had obviously thought about it before, and if that’s what he wanted, John would try to make it happen. He nodded, “Okay. I’ll see what I can do for you. But you have to promise me you’ll raise your marks.”
It clicked for John and he smiled, realizing she loved that boy.
Oliver nodded, inspecting the cube and letting out a deep, shuddering breath. He turned it over in his hands while saying, “I hate having attacks like this. I don’t even know where I get it from.”
John grabbed his wrist, making him turn, and gave him a look. “Can we attempt to be civilized? When was the last time you saw him?”
His life with Oliver had become steady and quiet, things having finally found a routine between them. But with the routine came nothing interesting. John was back to doing practically the same thing everyday and he could feel himself falling back into a hole again. It sucked, but the past few weeks he had been doing everything to avoid that.
Oliver pulled something out of his pocket and put it on the table. Orange and yellow stripes decorated the tie. “I’m not wearing it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Oliver laughed. “No!”
John rolled his eyes. “All right,
The tip off was a bust, and the lead turned out to be a cold trail that lead to nothing. John and Sherlock are disappointed and on edge, sitting in the back of a cab on the way home after getting into a fight. They had been out the whole day, chasing the lead that turned out to be a dead end, and now the sun was setting and night was drawing in. The day had passed so quickly, John lost track of the time and never even got a chance to call Oliver or check in on him.
The month went on, and June came. Oliver did well enough on his exams, so he’ll continue to stay in the year ahead, and John told him about the vacation he planned. They decided on going east to Botany Bay, a rural area with a beautiful white rock cliffside beach and a small town. Oliver didn’t want to go overseas, and John was okay with staying closeby. Oliver told John in excitement the sky would be a lot more clear over the ocean, and he wanted to bring his telescope.
“Oh, yes! How is that going?”
“Ollie, why don’t you show John around the house?” suggested Violet. “Show him to one of the guest rooms.”
to leave Oliver
Sherlock had been sitting next to him, quiet, for the past few minutes. The bed dipped a little under their weight, and they weren’t saying anything to each other. Just sitting -
Oliver and John stayed busy, but spent evenings at the flat and made sure to have dinner together every night, as they sometimes missed each other in the morning. They went to the grocery together on Saturdays, and after John occasionally met with Lestrade, and once with Harry on a Sunday for breakfast.
Oliver knew they were trying to one up each other with the compliments and he laughed at how childish and unnecessary it seemed.
Mycroft picked them up around nine in the morning on Saturday. The ride to the estate was long and quite but not really awkward. Oliver spent the time staring out the window and absently twisting his rubik’s cube. John leaned his elbow on the door and read one of his books until they got there. John had met Violet and Sigar Holmes a small handful of times, and had been to the estate once, and though it was barely a ten minute visit he already knew the house was massive and filled with expensive furniture. Sherlock had once said something about their being two libraries. He wondered if during that ten minute visit, had Oliver been in the mansion somewhere?
Mrs Hudson came up to their flat with cupcakes before they left for the Holmes estate the day before Oliver’s birthday. She wished him a happy birthday and gave him a tight hug, leaving him flustered and looking embarrassed, but John knew he loved how doting she acted towards him.
Oliver snapped, “
John watched Olive’s face go through a few complicated emotions before he turned away. John turned from the photos too, and looked at the opposite wall, which was covered in drawings. Some were obviously done by a much younger Oliver, in crayon and on colorful paper, but they matured and John recognized the realistic style Oliver drew with now.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Is Oliver bringing any friends?”
Greg invited them to a New Years party at some fancy venue. Most of NSY would be attending, and Greg told him to invite whoever he wanted. Mrs Hudson had went out of town to visit someone, so John invited Harry and her girlfriend, hoping to finally meet her.
They try the beach again, going around lunchtime the next day when Oliver looked a little more comfortable and there are less people. They find a place close the water, but shaded by the cliffs. John stood ankle deep in the water, breathing in the smell the ocean and digging his toes into the soft sand.
John led both of them up to the flat, and set out the tea he had made, then sat in the chair next to the coffee table. Mycroft sat down on the couch, crossing his foot over his knee. Oliver looked around the flat, his blue eyes flicking to this and that, his headphones back over his ears, before he sat down next to Mycroft.
When the bathroom door opened again, John didn’t look up, but told Oliver he left a plate in the oven for him. Oliver slid by and pulled the plate out, still warm, and walked into the living room. John finished with the dishes and put him in the dish rack, then picked up a towel off the counter to dry his hands. He looked up and saw Oliver set his plate down on the desk, pause and then spin to look at John.
“Things are going to be different no matter what,” John told him. “We can’t go back to the way things were. We can try moving forward.”
“Afternoon, John,” greeted Mycroft.
“Ah - I can’t say he is,” John said. “I think he’s still having a bit of trouble with making friends.”
“Mhm, I got your advisor to talk to me,” John said. “He said if you raise your marks to a standard, after the holidays he’ll help change up your curriculum.”
He opened a few cabinets, knowing he had an extra bag of sugar somewhere, and reached into the back of the cabinet by the doorway. He pulled the bag down, glad Oliver hadn’t dug into it yet - he used way too much sugar in his tea - and was about to shut the cabinet when something shiny caught his eye. John did a doubletake, then raised onto his toes and reached into the back of the cabinet. His fingers brushed against something metal, and he pulled down a small black object.
A grin threatened to split Oliver’s face, “Thank you, thank you so much, John.”
Reposting from last chapter:
He looked down, confused, and Caden yanked his arm away. Oliver gasped, doubling over at the sharp feeling of something being
John nodded, turned to look at his laptop screen again. “Next time, if - if you need anything? What should I-”
Later on when the fire roared and everyone found easier conversation, John pulled Molly away from one of Mrs Hudson’s tales to try and talk to her. He wanted to know if she was as okay as she said.
Oliver looked up. The knot in his stomach started to untwist a little. “What?”
“What - what are we - we going to do?” John stuttered out between laughs and gulps of air.
Sherlock saved the sentence. “I can understand the reasons.”
He enjoyed when Emily visited a few of the afternoons, because she acted like everything was normal which made it easier to talk to her. No pressure, no pitying looks, and she didn’t seem mad at him, like he’d been afraid of. They just talked for about an hour, or until Oliver was too tired to keep his eyes open, then she’d crack one last joke and end up leaving silently.
A moblie of the solar system hung over the cluttered desk, paper stacks and books and pencils all over it. The bedspread was a dark lavender and neatly made. The wardrobe built into the wall hung open, and a mirror shone from inside the mostly barren area. Near the window a few pictures were hung up and John stepped forward to look closer. Oliver as a tiny baby, his dark hair just starting to curl and his eyes too big. One of Violet holding Oliver as a toddler in a garden - the baby reaching out towards a purple flower. An older Oliver, around ten or eleven, hanging from a tree by his knees, a huge grin on his face.
He rubbed his face and sat up, asking, “Yeah?”
John refused to push him into talking and if he tried, he’s sure Oliver wouldn’t be able to hear him through the headphones. So they sat in silence. John stared at a black search page on his laptop. He had nothing else to do, and didn’t know how to get back into his old way of life. What even was there before Sherlock? Suicidal tendencies, that’s what.
“Yeah…” John looked into his mug. “I should probably give a few people a call.”
Oliver walked into the living room and John looked up at him from the chair. His wet curly hair shined, and he pursed his lips. He didn’t say anything as he looked from John to Sherlock’s armchair, then back to John. Oliver stepped forward, lifted his foot and put it onto the cushion of the chair, dust drifting off it and swirling into the air. He pressed his foot down and lifted so he was standing on the cushion, then turned around and sunk down so his legs were crossed.
Oliver lowered his hands and gently lifted the stunning black telescope from it’s packaging. He glanced between John and the telescope a few times, speechless, before finally stuttering out, “Th- thank you, thank you so much! God, this is gorgeous! Can - will you help me set it up? Right now? I want to use it as soon as it gets dark. Please? Wow, this is wonderful.”
“John!” Ella greeted him with a big smile that made him cringe a bit. She shook his hand and he took his spot in the chair across from her. Maybe he should have chosen a different therapist. Nothing against Ella, just… the room, and all the things he used to talk about in it.
“Of course I am!” John snapped at him. “First you coming back, the Oliver starting to get distant again, then all this!”
“It is.”
alone anymore.
That’s how John found himself on the phone with Sarah (he had hoped it would be anyone else) one evening, setting up an interview for his old position. He went in the next day, and Sarah sat across from him at a table, but didn’t ask all the usual questions. She didn’t mention his cane or the reasons he left, and John was grateful for that.
John gaped at him. “Molly? Hooper?”
Eventually, John had to head back to work. He left promising Harry he’d call more often, and telling her she needed to come visit more and bring her fiancée too. He left the shop feeling lighthearted and happy for her.
“It’s fine.” Oliver drew his knees up and opened his notebook, hiding his face from view. Conversation over.
Anxiousness flitted around in his chest the rest of the time, and kept checking the tracker just incase, but it barely moved the whole hour.
“Are you sure you’ll be fine?” asked John. “The wind is pretty bad.”
“I was captured close to the time I was trying to come home,” Sherlock said. “I blocked a hit from a crowbar. It still hurts sometimes.”
“Here,” John stood and walked over to the bookshelf, shuffled some things around until he found what he was looking for. Then he walked back to Oliver, sat down and handed him the object.
“What will it take?” John asked, more confident this time. How long had Oliver been wanting to asked this? Why didn’t John consider it before? It just made sense to adopt Oliver, and to make everything official like that.
i haven't heard that name in years
That night he had another nightmare, of Sherlock rising from his grave that day in the cemetery and dragging John into the coffin, trapping him for eternity. He shot awake and resigned himself to another sleepless night.
John winced. “That’s really not -”
“Let’s just go to bed,” Sherlock said.
-Also, I plan on updating on Mondays every week.
“Go on,” encouraged John. He couldn’t wait to see the reaction.
John came downstairs the next morning after not surprisingly getting almost no sleep. Sherlock had stayed up with him all night while they lay in his bed together, not really talking. Despite this, Sherlock was still out of bed and downstairs before John. After filling the kettle and plugging it in, he glanced down the hall, and Oliver’s door was still shut.
And here is the final chapter in this work. Don't worry! There's a third part to this series, but more about that at the end of the chapter.
“Wh- you knew?”
John rolled his eyes and breathed a chuckle, then motioned for Oliver to walk up the stairs. “You can’t hit him though.”
Oliver abruptly stood up, “I have to - um,” he waved his hand towards the bathroom and disappeared down the hall.
Oliver cut him off and John wondered how long he should let them shout like this. If not now, it would happen later, but it was a little frustrating not knowing what they were saying.
John frowned, “When? Why, Oliver? Those are supposed to help.”
“I was so scared,” John whispered. Oliver felt his heart thud - John worried for him? He pulled away and met John’s eyes. The man looked awful but genuine.
John quickly snapped out of his shock, and tried to offer a convincing smile, holding out his hand. “You can call me John.”
-These first two chapters being the exception, I will be updating weekly. I have almost all 18 chapters written right now, so don't worry about late updates. I try to keep the chapters between 3k and 5k words long.
He pulled his hands away from his face and dropped them to the table, looking back at Sherlock, the thick silence dancing around them once more. Neither of them knew what to do, where to go from here.
“Fuck,” John breathed, then stood up and paced away, running his hands through his hair a few times. “How did we not notice this?
Oliver still felt weird. Someone could hear everything he said to anyone in his room for who knows how long. It make his skin prickle and he felt sick.
, I guess. Does it matter what’s in their pants?” Oliver mumbled.
“And you, Johnny?” Harry asked. “You’ve called me outta the blue after not hearing a word from you in months. Is everything all right? You’re not about off yourself or anything?”
“I, um… wanted to read your blog. If - if that’s okay?” Oliver asked nervously.
“John, John! Slow down.”
“Was the cup clean?”
“I don’t - want to be the new kid again,” he started. “The beginning of this year was hard enough, being new, and I already stand out. My accent’s posh, and I’m younger than everyone in my year. I finally
Oliver stood on the couch, helping Mrs Hudson string fairy lights along the ceiling. Mrs Hudson swayed to the music, talking to Oliver about this and that. Oliver nodded along politely and stepped up onto the back of the couch to reach higher.
“Yeah. Yeah, I’m just going to give him a moment to cool down.”
It’s been half an hour since Oliver sent a text to Caden and Emily, asking them to come over. Just waiting for them made him antsy, he didn’t want to sit and do nothing with John and Sherlock and their awkward brief words. The air in the flat radiated tension and discomfort, making him restless. Finally, he heard the knocking on the downstairs door.
John sighed, tearing his eyes from Sherlock and looking down. Sherlock walked forward, and put his hand on John’s shoulder. John closed his eyes, wanting desperately to lean into him, and then Sherlock pressed his forehead against John’s and they stayed there like that. Just breathing each other in - once again, in silence.
Oliver woke up in the afternoon, not remembering falling asleep. He tensed when he heard someone shift next to him and whipped his head to look. Sherlock was sitting in the chair, a little ways away from the bed. Oliver didn't care enough to be angry at Sherlock anymore. He didn't have energy at all.
John stood too and leaned his hands on the table. “We’re doing what’s best for
Oliver’s door creaked and they both looked, Sherlock dropping his hands. Oliver stumbled into the kitchen, bumping the table with his hip, making it squeak. There was a sheen of sweat on his face, and his skin looked clammy. His right hand grasped at his abdomen, pulling his jumper taut, and his left hand steadied him against the table. His whole frame seemed to vibrate, and he swayed, eyes unfocused.
John glanced up from his laptop at the clock, it was seven PM. “Where?”
. It's in bold and italics because it wasn't obvious enough when I proof-read it when it was only italics.
John watched him, and hesitated, but said, “Leave your door open.”
“About what?” He managed to keep his voice even. Did Sherlock talk to John? What did Sherlock even know? Oh God, Oliver was dead. John was going to murder him and send his corpse to his grandparents. This is the end.
John had nightmares that night, about the night by the pool, watching himself and Sherlock get pumped with bullets from the snipers all around him. He woke up in a cold sweat and it took him a few hours to actually get out of bed. Most of the day sucked, even though he didn’t have to work, and he still felt detached - he knew Oliver picked up on it too.
John nodded, wondering how much Sherlock would say on the subject. Mycroft’s reasoning for Sherlock never mentioning the child had to be guess work at best. Perhaps Sherlock truly did never think to say anything about it. John didn’t want to know the answer, it didn’t matter anymore. Oliver meant the world to him, and that’s what John cared about.
(See the end of the chapter for
John didn’t know how long he’d be gone, but as soon as the man left the building John felt an odd pressure lift from his chest and he took a deep breath. Everything was complicated again, and he didn’t know how to fix it. He ended up walking downstairs to talk with Mrs Hudson for a bit.
John stepped forward and snapped his fingers to get Oliver’s attention. “Oliver,” he said patiently. “I can’t understand you. English, please.”
“Tell us about school, Ollie,” Violet encouraged during dinner.
Caden turned to face him, a few steps away, and smirked at him. “Well, I ruined you and it took them this long to notice.”
He slammed his computer shut and yanked on his coat while pulling up the tracking map on his phone. John ran from the flat, his feet sliding across a patch of ice, then ran in Oliver’s direction, his eyes glued to the screen. Oliver was close to the Thames, and John stepped off the curb to hail a cab, knowing he couldn’t catch up on foot.
“You think he’ll be okay? At least physically?” John asked.
“If I make breakfast, will you eat?” John asked. Saying pleasantries when they never had before would just make everything awkward again, full of hesitation and silence. He couldn’t stand it. Sherlock knew it to, and John hoped he would try to act normal if John did.
At one in the morning, John had yet to fall asleep. He stared up and counted the headlights that flashed across his ceiling and the heartbeats between them until he heard the front door open and shut. He knew it was Sherlock finally coming home, and his heart ached in his chest.
“Did he know what it was?”
Mrs Hudson knew, of course, that Oliver had gotten hurt. John threw the rag he had been using into the sink. “He’s asleep right now. Healing. I’m not sure how - how
John looked desperately back at Sherlock, but he looked just as lost.
The next day, they had a little post-Christmas with the fire roaring and some leftovers from lunch at the estate. Oliver ran into his room, saying he had something for John that wasn’t ready the day before. He walked back out a moment later, looking a little embarrassed, but then held out a small canvas with a painting on it. John took it and stared in awe.
Sherlock waved towards the door “Oliver's not going anywhere now, and he’s not alone. If anything this is the safest place for him. We have to talk to Mycroft, and there's no better time to track these people than when Oliver’s out of danger. Waiting around isn't going to catch whoever did this to him.”
The next few weeks passed quickly, and Oliver passed all his exams, not to the surprise of John. He received Oliver’s final marks the day before his last day of school, and once again he was one of the top students in his class. Oliver would be home before John on his last day, as he wouldn’t have his astronomy club, but John figured they would go out to eat somewhere nice to celebrate.
"Comment oses-tu!" means "How dare you!"
“What?” John looked up to Sherlock with wide eyes.
“Sit down,” John chuckled, gesturing to the armchair.
Caden chuckled. “For people who are supposed to be damn smart, I’m surprised they didn’t notice at all before now.”
Then he was gone. John sighed and peered through the kitchen doorway down the hall. Sherlock’s door -
Peaceful, John could almost describe it as. Or maybe a calm before the storm. Many storms.
Sherlock nodded.
Oliver shrugged and looked down at his socked feet, then rubbed his arms.
to make the effort, Oliver,” John said.
“Has he said anything about moving in with me?” asked John, eyes trailing after the boy.
John ended up sitting at the kitchen table with his laptop, idly clicking random news sites and not really reading anything other than the headlines. Sherlock had moved to the desk a little while after John offered him breakfast and he declined. John hated this. He hated how broken they felt and how like strangers their relationship had become.
Another kind of slow chapter... but the NEXT ONE. Oh my god. Things HAPPEN.
Oliver expected John to yell, and he gasped when instead John pulled him into a hug. He felt terrible, he knew the trouble he had caused but he accepted the hug, and buried his face in the warmth of John’s jumper. John must hate him now, he wouldn’t want Oliver around if he caused problems like this. Mycroft had stayed silent in the car, and Oliver knew he was in for it by the look on his Uncle’s face.
Harry started rambling a bit, but John was content to just listen.
John nodded. “Right, good. I’ll talk to him about it.”
Oliver drew his eyebrows together and stood up. He didn’t have any height on her, but he sneered in the way he had seen Mycroft do when he wanted someone to feel small. “What? Forty-two?”
Caden picked up a can and chucked it across the room, letting it clang off a metal door. “So, was your dad mad when you got home? You must have reeked of smoke.”
I think Oliver only said one thing in French this chapter:
“A while ago I found a microphone tap in the cabinet,” John said. “And then I found a camera in the bookshelf.
"Ce n'est pas grave!" = It doesn't matter!
He looked up and took off his headphones.
John woke up first the next morning, which rarely happened. He still wore his jeans and jumper from the night before, and he felt stiff. Sherlock lay next to him, breathing softly, his face calm. John had his arm across Sherlock’s chest, and Sherlock’s arm was under John’s head. He watched the gentle rise and fall of Sherlock’s chest, the contrast of his white pillows against Sherlock’s raven hair, his untucked blue shirt bunched at the middle.
“I’m working on it,” Mycroft said from the side of the room, not looking up from his book.
“It’s still beautiful,” John assured. “I’ll buy a frame for it and we can put it up somewhere.”
Mycroft looked through the doorway towards the boy. “Perhaps.”
After midnight, when it officially became 2012, Mycroft left and offered to drive Lestrade home, as there weren’t many cabs out in the crazy weather. He offered to Molly, but she said they were taking the tube and the station wasn’t too far. Harry waved him off before he could ask. They bid everyone a goodnight and left into the angry storm.
Hey guys! Sorry I missed posting yesterday, I was having a bad day and seriously wasn't in the mood to edit and post this.
Oliver was doing amazing in school, finally finding a way to balance the subjects he hates and the ones he likes. He grew like a weed, John noticed, when they had to go out and get him new clothes. He’d grown to almost John’s height already, and he hoped Oliver would slow down before he passed John. Knowing the Holmes’ genetics, though, it was inevitable.
happens in it, but it needed to be written for their characters and to keep pace with the time. What do you all think? Is it good anyways?
“Do you want any breakfast?”
John smiled, “I can imagine.”
“That’s wonderful,” commented John, but Oliver’s talking went on. He kicked off his shoes, talking about one of the girls who looked through just a shooting star passed over, but Oliver saw it anyways. John loved seeing him be passionate about something. He never really seemed
“When was this taken?” John asked, turning to Oliver.
John put his mug back on the table. He could do this. He could make it work. “There must be a subject you enjoy. Maths?”
The feeling slowly ebbed away, leaving John feeling drained and tired.
Caden spread his arms out, a grin Oliver’s never seen before on his face. “
WARNING for some
John turned to him. “I wouldn’t have agreed if I wasn’t up for it.”
John’s eyes widened and he looked down at Oliver’s stomach where he gripped the jumper, and John could see the blood soaking into the fabric.
Before the call came to a close, Molly said, “Oh, right, John! I have a favor to ask of you.”
“Better to get it over with now,” she said. John hummed in agreement. When he finished helping her with the dishes, he stepped into the hall and text Mycroft, asking if he thinks it’s a good idea to bring Oliver home tomorrow. Mycroft responded saying if that’s what John thought was best, he’d bring Oliver home.
” He continued. “
(Huh, this kinda reminds me of how almost 16 years ago, Sherlock got high and accidentally got a chick pregnant. I'm not hinting at anything, but it's definitely a parallel, so you should watch out for those.)
It took close to half an hour to calm her down (she started shouting after her initial shock faded away). They ended up standing in the living room, Mrs Hudson’s arm around Sherlock’s waist while she halfheartedly scolded him. Sherlock looked thoroughly chastised and a little embarrassed while she rambled on and John listened with amusement. She suddenly cut herself off and gasped, looking to John.
. “A real laugh! It’s been a few days since I’ve heard one.”
Caden nodded eagerly, “Me too. I hate myself for doing that to you.”
“All right, fill me in,” John said.
I know this is a couple days late, I'm really sorry.
The boy stood tall, but not extremely so - the top of his head stopped below John’s chin, all gangly elbows and knees. His pale skin contrasted with his striking cerulean eyes, big like he hadn’t quite grown into them yet. Thick, wildly curly black hair fell into his eyes and tinted red where the light caught it. He wore a t-shirt that hung off his thin frame and had big headphones over his ears. He stared into the entrance way behind John, his lip caught between his teeth.
“I don’t blame you,” John turned to him.
“All right?” Oliver asked.
John tossed a file onto the table and leaned back. “I can’t keep doing this, it’s driving me insane.”
John groggily filled the kettle with water and put it on the stove, trying not to fall asleep standing up. Somehow he broke his streak of restless nights and managed to get six or so hours but still felt like walking death. He reached for the tea, then decided he needed something stronger and scooped instant coffee into his cup instead. It tasted like garbage but they didn’t have anything else for coffee at the moment. God, he actually woke up earlier than this for literal
The three of them couldn’t be called perfect, and John didn’t think they’d ever be anywhere near it. For now, they were halfway to “okay” and that was a start.
John stepped into the large guestroom, which had complete furniture in soothing tans and greens with an ensuite bathroom. John dropped his bag onto the bed and Oliver walked across the room to open the drapes and windows.
Oliver’s eyes were wide and red from crying. He sniffed again and nodded, then leaned his forehead back onto John’s shoulder. His voice cracked when he mumbled, “I wanna go home.”
“Can you breathe all right?” John asked again.
Caden’s fist connected with his forearm and he grunted - Caden’s strength outmatched Oliver’s by a million - his arm went numb. Caden shoved him, and Oliver slammed into a wall, his head snapping off the brick, his vision flashing white. He crossed his arms in front of his face, flinching away, but Caden grabbed his wrists and pulled them away from his face, then slammed him into the wall again.
The three spoke on the phone for close to half an hour, talking about all the details and some other things. Violet and Sigar wanted John to adopt Oliver, because they wanted him to be secured with someone, just in case. They told him originally they thought Oliver would end up somewhere else, after John took care of him for a few months, but after seeing how well he did living with John, they changed their plans.
The three boys looked up, searching the darkness before spotting John. One took off in panic as John ran towards them. One boy jabbed Oliver in the chest, saying something John couldn’t make out before the two lifted Oliver up by the shirt, and shoved him up onto the railing. John’s heart stopped when Oliver teetered backwards, his hands reaching out into the air, searching for something to grab, everything moving in slow motion. Then he fell, and the boys took off running and laughing, but John didn’t even care because in a moment that stretched to infinity, he remembered -
“Really? Right now?” Oliver asked, watching with excitement as John stood up and stretched his arms above his head. John nodded.
Then, very pointedly while only looking at John, said, “Hey
Oliver hissed as John took his hand and uncurled it over the sink. A thin gash stretched from the base of his thumb across to his little finger. It wasn’t bleeding too much, a small pool of blood collecting in his palm and dripping off. John turned on the water and put Oliver’s hand under.
The warmth that radiated between them reminded John that
John frowned and took it from him, then pulled out a short letter from Oliver’s teacher. He read through it and sighed. Apparently Oliver’s marks were some of the lowest in the class from not turning his work in and not paying attention during class. The teacher said if things stayed the way they were she’d have to call in a meeting and if his marks got worse, he may have to return to his own grade level.
“You’re not mad?”
John shook his head. “We asked him, and he was concerned about it.” John started to explain that Mycroft had done some digging and found a small organization in London connected to Moriarty’s people. Of course Oliver new all about that - it had been on the news for months, and though John and him never really talked about it, Oliver knew what it meant to him and Sherlock.
“Do you need me to come in, or does a verbal confirmation do?”
“You’ll have withdrawal symptoms,” John warned. “Even after that, you’ll still have anxiety.”
“So… It can happen? You’ll help?”
He couldn’t do this. John couldn’t do this, why did he think he could, Oliver sounds
“All right?” He asked, pretending to be very interested in his book.
“Oh, it starts Monday I think,” He looked down at his plate and chased an egg across it with his fork.
During a day in early February Oliver left his drawing notebook out on the kitchen table while he went the bathroom. John tilted his laptop screen down to look at it, and saw, with a bit of pride, a finished drawing of John himself sat at the desk in the other room with a cup of tea in front of him, his head turned to look outside at the falling snow. Smiling, John returned to writing and didn’t mention it when Oliver returned to pick up the book and go into his room.
What else? “You remember the way? Want me to walk with you?”
“That’s his old room isn’t it?” Oliver spoke the most words John had heard from him yet. Oliver pointed over his shoulder with his thumb. “Sherlock’s.”
“This is incredible,” John admired. “You used the charcoal I bought you?”
A knock at the door wakes John in the middle of the night.
Emily rolled her eyes. “Yeah, and it’s not weird that you were just ‘in the area’ since you live nowhere near here.”
Oliver whined and John flicked him in the back of the head.
“Ollie -”
Ella gave him a sympathetic smile and nodded. “It can be hard, especially if he resembles his father. But like I said, he is his own person. Don’t make him think you can’t stand him.”
“I’d like to point out the tracking device on your phone is for your safety,” Mycroft said. “And if you choose to abandon it, there are other, more uncomfortable ways, for us to know where you are when you run off.”
Oliver hugged his arms to himself, shaking violently, his blue eyes wide and pale skin a sick blue. John couldn’t even describe the relief that washed over him. He put his wrist against Oliver’s forehead, then the back of his palm to the boy’s cheek. He was ice cold, but alive. That’s what mattered.
So, he shrugged and avoided it a little, “We’re okay. Not much going on right now.”
Emily nodded, and leaned back against the wall a few yards away from them, fidgeting with anxiety. John wondered where Molly was.
“God, John, you lost weight,” she said. She didn’t say anything about his cane.
Mycroft didn’t answer for a moment, and worry twisted John’s gut. What if any of the Holmes didn’t want him to legally have Oliver? Before John could let his mind spiral too much, Mycroft spoke, his voice somewhat fond. “Did he finally ask you?”
John jolted awake in the middle of the night and whipped around to look at Oliver in the other bed. The boy was sitting upright with his hand twisted in his shirt above his heart and his breathing came hard and fast and his skin glinted with sweat, while he looked around with panicked eyes. John threw off his blanket and stepped over to Oliver’s bed, putting his hand on the boy’s shoulder and shaking him a little.
,” Caden said, walking forward while Oliver kept backing up. “That it’s a good thing you
As they argued, throwing defenses back and forth at each other, neither of them said
Sherlock nodded, his mouth a thin line.
Sigar waved his hand. “Don’t worry about it. How’s everything fairing in London?”
A few hours later John heard the creak of Sherlock’s -
“I’m sorry about, you know, the way I left - or, well - how you had to fire me. I didn’t really mean to abandon my job like that,” John said, rather embarrassed.
“Oliver, this is my sister Harriet,”John introduced. Oliver stood up from the desk and shook her hand.
John hurried to the doorway. A broken glass scattered across the floor and Oliver’s shoulders looked tense, his hands over the sink.
John’s dreams that night twisted through his mind like spirals of shadows. He ran from a bullet and into a busy street full of cars, then stepped in a puddle and found himself sinking miles below water. Something warm pulled him out, then he was staring up at the roof of Bart’s, the sun nearly blinding him until a shadow jumped and plummet towards the ground.
A cab pulled up, and John gave him the name of the street Oliver was running down and told the cab driver it was an emergency. He tried calling Oliver again while in the cab, tapping his fingers anxiously against his leg. The cab pulled over and he threw some cash into the front seat before ducking out, trying to find Oliver on the GPS - there, a street over.
Before John knew how to respond, Sherlock’s eyes flicked behind him and John turned, a little (but not really) surprised to see Emily, standing there and fiddling with her jumper sleeves. He can still see blood stains on her nails.
A few minutes later, Sherlock came back to the flat and didn’t say anything. Oliver didn’t look up from his sketchbook. John met Sherlock’s eyes over the top of his book, as the man walked towards them and hesitantly sunk into his old arm chair, his hands in his lap and his eyes moving about the room. John continued reading his book.
“Why not? If you know the content, why sit through the classes?”
The boy’s face turned red, but he didn’t let it stop his rage. “This isn’t your decision!”
John shifted in his seat, feeling awkward. “Ah, I actually have something rather serious I need to tell you all about.”
“It’s fine, Mycroft,” John said.
“Do you know what this is about?” John asked, holding up the paper.
He nodded, his ears going red. “Year ten.” He pushed his mostly cleared plate to the side. “I’m finished.”
Sherlock stayed by the closed door, but John walked to the bed.
Sherlock stood there for a moment, quiet, his eyes flicking all over Oliver’s face, his jaw tight. Oliver practically mickied the position, his fists clenched. John felt out of place, but he couldn’t bring himself to leave the room, desperately wanting to know what they were saying and if he should stop them.
“Good afternoon, John,” Mycroft greeted.
Oliver nodded, playing with the hem of his tee shirt and looking embarrassed.
Oliver nodded, head tilted down, and walked to his room. John really hoped he didn’t end up vomiting, the strain on his stomach might be too much for his stitches.
“Great!” She says, uncrossing and crossing her legs. “Gen and I have been crazy busy because she has a huge family and all of them have been visiting, and we’re trying to book a venue early but money is pretty tight right now. So we don’t actually have a date yet, but I don’t really mind and neither does Gen.”
The next morning when John walked downstairs, Oliver was already awake and sitting on the couch, staring at nothing while he absently rubbed his thumb over the burns John knew were on the inside of his left elbow. John sat down next to him, and Oliver pulled his sleeve down, looking at his lap.
John’s shaking fingers found Mycroft’s contact in his phone, and he hit call while turning and searching for any signs of Oliver being near. Each ring that Mycroft didn’t pick up felt like a countdown to his speeding heart. Mycroft finally answered and John’s mouth moved before his brain could, trying to tell Mycroft exactly what happened and where he was.
“I’ll do that,” John said. “Thank you for working with us, I really hope Oliver proves this was a good idea.”
“Of course.”
school, though, since I got my classes changed and I like the astronomy club. I don’t want to go to a new school and have to readjust again.”
Molly sighed on the other end of the line. “I am. Really, don’t worry too much. I’ve been back in London for months now, and working is helping keep my mind off things.”
John smiled at him, just as his phone chimed. He picked it up and a message from Mycroft lit up the screen with a simple message:
“Are you all right, though?” John asked, his voice soft.
Violet dropped another plate into the sink and stood next to him drying the dishes. “John, I can’t thank you enough for taking care of Ollie.”
Here's the french translations:
Woot! Another fic finished :)
“Uncle!” Oliver called up the stairs.
Oliver slammed the front door shut and yanked his phone out of his pocket, dialing Caden. If he called Emily, she would tell him to go home, but he knew Caden would listen to him and he just needed someone to vent to. John was being unfair, Oliver couldn’t believe he sided with Sherlock.
Oliver stepped out of the pantry carrying a bundle of carrots and some peppers with Violet and their conversation faded.
He pulled his coat on and rushed from the flat in a flurry. John tapped his good leg up and down for a full minute, worrying his lip between his teeth before he caved. Oliver’s new phone had a GPS tracker on it, after he lost his last one in the dumpster he had been forced into. John specifically asked for one with the tracker, just in case. John pulled up Oliver’s phone location on his laptop and watched as the little blinking dot made it’s way through the streets to the little park, then stopped.
John asked, “You speak French?”
John sighed. God, he was going insane.
Towards nightfall, after John had taken Oliver to the shops to pick of meals for the week, Oliver stepped into the living room, bouncing on the balls of his feet and fidgeting with his curls.
John doubted he ever truly would.

John considered this, but he couldn’t remember if Emily and Oliver had gotten along at the New Years party. Oliver didn’t have any friends, other than the few “acquaintances” he called them, from his astronomy club, so maybe this would be a good chance for him to make a friend? It was worth a shot.
At the graveyard, John stayed in the car with his eyes closed. He didn’t want to be at the graveyard and he didn’t want to see Sherlock’s grave. Instead he leaned his head against the window and shut his eyes, willing this to be over quickly. Oliver hesitated, drumming his fingers on the door handle before eventually opening it and climbing out. John felt that maybe he should tell Oliver the gravestone was situated beneath a tree, towards the back, but his mouth wouldn’t open, and the boy already left.
“Oliver?” John frowned.
FOR COMMENTING ON ALMOST EVERY SINGLE CHAPTER SINCE THE BEGINNING. I do read
Oliver pulled the milk out of the fridge and drank straight from it because John wasn’t here to scold him for it, then stood at the counter and made a sandwich. He couldn’t remember the last time he ate. Maybe yesterday morning? Did he eat breakfast yesterday?
“You have to let me help you when this happens,” John said. He gestured to Oliver, “I’m not going to force you to take meds, but you have to tell me when you have an attack, and if they only get increasingly worse, we might have to find another solution than quitting altogether.”
John chewed the inside of his cheek. “All right. You have to wear a coat though and make sure your phone is on.”
A week later Oliver came home from school in an excited rush and with a big smile.
Oliver nodded, his face a bit red, and stood up.
John confirmed it and said goodbye just as Oliver’s door opened. John leaned through the living room doorway to see the boy stumble out of his room, eyes lidded and skin pale. Oliver paused in the hallway and put his hand on the wall, yawning and rubbing his eyes.
----------X----------
John audibly sighed. He couldn’t push a subject like this, if Oliver wanted to talk about it, he would. John wondered why Oliver prefered to deal with it on his own. Mr and Mrs Holmes were too kind hearted to force him to deal with it on his own. Does that mean he hid the attacks from them? Why?
“But, Oliver,” John said, “Because of this, there are people out there who know - well, they know you’re Sherlock’s biological son. That information wasn’t out there before, and it puts you in danger.”
The ringer buzzed and Oliver sighed, closed his notebook and went down to let Emily in. John stayed out of the way, while they went about what they usually did. John planned on writing about the failure of a day he had, and the odd feeling he had in his stomach the whole time. Maybe getting it out could help him sort through his conflicting emotions. He brought his laptop to the desk in the living room, rolling his eyes when the teenagers already started snapping at each other.
“Don’t worry,” Oliver said, then immediately slid off the back and landed on his rear on the sofa. Mrs Hudson snorted a laugh and John shook his head. Oliver looked up with a grin, and honest to God laughed for the first time John had ever heard. He sounded so much younger when he laughed, and John wished he would do it all the time. It rang out like a child’s, the expression of joy spreading to Mrs Hudson and John until all of them were laughing along.
“All right?” Oliver asked, shifting from foot to foot.
“No, no, I would never make him leave.”
“You can’t make him talk.”
“Thank you,” he said, looking at it with bright eyes.
Oliver scoffed. “
Oliver sighed, rubbing his hand through his hair.
John didn’t really expect much, anyways.
“How old are you anyways?” she asked him and he sighed, not intending on holding up a conversation. “You’re small. You look like a skeleton.”
The doorbell rang and John looked up from his laptop and to Sherlock, who still seemed oblivious to the world. John hurried downstairs in time to see Oliver shove the door open. John stepped off the stairs and Oliver bolted forward, pushing John back with the force of his hug. John let out a breath of relief and wrapped his arms around the child, looking up at Mycroft.
Oliver nodded, “I - kind of have an idea… but… I don’t know.”
“Are you all right?” asked Oliver’s soft voice. His pale hand held door handle.
“It was just an accident,” Oliver’s doctor was saying. It was the same woman as last time. “He must have just twisted the wrong way in his sleep, or moved too fast and pulled both sets of stitches, on his liver and on the outside. That’s what caused the internal bleeding. Luckily, he woke up and realized something was wrong, it could have been much worse.”
John looked at Sherlock again, who was now absently picking at a scratch on the table with the hand that was held by a splint. A part of John wanted to ask how it happened. But once again, nobody spoke.
“Does John know what you’re doing?”
John sat back down at the desk and ran and hand through his hair, feeling tired.
, I just like people who are kind and interesting. Does their sex have to be a part of that?”
Mycroft probably already knew what happened, he was practically omniscient. John leaned back against the counter and shut his eyes. He’d have to call Violet and Sigar, who would lose their minds. John would probably leave out some details that they really didn’t need to know. He opened his eyes and looked at Sherlock, who had strode over to the mantel in the sitting room and was looking at the pictures pinned above it near the mirror.
“Well, he raised his marks to the standard, so I’ve got a new schedule sorted for him. He’ll be able to do his classwork ahead of the others at his own pace if he keeps marks
Then he realized it was a microphone tap.
“How did you know to set it all up before hand?” John asked.
“I know,” John whispered.
They went over a few details, and John wished her well before they said goodbye. He ended the call and walked through the kitchen towards Oliver’s room, then knocked on the door.

Oliver didn’t come out of his room for over an hour, and when he did he slouched on the sofa, the notebook from a few days ago on his lap. He sniffed and tapped his pencil against the cover a few times. His headphones were around his neck, so John took that as a sign that Oliver would listen if he spoke.
Oliver bit his lip, and wanting with his whole being to trust Caden. He always had.
Oliver stayed crouched on the floor, his ears turning red. He turned away and mumbled something, his arms wrapped around his legs again.
John chuckled at that, imagining little Oliver chasing his poor grandmother with a beetle or worm. The image was heartwarming.
A tiny piece of John begged him to run after Sherlock, to go with him on the case, to forget the the past two years had happened and pretend for a few hours that everything was alright. Then he heard Oliver’s distinct laugh, and John remembered why he would never do that. Instead, he wrote for a while on his laptop, finished reading his book and cleaned up a bit to keep busy.
“Yes, actually,” started John. “I’ve had a talk with him about it, and I hoped we’d be able to work something out…”
He decided he didn’t like her.
“Who are almost adults, and almost murdered someone,” Mycroft pointed out.
Oliver sighed through his nose and tilted his head with his eyes closed. Then he stood abruptly and paced away, his arms crossed over his chest. He paused, facing the back wall of the flat and John waited while Oliver ran his fingers through his curly hair, then hung his head and covered his face with his hands. He heaved a half-gasp, half sob and John shuffled over to him. Oliver’s breath came out in short gasps and his arm shot out to the side, searching for something to grab onto as he fell.
“You know what this is,” John said.
“It could be fun!” Caden said, swinging Oliver in front of him and taking both his hands. “We can go anywhere we want - or take over the world together!”
John smiled, “Sure, let’s go. Grab a warmer coat though, it looks like it might snow again.”
“Ah, here,” John took a box from the stack and led the man, Mycroft and Oliver up to the flat. He set the box down on the floor, and the man did the same then disappeared down the stairs.
“Um,” Oliver said, shifting from foot to foot. “I could… If the teachers gave me the content ahead of time I would get it done. The classes are paced too slow. If I got it done at my own speed, then I could finish the class early and work on other stuff.”
John pulled his arm away and covered his face with his hands, elbows on the table. There weren’t enough words to express what he felt. The emotions didn’t have names, too fleeting to identify and too raw to grab onto. Of course he missed Sherlock too,
Oliver didn’t have time for John to just stand there, he’d already been under way too long. John dove into the icy water, gasping at the shock, and swam towards where he thought Oliver might be. He ducked under, the water too dark for him to open his eyes and search, so he reached around blindly, hoping to find
John and Sherlock got up and followed her through the halls. Oliver had his own room again, probably because the staff knew from last time. The doctor opened the door, and they stepped through.
Time flew by, now that John had something to do during the day. The first week passed smoothly and John slept full nights (with only a few nightmares) again since work tended to tire him out. Mornings were a little chaotic since they both had to be ready and out of the flat at the same time, but it was the familiar chaos John felt used to. Familiarity was good. Safe, even. Boredom - not so much.
“Yes.”
“I still don’t like him,” Oliver said.
“Don’t say stupid things, of course I want you here,” John said, looking away from Sherlock, who looked a little embarrassed. “We’ll figure it out.”
A large wooden beam had broken off the ceiling and fallen to the floor, leading up to the second floor. Oliver put his foot on it, testing the balance, then put his arms out and rushed up it. A section of the building they hadn’t been able to get to before was open now, the walls bare of graffiti. Not much besides a file cabinet laying on its side and broken lumber lay up there, so he walked back down.
John answered, “Couldn’t imagine where he gets that from for the life of me.”
She waved him away. “Make sure you get Ollie home soon, he’s only going to get worked up the longer you keep him waiting.”
And John already decided to do just that.
John smiled.
“No, it’s just…” Oliver fidgeted with the hems of his sleeves and looked away. John knew the sign that he had something on his mind.
“Are you in school, Oliver?” asked Mrs Hudson when Oliver had drifted away again. John touched his arm to get his attention.
----------------------------
Sherlock nodded. “She was one of the only people who knew. I needed help in the morgue and I trusted her.
“Oliver,” John pleaded, taking his casted hand. Oliver sighed through his nose, turning away and pulling his hand form John’s.
Mrs Hudson then offered him a hand, “Are you all right, Ollie?”
A conflicting range of emotions passed over Oliver’s face, ending with defeat as he slumped in his chair. “Fiiiiine,” he groaned.
Their ‘date’ ended quickly after that. Apparently, Anna didn’t like the idea of John having a kid. John didn’t know why, but he also really didn’t care. He regretted even accepting the invitation to go out, and had no idea why he decided to. He’s glad it’s over, regardless. Everything about going out with her felt wrong, like he shouldn’t be doing it. Something in his stomach told him not to, and he just left confused and with a headache.
Ella smiled. “Good. This is a step in the right direction John, I’m glad you’re making the effort.”
“Not really.”
Then Oliver walked forwards, and for a second John worried he
Oliver looked up, eyebrows raised. “Really?”
He stepped outside and slammed the door behind himself, letting out a huge breath. Sherlock didn’t know. What was he even talking about? It was so vague, Sherlock could have meant anything else. He didn’t know, there’s no way - Oliver’s fine. He shook himself, then left to meet Caden at the park.
Mycroft knocked on the door at exactly noon, as John expected. He took a moment to count to ten and breathe, bracing himself for the likely resemblance the boy would have to Sherlock, before opening the door. He knew it would be difficult and tried to prepare for that.
“And none of this is your fault.”
conversation, as Oliver didn’t offer a response to anything else. He just kept his head turned, looking in the vague direction of the windows to avoid looking at Mycroft or John.
All the air left his lungs, because he hadn’t prepared
“No, no. Nothing like that. I’ve been back on my feet lately and realized how much of a cock I acted like for never answering your calls,” John said. “And with the holidays coming up, I thought better now than later.”
It worked out perfectly, and John wouldn’t have to be alone for long in the flat anymore. Of course, Thursdays and Fridays Oliver would be by himself for a while after school, but John didn’t think it would bother the boy and John could ask Mrs Hudson to check on him if he felt too worried.

“No! It’s not-!” Oliver cut off and sat heavily on the couch, picking up a pillow and shoving his face into it. John moved to sit down next to him, feeling bad about almost laughing. He put his hand on Oliver’s back, which seemed to help, and Oliver sighed, then pulled his face away from the pillow.
