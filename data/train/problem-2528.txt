Castiel turned to see where Dean was pointing, slightly surprised to see Jo Harvelle sitting at a semi hidden table in the coffee shop, wearing plain clothes. She waved to him with a little grin, and he smiled before turning his attention back to Dean, ready to listen to the rest of his briefing.
“Just what, Dean? Cause seriously, the guy’s putting himself through the wringer to try and figure out what he did wrong. And what, it’s just one of your bitch fits?”
“Uh oh.” Charlie sat up straight and fixed him with a look. “I heard a pause there. What’s going on? Do I have to threaten someone? Cause I will.”
“You respond well to both touch and praise, I have noticed.” Castiel commented and smiled at Dean’s flush. “It’s nothing to be embarrassed about. I feel it’s important to use that to help you.”
His fingers worked their way up Cas’ sides, brushing over the sensitive skin on their way up. He brushed the pads of his fingers over the angel’s nipples, grinning into his mouth as he pulled a groan in response.
“Just think about it.” Gabriel patted his knee and, with a wry smile, turned back to the laptop screen.
”Oh, nothing yet, Castiel. But I assure you, I have big plans. Now why don’t you relax? We’ve got a ways to go yet.”
First came the crushing despair at the idea that maybe Dean thought less of him. Then came anger. No, Dean wasn’t about to get away with yelling and slamming doors that easily. His eyes narrowed as he pushed himself up, following the man.
“Castiel, this is ridiculous. You have known the rules for years, now stop procrastinating and let’s go.” Michael was showing signs of anger now and had made a grab for the will. Gabriel snagged it away before he could get it.
As Dean laughed, Castiel grabbed an orange from the fruit bowl and threw it, catching the man on the arm as he retreated to the bedroom. Another laugh sounded, and Castiel grumbled about ridiculous accusations - all the while with a smile on his face.
That ended up seeing him work four hours overtime when he should have been eating, relaxing, and heading to bed. He released a long sigh and was about to open his eyes and retrieve his keys, when he felt a rough shove on his shoulder. Confused, he lifted his head to find the source - and was met with his own keys jangling annoyingly in his face.
“You keep it within easy reach?” Cas asked, opening the bottle and spreading the slick over his fingers.
His fears were confirmed when he spotted something small and rectangle near a pillar in the parking lot. He prayed as he walked closer, begging it not to be what he thought it was. But when he picked it up, his fears were confirmed.
Castiel was on him in an instant, kissing the words from his lips and effectively cutting him off. He felt the smile against his lips before Dean was kissing back, their lips moving seamlessly until they were both breathless.
Dean frowned slightly, feeling uncertain. It was an odd request, and he had pictured Castiel as the type of person who wouldn’t want to see people outside of work. Regardless the man had asked, so he had to take it at face value, and there were now two options.
“Samsquatch!” Gabriel crowed, throwing his arms around the taller man with glee. “Oh, what a pleasure to see you!”
With that, Dean turned and stormed back into the house, leaving the woman and her kid in stunned silence. He noticed Castiel and Gabriel standing on the porch, watching him with shocked expressions – but he didn’t pause, too angry to talk about it straight away.
Castiel’s gaze softened  in response to his words, and Dean couldn’t help it. He leaned forward slightly, his eyes flicking between Castiel’s, seeking out any sign of doubt. But he found no doubt in Castiel’s eyes, only kindness, and so he carefully pressed closer, shivering slightly as he felt Castiel’s breath on his lips.
Eventually he pulled away for air, only to be quickly pulled up against Dean’s body, a mouth pressing insistently against his own. He groaned softly as Dean’s tongue flicked into his mouth, tasting his own essence there. Shocks went through him as Dean moaned into his mouth, the kisses becoming feverish.
“Well…” Sam sighed, and Dean knew he was right. “You and Castiel might have to go and be questioned.”
“Where-wait. Nope. I don’t want to know.” Dean answered, shaking his head. He couldn’t help a slight grin, though.
“Oh, of course. Sam, could you just give me one moment?” Castiel asked, grumbling as Dean’s arms circled his waist.
“Hurry up and fuck me you asshole,” Dean gritted out, hips pressing down to stretch his hole on Castiel’s cock as the hesitation continued.
They both fell silent, listening carefully in the quiet. There was no sound of Castiel moving around in the apartment - besides, Dean was sure he would have announced himself. He glanced at Sam momentarily, then they stood as one. Dean felt a shock of fear shoot through him, considering recent events.
“Dean.” The command in Castiel’s voice forced Dean to look up and meet his eyes. There was something there, but it wasn’t pity. “I will not ask you again;
“Dean, I want you to do one more thing for me.” Castiel told him after a pause, then hesitated. “…While you drive to work, I want you to think of a safe word.”
The grin fell off his face as he talked, leaving him staring at the other two with with a mixture of sadness and hope. Castiel, for his part, thought deeply about the comment. He decided quickly that he planned to do everything within his power to ensure that didn’t happen, this time.
Dean had nothing to say to that, shocked into silence. If what Castiel was saying was true, that meant that upper management had stepped in and threatened his job. Dean frowned as he wondered – then he remembered the last time that he had tried to talk to Castiel and been interrupted.
Dean grabbed at the angel’s hands, stopping him. The angel glanced at him with shielded, concerned eyes.
Dean coughed, the flush spreading to his neck as he read a different implication in Cas’ statement. It was all he could do to nod silently, trying to hide his erection as he moved toward Cas. He had no such luck, of course, though he pretended to imagine the way the angel’s eyes flicked to his crotch before passing the cue over.
“Shit...Agh..” Castiel gasped out, his head hitting the wall again as he bucked hard against the man, so hard in his pants that it was almost painful. In that second he knew he had lost any semblance of control in the silent battle for domination.
It seemed to last forever, both suspended in pleasure. Then suddenly it ended and they both went limp, shaking in each other’s arms as Dean collapsed on his chest.
“Yeah, yeah, we can’t do this. But we just did. Now sign, and you can be on your merry way.” Gabriel handed over a pen, which Michael took with a murderous glare.
At first, there was confusion in the green eyes that stared at him. Then Castiel saw the moment realisation set in and, without a word, Dean turned away and stalked off to the bathroom, slamming the door behind him. Castiel flushed, whether with embarrassment or anger, or both, he wasn’t certain. But he couldn’t bring himself to feel the rage he had before - his mind was somewhat settled now, and that thought unnerved him as he redressed and exited the apartment quietly.
“Then tell me what the hell you were doing hammering on my door at-“ Dean glanced at the clock quickly. “Seven Am?! Are you freakin kidding right now?”
Dean started to stand, but was shocked when a hand on his shoulder pushed him down. Jody had reached across to stop him standing, and she currently had confusion and anger written on her face.
While he waited, he moved around the kitchen, pulling ingredients from the fridge. He figured since he was up anyway, he might as well make some food for Sam and, later on, for Dean. The process was calming, and he found time passing easily. He hoped he was making the right choice, bringing Sam here. While he was pretty certain, his anxiety left doubts about Dean’s feelings on the matter. Perhaps he should have asked the man if it was alright first?
Dean’s back arched forward in an almost impossible move, thrusting his hips forward to bury his cock into Castiel’s throat violently.
“What kind of a ridiculous question is that?” Castiel grumbled as he stood in front of the mirror, staring at the image of himself that he almost didn’t recognise. He tugged at the tie around his throat, wishing it was looser. “Of course I’m nervous. What if this isn’t... What if it’s too soon?”
Dean smiled slightly and nodded, lifting his leg to show her as he grabbed a brownie from the plate. He’d finally been allowed to have the cast removed the week before and was now wearing a CAM boot. He’d gotten rid of the crutches as soon as he was free of the cast, and he loved that he could finally walk again – and drive.
On the other hand, he could say yes, meet Castiel for breakfast. It would probably result in questions he didn’t want to answer, and Cas would see him outside of work. He would just be himself, as a person, and that was more than likely going to scare Castiel away. Shit, he’d thought enough times that the man would run if he knew what was good for him, so maybe this would finally be the thing that made that a reality.
Dean just nodded, not trusting himself to speak. Sam was perceptive - he knew something was going on. But there was no way he could pick up on exactly what had just occurred, Dean was certain. He would have pulled a massive bitch face if he knew and been lecturing him on the ‘undecency of it all’.
“I don’t have time for this ridiculousness.” Michael growled, still struggling against Benny. “Regardless of what that will says Castiel is still under my authority.”
And then, Dean surprises him with a soft smile. “You know, I was the one who finally convinced her to go out with him.”
Castiel scrunches up his nose at that, not entirely sure what Dean means by it—but he makes a mental note to have maintenance check up on the hot water heater … that is, if he ever manages to get out of here.
“Dean” Mary warns a moment later, and Dean stops his assault on his baby brother and finally sits back down with a huff.
“You’re such a liar!” she coos. “Oh my God … okay, so he’s hot? Like, what kind of hot? Like the, ‘I want him to lick me and spank me’ kind of hot, or more the ‘I can see us opening a bed n’ breakfast on the Oregon coast someday’ kind of hot?”
“I promise you, Dean. I will never leave you again.” And for the first time, Castiel knows he can keep that promise. As long as Dean exists, he will exist for him.
Castiel swallows hard, feeling nervous on her behalf. He knows how much she hates being the center of attention, almost as much as he does—so the fact that she’s standing up at all right now, none the less, willing to speak in front of so many people, has him feeling like he might pass out.
intimidating, but I know it’s the right move for me. I—I think I just need to get used to it. I don’t do too well with change.”
Castiel nods, but doesn’t say anything more. He just continues to breathe, warm and deep against Dean’s chest.
“What’s wrong?” he asks, feeling his stomach drop as all the worst-case scenarios begin to race through his mind.
“Young and dumb, and in love with me” Castiel counters happily. “I loved it. I think I’ll ask Sam to frame it for us once this is over.”
Dean’s not sure, but he imagines he’s probably white as a ghost, or green—although he’s shaking too hard to tell if he’s going to puke.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake!” Dean booms, flipping through a few more pages, to see if there were any other food items hiding between them. For the most part, there were only smudges at the corners of each recipe, and a few tears in the center of the papers, but nothing awful—until he reached page thirteen, which had almost been completely burned out of the book. There are just a few charred shreds left holding it to the woven signature.
The man will lean away at first, but Cathy will be too persuasive, and soon—Cas will have is hands around her waist, and she will be dipping in. Her soft skin and long silky hair will be too much to resist, and Cas will kiss her—and then, everything that he has with Dean will be over.
“He walked in the door, looking like the sky was filled with rainbows and puffy clouds that rained beer and pizza—I had never seen him so happy.”
Castiel nods—but soon, his eyes round out, and then he’s leaning forward and looking Dean dead in the face. “Do you know what we need to do, Dean?”
He has never felt as if he were one with another; as if his atoms shifted into Dean's atoms, causing little explosions that lit up their souls to scorch them from the inside out.
Castiel laughs as well, eventually leaning against the wall by the end of the bed, happy that things feel just a little less tense now. “True. I never could get your eyes right.”
“He was a regular poet” Castiel laughs, suddenly missing his best friend so much, he fears might start welling up.
to have an estimate” Castiel grumbles, squinting his eyes at Dean. “Fifty dollars? A hundred? Two hundred?”
“The big deal is that this is our livelihood; and I gave you this job so you could gain work and life experience, but not at my expense. Take this job seriously, or you can earn your extra money by cooking burgers at McDonalds.”
down. I considered telling Cathy when I got back inside, but she looked so happy with all her friends around her, and it
Maybe if he hadn’t, the man would still be here in his arms, and not on his way to the arms of another.
The truth is, he doesn’t mind having this little bit of excitement in his life. There’s some mystery that comes with all this—there’s question and curiosity.
Dean nods to himself, wondering why it’s taking the guy so long just to change, but then again—it’s not like the angel has much practice changing clothes.
you want to tuck your chin down and lift your arms up—with your hands open and out, about six to eight inches in front of your face.” Castiel shows Dean the stance and even though it seems like it would look a little silly, it actually makes the man appear very intense, and it puts Dean on edge.
“Uh huh—well, it ain’t funny!” Dean hisses, still happy that he can put Sammy in his place when he needs to. He heads back into his room to grab his toiletry bag, making sure he has his deodorant and toothbrush as he walks once more into the living room.
It's sudden and harsh, and if he hadn't been so swamped with memories lately, he probably would've been able to hold it together, but his eyes immediately burn with her words, and Dean has to blink a few times and look away to stop it, hoping that the old woman doesn’t notice his change of face. “Yeah, yeah—can’t argue there” he mumbles pathetically.
, I could tell.” Castiel huffs, and then he finally looks back at Dean before rolling to his side so he can pull himself to his feet. Dean tries to help, but Castiel gently shrugs him away. “I know that you don't want to be here, Dean ... that much is apparent. You didn't have to come along. You could have told me no, and I would've understood. I of course, would like to be friends with you, but I am certainly not going to force a friendship with someone who doesn’t want to be around me.”
Cas appreciated the effort, and as the second movie began, he settled back into Dean more comfortably. Sam had long given up on his confused looks, settling into a comfortable silence between the four of them.
Before he had time to react, Cas had picked up the gun he had dropped, and shot him square in the chest. With his own damn gun. Just as quickly, the angel bolted, leaving Dean standing against the tree with a green splatter of paint across his chest.
Castiel smiled slightly then, an odd reaction, and nodded. Dean understood it for what it was – appreciation that he had told the truth, despite that they would not be able to discuss it. The first group entered the room, calling out ‘Good morning’s to Castiel. Castiel greeted them each in turn and, as the room filled, began the day.
He sucked in a breath and turned back to look at Castiel. The man was staring over the burns that made their way as lines up Dean’s arm, all of them at varying stages of healing. Castiel’s fingers came up to trace over the lines gently, even the most recent ones from a few days ago. Dean sucked in a breath of pain when he hit those ones. Castiel continued to inspect the skin, turning Dean's arm slightly to see the scars that were healed and older as well as the fresh ones.
“Uh, Dean-o - were we planning on getting there alive?” Gabriel called from the back seat of the impala, his knuckles white on the edge of the seat.
“Why thank you, hand maiden.” Charlie laughed as she took the beer from him. “You know, you haven’t come to Moondoor for awhile now. You should come.”
“You really wonder why? Listen I get that you’ve been dealt a rough hand... but there’s only so many times you could take it out on Sam. He’s goin through shit too, you know.”
“Cas!” Dean screamed as his orgasm pulled him under, eyes rolling back in his head as he came between them.
But he couldn’t ignore the way Castiel’s eyes darkened slightly, nor the way his lips parted in barely hidden surprise. He couldn’t deny that Castiel took a moment to compose himself, looking away from Dean as he wet his lips. The only explanation for his reaction was that he had felt the same thrill Dean did as he had said it, and was trying to ignore it.
“Thank you, Dean.. Thank you..” Castiel repeated in a whisper as his lips worshipped the man’s neck.
“So don’t discuss it, duh. Just, I dunno, pull him aside and ask if everything’s okay. See where it goes. What’s the worst that could happen?”
“I, uh… I saw Cas. Again.” Dean frowned. “He looked like he was gonna come over to my desk this time. But… Well, Jody stopped him.”
For all the rush, Castiel had expected something serious to go down. What he <em>didn’t</em> expect, however, was for Dean to stand rooted to the spot in shock, staring at the aging, grizzly officer on the other side of the door who was smiling oddly and staring at Dean with - were those tears in his eyes?
“Oh, we’ve got a fair idea.” Jo had sidled up beside benny, and she brushed her coat aside to reveal the hilt of her weapon. She shot him the sweetest, fakest smile she could muster. “And we’ve dealt with worse. Now we’re gonna have a nice little chat, okay?”
Charlie and Sam looked at each other with a slight frown, then turned to Dean. Dean glanced at the woman again, then nodded to them. She had a comforting presence, this stranger, so he didn’t feel in any danger.
He was cut off as he heard a loud banging on the front door. Fear shot through him as he realised it had gone quiet several minutes ago, and he assumed that John had got a second wind until he heard a commanding voice ring out.
“What do you mean he didn’t want to discuss it?” Sam asked, and he looked angry. “Dean, it takes two to tango. He’s also in a position of authority. He has a responsibility to discuss it with you and work things out.”
Dean grinned and, with a nervous chuckle, pressed the button for the ground floor. He couldn’t help smiling to himself as he caught the radiant expression on Castiel’s face. Maybe Castiel really was an okay guy, and his first impression was way off. He was starting to doubt his idea that the guy was an alcoholic, too. But the little incident that had played out had him worried, and he pondered on it as he left on his errands.
“But… Well, today he left first. It sounds stupid but…” Dean sighed and took a long drink, then continued. “We always chat, and I leave first. But today he… He knew I was lying when I said I was okay. And he asked me not to. Then I didn’t say anything, and he left first. I just, I feel like I screwed up, and I don’t know how to face him tomorrow. Today. Later. You know what I mean.”
“Get off me.” Castiel bit lowly, still simmering, but helpless to the desire that curled in him at the strength in the body pressing against him.
He cradled Dean’s face in his hands, pushing him back so that he could stare into red rimmed, wet green eyes. His thumbs gently moved over his cheeks, wiping away the tears that had been falling.
Castiel looked up from what he was doing, and Dean had to catch his breath. The way that Castiel had been sitting to take care of his hand meant than when he suddenly lifted his head, they were barely a breath apart. He couldn’t help staring into Castiel’s eyes, that deep blue somehow brighter right now than he’d ever seen it.
When Castiel finally looked up at Dean, his eyes were guarded. He looked over Dean silently, seeming to be making a decision, then finally nodded and gestured to another seat on the opposite side of his desk. Dean sighed softly but nodded as he took the seat, the desk a clear physical barrier between them.
After some time, Dean began to pick up on the pattern and form a strategy. As he approached, he watched Cas shift slightly to the left - in preparation for veering off, he realised. He grinned as he got closer and reached out, preparing to tag the angel...
Okay, so it's been a long week - as you can see by the title of the chapter that I couldn't even think of.
Dean woke slowly to the tune of Israel Kamakawiwoʻole singing ‘Over the rainbow’ in soft, quiet tunes. The song was one he knew from long ago, though had not heard in some time. It was comforting and brought a faint smile to his lips, which widened as he heard Castiel softly humming along to the song. Of course his professor would listen to this music regularly – he was, after all, a bit of a dork.
At the same moment that Uriel stepped forward and grabbed Dean’s shirt, Castiel screamed his name, trying to pull him back. He didn’t notice Dean’s other hand, which had snatched a box cutter from his belt. Dean’s hand swung up and swiped across Uriel’s arm, and several things happened at once.
“Of course. You just need to show me what to do.” Castiel had never used a sander, but he knew how to drill, and he figured he could learn on the job.
He glanced over his schedule - then he smiled crookedly as an idea came to mind. He made a few adjustments to the list then nodded to himself. Hopefully, his plan would work. With a hopeful outlook, Castiel rinsed his cup, and set to his first task of cleaning the apartment.
Castiel didn’t mind. After Dean had shown him how to apply paint to the roller, make sure it wasn’t overloaded, then spread it evenly, he found he quite enjoyed the activity. He left the edges for the more experienced man, but overall they were making good progress.
Charlie had seen his episodes more times than he could count, and as much as he didn’t like how much she knew about it, it had started their friendship. He could at least be grateful for that, even if he didn’t like being weak around anyone. It helped, in that she would often cover for him when he had an episode.
“Sammy, just drop it, okay?” Dean grabbed his plate, loaded the eggs onto toast and took it to the table, not looking up the whole time. “Please.”
“No, Dean. I have not won.” Castiel answered in his ear, easing the pressure of his gun away from Dean’s back. “Not yet.”
Dean thought he heard a thoughtful humm from Castiel – but he couldn’t be sure, and he didn’t question it. Aside from that, there were no further words. Glancing up, he realised Castiel was still waiting patiently for him to answer the question. He frowned slightly, trying to sort out the thoughts in his head and his current feelings so that he could voice them, without sounding completely insane.
“I was... Sam and I, we were both firefighters. I was good, Cas, I swear. I was trained, we’d both been in it for years and we were experienced... Five years ago, though, we turned up to a house...”
He really hadn’t driven all that far. He’d gotten about twenty minutes away before he’d needed to pull over, and found the well placed parking lot. He imagined it was busy during the day, but right now it was empty, and he was enjoying the quiet as he stared out over the city. He wondered how many people were out clubbing with friends, having fun, being human. Not him, though.
They were sitting around a table now, nursing their drinks in relative quiet. Dean glanced across the table at Castiel, who was studying his whiskey and coke with intense interest. He’d shed his trench coat for the occasion, and was wearing a sleek, dark blue button up, sleeves carefully folded up to his elbows. The top two buttons were undone, and Dean grinned as he remembered teaching him that particular ‘fashion’.
Dean was moaning, his head dropping to Castiel’s shoulder as he bucked into the grip. Castiel reached down to join Dean’s hand, the feeling of their cocks sliding together in their joined hands sending delicious waves of pleasure through him. Dean cursed as Castiel’s free hand gripped onto his hip, digging his nails in harshly. Judging by the way Dean suddenly pressed into him with a moan, he enjoyed the sting mixed with the pleasure.
Much love to every one of you, and if you want to follow for updates, catch me on facebook! My profile is public, under Jas Ikeda. I post chapters and reccomendations too.
He really should do something, say something to stop this before it went too far. They were in public, and this was Cas, and surely the angel was just reacting to adrenaline, so they definately needed to-
“I mean …” the man continues, taking one, short gliding step into Castiel’s space, causing their bodies to graze, “not every hotel provides its guests with their very own closeted gay man.”
. People, they’re not as easy to read, as easy to fix—as easy to pile off to the side when he wants to be left alone, which seems like more and more these days.
—not that Dean cares about the gender of who cuts his hair, but this girl looks like she drinks a gallon of espresso
Castiel gives him a half-smile but he’s looking down at his hands. “Yes, but sometimes we need those days where we can just quietly reflect.”
A squirrel catches his eye, running in the distance across the lawn. It bobs between granite slabs and small statues of angels. Other tombstones sprout all around him, reminders that so many came before this time, and so many more will fill in the still-blank spots of green. Dean sighs—hoping that everyone here got to live a full life.
Dean laughs and then reaches out and pats the young man on the shoulder, making him flinch hard. “You’re a good kid, Petey. I like you! You’re a go-getter.”
He wants to go back to the other night when they were both in this bed, holding onto to each other—naked skin pressed upon naked skin. Promises and compliments filling the sheets and fluffing the pillows. Dean should have never let Cas go that night.
Castiel smirks as he rolls his eyes, and Dean snickers back—and then they’re both silent for some time, but it’s comfortable, and Cas is grateful for it. “Sorry,” he finally breaks in, causing Dean’s ears to perk up, “I interrupted your story.”
Dean admired Cas a lot for that—switching careers, going after what he was really interested in, and just
it is” Dean grunts, feeling his dick begin to swell beneath the drape—but then he realizes, Castiel was asking about the
The moon shined brightly over the grassy fields, making everything tinge blue and gold. It felt like a dream, which reminded Dean of the one he had the night before. At the time, it was scary, but thinking back on it now, he almost misses it. He wishes he hadn’t woken up when he did. The storm, the strange thing that was controlling it—the way that thing spoke,
A part of Dean wants to move away, but the rest of him doesn’t want to move at all—finding the closeness welcoming and familiar. “What am I?” he finally manages to ask, feeling his throat close around the words.
humiliating. Their mother tried to comfort him, waiting for the seatbelt sign to turn off so she could get him to the bathroom to change. Eight year old Sam however, thought the whole damn thing was hilarious and couldn’t stop cracking up, no matter how angry Mary got at him.
“82 East Norfolk! Please, just get someone out here!” Dean listens to the deathly silence, his rushing heart being the only sound to match it.
Castiel feels his heart sink to his feet. He had finally worked up the courage to confront the man, but it seems like fate had another idea.
With a disgruntled sigh, the girl hoists herself from her seat. “Fine—have it your way, man. I’m just gonna go back to the front desk and wait for your ‘one-that-got-away’ to check out and get away all over again; but come Monday when you realize you missed your chance, I hope you can live with it.”
…" Dean mutters with smile, turning onto a dusty, pot holed driveway with a sign that says "Food" dangling haphazardly above it.
Dean rolls his eyes and shrugs his brother’s hand off of him, trying to play down the affectionate moment; but Sammy is apparently having none of it. Soon, Dean is being wrapped up in those lanky arms, getting squeezed just a little too tight, until it’s hard for him to breathe.
to what was being said, and if he had … maybe he could’ve contributed something to keep Castiel from nearly killing himself just now. “Sorry, man—I
Dean feels that hole tear through him once again—a wound that only a broken promise can make. “Don’t do this, Cas” he pleads, because he knows what those words truly mean … they mean
Becky’s head is still visible through the mirror, and Dean can still feel her eyes on him. He can still sense all her judgement mucking up the air; and it’s all that judgment that’s starting to make him sweat.
The expression on Castiel’s face turned from one of shock to one of confusion in the span of that phone call, and Dean stares as the man tilts his head to silently question Becky as to what it was about.
None of this is making Castiel feel any less like fleeing, and he pulls against Dean’s hold some more, knowing that if he really wants to, he could break free and run; but something in him waits, hoping that there’s more to be said about what has happened here.
kissed her, but then I stopped. I knew deep down that I didn’t want things to become that intimate.”
Castiel smiles, pulling Dean down with him to sit on the loveseat. “I own about thirty four acres of land beyond the edge of town. I put a large work-shed on it, as well as trailer. Every other weekend, I like to go out there and try out new hobbies. If I was cooped up in
“I wasn’t sure if that would work, but you were starting to succumb to the effects of our interaction. I could hear your heart falling out of rhythm. I knew another shock would maybe correct it, but I wasn’t sure … I thought that I had killed you when you didn’t respond.”
“Okay, okay— I’m sorry” Castiel chuckles, taking one step back before leaning up against the counter. “I just know you miss him. I miss him too.”
“Dean—only an amazing man could make someone as put together as our Mr. Novak, fall apart so completely. Only someone as wonderful as
After they picked up the trailer with the two bikes and hitched it to Castiel’s old brown truck—something that Dean was surprised to see the man driving, considering he’s rich off his ass, Castiel suggested that they grab something to eat before they got out to the field.
I know, I know ... this chapter took forever; but it's here now! And I really like it; so hopefully you do too.
” he grumbles miserably, wishing now more than ever that he never told Charlie about his guilty-pleasure collection of romance novels.
. Bobby fought countless legal battles, trying to gain custody of Dean. He wanted to adopt him and call him his own, but the state of Kansas just wouldn’t rule him to be a fit parent for a nine year old boy. Bobby Singer was already up there in age, and lived in a rundown shack that just happened to be surrounded by miles and miles of scrap metal. His income wasn’t steady, he wasn’t in a committed relationship, and it didn’t matter how much he loved the boy, the government just didn’t see that as enough. So Dean bounced between foster homes and schools—some okay, some downright terrifying, until he got old enough to start cheating the system. When he could, he’d run off and visit Bobby— but the cops would always find him and bring him back so that whatever foster parent he happened to be staying with at the time could keep depositing the support checks. When he turned sixteen however, Dean actually came back on his own … this time, in his dad’s old impala. Bobby had taken it after the fire. Apparently, it was always intended to go to Dean—John had told Bobby that years and years before; he wanted it to stay in the family. “That car is just as much a Winchester as any of us”, his old man used to say; so when Dean finally got his license, Bobby was finally able to give him John’s last gift; and his dad’s prized car meant
Castiel smiles, a soft, gentle smile. His face is sharp and angular, but still—just as kind as Dean thought it was. “Yes, maybe. However, I thought I was the only one like me, and I may still be the only one like me. Yet, you are somehow similar to me in that, you are everywhere all at once. You have some sort of connection with the earth; but what that connection is, I don’t know.”
a barber shop before. He obviously knows that they’re still a thing, but they seem like they’ve become more of a novelty—a place to go just for kicks, just so you can say you’ve done it. Other than that, he doesn’t really understand the appeal. As far as he knows—they’re overpriced and showy. He just needs a
The girl’s mouth falls open, as if Dean had just said he likes to beat puppies in his spare time. “What? No, no, no, no, no! You
” He can’t let himself become some sort of stalker. “I’m not going to interrupt his stay. If I run into him, then I run into him. We’ll let fate decide that one. Otherwise, we are going to leave him alone. Understood?”
Lawrence stretches out below their feet, lights looking like pinholes in a sheet, and they’re both hiding beneath it—tucked away in their own little moment.
The girl giggles but doesn’t seem too concerned with the result of her outburst, and she begins spinning in the swivel chair gleefully. “Sorry, but I figured out the three things!” she squeaks as she goes round and round, turning into a blur of red and joy.
” His cheeks tinge and then hollow, and after a second, he looks towards the dirt between his boots and kicks at it. “I have no idea what I’m doing—and it’s obvious.”
“Yes … and paying a fine. I was planning on returning another book tonight, but I can’t seem to find it. I must have left it out in the woods.”
For a second, he almost picks up the phone to call Charlie again, wanting to ask her if she recalls anyone by that name, but then he remembers how she said not to disturb her tonight, and he really doesn’t need that redhead all fired up and pissed off at him for ruining her magical third date.
. And I never have sex with women” Charlie deadpans—and it makes both her and Dean laugh a moment later.
Their guests cheer, and Sam claps and hoots. Claire laughs and Mary wipes happy tears from her eyes, and the rest of the hotel carries on just as it does every day, just as Jimmy always hoped it would. And if Castiel listens close enough—he can hear his best friend cheering along with everyone else that holds his happiness in their hands, and that is all it takes for his heart to finally feel perfectly whole.
It seems obvious now, and Dean feels like an idiot for not seeing it; but then again—he was solely focused on the vegetable Brad was holding.
Dean shakes the man’s hand vigorously before peeking over and smirking at Sam, letting his baby brother know that
, then giggles behind her blood red nails before tilting up on her toes to kiss the man.  He leans into it. “Anyhow, son. I understand if ya still wanna find yer cheap,
Dean’s vision whites out—and his thoughts blur to nothing but TV static and high-pitched ringing. Castiel’s hold on him is so tight, he feels like he’s on the edge already; but he can’t cum. He doesn’t know how, but somehow, Cas isn’t letting him. “What … what? H-how?” Dean rambles, grabbing at the sheets and tearing them from the mattress.
She hands the rainbow cased cell over to Charlie and then kisses her on the cheek, and Charlie gives her such big heart-eyes, Dean’s afraid they’ll pop out of her head. “OMG, babe! You’re the greatest! Dean, isn’t she the greatest?” she asks without looking at him, choosing instead to give Dorothy a rather long kiss on the lips.
on my mind. Someone who was most likely not interested in me at all, and who probably never wanted to see me walk into his library again, but I simply
Dean gawks, not sure how the hell this kid even got in here, so he checks out the resume in front of him once more. “
“Don’t be. Seriously, Cas … all Sam and I had planned today was to sit around and drink and get depressed. It’s nice to have someone come by and pick us up out of our stoopers.”
Dean instantly unfolds his arms and slides his chair away, feeling as if he could smack his little brother now. “What? No! For fuck’s sake, Sam! I can control my fucking bladder!”
Castiel nods. “Thank you, Kelsey. I will.” And then he speeds on through, quickly moving around the desk and down the short hallway to the staff door just outside suite three. He takes one short breath and then opens it up, startling Magda as she washes her hands at the back of the small room. Just like the interior hallways, all the suites and guest service-areas have attached staff rooms where materials and necessities can be kept. Each of the spa suites have a room filled with towels and candles and oils, as well as a small sink and prep station for the masseurs and other professionals to prep for their clients. Castiel figured that this would be the safest place for him to do—
After another minute, Charlie is back in his doorway, glaring at him hard – probably noticing that his gaze has drifted from the computer screen and he’s now staring at the corner of his office like Jesus himself has just appeared there. She clears her throat and Dean finally snaps out of it.
“Oh, no—you’re special” Dean mutters under his breath, taking this chance to stare at the man’s perky, tight ass. He licks his lips and bobs his head approvingly; finally feeling like his day is looking up … that is, until he catches Becky eyeing him with the most devilish smirk he’s ever seen.
It was supposed to sound comforting, Dean knows that, but he still can’t shake the feeling that if he signs that piece of paper, accepting everything that Bobby left for him, that means  he’s alright with the man being gone—and nothing could be further from the truth. “The only benefit I want from his life …” Dean growls, staring that suit square in the face, “is having his life
Dean takes a deep breath as he rolls his eyes up, wishing with everything he has that he’d known more. “I mean—I knew he was into some twisted shit. That’s why I ended things with him.”
Jack sits down too, and it finally pulls Dean’s focus. Jack smiles again. “Sam was right. I didn’t leave Castiel in the Empty.”
” he grits, feeling his body turn to stone as the top of Castiel’s head sails down one of the rows and back out into the main walkway. Soon, he’s striding up to the desk with a single book in his hand. He smiles softly at Charlie, and then the smile tightens some when his eyes move over to Dean, proving that
Dean exhales, face frozen—eyes locked on Castiel, seeming as if he’s waiting for it to all fall apart. “I—I don’t know if I can do this again, Cas.”
Dean’s humor quickly fades when he realizes that Sargent Hank isn't joking around; which is good for the
He closes his eyes. An arid heat begins to fill his nose. He opens again to see sand, whipping around him in a spiral, piling up over his head only to blind him once again.
. Like you said before, he may just end up killin’ someone because he doesn’t like how they look at ya. This is
Cas finally pulls himself back and thwacks Dean’s in the gut, and they both laugh some more as Castiel answers the call.
But then Sam said something during this last visit that changed everything within Dean’s perspective:
Dean huffs—offended and instantly defensive, and still very, very confused. “What? I’ve always known—”
“Claire …” he mumbles from his office, getting up quickly to head back out to the front desk so he can apologize. “Claire, I’m sorr—”
Something stabbed in Dean’s chest at that. “Why the hell would he bring him somewhere else? His home is
just a book; and I love them as much as you do, but this is taking that love to an extreme! And we both know, this isn’t even really about the books! It’s about you and this crazy crush of yours, but you’ve been so de-socialized, all locked up in this library twenty-four-seven, that you don’t know how to handle your feelings anymore!” Her face is getting as red as her hair and Dean knows, she’s truly concerned about his mental stability; and to be honest,
Dean sighs too. “And since Bobby is like a father to us, him dating someone makes that seem tainted somehow—like someone new is trying to wedge their way in and take him away.”
while death was literally breaking down the door at his back. Dean wanted to wipe away the image of the angel tilting his head to the side the way he always did when he was being sincere. He needed to push back the memory of those beautiful blue eyes filling with tears one last time. Dean needed to mute the sound of Castiel finally saying “I love you” because it’s been playing on repeat in his head for months.
, Claire” Magda smiles at the young woman sitting to Castiel’s left—and Claire chuckles some more as she nods enthusiastically. Magda laughs. “Well, it was already strange to see the boss down in the spa— since it’s one of the most

world, even if it’s just for moments at a time—the small chances he got in a day to crack open his cover and peer inside. It felt exciting, something to look forward to, something to ponder and feel differently about … that is what he was hoping for.
The young woman frowns a little and then shrugs before beaming yet again and trotting around the counter to settle behind the register. “Alright, well how can we help you? Oh, what am I saying! It looks like you need the works! So—a shave and cut, then?”
“Oh good! I’m really glad to hear that” and the warmth in his tone warms Dean to his toes, knowing that Castiel
“Oh … will you excuse me a moment?” he asks, but before Dean can answer, the shape he thought he saw in front of him, dissolves into a mist of color, flitting up through the air like cast off from a geyser.
“Claire! He is over twice your age! You shouldn’t be thinking about men like that … you shouldn’t be thinking about men at all!”
“Claire, would you excuse us please?” Castiel says finally, steeling himself as he stands up straighter to tower over the girl.
if only Castiel had ignored her; or at least, politely disregarded her. But instead, the guy seemed intrigued by this woman’s obvious mating dance, even flattered!
Dean is instantly laughing again, relieved that he’s not being accidentally offensive; so he goes and flops next to Castiel on the couch. “Yeah, well … that feeling won’t fade. Let me tell ya! I still can’t believe that this is my life sometimes. It’s been about two years and I still freak out every time I see my little brother’s face staring down at me from that billboard on Grand Ave.”
Two weeks came and went. The soccer fundraiser was a success by all intents and purposes, and the days that followed were actually pretty busy, considering Lawrence High School just implemented a more rigorous exit exam for its seniors. Dean had been so swamped with work that he had nearly forgotten about that damaged book, and the infamous
“Oh, he’s coming back! He’s coming back!” Charlie yips, whacking Dean in the arm over and over, until he’s pretty sure it’s forming a bruise.
, which means that in some way, he has followed along with Castiel’s life after they broke up. Dean Winchester, that green eyed sculpted man who could eat himself into a coma yet, still look like he stepped out of the pages of fitness magazine … that man who could get into a million fist fights while still wanting someone to stroke his hair as he fell asleep at night. That man who could be
“Oh, goodness. You really need to get out more, man. Seriously! When’s the last time you went somewhere other than
Dean sighs. Castiel just wants to make him feel good, and the fact that that might be faltering right now is concerning to him. And it’s this concern that finally silences all those worrying thoughts enough for Dean to remember that there is an unbelievably sexy man right in front of him, asking permission to touch his dick;
Sam watches as the two stare at one another; and even though—it’s even more sickeningly sweet than this diabetic-death-cake, he can’t say he minds it. He never thought he’d get to watch these two eye-fuck ever again; and he never thought he’d
how to care for others. Dean could keep this house to try and feel close to Bobby again, but for some reason, that gun overshadowed all four of those termite-eaten walls. Old books and warn leather arm chairs just seem useless now, and they could never match the feeling of that mother of pearl handle and short, stiff trigger gracing the skin of his hand.
” Dean asks, immediately feeling his cheeks heat up because he didn’t intend to say that thought out loud.
“There aren’t. It was nearly twenty years ago. He probably doesn’t even remember me” Castiel mutters, turning quickly to his computer screen and pretending to look busy.
With the last word, Dean smiles victoriously, and then that smile softens, realizing how easy this all feels. This is technically only their third date— but they’ve already settled into a comfort that he thought was reserved for old married couples. It feels effortless and calm, and the silence isn’t scary at all, it’s just a time to reflect on how good this all is.
Justin laughs, still seeming far too at ease—and far less threatened than he should be when sitting across from an angry-Dean Winchester.
He stands there a few minutes more, catching sight of Peter every now and then, dashing around like a mad man as he fills up a hand basket with everything that was on the list. It's actually pretty impressive; but then, just beyond the kid’s speedy blur, Dean notices something else—a very familiar silhouette. Angles and curves that have been etched into his mind like a carving in a tree.  “Cas?” he whispers to himself—disbelief and excitement swirling through his chest in a whirlwind, making his heartbeat erratic.
Dean smiles and nods at the woman, noting her kind brown eyes as they shine beneath the dangling mason jar lights above their heads. “Yeah—it’s great. Honestly, it feels more like
Dean steps into his view, looking him over—desperately trying to read the angel’s face. “I hope this is okay” he says after another moment. “I just want you to finally feel at home here. I mean, I know this has been your home for a while, but … you never really
Melinda’s eyes narrow on the book as she takes a step closer, but then stops—probably because the smell of that awful thing jogged her memory. “Oh,
But this time, it doesn’t actually startle him—and that stinging ache he’s expecting to feel, doesn’t come.
“Don’t even try, Charlie. I’m doing this! I’ll run home, get some shit to tide me over, and then I’m hunkering down
and it was driving me insane that I couldn't. I suppose that makes me sound silly to you” he had said at one point, but Dean instantly disagreed. “No, seriously, man—it doesn’t at all. I get it. I’m a worrier and a fixer too—I wouldn’t be able to sit there and listen to people spill about the
Castiel chuckles lowly. “Oh, no need to beg me, Dean …” he then bends close and licks the curve of Dean’s lip, “I’m
“I … uh … I” Dean stumbles over his thoughts. Words clash against the folds of his brain. Synapsis misfire, burning up syllables before turning them to dust. “I … um …”
We got one book back last week that looked like it was dropped in a river! Seriously, I found a slug in it!”
And Dean can barely breathe—feeling both dread and complete relief at the sight of his boyfriend’s face. “
, having a drink with a sexy guy, finding out they have more in common than he thought. “My sister always told me that I am an extremely clumsy individual.”
“I never do that” Dean grumbles, knowing that his pants may as well be on fire for as big of a lie as
Dean chuckles as he watches her disappear into the kitchen. He should’ve known better than to keep up his act in a place like

But Dean can’t really bother to care at this point. “His resume says he’s six-two and weighs two hundred twenty pounds … but you’re what? A buck n’ a half, give or take?” Dean clacks, glaring at Seth in a fury.
he was on the porch smoking a cigarette.” Castiel takes a deep breath as he cleanches his eyes tighter. “He pinned me against the door of my car, and he was wrenching my arm behind my back as he tried to undo my slacks. I managed to break free and knock him down; and thankfully, he was so inebriated—he just
Something about the tone in the woman’s voice breaks Dean’s heart. “If that’s the case … then what would you be doing if you didn’t have to be here?”
, can you show me how to do this again?” Claire calls out, obviously aware that Cas is lurking and listening nearby; but he can’t bring himself to answer her, none the less,
Dean licks his lips; now standing closer to Castiel’s face than he ever has before—and it’s making every one of his nerves sing. “Well … you’re off to a good start.”
“Well, as difficult as that must’ve been for you, I’m glad that your uncle was there to support you any way he could.”
Dean feels the blood rush from his face—and his mouth goes completely dry as he finishes reading the white-chalked words.
They’re sitting in Dean’s backyard, watching two birds hop along the fence line. Sam is inside, trying to solve some major issue that came up with a group project he’s doing for his environmental justice class.
Castiel’s heart beats heavy in his chest, but for the first time all weekend, it’s beating with conviction. “I want to make it up to you—to try again.”
But Castiel just smiles and shakes his head—and once again, Dean thinks that he can really see his face, and from where he's standing, Castiel looks
Dean went back to nodding, fading in and out of his haze of anxiety and nerves, wishing more than anything he was back at the library, nestled comfortably between his safe stacks of books.
You shouldn’t even know that men exist. We’re disgusting people. You don’t want us around. Trust me.”
How he thought he was finally getting somewhere with Castiel. The way he inched in closer, the way he brushed their elbows together atop the bar—the way Castiel had smiled afterwards.
Justin continues to chuckle as he raises his hands in playful surrender. “Kidding, kidding … always rile people up with
“So—are you two celebrating something?” Castiel asks as he unpacks the picnic basket onto the kitchen counter, obviously noting the case of beer and other food that is already there.
“Yeah. Y-you were gone, and now you’re back … and …” Dean whispers, still staring at the floor of the kitchen, noting all the spots of flour he missed while cleaning up. He closes his eyes and cringes at himself.
Dean has been quiet for too long, and he finds that he’s been staring at the man on top of him—blank faced and confused for well over a minute.
Castiel laughs, and the sound fills the padded room with so much needed comfort, that it forces Dean to roll over onto his ass and join in.
Dean leans back and out of his brother’s hold, so Sam scoots away again—giving Dean space. “Yeah, I mean—I think so. Cas’s lawyer said that it could really help their case if I do; but I need to be tactical about it.”
honor. But then again, he shouldn’t have been here at all. None of this would be happening if he had just trusted Cas to begin with. If he had trusted their relationship enough, no matter how new it might be, he wouldn’t be out here right now in this hallway, listening to his boyfriend try to kill a man if he had just listened to everyone who told him that this was a bad idea.
Those blue eyes search Dean’s face a moment, and then they drop to the side, looking up Dean’s arm, to his wrist and then his hand—to shaking fingers, shoring up the longer they’re there.
was gone. He thought he would miss it—in the moments of clarity he had between Dean’s rasping breaths and fevered kisses, Cas thought he would miss the danger. He thought that that
As he stretches out his arms and shakes his head to wake up— Dean tries to figure out exactly where he is, and how the hell he got here.
Reese takes one final step to close the distance between him and Sam, and Castiel drops low,  immediately sweeping Reese’s legs out from under him.
“Cas!” Dean says with an equal mix of happiness and relief—nearly reaching out and hugging him, but then he stops, thinking that perhaps
The shivering, terrified old woman—uncurls herself a little, taking a hesitant glance back up at Dean, and then, all at once, she stands up straight— her face,
Dean quickly shakes his head, finally looking up at his brother with the faintest hint of resolve. “Nah—I’ll drive. After all … I need to be in control of
“Dean … you don’t need to do this” Castiel pleads, several pitches lower, and it’s just soothing enough to make Dean cry even more.
Castiel stammers, senseless sounds stumbling out of his mouth before his mind has a chance to shape them.
Dean grins, nodding as he turns back to stare into that kind, magnanimous face. “Yeah … can you imagine that?
“Castiel … I …” Dean sighs, eventually breaking his gaze to look away at nothing in particular, “I can fall for you in a second. Falling for you is as easy as breathin’ for me; so I need to know that if I do, you’re not gonna just leave again and let me suffocate.”
“Good” Castiel confirms, and Dean is suddenly aware of just how close the man is—kneeling on the ground beside him, leaning over him, watchful, worrying,
“Dean? Are you alright?” Castiel asks, eyes bouncing from one flying piece of fabric to the next; but Dean has his own eyes shut tight, and his heart is beating in his throat, choking out any words he could possible say. “
should be taking this all more seriously and then you go and treat this interview like a ‘Dear, Penthouse’ letter!”
say that … and he could also light himself on fire. The latter would probably have less painful results.
Lynn nods as she reaches for a pot of coffee to pour some for Dean. “Why’s that? Work keepin’ you away?”
is, shitting all over his brother’s happiness because of a few unimportant details. “Yeah, sorry. I think this is really nice of you, Dean.”
But just as he bites his tongue, waiting for the sharp stab of and snap in his muscles, all Dean feels is the ground clashing against his body, knocking the wind out of him. “No!” he gasps, crying into the dirt—clutching it in his fist. “Please!”
—so she wants to travel, and so do I, and I am thinking we’ll have our wedding in Spain. Doesn’t that sound amazing? Spain?”
“Yeah, yeah. We’ll see” he mutters as Charlie’s steps turn around and fade out the door. He peeks up just as the last strands of her red hair are billowing away. “Oh, and keep an eye out for that Novak guy. If he comes in, I wanna have a word with him!”
, he can build a strong defense in my case. Of course, he will try to settle first in the hopes that this will never make it to court; but just in case it does …” Castiel fades off and Dean just watches him, noting for a moment the complete and separate life that Castiel is living apart from his. Here, sitting in his car—is this whole other human being. Someone new and different—someone with adventure and risk, and a history, more complex than most of the books in his library. Castiel is a whole story from head to toe, and Dean is simply on the prologue—yet, the rest appears to still be open to him. In spite of all this, Castiel still seems to be willing to let Dean flip through his pages and see what’s within.
With a wince, Dean cracks open an eye, finding that he’s staring directly into Castiel's face, and for the first time, he's actually
“I get that” Dean says softly, feeling drawn to the man now—so he moves across the small space and settles in next to Cas on the couch, putting one arm around his shoulder which instinctively makes the man nestle close to Dean’s side.
Dean squints down at her, hissing in pain with how tightly she’s squeezing him. “Jeez—ow! Tonight! I’m seeing him tonight!”
“Such good manners” Castiel snickers, finally tugging on the waistband of Dean’s jeans to pull them down his hips.
in your room just a bit ago. You see, he was going to put a note on your pillow, plus some extra chocolates—which
…” he laughs, stepping in closer as he looks that adorable barber up and down, “yeah, I think I can manage that.”
” Dean mutters—but he knows it’s true. Immediately after he dug his own grave with all this, Charlie jumped in and began collecting all the details for him. Dean had since resigned himself to the office once more, but he could hear Castiel’s and her conversation through the thin walls easily enough.
Dean nods as he grabs his soda cup and takes a sip from the straw. “Oh yeah. Sammy n’ I are about as close as you can get.”
“What the fuck!” he gasps, clamoring back as he looks across his now glowing skin; he soon stumbles and falls to the ground, but instead of hitting it with a
The barber glances back at him and grins—almost shyly, before continuing on with what he was doing. “So,
Dean smiles. “Right, right.” That makes him feel better though, knowing that there will be a big chunk of the afternoon where Cathy will be busy—from the ceremony to the photos, to speeches and toasts, she may not get many chances to get Cas all to herself.
“Are you alright, Dean—I mean, with all of this? I know that you’re not thrilled with the idea of me escorting an ex.”
“What?” Dean gasps, looking around the dash for some inclination of what happened, but all he can tell is that he’s slowing down—the landscape is no longer a blur of brown and green in the windows, and his baby’s engine is hissing, before it finally stalls completely. “No! No, no, no!
“So, it wasn’t until you checked in and Claire recognized your name, and we began talking about it, that I found out that you and Jimmy spent time together without me. And I had no idea that you were friends with Amelia until you said something just now. How did you meet her?”
to echo across the small room; and Dean is leaping from his seat immediately. “That’s him!” he shouts, dropping the phone onto the workbench as he goes bolting to the backdoor.
A slight sting wriggles through his gut with the mention of Brad’s name. He has avoided thinking about what Brad did in that bathroom ever since Castiel got whisked away in that cop car; but now, the subject is unavoidable. “You didn’t have to defend me like that” Dean finally says, feeling guiltier than ever as he notes the sores and cuts covering Castiel’s hands.
Castiel sighs. “Humans who are in romantic relationships do that. Or humans who are simply looking for sex do that.”
Dean finally stops his measuring and mixing, feeling the sudden urge to crack a few eggs over his brother’s thick head. “No—that’s
Mr. Hanley grins even wider as he shakes his head. “Ah, the flowers are doin’ all the work, sir. I just make sure they’re happy.”
enjoying his day. It had been quiet, and Charlie had been too distracted by all the Cheeto-books and cataloging that she hadn’t really needled him for details about anything yet. She did ask him if Cas had fun at the wedding, but Dean just shrugged and pretended to be too wrapped up in counting the cash box to talk about it, and thankfully, Charlie let it go without any fight. But now, there was a fight, and Dean could feel it radiating from the girl like heat from a hot engine. “Um …”
The last dregs slip from his glass and slide like acid down his throat, but he feels too numb to care. The whiskey did its job—all he can feel now is the hard press of the stool beneath him and the cool, varnished wood of the bar against his elbows.
—someone around here gets it! Sam and Bobby never quite understood Dean’s love for his job, but there is a code of ethics that comes with the library sciences, and nearly everyone is respectful of that code when they come across it. It seems like the only place on earth where that sort of compromise is even possible. “I like you, Susan. You get me. What do ya say you leave this old geezer and we run away to my library together?”
Its white-capped wings, splayed out at its side. Its yellow beak, opening and closing—eyes wide, unblinking. “I– I don’t know.”
“You’re a good, good boy, Dean Winchester. For all the bad that the world has given you, you’re still so, so good.”
came along. Then, the idea of spending a week in the Big Apple didn’t sound nearly as bad. Somehow, that man can make even Dean’s worst nightmares, just a little bit appealing.
Castiel shudders and his body tenses on top of him, giving Dean room to suck him in a little more. “
Magda glares at him, obviously not as intimidated by her boss as Kelsey is. The woman is older than Castiel after all, and she’s a brawny thing, thin—yet has enough muscle that she could easily take down a full-grown man half her age and double her height without a second thought. Castiel doesn’t sway her, and his random appearance here reeks of ulterior motives, and her nostrils seem to be flaring because of it. “He’s fine, sir.”
And now Dean is truly confused, because with Cas’s words and his increasing closeness—Dean’s brain is functioning on only a few synapses. The rest have temporarily shut down. “I—I don’t understand.”
Charlie’s eyes are squinted when he comes stomping in through the front doors of the library, almost as if she doesn’t believe it’s really him. “Dean? You’re back already?”
“That’s not …” Sam groans, finally walking over to one of the stools by the table to sit down, “whatever, man. Whatever you wanna call it,
Castiel rolls his eyes, hating that Dean always feels the need to ask the stupidest questions at the most inopportune times. “If I didn’t, you two would spend the next twenty minutes arguing and making fun of one another, and we’d both be flaccid and unable to perform. I would much rather continue what we were doing than entertain you humans’ incessant need to mock one another. Now, go get what you need so I can pleasure you in a way that will have you screaming my name.”
over this last year). Part of him always thought that he could someday find a way to see Castiel again, as well as all the others he’s loved and lost, but if everyone’s soul just merges into one now, that means the individual is truly gone,
At that moment, the door creaks open, and Dean jumps aside as the angel steps out into the hall. His new, dark jeans are hugging closely to his hips, and the white t-shirt stretches tightly across his chest until it disappears beneath the navy-blue buttondown that’s draped over his broad shoulders. The sleeves are rolled up to his elbows, just how Dean does it, but the angel’s thick forearms wrestle against the folds in a way that makes Dean’s mouth go dry.
to want him until this very moment. Seeing him again in the lobby the other day reignited the spark, but touching him now set Castiel entire body ablaze, and he would rather wait here forever and turn to ash than have Dean tell him there’s no hope and douse out his flames. There would be no returning to normal if he has to leave this room and leave Dean behind once and for all. Life as he knew it, that comfortable little routine he lived day in and day out for years—with work and Claire and a quiet home and an empty bed, would all become torturous. He was numb to most of it, used to most of it, and he ignored the ache of loneliness that crept in every now and then and threatened to pull his attention away from Claire, pull him into himself and down into the dark. He was very good at ignoring everything except for work and that lovely girl in his charge; but Dean could easily shroud him in that darkness now, and if he does, Castiel fears he might never come out of it.
“Uh—no worries, Kelsey. No harm done.” He clears his throat as he straightens his sleeve, trying to give off an air of professional-composure that will somehow counter the exact opposite of his reality right now. “I just came by to check in on that guest—ensure that his complimentary treatments are going smoothly.”
Dean watches him from the corner of his eye, studying the way the moonlight mixes with the orange glow rising up from the streetlamps in just a way that amplifies all of Castiel’s angles. He looks so hard and dangerous right now; yet, the softness in his eyes and the pink of his lips calm those razor edges to the point that they’re inviting Dean to touch them; and he
Dean quickly sets down his mug before lifting his hand and stopping her from saying anything else. “No—sorry, I shouldn’t pry.”
“Yeah, yeah” Dean grumbles, attempting to drink some more of his coffee, but then he recalls that it’s already gone.
—I will see you then. Alright. Goodbye.” A second later, and Castiel is lowering his phone, staring at Dean’s wall a long moment before finally turning bashfully to meet his boyfriend’s eyes. “That was a woman I used to date … Cathy.”
. Enough is enough. “I can’t believe I let Claire talk me into this” he mouths as he listens to the sounds coming from the other side of the thin wood door.
The other man eventually nods as he leans back once more, staring out the windshield at the dark street, as if it’s concealing all the perils yet to come. “Martin …
“Good morning to you too, Dean.” Cas’s voice is raspy, but awake—and Dean envies the sound. “I wanted to call and see how last night went.”
Jack sighs and then reaches out to put a calming hand on Dean’s wrist. “Dean … there is no more Heaven. There is no more Hell. The Empty is at peace, asleep just as it wanted, and anything that ever
“I dont know-ah.. what you mean..” Cas gasped as Dean kissed along a particularly sensitive spot on his collarbone.
“I’m fine.” Dean replied automatically, keeping his eyes focused on the beads. He found himself counting, and it was calming in an odd way. “Sorry, just… kind of zoned out, there.”
“Hey! You two idjits can sort that out later. And stop mopin’ at each other. What happened, did. You can’t change the past - just fix the future.” Bobby stared them both down, daring either to say anything. “Right. Now that’s done, moving on. You said his manager is on her way?”
Again with the room for interpretation. Dean was positive he was sober, but with how low his inhibitions were, he decided it was a great time to stop drinking anyway. Throughout the whole brief conversation, they had remained pressed together - yet Dean felt a surge of loss as Cas moved away, even if it was only an inch. Cas left just enough space between their upper bodies that they weren’t touching anymore, but only just.
“Shut the fuck up would ya.” Dean snapped at him, then started sucking a mark roughly into Castiel’s neck.
“Thought I’d beat that out of you, boy. Do I have to do it again?” John shook him when he didn’t answer. “Well?! I won’t have a fairy as a son, so what will it be!”
Dean nodded slightly, not trusting his voice. Castiel stared at him for a few moments longer, then eventually backed off. The professor returned to his desk, then looked back at Dean as though he was waiting for something. Dean frowned, confused, and dropped his eyes – to see the beads that Castiel always wore, sitting on the front of his desk, right where Castiel had been.
Dean looked up, just in time to watch as Castiel stepped forward into his space, his mug abandoned on the counter. Castiel stared at him, holding his gaze as he slowly raised his hand, giving Dean plenty of time to back off. But Dean didn’t, and eventually he felt Castiel’s palm cup his cheek gently.
Dean stared at her for a few moments, apprehensive. He was also surprised that she remembered that – he’d mentioned it in passing, when he got put into her team and she asked what his goals were. However, Jody tilted her head to the folder, so he glanced down at it again. He read over some of the things in the folder – a description of the training, topics and requirements, things like that – then he glanced back up at her with a pained expression.
“I will not-“ Michael began, but his words were cut off as Benny twisted his arm further, using the momentary pain to push him back down in the chair. Benny let his arm go, then dropped his hands on Michael’s shoulders, effectively holding him down. “Unhand me immediately. You have no idea who you’re dealing with.”
“No, dude, you don’t need to apologise.” Sam stopped him and shook his head. “I get it, you’re going through stuff. It’s just nice, feels like my brother is coming back.”
Castiel caught the look of pity in Dean’s eyes, and he hated it. He hated how it made him feel like he was less of a person, someone who couldn’t make it on their own or something. It made him feel incapable; useless, even. He was about to say so, when Dean spoke again.
Sam chuckles, feeling his chest warm with the sight of his bumbling brother. He truly loves seeing him like this—excited and focused on something
The cold gel instantly warms when it drips onto his rim, but he jumps anyway—not having felt anything new down there in so very long.
Dean’s shoulders hunch up, either from guilt, or from that unfortunate memory clamoring back into his mind. “Sorry …” he mutters, feeling like things are crawling all over him again. “I had to get away from my girlfriend’s dad … he sorta … he sorta caught me trying to take her bra off.”
—and he knows this isn’t heaven. Dean wonders for a solitary moment before he slips back into sleep, what a person has to do in their life to deserve

Dean inhales—letting his mind wander to his new apartment, which is actually pretty nice. It’s bigger than his old one in Kansas. It’s in a rustic, brick building that has a lot of interesting character. It’s bare and rough and classic, and it’s exactly Dean’s style. He thinks about his new office, how it borders a park that spreads along the Arkansas River. He thinks about all the new things he’ll get to design—and with that, a small, spiraling thrill spins in his gut as he imagines the new challenges he has yet to face. He loves solving tough problems, figuring out new, creative fixes for other people’s lives. It makes him feel like he’s leaving his stamp on things—really making a difference.
He fears he’s made things tense now, so Castiel shifts awkwardly as well, sitting up straighter beside his friend, soon matching his gaze—blank and scared to the other end of the room. “I … might have. I’m not sure. When are you talking about?”
After that, the room falls silent, and even Becky doesn’t say a word—Dean wonders if she’s even still there, because he can’t see her in the mirror anymore.
Castiel shrugs a little before glancing up the road. “No worries.  I suppose I’ll be seeing you around—that is, if you plan on playing
" he says again with more conviction. What a strange name for his subconscious to come up with! He's almost certain he's never heard
With a long breath, he eventually clears his throat, and it snaps the girl’s attention back to him. “Good job, Claire. I knew you would get the hang of it eventually.”
With a nod, Dean watches Bobby as he gets up and turns back towards the stairs. “Yeah … sure thing” he says, still grinning.
Dean clears his throat and swipes his eyes with the back of his hand. “No, no—it’s fine. I’m blubbering. It was good timing, actually. I need to put something in my mouth so I can stop flappin’ it.”
—coming into my office and stealing my stationary? Impersonating me through a note and offering up company goods like they’re yours to give? That’s not okay, Claire! If you were anyone else, anyone else at all, you would not only be fired, but I would be pressing charges. I know what you were trying to do, but this is a business. This is the real world and good intentions rarely go hand-in-hand with professional policy.”
. His family was super religious, but uh—he got out of it. Now, he’s just this weird, hilarious dude that…
"It was nice" Castiel continues, so gently, his words could be mistaken for the breeze.  "Whenever you looked at me that way,  I felt—"
Castiel pulls away once more and glares at him with a smirk. “And there goes that self-deprecation again.”
She had given him the clerk job after he dropped out of college. He was originally going to try for a degree in History, but
“I didn’t know that you were friends with them. I mean, I didn’t … not until Claire mentioned it. If I had known, I would’ve told them I didn’t mind if they stayed in touch with you.”
Castiel’s face seems to heat up as his cheeks hollow and nostrils flare. “I so miss the ocean” he mutters, which makes Dean snort. Finally, the barber looks back at him again and forces a smile, but it only takes a second for the force to slip away and a natural ease to take its place. “So—I was thinking, with your face shape …” Castiel quickly begins, turning around to grab a small booklet from the back of the counter. He then flips through a few pages before turning it around to show Dean the image inside, “that a fade with a brush up would look very nice on you. It’s professional, and you can comb it back with some gel when you go into the office; but when you want to take it easy, you can just towel it dry and that’ll look nice too. What do you think?”
if these women want to overpay me for stupid jobs, just because they like the way I look while doin’ ‘em? Who is that hurting?
,” he says finally, nodding once he thinks about the angel’s eyes—deep like sea-glass, shattering against Dean’s own suffocating ignorance.
I know, I know ... I haven't updated this fic for months! But, in my defense, life got in the way. It's still the way, but I needed to write so I wouldn't go crazy. I hope you enjoyed this chapter. Hopefully I can get the much-anticipated wedding chapter posted in the next week or so.
crazy. Those who can see me usually feel like I’m just an illusion, so they never bother trying to speak with me; but you’re the first to actually
go—every Saturday. Cas cleans me up real good.” The man then takes off his cowboy hat and turns his head from side to side, to showcase his neatly trimmed hair and clean shaven cheeks.
…” Castiel quickly pulls the towel off of Dean’s face and flaps it lightly in front of him to cool his skin.
Dean hears her answer the call, but he doesn’t look away from the barber this time, wondering what in the hell just happened a moment ago—
“They didn’t …” Charlie begins, but her face changes mid-sentence, “well, maybe they did. Maybe this is payback! Maybe you were so utterly awkward and boring, forty school children decided to go all
He shouldn’t have told Claire that he saw Dean at the pool. If he had only kept his big mouth shut, he wouldn’t be in this mess right now.
Dean’s death grip on the armrests keeps him from flipping the man off. But eventually, he takes a deep breath and closes his eyes a moment, trying to gather himself enough to get the book—after all, the engine isn’t even running yet.
, let me just reassure you that you have nothing to worry about. If this man even has an ounce of sense, he would be mad to choose anyone else over you, especially someone who has already failed to make it work with him. You are sweet and funny, and extremely handsome.”
curious about all this. He hasn’t ever actually seen Krav Maga practiced, other than in movies and that’s all fake bullshit. The tactical elements seem really interesting, so he does want to learn—and maybe if he asks enough questions about it, he’ll learn to focus on something
Dean stops mid-fury, puzzled for a moment by the question—but then he realizes, Cas doesn’t know. Cas doesn’t know anything about Dean’s exes; and until Cathy had called last week, Dean didn’t know anything about
Castiel lets out a deep breath, making it seem as if he doesn’t believe him in the slightest, so Dean lets out a sigh as well, realizing that he’s only a few hours in, and he’s already fucking up this maybe-relationship.
. Yer on the wrong side of town!” the woman chuckles while raising her hand to scrunch her unbelievably big hair.
things …” Charlie then rests her chin on her fists and bites her lip a moment. “Hold on—let me think about how to word this so that you get the
Dean exhales sheepishly, taking one last look at Becky—who is still staring at him like she can read every thought in his twisted little mind.
“Sam! Sam! Over here! Look this way!” One man yells, lifting a giant camera to his face just as Sam turns and smolders in his direction.
He wants to only feel whole when the other man is there; he wants to know that ache the moment Castiel walks away—he wants to know it because
And it doesn’t feel like the first time they’ve done this. Dean is surprised by that—in the moments he can think about anything other than how good it feels to have Castiel in his arms again. He thought that this might feel electric and intoxicating like it had with the others he’s cared for in the past; but it doesn’t. It feels
Needless to say, this leads to a lot of mistakes being made—and Charlie is at her whit’s end cleaning up after him.
“Your quest will end in Vagina Town?” Dean grumbles—grimacing immediately after he said it because he’s obviously been hanging around this girl
pain, and he can almost always control it if he focuses in on the fact that he’s now … a very different kind of being. He’s now …
Dean growls, getting angry all over now that the poor book is back in his sights. “It’s probably some jackass kid, trying to play a prank. Or—maybe some religious freak, trying to send a message.”
“Yes. It was the book on bird watching that I had checked out. The last I remember, I was in a tree, reading about the Scissor Tailed Fly Catcher, and then ironically enough, one defecated right onto the page I was reading, so I shut the book and set it down on the branch so I could get a closer look at the bird, and that must be where it still is now. I don’t remember climbing down with it. The bird was beautiful though, so the book was helpful in that respect. I wouldn’t have known to look for that type of bird otherwise.”
we could at least be friends. Plus, I'm very stubborn and like to get my way— it drove my siblings insane.”
“You’re just as dirty as ever” Dean purrs, immediately yanking Cas’s pants down—briefs and all and exposing his naked skin to the room. “Did you like what you saw, Castiel? Did it make you hard spying on me like that?” He wraps his fingers around Castiel’s shaft and begins to stroke.
“What’s wrong?” he asks immediately, sitting up in bed, worried that something happened at the library, and he’s starting to regret his choice to stay home today.
Boiling hot tears run down his cheeks, and eventually—the note falls from Dean’s hand as well. But his hand isn't empty for long, because he’s soon climbing into the backseat, grabbing that old wooden case—opening it up to look at the pistol tucked inside.
Castiel finally lifts his head and looks Dean in the eye, and the blues are so heavy with sadness that they could break Dean in two if he let them. “I thought I
Dean rolls his eyes at her dramatics, but doesn’t stop to contest them. He just grabs his jacket off the back of the chair and goes bolting out the door.
Hank sits down as well and nods. “Yes, sir. thirty five years of service. Made it through two wars and over three hundred missions. My entire life has been in the military.”
; which is only more unsettling, so Dean drops his head back onto the ground and closes his eyes as he groans loudly. “What the hell was that?” he mutters, suddenly feeling very achy from their explosive collision.
The smile grows just a little more. “It might—however, let’s just see what Brad’s attorney approaches us with first. We won’t know what we’re dealing with until Brad presses charges.”
…” Dean finally tears his eyes away from the man across from him so that he can flip through the papers on the table. “Yeah—
imagine it, Dean.” Castiel puts out his hand and twines their fingers together, sending soft shocks throughout every speck of Dean’s body, lighting him up from the inside out, and he feels his skin begin to glow.
“What is going on?” Cathy is suddenly beside him, looking as beautiful as ever in her shimmering gold dress, and Dean tries to answer her, but the sound of Castiel cursing out Brad again thwarts his efforts. “Is that Cas in there? Oh my God!”
“Well then, she sounds like a winner. You should appreciate her more.” Dean continues to laugh, but then stops, suddenly wondering if Cas ever
After all, he needs a rest; and by the sounds of it, this old woman needs someone to be kind to her for once.
Dean’s cock is practically ripping through his shorts now, and Castiel side eyes it—eventually throwing his leg over Dean’s middle and straddling him.
The other man chuckles again as he leans into the kiss, immediately leaning further and further—pushing Dean down flat again so he can continue what he was doing before. “I want you to know something about me, Dean …”
“You have no fuckin’ idea, man” Dean grunts, eyes already rolling into the back of his head with just the
“You … you don’t pay attention to the Hollywood life very much, do you?” Dean asks, pulling Castiel’s focus to him for a third time.
It took him by surprise at first, but the angel didn’t stop himself from matching every move that Dean made. Even though he’s a celestial being who’s supposed to be above all these carnal desires, the feeling of Dean’s warmth, his weight, his heart beating fast beneath his skin—it awakened that memory that Castiel pushed away long ago. He was human back then, back when April fooled him into her bed. He hated the reaper for toying with his vulnerability, but he loved the way her hands ran up the sides of his body. It was electric and toxic, and it felt dangerous and right all at once. He blames his humanity for loving it so much; but now, with his grace flowing safely within this vessel—
Dean nods again as he looks around the room. It’s fairly empty expect for a punching bag in the corner and a couple of free standing, padded pillars on the other side—probably meant for practicing kicks. It’s nothing surprising, and Dean has done enough boxing and wrestling to know that this won’t feel too out of place for him; but he’s never been in the situation where he also wants to mount the guy he’s supposed to be knocking out, so this room feels really foreign because of it. And now, Dean is having a hard time catching his breath.
“I’m not my grandfather, Dean. I don’t consider praying to only be when someone is on their knees calling out to me. In fact, the times that humans do
Dean dropped his eyes then. Oh, he remembered. But he didn’t particularly want to. He was always more violent with Cas than he was with anyone else, excepting Sam. It was something he hadn’t wrapped his head around, hadn’t tried, hadn’t wanted to. The why of it.
He remembered the previous afternoon. Castiel asked – no, told him – not to lie. He’d told Dean he wouldn’t ask for an explanation, but never to lie to him. He didn’t think Castiel had asked the question now to test him, especially after the conversation he’d eavesdropped on. No, the man was asking because for whatever reason, he did care.
Now Cas’s grace is singing inside him, because he had known that at some point—they would have to talk about this. His confession came as a surprise to Dean, of that he’s sure; but in the months that have passed since, Dean has certainly had the time to figure out how he feels about everything. However, the man hadn’t said anything about it when Jack brought him back from the dead, so Cas just assumed that Dean didn’t share his feelings. He resigned himself to just being happy that he’s alive and that he still has their friendship. All he needs is Dean in his life. That’s all he’s ever needed. “Of course I remember; but Dean … you don’t need to—”
The buzzing begins to soften, slowly fading into nothing more than a soft tick at the base of his skull.
“When you were a child, I was told that you were struck by lightning?” Castiel then asks, eyes widening as they wait for a response.
