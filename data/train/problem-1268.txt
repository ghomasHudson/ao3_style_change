“’K,” Alex had stifled a sigh, apparently deciding that if she had to be woken up for work, she might as well make it worth her while. “Want coffee?”
“Exactly,” Mason touched his finger to his nose. “After Holmes let Moriarty stroll away before the building blew up to kingdom come, I did a Google search for Miss Violet Emilie Laura Smith.”
“This is the key to their back garden. The passcode to their home security system is 0097. They may have a dog patrolling the house as well. Rucastle likes to starve them so they are mad with hunger and pain. As sentimental as people are about animals, especially abused animals, do not hesitate to put the dog down if he does attack.”
She ran her hand over her flabby, slack belly. She hadn’t needed Molly to tell her she lost the baby. She knew. Had already known in the shopping centre, had realized she was losing too much blood to sustain a pregnancy. That she would go into shock and…well.
John threw himself into his task with enthusiasm. He followed “Rose Spender’s” trail with the same vigor as he did with any case he had worked with Sherlock. His adrenaline rush wasn’t fulfilled by the thrill of the chase, but with the vindictive joy that came with knowing he was pulling the wool over Mycroft’s eyes.
“Molly Hooper, what are you doing?” Mary Watson scolded the young woman as she jumped off the love seat to take the tray from her. She nearly tripped over poor old Toby, Molly’s cat in the process. “Go ‘way, kitty,” Mary said as Toby decided to rub up and down her leg.
“Violet,” he had said, his face creased with concern after he had checked her pupils with his little penlight. “This could be psychosomatic…. But it could be neurological.”
Most of the desks were deserted and the few cops still there didn’t even so much as glance at her as she entered Lestrade’s office. Maybe they had recognized her from when she came with Sherlock. Maybe she looked harmless. Maybe they should have realized that a woman wanted for treason in America had just broken into their boss’ office but they were just that incompetent.
The drive to the restaurant was uneventful as was the drive to the Watson’s terrace house. But as they got closer to the terrace house, both women saw a Volvo parked right in front of the house and someone dressed head-to-toe in black waiting for them by the front door. A hood was pulled over her head. Even her scarf and large handbag were black.
Thank you all for the lovely comments and kudos. I'm not the best at timely replies but I read and appreciate every one of them and every one of you who are reading! :^D
“Yes, but they were very bad,” Mary cooed reassuringly, patting the Not-the-Housekeeper on the shoulder as she escorted Wiggins, Evie and Mrs. Hudson out of the lounge.
“Everything about Holmes is convenient, haven’t you noticed that by now?” Mason reached for his pint. He looked over his shoulder again, then whispered to Donovan, “I think you’ll come to the same conclusion that I did after you read the files. I believe, with all my heart that Miss Smith is no mild-mannered PA. I think she’s a double-agent. At first I thought Interpol but now I think CIA. I think they know Holmes is dirty. He’s a drug addict, a possible murderer and a lunatic on top of all that. I think Miss Smith was put in Holmes’ path on purpose. I think she was sent to spy on him.”
But while he didn’t wish to discuss his private life with that particular Violet Holmes, there was another Violet Holmes he could confide in…
He sniffed then sniffed again, as if he had a cold. Wished he had a tissue. Wished his head didn’t ache, wished his entire body didn’t ache.
The tomb next to Morrison’s was black marble, with an effigy of a cross carved into it. On top of that tomb sat a young man with short black hair but an impressive black beard. He wore a grey knitted headband over his ears, like the ones serious runners wore when jogging during bitterly cold days. He smoked cigarettes while listening to music on his iPhone, nodding his head in time with whatever tune his device was playing. He wore a thick, woolen black coat and a bright red muffler around his neck, but he still clapped his hands then rubbed them together, trying to stay warm. Something caught his attention on the other side of Jim Morrison’s grave. The young man pulled an ear bud out of his ear and said, “
“Looked like what?” Heathcliff squared his shoulders. His voice had a defensive edge to it. “OK, so I bounced his head on the ground, so what? I admitted it got out of hand, I said I was sorry and I’ll make amends. What more do you want?”
Huge thanks to everyone who has stuck with me and this story especially with the erratic posting. I think I can finally get back on a schedule now, until Labor Day Weekend at least...
“I can’t risk Mary taking off to search for Maisie on her own, especially now. Not only do I risk never seeing my daughter again,” John felt the old, smoldering resentment towards Mary kindling again. “But Mary could lead the Professor right to Maisie and then…”
As they walked to the back of the clubhouse towards the “chapel”, Rat Boy muttered to Trager, “So, does the Limey talk like that all the time? All formal and shit?”
; John loosened his tie as Violet set the drinks and basket down with the skill of an expert waitress. .
she thought desperately as she headed towards Winterbourne-on-Avon, to where she and Mary had decided to meet.
While it was sleeveless, it was not strapless. There were  the tiniest of straps holding the frock up.
“You’re stalling,” Lisbeth cut across them both. “Your long overdue conversation needs to be done tonight because once the shit hits the fan; you two aren’t going to have a chance to properly talk again until Florida.”
Mary knelt over an unconscious young man, using his own handcuffs to secure him. Violet perceived that his black uniform was definitely military in origin, but for the life of her, she couldn’t place what branch of service he had to be in.
They married quietly, at a registry office in London after they graduated from Oxford. Neither of them wanted to deal with a church wedding, or to argue with their families which church they should be wed in.
Stunned, Violet froze for a moment, but then snaked her arms around his neck and kissed him back. “Oh,” she said breathlessly, running her fingers through his hair.
, John thought wryly as Sherlock finally stopped in front of Oscar Wilde’s tomb. As Sherlock looked left to right for Dupin, John took a moment to regard the marker. He had to admit, it was a strange thing to behold, more of a sculpture than a proper monument. A naked sphinx carved out of a block of stone. It wasn’t a traditional sphinx, not like the gigantic one in Egypt. This sphinx was solemn, severe even. He also had odd, square-like wings. The sphinx looked like an angry angel in flight, looking for a sinner to condemn. There was a glass barricade around the sculpture. John vaguely remembered there was some sort of tradition to kiss the grave marker for luck or something ridiculous like that. Apparently the caretakers had grown tired of wiping lipstick stains off the stone and had erected the barricade. That hadn’t deterred the kisses or any other graffiti. Now tourists kissed the glass instead of the stone.
“I see you’ve not been pulling your weight,” John quipped to Gladstone, who was curled up on the sofa, as usual.
Ignoring them all, he located the nearest lift. The silvery doors slid open and the lift was mercifully was empty. Sherlock stepped inside, hit the button he wanted and watched as the doors slid silently shut again.
“I wonder whatever happened to that whistleblower, the lass who tattled on PharmaLogistics LTD, the company that mucked up the birth control drug, Trifexanor,” Moriarty said idly, as if discussing whether or not it would snow tonight. “Detective-Inspector, was Molly on Trifexanor? Wait, I really should be asking you that,” he lolled his head back towards Sherlock. “Either way, I’ve got a little secret for you boys. You too, madam,” he gave Violet’s wrist a little shake. “So listen up.” He lowered his voice to a stage whisper. “It wasn’t a muck-up. The placebos were placed in the middle of the cycle instead of the end
The panicked cries of the pilot and co-pilot didn’t really register with John, however. He could feel his wrist start to slip out of Sherlock’s hands. His own feeble hold on Sherlock’s chair started failing as well. His stomach flopped horribly over and over, especially when his left hand could no longer keep its hold on Sherlock’s chair.
There was no trace of the affectionate pet from before. Gladstone knew he was Working now. And he knew his priorities: Protect his Mistress. Obey his Mistress.
to indicate I am in an exclusive relationship with her. It would not do to risk blowing our cover story by hanging around my…”
“Are you alright?” Mary kept her eyes on the road but she wasn’t able to keep the worry from her voice.
Then without so much as raising her voice above a murmur, she gave her a dressing-down that shamed Janine to her very core. When Janine tried to salvage her pride, taunted her by asking if she was alright with wearing another man’s wedding ring, Miss Fucking Smith dismissed her with a withering look while informing her
Lestrade refused to waste a bullet wounding Moriarty. “Let her go,” he said since both Sherlock and Moriarty stayed silent.  Lestrade fell silent as well once he realized those two were content to only eye each other for the moment, each sizing the other up.
Mycroft, as usual, leaned on his infernal umbrella. He stood below one of the few overhead lights that still worked. He wore a heavy coat with a maroon scarf knotted around his skinny neck. “Well, two for one, how unexpected,” he drawled. “Agent Hunter,
Mary’s eyes had widened just slightly. When she had squeezed his wrist and told him to go enjoy his surprise, Sherlock knew for sure she had picked up on what he was telling her.
“New evidence has come to light that she’s innocent, but I’m afraid there’s still a very large target on her back,” Mycroft coolly explained as he explained his perfectly manicured nails. “There’s a catch, of course.”
Violet flicked her eyes towards Sherlock. Sherlock looked as pure as the driven snow, or he would have if he wasn’t fighting to keep a smirk off his face.
Sherlock talked over him, “I had an interesting conversation with Rucastle regarding Greek mythology. He is obsessed, especially regarding the Hades and Persephone myth.”
Sherlock slipped his hand from out of Violet’s hold and bounded out the door. John, Mary and Violet followed suit.
“Ah,” John put the pieces together. “This is your ‘in’ to Rucastle’s big party at The Copper Beaches. You think he’s going to try to  steal Violet from out underneath you in front of his celebrity friends.”
Sherlock laughed, a rare sound, like a bell suddenly ringing in an abandoned church. He tucked his long, elegant hands into the pockets of his dressing gown as he rocked back and forth on his bare feet. “Heaven forbid we don’t mind our manners in the throes of passion.”
While Mr. and Mrs. Holmes had no idea that a snake glided through their back garden, preying on their youngest child, Mycroft knew. Sherlock claimed Heathcliff had successfully manipulated both Mycroft and Sherlock to stay silent about the abuse. Violet and John disagreed. They thought Mycroft was just being a coward, afraid of the fallout if he had spoken up on his brother’s behalf.
Fortunately for Dupin, John’s mobile hummed, his own mobile, not the prepaid. “It’s Sherlock,” John’s silvery brows flew up when he read the caller ID, “On his own mobile.”
“A necessary risk that was greatly appreciated,” the old lion said amiably. “Plus, we also appreciate your prompt payments. Your accounts are in order, well, not quite.” Now the old lion was regretful. “You were supposed to deliver Violet Hunter to us, not get pummeled by her.”
“Oh,” John said glumly, remembering Sherlock’s longwinded tirade about the general incompetence of Molly’s replacement during their cab ride to the scene. “We know.”
Mary, of course was putting it together faster than John, “Her stepfather or rather her mother’s common law husband, to be more accurate. Susie,” she purposely made her voice gentle. “You never really saw who broke into 221B that night did you?”
Violet nodded, feeling her knees threatening to give out as the enormity of what she had just done hit her.
“Violet,” Sherlock’s voice was a dark and dangerous thing, making the V, L and T of her name all sharp edges and points.
“Then he met Dr. Watson and he changed. He became more than just a proper genius. He became as bright as all the stars in the firmament.” She then reached out and cupped Violet’s face in her hands. Her hands were soft, wrinkled like crepe paper. “Then he met you. One more star in his universe,” she patted Violet’s cheek. “I don’t know if he’s in love with you, dear. But he’s fond of you.”
“Sugar, don’t worry, Mama’s working on it,” Annie had lied then handed Anthea off to Marie. “You’re right, she shouldn’t hear this. Go with the nice lady, Maud, be a good girl.”
This time, she snapped out of whatever fug she had been in. “Hey,” she turned her head and smiled. “Am I calling your wife or a cab?”
“Jesus Christ, Sherlock,” John ran his hand down his face. “Yeah, that would be one of those Not Good things you
“I confirmed it. I even have their room numbers if you want to make a house call,” she lowered her arms. “Look, I mean no disrespect. I know how important respect is in your world. I wouldn’t have drawn at all if it wasn’t for that idiot.” She then pointed her gun at the prospect who had jumped and whined “Aw, c’mon, lady!”
“Eddie, don’t be silly. You don’t want to be stuck indoors all day long. And this is Miss Smith. She is going to be your new
, but like I said my doctor’s more worried about the cancer risks,” a flicker of anxiety crossed her face. But she grinned again. “He was pissed when I told him how Sherlock made me throw up again after I had gotten sick at the Copper Beaches. He said that was risky as hell and he should have taken me to an A&E.”
Violet regretfully shook her head, her chestnut curls rippling down her back as she did so. “It was already reserved, so the kids will have to make do with Davies Penthouse instead.”
“Oh my God,” Violet half-laughed half-groaned. “Is this how you wore Sherlock down? Kept talking until he gave in so you would shut up?”
But Sherlock duck-walked over to Noelie while she was hugged tightly by her partner-in-thievery, “Hello Raoul,” Sherlock said drily.
Still, he felt like a bum compared to Harry. Every single article of clothing she wore, while simple, had an expensive designer label stitched into it.
The plane jerked and jolted. John honestly thought he would be sick before the plane actually crashed. His feet still dangled helplessly below him at an awkward, painful angle. He squeezed his eyes tightly shut…
). After mentally building a specific room for Anthea in his massive mind palace, he then stared out the car windows, his irritation returning. Of course it would have to be tonight that he had to play this farce with Mycroft when he should be with John.
Violet kicked her own weapon away from Julia’s reaching fingers. “Didn’t I just tell you listening to Moriarty is the worst thing anyone can do? Now, on your belly, oh, stop fucking whining, you’re not going to
, Missy thought, taking the pen cap off and sticking  it in her mouth like a cigarette. Chewing on the cap, she thought again,
“Obviously, the boxes are too small,” Sherlock agreed insensitively as he drummed his fingertips against his chin. “We can rule out midgets too.”
Then, evilly, he imagined telling his Little Brother that Ford had been very sentimental when naming his daughter and the S stood for…
“I wouldn’t treat this like an experiment,” Sherlock scowled as he took Violet’s shoes off. “I would never do that.”
flooded!” John cried out in dismay as he watched Honoré wade in. The brackish green water already came up to the lad’s sternum and he wasn’t even halfway through the tunnel yet. “I’m going to have to swim for it,” John moaned after seeing Honoré’s shoulders disappear under the water.
“Of course,” Heathcliff started pulling off his glove. He held his ruined hand out. “So nice seeing you again… Sherlock.”
“No, Mickey,” William said innocently. “It was mine, I was bad. I went to the grove by myself when Mummy and Papa told me not to go…”
Their arms and legs tangled together, they pushed and ground against each other. They had to  breathe from their noses as they couldn’t get enough of each other’s mouths and tongues. Time ceased to exist, the world beyond the bedroom ceased to exist. Every single person who was out for their blood, from Moriarty to Mycroft to Mary could have been waiting at their bedroom door with pitchforks and torches and neither one of them would have given a damn.
“Victor was a mistake.” Sherlock said evenly. “The Work overshadowed all my personal relationships. I never met anyone else who made me feel the same as John did… until you.” When Violet swallowed hard and turned to study the trains again, he demanded softly, “Look me in the eye and tell me if Jordan had walked back into your life right now, could you say no?”
Finally he replied, “You want something more than unlimited political power and an open agreement to continue covering up your… ah…
“Sherloc- errm Sheryl,” Violet found herself automatically reverting to her “Miss Smith” voice within minutes of being out in public with Sherlock. Old habits die hard… “The Four Seasons, are you sure, it’s quite dear after all.”
John nearly fell over as he did so, but the cop who had originally thrust him into the police car righted him. Then he was all but dragged into a building John didn’t recognize from any holiday blog or Forbes Travel Guide. His chest started to ache as they took him instead through what had to be a back door, but to what building, John had no idea.
That one simple syllable was all it took. In a flash, Sherlock took two long-legged steps away from the doorway then dropped to his knees between John’s slightly spread legs. To John’s surprise, he buried his face into John’s chest, tucking his black curly head beneath his chin while wrapping his long arms around his torso.
,” Sherlock put his fingers to his lips and then immediately pulled them away, wincing. “Actually, I haven’t taken them in over a week. Maybe longer. I think the last time I took my pills was when we confirmed Toller’s involvement in the Burned Girls case. Yes, the fifth of August. The last dose I took was on your faux birthday.”
a damn good profiler. You just didn’t’ realize how you felt about her until it was too late, after you came back from the Fall and she was engaged to Tom-What’s-His-Name. Even though you were high, you would have never gone to her apartment if you didn’t love her a little bit. You don’t
She had barely gotten through reading Mary’s post on John’s blog after he had been found before bursting into loud, choking sobs. She turned her iPad off and curled up around it, as if it were a doll and she were a little girl…
She let go of one of Lestrade’s hands to rest it on her belly. The little boy growing inside  her kicked and kicked again, a series of flutters like the tiniest of birds.
Lugging a heavy rucksack full of surveillance equipment, Sally Donovan humped the burden up the flight of stairs that led to the backdoor. She punched in the after-hours security code and shoved the door open with her shoulder.
“Three…two… one!” and with that, Dupin slid the knife under the middle red wire and sliced cleanly through it. The clock immediately started flashing
Green walked around the table and slouched down at the head of the table. He pointed at Bevington then at a short, beefy man named Stirmon. “You two, find her. Drag her back by her hair if you have to,” he picked up his gavel. “The rest of you, out. Not you, Vibart.”
“We will have to tell him eventually,” Sherlock reluctantly told her. “But not now. It is imperative that John remains married to Mary, for Mary’s safety as well as ours. The knowledge of the double-hit would be the straw that breaks the camel’s back, I’m afraid.”
The bottoms of Harry’s feet were dirty, like she had been walking around barefoot all morning and hadn’t showered yet. She wore a velour tracksuit. Her body was contorted into parody of the yoga position “Child’s Pose.” But her wrists were cruelly bound together with some sort of silk scarf.
“Yeah, it was marvelous,” John now got up and started clearing the table, “Nothing like calling the wife of one of the most powerful men in England names.”
After Dandruff Boy had dragged Irene out, Jim turned to Sherlock. “I told you I’d burn the heart out of you, didn’t I?” He ticked them off on his fingers. “John, The Woman, The Other Woman. I’ve decided that Mrs. Hudson is rather useless so I’ll leave her be for now, but I might hook her up with some acid-laced weed. Just for a laugh, really. After that, I’ll leak to the press who Mrs. Watson really is. I don’t need Magnussen’s old connections to do that. Then, there’s the Lestrades to contend with. Mmm, I really do have some catching up to do with Molly Hooper. But first, I want to play a game, one last game, Sherlock.”
John scooted himself up, rubbing his left shoulder, which of course, decided to pulse with a repetitive dull ache.
“They’re not after me. They want me alive. Broken, but alive and in order to achieve that goal, they are pursuing the people closest to
Harry leaned back in her chair, arms crossed. “John Hamish Watson,” she proclaimed, knowing full well how much John loathed his middle name. “You are a fucking liar. You have no plans on retiring. You love the war. All of it. The blood, the trauma,
Also, so sorry for not responding to comments! But I do read them and appreciate every one of them. After posting tonight, I will be undergoing the always terrifying process of Switching Internet Providers. So you'll know I'm back online when I start responding to comments :^)
“Oh yes, we have a friend who is a detective-inspector. He called quite late last night. Apparently one of our neighbors reported a strange man entering our home. Dressed like a plumber,” she shook her head. “John told me to stay here. Apparently the place is a wreck,” and Mary even managed to produce tears. “I hope you don’t mind.”
“If?” Sherlock arched an eyebrow. “Please. Arthur Toller, failed actor, with a juvenile record of petty theft and arson along with court-ordered therapy sessions for pyromania and obsessive-compulsive disorder that had been buried, but not buried deep enough. There is no ‘if’ about it, John.” He nodded towards Lestrade. “Please express my gratitude to Sergeant MacDonald for her thorough research. I believe she would make a very good DI someday.”
“Tartarus,” John said promptly. Then suddenly he remembered being scolded by his father when he was either nine or ten years old. He hadn’t come immediately to the dinner table when his mother called. He hadn’t come when he was called because he had been reading one of Harry’s books in the lounge…
“Well, that is why everyone always assumed you were the woman in the relationship. Always wanting to discuss
“People don’t want my autograph, people want me to solve crimes,” Sherlock said haughtily before he could stop himself. Rucastle’s face darkened, knowing he had been in some way insulted but couldn’t suss out exactly how.
After Mary finished explaining exactly why she shot Sherlock, Violet had just sat stunned in the passenger seat of Mary’s car. “Jesus…” was all she had been able to manage. She blew out a long breath, her cheeks puffing out a bit as she did so. “Talk about a rock and a hard place.”
He didn’t bother to try to smuggle in any guns. It was ridiculously easy to purchase guns in the United States.
Plus, she really couldn’t blame him for wanting to stretch out. The train carriage they were in was not all that spacious. While she, John and Mary could sit in relative comfort, Sherlock would have had to have spent most of the trip with his knees to his ears.
Sherlock’s face softened and he uncharacteristically cupped John’s cheek. “Everything will be alright, John.”
He felt a small starburst of gratitude that not only was the house large enough to block the view of the boathouse from the garage, but there were also plenty of trees as well. If Sherlock couldn’t see John and Wiggins making their way up the trail to the house, then neither could anyone else… at least from the garage…
“You will not be asked to do anything distasteful. You will not be forced to do anything against your conscience. Now, if you wanted to climb the corporate ladder, if Mrs. Watson wishes to pick up her guns and her knives and her bombs again, or you would be comfortable treating some of our colleagues who were injured in the line of duty outside of regular surgery hours, then of course compensation would be re-negotiated, along with some additional perks, a nice cottage in the South of France for the holidays, perhaps.”
“I trust now the incorporation of the Devil’s Foot into the Sons of Anarchy will now go smoothly,” Sherlock hoped he sounded sensitive, or at the very least, not rude. It was more than obvious that these men still grieved for their brother…
“OH!” Sherlock gasped, as if he was taking that first sweet gasp of air after having been underwater for far too long. “Of course, of course. So
“He was angry at Mycroft, yes. Hated him, no,” Sherlock shook his head. “As far as he was concerned, Mycroft was still just as much his brother as I was. Remember, while both Mycroft and I worshipped Ford, I idolized him as a young child does a hero. To me, Ford was Superman, he was Luke Skywalker. But to Mycroft, Ford was more than a brother. He was his best friend, the only person he really trusted. Ford was the only person Mycroft had ever confided in. Ford convinced Mother and Father to send Mycroft to a proper school instead of teaching him at home. Ford encouraged Mycroft to get involved with public service; although I don’t think what Mycroft does now is what Ford originally had in mind. But Ford knew just how intelligent and cunning Mycroft was. He knew Mycroft would be good. Soon, Mycroft became invaluable. Eventually he became powerful.”
Violet had her head bowed. One hand was pressed to her forehead, the other to her stomach. Her face had turned as white as snow and her eyes were squeezed tightly shut.
“Of course. You’re murderous, devious and intelligent. John couldn’t have picked a bride who was more fun than you.”
“Yes, John. Do try to keep up,” Sherlock rolled his eyes again. Then with his hands clasped behind his back, he asked Dupin in a syrupy voice, “Did I miss anything?”
Mycroft’s nostrils flared. “He would never allow John to put that on the blog. He would never allow John to know about that. He needs to be perfect in John’s eyes.”
“Right, let’s get this over with,” Sherlock bent down to present his face but straightened up again when she drew close. “Not too deep, I don’t want scars.”
He was duly escorted into Mycroft’s private offices by Anthea. Both John and Anthea pretended not to know each other, as usual. Better that way, less awkward. John stared ahead while Anthea walked and texted.
After drinking his fill and having a cursory clean-up, he set the empty glass on the night table. He felt her eyes on his naked body as he got up to put the flannel in the hamper. He turned to repay the favor, to study her figure with the same unabashed admiration she often gave him when he was in some state of undress. But Violet had already gotten beneath the covers so he slipped under the sheets and duvet and stretched out an arm. Violet curled up next to him, her head nestled on his shoulder.
“John, I really think you should sit,” Sherlock tentatively put his fingers on John’s shoulder, studiously avoiding where he had been cut by the falling rocks.
So Mary and Violet started to tell John and Sherlock the good news when they finally arrived at the terrace house when it was nearly ten o’clock. But John, emotionally spent after the disastrous intervention with Harry, begged off. He pleaded with Mary and Violet to just tell Sherlock because he needed to go to bed. Then, without waiting to see if that was alright, he clipped Sweetie’s leash to his collar to take him out for a wee, then clomped upstairs without saying goodnight to anyone.
“Oh, I don’t give a rat’s arse about that little bastard my father got from Trixie Holiday,” Alice snapped coldly. “That tweaker’s brat can be a ward of the state for all I care.”
ever discovered Miss Hooper, apologies, Mrs. Lestrade’s role in Jim Moriarty’s downfall, her life would be at grave risk.”
Serena was the family doctor and The Family Doctor. Little did any of the diners below know, enjoying their fettuccini and their cannoli, that the storage room above the restaurant, where all the linens and paper goods were kept, had been turned into an impromptu hospital room.
On the other side, scholars have debated that "The Solitary Cyclist" has a non/con element to it: Violet Smith was routinely bullied and harassed by Mr. Woodley, or to quote: "He was a dreadful person - a bully to everyone else, but to me something infinitely worse... "  and (far more disturbing) "... when I would have nothing to do with him, he seized me in his arms one day after dinner - he was hideously strong - swore that he would not let me go until I had kissed him..."
But John saw what Sherlock had been watching before he thumbed over the screen, closing the app. “You came all the way up here so you could finish binge-watching
“The things I do for you,” he sighed melodramatically as he put the box of CDs back in its proper place. Violet watched while her eyes crinkled in amusement. He closed the box lid then crossed over to her, switching off the lights as he did so.
Violet pulled her mobile out of her black skinny jeans. Reading the text from Sherlock, she ordered Mary, “Put the gun down, Mary. We have to help him.”
“Not yet, no,” Dupin stood up. He held out a hand. “I have a PhD in psychology. I know the symptoms of a panic attack when I see one. Come. You don’t feel safe here. It is alright. Let me take you back to the hotel.”
“I don’t really know for sure, but they’re digging deep, Whitey and Sally. When I checked out Sally’s bedsit, I found all these files from last year about you and John and Violet and the clinic fire on March 11
John ended up asking the cabbie for suggestions. The cabbie took full advantage of the situation, driving them to a pub, far, far away from the church.
The Senator’s nephew, Special Agent-in-Charge Jonathan “Jack” Woodley, had betrayed his country by using the FBI’s VICAP computer system as a backdoor to hack into the Pentagon’s systems. He stole vital military secrets and sold them to America’s direst enemies. A computer analyst, Dorothy Sweeney, discovered the hack and reported the breach to her supervisor, Section Chief Robert Carson. Carson assigned Violet to investigate. Woodley killed every single member of her team, including Sweeney and Carson.
“Sherlock?” she shook her head, making her ponytail swish back and forth. “Do you think Greg and I are going to love him less because he might be a bit different?”
John threw the drink down his throat. Blindly he handed the empty glass back to Dupin then gripped the nasty sofa for dear life.
Anthea slipped out from underneath Mycroft’s arm and opened the car door for him. Mycroft paused, gripping the open car door for support. “I’m fine, don’t fuss,” he snapped at Anthea even though his face had turned grey from the exertion.
Sherlock continued to study the young man as he started fussing over the flowers in the centerpiece. His black shirtsleeve hitched up slightly as he reached to remove a wilting daisy.
“On this saggy old thing?” John stood up, stretching his arms out over his head. “I’ve kipped out on this particular sofa enough times to know that while it’s good for a nap, it’s murder on your back if you spend enough nights on it.” He held his hand out. “Your bed is closer and far more comfortable.”
“Uh, OK, but we don’t have cash registers. Everything has to be paid by either some sort of card or Apple pay. You’ll create a paper trail.”
“So, you can confirm that Jim Moriarty had a twin brother?” Violet sat up, taking notes for real now. The chatty, friendly tone evaporated immediately.

Wearing a black kimono-style dressing gown, he sat on a very tiny red footstool. The cheeks of his massive backside hung well over the seat as he draped gauzy yellow fabric over a mannequin. You didn’t have to be Sherlock Holmes to see that the desk and the bar were merely for decoration. The man’s true heart and soul rested in the drafting table, tucked in the corner of the room, overflowing with renderings, swatches of cloth and colored pencils. And in the bolts of cloth propped up against the other corner of the room, next to a sewing table, complete with a state-of-the-art sewing machine…
Too soon, at least as far as “the boys” were concerned, Archie’s mother had arrived to collect him. “He’s been doing really well,” she said, handing a cheque to Violet. “I am so glad Mary recommended you to us. He could barely read French a month or so ago.”
Marion shook her head. Mary began to wonder if it was a nervous tic. “I wouldn’t fit in. She probably hates me for not stopping Jimsie from throwing her out but he’s got a temper.” She gave Mary a tremulous smile. “One thing I did right was get life insurance. It ain’t much, but Susie’s the sole beneficiary,” she said the last word very slowly. Her smile grew bigger. “See? Told you I could speak nice if I had to, yeah?” She looked like a little girl looking for praise after reciting the ABCs correctly.
He reached for Sherlock, pulled him to him, carded his fingers through his hair then started kissing him fiercely, as if the world were ending tomorrow.
Jim swung his arm around, pointing the gun now at Molly instead of Mrs. Hooper. “We never were properly introduced, were we, Mrs. Hooper? I’m Jim from IT. Surely you’ve read Molly’s blogs? Molly and I had a bit of a fling a few years ago, back when her biggest worry was becoming a mad spinster with a cat. Fortunately for her, the noble DI Lestrade made an honest woman out of her. How is good old Toby, by the way?”
“But,” Violet smoothed the sleeve of his rumpled dressing gown. “We are going to catch Moriarty, whoever he is, whether or not someone assumed his name when he took over the RHL or if somehow ‘Richard Brook’ survived a self-inflicted gunshot to the head, we’re going to catch him. He’ll go to prison or get killed but we’ll get him and then we’ll be rid of him,” Violet proclaimed with a certainty she did not feel.
“Plus Sherlock will hog all the hot water if we let him,” John remembered. Suddenly the desire to be clean overwhelmed him. “Right, so, if you don’t mind…”
Everyone at school was so cheerful and boisterous. The lecture halls were crammed with eager, excited new students, chattering about this party or that football game. Even when the din died down and the professor started lecturing, there was still the swirling, choking odors of perfumes, soaps, cologne, body odor, cigarette smoke, fizzy drinks, coffee (and yes, sometimes even alcohol) to contend with.
As Edward continued to scream from within the wardrobe, Violet found the chapter that was titled in a huge, bold ominous font: PUNISHMENT.
Sherlock’s nostrils flared as she reached for a swath of filmy emerald material draped over the dainty chair in front of the vanity.
Mary nodded and slowly opened the massive door.  Violet crossed her wrists in classic, standard police procedure, gun in one hand, torch in other. She shone the light through the room, inching inside. She checked her blind spots, checked the room again. Then she announced in a normal voice, “Clear.”
Mary, hated her for shooting Sherlock. Or so he had claimed to Violet. “It wasn’t about anything personal,” John sought to reassure Mary. “But, it’s not great news. I mean, the timing’s awful, especially since we only just got back from James’ funeral and all.”
“The Letter?” Violet quirked up an eyebrow, upon hearing how two mundane words had become capitalized.
She pulled her lab coat back on and pushed through the morgue doors. As she made her way towards her little office, she surprised herself by yawning. She hadn’t expected to feel utterly exhausted. But it was a good tired, a fatigue brought on by a productive day at work.
She shook her head. “No, I just feel like shit. I’m tired and I’ve been outside for too long. I can’t get warm, it feels someone dumped a bucket of ice water on me.”
Mary had her nose buried in a pharmaceutical book and was munching ginger lemon tea biscuits when Sherlock threw open the front door. Mary nearly jumped out of her skin. She did knock over the forgotten cup of coffee sitting on the arm of the sofa, splashing cold coffee and congealed milk all over the rug.
“Are you sure I can’t bring you anything?” Toller asked, looking mournful and watery-eyed as usual. “Tea, perhaps?”
Lestrade exhaled, “Not just you. Glad you said it, ‘cause I was definitely thinking it.” He stuck his finger into Molly’s bowl and helped himself to more Chantilly cream and strawberry sauce, even though she playfully slapped his hand with her spoon. “It felt like they were faking it, the Happy Couple Bit, didn’t it?”
He looked up when he felt John touching the top of his head. “Lie down,” he ordered him with a predator’s smile, his voice a force of nature, voracious and dangerous.
“Like you’d go away if I told you no,” Sally turned her back to him, setting her water bottle down with a shaking hand. Trying to get her bearings, she demanded as she glared at him over her shoulder, “What do you want?”
“I don’t want a nanny, I’m too big for a nanny,” the boy whined loudly over the stringy woman’s complaints. “Why can’t I stay here? I can help.”
Violet finally caved. She needed food now as well as caffeine. “OK, but after we finish breakfast, I don’t want to go to a library.”
“Oh…” Rucastle looked at her, from head to toe, as if he just noticed her for the first time. “Well, well, well. You’ve been holding out on me,” he chuckled, pointing a chubby finger at her. “You
He was also an insatiable gossip. How Elizabeth was tolerating him was beyond Mycroft’s comprehension, but then, Lizzie always had appalling taste in men.
He took the steps up two at a time, glad to be out of the cellar. He glanced at the crumpled van, steam still leaking from the grill, both front tires blown out, the windscreen gone. The bonnet was completely crumpled up.
“Thank you,” Miss Smith took the glass and inhaled the rich aroma of citrus, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. She sipped and her taste buds rejoiced. It was the perfect combination of sweet, spicy and boozy. “Thank you for everything, truly. This has been such a welcome treat.”
The clubhouse was deserted now, except for him and Frankie. The younger guys had either found a broad to hook up with or gone out to raise a little hell elsewhere. Most of the older guys had gone home to their old ladies and kids.
. In fact, all the furniture looked to be mahogany and expensive, an eclectic mix of modern and antique. Leather-bound books adorned a gigantic bookcase. Velvet curtains, relics of another era, completely covered the windows. Not a sliver of natural light shone in. A massive oil painting of some obscure general resplendent in a plumed hat and red coat hung over the fireplace. But the fire in the hearth that kept the room nice and toasty was obviously a gas fireplace, once Violet studied the logs and saw that they neither crumbled nor smoked.
Mycroft added the sugar and cream to his tea, stirred, wondered how much more to tell John Watson. Lifted his head, studied him.
And he certainly couldn’t talk to any of his friends about his difficulties, because, well, he didn’t have any.
A ghost of an idea floated across John’s mind. He groped after it, knowing once he grabbed hold of it, he would realize what Sherlock had already deduced. “Persephone Studios.”
“Mm, message sent and received,” Violet murmured as he started running his hand over her hair over and over.
“No, Harry, don’t go, it’s not safe, that crook’s still out there.” John pleaded. “Mum’s sorry, aren’t you Mum?” He grabbed Anna’s wrist. “Mum, please,
“There is,” John thanked God for this perfect opening. “The girl I went to check on yesterday at 221B. She’s only fourteen years old and she has nowhere to go. She’s not Network material, she’s not. She’s bright but not brilliant and she’s sweet. Sherlock thought-”
“Here,” Lisbeth slipped in. In the weak, unnatural fluorescent light, she looked ghostly. “We’ve been looking, me and some of the other guys. We couldn’t find any other victims.”
“Mother and Father wouldn’t forgive me if I waste their money on schooling I don’t need. And will I really need a
“Mr. Rucastle asked us to keep you entertained,” Mary felt a cold finger running down from the nape of her neck all the way down her back as Gang He purred, “For just a little while longer.”
Violet stopped massaging his aching wrist and reached up to cup his face in her hand. He lowered his head, letting her card her fingers through his hair, still damp from his bath. Her other hand sought out his and once found, she linked her fingers through his.
Molly laughed, then asked softly while fidgeting with the sleeve of her dress, “He’s told you then?” Her cheeks started to turn crimson as well. “He said he would, but I wasn’t sure.”
Back in the fire house, as he was being tied up by Green, the driver asked in a high, reedy voice, “Where is the merchandise?”
“Absolutely not,” Sherlock smirked, imagining even suggesting a threesome to Violet. “She’s obstinately heterosexual and does not like sharing.”
After a moment’s pause, Sherlock stretched out onto the bed again. On top of the duvet, fingers steepled, eyes firmly fixated on the ceiling. Not an inch of him touched John’s body.
He helped the girl to her feet and watched her scoop up her meager belongings, which apparently were only her socks, shoes and a dirty knitted hat. “Call if you need anything,” John added as she disappeared down the hall.
Against his will, he conjured an image of Stephen Hawkins then tried to imagine Violet in the same condition…
“They probably cleaned it for the next occupant. It is a holiday flat, like you said,” John knew he sounded petulant, but he really didn’t care at this point. Too late, John realized he had been more enamored by the idea of an adventure than going on an actual adventure. In reality, he was cold, he was tired, he was hungry and he was still reeling from not just being nearly shot down over the English Channel but also being pushed up against the wall like… like… like
“That’s true,” Mycroft gruffly assented. “He can never resist a mystery. He’d seek you out someday just because he was
Then she watched him step closer to her. She didn’t resist when he plucked the hairbrush out of her hand. Or when he lightly clasped her shoulders and turned her towards him. She closed her eyes though when he placed his fingertips on her face, one finger running over the crescent moon scar on her cheekbone.
The best she could do was to pay off the people next to her to keep quiet, leave her alone and also to alert her if anyone shady was snooping around her room. She threatened the occupants of the room to her left with deportation if they talked about her or about the money she gave them. The occupant to her right was the wary man with the toddler. She threatened to call DHS, his scared face becoming more pinched, confirming her suspicion he had kidnapped the boy.
“You dirty bastard,” Chibs growled as Brother Morris walked over to a large laundry basket on wheels. “What are you people up to?”
He had though he had understood what John had gone through, watching him fall. Now, after seeing Violet literally teetering on the very precipice of life and death,
She toed the door open a bit wider and slipped through, wincing as the wooden step behind her foot creaked slightly. When Mrs. Hudson declined the straight razor, Evie had whispered asking if she could have it. Mary doubted the girl could actually kill anyone with it, much less nick an oncoming attacker. But if holding a weapon helped her stay calm, by all means, let her have it.
It was only then he realized he was crying for the loving brother who had abandoned him. And for the cold-hearted brother who stayed.
John fumbled with the key to the front door. His neighbors probably thought he was drunk, but he didn’t care.
“Sherlock, as delicious as this sponge is, I do have other tasks to attend to; I would appreciate it if you picked up from where you left off.”
“Mycroft,” Dupin grunted. “Apparently he is finally convinced that Sherlock is being a good boy who hasn’t left Baker Street. His flight to Switzerland has been confirmed.”
Sherlock’s eyes flew open. She had her hand outstretched. When he opened his mouth to protest, she said, “Please. Tristan Holloway’s bedroom in the London house was a damn pharmacy. I can only imagine what it was like at the Copper Beaches.” She beckoned with her fingers. “And you forgot to take your methadone yesterday.”
She shook her head.  “I’m not a star-struck fan-girl,” she quietly reminded him. “I know what the stakes are, what John Watson means to you plus with what happened to you as a boy…”
He closed his eyes, willed for the loo to stop whirling. When it did, he staggered back to the lounge, pulled on his coat, tied his new scarf around his neck and took the leash off the peg. “Stone,” he commanded.
John snuck a look at Sherlock. Just as he had been afraid of, Sherlock looked like a little boy who had been promised a very large shopping spree at a very large toy store.
Instead of weeping, he refused to leave her side. He let Violet draw his blood with her nails as she clung to his wrist.
“Oh, I have a plan for Mary as well. One that will keep her quite occupied and one you’ll even approve of, I think. I believe that my plan for Mary is what is considered a Win-Win.”
The minute Victor turned his back and was walking towards his car, Violet began texting John. She paused only to briefly snap a picture of Victor’s number plate as he drove away. Might be important, might be not. She wasn’t sure.
While she had lived in London, she had no known career path. During her Gap Year, she held a variety of occupations, but nothing glamorous. Shop girl, waitress and the like, according to the Inland Revenue records. Instead of departing for university, she had left for Paris (
But so did Violet. Sherlock reminded himself if he didn’t complete this chore tonight, if he didn’t find out exactly what MI-6 wanted from Violet, he would not be able to keep her safe for much longer either.
Rucastle seemed to be in no hurry to discuss Violet’s actual job duties or to ask her more questions. “Yes, Miss Smith,” he folded his hands over his enormous belly. “I do know about the subspecies known as the paparazzi. They’ve been a nightmare ever since… well, you see, I’m not sure if you recall, it’s been years ago, but I was married before.”
Sherlock watched the pool of blood create a ruby halo around Jim’s head, similar to the one that had flowed around Eduardo Lucas’ head.
Sherlock’s eyes flew open. She had her hand outstretched. When he opened his mouth to protest, she said “Please. Tristan Holloway’s bedroom in the London house was a damn pharmacy. I can only imagine what it was like at the Copper Beaches.” She beckoned with her fingers. “And you forgot to take your methadone yesterday.”
“Come off it. You’re not even going to see the inside of a courtroom… unless we need you to testify, of course.”
“You can be friends with her too. I think… I think she’d like that,” she wiggled her newly freed toes with absurd delight as the second boot went flying. Before the conversation grew sloppy, she added, “Anyway, you haven’t slept in two days and we’ve got another big day ahead of us. We’ve got the Sons to deal with tomorrow. Plus we need to go over the plans with her,” she gestured towards Violet with her hands, “About what happens after we get her out of Chicago.” She now gave him one of her rare crooked grins, “Go to bed, take the bedroom, the bed is big enough for two, but not three.”
He also confirmed with that bumbling oaf Lestrade that Sherlock indeed had been working on a case for one of his colleagues, a French police detective called François le Villard. An Englishwoman had been robbed while on holiday in Calais, blaming a refugee from the camps outside of Calais. Her soon-to-be-ex-husband, however, argued that the diamond necklace and tennis bracelet were never stolen. He claimed she was hiding the jewelry because she didn’t want to declare it on the divorce decree. The diamonds had belonged to his mother and he wanted them back, not to mention the jewelry was indeed worth thousands of pounds.
you this glorious day? I was curious,” Sherlock had said breezily, not giving Toller a chance to reply, “Did you have plans to go to town at all today? I was wondering if you could do me a favor…”
Lady Hilda rose, “Thank you for your time, but I must go,” she checked her expensive watch. “Tree will start to wonder where I am.”
marathon, made enjoyable by Sherlock mocking all the contestants, eviscerating them with a sneer or a wicked deduction so cruel it had to be true.
“Spin their break-up anyway you need to,” Marshall advised. “Your brother has a reputation for being a jack-ass and treating women like they’re beneath him. It wouldn’t be a stretch to let people believe that she dumped him.”
“What ‘side project’?” John demanded but when Mycroft only sipped his tea, he said, in irritation, “Well, I have a message for you too. Stop being a dick and unfreeze Violet’s bank accounts. She’s not going anywhere. She can’t, thanks to you.”
She had indeed met him in Australia of all places. They had both been eighteen. He had been hitchhiking through Australia for his Gap Year. She was doing missionary work for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, handing out tracts in Sydney.  She had appraised his dark brown hair and deeper brown eyes and alabaster skin and had smiled. Her smile had broadened when she’d heard his Welsh accent. He’d taken one look at her shiny blonde hair and big sky-blue eyes and tanned skin and was a goner.
it, John?” Sherlock shouted for the simple fact because he wanted to, he needed to let out the anger starting to build within him.
Bit by bit, as if recovering from the flu, Sherlock shakily rose from his chair. He followed Lestrade out, miserably aware that if it wasn’t Mycroft bailing him out then it was his parents.
So he wouldn’t catch his death of cold, he bought a tacky “L’Amor Paris!” sweatshirt from a news agent stand in the Jules Joffrin
She expected the rest of… wherever she was… to be as dark and gloomy. So she was surprised to find an utterly sleek and modern lounge at the end of the hall. Complete with gigantic windows looking over the dazzlingly bright city of London.
She had just switched it on when the front door banged open. “Oh, good,” Mrs. Hudson sighed. “The boys are home,” Mrs. Hudson always looked relieved when Sherlock and John returned to the flat, even if it was from somewhere as mundane as dinner at Angelo’s or an afternoon at John and Mary’s house.
Molly had whispered to Greg that holding Henry seemed to be the only thing tethering John to this world. “And he hasn’t said more than three words since he’s arrived,” she paced back and forth in the Ladies’, the only room where she could get any privacy in St. Bart’s, other than her tiny office, all the way down in the morgue.
Unwillingly Sherlock opened his eyes. He usually naturally woke up at ten, unless a case forced him to wake up at some unholy hour. The fact that he had overslept immediately put him in a foul mood. Despite the late hours he usually kept, he rarely enjoyed having a lie-in, especially when there was work to do.
While Violet still pretended not to know the truth, John didn’t have that luxury. The day Sherlock had gotten himself abducted; an old man with hair resembling a silvery lion’s mane came to John for a routine physical. Turned out, the old man had been stalking John for quite some time. Also turned out he was in league with Moriarty and his syndicate of consulting criminals.
Lying crosswise on Sherlock’s bed, he arched his back as Sherlock slowly peppering kisses across his chest, his throat, his face. Every kiss was differently from the last, a plan devised solely to torment and arouse him, licking here, nipping there. Some kisses promised to leave bruises while others were lighter than a butterfly.
, he bitterly thought because one of her symptoms just popped in his head. One of her most troubling and disquieting symptoms cropped up again…
“You know I can’t do that,” Violet gently admonished the boy. “Come now, what’s the matter? Why are you sad?”
“Absolutely not,” she wore a wicked smile now. “Just because we’re moving slow doesn’t mean I’m not going to enjoy the show.” When he shot her a baleful glare, she shrugged, “I’m traumatized. I’m not
“Ohhh…” Violet felt her face heat up. Then remembered Victor had said he had a wife and child… “Oh,” she said again, realizing Victor was his first
Michel, the abbey, to be precise,” she repeated after giving him the number to a prepaid mobile Sherlock currently carried. “Nine o’clock, tonight,” she added then produced a coy smile, “Don’t keep me waiting.”
Violet stared at Irene Adler incredulously as she set a neat little cup in front of her, filled with the steaming Cuban coffee she had gotten addicted to. “And he fell for it?”
“I got better,” Violet had said blithely, trying not to gag. Mrs. Toller’s perfume was as cloying as ever. “Anyway,” Violet held the list up again, “The shopping.”
“Oh God, no, please, turn that off, Mary’s obsessed. Been watching it for the past few days now,” John groaned as he hung up his parka.
“Yeah… I guess,” John sounded sheepish. “But that jibe Mycroft made at her expense? That crack about ‘planning a wedding’? What was he playing at?”
“Consequences,” Violet elongated the word out as if she were stretching taffy. “You enjoy throwing that word around, using it as a threat, but what about the consequences of your incredibly stupid decisions?”
“I should have stayed to help you find John,” she whispered back. Lifting her eyes up at him, she asked croakily. “Do you think it’s wrong, your deduction and John’s diagnosis?”
Violet felt the last of her strength ebbing fast. She rubbed her eyes with the heels of her hands. “There has got to be another way. Without killing your brother or taking your little boy away from his mother.”
“Sure you are,” Jack’s eyes twinkled as he opened John’s desk drawer; the one John had abruptly shut when Jack had walked in. Jack pulled out a half-eaten KitKat bar and an empty crisps bag. “I won’t tell Mum this time,” he grinned as John looked sheepish. “But no more snacking before meals, Mum works too hard for you to be turning your nose up at her cooking.”
As Irene settled herself on the rickety old wooden chair as if it were a golden throne, Violet stared at her, open-mouthed. Realizing she looked like an idiot, she decided to go for broke and sound like an idiot as well. “Wow.”
During Susan’s speech, Mary had grabbed two bowls out of the cupboards and started shelling the peas from the pods. When Susan finished talking, calmly she asked, “And?”
“For pity sake, Sherlock,” Mrs. Hudson moaned as she picked up the teapot. “You don’t need twenty laptops for research. Even I know how to use tabs.”
“You have no idea,” Jim groaned. “Right, so,” he looked first at Violet, lying in a crumpled heap on the floor then at Irene, still weaving on her feet. “Peters, clean that up,” Jim waved his hand at Violet like she was dog excrement. “And get rid of it.”
“Ears,” Lestrade huffed in disgust. “What’s next? Eyes? Organs? It’ll be Jack the Ripper all over again. People’ll panic.”
“Oh, don’t you think I would have already if I had the evidence?” Mycroft grimaced. “Yes, I can threaten and intimidate her, use my reputation as ‘The British Government’ as my dear little brother enjoys calling me. Alas, the man who gave Mary up to Magnussen was very inconveniently found with the same gunshot wound as my brother suffered, two days after Sherlock was shot. Magnussen is dead. Sherlock will not testify against her and John, as a spouse, cannot. You cannot provide evidence because that will compromise your ‘Miss Smith’ identity not to mention, put you back in the FBI and CIA’s sights should you go public as Agent Hunter. I doubt America would bother with an extradition order. They’d probably just send a sniper over and be done with it.” Mycroft stretched out his long legs and toed off his shoes. “And the good Doctor Watson destroyed the memory stick that connected Mary to all of Magnussen’s crimes. I am afraid that fear is the only leverage I have over Mrs. Watson. Fear and withholding her child and I don’t know how much longer I can keep Mrs. Watson afraid.”
Violet tugged on the sleeve of his Belstaff. “Let’s go home,” she whispered to Sherlock, fixing a baleful stare on Harry.
“Oh, and that little plush toy your mum got us. The teddy bear, it was white so I d-d-don’t think any cleaning crew could get the blood off it…” Molly dropped the liner and bucket. They fell to the floor with a clatter and Molly buried her face in her hands, sobbing.
“Join the club,” Violet said dryly as she reached for her coat. “When will you realize Sherlock isn’t your enemy?”
“Well, that’s… God, Sherlock. That’s… that’s great! You don’t have to depend on Mycroft anymore. That will be more than enough to help me pay for the lawyers to go through that damnable pre-nup.”
Interesting Fact: Molly and Maggie became friends shortly after I had returned from my  Great Hiatus. A Hiatus caused by Jim Moriarty.
“I think I’d rather dream about Afghanistan than Mycroft,” John snickered, then sobered. “But Mycroft didn’t deduce that Mary shot you. Magnussen told him.”
“Come with us,” Violet had said before she could help herself. “Back to London, you’re burning up from infection.  John can treat your back. He’ll keep his mouth shut.”
His words sat strangely in John’s chest. Unsettled, he spat at him, “Can’t always guarantee that, can you? Not when his colleague sends him off on a fool does errand, alone, know that his enemies are watching him?”
over and over on the doorframe. Finally Sherlock nodded and the two men walked out of the room. Since their mobiles still weren’t working, they couldn’t tell anyone to come fetch Julia. Neither man felt good about leaving her behind, but knew they didn’t have a choice either.
Slowly he made his way to the table were the prepaid was tucked into his jacket pocket. The redheaded bitch shacking up with William (…
Anthea hung her handbag on the hat-stand she had by her door and then nervously sank down on her sofa. Her flat was quite small. It didn’t have a proper kitchen or dining room. Just a lounge, a bedroom and a bath.
Violet did exactly what Sherlock told her. Yes, there would be pictures of the dress in the tabloids tomorrow… but her face stayed hidden. Even the one paparazzo that had waited by the front door and snapped a picture right in their faces didn’t get his money’s worth. Violet had ducked her head just in time. The only thing he got a snap of was red hair, big sunglasses and her chin.
Sherlock sat down again. “You know where to find me,” he said, pulling the cloth napkin over his lap again. Then he tented his fingers as he stared at Rucastle, thinking
“I’m picking him up at King’s Cross at noon,” Mr. Holmes paused at the top of the stairs. “Mike, listen, be nice to your brother this weekend, no listen to me now. I know you two like to take the piss out of each other. Your uncle Rudy and I did the same when we were young. But this is an important weekend for William-”
“Something will turn up,” Evie said. “Remember I was having a bit of a dry spell too then this came along,” her brown eyes glowed with pride as she held up a very battered playbook, with
“Well, we all know it was the Americans who were the ones who mistranslated our organization’s name. Since we’re in America and since they can’t get anything right, I thought I’d use their name for us instead.”
Allowing herself to taste hope the same way a chronic dieter allows herself to eat a tiny sliver of pie, she wired Wasp the money she owed her for the job. Then Violet emailed her another request to hack into MI-6 again, this time to obtain the records for the mission that had directly ended the life of one Marie Rogêt and inadvertently, had caused the death of Ford Holmes.
Before she had a chance to act, shadowy forces had already used her as a pawn in their ongoing chess game for power. An influential and corrupt Congressman informed an equally corrupt Deputy Director in the FBI that Violet and her team were traitors. The crooked Deputy Director Hammermill signed off on a secret order to “burn” Violet and her teammates while they were in England for a conference about international kidnappings.
“No,” Sherlock finally turned. “He’s not. He said to stop treating him like he’s broken. I didn’t treat him like he’s broken. I treated him like a man who made a very serious mistake.”
As Sherlock watched Violet press a still-shaking hand to her forehead, the mind-palace Molly snapped back at him, “You’re not telling her the full truth. That’s still lying. Sherlock,”
Violet scooped up her fake eyeglasses she had placed on the table next to Sherlock’s chair and jammed them on her face. She hastily bundled her hair up as she ran out the door. She tied the sash of the blue dressing gown around her slim waist as she hurried down the stairs, nearly tripping on the hem.
She wouldn’t have minded killing Woodhouse. She also wouldn’t have minded being accused of killing him… if she had actually killed him.
He then immediately thought of snow, rough, salty kisses and the shadow of Notre Dame. He ordered himself to focus. “As does my fiancée, although one would not believe it to look at her,” he added lightly. “Always a lady in public but if she stubs her toe in private, she could make Ozzy Osbourne blush.”
The cops had hustled him into a sterile room where two more unsmiling cops wearing latex gloves waited for him. He was frisked again, but he wasn’t fingerprinted or photographed and they didn’t make him strip. John thanked any and all Gods who may exist for that small mercy. But the unsmiling cops took his coat, his scarf, his watch, his mobile, his belt, his keys and his shoes. They gave him a pair of ugly canvas shoes that were too big and didn’t have any laces.
Sherlock bolted out of his seat. As his chair tipped over, Sherlock let loose a torrent of rapid-fire French while waving his arms in the air. Gagnon leapt to his feet as well, revealing that he was a big man in every sense, height, weight and voice. Gagnon apparently thought his very presence would intimidate Sherlock as he started shouting back at him. Sherlock, of course, was completely unfazed by the tall, corpulent and loud
“He does get royalties from the books he wrote, but it’s not enough to keep up with cost of living in Paris. His sister is using her inheritance to fix the house and then she’s going to sell it. Soon she won’t be able to pay me anymore. God I feel like such an asshole for saying this because I do look up to Dupin. He’s a freaking genius but, I can’t work for free either.”
” Dumbfounded, Lestrade could only stare at his wife. Then he whispered, “Are really you saying that he… that
John Ferrier started desperately looking on the Internet if there were support groups for parents who had children obsessed with the whiny, bald-headed animated brat. Remembering her days baby-sitting her younger siblings, Hope reasoned that Barney the Dinosaur had been far more obnoxious… at least that was what she told herself when Lucy wanted to watch the Caillou Goes to the Zoo episode… again… for the five-hundredth time.
Every time he tried to focus on pressing matters: the mole, Violet’s safety, John Watson’s wife and daughter, Moriarty, his mind stubbornly and resolutely circled back to Victor, Victor, Victor.
Unable to find the child, Heathcliff stomped back over to Mycroft, still on his back, still doing his sit-ups. Heathcliff delivered a stinging kick to Mycroft’s exposed ribs. Tears of pain sprang to Mycroft’s eyes as he rolled over to his side. Heathcliff was on the football team at school so his kicks were no joke. Mycroft knew he would have a wicked bruise in the morning.
She remembered how she started shaking when they reached the kitchen. Her mother had a bloody gash on her forehead, but it was the gun in her hand that scared her.
Mrs. Holmes completely ignored the joke. “I shudder to think what on earth he tells her about us. She probably hates us as much as he does.”
Sherlock Holmes could be accused of a great many sins and he would quite readily plead guilty to most of them. But he was definitely not guilty of greed or stinginess. Money to Sherlock was merely a tool to accomplish his goals. No more, no less.
Realization slapped Mycroft in the face. He dropped his tea cup. Tea spattered the turn-ups of his trousers, his socks and shoes.
“Your family has an irritating habit of rocking the boat,” Sherlock pointed out. “’The roads we walk have demons beneath and yours have been waiting for a very long time.’”
. That she is close to me, close enough to help fake my death. It’s common knowledge that she held quite the torch for me…”
“Very well,” He uncapped the vial. “Miss Smith, please be so kind as to bring the tin of coffee in here. Miss Tey will lose her ability to distinguish scents after two or three samples. Smelling coffee will cleanse her palate, so to speak.” As Violet got up to get the coffee, Sherlock looked at the young, frightened woman sitting in front of him. “Shall we begin?”
“How am I supposed to believe you when you won’t even tell us what the ruddy thing says!” John snapped then immediately turned to Bellinger and said “I’m so sorry, my apologies, sir,” with flushed cheeks, embarrassed he let his temper flare up in front of the Prime Minister.
“Miss Smith,” he said, solemn for once. Macpherson had replaced Philip Anderson after he had died, or more accurately, when Anderson’s family had finally decided it was more merciful to pull the plug instead of keeping him in a vegetative state.
“My brother, for all his protestations, is a dreary prude,” Sherlock reached for his tea. “If he had his way, he’d chemically castrate me. In his mind, because he does not know about any of my female partners, I am a virgin because the loss of virginity involves a male and female.”
Lestrade picked up her rucksack “I know he’s not my enemy,” he finally admitted with a nod. “But he’s not my friend either. No, listen,” Lestrade held her rucksack out to her when Violet opened her mouth to protest. “I just can’t afford to be his friend right now. I have a responsibility to Molly and Henry, especially Henry. He’s so small, so defenseless. After seeing what poor John and Mary are going through, knowing that little Maisie was actually kidnapped instead of…well…  and then almost coming so close to losing Henry, I…” his voice caught. “I could never forgive myself if something happened to him.” He took a breath then jammed his hands into his coat pockets. “Just like Sherlock would never forgive me for not taking care of you.” He opened the door and held it open for her. “Shall we? I’ll drive you. Spare you cab fare.”
, Violet grinned to herself. She let Edward have his ten minutes of free time before Violet said, “Alright, Eddie, shall we work on some maths?”
“Babies do that,” Violet leaned against him as she rested her hand on his shoulder. She reached out with her other hand, to stroke the baby’s chubby cheek with her forefinger. “Sweet boy,” she whispered.
The three of them turned and saw a short, stocky man with coppery skin wearing the dark blue scrubs of a surgeon. His hair was hidden by the surgical cap. The surgical mask dangled around his neck.
Violet clicked the safety on and lowered her weapon. “Maybe you should find a way to make it the last time you’re held at gunpoint.” She shook her head as she said in a low, pitying voice, “Fix this, Mary. Or else Mycroft will never let you or John or any children you have together live in peace. Don’t you get it? He won’t let you have Maisie until he knows Sherlock’s safe.”
Enraged now, she spat out, “I needed you to be there for our daughter! Where were you then?” Before John could answer, she accused him hotly: “If you hadn’t gone off with
“Yes, I do,” Sherlock knelt down and made quick work of the lock. He pushed the door open. Violet bolted to the door, but Sherlock grabbed her by the crook of her elbow. “We need to move quickly but cautiously. Mitton and the other test subjects may not be in their right minds when we find them.”
Lestrade tried to respond but only yawned hugely again. He gave them a half-hearted wave then slouched off, to battle the press.
As if he could read John’s thoughts (or more realistically, detected some small, involuntary motion from John that communicated his discomfort) Sherlock asked “Are you asking us to break into the Copper Beaches, Mrs. Fowler? We are detectives, not burglars.”
But then he felt a splash of cold water when he felt her hand tremble against his face as she pressed her palm against his face. Out of habit, he seized her hand to study the spasm.
Violet’s face had turned ashen but she managed to choke out, “Can you open it without activating the tracing program?”
Violet squawked. “Oh come on Mycroft! Haven’t I proven myself by now? After all the shit I’ve been through, after all the shit I’ve done for you? Besides,” she held up her wrist, showing him a dainty, golden wristwatch. “The GPS tracker is still in here. It’s not like you can’t find me. And you all know I’m too
Before the conservation could continue, his father called out, “Lettie, come here a moment, won’t you?”
For a moment it seemed like Mitton had forgotten how to breathe. Soon, but not soon enough, Mitton and Violet were using the yoga breathing technique of
“What?” John no longer felt electric. He felt very very cold, from head to toe, not just his insides.
Of course Sherlock knew how to drive and actually owned several vehicles of all different makes, models and conditions. He had them carefully concealed in various neighborhoods in London, near his bolt-holes, of course.
But his first boyfriend Victor had always gotten put out whenever Sherlock didn’t want to finish “the job properly”, as he had always sourly phrased it. So, to avoid an argument, Sherlock often just gave in. Even pretended he had enjoyed swallowing… until he realized that being guilt-tripped into a sexual act was just as immoral as being physically forced into one.
The girl, shivering in the blistering heat, let Mary help her to her  feet. “I dunno what happened,” she quavered. “I don’t know what I did
“Tell her we’re going to France to visit Dupin over the holidays,” Sherlock shouted as he stomped back to the kitchen, in a strop now.
Carefully, since his hands were so much larger than hers, he curled his pinkie around hers. She looked up at him just as he looked down at her. She smiled then rested her head lightly against his shoulder.
He now stood in front of Baker Street for the first time since last December, a shadow of himself. His hair had become more silver than sandy-blond and he had lost more weight than what was healthy for a man of his height. His appetite had flagged while he had been recovering, attributed to the depression as well as a possible side-effect of the anti-anxiety medication as his stomach was often upset. Eating was currently not as enjoyable as it used to be. He ate for fuel not pleasure now. He hoped that the less and less he took the drugs; the more and more of his old energy would come back. Lethargy was, after all, also a possible side-effect of the anti-anxiety medication.
Once Sandra departed, Mary sat back down again. “Greg will want to speak to you when you’re strong enough,” she told him. “Get your statement about your abduction.”
John slowly sat up, still dazed. He resisted the urge to reach down to check if his meat and two veg were still intact or if they had been completely smashed into bits. He took a long, deep breath before asking, “What?”
Thank you, everyone SO much for reading/commenting/bookmarking/kudo'ing! I've now lost track of how many times I've tried to write how much this means to me, only to hit backspace and start over. I am humbled and overwhelmed how many people have stuck with this series, despite the scary word counts.
Then they moved back to Salt Lake City to care for Hope’s ailing mother, as her father had already passed away. John never once complained. He had been the one who had said, “We need to go take care of your mum.”
As a Boeing 747 roared above them, coming in for its final decent, Violet begged over the racket, “Five more minutes…”
Mary bridled at the ‘just a nurse’ comment. She took massive pride in her work. It made her happy to save lives instead of taking them.
Mycroft’s nostrils flared. “That the MI-6 mole lifted top secret information and that information is currently in Paris.”
“His daughter…” Violet finished weakly, in the King’s English. But she switched back to Russian. “Alright, I’ll help you. I’ll interrogate her. But we do this my way and you tell your husband the truth. Not only does Sherlock know, but so does John.”
Violet let a little smile of victory turn up her pale lips. She turned the tap off and picked up the damp flannel. She started dabbing at the angry wounds on his face, her touch feather-light. She cradled the back of his head with her free hand, her fingers entwined with his curls. To her surprise, Sherlock closed his eyes and allowed her to coddle him. He might have even fallen asleep if she hadn’t warned him “This is going to sting a bit.”
“Figuring out how to stop the double-hit,” Violet rubbed her hand with her forehead. “OK, OK, I get it. Let sleeping dogs lie.”
“Perfume index, yes, of course,” Sherlock leapt out of his chair and practically skipped down the hallway to his bedroom.
“Oh, is the stress of the job getting to you then?” Sherlock put his hands behind his back, looking innocently inquisitive.
She looked terrible. Her face was chalk-white except for the flesh-coloured bandages on the left side of her face and forehead.
“Shit,” her heart pounded as she looked up. Then she looked at the black cab again, even though she had just confirmed it was empty. “Shit, shit,
“Fuck,” John thudded the back of his head against the stall wall. Then he repeated the motion and the swearing: “Fuck, fuck, fuck,
Sherlock paid for both their admissions without John even asking. He also bought John a cup of steaming hot coffee, milk no sugar. “Don’t want to listen to you grouse about being cold,” he explained tartly when John tried to thank him.
Blindly, she weaved through the house, looking for the staircase. She paused, gripping the banister, trying to catch her breath. Gladstone whined and pressed his muzzle into her thigh.
“How did you know that I got you… oh never mind. Yes, of course I did.” John sighed. “I even sprang for a new tin of rosin for your bow as well.”
“Oh my God!” Violet dropped her package in shock then shouted at the sales clerk. “Don’t just stand there! Call 999! A woman’s been stabbed!”
She wanted to run, run down the spiral stairs, away from Julia, away from Moriarty, run back to 221B and… then what? Wait for Mycroft to make another impossible request of her while sending Sherlock on another suicide mission?
Sally nodded frantically again as John sighed resignedly before turning to harangue the vicar, who had been watching the entire thing with his mouth hanging open. “Don’t just stand there. The paramedics will be here any moment. Wait outside for them then show them where to go.”
“No. Not obvious at all. And it’s alright, truly. It’s a good thing.” When Sherlock continued to furrow his brows as he studied John, he finally rolled his eyes and managed to sound like himself for the first time in ages: “You know me. Deduce me and tell me if I’m lying.” He shifted in his bed, realizing he was about to succumb to the worst case of epididymal hypertension since he was a young man denied after a heavy snog session.
Sherlock plucked the mobile from out of John’s fingers. Hit Mary’s contact information and hit Dial. “Hello Mary, what seems to be the trou…” he trailed off. Soon he was pacing. When John opened his mouth to ask a question, Sherlock silenced him with a raised finger. “We’ll be there in forty-five minutes… maybe an hour, depending on traffic. Yes, we’ll both be there. Do not touch anything else. Do not answer the door or phone for anyone other than us. Keep Susan out of the kitchen.” He rang off then said quietly to John, “Get dressed.”
, red dog, all gambling games gave him a small rush. A rush similar to (but not quite the same as)  being elbows deep in a complicated operation or working a particularly baffling case with Sherlock. It was like a hard core heroin addict getting a slight buzz off of a cigarette. It wasn’t the same, but it wasn’t nothing either.
Watson. As if your pretty, blond wife would actually be happy living in that grotty little cottage we called home as kids.” Finally noticing Mary, she purred, “Funny, you’re not as pretty as some of Johnny’s other lovers.”
Sherlock muttered something in French that caused Gagnon’s face to turn brick-red. Just as Gagnon opened his mouth (presumably to start shouting again), John quickly said, “Alright, we understand, we understand completely, but ah, should we find anything, do we contact you?”
“Wanted to give you an update on the Cardboard Box case since Sherlock’s not picking up. He’s probably sleeping, poor man.”
Sherlock gracefully broke the embrace and somehow slithered his way around John to lean against the wall beside him, his arm pressing companionably against John’s shoulder.  Both of them continued to giggle but eventually the laughing fit passed. John looked up and saw a patch of impossibly blue sky peeking through a gap of dense, grey clouds.
This kiss was one of the best kisses, like a Sunday drive. Long and meandering, with no particular destination, just enjoying the ride.
… shortly after William started therapy. The therapy that there were absolutely no written records about. That started up after that mysterious fire at the family estate. Which coincidentally occurred at approximately the same time the Earl, known as Master Heath back then, had been in a dreadful “car wreck”.
. Even relied on her own muscle memory and made the same keystrokes under the table on her thigh. Just to confirm she really wasn’t seeing things, that she wasn’t losing her mind.
And Sherlock got to play with John’s hair and touch his fascinating gunshot scar to his heart’s content. John lay on his belly with one arm draped across Sherlock’s chest. Like a blind man reading Braille, he dragged his fingers across the scar tissue, trying to glean as much information as he could from the bumps and ridges.
Meanwhile, still in his “office” overlooking the Thames, Mycroft glowered at the glowing screen of his mobile. “Damn her,” he growled as he punched another speed-dial number.
when he went home with Victor for Easter instead of spending the holiday with us, like he had in the past. They thought they had the house to themselves, which they did. What neither of them anticipated was that Victor’s father had forgotten his wallet. He had found the boys in a rather… compromising position.”
“Seriously? You’re going to make me explain this?” Violet covered her face with her hands, feeling her face heat up as Sherlock continued to look confounded. She forgot how naïve he could be sometimes due to his lack of… experience. Healthy, natural experience in…
He did love working in the laboratories though. At least, it was quiet in there as well as in the library.  The lab, the library and the river became his refuges away from a world that was too noisy, too bright and too harsh.
“No,” John felt his nerves steadying, felt his sense of humor slowly creeping back into him. “I would like to watch him torment them for a while.”
“He was not permanently damaged, he only had to stay in bed for a week,” Sherlock said dispassionately. “Mother and Father sent Ford away. They had only meant for Ford to stay away for a night or two, just so he would cool down and not try and beat the hell out of Mycroft again. But he stayed away for nearly a fortnight. No one knew where he had been. We later found out he had dropped out of  university and joined the military. When he had leave, the only person he would visit was me. He only stayed for a few days then disappeared again. His visits were utterly unpredictable and he still refused to see anyone other than me. The last time he came to visit was shortly before we permanently moved to London. He came specifically to give me a gift and to say goodbye. I never saw him again.”
“Along with the Tollers and Miss Smith, we have a maid that comes in the morning to tidy up, and a chef and his assistant come to cook lunch and supper. Breakfast you will all be on your own, I’m afraid. I like to have a lie-in on holiday. But please, help yourself,” he said, trying to sound generous. “There’s plenty.”
. I’m not. I’m not broken. I’m beat up a bit, yeah. My head’s not right at the moment. But I’m alright here,” he pressed his hand against his chest. “OK? I’m alright
“Two sugars and a splash of milk,” she told Mrs. Hudson, holding the mug out to her. “Please, have a seat,” she gestured towards John and Sherlock’s chairs.
“Obvio-,” Sherlock started to say but Violet kicked him under the table again. “OW, I mean, of course. How rude,” he glared at Violet.
Violet allowed him to assist her. Once her feet were on the ground, she looked up and saw a very familiar, very handsome dark-skinned face.
“How many did Doña Nalda give you?” Sherlock’s voice was nonjudgmental but it was also a bit on the cool side as well.
As the agent scurried out, Sherlock put his hands behind his back, and strolled right up to the two-way glass. Just then, Julia rolled her head over, facing him, as if she could see him instead of her own reflection.
“Violet,” Mycroft spluttered. “I am not going to… I can’t…” He took another drag to steady himself. “The reason why I have been so successful is because of my reputation, despite Sherlock’s best intentions to drag me down. People actually believe I hold a minor position in the British government. My job depends on my plausible deniability.”
But it did the trick. He had turned his watery eyes onto Mary and asked “What did you have in mind? For my trouble?”
He shrugged. “Not really. You just never observed it before. I always believed it was an idiotic old wives’ tale about bones and joints aching when the weather changes. But ever since I broke it, it plays up whenever it becomes damp and cold.”
“I’m quite sure I don’t know what you are talking about,” Mycroft sneered in his most supercilious voice.
“Wonderful,” John groaned as Sherlock tossed his coffee into the nearest bin. John took a swallow of his, grimaced after burning his tongue then threw his cup away as well.
“I don’t know what you are talking about,” Maggie took a step back from Mary, her back slamming against the lift wall.
“Yes, of course. And I believe I have told you to call me Jepthro. Toller, bring the bags to our guests’ rooms. Mrs. Toller, take the dog to the kennel after you bring my wife back to her room .She’s not well,” He said apologetically to his guests.
Sherlock waited for Mary to finish helping John hobble out of the bathroom. Only then did he unwind his leg from around Violet’s waist and rise to his feet. Then he bent down again effortlessly scooped Violet into his arms.
But “thank you” was all John had, so he uttered the completely inadequate words then added, “We better get in there, before His Majesty sends Molly to fetch us.”
The second the shooting stopped, Sherlock darted out of the house again and sprinted towards the car. He nearly made it too, his fingers scraped against the door handle as the Audi peeled away. The only thing he could do was memorize the make, model and plate numbers as it disappeared down the darkened drive.
In the beginning, John took Sherlock at his word. At the time, John still thought Sherlock was some sort of madman or at the very least, somewhere on the autism spectrum. As time went on and as Sherlock taught John to become more observant, John realized that many of these kids were runaways, escaping abusive situations. Some of those situations were in the very foster homes they had been sent to after being removed from abusive parents. So calling social services sometimes was not in the kid’s best interest. John would patch the kid up, Mrs. Hudson would feed him up and Sherlock would find a safe place for the kid to stay. Sometimes the runaways would end up in a bedsit with other members of the Homeless Network. Sometimes the runaways would end up in hospital or rehab.
Besides, he memorized all of John’s phone numbers, his mobile, the burner he gave him, his work number, and Mary’s cell phone along with many other important telephone numbers and email addresses long ago. It wouldn’t be difficult to input all that information into a new mobile, just terribly tedious and time-consuming and boring.
Five minutes later, the black town car pulled up in front of his parents’ house. Mycroft was in the process of pulling his packet of cigarettes out of his inner coat pocket when Anthea rang him. “Yes?”
“Is…” Josie wetted her lips. Then she looked up, tried to see if the Great Consulting Detective was watching from the windows. “Is the doctor here too? Will I be able to talk to him? I…I’d much rather talk to the doctor, please. I can wait if he’s having a lie-in.”
she thought as she drove away from the wreck. Probably worse… they would want to tie up the last string. Eliminate the last threat to their interests.
Bill started shaking his head back and forth. “I dunno, mate. I mean, I look like a fool. I’m the bleeding silk purse made from a sow’s ear.”
Sherlock held out his hand, splaying his fingers wide. She placed a simple gold ring in the middle of his palm. He sniffed, “What? Will this turn me invisible?”
“Mycroft’s arrogant. He thinks he’s above everyone else because of his staggering intellect. He considers normal people little better than goldfish. He thinks we wouldn’t be
John leaned back in his chair and laced his fingers over his belly. The song started off slow, alternating between Sherlock teasing the strings with his bow with long slides and plucking the strings with his nimble fingers, the music soft and haunting. The tempo gradually increased, became a true waltz. John found himself bobbing his head along with the tune, smiling a little, remembering his failed dance lessons with Sherlock as he had tried to teach John to waltz.
Opening his eyes, he tucked both bottles of water under his arm and went to pull the other lounge chair next to hers.
“John, relax, he’s fine. They slapped him around a bit, no worse than they did you. Besides, I think everyone fantasizes about punching him in the face at least once or twice.”
But Molly was already on her feet, stretching her back. “I’d prefer we not burn the flat down before we sell it. Just get the DVD ready.”
Then, with a low swooping sick feeling in his belly, he remembered visiting Molly in the maternity ward last October...
“It was only a small explosion,” Rat Boy sucked down a large slurp of iced coffee. When Sherlock, Violet and Lisbeth glowered at him, he amended his statement. “Small-ish, maybe medium-sized, big enough to start a fire but not enough to level the joint.”
“Oh my God,” Violet started to press her palm to her forehead but stopped when she remembered her hands were still bleeding.
A chess variant (or unorthodox chess) is a game "related to, derived from or inspired by chess". The difference from chess might include one or more of the following:
He felt like he had dodged a bullet. He had worried what would happen if Violet had started pressing to escalate the snogging to shagging. Humiliation and annoyance battled within him. Annoyance because he had allowed himself to become distracted, to choose kissing over working… humiliation because he really couldn’t keep his transport under control after all, that he was just as mortal and banal as any other man.
“No, thank you,” Mycroft said crisply. Once the liveried young man had bowed and backed out of the room, Mycroft leaned back in his comfortable leather chair and breathed in the tea. Delicate scents of citrus and jasmine wafted up into his nostrils, with undertones of ginger and lemongrass. Delightful. He had been looking forward to trying this tea for months now.
Sergeant Alex MacDonald gave John the run-down, in her usual sparse manner in an alley between two less popular West End theatres while Sherlock stood on his tiptoes to gaze into the giant rubbish bin.
“Only seven,” Dupin set Lili and Bon-bon on the sofa. Now inside, John could see that the sofa had been made up into a bed. Bon-bon made herself cozy on the pillow while Lili leapt off the sofa and promptly scurried underneath it.
“Yeah, arsehole,” Chibs grunted as he and Green lifted Latimer to his feet. While Trager came and slapped a large gray square of duct tape over Latimer’s mouth, Chibs explained, “Your friend the driver explained it all to us. See, they mixed up the deliveries. We were expecting packages as well, which is usually what you get at the 4:30 delivery. However, there’s a midnight delivery, isn’t there?”
“Five,” Sherlock added as his lips quirked up. “You forget. I’m also married. My wife will insist on having a say. She’s quite irritating in that aspect.”
Mean, I know, but sadly Real Life is kidnapping me once again! But I'm going to be polishing up the last three chapters and cadogan is kicking ass and taking names while beta'ing so more story to come soon.
“Yes, I’m sure it’s just a misunderstanding. Unfortunately, what the authorities thought she had said, well, it wasn’t taken very kindly and she has been taken in, just for questioning, to assuage the concerns of the local politicians that she is in fact, loyal to her country. Hopefully, she won’t require very much persuasion to pledge her loyalty.”
John wondered if it had been Sherlock’s, then dismissed the thought. Sherlock wouldn’t be caught dead in a sweatshirt.
Again, thanks to my beta'ers cadogan who fixes my rotten grammar and Lucanael who fixes my rotten French.
“Why in the crib?” John asked despite himself. He found himself remembering doing a standard physical for an older gentleman, a jovial man in his mid to late sixties. A man with the face and hair of an old lion and a kindly smile… who had calmly informed John about how much he had admired him instead of the Great Consulting Detective… and that they were holding the Great Consulting Detective prisoner…
Guilt ate Victor alive but he just couldn’t deal with Sherlock sober right now. He needed Sherlock to turn his massive brain off, just for a bit. Or at least slow it down a little, enough for Victor to make his case without Sherlock poking holes in his defense.
Mary wore her long red coat, jeans and white trainers. She carried three bouquets as well, a mixture of springtime blooms, all bright, cheerful colours.
Clarissa sucked in a shuddery breath. “You should go,” she whispered, unable to stop the tears now. “Just please, tell my husband and my boys I loved them with all my heart.”
“Oooh I would hate to think what Sherlock would do to a litter of kittens,” Mary slid over on the seat as John climbed out.
Brother Morris watched in horror as the man who had been guarding Chibs before Sherlock dragged him to the floor grabbed his gut in horror, groaning and falling to his knees as blood dribbled out of his mouth.
After feeding Gladstone his supper then eating a meager dinner of chicken broth and toast, she had retrieved her files from their hiding spot downstairs and brought them back up to 221B.
“Had,” Sherlock purred. “He also had no heirs. Currently Denmark and England are squabbling over the legacy. Apparently Magnussen didn’t like to pay taxes to either country.”
“You know, if you’re going to commit murder, you really should not return to the scene of the crime,” she said helpfully.
Doyle, A. C., & Morley, C. (1930). The Valley of Fear. The complete Sherlock Holmes. Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday & Co
is highly improbable. You didn’t want him to see you at your weakest.” Silkily, he added, “You hate it when John sees you as less than the
He had even given Sweetie a bath. The dog had loved it. So much that the poor beastie tried to crawl in with John later when he decided a good long soak would be marvelous.
Molly’s face scrunched up, “Oh that’s a small space with the pram and everything. How about we meet you two near the Coffee & Muffins?”
The house felt empty but of course it wasn’t. The two hounds, the sleek former police dog and the pudgy, ugly ex-bait dog, snored on the sofa. John sighed, remembering how both he and Mary had declared no canines would be allowed on the furniture.
She looked over her shoulder and lifted her eyebrows. Archly, she informed Grouchy Nurse, “My name is Violet Emilie Laura Smith. I was born in Charlington. I was an office manager and personal assistant at an insurance agency. Now I assist Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson investigating criminal cases the police can’t solve. My date of birth is the fifth of August 1978. My parents are deceased. I have no siblings. I reside at 221B Baker Street. I am engaged to William Sherlock Scott Holmes, brother of Mycroft Holmes. And if I’m a bit unsteady on my feet it’s because I was in a bloody explosion!”
“About as much as you trust me,” Violet reminded him. “And you forget, I’ve read your FBI jacket. I am fully aware of what you like to do to women and little children. Lose the gun and the knife,” she commanded.
“Uhhh…” Violet squeezed her eyes shut and bit her lip, even though she knew he hated it when she did that. “He said… he needed me to spy on you one last time. He said he needed to get as much intel on you as possible, he wanted to get to know you…” she shuddered. “Intimately.”
“Despite rumors to the contrary, Sherlock Holmes is still a mortal man,” the old lion explained, this time impatience tinting his words. “Like all mortal men, he has a breaking point. This case merely pushed him closer to that point.”
“Oh God, yes,” John groaned. “If one more tosser tells me how well I’m doing, I’m going to punch someone.”
"Oh how could she spring something like this upon me!” Molly buried her face in her hands. “I could just murder her. Surprising me with company on such short notice; my flat is a complete disaster and I’m so moody I’m afraid I’ll either burst into tears or hit someone over the head with the kettle...”
“Is Sherlock still in barney with MI-6?” Mitton answered her question before she even got it out. (That was beginning to annoy her, but she held her tongue.) “It’s not MI-6. Hell, all the intelligence divisions were practically dancing in the aisles when they heard Magnussen bit it. It’s Mycroft. He
He saw sunlight streaming in through the window blinds. He saw a television mounted on the wall, a muted re-run of
“Yeah, yeah, OK. I get it, I get it. You need to find out if somebody saw whoever took your baby. A witness. But Jesus, shouldn’t you be asking Shezza to do this?”
Then she smiled, small crinkles fanning out around those bright, intelligent eyes. She nipped at his thumb, her eyes sparkling with wicked delight now.
Knowing she must look like a fright, Mary attempted to smooth down her fly-away hair. She jerked John’s oatmeal jumper down over her tummy and adjusted her scarf. After taking a deep breath, she poked her head through the half-opened door to see Molly Hooper-Lestrade holding a pink plastic cup up to Mrs. Hudson’s lips so she could drink from the matching straw.
The anger broke when she had rounded the building, to the alley, where Mrs. Hudson kept her skip and where Violet hid her motorcycle.
“She likes going shopping. She likes concerts and plays, huge theatrical productions, heavy on spectacle, light on plot. If you can hurry and get to the West End, you can probably get in queue for matinee tickets. Then you won’t have to talk to her for hours.”
Now both Mycroft’s eyebrows shot up. “I see,” he steepled his fingertips in unconscious imitation of his younger brother. “And what, precisely, are you offering me?”
“What?” Now Anthea lost control and balled her hands into fists. Her face mulish, she snapped, “Uncle Myc, how can th-”
“She was only six, seven weeks early, Maggie,” the second woman insisted. “Babies born earlier than that have lived and grown up to lead perfectly normal lives.”
“No, let’s not,” Violet‘s hackles immediately rose, still angry about how Trager handled Mitton’s hysteria. “You were knocked you out with a fist.”
“We could have helped her,” Sally stubbornly persisted. “Mary and Janine and God knows how many other victims that might be out there. DNA results would have nailed him to the wall.”
Sherlock had instantly disliked the diminutive “Maisie” and had planned on calling her Marissa despite what her parents and whoever else called her…
“No, don’t! My dog, he’ll rip you apart, no lie,” Violet shuddered, not fancying the idea of finding bits and pieces of Billy all over 221B. “Damn, I’m engaged all day. Sherlock’s mother is in town.”
for some absurd reason…) had spent the night at 221B Baker Street. She had no other clothes other than what was in the two bags she managed to grab before her flat blew up. So she borrowed one of Sherlock’s huge t-shirts as pyjamas that night. She happened to be only wearing only the t-shirt when Mrs. Hudson walked in. Mrs. Hudson took one look at Violet’s bare legs and bed head and jumped to the utterly incorrect conclusion.
Still, she wished Dr. Sankaran had ordered her something a bit stronger than prescription-strength ibuprofen.
“Oh yes, terrible business,” Bodley shook his head. “She was crossing the streets and a Range Rover ran a red light. Never slowed down, just kept on driving. Pulverized her, poor girl.”
“Oh, so ruling out all the non-speaking English countries that only leaves Ireland, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and America,” John said bitterly.  “Great. No problem.”
As the tango reverberated throughout the flat, Violet opened the cupboard and started taking Sherlock’s tea service out, cup by cup. “If you could switch the kettle on, that would be great.”
John wasn’t quite used to MacDonald’s quiet ways yet. He often found himself waiting for her to say more. While her silences could be unsettling, it was still loads better than Donovan’s nasty retorts or Anderson’s (
“They? You mean Sherly and John?” When Sally nodded, Janine squeaked, “You think otherwise then, yeah?”
Gladstone was stretched out on the foot of the bed. Violet was curled up on her side on the left, her back facing the door.
Meanwhile, as Jack made his way downstairs, he felt himself filling up on good intentions and resolutions.
“We’ve got your back,” John now pulled the night-vision goggles properly over his eyes. What was once black turned into a ghostly-green. He held his gun with both hands, finger on the trigger. He was taking no chances. “It’s OK, son.” He nodded Honoré, who positively vibrated with nervousness. “We know what we’re doing. You know where you’re going. Lead on.”
expression on his face, John wanted to take him into his arms again and never let go. “You completely ruined that for me.”
He didn’t bother disclosing that the reason  he was put on written warning was because he had hurled misogynistic and homophobic slurs at Sergeant Alex MacDonald after she took the initiative to continue surveillance on Jepthro Rucastle after Mason had thrown her off the case. She had also requested search warrants  for the escort service Westaways Cortege and Rucastle’s business offices at Persephone Ltd, based off an “anonymous tip.” On top of Alex filing a complaint against Mason for his chauvinistic behavior, Lestrade also reported his concerns about Mason’s fitness for duty to their superior officers. Prior to the Burned Girls case, Mason had also bollocked up two major homicide cases as well.
Took another cleansing breath and then scooted herself into the far corner of the boot as her snagged skirt would allow and curled up into a tight little ball. If they had a gun, the only thing they’d be able to aim at, was her ass.
John knew what he wanted to do, what he would have done in other situations…but those other situations involved women.
“Yeah, I did mean it. I do mean it,” John felt his heart starting to speed up as again the same refrain starting repeating in his head
Donovan also smelt a rat when Moriarty roared back to life, in a digital format at any rate. She had believed it was all some sort of trick, one giant deception, somehow. Just as she sensed there was something fishy going on with Magnussen’s death as well but couldn’t put her finger on it… at least, not then.
Something nibbled at his brain, but for the life of him, he couldn’t figure out what exactly. But he definitely had the feeling both he and Sherlock were missing something huge… “MI-6 has no idea who this Sara Whatever is?”
“I’m in pursuit,” she announced as she swung a leg over the motorcycle. “I’m eastbound on Oxford,” she told Mycroft as she safetied the gun and tucked it back into the waistband of her jeans. Then she was off like a shot, her black coat flapping behind her like a cape.
Alex certainly didn’t question it. She did lift an eyebrow when the female officer who drove Violet opened the backdoor and Gladstone sat up then jumped out. Violet quickly snatched up the leash and tugged, signaling to Gladstone to stay close to her.
” John couldn’t help himself as Sherlock dropped down to his hands and knees and started crawling around on the floor, looking for a keyhole.
William nodded against Mycroft’s neck. “At the dinner table tonight, he sat next to me and…” a sob choked him and he couldn’t continue. He tightened his grip around Mycroft’s neck again.
? The old American TV show? Never mind,” Seb sighed as Sherlock continued to stare at him uncomprehendingly. “I think you two should get to know each other,” he shouted over the blaring music as he pushed Laverne towards Sherlock.
He felt his mobile vibrating in his trouser pocket. He plucked it out and read the text he received from Lestrade. He stopped dead in his tracks, right in the middle of the pavement. “What… I can’t… that… that…
Rucastle took it and wrung it furiously. “The Great Consulting Detective, I know who you are, a most fascinating man, you are. I’ve been dying to meet you, but didn’t know how to ask Miss Smith to arrange a meet-up without sounding rude. And here you are. What a magnificent day it is! Mrs. Toller, can you arrange for some cake or something? No, scratch that. It is Miss Smith’s birthday, you’ll want to spend it with Mr. Holmes, I warrant,” he winked roguishly at her.
“Trust me, the world can’t handle two Sherlock Holmeses,” Violet quickly interjected as John’s head bobbed down then jerked back up again.
“Because he’s your pressure point,” Violet reminded him. “If he falls, you fall. I don’t think I was supposed to survive that bombing, I think something went wrong. But they made sure they made no mistakes with Harry. And if they tagged Harry that means…”
“Eddie, we talked about this as well. When you get bigger, you can have a bigger dog. Right now you are small, so you will have a smaller dog.” Rucastle ruffled the boy’s hair, as if he was behaving beautifully and not at all like a spoiled little brat. “Now, don’t you want to say hello to Miss Smith? You’ll be spending lots of time with her this summer.”
“’K, just checking,” he stood and watched for a few more seconds as Violet continued to swing at Sherlock. When he finally captured her wrists, she kicked him in the shin.
Violet gave up. “I think we can knock off a bit early today,” she said. “You worked really hard today, Archie. I’m very pleased with your progress.”
Gang He turned to Sherlock, Mary and Violet. “Ladies first,” he didn’t bother to hide the mockery from his voice. He even bowed slightly.
Then light flooded the hallway to the cellar. “You’re welcome,” Sherlock called down the hallway as he proceeded towards the pool.
The chat started innocently enough, both of them sticking to safe and banal topics. Then they started reminiscing on old cases and the utterly insane adventures they had experienced together. Then they started discussing the events of 2015, touching lightly on the more sensitive topics, such as Greg and Molly’s wedding and the birth of Henry Lestrade. But John veered away from topics sensitive to him, mainly his dwindling family. Sherlock allowed that deviation for now. He allowed John to digress to the topic of Violet Hunter, or as he had called her in his blog “a beautiful intruder.” Sherlock had rolled his eyes and berated John about his love for purple prose.
“Right,” John carefully kept his voice bland and clinical, like he did while responding to patients listing their symptoms. Once they reached the top of the landing, John asked “Do we know the name the flat was rented under? When the letter was first found?” as Sherlock tried the glossy black door, only to find it locked.
Donovan switched on her desk lamp, unzipped her rucksack and took out one of the company’s cameras she had used, an excellent Nikon D5 that cost more than more than her car. Then she dug out her laptop, a shitty Toshiba that had seen better days, but it served its purpose. She put the laptop in its docking station and turned the power on. But before she connected the camera to the computer so she could download the pictures of the fat bastard she had spent most of the night following around as he treated his latest mistress to a night out on the town, she decided she needed coffee.
“You can shoot just as well with your right as your left,” Sherlock mashed his finger angrily against the Up button. “I need you to check in with Bill Wiggins. Make sure he’s alright and tell him to spread the word to the rest of the Network.”
Just in time too because as John slipped into the stairwell, he heard the front door bell chiming again as a female voice called out “
!” Dupin cried. Sherlock and Remy reached down, unbuckled the vest then peeled it open then let go. The chair squeaked, Clarissa gasped and squeezed her eyes shut but the bomb didn’t detonate.
John was not so blinded by rage that he tried to leave. As he had stated, he knew Mycroft’s spooks and Lestrade’s colleagues were lurking, keeping an eye out on him. Eventually, he found his way down to the morgue, the only place he could think that was quiet.
Jack and Anna had caught them holding hands one afternoon as they watched some stupid program kids liked.
Magnussen, was one of the few people Sherlock had actively hated. Mary should have just gotten rid of Magnussen that night instead of shooting Sherlock. Would have saved the good tax-payers of England some money as well as rid the world of a megalomaniac monster. Plus Sherlock would have kept her secret. But oh no, he did the job for her instead. Almost threw his life away for her and her husband… all because Sherlock
… but he’d be damned if he’d admit that fact to either John or Violet, especially while the pair of them wore quite smug expressions on their faces.
“Shit,” Violet straightened up the best she could. Shivering from the cold air and the cold water as well as her own shattered nerves, Violet looked around the darkened car park vainly as the cold water buffeted her legs again, coming up to her knees this time. When it receded, the water level remained just about at ankle level.
The back door swung open. Sherlock and Mycroft whirled around, hiding their cigarettes behind their backs as their mother shouted “William, you’re being a very poor host to your friend Victor. Leaving him alone in your bedroom… are you two
Sherlock stood at the window, his “Violin Playing Spot.” He held his mobile in one hand and his tea in his other. He tilted his head, indicating Violet should look down.
“Yes, I believe I’ve got everything sorted out,” Violet took her fake eyeglasses off since they were dotted with raindrops. She stood up then winced. “Damn,” she leaned down again to massage her calf.
But she had resumed her simpering Miss Smith 2.0 demeanor when Mrs. Toller did tattle on her during tea. “I don’t mean to be disrespectful, Mr. Rucastle. But it’s been in my experience that it’s better to allow young children to express their creativity rather than have them read about it in books. Six-year-olds just don’t have the memory capacity to retain information such as Art History. Besides, I thought it might brighten Mrs. Rucastle’s day, if Eddie made pictures for his Mummy,” Violet had smiled deferentially, sipping her god-awful bitter tea.
As he led Miss Smith down the alley ways he knew so well, he felt glad Shezza ended up with someone like her and not someone like Mrs. Watson. Bit cold, Miss Smith was, but that was because she brooked no nonsense. Straight as an arrow, she was. Mrs. Watson on the other side, was so twisted, nobody knew where Mary started and where AGRA ended.
“I asked you to protect Sherlock,” Mycroft brandished his umbrella again like a rapier, but he looked as if he would really like to run the brolly through her as if it were indeed an actual sword.
“Sherlock didn’t tell me. And, sorry to disappoint you, but my focus was on Sherlock, not you and Mary. I knew he had been snooping around Magnussen’s penthouse for a case and had gotten shot, nearly died. The official story was you moved back in to help him recuperate.”
John sighed and leaned back in his chair as Mary refilled his coffee mug. Even though today was a bank holiday, both John and Mary had risen early. John out of his old military habit of course. Mary because she a list as long as her arm of chores and errands she needed to accomplish. Her housekeeping had gotten neglected due to the events of the last month.
He had taken her to a new restaurant, one  celebrities and royalty frequented because of a strictly enforced
After sending that text, she sadly forced John out of her mind. She had to; she was entering a very real life and death situation here. Quite possibly the most dangerous scenario she had ever been in since her exile in England began. She had to give all of her attention and focus to this extraordinarily dangerous mission.
Sherlock grew braver and ran his hand over Victor’s golden hair, shocked and delighted by its softness. “Me too. I want to be the first thing you see in the morning too.”
Instinctively he held his arms up and his head down, protecting his face and neck. He yelled again, this time in shock and pain as he felt the dog’s front teeth scraping against his upper arm, tearing cloth and skin. John tried to curl up in the fetal position while shouting at Sherlock.
“Lovely. Listen, I haven’t much time. Are there three warrants on your desk? For a Rucastle and a Mr. and Mrs. Toller?”
“Other than first-hand experience?” she dryly quipped. Then she grew serious, “My thesis paper was on the short and long-term effects of PTSD on federal agents. I interviewed several agents who were at Ground Zero on Nine-Eleven. I also did my internship at Walter Reed.”
Then he remembered that only a few days ago, Violet was sleeping in Sherlock’s bed. Wearing one of his t-shirts all the while Sherlock held her hand.
“No,” Mycroft walked over to Violet, hands behind his back. “I am choosing to work with you. I do not trust you and shall not ever trust you. I am certain the feeling is mutual?”
“How unfortunate,” Mycroft frowned mightily, studying her. Anyone else would have assumed that she had been drinking or had finally gone around the bend. Mycroft knew better. He had witnessed her work. These were no random non sequiturs. Violet was leaping from topic to topic as if they were playing verbal checkers.
“Yes and in the leg too, how inconvenient at this very moment,” Sherlock grabbed her underneath her armpits and threw her over his shoulder like the proverbial sack of potatoes.
Part of their talk that morning had been about John getting a vasectomy. They both agreed they couldn’t stand it, the horror of losing another child.
“Say, Mrs. Fraser, are you free Friday night? My husband and I were planning a date night and I was wondering if you’d be interested in watching the twins?”
“Oh,” Sherlock turned away from Victor and returned to the window. With his back to Victor, he asked, “Would I like New York?”
) that as well because in an acrobatic feat she hadn’t thought possible, he maneuvered them both in a sitting position. She was positive she was going to have cramps in her thighs tomorrow because of that move. At any rate, she now sat in his lap, riding him, grabbing the headboard for support while he sat upright against the piles of pillows, watching her face while caressing her breasts, sweeping his thumbs over her nipples. Then he leaned his head back against the headboard, his eyes fluttering shut as his hands drifted down her back, pulling her closer to him.
John thought, straining his eyes against the void, acutely aware of how the trigger felt against his finger. It felt natural, like it was a part of him, just as Sherlock’s violin was a part of him.
What the little sluts did on their own time was none of her concern, of course, unless they got caught. Then immediate termination, of course. Same with drug use; if a girl wanted to get lit while in the privacy of her own flat, fine. Getting high on the job, unacceptable. Loads of girls had been fired, actually. Loads more quit, especially when they realized that this was actually
Only, she didn’t have to bite anything… just as Dandruff Boy had roughly seized her chin there was a loud
“Um. Yes, I am. He’s just about four weeks old. He’s sleeping now,” she added, her voice sounding a bit panicky. “So, we’ll have to be quiet, sorry. I hate being bossy, but…”
Lestrade looked over his shoulder as Henry tried to shove his entire fist into his mouth. “Listen, now that things have settled down with Moriarty and John and everything… maybe we can figure out some sort of visitation schedule. Let him get to know you?”
Sooooooooooo sorry for the delayed posting! Between work, the holidays and soooo many exciting things happening in my fandoms (especially a particular Christmas special that aired about three days ago...) I really appreciate that all of you hung in there for this long. Also, I must confess, the re-write took MUCH longer than I thought.
“John, Gladstone and I will happily take you up on your offer,” Violet slammed the freezer door shut. “I’m going to take a shower,” she told “the boys” as she walked out of the kitchen and towards the master bathroom. “There better not be any goddamn fish in the bathtub either.”
“It’s fine, it’s all fine. I’m just…” John felt sand in his eyes and an ache in his bones. He wanted to go home, throw the duvet over his head and sleep for the next thousand years. “I didn’t expect the outgoing processing at MI-6 to take so bloody long.”
Violet blew a relieved breath. Then she craned her head to see the corpse outside the van. “God-dammit,” she groaned as she slid out. She yanked the black ski mask off of him as Rat Boy jogged over to her. “Not even twenty-one, I bet.”
his real dad,” Molly said fiercely. Then in a subdued voice, added, “Are you upset that you’re not… his… biological dad?”
John felt an affectionate smile tug on his lips. Sherlock hadn’t been fighting them back, not really, John now realized. As unsentimental as he claimed to be, Sherlock hadn’t had the heart to actually fight them back, to take a chance of actually hurting either one of them. Maybe it would have been a fair fight between John and Sherlock, but Sherlock could have easily thrown Violet off like a rag doll.
Violet turned to smile at Mrs. Hudson. But before she could speak, everything suddenly became very loud and very hot.
“He never learned how to make friends his own age,” John leaned back in his chair. “He was completely isolated.”
At seven o’clock, she finally made a comment. She complained that the shackles were chaffing her skin and politely asked if they could be removed. “Not like I’m going to run off anywhere,” she smiled, pointing the best she could at her bandaged thigh.
“Of course you do,” A muscle in Lestrade’s cheek twitched. “Yeah, alright,” he conceded. “If anything happens to either one of us, Molly will never forgive us.”
“Well, that’s OK,” Susan replied briskly after pondering what John had said. “They’ll let me donate when I’m older, right? When I’m eighteen or something, yeah? You said the dialysis will buy Mumsie time…” she trailed off when she saw John’s face. “The dialysis isn’t going to give Mumsie that much time, is it?”
“That doesn’t seem…. right.” John sounded ill as he dragged his hand over his face. Then he wiped the sweaty hand on his jeans.
“OK,” John told Mary after she parked in front of Baker Street. “I have my mobile with me. Text or call if you need anything, or for no other reason than to hear my voice,” he gave his wife a cheeky grin.
“It’s a permanent retainer. It’s to keep your teeth straight after your braces come off. She was an aspiring actress. Maybe she planned on eventually going to America to become a film star and wanted the ridiculously straight teeth they have. Or maybe she just had really wonky teeth that wouldn’t stay put, dunno. But this made it easier to track down the orthodontist who had applied the retainer to the back of her teeth; that’s how they identified her, poor girl. But look… right… here,” and Molly had pointed with a pair of fine-pointed tweezers.
. Her swimsuit cover-up had hitched up and Sherlock could see what had been a tattoo of a dolphin now looked like a beached whale. She now consoled her unhappy daughter. Sherlock watched Victor have a word with Patricia and together they packed up their swimming things and left the lido, walking past the life guards again. Patricia looked quite relieved to be leaving; she did not seem the type to enjoy being outdoors in a swimsuit.
John gulped, remembering the brutal miscarriage and how stupidly he had dealt with his grief. “Right, we need to warn Sherlock, rescue Violet’s brother and retrieve Susan. How’n the hell are we going to do that with no mobiles and with less than an hour from Violet’s plane landing?”
Now Sherlock scowled at him “Come, John. You had been doing so well. Don’t slip back into the mundane.
for the first time in three years or invite myself to my little fan club and see if The Empty Hearse would be interested in hearing a thrilling tale of heroics and betrayal.”
She blinked. “Just what John told me,” she said cautiously. Then added coldly, “And what you hinted at when we were video-conferencing before John and I saved your brother’s ass.”
“Forget about it,” he brusquely told his big sister. “But she’s right, Dad. The Reverend looks like shit. I don’t think soup and morphine will cut it.”
“Or at least she was six months ago,” Sherlock hated to be the wet blanket, but someone had to keep their head about this recent development.
?” Violet reminded herself to “accidently” destroy Sherlock’s latest experiment as she walked to John’s bed. She put her coffee and mobile on the night stand next to the bed then lay down on the floor on her belly, working a floorboard loose.
Violet came into the lounge. “I can keep him on the leash, if that makes you feel better,” she said in her true voice.
Violet scratched her dog’s head. “We’ve been engaged less than a day and he’s already trying to make me into a housewife,” she complained to Gladstone.
“Oh, you heard me perfectly well,” Sherlock snarled. John couldn’t help but grin as Sherlock sourly continued, “I will never understand why you constantly ask me to repeat myself. I merely wanted to even the playing field so you and I experience the same degree of humiliating vulnerability. So… there, feel better now?” John opened his mouth to speak but Sherlock bolted off the bed. “You’re hungry, you missed dinner. Stale Jaffa cakes probably weren’t that filling. I’ll fix something, tea and… find something edible.”
Mycroft. It’s just for a laugh, really. It’s not like we’re going to start snorting coke or anything stupid like that. I’ve got this under control, Big Brother. Stop being a fusspot about everything.”
He thought about all the lives he had saved, including Sherlock’s… against his will, he remembered Sherlock bleeding out on the floor of Magnussen’s office, his already pale face turning greyish-blue as the bright red blood flowed out of him…
“But it’s going to be unfortunately stolen tonight,” Mary said. “Leave it in your locker. Also, leave your password to your email as well. I also recommend,” Mary pushed the Stop button. The lift jerked then started moving upwards again. “You tell your supervisor you really don’t feel well and leave. Pack up your boys and get out of town. Immediately.”
“Congratulations, Molly Lestrade,” he intoned, leaning over her, touching his cool lips to her warm cheek. “You deserve to be happy,” he breathed into her ear. “All three of you…”
“Peters’ signature is to put a victim inside a coffin,” Sherlock explained as he fumbled around, looking for a light switch. “Then, the actual recipient of said coffin is put on top of the victim. Then the victim is buried along with the deceased and
A different woman answered, this woman with the flat cadence indicating a Midwestern upbringing. “Alice Fowler’s desk, Jessica speaking.”
and Charles Augustus Magnussen would have stabilized the damage caused by Richard and his ridiculous obsession with Sherlock Holmes but when Magnussen died, the merger died with him.”
Then she felt Rucastle’s fingers touching her hair, pulling on a curl that had fallen out of her up-do and she jerked herself out of his grip, her revulsion giving her strength.
Sherlock shivered, not from anticipation this time, but because there was a slight chill in the air, thanks to the ongoing rain. Just as he was about to complain, the bedsprings creaked as John straddled him, his knobby knees bracketing his skinny thighs.
“Yeah, I know, I saw the whole thing. Look, if that was some sort of prank, I’ll sort it out. Just because I have to tolerate his existence doesn’t mean I’m going to stand around and allow him to treat my friends like crap.”
“Where is Susan?” Sherlock had recovered nicely during the drive from Appledore. He had dozed until John nudged him and whispered they were thirty minutes away from his house. He had roused himself, clicked on his mobile and started reading Gordon Fowler’s police report. Then he gasped, “Ah-ha!” and locked his phone screen with a knowing smirk.
In this particular bolt-hole of Sherlock’s, she saw a non-descript van and two motorcycles. Violet fell in love with the bikes immediately.
Violet found Mycroft’s pressure point and pushed it with all her might. “And Sherlock’s will be even shorter. Because Mary is short-circuiting, fast. It might not even be your people or Moriarty’s people who kill her. Right now, it could be fucking
She rubbed her temple with her free hand, feeling a headache starting to build up now, as she recalled John kneeling in front of her, taking her shaking hands in his steady ones…
Sherlock, of course, didn’t pay one bit to Molly. He stared enrapt at the first photo of the ear then rumbled, “Swipe to the next one.” He didn’t want to touch Molly’s phone after poking around the body.
“Then they run like hell,” John added. “Don’t let them dick around at the cem-” he was cut off by his mobile ringing. “Hello?”
Sally never understood why people on televisions and gossip rags said his eyes looked green or even gold. They always looked the same to her, frosty-white with just a hint of blue.  Glacial.
“While it would make sense for either Moriarty or the MI-6 mole to come instead of Sara, those possibilities are remote, quite possibly even nonexistent. Moriarty, for the reasons I had just explained to you. It’s simply not dramatic enough for Moriarty to come tonight.”
Sherlock didn’t bother hiding his drug history with Violet. No point, she had done her research and knew all about it anyway. The arrests, the rehabs, the relapses… the ugly cycle until he found his calling. Created his job…
To his irritation, John noticed Honoré’s eyes were not fixed on his cut on his shoulder or the bruise on his back. Or even the dog bite scars on his arm from last summer. But rather the medical student stared at the bloody gunshot scar, the pinkish-white wormy flesh wrought into an eternal starburst on the back of his shoulder, as if he had been branded by the devil himself.
The morning started with a grey drizzle that progressed into a gloomy winter rain as the day wore on. Cold enough to be miserable but not cold enough for a proper snow… not that it snowed much in London, but still it was utterly depressing all the same.
Maggie shook her head but said, “I do but the video won’t play again. I tried, to make sure I wasn’t losing my mind, but it wouldn’t go.”
“No, I suppose you don’t, do you?” John drained his glass. “Oh Sherlock, I’m not going to blow my brains out, if that what you think,” he snorted. “Besides, even if I did, someone would find a way to resur… resur… bring me back to life. Like Moriarty.”
Suddenly the coffin shuddered, jolting Sally out of her panic. There was a tearing sound then Sally dumbly realized they were tearing away the satin lining. Soon, she heard Lestrade shouting, “Sally? Sally? Are you in there? Are you OK?”
“’Go, go, go…’” Mason murmured. “That is strange. Do you think that it was Miss Smith? That she’s actually not English?”
“I told you, Dupin will be with Violet in Madrid. She will be fine. She will also be, as the kids today say, ‘fangirling’ over him.”
Violet slipped her trembling hands underneath the table but was able to maintain a placid expression on her heavily-made-up face.
John swiveled his head around to see the two Indian men, both of them wearing the traditional turbans, staring sad-eyed at John and his sister. John wanted to slide underneath the table until the shop closed and everyone had gone.
“It’ll do,” the old lion sighed as he cupped the glass properly, letting his hand warm the glass so the amber liquid would reach room temperature. He inhaled softly, breathing in the rich aroma of the Hennessey. “Why on earth would Richie do such a thing?”
