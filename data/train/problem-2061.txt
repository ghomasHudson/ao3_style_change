“Hey John,” Greg called over his shoulder without breaking eye contact with Mycroft.
‘I, right, yes I suppose, I just, I guess I don’t know quite what I’m doing yet’ he turns his head to address the little girl in front of him ‘I just found out about you see little one, but don’t you worry, I’m a quick learner and we’ll find out all this together, if I’d known about you before I guess I’d know what you liked and didn’t and we wouldn’t have to start from zero.’  John can’t help but realise how little he knows, he needs books and research, what chance has he got if he can’t even feed her.
‘We’re getting old Tammy’
“Okay little Miss, time to give Uncle Greg a rest, come have a cuddle with Daddy.”
“Once upon a time, in a city not far from here, there lived a sad Knight. He had been injured in a big battle and the King told him he couldn’t fight anymore. The Knight didn’t know what to do with himself and so he filled every one of his days with the same things. He would sleep, he would eat, he would write and he would walk. The city had beautiful parks and gardens and the Knight liked to take himself through them every day.”
‘I’ll make sure to do that. You sure you want to come out?’ John chuckled in response to Greg’s obvious attempts at mirth.
“Give it five minutes and I’m all yours.”
He’d asked him later what he’d said to make the woman so angry, he’d answered that he had no clue, he’d simply pointed out that diet yoghurts would not help her lose weight and that it was more her deep seated emotional issues that formed the issue, for that he’d ended up covered in yoghurt. Mycroft seemed to think this reaction was unjust while Greg had to agree with the woman when she’d called him a dick, he’d never seen Mycroft struggle with social interaction before but when he thought back on it he’d never seen the man interact with someone other than family, colleagues or he supposed himself. He was polite with the staff of the places they visited together but never engaged in conversation, with Sherlock the conversations tended to revolve around sneers and with colleagues he was sharp and direct, only around Greg had he seen Mycroft truly drop the iceman persona, he’d see him drop it again that evening when he held Mina for the first time.
Greg shook his arm loose from her hold. He dragged the last of his suitcases from its place next to the stairs. Anything else he gave two shits about was already packed in the boot of his car. It had taken him a distressingly short time to bring together all of his belongings but it had felt cathartic to remove them from the room he had once shared with his wife, cathartic to know he was actually leaving her this time and that it would be for good.
“Why don’t you just tell me, you’re clearly salivating at the prospect,” Mycroft pointed to Mitrović’s eyes; clearly dilated, a pulse point that he imagined was likely racing and the man’s shifting hips;  unable to maintain his previously rigid posture.
The pity was clear in Greg’s eyes.
Also a big thankyou to my best friend and beta the lovely Ruby who keeps me sane and ensures every chapter I write makes at least a modicum of sense ;) I adore you Ruby!
Dear John
“Doctor Watson… Detective Inspector I am not comfortable having an armed civilian in this car.”
‘So there’s none of it I could help with, former soldier and doctor, long term flatmate of Sherlock Holmes. That’s got to qualify me for something.’ John finds it amusing watching Mycroft smoke, unlike Sherlock who relished every drag Mycroft seems to find them distasteful, John’s always had him pegged as being a stress smoker unlike Sherlock.
‘No wait Mycroft,’ The detective's use of his first name brought him up short, ‘look I know we're not as close as we were a few months ago but believe me, this is something you’re going to want to stop work for.’ His screen was a blur, Anthea
He just needed to reach out and knock on the door, he’d bought a bottle of wine, something nice the guy in the specialist wine store had recommended, suitable for impressing people who probably had their own wine cellars. John hadn’t recognised the name but judging by the hefty price tag it should be a good one.
‘No, Dada, No.’
“Okay, so why didn’t you tell him?”
John flips open the front cover and reveals the short note in Sherlock's own scrawl.
His mother seemed to be calming somewhat, her face was pressed lightly into his father’s shoulder and it gave Mycroft such a vivid memory of that night five months ago, when he had been responsible for telling them of his younger brother’s death, that he made to slip out of the room after Holly who was removing the tray.
“John told me about your wife. He’s awfully worried about you and I can’t say I blame him. All those horrible things in the papers, Detective Inspector, I don’t mind telling you it was rather distressing to read.”
If any of those things are distressing for you then you might want to skip this.
‘We should probably talk about this,’ Greg mutters before returning his gaze to the man above him, Mycroft’s smile is broader now, he intertwines their fingers,
I entered rehabilitation for the third time and this time engaged with the programmes they offered. I found the majority to be highly tedious and cloyingly emotional but the therapist the centre employed remains to this day an acquaintance that I see fairly regularly. Our appointments became more sporadic once you entered my life as I found myself needing less of a positive influence from Bernard; you provided that light John. You kept me right and sane.
He feels the tears pouring down his face again, he knows this dream, recognises it for what it is, he wants to look away, to walk away but he never does, his feet carry him along the same path, he’s marching towards the building now, adrenaline pouring through his veins, he can never move fast enough, the voice keeps talking, he knows the script by now, he gives his responses just as he did in reality, but he keeps moving this time, keeps moving but getting no closer to the building. But it’s a dream, he knows it is, that means he can change the outcome, he can, he just has to try, he stops moving,
“Alright; can you provide Greg with your second weapon?”
“What about maintenance payments? There’s no mention of them here or the pension savings.”
He’d been right, he’d witnessed firsthand the mans terrible guilt when John had left the room the night before, he’d confided in Greg his feelings, how he was conflicted about the future and how he would be able to help this little girl who’d seen so much so young. He’d tried to comfort him, had been brave enough to embrace the young man briefly, when he’d pressed his face briefly into Greg’s neck he’d felt the tears that decorated Mycroft’s face. He’d felt the dull ache he’d grown so used to while Sherlock had been new to consulting work, whenever he’d had to inform Mycroft of Sherlock having a bad day, a bad reaction, his concern about Sherlock’s social interactions, he’d felt it then, this time it was worse, he’d felt tears prick his own eyes as he’d held Mycroft through his sobs. That he was attracted to him he’d never denied but until that moment he’d never allowed himself to realise how deeply attached he was to the man.
‘Oh, well I’m sorry then, make my earlier comments obsolete. I thought I saw a spark that’s all.’ Greg understands the awkwardness a little more now; at least he doesn’t have to worry about the boy losing his heart to his right hand lady.
“Yes,” Mycroft began but it was John that finished the thought.
Lisa’s introducing herself to Greg when Mycroft walks in, he’s lost the suit jacket and tie and John isn’t certain he’s ever seen him look more casual. Add to that the flecks of white decorating his trousers and the sides of his once spotless shoes John ponders briefly that this must be what he’d look like ravished, he can’t help but laugh, it’s loud and startles everyone in the room to silence, the little girl in his arms taps the side of his face and he dips his lips to kiss her hand.
Again John nodded in response.
“What; you and Mycroft?” John asked. At Greg’s awkward nod John found himself laughing lightly. “No Greg of course I don’t. You’re like my best mate and he’s basically my brother in law. Realistically if you make each other happy I couldn’t not be glad.” Greg still looked disbelieving. “You both deserve some serious joy in your lives, especially after the last year. If you’ve found just that together then I think it’s wonderful. Congratulations mate, seriously.”
‘Wow Greg that’s huge, if a little sudden.’ John wanted to cheer, but he thought such a reaction to the dissolution of a marriage might be “a bit not good”. Sherlock would have scoffed at the very notion of John celebrating Greg’s freedom but he wouldn’t have fooled John. The man would have been smiling to himself. Neither of them had cared for the woman on the two occasions they’d had a forced interactions.
‘Yeah’
‘You sound like you miss him.’
'Because I could never be good enough Greg,' John had always believed Mycroft Holmes had impeccable timing, both bad timing and good, but either way it was impeccable, he entered the office,just in time to hear John's dejected response, his emotions firmly hidden behind the neutral shield both the brothers had shown on so many occasions. John remembered it last from the encounter on Mycroft's doorstep;
They sit as a silent vigil, they’re joined eventually by Devin and Franklin, it seems wrong to have the higher ups of his team here when they just closed a raid but the proceedings will have been mostly handed over to the higher ups when they reported an officer down. They’ve always been a close team, the closest in Greg’s division really, Sally is practically his right hand in all the cases he undertakes but he’d trust his life to the other two as well.
SOBER.
“Do you know how to load that Greg?” John asked.
‘She does Mycroft, she’s laughed and I’ve heard her make some letter sounds, she’s not mute, I think she’s just scared. The medical file explains a little did you look.’
Greg proceeded to check and load the gun ensuring the safety was on before checking the weight of it in his hand.
“Deduce.” John answers teasingly.
SLEEP.
‘Violet and Siger, unusual I know, but that should be no real surprise. Mrs Hudson, are you sure she was ok? She doesn’t have a fever? She wasn’t upset I wasn’t there?’ there’s a small sigh from the other end of the phone and John thinks it’s possible Mrs Hudson had been trying to distract him with talk of the older Holmes couple.  He continued to move closer to the structure, it looked to be at least half made out of glass, a shadow was clearly visible and John’s mind leapt to the possibility of an intruder, his blood started thrumming lightly with adrenaline, he felt it catch in his throat slightly, Mrs Hudson seemed to catch the slight quickening of his breath as panic for his daughter, her tone was kind if a little like that of an exacerbated mother,
‘Accepted and understood, flood light activation in 30 seconds.’
John almost felt bad for the man when he saw Greg stifle a wince; he would have if he didn’t think the man was more embarrassed than upset. He had always taken that stupid woman back and John hoped he would break that cycle with Mycroft and never look back, because at least Mycroft gave a fuck.
‘Well then the answer is clear, share your tale Gregory, I’ve nowhere to be’ and so Greg tells him, he explains how his day went, Mycroft laughs and reacts at appropriate moments and the conversation runs smoothly until he gets to dinner. He explains what happened, filling in details where he can, Mycroft is silent throughout until Greg reaches the kiss, he hears Mycroft draw his breath quickly and he stammers to explain what he said and how it had ended. There’s silence for a long while before anyone speaks again,
‘So tell me Mr Watson what experience do you have with children?’ The social worker had yet to sit down; he continued to make circuits of the living space downstairs, His clipboard and pen his constant companions held so closely to his chest that John was transported back to his second year of school when his neighbour James had lain both his arms on the desk between them chanting ‘No cheating, no cheating’, he remembers getting a better mark on that spelling test and leaving his paper in the middle of the desk to show off a little. James hadn’t spoken to him after that, the little redhead clearly not taken with the idea of John being more intelligent.
The mini jam pots are forgotten about and used in their entirety during John's lazy day breakfast's. Sherlock smiles every time he sees them on the table.Tiny cotton squares folded and kept carefully next to a paper bee.
John wasn’t too eager to keep running with it. He’d rather not drag up shit with his parents in the middle of a public Christmas fair. He allowed himself to be distracted by two children fighting off to the side of them. The girl looked a little similar to Harry when she was eight, it was the braces John thought; the pair of them seemed to be fighting over a cinnamon swirl. The girl looked set to win. She was bigger and the scrap of a boy looked like he might just be fighting for something to do. John couldn’t say he thought the kid deserved to win with that attitude.
Sherlock considers him for a few moments before swearing quietly and clicking his fingers imperiously at Greg and another police officer that John cannot for the life of him name and demands they help him get John into a cab so Sherlock could save him from any further humiliation.
“Yes, well, most of them were, Mr. Lestrade, but Terry wasn’t a bad sort. He would look after me when Frank had a bad day. He never made a move on me if you can imagine. I sometimes wondered if he liked the fellas, you know. And when Sherlock arrived I thought it a little more clearly.”
“For God sake Greg spit it out,” John said, snapping his fingers slightly at his friend to get him to move along. Greg had been known to circle around a point for half an hour while they shared a pint before.
“No Mrs. Hudson, you know I’m right. Sherlock loved his life, he loved…he loved all of us. It never made sense.”
‘I don’t ever forget what she’s been through Mycroft’ he says it quietly because he doesn’t have it in him to yell, not about this, misplacing his anger at Mycroft was a mistake he’d made months ago when it came to Sherlock but with this there was no just cause.
‘John stop fretting, what’s the thing?’ said Greg.
“So just a normal day then.”
‘Someone call for giant Lego bricks,’ the woman, Tammy reappears holding two large plastic boxes ‘theses contain five hundred bricks between them and I can solemnly swear that while I may be up to no good these do not contain pink or glitter,’ she leans over the counter at Mina ‘but missy what I’m not telling Daddy is that they do contain purple bricks because purple is cool, pink is also cool but Daddy here would appear to be on a definitive anti-gender movement and we must respect that’ Her grin is slightly manic when she looks back up at John, it might be a little creepy John thinks but it becomes obvious he’s alone in this conclusion when Mina lets out a giggle and reaches for the woman’s glasses. He’s about to apologise when Tammy whips them off her nose and gives them to Mina, ‘we should encourage an inquisitive nature don’t you think John, she’s a beauty this one.’
He’d not returned her calls for a month but that hadn’t stopped her leaving drunken messages at 4 am asking to speak to Clara, asking him for money, asking him to set her up with someone new.
“Not my orders, no, and no one within the EU, I’ve been collecting data since the termination of the interview.”
‘Is she well?’
Mycroft raises his face to acknowledge the person joining them through the French doors, Anthea comes forwards holding out her tablet for Mycroft to see, he takes it off her before sighing deeply.  He nods once in response before the brunette spins and returns to Mycroft’s, whatever information the tablet holds it’s clearly not good news, John holds his curiosity back, forcing himself to keep his eyes fixed on the garden over his drinking companions shoulder rather than the illuminated screen the man is staring at,
“Well alright, if you’re impatient, we’ll miss out the love story and jump straight to the confrontation. The hero and the villain stand on a roof. They look out over London, seemingly insignificant to the sprawling metropolis, and they discuss their final problem. Two brilliant minds, two players, one bored and the other terrified, the great game and a final solution.”
“Something’s happened,” Greg said from the front seat. He had turned around and was looking between John and the back window in quick succession.
‘Doctor Watson, I trust you found the gardens a pleasing diversion?’ John returned his proffered smile with a short nod before turning to his Mother, ‘Doctor Watson, may I introduce my mother, the Lady Violet Holmes, I see you have already met my Father.’  His mother came forwards her hand gently touching his arm before extending her hand to John,
‘Yes’ She was the head of his security for a reason, the woman could bring together an army with a click of Mycroft's fingers,
“Because one day a brave Duke someone who knew the Prince as well, he found a little girl and she was very beautiful and very sad because she was all alone. So this Duke took her back to the city and realised that she was very similar to the Prince he had known, so he called the Knight and the Prince’s brother, the King, and they both came to see her. The Knight realised he had been wrong when he thought he couldn’t love again because this little girl made him feel much better. She helped him heal his heart and he promised she would never be alone again. Because the Princess is the Knight’s daughter now and that means he’d never leave her and she never needs to be frightened because everyone is going to keep her safe.
‘You stayed with her through the hospital though.’
“You never knew this did you; you can see the similarities between this little devil and your own sweet prince. They grew up with such similar worlds. They were the same, really,” Mitrović said with yet another smirk.  The man had clearly identified Sherlock as a point of weakness but Mycroft had been through years of repressing his brotherly instincts in the face of criminals. It worked to the point where many believed they despised each other. Perhaps Mitrović believed his brother’s recent demise would have created rawness to insults relating to him.
She passes across the newspaper clipping and John skims the article.
‘No, wait Mycroft,’ Mycroft stops halfway through the door and turns halfway towards John, ‘You know you’ve not let anyone down right? I mean, it’s not your responsibility to keep everyone happy.’
He didn’t want to remove anything, didn’t want to disturb what had been Sherlock’s domain. He moved towards the closet finding it spacious but half full, the bottom of the cupboard full of shoes, some of which were missing partners but John thought he might find space for his three pairs somewhere. Maybe by getting rid of the ones without partners, it seemed like a good enough place to start. Choosing not to consider why Sherlock owned two pairs of stilettos, black with a red heel and dark blue, he removed those he deemed unnecessary, the slowly increasing pile fit comfortably into a black bin bag, placing his shoes in the gaps he turned to the dresser. He didn’t have many clothes that would require hanging but he would need draw space. Clearing the top draws of underwear and socks was simple enough; no consideration was really necessary for those but upon opening the second John found himself forcing down a broad smile.
Mrs Hudson’s agreed to update him after each of her checks and they ended the conversation with her wishing him good luck, she’d been nervous for him before he’d left, straightening the not on his tie twice before going over the sleeves of his coat checking for dust or stray hairs.
A photograph that appears just after New Year has Sherlock walking the edge of sanity.
‘Now you listen to me Mycroft Holmes, he’s a good man and a good father, he’s handling it perfectly, you don’t go interfering or we’ll be having words young man. Understood?’
Mycroft knew her past, knew he could not blame her in this situation for allowing her emotions to reign over logic.
‘The thing is she’s not sleeping well, she’ll wake up early in the morning, I think from a nightmare,’ after the first night of screaming cries waking him he’d slept next to her crib all night, his hand resting against the bars while she clung to whichever of his fingers she could reach, ‘she, she’s not doing well at being alone, she sleeps ok when I’m there with her but, she just, she just gets scared.’
He must drop off again because he suddenly becomes aware of Sally shaking his leg lightly, there’s a doctor standing to the side of them closest to the door. Greg notes that both the guards are back in place, the doctor starts talking about the surgery, how the wound had run too deep and P.C. Osborn had lost too much blood; he’s apologising and saying they did everything they could. Saying he’s sorry for their loss and Greg wants to scream, scream that she was too young, scream that it wasn’t fair, scream at them to keep trying , but all he can do is stare. Sammy’s dead, she’s gone and suddenly Greg can’t seem to get enough air. Everyone’s crying again, Hannah is clinging to Peter, her hands wrapped in his shirt. He’s pulling Sally to him too, he can see her body shaking, knows she must be sobbing but all he can hear is white noise. His knees give out from under him and he hits the plastic chair hard on his way down. Two strong arms fit under his arms and he’s lifted back to standing, he feels himself shake but the arms only grip harder,
“I get it, Greg. But rules are rules. Either show me a
“No way, he’s not that smart,” Draco replied, rolling his eyes. “Well, not on his own, anyway. But he’s always been Dumbledore’s favourite, wasn’t he? I’m sure if he even did as much as
“Correct. For a while it seemed like Cas never existed in the first place. Freaked us out. We visited psychics --”
episode 13, chapter 2
Not waiting for Sherlock to respond, John walked to the rocks and started climbing down carefully. They were even enough for him not to worry about slipping and breaking a bone or two. Once he hopped on the grass, he semi-crouched, listening for angry noises of the aviators around. A murder of white and grey crows gathered on a willow nearby, heads bobbing, beaks opening and closing as croaks escaped their throats in their own language. John tried to make himself look as unassuming as possible.
Updated: 10.2. 2021
“Did you dream?”
“I haven’t,” he responded, handing the book back to Sherlock. “As I said, it’s much different from any other text I’ve seen. And I haven’t been dispatched to Earth until two years ago. This journal is at least fifteen years old, if not more.”
“They could now.”
, John Watson who tried not to look like a deer in headlights, much like Sherlock felt at the sight of him.
“I play Quidditch willingly!”
“Are you alright?” Dean looked him over. Sherlock nodded despite the quelching unease in his chest and showed him the ring. His wet clothes clung uncomfortably to his skin.
Sherlock hummed, completely consumed by the secrets the journal revealed to him. Oh, this definitely wasn’t fake. He probably should be more perturbed by the fact that the reality wasn’t strictly black and white and some sort of magic veiled through the fabric of existence, but… To hell with that! This is a gold mine! Practically his childhood dreams of being a treasure hunter or adventurer… There was an addendum on the bottom of the page.
“What? Why?” Dean asked, mock hurt by her admonition. He put a palm over his heart and wept. “I bought you ice cream
“Well, for one: they’re absolutely incompatible,” John said, dragging his bottom lip between his teeth before continuing. “I didn’t notice it as a kid, but as I grew older I saw how they behave toward each other. They’re divorced, but they live in the same house, for reasons that elude me. No, in fact, it’s the finances. They wouldn’t be able to afford housing without a second income, so they stick together like expired glue. They trash-talk the other one, no matter if we hear them or not. There’s usually lots of yelling every time I’m home. There are good periods where it seems fine, but that doesn’t stay. It’s chaotic. I try to not let it get to me. But yeah, in general, it’s kinda shitty.”
“I’m sorry, Sherlock, but you keep saying I’m an idiot. So, you have to spell it out for me.”
special thanks to bee, dee, and pizza
“I hung out in the museum, helped him get rich. He sometimes sat with me and gossiped. That was also nice. He confided in me, too. When things with his partner got a little tense and all, you know how it goes.”
As Jo-Beth started talking, Irene zoned out. The tone of her voice was monotonous and underwhelming to listen to. John next to her stirred, rolling his eyes as he heard something Irene tuned out. Sherlock looked bored as ever; nothing new there. Thank goodness Greg wasn’t here -- or maybe he heard it in whichever shop he was in now? Hopefully he doesn’t break any items in his proximity.
Into battle!
“What were you doing there? Banishing another racoon?”
“You have no right to call me foul,
“Oh my God, really?” John laughed, eyes crinkling. Sherlock found himself adoring his smiles with every single one he witnessed. “But why would you need it?”
It was a sunny September day, one of the last few that still carried a whim of summer with them. Sherlock scowled at him (again) for ever even considering taking up such classes before departing for his Ancient Runes class in a huff and whirl of his robes. John had a bit of a problem locating the classroom, which turned out to be in the North Tower. Upon arriving somewhat on time, he found his classmates waiting atop the stairwell. Everyone was perplexed where to go from there. Then all of a sudden, a ladder dropped down from a trap door, startling two Slytherin girls standing right under.
“I thought Jake might use the company,” Irene said, sitting down. Jake curled up in her lap, she didn’t protest. Poor bugger was touch starved. Ha, he really was similar to Sherlock, except fluffier. “You don’t have fleas, do you?”
“Yes, Gregory,” Mama nodded, her thin arm reaching through the bars to pat him on his left bicep.
“It’s an unsatisfactory habit in the summer,” he grumbled.
“Don’t try me,
"You want to - Sherlock, you realise First Years are prohibited from entering that section?" John couldn't believe Sherlock would think of breaking the school rules. Professor McGonagall was crystal clear that any disruption of the rules would result in losing House Points, and he certainly didn't want to drag Gryffindor down. And also Professor McGonagall was scary when angry (she once told off a pair of girls in Transfiguration and that frightened about everyone in the room, even though her delivery was calm and collected).
‘It’s wonderful, Sherlock, her father, he loved bees, and music, I guess maybe this would be fitting’, his smile is a little watery as he presses kisses into Mina’s hair; she’s still staring at the bee but moves her hands back to John’s jumper. It’s been a long day, they’re both ready to go home, standing again he asks if Tammy will bring the toy for them as well.  Anthea helps him balance the bags and Mina who’s become intent on having a nap attached to John, he’s not complaining but it makes loading a car difficult, he’s about to navigate the car seat again when the front of the store opens,
There was a time in my life where I believed I was winning that battle John. I was alone for such a very long time before you came into my life. I had my work and the individuals I was forced to interact with for it. There was also my brother, who distanced himself from me while I was in my final stint of rehab and my parents.
Hello Poppets
“Of course I would.” Greg muttered this in Mycroft’s ear as he clasped his shoulder from behind. Mycroft rocked back on his heels, leaning into the pressure, his eyes still glued on Mina.
John laughs again, slight awkward this time, it’s disconcerting being able to hear someone and not see them, not only that but behind the bookcases the natural light from the front of the store is obscured and there’s an unnatural green glow coming from behind a curtain his left.
“Well good. Now Francis, how far out from Mycroft’s home are we?” Mrs. Hudson asked.
“Yes ma’am.”
‘Your father would have been so proud of you baby, we both love you so much’ he knows it’s true, whatever comes after this life, wherever Sherlock is, he’d be so proud today and he also knows he’d have been as besotted with their daughter as he is every day.
Greg placed a hand lightly on her shoulder as they walked further, he’d not missed the quaver in her voice and he felt a fresh surge of guilt for how the raid had ended. It was not only his team but also their families that bore the brunt of the pain from such events. Greg’s mother had spent over an hour sobbing down the telephone begging for him to come home so she could look after him. He was on the wrong side of forty to need that level of care from his mother but he had to admit there was something comforting in knowing the offer was still there.
"Have you made a list?"
‘Nothing John, nothing it doesn’t matter. We should return indoors, you were correct in your first assessment it is too cold to be outside.’
Moran seems to be moving on so I suppose I shall do the same. I wonder if you ever had a pet, I wish I could simply ask you, or deduce it I suppose.
‘What can we do? What help can she have? She is so young’ John moved to kneel in front of Violet, he takes her shaking hands gently in his own, his voice is soft,
“Alright, so I’d hold back on punching you until you passed the baby off, but John, don’t be sorry. This is good. You should be talking about this. I struggled with accepting myself in my twenties, it was hard then but I image it must be ten times harder when you’re pushing forty.”
“No, I don’t believe he did. She would have been a weakness for Sherlock and one Moriarty would likely have exploited.”
Here is my list.
‘John dear, there’s a parcel just been delivered it’s awfully big so I left it downstairs. Well good morning to you to Mina, what a lovely smile.’ Mrs Hudson stood in the doorway, Mina upon seeing their visitor lost all interest in the battle of wills she and John had been engaging in and smiled. ‘What are you doing John?’ But just as John turned to answer he saw Mina push onto her hands and start to crawl.
‘I’ll try Mycroft’ their conversation ends here, John quietly thanks Anthea for her help so early in the morning but the only response he gets is a slight nod. Her features are kind however and he doesn’t come away from the morning’s drama with quite the same level of self loathing he would expect.  He’s uncertain how to spend his morning now; he knows he won’t return to bed, fear of another nightmare would keep him awake if he tried, but he wants to do something useful or constructive. He finds sitting with his own thoughts so soon after an attack of this kind deeply unhelpful but for once the house is clean and organised, the laundry has been done and even Mina’s toys have been organised in the toy chest they’ve taken to keeping in the living room.
“More Dada.” Mina was so close to sleep but John was just as wrapped up in the story as she was in listening to it.
“Are you certain?”
Both men grinned down at the curled bundle his daughter made against his chest. John knew that if asked right this moment he would struggle to think of a time he had been happier than this. That was not to say that he couldn’t think of a reality he would be happier, with Sherlock beside him instead of Greg, the two of the close together; Sherlock’s arm wrapped around him and Mina forming another layer of their little family.
She had left him in the nursery then; he had never felt more alone.
‘Ah well the question is, John do you know about Sherlock’s final stay in a rehabilitation centre,’ Mycroft continued with his tea, the information he was sharing touched a deeply personal portion of Sherlock’s life yet here they were discussing it over tea. John felt himself sneering; the desire to tell Mycroft he’d caused enough damage by sharing Sherlock’s secrets already on the tip of his tongue, but this was a story he wanted to hear, even if It meant betraying his memory of Sherlock, he needed data and to be honest with himself he wanted to know more about the man he’d lost. So he held his tongue and allowed himself to make eye contact with Mycroft once more.
‘Yes I believe she is happy, as happy as any other nineteen month old child.’
‘No harm done, did you need to sneak another cigarette, this evening likely hasn’t reduced your stress any, I’m sorry.’  Mycroft barks a laugh at this, the sound is harsh in the calm and silence of the night air, John hears an undertone of aggression in Mycroft’s tone but thinks better of mentioning it.
BOXING.
“I’m sorry ma’am but Mr. Holmes has asked that we hold off on the details until he had a chance to speak with you himself.”
The man John recognised as being Terry, although he looked entirely different in the later picture, stood front and centre in a group of four men, each of them in suits and wearing distinct police badges.
“Nah Greg, it’s alright, I don’t mind.” They’d quietened again, the pair of them looking out across the near blackness of the gardens. “You’re right. I don’t talk about him much, but it’s because I don’t know what to say.”
"I don't know chamomile. If I must I want peppermint." Came Sherlock's voice from the living room.
“I don’t think it tells you much Mrs. Hudson.” Greg grumbled.
“And why would I do that?”
‘Mrs Hudson is here! Mrs Hudson!’ John plasters himself against the staircases banister in order to avoid getting run over by the younger woman. Tammy had been taken with Mrs Hudson immediately, John supposed the woman had that appeal for slightly lost souls, which he felt both him and Tammy were; he saw Mrs Hudson pull her into a one armed hug a broad smile on her face.
‘Devin.’
“You ready to go to war?” Greg turned his head to send a wink to John who simply raised an eyebrow in confusion.
It was clear because John could see what Greg meant, he could observe the similarities the look of her; her face, that stare, even the bloody cupid bow lips, the pout was so perfectly Holmesian John wanted to laugh, hysterically, without breathing, but he couldn't because his only thought was, God but she looked like him. So beyond beautiful.
Dinner is finally over!
Oh and I'm wondering about the best way to format the continuation of the story. Should It be within the same fic or should I make a series? Let me know if you have an opinion.
‘Thank you Samuel, please return to the car.’ Samuel inclines his head to the woman before doing the same to John with the addition of a small smile. Anthea waits until the front door has closed behind him before holding her hand out towards him,  he shrinks back from handing over his gun, she clicks her fingers and points to the other hand which is still clutching the phone,
“Oh John,” Mrs. Hudson sobbed quietly.
I MISS HOME.
“And the pair were drawn together from that young age; your darling brother taking a shocking level of interest in the demise of little Carl. He caught Moriarty’s eye, you know, that year. He was a threat, if a small one.” This was something Mycroft knew; Moriarty had been honest enough about his stalking, the tracking of his brother’s lifetime.  “Moriarty watched him, you know, through school, university; through the drugs and whoring, he watched and he observed. The drugs kept him, your brother, docile, you know. They allowed Moriarty to expand his empire right under the impressive noses of the Holmes brothers, distracted as they were with family matters,”  Mitrović said. “You missed his expansion; missed his influence within these very halls.”
‘You doubting yourself won’t help anyone, especially her, no one knows it all John and right now what she needs isn’t your uncertainty, she needs your love.’ He supposes she’s right but he’s not even certain of that completely, over the last day he’s felt more than he has in months, he’s emotionally and mentally exhausted and the only thing keeping him upright is the knowledge that this little girl now exists, he’s completely smitten and completely terrified, to top it all every time she smiles she gets dimples that remind her of Sherlock.
‘You’re going to have to explain that to me, are you developing something radioactive because if so I should really remove the Ewok from my daughter’s mouth,’ She follows his line of sight to the curtained room.
‘Now now Mrs Hudson, the man is doing his job you know.' If Greg realised how close that tone was to getting him cuffed round the ears John doubts he would have risked it, 'Besides John can take it, most likely be more difficult with a kid won’t it.' He's trying out his charming smile, John's seen him use it on people in interrigations before but he's underestimating Mrs Hudson's ability for righteous anger, 'You’ve just got to roll with the punches John, it’ll be worth it.’  Mrs Hudson not appreciating Greg’s candour looked to be holding back a retort as she began replacing the items on the mantelpiece; small pieces of a life John had lived with Sherlock, he couldn’t bring himself to look them over but knowing they’d been moved was equally painful. In the few weeks he’d lived here after Sherlock’s death he’d sat in this room nursing the bottles of scotch, whiskey and port they’d accumulated over experiments, lacklustre parties and the moments of Sherlock being Sherlock that had left John needing a strong drink.  He’d thrown the last of the bottles away the day Harry called and he was more drunk than she was, he’d returned to therapy instead and moved into the hovel of a bedsit he’d called home for a short time.  Ella was going to have some sort of fit when he got around to informing her about the upheaval in his life.
‘With that sort of attitude you’re pretty much volunteering yourself aren’t you?’ the raised eyebrow is all the response he gets before his junior flaunts out of his office, she really would be better suited to a runway Greg thinks but she’s one of the best the MET has to offer, their relationship has been fraught since Sherlock’s death but he thinks she feels some level of guilt for her involvement, he can’t say how much though. Deciding she’s right about the coffee he decides to make a run to the independent coffee house opposite their building, he needs something with multiple shots and something sickeningly sweet to boost his blood sugar.
Where the anxiety to be impressive came from John wasn’t certain, he supposed he wanted them to believe Mina was in the best of hands and appearing confident was part of that but, if he was honest with himself, he also just wanted them to like him. Sherlock may never have spoken about them in John’s presence but they were his parents and John was his, well he didn’t really know what he’d been to Sherlock but certainly, best friend would cover the relationship.
I wonder sometimes if you would let me or would you be dominant, would you want to fuck me? Would it be hard? or soft? Would you treat me like porcelain John? I think you would want to take control, you believe it is what society expects of you and you do like the play to societies rules do you not John? You are a provider and a protector John, at least in your mind. Who looks after you though? I would like to, I did try, I do not truly know if you would let me.
Apparently happy with her hand off Tammy rushes forwards to help John balance the assortment of toys, puzzles and books he’s found to fill their flat, he only just stops himself from buying a glow in the dark Millennium Falcon, as he follows Tammy back to the cash register he once again focuses on the green glow,
Well, I’m not sure…”
Code Zero.
His dinner companion clears his throat; Greg meets his eyes with a smile hoping to recreate the easy camaraderie they’d enjoyed on previous occasions,
“Come to bed with me?” John asks and Sherlock nods timidly. Now that the mask has dropped Sherlock looks exhausted.
‘Or we could go.’ Greg’s voice is soft as if he half doesn't want anyone to hear the suggestion, ‘Me and Mycroft could go to the nearest store and get the stuff you want, just make a quick list, you can always take her out tomorrow or do one of those internet orders, but for right now why don’t we go and leave you to get yourself settled. You will probably want to unpack before she gets here’ it was a reasonable suggestion, the mildly confused look Mycroft was wearing aside, John thought it made sense. He went to check the cupboards and began his list. He thought to get a combination of formula and baby food, tea was always a priority, he imagined caffeine would play a massive part in the next years of his life and he only hoped the Yorkshire Gold would continue to carry him through as well as it did in the war.
at this. She could make a career out of it. Or have it as a paid hobby.
“God, I hope not.”
"How do you know they share the same name?" John asked, equally as puzzled as the other boy.
“Ah. Sorry, I ran out of crystal clear lake water when I was clearing your wounds. So you’ll have to do with boiled river water. Anything else your majesty desires?”
John pinched the bridge of his nose. It shouldn’t be hard to say it. Greg watched him silently without urging or pressing him.
“Thank you! Now, I wonder where Greg is,” she said, opening the sliding door leading to her porch and calling after her employer. “Greg? Brownies are done!”
Sherlock, not expecting to be asked at this point, shrugged. “Uhm… Oh! Maybe tomatoes?”
Well, okay. Sam frowned and took a step back. Irene guided him to a chair she pulled from the kitchen and offered him lemonade. “So… what happened?”
Dean looked at Sherlock. “Can you see his wings too?”
John clenched and unclenched his fist, remembering what he wanted to do. Ah, talk to Irene. He didn’t cross a meter before a clatter of things falling in the bathroom made his instinct dash into the room like the speed of light without thinking. He realised his intrusion as soon as he stepped over the threshold, but thankfully Sherlock was fully clothed, save for his unbuttoned shirt. Bottles of shampoo and hair products from the cabinet had fallen on the tiled floor from above the sink.
Okay just a little word of warning sweeties
‘Well there are three I can remember off hand; all the world is made of faith, and trust, and pixie dust.’ Tammy laughs lightly at this one, ‘You know that place between sleep and awake, that place where you still remember dreaming? That’s where I’ll always love you. That’s where I’ll be waiting,’ That one made him think of Sherlock, he’d started staring in John’s dreams again but he was no longer the bloodied face on the pavement, now he shone brighter than he had in life, they ran through the streets of London, bounding over roof tops, laughing at crime scenes. The last quote however was his favourite,
Tammy retrieves her plate from the table; she took the time to inhale a spring roll before turning to John,
‘Mycroft dear did I hear you come in?’
He remembered his dream, remembered the sweet weight of Sherlock across his lap, and allowed the deep seated longing he repressed normally overtake him. He stared down at his daughter nestled in her blanket and unaware of the drama haunting her tiny family. John decided it was better to lose himself in the fantasy of having a complete family, Sherlock by his side, both of them watching over Mina, than sit for the next fifteen minutes with the very real possibility that the portion he did have was under threat.
“Tell me, Agent Fairchild, what did he say?”
ANONYMOUS SEX. PUNISHMENT. COCAINE.
So she has significant connections but that's not why she's interesting. She has been working with her family, under the protective pretense of their pharmaceutical company, to develop a new methamphetamine compound that would improve the purity of their product.
“Why did neither of you tell me?”
Mitrović shrugged, not bothering the hide the pleasure he was taking from the conversation.
DRUGS.
“Hey, whatever gets you going mate. I get the whole Holmesian-sexual thing.”
Mycroft can hear them over the speaker of the baby monitor, he feels he should shut it off and allow them the privacy they deserve but he can’t make himself, he’s been spoilt by the amount of positive time he’s spent with his niece since he found out about her but this, these cries and the noises John makes to comfort her, the sentimental words of love and belonging, this is the reality, there’s so much she needs that none of them know how to provide or give.
By the fourth year John has convinced himself to move on. He buys flowers for Mary and accompanies her on a walk around Kew Gardens. They have a nice day but John doesn't feel it is anything special.
‘If your question, D.I. Lestrade, is whether I want you,’ Mycroft’s voice comes out as a deep growl, he holds Greg’s wrists flat to the wall by his head, restraining him as he thrusts hard against him, Greg finds himself whimpering under the movements of Mycroft’s hips, ‘rest assured, I have never wanted another in the way I want you’ he feels hands running down his back, pulling him closer, their chest pressed together while Mycroft moves to bite his neck softly, the difference in pressure, the hard thrusts and soft mouth against him retches up his arousal,
John was bought back to reality by a hand on his shoulder, warm even through his jacket and the solid weight of Mina against his chest grounded him even more. Coming back could sometimes feel like waking up, sometimes it was like being dragged through glass but more often it was like this, like being clear again after wading through fog. Coming up to breath after losing control of how deep you’d sunk.
‘She would appear to be around two years old Mrs Hudson although we cannot be sure.’
“What is there to be at sea about; you’re both adults. For what it’s worth I don’t think you need to date. I mean you should go on some, treat the man to a nice dinner or something but really you’re kind of intense to be dating. Just you know, be together, in a relationship, prescribe a title if you need one but if not then just do what makes you happy. But seriously mate: how kinky are we talking?”
I suppose you would blame me for this. I blame myself John. So let us be agreed upon that. In this situation, in this hell, the blame shall lie upon me. As always.
When Greg was younger Christmas was his favourite time of year. No matter how much money his family may or may not have had Christmas Day was always special; it was the one day a year when you could guarantee every member of the family would be under one roof, around one table. In their family missing Christmas dinner was equal to kicking the dog or blaspheming in their mother’s presence and Greg loved it. For the first thirty years of his life he never missed a Christmas dinner or a Christmas day with his family. His mother never failed to adorn his head with a foolish tinsel halo and his father never learnt to water down his punch. Yes, Christmas for the Lestrade family meant coming together as one group to share in the warm glow of their home. That all changed for Greg when he met his wife.
From across the street a person wolf whistles and then there is quiet laughter and a momentary jeer before Sherlock throws an insult at the teenagers and John hears them beat a rapid retreat. But John feels himself tense up under the cover of Sherlock’s frame and coat anyway, feels the first trickles of cold and the adrenaline crash make his body tremble.  He also feels his erection flag and doesn’t know whether he should be annoyed or relieved.
‘John Mr Holmes is waiting in his study for your arrival, if you’ll follow me,’ The other brunette is still smiling at him and John wonders vaguely if the hair colour forms some part of a Mycroft employee uniform,
‘Is that it then? You’ve decreed and therefore it will be?’ he can see the tears threatening but he is set on this. It must be John Watson and the reason is clear. Moving forwards the seats himself on the table so he and John can be on the same level.
Greg couldn’t honestly account for the slight stab of disappointment that ran through him at the thought of not seeing Mycroft; if he was being honest with himself he would admit that part of him, the part of him that longed to feel Mycroft’s body press him firmly into a mattress and take him apart with his teeth, tongue, hands and cock, had hoped the man would attempt to seduce him. He repressed that side though, promising to his slightly twitching member that he would bring himself off to the memory of Mycroft’s hands and voice once he was settled somewhere for the night.
John gave Sherlock the puppy-eye stare, lips pouting and hands clasped together.
he told himself. Didn’t he shoot Irene and Kate down on this topic mere ten minutes ago? Ugh, he was such a liar, being smitten by random encounters such as these. Of course he couldn’t dodge this sentiment. Anyway, the good thing was that this guy was here probably just this once. He would never have to see his handsome face again (did he really just think that?) - he possibly just wants his money back because of Lestrade's tourist trap sellings.
“No biggie. C’mon, no, up you get. I’m starving and I need my coffee to keep me up ‘n runnin’.”
“That’s why I asked Kate to get them.”
A couple of heads sitting around him nodded in agreement. He felt a pang of satisfaction at the sight of it.
The trunk of Greg’s car shut with a bang as he deposited his and Mrs Hudson’s bags there. The sun shone brightly above their heads, the noon light barely throwing a blink of shade on the town. Half of the Shack was up and about at seven o’clock, but John roused even sooner than that. He took the doggies out to pee and had breakfast, did some strength exercises, had a shower, dressed, and waited for Sherlock to tumble downstairs.
“Yeah, about that….” John huffed out an exasperated breath. How was he supposed to talk about this? He’d never had a talk about relationships with anyone much. Not even when he got together for those few months with his ex, which was fucking awkward later. Not that he didn’t trust Greg, but it never seemed that important. Guys’ talk, however, inevitably found them.
“Don’t be romantic, John,” Sherlock huffed, but his voice was pleased. “It’s not too bad.”
he had the day off to have a date with Mrs Hudson. As such, his other three employees had to step in, though their proficiency skills weren’t as sharp as Angelo’s, but they were as tasty, at least. John had no trouble waiting, at least he’ll figure out what the fuck is up with Sherlock.
"But that doesn't mean all of them are like that!" John said, turning his head to the Slytherin table. "Just because some of them do bad things doesn't mean the rest should be shamed, Greg."
Where --
“Jesus, no!” Dean said, horrified. “We’d never do that! Cas said that Grace was growling at something in the dark and that he’s seen some weird movement too.”
enjoy
“And how is that?”
“I say Rapunzel!” John shouted after her, eliciting a low chuckle from Sherlock. Irene took that into consideration. But now she, Greg, and Mrs Hudson needed to settle the Johnlock bet.
John wanted to make a remark about her not being so subtle, but she was right, to a degree. The table was large. Too large. Maybe that was good and he should’ve stayed where he was to put an obstacle between the two of them in case she jumps at him and kidnaps him. Jeez, his anxiety was doing a great job overthinking. He obeyed and took a seat next to her. Mary wore a black dress to this occasion, one that hugged and complimented her figure, her hair held in position by dozens of pins, John noticed.
, either.”
“When don’t you?” Sam teased.
“What? I’m just happy for you two, is all.”
The scurrying feet of Mr. Bagman approached the boy, he squeezed his hand and had a look of utter bliss on his face, strongly contrasting the otherwise very somber atmosphere.
A kick on the wood and a groan reached them from the corridor. Irene. And in tow behind her was John, an arm around her shoulders. “I can’t believe Greg does this six days a week! He’s either going insane or he went insane fifteen years ago. Maybe both.”
“Who are you?” the leader hissed, standing abruptly. His nose quivered, nostrils flaring.
John took the pan off the heat and plated the three of them scrambled eggs that he’d prepared in the meantime. He excluded Cas since he has explicitly stated that he doesn’t need sustenance, and because Greg and Mrs Hudson were gone, there was no need to pretend to be human. John put toast slices on the plates and put them in front of Irene and Sherlock and they ate in silence.
Almost empty, there were only three other customers in the diner, two of them perched behind the bar. Angelo’s had a retro look about it; an old jukebox stood in the left corner, above which a fishnet with old-timey pictures hung loosely. The right side of the diner was mostly lit by fairy lights and candles, each table having its own set. A couple of framed pictures hung above the bar too, most of them articles from newspapers that brought up Angelo’s cooking skills, others being faded diplomas -- also awarded to Angelo.
When it came to the rest of the journal and its contents, Sherlock decided against his initial doubt that the book was, in fact, not a fake. A thought crossed his mind that this could be a prank of Lestrade’s, but it seemed too complicated for him to go through such a hussle. Lestrade may have been cunning, but he was also incredibly lazy to pull a stunt like this. Plus, who would build a compartment in the middle of a forest if not a legible mystery hunter that could have been long dead and this was the only legacy left?
Said brother seemed unenthusiastic to be photographed, his curls long and falling into his eyes, though a timid smile tilted the right corner of his mouth. Hm. She tried searching for Sherlock’s instagram, but no results showed. Either he didn’t have an account on the platform or used a different name. She’ll investigate that later.
“Mary,” she countered, letting the door fall closed. The other girl had her hands comfortably tucked in her coat pockets, one leg thrown over the other. “You said you wanted to have a girl talk, so I am here.”
John rolled his eyes, more at himself than at them - he should stop expecting them to know such trivia. He didn’t know much wizarding stuff either. Like with that Lord whoever-knows-who-it-was. At least he wasn't a threat anymore since last October.
“It’s a pillow pet,” John explained. “You can fold them up like this and they turn into a pillow, hence the name. You can lay them out flat or roll them up, depending how you like it. And you can cuddle it, too.”
episode 12, chapter 1
"You should go head first," said Sherlock impatiently as John hesitated to crouch down.
“Sir!” Mary called out when Greg appeared, carrying a paper bag full of sweet donuts he’d purchased and six cups of coffee in a cartoon tray.
"We have to get it done whether you like it or not. I thought you liked Potions?"
“It’s early,” Dean said, taking a seat closest to her. Cas sat on the opposite side of the table. “Aren’t you tired? I can help you out if you’d like. I’m no professional, but I ain’t no amateur either.”
“Yes,” Irene confirmed, prodding Jake closer to her proximity. “That is if you promise not to steal anymore. We can have a compromise, because I like you. You’re bloody adorable. I can sneak things you’re curious about down here whenever I’m able to, and in turn I can use this pocket universe as a hiding place when I need it.”
“Ah, yes. The
Take care
Irene blinked, and her brother was gone. Out of the corner of her sight she saw a flurry of motion. Sherlock pushed his way through a crowd of tourists, taking out a lighter and cigarette out of his pockets.
“NOW you want to show yourself to him?”
“Right,” Irene said, “I could use John with the shovel - long story, not that old - but you’ll do. Just smack anything furry that may run out of there. We’re not taking any chances. With any luck, I’ll spray the racoon into oblivion, it passes out, I drag it out and we toss it back in the forest for some fae people or whoever to sort it out.”
“You mean that scrawny tall kid?” Gabe said, looking at him to confirm. John nodded, his heart beating faster. Gabriel made a sound and snapped his fingers.
. Cas, no offense but I hate your family.”
“Glad you like it.”
“Sherlock,” John interrupted, “don’t you… see the wings?”
“It won’t?” Sherlock said, dumbfounded. John’s hand shot up to scratch the back of his neck, eyes averted to evaluate a painting with cats chasing dogs on llamas that hung on the wall. What a ridiculous painting. Sherlock wondered where Lestrade stumbled upon such rubbish. He recognised how his question must’ve sounded when he let it sink in. God dammit.
Greg scurried off, the groan of the sofa cushions audible from the neighbouring room as he undoubtedly fell on it like a cut log. Kate shot Irene a triumphant look.
“He doesn’t like brownies. Would you believe it?”
Finishing Seventh Year at Hogwarts wasn’t as grand as many made it sound. By the time they were done with N.E.W.T.s, Mycroft was exhausted. He was used to studying late into the night and into early hours of the morning, but he was glad it was over.
“What for?”
“Hold on, can you actually sing like Freddie Mercury?” Eddie asked, excitement and anticipation brightening up his face. At that, Freddie rose to his feet, smirking. He did a pirouette, shot up his hand clenched in fist to the heavens (and ceiling) as the karaoke played the instruments and Freddie sang:
They came into the kitchen. Sam was putting duct tape over a hole in the window so as to prevent water from flooding the house. John took out ice packs from the freezer, and Sherlock was suffering a good chewing out session from his sister.
“What needles?” he said quizzically, looking at John, but he shook his head.
“Our racoon friend is doing great!” Will exclaimed giddily, pointing a thumb over his shoulder in the proximity of the book. “Has a bit of a difficulty reading a few letters and distinguishing them, but otherwise? He’s a fast learner.”
I’ll leave you for the last kill, I
Lestrade groaned and clumsily scrambled out on the pier. “Fine, I’ll go check the car, just to be sure. If it’s not there, I may have left it at the Shack.”
“Yes but you’ve got to admit they’re also pretty bizarre at times.”
trying to seduce John. Imagine what she’d do if she found out that John and Sherlock are a couple!”
His cheek was pillowed on John’s chest, rising and falling steadily as fingers massaged Sherlock’s scalp, threading through the thick curls at a rhythm that had Sherlock purring. To say that his mind had shut off would be an understatement. Touching John on this level was… cathartic? Yes, sure. Certainly freeing in ways that Sherlock wouldn’t be able to conjure up on his own without first-hand experience.
Greg left for his due shower shortly after. But the realization how tiny Irene was compared to everyone else hit her in full force. For once in her life she wanted to experience being taller than the NBA players around her. However, Sherlock correctly pointed out that she wouldn’t grow an inch anymore, that prat. She’s inherited this after both her biological parents, namely her late mother whom she never met since she died during childbirth.
“Come on,” Sherlock pleaded, tucking the journal in John’s backpack. Then he wound his long arms around his neck and nuzzled his temple. “Please? I want to see cryptid birds. Where else can we ever see them?”
“Deal!” Greg grinned, shaking his hand for good measure.
Don’t tell them.
permit or build a sandcastle on the beach.” She fixed Lestrade with one last pointed look and then she nodded and winked at the two boys. “John. Sherlock. Kids under eighteen have ice cream for free.”
Greg pulled up to a grimy narrow road, fingers tapping on the wheel. Irene watched Sherlock’s face in the car door mirror -- he was fast asleep, a tiny gap between his lips indicating he would drool soon. John himself looked tired, but so did she. She blamed the sleepover.
“Yep.”
“What? No, this was my second,” John repeated, hand sliding up and down his thigh reflexively. Mary gave him an odd look, but shrugged.
“Cool. Now -- where’s my sustenance?”
“No worries.”
Once they reached John’s backpack, he was heaving and gulping for air. If this wasn’t an unexpected development on his journey home, then he didn’t know what it was. But he sure as hell didn’t see it coming.
Many thanks to my friends Bee and Dee, who beta read it for me and listened to my ideas for the fic. And thank you to everyone who reads this!
“My phone’s over there,” he jerked his head to the table and benches where his smartphone lay. If he stretched his arm, he’d reach it.
“Honestly, Sherlock! What happened to ‘don’t provoke her’?” he snapped, watching the angry ghost break hell loose.
“What?” Sherlock heard him say, and his gaze flicked towards the Adler-Holmes siblings. “You couldn’t tell me sooner? Jeez. I don’t mind, but I thought I’d be with Sherlock and Irene.”
“I’m glad. Cas, is there something you’d like to get while we’re here?”
He stepped closer, looming over Anderson. “While my brother’s deductions may be untimely at times, this was merely a logical conclusion - and to the point, rather - based on the clues you so carelessly left behind, like a piece of your torn robe. If he were running around, deducing you, you would know it. You seeked him out yourself because you still hold a grudge over your poor planning skills is immature.”
She took off her white gloves and tossed them to the front row. Three guys too eager for it got into a fist fight over them. And Mary had finally spotted John, for she winked at him and although he felt uneasiness set in, he pursed his lips and formally nodded in acknowledgement.
Sherlock limped inside first, followed by John. Closing the impala doors closed, John asked, “Where are you going?”
“Yes, uhm…. Listen, about your terrible secret…”
“And I’m here because…?”
She stepped back, avoiding his hand he stretched out to steady her further. No, she needed to think about what was going on in her head without his logical interference. Not for long, just enough to brace herself for it. Sherlock’s rationale helped, but at least once she should let her emotional side deal with it first and not repress it.
“However incredible it may sound,” Greg Lestrade said in a low conspiratory voice, “I can guarantee you that your money will disappear after submitting a part of it into this piggy bank!”
“Fucking hell!” John and Sherlock broke apart, breathless and startled like deer in headlights. “Jesus Christ on a popsicle I hate this shit so fucking much!”
The men did drop the topic, although muttering illegible complaints. The diner flow resumed after that. Some residual awkwardness hung in the air, but Angelo’s cooking aromas flooding the dining area cleared it out. Angelo thanked Sally for resolving the issue, and she saluted Sherlock, who nodded in acknowledgement.
“Who…? Where…?” his raspy voice said, and he looked at his hand in wonder, turning them over to see that he really was translucent.
“Huh. Alright, I see your logic, but it’s absolutely flawed. You can’t give her a taste and then expect her to give you up! It’s like provoking a tiger! Except that she’s not a majestic feline creature of the east, she’s a chupacabra!”
“I’ve noticed,” John snorted, biting on a potato chip. Hmm, sweet paprika flavoured. “I didn’t mean to spook him, though. It’s just that we didn’t have much time to talk when I got here earlier, and now that he was reading and didn’t hear me, I thought I’d come in and just start a conversation. But. That didn’t work out.”
“There’s one more case I’m curious about,” he said, looking up at Donovan.
“The guy was a bit shorter than you, but you’re pretty tall in general, heh,” the guy blurted out shyly, adjusting his green hat as a droplet of sweat rolled down his temple. Sherlock’s left eye twitched. “Uhm, he’s also a bit heavier in bodybuild, has a bigger belly, short brown hair, glasses, looked like a nice guy, actually.”
She tried to take a step forward, but he was faster and swung at her, causing her to cower. She growled louder, snapping at him, her razor-sharp teeth missing his arm by mere inches. He’d had enough. He raised his knee, kicking her in the jaw and pushing her off, not at all afraid to gain a few extra scratches. Who the fuck do hellhounds think they are?
“Looks good to me. What else is there to do?”
He rolled his eyes at John’s atrocious singing abilities (it wasn’t
“Oi, fuck off, mate,” Greg swore, eliciting a gasp from John.
had any other means of getting to the school!”
. But… maybe real murders are where he might draw the line? Sherlock wouldn’t force him into situations he disliked, of course not, but with John, every clue was sharper, easier to find; illuminated. John truly was a conductor of light for Sherlock, in many aspects.
“If two of the founders refused to tell us, what would make them give up the location? That is, if Gryffindor knows where it is.”
Her balled fist shot in the air, knees bending just so as she jumped up and down, her vocal cords vibrating beautifully, words rolling off her tongue, enunciation expressive just the right amount to give Janine the memo.
“Putting on dance music,” Sherlock replied, rolling his eyes.
“Thanks for the help,” he whispered, ruffling his curls. Sherlock smiled against his lips and kissed him again, entwining his arms around John’s neck and leaning into their embrace.
“Yeah that sums up every chemistry enthusiast I’ve heard of,” John had giggled. Labs were something else. “I think I’ve heard of Irene. Something about a fashion week or such thing. Like a spirit week, but college edition.”
“Git. But one thing bugs me. How come we can understand Helga and Rowena? Hogwarts was founded when, the tenth century? Shouldn’t they be speaking, like, Old English?”
“Oof, that was close,” Kate said, sitting down once more, her feet returning to their original, comfortable position.
"Be careful, Harry," he heard Sherlock whisper somewhere into his invisible direction before parting ways.
“There’s just one, that’s a disappointment,” commented Sherlock, his fingers inching to pet the petals. John reached out and stopped him before his friend made a mess out of things.
“If you want
“Be as the --”
“You’re such a caveman,” he huffed, snuggling up to him. He buried his face in the crook of John’s neck, relishing the intimacy. He could imagine them waking up like this, naked or not, summer or winter, every day for the rest of their lives.
Sherlock sighed, forcing his half-frozen legs to move forward and follow his older brother out. He was old enough to Apparate them now, which made Sherlock annoyed. Stupid rules prohibiting him from mastering these skills ahead of time…

And then there were the Houses. Slytherins, naturally, hated his guts. Harry was widely unpopular among them ever since he helped Gryffindor beat them in Quidditch and other Hogwarts competitions. Their bashful actions and words were therefore even more pronounced and reinforced since the second Hogwarts champion was from their House. The Gryffindors stood by him, enthusiastic by the prospect of Harry kicking the Slytherins’ egos once again, but that brought him no comfort. Not at all. If anything, it made him even more nervous. The Ravenclaws, who usually got along with the Gryffindors nicely, turned their backs to them. Most of the students there stuck to Slytherin, and Harry let himself be heard that they didn’t agree with his way of wanting to constantly show off. This angered him greatly, but he didn’t have energy left to try to tell them otherwise. The Hufflepuffs, however, remained indifferent. During their Herbology lesson, a couple people told Harry that they were curious how he managed to get in (
“Meep, okay,” John confirmed, planting a small kiss on Meep’s beak.
John nodded, lips pressed in a thin line. Sherlock couldn’t read his expression as openly as he did Irene, but they both let it be. “Okay, let me know if you need anything, though.” He pocketed the keys belonging to the old golf cart and gave Sherlock a passing smile and a pat on the shoulder. Sherlock longed for the physical contact to never end, but it was gone as soon as it began.
“That’s reasonable,” Greg agreed, rousing to his feet with a grunt. “At least you’re aware of your side of the feelings, that’s a nice beginning. Do you want me to sneak an answer from him?”
He settled comfortably in the passenger seat, legs splayed wide as there was more space with no one else to share it. He rested his brow on the window, eyes flickering to John’s -- Lestrade’s -- car, he and Irene already talking. A jolt of panic resonated through him at the possibility of Irene elaborating on Sherlock’s early years in middle school and highschool, but she wouldn’t take that into her own hands. It was a matter concerning Sherlock, and though he wouldn’t mind it much, he’d rather prefer it to stay in the past, locked away and forgotten. John would be troubled by the revelations, and Sherlock would rather he be spared the empathy, if only to save John from feeling bad about the past he cannot change.
“If only, no. But it’s not my place to criticise you for that so early in the morning. I’ll go and change oil in the car now, enjoy your breakfast, boys!”
Sherlock froze, eyes snapping wide open.
Sherlock ignored him, the only sign of his acknowledgement that the Gryffindor was there was that he put his index finger to his lips so John would be silent.
“Yes, I’d say so,” Sherlock said, scratching the bigger dog (it had mostly white coat with red splotches all over it) under its chin. “They have no collars or other means of identification on them, I checked. Perhaps they have microchips, but they’ve certainly been on the streets for a prolonged period of time. A guy from Animal Control almost took them, but I lied to him and said they’re my dogs. Well, mine and John’s. I said that we lost them on a hike and that we wanted to wait if they’d show up until the last two days of us visiting. It worked and the guy never questioned me. Idiot, but a good one.”
Mary backed up and regarded Irene with a superior look. “Oh, don’t think this is over. This isn’t the last y’all see of me.” She darted out to God knows where, but Irene gave zero fucks.
. Seriously, check out
The sun was barely above the horizon, the early sky soft pink that faded into orange in colour. Sherlock fumbled downstairs to the kitchen, John and Mrs Hudson already up. Mrs Hudson was, at least. John sat on a chair, back pressed against the wall, his chin propped up on his left fist, eyes closed. There was a sleek rectangular window hovering above his head that cast a halo on his fair hair. Sherlock smiled to himself and pulled up a chair, yawning.
John resisted the urge to roll his eyes. “Jesus, thanks. I wouldn’t have guessed.”
“It’s a short-headed lizard!” Sherlock said, ignoring Greg’s protests as he stood up, the little creature in his hand looking indifferent to the whole ordeal. John blinked as Sherlock grinned at the lizard, then at him, a childlike smile painting his features. “They’re quite fast, but I caught him. It’s a male, see the green colour on his body? Males have only a brown stripe of colour on their backs while the females are all brown by default. Fascinating creatures.”
” Greg hissed, looking around if someone else may have heard them. They were alone in the corridor.
“Guilty. What were you doing at the quarry for so long?”
“Are those orders, soldier?”
“Such a Ravenclaw,” Greg muttered under his breath, chuckling.
“Even you?”
"If you think so. Good luck!"
Greg nodded, lips pressed tightly together. He gulped down the rest of his lukewarm coffee. “If you need anything…”
“James is coming soon,” Gloria said, her voice echoing across the beach. The water in the lake was forced back under a low tide, revealing a number of mostly-rotten corpses and skeletons that were coming to life.
“You okay, Sherlock?” John asked, brows drawn in a concerned frown.
? John felt a pang of anxiety hit his stomach.
“Don’t you think I deserve a treat?” Sherlock said, but John was already walking out of the kitchen. Vile creature, his boyfriend. And a tease.
surprised that Heaven seemed to be corrupt. “You rebelled after you became friends with the Winchesters?”
“Ah, boys! Your food will be ready in ten minutes! Tiramisu is still in the fridge, sorry,” the man said, waving at them. “Anything I can get you on the house in the meantime?”
“Trust me, I think about it at least once a day. It depends on quite a few factors, I’m afraid.”
He scowled when his brain started considering scenarios of him and John
Footsteps in the corridor alerted her to the presence of her dear brother and John. They were talking in hushed tones. Did they think she was still asleep? When she woke up it was after ten. She didn’t sleep in
“No one got hurt,” Mrs Hudson soothed him, her voice barely above a whisper. “They actually dealt with them. Fought them like the fierce warriors they are. Oh, Greg…”
“No. But Beyoncé sounds great.”
Kate giggled. “Neither did I, but… I dunno. We haven’t seen each other in a while but we talked daily over the phone. I’m over the moon, honestly.”
And there's a new person to rile us up
Time halted for s split second. John felt the energy shift, and even Cage picked up on it. In a matter of moments, Alex Hirsch grew agitated, his primary focus settling on the wicked being before them.
“Grace and Redbeard,” Sherlock replied, and Greg’s head snapped up, blinking. Sherlock didn’t see it, his own gaze downcast, but John noted the flicker of surprise and the firmness of his mouth.
“Have a problem?” Anderson asked, glaring the Gryffindor down. Try as he might, he wasn’t scary. John faintly registered Sherlock rolling his eyes on the side.
“I like the smell of old books,” John said absently. “But yeah. That’s all we have. I never expected to see your wings. You fit in really well. It never occured to me that you might not be, you know, of human origin.”
“Simps? Simps?!” Irene repeated loudly, causing a couple guys around them shift uncomfortably where they sat, their girlfriends smirking knowingly. One girl even shouted ‘I
Blake gave him a lopsided grin, nodded, and stepped inside to allow Harry’s friend to exit as well. They didn’t change any more words, but the girl shot Blake a curious and similarly thankful smile.
In the meantime, Rosie inquisitively peered out of her seat, her pink hat with sewn-on tiny cat ears slipping off. Her hair was damp underneath, and Sherlock stopped to kneel beside her and take off her winter jacket, the hat, and her purple scarf. There’s no doubt that he can withstand the change of temperatures, but Rosie is too small to be able to bear it. They’ll put these on shortly before they leave the mall, which, hopefully, will be soon.
It turned out that hunting Irene down wasn’t a herculean task after all. The girl sat down near a statue of the town’s founder, Balexander O’Leary, a man with a beard forever sculpted to his face, a determined, wrecking look imprinted in the stone cold, heartless rock. What a legend, that man Bale. Actually, the same legend has it that he first drew a map in his dream and then found the place for this town later during his miserable, unfulfilled life. Then he burned his red jacket and danced around it in during full moon with his similarly mentally unstable friends and thus he bounded himself to eternal slavery of his own perfect ‘fantasy’ town.
John padded closer to the origins of the fight, giving in to his protective instincts. A giant tropical plant in an even bigger pot provided him the most optimal, and also ironically comical, of camouflages. He bent his head to peek at what was going on, and decided to call the security in a moment. To his horror, he saw Sherlock and Sebastian Wilkes, the former being pressed against the wall as the latter held him pinned, one hand on his shoulder, the other holding him by the wrist.
talk. You trust me more than half of the castle, and you barely know me.”
“Couldn’t figure,” murmured Ron as Harry passed him to follow Hermione.
However, he and Irene soon flipped to a page where beautiful sketches of crystals growing from the ground in various shapes and sizes. John read out loud the following description:
Greg closed the fridge at last and leaned his hip against the kitchen counter. He looked ragged and tired, the bags under his eyes even more pronounced than yesterday. Irene didn’t recall a single day when she saw him well-rested. Was he insomniac? Perhaps. Or it was his age. She wouldn’t know, she’s young and beautiful, and not Greg (no offense).
“Step-sister,” Sherlock corrected automatically. He took a pencil out of his curls and added a note to a random page. “And I
, not a toddler! Is this some sort of ploy to get at me and my husband? Did we foil your plans to take over the world? Did we ruin your ill-constructed lies? Whatever, none of that matters -- where is Rosie?! And why in the bloody hell do you kidnap children before Christmas?”
The Gryffindors and Ravenclaws were the only two houses who resided in the highest towers, but they too had to be separated by stairs… That moved on their own. The first time it happened John would have lost his balance if it weren't for the line of people behind and in front of him. Over the stairs he caught the other boy, Sherlock, looking at him again. He waved at him, but he turned away as if he were a ghost. John found it odd but couldn't give it much thought as the line of First Years moved forward.
He'll get his hands on it eventually.
Where were the brothers right now? Anticipation flooded his vessel, tickling at his skin. He wanted badly to see that the Winchesters are alright and in good health. Were they angry at him? It didn’t seem so. Dean at first, but Cas sensed a feeling of relief and fear too, strangely enough. Or his grace did.
“Where’s he from?” Sam asked, leaning on the glass display. Dean took to looking at the merch around the shop.
“No, wait! I think I’ve got something!”
“You do realise you’ve made my deduction easier by twenty percent?” Sherlock told him smugly. Well, it was about seventy percent to be exact. The fruit flavours overall got little to no reaction from John.
He thought about what he could possibly want. He already had John, the tomatoes would suffice, hm… “British tea, if you find any? Haven’t had a cuppa since… New Year’s, possibly. I miss the taste.”
“Mhm. Yay to young adulthood.” The sentence, ironically, lacked the enthusiasm that’d be otherwise expected, but it was completely understandable since adulthood is overrated. Sherlock’s been one such ‘official’ adult for a few months and it constantly felt as if life was a carousel on fire, spinning in the eternal void of the universe, aimless in its direction. Scary. And absolutely unrelated to this.
“You’re good to go,” Dean said, patting him on the shoulder.
“Yes, Irene?” he said as he handed the ice cream guy cash for the goods. He shook his head, telling him to keep the change.
The house - if it could be called that - looked like tree splinters glued together with the addition of a sign that read:
“Keep using words like ‘my guy’ and ‘dude’ and John will know immediately it’s not me.”
Sherlock trailed a finger over the vertebrae bumps on John’s spine. “Would you try it out, though? Bathing in squirrels?”
“Quite,” Sherlock quipped, his silvery gaze scanning the painting already, a forefinger tapping against his chin. “We were in search of another room, but were unsuccessful.”
“It’s okay, Grace,” he said soothingly. Redbeard was wagging his tail from his bed underneath the dining table. Cas booped his nose as he saw Irene and John do it and then left. Grace gowled when he ascended the stairs, but he brushed it off, though a prickling feeling settled at the back of his mind.
“What? I don’t think….”
“JAWN NO!” Sherlock wheezed and tried to wriggle from under his grasp, but John was relentless. “AAAH! NO! STAPH! PLEASE!”
“You mean wasps?”
“HELLO, BROTHER-DEAR!” yelled Irene, her hand grabbing him by the shoulder and shaking him.
“She does look like the flamboyant kind of girl,” the blond nodded, slowing down. They both looked up, mouths falling open.
“So,” John panted when they separated. “Found anything worth the Mystery Shack?”
“I meant ordinary by Heaven’s usual standards,” Cas explained. Irene toed closer to him and poked him in the arm. He looked at her quizzically. She flashed him a grin. “Yes?”
“I’ll let you take one thing from the gift shop, on the house.”
He could hear John’s eye roll. “I said: Would you continue boxing in Toronto? Anthea is stellar at teaching, I had classes with her too when I was younger. I can see you’re enjoying them.”
The statue had also been given a new coat in the form of ivy. Or rather, a full bodysuit piece, seeing as the succulent climbed up the dude’s legs. His hard features were unreadable, his face invisible to the outside world under the cover of green. His outstretched arm, however, gave him away. And through the fingers of his pointing hand and forefinger resided a single red rose, its petal redder than the purest blood. At the bottom of the pedestal were the initials ‘JM’.
“You as well.”
Cas nodded, understanding. “Very practical. And versatile. I like it.”
“Yes, John?” the man named Sherlock peered into the living room. His eyes widened in excitement upon seeing the three strangers in their flat.
“Hello, Mrs. Watson,” Greg said, stretching his hand to shake hers. She gifted him a warm smile and took it gracefully.
“Do I look like I’d come up with dragons myself?” Harry frowned, running a hand through his black hair. “I’m not lying, Blake. It’s dragons. Four of them, one for each of us.”
gullible. And adorable. But so are you! Aren’t you, buddy? Oh, yes. You just want some friends. Well, good news, I’ll be your friend. What’s your name, hm?”
were still in it to shield you from the wrath that’s inevitable.”
John nodded, a straightforward jut of his chin and he whistled to call the dogs. He got them ready and ushered them towards the front door. “Gonna take them on the lane -- nobody’s coming here in the afternoon and the Shack’s closed, so it will be safe to let them roam free for a bit. See ya later.”
! He missed the tiny guy!)
For the lack of a better word, small human children were a creation full of wonder and also a source of infinite exhaustion to those around them. Cas observed how Irene kept his friends busy and heaving for breath when her sugar rush spiked for the fifth time in an hour. According to Sherlock’s schedule he was supposed to mind her overnight, which he did. Irene had dozed off shortly after midnight in his bed that he didn’t use since his newly restored grace allowed him to function without sleep. All was well and her ‘junkie stage’ as John had called it seemed to be over. That was until she’d found a secret stash of candy bars. It would be fine if she hadn’t attempted feeding the dogs chocolate (inadvisable and harmful) and if she hadn’t drunk three sweet soda drinks from the fridge. Both of these things were happening simultaneously from what he was told by Sam who was supposed to be minding her then, but she was
Later that night, when Sherlock was finally alone, he unpacked his robes and clothes, remembering John’s present. He still felt bad for not getting John a present as well, but how could he know? He surely wouldn’t start now. Why would he need a holiday to give out presents and gifts? No matter.
The construction of some of the attractions? Fishy at best. Quite literally, there was a tank filled with fish of different kinds, and a guy sat on a bench above the water surface, taunting bystanders by yelling into a megaphone to try hit a lever that would send him swimming. No one was able to fulfill their revenge fantasy, unfortunately, and the guy laughed in their faces. But Irene believed that karma would be delivered sooner or later.
Words: 4032
A swat on the hip made him jerk up. “I can hear you, Sherlock,” John said, bemused. “But a movie night sounds nice. Just the two of us?”
So, I obviously also borrowed from the canon ACD story 'Gloria Scott' as I mentioned two chapters ago, but more will be revealed in the next chapter! How did you like it? Do you have any theories regarding the mystery journal? Who do you think 'L' is? :)) If you have any theories, feel free to share them, it'll be lovely to hear and read about them! My friend Dee has one started, though not about the mystery journal ;) more on that later~ But really, feel free to share your thoughts! :3

“Yeah, uh, I’d rather not get into this,” John said, toying with his tie. Sherlock gaped, and Lestrade looked smug. “But… you can be a bit blunt sometimes.”
Greg suppressed a shiver. The air around him shifted, but nothing materialised in front of him. This can’t be good.
And rewind they did. Irene stormed out first, determined to matchmake heaven and hell to perfection if it’s the last thing she does. Donna and Doctor power walked towards the City Hall, and Sherlock strolled to the park, and he’d even skip like Red Riding Hood if he were alone. A thought passed his mind -- how was John doing? Sherlock debated sending him the selfie, but dismissed the idea entirely. It will work better if it’s a surprise.
“Yeah, you’re a much better sight than a sunrise,” he said, relishing the blush that crept up Sherlock’s neck and settled on his cheekbones. His thin fingers tugged at the grass next to the blanket they were comfortably perched on. There weren’t many things that left Sherlock speechless, but John figured that firing off compliments and unexpected romantic nonsense fulfilled the deal nicely.
Cas obeyed, and Irene hugged him. He sat there, back rigid and shoulders stiff, but as Irene tightened her grip to console him, he slowly raised his arms to reciprocate the gesture, mirroring her pats. She laughed, stepping aside.
“You’re the one to speak, John. You’re also below average, how do you deal with that?”
Sherlock stood there, shocked. He didn’t even notice Irene come forward from the back of the shop, a merciless smirk on her face.
Sherlock’s mouth twitched. The way Lestrade spoke of John was that of endless affection and familial love. John held him up to the same regard, and Sherlock couldn’t be more glad that his boyfriend had at least one family member whom he could rely on.
“Grace and Redbeard.”
"Thank you. Good thing you offered, you owe me after getting me in this mess," Blake said, arching an eyebrow, though his good spirits were back. Cedric was a good friend.
Throwing the cigarette butt on dry ground, Greg exhausted it using the tip of his shoe and exhaled a cloud of smoke. John pursed his lips but refrained from commenting on it. He walked up to his uncle as Greg leaned against the car door.
“He’s
“Sherlock, be nice,” John told him, raising an eyebrow. He pouted, crossing his arms in protest. “Don’t give me that, she’s your sister -- you be nice.”
He had no reason to feel disadvantaged. Or cornered (well, that’s questionable). He owed Mary nothing. Why didn’t she ask Moran or someone ‘new’? That would save her the trouble of rejection. Because John hated social gatherings that required suits with the passion of a thousand burning suns, and he would not succumb to the pressure.
“I’ll do it!” Irene said, hurrying to the shelves. But even using the stool as leverage didn’t help her reach it. She stood on her tiptoes, balancing her body as best she could to prevent a fall, but without result. Frustrated, she hopped up, only to feel the wooden stool buckle under her feet. “Shit!”
He slept for about four and a half hours. He put the phone down and tried to drift off to Dreamlandia, though, truth be told, he considered ‘dreamland’ to be wherever it was with Sherlock by his side. Which was now. He could die in peace, sporting a gorgeous boyfriend like that.
Huffing, he looked at John’s clock once more: 6:15.
He dipped his fingers behind the belt loop on his shorts and pulled them down, stepping out of them one leg at a time. Sherlock choked on his water as he wriggled, and John kicked the shorts under his desk.
“We’ll see,” Greg said, shooting a glance to the portal. He felt worn-out and weary. He wanted Halloween to be done and over with already. “I want to give it time until John’s birthday. Then I’ll let you know. I think I’ll go now, it’s late.”
“Wait, where are they going?”
Out of the corner of his eyes, he registered a movement. He glanced sideways, not dropping his guard down. If Sherlock had been experimenting with the journal again without letting John know beforehand, this could be dangerous.
“Well that doesn’t surprise me,” Greg snorted, albeit just as sadly. It’s been long since he saw John as happy as he was around Sherlock. These two were made for each other, it was a matter of time until they got together… He thought of one particularly troubling problem that pressed on them rather tightly. “And no signs of…?”
“Well, it’s a bit of a long story,” John said, staying where he was. The knot of anxiety tying itself in Sherlock’s stomach loosened, dissipating second by second. Oof. He didn’t screw up. “But in general, I wouldn’t mind lying to my immediate family, I guess. They’ve been a pain in the ass to be around, these past few years. And… it’s not the best, you know? It’s something I did as a kid, I think as a form of self-defense. My parents are… ‘strict’ and you get tired of them constantly taking away your things. So I started lying occasionally. Nothing major, just small white lies so I could get some peace before I left for uni.”
“Henry!” the man bellowed, spraying his son in the face, which caused him to retreat. “What did I tell you? You’re scaring away our customers! Stop it at once!” He sprayed him repeatedly until Henry managed to gather enough breath to answer.
John nodded in agreement. “I’m fine too. I think I’ve got some old stuff in my closet. If it passes in three days, it’s gonna be fine by me.”
Irene struggled violently against Marina’s death grip on her legs, quiet sobs reaching Sam as he crouched underneath her. He glanced at Dean who circled the unsuspecting mermaid opposite of Sam and Irene. Sam debated his next course of action: Dean’s scythe might’ve actually been the better candidate to release Irene, but he will make do. But he will need to time it perfectly.
“Is it?”
John watched his boyfriend scratch the back of his neck, frowning. He pouted. “No. Why does it matter?”
“Bitch. Hold on, Irene, let me just -- hey!” Dean took a step back to stare at Cas, whose hand was in a compromising position near his butt. “Cas, get out of my ass!”
“I’ll bring you a souvenir if you like, his glove or something. Sherlock already has the rings from this one, it’s only fair. We’re going back through Oregon when we’re done. We’ll be visiting our great aunt Em. Who knows, maybe there will be another ghost problem when we come back.”
“Nothing. But if you want an FBI badge, you need to have this professional ‘aura’ about you. No offense, but your hair usually makes you seem a bit feral, like an aggressive crow or something.”
Into battle!
“He speaks French?”
Irene explained what went down, her empathy growing bigger for Mike’s situation. Poor guy. His best friend was swooped from him
“Meep!”
Fuck this day.
Everyone scrambled out, their legs wobbly from all the adrenaline. The pixie monster caught up with them. Thankfully there were no tourists or anyone else around to witness this. The pixies drew nearer.
Seb shrugged, checking his watch. “She can be like a shark and business oriented, but there is more going on in her head to make her decisions clear-cut and precise. She acts on her emotions, not rational thoughts. We’ll use it to our advantage.”
She shuffled where she stood, suddenly feeling ashamed. It truly was none of her business to pry. “Sorry, Greg. I don’t want to make you uncomfortable. And I didn’t want to overstep. I won’t mention it again.”
Sherlock looked up, sitting up on the balls of his feet. “I had a soft landing,” he smirked, dancing out of John’s reach.
“I’ll take the chance,” John said gruffly. He clicked his tongue as if cocking a shotgun, entwining the string around his finger. “Any last words?”
"Rules are dull, Mycroft," Sherlock said indifferently.
The man knelt before her on the floor, brows furrowed as he scanned his options. He was drawn to the six colours of the rainbow, namely tones that were brighter than the rest and nicely distinguished, but he ruled them out as too saturated. Irene let him mull over it, pushing a small mountain of purple nail polishes towards Sherlock and a bunch of glittery yellowish colours to John, but Redbeard beat him to it.
“So what’s the plan?” Irene asked, cleaning up her mess. She opened the window to let fresh air in. She looked at Sherlock, who stared at his feet, mind racing to invent checkpoints for the date. “Sherlock? Please, don’t tell me that that big brain of yours is overthinking your date with John?”
Truth be told, he transferred from Ilvermorny at the end of June, when his Aunt with whom he lived decided it would be nice to move back to her homeland, the United Kingdom. He didn’t protest, he planned on going here someday anyway, this just sped things up. It’s not like he missed Ilvermorny, he was a loner there, maybe with one exception, but his friend graduated two years ago. Adjusting to this decision was easy.
do. Well, he certainly didn’t want to seem like a nancy to John, although he would probably take his word for it. But the rest… may not be so merciful to his paranoia. Wilkes, he gave zero tosses about, but if they all ganged up on him, that would be embarrassing. He certainly didn’t want to relive some of his past experience in bullying, nor for John to witness the humiliation.
“I didn’t forget.” John let his hands roam along the length of Sherlock’s back. “I just assumed you’d be on board.”
“Soon,” her voice was cold as ice.
John was showed to a circular room with five four-poster beds; his bed had his suitcase at its feet. Carl was next to him, and three other boys he didn't know - someone named Bill, Teo, and Richard - shared the room with them.
“How funny,” Sherlock said dryly, turning to Irene, arms crossed, a hip leaning against the windowsill. “I won’t be long. Actually… there’s something I’d like to talk to you about, but we haven’t had time to sit down and chat, so….”
A feeling of deja vu overcame Sherlock, stifling his mind for a short circuit of time. He squinted at the ceiling, his brain scrabbling at bits and pieces of an odd memory resurfaced, but he couldn’t quite grasp it. As if they had lay awake like this before, but somewhere else. It fled from him, hiding in the creases of his grey matter. He blinked to get rid of the nagging, and he thought the world changed to black and white for a second. Ridiculous. His imagination has fed on the recent events and played him tonight. He needed to rest and recuperate.
“What?”
The day the news that Voldemort had perished flooded everything.
An owlish look was all Sherlock offered as an answer, stunned by John’s proclamation.
“Really? That’s great! On your way to becoming a proper Mr Detective, I see. Look at you, you’re doing great in both the supernatural and human departments.”
“No, I was reading the journal and he interrupted,” Sherlock huffed, not being really mad about it. It was more out of fear that John would find the journal ridiculous, even though Sherlock was certain it wasn’t a fake. Plus, the book said not to trust anyone. “Besides, I don’t see why he would seek me out.”
“Nothing in particular but I have to check a few assignments,” he said, leaning his hip against the counter. Lestrade opened the light blue stained window to let the smoke out before Mrs Hudson came back and found out.
“Welcome. Oh, wait.”
“Where did you even find them?” John asked, fingers tapping his knee rhythmically.
“Thank you, John,” Irene said, gulping down a handful of jelly worms. “You don’t have to cheer me up. I feel like I’m raining on your and Sherlock’s parade with this.”
Mr Ripped whacked himself in the face with a brick, the clay crumbling to dust on impact with his skull. Madison Prim was…. Curious. Several men around the diner cheered and clapped to that. The jingle ended and the telly resumed playing the news.
The pairs stuttered awkwardly at first, but quickly resolved the unexpected tension and put on their best moves. Janine managed to draw in a couple teenagers too, but it was obviously out of her comfort zone. Soon, however, her three companions joined in, shields in their own sense of the word, protecting her from the ‘peasants’ around while still making it look like she enjoyed it.
Sherlock made it a point not to look at the trashcan, or in its general direction, but his eyes flicked there for a millisecond anyway. John noticed, and following his gaze he gave Sherlock a quizzical look and went to look in it.
Speaking of which, the beast has, to its luck, obeyed and stayed where he told her to.
“Castiel explained that because John’s aura is golden-yellow and his symbol is a bee, that makes him affiliated to Heaven. Bees were apparently God’s warriors and seeing as John is, seemingly, connected to them, it makes him trustworthy to angels. He trusts him fully, and so do I, but I don’t need bees for that.”
‘I have to admit that was tortuous at the end, why does everything for a little girl have to be pink? Why can’t she want to be a fireman or a doctor, I saw some of the girl dress up outfits when I was coming out and can I just say no nurse dresses like that, female police officers don’t wear short little dresses.’
“Jesus how didn’t I see it.”
"And another time." Sherlock answered.
‘Hear me John Watson, you’d be letting those kids down, they loved your story, the school called and deliberately asked if you would be continuing the story this week because they’d love to send more kids the ones who came last week enjoyed it that much, please John, for the children’ it was a low blow and they both knew it,
“For fuck sake, Francis, I’m hardly a civilian,” Greg complained.
‘Give me the gun Greg, please God Greg, give me the gun, Samantha needs you, come on Sammy needs you, give me the gun.’ he loosens his grip on it, she’s right he should be with Sammy, he hired her, she made him coffee in the mornings sometimes, he remembers even Sherlock liked her, she made him laugh, she’s so young.
Sherlock regarded the watch silently for a few minutes before looking back to John clearly bewildered.
Mina struggled against sleep when John took her through their bedtime routine an hour later. He wrapped her tightly in her blanket and rested her in his lap on the bed in one of Mycroft’s guest rooms.
‘All I have ever wanted John is for them to be happy,’ he says it with such emotional intent that John is taken aback, he’s never heard Mycroft’s voice break in that manner, he fails to recollect a time when it’s been anything other than solid,
‘Oh Mina aren’t you clever little love’  Arriving in front of John she promptly sat again and resumed sucking her fingers, there was no reason such a small action should make John want to cry but it felt overwhelming, Mina shifted her gaze from John to Mrs Hudson and opened her arms. This John recognised and picking her up he turned to Mrs Hudson, balancing the baby as their landlady clasped her cheeks and kissed her forehead. If John saw some stray tears falling down her face he refused to mention it, looking into her face and eyes made him see Sherlock he imagined it did the same for her.
The gun like sound of his head of security barging through the door did little to settle his mind. Her gun was drawn and she pirouetted to look in every corner,she clearly perceived no obvious threat she stilled, ‘Sir, are you well?’ He knew this was protocol, he may as well have screamed he was under attack, which he felt like he was to some degree, but this warfare was of the mind not the body, ‘There is no threat Anthea, at least none present in this room. I need you to organise for the car to take me to New Scotland Yard, immediately,' he started moving on autopilot, pulling at his tie until it lays in place, smoothing his hair, collecting his jacket from the back of his chair, 'but before that I need all surveillance pertaining to D.I.Lestrade over the last twenty four hours, on paper, I will review in transit, I am assuming that can be done in under two minutes.’
“Are you alright Greg?”
They found themselves at Sam’s again, hardly a novel experience for Greg to be here twice in a day the bar keeper merely raises a hand in greeting before turning back to his patrons at the bar. Greg finds himself sat in a booth opposite a somewhat eager looking Danny, he orders a salad from the waitress; something lighter after the burger he had at lunch. He nurses the beer in front of him quietly as he contemplates how best to put the idea of Donovan’s inappropriateness into his dinner partners head. He decides to simply spell it out, better to be honest he thinks than let this carry on through what could be a nice dinner.
It was so inherently Sherlock, the sword on the wall, dark wooden frames holding antique pipes, silk slippers holding an ungodly amount of cigarettes, those he removed, it wouldn’t do to have little hands picking them up, framed scientific images; DNA structure and what John is certain is a copy of the molecular composition of cocaine, that could be thought of as rather disturbing; considering Sherlock’s addiction but John had to admit the formation of molecules was beautiful in its way.
‘I, sorry, what was that Mrs Hudson?’
‘Well it’s just I was wondering how Mycroft would choose to explain the white marks on his trousers and shoes, that’s all Greg.’ Both gentlemen go a steady shade of magenta and John can’t recall seeing anything better than Mycroft and Greg spluttering and saying the word yoghurt repeatedly. This line of questioning had definite potential, John wonders when happiness had become his default setting again, turning away from the numbness of grief; the young girl with her head rested on his shoulder was a reminder of just how recent this change was.
“Then do it.”
‘Until you can form full sentences and complete your curse words I shan’t believe you Watson, now come on’ he feels a cool stream of liquid against his lips, the shock of the icy cold against his skin is both welcome and hideous, it forces his eyes open wider, still blinded by the sun initially, and his mouth fully open.
‘Wait John, are you sure?’
‘Dr Watson,’ Anthea called from inside the car, she was still staring at her blackberry but that had long since stopped bothering John, ‘You should go into the house sir with them sir. Mycroft, he means for you to care for this little girl and she is going to need a home. Where better than here, her Father’s sanctuary.’ John considers her words as he stares to the door, Mycroft and Greg have entered the shadows of the interior and John can no longer see them.
‘No I don’t want coffee, I want to know who’s doing this and why in reality you are so desperate for this to be true.’ He wasn’t certain he’d meant for the words to leave his mouth but the truth of the sentiment was clear both in his mind and in his tone. His moment of panic earlier, the declaration that Mycroft Holmes would not take custody of this child had surprised him but in truth it came more from the desire for this poor girl to be left in peace than anything else. Imagining the test she would be subjected to if there was even a hint that this story was true disturbed him. He didn’t need the guilt of another person’s life on his shoulders.
Light footfalls pass through the snows of the Siberian woods. A thin figure moves unseen through the shadows as if made of the nights air itself. It stops for a moment between two tall trees to catch its breath, the small clouds of white proving the figure to be a mortal man and one that is running as if the figure of death were chasing him.
“Well it needs to because if not I’m going to call your boss and cause a massive fucking problem. I’m guessing that if whatever is happening is bad enough for us to be redirected, this government issued car to be judged non-secure and for Greg to get a phone call about some unknown criminal being deported, my calling Mycroft Holmes and having a fit isn’t going to help any.”
Dear John
“Ladies I think she’s had enough for one day, but she did so well, you did poppet, so well.”
‘No don’t, God I’m a fool, it doesn’t matter, pretend it didn’t happen, please, just.’ Danny turns and leaves and Greg doesn’t stop him.
‘I don’t mean to make it awkward John, you were so good last week and you seemed so happy. I thought you enjoyed it,’ She takes a step back before straightening her jacket. A glance to the clock tells John it’s nearly eleven, both of them needing sleep before having conversations like this. Tired and cranky were not ideal circumstances to find yourself in when trying to talk reasonably.
‘Because every Holmes needs a Watson of their own.’
Just the memory was enough to set Mycroft on edge. Sherlock had worn a mask for the world to see and he’d done it well. He’d only seen it slip a handful of times and it saddened him that he did not truly know the man his brother had become. There had been too much history between them at the end, but John, John had known Sherlock, his friendship making his brother a better man and so when the question really came down to who Sherlock would have wanted caring for his child, the answer was obvious, it would never have been Mycroft, it would only ever have been John Watson. How this child had come to be, he may never know, he did intend to search for the mother but he was uncertain as to where to start and the child was young enough that communication would be difficult. It did not truly matter though where she had come from, she was a Holmes by blood and he had come to realise, over the time he had been in John and Sherlock’s company, that if there was one thing a Holmes would need to be happy it was a Watson.
“What about you and Mycroft then? How’d that happen?”
‘The man, the one with the knife, do we know who he is?’
Mycroft was just staring at the image, his eyes moved across the face seeming to catalogue her features, no doubt comparing them to Sherlock’s when he’d been the same age. He’d see it John knew he would but he didn’t want to wait to do something. Seconds were slipping by and the idea of this child being with someone besides the three of them was killing him. Was she with someone who had known Sherlock, someone who believed he was a fraud, John couldn't have that, he wouldn't have her hearing those things about Sherlock.
‘Her father was inquisitive so it wouldn’t come as a surprise, I would take those back though she’ll likely chew them.’ Removing the glasses earns him a squeak of annoyance from his daughter but John imagines it’s safer than letting her chew on them, ‘Oh and I have no problem with the colours I just figure she shouldn’t be restricted you know, I want her to figure out what she likes, be it princesses’, John bends down and presents his daughter with the teddy she’s been eyeballing since John removed Tammy’s glasses, ‘or apparently Ewoks, really little cuddly Ewoks?’
NO SLEEP.
There were general outbursts of shock from Greg and Mrs. Hudson. Greg was demanding to know how Mycroft could have missed an assassin entering Baker Street, wasn’t it always under surveillance? John heard all of this, he remembered the man walking past him and even on the day Sherlock had jumped he’d been in the hall; standing over Mrs. Hudson he could see it in his head. John heard Mycroft’s muttered apologies to a distraught Mrs. Hudson and an explanation of how someone, Moriarty or Moran, had changed the feed to a recorded section from the day before. It had been well done but was not flawless. Mycroft hadn’t been watching because Sherlock hadn’t been in residence. He had believed any danger would follow him to Barts, which as it turned out the majority did.
Mycroft looked uncomfortable but John held his gaze.
She does so with a gasp, inside are three typed up outlines for stories based on his cases with Sherlock and a complete copy of A Study in Pink, rewritten in his 1920’s universe. He’d found it easier than he expected to get lost in a fictional world and the period research he needed to do for the case rewrite.  ‘Are you serious right now?’ John nods his head while Tammy breaks out in a happy dance. He catches her as she flings herself at him, she’s an awkward height for this type of hug bug he appreciates the sentiment.

Tabloid headlines read; ‘John Watson still deluded!’, ‘Genius commits suicide while lover looks on’, ‘I still believe in Sherlock Holmes: why John Watson became the most deluded doctor in Britain.’
CIGARETTES
“Yes, we have reason to believe that Moran is reforming Moriarty’s network. Mr Mitrović, you will know him as Mr. Red, Gregory, has given us reason to believe that the network is reforming, or more accurately that it never broke down as we imagined it would. Our intelligence, as it is, suggests that Moran would be the logical front man for such an operation. There is however another reason this concerns us. Mr. Mitrović during his interview made threats against the family in order to intimidate me into action.”
He watches from the sidelines as Sally commandeers a pool table and starts racking the balls, they’d had to leave Claire in the office along with a few other members of the team but Sally’s never short of opponents,
“And that is why you cracked his ribs?”
‘Please don’t wake up, please don’t wake up’ he muttered while waiting silently to hear any noises from Mina. None came, John was so thankful he almost forgot to scowl and Tammy when she flounced through his front door moments later brandishing a bag of what smelled like Chinese take away. Thursday night was steadily becoming John and Tammy movie and take out night a tradition which although young was providing John with something to look forward to again, his life had become more solitary while he was living with Sherlock, John had failed to realise the degree to which his life had revolved around the genius during those last few months of his life and now, with Mina, John had little opportunity to socialise with his former friendship circles, few of the rugby lads had children and his friends from the army seemed to find it difficult to relate to civilian life. Not to mention the fact none of them knew how to handle to dead housemate, best friend, potential criminal live bomb that was Sherlock, in life they’d been able to ignore his existence for the most part but in death they seemed to find it near impossible. John couldn’t say he found his life to be lacking without them but it had left him lonely.
‘It seems as if our tour will have to be postponed Doctor Watson, I doubt Mycroft will object to us continuing it at some later point.’
'I need you to come down to the station. As soon as possible really, this is quite time sensitive and before you offer, it needs to be you, not your staff’
Greg moved, he gave Mycroft a chance to withdraw but the man seemed frozen in place. His lips were parted slightly and Greg rose onto his toes slightly to press their lips together. He kept his kiss soft, a brief brush of lips before sinking back so his feet were flat on the ground.
She was malnourished, underdeveloped, dirty, entirely silent and lacking in love. From the reports his team had been bringing in there was a high likelihood of abuse and as no one could find or identify the girl’s mother lord knows how the little one had ended up in that hellhole, ‘John I know it’s hard, none of us know what to do, but the DNA says she’s his. What can we do?’
Oh, no.
John froze on the spot, mouth hanging low as he tried to process this. But he couldn’t stand idly when a vulnerable creature was fighting for its life! He shrugged off his backpack, reaching for his hunting knife. He crept in closer, trying to use the trees to his advantage. He crouched behind a large fallen trunk overgrown by moss and mushrooms, observing to see if there were more offenders in sight. It appeared that there was only the man - same height as John, certainly not from around here judging by the knife he had.
“Maritime biology has never been my strongest suit, but it’s hella cool. What’s your name?”
She fluttered her long eyelashes at him. “Hm, maybe it will be the mysterious John guy we haven’t met yet?”

He proceeded to reach into the pot and threw a handful of soil in Cas’ face, minutely stupefying him as he jerked backwards to clear his sight. Caged danced out of his reach, racing around the corner while shaking his Barbie rear end merrily at the (now very angry) angel.
John immediately stopped, eyes still wide with shock, slowly turning to face the taller Ravenclaw.
here it is, folks, the longest episode to date! this is where the story *really* starts to take off
, eh?”
So, school said 'fuck you' to me and flooded me woth work. That's why we didn't come to a conclusion of their whole third year this chapter, sorry folks. Anyway, we got... kinda in the head of Sherlock and saw some interesting... developments? Yeah, our boy is getting attached already, but he doesn't know what it is yet himself, hah.
“You yourself are quite the sight to behold,” Sherlock told him, his gaze dreamy when he looked at John.
“Yeah, sad life I have, huh?” the mirror said, giving him a lopsided smile. “Now, give me a highfive you madlad!”
so on the 5th I left to see my cousin's, from where I went to my uni signup the next day, and I forgot my laptop and I returned on the 7th
“Yes, Bumble?”
“Uh, sure? Sam, get my wallet. In my back pocket. My hands are full.”
“Good. Now, shall we get to it?”
dragged John here against all odds, ha!
Mrs Hudson’s ‘out of bounds’ room wasn’t nearly as unique as he’d hoped. Sure, it was stashed with wools of distinctive origins, top to bottom, but he expected a lair of… whatever else. Something evil, maybe? Not in a bad way, just sinister enough to cause her to be rightfully fussy about it.
‘What part would you like to discuss Gregory,’ His name sounds more like a purr than anything, this man is the only one that still uses his full name and Greg reckons it shouldn’t sound as sensual as it does,
‘In all honesty I don’t know what to tell you, he wasn’t a fake, he was as amazing as he seemed, he could deduce almost anyone in a matter of seconds, he was my best friend and I miss him. He wasn’t really a hero though, he was definitely not a villain but he was selfish, self righteous, he had a superiority complex to rival anyone, the man was a genius but he never considered how his genius could hurt others.’
‘Mr Holmes, are you still there?’
“Of course not Mrs. Hudson but…” Francis tried in vain to bring the car back to a calm sanity and failed dramatically.
The following chapters were divided into two because of their length, the first is John centric to second follows Greg. MJ.
“Yep.”
‘My parents would be happy to fit around your schedule, this is kind of you John, they will stay for the duration of their visit with me and perhaps I might be bold enough to suggest you and Mina visit with them there. My property has slightly more space as well as the benefit of a staff that can handle preparations.’
‘You want to talk about it?’ Mycroft looks amused at his offer, he supposes they’ve never really been close but over the past month the man’s been in his home most days and they’ve spoken on the telephone at least once a day, granted those conversations all centred around Mina but he’s grown to care about Mycroft somewhat, and he’s a natural caregiver so offering support has always come naturally.
‘If you say so’ Lisa looks towards him and for the first time he thinks he sees something like annoyance in her expression.
Why is it John? Am I not good enough? Or is it simply my lack of a fucking vagina.
“Numerous things, but one of the biggest was a wave of attacks members of their network are being subjected to across Russia and Eastern Europe. “
SNOW.
John startled awake, the last breath he had taken while asleep still clouded the car window he had been resting against.
“John.” It was Greg this time reaching out to calm John but he was too riled.
Mycroft stiffened in response.
‘No, She’s nice and all but you see,’ there’s a pause where Greg feels the awkwardness increase, has he insulted him, is he about to insult Sally, that could get ugly, ‘It’s just I’m gay so she’s really not my type.’
“I think I would be amenable Gregory. I do so enjoy your skills.”
“Why is that?” John asked. He was half listening to Francis and half trying to listen in on Greg’s side of the phone conversation.
‘Yes he’s sat opposite me right this second, look, just, please.’ The note of desperation in Gregory's voice was the deciding moment for him, he may not have been a slave to sentiment like so many others but he owed these men a debt, his family did at least, and he would be damned if he failed to come through for them.
You never reject me in these moments John, when I am soft and vulnerable against you, when you think you have the upper hand. I think this is my brains way of navigating your perceived heterosexuality and the heteronormativity that you seem to have decided accompanies your romantic relationships'. You do not belittle your partners John, I would never infer that, you like strong women and I believe would like strong men. But at the same time you like women who allow you to play up to the traditional/ stereotypical male role and take on the responsibilities inherent within that during these interactions, I can not imagine you allowing a woman to penetrate you sexually.
“Goodbye Denise. If you need to talk have your lawyer call mine.”
‘I do not pretend to know John, I cannot imagine he would have allowed her to exist within the place she did. Perhaps he lost track of the mother during his stay and believed them missing? We will never know what we do know is that in a short amount of time delivery men will be arriving to remove a bed from one of the bedrooms. Your daughter is going to need a bedroom and you will need your space.  If you allow Anthea the key to your current residents she will arrange for your belongings to be brought here.’
‘Alright then, look I’m going to invite you to something because Mrs. Hudson thought you might want to come and honestly I think it could be good for you but I want you to feel up to it and just, if you don’t want to I completely understand.’
‘Civilians Secure’
Hi lovely people,
‘I can be there in ten minutes, keep the child in the station or wherever she is and do not let John leave without someone accompanying him.’ It must be imperative to keep John from being driven to any rash decisions or actions. The man had been made unstable by his brother's vicious end, he could hardly blame him, he had witnessed the recording after the fact, the moment he had been notified he had set of running from his office, his feet carrying him at speeds he was unaware he possessed, he was still too late, his security team held him back at the edge of the building, Anthea cradling the sides of his face, wiping the tears he wasn't aware had fallen from his cheeks, before forcing him into the back of a car. He had lost him, he had failed him, it had all been his fault. He had fallen to his knees in the back seat, his face pressed to his assistants knee as she threaded her fingers through his hair, it had just been the two of them and he had let himself fall apart, he knew he had allowed that monster to pull in his brother and now he had lost him.
Mycroft stood stunned while Anthea reacted on his behalf, she span her weapon and held the barrel to pistol whip the side of the head of the grinning behemoths head. Mitrović sank into unconsciousness, curled on the floor still shackled.
‘Yes dear but it’s in a box, come down and we’ll find a knife to open it.’
Mycroft seems to fall on his chair with his exhale of breath,
“And this call to the Russian delegation, does it have anything to do with sending my key suspect back to his bloody homeland?” Greg groused.
Greg shrugged. “A little mess never put me off. Besides, they’re underestimating us.”
“There’s no need to thank me, Gregory, it’s my pleasure. When you have settled for the evening would you call me again? There are a few things I believe we should discuss.” Greg promised he would while climbing out of the car towards the open front door where the agent, Francis, was waiting. Greg introduced himself and listened to the man’s explanation of the security system and an outline of the house. Greg waved him off before parking his car in the garage.
John sighed. On nights such as this there's was only one answer that came to mind. He walked in to the kitchen and turned on the kettle. He fetched down two mugs, one decaffeinated Yorkshire gold tea bag and one chamomile.
