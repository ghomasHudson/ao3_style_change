Once Castiel had revealed his fear that Dean might kick him out of the bunker if he became human again, Dean had apologised profusely, and promised that it would never happen again. The sincerity of Dean’s apology made Castiel feel safer and more cared for than he had in a very long time, and he smiled at the memory.
His mixture of emotions made him unable to say anything. He saw Cas rush out of their room and out towards the sound, immediately scolding Jack from playing with Dean’s things. Dean heard Jack apologize, then saw as both Cas and Jack realized Dean was watching and heard the two of them begin their apologies to him. He waved them off in lieu of responding and announced he was going to take a shower.
The following morning he was definitely very groggy and poured himself a larger cup of coffee than usual. He hid in the kitchen after waking both Jack and Claire up like they’d asked him to do so that they would both be able to hear Cas’s reaction.
“Uh oh, now David’s gonna tell you how they met, and how Patricia saved his life. It’s so wholesome,” Mandi rolled her eyes and pretended to walk away.
Each morning Castiel basically tore the kitchen apart trying to get the kids fed while packing their lunches. Boxes still lined the hall, though Castiel spent hours every day after dropping the kids off trying to unpack. And since the kids’ rooms weren’t exactly set up completely, they had both taken to searching through the boxes to find the toys they wanted which left the rest of the house cluttered.
“Yeah but I… I was really mean to daddy,” she admitted, sounding heartbroken. “I think that made them worry more.”
The more time passed, the easier it became for Dean to not mention it; hell, he hadn’t even brought up Cas making a deal and keeping it from him and Sam. Cas hadn’t shown any signs of repeating what he’d said, or wanting to discuss it further, and there was no change in his behaviour towards Dean, so it quietly faded into the background. They were always friendly enough to each other, but a lot of the time they kept out of each other’s way, mostly interacting only when absolutely necessary.
He rarely saw Cas in anything but his full ‘tax accountant’ get up, and it was a sight to behold. Cas’s arms were nicely tanned, and as he dug the soil and added the mulch, Dean could see the ripple of muscles under his skin.
It was Sam’s turn to laugh then, and it took him a few seconds to calm down enough to speak. “And I thought you might be upset if I suggested it. Maybe we’re all dumbasses.”
“Claire explained to me what happened when we got home and I felt like it was too important to not address. Claire, can you give her the essay?”
“Yes?”
Dean quickly paid for the items, then hurried back out to Baby to hide them away in the trunk, before rushing back inside to find Cas. It didn’t take him long because Cas hadn’t gone far at all; in fact, he was still in the flower section nearest to the entrance, and was closely examining some roses that were a deep shade of purple.
Dean wanted to scream for Cas’s sake. He wanted to run down to whatever office building it was and curse at them for ruining what should have been a great morning. He wanted to scream at them for being idiots and not taking Cas for this position. He wanted to do anything he could to make this better for his best friend but he knew all he could do right now is be there for them.
Dean grimaced. “Man, we really fucked up with the whole communication thing, didn’t we?”
But it wasn’t just fear of a failed living situation or needing to start over. It was fear of rejection. Fear of Dean’s rejection specifically, that made it hard for Cas to even try and talk.
The words ‘clothes off’ were on the tip of Dean’s tongue, but Cas was doing something incredible with his tongue to Dean’s nipple, and all he could manage was, “Cas…
He was still standing like that when Dean came outside, startling him as he spoke.
“You know I’m sorry about that, right, Cas? I should never have listened to Gadreel and left you to fend for yourself like that. It was such a shitty thing to do.” Dean stared down at his plate, shame washing through him at the memory of what he’d done to his best friend. It was unforgivable, but sadly, not the only bad thing he’d done to Cas in the years they’d known each other.
Just as had happened on the other mornings, Castiel got out of bed before Dean, trying his best not to disturb him. Making his way downstairs, he thought back on the previous evening, and how pleasant it was.
Castiel couldn’t really argue with that logic, although he felt a slight pang that Dean didn’t suggest they should do something more romantic to convince the ghost they were a couple. He knew there was zero chance of that happening though, so after telling Dean that his plan was a good one, they took their bags out of the trunk, then brought them into the house.
“Want to tell me about it?” He didn’t expect her to say anything, especially since they’d only recently been growing closer so he was surprised when she chose to tell him.
“I understand. I would be angry with me too if I were in your position. I just hope you know that I did not intentionally mean to hurt you. I wanted so badly to keep us in our old home and keep you at your old school with all of your friends. I tried, sweetheart, but I just couldn’t make it work. And I know you’re going to be angry with me for a while, and it’s okay to feel that way, but I need to ask you to not take it out on your brother. He is sad about moving too, he had to say goodbye to all of his friends too. He is going through the same thing you are and needs you to be there for him, not to pick on him and make him hurt more.”
Dean leaned forward and kissed Cas again, a little harder and longer this time. Cas sighed into it, and when Dean pulled back, Cas was smiling dopily at him.
Cas lifted his gaze from the ground and stared at Dean with a look of irritation. "I don't care what she thinks of me, Dean. And anyway, I don't have any other clothes."
“My mother insists we have lunch with her on Sunday.”
“Claire, you want to pick the movie for us?” Dean asked after placing their order.
Dean had never seen Cas smile so much, and that smile only grew wider when they walked into the place. There were flowers of every colour and variety, trees, bushes, soil, fertiliser, gardening tools, books… even a souvenir shop, and Cas looked like he was in Heaven.
it felt impressive.
“Cas.” He gave Cas a withering look, invoking all the
Grabbing a bottle and turning back to look at Cas, Dean noticed how he was practically nursing his new coffee mug, as if it was something precious. The wave of feelings that scene provoked almost stopped Dean in his tracks, but no… he wouldn’t be deterred from his mission.
When Cas smiled and did a little spin for them, Dean realized that even years after accepting that he was going to be the cool uncle with the classic car who could build all of Claire and Jack’s furniture; after getting used to the place in Cas’s life and in Claire an Jack’s life, he’d never been able to fall out of love.
As a form of apology, Dean whipped up some french toast and left it out for Cas to find before taking his own plate out to the garage. He didn’t want to make too much noise so he spent the better part of his morning doing any hand sanding he’d been putting off, painting, staining, and finishing some other pieces that he hadn’t been able to get to either.
They stood frozen at the open doorway watching as Rich walked away towards the apartment offices.
They turned back towards the clothes hoping Dean wouldn’t notice the flush creeping up their cheeks.
Cas tilted his head, but there was a sly smile playing on his lips. “My fake FBI skills?”
Mimi stepped closer and smiled at him kindly. “Ah, don’t worry. It’s only obvious to me because I’ve seen you more relaxed. But we’ll look after you, won’t we, Dean?” she added in a playful tone.
Cas looked thoughtful for a second, before nodding then walking further along the aisle and stopping at a stunning array of orange roses. After placing a plant of that colour next to the purple one, he chose one each of red, pink, yellow, and white.
Castiel had never heard Dean talk about their friendship like that before, and it was astonishing how validated those words made him feel, even though it was an exaggeration to say that Dean had always trusted him since then. There had been numerous incidents over the years, but one in particular stood out in his mind; when Castiel had been working in secret with Crowley, before swallowing all the souls in Purgatory, Dean had at first refused to believe it, and then when he couldn’t ignore the truth any longer, the betrayal he’d felt had been acute. The pain and bad feeling between them lasted until they were catapulted into Purgatory, and resurfaced after his return when he was being brainwashed by Naomi. There had been a time when he’d wondered if they would ever be able to move past that, but he didn’t really want to dwell on it, because it was too painful to think about. Ultimately, Castiel figured that although things weren’t perfect between them at the moment, Dean focusing on the positive elements of their friendship felt like a good sign.
“Yes, Dean?” Sam replied.
Castiel had begun to notice something strange about Dean. Every time Sam mentioned a case, Dean would either dismiss it as ‘not our thing’, or call up another hunter to deal with it.
And like the asshole Cas was, Dean was shot with the mother of all puppy dog eyes and he couldn’t even be bothered to pretend to be put out.
Cas smiled at him as if he’d just had the best thought ever. “
“Hey, Cas,” Dean called to his friend to get his attention.
“Yeah she does,” Kelly said proudly.
“We will. And you’re welcome to drop by our place, 'k?”
“There’s nothing to worry about. If a parakeet is able to go through this twice a year, what makes you think I’m not? I’m perfectly capable of dealing with this on my own, Dean.” He reached behind his shoulder to scratch himself, scowling when the itch apparently wouldn’t go away.
Once Dean had disappeared back inside, Castiel walked around to the side of the house and leaned against the wall. He couldn’t avoid Dean forever - he knew that - but he wouldn’t rush back into the house either. A rustling in one of the bushes caught his attention, and he waited to see if whatever creature it was would reveal itself.
“You’ve worked real hard on this, and it shows. I love how you’ve arranged the different colours.”
“No, not like ducks. I’m not a
“It seems like I burned breakfast,” Cas said helplessly, pointing towards the frying pan.
Castiel pointed out of the room, towards the other set of stairs. “We haven’t seen everything yet.”
Walking into the bar, Castiel started to doubt their clothing choices, worried they’d get unkind looks from strangers and ruin the mood but their doubts started to wash away when Dean’s hand rested on their lower back, protectively, as they walked through the tables. That small gesture brought back the confidence they had been feeling before they left. If Castiel liked the way they looked that night and Dean did as well, then they weren’t going to dwell on anyone else’s potential opinions.
Castiel glared at Dean who glared back with equal intensity.
“Great… great.” Bob nodded, before staring down at Castiel’s left hand. “No wedding ring though, I see. You guys never thought about making it official?”
But there was something else that was bothering him too; something that Dean didn’t know anything about. When Castiel was on his call with Sam earlier, Sam expressed frustration at the lack of any progress regarding the ghost and had proposed a solution.
There was an air of pain and sadness in the air as Dean stared at him, and Castiel got the impression that Dean was regretting disturbing him at all. He gestured back towards the house, saying, “I, er… made some dinner. I thought you might be hungry.”
“Sure, Sammy.” Dean was about to press the end call button when Sam spoke again.
“Awww, c’mon. Don’t knock it ‘til you’ve tried it. Let me give you my number, in case you change your mind.” Bob winked, and held his hand out as if he was expecting Castiel to give him something.
“I’m sorry he was playing at your desk,” Cas said. They sounded sincere, truly, and on a better day, Dean may have been able to bite his tongue and accept it and move on. But today was not one of his better days.
Castiel smiled after them before turning to Kelly and stepping into a greeting hug.
“I… I told them I wished they weren’t my dad.”
They eventually made their way into Dean’s garage and there, the sight of Cas sitting on the counter next to Dean’s toolbox, ready to hand Dean any tool he needed made Dean’s heart stutter in his chest. It was a sight Dean had ingrained into his memory from years ago, laughing and joking while Dean worked. He used to be able to get Cas to try their hand at woodworking too but his friend had been kind of useless at it and was usually too timid to even go near the wood saw. Cas did like to paint, stain, or finish Dean’s work but it had been years since they’d had the time to do so.
Sam and Eileen arrived just before two, and after enthusiastic hugs all around, Dean and Cas led their visitors to the kitchen to eat. Sam gave Dean a suitably impressed glance at the food Dean served up, but he lasted precisely a minute and a half before the questions began tumbling out.
Dean also didn’t seem to mind in the slightest that she had left them, and although Castiel had expected Dean to let go of his hand once she’d walked away, he didn’t. In fact, he began rubbing his thumb back and forth over Castiel’s knuckles, in a soothing gesture.
“It’s William,” Cas whispered from beside him.
“It’s the lying that makes me uncomfortable. Deceiving these people about us… you and I.” It was, of course, only a half-truth; Castiel wasn’t about to reveal to Dean the pain their pretence was causing him, and he didn’t even mention the disaster that their friendship had become in the last few days, which on its own was the reason for much of Castiel’s anguish.
“No.”
“I’ll talk to Cas and Kelly but I’m sure they’ll be fine with the switch.”
Castiel mused on this as they were introduced first to Brian’s wife Rebecca, then to the rest of the dozen or so people already gathered in little groups. Castiel stuck closely to Dean’s side as they met Nicole, Patricia, David, James, Heather, Shelley, Mandi, Mark, John, Bob, Simran, and Akhil. A number of children were also pointed out to them as they ran around; Nisha, Sashi, Chloe, Emily, and Oliver, but it seemed they were too busy enjoying themselves to be properly introduced.
“Do they–do they like it here?” He eventually asked, turning and setting Cas’s plate of food in front of them. Castiel didn’t know how to answer and it appeared by the look on their face alone, Dean already knew the answer to his own question. “It’s okay. You don’t have to lie. I might’ve overheard them saying they weren’t happy here.”
“Dean, I’m fine. I’m home. I just need your advice.”
Then they were in bed together in a sleazy motel room, but after that, there were mercifully few scenes of an intimate nature.
“What? Like I’m old looking now?” Dean joked, trying to milk the compliment for all it was worth. Dean knew Cas liked this movie for the plot but he also knew Cas’s celebrity crushes and Richard Gere was just under Harrison Ford on that list.
“What if I need to use the toilet later? I don’t want to go through the process of having bowel movements ever again.” When Cas looked up, his eyes were so full of horror that Dean had to break out in laughter.
He heard the sound of footsteps once more and walked out to meet Cas at the bottom of the stairs. Cas had picked one of Dean’s henley’s and was tugging at it uncomfortably as they hit the bottom step.
She didn’t seem so sure. “What about Daddy?” She asked, and Dean knew she was worried about how everything would make Cas feel. He was surprised how in tune Claire was with the way Cas was struggling emotionally lately. He knew Cas didn’t like that she worried but Dean was glad that his best friend had another person looking out for them.
“I don’t have any,” Claire replied, obviously lying.
“Sounds riveting.” Dean tried really hard to keep the sarcasm out of his voice, but considering the way Cas looked at him afterwards, he’d probably done a piss poor job of it.
Dean could’ve said so much at that moment. He could’ve told Cas just how much Cas had done for him over the years. He could have told his friend all the amazing things they did for everyone in their lives. He could’ve said he was doing all this because Cas was the most important person in Dean’s life but he couldn’t form those words quite yet. Instead he said, “Because I care about you a whole fucking lot.”
“I’m not a baby!”
“Just help,” she growled but Castiel could see the faint twitch of a smile.
After they’d finished eating - yes, Dean did empty Castiel’s plate - Dean got Castiel another beer, and a soda for himself.
Castiel had always loved nature in all its magnificent glory, and he stayed outside until dusk began to fall, happily exploring the garden and imagining what he might grow if they weren’t leaving in a couple of days.
The letter - dated 22nd February 1953, and addressed to someone called William - could only be described as a passionate declaration of love, full of sentiments like ‘my darling William’, ‘being parted from you is so hard’, and ‘I long to be held by you again’. Sure, it was no Penthouse Forum letters page offering, but nevertheless it felt too intimate to read out loud to Cas. Maybe it was because the Penthouse letters always seemed made up, but the one in his hand was indisputably real. Or maybe it was something to do with the fact that he and Cas were still avoiding what Cas had said in that storage room... or probably a little of both.
A tap on his shoulder got his attention then, and he turned to see Bob smiling at him.
Armed with a bucket of soapy water, glass cleaning spray, cloths, and paper towels, Dean got to work on the windows. He was relieved to discover that each window swivelled around, so he was able to clean the inside and outside of each one with little difficulty.
“You’re so sweet.”
Cas sighed and stood up, then headed for the French doors, saying, “I’m… I’ll get back to my gardening.”
“Oh, right, I was meant to fix that,” Castiel confessed. They couldn’t contain their sigh as they shuffled over towards the machine, praying that it would be an easy fix this time.
“Should I change?”
As Castiel stared at the photo, he noticed something in the bottom corner, and he zoomed in to get a better look. It looked very much like a flash of orange fur inside one of the bushes, and sure enough, when he turned to look at the actual spot in the garden, he could see a little face peeking out at him.
Dean looked at Castiel in question, replying with a “yes” when Castiel gave him a nod. While Dean had been shaking Mimi’s hand with a silver spoon held in his palm, Castiel had quickly put some holy water on his thumb from a small bottle in his pocket. He copied Dean and shook Mimi’s hand, making sure to swipe his thumb across her hand.
“Oh God, Sam owes me 20 bucks.”
“Fine,” she answered with an eye roll.
Dean clapped his hands together decisively. “Oh, yeah. Lead the way; maybe we’ll find something up there.”
With the hardest part out of the way, Dean waited for his friend to return and hoped they’d be able to fix this before it got any worse.
Castiel looked to Dean. Though they knew their friend was just joking, there was a huge part of Castiel that wanted to say,
Cas spotted Dean in the kitchen spraying down the counters with disinfectant. To help in Dean’s nightly cleaning routine, Castiel grabbed the broom and started sweeping the crumbs off the floor.
“I’m fine,” they forced out but it was hoarse. Neither of them truly believed Castiel was fine.
“Well, don’t leave us hanging, man. I wanna hear this wholesome story,” Dean said enthusiastically.
But then they met up again, and
“I just wish I could’ve been there.”
“Very funny, Dean,” he said, before taking in their surroundings. There were three rooms on this floor, and a smaller staircase, presumably leading to the room inside the dome.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean swung the bar at William’s ghost, as he tried to make sense of this unexpected twist. There was no doubt it was William, but how could that be? Wasn’t he the ghost’s first victim?
“Dean, no, I won’t ask that of you. Claire needs someone to help with homework, and then both of them would want to play and they’d just make a huge mess, and then they’d need dinner and… it’s too much to ask you.”
“It’s too quiet,” Cas agreed, looking off towards the dark hallways off the kitchen.
It was Film Studies that Dean had sat next to the most pretentious, uppity, asshole known to man. At least that’s what Dean’s first oppression had been when he’d seen the person sitting next to him wearing a button up, slacks, and a vest to a class that most others were wearing ripped jeans and dirty sneakers. He hadn’t expected to talk to the snobby rich kid, but once their professor had gone through the syllabus and told them of the movies they would be studying, Castiel had leaned over and whispered how they’d never heard of a single one of those movies.
“How old is Jack?”
seen. The answer had been disappointing and Dean decided right then and there he needed to show Castiel every classic movie known to man.
Castiel put the cat back down and sipped on his coffee again as Dean kissed him gently on the cheek.
“Thank you, love.”
But not before Dean whispered, “I love you too,” into Cas’s ear.
Sighing, Dean was about to go back down to the kitchen and start preparing dinner, when he stepped on a loose floorboard along one wall. It was creaky as fuck, and he wondered if there was a hammer and nails in that shed.
Dean could already tell Cas was shaping up for a bad day. He hoped for his friend’s sake that it wasn’t going to be made worse by some of the awful customers who walked in and out of the gas station at night.
The cat crept forward and rubbed her head against Castiel’s hand as she purred contentedly. Picking her up, Castiel held her against his chest and stroked her head, wondering if she might be able to stay in their house too.
Rage filled her features. She was so angry lately and it killed Castiel that they didn’t know what to do for her. Castiel had called Kelly many nights trying to figure out what they needed to do but Kelly just kept saying the same thing,
“Let’s figure this out, okay?” He held her in the hug for a few moments before pulling back and swiping at some of her stray tears. “I remember when I used to help Sammy with his multiplication facts. He used to sing some songs to help him remember.”
Dean wandered back in the house an hour or so later to grab some water but was set off course by the sound of cursing from the bathroom.
Cas put down his Bible, and crossed the room to lean against the wall. “I believe that what Sam is trying to tell you, is that unless there is a same-sex couple in the house, the ghost will not show itself.”
A moment of doubt crept in, and Castiel wondered if he should let Dean go. But no… he had to get this over with. Gazing deeply into those green eyes he loved so much, Castiel saw fear and uncertainty, and Castiel knew he had to do it now, before he changed his mind.
“No, that’s what I was trying to tell you. I took it upstairs, and… it’s in the closet in the bedroom.”
Castiel allowed Claire the silence she seemed to need, only breaking it to ask which box or suitcase she wanted some of her favorite items. They could sense she still wasn’t happy with needing to move again but she was no longer openly hostile towards them and that felt like a win in Castiel’s book.
Sam sat back as Dean gaped at him, because…
n on his laptop and connected it to the TV. He’d made some popcorn, so he went back to the kitchen to bring that and a couple of beers through to the living room, where Cas was waiting on the sofa.
Cas blinked a couple of times before saying shyly, “I, um… no. I was just admiring the colour.”
They’d tried to make it work, and for almost 3 years they thought it would but then their savings started to deplete as they tried to make the monthly payments. Then they made the gut wrenching decision to take from their retirement but even that still wasn’t enough. Their home at that point was only 10 years into it’s 30 year loan–a loan on a house Castiel thought would be paid by both their three-figure salary and Kelly’s.
he would wait until he was in the shower.
Just then they heard a car pull up out front, and moments later a voice rang out after the car’s door opened and closed.
The two of them had cleared out some space in Cas’s closet, finally throwing out the shirts that were no longer salvageable. But because Dean was Dean and knew how to do practically everything, there were a few shirts Dean was able to sew the buttons back onto for Cas to keep. As if Castiel didn’t need another reason to think Dean was absolutely perfect.
Cas followed him, but he went back to his flowerbed. Dean failed to see what was so fascinating about a patch of bare soil, but he left him to it and went to search the shed.
“Like what?”
“Yes. Please tell me.” There was that muffled sound again, then silence when Dean spoke again.
Spotting the tin box at the end of the kitchen counter, Castiel slid it towards him and began reading through the letters once more. The heartbreak of William and Richard’s story hit him again, as he fumed at how ridiculous it was that so many humans had such a problem with any love that wasn’t heterosexual. Jack and Ennis, William and Richard, Dean and Castiel… whether they were real or fictional, it seemed their love was doomed. Castiel immediately berated himself for daring to list Dean and himself with those other couples; quite apart from any other obstacles that might exist, Dean clearly didn’t think of Castiel in that way.
“Your teacher wrote this?” Dean asked in disbelief, feeling himself grow angry by the red marks. Claire was still glaring at the paper when she nodded.
They had white, black, and navy already in their hands when Dean held the same button up but in purple.
It was true; unfathomably, Castiel had received unwelcome attention of that nature too many times to count. He sighed, “No, it’s not.”
He’d placed a number of iron objects around the house in readiness for this moment, and luckily there was an iron bar within reach. He stretched out his hand to grab it, and looking back up he was startled to see the ghostly figure of William reaching out his hand towards him.
Castiel debated just brushing it off and saying they were fine. It’d be easy to just sweep yet another thing under the rug and allow it to bottle up inside themself. They already had so many problems and Dean was already helping with so many of them it didn’t seem fair to continue to dump all of it out, knowing how Dean always felt the need to help. But Castiel felt like they were barely hanging on and the thought of just unloading all of it so that
It felt so right. Kelly had been thrilled by the news that Cas and Dean had finally gotten together and the three of them, if Castiel said so themself, were doing a phenomenal job in co-parenting. It helped that Dean had always been amazing with the kids and had always loved them like his own.
“I enjoy eating it,” Castiel replied, and suddenly, the chasm between them didn’t feel so wide; he even felt a renewed spark of hope that they would still have a friendship when the case was over. He wasn’t going to fool himself that it would ever be anything more, but if they could be comfortable with each other again, he would settle for that.
Dean had never heard Cas swear before, and it felt very much like he was having a pop at Dean. But what for, he had no idea.
Castiel looked at him and opened his mouth as if he was about to say something, but he closed it again and turned his gaze back to the table.
Castiel smiled. “Are we going to pay Mimi a visit?”
Castiel was relieved that Mimi then proceeded to reel off information about James and Heather, and how much she worried for their marriage, and that she didn’t like Mark living all on his own because he was such a sweetheart, because it stopped Castiel from daring to tell her the truth. That he was more relaxed the last time they had met, not because they hadn’t had the pressure of a social gathering, but because since then the friendship - and any hope of a deeper relationship - between Dean and him had completely fallen apart.
Castiel loved how domestic that sounded, and he glanced down at the bundle of fur in his arms. “Would you like to live here with us?”
“Yeah but they never smile like that with anyone else,” she explained, sounding far older than an average eight-year-old. “They’re always so sad all the time but they smile all the time when they talk to you.”
Yes, it was sickeningly domestic, but really… who gave a fuck?
that face, that
Castiel hung up their phone with a jab and threw it towards the couch cushions. Already Dean knew this wasn’t good news.
As they waited, Cas became more and more anxious about how Sam would react to their new relationship status, which Dean thought was adorable as fuck. He was certain Sam would be fine with it, but he enjoyed all the reassuring hugs he had to give Cas anyway.
“Good.”
A little over an hour later, with Cas off to work, Dean was deeply focused on the project he was working on when he got a phone call with the caller ID saying ‘Claire’s School.’ He turned off the wood saw and wiped his shaking hands before attempting to swipe to accept the call. He may have sounded mildly panicked as he answered, not sure why the hell the school was calling him.
Everyone fell silent and stared at Sam with varying degrees of shock, until he spoke again.
It was their second week of living together and Dean still felt like he was walking on eggshells.
“Er, yeah.” Sam sounded just as surprised by Cas swearing as Dean was. “So, you’ll keep me in the loop if you see or hear anything else? Or y’know… when the ghost finally shows.”
Castiel half-turned, to see Dean running his hand lovingly over the banister. He was right; the patterns on the banisters were just as pleasing to the eye as those in the bunker, but the stairs themselves were wooden, as opposed to the metal ones they were so used to.
As they walked through the kitchen, Dean looked like he was about to stop to pour himself a coffee, but Castiel steered him away from the machine and towards the French doors.
“Shut up.”
“I like having you three here.” Dean admitted to his plate of food, no longer meeting Castiel’s eyes. “I didn’t… I didn’t realize how lonely I was until you got here. I like that you're all living here. I like hearing the kids joke around with each other or even when they argue. And I really like having someone to hang out with at the end of the day. We haven’t gotten to hang out this much in years. It’s nice.”
Dean looked relieved, as he took something from his shoulder that Castiel hadn’t noticed. “Well, that’s great. And to celebrate your rebirth, here’s a gift. It’s a pair of socks and a blanket. I got ‘em at the same time as the mug, and I was gonna give them to you one day at a time, but then things went to shit… And I forgot all about them, and anyway, now it kinda feels like the perfect timing.”
“Er… no. We don’t need to be married to prove how much we care for each other.” If he and Dean were really a couple Castiel would want nothing more than to ‘make it official’, but he knew instinctively that taking their fake relationship to that level would be too painful for him to bear.
“You might have to though,” Castiel interrupted again.  “If we’re living here, you should have a role in handling discipline to some extent. I can’t be with them twenty four seven and I think you should at least know how me and Kelly like to approach it.”
He was beaming with happiness, and it seemed to be infectious. Dean could feel the smile that was breaking out on his own face as he got to his feet and approached Cas.
Castiel looked around at the groups of people gathered in the garden, chatting and drinking. “No, not yet.”
The peaceful morning didn’t last long as their daughter came barreling into the room, “Daddy, have you seen Cain? I can’t find him again.”
“Dean said we’re going to have cheeseburgers for dinner, does that sound good?”
“Yeah, why not? That’d be great, thanks.” Dean replied enthusiastically, and Castiel wondered if he’d forgotten that they likely wouldn’t still be around on Sunday. Or maybe he thought that he should say yes in case Mimi got suspicious.
to move, yet again, to a new place. Having only lived in this apartment for five months, Castiel felt awful for not thinking about how their kids would feel after just barely putting down some roots.
Cas did as he was told and started to pour the salt in a ring around them, as Dean placed the box on the floor and reached into his pocket for the lighter he always kept for situations like this. He had hoped William wouldn’t reappear before they got this over with, but of course they couldn’t be that lucky.
“Thank you.”
Castiel may have been a bit morose as they walked into the house, shuffling their feet as they headed in the direction of their room. The lights were off downstairs apart from the nightlights they’d plugged everywhere in case one of the kids needed something in the middle of the night. Castiel figured Dean grew tired of waiting up and had already gone to bed so they were startled when the lights on the stairs turned on right as Castiel walked passed.
“Oh yeah, Sammy told me about that. Colony collapse… most likely caused by pesticides… we’ve gotta plant more flowers.” For once Dean seemed to be completely serious, and Castiel was surprised, to say the least.
“What happened?”
Dean’s arm had stayed steadily around Cas’s shoulders and they couldn’t pretend they weren’t loving the simple comfort it brought them. Every so often Dean’s thumb would rub softly against the fabric on Cas’s shoulders and each time it happened butterflies would swirl in their stomach.
Dean made sure to call Kelly and then Cas, while Claire went to get them some napkins and check out the claw machine the ice cream shop had.
“What do you even do with yourself?” Dean asked dramatically.
Conversation was still swirling through the table but for a brief moment neither Cas or Dean were talking to anyone. Both of them seemed to realize it and turned to look at each other and share a little laugh.
The doorbell rang, pulling Castiel out of their trance. It seemed Dean also had to shake his thoughts clear before pushing off the counter and heading to answer the door.
Castiel’s fingers were running through their hair, making it more wild than usual. Dean could sense that his best friend was only moments away from tears. He could feel the waves of frustration, and sadness rolling off of Cas and wanted more than anything to be a comfort. He placed his hand on Cas’s shoulder and ran it down the length of their arm, pulling their fingers free.
Dean had been so shocked by the fact that this person hadn’t seen Jurassic Park or Schindler’s List that he’d started asking Castiel what movies they
He had foolishly allowed himself to believe that Dean’s behaviour towards him since they’d arrived at the house might mean he had more than brotherly feelings for him. But no, it was very apparent now that Castiel’s love for Dean was one sided, and he needed to accept that before it became even more painful for him.
It killed him to watch Castiel continue to struggle. To watch those bright blue eyes start to dim and their smile start to fade. Now, hearing Cas’s laugh was such a rare occurrence and it made Dean unbearably sad. He wanted to do anything in his power to be there for Cas and make sure his friend knew that he would always be there for them, including Claire and Jack. Dean loved those two kids more than words could explain. He wanted more than anything to be able to help all three of them get back on their feet. To make them all laugh and smile again.
Castiel’s head swam with worst case scenarios but they refused to allow themself to dwell on it. There were two kids who needed a roof over their heads and Castiel was not about to sit idly and hope that things would work out.
Cas had lain next to him all night, stiff as a board, and as a result Dean hadn’t gotten much sleep. Still… it wasn’t like he slept much most nights anyway, so a couple more cups of this strong coffee should see him ready to start the day. To do…
Did Dean really think offering Castiel and their children a home was so simple? How was this man real?
“I’m sorry about that. I didn’t realize I made you all think you had to stay in your rooms but I talked to your daddy and we decided it’s okay to play where you want to as long as we help clean up.”
“It’s not just the fucking desk Cas,” he growled. Shutting the microwave door a little too hard. “You guys trash the house every single morning. And every morning I clean up after you. Today I had to finish your laundry, pick up the toys that were all over the floor so I didn’t break my neck just walking through the living room, I had to clean the kitchen for the hundredth time, and when I came back in from work it was all undone.”
He couldn’t say why, but Dean found himself stuck on the passage; reading it over and over again. It was beautiful, and yeah... what ever happened to his ‘no chick flick moments’ rule?
“What does that even mean?”
“I’m not going to like this, am I?” Cas asked, looking like they were contemplating kicking Dean out to get back to their work.
“What don’t you like about it?”
“Thank you, Sam, but you don’t need to worry. We’ll retire, and Dean and I will grow old together.” Cas smiled at Dean, and Dean’s heart melted a little bit.
“I like purple a lot but green is definitely my favorite.”
Cas’s breath caught in their throat. It was intense to be under this particular gaze but it felt as if so many unasked questions were finally being answered. They’d seen that look in their own eyes over the years, in photos people captured of Cas with Dean. Always that same look like the sun, moon, and stars had shown themselves for the very first time. That look that said: I think I see forever in the way you smile.
It’s not like he could blame them, if the situations were reversed he’d probably avoid himself as well but he and Cas were best friends. This had to be something they could work out.
Castiel had been taking hit after hit recently, and Dean hoped this could be a chance for things to look up for his friend. As badly as Castiel wanted to pull themself out of this on their own, Dean was grateful for a chance to help. He’d watched as Castiel kept getting knocked down, as his best friend’s smile faded from their eyes, as the dark circles grew more pronounced, as their hair speckled with grey due to stress. Dean had been fighting with the need to help out, to step in and offer financial support when things got really tight but knowing Cas for well over a decade meant knowing that they would’ve hated Dean’s offer.
“I…,” Cas started, clearly embarrassed, but he pulled his eyebrows to a frown and stared at the frying pan as if he wanted to smite it for merely existing.
They chatted for a minute or two longer, then with a regretful tone, Dean told Brittany and Matt how great it had been talking with them, but they should try to meet other neighbours too.
“Alright, who wants breakfast? Eggs?” Dean interjected, already walking out the door without waiting for a response.
“Well, of course you can.” There was a pause on the other end and a muffled sound, before he heard Sammy’s voice again. “Dean, you sound a bit… are you drunk?”
“Yes.” Cas smiled again, a little wider, and Dean felt pleased he’d thought of it.
Bob peered at him and furrowed his brow. “That… that’s very precise.”
“Don’t touch that!”
Feeling the need to prove himself useful to Sam, at least, but fully expecting an objection from Dean, Castiel turned to Sam anyway, informing him, “Yes, I’d like to come with you.”
“Okay,
What Castiel really liked about the house, however, was how unusually structured it was. He had visited enough towns to have noticed that most houses were built in a similar shape and style, with identically sized windows and doors. But this one was irregular, with lots of quirky features, including columns either side of the front door, and even a dome on top that was reminiscent of a church.
Cas looked a little dazed, and it took him a second to continue speaking. “But then you seemed to like it, and I didn’t want the ghost to interrupt us any more, because-”
“I… I did know know, yes.”
“No,” he said. “I’m staying. If Cas says I’m not a threat I believe him, and I found the guy passed out on the floor earlier, so he should probably not be left alone,” he said to Sam, not quite sure where the words came from.
“Oh, sure, Dean and Cas.” Brian extended his hand to Castiel too. “Mimi told us to expect you.”
“You up for a movie night?” He couldn’t think of anything more couple-y than that, other than, y’know… sex. Just thinking that had Dean practically laughing out loud… what a ridiculous idea it was, for so many reasons.
Dean felt like he was in college all over again, and he thought back to the one day he had thought he could be brave. It had been a Thursday after a football game. They’d been sitting in the front seat of his car and Dean had spent all night wondering what would happen if he just said
As they set off for the barbecue, Dean resolved that by the end of the day, he and Cas would be back on an even footing. It was time for a Dean Winchester charm offensive.
The air around them suddenly became icy cold, and Dean’s breath turned frigid.
“I’m not sure?” Dean took a seat at the foot of the bed, and Castiel set aside their rickety old laptop and gave Dean their full attention. Dean took a deep breath before speaking. “So, I know you’ve been trying like hell to find a job. And I know you’re more than capable of doing it on your own so I don’t want you to think that I don’t believe you can. But I hate seeing how down you’ve gotten over not finding anything and I think I can help.”
played on a reel in Dean’s mind. It wasn’t the first time Cas had ever said it to him. Every so often Dean would wear a new outfit or cut his hair a different way and Cas would casually mention they thought Dean looked nice, but outright telling Dean they thought he was handsome was not something Dean could remember happening before. His cheeks heated instantly.
Dean and Cas talked for a little while longer before deciding to head to bed. Dean was excited for the following morning, hoping everything he and the kids had done would pan out the way they all hoped. He made sure to set his alarm clock thirty minutes earlier than he usually did to make sure he could fulfil his side of the surprise.
“Be back real quick. Oliver and I are going to grab him something to eat,” she announced, as they headed over towards Brian.
Sam had shown Dean and Castiel pictures of the house, but that had not prepared them for how beautiful the place was. Castiel had spent enough years on earth by now to recognise when something was aesthetically pleasing, and there was no doubt that this house was just that.
If that wasn’t the understatement of the damn century.
“I can do it myself!” She shouted, yanking the toy Castiel was about to pack out of their hand.
Dean didn’t have time right then to ask why the fuck he’d done that, but the irony of where Cas had put it wasn’t lost on him. If they weren’t in actual danger, he might have even laughed about it.
Castiel leaned forward and kissed him softly, before pulling back and staring into his eyes. “We’ve both been guilty of hurting one another. But none of that matters; what does matter is that we’re here, now.”
“Keep telling yourself that,” she teased.
“Okay, I’m good to go. Let’s go see Mimi.”
Dean winced.
“Yeah, buddy.”
“You could always stand at opposite ends of the garden,” Matt suggested, laughing along with Dean.
Dean went over to the fridge, presumably to look for something to eat, and Castiel felt it would be okay to leave him alone now. He opened the door, but before he could step outside, Dean asked,
“I can try and sew it back on?” Dean suggested, his wild thoughts under control.
Dean rounded the corner just as the cat ran back into the bushes, but he obviously caught a glimpse of her, despite the gathering gloom of dusk that wasn’t making it easy to see clearly. “What was that?” he asked, looking suspiciously at her retreating form.
“That’s ‘cause it’s new. It’s a gift… for you.”
Dean bought them the purple shirt too and Cas smiled all the way home.
The loud huff of air from across the room spoke volumes.
Castiel had no belongings other than his angel blade, so while Dean brought his bag up to the bedroom, he unpacked the groceries. It was only a few minutes later when Dean reappeared, exaggeratedly rubbing his belly, and Castiel couldn’t help but smile.
Also, Dean had gone and got himself a bona fide, regular job that he really enjoyed. Their neighbour Mark had been driving past one day last summer when Dean was working on Baby. He asked Dean if he was interested in the opening he had for a mechanic in his garage, and it was an offer Dean couldn’t refuse. He’d  thought about it for all of two minutes before saying yes, and the rest, as they say, was history.
“Fine.”
“I know but it’s better if we stay in our rooms.”
Castiel had no idea whether Bob was pleased that he and John had been together for so long, or whether he was actually complaining. The man was very hard to read, and in fact something about his demeanour reminded Castiel of Ketch. That realisation alone was quite disconcerting.
“You think that feels good, wait until I do it to your dick.” Dean licked over his bottom lip as Cas looked up, and he made a kind of growling sound, before sliding down the bed until his face was at eye level with Dean’s groin.
They’d been eating lunch in front of the library under the shade of some tree Dean didn’t care to learn the type of, but it was a place Castiel loved to sit and read. The two of them had only been friends for a few months at that point but Dean had already started to consider Cas to be his best friend.
Dean laughed and held his hands to the side with his palms facing outwards. “Dammit, you caught me.” He watched as the cat snuggled against Castiel, then reached his hand out and booped her lightly on the nose. “You wanna keep her?”
Dean didn’t know what to say to fix this or make it suck less, so he slid his arm around Cas’s shoulders and pulled Cas into a side hug, relishing the way Cas rested their head in the crook of Dean’s neck. They sat that way for a few minutes as Cas took control of their feelings. Dean wished he never had to let go.
To The Yard
“Eileen? Dean… I got a text from Eileen! She’s alive.” Sam’s face had been one of sheer happiness, and the moment they’d reached the bottom of the stairs, Dean had hugged him in congratulations.
Breaking off the kiss, Dean pulled back slightly to watch Cas’s reaction as he slipped his hand inside Cas’s jeans and boxers and took hold of his cock. Cas’s eyes widened, and he let out an obscene sound.
He grabbed her a Dr. Pepper from his secret stash and used it as a peace offering, hoping since she wasn’t usually allowed to have soda that it might butter her up.
“He seemed happy when he left us, and I believe it was him who brought you and Eileen back. I just wish I could talk about him with Dean too, but their relationship was complicated, and Dean isn’t exactly good at discussing stuff when it comes to emotions, is he?”
“Oh my god, has anyone ever told you two how cute you are?” Patricia asked, staring at them with an expression of delight.
With Dean, things were very different. After the utter failure of a conversation about Castiel’s sacrifice - and what he’d said moments before - he never actually asked how Castiel was, but he would often catch Dean peering at him through narrowed eyes, as if he was trying to gauge him.
They ate in silence, but it didn’t feel comfortable or companionable; it was strained, and got worse the longer it stretched on. Castiel decided to concentrate firmly on his food, and tried not to think too much about what was going on with Dean.
They backed away, stepping out into the hallway off the bathroom.
“It’s okay, I know we can’t afford it.”
Looking around, Castiel realized they were indeed already in the parking garage of Kelly’s apartment complex. Apparently their thoughts had preoccupied their mind a little too much.
(See the end of the chapter for
Just like the previous two days, he was drawn again to the empty flower beds, imagining it filled with roses. It was a captivating thought, and Castiel closed his eyes and pictured the flowers in a variety of colours.
“No, thank you. I’ll stick with coffee.” Cas had an unmistakable note of disappointment in his voice, but at that moment Dean couldn’t find it in him to care. It was past midday, after all, and he needed to rid his mind of the last couple of hours, even if it was just temporarily.
It only lifted when later, just as Castiel was about to head to bed themself, Dean said, “come here,” pulling Castiel into a hug. “Welcome home, pal.”
“Okay, so that doesn’t sound like it’s gonna be a problem.” Dean put his now empty bottle down and shrugged. “Vengeful ghost… been around for years… we go in and catch the bastard, and relieve its suffering.”
He was too fucking tired for this bullshit.
“Oh! You mean kid. Claire Novak-Kline.”
“Yeah, I noticed,” Dean replied.
Castiel fell into an awkward silence, and from Dean’s initial non-reaction, he guessed that Dean was feeling just as awkward. Except… after a short pause, Dean laughed pleasantly as he gently took hold of Castiel’s hand and said,
When he withdrew his hand he was holding what looked like a folded piece of paper, but as Cas opened it out and laid it on the table, they could see it was a photograph of two young men. They were looking at each other with soft smiles, and something about the way they were framed made Dean think that one of them was holding the camera.
As expected, there was only one bed, and Castiel wondered how awkward it was going to be later, with the two of them sleeping in it… or in Castiel’s case, pretending to sleep. Hopefully, this arrangement would only be for a couple of days at the most.
“What about Dean? Isn’t he with you?” Sam said, concern in his tone.
She sat down on the ground, her back turned to Castiel, her arms crossed in front of herself. Castiel wanted to pull her into their lap and hug her, to apologize for not being able to provide her the stability she seemed to crave, but they knew a hug would be unwelcome at this particular moment.
He noticed then that Cas’s eyes were filled with tears.
“Being extremely old has its advantages.”
“It’s… spongy,” Cas said carefully. “A weird but somehow intriguing texture.”
He sighed, as he took a sip of his coffee that was cold by now and grimaced when he pulled out a small feather that had somehow landed in it.
Dean wasn’t going to lie… that stung. But he apparently had a masochistic streak, because he couldn’t help asking, “It hasn’t been that bad, stuck here with me? Has it?”
Cas looked like he was about to object, but before they could go any further with the conversation, Cas’s phone rang. He pulled it out of his pocket and peered at the screen, then quickly answered it. “Hello, Sam.”
“Hey, Sammy, you’re on speaker. The barbecue was great, and it’s going fine,” Dean answered before Castiel could.
"That would make me happy," Cas said, stating the blindingly obvious.
He didn’t finish that sentence, as William rushed at him and Cas banished him with a swipe of the iron bar once again.
Cas stopped texting and looked up. “Sam interviewed the couple who lived here last. Their story corroborates everything Mimi told us.”
“I need help.”
“That’s what parents do. They worry,” he tried to assure, wishing she didn’t have to feel this way. This was a side to her he didn’t really know existed, this care taking, worried side that seemed completely opposite to her usual spitfire attitude. He knew she was protective of those she loved but he didn’t realize just how fiercely she cared about her family. It made tears almost come to his eyes.
“I can’t let you buy me clothes.”
Dean didn’t even allow himself to draw up a mental image of his and Cas’s junk (despite having done that very thing many times in his adult life) and by the mortified look on Cas’s face, neither did they.
A warm hand gripped his forearm.
“It’s true though.”
While he didn’t know the history of LGBT+ rights in the United States, he was pretty sure that any kind of relationship between William and Richard would have been illegal (hence Richard marrying, and begging William to leave him alone). Hell, it was hard enough even these days for too many non-heterosexual people; it must have been impossible in the fifties. No wonder Richard had used an assumed name and William had hidden the letters.
“What?”
Castiel could practically hear Dean’s unease over the line. Their best friend hated problems he couldn’t immediately solve. “Okay. I’m all ears. What do you need?” Dean asked, sounding as if he was still contemplating heading over to Castiel’s apartment.
“Yes. I think it’s time I made an honest man out of this one.” Eileen grinned mischievously at Sam, and
“That’s okay. I got it,” he said, hoping he sounded less irritated than he felt.
“And I wanted to check that the colour wasn’t sprayed on,” he added conspiratorially.
“I could repaint the windowsills while we’re here,” Dean said suddenly, pulling Castiel out of his introspection.
After day one of the new school, every morning was chaos at Dean’s house. Claire had decided she hated her new school and that she would never be friends with anyone there. Apparently the best way to prove her stance was to refuse to get ready until the very last minute.
Castiel couldn’t disagree with the sentiment, but he found Dean’s regret that they wouldn’t be staying most curious. Surely he couldn’t mean that he wanted to stay in the house permanently; no… he must have been referring to the relative peace and quiet of their situation. “Yes, I think we should do that.”
“Uh, Dean Winchester?”
“Thank you,” Cas said, staring straight ahead and looking like he had just died a little on the inside.
Dean sipped on his drink and looked around the garden, before declaring, “I’m gonna talk to some of the neighbors for a bit. It’s gonna look a bit weird if we both lurk in the shadows all afternoon. You can stay here, though, and I’ll tell you if I find out anything helpful.”
“I guess so. Speaking of… you ready for that burger?”
Cas kept sneaking into the scene.
many dead animals into the house, and she and Dean had a mutual understanding. She didn’t make Dean sneeze too much, and he would occasionally stroke her under the chin while no one was looking. It was the perfect arrangement.
Dean grimaced and turned to his friend. “I’m sorry, Cas. I totally spaced on moving it. I’ll do it today, I promise.”
Castiel walked through the hallway a few steps until they made it to the kitchen where Jack, the beam of sunshine that he was, sat merrily at the table, kicking his feet back and forth as he happily ate the scrambled eggs Dean had so kindly made them all that morning. Castiel was glad Jack woke up in a good mood. They’d been worried when their son had refused to sleep in his new bedroom the past few nights, claiming he was scared of the dark. It was going to be an adjustment for all three of them living at Dean’s.
What Dean expected was that Cas would brush him off and they’d go back to watching the movie. Dean would be satisfied with knowing Castiel thought he looked similar to one of Cas’s celebrity crushes, and that would be that. Instead, Cas looked at Dean like he was an idiot. Their head tilted to the side and their voice softened enough to make Dean’s heart stutter.
Mimi came rushing out of the house to meet them, even before they had reached the bottom step. “Dean, Cas, how lovely to see you.”
“Angels are very vulnerable when they are molting since we are rendered unable to fly until it is over.”
Well… not actually Heaven, because the way Cas was treated there sucked. Maybe heaven with a small h.
He patted his stomach for emphasis, before taking a huge bite of his burger. “Mmmm, s’good,” he managed to say, once he’d swallowed enough to speak again.
“Why not?”
He woke up to the alarm of the smoke detector only a few hours later. When he opened the door to the hallway, sleepily and bleary-eyed, he was welcomed by the smell of burnt food and Castiel letting out a series of absolutely filthy curses. He was positive Cas couldn’t have gotten them from him, he didn’t curse
It sounded like his three roommates were in Cas’s room for the moment so Dean tried to quickly heat himself a plate of food, hoping to escape upstairs before anyone spotted him, knowing he probably wasn’t in the best mood to attempt to have a conversation. It didn’t seem to be his lucky day because right as the microwave beeped, Cas came back into the kitchen.
Their friend was ridiculous but Castiel knew they weren’t about to turn down an opportunity to spend a day with their best friend. Dean could’ve asked them to go watch people wash their cars and Castiel would have agreed. Any time they got to spend with Dean was something they savored.
The conversation turned back to other friends at the table and Castiel was truly enjoying themself. Their friend Meg commandeered someone’s vacated seat and made plans to get coffee with Cas, which Charlie invited herself to. Dean invited everyone over in a couple of weeks to do a barbecue for Claire’s birthday, making sure even the friends without kids knew they could all come hang out. Castiel hadn’t talked so much in so long. It made them wish they hadn’t isolated themself for such a long time but they were proud of themself for getting back out now.
“I could always use the help with my shop you know, and I’ve been thinking about hiring someone soon anyway to do the customer service side of things or at the very least helping me with finishing each project and shipping it out. I’d love for that person to be you but I know you and I know you’d feel like you’d be freeloading if you were living with me and being paid by me so I talked to Bobby.”
“I-I c… I mean… I don’t think I could pass as gay,” Dean finally stuttered out.
Castiel had meant to be more helpful. It was always at the top of their to-do list for the day but when they’d come home and things would already be taken care of, cleaning up more was pushed lower on the list. It wasn’t fair of them. They could admit that. “Dean’s patience with us ran out on Monday so instead of talking to him, I made the kids and I hide out in our rooms and avoid making any semblance of a mess.”
Dean realised.
“No I apologize, that isn’t necessary, I was just preoccupied in thoughts,” Castiel rushed to explain, “How may I assist you?”
“Never been better, but I wanna keep it that way. Maybe I’ll even get a regular job.” Dean wasn’t sure what he could do, but there had to be something, right?”
“Heya, Sleeping Beauty. You must’ve been really wiped, huh?”
“Do you think you’ll be ready to leave soon?” It took longer for Jack to respond than Castiel had anticipated. They watched their son pause the show and look up towards Castiel, his bright green eyes curious and open.
“Claire, honey, let me at least get the tangles out of your hair,” Castiel pleaded. They’d been trying to help Claire get ready for her first day at her new school but she was not amused.
As the silence stretched on, Dean swore he could feel something changing in the air between them. Kind of like the opposite of how the room felt when William had been there; instead of turning colder it seemed to be heating up.
“Whoa! You’re pretty, daddy!” Jack announced from where the kids were playing in the living room. The compliment brought a smile to Cas’s face.
“Okay, then,” he said, trying not to glare too much at Cas. “Upstairs, now. Hurry.”
“I have to go in a little earlier today so I am going to finish the application I’m working on then head out, I’ll say bye before I go.”
A few seconds later a furry little face appeared, followed by a body, four legs and a tail. It was a cat, and it looked very young and lost. Castiel crouched down and held out his hand to it, and it approached him tentatively. As he gently stroked the top of its head, it slowly inched closer until it could rub itself against Castiel’s leg.
