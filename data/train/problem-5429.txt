"I'm really not in the mood"
"You didn't know, and I mean, yeah you could have said, and the whole situation... but, Cas I can't be all that mad"
Castiel managed a nod that was more solid than he felt.
The Novak family has power; the Winchester family has even more.
Dean apparently sees this as an opportunity
"Is... is this supposed to be helping?" Castiel groans incredulously from behind his desk, his head in his hands.
"No. They don't" he kissed over Dean's chest running his hands firmly along his stomach
"I will tell you" Dean looked at his lap as he fiddled with their hands casually "I don't generally hold hands like this. In my daily life or with clients"
This occurs the day after Castiel spends an evening with Dean. Cas looking back on the evening will fill in a few blanks.
"Let me" Dean softly touched his arms, Cas looking at him with lavender eyes on the verge of tears.
"Dean" he whined
had he agreed to meet Balthazar for lunch? In fairness this was what he usually did on Saturday afternoons.
None of this is Beta'd btw.
Why would he? He'd never taken a knot before, and on top of it all, he was a thousand miles away from any rational thought thanks to Dean's intoxicating scent.
"Yes, sorry I.. hang on"
Dean bit his lip, moaning before the other man's tongue even touched him. He was
he let his need take him over like that? He never did that. He didn't bring up that Cas was wearing a scent blocker, too but that wasn't abnormal for an Alpha.
"No, Cas I can't say that I have" Dean leaned for the end table and Cas grabbed his arm. He quirked an eyebrow at the man.
Peeking out from behind the Better Homes and Gardens was a face he knew. Castiel Novak- Most Eligible Alpha
"He has a few loyal clients, one guy saves up all year for one night with Dean. He doesn't work as much as he'd like, but his price is firm"
"Cas. That's so fucking hot" he rolled to straddle Cas while pressing their mouths together. He could taste himself on the other man's tongue and groaned as he recalled the feeling of Castiel swallowing everything he gave him, which was probably a great deal (even he rarely swallowed it all, letting some just leak out around the cock in his throat). The idea that his knot filling Castiel's throat with cum was something that man got off on drove. Him. Wild.
"Dean....fuck....Dean I'm....Dean..I" there was no drawing it out, Castiel's knot was swelling in record time.
He wanted to see Cas again. He kept telling himself that it had been a good time, the guy tipped well and that he was gorgeous and that was all there was to it... Why wouldn't he be up for more great sex with a beautiful Alpha who tips well and eats ass like he's walked across the desert?
"Yes" he whispered.
"I know that. Do you not want me to?"
"What is it?"
"Cas-" he paused... with a name like his he couldn't risk it... if Dean knew anything about the business world he'd immediately know him as the CFO of Pear, a company unparalleled in its technological innovation. He'd given many widely televised presentations over the years. He cleared his throat.
Dean, so beautiful, so playful and full of life and confidence.... so kind with the right amount of compassion and teasing. Castiel made the decision to let go. Here he was with Dean, who knew if he'd ever do this again with him let alone anyone else, and Dean is so perfect. He called Castiel perfect and his eyes and voice were so genuine. Castiel couldn't recall anything that had ever felt so real. He pushed aside the fact that he was paying for this.
"Look, this is my job and I knew what I was doing... if you're upset about it- "
Dean chuckled "I've never had anyone do that. I've done it to other people but... I've never had it done to me before"
"Thanksgiving, right" he'd completely forgotten.
And now he was.
"That is a very satisfying phrase to hear"
The man in the suit swallowed hard
Dean knew exactly what his scent was doing, he planned on it... but why? He kept searching Dean's face as the man undressed him.
"You ready to head up?" His green eyes still smiling with the rest of his face, deepening well-earned laugh lines.
Dean is still reeling from knotting the other man's mouth when he realizes that Cas is cuddled close to him, kissing his neck.
"I didn't know what it was the first time I saw that sheet, either. Do you want me to tell you what it means?"
Dean bared his neck for the man below him. Dean had never bared his neck for anyone, not even Benny. He felt Cas groan against his neck as he kissed him. He knew it was coming, he thought he would die of anticipation. He slipped against the other man's lap which was soaked with his own slick.
What if... fuck what if
"Are you sure?"
Castiel didn't respond.
"Scoot up" He pushed backwards up the bed until he was against the headboard. Dean crawled up the bed... was he still blushing? He found his way into Castiel's lap and kissed him softly before settling down and pressing their hips together. Castiel thought he was going to black out from pleasure.... just from that?
Green eyes,
Locking to door behind him he pressed his back against it. What was he doing? He has a beautiful male Omega prostitute on the way right now and no idea if this was the best or worst idea ever. He ran the faucet and splashed his face with cool water. The last time he could remember having sex was at least a year ago.. a female Beta he'd casually dated for several months. Sex with an Omega, a man at that had been.... 10 years? Had it really been that long? He was wholly unprepared. Dean was going to laugh at him, pity him... fuck.
He had nothing left. He relaxed his legs and rolled to the side. Dean may have already passed out, he passed out so quickly he didn't have the chance to check.
"I guess that could work, although" he ground his hips and bit softly at the man's neck. Castiel let out a gasp and a deep moan "I don't really need words for that"
"Sounds great" Castiel calls back, sitting on the sofa that smells of lavender and honey. He hadn't really thought about going to Dean's home, let alone how it would smell. He'll take the coffee, but the scent of Dean is enough to take the November chill from where it's settled in his bones.
"Mmmm, how'd I do?" His speech returning to normal
"You look like last night was everything I said it would be" Balthazar quipped
"What?"
"God, Dean! Yes!"
There was an attached bathroom with two sinks and a jacuzzi size tub. There was a dresser with a flat screen on it, the bed had beautiful burgundy bedding with decorative pillows and a heavy comforter.
he picked up the phone
Castiel complied. He mimicked the way Dean sat. The man across from him linked their fingers again.
Castiel beamed. Dean smiled, his cheeks flushing.
The other part of Dean was irrationally mad he didn't. Yes, mad.
Anyway, here's wonderwall.
The room felt still and quiet
"He wasn't wearing scent blockers"
Would his parents have told him, risking what would happen?
too close to society for comfort, namely too close to the Novak family.
"Please" Dean didn't even know what the fuck he was asking for
He sucked and licked Dean's ass in a way that made loud wet sounds. Dean was practically crying with pleasure. Slick ran down Castiel's neck and chest as Dean continued to gush. The continuing 'growl' giving a vibrating effect that was driving Dean crazy. Castiel began to lap at Dean's sac as he pressed two fingers into the man's slick hole.
"Noh really" Castiel said stretching his jaw. "It'll be good inna minute" he speech only slightly impaired
Thanks for sticking around
He stood in front of the door. He took a deep breath and opened the door. The scent of honey and lavender hit him like a wall the moment he stepped through the door. Dean was laying on the large bed, completely naked facing away from the door playing on his phone. Castiel felt drunk. Everything seemed like a dream, he was rock hard in his pants and his hands were shaking. He slid down the wall, crouching on the floor.
Running does nothing to clear his head. No matter what song is playing through his headphones, he's thinking of Cas.
"If I had just said I knew and told you that I called my mother and asked and that I knew it all, it wouldn't be like it is right now. I know though that I can't take it back and I- well, I fucked up.
The book contained 6 photos of the man. The first was a full body shot, fully clothed in a henley and well worn jeans. The next he sat along an I-beam positioned with the leg closest to the camera bent up on the beam and the other leg hanging from the other side, completely nude with his manhood concealed by his position. The rest of the photos were much the same but the least. The last photo was a close up of his face, Â looking down, humor on his face with a crooked smile as if someone near him cracked a joke.
"Present" he said, almost a whisper
embarrassed at how much slick poured out onto Cas when he said
of forgoing his scent blockers"
Castiel let out a chuckle
"Yeah Ruby happened." Sam was visibly irritated. Dean softened his tone "First the Benny shit happened, I dealt with that, but after Lisa left for her (Dean made air quotes) 'scent mate' despite my fucking rating and them all acting like I shouldn't be bothered... like... because what they had was biological or whatever that what we had wasn't real and- ugh- then Dad trying to set me up with a Novak like we're eighteenth fucking century royalty the very next week"
With a deep breath he left the safety of the brothel office bathroom.
Room 7, the door read in simple letters on a plaque. Dean waved the card and the door clicked. He motioned for Castiel's to enter.
"Ew, Dude I got it" Sam put his hands up and grimaced. He shook off Dean's response and grabbed a beer for himself "Do you want to talk about why you did that..."
Dean laughed.
"Come now" the other man teased "Society types can very often be far from perfect, plagued with assholes"
He dropped his head against the headrest as Balthazar drove
Castiel willed his legs forward and took the clipboard. The sheet was exactly as Dean said.
Castiel stopped abruptly, releasing his hands.
"Yes, yours" "That was filthy as fuck and I'm so fucking into it" Cas laughed nervously. Dean kissed him softly again.
"Okay"
being a fucking whore.
It's a gorgeous day, he's anxious, and it's only 2 so he throws on his running gearÂ  (one thing he does splurge on) and heads off down the street.
Dean has always loved the fall. Especially days like today; the sun is warm, it's about 60Â°F, there's a breeze blowing the colorful leaves around, and other than the chirping of the birds, the field behind the salvage yard is quiet.
"I don't know what you mean?"
A full page spread.
Cas sat up on his elbows "look, I know I... I know I'm paying for this, but I don't want it to feel fake and forced....I know that it...that you...uggggh"
He made a beeline for the front door, dropping his keys on the small table there, shedding his leather coat and leaving it on the back of the sofa. He pulled his clothes off leaving them in a pile on his bedroom floor. He grabbed the silicone dick with the fat knot at the base and walked to the dining room.
"I know I won't get away with telling you to mind your own business- "
Dean slapped the binder shut and snapped his head to the left and met eyes with Castiel. His whole face lit up as he smiled.
"Fine" he leaned back in his chair to face the ceiling, as if the answer to his problem was written in the shitty drop ceiling "any advice"
â¡â¡â¡â¡â¡â¡â¡
"Does he know I'm out here?" Dean demanded
Castiel just noticed that Garth wasn't on the phone
Castiel has been given the opportunity to say what he's got to say, and despite Dean seeing the magazine, he's still here, he's hoping to hear Castiel out and this gives him the nerve he needs to say it right.
Garth took the paperwork to the back and Castiel made a beeline for the restroom.
"Thank you, Dean"
You'd think Dean would have seen it all, sex wise, as a prostitute.... but here's a new experience for him.
"Like, fuck you fuck you?"
"Cas I- I don't know if I put any weight into the Winchester selection process or anything, but... I'm not- it's not just me, right? There's something here, right?"
"Are you purposefully playing with fire, Â Cassie?"
The way he gripped the man's hips was going to leave briuses as was the way he pounded into his ass. Cas' face was dripping as his cock, so stiff it's purple, kept coating his face. Dean's knot caught and began to swell rapidly. He couldn't tell if Cas was moaning with pleasure or pain. He could feel the man's protesting muscles against his knit for which they were no match.
What does Naomi know?
, Balthazar, it't not like-"
Cas pushed his lips to the soft curls of Dean's pelvis and let the knot fill his mouth.
"He's flexible" a pause "yeah.... an 11 for sure. Â He looks like he might change his mind after leaving the building..... no, I don't get a creepy vibe at all.... yeah, hang on"
Damnit, he's still thinking about him. Fuck.
"OK, I think that's good. I said hard limit to anything I didn't understand" His palms were embarrassingly sweaty.
"Alright, so explain it to me"
Friday, 10am at The Ugly Mug?
We find out a little bit more about Dean.
Dean leaned forward and cupped his face.
"You taste so good" he licked cum from Castiel's face "how do you taste like.... like warm apple pie..." He purred into the man's ear. "Cas, you have such a beautiful cock, such a tight ass... not even an Omega and you let me knot you and fill you up.. So good to me..."
With that, Castiel was shoved out of the elevator leaving his perturbed cousin behind.
"Are you ready, baby?" The head of his cock pressing against the other man's hole
"When's the last time you read it, Dean?"
, he would have rescheduled, and blockers only take 20 minutes to kick in, so he had plenty of time to take them had he really just forgotten"
John laughed "My oldest boys would agree with you, Sam spends much of his time in California for school, but Dean seems very fond of the quiet life" a well concealed disdain seeped through at his mention of Dean... though straight to the point, this man.
"He certainly is, sir"
What was worse, freaking out about last night or being a compete ass on the phone?
There was something about Cas that lit his body on fire, he was never this far gone. He was always chill and seductive with clients, focused on giving them an experience that would earn him a hefty tip and a return client. He wasn't even thinking about any of that, his mind wasn't worried that his selfishness would mean that this man never came back,
Dean gave him a look that he hoped conveyed mild annoyance. "Are they usually wrong?"
Castiel's eyes briefly moved to the bag clutched tightly in Dean's hand and then back up to Dean's shocked eyes. "Are you going somewhere?"
Castiel looked at him, nodding solemnly. "Scared?" He asked. Dean shook his head
âYou okay today?â Dean asked. Castiel looked up at him and furrowed his eyebrows. âYou seem, I donât know, off.â
is my dad. Christ, Dean, Bobby's
It was annoying.
Castiel nodded, "Yeah. It's okay though. That you asked, I mean."
"Come here a minute," Dean said, keeping his eyes trained on the man outside. He was just standing perfectly still. The same way he had been before.
"Pretty good," Dean said, "how're you?"
Castiel answered on the second ring, "You're the
Before Castiel could consider what he would even say to John to learn more about Dean without giving anything away, John made eye contact with him, excused himself from his adoring circle, and made a bee-line for Castiel.
Dean took him by the hand and lead him to a hallway on the other side of the office. They went up a narrow flight of stairs with amethyst colored walls that were in need of new paint. Dean peered back, still leading him up the stairs. Castiel stared back like an idiot. Dean smiled the same smile from his picture.
"Will you frequent heaven often?" He asked casually
"Is that... something I have to disclose?"
He heard Garth chuckle "Dean always gets that reaction"
"Yup" Dean popped the 'P' digging through Sam's fridge for a beer
"...... you consented to that....right?"
"Dean I- I should have set up coffee or-or something when I knew. I didn't know you would- I walked into that room and you... if I had just told you through text or set up coffee then- then. It's no excuse Dean, I- my mind went so blank when I- you just- you smelled so... I-"
As soon as deans middle finger breached Castiel, the Alpha's growl changed, like an echo almost. Dean fought his canines, willing them to stay back as Cas' body called out to him. His chest ached. He pressed a second finger in and the man's moans next to his deep vibrations were more than Dean could take. He kept his head turned so Cas couldn't see his canines.
"Hello?"
Castiel's eyes went wide.
"Cas... I can't.... I'm already so close" He hadn't even moved yet and he couldn't get a grip on himself.
"Yeah"
and wants you to fall head over heels for him, and I'm positive he knows the
"Right! He said he'll be here in 10"
Castiel bit Dean's thigh, not hard enough to break skin, but there was going to be a mark
He read the contract over. Highlighted were key words like: informed, enthusiastic, continuous consent by both parties. Assault, breach of confidentiality, or other illegal activities by either party will lead to certain prosecution.
Dean gave him the address, Balthazar commented that he is fairly familiar with the area and found his way easily.
"Dean...I" he needed to tell Dean something. Fuck, it was something important... he couldn't think with Dean helping him stand, looking at his gorgeous naked body and that scent... it was so much stronger than his slick tasted. Dean was leading him over to the bed, lifting the cable knit sweater Cas wore over his head, undershirt and all. Dean was all smiles, slow soft hands. God, he couldn't tear his eyes from Dean's face.
"You haven't smelled like anyone else in what...." Sam thought for a moment "ten years?"
if he had just
"So you're not into cuddling I take it?"
Starting at $4,000/night
Castiel sucked in a sharp breath, the man above him- Dean- looked wrecked. Maybe he was just
"Castiel, you need to leave
"Ah yes, I believe I do"
How was Dean not looking at him like the lunatic he was?
"Can we, can we talk somewhere more private" he indicates where several people have noticed him since they stopped walking
He felt naked without Dean to lead him upstairs. The stairwell with the amethyst walls seemed to go on forever. *You're just going to talk to him, you're going to tell him what you know. That's all.* He didn't dare think that Dean would still want to have him as a client. God he wished that would be the case.
"Not that I can recall, come to think of it, but we have a mutual.... acquaintance"
"Dean" he chided, making it clear that he was only going to accept a verbal answer
Dean furrowed his brows "What do you mean?"
Cas attempted to check his email, his thoughts wandering back to last night and the events of this morning.
Castiel:
God he was hardly aware of where he was as Dean slipped his tongue into his mouth. His tongue was cool like a fresh drink of water. He kissed Him deep, soft and slow. Castiel sank into the feeling, the tenderness of it. His chest ached inside, he wanted to keep Dean forever, he wanted Dean to kiss him just like this, like it was real, all the time.
Before Cas can say anything else, he realizes he's been recognized.
It was going to be hell waiting for Friday, Monday's were already bad enough in Castiel's opinion. Well, honestly he didn't typically hate Monday's, he liked his job well enough, but his mind was thousands of miles away. He needed to focus on what he was going to say to Dean, he desperately wanted to find the perfectly right thing to say where he wouldn't lose Dean, but in everything he can think to say, he wouldn't stick around either.
Bitchface ensued
Dean swallowed hard and nodded.
"Sam, why would I want to? I get a few people who recognise me from that picture here and there, most people I associate don't read that shit, the ratings are for the fucking wealthy"
One moment Dean grinds against his lap, the next he's running full speed to the stairs, stopping only to say
Dean smiles, and while it's not the smile that Castiel is used to, the one that lights his entire face, it's turning out to be a much better outcome than he could have hoped for. Dean doesn't hate him, Dean isn't cursing his name, he's actually going to Dean's place.
There's not much to do at the shop so he heads home around 2pm.
"Not at all!" Garth assured "Contract says that all information and photos are confidential, but Dean reserves the right to decline any client"
The man scoffs his reply
"When-" Castiel cleared his throat "When is Dean available?"
It's simultaneously perfect and overwhelming all at once. Castiel considers making sense of it, but he's surrounded by a home that smells like Dean, and the man is nearly in his lap, kissing him desperately... Dean knows the truth, and with no guilt or fear holding him back, he wraps his arms around the man and holds him tighter against himself.
Castiel stops, and Dean with him
"And uh, good to meet you, too Mr. Winchester"
He stroked himself, using his own slick as lube.
"Alright well, I'll let you get back to your Saturday... take care"
Dean finds himself overly stressed about this Cas situation.
"I still don't understand"
"I'd love to, but only if you want to"
"Yes." Castiel smiled in agreement
Castiel moaned at the word. Nobody ever told him to present his slicked up ass for them, why would they? He turned and put his ass in the air, holding the base of his own cock to keep from cumming.
"Like it is right now?"
"I am"
"Please, enjoy your day"
You know, I thought about having Dean knocked up and running off to Colorado to raise their child alone for a few years until returning and accidentally bumping into Cas while he realizes that's his Baby,  but I can't put myself through this angst on this one, I dunno.
"Cas" Dean broke the kiss, and the other man looked up at him, striking blue eyes even with pupils the size of the moon- blown wide with lust "I want you to fuck me"
"Here you are!" Garth loudly plopped the large binder onto the desk, patting it proudly "These are the best that Heaven has to offer!"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The walk is not long at all, as Dean said.
Dean said cross-legged at the end of the bed and patted in front of him for Cas to sit.
know why you smell like an Omega, but you need to leave the office and
"Probably not"
"Water sports?" He said "I guess it doesn't matter since it's a hard limit for you"
"I'm gonna make you feel so good" he kissed down his chest "I'm gonna fill you up with my knot"
Everything is still in Castiel's mind. The world around him seems muffled suddenly. Dean, the man with charisma and confidence and charm sits before him, toying with a coffee cup, and avoiding his gaze until the very end,Â  looks nervous.
Garth(8:00pm): Great! I'll let him know.
The 'ti' at the end of 'Cas' was heavily scribbled out. The beautiful script looked out of place on the small notepad paper with the Heaven logo on the top and was a clear sign of a Society private school.
"YES!" The Omega cried out
"Not if you don't want to" Cas shrugged
"Well, no but." Balthazar ran his free hand over his face before setting his coffee down "I'm not here to tease you, cousin"
"Yeah, Dean, was it an engine issue or a tire estimate?" Sam asked, pointing a soapy finger to his chin, feigning innocence, "I forget." Bobby chuckled, watching Dean's face color and putting together the pieces of Sam's joke.
Lisa laughed.
Castiel's cheeks pinked and he sucked on his bottom lip. It was an enticing display and Dean had to glance away, looking just in time for the light to hit green. He kept on, looping the block and heading for a clearing with enough of a view of Falls Park to be nice without having to pay or wait until morning. Dean stopped the car and leaned over Castiel to push his door open for him. He looked up at Castiel and hesitated to move out of his space. Castiel was watching him, stars in his eyes. Dean cleared his throat and moved to get out of the car, Castiel doing the same.
Dr. Novak said that he'd been in a car accident on a backroad. He said it was likely caused by the freezing rain, because his toxicology report came back clean and there was no sign of another driver anywhere near the scene of the accident. This was all well and good, but he couldn't remember where he was going to or coming from, and the only thing he remembered with finality was that he was driving his car, which was, potentially, his only noteworthy possession.
"Hey, Cas, do you maybe wanna get dinner sometime?" Dean asked, corner of his mouth picking up in his trademark smirk. Castiel blinked at him. "I mean, I'd like to get to know you better. Feel like we'd have a lot in common." Castiel was watching him shyly, face tinting pink. "Plus, you're easy on the eyes."
"You're trying," Dean scoffed.
"There's a second vic," Meg said, "Single GW to the thigh."
Castiel's face splotched pink and he ran a finger under the collar of his sweater. "Nothing to worry about," Castiel said, "it was probably wrong."
"Yeah, but all he's gotta do is pay for room and board. It covers all the classes."
Dean had been staring at his phone for fifteen minutes. He had Castiel's number punched in, and he wanted to talk to him. But it was late and he didn't want to bother him. He bounced his leg over and over, and tried to convince himself not to call.
Dean laughed a little and nodded. "Yeah," he said, "sure, man." He led Castiel over the the workbench, pulling up a second stool. "Here you go. Be careful, its a little wobbly. They both are."
Dean smiled, nipping at Castiel's stomach and chest. He licked along Castiel's nipple, and Cas groaned.
"...Are you alright, Dean?"
"Like I got hit by a car," Dean joked.
Castiel nodded, "Would it be alright if I checked your blood pressure?"
"Sorry I can't do lunch," Dean said.
"You know," Lisa said as she walked him out to the Impala, "you could stay over if you wanted." Dean did want to, almost desperately, and he told her as much, but he had to go into work early in the morning to finish up a project that Bobby had asked him to do, and it was already almost midnight. He made a bitter noise low in his throat, which drew a beautiful laugh out of Lisa. "Next time," She said and Dean nodded eagerly.
Through his fingers came softer, âno, no Cas, Iâm sorry, I-â something soft landed on the covers next to Cas. He turned his head slightly to see flannel pajama pants.
âIt was- it was nothing, Iâm sorry-â Dean leaned forward and something touched Casâs wrist.  Maybe it was Deanâs hand again, Cas couldnât tell. He shook it away.
Dean tightened his hold on Casâs wrists and drew him in closer, further into the secure pocket of warmth.  âI do?â He sounded-
âOkay,â Dean nodded stiffly, âokay, but- no Cas itâs not okay, youâre upset-â
Cas woke up tucked into the bed by the window. Dean was gone.
This time, there was no crash of sensation from the outside.  Casâs heart beat like a wave breaking over his ears and blocked out everything else.  All he could see was the face pressing into his hand as a little chant of
Every sensation came crashing down againâthe scratch of jeans on his legs, the shirt-tag at the back of his neck, the puff of cold air on the back of his hands where Dean moved his palms away, and above them all a buzzing in his ears that screamed through his headache and had everything to do with what Dean had just done.  Cas jerked away, twisting his upper body aroundâthe room swam in his vision but he saw Dean clear as crystal, mouth open slightly with shock.
Cas nodded.
If Cas had still been an angel, maybe heâd have reacted differently.  When he was an angel he didnât need to sort through every noise to focus on one personâs voice, he understood it all at once.  He could feel his feet in his shoes or the air under his wings without sacrificing his attention to the sensation.  He simply knew what was where.  That was the real trouble with being human; the stimuli themselves were the same, but the body was too small to feel them all.
âYouâre ok,â Dean whispered, running his palms up and down Casâs arms again. His chest pressed between Casâs shoulder blades.  Cas leaned back to rest his head in Deanâs neck and stifled a spasm in his throat- a laugh or a sob, he couldnât tell.
The corner of Deanâs mouth lifted in a smile. âLike your wings?â
The shower stopped and his heart skipped a beat.  The top of his head still felt warm from Deanâs kiss.
âDude, hold on.â  Cas heard Dean righting the chair.  He kept on till heâd dropped himself on the bed beside his bag, arm still over his eyes.
, and-
Sunsetâs first orange dusted the sky when theyâd left the bunker, after Dean had told Cas he couldnât stay.  Theyâd driven several hours away from the bunker as the sky darkened, Cas gripping the seat most of the wayâhe knew the car couldnât be going much faster than the busses, but it felt like it was.  Although Dean hadnât spoken much on the way, he kept sneaking guilty glances at Cas.  The music and the tension and the rumbling car felt like they were slowly building up inside Cas, and the degree of relief heâd let himself feel in the bunker from the last few days of sleeplessness and uncertainty twisted like a knife through it all as he sat on the motel bed miles away.
"Far as we can tell," Zachariah said, "he doesn't have one."
Castiel smiled at them and excused himself from the room, depositing her chart. He made his rounds, and, before he took off for the night, pulled Mrs. Hutchinson's chart again. He took it over to Tessa at the counter and said, "Would you mind ordering a blood test and CT Scan for Mrs. Hutchinson, please?"
Dean climbed off of his bed, and crossed the floor to lean on Castielâs bed instead. Cas leaned away from him instinctively, just like he usually did. âWe need to talk about it,â Dean stressed. He pushed his palms down on his knees, and swayed into Castielâs space.
Deanâs hands started sweating and he had to swallow air to keep from saying something he wasnât ready for. âTell me about your day.â Dean said.
he said, "the thought of you driving my car made me nauseous."
"Great, do you want me to come get you?" Castiel offered.
Sam stared at him for a solid ten seconds before he said anything.
"What was your dream about?" Dean asked.
Dean hung up, pushing the phone snugly back into his pocket. He opened the door and gave Sam a look.
Castiel took a drink of his coffee, "It's not always fun, but it's not too bad." He lifted his shoulder, "I just, um, wondered how your day was."
"Yeah," Dean said, stomach churning, "fine, just didn't get much sleep."
"I would imagine," the doctor replied with a laugh that died somewhere before it made it to his mouth. "Any luck with remembering anything?" He asked.
He took a step forward, leaving the respite the shop offered from the heat, and cupped his hands on either side of his mouth. "Do you need help?" He called, willing his voice to carry far enough that the man could hear him. He watched the man for a moment, raising his eyebrows and shouting again, "Are you alright?"
Dean gave Castiel a quick look up and down and then said, "How did you find me?"
Bobby was the one who'd patched him up after fights, given him hugs when he cried, given him a job and a home and a life. He'd never lie to Dean.
Despite Bobby not wanting the boys in his office, he didn't keep the door locked. Their whole system operated on mutual respect, and Dean Winchester, standing in front of Bobby's office with his hand on the doorknob, knew that. He stood there, fingers gripping the brass knob, sweating. If he went inside he'd have betrayed Bobby's trust, this time after years of building it. He wasn't thirteen anymore. He wasn't a kid trying to get kicked out of this home because he was angry at the world. He was a twenty-two year old, grown ass man who was about to spit in the face of the one person who'd showed him genuine kindness when he needed it most.
Castiel eyed his face and then bumped Deanâs chin with his thumb. âYouâre not exactly quiet about it.â
Sam shook his head, "Dean, I'm telling you, just leave it alone." Dean turned away from him, so Sam just sighed again and left the room.
"So this is contraband?" Castiel said, indicating the books. Dean nodded the affirmative and Castiel winced, "Why were you in his office then?"
"Poker," Sam said, "I'm kicking Dean's ass."
Cas paused and looked up at Dean. "Is this okay?" He asked.
Bobby made a face as Dean spoke with his mouth full of the last few bites of his pie. "He said he was going for a run," Bobby said.
Dean held his breath for a second and then motioned into his bedroom. Bobby gave him a wary look but sighed and lumbered into the room, sitting on Dean's bed, and looking up at him, somehow already disappointed. "I don't think I should go to them."
Castiel never really paid attention to what other people thought. He had grown up the middle child of five, so no one really paid much attention to him anyway, so when they did, he didn't have any qualms about it. As far as he was concerned, as long as he thought he was a good guy and all four of his friends thought the same, he could let everyone else go on thinking whatever they thought about him. Besides, it's not like he could make anyone think something different than what they already thought.
Dean awkwardly rubbed the back of his neck and stood. He downed the rest of his beer and then got another one. Instead of sitting back down, he leaned against the counter in front of the sink. He stared at the empty space in front of him. "This is where I was the first time," he said, "right here."
Dean rubbed his eyes and yawned. It hadn't been one of his better ideas to go on an early morning escapade with Castiel the night before one of the busier days the shop had. For some reason, the last Thursday of every month always saw an influx of customers. It was a big enough day that Bobby worked in the shop with Dean exclusively and Sam helped out after his shift at the library ended.
Eventually, Dean groaned and said, "I
Dean watched him go, and then closed the door, turning to see Sam leaning against the partition separating the kitchen from the entryway. He was watching him with an amused smile. "I thought you'd given up men?" Sam teased.
." Bobby laughed outright at that, and Dean narrowed his eyes. "Screw you, Singer," he said, barely masking a smile, as he brought his plate to the sink. He'd clean up when he came back over for lunch.
The shop was always pretty slow on Wednesdays, but it gave Dean time to finish his minivan project from the day before. From eight in the morning to one in the afternoon Dean's only customers were a middle aged woman with a bad dye job getting a full set of new tires, and an acne-ridden kid about sixteen needing an oil change. It was all very boring. He had finished his days-out projects and day-of projects, and called people to come pick up their cars, but by three o'clock he was bored out of his fucking mind. He sat at Bobby's workbench, keeping an eye on the door, and retrieved his cellphone.
"Not until you talk to me," Castiel said emphatically. Dean tried not to look at him.
Dean laughed a little. He opened the front door of Bobby's house, and stepped in, waving Castiel in too. Dean made his way to the kitchen, aware that Castiel was following, and grabbed a beer out of the fridge. He offered one to Castiel, but he declined. Dean pulled the cap off the beer and sat down at the kitchen table. Castiel sat across from him, folding his hands over top of each other on the table. Dean studied him for a second before he spoke again. Castiel's eyes were bright blue, stunning, they seemed to look through him.
Castiel looked back down at his work and made a mark. Dean let the silence between them resume for a moment and then he spoke again. âItâs just that usually we all go see a movie together, you know? Me, you, and Lis.â Castiel looked up, rolling his eyes. âI just think itâs weird that you donât want to go with us this time. Do you have something else going on? A date or something?â
Dean rolled his eyes, Sam had been in track and field his last tree years of high school, and Dean had thought he'd give it up after graduation because he'd managed to get into Stanford on an academic scholarship instead of an athletic one, but most days, Sam still went running. "That fucking kid," Dean said into his coffee.
Dean had one hand stretched behind Lisa's seat, Ben asleep beside them on the couch in Lisa's apartment. They'd been together for close to a year, and date nights had gone from being the most impressive thing Dean could come up with to dinner and a movie back at Lisa's. He was truly happy. Happier than he'd every given himself the ability to be. Lisa leaned her head on Dean's shoulder and looked up at him through dark eyelashes. "What are thinking about?" She asked him softly.
Dean snorted and thumbed back a reply,
In the moment, he wanted Cas. Dean grabbed the back of Castielâs neck and forced his head forward, knocking their mouths together almost violently. He was acting fast, before he lost his nerve. Kissing Castiel was like something out of an action movie. Where the hero gets the babe and they ride off into the sunset, except it was more than that because this was years in the making, and because it was Cas. It was better than Dean thought it would be, and a lot less awkward because Castiel wasnât stiff. His lips were chapped but felt nice against Deanâs. His shoulders were more broad than Lisaâs and his hands were rougher, but he made Dean feel shrouded and warm. When they pulled back, Cas wasnât smiling but he looked pleased.
"Uh," Dean so eloquently replied.
"No. I fucked the boss. Past tense. He just can't get me out of his head. Lunch?"
Castiel shrugged a little, rubbing his palms together. "I don't know. I've just always been able to. I can see them, hear them. It's always been something I can do, not that I ever asked to." Dean was watching him, trying to be impartial. "It scared the hell out of me when I was a kid. I just didn't understand what was happening. I thought I was crazy, well, everyone did."
âI told him!â Dean said snapping his fingers and meeting Lisaâs surprised eyes.
Dean narrowed his eyes slightly and said, âWhat do you mean?â
Sam nodded and typed the number of the restaurant into his phone. "Dean," he said, "I need to borrow the Impala to go pick it up." He looked up at Dean, eyes set and mouth pinched. Trying to prove he wasn't going to take no for an answer.
Dean shook his head a little and said, "Hey what was the face about a minute ago?"
"It's no problem, I was just doing some reading. How's it going?" Castiel asked. Dean could picture his smile.
it sound?" Castiel teased.
Bobby didn't speak for a while, just stared Dean down, frowning. "I know what you're saying, Dean," he said, defeated.
"He ran into a friend of his, they went to catch up. I was bringing in the bags." Cas said lifting his left hand to show three or four plastic sacks in his fist. "He'll be home later. Where were you going?"
"I'm okay," Dean said, "why'd you meet me outside? I would've gone up."
Bobby nodded at him and stepped outside the room, pulling the door shut behind him.
"I just saw my mom," Dean whispered, breathing heavily as though he might pass out.
With his free hand, Castiel reached for him, but Dean moved back a half-step and said, "Cas, stop." Castiel blinked. "I'm leaving."
Dean made it to the dorms in relatively quick time, going into the building and passing through the common room to the stairs. When he got to the door of his room, he expected to open it and see Cas sitting on his bed, reading a book or watching Netflix or something, but he wasnât there. Dean let the door close behind him and tried to ignore the sinking, guilty feeling in his chest. Castielâs things were on his desk, backpack included, so he had to have just missed him, and somehow, that made it worse. Dean put his stuff on his desk and then laid down, face first, on his bed. He heard the door squeak open, but didnât lift his head.
He made it to work in record time.
"What are you doing today?" Castiel asked.
A doctor had rushed in before he had the chance to get any of the needles out of his fucking arm. Dr. C. Novak, a thirty - maybe forty - something guy with dark hair, graying at the temples, and crows feet. Dr. Novak had asked him if there was anyone he could contact for Dean, but Dean racked his brain and couldn't come up with anything. It was exhausting, because he felt like he should have someone. It was like there was some kind of hole in his brain that was going straight through him. Some expanse in his memory that had been deleted from him.
the boss. Past tense. He just can't get me out of his head. Lunch?"
"She was
Castiel hummed in agreement, "You're very lucky to be alive, Mr..."
"Sorry," Castiel said, "I wasn't paying attention." Dean turned to look at him. Castiel wasn't looking back. He was looking to the left, eyes wide and face chalky.
Sam hummed and then rose from his seat, pointing toward the counter, "I'll be back," he assured.
âHeâs convinced thereâs a rattle,â Dean shook his head. Castiel snorted and continued cleaning the brushes, one by one.
Castiel arched up into Dean's touch when Dean stroked a hand over Castiel's exposed midriff, and Cas sighed, pulling Dean in closer.
"You snooped on Bobby?" Asked a voice from Dean's doorway. Dean turned to find Sam, arms crossed and face settled into a surprised scowl.
," Dean said to himself.
Dean smiled a little, finger tracing his parents' faces. The second, was a wide shot of a football game. John was holding two pom-poms above his head, serious expression etched onto his features. Mary was standing next to him, one hand on his uniformed chest, the other covering a wide laugh. The rest of the cheerleaders were around them laughing and clapping. The caption read,
Castiel crawled up between Dean's legs and planted a kiss on his mouth. Dean smiled, and let Cas hold his hands up by his head. Dean bucked up and dragged his cock against Castiel's bulging briefs. Cas let loose a shaky breath and,
"Really?" Castiel asked. "Maybe he's just keeping in contact with friends from high school."
âThatâs okay,â Cas said, âI want you.â Dean closed his eyes and leaned forward onto Castielâs shoulder. âAnd Iâm willing to wait.â
Sam squinted a little, looking from Dean to the window. He stared outside for a moment, eyebrows furrowed. "Uh," he began, "no. I don't think I see anyone." He looked at Dean again, who was still looking outside, staring right at the guy.
Dean set his jaw and nodded. "Fine," he said, "I'll do this on my own, then."
âIâm ordering a slice of pie,â Dean explained, pointing to the counter. Cas let his eyes fall back to his notebook without another word, and Dean headed for the front of the shop.
"Absolutely," Dean said, pressing into Castiel's hand.
In no time flat, Dean was shimmying his boxers down over his thighs, and fisting a hand around his dick. Moving slowly at first, he jerked it, feeling slow pressure start to build low in his stomach. He sighed and imagined his hand belonged to someone else as he pumped faster, flicking his hips skyward when it seemed right, feeling himself get fully erect. He didn't mean to picture Castiel between his legs, hand curling around Dean, mouth pulling that easy smile out just for him, but once he started, he couldn't stop.
. Dean raised an eyebrow at him.
you felt her. That's progress."
"It was all you, Mrs. Hutchinson," Castiel replied, "congratulations."
Deanâs friends were the source of his happiest moments, and he was never one to make them feel alone or unwanted. After all, if they had been one to make him feel at home, he felt as though it was only fair he did the same.
"Car accident," Dr. Murphy replied. Castiel had schooled his expression into something he hoped conveyed sympathy instead of horror. There was a reason he had never learned to drive. "If he makes it out of the surgery, I'm placing him under your care specifically. You're our best ICU Attending."
Cas almost giggled which was a noise Dean hadnât heard since middle school. âYouâre not a dumbass.â
"Sir," Castiel began again, taken aback by the ferocity in the man's voice. "You were in a car accident." John Doe blinked and then suddenly pain seemed to kick in and he lifted a hand to his head and winced, breathing in sharply.
Dr. Novak's mouth twisted and he tilted his head to the side. "We have steps we can take before that would happen. Are you familiar with a procedure called a Craniotomy?"
"Do you have any idea how late you are?" Bobby asked gruffly.
"Oh," Dean said, "yeah, that's fine."
Just as promised, Dr. Novak was making his way inside Dean's room in no time flat. He held a metal clipboard in front of him, looking it over before placing it in a small tray affixed to the end of Dean's bed. Dr. Novak smiled at Dean, a tight lipped, no teeth thing that looked pitiful; definitely not doing anything to help Dean's mood.
Dean glanced over at him and saw that Cas wasn't looking at him but out the window at the city. "Honestly?" Dean asked and Castiel hummed. "I don't know."
Castiel looked back up from his notebook and sighed gently, âLook, Iâm not trying to tell you what to do, but if you donât want to be a doctor, maybe you should talk to your dad.â Deanâs face contorted and, yeah, that wasnât what Dean had been hoping or expecting Cas to say, but it was what needed to be said.
"Okay," Castiel said, "that happens sometimes. What else?"
"Anyway," Sonya said, ever the mother of the bunch, "the tests for infection on Mrs. Hutchinson came back negative, she's all good. Honestly, she could be ready to be moved back to Oncology."
Dean furrowed his eyebrows, and breathed a quick laugh.
Dean Winchester wasn't the smartest guy in the world, but he knew when he wasn't wanted, and there were only so many uneasy silences and withering glances he could take, so he was packing a bag and leaving.
"Hm, that's weird," Sam said, tapping his chin and looking up contemplatively. "I could've sworn he said he was having an engine problem."
"I wasn't."
Castiel's hands found the hem of Dean's shirt. "Can you take this off?" He asked.
The lights were off in their room, but Cas was sitting up in bed, book light clipped to the top of a book Dean knew was Wuthering Heights without asking. His knees were bent upwards, balancing the book in front of his eyes. He looked over at Dean when the door opened.
âSo what,â Dean asked, âyou donât like Lisa now?â
He was never that lucky though.
Dean felt his eyes get big. He felt a swell in his chest and right behind his eyes. He felt his face get hot, invaded by a crimson blush. Castiel pulled his bag on and let himself look at Dean for a few more seconds before he left the cafÃ© and walked down the street, hunched over against the rain.
me he knew them."
"We'll remove the vent and make sure he can sustain himself, and then we'll bring him out. I'll page someone from PACU to come monitor him while he's waking up and then we'll press for information, to see if he remembers anything," Castiel told her with a nod.
"Yeah, come here, but I'm driving," Dean said.
Dean watched his brother take in the information. He looked confused, eyebrows low on his forehead, mouth parted slightly. "What?" He asked, mostly to himself. Castiel picked up the address book and held it out too. Sam looked up at him and then again to Dean before taking it. He read the notes and scribbles a few times before he repeated, "What?"
They ate dinner and drank and laughed, but at the back of Dean's mind all night was his conversation with Jody. He'd known Jody for a long time. Longer than he'd known Bobby, because she'd been the one who picked him up from his neighbors house the night his parents died. She'd taken Sam and Dean to her house that first night, but she couldn't keep them because she was already raising four girls on her own. She'd also been the one to bail Dean out whenever he got into a pinch with foster families and stuck up bitches at school and even some of her very own officers. She wouldn't lie to Dean, but then... he couldn't imagine that
"I'm Castiel Novak," he repeated with a small smile, "we're going to be good friends."
Castiel nodded laying the file flat on the counter and looking over it carefully. He'd suffered several lacerations to internal organs, a few broken bones, and a head injury that was putting intense pressure on his other organs. He'd come out of surgery a couple of hours after Castiel had left, just shy of the six hour mark that could've proven more harmful than helpful. They'd hooked him up to a ventilator and an IV drip that was working to reduce the swelling going on in his brain. The medication would be enough in a few hours to take care of the swelling, and then, when they brought him out of the medical coma, they could give him a while to recover and then put him under and look for a more lasting solution. It was commonplace for the ICU.
"I'm not waiting up," Sam complained.
Dean took a slight step back and said, âWhat?â
Castiel was in love with him?
He was never that lucky though.
, but maybe... I don't know, think about retiring or kicking the hardware store hours."
"What?" Dean asked. "He's standing way back there. Almost in the tree line. Black coat, dark hair. Can't see his face."
this means," Dean said. Castiel was sitting at Dean's desk looking at the open address book and yearbook. Dean was pacing the floor, hands in his hair.
"Just nice?" Sam questioned, bouncing his eyebrows and laughing when Dean nailed him in the chest with a loaf of bread. "Careful!" Sam admonished, "You'll crush it."
It had been so long since he'd wanted to be with someone, and the realization that he wanted someone now came as a surprise. In that moment, Dean wished Castiel was there, bending Dean over and spreading him open. He conjured the image up in his mind, Castiel's mouth wrapped around his dick while one hand worked Dean's asshole open. The scene was orgasmic in and of itself, and Dean prepared for release. Reaching down with his left hand and stroking his balls, he pictured Cas again, completely naked, held above him, cock heavy between them, and it was over. He came violently, smashing the side of his face into the pillow to keep himself from crying out, toes curling with early morning pleasure and heat.
âHe doesnât.â Dean said emphatically.
"Something wrong with the Camino?" Dean asked, leaning forward, a serious pinch between his eyebrows.
Dean felt nervous, hands sweaty as he gripped the wheel. He didn't know what he was doing. Sure, he'd wanted to see Castiel and maybe kiss him if the opportunity arose, but he didn't really know the guy. They'd had maybe three conversations, including this one, and the only thing he'd found that they had in common was seeing fucking ghosts and being attractive. Dean glanced over at Castiel and found his face screwed up in concentration, mouth puckered, brow furrowed. He looked almost pained. Dean raised an eyebrow and pulled to a stop on the side of the road. It took only a second or two before Castiel's face was relaxing into a neutral expression that Dean couldn't read.
âI resent that.â
"John Doe's a looker," Tessa added and Anna laughed.
Dean shook his head, putting Sam's fancy almond milk in the refrigerator. "I swear, we were all business."
"Of course, Mrs. Hutchinson. It's my duty as a medical professional and as your ally in all of this," Castiel said unfastening the cuff and putting it back on the rack. "Your blood pressure is good." She nodded. "I'd like you to try eating something this morning," Castiel told her. Polite but firm. "If you can keep it down, I see no reason why we can't move you back to Oncology tonight."
"Dean, please, what's going on? If something's wrong you have to talk to me about it."
Dean kept walking, beside Castiel this time. It was weird to hear someone talk about his mom. No one he knew knew anything about her -- aside from the fact that she was dead. "So she came to you? Did you know her before she died? How old are you anyway?"
"You could've borrowed Rufus's. Or Jody's," Dean said, glancing down at his shoes.
Bobby Singer and John Winchester. Standing side by side. Bobby had his arm around John's shoulders and John was grinning into the camera with one arm behind Bobby's back, the other giving a dramatized thumbs up. The caption read,
written across it in Bobby's scrawled script, letters from people named Kate Milligan and Ellen Harvelle, and a few dozen bottlecaps. So everything was fine.
"Is everything okay?" Tessa asked.
She closed her eyes, and reached out. On Dean's shoulder he felt pressure, and he could see her hand on him in his reflection, but there was nothing in his peripheral. "Please, mom." He strained his ears to hear, he saw her mouth move, but he couldn't hear her saying anything. He stared at her, eyes wide. "I can't hear you," he said, voice breaking, "try again. Please." She looked sad then, eyes closing. Her hand moved off of his shoulder and she opened her eyes.
Lisa smiled again, something soft in her eyes, "Dean Winchester," she said quietly. "How did I get so lucky?"
He was the only ICU Attending, but Castiel neglected to mention it.
Dean Winchester didn't get scared. Ever. It was like a superpower of his. He always just assumed it came with the territory. He grew up seeing ghosts.
"No," Dean admitted. "We're not really supposed to go into his office."
Anna dug for a moment and handed him the John Doe's chart. "Med coma," she said.
"Samantha, Christ, if you don't hurry!" He shouted over the sound of the shower.
"Yes," Castiel said eagerly, tongue peeking out of his mouth to wet his lips.
"This okay?" Dean asked.
Castiel embarked down the hallway, walking quickly until he was sure Gabriel had turned away out of boredom. He stopped by Mr. Smith's room, but the man was sleeping, so he continued down the hall, metal clipboard help tight in his left hand. He made his rounds, checking in idly on a few of his more critical patients, the majority of which were resting which was, decidedly, for the best.
Cas pushed at his hair, âAlready?â
"I just don't know what the
Dean just stared at him, "You don't mean that."
Dean felt his face turn red. Like actually felt it. âWhat?â Dean asked brokenly, mind supplying a number of unhelpful scenarios Castiel could be referring to. He looked away from Cas and squeezed his hands into tight fists. He was all but shaking and Castielâs hand on his face definitely wasnât helping him calm down.
"I thought you were in bed," Castiel replied, voice gentle.
Bobby took a sip and shook his head again. "Can't afford to right now. Got a kid to put through school." He closed his eyes,
"What does that mean?" Dean asked. He was staring at the guy, kind of drinking him in. He was dressed strangely, in a green and brown smock looking thing with way too tight jeans and sandals with open toes. He looked like a hipster Jesus if Jesus was white with a crew cut and five o'clock shadow.
"The hell are you still doing up?" He asked, a razor sharp edge in his voice.
Dean palmed his forehead, âNo, Iâm not,â he sighed. âCas, how long have you known?â
The man made no indication that he had heard Dean, but he turned and started to walk away. Dean didn't see where he'd gone, but he blinked and the man was no longer in sight.
âIâm turning the light on,â Dean said.
Dean made his way to his bed, laying down and sighing. He thought about Bobby and Sam and, eventually, his parents. He was graduating soon, and it sucked that his parents wouldn't get to see it. Sure, he'd been with Bobby longer than he'd known his mom and dad, but it was different. For Sam it would be easier, he'd never known them. Bobby was the only solid parental figure Sam had ever had, he even called him 'Dad.' But Dean remembered what they looked like. He remembered what their voices sounded like. He had memories of playing with them, and picking fights with his dad, making cookies with his mom. And he'd seen them from time to time even after they passed. It wasn't like he could forget them. It wasn't that he even wanted to. He missed them, but only when he thought about it, so he rolled over and tried to sleep.
He slid open the top drawer and dug through it quietly, finding about three bucks in change, an assortment of Dean and Sam's school pictures, and nothing important. The drawer below it had similar effects, a manila folder with his birth certificate along with Sam and Dean's, an uncashed check with
Dean looked at him and raised an eyebrow, "You takin' his side?"
Dean looked at him, eyes wide and almost panicked, "You do?"
"I'm sorry to hear that," Dr. Novak said with a furrow between his eyebrows. "I have a question to ask you."
"Hello, Dean," Castiel said sweetly. "How are you?"
"Jess, Madison, Ruby, Amelia," Dean counted off on his fingers, "come on, who's the
Why would he?
Castiel turned to address Jane, and said, "Thank you for voicing your concern, Ms. Hutchinson."
He shook his head, "No, but Mrs. Hutchinson consented to the tests," Castiel said, "She wants her daughter to feel secure, and, honestly, so do I."
Castiel's eyebrows and lips quirked up simultaneously, and it was equal parts endearing and aggravating. "It means I'm certifiable and you're perhaps the most beautiful person I've seen in real life."
âSorry,â Cas heaved when he had finished laughing, âitâs just that that was cute.â
"You too," Dean said flipping the light switch off when Sam had retreated into his room.
Dean was sweet with light, sun kissed hair and oval eyes of shining forest green. It was the moment Castiel met him that he truly fell in love, though it had taken many years to fully realize this fact. If there was any question, it had been removed at the onset of their adolescence.
." Castiel handed Dean his phone, a page for a new contact already pulled up.
Mrs. Hutchinson smiled, "So, my tests were good?"
It took most of Castiel's restraint not to salute him as he walked away. He was a touch socially awkward, but he wouldn't resort to showing it that boldly. As he waited for Sam to return to their table, he counted back in his head to how long it had been since they'd met up to talk. The last time he actually remembered seeing Sam was in passing back in October. He tried not to feel hurt by the fact.
"I suppose you're right," Castiel laughed.
âMhm,â Lisa said.
"Yeah. Before I pulled over. You had this like," Dean made a motion of twisting up his face with his hand, "
Dean's head was spinning. The letter was old, almost as old as Dean apparently, and it included a picture of a baby and all the details of a torrid affair between his father and this Kate woman. An affair that resulted in a son named Adam.
"John Winchester, Mary Campbell -- 746 S Valley View Rd. Dean Henry, Samuel William," Dean read quietly. His face felt too hot. No, the air felt too hot. He was burning up. Sweating. How long had he been in here? He looked back down at the address book, and read it again. Underneath the careful print was a little note scribbled and starred. "Dean, Samuel -- where?? 1409 E Benson Rd. 315 W Lotta St. 2430 W Mesa Pass. 110 N Mystic Cir. 176 S Louise Ave. 883 S Homan Pl." The list went on like that, and each address was crossed out and the word 'where' had been circled a shitload of times.
"Come on, kid, we're just trying to learn. What's he like?" Bobby asked. It would've sounded genuine had Dean missed the gleam of humor in his eyes. Sam practically squealed with delighted laughter.
"Hey, Cas," Dean said, smiling for the first time all day.
Castiel looked over at Dean and gave him a soft smile. "When someone like you asks someone like me out, they don't say no."
"That's okay," Castiel said quickly, "most times you can't, so it's nothing to be upset about. It's not like reading an alive person's lips. It's much harder." Dean didn't say anything, just listened to Castiel's easy breathing. "Are you alright?" He asked after it had been quiet for too long.
Sam sighed and rubbed his temples, "Yeah, Dean. I do."
"What is that, like, 500 miles?"
"I can get you some water, but nothing else for the pain right now," she said, looking apologetic. "I've paged Dr. Novak, and he'll be in a minute or two to discuss a few things with you."
She fumbled on the table next to her for her cellphone. "I have to call my family," She said with a laugh. Castiel smiled at her again, and pulled the door shut behind him.
âI think thatâs bullshit.â
Dean breathed a laugh and Castiel pulled away from Dean a little. Dean felt his heart pick up again as he looked at Cas. Their faces were close, if he angled forward just slightly, they'd be touching. As it were, Dean could feel little huffs of Castiel's breath on his chin and mouth. Castiel touched his forehead to Dean's and closed his eyes. It was too tender a moment for two near strangers, but Dean closed his eyes too, and together they sat. Saying nothing, breathing each other in, being close.
There was silence on the other end, and then shifting, and a door closing. "I was just thinking about you," Castiel said, softly, like a secret, "I should have called."
Dean and Sam had a brother.
honestly. It had been a while.
Castiel laughed and said, "Sure. I'll be there in a few. See ya."
"Um, sir," Castiel said, stopping him before he turned away. "What's the patient's name?"
"Sure thing," Dean said flipping the rag he'd been holding over his shoulder so he could lean forward, take Lisa's hand and press a chaste kiss to her mouth. "See you later. Ben."
Dr. Novak nodded, "Thank you." Dean pressed his lips together and nodded too. "Now," Dr. Novak began, "we've got some medical things we need to discuss."
dad. Realize that and suck it up."
"What if you weren't?" Dean asked, "The last thing I'd have done was flip you off."
Castiel nodded and pointed a finger up in solidarity. "Exactly."
"So I could talk to you about this more," Dean said quickly. He laughed nervously. "Questions and stuff."
alright." He nodded at Dean and Dean nodded back. "Okay?"
"'S no problem," he said with the bottle flush to his lips.
kick his ass. Turns out false confidence can only go so far when up against a royal flush.
He was surprisingly gentle. His voice, his movements, his smile. Nearly everything about him lacked the hard edge he initially presented, much to his disdain.
"What, are we not getting dressed today?" Dean asked, pouring himself a cup of coffee and raiding the fridge for a piece of pie from a diner in town.
Castiel nodded and then looked back at Dean, smiling sheepishly. âDo you hate me?â
"Okay," Castiel replied, but he didn't elaborate so Dean just rolled his eyes and pulled away from the curb. It took him a while, but eventually Castiel spoke again. "Dean, why did you invite me out?"
"Bobby."
Dean looked around. The only people even remotely near them were the people walking their dogs across the street -- two girls with four yappy little Pomeranians. "Uh," Dean said.
Sam nodded and disappeared into the only airconditioned part of the shop, the waiting room. Dean got behind the wheel and backed out into the grass car waiting area. He went back into the shop, waving the next car in line into the garage.
The woman just kept looking at him. She took a step forward and reached out with one hand, but Dean took a step back, bumping into the counter. Water splashed from Dean's cup, and he looked down to see where it had landed. He folded the pants leg of his pajamas under his foot, and wiped it up. When he looked back up, the woman was gone. He wasn't scared, but he dumped his water in the sink and took the stairs two at a time back up to his room.
Fogies Liquor Gallery and Falls Park are both real places that I'd give my left leg to go to,, real shit.
Dean glared at him, "
His tone of voice was confused, not condescending, so Dean said, "Well, behind me, but I could only see her in the mirror."
Dean knew he couldn't avoid the hospital staff for forever, but if he could get away with not talking to anyone smarter than him for the rest of the day, he'd consider that a win. From what he'd been able to glean from the endless barrage of medical professionals earlier, it didn't seem like he was going to be leaving anytime soon. Not that he knew exactly where it was he would be leaving to. Even if he didn't know what was wrong with him, or who he really was, he hated the hospital, had since he was a kid, and it stemmed from his lack of trust in others. The only people he could trust were...
"I've seen her," Dean confessed after a beat of silence, "lots of times, but she's never talked to me before."
Castiel was staring at the empty desk, not speaking. He looked awkward and uncomfortable and Dean thought that he should probably apologize to him, but he didn't, he just sat down on the floor and spread the books out in front of him. He was going to figure it out. Regardless of what Sam said or thought. And he knew that Sam cared somewhere deep down. He was going to figure it out for both of them.
They sat in comfortable silence for a while, and when Cas had finished with the brushes, he stood in front of Dean, almost between his knees. Dean swallowed and Castiel raised an eyebrow. âAre you alright?â
Castiel looked up when Gabriel tapped the desk by Castiel's left elbow where he'd been leaning on the nurses station. He righted himself immediately, and told himself to smile. "How're the big leagues?" Gabriel asked with a waggle of his eyebrows.
He glanced at the nurse call button, and then looked away. He wasn't going to ask for help. Didn't want to, anyway, but his hand acted without asking his common sense, so he found himself pressing it. It made an annoying little ding and then flashed a faint red, and Dean yawned and then winced when a muscle in his side twinged.
Tessa smiled kindly at him and handed the chart to Sonya to file away, "Sure thing, Cas."
"I guess so," Dean said, gesturing with a roll of paper towels. "He was nice."
"The very same. What can I do for you?" Dean asked. He scrubbed his hands on a greasy red rag he pulled from his pocket and stepped around the front of the car.
"Shows swelling has gone down," Sonya noted.
She offered Dean a smoke - which he accepted - and watched him intently as she lit up.
She hummed, "You're very good with them." Castiel looked back at the monitor in his hand and let her continue speaking. "When you spoke with Jane yesterday," she said, "that was the first time I'd seen her so calm. I really appreciate that you took her seriously."
He headed down the hallway, unbuttoning his jeans as he walked and stepping out of them as he shut his bedroom door. The room was a warm, reprieve from the draftiness of his house which was almost lethal in the middle of December like they were right now. He dove into bed, savoring the brief few hours of sleep he got before six o'clock came around and Dean was forced back into the Impala trucking toward Singer's Auto Shop.
Castiel said, "You too, Dean," and then he was gone, disappearing down the three-stepped deck onto the gravel pathway to the shop.
Castiel sighed, pressing infinitesimally Â closer to Dean. "We should go sometime. It's
But the doctor was looking at him earnestly, almost sad, so he decided to try thinking a little harder.
"Me and Sam?" Castiel said, eyebrows raised and hands shaking.
Dean stared at him for a minute. He knew he was missing things. That he had gaps. It both did and didn't make sense that having a brother would be lost to these gaps. "Yeah," Dean said, before he'd considered it too thoroughly. "Sure, whatever you think."
"Be my guest," Dean said, gesturing toward it. He pulled the yearbook over to himself and slipped through the index to locate his father's name.
"Thanks, Bobby," Dean said through a yawn.
"I didn't even know they still made phone books," Dean mused, Castiel laughed. "Why did you look for me?"
Dean Winchester never expected to fall in love with his best friend, and he certainly didnât expect to be waiting in his car outside the apartment they shared with a bouquet of flowers.
The Castiel guy laughed. He twisted a large gold ring around his thumb, "Um,
about me?"
"That's nice," Castiel said with a smile.
âIf I had a date, you would be the first to know,â Castiel said, stopping short of what he really wanted to say which was that if Cas had a date, it would ideally be with Dean, not hidden from him. Dean scrunched up his face and stood up from the table, hating the way Cas watched him, looking equal parts kicked puppy and scorned lover.
Dean leaned his elbows on the counter and sighed. He really was a dipshit.
"Big win?" Dean said to himself. He flipped back to the last picture of Bobby and the football team. He read through the names listed quickly, eyes finding J. Winchester supernaturally quick. His eyes scanned the rest of the team, and there he was. Dean's dad. John Winchester. Number 18. The quarterback.
The doctor waited for a moment, probably unsure if Dean was going to continue or not, but then he continued. "A friend of mine has a brother who is missing," he said, wringing his hands awkwardly. Dean raised an eyebrow. "My friend's name is Sam, does that name mean anything to you?"
"Shut up," Dean groaned, dragging a hand down his face.
Dean looked at his watch. Cas was right. Like always.
Now though, he took the stairs slowly, avoiding the fifth and ninth steps because he knew they creaked. He stepped off the stairs and onto the rug at the bottom, traversing his way into the living room. He paused in the middle of the room, craning his neck to check up the stairs and make sure no one was snooping on his snooping.
âCas, dude, what the fuck?â
He bid Bobby and Sam a quick goodbye and Drove into town, heading for Fogies Liquor Gallery, his personal favorite. He did just as Bobby had instructed, ending up with a bottle of Jack Daniels, some Jose Cuervo for himself, and four six packs. Somehow, he'd managed to make his way out to the Impala in one trip. Just as he'd loaded up his car, Sheriff Mills pulled into the parking spot next to him.
"Yeah that's not happening anytime soon," Dean said with a snort, pointing at his brother.
âI like you,â Dean said.
"Okay," Dean said, "I'll see you in a bit."
âBroke what?â Dean asked.
"Holy shit."
Anna said, "Yeah you will!" and Tessa wolf-whistled. Castiel rolled his eyes, but was smiling, and he made his way to Mrs. Hutchinson's room to deliver the good news.
"Hey, phone works both ways," Dean said, and then, "Would you wanna go for a drive?"
Sam was watching Dean sadly. It was so much simpler for him, he didn't know the Winchester parents. He didn't have to confront losing them head on. It wasn't
âI didnât want you to get upset,â Castiel told him. âYou have a veryâ¦ interesting view of masculinity. I didnât want to encroach upon that.â
Bobby went to the table and sat in the chair next to Sam and patted the empty one next to him, looking up at Dean and tilting his head at it. Dean did as was suggested, and sat where he had been before. Sam was still looking at him sympathetically, and it turned Dean's stomach. He just wanted to be left alone right now. It was bad enough he'd been seconds away from a fucking panic attack in front of his brother and Bobby. Now Sam wouldn't quit looking at him like that, and no one was saying anything.
"Off work?" Dean asked, "At fucking
"College?" Dean said, and then, "Who the fuck
"Cas--"
"Uh, your mom," Castiel said, "Mary? She wanted me to let you know that she's okay. And that she loves you." He fidgeted where he was standing.
The doctor waited for a moment, probably unsure if Dean was going to continue or not, but then
Dean typed his number into Castiel's phone, and then handed it back and smiled at him a little. Castiel looked flustered for the first time in their entire encounter, and Dean let himself take a good look at him. He was more attractive than most guys Dean knew; flesh like light honey dusted with cherry flush on the soft parts and lips chapped but tinted shiny with balm. "Nice meeting you," Dean said, swallowing thickly.
Dean shook his head, he recalled the memory easily. "She reached for me," he admitted, "but I didn't... I stepped back."
âNo one says you have to be,â Cas replied lifting a shoulder. His hands were on Deanâs knees now and he was pressing on them for support. Dean knew the drill. It was the 'I'm giving you options and letting you know that you're safe by reassuring touch' routine. âNo oneâs asking you to do anything.â
Castiel snorted a laugh and said, "Okay."
âI know.â
"Half day," Castiel said nonchalantly, "I get special treatment."
it read, complete with a smiling, yellow emoji. Dean typed back a quick reply of
âIâm actually incredibly smart.â
The ICU was normally pretty calm, as surprising as that may seem, and Castiel often took that for granted. Only when he was in the ER did he truly realize how intensely lucky he actually was to have a job where he could dedicate most of his time to a handful of patients who - if Castiel were going to brag - typically made it out of his unit. He took a breath and stepped out of the elevator and towards the nurse's station.
He'd thought about it for months now, as he had been forced to watch Castiel and Sam grow ever closer, feeling his chest collapsing with every day that passed. Even now the two were out grabbing groceries at the store a few blocks from their loft, giving Dean his perfect exit. He grabbed all of his essentials: a toothbrush, clothes to change into, a couple tapes, the picture he had of his mom, and then turned to face the room, a little uncomfortable that his most important things barely filled a duffel bag. He could call Sam when he got settled somewhere and arrange a time to get the rest of his things, but he couldn't stand living with Cas anymore. Forced to see his stupid beautiful face and not be able to do anything about it. He sighed and then flicked his bedroom light off, retreating from the room and pulling the door shut. When he'd moved in with Cas he figured it would be a mistake but he'd hoped he could handle it Â and he had for a while, but he'd never imagined that his brother would fall for the same guy. He took a look around the living room, frowning and sighing as he reached for the door, but he pulled it open and was nose to nose with the blue eyed man of his nightmares.
