‘’If you didn’t want me to be making noises. I wouldn’t have been making noises. I think you made your place and status quite clear.
''We have to let Dean know we haven't given up, and that he can fight Michael. He's done it before, and Michael left because of his strugelling. If he really tries he can banish him. I'm sure of that.''
Cas couldn’t blame her, last time he’d drank too much he’d ended up crashing Meg’s motorcycle against a three, he couldn’t even remember how he’d ended up driving in the first place, Castiel had no license or the experience to ride a motor, but yet he’d convinced Meg that he could drive, and was sober enough to do so, which had obviously not been the case and had ended badly for the both of them.
He walked through the halls until he got to the right door, opened it, and when he went inside he found Castiel and Dean very much asleep in the same bed.
He had just pushed most of it to the back of Castiel’s mind, locked it in place and healed some of the damage it had already done.
He himself was a bit suprised at how bad he looked, there was a big deep cut, still bleeding in his stomach, and some smaller cuts and bruises that shouldn't be there anymore.
‘’CAS!?’’ He shouted, he banged his hands on the glass, but his friend didn’t wake and the glass was still whole.
''Owh cut the shit. You can shove your destiny crap right back up you feathery ass, I don't want to hear another word about it ever again.''
‘’Yeah- And I was a douche. I Panicked, hurt him more by sending him away- But he was better off without me anyways. I would only attract danger… It was my job to protect him. But I guess you two have been doing that for me lately.’’
Castiel felt something warm flow through his stomach, the same feeling he got when Dean was the one smiling at them.
‘’Nope. So, what’ya say? We gonna you another round of coffee and get high or you gonna stare at that real empty lookin' paper for another 4 hours?’’
Castiel thought about what home meant for Dean, a little while back it would've been his car, and the brother sitting beside him in that car.
Castiel had been told it was gonna be just a few friends, some beers and good music, but because news spread fast around campus, the dorm room he shared was now filled to the brim with loud adolescents screaming along to a song everybody knew because it came out five years ago but recently started to go viral again, with the singer being involved in a robbery or something, Castiel hadn’t cared enough to read the entire article making its rounds on social media, he didn’t even like the song, or the artist.
''Dean, if you're in there. I'm sorry.'' He said when he plunched his Angel blade into Michaels leg.
''Your deal with the empty. You did me quiet a favor actually, he's even more silent now. He doesn't want to fight and come back, because when he does. He has the change of loosing his precious but pathetic excuse for an angel again.''
‘’I made a choice Dean, I died saving you, and it was my choice, I will never regret making that choice, and I hope my choice isn’t for nothing and you didn’t do something that would bring your life in danger, but if you brought me back, and want me to deny or ignore what I said before I died, then you can send me back. I don’t want my memories of you to be lies.’’
‘’He- he would’ve gotten to me another way. He wanted me Dean, so he would have done whatever it takes..’’
‘’Okay, good. Wake me if you need anything.’’ Dean placed his jacket under his head and got comfortable on the ground.
Castiel had never felt this nervous in his life before, okay- well, that would be a lie, Luke and Meg had put him in some pretty nerve wrecking situations, so let’s just say he’s never been this nervous to talk to a stranger in his life instead.
‘’Sorry Dean, I’m with Cas here. We don’t know if those monsters are actually.. well uhm.. monsters.’’
‘’You seem tired, why don’t you try and get some sleep while we sew you up huh? Might make it easier for us. And what do we do about your uhm…’’ Dean glazed over at the giant black wings, they were damaged and causing Cas a lot of pain. And Dean couldn’t stand to see Cas in pain. Hell, he’d seen more than enough of that for a lifetime. Especially after today.
‘’He told me he had written me out of the story.. But I maybe that’s been going on long before you two were even born. I think to some degree, he knew the entire plan from the very start. He knew Cas was going to choose Dean. And that’s why he wanted me out of the way.’’
‘’You looking for this?’’ A voice vaguely familiar said as an arm reached over next to Dean’s shoulder with the remote in hand.
‘’Dean, they didn’t deserve to live their lives in cages. They may be monsters, but they’re not someones pets.’’
‘’I won’t let it get bad unless you guys won’t do what I say. I can either leave Castiel human. And alive… or drain his life-force really slowly.. and really painfully while letting Zachariah and Uriel be artistic with him… If you know what I mean.’’’
Zachariah seems impressed at that one. And it gave Castiel a small amount of satisfaction to see the surprise on his face.
Even Cas didn’t like the quiet, and he would often wander the kitchen late at night and try to pick something up on angel radio, Dean would find him in these times and they would talk in hushed voices before going back to the room they now shared.
‘’Yes, you are a stubborn little creature and I have the feeling that all that pain will only test you to try your limits. That’s why I’m healing you next. Give me your hand.’’
‘’Those were not-‘’ Cas looked at Dean’s raised head and eyebrow on his shoulder, before saying ‘’Nevermind.’’ and dropping it.
So I had to write it again by memory and added some stuff but I just wasn't able to save everything.
Humans don't deserve praise, they are toxic. They destroy, wage wars, murder. I simply want to change that, stop their suffering. I'm not an enemy Castiel. I'm giving you one chance, help me bring peace to this earth once again.''
Tw// Child abuse/neglect, homophobia, homophobic slurs, recreational drug use (weed) and mentions of alcoholism
Dean opened his mouth a bit and Castiel got the hint, brushing Dean’s tongue slightly with his, before breaking apart.
with her favourite crystals in the entire world. Either way, he wanted to get the real ones because only the real ones would be good enough for her, even
‘’She had a spell. I couldn’t control my vessel anymore. I- I couldn’t move. She handcuffed me with Enochian cuffs and dumped me in the back of the van. I should’ve seen it coming.. I should’ve.. ’’
‘’The price was my life, when I experienced a moment of true happiness, the Empty would be summoned and it would take me forever.’’
‘’Sammy and I managed to get the bullet out, but it’s not healing. Is there something else she did with your grace?’’
‘’That’s where you are wrong Cassie, they aren’t. They almost ended the world- several times! And I’m sure Dean killed innocents, probably more than just one.. I know all about his little demon adventure. No, you and the Winchesters need to be stopped. You need to suffer. I’m simply doing my job here Castiel, and it’s long overdue.’’
‘’You can’t really call him my husband now, can’t you? Because I was stupid and dumb, I didn’t realise what I had until it was gone. So like you.’’
As Chuck was distracted by Gabriel, Dean took an angel blade out of his boot and plunged it in chuck’s stomach, he wanted to say something snarky and punch the motherfucker in the face for all the shit he put them through, but his first priority right now was getting Cas and Sam to safety.
Again on his tippy toes back to the library, because he still didn’t believe that Chuck hadn’t placed any side effects in Castiel, but he also still didn’t know what Chuck had done.
Castiel and Dean watching movies together on the couch, Cas, Jack Sam and Dean having an family dinner in the bunker. And all the rare moments when Castiel was laughing, right there in Deans mind.
‘’Except when the stab wound healed, it wasn’t my grace doing it. It was something dark, something old, and Chuck said you made a deal.’’
Dean tasted like vodka and mint, and Castiel could smell his cologne, it was a strong one, and kind of spicy, but it smelled like Dean. Castiel liked that too.
‘’Owh I just do my research, read the internet.. those great Winchester novels helped quit a bit. And now I get to add you to my collection! You will fit right in. And, I know for a fact, that if you touch the Winchester’s pet angel.. they will come running right into your arms! So don’t worry, you won’t be alone for too long Cas.’’
*I'm not American. I am lesbian. No but for real, I'm dutch. So if I make any typo's uhhh.. yeh you can blame me. I re-read my fics myself but probably won't notice them until I've finished this fic and one day decide I want to laugh at myself. :)
She grabbed Castiel by his wings, (which Dean confirmed were definitely a 100% real) and dragged his lifeless body out of the freezing room.
‘’Ah, that’s why you’re this grumpy. Have you had your coffee yet? We can go and get some if you want.’’
‘’He isn’t at peace, he told me he hated that place, it’s worse than hell because at least hell is something.’’
Anyway, his shouting seemed to have worked, because the angel shot to a sitting position right away.
‘’Alright, yeah, I know. I’m not flirting my way outta this one. Okay, so. I summoned the Empty, because I wanted to get you back.’’
He punched Castiel in the face, 1 time, 2 time, and when Castiel started to see double Zachariah jumped in.
She began to speak Enochian, before the second word of the spell had been spoken Castiel could already feel them start to move.
‘’You fell asleep yesterday so that means you can try eating now, and most of the damage is not all of the damage.’’
‘’We brought you here. You’re still alive. I’m sure Chuck will understand when we remind him how infuriating you really are.’’ Zachariah said, still keeping himself calm.
Dean shouted along with Castiel, making threads and loosing track of how many times he’d said the word bitch.
''Okay, about what Michael had said.. God-'' Dean scratched the back of his head, struggeling to find the right words. ''This is gonna be impossible, but uhm- Wel.. He's right... I don't know when it started, but these feelings... I don't really understand them. I just know that they are there for a reason.. And I didn't think I would ever be able to feel them for a men.. But then again, you're not a man. You're an angel, so maybe that's even more impossible. I don't know Cas.''
‘’Can you even start a sentence without ‘’So get this?’’ We’re not listening any better if that’s what you think it does.’’
‘’Playing the silent game huh? We’ll fix that soon enough. Let’s get you settled in your new home first.’’
Castiel finally screamed both out of hurt and pain and when Zachariah had dropped the whip and left the room, he passed out.
And of course that was the moment Sam had chosen to enter the hotel room and prevent Dean from reacting to that sentence and helping his best friend(ish).
''What a strange being you are Castiel... It such a shame the empty will take you so soon... again. It would be a waste using my powers on a thing that is already lost.'' Michael's said in a twisted grin.
‘’I-uhh.. ‘’ Castiel scratched the back of his neck but before he knew it Dean had pulled him from the bed and was holding onto
‘’Oh my god I know you're worried. I know your madly in love with my little brother- which by the way is a surprise to absolutely no one, and by the way you should still get my blessing for because you’ve been a dick to him, but can you shut up for one darn second and let me talk before I make your nostrils disappear?’’
Cas noticed Dean did that a lot, he always needs to have or do something with his hands, he fidgeted a lot, subconsciously or not, but Cas didn’t mind, he just wondered why that was so he stored it away in his brain to ask about another time, it wasn't important for now.
Sam stared out of the window, there weren’t a lot of stars to see. The room was on the second floor and Sam could see quit a lot from here, the streets had a creepy glow caused by the streetlights. It was completely empty, no cars in the parking lot and no people wondering around.
He placed his hand on top of Dean’s and slowly moved it from his head to Dean's chest, keeping it in place with his own hand.
‘’Our father has been spotted on earth, you have to prepare, he could very well finish all of heaven when he’s done with his vengeance on earth.
Castiel didn’t hesitate and jumped off the bed, he already knew who she was, the description he’d gotten of her fitted perfectly.
''The deal you made. What did the empty mean by that? A-are you gonna die again soon? I- I don't want you.. to leave again...''
The team decided to split up, Dean and Castiel going to find Kaia and retrieve the spear as Jack and Sam went to search for the hyperbolic pulse generator Ketch had send them via mail.
‘’Yeah. And I see that now, and it wasn’t only then.. It’s.. I’ve been treating him like dirt for a long time. Because I figured that if I couldn’t face me feeling what I feel for him, I might as well push him away.’’
Dean smiled. ’’Sam’s not his full name either, his ‘’long’’ name is Samuel, but he hates that name, Sammy annoys him enough though, so that’s my favourite.’’
‘’I summoned my alternate universe bro look alike before we left trough the rift. He turns out to be really chill, not busy with the war there at all. We went to get a beer before we swapped. Felt kinda bad about him dying.’’
‘’Normally I don’t give spoilers, but you’re special Cassie.. I’ve been testing on other angels for a long time, all leading up to this moment. Leading up to owning you. And soon enough, owning Dean Winchester.’’
‘’I would appreciate what?’’ Gabriel appeared around the corner, tv-remote in one hand and an almost empty bag of m&m’s in the other.
Dean and Sam had still been sitting on the ground in the bunker, Dean had calmed down by now and they had talked about Cas, still without a way to bring him home.
‘’Some ancient jewels, for his freaking wife. I don’t get it though, the guy is successful and had no connections
Surprisingly, the wings didn't weigh that much, Castiel was another story, he always seemed like a skinny guy, but he had a lot of muscle.
‘’You really thought you could just teleport them out of this? This whole thing is about them. One of them dies and I let Cas go. I can let you go too and take care of your brother if you stop fighting this. Stop fighting me.’’
Castiel smiled, he laying on Dean’s chest and absently drawing circles on his stomach with his finger.
I used to feel frustrated, sometimes, but even after that one time I left, when I was ready to move on from you, I came back. I hope you know I will always find my way back to you.
He stepped over Uriel’s body (Uriel got the better deal and went to the empty, he didn’t disobey his orders directly but still didn’t stick to the plan) and went to take a stroll in the park.
Did Castiel really want to go back? No, he hated that building, and he didn’t wanna see Louise (even in her Dead form) ever again, he wasn’t afraid of her… He just didn’t like the memories that would come up with seeing her body again.
Castiel blinked and regained his train of thought, he strutted (as silently as he could) to where Dean was standing.
He felt her lift him up and heard the sound of metal chains as she put much heavier cuffs on him which were attached to the ceiling.
He debated on telling Dean about his nightmare as the atmosphere around them shifted into something more serious,
Cas let out a hiss as Dean’s elbow accidentally bumped into Cas’s left wing and Dean muttered a small; ‘’Sorry.’’
because even though he liked a lot of attention and behaved like a child most of the time, Luke was a good listener, smarter than he let out, and there for Cas when he needed to be.
It also goes slightly deeper into what can be some heavy subjects for some of you, so if you're sensitive to
‘’There won’t be a right time. It’s a stupid excuse for not telling him, you fight monsters for a goddamn living! Yet you two run around each other like two scared school crushes and I’m so done with it!’’
Then in one quick movement, Chuck grabbed the angel blade out of Cas’ hand and shoved it in his stomach.
When he slowly dared to open his eyes he realised the source of the warmth, he was laying in a ring of holy fire.
with any criminals, until he decided he wanted to become one by stealing jewels he could easily afford the replica’s of.’’
of memories of said angel ) a knife from hell, ( Ruby’s trusty weapon should work just fine), and a cross from heaven. (thank god they lived in the bunker and somehow had it laying around, he did not want to deal with Cas’ less loveable family ever again. )
‘’We kinda had to be, our mum died when I was four years old, Sammy was just six months. Our dad was a wreck after that, it messed him up real bad, and
''We are wasting time. Dean is going to fight you. He knows you're here, and he knows we need him.'' Castiel said, he locked eyes with Dean as he said the last words of that sentence, letting Dean know that mainly- Castiel needed him.
Castiel knew they were looking for him, he’d heard Dean pray to him, to stay where he was. That prayer had been a waste of time, but Castiel did know now that the brothers were looking for him.
Dean never knew that Cas started caring about humans, about the world, about what happened to everyone on it, because he started caring about Dean.
Castiel tried to focus on the texture of the towel so he didn't have to think about what was about to happen.
But it's not the same as waiting for that episode when you get home from a long day of school. Waiting for it all day and avoiding (then saying fuck it) spoilers on social media.
''Owh... I understand. Well, we're back. Fully. Will you join us when you've finished your computergame?''
Eventually Louise came back, she was pushing a tray with painful looking things and Castiel swallowed.
‘’Maybe not with any regular blade.’’ Dean grinned as he jumped off the bed and grabbed the scythe. ‘’But this bad boy oughta do the trick.’’
And yes- Maybe it wasn’t the smartest move to watch a show he really enjoyed while drunk, because tomorrow he wouldn’t remember any of it.
He didn't want to be possesed again, he didn't want to be trapped inside is own head and helpless again.
Luke was like this, always doing the most to get a laugh out of people, but it (for the most part) seemed to work, and at times his best friend could be genuinely funny. But Luke wasn’t just that, he was more than trying to be the clown at every party,
Meanwhile Cas and Dean we're arguing like a married couple because Cas wouldn't take his clothes off.
‘’So, still no word from Cas?’’ Dean asked for the fourth time that day as he walked down the stairs.
He’d fallen asleep while working on an essay, again. He sighed and took in a shaky breath, as he rubbed his eyes.
''Knew it, It was taking too damn long man. I almost thought I was going to tie you both down and force you to talk about your feelings. Or that I was going to drag dean's ass out of that stupid closet.'' '
‘’.. I don’t know. What I do know is that Chuck thinks you can fuck things up real good for him. And I know you can. We’re coming to help you with it. But.. what I’m trying to say is.. hang in there. Don’t give up. We’re going to keep fighting. You know the drill.’’
The cold was biting on Castiel’s skin and his wings. He tried to keep moving, and had slowly unfolded his wings, curiously flapping them around.
‘’He had a weird attitude towards me. It was somehow possessive and It made me feel really uncomfortable.’’
''Don't be this hard on yourself, you were a child too, with a lot of responsibility you shouldn't have to carry.''
‘’You don’t own me. I’m not a collectible, and you will never get your hands on Dean. You’ll die for just looking at him.’’
Dean let go of Cas’s hand to shove the chair away, but as soon as he sat down next to Castiel, the angel reached for his hand again.
Thanks for reading and leaving kudos. And this won't be the last Destiel fic I'm going to write, so if you liked this one be sure to check every now and then for future works :)
It was too late anyways. Louise was working on his chains, when he was free she held an angelblade to his chin.
Dean was just as done with it being left unsaid as Cas. So it was here, with the fire of horrible memories still burning bright beside them that Dean finally made a move.
So, I used the trailer for 14x10 for a lil bit of help, in the next chapter that's also going to come back a little bit.
‘’I was planning on killing Sam, but you Winchesters don’t have the habit of staying dead, and I don’t need him out there hunting for me and killing everybody in his way for his brother and angelic tool. So he can stay here. With you.’’
But Dean eyes focused on something else, lying on the ground, a weapon dropped by someone who’d disappeared into nothingness.
‘’Shit. That would make sense, she would know enough tricks’n shit to be able to get to Cas because she was prepared.’’
Because what came next was thousand of screams, flashes of light, thunder, high pitched cries, and Gabriel glowing furiously bright in the middle of it.
Dean and Sam would probably be better off without him and none of the two brothers would have to die.
''Mmhpff...'' Dean looked over to see if Castiel was okay with this and actually saw the angel biting his lips while his eyes were closed.
‘’Okay, Okay!’’ Luke raised his hands, and had the audacity to look shocked even with a smile on his face ‘’Let’s keep the violence to a minimum, I’m really not in the mood to deal with cops tonight, you wanna go find the others?’’
‘’And do you care to remember how he comes back?! He comes back bloody and broken and barely alive! He doesn’t give a shit about himself and it scares me to death! I’m sick of it Sam, we’re going to find him BEFORE some rogue angel or demon does this time.’’
his mistakes. All the times he was killed playing over and over again, the times he'd let the Winchesters down. the times he'd let himself down and all seen from Dean's eye.
She dumped him in the back of a white van, before closing the doors she took a set off Enochian cuffs out of her pocket.
‘’Come in!’’ Dean shouted, instantly recognising the pattern. And absolutely not wanting to get up yet.
The next morning it was like Castiel was flying once again, although he probably would never be able to fly for real again, this feeling was probably the closest he was ever going to get again.
''Why is it always a creepy warehouse?'' Dean sighed as he parked the impala, they had traced the phonecall to this adress and ignored all the stop signs on the way.
‘’It was nice to just be with you, and Cas, I promise you, we’re going to be together again. I’m gonna get you back.’’
Cas’s eyes became wide, and he was sure he would’ve cried if he wasn’t already in such a vulnerable position.
But it seemed like that was going to change soon, because the woman lifted Castiel over her shoulder and carried him out of the motel.
‘’Ta-ta-ta. I’m not gonna break a deal over nothing. If you want Casti-feel back, you need to make a deal with me.’’
‘’Zachariah and Ishim don’t care about anyone other than themselves, my parent’s don’t believe in talking about stuff, Gabe moved away and isn't always able to check up on him and Anna is just a year older than him and very different.’’
Just when he was about to throw a tantrum and start punching things, a black goo spilled all over the sigil, it absorbed all the things laying in it and slowly formed a figure.
‘’I’m wondering Castiel. You seem to have an unlimited amount of faith in these brothers, but they are surely taking there time to show up huh? Do you think they are even looking for you at all? Or do you think they haven’t even noticed that you’re gone?’’
When Dean wasn't asleep or on a hunt with Sam they would sit in Castiel's room and watch movies, movies that had been brought out recently so Castiel wouldn't spoil the entire thing because of the knowing every book/movie thing Metatron had done to him.
‘’Is this what you think that angels wore back in the days? We almost never came down to earth, and we would do our best to fit in, we wouldn’t wear clothing like this except if it’s what everyone wore, this outfit also seems rather vulnerable, and we fought battles. This can’t protect you in a fight.’’
‘’I don’t know man… I think we should get a room here and just continue this as a normal hunt. Ask the locals if there are more disappearances around here.’’
Dean didn’t question it, already having guessed what was going on, he simply nodded and went to get Sam and Jack, also thinking ahead and grabbing the scythe while he was at it.
Dean didn’t know where to begin… Yes. Heaven seemed like a good place, but what would they do when they got there?
‘’Hhm… ‘’ the Empty hummed. ‘’Death’s scythe, pointy little thing that is. Not a big fan myself but I guess if you want to be dramatic it’s an off switch for some of us.’’
He used to barely notice when Cas left, because he knew that he would be back. Dean was already feeling guilty about the fight, and then he got taken… That guilt mixed with anger.. sadness…maybe even desperation.
First Zachariah and Uriel disobeyed his DIRECT order, and then he goes to check on the Winchesters.. and they still haven’t decided.
‘’And why would that be a hard deal for me to make? Because I’m not getting what’s the catch for you here.’’
Castiel sipped his beer, as he looked around the room, the green eyes still in the back of his mind.
‘’Don’t try anything.’’ She slipped a pair of Enochian handcuffs on him again and the few seconds Castiel could feel his grace flow freely in his body were over.
‘’How long is he planning on staying?’’ Dean said while glaring at the empty space where Gabriel just stood.
Gabriel placed his glowing hand on Cas’s shoulder and Castiel seemed to calm down a bit, gasping heavily while doing so.
That’s why when he heard that something was coming for Dean Winchester he didn’t hesitate and left the bunker with a mission.
Dean didn’t see Sam’s smile at the small gesture until he turned because he almost forgot to ask his brother something.
‘’...And I fought Dad but he already had most of your real form inside of him, I had to cast it out before killing him.’’
His head was hurting. Really bad, and he couldn’t remember what happened or why he was in the bunker instead of in Heaven or dead.
Dean lifted Castiel to take the weight of the wings, Sam was tall enough to reach the hooks in Castiel's wings.
Louise lifted her head once more and a small grin appeared on her face when her eyes closed for the last time.
Dean smiled sadly, and it may have been a trick of the light, but Castiel could swear his eyes were tearing up.
They walked further through the hallway and discovered that she’d frozen all kinds of monsters, all wearing some type of costume and looking way too pale.
‘’Yeah.’’ Dean scratched the back of his head. ‘’That’s one word for it I guess, the guy I shared the room with dropped out in the first week, administration
Dean smiled as he took Castiel’s hand in his, Castiel tried very hard to ignore the way that it made his spine tingle as Dean guided him to the door.
‘’No. But she thought all hunters are the same, I tried to talk with her and explain that wasn’t the truth, but she was not to be bargained with.’’
''I indeed was. You and Sam ruined my plan, took me away from Dean. Now.. I'm gonna call the Winchesters...'' Michael held Castiel's phone in front of his face.
Zachariah went to stand behind Cas and started to whip his back with a scourge made of melted down angel blades.
After 43.357 seconds the van stopped, which meant he was a little over 12 hours away from the motel.
‘’Good.’’ Dean nodded and rushed over to the woman, but she was faster, she reacted immediately and kicked him in the nuts.
''Well, I'm suprised you guys have managed to get this far. But what exactly.. Is your plan? You thought I was just going to leave. Dissapear and leave Dean's mind clean and tidy with a bow around it? I'm sorry, but this time.. I won't let go that easy.''
Sam didn't waste more time they didn't have and pulled the hook going through Castiel's right wing out as fast as he could.
‘’Go stand guard. God is dramatic, he will come through the front door if he’s in a good mood. And he visited the Winchesters. So he will be.’’
''I don't know if you've noticed. But me and Sam don't agree to the whole dying thing. And you need a yes from Dean once again. As he has expelled you and closed the door.''
or so to speak your only option besides Castiel suffering for eternity stuck between heaven and hell or resting in peace, is that when he comes back to your world, he can never come back to mine.’’
Castiel nodded, he wasn’t a big beer drinker but it was always good to start with, while saving the heavy hitters for later.
‘’Yes, I made some before I fell asleep, and even if I didn't where would we get coffee right now? Once again, It’s literally 3am.’’
‘’Birdy needs room for his feathers. It’s fine Sam. You can take that shower now, I can smell you from here.’’
He soon found what he was looking for. Luke, his best friend which he shared a room with, was currently talking to a girl, because- of course he was, he was showing her something on his phone and smiled a big toothy grin at her as soon as she looked up, making her burst out in laughter and elbow him in his side, he pretended to be hurt and put an arm around her shoulder when she rolled her eyes at him, eventually he noticed Castiel, excused himself to the girl and made his way over to him, Castiel felt slightly more relaxed knowing Luke wanted his company.
When Zachariah had told Castiel that he was going to make the angel (slowly becoming less angel) scream.. Castiel had a stubborn mindset.
But because Cas was Cas that was exactly what he did, he spread his wings out and folded them around Dean, so now they we're both sitting in a really dark, and warm cocoon of feathers.
‘’The only destructing we’ll be doing is on you.’’ Dean said, picking the scythe from where he’d hidden it under the map table.
On the floor of the frozen room was his friend, Cas was wearing some hideous walmart version of an angel and were those? His wings.. No. They we’re probably also fake. Cas had told them he’d lost them in the fall. But they looked so real? And was that bone..? Yeah okay, maybe not-fake then. What the hell?
‘’Long story short, Dean decided to wake you up while Chuck was still draining you...’’ Gabriel glared at Dean.
Praying was so hard. Normally you waited for a response, but now you couldn’t see how the other person was feeling, and although it was already hard to tell with Cas, Dean was scared he was going to say the wrong things.
‘’Well I was gonna ask your name, but if you’re cool with being called friend of Meg then that’s also fine with me, you look like you have a better name than that though.’’
‘’Well, with all the other celestial or human beings, It does seem to work that way.. you.. not so much.’’
Dean tried to kick the door in, and when that didn’t work he tried shooting it, and when that didn’t work he stepped aside so his giant brother could try kicking it in, which again had no effect.
‘’Better, I think the bullethole healed completely. My wings are still uncomfortable and painful, but much better than yesterday.’’
It felt unpleasent in his mouth, the towel was probably really old and the fabric washed many times which made it anything but soft.
But it wasn't the worst reaction, seeming Castiel had just met this guy and yet Dean was hinting that they
So Dean took it on himself to have touched every feather there was on Castiels wings, he seemed to have reached a weak spot when Castiel trew his head back and actually moaned.
He hoped he wasn’t, but of course the one time he wanted to be wrong, his gut had told him it was his deceiving father, and he’d been right.
‘’Get you and your brother in that room or I will kill Castiel. And believe me I can, I’ve had enough time to train on other angels.’’
Castiel couldn't heal because of the cuffs keeping his grace stored away. But he was still too much Angel to bleed to death.
‘’God visited us a few times, he told us some of the things he was doing to you, but it’s better to hear them again from you.’’
She raised the whip above her head and Castiel had to bite his lip not to scream out as it landed on his right wing.
''Gabe told me he’s been having a hard time at home, and school,  I think he might not be talking about anything anymore to anyone in that house, we were close as well.’’
Didn’t even look up from his homework. He still had had a deadline tonight and couldn’t afford to be distracted right now.
And yes, he wouldn't think twice about sacrificing himself for Dean, or Sam and in this situation Jack.
‘’Nah, I still have some leftover rice. But bring some for Gabriel, I’m sure he would appreciate that.’’
Sam, Dean and Castiel decided that it was best to wait until all the monsters scattered far away from the building into the night. Then they would come back and burn the building.
Castiel hoped the world didn't end for at least another 20 years, because he finally had what he wanted. His little broken family.
I now it's still fast between updates but I've been thinking about a good ending since I started writing this.
‘’The most surprising thing about all this, might be your coming out scene Cas. Not a big fan of the ‘’gays have to die in a tragic way and never get what they want’’ trope but at least it was romantic and dramatic, I love me some sacrificing for the people you love. but I think Sam and Dean know all about that.’’
''So, what does little Jack think about all this? You made a mistake young boy, you could've been in heaven. With your mummy.''
''Jack... I don't regret what I did, I will do it all again in a second without hesitation. But the empty.. it will only come to collect me when I'm truly happy.. And I know it's sounds quiet sad when put into words, but I've never had time to really find happiness in my long life. Before the Winchesters there only always was the mission. Nothing came before duty. And yes, meeting Dean, Sam and Bobby.. I'm forever grateful for that, and they have brought me some of my happiest moments on earth. But even being in a relationship with Dean won't mean that I will be happy... Because some part of me will never allow me to.''
‘’Got ya.’’ Dean stood up, he payed for the pancakes and tipped the waitress (not because he wanted to flirt, but because she’d been really nice when she’d seen Cas and Dean walk in holding hands
his eyes opened, then they glowed, first a bright yellow, then a fiery red, a light blue, and lastly a dark purple.
‘’How much did he drink?’’ She said as she turned to Luke, apparently not trusting Castiel enough to answer her question honestly.
‘’This is the final chapter Dean, this final showdown. Please keep your witty rewards for the bloopers and let’s face this with some dignity.’’
Castiel had been trying to avoid this topic for a while now, he just wanted to bathe in the presence of Dean’s happiness, Dean’s contentedness, for a little while longer.
‘’But I think I know, I think I know, now. Happiness isn’t in the having, it’s in just being, it’s in just saying it.’’
Castiel hurried over to the tray once again grabbed the keys off it and hurried over to open the door that stood between him and his family.
But all in all, Dean was witty, quick with a comeback and had Castiel laughing until his stomach hurt and tears were starting to form in his eyes.
''I think he always was Dean. He was just scared, which I get. His family was even more messed up than ours.'' Sam said.
‘’Well, not your friend yet Castiel, but I hope we can change that.’’ Dean wiggled his eyebrows, making Cas laugh even though
A normal person would have probably freaked out right about now but Dean was used to seeing this kinda shit, courtesy of dealing with a shifter every other week and another end of the world the week after that.
Castiel was not going to admit that the pancakes didn’t taste like monocles, because they shouldn’t.
Castiel thought it was best to follow that order and the three ate breakfast in bed, well.. Dean and Cas enjoyed breakfast in bed. Sam was sitting on the chair and shooting them looks every 3 seconds.
‘’And he’s Cas! You remember him? The guy has always been there for us, and she hasn’t. Yes, I loved her too. And yes of course her death hurts. But Cas is family too.’’
He went to the kitchen to get some coffee in a comfortable bathrobe Dean had offered him. Dean himself was also wearing one.
He’d known for a long time that there was more than friendship building between the two, but the process of it was so slow that Sam wondered how many more he could take before he’d have to step in.
‘’Why won’t you? You’re supposed to be his big saviour. He though you wouldn’t come, you know? Thought it was better anyways. Stupid angel wanted to protect you, always putting himself in front of the Winchesters, bet you find it handy, having a personal attack dog.’’
And when he got the silver whip out... Dean felt tears slowly tracing down his face, as he also saw them fell down Castiel’s face.
‘’You wanna do family talk…? Already? I think we might need more alcohol for that first.’’ Dean laughed.
Most students try and make their dorm feel at home as fast as possible, because homesickness is a thing that a lot of them go through in the first weeks.
‘’He talked to me a lot, never really wanted to hurt me bad. But he could switch between moods really fast, sometimes that was unexpected. But mostly he got angry because I told him things he didn’t want to hear. Or didn’t do the things he wanted me to do.
''You guys found me- Michael came.. He had his little scary villain talk and.. I banished him? Right?''
I caused a lot of suffering on earth. But I devastated heaven.. I vaporised thousands of my own kind.. And I- Du.. I d.. I can’t go back.’’
''The empty told me it wanted to see me suffer, to go back to my normal life. To forget about what happened, and when I will allow myself to be happy, it will come to take me.''
‘’Was about time both of you figure that out.’’ Sam sighed, he joined the rest of them who were now all sitting on Cas’s bed, it was a bit cramped with 3 of them being grown, and higher than your average guy, but they made it work by giving each other no personal space whatsoever.
‘’Fine. We’ll set them free, Doesn’t mean I’m happy about it, and I think it’s gonna be a hell of a mess to clean in the future, but.. yeah, nobody deserves that.’’
''Don't use such language, it will not help your angel. Now, something that will help Castiel is one simple word. Meet me and face your destiny Dean. Or I will torture Castiel for all of eternity and he will wish he was dead.''
''I have to admit, I though you wouldn't break that easily. You seemed stronger than that. But now I know were your boundaries are, the things that are to come are going to be so much more enjoyable.''
‘’Luke, shut the fuck up. Cas, relax, just go up to him, tell him you like his- whatever the fuck you’ve been staring at for the past
‘’Don’t like the weather there.’’ She said and then the doors closed, leaving Castiel alone with his thoughts in the dark as the engine started.
''Yeah.. I guess my wings are almost the same as those of a normal bird. They're just bigger and contain a large part of my grace and being.''
Castiel had told Sam that he was able to travel into Dean's mind without them, also giving them an easy way out if things got too risky.
Castiel could feel the blade in his back, and with his grace bound he didn’t risk to play games, so he walked.
‘’Seemed your gut was telling you the right thing Dean, I think Cas in trouble. He would never leave willingly without his blade.’’
Dean did so immediately. He went to stand next to Sam and his brother squeezed his shoulder briefly as he gave him an understanding look.
Castiel will never forget the feeling of flying, it relaxed him, helped him remember who he was and what he stood for.
After a big white flash, and Chuck’s last angry scream he was gone entirely. slowly vanishing in the air he once created.
‘’I don’t think I’ve ever danced like this either.’’ Dean laughed. ‘’It’s good though, you’re good.’’
Another Dean was walking off the stairs, well- somebody who was wearing Dean was walking off the stairs.
He opened his eyes and stared right into Cas's, not saying a word until Sam got back with the chains.
Cas was to go first, because Michael would obviously notice his precense, and hell. It was not like he had anything to loose. Not with the empty still freshly hidden in the back of his mind.
The taste and smell of greacy junkfood which always lingered in the bunker, even if there was no junkfood in sight at all.
He opened his eyes and felt them fill with his familiar grace, making it so that he could read the different connections to heaven,
‘’Listen very carefully Dean, Castiel died fulfilling my deal, and I’m very …precise about my deals. I do not do take backs, but, not only did he die knowing what was coming, he died saving
‘’How do… you know me?’’ Castiel grunted, he could still move his lips, but it took a lot of effort to talk.
Castiel felt strange when they got back, like he was being summoned by something in the back of his mind.
But his relief turned into worry because Louise was dangerous, Sam and Dean couldn’t possibly know what they were walking into.
''Michael was right. I made an deal with the empty. But I didn't have a choose, it was gonna take Jack, and I couldn't let that happen. So I told it to take me instead.''
‘’No. I’m done playing some role in your story. Stick those empty promises up in your ass where they came from.’’
''That I will need something to bite down on.'' Cas said with a tired smile, the pain was really getting to him now and he just wanted to rest.
‘’Why would I do that you ask? Because my ending involves one of the Winchester brothers killing the other. Dead. No coming backs. Not while I’m around which is.. forever. So. You guys have 2 weeks. 2 weeks before I will do worse with Cas than him becoming human. Fight it out, see you soon.’’
It didn’t matter now, all that matters is that Dean figured out where Chuck would take Cas to make him suffer the most.
He'd never seen it from this angle, nor did he remember walking into that lake. He was glad angels didn't dream, because he would have nightmares about it, he still sees it as the biggest mistakes in his entire live, the entire wall were screens displaying
‘’I'm going to ignore that, because you never care about your own well being so I'm allowed to, and ask; do you remember what happened while you were
''It's fine Dean.. It's just a kind off an intimate gesture... it's a bit overwhelming to say the least.''
Cas had mentioned once that the Empty had its ways of getting into your head, probably where the self destructing part and the creepy smile Dean never wanted to see on his own face ever again came from.
Castiel had to act now, if she shot him he didn’t know if he had the energy or strength to get back up.
Dean made a small cut and let a few drops of his blood fall down in the bowl, when the myrrh began to glow he took Cas’s angelblade ad placed it in the bowl, he then looked at the laptop standing next to the bowl and did his best to pronounce the incantation as best as he could.
He knew where her collection was, he just hoped that she hadn’t left and headed for the bunker already.
Whatever this deal was, he felt how distressed it made Dean when Chuck mentioned it, and how it did the same thing again right now.
It wasn’t actually as bad as Cas thought it was, he had just found the song a bit too corny, a bit too slow for something like a party.
*This is a fix it, I am up to date with supernatural but after 15x03 won't be following the original storyline since I DO NOT AGREE WITH IT :)
‘’It’s not me that did this. I don’t break promises. But apparently Zachariah does, and he will pay for this. So will Uriel, but this is not why I’m here… no, it’s the next part that really amuses me.’’
‘’You really think that they won’t be ready? They will kill you. So if I were you, I’d make the smart choice. Let me go, find another path and don’t come near me and the Winchesters ever again.’’
''Are you crazy?! I think they're amazing. They're the most badass things I've ever seen and when you have them out like this it's like you're.. more you. If that makes any sense.'' Dean caught himself blushing like a three year old but he couldn't find it in him to care.
Sam was next to Dean and supporting his arm within 6 seconds. (Dean almost crashed to the ground in those seconds)
‘’Right. Well, I was stubborn at first, thought I could escape. But he.. tortured me. That wasn’t the hard part but he kept telling me these things… ‘’
He’d heard about it from another angel, not in person no-.. the celestial beings he once called his family all hated him now. But that was okay, Castiel had let that go a long time ago.
And Castiel stood up, walked to the door and got into his car. The pain as gone as fast as it had came, he felt kind of.. numb now.
He didn’t see Dean as his brother, he would die for him. (he already had several times) He would give Dean everything he had to give and more. He became dangerously drunk on his feelings sometimes, he loved the human. In his long live Castiel had never thought he would be able to really love someone… but here he was pulling his heart out for a men.
Dean knew Sam was right, but that didn’t stop the feeling in his gut telling him something was wrong.
''That's not true, think you're a great role model. You're really good with people, and if Sam is so smart, you helped him get this far, without your support and
A tv screen appeared out of nowhere and showed what happened to Cas, from him getting knocked out til Zachariah and Uriel guarding him.
Maybe he would make the choise to become human and live his life out with Dean so the Empty couldn't take him.
‘’Nah, I’m good Sammy. And I won’t be able to sleep until we find the idiot and I whooped his ass for ditching us like that.’’
all came to crush him at once, but they were all good new sensations, even if they felt suffocating.
But Dean had never completely forgotten about it, he had always thought he would ask Cas about it again someday. He never did though, the subject was too sensitive.. and their relationship was already so complicated.
''So what, he just let me have a little chit-chat with you? He handed me the controler like that?'' Dean snapped his finger.
‘’Me. I changed. When Cas finally snapped, when even he thought we couldn’t keep doing this.. I saw what I had done. I’ve been so damn selfish. I didn’t think he felt the same way and when he told me how he felt…’’
The angel was so freaking strong, even when he was getting more human with each minute passing, he was still so strong.
Which Dean always found kinda strange because emotions and fluffy duffy feelings are Sam’s specialty.
It had been Castiel’s Job since he came on earth, ordered by heaven and probably being the only order he had always been willing to carry out till the end.
''Well, somebody had to. I know for a fact you weren't planning on doing it. But Castiel, it's not like it matters. You are gonna die tonight anyways, and I'll make sure you are last. First I'll kill Jack, slowly, and painfully. Then Sam, owh and believe me... I'm gonna get creative with Sam. And then I'll break all the bones in your body, making sure Deans feels every snap of it, and cut off your already broken wings.''
Castiel just rolled his eyes and turned his back to Sam and Dean so they could reach the bullethole.
Everyone wanted to use those talents, to gain a great fighter, to gain a great spy, create a good teacher-
Dean had to drive careful, every time the car drove over a speed bump there was a pained sound to be heard from the backseat, which made Dean wish they could drive back to the bunker faster.
Sam looked up from his laptop, he was sitting at the kitchentable and his eyebrow shot up as he seemed to connect the dots.
Until they were interrupted by the sound off an alarm, and not many seconds later Sam who was running out off the building to the impala.
Castiel doubted that Luke wouldn't tell Meg, but right now he couldn't care less, it's not like she doesn't know that he left the party with Dean.
Dean brought his hand up to Castiel’s face and slightly brushed his chin with his fingertips. ‘’I like you Castiel.’’
''By killing every human but leaving this world to every monster there is? My loyalty belongs to the humans. With all their flaws. Now, is this all you want? Because I have a feeling you were prepared for this answer.''
‘’Well, it would’ve been easy for him to just buy the fakes, but maybe his wife had personal attachments to these jewels, or they may have been decorated
‘’Because it’s poetic. You became human here for the first time, and you will become human here for the last time. Uriel, Zachariah, guard him. Do not
‘’I remembered Castiel once using a tracking spell to find Balthazar, I just didn’t remember how he did it, so I searched for it on the internet and get this; we only need myrrh, human blood and holy water and do we have anything from Castiel?’’
''We'll take it slow.'' Dean got closer, Castiel caught his staring at his lips, but he didn't mind. It was no secret anymore, they could stop pretending that they didn't do that.
‘’Well, I was hunting for your boyfriend first.. But I can’t say no to an Angel like you Cassie. You always seemed fascinating to me. And I was planning on getting you soon anyways!’’
Dean never got to finish that sentence, because Castiel had stepped closer and was currently putting his hand on Dean’s cheek.
Maybe as a fledgling? But that couldn't have been long, heaven had gone rotten soon after he was born.
‘’It’s not this chair in particular, we have a lot of them in heaven and when Angels like Cas sit down in one of them, they all mean the same thing. Pain is coming. It was a great way to make him question where he was, because I think at this point every angel born after me suffers from flashbacks with that damn chair in it. ’’
''Look I'm happy you guys finally stopped being blind idiots in denial, but you're going to have to clean those sheets yourself.''
‘’Well… These are looking rather rough aren’t they Cassie? Who clipped your wings? Ouch- Sorry I forgot, that was your own fault.’’
‘’ I will be reminding Castiel that he choose the wrong team. Knock on the door twice and I will heal him like nothing happened.’’
Point is, he liked how his dorm looked, it felt like him. He didn’t have that at home, so in a way, the little space he’d gotten from Redwood felt more like a home than his real one.
''Yeah, he got lucky! You've got to be more careful Jack, you're human now. And Michael could've killed you in a blink.''
Castiel walked over to Dean, he put his hand against Dean's forehead, letting his grace sowly flood to his fingertips and enter Dean's mind again.
Castiel knew what Dean meant, he wanted to talk in private. Not within the presence of the younger Winchester.
After looking at Dean and Sam for a second the woman decided they looked sane enough and answered that she had checked Castiel in in room 5B.
‘’Poor angel…’’ Chuck found it amusing calling him that, because at this point, he was more human than angel.
‘’Sometimes I thought that it was just because he’s an angel, and he didn’t know it was rude to stare or something, but later on I understood that you only look at someone like that, when…
Brothers and sisters, we may not always agree on most things. But I need every single one of you right now….’’
He wasn’t running on stolen grace, or falling. But he also wasn’t on full power and he had figured out a while back that he needed to sleep every now and then.
He screamed into an empty room where just a minute ago, h̶̶i̶̶s̶̶ ̶b̶̶e̶̶s̶̶t̶̶ ̶f̶̶r̶̶i̶̶e̶̶n̶̶d̶̶ Cas had been until his lungs burned.
Dean ran over to Cas, (leaving the blade in Chuck’s stomach) took him out of the chair carefully, and carried him over to the corner where Sam was standing bridal style.
‘’I know it’s stupid but, I guess, I was scared of not being accepted, or something, kinda my dad’s fault, some people don’t like it when they see two men kissing, at least the people my dad used to hang around, and with us hunting- we come across a lot of people like that, and I never realised that most people actually don’t care.’’
After that he warded the scythe with the warding Joshua had left in his head, it were symbols Castiel did not recognise.
He looked around to see if it had waken Luke up and when he heard slight snoring coming from his closed door, Cas stood up and walked to the door slowly, as he
When the empty had swallowed both Cas and Billie fully it disappeared just as quickly as it had come.
‘’The entire time I kept getting weaker because he was draining my grace, and from what Gabriel just said, apparently using it himself. It explains a lot, I could always feel him hunger for it…’’
‘’Sorry to interrupt this emotional moment but we're switching from the commercial break to the real deal.'’
I posted 8 after 6 and totally forgot 7, I figured it out (a little late) and posted 7 anyways, sorry if I confused anyone!
''I can't promise I won't let Michael in, but we're gonna put up a hell of a fight before it even comes to that point it's my last option. I won't go willingly.''
Chuck walked him over to the chair very slowly, because Cas was still very clearly hurting from his injuries, but eventually they made it,
Castiel’s eyes glowed blue for a second but his pained expression didn’t leave his face after, making Dean worried.
Dean didn’t like the idea of being locked up in the same building as this crazy maniac bitch, but he couldn’t let Cas die.
''If with official you mean in a relationship, I don't know. We haven't had time to really talk yet, but we're getting there.''
He hated whenever this happened, whenever nightmares plagues his nights and he would be left disoriented and distracted for the entire day, it was one of the worst feeling in the world and could make what could've been good days, start and end as bad ones.
''Dean oh Dean, like your brother informed you- I left the door open, just a bit. And I don't have to be invited to an already open door. We would've been wasting time. ''
‘’Then we’ll do it the hard way.’’ Chuck went to pick Castiel up, but before his hand got even close to Castiel’s shoulder, the angel had pulled himself into the corner of the room while yelling;
‘’Owh no, but you are. You’re mine. For now and forever, just like Dean will be. But for now I want to see the look on your face as I explain what I’m going to do to you and him. So let me break it down for you halo. First I’ll force out your wings.. or what’s left of them. Just so everybody knows what you really are; a bird trapped in a cage. Then I’m going to give you a new look and now the fun part, have you noticed the temperature around here?’’
The room was spinning and it began to grow hard for Castiel to focus on anything. His head was aching and words and language got mixed up in his head.
You need to ward the scythe, as far as I’m aware God doesn’t know you have it in possession yet, if he comes to close presence to it he will be able to feel it.’’
''Owh? So Sammy didn't know about your little deal? You didn't tell the Winchesters! Well, it's gonna be a pleasure seeing Dean's face after I break the news to him. He was so happy having a win with... not strings attached.''
That angel had tortured and brainwashed thousands of angels, but none of them had been treated as harsh and as much as Castiel.
Because I have wanted to own you both for so long, and because we’re the same Castiel, because I never told my one true love that I loved him before it was too late. And our story will end the same, you will never tell him and never reach him.. but you’ll always keep seeing him.’'
It gets worse before it get better..  A few more chapters and we've reached destination.. happy ending :)
‘’Grew up alongside 2 of them, kinda rubs off I guess, Sam wasn't around yet, but he's starting to get there. ''
The heels clacked across the room once again, Michael was doing something away from Castiel's view. 5 minutes later he came back with a tray of torture devices.
''Dean. Asmodeus had him for a long time, don't forget that. He took a big one for the team, and I really hope he isn't dead, that he managed to pull another trick on Lucifer.''
But he was too smart for his own good. He got in trouble a lot, got punished for it and became less energetic, less curious, he had no one who understood. Because no one was going through the same as Cas. He needed someone to talk to. So I did. I listened. And then I kinda took him under my wing. ’’ Gabriel huffed.
‘’Okay?’’ Dean was surprised, he thought this was gonna be another long discussion but Cas gave up too easy, didn’t seem to be as fine as he said he was.
But he was at a lost for words, he hated the way Cas seemed to know him down to his core, knew what he feared and who he was so well, It scared him to death.
They hurt, he couldn’t move them and he knew they needed a lot of work and care, but he himself couldn’t reach them and he wasn’t going to ask someone else to touch his wings.
Dean stared at the ground, then after a few more slow breaths he said; ’’It would only, it would only come, when- if, he found true happiness.’’
Enochian cuffs. Gabriel gave them to me, they are strong enough to contain Lucifer. So you, aren't going anywhere anytime soon.''
But something about Dean intrigued Cas, it pulled him in and made Cas look at the stranger like he was a puzzle waiting to be solved. It was new to Cas, because- it went deeper than some beautiful green eyes and a cute smile.
‘’Holy shit.’’ Dean dropped the scythe with a mix of shock and happiness, a small smile on his face but eyes big. ‘’I killed god.’’
‘’if angels don’t need sleep… You think I do?’’ Gabriel said without looking up from watching Castiel.
‘’Thanks, so it gave me this proposal, I could let you rot in the empty, or kill the empty and have you stuck glitching between heaven, hell, and everything in between,
Nothing happened for what seemed like way too long, and Dean was nervously counting the seconds in his head.
There were a few minutes of silence and then Dean announced he was going to take a shower and that they would search the town tomorrow.
‘’Sam, Cas has heaven and hell gunning for his head. I don’t he’s been taken by a vampire or some shit, a monster would have been children’s play for him. No- whatever took him, knew what he or she was doing.’’
I don’t know Enochian, so I used a translator with the few words Cas said, there is no Enochian way to say ‘’I don’t know’’ So I changed it to I Cannot say, and GROSB means hurt so the entire sentence ‘’GROSB, uhh… OL IPAMIS GOHO..’’  means: ‘’Hurt, uhh.. I cannot say’’
‘’That’s what they all say, but believe me sweetie, eventually all of you are the same; you all have a breaking point. And with your history, it may take a while before I find yours… but I will Cas. I will.’’
Sam had been suspecting that Dean would want to sacrifice himself, I mean if things came down to it, and they knew someone had to go.. Dean would always throw himself into the line of fire.
Louise yelled and aimed the gun at him but Castiel was faster and he grabbed an angelblade of the tray.
‘’He’ll get out of jail in a few months. Everyone knows and loves the story, and he’s way too much of a public figure to be in there for a long time, they’ll go easy on him.’’
‘’Cas, after we’ve burned that warehouse to the ground. You’re gonna talk to me. You’re going to tell me everything that happened with Louise and we will figure our shit out. I don’t care if you don’t want to talk about it because I do.’’
He still was in a lot of pain and had no clue why his healing process was this slow, he guessed it was of his wings being hurt too, but it didn't explain why his other injuries hadn't started to heal yet.
When Castiel asked a question Dean asked it back, and when Castiel told a story Dean would listen and ask questions. It seemed like Dean wanted to get to know Castiel just as much as Castiel wanted to get to know Dean.
He knew he should feel sorry for her, they didn’t kill humans. But nobody hurts Cas like that and walks aways, absolutely no fucking body.
Dean and Cas continued talking about nothing and everything until the sun started to go up, with their hands never leaving each other, that was until Cas remembered he had barely eaten anything yesterday because of that stupid assignment and his stomach was beginning to growl at him for it now.
Dean had secretly always wondered what it would be like to be the last person on earth, he thought it would be easier not having to put up with everyone’s bullshit.
The next few days allowed Castiel to really get some rest, he didn't sleep of course. But by not moving his body was relaxed and would heal faster.
‘’I know that you’re all friendly with Dean now, and I’m grateful for what you did for us, but I still don’t trust you Gabriel.’’
After drawing the sigil on the table Sam placed a bowl on top of it, he carefully placed three pieces of myrrh in the middle and brought a knife up to his hand when Dean stopped it.
‘’Ah yes.’’ The Empty coughed, and when it spoke again, this time it was Dean’s voice he was using. ‘’Still had the last one I talked to stuck in my throat.’’
‘’You won’t get away with this, I’m not going to become some piece of your collection and neither will Dean.’’
Castiel jumped at Meg yelling right next to his ear and accidentally spilled some of his beer on his shirt, he tried to rub some of it off with his hands, but when it stained he sighed and doomed it a lost cause.
‘’Well, Noami got the script from someone Cas. You are the famous spanner in the works. You don’t work.. right.’’
‘’Just drive to the place where we lost him, he was standing still for like an hour anyways so he probably decided to go to a motel or something.’’
I've been really busy and I think that updates will come with more time apart than at first, but the important thing is that I will continue this fic and also finish it some day.
God had a lot of patience with this particular angel, but he was getting fed up with this behaviour.
''Nobody is gonna die. Except for you Michael, and when we're done with you, you're gonna wish that Lucifer had killed you when he had the chance.''
After that he took the purgatory flower, ( that had been a bitch to get without his guardian angel, and also didn’t help that the place brought back
‘’Wonderful isn’t it, what that holy fire can’t do to you angels. You were completely frozen mere seconds ago and look at you now!’’
He'd waited so long for this, fantasized about this moment so many times, but nothing could actually compare to the feeling of Cas's extremely soft lips against his.
Normally he wouldn’t have to count, he would just knew how many had passed, but since the cuffs were making him basically human, he had to try to follow the right and lefts the van took, and count the seconds to know how long he was going to have to walk back to the motel if he managed to escape.
It had been a while since his father, and that particular scene had crept into his dreams and made them nightmares, and he had to admit this was really poor timing as well. His eyes shifted to the now cold coffee on his right and he almost automatically grabbed the cup and gulped the rest down.
‘’Your room is ready! I’m very sad that Dean hasn’t shown up yet. I think that after you’re done and set, I’m going to have to go out and hunt him after all.’’
and he doesn’t deserve you either you fucking psychopath! He certainly does not deserve what Zachariah did to him.
Chuck snapped his fingers and Castiel’s chains disappeared, the angel fell to the ground with a grunt.
‘’Dean got me back.’’ Castiel smiled at the young boy, slowly rubbing circles on the back of his head to calm him down a bit.
''Owh, I wouldn't be so sure about escaping.'' Castiel said, still haven't broken eye contact with Michael.
‘’The Empty said the deal was that something brought to life again by nothing, will live until everything is nothing.’’
‘’Dammit.’’ Dean slapped Sam’s shoulder in frustration, Sam didn’t let go, it also didn’t hurt because Dean didn’t have any energy left, and because Dean would never hurt him on purpose.
Castiel watched with wide eyes as Michael carefully took a can of holy oil and poured it over what looked like an whip, Michael hummed as he lit the end of it on fire with a snap of his finger.
Dean was talking to what seemed to be a friend of his, but as soon as Cas approached Dean locked eyes with him, forgetting all about whatever conversation he seemed to be having, and his friend went to find someone else to talk to, not seeming too bothered by it.
She made him stop right before a room, the door was made of glass and there were big windows so you could see almost everything in the room. The glass itself was frozen, and Castiel could feel the cold from where he stood, he calculated his chances and if she kept the handcuffs on him he would be completely frozen within 2 hours, but the cold could never kill him.
‘’Prayers don’t get through into the Empty, and even if they did, I wouldn’t be conscious enough to hear them.’’
‘’Chuck’s energy is in him. It’s sucking out his grace slowly before what I assume retreating and leaving him human…But the process..it’s excruciating. ’’
‘’You don’t know what dignity is, you have controlled them their entire lives, and I suggest you stop talking now so you can go down with your last bit of dignity.’’ Castiel bit back.
She closed the door on the room Sam and Dean where in and put Cas back in his old one before walking away.
‘’Oh! My beloved rebel son! Back so soon? How was your little trip to the empty? Heard the weather there is.. well nothing really.’’
But point is, I never had anyone to protect me, until you started to watch over me, and although I acted like a child about it, and like it wasn’t appreciated, for the first time in my life, I knew what it felt like to feel safe, to be able to go to sleep without being scared to wake up covered in blood, or be scared to not wake up at all, I felt how nice it was to be, to just be.’’
''My head, my rules.'' Dean slammed his hand into an sigil and Michael screamed as he was banished from Dean in a blaze of light.
The angel didn’t leave marks, he had no belongings to forget and even if he had he would be careful enough to make sure he took everything with him.
And although he felt good about the way he handled things because for once in a very long time he’d stood his ground.. he wanted Dean to call him back, to apologise and talk it out over a beer.
‘’Hey! I’m sorry I never got the chance to experiment, it’s not like I had such a warm and accepting household- you know it, it never meant I didn’t want to do this, I just had this little voice saying I couldn’t.’’
‘’Cas? Hey! You with us buddy?’’ Dean grabbed Cas’s shoulder and green eyes met clouded ocean blue onces.
‘’Well, I’m goddamn supposed to protect you. We protect each other. That’s how this works okay? Tell me everything Cas, so I can do better at my job.’
‘’Nice try Cassie, but I finally have you exactly where I want you. So you’re not going to slip through my fingers that easily.’'
It left firery, and painful marks along Castiel’s wings which reminded him of hellfire, but he may actually prefer hell over this.
They weren’t even needed as much anymore, Jody and her girls could handle most hunts, and sometimes Jack would tag along with them, like he was doing tonight.
''I'm not at full power, but my ''mojo'' is the strongest it's been in a long time. I haven't stopped bleeding because these wounds are made by an angelblade, they are meant to cause me a lot of harm. Which they did.''
‘’Sam found a button that’s gonna open all the cages and run, told me to go because ‘’He had bigger feet and is ‘’faster’’.’’
Chuck arrived in style, thunder was heard as he walked down the stairs of the bunker and lightbulb were flashing.
‘’I’m not. I will give him all his grace back. He can live as an angel again. I’ll restore heaven as my final act. Dean listen to me… ’’ Chuck walked over too Dean. They stood face to face.
‘’Cas!’’ Dean dropped whatever he’d been holding and swinged his arms around Castiel, who was still sitting on the ground with a feeling comparable with jetlag.
Sam was holding the emergency kit and a few towels and Jack was focused on not dropping the bowl of warm water he was holding between his hands tightly.
Castiel was smiling at the conversation, he was happy it was not problem to Sam, he always known Sam suspected something.. maybe Sam knew before Castiel himself knew. But still, he and Dean we're Sam's brothers.
Louise walked over to the tray again and Castiel slowly raised his head, he hadn’t looked at Dean since the whipping started, he hated the fact that Dean had seen him this low, this broken… this useless.
Sam walked around Cas and Dean to reach the other wings, he himself also took a deep breath and pulled the other hook out.
''...and you are going to scream, So they will run right into my hands. And I will posses Dean and kill both you and Sam.''
Castiel tried to hold back the sound of his real form screaming as another bloody hole appeared in his right wing.
And don't be afraid to ask questions! I will answer but won't spoil the plot because I too have no idea where this is going next.
Dean dropped the gun as he fell to his knees and Louise reached for it, aimed it at Sam and shot him in the leg.
‘’Sam texted me.’’ He said before laying down again next to Cas, who pulled him closer with his wing.
So he had one shot and he took it, Dean reached for the scythe and stabbed it trough God’s back before the omnipotent being could even register Dean was now standing behind him.
He also liked the way he scrunched his nose when he needed to think, the small freckles on his face that only appeared when hit with the shitty lighting that came from Dean’s slightly flickering lamp, his voice and Dean’s stories that seemed to have matching themes with Castiel’s adventures, and Castiel couldn’t get over how easy it was to loose himself in Dean’s eyes, Cas was sure he loved Dean’s eyes,
‘’You can join me? It’s big enough.’’ Castiel didn’t say he wanted Dean next to him, that he still felt cold, like he could be back there, at any minute. He needed Dean next to him to remind him he was save.
‘’Don’t. Interrupt. Me. Okay? I’m your father. You will listen to me. Or I will cut your tongue out of your mouth and we will see how free you can be without words.’’
Dean and Sam were now busy loading their guns with melted down angel blades and Jack went through the battle tactics he had learned from all of them one last time with his own angel blade.
‘’Dean, we have to stop by a hotel or something, he’s bleeding too much. There’s no time to drive the whole way back to the bunker.’’
Dean seemed even more shocked, he covered his mouth with his hand and looked at the damage as if he didn't know where to start.
Dean turned around and what he assumed was Louise came into view from were she’d been hiding behind the corner.
Deep down Dean knew what Cas was talking about, but he couldn’t he, just couldn’t if Cas was planning on… no, not now. He couldn’t loose Cas again.
‘’You can keep me in here for centuries, but Dean will be dead in under an hour. And you want him alive right? Don’t freeze him, please.’’
son die, he will be alone, in a world that will be gone or has no place for him, in a universe that has always worked against him with no one else besides him.’’
‘’I think you got some minding your own business to do.’’ Dean whispered in Chuck’s ear as he choked on his own blood.
Dean’s music wasn’t there to brighten up the mood, or Sam’s light snoring that somehow seemed relaxing to the angel, as he could focus on it instead of his complicated thoughts.
Castiel’s space was filled with photo’s of his friends, posters of some of the bands he liked, lots of plants he’d memorised the original names from and took good care of, art he created, and random trinkets he’d found or Luke got for him, Meg would get him things too- although she mostly saved his presents for holidays and his birthday, and of course every time they got him something, Cas would return the favour, even though he never had that much money, having saved up and paying for College all on his own.
''We're not done yet, we still have to stitch them. But we can take a break, let's clean you up a bit before we move on. How's the pain?''
‘’So get this..’’ Sam began after they had finished eating and both Cas and Dean were cleaned up and wearing normal clothes.
and he’d fallen they had been damaged, since he got his grace back he still hadn’t dared to look at them.
He found himself tied up against a pole, there were ropes against his stomach, and his hands were cuffed with enochian cuffs, hands tied above his head. The cuffs were making his grace unusable, he could feel it stored away deep inside him, fighting to get free. His feet we're also tied to the pole, he couldn't move. Escaping was going to be really hard, especially if his captor was planning on hurting him.
His feet easily followed Deans, he felt light and safe, slightly tipsy and giggly from the butterflies in his stomach, but safe, in Dean’s hand.
''Watch me do it, tonight. I will escape tonight. So tonight... everybody dies. Except for me of course.''
‘’Hey! I never got breakfast in bed before, you’ve had enough chances when you were sick and I took care of you ’n shit. Hand me the syrup.’’
do is release everything in the Empty including your handsome angel, but they can’t go to heaven, nor hell, and of course not wander the earth as ghosts, so they’d all be stuck glitching from one place to another, in complete and utter never ending misery being banished from all places dead things go over and over and over again.’’
Cas has been sleeping with an arm over Dean- and okay let’s be honest here, they may have fallen asleep spooning.
‘’You sick motherfucker.’’ Dean said with clenched teeth. He was barely holding it together, but he knew that if he tried anything, god would just snap his fingers and he wouldn’t be able to do anything.
He threw the angelblade and it landed in her throat, she fell to the ground hands reaching for the blade, but already bleeding too much to be able to survive the hit.
Again a bright white light was ripped away from chuck, it you looked closer, it was a little bit slower, and lasted a little bit longer than than the ones before it.
‘’I mean it Gabe. It- it’s not men. I mean yes, once or twice… But not like him. It’s just.. It’s Cas. It’s him.’’
Gabriel placed a glowing hand on Castiel’s forehead, and after struggling a little more, Castiel relaxed and his eyes closed slowly.
‘’Goodluck with that essay, and if you wanna text, call or whatever, I left my number on the back of that receipt in your ass pocket!’’ Dean shouted before entering his dorm at the end of the hallway.
But let’s just say they hadn’t made any progress on breaking into heaven and they were running out of time so he needed the distraction.
Sam and Dean stood up from the booth but when the door opened two inches, it flew right back to being closed.
Castiel pulled his right wing (which had escaped more damage than his left) close to his body, so Dean could lay down next to him.
Those smells and tastes we're his home. Not the blood left in his mouth from a battle, heaven didn't feel right to be called home anymore.
''Than why this? Why go through all this trouble of torturing me and teaching me a ''lesson'' When I'm going to die anyways?''
‘’Then I think it’s time to deal with my dad and fight over who get’s custody of my baby brother, I’m rooting for me.’’
Then Cas felt something, it wasn’t his grace, no, his grace couldn’t heal this kind of wound made by an angelblade, not even with the sigils.
He screamed and screamed as Michael brought the scourge down again and again, never stopping and never wavering.
I hoped you enjoyed this first chapter, don't hesitate to leave a comment or some kudos, or both if you're feeling generous :)
Castiel cringed at the nickname. He always hated it when somebody else besides Sam and Dean used it.
Hiya!  Woaaah 2 chapters in a week? It’s like I suddenly came up with where I wanted to go in the middle of the night…
The waitress that took their orders was staring off into the distance in front of the checkout, the couple in front of her completely frozen too. And some people had food halfway on it’s way to their mouth.
Because they figured out very quickly that Chuck had left nobody on the planet except for his final draft.
''Gabriel gave it to me before he died, he said I could use it on Lucifer if it came to a point where it was needed.''
‘’I- ‘’ Dean carefully placed a hand before Cas’s mouth and sighed from relief when hot air was blew onto it.
‘’Cas, I don’t know if u can hear me. probably not, but I need you to know that, that, from the start I always had to protect Sam ya’ know. I had to, and I wanted to, of course, but I guess somewhere along the way I wanted to protect everyone else too, which is impossible because, well, we’ve met god, and he’s one angry little asshole.
‘’Sam! Dean!’’ He shouted. Dean was busy holding a piece of fabric against Sam’s leg.. was he wounded? At least it’s better than the alternative, maybe Louise had decided to keep the younger Winchester alive? Castiel could only hope.
‘’Angels don’t have genders, so I never really got the stigma around homosexuality, but I find it weird that it bothers people when it has nothing to do with them. They are not being affected by it in any way, so why do they care so much?’’
Kissing Dean was overwhelming but in the best way possible, it felt like thousands sensations Castiel hadn’t felt before so severe but had somehow experienced before
Sam helped Castiel sit straight in bed, and started to clean the wounds with the towel dipped in warm water.
Cas put his hand on Dean’s shoulder, just like he’d done so many times before in a moment of comfort. Just like he had did when he pulled him out of hell.
Cas let his head fall against the three they were sitting against, it was at the back of an abandoned park out of sight and out of campus,
Nobody answered that question, because if you are a Winchester the answer was always the same: A lot.
''How? I didn't say yes.. Well that one time, but you left, I should've received an invatation before you decided to ride my body again.''
There were so many thoughts racing through Dean’s head, so many question that he couldn’t grip onto one, so he just stared with an open mouth as Cas’ eyes began to tear up.
