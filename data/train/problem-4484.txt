“About as cranky as he’s been the last few days, but asleep for now,” Kevin says, setting his bottle down with a quiet thud. “How’s the research going?”
“I made a deal,” Cas admits, the words falling heavily in the space between them. “To save Jack the first time he died.”
“I am not adorable,” he tells Sam sternly, as if Sam might be mentally agreeing with Dean’s ‘joke’. Sam is perfectly aware that his best friend’s a former badass angel of the Lord, and is still reasonably a badass even if he’s no longer got angel mojo powering him. Sam is also honest with himself enough to acknowledge that said best friend
It doesn’t take long before Cas finally pulls away enough of the wrapper to get a look at what’s inside. Surprise flits across his face before he looks up at Sam. “You didn’t.”
Cas stares at the direction Dean’s taken off in with a frown. Sam tenses up nervously, figuring the jig's finally up.
“That’s a conversation for another time,” Dean says decisively. And that time will be never, as long as Dean has any say about it. Give Cas an inch and he’s liable to take a mile on his ‘learning about humanity’ questions, seemingly always directed to him instead of Sam. At this rate, the next thing Dean's going to be asked is for tips on how to jack off just because Cas is curious. And that is definitely
Cas is even expecting him to, and he could pretend he didn’t admit to something he never really planned to admit to anyone. Life would go on. But then he remembers the little trinkets Cas gave him in return as well, the ones he hid carefully at the very back of his cupboard, away from prying eyes.
Dean’s lips purse, slanting into a frown, before relenting with a sigh. “Fine, whatever.” He waves a hand behind him. “Coffee maker’s over there, mugs are on the shelf under the island.”
, Castiel thinks aggressively, kicking him in the shin. He remains undeterred, grin still in place while kicking Castiel right back.
While he’s wandering around, Dean finds a bright blue stone. It’s a really pretty blue, like Cas’ eyes. He rubs off the mud onto his shirt, shoving it into his pocket. He looks around, searching for Cas, and finds him squatting down near a tree.
“Is that why you’ve been keeping me so busy lately?” Cas interrupts, voice low. “Because he asked you to?”
“We've been looking after them for almost four months now; I think we can manage for a few more days.”
He rubs a hand over his jaw, giving Cas a sad lopsided smile. “You kept coming back to us though. Kept fighting for us, kept watching our backs.” He pauses. “We never really thanked you for that.”
Cas frowns down at his hands where he’s fidgeting with them absentmindedly. “He was frustrated afterwards,” he says, more to himself than to Sam, “I suppose he hadn’t managed the joke the way he intended.”
play outside again. They weren’t allowed to play outside when it was raining, which was lame because it was just water. Sammy’d even got wet in the rain before and he was fine, so it was stupid that
to sleep before, so they’d never gotten around to setting up a room for him. Far as Sam knew, Cas normally staked himself out at a corner of the library in a large chair he’d claimed as his own. If he wanted to be alone, he’d hole himself up in the half-made lounge room Dean had been trying to set up. All it had at the moment was a couch and a low coffee table Dean had managed to scrounge up from somewhere, which was just fine for sort-of-angel Cas, but definitely not for little (apparently human) kid Cas who’s knuckling at his eyes sleepily as he trailed down the hall after them.
“Wasn’t talking to you,” the twink says dismissively. “C’mon, ditch this buzzkill and have a little fun with me.”
As Dean and Sam move to leave the shop, Castiel watches Dean bring his coffee up for a quick sip, slowing halfway through the gesture as he catches sight of the dark scrawl of text on the otherwise unmarked cup and freezes halfway out the door. Sam turns to question Dean, only to be ignored in favor of returning to the counter. Castiel watches all this in mild terror, heart racing, mind having blanked out as soon as Dean had noticed his hastily scribbled message across the side of the cup.
“I didn't realize you were planning on taking a shower too,” Kevin says, smirking. “You look like a drowned moose.”
Dean didn’t think much about it at first; Cas likes Dean more than he likes pretty much anyone else aside from Sam, and he’s never been all that subtle about it. But actually having him around all the time started to put his actions into a different light. Like he was trying to make up for something he’d lost, and it didn’t take a genius to guess what that was.
Castiel’s brows furrow in confusion, pulling his trenchcoat on as he heads for the door. He notices the waitress giving him a parting smile and wave, and awkwardly returns the gesture.
It’s almost uncomfortably quiet the closer he gets to the kitchen. Either they’d gotten over the shouting stage or were talking like normal adults. Or, just as likely, sending loaded looks at each other instead of talking while Dean continues to stress cook his nerves away and pretend everything is fine. At the rate he’s been going, they’d have enough food to last them the rest of the month easily.
Dean had had days to seethe in his anger back then, likely building up since before whatever went down in the crypt. Sam still doesn’t know the details. He can’t imagine that they’d actually talked it out while Sam had been practically comatose during the earlier stages of his recovery; knowing his brother, he’d likely cheaply wallpapered over it and hoped it stuck.
“Uh, nothing.” Sam’s lips purse in an amused smile. “You don’t actually have to do it, it’s just a good luck superstition thing.”
Fine, alright. Apparently there was no ignoring it because his own damn car radio was against him too.
“I’m… aware that I’ve not been the best of friends to you, or much of one really. I realize I’ve been preoccupied with adjusting to being human, but I had hoped that you would talk to me if something were troubling you.”
Their first stop is at the Children’s Museum of Central Nebraska in Hastings. Before they’d set out, Sam had taken it upon himself to do a little research into fun places he could take the kids and ended up finding the children’s museum online. He’s pleased with his decision when he sees the glee on the kids’ faces when he sets them loose in the builder’s zone.
One of the patrons suddenly laughs loudly, momentarily diverting Dean’s attention. Gabriel uses the opportunity to give him a pointed look while Dean is distracted. He gets the feeling that Gabriel is trying to telepathically tell him to
Kevin’s no less baffled than he was a few minutes ago, he’s not sure if the coffee will make things make more or less sense at this point. There’s always the possibility that Dean’s been possessed by the spirit of Martha Stewart. Was she still alive? Y’know what, it doesn’t matter.
They spend the next few minutes combing the grounds, shouting Dean's name, the raining drowning out their cries. They’re both sweeping their torchlights in wide swathes, hoping to find something when Sam’s light suddenly passes over a dark, child-sized lump under a tree. Before he can even train his torch back on the location, Cas drops his torch and runs.
“I can’t stop telling the truth,” Dean says, running his hand through his hair agitatedly. Sam’s giving him a look like he’s gone insane, so this is going like he’d expected it to so far. Maybe he has, or maybe this is just some weird new strain of hangover-influenced nightmare which is eerily, uncomfortably realistic.
Crowley huffs. “You know what I mean. Look, if all this hullabaloo we went through isn’t just a temporary reset switch for me, I’m not too keen on returning to hell and doing the process over, let alone staying locked in there with Abaddon and the rest. So it’s in both of our best interests, but especially mine, that I avoid chancing it. I’ll play nice, as required.”
“It’s Christmas,” Cas responds with a yawn. He takes a sip of the coffee and hums quietly. “I believe waking up early to herald the day is part of the tradition.”
He’s cut off as Dean drags him into a hug, face pressed tightly into his shoulder, inhaling his familiar scent.
Once Kevin’s done cleaning up the mud on the floors and stairs, he decides to check in on Sam and see how he's faring at cleaning the boys up. He follows the sound of screeching laughter to the communal bathroom and finds Sam completely drenched while Dean and Cas are giggling up a storm at Sam’s predicament.
Cas’ doesn’t respond, uncertain gaze darting from Dean happily stuffing his face, to his own plate, before hesitantly picking a sandwich up. He takes a bite, chewing for a few seconds before scrunching up his face in disgust.
When the steps seem to slow near his room however, Crowley stops reading, though he doesn’t look up from his book. Only when the boys enter without so much as a knock does he look up, considering them coolly.
Cas doesn't let go of the plush toy until they reach the checkout counter, handing it over reluctantly with a promise from Sam that he’ll get it right back.
“You wanna come with?” Sam nods to where Dean’s wandered off and waiting impatiently for them to follow. Cas gives the rack in front of him an assessing look, before turning back to Sam with a shrug.
Sam swallows down his mouthful of spaghetti before he responds, brow raised. “Like what, exactly? I’m not really into celebrating with a Dr. Sexy marathon if that’s what you had in mind.”
“…Are we celebrating something?” Kevin asks, a mixture of confusion and suspicion as he grips his thermos tighter. He’s pretty sure he’s only been holed up in his room for a day or two, three tops while recovering from his hangover. Sure he hasn’t been keeping track of the days before that, but it should still only be May, probably.
Dean hurriedly turns the oven on before grabbing two frozen pizzas out of their old industrial fridge.
Kevin stares at him for a long moment before sighing and leaning back. “How am I the only normal one around here?”
Dean opens and closes his mouth, like a flustered parrot trying to figure out how to speak, but Sam raises his hands up to forestall him. “Didn’t mean to interrupt anything, so I’ll leave you guys to it.” He smirks then. “Congrats on finally getting your heads out of your asses.”
Castiel shakes his head. He isn’t about to let Dean unnecessarily redirect his anger onto Sam. “He was reluctant to talk about it but I inevitably gleaned some details from him. It wasn’t difficult to put it all together after that.”
” Castiel quickly moves over to the radio, switching it off. He doesn't look up at Dean, instead choosing to focus intently on the radio and wishing it could turn back time.
Before Dean can try to parse what he’s getting at or think to ask, Cas shakes his head. “What do you want, Dean?”
the time or place, besides which, he's not the kind of asshole to make Cas think he'd need to have sex with Dean for shit he's happy to give him for free.
“I was wondering why Dean wasn’t assisting today either. You said something about him still being busy.”
“I’m not-” Dean splutters. Sam crosses his arms, giving him an expectant look. Dean quickly casts around through his beer-goggled memory of last night for an example that he wouldn’t need to elaborate on but got his point across.
“You make it sound like I’m planning to stage a coup. And of course he does, who do you think helped set this place up?” Charlie asks, waving her hand to indicate the room.
He’s been slowly inching himself across the kitchen as they’d talked, but he’s still too far from the gun she tossed away. He moves for the back-up tucked into the waistband of his jeans. The kitchen island’s in between them, but if he moved fast enough he could get a kill shot in.
The ache in his chest will dull, eventually. He can only hope it won’t take as long for Cas. After all the pain and misery he’s gone through because of Dean, he shouldn’t have to suffer more.
"So," Dean says, watching the kitchen door swing closed, before turning to Castiel. He raises a brow. "Is he high or something today?"
Dean glances away, something almost guilty flickering across his expression. “I’ll talk to Sam. Just give us a couple more days.”
He forces himself to relax, if only so that he doesn’t tip her off to the fact that they’ve been clued into her master plan.
was strongly implied, his tone of voice insinuating that Sam wasn’t about to be privy to any more examples. Sam couldn’t recall being part of any awkwardly truthful conversations with Dean, so either he was having them with complete strangers or mostly just Cas.
and Castiel, unwilling to pick a side in that particular argument, found himself stuck in the middle. Now that he was human, from sacrificing his own grace to burn the mark away, it made for some awkward living arrangements.
“Dude, just rip it up. No one cares about the wrapping.” Dean groans. Cas ignores him and continues to open it methodically. He’s almost certain Cas is going slower now just to irritate him.
“Sorry I took so long to get back to ya. I was asking around for a solution to your problem, but all of my contacts were a bust. You guys have any progress breakin’ that spell?” Garth says, his voice crackling over the phone’s speaker.
Kevin's lips press together thinly. "Crowley's royally fucked up my life. I can't ever pretend to go back to normal after all that. And you guys want to let him live."
to say anything, to even begin grasping all that Cas was dropping on him, but he should’ve said something, any of the thousand things he’s bit back over the years.
Sure he could tinker around with the other old beauties gathering dust there, but it’s not the same.
Dean goes cross-eyed for a moment staring at her finger as she pulled her hand back before the words sink in.
Curious now, he watches the guy trudge through the aisles, glowering at the options on display as he grabs a few chocolate bars and jerky. Rick can feel the brooding frustration rolling off him all the way across their little store. He decides to mentally name him ‘Angry Butch Guy’ because ‘Frustrated Butch Guy’ is too much of a mental mouthful and it’s not like anyone else is gonna know what he calls them in his head anyway.
Kevin shuffles into the kitchen half an hour later, rubbing at his eyes. He stops and squints at the trio sitting around the dining table eating breakfast.
stuff her in the trunk of the Impala until he could find a good place to burn and bury the body. It’s not a terrible idea.
“In the interest of not getting poisoned again, I’ll help make breakfast today. As long as it’s not eggs.”
Dean peeks his head out from under the covers at the sound of his door opening,  blinking sleepily at Sam as he enters the room.
Just as the coffee machine finally beeps, Sam feels something tugging at his pant leg. He looks down, into a pair of sleepy green eyes.
“‘kay,” Dean agrees quietly, sitting up. Sam hands him the bowl, holding on for a few more seconds to make sure he isn't about to accidentally drop it. After taking a sip, Dean looks up at him in surprise.
Sam rolls his eyes. Crowley waves a hand at the bed, the only other space to sit available in the room. “Stick around, chitchat for a bit.”
“Look, I’m only gonna say this once,” Dean says, rubbing at the back of his head and looking away for a moment, he’s so nervous that it's hard to breathe and looking at Cas is making it worse. But no, he’s not gonna chicken out this time, so he turns back to look Cas in the eye.
He pockets his phone and follows the smell to the kitchen, pausing at the entryway. Dean doesn’t notice him, busy wrestling with a tin of flour.
He quickly takes another bite of his burger before Cas gets any ideas about continuing their previous conversation, swallowing it down roughly at the squinty look Cas gives him.
It’s not that he doesn’t trust the guy, more like he didn’t like the fact that Cas had managed to inherit the Winchester’s magnet for trouble somewhere along the way. Just this once, he hopes that magnet had become faulty.
Kevin bites back a snort, downing the rest of his coffee before standing up. “Guess I’m making breakfast.”
Cas tilts his head thoughtfully, squinting up at a swallow that trills loudly as it flies over his head and into a nearby tree.
Kevin frowns at him, pushing his chair back roughly as he gets up. “I’m gonna get you a towel before you decide to create puddles wherever you go.”
Dean very nearly jumps out of his skin at the sound of Cas’ voice. Instead, he ends up knocking the can of blueberry compote off the island and onto his foot before it rolls onto the floor with a dull
He rubs at his forehead, eyes closed as he mutters to himself, “C’mon Sam, think. Where would she hide her spellbook and hex bags?”
After a few long seconds of mutual staring, he reaches up to gently cup Dean’s cheek with one hand. Dean’s eyes flutter half-shut as he leans into the touch before flitting up to meet Cas’ eyes. The other hand comes up, holding Dean in place.
He stares at Dean for a long moment, then Sam, glancing briefly at Cas who’s watching them curiously over a large glass of milk, before fixing his gaze back on Sam again. He quirks a brow. “Seriously?”
Castiel starts to internally panic. He hadn't given much thought to the possibility of Dean having a boyfriend, but why shouldn't he have one? An intimidating giant of a boyfriend at that; one who might not appreciate him asking Dean out, via a cheesy line on his to-go coffee cup or otherwise.
He fiddles with one of the laminated menus nearby until she’s back, setting the carafe back in the coffee machine before turning to Dean. “You need something else, hon?”
Dean’s torn between laughing at the screw-up and groaning at Cas missing the point, as usual. A groan of resigned amusement wins out which he muffles with the hand he rubs over his mouth. “It’s ‘hold down the fort’. And you’re included, dumbass. Kevin too, if we can pry him out of his room.”
It takes him a few moments of bemoaning his luck to realize that there weren’t any other cars outside. So, either Gravel-Voice guy decided to take a leisurely walk up to the station to buy things instead of going to the corner store down the street,
“The bunker has a ton of items for casting spells,” Sam points out. “The Men of Letters kept a pretty stocked inventory. If we’re lucky, we’ll have all the things we need for this spell.”
“C’mon ya little mud monsters, let’s go get you cleaned up.” Sam grabs their mud-covered hands, dragging them to the bunker’s large, communal bathroom.
“Negating spells are purifiers of a sort, ridding things with malicious effects or intent. The truth, uncomfortable as it may be, doesn’t quite qualify. Of course, I could have dispelled it with a snap of my fingers,” he says, underscoring the words with a loud
“You’re welcome,” She says cheerfully. She picks up the next present, turning it this way and that. “Okay, not sure who this one’s for, can’t see a name-”
or whatever,” Dean stiffens up but Sam ignores it, not allowing himself to lose steam, “if you’re hiding from him because you’re afraid of how he’ll react, then you’ve got to be the blindest person I know. He looks at you like you’re shitting rainbows and puking up stars. Like, even through all the shit we’ve faced these last few years, you’re the best thing to happen to him. It’s-” Sam breaks off with a frustrated noise. He doesn’t say
“Don’t,” Dean says softly, tears springing to his own eyes. He moves to physically stop whatever Cas might try to say but stumbles, the sudden movement pulling at his injury. Cas reaches out immediately, grasping at his shoulders to steady him.
“I get it, Cas,” Dean interrupts, heart tripping over itself in his chest at the intense earnestness behind Cas’ words. “You don’t have to say it.” He’s not quite ready to hear the words. (He’ll still know they exist, waiting on the tip of Cas’ tongue for Dean’s permission.)
His sleep cycle was already long shot to hell for months now, but moving into an underground bunker screwed with his perception of night and day to a new level. Time was just an illusion now. Hell, maybe all of this is some particularly horrendous fever dream because none of the last year and a half feels any more real now than it did living through it.
“You’re not stupid,” Cas says with finality, briefly tightening his grip on Dean’s wrist. Somehow, he hadn’t noticed that Cas had kept holding onto it this entire time, and now that he’s aware of it all he can think of is how nice it feels to have the warm band of his fingers wrapped around his wrist.
Now that he was awake, he couldn’t fall back asleep no matter that his eyes were demanding it. He stays in bed for a few more minutes, blinking tiredly up at the ceiling before getting up with a resigned sigh. Moving on autopilot, he heads for the kitchen in search of coffee. Hopefully, Dean had already woken up and brewed a fresh pot.
He paces in the small confines of the bathroom, running a hand through his hair agitatedly and scowling at his own reflection as he catches a glimpse of it. This was grade-school levels of embarrassing and not the kind of situation Dean Winchester was ever supposed to be caught up in.
that Sam’s still not entirely sure were supposed to be actual fumbled attempts at flirting with the oblivious angel or Dean’s version of pulling Cas’ pigtails. Or, well, wings would probably be more accurate back then. The fact that he’d apparently tried again now and Cas
“Just a couple more minutes?” Sam asks, adding a note of plaintiveness to his voice. He’ll cave and go back if Cas insists, but it’s surprisingly nice just having a walk and talking.
Sam shrugs. “Just thinking. There’s nothing about cursed objects that compel people to tell the truth in whatever I’ve gone through so far, so I’m working backwards with what we
Sam opens his mouth, about to ask how sure Dean is, but Dean continues right on. “We were clearing off some shelves, and I’d been griping about how the stuff in here was a pile of useless crap, just sitting around collecting dust for us to clean off. I remember- I remember handing that to him after I’d checked it, told him to give it to you so you could make the final call on tossing it. He opened it up and took out the feather, to take a closer look or what I don’t know, and then he started spouting off something or other about how ostrich feathers were a big deal in Egypt and some other place forever ago.”
It takes over three hours of searching but they’re able to get all of the items on the spell list. All except for mermaid scales.
“I value our friendship, more than you know,” Cas says finally. “I wasn’t sure I was allowed to have more than this and I would have been content with what we are if that’s how you wanted it to remain.”
Cas shakes his head. “He was more scared than he’d be willing to admit. I assume it feels like he’s able to do even less now while you recover.”
“I’ve wronged you in many ways over the years we’ve known each other. Almost as many as the times I’ve ‘screwed up’ while trying to fix my mistakes,” Cas continues, looking weary and resigned with what he’s admitting. “Saying I’m sorry will never be enough. I know I don’t deserve to be free of the weight of my wrongdoings. But, to forget it all for a while was… peaceful. The spell was as much a curse to you, as it was a gift to me.”
“He can’t help worrying about you,” Cas says solemnly. Before Sam can deflect or lighten the conversation, he continues, “I understand the desire to put what’s happened behind you, but it’s not as easy for Dean. He could do very little to help you with trials, and seeing how it affected you even after they were completed…”
Things carry on this way for a few hours and it’s not until the kids are yawning and rubbing at their eyes that Kevin realizes that it’s long past time that they should have been put to bed. He nudges Sam with his foot, nodding at the kids when he looks up questioningly.
Dean shrugs. “Kinda? But what’s the use askin’ me? Not like I’d know which one it is just cuz you give me options.”
He hesitates for a moment, straining to hear any signs of life from inside the room. It’s unlikely he’s gonna interrupt anything, so he gives a quick rap on the door before walking in.
“I’ve narrowed it down to a few things, but short of actually touching them we don’t know which one’s causing it. So far it doesn’t seem to be dangerous, but obviously that’s not something to take a chance on.”
Cas opens his mouth as Dean settles back into his seat, but Dean cuts him off with a gruff, “We’re not gonna talk about it.”
He bends down, moving to pick up the frame just as Sam reaches him. He pulls Dean aside, away from the broken shards on the floor. “It’s fine, it was an accident. Just, stay with Cas and don’t touch anything else.”
Too slow to react, the scythe grazes Dean’s side just as the angel blade hits its target, his yell of pain louder than the Empty’s muffled grunt. Cas is there to catch him as he staggers back, dragging him hurriedly out of the library.
“Well, that’s abysmal,” Dean says, eyebrows raised. “Thanks for the dark bedtime story,  but- wait, didn’t Crowley say that this feather might be Ma-whatever’s?”
The second eyebrow rises up to join the first. "Not that I don't appreciate how dedicated you are at trying to get out of helping clean up the storeroom, which I’m assuming is what you’re trying to do here, but I need
The spread they walk in on for dinner isn’t entirely surprising at this point for Sam. Still, he sends a slightly incredulous glance at Dean who makes a good effort of steadfastly not looking at either of them. He’d been expecting a good ol’ fashioned brotherly throttling for the gif he sent earlier, not this. It probably isn’t going to happen while Cas is around, which is a surprisingly good motivator to make sure he’s around him more.
you’re able to run around like this, and I’ve kept my mouth shut so far when you keep trying to push yourself, so at least be honest with me when I ask.”
The kids were already tucked into bed and Kevin had decided to call it a night early for once, leaving Sam alone with his research in the library. He’s in the middle of half-reading, half-translating an old Scandinavian spellbook he’d found in storage so he’s not paying attention when he gropes for his phone and answers the call. “Hello?”
“None of your damn business,” Dean bites out, grabbing up the knife and the nearest vegetable, and starts chopping.
“I didn’t realize you were planning to make a twenty-minute walk into town just to buy beer. You could’ve asked me to get some on the next supply run.”
He’s just about polished it off when he remembers something. He reaches over and taps at the table in front of Cas to get his attention. Cas glances at him with a confused frown, a spoonful of mostly melted ice-cream halfway to his mouth.
If he could just find the control gear to switch this into a lucid dream, he could flip this into something that was easier to wrap his head around.
He’s watching everyone greet each other joyfully from a distance, not wanting to bring the mood down. ‘
The last he’d expected to see of Cas was at the bar they’d been scoping out the cupid for before he’d flown off in search of Metatron. He’s still not sure of the specifics on why Cas was there slumming it with them instead of up in Heaven with his siblings.
As a precaution, he makes sure his phone is set to vibrate before setting it aside. Dean’s probably gonna flip spectacularly when he sees it, but he won’t be able to do anything but angrily message Sam about it.
Charlie’s fiddling around on her tablet an hour later, left to her own devices in the library, when Dean wanders into the otherwise empty room and walks up to her.
They shrug, smirking. “Got distracted.” Plucking a candy bar and some gum from the boxes by the cash register, they slide it over to Rick. “I’ll get these too if it’ll make you feel better.”
Tall, blond, and grumpy wasn’t all that different from the more sullen guys passing through, often tired of being on the road for who-knows-how-many hours.
Cas nods thoughtfully before heading to Sam’s worktable and carefully depositing the items in his arms. Without even a backward glance at Sam, he wanders off in the direction of the exit.
He gets a refill of coffee before he leaves, setting aside a covered plate of the remaining pancakes alongside a bottle of the strawberry syrup Cas likes on the island for him to find for whenever he decides to wander in. He wasn’t feeling guilty. Nope. He'd just made extra like a decent person would do.
“I call dibs on having your first child named after me!” Gabriel says enthusiastically, turning to the latest customer with a big grin on his face. “Did you hear? Little Castiel finally found the balls to score a date with his childhood crush. Isn't young love so sweet?”
“…All of it,” Cas replies hesitantly, speaking to the wall in front of him instead of looking at Dean. The room falls silent, the tenseness between them hanging thick in the air.
Sam watches him go curiously, then shrugs and gets back to work. He’s pretty sure Dean’s hiding out in his room, so there’s no chance of Cas running into him. Besides, he hadn’t made any promises to chain Cas down to the storeroom.
starts to play, nudging at Sam with a socked foot and an expectant look. He rolls his eyes at her with a smile but joins in. Cas starts humming along softly next to Dean. Kevin still looks half asleep where he’s sitting with his chin propped up on his hand but Dean thinks he can sort of make out a smile. It’s the most normal Christmas he can ever remember having and it’s… nice. It’s not quite a Hallmark moment but it’s as good as, and that’s more than enough for him.
Apparently the reason he isn’t walking into a shouting match, or a silent glaring match, is because they’ve been better occupied aggressively making out against the kitchen counter. The two of them are going at it like there’s no air in the room except what they can find in each other’s mouths which, ugh. He’s obviously happy for Dean, but he didn’t need to ever see his brother aggressively playing tonsil hockey with his best friend.
“Very well, this weekend then.” Cas says, making it sound like a question and a statement at the same time. When Dean nods at that, he smiles widely. “It’s a… what’s the phrase? It’s a date.”
Putting some space between him and Cas was a side-benefit. Cas hadn’t said anything to the change, hadn’t really said much the entire morning now that he thinks about it.
“Since this is the second time this week that I’ve dropped something on my damn foot, it’s pretty obvious I’m not okay,” Dean grumbles, flexing his foot and wincing. He stares down at the mess on the floor with frustrated dismay before glancing up at Cas with a frown. “I’m gonna put a damn bell on you someday, I swear. You’re supposed to be less ninja-y now that you’re human.”
Belatedly, Rick remembers that he was asked a question. Still stuck on the guy’s insane blue eyes, his mouth decides to go ahead and answer before his brain’s formulated an actual response. “Other than those ridiculously blue eyes-” He freezes, then stutters, “uh- I mean, no. No, sir.”
He turns to leave, before deciding he can risk two seconds to leave one parting remark. “Maybe take your celebration somewhere else though like, oh,
“Listen, I wasn’t able to keep either of you safe either, so if this is anyone’s fault, it’s mine,” Sam says, deciding to change tracks. Cas looks up, ready to object, so Sam continues, “Hunts go wrong sometimes, no matter how good we are. Hell, sometimes our lives are the ones that go pear-shaped, not the hunt.”
Cas doesn’t respond, but Dean can hear the sounds of him eating a few seconds later, so he allows himself to relax a bit. Taking a sip of his coffee, he glances Cas’ way, only to find himself on the receiving end of another squinty look.
When he meets Castiel’s eyes then, though his expression looks a little lost, it feels like some of the distance between them has lessened.
“Be there in a minute!” Sam shouts back, voice echoing down clearly from the library. Dean’s idly scrolling the internet on his phone when he finally ambles into the kitchen. “Gave up on your record-keeper dreams already, Sammy?”
There’s a swooping mix of relief and dismay in his gut at the realization that maybe he can spin this somehow, reroute this conversation before it crashes and burns their friendship with it.
Cas follows his gaze, glancing down at it. “It’s in Dutch,” he says, having correctly assumed where Dean’s thoughts had gone. “And I suppose you could call it ‘The American Buccaneers’ though the literal translation of its name is more like ‘The American Sea Robbers’. It’s a biography and history of pirates of the seventeenth century by a Dutch buccaneer who was active at that time.”
The woman's smile turns amused before rattling off her order. Gabriel pouts petulantly, rubbing at the back of his head while Castiel completes her order. He brightens up abruptly, all traces of his earlier sulkiness vanishing.
Dean starts scanning the crowd for Sam and Eileen as he hurries over to Jack. Amara said that she’d fixed Jack, and they’d believed her, so what was wrong now?
Dean startles in surprise, badly enough that he loses his grip on the tin he’d been trying to open. It lands solidly on his foot and then onto the floor with a dull
“I, uh, I have somethin’ for ya,” Dean mumbles, looking down and kicking at the ground in front of him.
There’s barely enough coffee in the carafe for one mug’s worth and it’s just a few steps above lukewarm, but he’ll take the caffeine however he can get it.
“What’re you reading?” He leans closer, tilting his head to see if he could make out what’s on the page a bit better. None of it looked like actual words he could recognize.
“Nah, can’t stick around for lunch today. Just make my coffee to-go, and maybe pack up a slice of pie. Sammy’s visiting for a few days and he has stuff he wants to do so I promised to chauffeur him around. I know, I’m an awesome brother.”
Sam stares at the table in surprise for a moment, before peeking down to find Cas holding Buzzy close to himself protectively and glaring at him.
Once the smoke dissipates Sam, Kevin and Charlie are able to see that – yes, Dean and Cas are finally back to normal. It takes a few seconds before everyone realizes that while Dean and Cas were adults again, they were currently very naked adults.
It takes a few moments for Kevin to respond. “Not the worst idea ever. You realize I’m still technically underage, right?”
"What was it you were saying about your reflexes?" she asks, smirking. She turns to look back at her radio with a frown. "I liked that radio."
“What I said earlier wasn’t… wrong exactly. Wait, damn it.” He rubs a hand down his face with a groan. “I sound like a friggin’ sissy. I, uh… fuck it, I
“This guy bothering you, Cas?” he asks, almost on top of Cas with how close he’s standing. Cas doesn’t seem particularly surprised by Dean’s sudden appearance, only briefly glancing at Dean.
Cas stares at him, lips parted and eyes wide. He isn’t saying anything, just sitting there and gaping at him. Shit, maybe he
“There,” Dean grunts when he notices the door to one of the storage rooms lying ajar. Cas redirects immediately. When he turns to Dean, concerned and hand stretched out to heal him, he grits his teeth and shakes his head, taking a half-step back to lean against the wall. “Block the door.”
Dean snorts quietly, half-rolling his eyes. “Think Sam’s the one that said compromise is when both sides aren’t happy.”
They’re quiet for a long moment, letting the information sink in. Finally, Sam says, “At least we learned something from this.”
The woman's expression goes from scared to irritated so fast that it almost gives Dean whiplash.  "Ugh, fine. So you found me. What gave me away?"
Sam’s still frowning at the contents of the fridge, wondering if maybe he should have another talk with Dean when he opens his mouth to respond and finds himself saying, “Like I barely survived being roadkill some days, but… good.”
“Nuh-uh, nope. Didn’t interrupt a thing, Sammy. Cas and I were just shooting the shit. C’mon, let’s go feed your giant, lazy ass,” Dean says, jumping up and clapping his hands together. He moves to the door to herd his brother out into the hall before stopping at the doorway and turning back to look at Cas.
Of course, the noise wakes Cas up, his face slipping off his palm and jolting back up in sleepy confusion.
“I believe we’d been doing rather well with Dean’s aid initially. I didn’t realize he would be so busy as he is with household work,” Castiel says offhandedly. “I understand the bunker is significantly larger than an average home, of course, but I don’t recall him being anywhere near as busy when you were unwell.”
“Tha’s ‘cuz you a Sam-oh-saw-us,” Dean replies, giggling. Sam decides to retract his earlier thought. His brother was clearly an adorable smartass.
A dozen thoughts chase each other around his mind, but one question stands out louder than the rest. “How long?”
Kevin rubs a hand tiredly down his face as he wanders down the hall with only one thing on his mind: coffee.
“I kept getting a scratchy feeling in my throat like I wanna hack or cough sometimes but… what?” Dean trails off, catching Sam’s frown.
An uncomfortable silence descends upon the kitchen, Dean’s last statement hanging in the air. Castiel’s shoulders slump.
“As for the clothes, they’re yours if you want ‘em. We’ll buy you some of your own if you don’t like them. And about the stuff,” Dean says, regretfully moving back to indicate the box, “I didn’t mean it like you think, I just… figured you deserved better stuff than what you’d find lying around in the dirt outside I guess.”
“Like how you were planning to lock the pearly gates behind you and your siblings and now you’re stuck here instead, and human to boot. That was gonna be a
“Yup.” Dean nods, patting his own mound of mud into shape. He directs Cas to keep adding mud and dirt to it till they both have decent-sized mud pies in front of them.
The newly enforced distance between them is discomforting, to say the least. It struck differently from similar times past. Maybe the feelings were magnified in the empty chasm inside him from the loss of his connection to his siblings, to Heaven. Maybe this was just how strongly humans felt things.
“Yeah,” Kevin agrees, brushing the snow off his head and shoulders. “It’s mostly snowing in town, though it’s definitely making its way here.”
“My name’s Donnie Scofield, I’m a mechanic from Wichita and…” he trails off. Sam’s giving him Judgmental Bitch Face #4, the
“Well, would you look at the time? I have some stuff I need to take care of before bed. Don’t forget to wash up.”
Ma’at’s actual feather,” Sam says, tone turning exasperated. “No amount of digging online’s gonna get us a solution because the internet hasn’t become a how-to guide on dealing with cursed knock-offs yet.”
Readjusting his grip on the sweating beer bottle in his hand, he wanders closer. It’s only when he’s a couple of feet away that he realizes that Cas is asleep. Straight up conked out over a book, like a sleeping version of the Thinker statue.
With the end of May looming, they’ve just about resigned themselves to the fact that they might never break the spell. That is, until Kevin finally finds a solution.
“Sorry,” Rick says, looking down to pay more attention to bagging someone’s purchase than he ever has.
“Sure. C’mon munchkins, let’s go find some clothes for you to wear,” Kevin says, herding them out of the bathroom.
Having successfully outfitted Cas and Dean in proper kids' clothes, he deposits the kids in the backseat of the Impala. Miraculously, he also manages to get the dead witch wrapped up in a sheet and out of the house and into the trunk without anybody catching him. At this point, he’ll take whatever luck he can get.
"I don't know why I'm even surprised anymore." Dean shakes his head ruefully. “I swear, one day I’m gonna do something about the black hole of pop culture knowledge you have in that head of yours.”
“If he doesn’t show up, the worst that’s likely to happen is that he’ll wander in here a couple of hours later scrounging for cold leftovers.”
“Food for thought,” Crowley says with a shrug, going back to his dinner. He looks back up just in time to see the door closing.
He coughs a little, clearing his throat. “Just made me try her drinks a couple times to teach me not to try and say shit about them. They were, uh,” Dean grimaces again, “strong, I guess.”
“Why d’you even want me ‘wound, Cas?” Dean asks, sniffling and hiccuping, making it harder to get the words out. Tears ran down his cheeks, mixing with the rainwater dripping from his hair. “Can’t help Sammy or Kevin. I pwobably annoy you too, you’re just too nice to say anythin’.”
Crowley makes an agreeable, disdainful noise. “It leaves things more up to chance, but yes. Now, I’m assuming this game of Twenty Questions
Cas smiles at him then, though it wobbles. There’s the beginning of tears in his eyes and it’s a sucker punch to Dean’s gut, because he’s never seen
Sam slants a look at Dean. He’s got some idea of what Dean’s trying to avoid; unsurprisingly, getting him to talk about his feelings is like pulling teeth. This being the equivalent of him trying to dodge a trip to the dentist.
Getting under the hood of his Baby is a kind of comfort that all his hours in the kitchen can’t emulate. It’s a part of his heart, and still home beyond the place they’re living in now.
Sam stares at him for a moment before relenting with a shrug and half-nod of agreement and gets back to eating breakfast.
“I know it’s not going to be appreciated me saying this, and you're welcome to tell me to shut up, but honestly? I've known that boy for a long while, and I'd say Dean likes you right back.” Jody suddenly cringes, hand flying up to slap over her eyes in embarrassment. “God, I sound like I’m back in grade school again. You know what, forget I said anything.”
“I’ve been making my own records as we go, figuring I’d fill it in from whatever indexes or stuff we manage to find.” Sam shrugs. “Thought I’d switch gears today and try having the information first instead, seeing as most of the stuff we’ve found hasn’t even been mentioned.”
He makes his way to Cas on unsteady legs, not even looking at anything else except Cas’ face. If this is a dream, he’s holding onto the sight of that face till the very last second.
“Dean said something the other day,” Cas says slowly, frown turning thoughtful. “Based on what you’ve told me, I would assume it was a flirtation, but...”
Having been mollified by the ice cream and exhausted by their exciting day, the kids end up snoozing in the backseat all the way home.
It takes Sam all of half an hour to come to the realization that shopping with children, let alone shopping
Sure, they’ve managed to get everyone back: Eileen, Bobby, Stevie, Charlie and all the rest, hell even Becky Rosen apparently (and isn’t that a wild kick from the past), but not… not the reason Dean’s even there to be seeing it in the first place.
“Stop making up lies, Gabriel,” Castiel says, punctuating it with a slap upside the back of his head. He turns to face the customer, feeling somewhat awkward. “He’s not my childhood crush, but thank you.”
Charlie and Kevin are busy talking animatedly about who knows what, but he catches Sam’s watching them with a smile. It makes Dean feel like he’s being spied on even though he’s not doing anything illegal.
Sam’s lips purse as he looks away from Cas. “He has some things he needed to take care of, so it’s just the two of us.”
Before Cas can attempt to push for answers, Dean claps his hands together and says, “Let’s get going before my stomach decides to start eating itself.”
He doesn’t know why it’s bothering him so much. Okay no, that was a lie. He knows why. He’s known since they’d found the angel tablet, when he very nearly admitted to more than he ever planned to. Known since he sat across from Cas in a tiny motel room and felt like the solid ground got yanked out from under his feet as Cas told him he might off himself facing the weight of his mistakes. Known since- there’s no one specific moment in time that it dawned on him that Cas’ presence in his life was irreplaceable, he just knows.
Sam shrugs. Small talk was, unsurprisingly, awkward since they never actually did it before. He doesn’t really have much else he can think of talking other than ‘work’ or Dean, and both topics were technically off-limits. So.
Admittedly, it’s not so much an ultimatum as it is an inevitability. He might’ve lost the possibility of pretending he lives in a normal world and any hopes of going back to the life he had before all this, but the one he’s in now was never going to be one he’d put down roots in.
every so often to prove I’m still on the straight and narrow and all that. Well, in a manner of speaking of course.”
“Napping,” Kevin replies, not looking up from his book. “It’s something humans do, kids are just allowed to get away with it more.” He looks up then, in time to catch the look Sam’s giving him.
“Fine,” he says reluctantly, turning his back on Cas as he shoves the half-kneaded pie dough into the fridge. He needs to get changed before they head out, considering there’s blueberry paste dotting his jeans and shoes. “Go get your coat and meet me in the war room in ten minutes or I’m leaving without you.”
He fiddles with the kitchen radio until he finds a classic rock station and turns the volume up high, letting Zeppelin’s tunes wash over him as he cooks.
Over the course of the week, more often than not, Sam or Kevin would find Cas sulking somewhere in the library with Buzzy in his lap or by his side. He hadn’t taken it well when they decided he wasn’t allowed to stay with Dean while he was sick and set up another room further away from Dean’s for him to stay in. He took it considerably less well when he’d been told he wasn’t allowed to visit Dean while he was sick, and had taken to sneaking into his room when no one was paying attention. Considering how smoothly things had been going with Cas until then, Sam figures something like this was long overdue. He’s just grateful that Cas hadn’t managed to get sick from their stint in the rain or his regular Houdini acts into Dean’s room.
Cas’ lips twitch up in a brief but real smile, something almost fond in his expression if Sam has to guess. “It’s not worth troubling you.”
“Because most people tend to side-eye two full-grown men at a park, even if they’re not trying to pretend the kids they’re with are theirs,” he replies easily, giving Sam a look. “No one’s going to believe Dean’s your brother, and he isn’t exactly good at pretending you’re his dad even if you ask him to; he barely manages to pretend you’re his uncle.” He shrugs out of his jacket one-handed, switching his grip on the plastic bag as he pulls it off and drapes it on the nearest chair. “I don’t wanna imagine what he’d try to pass me off as.”
Sam turns to Cas then, only to find him already staring at him, intent and vaguely curious. He’s got a few inches on Dean, maybe even a year or two if Sam had to guess.
Dean’s an old hand at uncomfortable silences at this point, but this one has him grasping for something, anything to break it.
Cas keeps at it for a few more seconds but the pain only abates, not subsiding much. Cas’ hand falls away as he steps back, staring down at Dean’s bloodied side. “I’m sorry,” he says quietly, “I’m not strong enough - an injury from Death’s scythe isn’t something I can heal.”
It’s too early in the day to be dealing with this. Not that there’s ever really a good time to be dealing with Crowley. “You’ll go back after you get breakfast?” Dean asks tiredly.
“Hey,” Dean replies, smiling stiffly. It’s not immediately noticeable for what it’s worth, what with his cheeks being stuffed full, Sam just knows what to look for. Dean’s lucky Cas doesn’t.
“C’mon kiddo, you've been swooning over lil ol’ Dean for months now. Besides, it’s Valentine’s Day, love’s in the air-” Gabriel waves at the romantically decorated bakery-slash-coffee shop, “-along with a slew of hormones. It’s the perfect time.”
“Yes,” Cas admits, fingers fidgeting with the hem of his sweater. “I wasn’t sure what colors to choose for it at first. It took a bit of thought to decide on making one in the colors of your likely Hogwarts house.”
of begging and pouting before Kevin finally lets them go play outside the bunker. Not that the bunker wasn't awesome – cuz it’s a huge place with lots of weird things Sammy wouldn't let them touch or get near, that part wasn't so great – but staying inside all the time was so
“Okay, fine, so if it’s a knockoff means it’s not it, right?” At Crowley’s neutral expression, Dean growls, “
“Witch hunt went sideways,” Sam replies, running a hand through his already messy hair and making it messier. He sighs. “I got rid of the spellbook and hex bags but it did jack about this.”
his brain responds. Instead of saying that out loud, Dean shrugs. “Wasn’t gonna assume, and it’s five kinds of clingy dumbass that I ain’t to ask.”
Sam stares at him thoughtfully. Maybe working alone in silence was starting to get to the guy, for all he knew. Not that Cas has ever been chatty for as long as Sam’s known him, but he can get how Dean’s constant commentary can become soothing background noise. If Dean’s side of things is anything to go by, then Cas must’ve been dealing with his cold shoulder for a while now.
Before he gets the opportunity to stick his foot in his mouth again, Grumpy Male Model dude comes up behind the guy with a gruff, “Got everything you need, Cas?”
“I want to believe you’d actually try to be better, but we haven’t survived this long by just hoping.”
“Hey Cas, I wanted to ask-” Dean starts to say, walking into Cas’ room. His voice trails off when he sees Cas sitting on his bed, staring at what looked like an old shoebox in his lap with a fond expression on his face.
He keeps dancing as the song goes on, somehow managing a smooth glide across the room while moving to the beat.
Sam opens the door wider, looming large even as he leans against the doorframe. “I’m starving and you guys are sitting here chatting away. You promised me burgers, dude.” He blinks, suddenly becoming aware of the strangely tense atmosphere in the room.
Cas casts a reluctant glance in Sam’s direction. He either sees something of what Sam’s thinking on his face or maybe he feels similarly, whichever it is, Sam can see it coming when Cas caves with a small sigh.
“You’ve one less item to consider now,” Crowley points out. Unsurprisingly, Dean doesn’t look any more grateful about that than he did a few minutes ago, so Crowley adds condescendingly, “As much as magical nuances evade you, having a natural affinity for magic does
“So, what was Gabriel hounding you about this time?” Jody is a good boss, kind and occasionally nosy, but never mean. She’s only asking out of kind concern, Castiel knows, and she’d back down without pushing the matter if he wished. It’s no secret from his coworkers at this point considering how much Gabriel teases him about his crush on Dean so he sees no reason to refrain.
Dinner passes by with Sam and Cas embroiled in a discussion of some book, apparently what he’d been reading before he fell asleep; the most Dean contributes to that is a muttered comment about them starting up a book club which mostly goes ignored. That’s fine with him, not a conversation he wanted to be a part of anyway.
Once the man had paid and left, Jody returns her attention to Cas. There’s no avoiding her so he doesn't try.
On a whim, he decides to keep an eye out for any mentions of Veritas. It’s a reach, but it’s not like they’ve got anything else to go on.
“Alright. We’ll need to spread out a bit to try and cover more rooms. I’ll take the upper level; both of you can check the storerooms and the other rooms on this level.”
Dean opens his mouth, mentally scrambling for some kind of excuse and “No,” is what comes out instead. He winces internally as the little hopeful smile Cas had wavers. Seriously, fuck this stupid curse for taking away any of the tact he’s had for the past thirty-plus years and turning him into more of an ass than he tries to be. “I mean, aren’t you guys busy?”
Having polished off his dinner, Dean extricates himself from the dining table while Sam and Cas keep talking. Depositing his plate in the sink, he nabs a clean plate from the dryer rack, piling on a few of the remaining slices.
“You’d make a promising line cook in a diner yet,” he tells Dean as he makes his way into the kitchen.
Sam barely notices Cas when he wanders into the storeroom, focused as he is on the file in front of him, managing a grunt in response when Cas greets him as he walks past.
“Uh-huh,” Sam responds instead, proud of the fact that it comes out sounding normal. Man, he wishes he could’ve seen how that conversation played out. Probably not well, considering Dean was the one who said it, but still.
“I won’t make any promises,” he tells Dean. “And besides, Crowley said it should probably wear off on its own, right? So, wait it out. It’s already been, what, three days?”
Dean grunts in acknowledgment. Depositing the spilled flour into the trash, he carelessly drops the dustpan aside, brushing his hands off on his jeans.
“Before you complain,” Kevin says, finally looking up, “they needed the fresh air. I could see ‘em starting to get stir-crazy.”
“I don’t care if you can heal me or not, Cas, you’re not here to play holy nursemaid, or, y’know, normal nursemaid.” He takes a sip of his coffee, sighing. “It’s… our lives kinda suck, if I’m being honest. We get played crappy hands, and we always end up losing people we care about along the way. Hell, you’ve had a front-row seat to see it happen to us.”
Gathering up the dirty dishes, Dean heads back to the kitchen to start washing up. His mind wanders as he works, idly considering the logistics of setting up a rec room in one of the myriad of unused rooms they have available to them. The kitchen’s Dean’s favorite place in the bunker so far, for obvious reasons, but it’s not really a place to kick back and relax. This place was their home now, and it’s sizable enough that they can afford to have a living room
“It’s obvious is what it is,” Dean retorts, preening internally. Cas still didn’t get most jokes, or, if he did, it was in a different angle (usually philosophical in ways Dean just doesn’t get) than what anyone else was seeing. So yeah, Dean’s going to take whatever wins he gets here.
Maybe they’d all laugh about it over a couple of beers when things were back to normal. Well, Sam would laugh, Kevin too probably. His brother and Cas would probably be glaring at him and sputtering over their beers if he timed things right.
Dean scowls, expression dark and building in anger. Crowley holds a hand up to cut off whatever tirade he’s likely winding up for at the same time that Sam places a hand on his shoulder with an expression on his face like he’s mentally telling his brother to calm down. Dean doesn’t acknowledge the look, but he takes a deep breath, arms crossed. Sam turns to Crowley then with a prompting look.
gesture and just waves in the direction of the fridge again. The entire kitchen could probably use a proper cleanup, but a bunch of wet towels would do for now.
“I can’t change the past. I-” He hesitates for a moment, swallowing before he continues, “I would take away your memories of that time if I could, but I won’t throw away what you gave to me as a child, meaningless as it is to you.”
“Anyways, I really gotta go, Sasquatch’s waiting,” Dean says, jutting a thumb behind him in Sam’s direction, still standing by the door and watching their interaction with interest. He moves to leave but abruptly stops, turning back to look at Castiel.
Without thinking, Dean turns to look at Cas and gets an eyeful of him standing there completely naked and uncaring of the fact.
He stops abruptly as he enters the kitchen, staring around in confusion. There’s a casserole dish of something or other cooling on top of the stove, and a giant closed pot of something cooking away on the burner beside it. Across from it, the kitchen island is practically covered in a mess of ingredients and utensils.
“Look, that’s not- I didn’t mean it like that. I just-” Sam flounders. “Dean has reasons for it, mostly stupid, but I get them. I really wish I could explain-”
“You’ll be going back to the storeroom after this I’m guessing?” Cas asks, watching a thrush fly overhead.
Dean grins when he sees Castiel, picking up his pace as he walks up to the counter. Before either of them can say anything, Gabriel decides to make his presence known.
Sam sips at his beer thoughtfully. “A night out’s not a bad idea. It’ll be a good new experience for Cas too. Might even be enough to get Kevin to stick his head out of his room.”
He quickly maneuvers around an elderly lady to turn the cart around and heads towards where Cas is still standing. Parking the cart and Dean a few feet away, he heads over to Cas, crouching a bit once he’s close enough. “Hey buddy, you found something you like?”
‘Cas’ glances back at Rick even as his friend marches off without him, manages to finally root out the change he’d been searching for and hands it over with a quick ‘thank you’ that sounded more like a question by the end of it before following after him.
“It became my damn business when you asked me to keep him busy while you’re doing whatever the hell you’re doing now,” Sam retorts. “Would it kill you to just talk to him? At least tell him he hasn’t monumentally screwed up somehow because I’m pretty sure he thinks he’s done something to make you mad at him.”
“If you wanna stay here and choke to death from the dust of these ancient relics, power to you, I guess,” Dean says, rolling his eyes. “Don’t forget to feed Crowley. I don’t wanna come back to deal with him being pissy.”
Sam huffs, pushing a wet strand of hair out of his eyes. “You’d think it was too early in the year for rain considering we’ve barely had any snow all winter. This is what I get for not checking the weather report.” He starts trying to squeeze water out of the ends of his hair.
“They were bored with their coloring books so I let them watch TV in your room.” Kevin stops by the library archway, giving Sam a once over. He takes a sip of coffee, then asks, “Cold outside?”
It does the trick before Sam has to decide if he needs to intervene or let Dean pick out his own toy to be mollified (something he’d enjoy teasing him for when things are back to normal, but right now he just wants this shopping trip to be
Cas stares at him quietly, Dean can pretty much see the gears turning in his head at having the decision tossed to him, at what it means. But the look he’s got on his face as he stares at Dean is so fucking soft that it makes him feel like he’s got a freaking horde of butterflies in his stomach.
