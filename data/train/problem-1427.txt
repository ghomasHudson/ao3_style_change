“Captain Watson!”
“My home, then.”
Several weeks go by and Corporal Murray reappears at John’s bedside, “Cap’t - you gave me a right scare,” he glances around the ward then sits on the bed at John’s side.
With the door closed, Sherlock starts filling the tub, as a cover for examining the room. Like many manor house dressing rooms, the wall contains a secret panel from which a valet (or mistress) can easily enter or leave. When the room was converted to a bath, the passage was not removed - it was partially blocked by the installation of the tub. Fortunately, the door opens out into the passageway to the servants quarters. Sherlock shuts the water, and lets the bath drain a bit under cover of flushing the toilet. Then he turns the hot water spigot on, grabs a dressing gown and slippers from the wardrobe, and with a press of the panel - he disappears down the narrow hallway.
Jeff leaves the kitchen, and Irene walks over to the cloudy window - opening her compact. It’s mirror flashes a series of signals outside. Then, adjusting the edge of her lipstick, Irene closes the compact and returns to the lounge to face Moriarty.
“You have a place in the city?”
“Major - some Christmas cheer?” John Watson wheels himself to James Sholto’s bedside, sloshing a flask, “Courtesy of Harry - guess it’s her thought for a care package.”
“My needles were always clean”, Sherlock slurs, still under the influence of the earlier drug.
The song "Now It Can Be Told" is completely TRMOJaS. ;)  From the Irving Berlin songbook - here is my favorite recording:
Alessandre has exhausted her patience.
“You….”
The war took Moriarty away from England, which allowed Irene much more latitude to operate independently. It also brought her into circles of military men and their secrets - which made for both a lucrative side business and a first line of defence for when she misbehaved - which was always.
“Of course not,” Sherlock huffs, “He was just...expedient.”
“Two?”
“Quite. I didn’t expect you would agree to keep her, but she seems...uh..nice. How did you get rid of Mycroft so quickly?”
“Thank you, Harrow. Dismissed.”
Jim Moriarty signals to his driver, who picks up Sherlock as though he were a small boy and carries him towards a stairwell.
“Of course, Brother Mine.”
we should concentrate our efforts. Instead, Moriarty implied he pursued the expedient path of least resistance and seduced someone’s secretary. Now the invasion plans
"Sherlock, are Northern mining practices really pillow-talk between you? Capt. Watson is more exceptional than I allowed - exceptionally what, I won't venture to say."
The four stare at each other, only Alessandre is entirely self-possessed. There is a knock at the door. Mycroft draws his gun.
When John reaches his room, there is a telegram waiting for him
“Be silent, both of you. Do not speak again until we are behind closed doors in The Stranger’s Room.”, Mycroft bites out.
“I don’t think that is any of your business.”
“Why would I prevent my only brother from participating in an invasion where brute force is the order of the day and his particular talents would be of no use?” Mycroft snaps.
Sherlock and John discuss the elephant in the room....or the Range Rover Sentinel.
“No.”
“A man?”
Sherlock presses his forehead against John’s...there is no way to tell John the truth. At the same time, Sherlock wants this moment again and again with his handsome blonde Captain.
“And what of your soldier?”
I wonder if your silence perhaps indicates that those days do not stand in such sharp relief for you? I would understand - genius is easily bored. Though it would mean the world to me if I could hear those words directly from you. I’m stuck, you see. Until I know otherwise, for me - It’s Always You.
“And when I do - no matter where you are - I
Comments, please!?! I need some motivation to come back to the page, in a life that is - otherwise - a madhouse. Cheers!
As the final, frantic bars of the movement play, Mycroft lifts Alessandre’s fingers to his lips. He kisses each of her fingers in turn, breathing in her scent - not one he knows - but captivating.  Her hand remains relaxed in his, but her eyes never leave the orchestra until the final mad runs of the soloist - an explosion of virtuosity - that Mycroft cannot hear over his hammering pulse when Alessandre's peerless eyes lock with his own.
But Mycroft replies, “Anthea will be here with something suitable shortly.”
Mycroft Holmes is so rarely surprised that he says nothing at all. Anthea takes the lack of response for consent and amends the workers’ orders.
soldier?”
“That's not Moran and you know it. Are you disappointed? Poor Sebastian - loyal unto death to King and Country, after all. Maybe that’s how you’ll bond with this one...his little Captain, your brave, strapping Colonel...", Irene gestures back to the room where Sherlock Holmes is held. "How does the poem run? ‘
I hope you are liking this story as much as I am enjoying researching it. <3
As dinner progresses - Mycroft finds himself considering a seduction, a train of thought that alarms him to no end. His mission was to broker an arranged marriage between Crown and Country and the American professor, not to be taken in his own trap. Still, they discuss everything from advanced mathematics to Sibelius's symphony that they are about to attend.
Alessandre reunites with Jim Moriarty - and plans the opening gambit in a new game with the Holmes Siblings.
“Dead men need to stay off the grid, we can’t all be enjoying private dining at the Wolseley.”
It's always you
Sherlock considers for a moment, “His name is James Moriarty. Irish national but deported in the late-20’s, heavily involved in human trafficking before the war - mostly Russia, also in Germany. He served as procurer for a number of individuals who would later rise to power in Third Reich. He is farsighted enough that - I believe - his motivation was subsequent blackmail. Now Moriarty is looking for a more substantial payout - and so he is using his connections within the Nazi party to drive a bidding war for secrets regarding the strategy and order of battle for High Command in the European Theatre. He has someone on the inside, likely Moran - his former lover, who can gain access to information, but he is missing some key details.”
The Sibelius is his undoing. As the romantic theme swells and the orchestra chases the lush violin line, Mycroft’s hand crosses the distance between them, sliding first over her wrist at a pulse point then grasping her hand. Alessandre never looks away from the orchestra but doesn't remove his hand.
“Ah, come now, Billy- they never guess”, Watson tightens his pack and jumps down into the LCA which will bring them into the JIG Green sector of Gold Beach.
“Hardly, this is my brother’s club. It has special security concerns, as His Majesty is also a member.”
They tour the gallery - Mycroft stands closer to her than he should. He is more interested than he ought to be...he cares more than he should. Alessandre is flirting with him, but Mycroft cannot tell if she means to flirt, or if it’s completely impersonal.
“It’s a sight better defended than the HC boys guessed, innit?”, Bill grouses.
John tries to follow Sherlock, but the tide of humanity pushing in the opposite direction takes him into the Tube station at Piccadilly Circus. From there, he takes the underground to Marble Arch, changing lines at Bond Street and by the time he climbs from the station, the All Clear sirens wail. He settles down on his bed, hopeful for a decent night’s sleep - uninterrupted by dreams of Sherlock or air raid sirens and the Luftwaffe. As he lays between the hotel’s starched white sheets, he replays their conversation again.
“Yes”, Alessandre looks nervous.

Of course, Winston Churchill and his infamous cigars (R&J's) visit Mycroft in the dead of night.
The SOE (aka "Baker Street Irregulars") were actively involved in undercover operations in France, working with the French Underground - prior to the D-Day Invasion.
Sherlock Holmes meets John Watson, and Watson's CO - Sebastian Moran.
solidified - but he or she knew when Overlord planning was ‘heating up’. If you say that Overlord strategy
“Mycroft, don’t fuss. He consented...although perhaps he had a different idea of what he was getting into. Remind me - is attempting to sodomize patients in the linen cupboard a standard therapeutic practice or will Mr Rocher potentially be facing disciplinary action if our little escapade became widely known?  I assure you, he is safe - as long as he doesn’t fall off the bed,” Sherlock grins as he steepled his fingers, pressing them against his lips.
You dare me to be untrue
Sherlock continues.
After a moment, John breaks their silence, “So - this is the last time for a long while - we ought to make it...good. Send your soldier away with something to keep him warm?”
“Mr Holmes - I will be needing your arm”, Irene slides Sherlock’s shirt cuff back, swabbing the vein with alcohol, “Well - I suspected this might be difficult. You weren’t always careful, were you?”
. Miners had no resources for sophisticated monitoring systems, so they used the birds as indicators of gas leaks because canaries were particularly sensitive to gas at low concentrations - ".
, as he looks for signs to the WC in the hallway.
“Mr Holmes….Mycroft.  I appreciate the consideration, but all I need is a rare steak and good wine to maintain reasonable focus at dinner. We maths professors leave the secret keeping and clandestine discussions to Physics and Quantum Chemists - they enjoy their mad scientist reputations as much as Hadron supercolliders. So - this is unnecessary - unless you are planning a seduction?” Alessandre laughs, not unkindly.
Mycroft laughs as well, but the well oiled gears of his mind turn, unbidden, to the white expanse of Alessandra’s throat and her dancing marine blue eyes.
The Shaftesbury Fountain with the statue of Anteros was featured in BBC Sherlock's S1E1. It is in the same place (Piccadilly Circus) - where Stamford and Watson meet in the original A Study In Scarlet (at the Criterion Bar), and it is also quite close to Rainbow Corner - the epicentre of this story.
The applause of the crowd surprises them both - Alessandre stands, gathering her clutch and leaves the box with the confidence of a woman who knows a man will follow her, unquestioning.
“What of him?”, Jim snaps at Irene, “Sebastian is a fool. He could have abandoned them - he knew they would be walking into a human abattoir…”
“Sherlock, really…”
“John Watson is recuperated enough, physically, that he will be discharged soon. His mental state, however, is precarious. I am given to understand that he would very much like to be reunited with you - even if only to hear that you no longer bear him the same regard as once you did.”
“Then, please call me Mycroft.”
Rating has gone from M to E with this Chapter.
Moran, John, and Sherlock all prepare for the Normandy Invasion, while Jim Moriarty plays a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse back home in London.
“Well, thank goodness you are immune to such urges.”, John smiles at Mycroft without a hint of humour. Sherlock grins and arches a single eyebrow in Mycroft’s direction.
“I believe he could be”, John pushes the needle home in his arm, “Good night, Colonel” - and walks away.
“No - you were hoping that he liked you” Irene eyes Jim speculatively. “I can tell you the truth, Jim. Maybe I’m the last one who can...where
“A lot of useless information...we are looking for a leak-any of his agents could be compromised-while the real puzzle eludes us: who would attempt to target Mycroft?”

correspondence, or see that
“Are you planning on sleeping tonight? I can take the sofa for one evening.”
“Not long, then.” Sherlock sneers.
“You would think that the people of Gravesend would turn to God, what with the Luftwaffe bombing the local RAF airstrip with alarming regularity - but here we are - alone in the chapel”
“John was injured! His injuries clearly encompass his dominant hand - you can tell from the shaky handwriting. John was hurt and I wasn’t there,” Sherlock tears at his hair.
Sherlock can hear the band playing
“John - you should note the time. That is something I never thought I'd hear in our lifetime.”
Hours late for tea, Sherlock resentfully hails a cab to take him to Mycroft at the Diogenes Club. John left his bed only an hour before - Sherlock had to send one of the more reliable members of his homeless network to bring them some food, as John discovered after their evening and morning exertions that Sherlock didn't have so much as a packet of biscuits in.

doing…”
Thank you for reading and ESPECIALLY for commenting. AU's are particularly difficult because there is so much world-building and in the case of historical ones, research.  I had John in a bedsit until I realized that - by the end of the war - there were no apartments to be had in London. Similarly - the statue of Anteros (familiar to those who watched A Study in Pink) - well, it was rusticated to Surry for the duration of the war. Thank you for sticking with me - and I will be wrapping up soon to begin another adventure.
The Mount Royale Hotel (near Speaker's Corner) was where Major Glenn Miller stayed - and American GI's were given a list of available hotels because there were no flats left in London. It was hit by a V2 rocket in March of '45, but remained somewhat functional.
Mycroft can hear the sounds of Marquez’s ‘Danzon #2’ and wonders - if Sherlock were here - would he gather Alessandre in his arms for a tango? While emotional entanglements leave his brother confused - Sherlock has always been able to fake the beginning of a seduction with aplomb...or perhaps his brother just likes to dance. Alessandre pours them both two fingers of scotch from a decanter and presents a glass to Mycroft.
Alessandre smiles quizzically, then responds,”Well, Mycroft? Aren't you the British Government?  Seems like you ought to know the plan - ought to know this changes everything. Because I know that I'm not secure, not here nor in any of your safe houses. And we must work quickly.”
“Apologies, Dr. Watson”
“I see. So - were this...person’s attentions the reason for leaving your sixth clinical facility under cover of darkness?”
“Happy Christmas, James.”
Morning comes and John bolts awake from a nightmare: he is looking for Sherlock, who vanished in the mist. As he disappears, Moran emerges from the fog and begins to chase John towards the edge of a cliff.
“I’ll be there in 15 to pick you up. I’ve missed you, Jimmy.”
Sherlock comes to consciousness in a dark room with floors of compacted earth and stone. The window shows only the first glimmer of daylight, and the breeze carries the rank smells of low tide, but not the freshness of open ocean.
The first time John realised was at the Pool. Moriarty strapped John into his vest personally. Jim was such an innocent looking man, but he made John’s skin crawl. When he approached Sherlock, John did not stop to analyse his reaction - he wrapped his arms around Jim’s neck, ready to die to keep Sherlock safe. Later - Moriarty had gone, Sherlock thanked John for risking his life and John attempted to deflect from the sentiment that he feared would never be returned. He made a joke about Sherlock ripping his clothes off in a darkened pool. But, Moriarty was still listening, and he wasn’t pleased. That exchange was all it took - an infinitesimally small hint of John’s feelings for Sherlock and the potential that Sherlock might have feelings for John - and before John could stand, the sniper sights lit up their hearts.
come back. And when you do….”
“Wakey, wakey, Mr Holmes. You’ve napped quite long enough.”
“Mycroft,...”
John's first concert at Rainbow Corner, Jim returns to London.
John marches the slow road to recovery, Sherlock does not.
“Sir. The moving crew will arrive in the morning,” Anthea carefully pitches her sentence between a statement and question.
John laughs, “Yes, Mycroft - it did. I wanted to take comfort...to shelter from the storm with James, as we are both invalided - he would not let me. James reminded me that - as far as we knew - Sherlock was still out there, somewhere in the world,” John shakes his head, “James forced me to get well so that I could find him, even if Sherlock doesn’t feel the same - I need to hear it, from him. I didn’t simply ‘have a regard’ for your brother - I loved him...love him.”
“You will be the death of me - ok, yes, I’ll come. Whisht, now. First, we have to escape this WC and the rest of my platoon.”
Mycroft weighs his options quickly, “Yes, I believe you do.”
Thank you to everyone who has joined me on this historical WW2 AU journey (which now has one more chapter to its chapter count). Special thanks to Posh-Boy-Clever-Boy, who has gone beyond beta'ing into a bit of hand-holding and a**-kicking, as required, to bring this over the finish line.
Sherlock Holmes - in the original stories - was something of a master of disguise. So I resurrected that aspect of him to impersonate Winston Churchill to the man's driver.
“Read it. Aloud,” Sherlock flaps the well-worn envelope under Mycroft’s nose.
“You do. Yet you will not help me find him,” John meets Mycroft’s eyes; it is a statement, not a question.
Dr. Scott's return prompts Sherlock's jealousy to boil over, but John Watson is no one's whipping boy.
“James…”
“You have to hand it to Dr. Scott. Brilliant mathematician, gorgeous, she's apparently seduced your brother, and through all of the trauma of last night - she didn't seem thrown by any of it. Remarkably adaptable woman!”
Sherlock strips away John’s uniform, then his own. Their bodies slot together as though they were long-time lovers, their lips entwined, hands blindly grasping as they slowly rocked into each other - feeling pleasure build and crest again and again until dawn steals across their twisted sheets. In the early dawn hours, many promises are whispered - but there is nothing sure about life in war time. And both men know it.
“So you won’t tell Sherlock that I came,” John asks angrily.
“Very good, Mr Holmes, sir.”
“Which part of that sentence bothers you the most?” John asks with a small smile as he draws his dressing gown around himself. He turns towards the door to the flat, where a beautiful woman in a dark blue gown is standing next to a grave, unsmiling Mycroft Holmes.
Mycroft takes Alessandre up the back staircase to the private dining room at the Wolseley.
“Please, call me John”
-“But you haven't told me
Corporal Murray looks down into his rucksack at the large envelope. The address is incomplete - John had jotted down “Montague Street” in the margin but not the number. Murray thinks the name - Sherlock Holmes - is the genuine article. This is his only chance to send mail outside of the normal, monitored military channels. Capt Watson told him to let it go - but the longing and sadness in his face...well, Murray is a romantic, and even if he cannot have John Watson - he wishes his Captain well. There is no way on earth that Watson will be well without Sherlock Holmes, and Holmes is a right bastard if he can read John’s words and harden his heart. It’s a risk - but one well worth taking. Murray nods and shoves the parcel in the pillar box.
She slips through the Royal Festival Hall with surprising assurance, checking only once to be sure that Mycroft is there. Turning down a dark hallway, nodding to suited security guard who recognize her, she enters a private lounge and Mycroft follows.
Mycroft reaches into the secret compartment in his desk, extracting a packet of letters. He places them in front of Sherlock, “There is one other item - not sent by Capt Watson, but likely his Corporal Bill Murray - John’s journal. I’m not certain he intended you to see these - but Murray thought John had given up and this was his...response to save his friend.”
“Thank you - cobblestones and medieval pavers are murder in high heels.” Alessandre Scott  - the world renowned American mathematician - smiles teasingly up at Mycroft with perfect cupid bow lips, painted crimson.
“I was hoping you would be able to go a bit deeper, Irene.”
“Are you mad? I’m coming with you so your staff doesn’t dally getting those files.”
London during the blackouts is otherworldly. Few people are out, and those who are focus intensely on navigating the darkened streets. Illumination is transient - the occasional directional lantern and the headlamps of passing automobiles. John follows Sherlock’s certainty and unerring sense of direction. Several blocks away from Montague Street, they realise that nothing prevents them from holding hands.  No one would see it, and those who did might think that they were guiding each other. Their hands slip together, the furtive twining of fingers and palms is a potent messenger of desire, even when covered by shadow.
“Yes, I would have to say the same, Mycroft Holmes. Not what I expected at all.”
In the cab, an awkward silence descends on the men.
If I hear a melody
Their kiss continues, slowing and deepening. John strokes down over Sherlock’s chest, under his unbuttoned jacket. He pulls Sherlock’s hips against him, then slides his hands over Sherlock’s gorgeously plush arse.
“Soon, John. Goodnight.”
“I don’t think it would be safe, John.”
“Dunno, sir. I think this’ll put me off beach holidays permanently”, Corporal Murray starts as the LCA lowers into the water with a lurch.
“No, oh God, no... John! ” Sherlock pushes the door closed and slips the bolt.
James nods his head, “So, physio? Might as well have a nip off that flask then, Captain. Happy Christmas, John.”
James cocks his remaining eyebrow, “Let’s assume that I am right - then only one question remains, why are you loitering here? If my drill sergeant would have some strong words for me, so much more would yours, Watson.”
“I’ll put the new plan through General Strangeways - no sense in giving the game away, in case there is another double agent on the inside. That will work - the perfect diversion.”
“Then I think we should reserve you seeing all of me for when I’m fit to be seen. Let me take a bath, at least - my hair is filthy”, Sherlock speaks slowly, languidly. He can see that Moriarty has swallowed the bait - wanting to believe that Sherlock is preparing himself for Jim’s bed.
“You’re back. Irene is a bit far from her nursing training, it’s true. And again - I don’t know that she was ever working with pure, uncut heroin during her extended Florence Nightingale schtick”, Jim laughs. He plays with Sherlock’s lank, messy curls, “But as long as she didn’t kill you, I could wait - after all - from here on out, it’s you and me-eeee”, he sing-songs.
Told in all its glory
“I don’t want it”, Sherlock begins to strain against his bonds.
“Bathroom?”, Sherlock lurches up.
“I can't see the pattern yet, and I never guess. But there is….something.”
He leans back against the headrest and looks across to Sherlock, who appears to be focusing the full power of his attention on his phone. John sighs quietly - he thought he had inured himself to the constant ache of desire for his flatmate, but - much like his shoulder - small strains, the rub of overuse, even a change in the weather, and the old pain flares up again.
In the morning, Sherlock follows John through the flat as he bathes, shaves, drinks his tea...but finally, his departure cannot be delayed any longer.
I was trying to finish it all at once...then I decided that what might un-stick the last bit is to publish the penultimate bit. I do try to be real about the chapter counts, but if they aren't finished...what can one do?  They just aren't finished with me yet.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mycroft? Is this a
Sorry, we've gone so long without an update - but I haven't abandoned fic! Just...plot is so much harder than porn. :)
“As part of the plan that
“No. They won’t figure that bit, but I may have a bit of a reputation with the ladies - and after singing up on stage….well, I’d have to be blind not to pull someone, wouldn’t I?” John peers out from under his blonde lashes, and Sherlock can’t resist kissing him once more.
“John Watson NEEDS ME!”
Thanks for the kudos and comments (they keep me going) - I am considering making a Sherlock Holmes and John Watson AU series - Across Every Universe, because - for me - there isn't a universe where these two don't somehow fall in love (though, perhaps there are a few where they can't make it work).
“Fine!
“Ok. So we are keeping her, you...for how long?” John makes an effort to be polite.
“Come home with me? You are on a weekend leave, aren’t you? Do you have to stay on base?”
John and Sherlock both return to London. Time passes, and a chance meeting takes both men unawares.
“Perhaps not. Moran made a play for you - yet he knows who I am and he knows I’m on the staff of the Admiralty. The balance of probability suggests that Moran has been told to stand down with regard to me - which means a new player is about to enter the field.”
Mycroft nods, even though the lump in his throats makes it difficult.
“No, oh God, no...
“Then don't, not yet - I'll come.” Mycroft rings off.
“John! John Watson!”
“Corporal, get me that dressing kit? Looks like we will be here for a while - at least until first light.”
Mycroft has bought more time - but he fears it will not be nearly enough to extract his brother while the Normandy Invasion rages around them.
to tea. Anthea?”
“Sherlock - there is no leak. Not a single member of Andrew’s staff has anything so much as an overdue library book to be held over their head. I didn’t disagree with your deductions; so I bear the responsibility for this myself.”
“Well - you have many options, Mr Holmes - but every single one begins with my needle in your arm - so let’s begin”, Irene nods to Jeff, who holds Holmes' arm steady - and she injects the heroin. In a few moments, Holmes goes limp. The chauffeur bends to take his body to Moriarty.
“Sherlock.,” John’s voice carries a note of warning, “Professor - I take it you didn't bring pajamas to the opera?” John continues.
“Sherlock!”
The SOE was active in France prior to the Normandy invasion. Rommell was surprised by the invasion - but he presciently elected to increase the defences of the Normandy beaches - largely due to their resemblance the beachhead in Italy where the Allies began their re-invasion of Europe.
“Good. I’m not asking your forgiveness. Can’t - he said..., well, and I did it - and I’d do it again - I’m not sorry”, Moran’s breathing is becoming laboured, “...for you, it will be the same. Yours will use you up, then fuck off on his little soldier. Hell, maybe even Holmes will be with Jim -
Rommel did believe the fake Operation Fortitude plans - unfortunately - he also realized that the Normandy Beaches, where the D-Day Invasion did occur looked very much like the beaches in Salerno, where the Allies began their push into Italy - and so Normandy's invasion beaches were much better fortified than the Allies realised.
James snorts, then speaks in a low whisper, “You always turned my head, John. That has not changed, but I have.”
“Yours, Sherlock.”
“So - let’s make their worst nightmare appear to come true.”
“I can’t tell you everything...I shouldn’t tell you anything, really. But - this affects you, you are being drawn into it. I won’t allow you to come to harm because I left you in the dark.”
Both Sherlock and John receive their orders.
“Of course, Alessandre.”
Sherlock is pulled up short for a moment, panting against John’s neck. “Never, but this might make it hard for you - Moran’s your CO?”, John explores Sherlock’s neck with lips, teeth, and tongue. Sherlock cannot help but chase John’s lips with his own, even though it was Sherlock who pulled back out of their kiss.
This pulls Sherlock up short - he had pushed John out of his mind after seeing him leave Rainbow Corner, wrapped in Helen’s arms. “If he even goes to Montague Street, which I doubt, he has a key. When last I saw him, he was quite...taken up with Miss O’Connell.”
Sherlock smiles, “As long as you are up to inventing an Army, Brother mine. In the realm of simple chemistry, never forget that I’m the resident genius. It will certainly look like food poisoning. No one will be the wiser - least of all Wren Morstan.”
It's merely the way you sigh
Thanks for all the feedback so far - only a few more chapters left...though it seems that every chapter in the outline splits before being posted, so ...
John returns to his command. Sherlock meets to debrief with Mycroft at the Diogenes Club, though he is shockingly late for tea.
Sherlock sighs, tilting his head and considering, “An affectionate note to yourself...and your ‘overlords’. ‘Secretaries - they know everything’ - or so he said”.
“Tomorrow your orders will come through - you are moving up to Portsmouth. I don’t want you to be anywhere near Moran. Are you sure I can’t have you transferred? Mycroft..”
“The Landmark”
I rather think Sherlock would consider me something more like an enemy...archenemy if he feels the urge to be particularly dramatic.”
“Don’t make me cross, Cap’t. We’ve spoken often enough - do you much fancy moving in with your blessed sister? Because I don’t think this war would stand an expansion on the home front. But - judging from your letters and her visit - I give you one week before you try to re-enlist if you elect to live with Harriet.”
“So - reunited under the statues of Anteros yesterday, today you look at a flat together, am I to expect a happy announcement by the end of this week?”
“You have doubts.”
“All lives end, all hearts are broken. But even if they are, I’m still glad it was him...just like you with Jim”, Watson prepares another injection of morphine, Moran lifts his identity tags from his chest and presses them into Watson’s hands.
“That is what I cannot tell you - I wish I could, but…”
Of course, why would I need a bed in my own home?”-John speaks over Sherlock.
“Dammit, Watson. I will not see morning, and we both know it!”
Turns out - First Sea Lord at the time of Operation Overlord was Andrew Browne Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope, not Dudley Pound, so I need to backtrack and correct one of the earlier chapters that has Sherlock working for Pound.
This lovely fic prompt was going to be a quick song and dance, but I've found - much to my surprise - that there is a longer tale to tell about the planning of Operation Overlord, Sherlock the Spy, and Moran/Moriarty... So I do hope you will enjoy reading it as much as I have enjoyed researching it, listening to period playlists, and reviewing WWII history that I'd have otherwise forgotten.
Mycroft's eyebrows raise and Alessandre bites off her sentence and redirects.
John, ultimately fed up with the silent argument between the Holmes brothers, takes the bag off Anthea and turns to Alessandre.
“Sherlock”, Mycroft says, warningly.
John is surprised. He would've sworn that Mycroft has a reason for interest outside of the normal operations of government, but ‘love at first sight’ and Mycroft can barely reside within the same mind, let alone the same thought. Still, John does not fail to notice Alessadre’s stunning eyes.
“Of course, brother mine.”
“So you say….so you may even believe….so I thought, once too. But I was wrong, and so are you. Eh? You are...
“Yessir, they’re strapping lads - must barely keep them together”, Bill blushes as he stares at his supper, “Same with our Marines”.
“I think your sniper would have to repeat his course, and his shot was not a clean one”, Watson makes a note on the rough chart and goes to move away, but Moran stops him.
“For luck, John! Come along - we will walk. The Underground is a crowded madhouse since the Germans started with air raids. It’s not far to Montague Street.”
“John would make nothing of Victor Trevor because Trevor was nothing more than a distraction and a poor one at that,” Sherlock sneers.
“That’s a mighty concession when you are practically living on the streets.”
“Wait - this…this...
John’s eyes widen further, “yeah, right - Anthea? I'll go check then,”
Surely my own brother has the necessary intellectual wherewithal to carry out what should have been an exceedingly simple instruction,” Mycroft snaps.
Monday Morning - John and Sherlock, both in uniform, go out for a full English breakfast. To John’s surprise, Sherlock eats. They talk about little things - childhood, why John joined up after starting his medical training - Sherlock talks about some of his pre-war cases with the Yarders, and John can’t stop himself from calling Sherlock brilliant, perhaps more than once. Sherlock deduces that John has a younger brother, John admits a sibling with an air of mystery.
Alessandre smiles at Mycroft, “Hm. He is pretty good.”
And now? Look at you both - war widows.
“And your Aubusson?”
“You are right - I’ve given up and I have no right to do it. There are boys we left behind, Walcheren and Normandy - who would give anything to be here, no matter how ravaged. I know that...I know,” Major Sholto takes a deep breath, and attempts to continue - but he has run out of words.
“So you won’t tell Sherlock that I came,” John asks angrily.
“Tell me if I have it wrong.”
Overlord will take you days to sift through,” Mycroft considers for a moment, “That is likely Moriarty’s true plan. Take you out of the equation, on a wild goose chase - and exploit whatever pressure point he has uncovered with impunity. Elegant.”
Mycroft visits Gravesend RAF and receives some intel regarding Captain John Watson. John is caught up in a case of mistaken identity that could have costly consequences.
“No, he won’t’, John sniffs with rage, “..even if it isn’t me for him - for damn sure it’s not Moriarty. Not. Ever”.
“She can take Dr. Watson’s room - you two could share your bed if you intend to sleep at all, which I consider unlikely, since we are also bringing you a case.”
“I just changed the sheets…”’
“You may not believe me, but yes, I would.”
the closing number, through the wall. John pulls away, trailing his hand over Sherlock's jawline.
“Jesus, Holmes - I don’t either, but we must stop. This isn’t where...oh, do that again....this isn’t the right time or place for all I want to do with you. Not to mention, the loo is going to be overrun with servicemen when this song ends.”
After breakfast, they walk through Regent’s Park - Sherlock takes a seat on an out-of-way park bench and John sits next to him.
, he calls it...needs an audience of its peers…”.
Not for one moment is Mycroft ever bored.
“James,” John whispers, leaning against his major’s pillow, “There is no need to pretend any longer. We - neither of us - is going to be any earthly good to the Army. I’m a surgeon with nerve damaged dominant hand, and you won’t even get out of bed for basic physio. If I were your drill sergeant, I’d have taken a crupper to you by now. You best thank your lucky stars that the Matron has taken a particular shine to you.”
“Symphony.” Sherlock corrects John.
“Obvious. So - you have returned to London, and instructed Anthea to move your belongings to a flat on Baker Street - when I think you know that, without reasonable assurance from a man of medicine - that you are fit for service, I will simply remand you into institutional care...again.”
“No - not a wild goose chase - something John said to me about..
After a moment, John breaks their silence, “So - this is the last time for a long while - we ought to make it...good. Send your soldier away with something to keep him warm?”
“Watson...John, I saw you the night you returned from your last leave. If you were ever that in love with me, you hid it with all you have. And I rather suspect you will love him for as long as he is still in the world. I don’t...I am not good with sentimental nonsense, John. But I am not blind,” James pats John’s shoulder in a fraternal way.
“No. But the Holmes brothers’ constant squabbling is starting to do so.”, Alessandre stretches like a cat.
“Sir? Message from Gravesend.”
Her family, in a burst of liberality between the wars, allowed her train as a nurse in London. Her sensibilities led her to rouge her knees; her beauty and love of danger drove her into the path of Jim Moriarty. But instead of prostituting Irene, Jim realised that her intellect would serve him far better as a madam, a dominatrix. Irene possessed an uncanny ability to observe and discern anyone's darkest desire or fondest wish.
The men crowd the foredeck of the SS Victoria and HMS Princess Josephine Charlotte. Their faces are blackened with Pond’s Cream; still, no one speaks. It is difficult to discern much in the pre-dawn fog as the ships of the Operation Neptune armada roll silently at anchor, miles out to sea.
“And you can just arrange food poisoning?”
“Tell me if I have it wrong.”
“This is the field hospital?”, Corporal Murray looks around at the house, “Was it cleared?”
“So, you said we would talk...I still want to help, if I can.”
“And that wasn’t
Sherlock wakes to a sad song in a thready Irish tenor.
“Why Mycroft, you utter romantic.”
“Well - That’s part of the problem, isn’t it? (
Mycroft  rubs away the frown from between his brows. There is no one on Admiral Cunningham’s staff that could be called into question. Sherlock must be wrong - admittedly, a rare occurrence  -  but not an impossible one. Mycroft considers whether it would be better to shelve the Overlord plans or deal with the fallout of withholding intelligence. It’s a horrible decision to make - and pointless either way - sort of like choosing the calibre of the bullet for your own firing squad. As Mycroft ponders, Sherlock hurtles through the door.
(See the end of the chapter for
Mycroft and Alessandre slide into the back of Mycroft’s town car. Mycroft speaks first.
“You are sure that is the reason? It's not just coincidence that she was with him? Or linked to her arrival in London versus Oxford?”
“Yours, Sherlock.”
nursing, John.”
I have no beta - so feel free to tell me if there is anything egregiously wrong and in need of editing.  Cheers!
Sherlock comes to consciousness in a dark room with floors of compacted earth and stone. The window shows only the first glimmer of daylight, and the breeze carries the rank smells of low tide, but not the freshness of open ocean.
He proposes lunch in the (closed to the public) Members Room. Alessandre slips away for a moment while Mycroft tries to get his emotions under control. He doesn’t have this luxury. Attraction is all well and good, but Mycroft Holmes is definitely not breathless and never out of control. He wonders if Alessandre feels anything at all for him. Sometimes the way she looks at him - like she is waiting for him to declare himself as he did at the Symphony, like a cat watching a mousehole. Mycroft is never the focus of attention, and Alessandre’s attention is blinding, sharp and addictive.
John is wide-eyed - first name basis? Even the Prime Minister calls him Mr. Holmes.
“Mr Holmes, Sir! Message from Admiral Cunningham’s office, his secretary has been badly beaten, by her husband. She’s in hospital.”
“On the contrary, brother mine - planning is advanced. Not many know exactly what Overlord is, but the fact of it? The list of people who
“Do you object?”
was for me.  Are there dreams I could make come true, for you?”
“Professor, if you would come with me, I'll get you sorted.”
“And yet, here we are,” Mycroft examines John thoroughly as John tries to look past Mycroft into the flat, “He isn’t here, Captain.”
The car pulls away from the kerb, and starts its journey back to London.
The black sedan rolls quietly down High Street, reflecting street lights and illuminating the fog that follows the rain on a cold October evening. It stops in front of an unassuming section of a wall in the old college - by a dark wooden door. A tall man unfolds himself and his umbrella from the back seat and knocks twice. The porter looks surprised - “Good evening, Mr. Holmes. Will you be dining in college tonight, Sir?”
Sherlock stares, speechless, as John’s stare snaps between Sherlock and the needle in his hand.
Didja miss me? :)
“Why?”
“I want him conscious. Then I want him begging.”
Mycroft expression is politely incredulous, “You cannot mean to tell me that Sherlock’s excessive regard for you has escaped your notice? A regard that I thought you returned.”
“Mr Holmes, your brother indicated a different address,” Anthea hedges, “221B Baker Street, London.”
Alessandra’s mind is agile - spinning connections between broad topics and drawing conclusions with relentless logic. Mycroft talks more than he has in months; he finally has empathy for Sherlock’s marked tendency to show off when she applauds his logic or says, with her polished slight Brahmin accent, ‘Yes, brilliant.” By the time coffee is offered (she takes a double espresso, no desert), Mycroft almost volunteers such confidential tidbits as his mother's identity.
“When I saw you with Moran, I thought I’d missed my chance.”
Piss off. - SH
I know.  The Chapter Count Has Risen! I'd promise it's the last time, but I'd hate to lie inadvertently. The boys just need enough words to get them through. Not much more to go - promise.
“The scars on the outside are enough to fright the birds off their branches - but I’m not so vain as all that. But - I’ve only ever been a soldier, and - truth be told - I am not entirely sure how to fit back into a world where nobody is calling me Major,” James shakes his head.
December came and went before John woke to Nurse Holloway bearing discharge paperwork. John worked earnestly with his therapists after his talk with Major Sholto, but to say his heart wasn’t in it was an understatement.
“No. Ah, Moran is...persistent. But, rest assured Capt. Watson, I could not see anyone else in the whole of London after you sang to me. You...you were singing to me, weren’t you?”, John looks into Sherlock’s eyes - his expression is amused and ridiculously fond.
Sherlock abandons intelligence gathering with Moran and makes his way down onto the dance floor. He sees John return, the conquering hero, to the table where his men have gathered. Other well-wishers (mostly British or female or both) are winding their way to congratulate him. He has a pretty brunette hanging off of his elbow, and Corporal Douglass patting his arm. Sherlock is about to abandon hope of coming anywhere near him, when John politely breaks for the loo. Sherlock follows.
Much love for the comments, it keeps me going when these characters refuse to speak.
John replaces his cap, while Sherlock buttons up and sets his hat at a rakish angle. John reaches over, straightening it with military precision.
“No, no. I am a soldier. I get orders and I march. We don’t ever get to ask ‘why’ - I understand that. Just….are you going to be….seducing Moran?”
“It puts us no closer to revealing the leak, Sherlock.”
“Thank you, Dr. Watson. Goodnight, Mr. Holmes. Mycroft.”
“Really, Mycroft. I could have assassinated you ten different ways, eleven if you count poisoning your mediocre-yet-ancient whiskey,” Sherlock drawls.
“It could be,” Mycroft hedges.
The moorings creak as the soldiers board their landing craft. The barrage has started - it is almost impossible to talk now, over the whistle of torpedoes and rat-tat-tat of ceaseless machine gun fire. John and Bill are going out with A Troop.
“Quite. Well, I can have my agents make discreet inquiries amongst the clerical staff - not that I think there is much future in it. If Moriarty has a source and revealed it to you, no doubt the first place to look for that person is the bottom of the Thames.”
“Not a code breaker - but codes are math, so it's not beyond my powers. I'm not sure about anybody's interest, moreover-I doubt it is relevant.”
Sherlock was making halting progress with the seduction of Sebastian Moran when he first noticed John on the dance floor with that woman.  Their two blonde heads close together, John blushed as prettily as any girl and Sherlock lost the thread of his flirtation with Moran.
If my previous letters’ tone is what gives you pause, rest assured that I only wish to know you are safe and well - I will make no other claims on your...time.
“We can have her arrested before she has time to brew his tea.”
“Where is he, Mycroft? How could you have kept this from me?”
Irene laughs, without humour, “My dear boy - it’s immaterial to me. Jim wants you - and he will have you. Consider me your angel of mercy - at least this part, you enjoy.”
“Turning your head seems like a promising start, James,” John moves closer.
“Balance of probability, brother.”

As any fic author will tell you, I <3 Comments!
“Well, Mycroft. You brought him here, you didn’t shoot him - so I assume we are not going to behave as though he’s a child from whom the biscuit tin ought to be hidden.”
“Then perhaps for the remainder of the evening, you could call me Alessandre?” She fixes Mycroft with a look that is both veiled and analytical.  Blue eyes then, Mycroft decides  - exceptionally dark blue - for a moment, they recall the steady gaze of his brother’s companion, Dr. John Watson.
“I have another plan that might keep you safe until we can secure you. It will mean staying on in London for a bit, are you willing?”
“Her Majesty’s Foreign Office would like to  extend its official welcome, Professor. I hope you don’t mind, I took the liberty of planning a quick dinner before the concert? Just the two of us - nothing formal?”
Mycroft smirked, “I strongly suspect Anthea would object to your analogy on many levels, and she probably knows the First Sea Lord’s diary better than Andrew, but I take your general point. Not every aide-de-camp is Anthea”.
“I am dying, Captain - and you have no where you need to be”, Moran speaks slowly, it is costing him a great effort to continue.
John wonders if his Corporal is still pining. Bill never questioned his new assignment, and John never told him. It comforted John - even though the worst may come - that Bill knew him and he knew Bill, even those things they were often forced to hide. Bill catches John’s gaze; John ruffles his hair affectionately as they stand and move off towards the compartment where they will try to sleep.
“Are you ready? This is where it gets….interesting. Oh - and will you tell your brother? Ah...Sherlock - Sherlock, I won’t even ask ‘did you miss me?’ - because I already know, I’ve always known - you miss me, no one else ever came close, did they? I’ll save you from the painfully ordinary,...my dear.”  (New Edits to This Chapter)
“John.”
“I work for the..Admiralty. I’ve a flat near the British Museum. Come. You can’t leave me like this.” Sherlock’s smile is equal parts debauched and wicked. John already feels the impossibility of saying no to this remarkable man.
“I’ll have Colton prepare your room, if you truly think it’s necessary.”
John stretches and flexes his left hand, nods sharply and executes an about-face and steps away. Before he’s taken more than three paces, he stops without turning back to Mycroft, “If he still feels something for me, as you say he did...then he needs me to heal, just as I need him. If you are keeping me from him, he will never forgive you once I find him. And I will find him, Mycroft,” John squares his shoulders, and walks away - never looking back.
“I need to finish what I started with Mycroft...but I will come tomorrow night. And...will you stay at Montague Street tonight?  Even if I cannot come home - I want to know that you are there.”
Moran’s shoulder is hit - but not cleanly. Fragments of splintered bone cannot be resected in the crude field hospital - but Watson has done what he could to stanch the bleeding. 2nd Devon took some of the less wounded soldiers for transport back home, but Moran was deemed insufficiently stable for transport.
“Well, then...Yes, Captain.”
Needed to re-work the story a bit, especially the ending - so publishing this chapter again.
“You would think that the people of Gravesend would turn to God, what with the Luftwaffe bombing the local RAF airstrip with alarming regularity - but here we are - alone in the chapel”
So  - John finds himself in Tottenham Court Road, limping along towards the British Museum. He seems completely unconscious of where his legs lead him until he is standing outside of Sherlock’s door.
“Sherlock - enlighten me,” Mycroft leans back in his chair, withdrawing a cigarette from the silver case in his breast pocket and tapping the case closed. “Captain Watson does not desire a return to London if it means staying with his alcohol-addicted sister. What might he say to your collapsing veins and nodding head?” Sherlock slows and faces his brother.
“You still aren’t afraid of me.”
Another April evening and John limps away from his room near Speaker’s Corner. A recent raid demolished part of the hotel lobby - but the lobby was not part of the structural foundation of the actual hotel, and John accepts the broken glass and rubble if it means there is still a roof over his head.
“Made you look,” John smiles flirtatiously.
Sebastian Moran these days?”
James pulls himself together first, “That’s enough, Captain. At any rate, John - I rather thought you fancied Navy whites nowadays?”
“James - it isn’t as though there is aught for me on the outside, either. I can’t sew anyone up with these hands,” John thrusts his shaking hands under James' nose. John pauses, thinking, “It’s all well to judge, isn’t it? That’s what you are telling me.”
“Timing is unfortunate. Mycroft, there should have been two guards at these doors - there was only one. The Americans should have put a tail on your car the moment we left All Souls, but I could not detect one. There was a face - busboy, I think - that I later saw in an adjoining box in the theatre. I'm afraid I need to ask for help-but I’m not entirely convinced that the MI6 hasn't been compromised.”
“Dr. Watson,...John...It's been a long day, I would love nothing more than to fall into that bed.
Sherlock frowns, then the fog lifts and he smiles broadly, “On the contrary, Mycroft. Moriarty clearly wants us to ‘clean up’ after him. He implicates the secretary and we try him or her for treason. But the secretary would have to be close to the actual pressure point, otherwise their value as a leading indicator would be limited. Don’t you see! Your Anthea would see increased volume in
“Well - then a Christmas miracle,” John squares his shoulders.
I admit, I was seduced away by the Call Me By Your Name fandom for a little while. I also had some ideas for how I would re-write this entire thing which made it difficult to face - but I decided that I spent too much time researching WW2 to leave this in a lurch, so I will complete the story.  Perhaps no one cares but me - but that is what makes fanfic so glorious: I am really the only one who needs to care at all.
“Alive. John was wounded - but he is alive,” Sherlock’s tone holds a question.
“Nine hours, 30 minutes, give or take - he picked me up around 4 pm”
John wanted Sherlock from their first dinner at Angelo’s, but Sherlock said “married to his work”, and Captain Watson stood down. He spent the next several months tagging along on cases, trying to get his bearings in civilian London, and systematically ignoring any flicker of interest in Sherlock Holmes. Lust is well and good when it is reciprocal - and best ignored when it is not. He sought out girlfriends, and focused on being a friend to his often infuriating but always interesting flatmate. John was so focused on sifting out any thread of desire, that love slipped in, unnoticed.
“And I’m sure you would tell me the unvarnished truth regarding his whereabouts - again, given past history”
The world may know the sentimental story
The moorings creak as the soldiers board their landing craft. The barrage has started - it is almost impossible to talk now, over the whistle of torpedoes and rat-tat-tat of ceaseless machine gun fire. John and Bill are going out with A Troop.
“So, what have you told your parents about the ‘girl you’re bringing home’?”
Not this time, brother mine. Arriving at Baker Street now - do put on some clothes - I'm bringing a guest. -M
John’s mouth opens several times, but no sound emerges.
Sherlock huffs and snaps to attention.
Sherlock walks down Shaftesbury Ave, in less than two blocks, the navy limousine pulls next to him. Silently, Sherlock climbs into Mycroft’s car to make his report. Mycroft’s frown, a masterpiece of its kind, deepens - Sherlock leans his forehead against the window.
“What's that?”
“I...John.”
“Dr. Watson, Mr. Holmes, I'm afraid this is my fault.”
“Oh God, yes” John removes Sherlock’s hat, handing it to him. In that moment’s distraction, he flips Sherlock against the tiles, pressing the length of their bodies together, tangling one hand in Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock gasps as John murmurs, “You are doing that right now. Just...yes, right there...oh!”
“And you have a suspicion as to who.” John does not state this as a question.
Funny, each time I fall in love
“They say that there were hundreds of tunnels that sailors would escape through to avoid conscription aboard a Royal Navy vessel. Romantic, isn’t it? Always better in theory than in practice, I’ve found. Rats, you see. Absolutely everywhere - enough for one to abandon each of those sinking ships in the Channel. Don’t worry - Jeff won’t put you down - they look hungry.”
“I assure you..”Mycroft looks panicked.
“Mycroft - this is insufferable. I don't keep clients in the linens cupboard. Where will she even sleep?”
It is nearly midnight when Mycroft turns the key to his tastefully lavish home on Avenue Road in St Johns Wood. He passes through the reception hall into his study, making a beeline for the bar cart. Mycroft pours a measure of scotch into his glass, then sighs and adds a second finger. Only after his first sip does he notice that one of the snifters is missing.
Sherlock loses a bit more time - drifting in and out of consciousness as he is borne along down the passageway. A change in the incline and they arrive at a bolted door - the wood is so dirty and worn away that it is difficult to perceive the change in the wall. Moriarty dangles a key in front of Sherlock, then snatches it away - unlocking the door with a theatrical flourish.
“We won’t be disturbed here.”
“I thought you might enjoy the Japanese gallery, so I took the liberty of closing it to visitors so we could tour.”
“How so?”
John rubs the back of his neck ruefully, “I reckon they’ll guess I found someone to take me home...or something.”
“Hmmm?”
“Of course, you idiot.”
Locked away once more in the flat on Montague Street, John undresses Sherlock with the care of a surgeon tending a wound, until Sherlock impatiently rips at his dress shirt.
“Sure, Sherly - just through there”, Jim gestures towards a former dressing room that has only recently installed indoor plumbing. Inside there is a toilet, a sink, and a claw-footed bath that makes Sherlock itch with longing. He tries to close the door, but Jim stops him, “No telling what you would get up to in here unsupervised”, Jim leers.
“We have intel that he is...or shortly will be….in London.”
“Arrange my affairs? Is it that terminal, Nurse Holloway?” John huffs.
Sherlock reports back to Mycroft, and shies away from sentiment.
Yours, John”
John stretches and flexes his left hand, nods sharply and executes an about-face and steps away. Before he’s taken more than three paces, he stops without turning back to Mycroft, “If he still feels something for me, as you say he did...then he needs me to heal, just as I need him. If you are keeping me from him, he will never forgive you once I find him. And I will find him, Mycroft,” John squares his shoulders, and walks away - never looking back.
Geek Minutiae:
John POV, thinking of Sherlock and Moriarty.
Mycroft stifles a sigh of exasperation, and begins, “Dear Sherlock - I hope my letter finds you well. It has been many months since we last spoke, but the thought of our handful of days in London has been my only consolation as I struggle to recover, in both body and mind.
John is incensed - but he catches a look in the colonel’s eyes that causes his anger to crack open and drain away. Moran is scared - if anything, he wishes John would put him out of his misery, instead of waiting for death or transport. He thinks back to something Mycroft once said.
Irene would always owe a debt to James Moriarty - for her start in business, her initial contacts, and her freedom when Jim was being dragged into investigations. When Jim returned to England, he had no compunction on calling in that debt - both for a base of operations and later - for Sherlock Holmes. Leaving Holmes in the ramshackle kitchen, Jim and Irene retreat to the lounge to discuss tactics. Jim is confident he will prevail - Irene always can tell what someone likes.
“Johnny, our call is in 15 minutes.”
It’s Colonel Moran.
“Mycroft! Mycroft is ‘arriving momentarily’ in our flat, guest in tow, with a case for us. He implied I should wear clothes.” Sherlock finishes, petulantly.
“Major James Sholto - your Major, also your former lover - did that play a role in your motivations, I wonder?”

I don't know what to say about this chapter other than "It's Over". I've cheated on Across Every Universe with CMBYN fandom (and more recently - a wee dalliance with SKAM Italia) - I've wanted to re-write the whole thing (except for the songfic in the start). I've done some amazing research that might make this into a real novel one day (totally different throughout the middle - but it was only once I got John invading France that I realized the huge, historically accurate opportunity I missed with the SOE and D-Day spying. It might be nice to have the protagonists in the same country for the entire middle bit, until snipers and fate intercede, for example.
Sherlock knows that tone will brook no argument, and so he yields. He stands in front of John - the air is heavy with the weight of all that remains unsaid between them - and memorises every line of John Watson’s face.
“He is.  Well, I’m in his command. I’ve been sheltered from his..ah...attentions by my Major. Will you be...Oh! No wait…Holmes...Sherlock.” John cups Sherlock’s jaw with both hands and forces him to meet his eyes, “The way you two were looking at each other...will I be getting in the middle of something?”
“We really must be in for it, when is the last time we had this much food?”, Bill asks around a full mouth.
Mycroft sends several texts.
Alessandre’s glances comprehensively at Mycroft’s tuxedo and her evening gown, gloves and cape and widens her eyes slightly.
“Steady on…”
John takes a deep breath as he runs his hands over his face. Both Sherlock and John are surprised by a voice behind their bench, “Nicely done, Lieutenant. Shall we take your little Captain away to be shot for treason, or will you just leave him to Moran?”
Mycroft Holmes does not look up from his paper at his desk in the Diogenes Club’s Strangers Room, “Close the door, Harrow - then read it out.”
John and Alessandre head upstairs, leaving Mycroft glaring at Sherlock.
John and Sherlock pretend nothing happened, Mycroft confronts his brother about sentiment, while confessing his own. An unexpected package will disrupt all plans.
Sherlock and John meet again and finally talk.
“Thank you.”
“Stop being tedious, Mycroft...”, Sherlock talks over John, affecting bored displeasure.
Sherlock can feel the itching under his skin, but the hands in his hair are just lovely. All of the clamouring voices in his head are blissfully silent - he is floating on the edges of a heroin rush. It takes some minutes for him to realize he isn’t wearing the Royal Navy uniform anymore - just some silken pajama pants. There is a flicker at the back of his brain - like a snippet of a silent film reel - that tells him this should concern him, but - like everything else - it slips away. Hands caress his hair, trace over his cheekbones, and down across his chest. He closes his eyes and gives himself over to the sensation, imagining that John is with him, the war is over and they lay on a blanket under the elm tree that stands alone - some meters in front of the wooded copse of the Holmes country pile. The dream is a good one, but reality keeps bleeding through - the scent of the brackish water of the Thames, instead of cut hay, dark hair, not blonde hovering over his chest, the fingers that touch him do not have the finesse of his surgeon-soldier. This last pulls Sherlock back from his pleasant reverie. John. John is invading France - he could be dead - this is not John. This realization doesn’t ache as it should - heroin, again - but it steadies Sherlock enough to try to break free.
“Ah, come now, Billy- they never guess”, Watson tightens his pack and jumps down into the LCA which will bring them into the JIG Green sector of Gold Beach.
James says nothing and turns away.
“Sherlock, this is why I fight. I won’t leave my men, I won’t abandon my post because it’s become dangerous - I signed up for dangerous. Moran has a war to win - he can’t afford to nurse personal grudges.”
“Will do, Corporal - 2nd Devon should catch up soon enough - we can hand off some of the injured - then I’ll try to…incoming”, Watson and Murray look up - several stretcher-bearers trot into the RAP. Capt. Watson instantly begins triage, until the man on the third stretcher pulls him up short.
“JOHN!” Sherlock is pacing the living room, wrapped only in a sheet.
“Unfortunately,...”
“I’ve been in hospital - couldn’t walk for months, still need this awful…,” John gesture to his cane, then stares down Mycroft with the full ‘Captain Watson’ glare, “Look, I was shot - nearly killed - in France. I was bleeding out, but all I could think was, ‘Please God let me live’...and that was down to him, really. Since I’ve been back, I regretted that prayer - it’s shameful, but it is also true...also down to him. It took a dressing down from my Major to get me to pay even the slightest attention to my physio….”
Bill stretches down from the upper bunk to touch John’s shoulder, “Sing us a song, then?”. He turns to stare at the ceiling as John quietly sings “White Cliffs of Dover” as though it were a lullaby.
Tuesday rolls into Wednesday, then Thursday night, and John has not seen Sherlock or the American GI he absconded with at the club since Monday night. John waited until closing on Tuesday, hoping that Sherlock would appear in his dressing room so they could speak, but to no avail. Wednesday, John plucked up his courage to go to Sherlock’s flat on Montague Street, but there was no sign that Sherlock had been in since they left together on Monday. John waited as long as he could, then hurried Rainbow Corner so he had time to dress for the evening performance.
“No. John - there was a time when I would have thanked God to hear you say such things, but not now - not when I cannot offer you a whole man.”
“Mycroft.” Alessandre takes a breath, “That is an entirely different unsafe scenario.”
As always - the kudos and comments give me life - and get me back here, writing - just that much faster, so thank you!!!
“Given our last encounter, I can hardly expect that it is possible to surprise you, Mycroft.”
“But someone is after you - if not for what you do….is it somehow for who you are?  What then?”, in the silence that ensues, John retrenches, “So - how long have you known Mycroft?”
"Oh for pity's sake Mycroft - John said he always knew when his platoon would be moving up;
“Of course. You are right. It’s just that….I will miss you.”
“You said ‘may be’...what evidence did he provide that he had done as he implied?”
Thank you for your continued interest - and many thanks to Posh-Boy-Clever-Boy, my awesome beta.
“Mycroft doesn't know what to do.”
“Get some rest, Bill. It’s trite enough to say it, but tomorrow is a big day.”
Sherlock hangs his head but accepts the wisdom of Mycroft’s words. He picks up the letter, examining it for the thousandth time,“This was written in November - it implies there were others. Where?”
John steps up behind her and slides the zipper down - exposing her marble white shoulders to the small of her back. John swallows as his fingers graze her skin accidentally. He realizes this is more than a bit not good, bids her goodnight and hastily retreats to the living room where a different set of alabaster shoulders await him.
“Are you...glad? I think maybe….I’m not. Jim is a great man, I never asked...if he was..a good one. But maybe yours...still could be...”, Moran is drifting now.
Sherlock reverently places the hat on John’s head; John straightens it - and with a quick salute, shoulders his bag and returns to his battalion, his men, and his orders to move up with the 2nd Army to Portsmouth.
“Just one, Mary Morstan.”
“Sherlock - this is NOT a game. This is...the end of a world war, countless lives…”
Sherlock slides his mouth against John’s, “
Sherlock pushes his revulsion down, “That depends,...did we..?”.
“Get me all of the personnel files - anyone who might have had clerical access to the plans, or even could have overheard the codename. Surely security isn’t so lax that it’s a lengthy list?”
“So this is it. I won’t say goodbye - but only, ‘see you later’...can I write to you?”
find you”.
“It’s a sight better defended than the HC boys guessed, innit?”, Bill grouses.
“...Is ‘prepared for martyrdom, though I preferred that it be postponed’, “ Mycroft and Sherlock share a quiet laugh.
“I think I saw ice cream? It’s the Americans - they are hard on feed, didn’t you notice?”, John tucks into his plate - the last time he had eaten so well, a certain Naval Lieutenant was his only messmate. If it is possible to chew pensively, John Watson does.
“Him? Of course, I know what he likes”, Irene’s heels click across the parquet, as she opens a drawer of the desk with a magician’s flourish. She brandishes a needle, “Heroin”.
“Sherlock - if Watson is recovering himself, he hardly needs…”
Sherlock, slowly, “That's true, isn't it? Not phased in the slightest. Almost…”, Sherlock picks up his mobile to call Mycroft but it is already ringing.
