And yet, nothing compared to what Steve was trying so hard to ignore right now. His erection hadn’t gone down. Not since he had first smelled Tony. Not while he carried him to Happy, not while he argued with Pepper that, no Steve would go to the tower along with them and he wasn't leaving until he got an explanation. He had blushed when Pepper had glanced pointedly to the front of his trousers but he wouldn’t budge. His balls hurt, and he couldn’t sit comfortably, the images of what Tony must look like right this moment constantly playing various scenarios on the back of his consciousness, but he stayed.
It took another minute before Tony replied but when he did, his heart rate had gone down. First, he sat back, looking at the floor between their knees, then he breathed deep, visibly preparing himself for something.
That was awfully close to dangerous hypothermia. Steve realized Tony had been trying to keep his heat at bay. A spectacularly stupid move for a genius, considering slightly elevated temperature had nothing to do with sexual arousal during a heat period. The name was metaphorical. Steve supposed Tony wasn’t thinking clearly at the moment.
"Yes sweetheart, I'll take care of you." The dom replied close to his ear and there was a kiss pressed to his temple. Then the fingers really started pumping.
She shook her head. “It is a little funny. I’m sorry. Tony, Steve is an old fashioned guy. He wouldn’t go for a horde or even two omegas. And I know for a fact that he isn’t seeing anyone.”
"Yes, Steve." The name felt weird, too familiar. Maybe that was exactly what Rogers was going for. What Steve was going for.
"Really?" Tony asked before he could stop himself and Steve put a hand on his shoulder and said with a smile,
Suddenly Steve understood what Tony was doing. Tony was both gathering information by making the junior agents talk about the organization and their missions, and he was flirting with anything that wasn’t an alpha. Living up to his reputation all the while he was sneaking peeks at what Steve and Pepper wouldn’t tell him.
He had tried hard today. It had been difficult to be so casual about it. But his heart had raced when Steve had slid into the elevator. And most shameful of all, Tony had expected, for a moment, Steve to push him up against the wall, hold him down and… He didn’t know what but for a split second he had wanted it.
And it had been maddening, having Steve lay him down, unbutton his shirt and touch Tony’s body with his big, warm hands, keeping him on the floor with his gentle grip, exploring him. Tony had been able to smell Steve’s arousal then, how much the alpha wanted him but Steve had gone no further than putting his lips and teeth to Tony’s skin.
"I was surprised to hear you were collared." Tony gave him a look, before leaving to drop the bags in his room.  "You never mentioned it before." he half yelled through the coridor.
The Captain turned to move around the house and not knowing what to do Tony sort of followed him. When Rogers seemed to be satisfied that everything was settled, he sat on an old fashioned, dark brown leather couch and gestured Tony close.
“What!? Pepper no!” Steve realized he was yelling suddenly then lowered his voice, “I didn’t fucking force him, damn it!”
Steve didn’t think. The heavy, industrial strength steel lid of a 21st century dumpster hit one squarly in the face and torso, knocking him down with a sickening crunch but Steve didn’t stop to look where the body landed. He had already closed the distance between the crouching thug and the dumpster he had ripped the lip off, and grabbed the second one by the nape of his neck. A single punch was enough to knock him out and Steve threw the unconscious body onto the ground, away from Tony’s prone form.
“…but the order had already been given. You told Nat to keep the portal open. It was very clever really. Brave and selfless too. When you disappeared into the worm hole they say…”
Tony shrugged. “The guy leaves an impression.” He said and flashed Steve such a smile that Steve felt himself blush a little. Pepper rolled her eyes.
"Please. Honey bear?" He asked with a timid but tentatively teasing smile. "For me. I promise we'll go on all the dates we've missed and I'll not call you, then bitch about the last time you were on whatsapp. The whole shebang. I'm yours anyway." He paused to let his last words sink in for a moment. "I know I can trust you."
“But he’s such an amazing guy. I can’t think of a reason why we couldn’t get along. Maybe he turned me down and I didn’t tell you.”
The end:) Thank you very much for reading! And hugs to everyone who patiently stuck with me even when I haven't been a good girl.. I know this fic has its strengths and weaknesses,  but no matter how it turned out I had huge fun writing it. I hope it managed to entertain you too, at least sometimes. I don't think I can ever have enough of alpha!dom!Steve or omega!sub!Tony. So this is my attempt at writing them, for better or for worse. There might be fixes or additions in the future, but for now, this is it:)
For a moment Tony stood there, bereft in his own home, just looking at Steve. Steve knew he was waiting for something, really anything would do.
"If you wanna know the truth... " he started, "I still a had a poster of you on my wall when I started to present. I left it behind when I left for MIT." He gave the head of Steve's penis a lick and Steve's hips shifted impatiently.
"That bitch." Happy muttered but Pepper huffed and waved a hand, "Reporters. It's not an unexpected question." She said.
Tony stopped trying to look around and dropped his head in defeat. Of course, Steve wasn't after embarrassing photos. He was just really into making Tony do as he said.
Rhodey's teeth rattled in his head as Steve shook him, he could feel the other alphas hands trying to pry Steve's away from his shirt where the super soldier was holding the colonel off the ground.
"It's my wedding. I'll drink if I want to." Tony answered but he went boneless against Steve's chest when the alpha wrapped his arms around him. They stood like that for a moment until Tony snorted into Steve's chest.
"Sure why not. But that's not the point. The point is I'm much less of a mess now than I'd been after Loki. It did help me come to terms with some stuff that fucked me up pretty badly. All I'm saying is give it a chance. You could do a lot worse than Cap there. If I know anything about the guy he'd be trying very hard. He's all good intentions and ridiculous decency. If you're ever gonna trust anyone with your submission why not give it a try with him?"
“An asshole you mean?” Tony had asked and Pepper had answered, “That’s a Tony Stark trait, not an alpha trait. I don’t think you’ll have a problem with that.” Tony had pouted and Steve had laughed.
The big hand gently caressed his bottom from his lowerback to the back of his thighs as the captain spoke. It was sort of hard to pay attention, Tony was sure Steve had been very diligent about keeping tally anyway. Not like he was going to protest. 14 didn't sound that bad either. He'd taken way worse.
"Don't be dramatic honey bear. I didn't run away, I just went out to, you know, handle some business and," he shook the box he was holding up a little, "to buy you a ring. By the way if you say yes I get to call you honey bear right?" Tony smiled but his humor was slipping away fast each moment Steve delayed giving an answer.
He rounded the last corner at full speed and was hit in the face by the completely undiluted scent of an omega in heat. Times ten. He reeled for a moment,  trying to collect his thoughts enough to proccess the image before him. Two common thugs had Tony on the floor, one held his tie like a leash with a foot between his shoulderblades as Tony laid face down, the other was trying to avoid getting kicked in the face while he tried to rip the expensive suit pants off him.
"Uhm.." Tony started again, unwilling to interrupt but it only made sense to remind his dom, "I could give you a blow job?" His eyes flicked up to Steve's face, only to find the captains eyes closed, his lips slightly open.. His wet eyelashed looked thick even through the stall door, Tony thought he looked like the dirtiest, most sublime wet dream he could ever hope to have. "The uh.. The no gag reflex thing? Remember? I could make it really good."
The men were armed, two of them holding the suit by the arms and legs, clearly still struggling to lift it, since the suit weighed almost 250lbs. One overseeing them while watching Tony attentively to see if he would wake up, others keeping guard. The one that was watching Tony had a rifle loosely trained towards Tony’s face. Of course. They didn’t know if the suit was dormant because of the damage or because the operator was unconscious. They were afraid that Tony might wake up any minute. And considering their fear, if Tony did, they didn’t have much reason to hesitate before shooting.
"Tony, for what it's worth, I think you've made the right decision." Rhodey spoke up and held Tony's hand, to thread the omega's arm through his.
There was a moment of silence in which Tony just let himself be, then Steve's hand was back on his upraised cheek.
"The vouchers Pep. All recorded and signed. Everything I own. Well. I kept the tower, I thought you wouldn't mind. Oh and my suits of course. But the company," he kissed Steve's mouth hanging open a little with surprise "is all yours now."
“I’ll ask for the last time.” He said and he saw Tony gulp, his vision had narrowed down to the minutest twitch of the omegas body, “If you don’t want me, say no right now. Or I will fuck you through your heat. You will forget whatever happened between us before now. You will completely be mine.”
"Dead serious Tony. I know that you've probably never done any of that before. I'll allow you a period of learning, where geniune mistakes won't be punished. But I want you  to see and accept the benefits of your service."
"I want you to wear your service uniform to the wedding." He said. "Then I want you to fuck me wearing it."
Barton looked at him surprised for a second, then gave short laugh. "I wouldn't know, with how tight he's clenched all the time, it'd be kinda hard to tell."
He pushed off the wall he was leaning on to make his way toward them to ask what was wrong but got waylaid by people who wanted to shake the hand of Captain America in return for the donation they had made. He didn’t want to be rude but he pushed them off as fast as he could. By the time he reached Pepper, Tony was nowhere to be seen.
Tony’s mouth was hanging open with his eyes closed, moaning at Steve’s smallest movement. His lips were red and wet, his hair a mess, his collarbones and neck baring marks of his alpha. His thighs were trembling terribly where they were wrapped around Steve and Steve loved the feeling. Feeling Tony from the inside, invading him and to be welcomed so fully. Tony was still trying to adjust though, and there was no reason to hurry. Instead Steve let one of Tony’s hands go and snaked a hand between them to grip Tony’s hard cock.
Tony slumped on the bed and looked at the notebook in his hands. He could still feel the cage around his cock, he was too horny to function properly, and now he was supposed to cook? He'd actually been excited about getting some alone time with his prototype but now it looked like a sad lump of plastic and metal on the bed and Tony's mind drew a blank on the equations he'd been thinking about at the gym.
Tony finished his speech with some glib and a little off beat joke, as was expected of him. And of course the reporters looked properly scandalized as was expected of them. Pepper smiled and blushed in the most charming way, Tony gently led her away from the army of reporters, looking satisfied.
Tony sat there seemingly seriously considering what Steve had said. Then he spoke just when his silence was starting to make Steve nervous.
Steve froze on the spot for a moment. “His name is Colonel James Rhodes.” Steve said but his voice was tight and Tony immediately picked up on it, suddenly serious, he pulled his head out of the pizza box.
"Nope. Just scrambled eggs, bacon and toast." Tony answered as he forked over a huge lump into Steve's plate.
The Captain didn't even lift his head. He kept licking at Tony's exposed hole, spread to the maximum.
Tony traced lines on Steve chest, then moved lower to touch Steve’s erection. Steve didn’t move but let him explore. Tony looked at him with two different sets of eyes. On the one hand, it was Steve lying here with him, Captain America, all down to Earth, goody two shoes, responsible and respectable commander, soldier, kid from Brooklyn, a man out of time. Someone Tony trusted and liked.
Actually, fuck this. He wasn't going to be awkward or embarrased. He was Tony fucking Stark. Yeah, Steve Rogers was a picture of perfection but Tony Stark was hot. He knew he had a good body, and he knew how to use it. Confidence was his thing. If Steve wanted him naked, Tony could do naked. All he needed was to ignore the possibility of Mrs Gernsteins of the apartment block walking in at any moment. But he supposed, Steve wasn't the kind of guy that'd set Tony up for that kind of embarrasment.
“I hope you won’t regret this.” The colonel said before he got up to leave, “I’ll be around if you need me.”
Tony's heart leapt a little because suddenly he realised the answer wasn't 'no'. He actually found himself unsure if he wanted the punishment or not. Of course he didn't want to endure something painful or tiring or humiliating or uncomfortable, especially if it didn't lead to shattering orgasms. But on the other hand, he felt guilty. He felt like he'd done something he shouldn't have, not because of any rule, but just because it hadn't been fair.
By that point Steve was starting to get used to Tony looking at him for guidance. It still felt weird but not unfathomable anymore. Knowing that pre-head-wound Tony would have despised the idea of going to a shrink, he told Tony that it was up to him and he didn’t have to go if he didn’t want to. Still, he hadn’t been able to help himself but remind Tony that it could help.
Steve opened his eyes and frowned. He must have drifted off sitting up. Tony was still lying on his chest, clinging to him. He put an arm around the omega, he didn’t want to wake Tony, nor did he feel like trying to explain himself to Coulson in this particular moment.
“Yes! Yes, of course you should be telling me! Don’t worry about it, I am Iron Man, right? Of course I have clearance. Now tell me, what happened with the guy trying to take over the world? And what sort of name is Loki? I fought some crazy villain?”
“I hear you’ve learned about Tony’s orientation?” The colonel  asked, choosing not to ask Steve why he would feel the need to spend the night. Steve both felt relieved and disappointed. He would have loved to tell the colonel that it was because he would be acting as Tony’s alpha from now on, until such time asTony’s memories returned. But also he knew it would be Tony’s decision if he wanted to tell the others about their arrangement or not.
So I apologize for having to add this explanation. I'm just not sure if it came through. If it didn't, well.. it's all on me.
At Coulson’s picture Tony proudly told them, yes, he did remember the guy from the border, then looked crestfallen when Steve pointed out that it didn’t count. Tony made a joke about Thor’s photo, and another, even more wicked one about Fury’s.
The dom just sat there and watched Tony load the dishwasher and wash whatever needed to be washed in the sink.
He went for a long run and took a moment to hate himself when his feet took him to the Stark tower. As he stood there for a moment, he imagined he could still smell Tony, even through the massive building and the 30 floors between them. He wanted to check if he was ok but that would be pointless. Instead of going in, he turned around and ran back to his own place, then took a shower.
At first he slowly started to shake his head, then more clearly. "No. No I don't want to use my safeword. I think.. I think I did deserve a punishment." He raised his eyes and looked at Steve from under his eyelashes and saw the captains expression change. It was relief that crept into his eyes and Tony himself was relieved to see it.
“Yes master… Whatever you say master..” Tony mocked him petulantly before getting out of the car, but Steve let it go. He guessed he would have to wait and see how seriously Tony took their arrangement. And if it would work.
"Oh hey. How are you feeling?" Steve immediately sat up and smiled at him when he pushed up his blindfold, and Tony couldn't resent him this time.
"Tough. Hold still. Hands at your sides." Rogers slowly undid the buttons on Tony's crisp white shirt, while Tony tried not to fidget. He knew he had a nice body but revealing the arc reactor always made him nervous. It was too intimate, too revealing, made him too vulnerable.
He had planned to yell at Tony, ask him what he thought he had been doing and generally chew him out but the sight gave him pause, his anger suddenly evaporated. It wasn’t just the scent, Tony was genuinely scared.
“Alright. You be a good little beta and do what Captain Kill-joy tells you. But I don’t know, I may slip up and mention to Banner how you told me what a major asshole he is and- ”
"Please Steve, please! You have to let me suck you! I'll do whatever you want. You can come down my throat, you can come on my tongue and watch me swallow, you can come on my face, wherever you want.. You'll love it, I promise!"
The agent who showed him to the room watched Tony pull out a chair and drape himself across it, nonechalant and comfortable.
Occasionally he had to work to keep his hands to himself, when Tony looked at him with those huge brown eyes, with his hair mussed because the engineer had been running his hands through it all day. He wanted to grab Tony, kiss him, then straighten his hair only to muss it up again. Preferably as he bent Tony over the workbench and fucked him until Tony screamed.
As soon as he stood up Steve pulled him in for a hug, then brushing his hair out of his forehead smiled down on Tony.
"Getting comfy. You know I never realised how much potential a gym has when it comes to fucking. You could just tie me on to this beauty," he patted the cushioned leg rests, "with that rope you got there, and fuck me until I screamed. And no one would even hear."
Then there were hands on the backs of his thighs. He tried to talk again but it only came out as a garbled moan.
“No, not at all. We’d like to know how you circumvented Natasha’s efforts. Also, to draw up a new contract more suited to your special circumstances. I don’t think we need to reevaluate your spot on the Avengers, you’ve already proven yourself more than suitable Mr Stark.  You have nothing to worry about.”
"Don't try to mind fuck me Barton, I swear on my mothers grave I'll make you regret it if you try to pull some dom crap on me right now." Tony bit out.
Was he willing to go there? If he wasn't, was there any point in saying red? Why not just use his safeword and get out of the whole deal?
"Give me.. Give me bourbon. No, no, make it double." He told the bartender, then there were a pair of big, warm hands on his waist. He turned around to face the alpha.
It was written in Tony's files so Rogers must already know it, but he still appreciated the gesture. Repeating it as a reminder to them both.
Tony would of course deflect any attempt, so he promised himself that he would be very subtle about it, no pressure, just offer help in anyway he could, offer his own reassurance that he would keep Tony’s secret safe. Tell him, that Steve understood and admired him for his courage.
When a pair of very clean soft brown leather shoes came into his line of sight he forgot about how weird it felt to be kneeling though. Suddenly a dominant, /his/ dominant was standing in front of him. It changed everything. Something sparked in the pit of his stomach, looking at those shoes, feeling the mans gaze looking down on him. The mans speech about Tony's character flashed back into his mind.
Now that Tony was listening for it, he heard Steve's bare feet on the carpet as the dom walked closer to him.
“I must have been so excited to meet Captain America. You were my childhood hero, you know.” He said suddenly, smiling and carefree. And why wouldn’t he be? He had forgotten their rocky start. He had forgotten most of his life.
"Oh shi-! What! No fair! You made me drop them!" Tony craned his neck to try and see where the pennies went, as if he could reach out and place them back under his figers without dropping any other pennies.
“Steve, I believe you, you don’t need to give me the details. Anyway, I know that Tony is no wilting flower. I’m just saying.”
“Well. At least you haven’t changed much. Stubborn as a goat and still walking the line between being stupid and brave. Tony, you don’t have to go through this alone.”
But he knew the panic was irrational and he could safeword out anytime. At this point, he didn't even need the safeword, he could just get up an walk away. The tought calmed him a little, so he forced himself to speak "Yes. I won't look up until I have permission."
When Steve turned around, Tony had kicked off the shorts, and was palming himself. He was already half erect, leaning against a piece of equipment that had leg spreaders.
Before he could get the words out, sensing what Steve was about to say Tony bowed his head forward and to the side, exposing his neck and looking up at Steve under his thick eyelashes in the most beautifully submissive gesture Steve had ever seen.
"All my shirts and trousers that need a wash. Not all of them need ironing but that's exactly what you'll be doing untill dinner." Steve said.
“Is Steve gone?” Pepper appeared as if summoned by Tony’s thoughts and Tony nodded. Then turned to her.
"That... is.. I wasn't expecting that." Tony muttered in shock and Steve laughed, then handed Tony his drink.
Tony was curious about everything. And even if Steve was no meathead, Tony was much smarter than him. After about the second day in the workshop, going through all the science stuff Tony had forgotten about, Steve was already having trouble keeping up with Tony’s techno babble as Tony kept examining the various projects Jarvis had put in chronological order. It had taken Tony no time to reach the project detailing how he had built the first suit.
Steve was pacing the halls of the infirmary, passing by Tony’s door every couple of minutes. He didn’t know how long it had been but the doctors had done the tests, scans, and whatever else was needed, then placed Tony into a room. They hadn’t yet told Steve what the problem was or how long Tony would have to stay there.
"Tony, come back here. If you make me say it one more time I'll have to punish you. Neither of us want that at this point."
“Steve, he was taking the suppressants.. He is not anymore, because he doesn’t remember them, and I didn’t think.. Shit.. He went cold turkey without realizing..”
"No, I'm not. What you did in your private life before you wore my collar is none of my business. But I'm not going to let you make this all about sex. I'll only have sex with you when I'm sure it's just an enjoyable part of our relationship, not the main goal."
Then it dawned on Tony, this guy here had just arrived and maybe Steve hadn’t warned him about telling Tony things from his past.
"This is not rejection, I'm not rejecting you." Steve said, then his hand went to the nape of Tony's neck to finger the collar. "As a matter of fact, I find you very attractive. You're gorgeous, very smart with very strong spirit. I just want to do this right."
"Tony, all I asked of you was to focus on obeying and making me happy. I am happy. Job well done. Alright?"
He swung the chair left and right as he scrolled through his texts, unseeing. All he could do right now was to look as unfazed as possible. Not show fear.
"Fuck, that hurt!" Tony raised a hand to rub at the spot on top of his head and Rogers simply grabbed his wrist, bent both Tony's arms behind his back and looped Tony's belt around them, tying his wrists behind his back.
After that Tony started to zone out. The music was actually quite nice and calming. His arms and thighs were getting tired but nothing too concerning as of yet. He was fit, he was rested, he could do this all night if Steve wanted to.
Tony leaned back in his seat, arms still crossed, trying to put as much distance between himself and Barton as was possible, without running out of the room. Because that would be childish.
He made the necessary phone calls, telling Coulson that they wouldn’t be coming in for the next week. What surprised Steve the most was his own reaction when Coulson asked after Tony. It was irrational and a little humiliating how angry Steve got at the agent. He knew he had to tell Coulson at least that there was a personal emergency preventing them from coming into work. Coulson was sharp enough to guess what that emergency might be, now that he knew for a fact Tony was an omega. But it felt annoying, having to inform another alpha of his own omegas heat. Because Tony was Steve’s and no one elses.
"Yeah. Home." Steve finally spoke. Then he kissed Tony on the lips and said, "but you'll have to walk in front of me. These pants don't really hide much."
Tony was already settling in and getting comfortable. He wondered how Steve might make him come tonight.
Tony furiously wiped at his eyes. He wasn’t crying. Not really but trying not to, was giving him a headache.
“Steve. I know you’re a good man. And I do trust you. But as much as Tony trusts you with his life too, I don’t know how he will react now that he knows you know. He probably won’t like it. ”
And so, 10 minutes later, Tony was standing in the middle of the wet kitchen floor, naked save for his collar and cock ring, holding his mop and bucket, trying to figure out a way of walking out without leaving footprints.
Thor was away in Asgard, and Bruce was a big no no if they wanted to keep the mess under wraps. Which left Iron Man and Captain America.
Steve was lying on his back as Tony dragged his beared through the six pack, then kissed him just under his navel. The alpha's cock nudged him under his chin and Tony grinned.
Was it usual for the Colonel to show up unannounced in Tony’s house? Maybe it was, they were close friends. But Steve had thought the man had been away on mission. Then again, it was entirely plausible that he would want to check on his omega friend after the incident in Syria. Steve remembered that Pepper had called him when they’d brought Tony home from medical.
He had looked forward to Tony opening his first fanmail, but the moment was ruined now and Steve didn’t want to sit and stew in the scent of Tony’s fainting arousal and growing disappointment. He grabbed his gym bag and walked to the door.
After that, hit after hit landed, demonstrating how Steve wouldn't treat Tony like he was made of glass. This would have been a hard spanking no matter the context, but no warm up and no foreplay meant Tony felt each and every hit very acutely.
It would have been fine if this was just a fling like so many others. If Tony had jumped into bed with Steve for a night of fun and parted in good spirit the next day, it would have been fine. But somehow this was not what was going on here. Steve had been fooled into thinking he could make a proper sub out of Tony, worthy of care and consideration.
Tony shivered at the intense way Steve delivered that line. No bragging or exaggeration. Just a statement of fact, made in a quiet, understated but confident way. Tony had no doubt that Steve would make him scream and they both knew it.
He had dreamt of Tony a few times. It was either a nightmare, a variation on the fundraiser evening in which Steve was just a little too late, or Tony going into heat in the middle of a battle or something equally horrific. Or it was the sort of dream that made Steve wake up to sticky sheets with Tony’s remembered scent still under his nose.
No matter how Steve tried, sometimes glimpses of these fantasies wormed their way into their daily life, sitting alone together with Tony in the workshop all day, when Tony gave him a certain kind of look or a shy smile.
He could just grab his stuff and go home. Steve would be sad. Maybe a bit angry. Mostly relieved though, Tony supposed. He'd be upset that Tony left without saying anything but in the end, he'd be relieved to get rid of a difficult sub that he'd taken in because he considered it to be his duty.
Steve’s couldn’t hold back a small laugh, maybe Tony acted like he resented obeying Steve but Steve could tell Tony wasn’t really bothered. At least not enough to forego innuendo.
Some semblance of his logical mind was holding back the reigns though. Telling him to wait and see, this was pure instinct, it meant nothing. This whole thing was going to end in dissappointment anyway, so no need to embarras yourself.
The captain didn't sound angry. He sounded calm, very very calm. Tony suddenly started to feel fear creep up from his stomach for the first time.
On the other hand it was Tony’s alpha who was lying next to him. Calm and permissive right now, but also commanding, and a little wild, like a beast of prey who let you pet it because it liked you. Or owned you. Confidant in his ownership and of his territory. All coiled strength, just held back at the alphas will. On Steve’s case even more so than usual. Tony suddenly realized he had never felt this before. Never seen it on anybody. Never looked at anybody and seen their orientation so obviously, felt it so deeply, almost superposed on their image. And in that moment, even if he still didn’t remember, he knew with absolute certainty that he had never had an alpha before Steve. He had never even seen an alpha in all their glory, like he was seeing Steve now.  He hadn’t even seen Steve like this before this morning. Even when he had knelt before him so many times. He had just known that he was an alpha. He had never felt it.
A big hand carded through his hair and before Tony could cry in frustration, he felt Steve's other hand on his hole again. He was so wet now, dripping from the through work out his dom had given him, and Steve's finger easily slid into his hole, cutting off Tony.
"You should be able to pee and clean yourself easily. It should be much easier to obey the no orgasm rule now." Steve said sounding a bit smug.
The thought was disturbing. Wanting to have sex with Captain America was one thing, but needing Steve Rogers to guide him and help him and basically dominate him was another. The fact that he needed Steve to stay on his feet was scary and shameful. Tony couldn’t reason out clearly why he was ashamed of it, but he felt like it was a shameful thing. Maybe that was the reason he had decided to pretend to be an alpha? But he didn’t think less of any omega for seeking out protection and guidance from their alphas in their personal lives, by choice. Why did he feel shame when it came to himself?
For a moment he considered just walking back and telling Rogers that, too late, the boxes are already in trash. Then he cosidered just lying and telling him he did recycle. But this was their first dinner, and Tony had decided to make an effort to obey. He looked out of the kitchen to see Steve sitting calmly in front of the fire, busy with something in his lap, out of Tony's field of vision, he turned and looked at the trash can, then with a grimace lifted the cover of it to pull out the boxes.
Steve let the collar slip from his fingers and it hurt Tony, somewhere behind his ribcage. He took a step back.
Steve didn’t listen to the rest, he pivoted on his heel, he could already hear Tony’s voice, trying to answer and explain, drowned out by whoever was yelling at him. Tony’s voice was trembling.
The cock cage had become an uncomfortable but exciting buzz at the back of his head. All through his mopping and cooking and working, he had been feeling it, but not really. The occasional move would feel uncomfortable, then he'd be reminded of why his dom had put a cage on him and he'd be torn between a tiny thrill at his helplessness and embarrassed frustration.
Before Tony could give an outraged reply he went on, “And it was hard to miss the way you looked at the captain. No need to worry though, it was only noticeable because I know you two well.”
Tony kind of relaxed into the embrace, his hands finally coming up to touch the dom's arms. Then Steve let go.
Tony had settled down and had stopped kicking but when Steve looked down he was looking up at Steve with huge, scared eyes.
"The drugs your foundation has been working on. The uh.. The experimental suppressants." Then Steve hurried to add, obviously feeling how tense Tony suddenly got. "Listen, I understand why you felt like you had to take them but you don't anymore, right? I'll be with you. I'll come running whenever you need me. I don't want you messing with your chemistry. I was scared witless when I found you in the shower.."
But he forced himself to breathe and settle, he knew this game. Steve would probably work him up to the brink of orgasm but not let him come several times until he got bored and fucked him. So he quieted, trying to show Steve that it was ok to keep moving, get on with the program.
“Damn. Then I need to find him..” Happy turned to look around a little frantically, suddenly looking as nervous as Pepper had inside.
“Miss Potts.” He greeted Pepper as civilly as he could in order not to give away how worried he was. Pepper turned to him and tried to smile. “Oh. Steve. How are you doing? Is everything alright?”
"Did you know Clint Barton was once collared for a period of 6 months?" the dom asked him. Tony consciously smoothed his features.
"He is missing? Is this how you take care of your omega Rogers? From where I'm standing it sure as hell looks like he ran away from you!" Rhodes stabbed a finger on Steve's chest.
“I remember going to MIT. My father was angry about something but that’s nothing new. I know he’s gone now, don’t remember how. Then..” his eyebrows furrowed.
Steve was relieved to see Pepper clicking her way through the corridor in her expensive heels along a nurse. They exchanged a short greeting, apparently Pepper was listed as Tony’s emergency contact. She had come as soon as had been possible, considering Tony seemed to be fine, just under surveillance.
He had wandered in to the direction of the main street, hoping to catch a cab at first, then he had simply wandered mindlessly. After that it was a terrifying mix of instinctual want and intellectual wrong. Hands on his body that felt good but should never be there. Nausea and lust, disgust and desire, pulling Tony both ways as he had kicked and writhed when the men held him down.
“Here’s some of the fanmail you received, Fury directed yours to me. I took the liberty of selecting some of the safer ones.” He handed the envelopes to Tony and Tony took them, mechanically. But then he raised his head to look at Steve. Steve could practically smell the disappointment on him.
He was still in his uniform, most likely he had come straight to the tower from the airport. That told Steve how much the man really cared about Tony. He had probably come as soon as he could.
“Yes. Ok.” Steve said n the end, walked to the elevator but then stopped, “You do know I’m not going to tell anyone right? I hope that goes without saying?”
“I’ve seen the medical reports. There seems to be no detectable physical damage. The doctors can not predict a time frame for when he might recover, if he ever does.”
“Cap.. Cap-” Tony made a half motion like he both meant to stand up and crawl to Steve, then stopped himself, shivering and.. writhing. There was no other word for it. Steve looked down at the mess that was Tony, for a moment not knowing what to do. A choked sob from the brunette brought him back to his senses.
He was such a fraud, pretending to submit to this gorgeous, innocent, young dom, just so he could get his. He'd always looked at Steve and seen Captain America. Always in charge, in control... But in the end Steve Rogers was just a kid trying to do the right thing. He made mistakes like everyone else.
Pepper was on the phone, calling hospitals and police stations along with everyone she knew, trying to find out if anyone had seen Tony and all Steve could do was pace nervously around her, trying to hear the other end of her conversations.
“Fine.” He breathed out, clearly not liking Steve’s involvement, just like Pepper, then looked a little sheepish, “Tony has.. a condition.  Nothing serious.” He hastened to add. “He has it under control. It’s just that, tonight was a little risky and I was supposed to be on guard if he needed to go home immediately. But.. uh.. It was just for a moment, I mean,” he gestured around Steve toward where the petite blond had went, “she needed help. So I looked away for like a moment. Or maybe five minutes. Ten, tops. Then I came back here with her and then you came. If he came out while I was gone.. But I mean I couldn’t leave her alone to carry two suitcases. And they were massive I tell you, I dunno why women even need-”
"Good, that's good Tony. I'm very proud of you, very pleased that you took your punishment so bravely."
When he saw Tony he swung the rope and caught it in his hand, gathering it in one fluid move and stepped towards the sub with a smile.
As Steve marched him to a small office with a bruising grip, he had been stretched to his ability to hold himself up. Everything seemed to go down hill, he felt like he couldn’t do anything right, he didn’t even know what was right, he needed someone to tell him, like it had happened with the junior agents. He needed Steve to tell him what was right. Who else could he trust? And Steve was angry with him too, he had even managed to piss Steve off finally.
In the mean time, I know how annoying it is when an author goes so long between updates, takes you out of the story, makes you forget what you've read previously. So I apologize. But I can't honestly say I'll be returning to this soon either. I need some time.
Tony’s writhing subsided and his eyes cleared a little at the question but his hips were still restless. Still it looked like Tony was considering the question.
"The last part means sex right?" he asked, "Because if it's not, I'd like a moment to decide if I want to use my safeword now."
Steve sighed. He couldn’t in good conscience sit there and watch Tony struggle alone. If Tony was starting to remember he wouldn’t want Steve to touch him anymore, but he would have to explicitly tell Steve to stay away. Making up his mind he pulled the blanketed bundle of genius, billionaire, philanthropist into his chest, letting Tony lie between his legs. Then he tentatively carded his fingers through the messy dark hair and gently pulled the omegas head onto his shoulder, exposing his throat. Slowly, measuring Tony’s reactions carefully he raised his hand to wrap it around Tony’s throat. Not constricting but restrictive. Steve hoped it wouldn’t be unwelcome and that it’d be grounding.
"Woah woah! Stark! Those things don't come off like that! You're gonna break something!" Barton said.
"It's not her fault." A warm hand started rubbing his stomach and Tony couldn't really be bothered to get mad. He was too relaxed for any feelings of resentment. And anyway, he decided he didn't want to keep secrets from Steve in any case.
Then he had to take the calls that were meant for Tony. First it was Colonel Rhodes, late as usual after finding out about Tony’s panic attack. Steve had really strained his self control not to slam the phone down on the guy. Aside from the fact that it was kind of hard to hang up a cellphone dramatically, it would do no good. The Colonel would only come knocking on their door, demanding to see for himself if Tony was alright and that confrontation with the state of mind Steve was in right now, might lead to bloodshed.  Instead Steve had gritted out that Tony was fine, implied that Tony had chosen the alpha he wanted to spend his special time with, and that they could argue about this later.
This was so stupid. He didn't want to fetch drinks for Barton... He didn't even want the archer to see him fetching drinks on command. But he didn't want to earn any punishments either, other than his outburst about the sex, he'd been doing so well, even if he did say so himself.
None of that could happen of course. Steve knew Tony wanted him now, but acting on it would be no different than rape, when Tony couldn’t actually consent.
At dawn, Steve was sitting on the posh leather couch in the lounge of the 75th floor of the Stark Tower, trying to stop the nervous jiggling of his leg, his mind racing as he alternated between exploding up from his seat, pacing for a few moments then forcing himself to sit down, calm down and think rationally.
“Of course.” Agent Coulson, closed the dossier he was working on at once and turned his attention to Steve, pointing to the chair in front of his desk. “Please.”
"You have amazing potential Tony. All I want is for you to be happy. Please try to think on it on the ride home. What that means for you. What happiness means for you, and what would be the best and worst outcomes you can expect from this arrangement. Be honest with yourself."
"Were you under the influence of alcohol? Drugs? Unable to make a decision with a clear head? In your case, I'll even count severe sleep deprevation."
He tossed and turned in bed, trying to ignore his erection. Completely natural response, Rogers, he tried to remind himself, and absolutely inappropriate. He is in trouble, he is in pain and here you are jerking off over him. Well, the voice of reason in his head pointed out, if you could have your pleasure in him, he wouldn’t be in pain now, would he? No.
Banner was out his field of vision. Then Tony heard him speak on the phone. In the next moment Steve was there, looking angry. Not with Tony though, he was mad at Dr Banner.
Of course, Tony wanted his orgasm so he ended up making Steve the sandwich as he'd asked. He made himself one too since the pasta had had to go to trash. It was actually polite of Steve to even have eaten it, considering how awful it had tasted so Tony tried not to resent him too much.
His head was clearer now. He had bitten Tony pretty badly there in the end. He knew Tony wasn’t in distress, if not by the scent, by the way the omega was snuggling into him right now, but he’d still do better to have a doctor see it. Tony on the other hand, looked like he didn’t have a single care in the world right now. Steve couldn’t see his face as Tony had his back to Steve’s chest but the way he pushed his hips into Steve’s crotch in an effort to keep Steve inside him, the way he hugged Steve’s arm closer to his chest and kept placing small kisses on his hand reassured the alpha. He hugged Tony tighter and kissed his hair.
"I see you, Tony. All of you. And I want you so bad. It's driving me nuts watching you walk around naked. All strength and stubborn wit. You have no idea how tempting you are."
There was dead silence in the room when the dominants electronically changed voice fell silent. Tony realised he was looking at his hands in his lap, shoulders slumped.
Of course Coulson knew Pepper wasn’t really Tony’s omega. It was an open secret, just for the press. They hadn’t even bothered to pretend for SHIELD’s sake. But the question was such a justified one, Steve felt tongue tied for a moment.
“He must have realized that it was too early for his heat.” For some reason her voice sounded a little guilty to Steve.
Steve took his time kissing the disheveled genius, letting go of his doubts and anxiety, letting his animal self take over. And what he most wanted to do was to breathe in Tony’s sweet scent without guilt or self imposed restraint. He didn’t need restraint anymore. He would never hurt Tony, he would only have him, make the omega his. His instincts were protective as much as they were possessive.
First Steve very carefully took the cock cage off of him, then sitting next to Tony on the bed pressed the cool washcloth over his face. It felt heavenly. Then Tony was handed a glass of water. It tasted soothing and made him realise how parched he was feeling. After that the Captain made him lie on his front.
“Tony is a regular here..” Pepper pointed out the obvious, sounding a little dazed, “Maybe they just checked if there was any physical problem and no one bothered to ask him anything?”
There were phone calls involved, Jarvis would say something sometimes and Steve would go away for a while but never for more than a few minutes. Steve would wash him, feed him, fuck him, keep him warm, comfortable and satisfied. As days passed, Tony would sometimes vaguely remember that he should probably pay attention to his surroundings, make an effort to leave the bed, care about something more than having Steve touch him and fuck him. But it would pass very quickly. And anyway, he was so happy, so satisfied with life in general that he couldn’t imagine what could be wrong with staying naked in the bed for the rest of his life and have his alpha take care of him.
A dark head immediately appeared from behind the leather couch, Tony’s face was stretched into a huge smile, he looked carefree and very happy to see Steve. Or the pizza, at least.
For the second day in a row, Tony woke up in Steve's bed. Except this time it was still dark outside.
"Crap.." he sat up in bed, feeling disoriented, and remembered what had happened. He'd gone to bed so happy, how had he managed to fuck it up between last night and this morning? And he had no clue where he stood with Steve now. Should he just make breakfast?
Tony stepped back, did as he was told, laying out every piece of garment on top of eachother on the couch as he stripped. Then he knelt in front of the Captian only in his slacks.
He had to memorize the names and faces of the few people who knew his secret. God, and what a secret. How had he done it? How? And more importantly, could he do it again? Keep pretending through his memory loss? Did he want to?
“I fell?” This time it was clearly a question and Tony’s frown intensified enough that Steve could see the confusion even through the lack of light.
“This is pointless.” He told the alphas. “I don’t remember anything, I’m no use to SHIELD like this anyway. There’s no point in you tattling to leather daddy.”
Just as realization dawned on him, a collar snapped around his neck and forgetting all about permissions and kneeling and shoes, he looked up.
Pepper tried to smile but it was clear she didn’t believe her own words. Two hours wasn’t such a long time. It was a long time to be buying donuts but not nearly long enough for any police department to consider it seriously as a missing person case, especially when they couldn’t tell the police that Tony Stark the billionaire hero who had a billion different enemies, had amnesia. All the hospital listings she’d checked had turned out unhelpful too. She knew it was irrational but what else could she do? Tony wasn’t anywhere near SHIELD, no one from SI had seen him, Jarvis refused to look for him, Coulson had told them he’d dispatch a team but really, it was too early to tell yet.
“He turned me down before, didn’t he..” he said and looked down. Suddenly needing that glass of cognac.
“They left a little detail out of the memo then, he is still Tony Stark, Iron Man, a member of the Avengers. I suggest you try a little harder to remember why Director Fury ‘coddles his spoilt ass’. Come on Tony.” He turned to Tony then, and grabbed him by the shoulder. As he lead a meek and subdued Tony out of the room Banks was muttering something that sounded like superheroes and his ass.
Tony glared at Steve then turned to the Colonel to give an obviously fake smile, clearly mocking Steve for treating him like a child.
"Please.." Tony replied weakly, and the finger in him moved, searching for his prostate. Tony moved his hips to help that one finger and then gave a long moan when Steve hit his mark.
Pepper just nodded and the picture changed, showing Happy, Tony shook his head, the picture changed again, to Bruce. Then Clint, Natasha, Agent Coulson.
Why did this feel like a breakup? Ridiculous. They had been dom and sub for what, 4 days? Why did Tony care if Steve formed an attachment way too fast, like a puppy?
Tony sat there and hated himself for how long he didn’t know. Eventually it was JARVIS who drew him out of his shame and self flagellation.
Tony took in Steve's words, unsure what exactly Steve was asking, but there had been one huge thing preying on his mind a while and his defences were down. It came tumbling out.
Tony suddenly realised how intensely he didn't want to be alone tonight. Not after his admission. He felt vulnerable like he'd never felt before, raw and gutted. But he felt comforted at the same time. It was confusing.
Steve woke up to sunlight, which was unusual. He looked around for a clock and spotted the digital time display on the window. He was still in the Stark Tower then. And it was almost 8 am. He sat up on the leather couch and rubbed his eyes. He was still wearing the same shirt and pants from the day before and he was a little cold. The previous evening came back to him very fast.
He stopped. Tony kept trying to pull him closer, his nails digging into Steve’s skin in his frustration but unless Steve moved, he had no hope of budging the alpha.
Steve kept looking at him, sitting on the bed ramrod straight and face devoid of expression. He didn't look cold but he looked nothing like the loving and passionate dom Tony had seen him to be so far either. He was just sort of blank. Hiding, Tony thought. But hiding what? Tony wasn't stupid, but he also couldn't bring himself to believe that Steve might be hiding how much he cared.
Then he kissed Tony on the forehead. The chastest, stupidest kiss. But it didn't feel stupid to Tony. It felt like his heart was cracking right down the middle to expose the raw, juicy innards.
"I'm scared." He sounded small, voice low. But in the empty room, accompanied only by the crackling of the fire it was still a solid admission.
He knew Steve didn't care, he knew Steve didn't judge him for it. He was fine here. He could stay here, cuddled for a while longer. He deserved it, after the pain he went through. He could let go.
He debated if he should kneel back down or sit on the couch next to Steve for a second but before he could worry about it too much Steve said "Bring us something cold to drink. Clint, beer?" Barton nodded, the smug bastard.  "Get yourself a glass of juice Tony."
It was just a couple of minutes before Steve stepped out of the shower and wrapped a towel around his waist. Tony just remained on his knees, looking up at his dom, feeling kind of lost.
“You remember.” He said. Steve liked Banner usually, but the man had been uncharacteristically stupid today. Of course Steve wasn’t trying to shift blame. He should have warned the scientist. Then again, none of them could have known this would happen if Tony found out about his recent past like that. All in one sitting.
But after that… Tony closed his eyes for a second even through his reckless driving. Bliss. Salvation. He remembered that part clearly. He had vaguely recognized Steve. Mostly the parts about him that told Tony’s hind brain that, this was a strong alpha, a good alpha that he trusted and obeyed. It was okay for Steve to touch him. Not just okay but Tony wanted Steve to touch him. And Steve did touch him. First providing warmth, then safety in his arms. He had smelled heavenly too, all hard muscle and solid comfort under his hands. Tony had been scared and Steve had been there to keep him safe.
But in truth Pepper was pinching the bridge of her nose and shaking her head at Tony's answer. Of course she was happy but she saw no reason to antagonize the media further.
"Hell, I was pissed off Fury was making me play errand boy but I kinda appreciate the humor in it now." Barton chuckled. "Here, your clothes."he held the bags out.
Tony got to work, not really noticing any of the labels on the cans and bottles and boxes any more, he just collected everything he'd spread out and put it all in the recycling bin, then cleaned up the floor with a piece of cloth Steve held out to him. When he was done he was incredibly tired but his arms and legs didn't ache as bad any more.
Tony had clearly okayed chastity devices and orgasm control on his contract. He'd played around with the concepts (and the toys) before, and throughly enjoyed himself. But he suspected with the Captain as his dom it would go a little above 'play' and either way, when it came to sex, Tony still felt a bit awkward around Steve. It didn't help that the idea was very interesting to his threatened parts.
"No no no..." Tony tried to say around the gag when Steve pulled away. Tony let the toy ball go and it rolled off the bed, but all Steve did was chuckle and reach above to take the gag off.
"Because I'm not good for you." Tony turned around, calm. "I am not being petty or angry... Definitely not fishing for praise. It's just a fact. You deserve much better. I should just.. leave you alone. Maybe you'll meet a nice sub. The blond down the hall. Who knows."
"Tonight? Other than the matter of your punishment, just to talk and relax. You can start by taking off your jacket."
Once they were inside, Steve stopped himself before he gave the order that was just on the tip of his tongue. If Tony was really his omega, he knew perfectly well what he wanted first. He wanted to see Tony naked, willingly vulnerable, and to explore Tony’s body without restriction, what he hadn’t gotten to see in the office. So he didn’t order Tony to strip. Nor did he reach out and pull Tony close so he could strip the omega himself.
"I am sorry." the dom spoke, looking at somewhere below Tony's chin. Tony realised the cap wasn't just avoiding his eyes, he was looking at the collar. "That was my fault. I shouldn't have let Clint come in. You weren't ready for that. I never meant to make you feel like you were excluded or treated differently because of your collar. I never meant to embarras you."
“So,” he started, “you called me capsicle once before. When we were on our way to the Hellicarrier.”
“What are you doing here.” Steve spit out finally, it came out more like an accusation than a question.
Tony nodded and Steve let him be. He prayed the rest of the day would pass uneventfully as he walked away.
“You can debrief Fury later, he can do the yelling. I’ll take it from here Captain. If you don’t need medical attention, you can go get some rest.” He gestured to the sleek black car and Steve nodded at him gratefully. He wanted to just kick back and sleep for a while. He didn’t mind sleeping all the way to the airport and then through the flight.  He had almost reached the car when he heard Tony’s voice, calling his name in a panicked tone.
Tony's sobs started to trickle down to hiccups and he pushed away the shame that tried to barge in. He was a grown ass man, cuddled and crying in the lap of another man. The feeling of embarrasment was there but for once Tony didn't let it in.
Tony had looked distressed about the idea of going away with a strange omega until Steve had assured Tony that Pepper was a trusted friend and she would only take Tony to his own house. He had also promised to be right along, as soon as he could, after debriefing with Agent Coulson.
"I don't really have to use the cold water honestly, I can see you're excited by the idea of a chastity cage but you're not completely aroused yet. So we could've just waited for your erection to go down. But, this gives me a nice opportunity to.. motivate you to think twice before you try to talk your way out of an order again."
“You didn’t.” Steve said into Tony’s hair. He debated with himself if he wanted to tell Tony more, then decided getting closure on a half memory couldn’t hurt at this point.
“Hey,” he smiled and pushed the papers aside when Tony strolled in. He looked fine, happy even, his hands in his pockets and a pair of red tinged sunglasses pushed up to his forehead, he looked the same as he did before the head wound, confident, like he owned the place and everything in it.
So he expected it to be awkward when the man himself walked in. He wasn’t sure what he expected, surely there would be no sign of the heat Tony had went through, or of course Tony wouldn’t say anything about that evening to Steve, or anyone for that matter. After all, Tony had done this before, coming into work after his heat and none of them had noticed anything off. But still, Steve expected something.
The rest of the day went by in a similarly good mood. Tony didn't resent being blindfolded at the gym all that much this time. He appreciated the cardio Cap made him do, and the obstacle course felt more like a fun sort of challenge. He didn't make much better time than the previous day but it was easier to listen to Steve's voice and follow his direction.
He knew he needed to stop, rest, but he didn't know how to ask it of his dominant anymore. He let it go. The aches and tiredness, he let it all seep into his bones and owned it, accepting it. If Steve asked of him he could have stayed in place until he fell down.
Tony wanted to ask when and why he'd acquired a 'nice selection', but thought it wiser to be quiet for now.
"You are dying for it aren't you. It is such a good look on you. Horny and desperate, unable to do anything about it."
Sometimes, in the deep darkness at night, Steve stroked himself to images that would make him blush in the light of day. He imagined Tony sneaking into his room, reassuring Steve that he belong to Steve, right here and now, that Steve should fuck him, claim him, brand him and make Tony his. Fantasy!Tony would tell Steve that after he claimed Tony, if Tony’s memories returned and Tony pushed him away, Steve could just hold him down and fuck him again until Tony yielded, accepted the truth, accepted that he was owned. Then Steve would do exactly that, covering Tony’s smaller body with his, pushing him down into the sheets and kissing him, brutally, taking everything from Tony and making him his omega, fucking him with slow and deep strokes of his cock until Tony begged him to let him come.
After parking the car he put a hand on Tony’s knee to stop him from getting out. Tony obediently sat back and turned to give Steve a questioning look.
"You have issues with authority figures because you've always been let down by them. You have trust issues because you yourself have always been the only person you can trust. That is not how a team works. And as brilliant as you are, trust and being able to follow orders are essential to a team. Especially a team as specialized as the Avengers. You are not just reckless, you lack the confidance in your team mates, which puts everyone in danger. In other words, you are unable to let someone else make a decision. This collaring period is meant to be a training period in teaching you how to build trust, work with an authority figure and follow orders. Do you believe it is a fair assessment? Do you think it is a fair proposal?"
“What if he left because of me? What if he left because of his heat? What if he lost his memories again? What if he remembered everything and.. What if he is in trouble? Why would he just leave? What if he needs help? Pepper, I need to look for him..”
Ironing was mind bendingly boring. First couple of shirts had been almost fun, because Tony had never ironed before (hah!). It was a new challange, a new task to be mastered. But he got the hang of it pretty fast, and once that was done, it became intensely, agressively boring. If Steve had let him watch some TV or listen to music or podcasts or something while he did it, it wouldn't have been so terrible, but laundry was downstairs and TV was upstrairs, all tablets and internet was banned for now, apparently "What's a podcast?" was a legitimate question and music was a no go, because "This is supposed to be punishment Tony."
"Come here and let me take a look at the cage." Steve ordered right after Tony had finished washing the dishes. He'd been wearing the sweatpants and shirt Steve lent him, all afternoon. Now getting undressed once again seemed curiously embarrasing. But Tony got over is much faster this time.
Tony looked like a million bucks, dressed in his sharpest suit, Pepper looking absolutely breath taking on his arm, with her head inclined to the side a little, her dark blue dress exposing the length of her white slender neck above the deep decoltee as she listened to her alpha speak with confidence. She was the perfect picture of an omega who adored and completely trusted her alpha.
“Glad to see you made it back. ” Agent Coulson gave Steve one of his half smiles, with the corners of his eyes crinkling just a little more than usual. “I should be yelling at you for ditching your team.”
Steve smiled and kissed him gently on his messy hair. "That's two more swats for cursing." then he relented, "But to be fair, I can't wait to be inside you either," he murmured "I can't wait to make you beg and scream."
So he would smile and bare the attention if it landed that much more credibility into the event that famously controvertial Stark Industries organized. The republicans wouldn’t like that Captain America would be seen supporting the heat supressant drug research but that fact only made his presence in the fundraiser more important. After all Captain America stood for liberty as much as he stood for American tradition.
“Dumm- E.” He snapped his fingers and the bot obediently brought him a rag to wipe his hands on. “Close shop for the day. Daddy needs a drink.” He said and left to pour himself a double of his strongest.
“Yes Tony. You fell, one of the anti aircraft missiles hit you. We watched you crash. From what I can tell you hit your head. Do you feel pain anywhere else?”
"And I mean everything Tony. That's the ultimate no. If you are uncomfortable or want to take a break however, you can use the color codes."
“It’s alright. Help should be on the way. I’m sure Clint made it out fine. SHIELD will be sending agents to recover us. We just need to get to the border. They will have sent paramedics. ”
Happy’s shoulders drooped as he visibly realised that he was not only challenging Captain America, but also a friend.
Tony didn't know what to say to that and it was making him infinitely uncomfortable to have his dom apologize to him. Because this was exactly that, his dom apologizing. Not just Steve, Captain America, friend and team captain. He maybe would have brushed it off, forgave and forgot, or even mock and be a little shit about it if it was the latter apologizing. But now it was his dom apologizing and Tony did feel like Steve was his dom.
Yet. It niggled at him. He did respect Tony, aside from all the amazing things the guy managed to pull off, Steve respected him for surviving for so long as an omega while never getting any release from the stress of trying to act like someone he was not. It also called on the instinct that had woken up in him on the evening of the fundraiser. His baser, alpha self which never for a moment had forgotten how Tony’d clung to him, looked at him for help and depended on him.
“Tony, don’t take this the wrong way, but most of the blame is on you when it comes to why you two didn’t get along. You always had to antagonize him one way or the other. He put up with it.”
He exited the alley that connected the two main streets together and looked around the empty block. It was sufficiently late at night that most people were asleep with the occasional occupied cab driving by. He raised his head and subtly scented the air to catch a whiff of the cologne that Tony liked to bathe himself in.
Tony gulped slowly, his adams apple bobbing under Steve’s palm, and relaxed into Steve’s hold. Only then Steve dared to move his thumb in a slow caress below Tony’s ear, soothing his pulse.
Unfortunately for him he'd forgotten to put salt in the eggs and it tasted as bland as eggs could be. He looked up to see Steve putting salt on his food with a very serious face.
“They are machines, sir. Their coding doesn’t allow them to feel boredom or frustration. Unlike some of your more advanced tech.” Jarvis sounded, his tone entirely too dry.
Steve was a healthy alpha. And one that had been alone for far too long. More than 70 years at this point. When he thought about having a lover, he thought he or she would be the one. The one to settle down with. The sentiment had been old fashioned even back in the 40’s, but it was just the type of guy Steve was.
Tony had built safe houses for omegas who needed protection from their abusive spouses or family members. Steve had seen the people in them. Omegas who had nowhere else to go, who had no education or ability to take care of themselves.  Who had been subjected to violence, slavery and rape. Tony gave them shelter, education and protection.
He tried to suck on air then felt his legs give… He was in the lab. Not adrift in vast emptiness, falling. He wasn’t falling. Banner held him up and eased him into a chair.
Steve was puttering around, pouring a glass of water, wetting a washcloth and going through his drawer. "Lie down. It's an order." Steve said and Tony tentatively laid back down.
Oh yeah, he was supposed to be the maid. Not very pleased with his next task, Tony got up from where he was kneeling being hand fed, he gathered the boxes, carried them to the kitchen and dumped them in trash.
“No. He is not.” Steve answered, his voice coming out harsher than he liked. Because he knew the colonel was not Tony’s alpha. Tony didn’t have an alpha. And whatever relationship they had before, Tony didn’t remember him. Tony remembered Steve. It meant something, even if Steve didn’t know what.
“I know.. And I’m not.” Tony said and deliberately reached out to grab hold of Steve’s free hand on the table, effectively ending the discussion.
"Yeah Tony, I've heard the 'it's not you, it's me' speech. It is fine. If you don't want me as a dom, you have every right to decline. I wish you had told me sooner. But I suppose you had to give it a try."
“I..” Tony thought for a moment before answering. “I don’t remember anything. At least after MIT and even that is hazy. But I can tell I’m safe here. You wouldn’t let anything happen to me.”
"This is none negotiable Tony." Steve interrupted his indignant gasp, "You need to get used to a decent and healthy sleep cycle. It'll get easier as you get used to it. After breakfast I'll take a bit of time to go through news, paperwork and reports, while you clean up. this is the time you'll be cleaning up the gear from the previous evening as well as breakfast. Lunch will be at my descrition, depending on what we're doing that day, but dinner is going to be at home this week. You will cook, we will have dinner, then we will talk."
Tony smoothly slid to his knees on the cushion and looked up at Steve, lightly leaning on his leg. Only then did Steve take the drink from Tony’s hand.
At the word 'heel', Tony felt a terrible laughter bubbling up his chest, then feared it might come out as tears and swallowed it down. He simply got up and walked to his new dominant, and stopped short a few steps behind him.
“Hello. You must be Dr Bruce Banner.” He answered walking around the workstation he was busy at, to shake the guys hand.
“Steve..” Pepper put a hand on Steve’s arm to stop his pacing, he hadn’t even realized he had started wearing a hole in the ground.  “There’s the matter of.. orientation. We need to tell Tony that he is not.. I mean if he doesn’t remember, he shouldn’t go around talking to people like... He might slip up.”
Come to think of it, it wasn't such a horrible task, watching Steve strip. Tony had seen him shirtless a few times. Various states of undress was bound to happen when you fought together on a regular basis. But he'd never paid attention to Steve as a dominant. Well, he had, of course he had seen what a gorgeous body the Cap had, but not in a going-to-end-up-in-bed-together sort of way. Now that it was a very real and immediate possibility and now that Tony had some idea of what kind of dom Steve was, watching Steve pull off his clothes looked completely different. And incredibly interesting.
For a long while the room was filled only with the soft noises Tony made as he sucked the captain. The he swallowed everything Steve had to give and dragged himself all the way up the bed till he was lying on top of Steve, chest to chest.
It wasn’t long before he felt Tony clench around him, then the scent of Tony’s come reached his nose. Tony gave out a choked moan and Steve memorized the small twitches he gave while he orgasmed, how he looked, how he sounded. Then he spilled himself, into the heat, almost willing for his seed to take root even though he knew it was impossible.
"Stop worrying. You know me, I know you. Try to relax, I freed up your week, but if you don't believe me, you can check with Ms Potts tomorrow. Today... There is nothing you can do Tony. There is nothing you can do, do you understand me? Let it go."
Tony’s legs moved to open further and he hooked a knee on Steve’s arm to pull his hips up, offer himself more fully, to be taken and to be claimed.
“You did very well today,” he started, and Tony frowned a little, he opened his eyes to give Steve a look that said ‘are you kidding me?’. Steve chuckled.
Cool cream was gently rubbed into his cheeks and Tony relaxed, melting into the covers that smelled like Steve. Everything was soft and hazey, he felt taken care of, cared for. It was as welcome a feeling as it was foreign. He decided he was too tired to think about it.
"You can come Tony." Steve murmured, sounding wrecked himself. "Go ahead and come for me sweetheart."
“God damn it, Tony, what are you doing..” He said as he knelt next to the omega but it came out more worried than angry. The scent of Tony’s heat was fresher in here, but muted. His body was trying to compensate for the heat loss rather than preparing the omega for a pleasant sex marathon. The engineers lips had gone blue, as well as his fingertips which Steve had to pry open from around Tony’s knees. First thing he needed to do was get rid of the wet pajama bottoms, wet clothes only worked to suck off heat. When Steve touched him, his skin was cold and clammy. Tony gave no indication that he’d noticed Steve was there until Steve picked him up, bridal style, to carry him to the bedroom. Only then Tony turned his gaze to look at Steve, but he still wasn’t speaking. His teeth wasn’t chattering, nor was the omega shivering anymore. Steve knew enough first aid to know that this was very bad indeed.
A bit disconcerted that he wouldn't get privacy even in the shower, Tony went in. The stall was plain clear glass. It felt a bit cramped after Tony's own shower (sauna), but he supposed it was still as comfortable as it could get in mid Brooklyn.
"Now listen. Last night was a punishment. Both for disobeying my first order and for disregarding as simple an order as cleaning up after our meal. You've consented to endurance, humiliation, as long as it's not public, and even piss play, on your check list. Your biggest weapon is your genius but your mind can also be your worst enemy. Last night you took your punishment beautifully and went into subspace like it was coming home. In the end, for once, you were calm and happy Tony. I saw it in you."
“Put my pups in you. It would be a good look on you.” He kissed a nipple and Tony whimpered. Wanting to hear the omega moan he bit the nipple he’d kissed while his fingers twisted in Tony’s slick to spread it. Then he found Tony’s entrance.
"You remembered... some things?" Pepper asked tentatively from behind Steve, "What sort of things exactly?" Her voice was a little higher than normal.
The discussion he’d had with Pepper was worrying, but being exposed to so much pheromones for so long without doing anything about it wasn’t easy for any alpha.  On his way to home all he could think about was Tony. How he had coped. How much pain he had endured to get through his heats alone, get through life alone. How strong that meant Tony was. And he had thought about Tony in heat. The images his creative brain offered did nothing to help his case of blue balls. But most disturbingly, he found himself dwelling more than was appropriate on the subject of Tony’s virginity. Surely, he couldn’t be, Tony couldn’t still be a virgin and that meant only one thing, that Colonel Rhodes had gotten there first. First, as in before Steve? Ridiculous line of thought, Steve didn’t have a snowballs chance in hell of getting into Tony’s pants. Not that he wanted to even. He had noticed that Tony was a very handsome guy but being a fellow alpha he had never considered.. Well alright, he hadn’t considered it very often, lets say.
“Hey!” He turned back and jogged the few steps to reach the land rover the medics were trying to pry Tony out of. “Hey! Let him go! It’s alright, let him..” The paramedics did, only for Tony to collapse onto the asphalt. Steve was there the next moment, forgetting about not touching Tony since the other man clearly needed it right now, smelling strongly of fear.
Tony whistled. “I don’t blame the R&D guys, though you said Dr Banner had been struggling to control it? What happens when he can’t control it?”
But I would like to try and finish what I started. Unfortunately, I have no clue if I'll be able to see this through. I mean I had planned this story to be a very long one, with an actual plot. And I ended up abandoning it before I could even get to the plot. Recently I have received some very bad news and I need my happy place. So I have been writing this again. Please read at your own risk because some plot is about to happen but I have no clue if I'll be able to actually finish this thing. I know a lot of people really hate reading WIP's and this one had a 3 year hiatus already. And I am expecting some turbulent times soon which will probably cause me to drop this story again. I just wanted to give a heads up before anyone invests any more time into reading this. I mean, it's not like you all don't know what's gonna happen anyway. But I'll try and keep the ride entertaining.  Cheers.
At that, the guy looked a little surprised, then calmly proceeded to place his glasses on the bridge of his nose and start taking out his notes.
Steve sighed. "I said language. And I mean it. For that, I'll have to wash your mouth out with soap."
