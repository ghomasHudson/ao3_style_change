Snapping her fingers, a black leather journal appeared. Holding it between her hands, her eyes glowed bright as she filled it with all the knowledge she had, knowledge her parents had taught her from mistakes they had once made. The Mark of Cain, the British Men of Letters, the Darkness were but a few things she covered. Even Zanna. A few had disclaimers on them, including how to close the gates of hell, but only if the person was willing to die for the cause. There were even notes on who to trust. Rowena to some extent, don’t trust Crowley at anything he says or does without thoroughly double checking all the facts first, including what the repercussions would be. How they should seriously consider taking out Metatron and try giving Gadreel a second chance to prove himself.
She frowned as she looked at both men. After everything that her family had told her over the years, perhaps this was better than what she had planned. She rolled her eyes Heaven-ward. Mysterious ways, her butt.
allies hadn’t been born yet. She would have to find and convince the people who she had known to help her family. Jody, Donna, Charlie were the first to pop into her head. She knew she would have to talk with Castiel about recruiting Balthazar eventually. She had always enjoyed the stories of the flamboyant, Titanic-hating angel her Father had told.
Meant to say a big thank you to the lovely and awesome VampAmber for bothering to read the first draft of this and all my writings.
She shouldn't tell him, tell them that part yet, even when they found out the rest. She shouldn't, yet the urge to spill everything hovered at the tip of her tongue. The admittance was held off as the door to the hotel room opened and someone she hadn't seen since his death stepped into the room. Her heart jumped to her throat. Now wasn't the time to dwell on something that might not come to pass. She forcibly held back her human emotions.
That thought brought up more questions. When had he died? When had Sam? Who was her mother? Her older brother? Dean's mind brought up an image of Lisa and Ben. It would certainly explain Bertie's hair color.
"Woah, woah, woah. You can't just go changing history. I learned that lesson the hard way." Dean argued, waving his hands in anger.
At one point in her speed cleaning Bertie had broken down crying. She had hovered in front of the door that had been Jack’s. Or one day would be. Then again if she succeeded in her time here, he might never be born at all. She sucked in a shuddering breath. She could still see him as both alive and vibrant, and broken, bleeding and unmoving after Michael had killed him. Had slaughtered him.
"That means..." Surprising everyone present, Dean's sentence cut off as he fell backwards, blacking out.
“You’re Mikey’s vessel, Dean-o. Just like Sam here is Luci’s.” Gabriel stated woodenly. There was no emotion, he couldn’t spare any at the moment, still absorbing what Bertie was saying to him, to them. “They will wear you to the prom apocalypse and bring on the end of the world.”
Dean took a second to center himself. No one grabs food from his plate, with the exception of Sammy. But the action had come second nature to her, that it wasn't the first time she had done that. "Why not just kill her?"
“Sonofabitch! Will you stop doing that!” Dean grumbled as he attempted to wipe up the spilled beer from his chin and plaid shirt. Papers floated wildly around Bobby’s living room, having gone off like a paper cannon explosion when the angelic nuisance appeared. Looking up he saw that it wasn’t Castiel but Bertie who had flown in unannounced.
“Castiel.” Uriel addressed his wayward brother. His normal cold told gave nothing away as to what this was regarding.
"I'm showing him what is to come. I'm showing him what he will have to live with for eternity if he doesn't allow me to change this," she answered calmly. "I'm showing him... your death."
Which was disappointing, but at least it was more of a step in the right direction. He stared down at them a few moments more, seeing beyond to their souls. Gabriel smiled softly. Little Castiel’s soul was growing strong, and Dean’s was at peace. The archangel hadn’t been aware at how the human’s soul was at war with itself. Apparently having Castiel return his feelings settled something within the grumpy hunter.
Finally he left his brother alone, ruminating on all he said, unaware that the creature in his arms was ruminating all the same.
"Because she needed to be taken off the board. She was nothing but trouble Sam and you know it!" He had no regret about killing the she-demon behind his brother's back. He would do it again in a heartbeat if asked.
for killing his friend. Sure he knew Ruby was… had been a demon, but that didn’t mean that he forgot how she had helped him after Dean had died. Hell, he would have died if not for her. How dare his brother think that he can just go around killing like that? Without talking to him about it?
Sam walked back over to them. As much as he wanted to learn of this new shelter, he was much more interested in learning more of his own family history. “Henry Winchester? He was a Man of Letters? I thought they were just a myth.”
“Shut up!” The blond man commanded, before turning to address the other two. “Hannah, you and Inias take the woman. I’ll deal with the Winchester child and prepare him for Michael.”
When Gabriel had agreed to help him with his now screwed beyond belief assignment, Coop almost cried with relief. Up until he heard Gabriel’s reasons.
“No time Sammy. Gotta go!” Dean zipped the bag shut harshly. He was too worked up to be concerned about his brother’s feelings. He needed to be on the road asap. A thought came to him suddenly. “You did bring the impala back in one piece right? I don’t really have time to go fixing it right now.”
She stood straighter, adjusting her shoulders to deliver the news. She really didn't like being called kid, especially since she was pretty sure that she was the same age as her Dad at the moment. "I came to save my family. I came to save the universe."
“So you want me to help you help those chucklehead Winchesters stop the apocalypse. The same apocalypse you claim I died in the first time around? Ha!” Gabriel shook his head disbelieving. Taking a moment to scratch the top of the terrier’s head, he sighed. “Look I feel for you kid. I do. But I just can’t get involved. Michael and Luci need to fight this out for themselves…”
Tossing the empty bottle, he nearly hit Castiel as the angel appeared in front of him. He studied the trench-coated angel. “She telling the truth, Cas? Michael going to try to wear me to the Angel Ball?”
, 2008," the date didn't come out of his mouth easily. Where was this woman from that she had come to them? For that matter, why them?
She sighed, taking a deep breath. Rubbing the back of her neck, nervously, she said. “Father should be here for this.”
“Wow. Way to kill a boner, Samsquatch.” Gabriel sank back, though his eyes lingered briefly on the hunter’s lips. He should have known that prayer was too good to be true. He had to admit that he had had some issue with getting the younger Winchester off his mind. He tended to get off with him on his mind, but that was neither here nor there. Wait, where was he? Oh right. “So baby blue eyes is missing, huh? You try praying?”
He pressed play, settling the phone against his ear. Dean almost dropped the phone at what he heard.
Sam left unsaid. He cleared his throat. "But might I suggest a shower and clean clothes first? You know, before heading out into the drunken masses? You can wear some of those new clothes we got for you."
“What the fuck?” Angrily, Dean pointed at the blond pagan standing in Bobby’s living room. He had a smirk on his face when he noticed the elder Winchester’s reaction. “What the hell is this asshat doing here? And what the hell happened to Sam?”
“Why aren’t you more upset?” Sam asked. While he and Castiel may not have been extremely close, Sam still felt the loss of his friend. “He is -was your father. Why are you so calm?”
echoed through the house. She barely noticed as her companions shifted awkwardly behind her. She snorted quietly at the imagery. Angel on one shoulder and Winchester at the other.
once. Having their home almost overrun by flying monkeys was something she hadn’t quite believed before visiting there herself. But that was a story for another time. “Follow me.”
before Bertie swung another door open. It led to the metal staircase she had spent the better part of her childhood running up. At the balcony, the brothers stood gaping at the rooms below them. It wasn’t anything that they had been expecting. Sam immediately noticed the library, his face lighting up.
Bertie leaned against the wall by the door, supporting herself as she caught her breath. "I healed him. You're welcome."
Now he was tied to a chair in some dark, dank abandoned warehouse. They had started with beating him, expecting him to fall in line with what they wanted. Just let them open the seals in peace and they’d let him go.
With the distraction the move and discovering the hidden aspects of the Men of Letters bunker it provided no one had immediately noticed when Castiel had initially disappeared. It had been the general consensus that he was back up in heaven doing some heavenly mission like stopping more seals from breaking. But whenever he had done so before he had at least gotten around to answering Dean’s prayers eventually. Immediately if and when possible.
“Your name is Gabriel? Little froo-froo ain’t it?” Clearly Dean was forgetting to used his brain-to-mouth filter again.
Bertie closed her eyes, memories flashing behind the lids. Seeing her Dad, his laughing green eyes turn cold as Michael took control. Years of him taunting her and her Father and Jack, telling them how Dean was slowly dying inside him, loosing his fight for freedom. She had cried so hard when finally Michael laughed and told them Dean was dead, that he wouldn’t be in Heaven.
The night had been hell. Dean took a sip from his beer, staring out at the stacks of cars in Bobby’s lot. The full moon and cloudless night made it easy for him to see everything. But all he could see at the moment was his daughter crying. She had been through hell, and he could relate.
Sam watched as Bertie went over to the window. He couldn’t keep the smirk off his face when she yelled.
! Those two have been written in the stars since Dad created them! Won’t take much to get those two idiots together.”
"Where's Dean?" Castiel, former angel and current Netflix aficionado, set his plate aside after finishing the sandwich his friend had brought him. He never realized how much food had tasted like molecules when he was still angelic. He was very thankful that he could fully appreciate peanut butter and jelly sandwiches now.
“Nope. No. I’m still dreaming.” The writer took a swig of the booze, shaking his head nervously. “This is just part of my new novel. That’s all. Just a drunken stupor, my plot running off by itself. It does that you know. Wait. Why am I even talking to you? It’s pointless. Pointless.”
. After the Righteous Man broke the first seal, we all know what would happen. What should have happened. There was an order that was supposed to follow. An order that had been set in motion since before the dawn of man.” Zachariah clapped the back of Castiel’s neck tightly, using his grace to inflict pain on the Seraph. Castiel’s face remained impassive, despite the pain he felt. Zachariah continued, “But now
She caught him looking, and knew that she would have to tell him something. Sending back her answer,
There was so much she wanted for them to know, so much she wished she could share with her family, to be there with them, but deep in her grace she knew what needed to happen.
“Cas! Cas, are you okay?” Dean shouted. His heart raced at seeing how his angel had been treated. This wasn’t exactly the reunion he wanted them to have if Cas was lucky enough to be brought back.
Gabriel allowed her to talk, using his powers to make sure they weren’t disturbed. Once she was finished, he snapped his fingers making all three bodies vanish. No stains of burnt wings tarnished the pristine floor. With a quick tap to her head, he erased her memory and disappeared in a blink.
Feeling the pressure of tears pushing forward, Dean forced them away. His chest ached and his breath was shallow. He couldn’t deal with this right now. Or ever. How was he supposed to deal with his best friend gone, now, after they had gotten so close? Dragging his hand down his face, he located his phone across the room on his desk. Grabbing it, he saw that the voicemail was from an unknown number.
“One of the perks of free will, the ability to change Fate. And there are too many possible futures for even Me to keep track of. So who are you?” Chuck asked again.
Castiel had been standing guard, leaning against the floral covered walls. He frowned as they arrived. He had spent the last day looking in the Heavenly archives, trying to find precedence for Bertie. There was none. She had already changed the course of what Michael and Lucifer had begun. "Where have you been?"
Bertie just raised a brow and exited the impala. She didn’t wait for the others as she rushed up to the front door. She pressed her finger to the bell, the
This is a lot darker than I meant for it to be. (Still not as dark as I've read out of other stories, but for me dark af)
'Uncle Sammy' wasn't something he had ever expected to be called, at least not for several more years if at all. He especially wasn't expecting it to come from someone who looked like she was older than he was.
He had returned to the room to find a stranger with his brother and Bobby. Before he was even able to ask who she was, she spoke and all hell broke loose.
Sam’s eyes widened. He turned to his niece. “I thought he wasn’t going to help? He said he doesn’t step in.”
The question threw the hunters. It wasn't what they had been expecting. Dean recovered faster than his mentor, it wasn't the first time he had encountered something like this after all. He just wasn't sure why it was happening so close to him coming back from his own trip to the past. Was this something that he would have to deal with on a regular basis now that he was back from Hell?
Dean couldn't figure out what the angel's problem was. So what if he had been shown Dean's death long into the future. It was actually nice to know that Dean would get to live that long, longer than he ever thought he would get. He figured that he wouldn't make it past 35 in all honesty. So why was Cas freaking out? After he had pulled his hands away from his head, he had given Dean a panicked look, and disappeared without so much as a by your leave. Dean would have thought he was being a rude dick if he hadn't been kinda worried about the angel.
“How do you, uh, feel about that? The fact that we’re, you know?” Dean gestured with his hand helplessly. He really hoped that the normally clueless angel understood what it was that he was trying to say.
“I really thought he would help after everything I showed him.” Bertie sighed, defeated. If Gramps didn’t bring her Father back soon, time would settle, and she would disappear. She looked up to her uncle. Hopefully, she had already done enough to change the Winchester history for the better. “Come on. Dad will still want to kick our asses for taking the Impala. Might as well get it over with.”
Castiel moved closer before sitting next to Dean on the hood of the Impala. “I don’t know. I hope so. The things she’s said… It’s unprecedented.”
Bad ideas swirled rapidly, one in particular, when Gabriel muttered a response to the waiting cupid. “What about him indeed?”
She shook her head. She tried to move but she was held in place firmly by an invisible force. “No. Lucifer will rise. I will be the one to do it.”
But for the first time in eons he stretched his senses, looking for a specific person. His wings flexed in anger at what he found. He disappeared with a snap of his fingers, choosing for the first time in forever to step into danger.
"Drink up. You're gonna need it. Little missy here came back to save the whole dang universe." Bobby finished off his own as he frowned at the room at large.
Sam froze at her approach. Somehow she knew. He didn't know how but she did. His fists clenched at his side as she stepped right up into his face.
Sam gaped as his brother passed out, falling hard to the dirty motel carpet. The woman rushed to his side.
“The prophet?” Gabriel perked up from the back seat. Of course he knew of the prophet. As soon as the man had been tapped up for the job as the next Prophet of the Lord, Gabriel had known. He had felt the connection to protect, as all the Archangels felt. It didn’t explain why they were here to see him though. “You think that just because Dad gives him visions or whatever, Chuck can get a hold of the big guy? Doubtful.”
Dean wandered over to Bobby's fridge, taking out the fixings to make a sandwich. It had been almost a day since Bertie had appeared. Initially she had offered to zap them to Bobby's house with a snap of her fingers, but Dean had refused. He needed time to think, to process everything that she was claiming. Bertie was Dean's daughter. Sam was working with demons and sucking down their blood like a fucking vampire. Bobby didn't want to get involved. And as for Castiel...
Blue in the face, Sam had to choke back his laughter. Dean’s face was bright red, eyes wide in stunned silence. What had gotten into the angel? Where had he even heard those lines?
Castiel breaking the news that Bertie was his child as well was not well received. Especially by Dean. For now though he was choosing to ignore the information until absolutely necessary.
- she was supposed to be. The plan had been to only go back a few months, a year at most. But looking at the man holding a gun to her, she knew she had messed up. But with the universes clashing against each other the way they were back in her time, something was bound to have gone wrong. Jack had warned her the dangers. She didn't care, not if it meant saving everything.
Sam grabbed his brother by the shoulder, halting him in his tracks. “Dean, slow down. Where are you going?”
Another angel appeared, grace blinding as he joined them. He clapped a hand on Uriel’s shoulder. Castiel’s own stance turned rigid as Zachariah spoke with an ounce of amusement. “Oh, don’t pay any attention to Uriel here, Castiel. Not every angel can be so… What’s the word?
It was the middle of the night when a piercing call rang out over the wavelengths of ‘Angel Radio’, as Dean was wont to call it. No matter how many times Castiel tried to dispel the Winchester’s use of that term, for it was far more intricate a system than simple radio, Dean still persistent as only a hunter could. The seraph was close to getting lost in his own thoughts of the elder Winchester when the call rang out again, far harsher than before. His daughter was gone for the moment, but he knew she would be back soon. Without saying anything to the sleeping hunters in Bobby’s house, Castiel spread his wings and left, appearing a moment later in front of his brother-in-arms.
They all saw the moment it hit him. He shook his head, denial mode in full effect. “No. No. NO! He can’t do this. They can’t do this!” He screamed, guttural and horrific and heartbreaking.
“Yes Sam. I’ve tried praying, I’ve tried calling. I’ve left voice mails and texts. He’s not answering.” Dean was growing more agitated the longer the conversation left him with no answers.
Even though Gabriel couldn’t really show it in this form, he grinned. He had the younger Winchester chasing him, towel slipping dangerously low. Ahead of him were the other two idiots. Going for broke he ran straight at them, knocking purposefully into his own brother. The sudden impact sent Castiel reeling into Dean’s arms. He didn’t have time to enjoy the aftermath as he bounced off Castiel’s legs and skidded into the wall. He whimpered as the impact knocked the wind from him.
Beyond him a pair of angels stood sentry over Castiel. The trench coated angel hung limply between them, bruised and beaten and bloody. He had been caught off guard, attacked with no remorse by his brothers almost immediately after his return. He was weak but he could still feel his power coming back, and more power than he was used to.
Now Sam on the other wing, poor soul, had lost several potential soul mates to death in his young life. First Jessica being killed by a demon, Madison out of necessity from going bad as a werewolf, Sarah had been killed by Crowley. Even his first "girlfriend" Amy had been killed by his brother.
"Killing her... her death is the final seal. We need to banish her before it gets to that point." She wiped off her mouth with the back of her sleeve. Bertie stretched and pushed back from Bobby's table. "So you in?"
He couldn't lose his wings. He just couldn't. He had seen how much humans struggled. He knew he wouldn't be able to handle it.
Groaning, Dean reached for his phone, slapping his hand against the nightstand. He frowned when he didn’t find it in its usual spot. The buzzing stopped then beeped alerting him to a new voicemail. He rolled to his side before sitting up. Man, he was dizzy, feeling completely out of it. Hungover in body and spirit. More than when he had to use angel mojo express. Speaking of…? When did he make it back to his room? He recalled coming back to the bunker after the hunts with Sam and Bertie, and then Gabriel showing up and then…
Bertie sighed. “Long story short…” She went on to explain as quickly as possible the entire situation. From everything she had been told of Gabriel, she was surprised that he was able to keep quiet the entire time.
The archangel turned to Bertie, raising a brow. “Now I get that you want to prevent the apocalypse, and kudos for that. But, you haven’t really told us what happens if we don’t stop it.”
"Not quite. But good to know that I still got it." The Messenger appeared in front of the young cupid. Young enough that Gabriel was certain that he hadn't been created yet when he left Heaven. "What's your name kid?"
Bertie did something unexpected, grabbing the deity’s hand and bringing it to her head. Chuck’s eyes widened as he saw her future, the universe she came from, the destruction His firstborns had wrought to His creation. He saw her creation as well, knew why He had brought her into being. Releasing her finally he glanced at the two standing at her side.
Those brothers were what many a Cupid's nightmares were made of. If they had nightmares that is. Or the capability of sleep. Even the monsters of the world, underworld and purgatory feared the famous hunters. But their reasons weren't the reasons that made this Cupid hesitant.
After Sam had been old enough to help out with conning at the bar and pool halls, Dean had stopped sleeping with men. He glanced at the blue eyed angel beside him, considering. Dean had to admit, Castiel was certainly attractive. At least his vessel was. Clearing his throat, Dean’s eyes went back to scanning the lot. “So this future she showed you…”
Dean was confused. “His vessel? What, did the dicks upstairs expel him from his meat-suit or something? Can’t you just put him back?”
Sam yanked the candy from his mouth, but didn’t bother removing Gabriel’s wandering hand. “Oh yeah? What could possibly be her idea then?”
There had been a small part of her that wished she could have been able to stick around longer, to help her family turn the tide further. She should have guessed that the universe would want to correct the mistake of having her there. Perhaps there was a way to still help even when she was gone?
“Those,” Bertie pointed with her hatchet. “Those are ghouls. They are the kids of the ghoul that got ganked back when John Winchester first came through town.”
"Not a demon or shifter then." The younger man, Dean, clicked the safety back on his gun. He kept it lowered only slightly. "So what you some kind of angel dick bag too?"
“No dogs in the car, Dean.” Sam sassed with a grin. “This isn’t the car. Deal with it. I’m keeping him.”
So even though I got to work in the morning I still stayed up late to write this chapter for you guys! Lucky you!
“Oh I know who you are Gabriel. And I gotta say, little disappointed by some of the things you’ve done.” Chuck stood up. In a blink he changed into jeans, a red button down shirt and green army jacket, similar to his son’s own attire. “But like I said… I don’t know who
“Now what?” Sam asked, not noticing the look Gabriel and Bertie gave each other. In a blink they were gone. Two seconds later he heard Chuck yelp from inside the house. He grinned. Letting himself inside, he found the others in the living room. Chuck was scrunched down in a broken recliner, clutching a bottle of whiskey. Bertie and Gabriel stood in front of him, mirroring each other with arms crossed.
Bertie smirked, then let out some Winchester sarcasm. “I did do my chores Dad. Dusted and everything.”
"Uh, actually, Bobby... Castiel may have sent me back to the 70's last week." Dean laughed, running his hand across his face, then over his hair. Bobby eyes widened at the statement. This was the first he was hearing about this. "It was all feathered hair and porn 'staches."
Well now that Sammy had left the safety of the Impala, Dean couldn’t just drive away and leave him behind. Reluctantly, he got out of the car, slamming his own door in frustration. Dean snorted. He would give the place five minutes before calling Bobby that this was a complete waste of time. Maybe he could get back early enough to try to get a hold of Cas again. Dean swore he was tired of playing angel phone tag. Or
I know you all know I like to angst but I would permanently kill any of these boys... for good anyway.
There, tangled within the limbs of the foliage and covered in mud, was a dog. A corgi to be precise.
She paused not really knowing where to start. How far back should she begin her tale? Finally she decided. “I’m not going to go through the past forty some years. Let’s just say that the highlights include demon deals, Dad becoming a demon when he took on the Mark of Cain…”
“Let her go!” Adam cried out. He tried to jerk himself away from the suited fucking mook with the impossible vice grip. No more than ten minutes ago three jackasses in power suits appeared magically in the Milligan’s living room, grabbing both Adam and his mother Kate. He shouted as he tried to fight back. He swung a punch, landing it across the jaw of one of them. His fist cracked hitting the cement filled jaw. Adam shouted out in pain. “What the hell do you want?”
of his feet hitting the trail path put him into a trance as he ran his usual route from the bunker. It was a path he followed almost every day when the Winchesters were home in Lebanon. No matter how much Dean teased him about it, Sam would always find enjoyment in exercise.
"From the sound of it when he called, he's probably getting into all kinds of hell down at the bar." Sam spoke without thinking. When Dean had called it had sounded like he had been getting a little too friendly with some biker's girlfriend. Sam wasn't too concerned though, Dean had taken on worse for years.
Okay I'm ignoring the end of 14. Prefer the nice version of Chuck. Also this chapter seriously ran away from me but I'm cool with it.
It had been over a week since Cas had just disappeared from Bobby’s, and less than that since they had fist ventured to the bunker. Or as Dean had taken to calling it: The Batcave. The move into the bunker had been fairly painless and quick. Bertie had done the bulk of the move, using a simple snap of her archangel mojo put everything away. Bobby decided to stay at his home, but most of his library got transferred over for safe keeping.
Who was this hunter's soul mate? Cupids weren't always told who the match would be, if ever, but sometimes they could sense the proximity. This man's was very close. As a general rule Cupid's were only sent on assignment if the subjects were soon to be near their matches.
Bertie released her angel blade, the weight of it dropping into her hand. “Come on. We’ve got work to do.”
“But I hit Castiel with the arrow instead of Dean! How am I supposed to find his soulmate now?” the cupid whined. If he had blood pressure, Coop was sure it would be rising.
“Right.” Dean couldn’t stop his disappointment from coloring his voice. He shouldn’t feel so let down. It wasn’t as though they were going to jump into anything because their daughter from the future had time warped into their lives. “Of course.”
Cupid # x2π75L still couldn’t believe his luck! Not only had he been caught messing up again, but he had been caught by an archangel. Not just any archangel, oh no. One who had died.
“They did fight it out. When I’m from the universes are collapsing on each other because of it. Michael…he… he destroyed my family. Destroyed the world. If I can’t even
Also I may have started this chapter several different times. Then I looked over every version this week and realized they could be Frankenstein'd together. TBF I mainly wanted to put in corgi!Gabe.
Sam shot his friend a surprised look. It had been a long time since he had seen him wear anything other than a blanket fort. Heck, it had even been a while since he had seen the former angel make an effort on
It's been forever, I know I know.  Writer's block plus depression sucks. But here ya go... Have some angst.
Castiel looked at both his charge and the woman, tilting his head in confusion. He didn't know who this woman was, or what this woman was. For all appearances, even to his angelic eyes, she was human. But no human would have been able to purge the demon blood from a host the way she had. No angel either. Only an Archangel or God would be able to accomplish such a feat. He needed to test her, to see if she could hear him. He sent out a question over angelic wavelengths.
Turning back, Sam sighed. “No, Dean, you won’t. It’s a choice, and right now you’ve chosen to be miserable. With our job, our entire
“Wait! What do you mean ‘help Sam’?” For the first time since they started talking, Gabriel was invested in something she was saying.
First and foremost she had planned on getting the bunker set up. It would be a much better safe house than Bobby’s, though the library wasn’t nearly as impressive as the old hunter’s. Her plan was though to add all of Bobby’s collection to the space. Once she convinced them to move in that is.
Then there was the Big One. Getting him on their side, getting him to admit to who he really was to the Winchester’s this early in the game could change everything.
Sam’s bitch face activated. “I am. I just don’t want to see it if one of the men is my brother. That’s just gross.”
And now had been hit with an arrow earmarked for a Winchester. The Cupid began to panic as he watched his mistake unfold.
Coming into the room behind her uncle, Bertie looked worriedly at Dean. He was upset, but not the way they had left him. This was pissed off Dean. And an angry Dean Winchester was a dangerous one. “Dad?”
“Sammy, you should go change. I’ll go get Bobby. I don’t want you to have to repeat this if you don’t need to.” Dean left them waiting in the study as he went outside to collect the old hunter.
Also have decided to pull some more of season 13 into this. So I guess ?Spoilers? maybe? It's a time travel fix-it after all.
“Yoo-hoo! I never woulda guessed that straight-laced Sammy Winchester was such a little freak in the sheets. I’m impressed.” Gabriel winked cheekily at him.
Bertie rolled her eyes. “You’re right, Dad. I could have but then we would still be dealing with the first ghost hunt we did ‘cus you two would have still been digging up the graves.”
"Is this true?" he asked. She met his eyes as she sent him images of life in her time. He was knocked by the utter brutality, the fragility of it. Image after image, people he didn't know but could feel the connection she had to them, all dead. A young man with fire in his eyes protecting her and Dean and Sam. Protecting them all until the moment he couldn't. Sam dead on the ground, blood pouring out of a fatal wound. And then...
It hadn’t been until Bertie was a teenager that she had gotten the whole story from her Father. Including all the gruesome details of the man’s death that Dean had kept from her as a child.
He turned to Sam. Fuck the moose was in bad shape. He held a hand to the side of his face, pulling the knife out with his other hand. “This may hurt a bit, Samsquatch.”
The air grew thick with tension around them. Bobby decided to intercede. "Just what gives you the right to can just come in here and change the game?"
Dean sighed knowing he wasn’t going to be getting anywhere soon. Not without these two worrywarts wasting his time. Digging his phone out of his back pocket, he pressed play on the voicemail app.
“Look, I can barely help myself so whatever you’re selling I’m really not interested.” Chuck interrupted tiredly, and closed the door on them.
“Why should I…” Sam choked on his lackluster refusal when two sets of eyes landed on him. No matter that Dean hated his sad dog eyes, Sam had to learn it from someone. Clearly it had been taught to the next generation as well. Puppy eyes in stereo was not something he had the power to ignore. Throwing his hands up, he exclaimed. “Fine! He’s not going to come you know, but here goes nothing.”
Tossing a couple bills down on the counter, he paid for their next round and closed out his own tab. Nodding his thanks once more, he left ignoring the interested looks from many of the female (and male) patrons.
The Trickster stepped forward, knowing there was nothing these Winchesters could do to him. His grace shivered a bit as Sam’s gaze shifted to him again. Keeping his focus on the elder brother, he started. “Listen Dean-o, here’s the shorted long of it. Sammich got captured and tortured by Demon Bitch numero uno, and we rescued him. Beatrice here healed him.”
“It’s Sam, not Sammy,” the tall man responded coldly. In a matter of seconds he somehow towered over the archangel even more than he had been already, towering and intimidating. And if Gabriel hadn’t been the ginormous celestial wavelength of intent that he was, he might have felt threatened.
"You stupid sonofabitch," Bertie stood and took a step closer to her uncle. "I mean, I was told the stories but I just thought Dad had exaggerated. There was no way that my uncle Sammy, the man who taught me how to hotwire a car when I was 10, would have ever done something so fucking stupid!"
Speaking of pets, Trickster currently sat at his feet watching him curiously. That mutt’s stare irked him to no end. If Dean didn’t know better he would have thought that the dog understood him, was studying him. He needed to somehow get Trickster away from Sammy long enough to run the gambit of tests. Maybe then he wouldn’t feel this weird around the ‘dog’. For now though, Dean tossed down a piece of the roast beef for him. Trickster glanced between the meat and the man, unimpressed by the offering. He huffed, then moved over to Sam at the table. The giant Winchester took the hint and lifted him onto his lap.
Bertie grinned. She patted her uncle’s shoulder, healing all of the injury’s he has sustained that day. Sam smiled in thanks. After healing her Dad -Dean still remained grumpy- she asked, “Who’s hungry?”
“Gramps…We need your help,” she begged, ignoring both questions. Behind her Gabriel and Sam gasped. “Everything you created will end. Everything. The universe will collapse on itself and the only thing that will be left… Will be you. You will be alone. Completely alone.”
While her family was dealing with the backlash of emotions her presence had caused, Bertie had other things occupying her time. And none of it was particularly easy to deal with when it was just her having to do it all.
Pale blue eyes widened, blood shot from booze and lack of sleep, as Chuck saw who was standing on his front porch. His robe hung open over his dirty tank and boxers. “C-can I help you?”
She cleared her throat, looking around at all of them. “This is hard for me. Some of you have been dead for years. Some of you I watched die, I couldn’t save you.”
“You aren’t dreaming. This isn’t the Winchester Gospel. This is you needing to own up to who you are.” Bertie knelt at his side. She searched his face for the Grandfather she knew. “Who you
“What’s his name Sam?” Castiel interrupted Dean’s rant before it gained full speed. He moved to scratch behind the pup’s ear.
Waving his hand, the Cupid marked the target's heart. Job done, he clapped his hands. Before he could go search for the older Winchester, a very tall man entered the room, carrying a plate of food with him. The tall man smiled as he set the tray down in front of the man huddled on the bed. "Hey Cas. Thought you might be hungry," he said with a smile.
Between the demon detox on his brother, the trench coat wearing angel having a breakdown, and a daughter time traveling from the future... Well, let's just say that Dean was done.
“What the-!” Sam and Dean shouted out at the same time as a pair of angels appeared behind the two hunters, capturing them. They pressed their angel blades pressed against the hunters throats. Bertie’s eyes narrowed on the small droplet of blood gliding down her uncle’s neck. She turned on Michael.
"This is for your own good," her voice was soft as she spoke. Before Sam could even blink Bertie's hand was on his forehead, bringing him to his knees with her power. Somewhere he could hear his brother yelling. He didn't know until later that he and Bobby had been held back, unable to stop Bertie. The pain was intense, a cauterizing of his entire being, his soul. Someone was screaming, he knew it couldn't just be him. What lasted an eternity of only five seconds Bertie released her grip, and Sam fell to the floor unconscious.
“Well, A: God brought back Castiel. Like seriously, how is that not obvious?” Bertie rolled her eyes. She manifested her archangel blade, dropping the twisted celestial metal into her hand. “And two? I’m Bertie. Short version, I’m here to stop the end of the world.”
Being an "essential worker" during 2020 sucked ass (and not in the fun way). I totally forgot that I had even written this chapter.
"Please. I wish my problem was as simple as stopping the apocalypse. The stories my Father told me about it..." she laughed. She tilted her head as she thought. "Perhaps I could..."
As much as Dean was pissed that they had taken Baby, he couldn’t bring himself to care. He needed to be alone, needed the time to grieve. He had lost his best friend, his angel, and there was nothing that could change the inevitable. Whatever foolish plan that Bertie had, that she believed could be done to bring back the angel, Dean knew it was pointless. Nothing could bring Cas back. Not even God.
He offered to help with the Impala’s maintenance. Dean had visibly flinched. Sam was proud of his brother however when he found the pair an hour later leaning under the hood, side by side, covered in grease. Dean seemed to be giving Cas a lesson in the basics of taking care of Baby. The same one Sam had been given.
Frowning, Castiel considered his friend's words. Tentatively, he lifted his arm, taking a sniff. He cringed. "That may not be the worst suggestion ever."
The man was sitting in the dark, wrapped in several blankets, staring unblinking at the television screen. The sight was not what he expected of the strong hunter, the one who had fought off Lucifer himself. The Cupid frowned at the dejected expression on the hunter's face.
“Well, well, well…” Gabriel scratched at his chin. “I may not recognize those wings but I sure as heck know Dad’s handy work. Who are you?”
"This isn't the first time you messed up though is it?" Gabriel asked already knowing the answer. The cherub shook his head. Leave it to the Winchester's to mess something up without knowing they had. "Don't worry kid. We can fix this."
His looked up in the shower, ignoring the water splashing his face, to take in the view. Sam was rinsing off his hair, arms raised, muscles ripped and soapy. Gabriel had to admit that this had to be in the top five best showers he had ever had. There hadn’t even been any hanky-panky happening. Just the large hunter cleansing him gently and with more care than the Trickster had ever been given.
The impala rolled to a stop. Dean was going to be super pissed that they had left with it, but they wanted to be certain that he remained at the bunker. Bertie had made sure that when she knocked him out he would be asleep for at least ten hours, leaving plenty of time for them to drive off in their search. And since the angels didn’t need to sleep, they would be driving straight through.
"Let's see. She got Sam addicted to demon blood, lied to him that he was the only one who could kill Lilith, systematically is breaking the seals so that Lucifer goes free."
Sam had a difficult time not laughing as he watched his brother trying not to loose it and yell at the new human. The kitchen was Dean’s domain after all. He hated seeing it get destroyed, however minor the damage. Castiel’s sorrowful blue eyes went a long way to calm the older Winchester.
"What the hell did you do to him?" Lifting his gigantic brother into his lap, he checked for any signs of injury. The woman may claim she's his daughter, but he didn't know her, didn't trust her. And what the hell was with that power?
“One thing is for sure; Michael is an asshole. And he is wearing your brother.” The brothers paused at that. Taking a deep breath, Bertie knew what she would have to do. She couldn’t let her family get hurt anymore. “That is going to make things even more difficult.”
"Why are you here? You shouldn't be here." Castiel's vessel was shaking. Were these emotions? It wasn't something he had ever before experienced, not to this extent. Perhaps it had to do with the fact he didn't know how to feel about what she had just sent him over angelic communication.
And who exactly are you? I was only anticipating the Winchester’s to be here. No matter. Sorry but no unexpected guests.”
” Dean whimpered, held firm in the angel’s grip. His gaze shot to the other man’s lips. Castiel’s tongue snuck out to wet the chapped skin. Dean swallowed. Before he could stop himself, he leaned forward and captured the angels lips with his own.
So this chapter is kind of all over the place but it really is going to be setting up soooooo much for later parts.
“We wouldn’t have called you otherwise, jackass.” Dean hated this. It was worse than getting his teeth pulled by that pagan anti-Klaus couple.
grace within her. And not just any grace, it wasn’t his or Lucifer’s or Raphael’s or even Gabriel’s. This was her own. How was that even possible? “You-? You’re a-?”
“We aren’t asking you too, just for one small miracle. Bring Cas back. Bring back my Father. Please.” Bertie pleaded.
“It’s Bertie,” Dean growled out, correcting the shorter man. The Trickster could insult him and be rude to him all he wanted, but he
In a rage, Jack had finally ended Michael, but not without Michael ending him as well. The rifts between the worlds had grown exponentially by then but the energy Jack gave off when his grace exploded… There were no words.
“No need to get snippy. Nice to know that I’m still part of the ‘last resort’ group. But we learn and move on. Let me see what I can find.” Before any of them could add anything, Gabriel snapped his fingers and was gone.
Gabriel couldn’t believe how well this had worked. He had hoped that Sam might want to rescue him, maybe even want to feed him. He hadn’t expected this.
“Raspberries.” Gabriel looked at his terrier, Max. The small dog cocked his head, judging his owner. “Don’t look at me like. You don’t know what my family’s like. I can’t get involved.”
Bertie landed back in the bunker, unmoved by the weight of her Dad and Uncle. That had been an interesting run. In a matter of hours they had gone on a hunting spree, visiting several locations where there were known to be ghosts. She had memorized the hunts her family had gone on years before her birth, studying their journals as a child. They had gotten to a small hotel where the murderous ghosts of children liked to ‘play’. Then they had hit an old mansion that was once a speak-easy, destroying the vengeful owner and releasing the spirits he had held captive inside. There was even one that involved plague masks. She shuddered. That one had been quite disturbing. They had also managed to get in a few basic salt-n-burns in there as well.
"Still don't know why you wanted to lie to your brother like that. Kinda weird prank if you ask me." The man wasn't the brightest bulb in the box, but he had no issues with joining in a mild prank with a stranger.
Dean met his gaze. Might as well go for broke. Damn angel saw into his soul most days anyways. “I’m not against it Cas. But I can understand why you wouldn’t want this with me. I’m more trouble than it’s probably worth.”
The man practically radiated power, red from his pagan god side and pure gold from his archangel side. It was blinding to say the least. Even she had to blink at the brightness his wings held. Then a thought crossed her mind. She panicked. Originally she had meant to come here and appeal to his Trickster side, fool the god of mischief into helping end the war his brothers wanted to start. That wasn’t going to work, because if she could see
“I’m sure, Gabriel. I’d be a massive hypocrite if I did have a problem with it.” When the shorter man gave Sam a questioning look, he was slightly reluctant to explain. When his shaggy bangs fell into his eyes, he didn’t bother fixing it. A slight blush reddened his neck. “I may have had a couple of flings back in college. Frat parties, ya know?”
“Dean.” The angel clasped a hand over his left shoulder, over his mark. “Do you… Is that something you want? With me? That bond?”
Sam blinked, clearing his eyes of the tears. When he saw who was holding Lilith immobile, he whispered. “Trickster?”
Flexing her wings out protectively, she answered Dean. “He’s wearing your brother as a meatsuit. And from what I can tell he’s… Adam’s still in there.”
Sam froze beside the shorter angel. He wanted to reach out a comforting hand to Gabriel but wasn’t sure it would be welcome. Probably not the best time for it either, he thought. He did his best to remain as still as possible. Being a mere human in a room with two Archangels and
The trio spun around. Gabriel sagged against the library archway, weighted down though his face showed nothing. But Bertie could see it all. Gabriel’s wings drooped along the floor, trailing behind him. Their once glorious color, brighter than anything a human could imagine, was now dull, mourning. It was like having grown up watching nothing but HD television and then being forced to sit through an old black and white series where half the screen was skipping. Her breath caught.
"What?" Her thoughts weren't on what the man said, they were otherwise engaged. She knew intrinsically that something had gone wrong. She wasn't where -
Putting his feelers out, Gabriel’s grace pulled him to Castiel’s location. He frowned when he sensed the area. Well that hadn’t been there before. Gabriel was concerned that this was allowed.
He slammed the door shut to his room, blocking out the sound of his brother and angel talking downstairs. He ran a frustrated hand through his locks. Sam had to get out of here, he couldn’t be around his brother right now without causing Dean some serious harm.
“With ya in a minute Samsquatch.” He returned his golden gaze back to the bitch demon. Across the room, Bertie was handling the remainder of Lilith’s crew. “Now, Lilly-doll. I think it’s time you give up on this, don’t you?”
A duty that I take seriously.” In spite of all the unforeseen events in dealing with a future child, his new emotions regarding Dean, and a rogue archangel making himself a nuisance…yes. Yes, Castiel did take his charge of watching over the Winchesters seriously.
Dean chuckled. "Oh, I'm still wigged out, but no worse than finding out that angels were real. What do you need help with?"
The effort for both projects, the filing and human-Cas, was immense. Though it would go a hell of a lot easier if a certain jerk of a brother would help out, Sam thought bitterly.
"Fuck!" she shouted, then cringed. Bertie shot them a look as though expecting to be yelled at for the profanity. It wasn't any worse than what the hunters said; she did learn most of them from her Dad. Rubbing the back of her neck, she muttered under her breath. "At least it's after Hell."
The blond turned to look at them, and raised a considering brow. He pointed the blade at the female. “
"Of course, Uncle Sammy taught me how to hack into computers. My parents taught me different forms of fighting. My grandmother too."
He started to leave the room, deciding to eat out in the library, when his brother called out softly. “Sammy.. I.. I can’t.”
Dean sipped at the golden liquid, choosing his next words carefully. There was so much that he should be focusing on at the moment, but for the past few days he kept circling back to one fact. He and Cas were together in the future. Sure he had been with men before, most times because he had to. He never told Sam how he had been able to afford to feed him during those times when Dad was gone longer than he planned. He never told Sam how he had sold his body to truckers to keep food on the table.
She didn’t realize that she had started to cry until she was pulled into Dean’s arms. She had lost so much, her parents, her brother, her uncle and friends. She couldn’t allow them to die that way, not again. Not when she could stop it.
He had only been allotted two 'arrows' for this assignment, and it would continue to remain an open case unless Dean found and fell for his soul mate. Now what was he supposed to do? This was supposed to be a quick in and out job; find the target at home, tag them, then return. And he had screwed up. But the intel that he had been given was wrong, it wasn't his fault. He hadn't known that there was a third man living in the bunker. Or that said man was Castiel. All the Cupid could do now was wait and watch to see what would happen next.
Before he could step into the room, a brightness -blinding and horrible- appeared beneath the door. There was only one…
Sam’s stomach cramped from holding in his laughter by this point. He reached new levels of pain when he heard his brother’s answer.
“Fuck you,” he ground out through clenched teeth. Silently he sent out a prayer. Even though Castiel thought he was just the Boy With Demon Blood, Sam hoped he would come.
From his vantage point at the kitchen window, Gabriel whistled low. Curious as to what had caught the archangel’s attention, Sam wandered closer. Then he scrunched his face in disgust.
"She's as old as you are Dean. I don't think that that is going to go over too well," Sam pointed out.
"Ain't no such thing as time travel kid." Scoffing, Bobby took a long pull of his beer. Condensation ran down the side of the amber bottle.
For the week following Valentine’s Day, or as Dean liked to call it -Drifter Christmas-, Sam had to watch the unexpected yet painful attempts at flirting Castiel was using on Dean. It had started small, with the former angel standing a bit too close to Dean. Which, to be fair, was pretty standard for them. Then he offered to help Dean with the cooking. Castiel claimed that he wanted to be self-sufficient, which was a major step forward and an idea the Winchester’s supported wholly. It was great idea, really… In theory. But in the execution it resulted in breaking out the fire extinguisher for the first time since moving into the bunker.
Snapping her fingers again, she sent the journal to her dad’s desk. He wouldn’t likely find it until much later. Bertie sighed deeply. “Coming Dad!”
“Jack. My brother.” Bertie nodded. “He may have been born of Lucifer but he is pure Winchester. Was pure Winchester. When he was born he accidentally created a rift between universes. Michael came through with his armies. Lucifer thought he could fight him off if he had more power. He stole Jack’s grace, and kidnapped him, to keep taking it.”
Resigning himself that this was now the way things were, Bobby gestured with his bottle. "Well, get on with it. Tell us why you're here kid."
"We weren't hunting demons. We were hunting Ruby. She just happened to have like twenty other demons with her when we found her is all." Dean avoided his brother's gaze.
Dean, for example, was emotionally constipated, preferring to love 'em and leave 'em. Though the Cupid knew everything that Dean had had to sacrifice in his life and everything he had to do to raise and protect his younger brother over the years. The Cupid wasn't all that surprised on how he had turned out in all honesty.
“In a romantic bond? Both physical and emotional?” Castiel’s stoic demeanor was almost cold as he continued slowly. “While I’m not fully against the idea of such a bond, it seemed that our future selves had gone through much together before forming such a relationship. One that we currently do not have.”
“What do you mean, I said yes? Yes to what?” Dean frowned, unsure of what they were talking about. He wondered if this had anything to do with the work Heaven had wanted him for.
Sam didn't know what he had walked into. He had come back to the hotel after practicing with Ruby, attempting to sneak in so Dean hopefully wouldn't notice that he had been gone. Unfortunately the lights in the room had been on when he arrived. He felt stronger than he had when he had left as Ruby had thankfully given him a fill up on her blood. He felt stronger and more powerful than he had ever in fact. He had been able to exorcise the demon without killing the host. It was a win.
He took a bite out of his lunch, channeling Scooby-Doo as he attempted to get half of the thing in his mouth. It wasn't like he didn't have enough to worry about being back from Hell and the apocalypse and Lilith. He didn't need to deal with some future child too.
He glanced around the structured white walls, the created office atmosphere. Heaven had definitely been upgraded logistically since he had last been home. More streamlined business rather than cotton candy clouds. He snorted. His siblings may act like they disliked humans, but it seemed that they had no problem using their innovation when it suited them.
Now all of that hadn’t not been exactly normal behavior for the pair. What was strange was, as Sam turned to leave, he overheard something that stopped him in his tracks. Castiel, former angel of the lord, used a pickup line on Dean.
Sam’s mouth dropped open. Gabriel reached over and snapped. A giant grape sucker filled the gap. He and Bertie laughed as Sam tried not to choke on the unexpected sweet. He clapped a hand to Sam’s back, taking a second to rub it a moment. He had to admit the act was refueling his grace a bit. “Come on Buck-o. I’m pretty sure I know what our niece here is about to suggest.”
“What happened to Sam,” Sam said, rolling his eyes at his brother. “Is that Sam got captured by Lilith and some of her cronies.”
"Exactly. Just some father-daughter bonding time," Dean agreed. "Man, you should have seen it. Who trained you how to do that move you used on that one demon, spitfire?"
“Told ya, kid. Those two were meant to be. Was never gonna be difficult.” Except on Gabriel’s patience in dealing with Dean.
uncle? How come I’ve never met him?” Her young face had scrunched up in confusion. Dean had gone on to explain about his younger brother Adam in the PG-est terms he could manage.
“Dean, we haven’t been on any case in months. Not since Cas became human.” Sam knew he was going to push his brother’s comfort level with this, but it needed said. “And I’m pretty sure it’s for the same reasons I don’t want to take Trickster out on a case either.”
"We should test her, Dean." The older man passed a silver flask over to her. "You don't wanna be shot, you drink."
Sam glanced over from the section he was currently working through of the old cataloging system the MOL had in place. He closed the binder in his hands. He could tell that beneath the gruffness of Dean’s question, his older brother was worried. “You tried praying to Cas?”
“Don’t bother, kid. Dad never does anything he doesn’t want to. He’s always been content to ignore everything and watch as humanity screws itself over.” Gabriel said bitterly. “It’s all just a story to him, and Dad doesn’t do happy endings.”
“Doesn’t this mess up your timeline though? Are you going to start to fade away now that he’s dead?” Sam asked.
Coop materialized beside him. The cupid sighed happily at seeing the soulmates resting. Gabriel shot him a look, shrugging.
“It’s alright, Roberta. You can tell us.” Castiel spoke softly. He had seen some of what she went through when she had shown him Dean’s death.
“That’s what they tell me. And by they I mean Dad and the dumbasses that are my older brothers.” Gabriel gave an unnecessary bow. He snapped his fingers and a daiquiri appeared in his hand. Taking an enormous slurp, he kept his eyes on the taller Winchester. “Now before we get into what I’m doing here, I got some questions that need answering. And if I’m guessing correctly, you bozos want these answers too.”
Sam hated to admit that it took him so long to notice what was going on with his brother and their resident former angel. Not that he had been oblivious to the eye fucking that had been between the two of them for years. To be fair he had been more focused on organizing the bunkers files this week instead of helping Castiel adjust to being human now that he started showering again. Sam may have taken the opportunity to throw his bedding into the wash during that first one. The smell had begun to permeate out into the hallway. He shook his head. Who would have thought that the former angel could be such a binger?
He covered his eyes a moment, willing the visions away. He looked like he was about to cry when he dropped his hand and they were still standing there. “What do you want?” he cried out.
"Crap. Son of a biscuit!" The woman groaned out as she fell out of the closet of the dingy motel room. That hadn't gone as well as planned. Before she could adjust herself to her new surroundings the click of a gun's safety echoed in the room a mere second before the cold metal was pressed to her forehead. She looked up at the two men standing over her. "Balls."
“Shut up Dean!” snapped Sam. Turning to the blond, he looked at him for what was perhaps the very first time. “You’re Gabriel? The Gabriel? The Archangel.”
"Sure Coop. I always like messing with the Winchester's. Doesn't mean that messing with them can't also include helping them too." Linking his arm with the cherub, he made to snap his fingers. "Watch and learn kid."
And wasn’t that just the kicker? He still cared enough about the jackass not to see him hurt. Would be nice if his brother could feel the same.
“Hey! No! Where are you going?!!” Sam shouted as the dog shot off down the hallway. He really needed to come up with a name for the pup. He cursed himself that he hadn’t grabbed clothes to change into before his shower. Now look at him, running down the bunker, practically naked, chasing a dog that he hadn’t told his brother about yet. Yeah, Dean was going to kill him.
Blood dripped down his chin, nose broken, teeth cracked from what they had already done to him. Sam wheezed. He was sure some of his ribs were already broken. That didn’t stop Stunt Demon 2 and 3 from preceding onto breaking his fingers and legs.
Castiel turned him sharply to face him. Angrily, he growled out. “Do not belittle yourself in front of me Dean Winchester. You are the Righteous Man. You were created by my Father to bring about change on Earth. I am but a mere Seraph. If anything, I’m not worthy of you.”
That was the question wasn’t it? What about that flannel covered, mountain of a man? The man destined to help change Destiny? The man who had, frankly, captured Gabriel’s attention at their first meeting. He had known then that Sam was his big brother’s Vessel, destined to end the world as he knew it. He knew that he had lost any chance he had with Sam during that whole
“Oh really? If that’s the case, then how is it we were able to stop it?” Dean laughed, pointing his gun at the blond douchebag. “We shouldn’t have been able to if it was truly meant to happen. Maybe you read that fate book wrong, maybe you’re just an idiot. I don’t know. What I do know is, you’re gonna let my friend there go or I’m gonna gut shot ya. Capisce?”
“You named me Roberta Charlotte. You named me after your father, Bobby,” she nodded to Bobby, sitting behind his desk, flushed with embarrassment. “And after your sister. Well adopted sister. I never met her. Charlie Bradbury.”
Sam looked around. The sound came again, followed by a rustling in some bushes up ahead. Mentally kicking himself for not bringing any weapons, Sam moved towards it. Just because he was home didn’t mean he should drop his guard. Dean would kick his ass is he found out about this. Pushing some of the branches aside he blinked at what he found.
Again I stress that what happened is only TEMPORARY. But that might still take a few chapters. (runs and hides from the angry pitchfork wielding villagers.)
That gave Dean pause. Behind him Sam snorted and let out a relieved groan as he sagged into a chair at the war table. “She’s right. Pretty sure that whole archangel mojo she’s got to dig up graves in just a snap beats us digging in the rain for two hours. I will take muscle pain like this any day of the week just knowing we got those done that fast.”
She knew she needed to give him time to think everything over. Standing, she took a breath to tell him so, when she felt it. The panicked prayer reaching out to her.
But she knew her Dad well enough that he would believe jack shit yet. Hell, he had even warned her once about the dangers of traveling through time. But then people had died and the universes started pushing against each other and she had to throw caution to the wind. She finally was following her family's tradition of self-sacrificing for the greater good.
“Now, Castiel. I get the feeling that you know more about this situation than you’re letting on. And Michael wants answers. By any means necessary.” Zachariah gave a yank on Castiel’s hair, hard enough for even the seraph to cry out in pain.
Sam threw him a bitch-face, and shook his head. He couldn’t deal with his older brother sometimes. “Dean, seriously? Just give it a chance.”
