A gasp was startled from Dean’s lungs as Cas gave a demonstrative tickle between his ribs. For a valiant few seconds, he kept from laughing, straining forward halfheartedly to break free of Cas’ embrace. Cas’ fingers burrowing under his arms, however, made him fold forward with a snicker that turned into a symphony of chortles. “Cas!”
At the first part of the comparison, Dean had been about to retort, but the image of high-and-mighty angels building with kids’ tools made him curl forward in laughter he kept trapped in his chest by pressing his lips together on a grin.
When Dean tipped his head back from its place burrowed into Cas’ neck, the angel could see his intent was to tease him again, accuse him of being sappy once more. But, in the course of that movement, Dean must have changed his mind, because he instead pulled Cas over and on top of him, capturing the startled laughter from the angel’s lips in a kiss.
“That said,” Cas said, pulling back from the kiss equally breathless as the smiling but confused Dean under him, “now that I’m looking, I see I may have missed putting back a few freckles.” With his fingertips, Cas dotted an invisible constellation upon Dean’s cheeks, delighting as they warmed under his touch. “Do you mind if I fix that? Angel kisses, you know.”
Dean scrubbed a hand down his face to reign in his humor, leaning back into Cas’ arms once more with a crooked smile aimed at his partner. “Guess I was too big a deal to just chuck and pray for the best, huh?” He added, “Thank Chuck.”
Dean tried to cover the flush in his freckled cheeks by giving Cas a wink. “Don’t I know it, angel.” He curled forward again, this time prompted by Cas wiggling a chastising finger into his stomach.
“Or inside out,” Cas went on as though he wasn’t torturing his partner and enjoying every second of hearing him howl. He enjoyed just as much how Dean, undeterrable and unkillable, was putting up little fight to actually escape. It made Cas not feel so bad about what he was going to do next. “Or uneven,” said the angel, shaking his head disapprovingly even as he smiled hugely at the sound of Dean’s laugh. Said sound grew distinctly into open-mouthed guffaws when Cas’ hands slid down, slipping into Dean’s front jean pockets to dig into his hips.
Cas let out a huff of a laugh and slipped his arms around Dean’s waist, pulling him closer and using his shoulder as a rest for his chin. “It, ah—” He nudged a nearby piece of helter-skelter furniture bits with his foot. “It was a lot like this.”
It didn’t matter that her hair was no longer of bright golden color, to him, she’d always soothe his heart much like sunsets once did in a past feeling further away than it really is. Her hands had become rougher, too. No longer being the softest surface on earth to a five year old, yet still perfectly interlocking with those of a twenty-four year old.
Upon hearing the rambled response, Gabriel simply hums. At least he takes another bite of his food before asking further questions, making fire lick at his brother’s heels.
Then again, if something looks too good to be true, it mostly is. Especially when its foundation has been laid by actions no one speaks of in fear of being heard, because in Mr. Winchester’s world, knowledge is power and that can be a dangerous thing.
Besides, Madame Justice didn’t really matter here now, did she? Who cares about a code when you’ve got a prize on your head?
Returning to the company came with another theater worthy act of ‘everything’s fine, life’s peachy, my husband is an angel’ and Castiel knew. He hadn’t needed to be told.
“Fucking hell, Novak! What happened to all your ‘holier than thou’ bullshit, huh?! Or did you forget that is exactly what got you in this situation? Even the first time we met, you started a public bitch fit because you couldn’t stand my ‘environment destroying factory’ messing with your unrealistic utopia of a world where every tree is saved and we all act like fucking fairies or some shit!”
Or so Castiel guesses because their words are muffled by the shouting surrounding him. People on the other side of the barricades are downright begging for autographs and selfies, and not just from Dean, from him, too. “Come on,” Dean orders, “scribble on some papers, take a few pics and then we can go inside.”
For most however, that was but a dream. Never would they belong to that 1% that actually made it and they knew, leaving no option but to pick the crumbs off the ground like a pack of hungry dogs and having to be satisfied with what they’d been given. To some, actually seeing the man in real life was just that.
“Why would you not have ‘traded me off’ to that Brit if I had told you about the stupid burns? What possible reason could you give me that wouldn’t make you sound like the complete lunatic you are?!”
Screw emotions right now. Castiel’s mind is overflowing with decisions he should have made a long time ago but he can’t show how distressed he is, he has to keep a calm demeanor or Dean will know something’s up before Cas can even think about step two. That man is like a shark in the water.
Castiel wishes he didn’t, but he does know, he understands how keeping Mr. Winchester out of the wrong spotlights is a responsibility they both share because if Dean is going down, probably so is he.
“Just a second, sweetie.” He says while once again cutting someone off in the middle of their sentence. “What are you still doing here, Mr. Novak? If you want an autograph you’ll have to wait in line like everyone else, you’re not special. Besides, don’t you have something better to do?”
To say it makes Cas extremely uncomfortable is a huge understatement. He knows he accidentally got caught up in something he rather would’ve averted and though the normal reflex in similar scenarios is to turn your back and run, the gaze currently sticking to his skin his holding him captive, silently claiming him.
Castiel doesn’t realize he’s made a mistake, doesn’t have any reason to believe he did something wrong, until he sees it flicker across darkening eyes; threatening clouds of an impending, restless storm trekking fast. It gallops upon the greens, approaching just as quickly and thundering ahead of time to make sure he’s frightened before it even hits.
“Very well. Here’s my card. You can call me anytime, even during the night though in that case you might be in contact with a nurse on duty. They will put me through for you. Make sure to mention you’re a Winchester.”
The nagging feeling that he’ll have to deal with Mr. Winchester sooner or later keeps tugging at him for the entirety of the car ride and even well past them making it to the restaurant. That is until their food arrives because, in all honesty, Castiel is
. Sam’s hateful stares saying more than enough and being plentifully accusatory. So much so that it actually made Castiel feel slightly bad about what he’d done. Not only did he possibly ruin his own career, he dragged Mr. Wesson down with him and that had been a low blow, even for him.
Yet again, Castiel’s thoughts are pulled back towards that one conversation he had with his brother all those nights ago. It feels like an eternity since they made these plans while in reality it hadn’t even been a full week.
The worried eyes on him grow even more intense at hearing his weak whispers. “A dog bit you? Cassie, you shouldn’t even be around dogs! Your allergies-“
.’ But besides a frown at the jumpy response, Gabriel doesn’t pay it much attention and is back to his snarky remarks in no time, making it painfully clear that no, he actually
It’s a joke. Nothing more than a joke, Castiel knows that but it still stings and he’s unable to fully hide it, a hurt expression settling over already battered features as he once again turns his attention away from Gabriel.
The second those words leave his mouth, Castiel knows it’s over for him and judging by the big crowd that had gathered around them, drawn in by the commotion and gasping at the two men, this was undoubtedly going to escalate into a full blown report, if not an actual lawsuit.
He hasn’t even shrugged the shirt off his shoulders completely when the comment he’d been waiting for gets barked at him. Even with him anticipating it, it still whips against his already beaten skin. “What the hell happened to you?” Mr. Winchester sneers, unmistakably asking about the dark bruises curling all around Cas’s side and up his ribs. Before he can answer, he gets cut off, the man demanding answers as to who caused the injuries.
most discussed and sought after internships. Though back then the company was technically still being run by John Winchester, his son was well on his way to take over, the expansion of some Massachusetts establishments being a ‘small’ first individual project for Dean.
, I don’t know what you’re getting at but I suggest you do it quick. And if you’re here to intimidate or threaten me, I recommend you pick your words carefully or they’ll be the last thing you ever said. In regards to that precious teacup of yours, I made it shatter. That’s what you get when you mess with my property. Perhaps you could teach your men some decent manners?”
There are only so many things one can blame on a fever, but pining for you capturer in some sick, twisted way isn’t one of them. Castiel knows that, he just doesn’t want to admit it.
“Yeah,” Dean groans between slow thrusts, “Gabriel is here. I’m surprised you’ve not seen him yet. He is quite popular with the ladies, though, I’ll give him that.”
Both luring him in and then keeping him hooked with bittersweet promises that should have sounded too good to be true from the get-go but are so deeply coated with persuasion that they leave users craving a next high before the needle has even made its exit. He was intoxicated well before taking the first sip of a drink he didn’t even know was spiked.
“Yeah. Yeah, that was him.” Castiel says as lightly as he can. “He’s actually on his way here, he’d love to meet you.” Lies, lies, all of it lies. God, what was he thinking? Was he really going to tell Gabe the truth? That not only would have put his own life in danger but Gabriel’s too and that was the last thing he wanted to happen. From now on, the lies will have to do.
Once the building’s lights were dimmed and the hallways quieted down, that’s when Winchester International Co. turned from your average multi-million dollar company into a safe haven for everything cruel, wicked and illegal, no eavesdropping or interruption to be expected.
He knew both pieces of paper officially weren’t legally binding in the court of law but for a man like Dean Winchester, capable of embezzling millions of dollars and finding no shame in rolling with gangs, making these seem viable probably was as simple as cooking an egg.
There’s lights flashing into his eyes, truck horns assaulting him, the sound of his own blood’s panicked motions, there’s voices, footsteps, pounding, everything at once.
Only adding to his increasing insanity is Dean completely ignoring him, acting as if he doesn’t even exist. The man darts in and out of the office, answers phone calls, types up e-mails, takes the occasional sip of cucumber water (yes, really). However, not a single word has been said to Castiel since that morning. Mr. Winchester gives him not a single look, either.
The man ends up finally closing his briefcase while still making small talk at Dean’s expense, unaware of the sensitive topics he’s touching. “I hear Greece is real nice this time of year. I wouldn’t want to leave either.”
Castiel thinks as he looks towards his boss in a quiet kind of ‘save me’ way but he’s only met with another glare that almost physically hurts because of how murderous it looks. Fine. “I apologize, Mr. Winchester” he grits out forcibly.
The room immediately goes quiet. That’s simply what happens when you take a dominant, authoritative, and well-respected man like Mr. Dean Winchester and put him in front of a select group of his most dedicated business partners.
Despite how busy the hallways right outside the glass conference room are, the actual space is overwhelmingly quiet as Castiel and Sam wait there on their predicament, tension only building the longer it goes on.
“You don’t like it? Is that it?” The change in the man’s tone didn’t go unnoticed. It had been creepily gentle before where now it was back to that signature coldness Castiel had gotten to know, and soon enough he found himself torn between wanting back the softness, no matter how out of character it had sounded, and actually feeling a sense of comfort when the harshness had returned.
Her face is sad, yet cautious as she looks at Castiel and then beyond him, scanning the room to once again make sure no other staff members have entered the house in the meantime. What was she on about?
“You see,” Mr. Davies begins as soon as they step into the back alley, “Ketch was an important and valued member to our..
It didn’t matter that Mr. Romano succumbed to his injuries that same week. It didn’t matter that Dean now ran the Winchester family. It didn’t even matter that he came out on top in the fight between his family and the Italian’s since Alessandro was unfit to take over, leaving Dean more powerful than them. Because, what good does it do you when the blood on your hands is not only your enemy’s but also that of both your parents?
But when he wants to walk into the hallway, not even a full tentative step further and there’s already an arm blocking his path. No words are spoken but the gesture says enough. “Can I get through?” Castiel sighs. He tries again after not receiving an answer. “Look, I just want to- I want-“
“We’re here, sir. Please remain close and do as our men say until you are safely inside.” They sneak around as if they’re on a special ops mission despite the house literally only being a few feet away but Castiel has to admit that if he’s forced to maneuver in the dark, he’d rather do it with these trained people by his side. If only they’d tell him what the fuck was going on.
Upon noticing, yet ignoring Cas’ confused look, Dean continues. “I won’t give them to you. I’m sure you understand why. Now-“
He had been willing to give it a chance, for fuck’s sake, but he didn’t work his ass off to make a name for himself, only to be treated like his life meant absolutely nothing. It was plain humiliating and demeaning.
“You don’t believe me” Dean sighs. “These past few weeks, they’ve been different. I’ll be honest, I thought I’d enjoy going back to the way things were before..
His entire body is throbbing and shaking by the time blood gets mixed with cum though Mr. Ketch can’t seem to care, he just forcefully grabs Cas’s shoulder and turns him around, ready to kick his fifteen minutes of pleasure out of the bed when he sees it.
He’s not paying attention to them anymore and only notices the two men are saying their slow goodbyes when Dean is already standing up and pulling on his navy cashmere coat. When the owner goes to hand over the lacquer wooden box containing the bill, there’s a soft chuckle.
Two hours of being treated like royalty had left him feeling a whole lot better than he did this morning, not even Dean giving him an unimpressed look upon descending the stairs had affected him.
“Darling, imma let you in on a little secret: you don’t get to say no to me. Understand?” Comparing Dean’s demeanour to a vulture’s wouldn’t bring the current situation much justice. A vulture waits till the throat has been slit, watches from the side-lines until it’s his time to strike, and though he might fly high above the predators, he’ll always be beneath them on the food chain.
“Calm the fuck down!” the man yells before continuing in a still harsh voice, “You’re obviously doped up on some good shit but I don’t care! It’s not because you’re Mr. Winchester’s plaything that your entitled ass can order me around and jeopardize an entire organisation by causing a scene. Now shut your filthy mouth. The boss will be here soon enough.”
If only Mr. Winchester would be there, he could protect Castiel from harm, or so Cas wishes to believe. He knows it’s messed up to think that but it’s all the comfort he can cling to as his body shivers from the cold and the pain still rippling through his chest. “He’s here” someone announces upon entering the room. When Castiel turns around to see, he recognizes Mr. Lafitte immediately and soon enough, Mr. Winchester follows behind.
That night Castiel dreams of Purgatory. He dreams of coming upon Dean, his entrails and blood a bright splash of color on the forests’ strangely monochromatic floor. He dreams of kneeling next to his hunter and trying desperately to put the pieces back together like he has so many times before. He dreams of tears mixing with the dirt and sweat that’s already on his face, blurring his vision and burning his eyes until he can barely make out the shape of his love as he cradles Dean’s lifeless face between shaking, bloodstained fingers.
"Well maybe my tastes are changing," Meg said quickly, gesturing at Dean in disbelief. "I mean if playboy Dean Winchester can decide to settle down with someone then maybe I can decide that I'd rather have someone who likes to cosplay and read comic books more than they like to bungee jump off of the Golden Gate Bridge."
They had not been expecting to find Abaddon, running with a hoard of renegade angels out destroying potential vessels before their siblings that still did not have forms could find the humans and convince them to agree to being an angel's glorified meat suit. He knew it was the demon because he had been on the phone with Dean when the other man had stumbled upon her hideout, approaching her with his defiant, stupid, stubborn swagger that never did anything but make things worse.
His breath caught in his chest as he took in the sight of Gabriel leaning on the doorframe on one arm with a playful smile on his face, looking every bit the adorable muchkin that Sam had privately started to think of him as.
Okay, maybe he wanted to impress Dean just a little, but the other man was right behind him and it was taking everything he had not to lean back into the other man's hands until he felt them on his back or shoulders or anywhere because he was pretty sure if Dean touched him again like when he had put his hand on Castiel knee at lunch he was going to come right then and there, just like he had in his dream about the other man. That would be just too fucking embarrassing to ever live down, even if he wanted nothing more than for Dean to touch him.
He definitely did not think about Castiel, about how maybe he should just take the blame for everything that had happened because really? How much more of a paranoid, jealous jerk could he have been acting like? He would never find someone as great as the other man ever again, so maybe he should just let Cas call the shots in their relationship and just be happy that the other man was allowing him the privilege of being in his life in the first place. Maybe if he lacked all self-respect he could do just that.
She smiled at the compliment, thinking about the conversation she and Castiel had been in the middle of right before he left. Even without Garth's insight, she probably would have figured out that her new friend wasn't exactly batting for the home team after seeing how he had barely reacted to that cashier practically flashing him as she had leaned over the register to hand him the receipt for his sunglasses.
"I don't remember eight months of time, Dean. It's just…" the older man waved a hand distractedly over his face. "Gone. And when I woke up in a grass shack in Tahiti they told me that I had been legally dead for eight seconds before they revived me and put me in a medicated coma to heal. I was in physical therapy for another six months and by then you had moved into the tower and had a funeral...broke the news to my sister. Bob told me you had moved on."
Weekend is a real movie and its on Netflix and its super awesome so watch it and have all of the feels.
Special thanks to 1223rhys for providing me with thoughtful reviews, you're ah-mazing! Thanks to everyone who is reading, bookmarking, and subscribing to the story, don't be shy let me know what you're thinking!
Gabriel stood awkwardly in the small hallway inside the door of the apartment as he waited for Sam to retrieve his battered lap top from the bedroom he shared with his brother and wondered if it would be too forward of him if he just scaled the taller boy like a mountain and kissed him senseless.
Dean smiled into the kiss at the smaller boy's actions even as he spun around to press Castiel firmly against the wall near the doorway and swept his tongue around the other boy's. He groaned when he felt the legs around him tighten as he ran his tongue over the roof of Cas's mouth and the other boy tugged slightly on his hair.
The memories of his father watching as Raphael spat insults at him using the righteous words of a God who Castiel had always secretly thought reviled him to break down his meager defenses, flooded through his mind and caused his knees to buckle, bruises from the impact showing in the shower later as he scrubbed his skin raw to erase the phantom feelings of Daniel's deceiving caresses from his skin.
Castiel had been breathing heavily against Dean's skin and the larger boy drug his short, blunt nails down the other boy's back, clutching him close and hooking one of his legs over his boyfriend's hip as he felt Cas start to falter in the rhythm they had set together.
"No and how about a new rule," Dean breathed agitatedly, biting back the frustrated moan that had just about slipped out over the other man's teasing. "No more talking about my brother or Bobby when we're naked. This is ruining naked time."
"You can go if you're scared," face-tattoo hissed, grabbing Dean's hair to tug his head back up when his chin drifted down towards his chest. "I'm not done with our pretty bird yet. He's going to be begging me to kill him, sing so sweet and so soft."
"Ok," Dean said steadily, his legs still felt like they were tingling and he was starting to think it was something more than the alcohol or numbness or a cell phone vibrating.
"Jesus," Castiel whispered, jumping when a man came barreling around the corner from the rec room toward him.
He shrugged and followed the older man down the hallway a bit, stopping at an unmarked door next to the one shower on the floor that Cas hadn't bothered to use since it was next to Martin's room. Jim pulled a small set of mismatched keys out of his pocket and flipped through them before he found the one for what Castiel could only assume was the bathroom for the nurses and doctors on the ward, 'not like the patients were going to be able to get in there at any rate.
He looked back at Cas to see the boy staring at him intently, waiting for Dean’s verdict on what he was hearing. Dean made the universal face for ‘not bad’, shrugging indifferently and holding out a hand that he flipped back and forth for a moment.
He tried not to think about how Dean's hand was right there almost touching his shoulder, the sleeve of his plaid shirt hiking up a bit to show off the musculature of his wrist and the veins that weren't as pronounced as Castiel's under the other man's tan skin. Castiel remembered how Dean had just draped an arm over his shoulder like it was nothing when he had been giving him the tour so maybe it wouldn't be weird if he leaned into the other man's hand just a little bit. He wrote it off as trying to get comfortable as he shifted a little closer to Charlie on the couch and not as wanting to feel like he could breathe again like had happened earlier when Dean had touched him.
"We can take a break, sweetheart." His boyfriend said softly, leaning down near his ear so that his t-shirt covered chest was against Castiel's back and pressing a kiss into his temple. "You don't have to tell me everything today. I don't want you to get upset, we'll get there. We have time."
His reluctance to break their uneasy truce was based more on the fact that John would most definitely beat him back to Lawrence if the older man got pissed off enough and left him on the side of the road somewhere rather than any stubbornly lingering familial affection. Dean had no doubt that the first thing the still surprisingly sober John Winchester would do upon returning home would be to go over to the Novak house to punish everyone he thought deserved it, Sammy and Cas and anyone else who got in his way included.
I didn't worry about it at first, I thought it was just me missing them and maybe stress and if I had been living in a decent apartment it probably would've been. But then I started hearing my dad's voice; he had always been a snarky son of a gun, a lot like Dean. That's probably why we got along so well in high school, but if you asked him he would probably say it's because he always wanted a sister; Sam's hair doesn't braid as well as mine does apparently."
But he hadn't wanted to burden Dean with it, the timing was just complete and utter shit, but there was nothing he could do about it. The date for the trial had been set months ago, over the summer before he knew about Dean Winchester and found something that he wanted more than the gift of dying forgiven that his father had offered him. Now more than anything he just wanted all of this to be over, so that he could move on with the rest of his life and he didn't want Dean to worry about him when he was already busy taking care of John who didn't even deserve the help that his oldest son was giving him.
Jo sighed and picked up the second beer, "You think? Man, maybe I'm losing my touch. I need to get laid."
Castiel was willing to humor his friends for a while, it had been his own fault for telling Ash that he had a room when the other boy had been musing to him about using the credit card he had stolen from his dad to get a hotel room where they all could go party together as the dance started to wind down. The night had gotten so much better after that first dance and Dean telling him he loved him and Castiel felt like he was floating on a cloud, he probably would've agreed to just about anything.
Meg's voice was moving farther away, into the kitchen where Castiel could dimly hear her clattering around with the pots and pans, probably getting ready to start dinner. He had been watching the fading afternoon light streaming in from the small window in Meg's kitchen and had tried to will the sun to keep from setting so that maybe he wouldn't lose another day with Dean to John. The whole way back from Chicago he had been making plans that involved them and not having to hide from anyone anymore; plans about not being scared and the suddenness that all of that had slipped away from him was overwhelming and more that just a little bit painful.
"Lingerie?" Dean asked jokingly, earning a raised eyebrow and an intrigued smirk from his boyfriend. "Save something for Valentine's Day, babe."
I know its been forever and a day, but I've also got more troubling news kids. I've decided that I'm going to work on solely Nomad by Fate (hey I just read that!) and Deep in the Heart until they are complete. Meaning California Dreamin' and It's Kind of a Funny Story are going on hiatus. However, hopefully this will help me from stagnating into a deep pit of writer's block and despair (like I just did) so we shall see.
"Not." Castiel said firmly, he was definitely not going to talk about sex with Anna, like ever. If he ever became an uncle he planned on just acting blissfully ignorant about how his future niece or nephew came into being and focus on spoiling the shit out of them instead.
"Okay," Gabriel said giving him one of the winning smiles that he known for and picking up the bottles that Bobby had placed to the side of the bag. "I brought you shampoo and deodorant, a toothbrush and toothpaste. Y'know just the basics, a couple of changes of clothes and stuff. Kali told me to bring you some books so I got you crosswords and Sudoku, she loves that stuff but you know how I can be with numbers; all of my recipes are literally a pinch of this a handful of that. Rachel Ray can keep her fancy measuring cups, stuffs for amateurs."
"Well, what do you want to do then?" Castiel said snuggling his face into the larger boy's neck with a contended sigh, twining his legs through Dean's as he went even though there was no real reason for them to have to be that close now the bed was twice as big.
"Meg Masters." Dean said seriously, steadying himself with his hands on the edge of the dryer. He felt like he was sitting really high up and giggled slightly when he thought of Cas catching him and rescuing him back.
It wasn't until he and John were settling into the older man's truck, John's duffle bag and Dean's backpack tossed into the bed of the pickup that John spoke up and said something that gave his son just the faintest glimmer of hope. But that glimmer was extinguished once he registered the full meaning behind the words, like oxygen being sucked out a fireplace and leaving his heart a barely recognizable cavern full of wispy embers and barely there heat. Heat that felt like it was dissipating the more hopeless his situation got, along with the smell of Cas that lingered on his clothes and the taste of the other boy that had long since faded from his lips.
"You sure your boyfriend isn't gonna get mad at me if I let you take me out to breakfast?" Dean teased, ignoring how it made his heart hurt a little bit that everyone was going to think that Cas was Meg's and not know that the actor belonged heart and soul to him instead.
Castiel knew that it was purposefully vague, but his dad had always made a point of mentioning all of his kids as well as his wife, leaving out the kind of details that made it easy for overzealous fans to track you down and wait outside your house to pounce on you. Cas could only remember that having happened once when he was about six and luckily there had been a mounted policeman nearby to keep the strange man away from him and Gabe as their dad had walked them to their nearby elementary school.
"God, yes." Dean groaned, letting the other boy push him down the hallway backwards, stumbling over nothing as they kissed their way towards his bedroom.
"Suicidal?" Dean asked angrily, biting his lip hard to keep anything else from coming out. God, why had he said that? Psych was never going to let him leave The Hub ever again, he'd be lucky if they even let him have his bow now.
"What did you two do?" Dean choked out at Meg who just shook her head and mouthed wordlessly besides him as he scrambled for his phone and pressed it to his ear as soon as he saw that it was his actor calling him.
"Right!" Sam exclaimed, gesturing at Dean like he was some prize on a game show. "I mean, look at him. He's so gone, Gabs. You're worrying about nothing."
It took everything Castiel had to not reach out to run his fingers over the other man's forearms so that Dean would know that the jagged scars of his past didn't bother him, but this wasn't about Dean or him or just Charlie, really. This was about how fucked up each and every one of them were and how they had to keep trying and moving forwards and living despite that.
"Cas, I really think you should talk to him," Ash objected, following him when he started towards the cafeteria. All he had eaten yesterday was a breakfast burrito and a burger and the most thoughtful pie he had ever had ever, so he was pretty ready for waffles if that's what was waiting for him. "Talk to Charlie at least, bro. She's better at like, words and stuff than I am. You shouldn't stop being his friend, it would just...be bad. Fuck, talk to Charlie!"
It hit him like a goddamn train, the orgasm erupting out if him just like his watery cum and maybe Sam would have been willing to swallow, maybe he would even like that, but Gabriel pulled him off with a jerk of his hand and ended up painting his face with white ropes of his sperm. Marking him. Fuck, he could come again on that thought alone.
Of course. He was just some random guy in a millionth grey Toyota Corolla that could be seen on the streets of the town. But when Castiel saw it, he just snapped, all of that pent up anger and despair clouding his mind and making him see things that might not even be there. Benny managed to drag him away from the poor man and managed to convince him he needed to rest.
Somewhere in the distance, a deep male voice sounded, calling out, and Dean almost felt as if it was his dad calling for him, telling him it was over and that he could finally rest in peace. Dean wasn't that lucky.
After another heavy sigh, Cas explained that somehow Crowley ended up with the only copy of his novel, a hard copy, and that he also had a digital one, but was accidentally deleted. Something pinged on Charlie's laptop and she excused herself to check it out, but Cas kept his head low, his eyes to the ground, probably feeling ashamed and foolish. And even though Dean felt there was more to the story, for the first time he cared more about comforting Cas, then about finding out the truth.
"Hello, Dean." He said and Dean felt goosebumps crawl all over his body at the sound of Mr. Novak's deep voice. Oh shit. He is supposed to say something.
Still, he reached for it, pausing when Dean steered in his sleep a bit, but once he settled back, Castiel managed to pull it closer and cover Dean with it. He would wake him later, enough to move him under the blankets, and to tuck him in before he laid beside him, but for now, he could just hold him and let him rest up a bit in his arms, right? Or was he too selfish about this too? Was this really good for Dean, or good to ease his guilty conscious?
Inside there were three classy armchairs and a matching two-seater, all facing the biggest television set Dean has ever seen. He did have to admit, it was a real sight that left him with his mouth slightly ajar, drooling. He is thankfully interrupted when Mr. Novak stepped in front of it, looking for something.
"Meg brought over some noddle soup for you. Would you like some?" Castiel's voice brought Dean back from his daze and a small smile tugged at his lips as he nodded. Castiel helped Dean turn a bit, pulling out a round inflatable cushion and placing it under Dean's tush to ease the pressure off... Well, we all know how hemorrhoid cushions are used and if not, look it up. Poor Dean was already blushing so hard, embarrassed, and he doesn't need us talking about his... Tush. Without much fuss and without paying much attention to Dean's red face, Castiel sat at the edge of the bed, far enough as not to disturb Dean, he opened the plastic container, dipped the plastic spoon in it and lifted it up, soup and some very small, easy to swallow noddles and fed Dean. He lifted each and every spoon and fed Dean until it was all gone.
Why hadn't he done this sooner? It has actually been so long since he even indulged in any sexual activity, ages since he even had something resembling an alpha these days. But he shouldn't compare this to any of that. He couldn't. It was no comparison. There was nothing out there like this.
Dean managed to get to the elevators without being spotted by the guards that were oddly nowhere in sight. He hoped he would have a clear path to Castiel's office too, it would really be a bummer if he managed to get to his door and be caught then. Strangely, it never occurred to him that Mr. Novak would have been informed and that he would most likely want to see the intruder. So many things didn't occur to him today, but he still managed to get this far. Just a little more.
"I think you can manage the dishes without me. Have a nice evening, Gabriel." Castiel interrupted as he took off his apron, set it down on the table and rounded it, coming up to Dean. "Please. Follow me." He said, then he brushed past the confused man and headed towards his apartment that was only a block away. He didn't see Dean glance at Gabriel once again and give him a shrug before turning and going after Castiel.
"Ewwwwww..." Castiel shouted out as he threw the item away from himself, and somehow managing to catapult it straight into the Garbage box. Dean tried to hide his laughter as Castiel ran past him and into the bathroom to wash his hands.
"I want you." The three little words had such an impact on Dean, like air to a drowning man, and he wanted to breathe it all in, but he knew he couldn't. He had to reel it in, and ease into to. He wanted to tell him that he wanted him too, so badly, that he couldn't imagine a day without him, that he wanted to share everything with him. That Dean was in love with him. Fuck. He was a goner.
Dean kept talking, but Sam was only half listening, his ming wandering over to the omega he saw a few times through the window. He actually knew Gabriel's reaction because he was right there by the door when Gabriel came to talk to Dean.
the paper said and Castiel repeated that he will wake, but that they don't know what state he will be in and if he will be able to recuperate, much less how long that would take. As he explained, Dean's eyes were glued to Sam, the hope in them returning and if Castiel was a betting man, he would bet that Dean though it was worth it. All his suffering and sacrifice that could have been avoided was worth it. Maybe it was better to let him think that, to stay positive and optimistic and to focus on Sam, rather then to think about the past, about how much he has been hurt by people around him. Better to look on the bright side, right?
"Meg, hold on a sec. I know this is perhaps a bit sudden, but doctor Wilson and I have been talking and he wanted to offer you a position in his private clinic. As far as I understood him, it would be basically the same job you have here, only better paid and with a chance to maybe advance some day? But there are house-calls, so I am not sure... Would you be interested in something like that? No, no, don't answer right away, think it over, it isn't a decision to be made lightly. And you would need to discuss it further with him anyway, all I know is that as far as I can see it is a good offer, but maybe... I was thinking, and if Dean would agree - Cas said glancing at Dean - that your could consider Sam to be your first patient for house-calls?"
With that though, Gabriel's eyes sought out Sam again, wanting, needed to see the big bad alpha take his omega dick like a good little boy and oh! sweet Jesus Christ, when the fuck did Gabriel move from impaling the alpha on his dick to face fucking him? God bless Paul Revere and his Midnight Ride because, fucking hell, the British are coming!
He felt his grace stir, then rush through his system as soon as Dean's fingers neared his hole. The hunter gasped when his finger slipped inside, probably feeling the cool tendrils of his grace relaxing his muscles and easing the way. Castiel's hand slid from Dean's shoulder to his arm and pushed slightly, the look in Castiel's eyes hopefully enough to convey that preparation wasn't necessary. Dean huffed a smile, moved and then Castiel felt the head of his cock at his entrance.
Dean walked back to the club, enjoying the fresh air, every third step had a certain skip to it, and his every move was joyful and perky, the world seemed just bit brighter today. He entered the club through the back, passing by Azazel who was rushing out, probably late to a meeting, a hand gripped tightly over his chest and his breathing a bit more rugged, like he ran a marathon. Dean just shrugged and walked past the dancer's rooms, glancing inside. Kevin and Adam were nowhere to be found, which was a good thing, because if they weren't in bed on such a beautiful day, that meant they weren't hurt, sore or anything like that. And he was glad. He came out to the bar and greeted Crowley who squinted his eyes at Dean and studied him for a moment before he spoke up.
The feeling was... There were no words. No words that would do it justice. It was so warm and tight and Dean just had to breathe, remember to breathe, focus, keep it together...
But nothing happened, nothing penetrated him and he felt the body that was pressing against his disappear. Dean didn't have the strength to hold himself upright, so when there was nothing supporting him anymore, he crumbled down on the floor, wincing as his ass touched the cold floor. He didn't know what was happening, and couldn't make his brain function enough to find out, but he did hear some shouts and some arguing and then there was a loud crash and with a corner of his eye he thought he saw something big fall down.
Gabriel launched forward, grabbing Sam's neck and pulling him down into a fierce kiss that had the alpha practically mewling, then walked him backwards till his legs hit the bed. Confused, Sam looked down at the omega, his eyes soft and curious and maybe even slightly fearful despite the redness of his arousal and all Gabriel could do was smile genuinely up at him before he pushed him.
"I'm sorry, sorry, please... Continue..." Castiel urged. "It just tickled a bit, I am aaaaeeee... All good." He managed, losing his breath mid way as Dean's fingers came back to massage the back of his neck. He could feel his head wanting to fall forward and he was barely keeping himself upright.
Dad wasn't a bad guy, he never hit Dean nor Sam, he tried, he really tried. Sometimes things would get hard and he would allow himself to get drunk and pass out of a couch in a random place they were staying at, and Dean would sometimes have to go and find food for Sammy. But that was the least he could do after being the cause off all their problems.
He could feel Dean's hands wrapping around him, he could hear the soothing shushing, and the steady heartbeat as he leaned into his chest. He could feel Dean's hot breath on the top of his head, he could feel the small kiss Dean planted there and hear him say he was there and he wasn't going to let anything happen to him.
, but even then Dean knew it was exaggerated. Not all alphas were knotheads, actually, most of them weren't. They cared about the omega and treated them with care and respect, even, or better said especially during their rut. Cas was a perfect example of that. Still, the waves should be more frequent then they were, but somehow, they weren't.
the inspiration behind some characters." Sam commented smiling at them, and Cas glanced up at him and nodded, slowly coming to see the similarities. Of course he didn't know Dean that well, bit from what he had learned about him from their days spent in the garden was that Dean is such a strong, protective omega, but one that likes to be pampered too. Or at least held.
But then his brain started working some more, first letting him realize there was no pain or discomfort in his...lower back, and then slowly reeling it in, letting him remember the massage and how Castiel feel asleep. He couldn't help the smile that tugged at his lips at the sight of the man's sleeping form and the warm feeling returned to his chest. His hand instinctively brushed over where Castiel laid last night and felt a small pinch at the sight of the empty bed. Dean blinked, not sure why he was feeling this way.
"Ah, that's the stuff..." Gabriel said as he leaned into the banana Sam had given him and took a long sniff of it. He was sitting in Sam's lap, the alpha's knot swollen inside of him after their couch session. Gabriel had asked to be bent over the couch and fucked hard, so Sam complied like a good little alpha. Even if there was absolutely nothing little about him.
And it was a big deal, it was. It was sad that he never experienced that, but to think that Castiel made him feel good enough, that he allowed Castiel to make him feel even better, that Castiel was the reason he got to experience it now... No wonder Dean was so overwhelmed with tears streaming down his face.
"Of... Of course you won't... I gotta stay in too, finish up on Balth's follow up article and start on my next project. And don't worry about the shelter, Zeke and Josh took some vacation days, so they'll be there to help." Dean jumped to say, ridding Cas of any possible arguments. Still, Cas didn't give any answer, aside from the small contemplative frown and a distant look in his eyes as he stared into the ground.
"You know why." Was all he replied. The fact was, he was still spreading the smell of a rejected omega, and there was a pretty good chance Castiel would react to it, either by nature or by his nurture, meaning that he would either be drawn to ease Dean's ache or think he is obliged to, because in the eyes of the society, Dean owned him now. But if Dean let it be, then there was a chance the mark would fade, and it would be like it never happened.
"Now, I have spoken to doctor Gavin and he feels that he could discharge you tommorow as well, given that you stay in bed for at least another week. So. What do you think? Ready to go home?"
The moment stretched for so long, Cas was sure that the stunned expression one Dean's face was an indication he completely misinterpreted everything, but then... Like it took the omega a second to understand and Cas could see the exact moment it clicked, the omega drawing a deep breath, his eyes filling with tears and hope and joy, his scent booming in the air.
- his mind mocked him. Dean screwed his eyes shut, something heavy pressing down on his chest. He did not know the answer.
Dean almost slipped and asked, his inner voice barely stopping him in time. But something deeper inside of him still wanted to ask. Or to take up that role. Maybe just this once, to show his appreciation for everything Castiel has done for him. And to repay for...
His mind warned. Still, his eyes roamed around the room, searching for any clue as to where Castiel might have gone off to.
"Shhh, it's going to be okay." The alpha soothed and Gabriel gulped feeling that big hand slipping to his hip. He really wished he had the strength to fight, or at least to try, to fucking say something, scream, struggle, something, anything but the silent whine he let out as the alpha rolled him on his stomach. Fuck his legs still wouldn't move and he couldn't stop this, he couldn't stop the alpha from ripping his pijama's off and burring his big cock in his betraying slicking ass.
Dean woke up late with a groan, filling stiff and unrested. He lazily got dressed and went to find something to eat, whatever was brought in from a restaurant next door. Feeling like gagging at the smell of cooked cabbage with a bit of beef in it, he took his portion, not daring to start his day without the only meal he would probably get. It was late in the day, but still early for him, his first performance didn't start until around 8. It was Saturday, so it would be a mixed crowd and after last night, Alistair will definitely be there. First in line.
"Are you sure everything's ok, Dean?" Castiel interrupted his... vivid train of though and Dean turned his dreamy gaze towards him.
Dean was too caught by surprise, but carefully took the offered figurine, his smile reaching his eyes and making them shine. "Thank you." He told Castiel, who shyly nodded and went back to stand behind Gabriel. The older brother's brows furrowed and once Dean's eyes met his, his smile dropped.
"I think nurse Masters would be up to the task." Castiel commented with a small knowing smile and Tony huffed a laugh, nodding and agreeing. Whole their little conversation took place, Castiel was pulling Dean's wheelchair up to the wall and Dean heard a small click once the latch hooked to the chair.
"Lemme get you some water... Maybe something sweeter?" He said and removed his hand, getting out of bed. Gabriel could clearly see the stain his own slick made on the Sam's jeans and a thrill went up his spine at the thought of him marking the alpha in such a way. Marking his territory.
Dean vaguely remembered when Castiel rose and let Dean's cock slip out of him, then fell on the bed next to him and laid his head on his shoulder. His mind was still coming from that incredible height, that cloud nine he was on and he needed a moment to register Cas nuzzling against him. He wrapped his arms around him and kissed those dry, a bit chipped lips, licking them and making them soft again.
"No, 'm not. Wouldn't do that to you again. Ever." Dean said and Cas' paused, his teary eyes looking over him with uncertainty, Dean felt a part of him crumble. They were going so well, yesterday with their talk and today with all of this and… How? How do things go from that to this? How come he gets Cas to open up a bit, then regret doing it? Earn a piece of his trust only to lose it again? "I liked…" He had to try.
Unfortunately, he struck out with the club today too, when he arrived, all he found was one pissed of Nick and that same dancer that didn't seem to like Dean, in a heated argument about the whereabouts of the owner and the bartender. Apparently, Nick believed him when he said he didn't know where Azazel was, but found it extremel Iy hard to believe that Crowley managed to reconcile with that bitch of his mother and was currently visiting her.
Not knowing if the limo was the car that Azazel had in mind, he still got up and went in, for the first time taking a chance for himself and not lying down and surrendering. Benny raised a brow at him, but made no comment, instead went around the car, got in and started it. Benny never noticed, but Dean did, just as they were driving away Alistair ran out of that back door, fuming and yelling something after them, but Dean couldn't hear him anymore. He was safe. For now, for tonight, he was safe.
It was such a relief when Dean told him it was just to wrap up his leg, his wound, so it didn't get wet. Castiel really should stop comparing Dean to Zach. It wasn't fair to Dean.
But what if he was? Why would that have to be wrong? Doing the right thing for the wrong reasons was still doing the right thing? Right?
"Nothing to report yet, I am working on something and as soon as I see if it pans out, I'll let you know." Dean said with slight irritation in his voice.
Frank was a genius at finding things, but not just because he had easy access to government files, but also because he knew people. His job as the head of the local Social Security Administration office allowed him to delegate his work and focus on some other, much more lucrative tasks (Frank accepted cash and favors as currency).
Yeah, no, he definitely wasn't sorry, if that kiss after Zeke left was anything to go by. God, he felt it down to his bones, the tingles that spread through his system just from the kiss. It felt so good. It felt so right. It felt amazing and Dean didn't want to stop, he
They stayed like that for a moment too long, Dean holding tight enough to provide comfort, loose enough so that if Cas wanted out, he could easily back away. When Cas let go, he had the most adorable blush on his cheeks, and even if he was clearly embarrassed, he lingered close. "I'm sorry." He said, and Dean felt like all they ever did was apologize to one another. "I guess it all caught up to me."
Still, it looked stunning, wines hugging the red brick walls, high, decorative windows and it all just screamed warmth and welcome. Gabriel could just imagine Castiel sitting out on those benches amongst the flowers, reading and enjoying the sun. He really fucking hoped the owner wasn't a douchebag and that if they do come to an agreement, that Cas would be allowed out to the yard. Even if it has to be supervised.
Dean left him for a bit longer this time, putting the clothes in the washer, making sure the bathroom was relatively clean. Considering he hadn't done any thorough cleaning in over a month, since he started at the shelter, Dean was grateful there wasn't any mildew. Same was for the rest of the apartment. Definitely a little dusty and in need of a proper vacuuming, but not overall messy. He cleaned what he could while Cas was asleep, praying to avoid his bedroom in the tour. It was like a bomb exploded in there.
"Dean usually answers his phone when I call," Sam continued, his voice sounded tight and tired and making Cas feel even worse because it reminded him of how Dean's had sounded when the other boy had been worrying for no reason about how he would do on the SATs. Had that only been a week ago? "And even if it goes to voicemail, he usually calls me back within an hour or sends me a text telling me to fuck off or something. It's not like him to just not answer."
she thought taking in the stubble on his jaw and the dark circles under his eyes. She offered him her Starbucks cup which by now was only half-full and probably mostly cold.
"Relax, Winchester. I'm making cookies, but you're here now so I'm pretty sure we can manage to not ruin them if we work together. "
"I didn't know Gabe," Raphael choked out, pulling back to look down at his younger brother with a tear-streaked face while their father shook his head disgustedly and walked off with their lawyer towards the hallway outside the courtroom. "I thought I was doing God's work, I thought that I was saving him. It just...all became so wrong and contorted, I deserve whatever punishment that they give me. Father and I, we almost ruined Castiel's life and we've stolen yours. I'm so sorry."
"Dude, you have so many games that I never know which one ends up with someone coming out on top or not." Ash grumbled before getting a serious look on his face. "I'll go first, Edwin Armstrong."
That bloody, blind wanker was going to ruin all of this for all of them and Crowley was going to be the laughing stock of Los Angeles all over again. He was going to lose everything this time: his closest friend, Balthazar, his reputation, the Aston. And even then all he could think about was what Castiel was going to do to help his parents if he lost everything, that and choking the actor to death with his bare hands for keeping him out of the loop, but the worry was overriding his usually overwhelming desire to murder someone when he was pissed off.
He turned up the collar of his coat against the cold wind that was blowing and started towards the park so that he and the other boy could follow their usual after movie ritual. Castiel let out a surprised yelp when he felt himself pulled sharply back by his coat until he had Dean's arms wrapped around him from behind and the larger boy was shuffling him towards the Impala.
"So colors," Castiel said, picking up his forking and cautiously winding spaghetti around its tines as he forced himself to think positive because Dean was alive, he was; Cas could just feel it in his bones. "I always thought teal was a good spring color, mature. Pastels for an April wedding would be really predictable."
After about fifteen minutes of riding aimlessly, he stopped his bike with a screech. The melody that he always had going in his head had reached a crescendo, something that hadn’t happened with the music he made up as he rode in a very long time. Back before he had started obsessing over all of the choices he had made in his life thus far, comparing his failings against the triumphs of everyone else in his family and Balthazar who was pre-med.
“Maybe you won’t crash any more funerals,” Balloon guy admonished only slightly apologetically. “Seriously, I clocked you as soon as you walked in. And you’re lucky it was me instead of a pissed off parent.”
They had just kissed then, the quarters were too close for either of them to get more of a grasp on each other besides hands wrapped around shoulders and cradling faces, rocking their hips together in a slow motion that still made him come when Dean groaned his name as he sucked a matching dark mark onto the larger man's chest, right below the base of his throat. The two of them had stayed there until the water started getting cold and his phone started going off again with another phone call from Crowley telling him that Naomi's agent had been in contact with him saying that the actress didn't want to see him on the set.
"Dean doesn't know what he likes," Ellen said interrupting the conversation to slide steaming plates of enchiladas in front of each of the kids at the table. "Remember when he had that crush on your cousin, hun?"
The first time he dared to pull the moleskine out of his backpack was well after John drifted off into an alcohol induced slumber, snoring thunderously enough that Dean was unconcerned when he let out a grunt of pain as he stretched his leg off of the side of the bed in order to hook his foot through the strap of his bag so that he could drag it closer. The older man had locked Dean to the bed early on Tuesday night, returning already halfway drunk with a brown bagged bottle of alcohol tucked under his arm and a mean set to his mouth.
Aaron's nose was too big and his kisses were too wet, too sloppy to be anything like it had been when Dean and Castiel had kissed so he pulled away when the house lights came up and smiled at the other man in a way that would make him feel like less of a jerk when he didn't call Aaron back for another date. He decided to keep the number in his phone, just in case he did ever actually move on from wanting something he couldn't have, but for now an easy relationship just didn't seem appealing.
"Uh, yea you did." Dean said excitedly, hopping to his feet and rushing down to Ellen where he spoke in low tones with the other woman before she nodded and surreptitiously looked around, handing him something that Dean hid behind his back.
It was even worth killing off her old identity of Julia Shelley to pull the whole thing off and now she was content to work for an eccentric British filmmaker because really, she deserved a frackin' break from being the only vigilante do-gooder that she knew of. What she hadn't counted on was ending up back in the states, trailing after her boss with a pained expression because the last thing she needed was to get recognized and hauled off to a dungeon in Dick Roman's basement somewhere.
"What do you know about it?" Dean asked, his blood boiling with a sudden rage at his situation that blotted out all of the fatigue and sadness and utter horror over what what his life had become. "You met him all of one time and you were drunk. Fuck, dad. You were so focused on being pissed about Sam that you wouldn't even shake Cas's hand! You wouldn't even give him a fucking chance! He's a good person dad!"
“Oh, well shit,” Castiel said, kicking himself for sticking his foot in his mouth again. “I’m sorry.”
Dean had never gone to a funeral for a kid, something about the grief of a life snuffed out too soon had seemed too raw for Dean to be able to fake. It had felt much more disrespectful to crash those funerals than the ones for people who had lived a long and full and fascinating life.
By the time the bubbles had started to fizzle out around him, Cas had already decided that Luc probably wouldn't miss the little bit of the shampoo that he used to carefully wash his hair; tenderly pressing on the large lump at the back of his head to see if it was going to start bleeding again while trying to remember the signs of a skull fracture from when he had had one after Lake Forrest. He figured he had already fucked up by falling asleep while waiting on Dean to call him, so the nausea and dizziness were probably just because he was hungry and not a concussion of some sort.
"Hey...uh, Becks?" Dean said sidling up to the pair with his hands shoved deep into the pockets of his dress pants after he set Castiel up with a drink before leaving him on the balcony talking to Gilda and Kevin. "Garth, man can I borrow her for a little bit?"
In response to the mental imagery that lovely realization brought to mind, Dean let out a frustrated groan and thrashed his legs around on the bed a bit until he was thoroughly tangled in his sheets and blankets. Childish as it was it made him feel a little better, emotionally at least; physically he felt like he was about to hurl so he pried his face out his pillow in order to take in a breath of air that didn't smell like sweat and tears only to see his brother propped up in the doorway of his room with a bottle of Advil in his hand and an amused smirk on his face.
The younger man turned around in front seat, his expression warring between happy and scared; Castiel could only imagine the kind of tortures his agent threatened the driver with on a regular basis.
"We're out of tranquilizers," another man muttered, his eyes flickering over to the man that had somehow managed to slip into one of the most heavily guarded
"Then you'll be an advocate for mental health awareness and proud of the obstacles you've overcome to get there," Kali replied firmly, putting a hand on his shoulder and shaking him slightly. "Take advantage of this situation, Cas. Figure your shit out and be honest with yourself and your doctor; with any luck you'll never have to be hospitalized ever again."
Dean nodded because he didn't think there was anything about him that he wouldn't want Cas to know about and if being honest was the easiest way to have a good relationship well, then he could do that no problem.
"It ended just fine," he said leaning his head over onto Meg's shoulder having to slouch down a bit to get low enough for the position to be comfortable.
Dean said, telling the background voices that he would be right back before Sam could hear footsteps and a door shutting through his phone's earpiece. His brother cleared his throat before speaking again,
"Cas, I lo-. Shit," Dean groaned, arching into the other boy's hand when Castiel turned his face into his hand and sucked his index finger into his mouth, moaning around the digit even as his tongue moved over the calluses that Dean hated. "Babe, fuck...you're so fucking sexy."
“Look at this photograph,” Dean wrapped up seriously, pointing a finger at Castiel who just clasped his hands to his chest in mock adoration. “Everytime I do it makes me laugh, everytime I do it makes me…”
The boy shuddered in revulsion and Dean couldn’t help but smile at the small admission he had managed to get from his so far reticent classmate, of course this otherworldly person was named after an angel.
"I didn't say what you think I just said," Castiel said meekly, edging farther out of the kitchen even as Crowley clambered to his feet and started following him.
It was more of a shriek than anything else that came through his phone as the cable car appeared over the rise of the closest hill, bell chiming merrily to announce its arrival. "
"I saw you," Becky said softly from where she had moved to sit on Dean's other side, taking the seat that Charlie had vacated when the redhead went to go play ping-pong with Ash against Ruby and Lilith. She was reading one of the broken-spined mysteries off of the bookshelves in the common room, but Cas was pretty sure it was a cover for her to observe everyone else without being noticed.
"Sorry, Cas," The younger boy said smiling widely as Gabriel entered the room holding a cherry pie with lit candles stuck into it and singing some made up song about birthdays that he changed from year to year and person to person. His older brother really liked birthdays.
"Got it boss," Dean replied seriously, the suddenness of everything that he might of fucked up hitting him in the chest like a tangible force that made him stagger even though he was standing still. "Fuck, Meg. What if he is cheating on me?"
At the end of the day, he trundled home in order to toss on his badly abused wrinkled brown suit, Chuck even thought about shaving, but it just seemed like too much effort and that was why he only did it when Naomi started giving him that disapproving look, the same one that she got near the end of the school year when he got really sloppy and obvious with his drinking because that was right around the time that Rebecca had left him. It had been almost five years; Chuck didn't know why he still let it get to him so bad.
Her coworker called them all whores, men and women alike because she said there was no point in sugarcoating it. Eve told her to shut the hell up and get back to work, sending her off with another client because Abbie's special talents made her a particular favorite amongst those who frequented Eden. The clients only had one name, no matter what their gender was or what they asked to be called in the private rooms that each of the workers had in the sprawling complex that sat on the outskirts of Lawrence, Kansas; they were always Johns.
He was usually the one running out on his dates and as a rule he never ever brought guys back to his apartment. Not because he was embarrassed of his humble abode or anything, he had tried to make it as comfortable as possible and all of the small personal touches he put into the space made it feel like home. It was because of that one time back in Kansas when Sam was still doing undergrad work and Dean had brought a guy named Alistair, or at least he had said that's what his name was, home and proceeded to get the shit beat out of him when he wouldn't do of the kinkier things the other man had wanted to do in the bedroom.
"Well, if it ain't like that then you two have yer head so far up yer asses it's a wonder either one of ya can breathe. That boy is downright smitten with you, Dean and if you knew what was good for ya you'd grab onto that and never let anyone take it from ya."
"I met Dorothy once," Dean muttered. "Oz, Dorothy; cool chick. Wonder if Alice is real too...feed your head."
He even complimented Luc’s runway outfit for Christ’s sakes so he must have been feeling extra charitable.
Castiel felt Dean's hand grip the front of his shirt and he put his own over the clenched fist of the other boy, rubbing a thumb over the warm rough skin at the edge of Dean's palm. "I hit my head pretty hard on the way down and I slammed into the wall at the bottom, cracked a couple of ribs. Fractured my skull, some freshman girl found me when she was sneaking out to the roof to smoke a cigarette. The nurse said she thinks they had left me there for like two maybe three hours. My dad came and got me from the hospital, I never saw Daniel again."
Castiel didn’t reply to this in writing, instead he just ran a finger over the controls of his iPod until the screen lit up and he tilted it towards Dean so he could read it. Dean read the name of the artist and shook his head slightly indicating to the boy that he wasn’t familiar with it.
"He was worried about me?" Dean asked sounding slightly dumbstruck and lowering his arms long enough to give Charlie the perfect opportunity to hit him in the face one last time before climbing off of him and ambling over to Castiel with a relieved smile on her face.
Castiel took his normal route towards the school, cutting down the side streets and back alleys of DUMBO in order to reach the Brooklyn Bridge and the pedestrian walkway that spanned the length of the metal structure. As he rode, he wondered if anyone would miss him and how long it would take for Balthazar to notice that he was gone. It would probably take them running out of tea or milk or something since the foreigner didn’t like to go grocery shopping, but Castiel had just gone a couple of days before so it would still probably take his closest friend a while to piece together what had happened.
His boyfriend let out a tired sigh and ran his hand over his face, the tie for his dress uniform was crooked and his shirt was untucked and wrinkled from where he had been wearing it all day. Dean felt slightly bad for bringing the dance thing up again, but why the fuck had Cas even bothered signing that fucking petition if he didn't want to go to the dance?
set. And there was Cas leaning on Roche's shoulder, smiling at the other man's phone and fucking letting the director run his fingers through his hair. It wasn't possible, this couldn't be happening to him,
"Well, let's just say that this is your first epiphany," the therapist replied smugly, watching him closely as he ran his fingertips over the spines of the books and notebooks that were in the bag. "Life is not fair, for anyone. And you learn to make the best of what is given to you, to preserve despite the odds, and to recognize what is really important."
"Then is it so selfish of me to want one thing for myself?" Castiel asked desperately, his stomach roiling with anxious guilt when he thought of the faces of all of the kids who were now attending the school that he had personally sweated over to help build. It
“Alright, Mr. Winchester,” Castiel said, snapping off his gloves and walking over to drop them into the trash. “You look like you’re in pretty good health, your blood pressure is a little higher than I would like, but if you reduce your sodium intake that would probably get it back down. I assume this physical for a job of some sort?”
"Hey it's okay," his brother said soothingly, moving quickly to wrap Dean in a hug because he was crying over one of Cas's stupid shirts in his dresser drawer and he hadn't even realized it until his brother had pulled him back against his chest and tucked him under his chin. For once the fact that Sam was taller was a good thing because he was falling apart and the younger boy had always been better at doing the whole touchy-feely crap than Dean had been. "You'll be okay. We'll sort this out, alright?"
Castiel shook his head and made to move down the hallway that led to the cafeteria; the Impala was outside because he had refused to accept a ride from Jo or Meg to school and he had figured that it would give him and Dean an exit strategy if they needed to get away from their friends' questions about their busted lip or blackened eye. He just needed to shake Chuck and then he could go and tell Bobby everything; Bobby would know what to do.
He listened to tapping keys of the other woman and tried not to keep glancing over at the small glowing screen as she worked. Dean pulled open his fridge and was met with an odd assortment of condiments, enough ingredients to make a couple of omelets, and a large variety of beverages both alcoholic and not. The man let out a frustrated groan and shut the door with probably a little too much force so that he could rake his eyes over the different menus for takeout that were stuck to his fridge with the Lego Star Wars magnets that Sam had shipped to him as part of the older Winchester's birthday present back in January.
He leaned heavily into the pole beside him after hanging up, letting out a grateful sigh when Meg tangled her fingers with his and gave his hand a squeeze. In the seat beside her she had picked up Charlie's hand and Charlie quickly caught Dean's so that in a roundabout way he was holding his boyfriend's hand; it wasn't much but he appreciated what the two girls were trying to do.
