“Oh my God,” I hear John say. Around us, hell breaks lose. The plane lurches again and again, people are screaming, the flight attendants trying to keep control. John instructs about how to brace for impact and that I need to put on my oxygen mask before I help him with his should he be unconscious already. He is on the edge of panic.
“Funny,” I say, trying to put just an extra amount of smugness into my voice. (Not really hard to accomplish, I must admit.) “John and I always waited for you to be gone before we got started.”
John looked at the marble wall that had been opened with sheer force. Sherlock had just thrown a superficial look at the site a few moments before. “This must have been extremely loud. Is this why the security team came in?” “Well, no,” Mandini admitted “but that's not a surprise. Actually, just like the residents, the security team has been informed by a faked ministerial letter that there would be some disturbances at night due to construction works at the piazza.” He reached inside his pocket and fished out a very formal looking piece of writing. “Barry, over here,” John shouted, wanting Sherlock to have at least a look at it.
I want to laugh out loud but the sound gets caught in my throat. A terrible whimpering comes out instead.
I need to even my breath, even my thoughts, my up-roaring feelings, because it is a big thing I need from him. But I need it nevertheless. And I need to say it now.
(just like that, suddenly, eyes empty, body strangely slumped, looking much smaller than when she was still alive, and why do I think about that? Completely irrelevant, isn't it? But it was me who emptied those eyes)
Pezzutto shrunk a little, but bravely ventured on: “Well, he shot Adigi in the head...” “Without making Adigi turn around at the sound of someone entering his room through the window? Without leaving gunshot residues?” The Carabinieri's eyes started to blink rapidly.
Strange chemical things happen to a human body in those post-orgasmic seconds. So I have to giggle while pulling him closer so he can cry into my shoulder.
(hasn't made up his mind about the city just yet, always needs some time before falling for a place, but has already realised I love Italy, wants me to share it with him, “We're still friends, you know?”)
He gives me a wry little smile when he notices me noticing his glance. He shrugs, not apologetically at all, and reaches for my hand. For a moment he gets sober.
“The secret of hiding is decency” he heard Sherlock's voice from behind. “If someone was looking for us they would search for a tall dark-haired man in expensive clothing and a small blonde one in jeans and jumpers. We won't need that much of a disguise to hide.”
It is a seriously, deadly crime scene, but it is way too pink and purple to remain serious. “What a sad example of post-coital tristesse,” Sherlock hisses into John's ear, and they can do only so much not to giggle loudly. “Gives the expression petit mort a whole new meaning,” John hisses back.
“I spent the last days trying to make up something half as romantic as your best man's speech, but I can't, so we'll keep it simple.”
Then his eyes fell on the fourth person's vita. Ronaldo Adigi, the young banker who got killed here at home in a burglary. He looked at the single word inside the circle, and what had been an unpleasant mixture of astonishment and fear turned into a rush of anger. Really a much, much better feeling, he secretly admitted to himself. He furiously turned towards Sherlock. “What does that mean, “gay”?” he shot, and continued to study the sheet. “Here, look, he was semi-famous in Umbria for this blog he had. Why did you circle gay?”
Again, Moran seemed to buy it. “It will soon be over, John” he promised. When he was ruthlessly yanked onto the chair, his glance fell on the object Moran had placed on the table: a gun. Moran might be running out of time, but he had also believed John's performance as Sherlock's deeply disappointed friend/more than friend.
(no order gone out, not expecting any contact, must be an assault, five ways to overpower the intruder, it was a man's voice, wasn't it, didn't pay enough attention to it, his mood, should have been more alerted, too lost in thought, concentrate!)
Time loses meaning afterwards. I know that I spend the first night crying, but after that, all days blur together like wet colours on canvas. Well, colours … A paralysing artwork made of grey and gainsboro and darkslategrey and black.
Emmi lightens up the mood by squealing at all the wrong moments and Daddy slips away unnoticed only to tell the chronicler's son about little Sherlock's pirate adventures. Incredible how much you can loathe the ones you love.
“Look at me,” he whispers. There is pressure on my cock now, and release, and pressure again, a slowly pulsating rhythm. God.
Poor boy, John thought. Pezzutto seemed to think the same. He started to sweat a little. The nice smile on Sherlock's face grew a little broarder. “And could you please tell us what you think the murderer has done in here?”
Steps in the alley, someone shouting. The beeping sound in Sherlock's ears is too loud to understand but the resonance the voice leaves in Sherlock's stomach tells him it is John. He wishes he could raise his head for he is longing to see John's face.
My mind is trapped in a vicious circle, cannot break free on its own. I stop working on the graves, go back to walking the island and sitting on benches. Going backwards. Regressing.
The moon is nearly full and illuminates Sherlock's face. It is almost unbelievable how young and innocent he looks at night, with this nearly transparent skin of his and those delicate lips. It is completely unbelievable how much John is in love with him.
“You promised not to give up, but you did, didn't you? In the end, you gave up.” He is nearly crying now, and so am I. Because I know what he is talking about, and I know that he is right.
Before John can answer, another nurse comes and pushes us first into an elevator, takes us to the casualty ward and into another room. A standard four-bed hospital room.
How can he not notice the eerie look on John's face when he thinks that Sherlock has caught him wondering about the peculiar colour of Sherlock's eyes? How can he not notice why John never minds him violating his private space? How can he not notice John is finding excuses to touch?
“I planned it. So carefully. And yet, it went wrong!” she still fumes. “You just can't make proper plans when children are involved! They always ruin everything.”
I hate fighting with John, but the idea of splitting the family up drives me insane. John hates fighting with me less than I hate fighting with him. He would not normally do so while I am still trying to wrap my mind around the fact that Mycroft is gone for good but the idea of waiting for Mary to move drives him insane.
“You will be taken to Stockholm” Mycroft answered the unspoken question, “I've already arranged for the best hand-surgeon I know to take care of you.”
John grinned. “Are you trying to make a reference to pop culture?” “Yes. Must be your bad influence.” He grimaced in slight disgust, while John just shook his head. “You know, these references would be a lot more pointed if you would bother to remember the names of the shows.” Last time that had happened on a case it had taken John nearly twenty minutes to find out which show Sherlock meant when he said “the one with all the lousy actors”.
John does not play fair. Completely underestimated his wickedness and was hence made to talk about Christmas Past. His method was mean but efficient. He hugged me without warning, dragged me down to the sofa and held me until I felt safe. That bugger. Felt so safe that I've told him about all childhood Christmases I could remember.
And that was the main reason why John did not think that today was perfect. He was married to a woman he no longer loved, best friend of the man he loved instead, and had never found the guts to tell at least one of them the truth.
When Harry is gone, Sherlock wordlessly climbs into John's very narrow bed and refuses to let him go for eighty-four minutes. He breathes in John's smell, feels John's hair on his cheek and the slightly trembling movement of John's thumb on his arm.
My mind starts racing, deducing five people per minute. I am only half aware of John guiding me towards our hotel (smiling). I think I am sharing some of my deductions with him but I am not sure. No time to listen to myself. My mind is working at full speed again, finally, and I love every second of it.
John is lying not far from him but out of reach. He is covered in blood, gasping for air too. He is looking around frantically until his eyes meet Sherlock's.
Sherlock remembered seeing himself lying on a similar operating table, the surgeons stepping back from him, already taking off their gloves. It had been that moment when his inner Moriarty had reminded him of John being in danger, causing Sherlock to fight, and defeat, death. It had been a very important moment in the construct of reality he used to live in for a while. The thought that it did not match with reality bothered him deeply.
“So instead of surprising your parents in their sleep I found them in the nursery. And that wailing …” Mary is furious, nearly shrieking now. “I couldn't think clearly any more. And your parents were so pathetic and I couldn't ...”
He is still literally moving very slowly. But it is no longer the sluggish walk of an exhausted old man. It is the careful walk of a cautious soldier. He still expects hell to break lose any second because he allows himself to stay with us.
The loneliness had almost killed me. John was there, only four point eight meters away from me, and yet so completely out of reach. He was sleeping in his (their) bed while I was drowning on his sofa.
People are idiots. People will never understand that Sherlock is in love, actually truly, madly, deeply, and obviously, and only and all the other clichés. It's a good thing that neither Sherlock nor John are one of them.
One night, I have the most gruesome nightmare of all. Nothing spectacular happens, no dramatic scenes take place. I am simply walking through the streets of London, alone. I know that I am alone because John and Emmi are gone. I pass through crowds of people but whenever I get closer to some of them they move away. I am isolated amongst the masses (the way I was before John). Mary is always somewhere to be seen in the distance, watching me wordlessly.
When I go downstairs again, I find John half-asleep. (His head hurts even though he pretends to be fine.) Cuddling on the sofa is not easy with the cast but we manage for a while before I force him go to bed. I pretend to be tired as well and lie down beside him but I sneak out as soon as I am sure he is asleep.
Only ten minutes after falling asleep Sherlock showed signs of another nightmare building up, John noticed. He moaned in his sleep, his eyes were moving rapidly underneath his still closed eyelids.
Seb firing at John from over the room, hitting his lung, John trying to breathe, world spinning around him, blood filling his lungs, drowning him, desperate breaths jolting his body, shaking with horror and pain, still fighting for his life even though he knows he is lost, arms reaching out with no aim, desperately trying to grasp someone who isn't there, dying slowly enough to wonder why I haven't rescued him, closes his eyes, gone.)
They just sat like that for a while, resting against each other, until Sherlock turned on the TV again and spent two hours explaining to John that the cases in that American show were ridiculous as he would have identified the first serial killer instantly by the unnatural way he stretched the “a”s when he spoke and the second by the way he ate his hamburgers and what did they need such a big team for, anyway?
“You boys need some time on your own,” Mummy says one day, a pro pros of nothing. Daddy nods, and before John or I can protest, they book us a hotel in Flensburg.
Then he noticed Sherlock's pupils dilating with fear when it became obvious to him that John needed to bring up an enormous amount of control to prevent himself from showing Sebastian that he was thinking exactly what Sherlock had just said. “Don't show it,” he whispered under his breath, unaware of doing that.
John felt like somebody was pulling at his legs. His whole world was just turning upside down. Somehow his mind refused to believe it. And yet …
“John, I love you,” he repeats, crying now, rocking the dead body in his arms. He presses John's horribly lifeless face against his chest so he does no longer have to see those empty eyes and rocks him to and fro, to and fro. John's left arm makes a soft thud each time it hits the ground.
I think there should be feelings attached to those memories, but there are none. “Bit not good, that” my inner John says with pity. He is translucent, barely visible. He offers me some of his virtual popcorn. I decline.
It takes me twelve minutes to admit to myself that I am hurt. Because John is so angry with me that he left without another word. And because I am excluded. And I am nervous, because GraceNotEmilia might be born right now. And because I still don't know if John is angry.
Just when he thought that Sherlock must have fallen asleep again, he heard his hoarse voice, “Why am I in hospital?”
“To be fair, I tried to gently shake you out of it first,” he feels the need to explain, but my mind is already moving ahead. John mentioned divorce. Does not want to continue that relationship. Wants to leave a professional killer with trust issues and a jealous streak. Who has not hesitated to risk the death of his best friend (me). My subconsciousness was right (of course). John is in danger.
(slightly stiffer than usual but trying to hide it, shouldn't sleep on a sofa for four hours, no dark circles under his eyes slept better than I expected can't be too upset about what I did, was serious  about it yesterday, but is still here)
When he opens his eyes again, everything is blurry for a while. Then the world gracefully shifts into focus. Hospital, in the north of London, lamplight on John's face means after dark. Circles underneath John's eyes mean late night. Or deep emotional stress.
Maybe it's just John's problem, not Sherlock's. Some deep-rooted trust issues. Or maybe seeing Sherlock lying on the floor of the orphanage has just been some kind of test fate has sent for John, and staying right here by Sherlock's side is the only possible answer to that. Another testament to their tenacity. Yes, that is exactly how John wants to see it.
When their love making no longer hurt me enough, I started imagining them sitting at the beach during sunset, holding each other. That is all. No orgasms, no explicit talking. Just the two (three) of them, belonging together. That never failed to send me spiralling down into desperation.
That got him an astonished glance. Then suddenly Sherlock seemed to lose all the strength his anger had given him. He slipped deeper into his cushion. He paled, which made the rings underneath his eyes look even deeper.
It does not need the world's only consulting detective to understand that it is an attempt to restart a friendship. Red roses could not have been more romantic.
Sherlock, on the other hand, is still observing John closely. At first, John feels a bit like a celebrity. Then it dawns to him that he should rather feel like a lab rat. Or maybe like a nicely treated lab beagle, loved and petted regularly, but stuck in a never ending series of experiments.
He had planned to break the kiss after three seconds, needing to make eye contact with John, reading in his face that everything was fine, maybe even better than fine.
They stopped at the crowded Piazza Della Rotonda in front of the ancient building that looked somewhat more dingy than John had imagined. Sherlock's lecture on the Pantheon had been broad, and somehow John felt that a building that had once been dedicated to every god there was and that still served as a church should look more glorious.
I press his hand in return and do my best to look unimpressed. “Of course,” I say. My voice does not even quaver (that much).
Can Sherlock keep John's on-going erection going on for more than a day? (God, yes, and afterwards John has to admit that the relieve was well worth waiting for it)
Any possible answer to that gets caught in my aching chest. “You are not broken. Just bent,” I tell him when I can breathe again.
But with the email, John tells them how he cherished the time he had with Sherlock, writes lots of nice things about him, and Sherlock is flattered. He misses John's praise terrible. John describes how glorious it was to chase after criminals for some clients, how Sherlock saved him from a mediocre life.
“What does the forum say?” John asks with an innocent look on his face, “Is her behaviour still normal?”
On one very special occasion I even brought adventurous danger and satisfaction to a life, but that does not count for I went and shattered all the good things there might have been by jumping off a roof.
When John talks about his first encounter with him, my parents are laughing tears. “That was my boy,” Daddy says, “always knew how to make a lasting first impression.”
Oh. A new thought crossed Sherlock's mind. Was it his job as best friend and best man to talk to John about his feelings?
I can see it all on John's face, the pain, the hatred, the revulsion, the horror. Then the mourning that sweeps all other emotions away. If I still felt something myself, that look in his eyes would hurt me endlessly.
(A father (or dad) is a male parent who has raised a child, supplied the sperm through sexual intercourse or sperm donation which grew into a child, and/or donated a body cell which resulted in a clone. Traditionally, fathers act in a protective, supportive and responsible way towards their children. )
We are brought into some kind of hell for the wounded. There is no space left for us but on the corridor in front of one of the examination rooms. People on stretchers are rolled by, and for some reason my brain refuses to tune them out. A young boy, not older than seven, with a swollen face, crying for his Mummy. A woman, mid-sixties, unconscious, fractured leg. It goes on like that. None of them are getting any privacy in their suffering.
Then something fires inside my brain, a little thought fighting its way around the horror, kicking away consternation, making me think. Three plane crashes within two weeks. The similarity to the Kegwood air disaster. The chances of catching today's flight on camera. Two crashes within two weeks are unlikely. A staged crash today. Three staged crashes?
Before he can control it a thought crosses his mind. Good thing they did not spend money on  the advanced booking of those expensive opera tickets John wanted to have. The business conditions said no right of return even in cases of death.
His hand on my neck. “I need to handle Big Boy before he gets suspicious,” John explains. “Can I leave you here for a moment?”
Opening my eyes is a hard task and takes hours. Or so it feels. My sense of time is also off. When they are finally open, I do not understand what I see. I thought my head was bending down between my knees, and that I should see the cabin floor. I do see the cabin floor, but from the side, at eye level, not from above. That is weird. Did the plane get that twisted?
I hate when he talks in riddles. “What does this have to do with Dan Miller?” I demand to know, and now John looks me straight in the eyes, frowning a little.
He only realises he has stretched out his hand to touch Sherlock's hair when it is already halfway there. He lets it hover there in mid-air and stares at Sherlock for a very, very long time before returning to his own room.
Time passes. Autumn gets darker, the island even more empty. My heart, on the other hand, grows fuller and fuller because of Emmi. I no longer think about every sentence I want to say before really saying it (only about half of them). I sleep and eat and know many nursery rhymes and children's songs by heart and know which way to the beach can be taken by a buggy and which cafés offer a good place to change nappies.
John fell asleep on the sofa waiting for Sherlock to get out of his frozen state. When he awoke in the middle of the night, he was covered with a blanket.
As soon as the cab reaches the old, empty orphanage, Sherlock jumps out and dashes away, John as closely on his trail as possible. They pass the overslept overseer and stopped at the opening of the orphanage, watching the two men and their two minions. John grabs his gun, but before he can say something, Sherlock just nods at the man sitting on the ottoman, and sprints onwards, right into the centre of the attention.
John grabs me by my shoulders (one hand exactly where Mycroft's had been mere seconds ago) and shouts something at me. It seems to be very important, so I force myself to look at him and listen.
“She will love it,” John states the obvious. After watching both films about lost fish she has become even more interested in sea life than before. The book delivers some information but more important, it will give her the names of myriads of new kinds of fish. John and I will have to learn them quickly to keep up with her.
I had wanted to write a longer epilogue, but then Sherlock said something and John said something, and then all was said.
And out of training. Sleep deprivation and undernourishment had left their traces, he hated to admit. Sherlock seemed to be unaware of his panting, or maybe he was just ignoring it. Didn't matter, anyway.
Yet, I remain sitting on the ground, looking at her (not even knowing her name). She is unharmed except for the broken neck. A very fine line of blood has dripped out of her nose when it happened. It is still bright red but no longer running. (That should tell me how long I have been out but it doesn't.) A single strand of her hair (only one) hangs into her face, the rest is still neatly tugged away in a complicated hairdo. She is dirty, fine grey dust covering her. (Me, too?) Would she have refrained from flying if John had not reassured her?
The urge to reach out and touch him is overwhelming. When I softly stroke his cheek, he sighs in his sleep and turns away from my touch. Even in his sleep he cannot allow himself to be loved.
But well, the list is as endless as it is fruitless. It all boils down to one fact: John has been responsible but distant. I figured out that one before, thank you.
John lies awake for quite a long time, and wonders who that person next to him is and what he has done to Sherlock Holmes. When he is sure that Sherlock is fast asleep, he gets up again and ponders about that strange day some more. He feels like they had a terrific time together, even though he cannot say clearly why.
The next few days (or weeks? No, days) are a wild mixture of spending time alone and Mary playing her games. John does his best to get over not knowing if Harry is truly dead or not. I do my best to get over not knowing if John forgave me or not.
(completely miscalculating the amount of strength he has left, won't be able to stand on his own for more than five seconds, need to move closer)
And when the subtle signs could possibly indicate that he and John will not be together forever, this feeling turns into terror.
Sherlock's whole body tensed at the mentioning of the pool incident. So he had believed John to be Moriarty, if only for a second? A little detail that none of them had felt necessary to share with Mycroft until now, not even Moriarty. Charming.
Mummy goes on lecturing about the acteon tornatilis, telling me things I already know. At some point, her hand sneaks into mine. At another point, my head rests on her shoulder.
It is crystal clear to me now. (My deduction skills are working again. A unmistakable sign of my healing.) John was lying with his head in her lap (watching me not giving in just yet) when his bonds tore. (I recall now the way the ropes were lying on the ground). He let the ropes fall to the ground without moving much.
John put down the papers. For some reason he could not look at Mycroft but kept staring at the folder instead. “She is a serial killer,” he said after a while. His voice sounded hollow in his ears.
Mary, who has chained John up at the wall once more, kneels down next to me. (Again, all is set so John has to watch. Brilliant, I cannot help but think.) “You know the rules, Sherlock,” she says, unable (or unwilling) to hide her amusement. “Big Boy here will dip you in again and again until you ask me to stop. Or, of course, until you have drowned.”
John's head snaps up and I see his eyes grow wide with fear. It matches the ice cold fist that suddenly has a hold on my stomach.
And then, instead of finally dying himself, he is forced to stare and stare at the corpse of the man he loves. Please, God, let me die, he thinks. But even though he can barely breathe, death won't come. Agony is burning, his ears are ringing, but he still stares and stares.
I wait until I am back home before I cry a little. Only a little. Then I cuddle Emmi and prepare to take John for dinner.
Mycroft's men lead Mary to a car that has mysteriously appeared in front of 221b. John and I follow them, but Mary spits venom at us, so we have to retreat into another car.
Molly's last good deed before leaving is shoving Sherlock into the room and closing the door from the outside.
It had taken John H. Watson an inexcusable amount of time to give in to it but in his defence it must be said that (a) at first he had thought they would have limitless time to figure it all out and (b) he had been so lonely and completely broken after Sherlock's faked death that even Sherlock's return had not mended John's heart instantly. And, of course, (c) he had been engaged by the time Sherlock finally decided to confess.
Congress member Farnsworth is an elderly woman that was hot once and is stylishly attractive now. Short grey hair dyed brown, jewellery a lot more expensive than it looks. Sleeps with at least three of the men that are bowing and scraping around her, and with two of the women. Is in love with the one she does not have sex with. Likes me. The feeling is mutual. Too bad we are basically standing on different sides. But that cannot be helped.
“He still hasn't found you, after ten days” Moran stated matter-of-factly, staring down at John. “Do you really still think he's seriously looking for you?” Of course. But John slowly raised his head, then let it drop with exhaustion. “No,” he whispered. “That hurts, doesn't it?” Moran went on, smiling coldly. John looked at the gun now, openly, not flinching. Allowed Moran to meet his hopeless gaze.
“Oh, good, you're awake,” Moran greeted him cheerfully, a little hammer in his hands. It was not difficult to make the connection between the tool and his fingers, and John's stomach clenched with foreboding. He clung to the thought that his death would not be the goal of this part of the torture. He briefly wondered why Moran had fixed his right hand and not his left. He had either missed the fact that John was left-handed, or had different plans for the other hand later.
He clicks the link and instantly feels his callous façade crumble to dust. Kensington garden, John and that Mary Morstan woman again. Her arm is placed around his waist. They walk down the alley, she pulls him closer again each time he starts to drift away. Cunt.
Then his eyes roll back into his head and he moans. In the distance, I can hear the siren of an ambulance.
In September, John wakes up from the worst nightmare he has ever had. He just does not realise it right away. He has dreamt that he was sitting in a rocking chair. He was old, and he was looking at a picture of Sherlock. In his dream, he was filled with fond memories of their friendship, feeling both  content and warm.
I move my head a little so I can see his face in the moonlight. He does not want to talk about it but he offers it anyway. I have missed the real John endlessly.
He quickly went through his memories. Then he sighed with relief. Redbeard had really been his dog. No poor little boy killed by a psychopathic primary school girl.
And he sees how broken I am. He sees that I no longer play the violin because I cannot bring myself to stop considering music as communication. He sees how I flinch when his mobile rings because people no longer call me, knowing I won't be able to answer. He sees how I try not to look at him longingly when I miss being close to him. He sees all that and it hurts both of us that he does.
Maddie takes her time drinking, but finally the bottle is empty. I heave her onto the changing table. There are three more postcards saying, “Thank you” hanging on the wall. The three weeks after the coloured lighthouse. People repairing the harbour after a flood. Tells me that he is slowly feeling better. Then, the small chapel near the beach. He has found a source of new strength. But then, the frigate at stormy weather. Relapse. Broke my heart once more.
“John, awake already,” Moran sneered, coming closer. Again, John didn’t need brilliant acting abilities to appear scared. He still had no idea how stable this man was, and he did not ignore the fact that (7) one wrong word could trigger violence that would certainly lead to a brutal death long before the intended torturing would be finished.
I have to think back on how we ended up together first place. His very first move was to be helpful (by lending me his mobile), then he felt useful (by coming to the crime scene with me and running over rooftops), and the next big step was him protecting me (from my own stupidity by shooting the cabbie).
Outside the window, the rough hills of Scotland change into the soft hills of England and then into the lively suburbs of London. London is home. Planes do not crash here.
221b has been “redecorated”. Tried to be understanding and asked John very concernedly how a bomb could have exploded inside the box with Christmas decorations and if anybody got hurt. Got a slight slap on my cheek for it by Mrs Hudson. And a mince pie.
I bring her to bed (her cot, standing in my room of course) and go back to my parents only to see them ordering a buggy on the Internet. When I enter the room, they both sober.
I wish I could say that John feels the same but there is still grim determination on his face. As for why, I don't know. All I know is that I no longer have the strength to pretend to be hopeful. I hope he can forgive me.
“So,” she goes on, “here is what we are going to do. Every time you talk, John will get hurt. Funny, don't you think?” She smiles at me (and means it. She really is enjoying herself right now. That is the scariest fact so far.)
One thing Sherlock never wants to delete is how John punches Mycroft at the morgue. Who would have thought that John could swear THAT strong? Not that Mycroft deserves it, his cooperation with Sherlock on faking his death is exemplary. Still, Sherlock cannot stop himself from feeling strangely proud of John when he sees his brother's swollen face afterwards.
Coffee is served and Daddy starts with an (also unavoidable) extremely detailed report of their journey here. After a while (they have just reached Belgium in his tale) Mummy leans over to me and whispers (so loud that Daddy can hear it), "Now you wish you could just tell him to shut up, right? "
I try to concentrate on the movement of his hand, but the thoughts inside my mind start whirling around again. Too exhausted to move them into a productive direction. Too exhausted to control them at all. I am sick and sad and lost, and only John keeps me sane at the moment. So much I need to tell him. So much I should have told Mycroft when I still had the time.
Only in the very end, when I realize that I have probably driven my transport too far, when I feel my heart tumbling into ventricular fibrillation, I instinctively stumble towards him, his hold on me the last thing I remember when darkness surrounds me.
I watch him drop to his knees silently, then, after a moment of swaying, falling forward, hitting the ground. He is still alive, but just barely, blinking, utter astonishment on his face. His breath becomes ragged, blood spraying out of his mouth, then his eyes lose their light, his dying breath painful. It is over within 95 seconds.
But now Mary is everywhere. How symbolic. Think of how she has rested here, body swollen and tired, while John was giving me a wank in the bathroom. Try to feel boastful and victorious, but only manage to feel offended by the lingering of her smell.
“Sherlock, I can't ...” No, this is not going to end well. I shake my head, trying to signal him to stop but he is determined. “Sherlock, I can't go on like that. It's not ...” His voice breaks and it is perfectly all right for me to be close to tears because he is, too. He caresses my hand, avoids my glance. How can he be so tender when he is about to shatter everything we have?
All my instincts tell me to embrace him, to tell him everything is fine but I do not move. Because he is right. And as unfair as it might be, as understandable my giving up might have been, he is right.
At that point not rolling his eyes was no longer an option. “All right, you sod, enlighten me with your superior insight,” he grumbled. How could he have forgotten how annoying Sherlock could be? “Of course, gladly” the other man answered matter-of-factly. “Imagine this: Four men sneak into the pantheon through the side-door. Bribed someone to get the key or bribed someone to leave the door open. Electronic surveillance is turned off, the pantheon empty, no spectators alarmed the police. Still, because of a “hunch” those three security men come in, confront the burglar, but only one of them is killed. A bit odd, isn't it?”
“Hello,” he says plainly, and Sherlock's hard-drive starts saving every detail on John's face and the look in his eyes and the curve of his mouth right now. How can someone not think that John is the most handsome being in the world? He feels like having hay fever and a heart attack at the same time. He still stares at John when he sits up.
“Love does not always last forever,” John explained gently. “I might have loved her, yes, but I no longer do. Not after what she did to you.”
"I did fail," I offer. (Hate how small my voice sounds all of a sudden.) "I was not able to deduce anything after you took me off the rope."
I stood with them inside their suite, watched them having sex. Mary on top (of course), both slick with sweat. I listened to John's heavy breathing, to the fast delivered sequence of “oh yes” and “harder” and “more” he will never say to me. I looked closely as his body became rigid with pleasure, watched his eyes flutter during orgasm, indulging the knowledge that I will never be able to make him look that way.
John shook his head. “Sherlock, no, really. You don't know the extent of that shot.” He took a deep breath and explained, “The bullet went through one of your ribs, your lung, your liver, your right phrenic nerve and your right rectus abdominis muscle. Each and every of these caused further complications, including a dangerous cardiac tamponade that made your heart stop for a while. You will suffer from all this for months.”
Davies looked at him curiously. “Well, it looked grim for a while, but from the report the main surgeon wrote later I take it that they stopped the bleeding rather quickly and then managed to shock your heart into working again.”
(“I have, by the way, a job offer I should like you to decline,” my inner Mycroft repeats the real Mycroft's words.)
I am sorry for the delay, but actually I am desperately looking for a native speaker who would be willing to beta this fic from here on. So, I shamelessly use this note to ask you all: Is there someone willing to jump in? I need help mainly with the finer details of grammar, like tenses and prepositions (evil little bastards). Input on the plot is not necessary, but always welcome.
Around John's birthday Sherlock seems to write an etude for John that he embellishes every time he plays it. He never mentions it, but wakes John up playing it on his birthday with breathtaking excellence and exactitude, otherwise claiming not to know what day it is.
“Just a moment,” John said. After a while, he saw Mary crossing the hospital's car park. He watched her enter the car and drive away. Then he turned around to face Sherlock.
They clink glasses. “To us,” John says and looks deeply into Sherlock's eyes. Sherlock has to swallow a lot of wine to compensate the temporary blankness of his brain.
“You did the world a favour when you shot him, Sherlock. And I did the world a favour by having Jesterton arrested, no matter on what charges.”
Later, John wonders if he should mention at least some of the things he loves so much about Sherlock in his eulogy. He thinks about it on the way to the chapel, he thinks about it during the brief ceremony.
He falls asleep soon, and after an hour he turns around in his sleep, facing me. This is the first time I really observe. There are dark circles underneath his eyes. Wrinkles on his face that were not there two weeks ago. The broken nose is already healing, and it will remain slightly crooked. He is pale.
The only memory I am not able to access is what Big Boy did to me (raped me) that last night. I try and try but fail.
He dreams about a magician with dark curls and piercing eyes. John watches his show, and mistrusts every so-called magic trick that is displayed. He tries to understand all the tricks and in the end, he dissects them all. Instead of becoming angry, the magician acknowledges John for it. It does not make any sense at all, does it?
When I pick up John at eight, he has taken a shower, is shaved and wearing fresh clothes. His bag is not unpacked. He does not smile or touch me but follows me without resistance.
Then the dreams become more confusing. He dreams about a map of London. In one place, it says “Sherlock” instead of “Cemetery”, which makes sense. Then the letters start to move all over London, then all over the world. Which makes absolutely no sense at all.
Feel the muscles on his neck to confirm something I have suspected long ago. Yes, there it is. A series of very telling little knots. “The chair in your office was a bit too high. You had to tilt your head a bit to work at your PC. It must have been uncomfortable, but you never adjusted it.”
(Is he feeling any better than me? Surely. He has to feel better. But wouldn't he have contacted me if he were better? But he cannot still suffer. That thought breaks my heart even more than the thought of a John who is better but does not want to call. So he has to feel better. But why hasn't he contacted me?)
Sherlock needed a long moment to realise he was awake now. In the beginning he had known it was a dream but somehow that was forgotten after the explosion. He gasped for air, trying to calm down. Only a dream. Only another brutal, cruel, devastating dream.
Out of the corners of my eyes I see Janine tensing up. Her eyes sad, she reaches for my face again. She cups my cheek this time, strokes it with her thumbs. “Sherl, no,” she says, “something serious?” She watches my face attentively. Shakes her head a little.
When the grunting goes on, I tune it out and when he doesn't stop pushing, I hide inside my mind palace, press my face into Redbeard's fur and wait for it all to be over.
Romford. That's were Harry lives now. I see John tensing. Mary ruffles his hair, her back turned towards me (so I can't read her).
John writes a malicious letter to Mycroft. There are so many things he would like to shout right into the other man's face, but then Mycroft would tilt his head just like Sherlock and deduce John's  intentions just like Sherlock, and then John would have to admit that with Mycroft he feels closer to Sherlock than in anybody else's company.
“Now you understand why Mycroft had put you to the test in the warehouse.” John nodded thoughtfully. “I always thought I had passed that test,” he said. “Oh, but you didn't. You failed, and failed spectacularly. When Mycroft realised how loyal you were after just a few hours, how determined, how brave... All those weak little traitors that had moved in with me over the years had never bothered him. But with you, he instantly increased the surveillance at the flat to a maximum.”
“And?” Sherlock's voice suddenly asked right next to him, and John couldn't help but jump. Damn. He looked up quizzically. “And... what do you want to hear?” This of course brought him only an “Isn't-it-obvious”-look. “Tell me something about the victim,” Sherlock commanded, looking at him expectantly.
He is by John's side only seconds after his body hit the ground. Ignores the fact that his hands are trembling when he checks for vital signs. He finds none. Cardiac arrest, his minds delivers. Chances of survival exist only if ambulance is called fast and CPR is given immediately.
John went to the window. “Let's let the sunshine in, right?” he said to Sherlock, and did not wait for his answer before pulling the curtain back. He needed to see Mary leave.
I silently wait for him to tell me whatever it is that made him take the long journey from London to York. (By helicopter, provided by Mycroft.) Hear him clearing his throat. Brace myself (as much as possible). My body tense, my mind too. Come on, hurry up. Tell me you are angry with me. Tell me that this has been the last time I left you because you are leaving me now. Tell me how you will raise the baby with or without Mary, but definitely without me. How you will grow old without me.
She looks at me carefully. “He … left with the two o'clock ferry. Needs to pick up a few things we forgot back home. He will be back in two or three days.”
This time he brings the mail he sent to Mary some months ago, and they go through it together to find out how Sherlock could have messed it all up.
High velocity impacts usually make it hard to identify the victims. The fact that John's body and mine might get inseparably scrambled touches my heart. It's poetic, in a cruel way. I look at him one last time, take in all I can. My final gulp of air before drowning. Then I brace for impact.
One day Sherlock sits over an experiment in the kitchen, emulsifying something or the other, an effervescent fluid placed next to him. It is not one of the entertaining experiments that draw John's attention to the kitchen. It is one of those John does not fully understand, with complicated chemistry.
(is this what imminent death does to people? Grabbing the arm of your killer, clinging to the only other human soul within your reach, regardless of the fact that he is the one who just took your life, holding on as long as possible, even though you have realised instantly that you are going to die? Looking for what, comfort? Being saved?)
They seem to return to normal soon, but John cannot help but feel like something went overboard that day at the orphanage.
Two more strokes of my hand and he starts to sweat. One more stroke and he is close to coming. (Apparently he has not touched himself at all.) (He is starving.) But he is John, and he always manages to surprise me. Instead of letting go, he suddenly turns around and kisses me.
Sherlock eyed her curiously. “You were in my simulation,” he told her. “Your voice, at least. But I thought you'd be a brunette.”
Studying the Word document, I cannot help but admire her manipulation skills. Everything mentioned is the truth. Only that the data is incomplete, essential facts missing, thus creating a new, better reality.
The call that had pulled me out of my disturbing dreams is repeated. Why did I sleep so long? Memories are crawling back slowly. Case. First one in nineteen weeks. Closed room mystery. Never been able to resist. Wish I had.
“Not sex,” Sherlock huffed. Or tried to huff, while he rather felt like giggling because John had just said that he had been really good. “This.”
He meets Greg over some mulled wine at the Christmas market, but then realises that alcohol is probably not the best idea right now. For drinking himself senseless is far too tempting, and he does not think he could stop his drunken self from doing something extremely stupid.
“Calm down,” Sherlock says, trying to sound as gentle as possible while panicking himself. “The ambulance will be here in no time.”
He looked at Sebastian coldly now, and said, imitating him: “Dear Jim, I'm looking for a way to hurt an old friend of mine. I think you know him already...”
Turns out that in the end there was nothing wrong with us at all. I am only glad that Mycroft lived long enough to realise that, too.
“I need to think” he declared, sinking down on the sofa. John nodded: “I'll go and get the paint out of my hair.” He got no response, but hadn't expected any. Sherlock seemed to be deeply lost in thought already, so he went into the bathroom to wash his hair.
When she is on her way out, she turns around one last time. “Watch out for your family, Sherlock,” she says seriously. “Mary is really, really angry. Please don't underestimate the resentment of a woman.”
Before I can give his comment any thought, he goes on, “You cannot open the door, so you simply turn away. You cannot play the violin, so you simply let it rot in the corner. You cannot speak, so you simply remain silent. You cannot stand to think about how broken John is, so you simply ignore it. When did you become such a coward?”
Mycroft paused the file again. “You know that it is not true,” he stated, watching his brother closely. “Yes” Sherlock lied. Had he been a less controlled person, Mycroft would have rolled his eyes. “Observe,” he said, gesturing at John's face, relaying the scene frame by frame. “Notice how his lips relax and his eyebrows rise. He had been facing problems before, but now he's gaining ground again.” And when Sherlock still didn't react properly, he emphasised again: “Because what Sebastian says is not true.”
When Emmi demands feeding at 4 in the morning, I am out of bed before John even wakes up properly. Feeding her now is exactly what my battered mind needs. (Love the night feeding. Just her and me, the only people awake in the whole world. The most intimate part of parenthood.)
When I fail to come up with a helpful thought, he sighs (quite histrionically) and asks, “Why don't you talk?”
John shakes his head (but in that peculiar way that indicates annoyance, amusement, and affection at the same time and usually leads to another kiss). I beat him with that kiss and he smiles at me afterwards. His hand remains on my hips.
“What is going on in your mind palace right now?” John's voice makes her crumble to dust. When did he start embracing me? (There is no better place on earth than in John's arms. What a shame I missed some minutes of it.) Instead of answering I lean into the embrace. Does he understand what I am telling him this way? Seems like he does, for he does not ask me again.
We are not good at talking, me even less than John. I remember his love declaration one and a half years ago. I was at a complete loss of words (me!) so I just pressed my forehead against his and then I kissed him. The first time I really talked to him afterwards was when we were finished shagging each other into the floor. Shagging had been better than talking, more intimate and straight to the point of our feelings. Ever since then, we have simply accepted that talking is not one of our strengths.
When she does not go on, Daddy continues, "But only if we feel that you are stable enough to appreciate it - and to keep it in one piece."
(unpleasant, overstepping his boundaries on purpose, but don't flinch, don't show rejection, don't give him the satisfaction of a reaction)
I watch his mouth close in surprise when Daddy wordlessly lifts him, throws him over his shoulder and carries him outside (to give Mummy and Mycroft a break, no doubt). I follow them. The new ferry I'm standing on is slightly different from the one I remember, but somehow that does not disturb the memory.
John sat down on the chair next to Sherlock's bed. Too far away but at least he was there. He had not reacted to Sherlock's speech still sounding wrong by the way, another thing Sherlock silently praised him for.
When did he get this needy anyway? It must be some bizarre chemical reaction. And yet, here he is, more than a year after his fall, contemplatively sitting in an Australian cyber-cafe, with a strange cramp in his chest. Checking the link he has got would be imprudent, but in the end the curiosity about what John does gets the better of him.
So instead, I open my laptop and cannot help but do some more research on the crash. Pictures of the broken plane. Short reports by other survivors. Nothing new from everybody's hero of the AAIB. He surely sleeps tonight, undisturbed by thoughts of the victims, unaware of the survivors' pain. (I know that for I have been like that once. Happy about a serial killer, rude to witnesses. Life had been easier those days. And colder.)
The beach at very early sunrise, a tiny reason for hope after the relapse. A little nearby waterfall. The town hall in spring time, the flowers in front of it in full bloom. The lighthouse, with a sky that says early in the morning on a sunny day in spring.
I place Maddie at the baby blanket in the middle of the living room. He has been standing here on The Day Of The Gunshot. She has been in front of the bookshelf. Had to swing her gun from him to me and back again that way. His weapon hidden in the kitchen. Too far away. Maddie up in her room. Not far away enough. I blocked her path without thinking. Loaded guns expose our priorities just like fire does.
Later he will surely be ashamed of it but right now Sherlock willingly lets his big brother take over. The Bathroom Incident lasts for twelve minutes. When Sherlock is done vomiting, Mycroft forces him to undress and shoves him under a hot shower. When Sherlock comes out of the bathroom, only slightly shaking now, his brother has found out that one of the letters on the kitchen counter had been prepared with a rare contact poison and has already informed the hospital that the antidote against it is on its way.
“I want you to deduce every little thing I did to him from his corpse.” He leaned down and pressed his cheek against Sherlock's
“I don't know what to do with you,” Sherlock confesses, and John's smile widens. Of course, John knows what to do, and so Sherlock generously lets him take the lead.
How do you react to a (true) statement like that? I do not know so I stick to plain honesty. “Yes,” I say again.
It is a strange sound (no explosion) with some kind of an echo (coming from outside the plane). The vibration of the plane changes slightly (engine problem?), the orientation of the plane does not (nothing serious, at least not yet). People around us start to murmur (no panic, that's good).
What a relief to find his deduction skills still intact. Sherlock refrained from saying any of it loud. There was no need to impress the man. "You are younger than me," he commented instead.
Text him that I hope the baby is all right anyway. Then write another text to add that I also hope he is all right, too. Then I remember that Mary checks his texts. So I write another text to add that I hope she is all right too. Then I text him again, telling him cryptographically secured that I miss him. Then things get a little out of hands.
The sun was shining now, a few white clouds hanging in the air lazily, birds were singing in fresh green trees. Never before has the weather fitted Sherlock's mood more perfectly.
We are lying so close that John feels it, too, but he does not force us further. He pulls me even closer and just holds me tight.
it feels like all muscles in my body cramp at once I am vaguely aware that I am falling to the ground as pain rushes through my body but I will not scream I will not scream I will not -
That leads me to another unpleasant thought: I will not be able to play the violin in reality for a long time but playing it is the only way of communication between Eurus and I. What will I do when visiting her again next week? I do not have the slightest idea.
Big Boy pulls me into a kneeling position again and there is Mary's face right in front of me. “You only have to say it, Sherlock,” she purrs, a satisfied half-smile on her (despicable) face. “Do you want me to stop?”
We are 27,500 feet up in the air, and there is absolutely nothing I can do to stop whatever is going to happen now. There is no way out, no trick to escape, no way to outsmart a plane crash. I am absolutely helpless, and without any responsibility to save our lives.
John shook his head. “She fooled all of us,” he said, and it sounded like he had said it before earlier today. Must have been when Mycroft had informed him about her earlier today. So Mycroft was blaming himself too.
Three weeks after Mycroft's death our patience is running low. Still no sign of where Mary is hiding, still no word from my parents and Emmi, still no idea what Mary is planning to do. John's nightmares about his evil ex-wife finding Emmi are so terrifying that he refuses to tell me the details. I don't have nightmares because I only sleep when my body forces me to.
The fire in the fireplace right next to them was making peaceful noises, giving John's face an almost unearthly glow. It was quite possible that Sherlock had never been that happy in all his life.
Dr Davies made a little break to let the implications settle in and went on, “Well, let's follow the way of the bullet. First, it hit your 5th right rib, shattering it so badly we needed to insert a metal plate to stabilise it.”
I remain standing in the living room for nearly an hour. Then (without thinking) I pick up my violin because playing is how I deal with pain but as always the bow stops just before it would touch the strings and the pain gets worse and worse. When I turn around, my eyes fall on the chair that will never be John's chair again and I become so angry that my hands start shaking. Before I know what I am doing, I am smashing the violin against the armrest, again and again and again and I don't even stop when the instrument is completely shattered.
And this is too much. Because I am missing the violin violently. Because I still hear the sound of the wind rushing by outside the cabin. Because I barely slept since the crash. Because John is still full of happiness and joy of life while I fail to be content. Tears are running down Rosie's face, and that does not mean that much for they also rolled down when she did not get another helping of apple crumble but they hurt me anyway.
“Well, that takes us to one of the things we need to discuss,” Dr Davies told him, sounding very professional and not the slightest bit pitiful. “You have lost 24 pounds of muscle mass during coma, which is a pretty normal amount.”
The sun is barely rising when I cross the Kiel channel. The country road we usually took is a highway now, but there are barely any drivers beside me. So I decide to stop on the highest point of the bridge like Daddy always did and get out of the car.
“Wings are cold and empty, while you are warm and caring. So I reduced the wing to a well heated living room again, with a comfortable armchair beneath the big window. One of those that face south-west, so the gentle evening sun permanently creates bright spots on the soft carpet and being there makes you feel safe and at home. I was fighting with the narrowness of space but solved it by including bottomless boxes.”
How long can he go without sex before agreeing to follow an ugly date to a concert of the “one and only” Ozzie Osborne? (six month, John really hates Ozzie Osborne)
Mummy forces us to do womanly things she calls “Talking About Our Feelings” and “Sharing Our Emotions”. Those are gruesome rituals and I deeply pity Daddy for being married to a woman. (The fact that all this talking and sharing helps to make me feel better is something I would never publicly admit.)
When he does not react at all, I go on, "Let me make sure that you regain some strength. Let me take care of your sleep and your nutrition and let me see to it that you get enough exercise. No obligations," I make clear when he frowns. Meaning: no need to worry about loving me or not. Just stay.
“I have already talked to Mycroft, “ John went on. Oh. “Back at the hospital, when the midwife sent me away to get Mary something to eat.” Then he explains me what will happen. That my brother has already prepared the papers John will need to annul the marriage. (Easy, let's be grateful Mary didn't use her real name.) That there will always be some of his minions who will follow the Watsons to hospital, standing by to arrest Mary the minute the baby is out. (Enough charges to press, attempted murder on Sherlock Holmes only one of them.)
In real life, John had never turned away from Sherlock. He had never abandoned him at Emilia Ricoletti's grave. He had never forgiven Mary. He had never beaten Sherlock so violently that Sherlock needed to be hospitalised.
Anyway. When John and Emmi join me for dinner, the three of us are just happy for a while. And when John puts Emmi to bed I remain happy. So happy in fact that I can only play light tunes on the violin.
My body goes from jerking to trembling, my hands slip from whatever part of John it was that they were clinging to. My brain is still not online again. I feel entirely boneless and would surely melt to the ground if it weren't for John to hold me and rock me and whisper words without meaning into my ear.
We share another smile, and then I lean forward and press a chaste little kiss on her cheek. “Thank you, Janine.”
“Me too” he offers. I stomp once more,only to let him know that I heard him. There is no way to say “I was scared for your life and love you more than you can ever know” by stomping your heels, so I let the change pass.
Please acknowledge my disappointment if you don't rule the world by now. It does not have to be official. You can rule it from the background. I think that is more efficient anyway.
They stayed like that for a long time, just holding each other. Then John felt Sherlock's body growing heavier in his arms. “You're exhausted,” John stated, silently cursing himself. He should have thought about the state Sherlock's body was in. Still suffering from the gunshot with all its consequences.
Sherlock divides his life into three parts. The first is pre-John. A dark and isolated time, filled with rejection and drug abuse and instability. But not with loneliness. There had been no loneliness before John because Sherlock never knew there was anything else than being alone.
And how had it been possible for Sherlock to observe it, by the way? He had not been there with John and Mary, and yet he had seen it all. Impossible.
When we are done fighting we are both so exhausted that instead of having make-up sex we merely have a make-up cuddle. And we still don't know what to do.
John stares at a point on the wall behind me for a while. Then he takes another big gulp of wine himself. "Because of you," he says.
Then, times flies again, and before John really knows what is happening, he is sitting in a cheap hospital chair, waiting for the neural surgery to be over, and then John is sitting in another cheap hospital chair by Sherlock's bedside, overseeing him day and night, wondering if he will ever wake up again or not, and then John is sitting in the same cheap hospital chair, softly talking Sherlock through his recovery, and then they are back home again, two weeks later.
“Really?” John asked, sounding surprised. “Oh, wow. I mean, you were really good and you seemed to know exactly what we were doing and ...”
“I am sure, John,” I hiss into his ear, pressing him close, not willing to let him go ever again. “I am sure, I am sure.”
Sherlock frowned, obviously deducing God knows what from John's face. Then all of a sudden he smiled, one of those rare happy smiles that always lit up John's mood. “I see,” he stated, and held John's gaze for a heartbeat. And another. And another. And another. “You see” John repeated, and ignored the blush he felt rising in his cheeks, for some strange reason not wanting to look away either. Then he smiled, too.
John's body slacked instantly, his mouth hanging slightly open, his eyes broken. The guard dropped him emotionless. John's corpse hit the ground with a thud, his head coming to rest in a painful angle.
“No signal down here,” he tells me. “Come on, we need to get you upstairs anyway. There are blankets to keep you warm and I really want to leave this room for good.”
Afterwards, when he sits in yet another lonely hotel room, he realises that John is not thinking about that, because he is sure that Sherlock is dead.
One month merges into the next. John's sense of time is completely malfunctioning. He moves out of 221b for a while and then back in again, but he could not say how long he has been away. He only knows that returning breaks his heart. Once more.
The next chapter might be posted a bit later than usually. To make up for it, there will be sex in it. ;-)
I can hold my breath for nearly two minutes More than enough time to consider what to do. Mary will stick to the scenario as before. I will endure the dipping as long as I can and then give in, asking her to stop (if Big Boy does not accidentally drown me before, which is not unlikely). She will hurt John afterwards.
After another thirty minutes, John sent Mary a text. “Back at 221b. No longer angry. Still need some time here.” He thought about adding, “Sorry” or “Don't worry. Everything's fine.” But everything was far from being fine, and “Sorry” was too shallow for the blunder he had made.
John's eyes flutter open, and he blinks. Searches for me with his gaze and finds me. There is no accusation in it but pain and disgust for her.
“And your acting abilities have clearly benefited from the heavy surveillance you've been under after my fall.” Now John began to understand what was going on in Sherlock's funny mind. “Good thing you have no difficulty telling when I was lying and when not,” he prompted, watching Sherlock from the corner of his eyes. “Of course” the consulting detective lied. Bugger!
He should be here any minute then, surely having noticed his captive's subtle movement. John nearly sighed. He knew he needed to be more alert than he was now, but it was so incredibly exhausting. Remembering his special training, he knew that this was the most dangerous part of any hostage situation – the aftermath of an adrenaline surge that was so vast that there was simply no energy left afterwards. But he needed to be at full attention soon, or he would die here after all.
After the extended visit with the Stamfords, she will be agitated for they always give her too much sweets and spoil her even more than we do. So our plan for today and tomorrow is to stay at home, go to the park maybe, and take it slow. Watching those clown fish again might be inevitable. Better than watching the funny pig family rolling on the floor laughing or Norman Price doing something stupid yet again.
“Not now,” I answer. He nods and presses my face against his chest once more. He sighs but only when he thinks I am asleep again.
“You need sleep!” he said matter-of-factly. They engaged in a staring duel and John did his very best not to think too much about how beautiful Sherlock's eyes were. It took him some willpower.
When John asks him about it, Sherlock gets evasive and pretends that it is Vivaldi. John feels loved anyway. If he could only make Sherlock realise that.
We stay like that for a while, until he starts to speak. Sorts of. “You nearly … again … you can't … I am so … and the baby … how could you ...damn … sorry, but … Sherlock … please, not again ...”
I want to ignore her. Want to turn away and leave her alone. Want to smash her head against the wall until her face is nothing but a bloodied mass. Would be perfect to do it in here. No child to endanger. She smiles, “Not that different, are we?”
I cannot wrap my mind around that. I have seen so much suffering, so many dead and dying people. How can there still be so many victims alive and in need of help?
When I settle down onto a chair besides his bed, a nurse hushes me away. Apparently I cannot stay here for the night, as the room is already crowded with five beds instead of four. I am fit to walk, and I will have to walk out of the hospital soon.
I look at him (with a smile I could not hide even if I wanted to) and know that he knows how perfect his present turned out to be.
But then, orgasms have not been something he had conjured up before John. Still, here he is, lying in his bed, thinking of John even during his post-orgasmic bliss. He is panting and wondering how thinking of John could have turned a solitary hand-job into pleasure.
Before long, I am knee-deep into research. I buy myself a new laptop and a printer (thank God there are international mail-order companies that also deliver to small German islands). Then I go to the local stationery shop and buy all kinds of coloured pens as well as pins and wool and turn the kitchen wall into an evidence board. Then I will my mind to work the way it has to in order to solve these kinds of cases.
Now he realises that will not happen. He has broken John by saving him. He will never get a chance to explain himself to John. They will never resume their life at 221b. Sherlock will come back, but  John will be gone, even if he is still there.
Sherlock could hear the unspoken “Why?” but ignored it. Why had he imagined him, of all people? Maybe there was something truly evil about him. Or maybe he was just one of the very few well-known people Sherlock knew. He sighed. There was still a lot of sorting out to do.
I write a little speech for John, about the problems of Mary's past and the problems of her future and not having read what's on the stick. It is touching. She will cry when he'll tell her. (And probably embrace him. Maybe even kiss him. Terrible thought. But necessary.)
He does not complain when they spend his birthday in the library, comparing lexicons because something about her linguistic knowledge is about to convict a landlady. Well, the fact that Sherlock wears his new lilac shirt that day knowing that it is a definite turn-on for John makes up for that. Definitely. And also the fact that they shag inside the library's toilet twice as a birthday present.
I think that he sees the gravity of it all in my eyes. His breath hitches a little. He swallows, and then starts stroking my entire body again, softer now, slower. I allow my head to fall back and close my eyes. The ultimate proof of my trust in him.
Or take eating, for example. At a certain point John simply loses his appetite. At first, he tries to eat enough anyway, but remembering it all the time is exhausting. So he eats less and less, and frankly he does not give a damn. But Mrs Hudson does. She marvels at his loss of weight, cooks him lush meals, asks him regularly what exactly he has eaten all day long.
he first thing John felt when he woke up was that he was lying on his back on something that could have been a table. He was restrained, but not tied too hard. Carefully he tried not to show that he was awake, listening first to collect as much information as possible.
“We will not be able to talk about a plan,” John goes on, “She is surely monitoring everything I say.”
I also wish he would let me give in. I have to blink. Could be that there are tears in my eyes. Not sure. I sigh. Exhausted, completely. Tired. Please, John.
The plan unravels. John “forgives”, Mary believes, everybody has punch or tea, John brought his gun and the helicopter is perfectly on time.
Yes. I first came here in my mind palace when Redbeard died. Without that garden I would not have made it through rehab once.
The confrontation with Mary goes better than I expected. I know (theoretically) that John no longer loves her. But seeing the full display of her usually well-hidden viciousness (she knows of course how much bending down to pick up that coin hurts me) only helps John to show his anger.
Been at a similar point of her life five years ago. Settled down with a nice, ordinary man. Got pregnant. Relationship didn't work out, he left her when she was into her sixth month. Two days later she had an accident at home, lost the child. Her description of the accident did not match all her injuries, but doctors blamed it on the shock of losing her unborn child.
There are still two graves without names on them, and now that we are no longer busy with healing, I commit myself to them completely.
But without John and without cases, he has all the time in the world. The only alternatives are watching telly and reading. Watching telly has taught him how to rim your car if for some obscure reason you should feel the urgent need for a racy ride on wide-based tyres. Reading made him long for a cottage in the countryside to keep bees.
When they are waiting for the results from the lab Sherlock snoozes lightly and John steals himself away for a minute to get some coffee. When he comes back into the hospital room, Sherlock is crying silently, with shaking shoulders. John just sits next to him, stroking his back. No words are spoken, but they do not need words now, anyway.
I follow the same procedure the next day. Only this time I go through everything that happened down in that cellar.
He nods, more to himself than to me. His voice is soft when he says, “It is too late, Sherlock. I am married. There is a baby on its way. It … it would be WRONG.”
On the way to the hospital (Hospital at Leeds, Leeds General Infirmary? Or somewhere else entirely? I have no idea how close to Leeds we have made it before dropping out of the sky. I have no idea where we are.) one of them tries to examine me for whatever reason but I hush him away. They need to concentrate on John.
Later, when they are home, Sherlock claims to be ill. He curls up on the sofa and demands attention and care. Mrs Hudson huffs at him, telling him that he should rather take care for poor John who nearly died today.
But instead of getting angry she only frowns at me mildly and then sits down next to John who was placed at the folding table by Big Boy. His hands are still tied together and Mary starts feeding him. Watching that is a lot worse than eating like a dog.
Emmi is the most emphathetic child in the world. She senses the change in her daddy and responds to it immediately. Her focus is entirely on him for the rest of the day. And he does not mind. In fact, he enjoys it immensely. When they come to join me in the kitchen after a while, he is several inches taller than just this morning.
Sherlock feels carsick from travelling across Canada once too often. He feels claustrophobic, like buried inside a coffin, when he sits in a cheap motel room, in a city whose name he will have forgotten again this time tomorrow. Wishing he had at least found a way to smuggle the Union Jack cushion out of 221b. Pretending it is the only comfortable cushion in the world. In reality longing for something that smells of John.
When Sherlock looked up at John sitting in the safety of the nightly kitchen, he could see the pattern the blood on Sherlock's hands would have left on John's face.
John closed his eyes, but that proved to be a mistake. Ashkan's friendly face appeared again immediately. He sighed again, glad Sherlock had decided not to face him. To his surprise, he felt the other man leaning closer, actually resting his head against John's. “You're saying that time won't heal all the wounds, then?” John gave that a sad smile. “No, it won't.”
Sherlock nodded his head slowly. “I see your point,” he said thoughtful. “Am I right, then?” John asked mildly surprised. “No, not at all. It was a serial killer, apparently, I just haven't figured out his scheme. But I like the way you thought about it. Intriguing what kind of intelligent ideas can come out of your ordinary little brain from time to time.” With that, Sherlock grinned at him and flopped down on the sofa next to John, his back facing John's shoulder.
It was a shame that John couldn't sell the violin for Christmas. He knew Sherlock must be missing it badly, but they had agreed that mourning John would not give it away too lightly. A good thing that Mrs Hudson had donated the microscope to a school while John was living at his transition flat.
To get his mind away from his claustrophobia Sherlock starts to wonder how petting inside an unbearably small lift would feel. Would it be a mixture of pleasure and fear?
My nervous stomach doesn't agree with the stale coffee. “You should store coffee in a dark sealed box” I tell John who starts grinning again almost instantly. Leans over and kisses my cheek.
The whip hits him again and he cannot help but groan. Watching him is so much worse than being tasered. I want to look away but can't. I am the reason he is in pain now and I cannot even tell him how sorry I am. The least I can do is stay with him and hold his stare.
The question hangs in the air, further bruising my ego. Because yes, of course we did. “Oops,” Janine goes, looking even more apologetic now. Comes back to me to pad my back. “Hope your ego survives that blow.” She grins now, and I remember why faking a relationship with her has not been as unpleasant as it could have been.
“You won't,” imaginary John said, letting a hand run through Sherlock's wild curls. “I know exactly what I am getting when starting a relationship with you.”
I bring my fingers into position, the bow is ready to caress the strings - when I remember the last time I failed to play. And the time I failed before. And before. Time stops. All that exists is the most wonderful violin in the world and my failures.
I rise and he gets up too. Slowly like an old man. "Can't sleep," he murmurs, tongue heavy, words slurred, eyes half closed.
He became painfully aware of the situation he was in now. John was holding him in his arms, rocking him like a child, while Sherlock was wetting his shirt with tears and drool. There was no dignified way out of this.
Still pretending to be sulking a little Sherlock started to pace through the room and explained what had happened in Rome just the other night. Impressively unobtrusive break-in at the Pantheon, remains of first Italian king stolen, three security officers involved, one of them killed.
“You called me lazybones just because I've been languishing on the sofa, even though I've been very busy learning Lithuanian,” Sherlock reminds him, sounding more like a five-year-old than usual.
They walked back in silence. Sherlock was still holding on to John's sleeve, a gesture that would have made John smile had he not just been demonstrated how serious the threat to his life was. Back inside their suite they checked each room carefully before Sherlock finally let go of John.
Sherlock's angry voice made John wake up with a start. He sleepily looked at the alarm clock at the bedside locker. 4:12 a.m. With a sigh he got up – and stopped almost instantly in astonishment. When he had fallen asleep last night, Sherlock had been sitting at the table, head bent over the files he had collected. Now one entire wall of the hotel room was covered with sheets of paper and photographs. Some of them simply hung there, others were covered with Sherlock's surprisingly neat handwriting.
His fourth finger wanders inside easily now, and I lose control of my hand. I had planned to continue stroking him softly, bringing him to the edge just with my fingertips, but in the wake of arousal I am grabbing him, holding him, becoming more and more fierce.
The nightmares bothered Sherlock so much he dedicated them a point in his email to Mary, a rather long one. He remembers the words clearly, “You can tell he will have a nightmare by the way he sits in his chair prior to going to bed. See pictures in attachment 1. Waking him when next to him can be dangerous (ex-soldier). Playing an instrument in another room shortly after the nightmare starts is a well-proven method. If you do not play an instrument, learn how to do so. Soon.”
The first one is Lestrade who hands Sherlock a manila folder from an unsolved case. John's interested glance is the only reason Sherlock bothers to look at it. He needs three minutes to find out that the acid attack was carried out by an actor who acted as ambassador of Abu Dhabi using a dead spy's alias. Ridiculous, really, for even among his ancient ancestors there is no one with an Arabian background, plus you cannot be the ambassador of a city. And the fact that he kept saying appetiser instead of aperitif should have told Lestrade everything he had to know. Stupid moron.
Three days later Sherlock returns from another long walk all across the city. In front of his door, there is a plastic bag. He eyes it suspiciously. It could contain several pipe bombs. It could also contain  … He hesitates briefly before opening it.
Then he thought of Sherlock, lying in his hospital bed, thinking about the same things. Alone. “I think I should return,” he told Mycroft and got up.
When he finally woke up properly, he wasn't at all surprised to see Sherlock sitting by his side. John blinked, finding that he couldn't speak, most likely due to a breathing tube. But he felt Sherlock's hand on his own. For right now, that was all John needed right now.
When he finally accepted that his brother wouldn't go away any time soon, he sat back in his chair again.
A young doctor was standing there. "Good morning, Mr. Holmes," he said. "Very good to see you awake. I would like to go through your condition with you, would that be all right?"
I hesitate for a moment but if there has ever been the need to be perfectly honest, it is now. “You would have blown out your brains yesterday morning and I would be on my way to bury you right now.”
Hundreds of years ago she would have been every minstrel's dream, with her elegance and grace and kindness. Sherlock would hate her. But Sherlock left him and is dead, hence his opinion no longer matters.
Mary sleeps for another two hours, and when she comes back into the living room, I am finally able to control my manic grin. The fact that John immediately switches to concerned husband makes it easy.
Then, time slowly picks up speed again, as John stumbles towards Sherlock, checks for and finds a pulse, calls for an ambulance, moves Sherlock into recovery position, talks softly to him while waiting for help, and Sherlock still does not move at all.
John barely leaves my side during the next weeks. He is there when I try to stand up for the first time after the surgery (and fail miserably. No one else would be allowed to see me fail like this.)
How my thoughts were swirling around the same topic again and again. The whole day, the whole last months I had told myself (successfully) that a wedding wouldn't change a thing.
John. Thinking of him hurts terribly. I should probably do what Mrs Hudson had suggested: loathe him for leaving me, loathe him for taking Emmi with him, loathe him for giving up. Instead, I am deeply sorry for him. (As if feeling my own pain isn't enough to bear.) I wonder how he is carrying on.
When we get out of the cab I tell myself to calm down. When I open the door, I tell myself to conceal it until John and Mary have left. When I go upstairs I tell myself to be patient. When I open the door I tell myself to hide my anger. When I enter the living room I tell myself to calm down.
John turns around to face me, emotions running across his face. He opens his mouth (to be angry with me) and closes it again. He opens his mouth once more (to apologise) and closes it again. He starts fidgeting and after a moment he snaps and storms out of the flat with Emmi in his arms.
The young medic brings herself to my attention again. She assures me that John is most likely to have only a concussion and that there are people who are hurt worse who will be brought to hospital first. Then she tries to examine me but I hush her away. She brings us blankets and a folding chair for me and hurries off to help the other survivors.
The woman's sexual interest in John fades instantly. (Ha!) She stammers some kind of “Thank you” and turns away again.
That specific night he had pondered on checking on his friend, for this whole hound thing had clearly shaken him deeper than he had cared to admit. But before John had reached a decision, the door to his room had swung open, and Sherlock had been standing there, looking scared. “I had a nightmare,” he had declared only a little too loud, and without waiting for John's reaction had slipped into bed, pressing his belly to John's back, spooning him, leaning so close he could whisper into John's ear quietly.
After Sherlock heroically solves the case in less than 24 hours, they turn in at the homey house bar of the hotel, and John teaches Sherlock all he knows about whiskey. Which might be a bad idea, for after the first glass John is already having fantasies of Sherlock, giving him a hand job in a hot bath or in front of a hearth fire.
Mycroft says “breakfast” with the same disgust he would use to say “daily soap”, “pop music” or “referendum”. I cannot help but smile a little. Then I close my eyes, only for a second, and there is the feeling of falling again.
Only that instead, he heard a rather unceremonious sound that could be inscribed like “clung”. Completely surprised, he looked up. Mary was gone, replaced by Mrs Hudson, who was swinging a frying pan.
And it hurts me to see him like that, knowing that I cannot help him. And he sees that, too, and it hurts him even more.
Then, finally, when it is already dark outside, a text. “False alarm,” it says, “Back home now and completely exhausted.”
I take the pen and want to start, but my hand somehow gets stuck right above the paper. Because down at the core of it, isn't writing just like speaking? Would it be cheating if I wrote down something?
(Fences inside the forest. Signs. I have reached the Vogelkoje. How very fitting. A place of slaughter, brutal death. A place of killing thousands of innocent stupid ducks. How very fitting to end up here.)
The panic refused to go away. To his shame, Sherlock felt tears roll down his face. He felt John's hand on his cheek.
The smug smile on Moran's face widened. “Yes, you will die here,” he said with delight, entirely misreading the reason for John's swallowing. Then his eyes narrowed. “Well, maybe I should deliver you from your pain right now. It won't matter how long you have been dead when Sherlock finally finds you, will it?” He's bluffing. God, let him be bluffing. The look in Moran's eyes grew cold, determined, and his hands closed on John's throat. Please, let him be bluffing.
(Asda’s Extra Special Fairtrade Colombian Roast & Ground Coffee. Unfortunately gone stale after being stored the wrong way for more than three weeks.)
Then I cannot help but imagine him sitting in Scotland, alone. With no one to protect, no reason to feel useful, no need to be helpful. How did he survive? The answer he gave me yesterday was not enough. So when Emmi takes her afternoon nap, I pluck up courage and ask him.
“No reason to fasten my seat belt?” I ask innocently and continue straight faced, “Well, experts might strongly disagree with you on -”
During the sixth round, Mrs. Hudson returns with a young woman. Au pair from Azerbaijan, his mind automatically delivers, auburn hair dyed black, almond eyes, considered attractive by most English men, avaricious, lives in an attic, current boyfriend Arsenal fan. She takes over after the seventh round for two minutes while Sherlock leans heavily against the kitchen wall, panting.
Hands on my body. Hear my name. Strange feeling in my throat. Not painful, just unpleasant. Restricted. Breathing against resistance. Dim light. A hand on my cheek, soft words murmured. John. His face close to mine. Oh, my eyes are open now. But unable to deduce anything. Want to touch him, but arms feel like lead. Tired. Fall asleep to the soothing sound of his voice.
When he reached their … no, his. When he reached his home, he barely made it onto the sofa before his eyes closed on their own accord. Just a moment of rest, he thought, Just close your eyes for a few minutes before you get going again.
By that, he gives me exactly what I need. He provides everything I need to know in the only way I can process it without going insane. Or being reduced to a victim.
The one thing I deduced when meeting her the first time. And she is a good one, it later turned out.
“You figured it out,” Sherlock states lively. “Well done, John. I really underestimated your lucidity!” Yes, leave it to Sherlock to make an insult sound like a compliment. There is another pause on Sherlock's part. Then, “Can we just presume that I have learnt the lesson and move on?”
With that, he left the two. In the door, he stopped again, and added, “Tell him about Redbeard if you must, and get the hell over it.”
I really do not know anything about plane crashes. Is it such an unusual cause of accident? It is highly unlikely that two planes in twenty years are destroyed by the same kind of mistake? Does the comparison mean anything? Or is it just an irrelevant bit of information?
I know that he is not just referring to me sitting here on that bench. He means the last months as well. “Yes,” I simply answer to both.
He grins at me, and there is a giggle bubbling up in his eyes. “Sorry,” he says to the woman, “he tends to become a bit jealous from time to time.” His eyes shift over to me, “For no reason, by the way”
It had taken him an inexcusable amount of time to figure it out, but in his defence it must be said that (a) it is extremely hard to deduce oneself and (b) never having been in love before he is completely new to the feeling.
All was well until Sherlock started speaking. “John,” he whispered, his voice raw. Only now did John see the dark circles underneath his eyes, the pallor of his skin, his blood-shot eyes. Oh. Looked like John had been out cold for a while, probably in a quite serious condition.
“What a shame that we can't order Chinese take-away on Amrum,” he says (with a soft smile in his voice).
He makes a needy little sound and slightly pushes into my fist. (He is unaware of that, his body moving on his own accord.) I have missed that sound, not sure I would ever hear it again.
“I love you,” I gasp between kisses. We barely talk during sex, and when something is said, it is of immense importance.
But John's head does not fall back with pleasure when I start biting (softly) into his earlobe. Why does his head not fall back? A little shift of my pelvis tells me that John is not aroused. But why is he shivering then? My hand seeks his face. It is wet.
When John opened his mouth to say something stupid, Sherlock forestalled him, “Don't you dare to apologise for bringing her into our lives again!” He watched John's eyes widen in surprise for a second. A wonderful sight. “I am sorry,” Sherlock went on. “I did not realise that she was a serial killer. Me of all people, can you imagine that?”
I turn around to catch John's glance and share my enthusiasm with him, but his face is still unreadable.
Waiting is not good of course. Leaves him with more than enough time at hand to ponder how he could have missed the poisoned letters. (By being an arrogant sod, obviously, who thinks he is invulnerable and hence does not check their flat for death traps often enough. Even though he might have attracted the attention of three potentially lethal enemies only last month.)
Underneath my forehead I can feel his belly softening again. His hands, now done treating my finger, find their way into my hair. (He loves that.) “I've missed you too,” he says softly. “You know that, don't you?” I nod. Close my eyes when one of his hands move down my neck to stay on my back, slowly rubbing it. Finally let go of the breath I must have been holding for three weeks now.
More fascinating, though, was the expression it created on Sherlock's face. It was a faraway look, with a smile that made his eyes wrinkle a little. He seemed to lazily observe the surrounding, probably comparing them to those from his childhood memories, and made eye contact with John every other minute, his smile broadening every time he saw that John smiled back.
The rest of this night is a blur of noises and shadows and wind and tears and adrenaline and sickness and loss. When my world comes back into focus again, I am sitting in a holding cell, completely alone.
Then Sherlock theorises the problem to find out what is wrong. He hides in his mind palace and attempts to find a solution there. But that turns out to be a tricky thing, for he usually sees a mind version of John when dealing with emotional stuff.
John regarded him curiously. “What kind of simulation?” he asked. The painful expression on Sherlock's face stirred something inside him.
For a moment, he allowed himself to watch Sherlock sleep. He looked peaceful, even with the deep circles underneath his eyes, and very very fragile. John knew that it was normal for coma patients to lose body mass. Yet, the memory of holding Sherlock's thin body a moment ago bothered him deeply. There was not much left to hold, really.
- and wakes up with a violent jolt. The night nurse is leaning over him, holding his head. “Do you hear me, Sherlock?” she asks insistently.
He avoids meeting Greg, for example. He cannot stand their meaningless chatter, cannot stand the idea of him and Molly being together. He cannot stand to see the living proof that Molly has moved on. So he rejects his invitations again and again, until Greg starts to worry and he calls John more often to check if he is all right and calls Harry, to tell her that he is concerned.
Then he decides to clutch those painful memories, for they give him the drive he needs to challenge Moriarty's network.
He is glorious that night. We both are. I place the “surgery shot” lie in Mary's head. John puts all the hatred he felt when reading her file into his performance and pretends not to be scared to death by how sick I really am. At Baker Street we are so convincing that Mary hands us a flash drive, presumably filled with information on her. And all the time I manage to keep the distance from John as if scared off by his emotions.
John is still smirking when I return, now dressed. (Love how the purple shirt still makes his pupils dilate.) The little laughter lines around his eyes make my heart lose about two pounds of weight, and before long I am finally deeply concentrating on the Enigma.
Finally I find the strength (and courage) to look into his eyes. Should feel awkward but doesn't (because it's John). He smiles at me, sweetly and lovingly (as if he had not pushed me into a short painful brain- numbing orgasm just now). Caresses my curls, presses innocent kisses on my face. My head lolls forward to rest against his belly once more. ( Right where it was when we started. Full circle.) I bury my face and love him for a while.
It is easy to deduce that my parents as well as Mrs Hudson have informed him of my plans to leave England. Still, I wish I could bring myself to text him (at least). I use the next break at a Belgian filling station to stare at my mobile for fifteen minutes before I have to admit that I won't be able to write that text.
When the doors of the tram opened, Sherlock dashed out at once, John close to his trail. They pushed through a crowd of tourists, businesspeople and thieves, making it from Piazza Barberini to the Pantheon in merely ten minutes.
About half an hour later Sherlock suddenly leapt out of his frozen state and jumped down the five steps. “Come on, Otis!” he yelled, smirking, and John was barely able to follow in time. In front of the entrance a police car had parked, and an important looking man had got out of it. It must be their contact, John thought, thinking he was waiting for two journalists who wanted to see the crime scene before all evidence would be destroyed and the Pantheon opened for the public again the next day.
In the end, Sherlock was the first to look away. “Fine, fine,I will sleep!” he declared theatrically and pointedly closed his eyes.
“Family business,” she says, and when I fail to show an appropriate reaction she explains, “My father left my brother his Blue Book. It's a collection of business contacts, some of his strategies explained, dirty secrets of our rivals, that kind of stuff.” She pulls a face, and Molly looks at her in silent understanding. (Her family wanted her to become a primary school teacher, like all women in the family). “When my brother died, it was handed over to me, just like my father wished. Not that I want to have it. Thank you, Dad.” She crinkles her nose.
John. Been with me when the paramedics arrived, my memory supplies. Still with me inside the ambulance. Was concerned. Pretended not to be scared. Surely waited for the operation to be over.
I don't know what to do, so I wait. Try to ignore the increasing fear for his life. Finally, he clears his throat and says, very quietly, “I love this child, Sherlock.” His eyes shine with a sadness that (for a reason I cannot understand) makes my chest hurt. “I mean, it is only as big as a walnut now, but … it is my child. I can't stand the thought of being with her any longer, but … “
Again, I don't know what to say. Somehow I must have missed the fact that today it the international “Embarrass Sherlock Holmes” day.
I wish he would let me join him, or come along when I take Emmi for a stormy walk in the rain-protected push-chair but he insists on being alone. Most of the time I manage to be reasonable about it. Not always but most of the time.
Without a word he pulls my head close and kisses me, fiercely and demanding and feral and consuming and hot. Somehow I manage to pull us up without breaking the kiss, and we stumble into the warm kitchen again, sinking down onto the floor, still kissing, still re-conquering what once belonged to us.
(The waiting room was redecorated four weeks ago. Wilko Matt Emulsion Soft Cream. Blood stains on the wall not completely covered. Caused by self-inflicted wound on a left-handers right wrist with a knife that could have been sharper.)
There is no time to pick up our jackets. A reasonable loss. I steer him outside where he finally draws back a little.
John spends some time with us, then prepares food. We eat in front of the TV. (Bad habit, that, but the only way to make Rosie be something similar to quiet for a little while.) She can choose, so we watch that little girl travelling to a fantasy world through her closet to help a nice dinosaur, and then we are forced to endure that American puppet singing about the dragon with bad breath.
“Don't,” Sherlock snapped, seemingly knowing exactly what John was thinking. “Don't let your Samaritan instinct interfere with my recovery.”
He breathes out again. The sound his lungs make hurt me. His body is trembling so badly now that his teeth must be chattering. His head is growing heavier on my arm. I am still rocking him, babbling, “I love you, I love you.”
When he looks up at me, his face turns softer instantly, but there is something dangerous still lurking just one blink of an eye away. “Her being a professional assassin would be bad enough,” he states calmly (never is he more frightened than when he appears to be calm). “She has done things, Sherlock ...” He stops mid-sentence, his breath betraying his state of mind.
“This is where we found you that summer when Mummy and I were done being idiots,” Daddy muses. “I always thought it was your favourite place around the house.”
After another moment, Sherlock broke the kiss and let himself slump against John's body. “John,” he whispered, sounding astonished and pleased.
I use the small divergence to post the drafts on the blog and send John a link. Only seconds later I hear a pling on his mobile, and watch him opening the link. His face is unreadable (damn!) but he sits down, focused on the screen and for a few minutes he goes very very still.
No hurt done to my body because I (gracelessly) land on my butt. But there is hurt done - to John. He stares at me unbelievingly. Then I can see more self-hatred rolling over his face in heavy waves.
“He stole an ashtray for me, once,” he told Moran when he felt that enough time had passed. “At Buckingham Palace. Only to make me laugh.” And the most wonderful thing was that it wasn't a lie at all. He looked at his captor once more. Now it was about time ... He let a little fond smile spread across his face. It was genuine, no need to pretend here.
When he is done, he gets up to change the settings of the shower and rinses the shower gel and the shampoo off my body with clinical precision. Then he gets out of the shower cabin, helps me up and towels me thoroughly, head to toe. Then he wraps me up in the softest bath robe he can find.
Very soon he realises that we are not going to his holiday home but mine. He doesn't mention it but his body tenses for a while. Then he seems to lose his last bit of strength. He stumbles, eyes nearly closed now, and I carry him more than I support him. The way home seems endless.
There are only two people in the world that know about Sherlock's feelings for John. Neither of them is John.
Been informed that none of them made appropriate Christmas films. So, unfortunately, John was forced to snog me the entire time in order to prevent himself from watching them. I think they made wonderful Christmas films.
I close my eyes and my ears take over. It is loud inside the plane now, you can hear the air rushing by outside, and people screaming and screaming, and I am not sure if John says “I love you” or not. There is nothing I can to except hiding my head between my knees and hope for the best.
I watch him unchain John. Watch John limply drop down. Watch Big Boy catch him and lower him to the ground. Watch him chaining John to the wall again but so loosely that he can remain lying but will be able to sit up later.
When they leave, Mary hugs me and cries because, as she states rather clearly, “we will most likely never meet again.” My fragile hope shatters instantly. I catch John's glance over her shoulder. It hurt him just as badly as it hurt me. She is really evil with those little things.
The monotonous life of solitary confinement goes on like that for a while. Breakfast, bricks, lunch, weather, workout, shower, visitor, emptiness, sleep. Nightmares. I still don't speak that much. John comes every third day, Mycroft is there in between. We all don't know when this routine will be over, and what will happen then.
I have to open my eyes for a second, concentrate on not panicking. I am sure he sees it, for he starts talking to me instantly. “God, you are so beautiful,” he murmurs, and goes on babbling so I can focus on his voice.
And the timing would have been the cruellest twist of fate. For it has been only yesterday that they had almost kissed. They have been disturbed by Rosie but it had not mattered much to Sherlock for he had finally understood that John was really in love with him too and they had the rest of their life to explore that and one day more or less didn't really count.
He has turned away from me and is showing me only his back in the pale moonlight. His breath is irregular. He is trying to control it, to hide something from me, just in case I wake up.
At the entrance of the hospital, a wave of memories makes me dizzy. Not just memories, I realize, also memories of all the fears I had yesterday. But John is not dead, or dying. He is fine, and we will leave this place together this morning. My wrist starts throbbing when I cross the entrance hall, as if to remind me of yesterday's abnormality. I ignore it. People with casts are nothing abnormal at a hospital.
I only stop because Mrs Hudson comes in. My anger is burned away, and my legs buckle, and suddenly I am crying in her arms, and she is soothing me, and I cry out my pain at losing John and losing Emmi and losing the violin Mycroft gave me after rehab and losing Mycroft and losing my voice.
A time of politeness (Sherlock never considered giggling at crime scenes impolite before, but then he barely ever giggled pre-John at all) and a time of simplicity (how could Sherlock have known that sitting in the living room together, without talking, just reading or researching or writing their blogs or watching telly could be perfection?).
And we are both unhurt. But the bullet hit flesh and bones, judging from the terrible sound right after the gun shot. I look back at her and see her sinking to the ground. His glance follows mine. She is dead already, judging from the spray pattern of blood and brain mass on the bookshelf. But her body convulses, and being the best and wisest and kindest man he is, he takes her into his arms and speaks softly to her until her body finally stills.
He turned around. Mycroft got up and covered the distance between them with a swift move. “I am sorry!” he said, and there was nothing but sincerity and regret in his voice.
The John he sees now is unhelpful and cold, and the room Sherlock has dedicated to him looks tumbledown and dark. There are 92 different kind of tobacco ashes scattered on the ground for some reason, and the walls are pasted with printouts of comments from Twitter and tumblr, all saying “Think!” or “It's you!”. The soft violin music that usually plays John's favourite pieces is replaced by a cacophony of trumpets, trombones and timpani.
Sherlock considers taking one of John's jumpers with him once the time comes. Or a pair of his red pants.
But obviously, we are in need of a long-term solution to be truthful. I also have many talents that I could praise  for hours (which I do occasionally) (well quite often, to be true), but dealing with romance is not amongst them. So I decide to use the only scheme I am familiar with. The promise of love, the pain of loss, the joy of redemption.
“This is not your fault” he says groggily. Then he closes his eyes again and almost instantly his body shuts down. A few unsteady breaths and then I can hear that he has fallen asleep.
The news tells me that it will still take days to find out why the plane fell from the sky the way it did, and all of a sudden I do not want to think about it any longer. I want to sleep, and then I want to wake up again, and then I want to go to the hospital and take John home, and then I want to pick up Rosie from the Stamfords, and then I just want to be at home with them.
(Remember my surprise during my first John-made orgasm. Finally understood why people are doing that all the time.)
Two of them are already emulating his elegant movements, others are eyeing him from the far. Orks on the other hand seem to be completely unimpressed by Sherlock's extravagance. Probably because Sherlock is so much like an elf himself, John muses, thinking of his esthetic features, his unearthly skin, his beautiful eyes.
"Don't." Daddy tells me quietly. "I have told him where to find us if he wants to. But he needs to take that step on his own."
So John sat down and wondered about what to do once Sherlock reappeared from his mind palace. What was he thinking about John's feelings anyway? Was he flattered? Surely. It was not like Sherlock to miss an opportunity to be flattered.
John is making that sound again, for the third time now. Sherlock feels his own strength draining. There is darkness lingering at his peripheral vision. He looks at John, silently telling him that it is all right to give in now, even though it is breaking his heart.
Yes, of course. I wouldn't be of any help in my current state, still too weak to stand on my own. So before leaving without me, John makes sure that I'm leaning against the wall so I won't collapse.
“Sir,” one of the prison guards says, “we will bring your wife to her room in the internist’s ward now. There she will be officially imprisoned. If you want to talk to her before, you need to see her now.”
I know that getting off the ferry was John's giant leap back to life but it hurts to watch how slowly he progresses from here.
But Sherlock never comments on it. And it should be impossible for him not to deduce John's feelings, not to read him like an open book. So, all-in-all it is sad but clear that Sherlock knows, but does not share John's feelings. Right?
Three minutes later I am standing at the harbour. (Have decided against taking Emmi. John has been in a gruesome state of mind when Daddy was with him and it is highly unlikely that he is completely fine now, only twenty days later.)
It had been impossible to fall asleep next to John. The second I close my eyes, I am back on the plane, feeling gravity pulling me down. I can even hear the sound of wind rushing by outside the cabin. The absence of the noise the engines were supposed to make.
She was babbling sleepily, probably telling John's jumper all about her day. A warm feeling spread inside of John. Who would have thought that he would love being a father?
“Being slightly uncomfortable was important for you. Probably to keep your senses alert. Maybe just to prevent yourself from relaxing too much when the world as we know it had to be ruled.”
Before I can respond accordingly, she informs me, “We are done talking. I'll hang up now!” She blows me a kiss and the line is broken.
Wonder if I should be ashamed of the fact that this arouses me further. No time to contemplate. For inner John (when did he get naked?) is still completely in charge. “Down” he commands, and pushes me onto the bed before I can obey.
“If you compliment me for being able to eat yogurt, I'll deduce something really embarrassing about you the next time Mycroft is around,”Sherlock threatened.
That might have been a mistake, for now I can see the whole of the crash site. The nose of the plane is lying on its back, several yards away from the cabin. The tail of the plane is driven into the ground almost vertically. The cabin is compressed, its hull torn in several places. There is debris lying around, as well as body parts.
Who still holds the misguided hope that I will not die within the next six months. So I try to make it crystal clear one last time, “Sherlock is actually a girl's name.” Meaning: “I will die. Please forgive me for leaving you.”
I want to object, want to tell him that it is not necessary yet, that I will just stay a little bit longer by his side before giving in but there is something in his eyes that silences me. I look away – and suddenly I see my own reflection in the window.
“Why would I do that?” I challenge him, pretending not to notice that he is doing me a favour. He offers me the chance to get away from the flat by seeing Elisabeth J. Farnsworth, one of the suspects Janine had mentioned. We banter for a while until Mary (who, unlike John, understands that it is just make-believe) explodes.
The second day is nearly identical. I have breakfast. Calculate the bricks in the wall and delete the result. Have lunch. Forecast the weather. Do my workout. Take a shower. Surprisingly, Mycroft shows up again. He brings along a Stratego game. We play eight matches. I lose every single time. He leaves. I have dinner. Go to bed. Lie awake until a restless sleep overpowers me. I don't speak a single word, not even in my nightmare.
“Well,” John started, but was cut off immediately. “Two similar cases during the last four weeks, one in Lombardy, one in Tuscany.” Sherlock didn't stop pacing to throw another collection of newspaper articles onto the table. “First incident, Bergamo, 25th of March, 13:47, Banca di Marche. Four robbers, 21 hostages, a ludicrous amount of money. Of all banks at Bergamo, this one is the most complicated to break into, and also the one with the lowest amount of cash available. Twenty hostages survived, one got killed by a clean shot in the head. Accidentally? Unlikely.”
Sherlock's arms give in, and he collapses to the ground. His eyes are still fixed on John who does not look away either. He watches John trying to speak, his mouth moving, not a single sound coming out of it. Seeing that hurts more than the hundreds of metal splinters that are slowly killing Sherlock.
Mycroft nodded but made no attempt to rise as well. John decided not to dwell on it and picked up his jacket. When he was almost out of the door, Mycroft's voice stopped him.
We have been waiting for something to happen for so long that I have to laugh in relief while going down.
“Diabetis melius,” John says. “encephalitis, concussion, hepatitis.” “Brain tumour,” Sherlock says earnestly, and John feels like a weight is sitting on his breast, slowly crushing him. “No” he answers determined and refuses even to think of that.
When we reach the hotel our kissing gets so intense again that a shocked business man lets us have the lift for ourselves.
John frowned. “It's still 2014,” he told Sherlock, still making sure he sounded absolutely soothing. “You have been in an induced coma for fifteen days and needed another three to fully wake up from it.” When the darkness on Sherlock's face only deepened, he asked, “What year did you think it was?”
Big Boy is with her, carrying a tray in his hands and a folding table under his arm. For a second I am scared that there are torture devises on the tray but it turns out that they only brought food and gauze. Meaning: She intends to keep us here for quite a while and cares enough for John to treat his wounds.
I cannot help thinking how much we have in common, and wonder how our relationship would have developed had she not turned out to be what she is.
Sherlock seemed to be at a loss of words, too, and after a while, John felt like he needed to say something or they would continue staring at each other for the next two hours or so.
“The texts became more and more personal, including stuff only he could have written.” (A bit less boring, but still easy to fake. Too often people overestimate the discreetness of family members.) “Then I received letters, written in his handwriting.” (A bit more elaborate, but still too easy to fake to be truly interesting.)
Only when he is gone again do I realise that I have not spoken a single word since asking for permission to visit the library. “Bit not good, that” my inner John says again. I can only agree with him. Silently.
Sherlock had woken up from his stomach revolting at the sight of it. Then it had dawned to him that should he really need to vomit, he would not be able to get to the restroom on his own because he could not even sit up without help.
Concentrating on Farnsworth is difficult. Especially after I deduced that she is innocent. Took me eight minutes. But she keeps on talking. Tells me something about honour among thieves and really believes in it. When she asks me if she is boring me, I say yes.
We continue talking about it for another while, but no matter how lovingly I pet his head, he does not change his mind. It becomes clear that I will have to alter my plan. I will take Magnussen down, no doubt about that. I just won't tell John that he is in it with me more than five minutes in advance.
Thinking of the nightmares makes John feel guilty, for they have clearly started around the same time John had started asking himself if he can really live with a lover who constantly risks his life carelessly without thinking.
But no matter how much I try, I cannot believe in that. Instead all I can do is grieve for Emmi and my parents and Mycroft and Harry.
I beg to disagree. (Memories of velocity and screams.) For some reason, I remain silent, so he goes on, “Once the black boxes are found intact, most of the thrill is gone.” (People dying, people dead.)
Sherlock feels the tears running down his cheeks. He opens his own mouth, tries to say something, to soothe John, or to stop him from dying, or to yell at him, but he cannot make the slightest sound. He tries to stretch out his arm, to reach for John, to gently stroke him, or to shake him, or to grab him to prevent him from slipping into death but he cannot move.
At first he commands himself to remain calm, knowing that Sherlock is only a few metres away and will surely come to the rescue soon. But then his lungs start to burn and there is a shrill beeping in his ears, and he watches his hand losing its grip on his opponent and his vision dims, and for a few excruciating seconds he panics, feeling utterly helpless, wondering if he is dying now.
it hurts and hurts and goes on and on and my legs cramp and my arms and my neck and it hurts and hurts and my head hits the floor three times four five but I will not scream I will not scream -
“We'll need coffee and something light to eat,” I tell my parents. Daddy starts preparing something for us instantly while Mummy looks quizzically at Emmi who is sitting on her lap.
“He never even considered how it would affect you if you believed that he had jumped to his death in front of your eyes.” Don't let it show, don't let it show, John frantically thought. He was so close to giggling hysterically with delight that for a moment he was scared that he would get himself killed after all. He somehow managed to keep up his scared and nearly broken expression. Moran had no idea Sherlock had told him about the whole suicide plan before carrying it out.
Back home I tell Mycroft to arrange a meeting with the next suspect as soon as possible and then I hush Team Sherlock out of 221b. Then I wait for news from the hospital.
The overwhelming guilt had surprised him so much that in a feeble attempt to ease John's pain at least a little he had persuaded the other countries' spokesmen to let Britain win a lot more medals at the Olympics than he had originally intended. That meant no Nobel prizes for Great Britain in return for quite a while, but then John had never been too interested in them, so be it.
Who do I need to call first? Did Mummy and Daddy know we were on that flight at all? Mycroft has surely got detailed information on us from the hospital already, and he surely knows the colour of the carpet of my hotel room. Would he inform anybody that we were fine? Well, he would surely tell Mrs Hudson, for he is always secretly scared of her wrath coming over him again.
He looks at me for another while, then, without a further comment, he leans forward and takes me in his arms. Carefully, without hurting my already wounded chest. It is an awkward embrace. John has to keep up the tension in his spine in order not to lean against my wound, I on the other hand cannot lean forward without hurting myself.
She and Sherlock regarded each other for a moment, then Sherlock broke eye contact. “Unfortunately so,” he whispered.
“Exactly. Only that he lacked your ... goodness. He adored me up to a point where he would have done anything for me. He even went out to get me cocaine if needed, took it with me against his conviction so we would have something more in common.” Sherlock turned his back on John, looking out of the huge window, his slim frame picturesquely surrounded by the silhouette of the Eternal City.
Yasmin does not seem to realize my abashment. Instead she goes on, “And he is stuck with this mean bitch, instead of being free for you.” She also misses the meaningful look Janine gives me over the rim of her tea cup. “Oh, dear, you would make such a lovely couple. It's really a shame that he married that cunt. Especially now that she's ...”
When the door opened, he was ready to yell at anybody who would dare to talk to him. But instead of a nurse John entered the room, looking glad and apologetic and questioning at the same time, the way only John could, and Sherlock's anger melted into something softer he could not define.
I suspect a letter from John but find a certificate. Signed by John, endorsed by Mycroft, only three days before his death. Why have I never seen it before?
Serves me right, John thought when he subtly struggled for balance after being pulled into the fierce hug. You can't surprise two Holmes' a day without being surprised at least once in return. When he realised that Sherlock would not let him go any time soon, he gracefully settled into the hug and started rubbing his friend's back a little. Damn, he DID miss him.
“I won't,” I promise him, “I won't leave you again. Never. Please believe me. From now on I will be careful and stay out of harm's way and never do something stupid without talking to you about it first and ...”
The cab took its time to reach Baker Street, the traffic being rather heavy (what time was it, anyway?), and John kept thinking about eyes and blood and curls. Not the peaceful, easy version from the morgue, the cruel one from the pavement. Again and again, it went around inside his head. When he realized that this image no longer hurt him that much because he had gone numb inside, he thought about the note. About Sherlock crying, about himself, obviously unable to stop the inevitable. About an outstretched hand from the roof. Sherlock crying.
John agrees to coming along over the weekend, not with a heartfelt “Hell, yes!”, but at least nearly without hesitation and without discussing it with Mary before agreeing. Sherlock's stomach does a funny little stunt. Might there still be hope?
Oh God. I should be scared, I think, or sorry or devastated. But all I can feel is immense relief. Not sure but I am probably smiling when I nod in return. I look at him one last time.
But John is a genius when it comes to them being a couple and his obviously telepathic abilities are stunning. His laboured smile becomes a real one and he pats Sherlock's chest, “Next time you want me to be occupied, you could just sprain an ankle or catch laryngitis, couldn't you?”
But he has put lots of thought into buying it. It must mean something. How do you ask about it without being rude?
“You really should talk to this horrible woman at the supermarket,” Mummy fusses one day when she comes home from shopping. “She is always so impolite. If something bad happens to her because you talked, it won't be a great loss.”
“John has asked permission to visit you,” he tells me while watching me carefully. Only one visitor every second day, I recall. “I could arrange for him to come here tomorrow,” Mycroft goes on, still scanning my expression carefully. And expose me to John's anger and (How does he feel about having watched me turning from a dragon slayer into a murderer? How does he feel about me leaving him again as a direct result of that?) disappointment? Rather not, thank you.
“I was thinking about Emilia for girl and Anthony for a boy,” I let him know after the long long long embrace. (Have given that a lot of thought, carefully avoiding every living relative of him and of me. Of course his belief in the Watson Curse is pitifully weird, but important to him, nevertheless.)
Mary seems to sense his trouble. She moves closer to him at night, rests her head on his ribcage, starts to caress him. Her hands wander deeper, and she starts to rub him, waiting for him to get randy. He does, or at least his body obviously does. John himself feels rotten for making her believe that she fulfils him.
They do normal stuff like watching movies. Her favourites are “Dial M for murder” and a German film called “M-Eine Stadt sucht einen Mörder”. But as she knows about the cases, she never asks John to watch a crime thriller with her.
Another blurred figure touches me, probably trying to help me. I cannot talk to him, somehow, only push him aside to pass him by. He says something but I ignore him. Need to find John!
Mycroft took his time to arrive, probably busy helping to get Sherlock out of the country one way or the other. When he finally showed up, all serious and subtly grieving, John had been awake for nearly 48 hours, not counting the little naps he had taken at the laboratory, and he really didn't need brilliant acting skills to appear broken. He was still wearing the same clothes he had on when Sherlock had jumped, still neither shoes nor socks, hadn't washed or shaved, had done nothing other than sitting in his chair, staring at the carpet.
Is he doing it on purpose? Better not move my own hand. If he's doing it subconsciously, he might remove it. (Not desirable.) (A stolen moment. Intend to keep it as long as possible.) I hold my hand absolutely still. But my mind starts working again. I remember. John Watson is in danger.
I have to wait a whole day before I receive an email from him. Access to online archives worldwide. Not all of them legal.
I open my eyes and find him tied to a chair. Fully clothed. Unhurt (thank God). Tired, angry. Slightly scared, most likely on my behalf. Still relatively fresh shaven. So I have not been out cold for more than three days. If John's beard growth were stronger, I could tell more precisely.
It goes on for a while, a lot longer than necessary. Then, finally, he stops and clears his throat. “I need to clean you completely,” he explains. “All of you. I mean ...”   I know what he means. So I silently watch him taking some of the foam from my head and putting it onto my cock. He cleans me from my glans to my penile root and then cleans my balls too.
It is too dark to see his face but I feel him shaking his head. I also feel his tears running down my  cheek. “Sherlock, I am sorry,” he moans, “I am so sorry.”
Sherlock took a second to mentally kick himself in the backside. He should have heard her entering the flat. He should have been more alert. Should have locked the door.
With surprising swiftness, Mycroft suddenly stands between her and that coat (and the weapon hidden inside). Grabs her by her arms (probably a bit harder than necessary), and lets his most annoying smug voice rain over her, “Amber Garrison, I am arresting you for illegal immigration, use of forged papers, burglary and attempted murder on at least one occasion, among other crimes. You will be arrested until the government has decided whether to punish you for your crimes against the crown, or to deliver you to one of the countries looking for you.”
"I ... concur." I hear myself say. (Oh no. Worst possible choice.) My cheeks flush. I wait for the ground to swallow me. Must be any second now.
Sherlock looked at John again, no imaginary blood on his face this time, and their eyes met. “I am too scared to kiss you,” Sherlock blurted out.
It took me two hours to find out that there is a Christmas tree underneath the heap of decorations next to the fireplace. Judging from the overall looks of the flat, I am forced to live inside a Lewis Carroll novel now.
“Back home again, still alive.” he typed, and then added, “Plan working so far. Be careful!” Then he picked one special contact from the list, the only one actually connected to an existing mobile number, but covering its owner with the fake name of Mary Morstan.
Sherlock instantly visualized it in the model of his body he had in his mind palace. The nerve was thin, the chance of it getting hit not very high. He knew his way around anatomy but somehow the implications of that injury refused to come to his mind. He sighed, both inside his mind palace and in real life.
Angelo beams at them when he pours the wine into their glasses and Sherlock almost gets lost at how soft John's face looks in the candlelight. Should he tell him right now? No, better have dinner first. Or at least some wine.
