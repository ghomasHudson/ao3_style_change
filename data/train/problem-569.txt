He pulled the silk aside like wrapping paper. As he slid down Sherlock's body he was enveloped by the man's heat and scent, a pheremone heavy mix of soap and sweat and Sherlock. He settled on his knees between Sherlock's thighs.
I can’t tell you how hard it is to bring all this dirt for the potatoes into the Hab. I need to get it through the airlock, which takes AGES and I need to do it in stages, so the soil can become fertile. I can’t just dump it all in there. I have to be careful with my shoulder and my whole body is aching.
I have plenty of oxygen, but no hydrogen. But I can use the rocket fuel from the MDV! Bill landed the thing so well (thanks, mate!), we have a bunch of fuel left: litres and litres of hydrazine. Each molecule has 4 hydrogen atoms, so every liter of fuel makes 2 litres of water!
Then Sherlock starts inching forward, very very slowly. His hand trembles a little when he places it on John’s arm. John’s breath rushes into his lungs, Sherlock’s fingers burning through his shirt. Still moving carefully, Sherlock presses first his nose, and then his lips against John’s cheek. John realises he’s mimicking his own movements, but so softly, as if he wants to savour the experience, and perhaps make notes after.
, a bunch of ladies on a hens’ night where the bride to be was already too drunk to sit on a stool without support, a reunion of old college friends who were trying to bring back the old times and failing spectacularly, and a lot of single men looking for a one night stand. He hoped the music would start soon, for all their sakes.
After nearly two hours of studying, Sherlock gets up from the desk and lets himself fall on John’s bed. “Enough! That’s as much tutoring I can handle today.” John looks at his friend, spread out on his bed, his shirt rucked up and showing a strip of pale skin above his waistband, and stands up suddenly. “I’ll make us some tea, yeah?” He asks, no longer looking at Sherlock and fleeing his own room without waiting for a reply.
I’m going to give it my all, but if that isn’t enough, there is plenty of morphine in the medical area for a lethal dose.
We could use the images to get more funding. Congress funded us for five missions, but since Ares III was a failure, and most of the supplies are still up there, we could get a sixth mission out of this! It would only cost a fraction of a regular mission, and if we make the recovering of John Watson’s body one of the goals, we will definately get support. Of course, we should pitch the idea now that the world still feels sympathy for John Watson’s family. You know the media will have forgotten about this in a year.
‘No you're right. I'm an occasional locum who lives in a bedsit. I can't write about patients because of confidentiality and I've got bugger all else going on. Are you cold?’
'I'd like us to bond, doesn't need to be this heat or the one after but...' Sherlock let his head fall, drawing lines with nose and lips over the scent gland. It should be all the answer John needed but he still wanted to hear it. He needed to know Sherlock
‘John-stop.’ He had reached out and grabbed John’s wrist as he passed. ‘I’m not some sort of hero John, I need you to understand that-or-you’ll just be disappointed.’ He’d made the physical contact without thinking, just a way to make his point but now John’s skin was warm and his pulse strong. He felt John resist slightly then relax, sigh, turn in the grip.
‘That makes sense. The officer showed Sally a plan. ‘Covering the door.’ The armed officers beckoned Sally away and there were various murmurings between them that Sherlock couldn't hear.
'Yeah, so I found one when and where I wasn't really looking and...can I just show you?' Raz gestured between his tablet and the sofa where Sherlock sat. Sherlock nodded impatiently. The alpha wasn't remotely attractive to him, not really but sitting so close, after a basically unresolved heat, there was a certain pull.
'I'm being watched-we are being watched.' He gestured at the bed. John looked intently and he felt a pang, a mix of anger and sadness when the alpha picked up the picture from the clinic.
'Yes, I'll get a menu. As Sherlock hobbled off John stretched, his eyes resting on what was hanging on the outside of the wardrobe.
The man turned for some reason, caught Sherlock's intention in his eye. He shoved a group of elderly tourists aside as he made a dash for the escalator. Sherlock was after him but whether it was the stiffness or his large breakfast his legs were sluggish. He stumbled and half landed awkwardly on his forearm before righting himself. Just as he saw the man reach the bottom of the escalator another figure at the edge of his sight line caught his attention.
John broke away and Sherlock caressed the back of his head as he worked his mouth over the sweet spot on Sherlock's neck before moving lower to tease a nipple through the expensive fabric. Sherlock's hand now ran wantonly up John's inner thigh and, rather roughly, slid open-palmed over his growing erection.
John sighed and gasped, hands running over Sherlock's ribs and hips as his mouth worked steadily. Occasionally allowing himself a stroke to his own cock.
‘You mean hopelessly romantic.’ John said with a smile. Sherlock shrugged, as if they were the same thing.
‘I’ve missed something haven’t I?’ John said, feeling utterly silly half dressed with a hard on as he was.
'As I say sedation is the main treatment, and keeping him as comfortable as possible in isolation. There are hormonal therapies that we can try if it lasts abnormally long but there are side effects. He's on IV fluids. Omegas in his condition they...struggle to care for themselves. He's in a lot of discomfort.'
Oh yes.He’s my brother. Two orphans. We had no choice. We could work for the Black Lotus, or starve on the streets like beggars. My brother, he never forgave himself, for this.' She gestured at the bond bite.
'That's what I need to talk to Lestrade about. His cold case. The victim is his grandfather.' Sherlock looked suddenly serious.
Sherlock could see it was days since Dr Murphy had been the right side of a proper meal or more than five hours sleep. He was a beta. Alphas and omegas ,even with the benefit of a medical education, were exotic, alien, feral even.
When he found Matt, just to talk he told himself, it happened again. A quick pheremone driven encounter in the corner of a dark storage unit.
As Sherlock caressed the skin he thought it did seem slightly rounder than usual - though he knew it was fanciful this early in the heat. He slid his fingers round the imagined curve wondering, again, how this would feel with a pup growing inside.
He'd known there was something off about the alpha. Too loud, too affectionate, trying too hard. He'd organised this one too late , the work taking precedence. His investigations had been less thorough than usual. A mistake he wouldn't make again.
‘Just before you go, which one would you have picked?’ The cabbie said casually and Sherlock stopped. He knew he should walk out, call Lestrade but he stopped.
'Christ Sherlock.' Lestrade said backing away. Hand over his nose, confirming Sherlock's worst suspicions.
They sat down at the table and John told him about Harry. He'd known before of course, John's drunk sibling who gifted him his phone had been one of the alpha's first deductions about his flatmate. Beyond that though John didn't mention her much.
'Remote possibility I know but what if I happen to know them?' John asked, following Sherlock who was heading out of the room towards the lift.
'I'm sure it would. Or perhaps...' Sherlock reached across and slid his fingers between John's thighs and under his balls, behind his perineum. John's face lit up in a grin.
Sherlock slid his hands over John's hips, kissing along his spine, before pressing his heavy erection slowly inside. John was tight but almost pulling him in, immediately tensing and moaning as he came again. Just from Sherlock filling him. Sherlock couldn't help feeling a little pleased with himself.
Sherlock squared his shoulders as he haughtily walked straight past the maitre d into the dimly lit restaurant. John trailing behind, his fresh, familiar scent grounding in the alpha heavy fug. Sherlock’s heat was closing in on him fast and he knew his presence here would be doubly offensive for that reason.
‘Yes. You're above average size for an alpha and I'm much more aware of your size, girth in particular in this position. It's-
'I can, if that's what you want I thought...' The omega sat up abruptly. 'Things are different out here.'
'It probably is time for you to go. I'll call you a cab.' The detective stood and John became aware that he was standing too, a few scant feet from his flatmate.
'No, you're clean. In the military sexual health checks were routine. Like the tidiness and the fitness its a habit you've kept on, especially given your more recent experiences.'
'It's fine, I wasn't about to attack him. I just - I'd forgotten what this was like, with both of you here.' Sherlock gazed blankly at the floor.
‘Hang on we’ve…’ John was about to say we’ve only just met till he remembered. This was transactional, he wasn’t on a date, wasn’t going to wake up next to this man tomorrow . ‘Yeah, why not?’ John casually sipped his wine as if he did this all the time.
He caught Sherlock's scent before he saw him, his senses heightening in the build up to his heat, and as the alpha sat John leaned in.
‘Of course, child's play.’ It wasn't though. During the cab ride, their bizarre chat, he'd been going through things in his head. The cabbie’s background, the origin of the glass of the bottles, the colour of the granules in the seemingly identical capsules. He was seventy percent sure but no more than.
' Good chance that's how he fell. At the moment we're more worried about the way it can inhibit healing. He needs to come off it to let his ankle heal – hence the rehab.'
. As he spoke to John, he realised that he would have gladly spent time in his company anyway. It was unnerving.
Outside the museum Raz, his grafitti artist contact caught up with them. He was a young alpha and Sherlock watched John watching him. He'd not used Raz that way. Even if he hadn't met him after he decided he preferred his heats to be an anonymous transaction Raz would never have agreed. His artistic temperament made him a romantic, in spite of his edgy medium.
Under the heavy drag of sedation everything fragmented. He felt occasional dry cool fingers and was aware of an IV line going into his hand. He still felt every pang of longing, every ache but it was experienced as if through a viscous liquid. There was an odd lack of urgency as he sobbed pathetically, humiliated, as he called out for the alpha he'd been separated from.
The alpha showed them Soo Lin's fragile ancient teapots, obviously in love with what he couldn't have.
The omega insisted on making breakfast while Sherlock went for a quick bath. The detective shyly wrapping a dressing gown around himself as he got up-much to John's amusement.
John nodded. He remembered it well, Sherlock's services hadn't been needed but it had been in all the papers for days.
‘Seen a lot of injuries, then; violent deaths.Bit of trouble too, I bet.’ Sherlock continued, shrugging into his coat.
'Now, ask me about the case.' Sherlock said, shuffling himself up the bed. They neatly avoided any further mention of heat or related subjects for the next ten minutes. Sherlock describing the murder in great detail, obviously unimpressed by the whole business. John, happy the awkwardness seemed to have gone, flicked through one of the journals he had brought, looking for a relevant bit on fall injuries he had read. When he looked up the detective had dosed off, his mouth slightly open, his face softened by sleep. John instinctively adjusted his pillows and blankets as best he could without waking him.
A fresh wave of potent scent filled the room as John positioned himself, vulnerable. Sherlock's shaky fingers brushed across his swollen, wet flesh before slipping two of them inside , meeting no resistance. He gasped, the sensation was so different to anything he'd felt before before, warmer, slicker. The omega wriggled against him.
We will dedicate ourselves every single day to assist the remaining Ares III crew on their journey back to Earth.
Sorry for taking so long, peeps! First life happened, and then season 4, and it was very difficult to even THINK about John and Sherlock for a while...anyway, I hope you enjoy it and come say hi on tumblr if you do! Your comments are what make me want to write!
Let me tell you: it’s not fun to crawl through the Martian desert with an antenna sticking out of your body. But what else was there to do?
I kind of feel like I’m reliving the same day over and over as well. Wake up, toilet, breakfast, retrieve the waste packet, do a system check, do an EVA to clean the solar panels, tend to the potatoes,...
If I want to communicate with Hermes or Earth, I fear the only way is to get to the Ares IV mission site, so I can use the communication system of the MAV. NASA has already put it there, so it can make fuel and they can be sure the Ares IV crew have a shuttle to get back to Hermes with. I know it’s there, because we brought it with us, and Bill guided the damn thing down before we left the Hermes.
As I have said before, it is only in their own interest. They have a long journey ahead before they reach Earth, and they need to focus. The shock of losing a crewmember was bad enough.
Sherlock hated to go in for paperwork, but on the other hand he loved the opportunity to gloat and show the incompetent idiots of the Met how it’s supposed to be done - so generally he didn’t make a fuss about it. John certainly seemed eager to get it over with, and the sooner it was done, the sooner they could go back home and watch crap telly or check their inbox for a new case.
As I’ve said before: the rovers aren’t made for trips like this - but I plan to pimp one and make it the best fucking Mars Rover in history. I’ll need to be able to take supplies, because it will be a long trip. I’ll need to be able to live on the road, basically. It’ll have to be a miniature mobile Hab.
John nods. Sherlock shuffles outside. John watches golden dust particles dance in the beam of sunlight still illuminating Sherlock’s chair and takes a deep breath.
We’ll have a look in a year or so, when we can be sure the body will be covered in dust. You will have enough time before the launch of Ares IV to check if there is anything useful left. Please focus on the Hermes and the preparations for Ares IV.
I want you to know that we are looking forward to your return home. Ella wanted me to remind you that she is always available if you need to talk.
SH: It’s simple: he needs the plutonium to save battery power. The heating takes up half of the energy if my calculations are correct (they are), so he’s decided to turn it off. It’s too cold to drive without heating, however, so he dug up the RTG as a portable space heater.
: You could say that. I’ve been working on the Ares missions from the start. My team is responsible for the psychological support, the selection process, and we also help prepare the crew for life in space.
Okay, I’ve spent last night checking the technical info we have on the Rovers on the Hab computer and doing some calculations. There are a lot of things I need to do to get the Rover ready for a long trip, but I’ll start with an important element: power. The rovers have batteries, but they need regular recharging. Because they were built for short drives, they are not equipped with solar cells - we just recharge them at the Hab. I’ll need solar cells for my trip, though, so I’ll have to borrow some from the Hab. I’ll need to recharge when I have sunlight and drive during twilight.
Before we left on this mission, Ella told us that keeping logs was good for our mental health. I really doubt that, but it might be useful for NASA in some way if they ever find this. And besides, it keeps me busy. But maybe I should start at the beginning.
I miss London. Things are so bland here. The food, the rooms, the buildings. They don’t know how to make a decent cup of tea. I don’t understand how Mycroft can bear it. But I suppose he’ll go anywhere where they let him lead an organisation like NASA.
“Morning, Sally”, Sherlock addressed the soles of her shoes. She spluttered weakly, trying to get back on her feet.
Apart from my eardrums and burned clothes, I seem to be fine too, thank god. The shoulder is acting up a bit, but I’ll just have to deal with it. I’m going to call it a day, and tomorrow I’ll check the equipment and do a full system check.
“How did you…that’s amazing, I...you really think I’d be a good surgeon?” he stammered, studying his own hands and looking back up at Sherlock. It dawned on him he wanted to know the man’s name, for him not to be a stranger anymore.
They’re in bed. Sherlock’s feet are cold, pressed against John’s. Sherlock’s slim fingers are following the contours of John’s face. They are quiet, breathing each other’s air, gazing at each other. John smiles.
He spotted an empty stool at the bar and went towards it. Generic lounge music filled the air and dolled up women and men were chatting and laughing in small groups around the bar. Like Sherlock, they were waiting for the moment the DJ would come out and they could dance the night away. Sherlock ordered a drink - normally he avoided alcohol, but he didn’t have classes or rehearsals the next day and he just didn’t care. If that meant spending his free day nursing a hangover, so be it.
As we agreed earlier, we will research all options we have to try to save John Watson. As Director of Mars Missions, you are in charge of this project, and we will contact all necessary people when our research demands it. We will still continue preparing for Ares IV, but Watson is clearly our priority now.
John is struggling with the plastic bags, fumbling to get the door open, when he hears Sherlock shouting and, apparently, destroying his study. He drops the bags and goes to investigate. He finds Sherlock in the middle of his room, surrounded by papers and books, the chair pushed over, hands pulling at his hair.
“I can’t find my pen, John, the one the Yard got me when we left London,” he snaps irritably. John stays calm, walks over to Sherlock, grabs his hand. Sherlock is shaking, his fingers cold, his eyes large and frantic in his pale face.
John really enjoyed their usual languid kisses, the way Sherlock could melt against him, the softness. That was a Sherlock only John got to see, and it was a small miracle how tender and fragile he allowed himself to be at those times. But this, this was why he wanted to be with Sherlock - the puzzles, the adrenaline kick, the frantic energy. Making himself useful, being in danger and being dangerous in turn. It made him want to be alive. It made him want to feel everything at once.
: We’re back with a new Watson Report! John has been very busy the last few days, so let’s find out what it’s all about! We have an interesting guest for you today, don’t we Richard?
: For longer missions, it’s very important that the crew is compatible, that they are able to trust each other and work and live together in a small space for a long time. They will face new and possibly life-threatening situations. We do extensive testing to get a good reading of their personalities and their stress resistance.
But then I thought, if I connect the air valve that would normally connect to the Rover directly to the Hab, the air wouldn’t be lost at all! So that’s what I did yesterday.
At around 4:30 a.m. CST our satellites detected a storm approaching the Ares III mission site on Mars. The storm escalated to severe and we had no choice but to evacuate the crew and abort the mission. Commander Sholto and the entire crew performed admirably, but it is with great sadness we have to inform you that during the evacuation astronaut John Watson lost his life.
Sherlock scrapes the chair over the tiles, sits down, reaches for the paper, and starts complaining about it immediately. John is making eggs and toast. Sherlock refuses to eat. John is reminded of all the mornings they shared in 221b and smiles at the stove.
We hope he’s not going there yet, but he doesn’t know we’re watching him, and the Ares IV MAV would be a way for him to communicate with us.
They went back to 221B, giddy and high on adrenalin, where John checked the cut on Sherlock’s arm while waiting for the takeaway.
How do you think Commander Sholto would react if he knew the man he left for dead, the man he couldn’t save, is in fact still alive?
The problem is that there is no Hab and no real supplies yet, so I won’t be able to survive there for long. The rovers are also not built for long drives, their navigation is tied to the Hab and their battery life is short, so it would be a one way trip if I ever make it there at all.
Greg: Yeah, it seems too soon for that. He could of course be desperate to talk to us. He doesn’t know we’re watching him, he’s all alone up there. But Sherlock is right, there is only the MAV, none of the pre-supplies are there yet. It’s very risky. If anything goes wrong with the Rover…
Another benefit is that it annoys Mycroft to no end, but he can’t really do anything about it, since Mike rightly wanted to make use of my expertise in telecommunication. So you see, I’m doing quite well.
Henry, if I ever make it back you will have to explain to me why you’ve chosen botany as your area of expertise.
I guess I need to stick around until the Ares IV mission. That...is a long while. If my ‘death’ doesn’t change the program, they’ll land in about 4 years.
Sherlock snorts, but follows John to the kitchen, calms down, drinks tea. After he eats his apple tart, and half of John’s, he dozes off in his chair. John cleans up the study, finds the pen in the drawer where they’ve kept it since they moved in. He misses Greg. Misses Sherlock. And then he’s angry with himself, because Sherlock is still here; he’s right here.
“It’s incredible, Sherlock, I can’t believe you’ve solved this one so quickly.” It was true that John had seen Sherlock solve innumerable mysteries, but still he was in awe of the way Sherlock could piece everything together so easily. This case had seemed like a hopeless one, but barely three days had passed before they were forcing their way into their killer’s hiding spot.
Sherlock stares at him for a few seconds, sits down, reaches for the mug. John is making eggs and toast. Sherlock eats all of it. John washes the dishes after, remembering all the mornings they shared in 221b and blinks back his tears.
: Well, he’s been keeping busy, as you’ve seen on the footage. We think he’s preparing a longer trip with one of the rovers.
“I’m not like your school friends, John. I don’t understand the need for this idiocy.” He sipped from his cup. “What’s the purpose of it? We’re already friends and we already have a...bond, we don’t need this.”
: You’ve heard their eulogies when NASA organised the ceremony for John. It’s clear they were very emotional. They were very close, they’ve been training together for a long time... Some of them sought my help, but I won’t go into details, since that’s confidential.
Pulling an antenna out of your own shoulder is exactly as fun as it sounds. But I was quick about it, always the best way with things like this. I cleaned the wound carefully, but it didn’t look as bad as I feared. With local anesthesia I was able to stitch myself back together. Do not try this at home, kids! It’s not as neat as it would have been if I could have used my left hand (my clean stitches are praised from Afghanistan to Mars, I’ll have you know), but it’ll do. I’ll need to take some antibiotics to be safe, and I’ll have to be careful for at least a few days.
John pretended not to see the knowing smirk on Greg’s face when he moved to follow Sherlock and hoped to God he hadn’t had the chance to catch them at it on camera.
[James Sholto:] John was a reliable crewman, a highly capable medic, and a good friend. It doesn’t feel right that we’re here without him. I’m honoured to have been his commander during this journey and to have had him by my side during the training process. He was a valuable part of our team and he won’t be forgotten.
He still felt unsure about Sherlock, worried about reading him the wrong way. But now being together was easy again. Effortless. They had fun together, both during cases and in between. He thought about losing Sherlock again, and still not having said all the things he had kept to himself for so long. Maybe it was worth the risk.
John is in Year 12: a fresh new batch of A-Level students at age 16 and 17. John is 16 (he despises the fact that he will be so until mid-August, for he hates being the young one). He was close to being put into the younger year but he just scraped past. Anyway, he’s glad he was. He’s got Lestrade and other mates in this year, a solid rugby team and is surprisingly intelligent all considering.
John makes a quick dash into one of the boxes outside his and Rosie’s room, trying to find a specific collection of papers and simultaneously attempting to not make very much noise. He’s placed his glass down on the coffee table before exiting so not to spill the expensive scotch.
"Hey kiddo. What’s on your mind today?" "Why don’t you kiss Sherlock like Uncle Greg and Mycroft?" Sherlock winced. Thinking of Graham and Mycroft kissing was painful at the worst of times. Luckily he had a sink nearby if he felt the desperate urge to vomit.
"Oh I agree, but let's continue the facade of hating it....oh god I can't watch that how am I ever going to get used to that?" Sherlock's face was disgusted as he watched 'Mystrade' kiss.
Of course John wanted to be with Sherlock - more so than he already was, more than "best friends". But he’ll suffice for this - living with him, and their daughter, because Rosie is fiercely
Our school prides itself in being worthy and exceptional at educating all of our students no matter whether in school or learning from place of residence. It is for that reason we have decided to set up learning via Zoom, with live action of the teacher so it is just like in class….
But this...John being bi, openly admitting it in front of Sherlock, the man he lives with. This is one thing that is entirely new. John must know he’s gay. He’s never explicitly asked, but, surely, even after his failed (successful, in Sherlock’s point of view) exploits with Janine, he can tell that Sherlock is the poster boy for homosexuality, surely. Sherlock Holmes around women is the most awkward scenario ever, unless he helps them get dates or deduces them. Sherlock only gets flustered if it’s a man flirting with him, never a woman. Merely confused, sometimes. John can hardly miss that kind of thing. He must know. He must. So why hadn’t he acted on it?
"I can assure you," Sherlock said quietly, wishing for a glass of scotch to be in his fingers so he could sip out of it lazily. "Mycroft has been keeping a close eye. What else did you take?"
"I do not know, I can assure you. The information has been kept privy from me." Sherlock has not been told explicitly, but he had deduced it.
"I like girls and boys," John smiles at his daughter, who seems unfazed, and this time Sherlock does drop a plate. Luckily, it’s in the sink, and he quickly manages to cover it up by claiming he wasn’t holding it right, not because of the sudden surprise about John’s sexuality.
So John looks up to see the green box highlighting who was speaking and the camera is faced on a Year 11.
Mr Halesworth is in the middle of drawing a benzene ring on his shared screen, his mouse clicking away as he does it and John is dutifully copying it down.
"And I’m sorry if you aren’t human enough to work out that you’re the most important person in my life-" Sherlock can’t take it anymore. Not one more word, it’s too much for his beaten little heart.
Now John stares at him, clearly thinking he should also be committed to psychiatric ward. "What’s Bastardian?" John is clearly ready to receive some kind of long insulting tirade of how idiotic he is that he wouldn’t know the concept of Bastardian, but it is something that only he and Mycroft share knowledge of, so that wouldn’t apply.
"Keep it," Sherlock waves a hand, pointing at the door. "Mycroft has spares, I’ve got a new one. New chapter, so to speak."
Then the camera switches to Mr Halesworth and John bristles with annoyance as though Zoom has personally offended him. He wanted to stare at the Year 11, the blissful pleasing to the eyes that had presented himself and was now whisked away, but instead he gets the teacher’s bushy mustache? Not a fair trade.
Matt was sitting in the visitors chair avidly listening. A friend, John had told them. Though it was clear they knew what was really going on. The fact that they weren’t looking to discipline him for the inappropriate relationship only further proof that his military career was over. The guilt still prickled at the back of his brain that Matt had been the one to pull him clear. That he would never have been involved if he hadn’t been with John at the wrong moment.
‘I didn't mean…’ Sherlock sounded genuinely appalled. He had doubtless been oblivious to the effect he was having. He had, after all, been suppressed until a few weeks ago.
As Soo Lin made to reach for something the few lights that had been on in the echoing room went out.
'Sorry-I must have dosed off.' He sat up everything was stiff, he was embarrassed to note he had been resting against Sherlock's leg but the detective slept on oblivious. 'No problem, that's the longest he's slept since he got here, he's been driving the nurses batty. Besides, I wanted to talk to you. I'm Dr Sloan.'
'Thanks for coming.' He said, as he saw Sherlock. 'Bit of a strange one, I was walking home and I heard this rattling coming from among those trees' he pointed to where a row of beeches screened the street from the unsightly area behind. 'I thought it was one of the feral cats caught in something so I comes through for a look and there he is.'
‘I know what you meant.’ The instrument squealed as he scraped the strings too harshly. The thing you want, I'm not sure I can give you.’
‘It gets better.’ The cabbie said, gesturing for Sherlock to follow him out of the cab and into an all but deserted college building. Not where he personally would have chosen but interesting. Not as obvious, cliched, as some waste ground at least. They made their way to a lab classroom, sitting opposite each other on tall stools.
A rogue rivulet of cooling dish water ran into John's collar and made him jump, breaking the spell. They drew away simultaneously, Sherlock to his washing up and John to a previously unknown fascination with the cruet set.
‘I believe you thousands wouldn’t.’ John said as Sherlock squirted some into his outstretched hand. ‘Will you be joining me?’ The velvet hid nothing and if that wasn’t telling enough Sherlock’s cheeks were stained pink, his pupils wide. John patted the blanket beside him. So much for a first date- but then didn’t some of the best first dates he could remember finish like this? Well, a bit like this anyway-it was Sherlock Holmes after all.
‘If you decide to go ahead with me we'll go carefully OK? I'll explain things, go at a speed that suits you. You control this. What's your first name by the way?’ John was fighting the urge to move closer.
John moved away from him to grab glasses and wine. He set them on the coffee table in the living room, sat on the couch and patted the space beside for Sherlock to come and join him. It appeared rather than a quiet night with his book he was on a date. He wasn’t going to tell Sherlock that just yet though.
'I know you too well mate. If I leave you alone I dread to think what you'll be up to. You can come with me in the morning. See if we can't work out a way to get these bastards.'
As he moved to perch on the chair arm he began to find the dressing gown a nuisance and scrabbled to untie the cord while nuzzling at that temptingly elegant neck.
Sherlock had simply finished his tea and continued to compose his music until they found the abandoned warehouse Mycroft was being housed in. He’d brought the companion to the walkie talkie that Mycroft had had embedded into his breast pocket which held the family crest somehow, and could hear everything he was saying.
The floor Lestrade’s team worked on was already chaos. Someone senior, with a lot of braid on his hat was addressing a team that was putting on body armour. Sally stood at the edge of the group and looked, for the first time John could remember, pleased to see them. She gestured them into a conference room.
Sherlock moved his hand to rest on John’s crotch for half s second. ‘Show me.’ He said, voice dry and eyes wide.
John sat on the floor beside him sipping his own mug of tea while Sherlock ate and drank. The doctor voluntarily told him the same story as he'd read on his personnel file. He was so open that Sherlock felt almost guilty for having looked into him vicariously.
'Shit. Joe.' Greg looked at John. 'They don't know any more than I've got a source but if he calls...'
'At the weekend he took me to this nightclub he has a share in. Flash place, made me feel about a hundred but anyway, it was going well. He was a bit pissed and he was moving in the direction of making me a serious offer, you know, cash. Suddenly he decides he wants to take me through the back. Says he's got a surprise for me. So I'm thinking the worst. We go through to this room, just as flash as the rest of the place but with a naked girl lying on a bed. John, you should have seen her. Her eyes were so - gone - and she had this blotchy flush everywhere.'
He could hear the creak of the alphas step behind him as he clambered onto the bed, positioning himself on hands and knees. Undignified- but now he didn't care. The urgency, the anticipation was bone deep as the mattress dipped under John’s weight.
An address they didn't know about. 'Do you know the postcodes? Even bits of them would help.' Greg continued, pen poised on a notebook.
‘I do so hate this business of them being paraded like offerings you see in other houses.’ She said, as if she expected John to be an old hand at brothels and to know what she was talking about.
Suddenly the penny dropped with John. Mycroft thought John would be a compliant omega the catch-all solution to any alpha hormone problem according to some people- no wonder Mycroft had offered him so much money when he had moved in with Sherlock at first.
'You’re ex-military, I think we lead with that.' Sherlock went on, regarding the question as rhetorical. 'Your experiences have made you concerned about security, especially with a new mate to be. I don't know exactly what is going on in there but I have a feeling, given the background of the supposed victim, you'll be among former colleagues. I have a feeling they are selling more than old cars.'
‘I don't think this can wait. Van Coon, he was murdered.’ Sherlock took in the discomfort of the faces at Sebastian's table.
As usual Sherlock's learning process was lightning. As he began to move he must have noticed how John was trying to shift around to get a particular friction. Sherlock, with typical efficiency, realised this could be done more easily and he gently moved John's legs and supported his hips till the omega's gasps seemed to satisfy him he'd got it right.
Practically speaking at least, he was organised and the soldier in him took comfort in that. He had moved the sofa into Sherlock's room and made it up as a bed with the help of a bemused Mrs Hudson (who had always assumed they were a couple and refused to be persuaded differently). He had gone out early to stock up on the sort of thing he thought Sherlock should be eating (vegetables, chicken) and the sort of thing he would eat even if he was being awkward (essentially posh biscuits). He had tidied extensively, moving the numerous trip hazards around the flat. Hopefully Sherlock wouldn't even notice that the piles of 'research' had been merged.
I'm going to sit for a minute, maybe best we're not seen together too much anyway. Thanks for this- I know it's hard.' John looked at him sympathetically and Joe shrugged slightly as he moved off.
He opened the door to the waiting room a crack and looked out. Joe. Trying to disappear into the corner.
'I've created a monster.' John said, arousal settling in his belly as Sherlock backed him against the wall.They fumbled their way to the narrow bed.
‘It's supposed to. It'll make it look,to both sides, like you're losing it. It will set hares running. I know you think my mind's full of John and I won't argue but at this stage it feels like we need to force something. With Joe spirited away, now this he may already be on the back foot.’
' Yes. I had hoped after five years maybe they would have forgotten me, but they never really let you leave. A small community like ours – they are never very far away.' Soo Lin was tearful and Sherlock couldn't help but wonder, given where she'd chosen to live, how far away Soo Lin really wanted to be.
John's limbs would barely cooperate as Sherlock saw him downstairs and into the cab. He let the omega rest against his shoulder as he chaperoned him across the city.
Sherlock moved around the trading floor to the amusement of the mostly alpha staff. Ducking behind pillars and desks. The target was clear. Eddie Van Coon, he worked on Hong Kong trades so the timing made sense too.
‘One thing.’ John's breath was close to his neck and it felt almost obscene in public after what had passed between them. Sherlock glanced up and down the street but they were all but alone.
'What's that on your neck?' His stomach lurched because he already knew the synthetic scent that was invading his nose.
'Most alphas are morons.' Sherlock said, getting up and stretching. 'I think I'll take my pills and go back to bed.'
‘I think that we, the Met and her Majesty’s government are being used. I plan to get out in front somehow. If we can get some detail from these earlier cases.The method was so unusual, with the taxi victims we never got to motive. We know there were potentially at least two cuckolded spouses. Then there is the MP.’
‘Niall Gray I presume.’ Sherlock said formally. ‘You’ve been relying on people thinking you’re dead.’
‘What happened between you two? There was kind of a feeling.’ John continued, trying to sound casual.
‘I wouldn't say that.’ The alpha regarded him with a professional eye as he dropped the bags. Moving to guide Sherlock by the shoulders into the room.
'Now- he has become their puppet, in the power of the one they call Shan – the Black Lotus general.vWhen I turned him away. He said I had betrayed him. Next day I came to work and the cipher was waiting.' She stared into the middle distance.
John felt his hips buck and tightened the grip on the curly head moving in his lap. 'Sherlock I'm close.'
'You cracked the code though. Maybe now Dimmock can get the rest.' John was being kind. Sherlock appreciated the effort.
‘What are we talking about now?’ John said putting down the tray of drinks. He’d been gone for ten minutes to the absolutely mobbed bar and the conversation seemed to have moved on from West Ham’s prospects next season.
This had become close and personal, claustrophobic. Expanding out and then closing back in on him again. The sensation was unsettling.
‘She's the only one who this has came as absolutely no surprise to.’ John said, looking serious for a moment as he drank and Sherlock didn't deduce for once, he just knew what John was thinking.
'Surely that's just asking for trouble, in their business.' John said thoughtfully. Looking for Greg's number in his phone.
‘Is it that bad?’ Sherlock mumbled, nose nuzzling at the junction of thigh and pelvis. Surprising himself that he was asking the question and was interested in the answer. John's scent was strongest here, like a handful of crushed aromatic herbs.
Sherlock turned to quickly smile at his mate. This close Lestrade did smell of aroused omega though he'd obviously made an effort to cover it with deodorant.
‘Harry’s eyes were wet when he looked at her. ‘That's sickeningly nice. You deserve something nice after everything.’ From his hard as nails sister this was verging on uncomfortably sentimental.
‘Never mind that. We found the case. According to someone, the murderer has the case, and we found it in the hands of our favourite psychopath.’ Anderson said, with obvious delight.
The air almost felt curdled with pheromones and it seemed to make his balls (surely impossibly) tighten further.
‘Thought you'd never ask.’ John grinned, shedding his robe without ceremony.He stood in an unconscious parade rest for a few moments.
The following day he found himself sitting in another café. Fashionable and airy with blackboards and bare wood.
‘Oh no I’m a consulting detective, the only one in the world. My associate downstairs, he is police though.’
‘They have the CCTV. He was approached by a member of the shop staff and then he disappeared. A few minutes later a van no one can account for pulls up at a loading bay for a few minutes. He was probably known in the shop, it was the one closest to his flat. They maybe asked for his help with a shoplifter. They’ll have the footage sent to the yard but…’
'It was here, just now lots of it, how can they have?-so quickly.' The wall John was pointing at was black and a wet paint smell hung in the air. John's bemusement quickly turned to anxiety as he realised they were being watched. Sherlock grabbed him, he needed John to focus.
They ended up at the absurd point of sitting on the edge of the bed to impatiently remove the last of their clothes and grinned at each other. The easy, cosy feeling that came over Sherlock at this point was it's own sort of overwhelming.
He felt caught out. Like he was cheating on John. An absurdity, on several levels. ‘You can’t deny the brilliance.’ He said, sipping his tea, an excuse to look down.
He reached for the the thermometer and monitor beside the bed. Taking his measurements as best he could in the position and noting them down.
Sherlock began to move too but then hesitated. ‘John we did discuss my inexperience. It’s not that I’m averse to you inside… but I don’t know that..’He broke off pressing his knees together.
Inside it was very like the place Joe had shown John. They methodically searched the rooms. Working together seamlessly as usual. They were on the point of giving up when John noticed the headboard. It was a chocolate coloured velvet and looked deep and squashy but up close was rigid and hollow.
The older brother fished a pack of expensive looking cigarettes out of his pocket and there was a rasp of a match as one was lit.
‘I'll take the gun please.’ Sherlock said, calling his bluff. The cabbie hesitated before pulling the trigger, the small gas flame pathetically flickering for a second. ‘Well I look forward to the court case.’ Sherlock smiled tightly and made to leave hesitant because this, to him, was a problem only half solved.
They spent the walk planning for the following day when they'd both be free. National gallery and a boat trip to Greenwich they decided. Harry was in town for an interview, last minute, hence the just turning up.
Lestrade's nerves were obvious to Sherlock in the way he stood as he waited by the window while John got ready. Slightly hunched but never quite still. Given he was going to meet a known criminal with the implicit understanding he was willing to be bribed it could actually work in his favour.
Sherlock did as suggested. Changing into a robe in the bathroom (absurd-the alpha would be inside him soon). Making tea and lying on the bed to read the police forensics manual he'd swiped from Lestrade's desk.
A fortnight later Sherlock let himself into a hotel room. Anonymous and corporate if upscale. Comfortable, quiet, private, safe.
Melissa Graeme was a petite, immaculately groomed, brunette. As they were introduced she gushed about how nice it was to meet him and how lucky Greg was. John got the feeling he was on the business end of a well-rehearsed performance.
‘You should know, I've never done this before.’ Sherlock said looking into the amber depths of his Earl Grey tea. ‘I know my brother-my recent issues. He assumes that I've been promiscuous but…’
There's more divergence from season 1 than with previous chapters. I'm still hoping to be in the spirit of The Great Game though.
Thank you for your letter and for the teabags and biscuits. I would say ‘you shouldn’t have’, but I wouldn’t mean it, so I’ll just ask you to send me more whenever you can. I’m sure you’re bored without me there.
‘Don't I? Statistically, eventually most alphas want the same. For now it's my arse and that's fine. I want a knot just as badly so that's- fine but in a year or two, once you've got a thriving practice again, you'll want me pregnant, all round bellied, broody. I'm not sure I ever want that. That's why you see, why I do this. Avoids disappointment.’
'This is where they run things from- for now. It's a show flat in one of the developments, changes every few months. There's no omegas or drugs but that's where they do the admin, for want of a better word.' Joe flicked his cigarette to the ground, grinding it out. 'Richard works there one day a week. There's paperwork, to do with transport mostly.' Joe got up then quickly sat back down.
John wished her a happy birthday and she led them over to a group where Mr and Mrs Holmes sat. They introduced themselves and Mrs Holmes hugged him (Mr Holmes excusing himself from the otherwise all omega group). She was actually almost tearful at the idea of Sherlock having someone and John felt the weight of the responsibility keenly.
'There was something synthetic about it. The smell.' He'd been contemplating this in the car, comparing the scent to John. Obviously different omegas had different scents but this was more than that. Like the difference between a freshly sliced lemon and that bright yellow liquid Mrs Hudson used to clean the bathroom.
‘You think he's done it before?’ John came and stood at his shoulder. Sherlock getting up sharply as the alpha read because he knew how he must be starting to smell, knew it wasn't fair on John.
There was the gesture, given this was a consulting room, of a tap to the door before the CO barrelled inside.
‘You were recommended by one of your colleagues actually, John Watson.’ Sherlock acknowledged to himself that he was shamelessly fishing for information but decided it was reasonable, now John was assisting him with the work on occasion.
Lestrade he realised. as Anderson reluctantly brought him through the cordon, was genuinely shaken. Not his crime scene-he had actually found the body. He stood back a distance from the officers in charge.
Sherlock, what is this?’ They were back at Baker Street John was staring into his bowl of food while Sherlock tinkered with his violin at the window. He hadn't touched it in days. Nothing like needing a cock inside you to make you lose your interest in Mendelssohn.
Sherlock had a good sized private room. Whether this was Mycroft pulling strings from a distance or the nurses pissed off with him deducing staff and patients alike every five minutes wasn't clear. John couldn't decide if he was grateful for the privacy or not.
Sherlock's mouth was already on his, long fingers impatiently pulling the robe away, the pile of fabric sliding to the floor. John let himself sink into the bed, a wave of alpha pheromones encouraging him to slip into a warm, submissive place, even if only for a moment.
‘Greg, here, shame to waste it.’ John pressed the glass into his hand as the alpha stepped forward. He noticed a very slight but unmistakable movement from Sherlock as Greg moved towards him ,a protective gesture, unconscious on the alpha’s part. In his current condition it sent an urgent pleasant energy coursing through his body. ‘Victor, Greg Lestrade, he likes scotch too.’
'You should just have gone. I don't want to keep you back.' Sherlock felt defensive. He didn't want the responsibility of John at his beck and call. More than that he didn't want the responsibility of John in the middle of whatever else was happening.
’ Sherlock heard whatever John had been reading being tossed aside and a hand landed in his hair. The alpha hummed, content.
They didn't have to hide long in the restoration room till she emerged from a ventilation duct and began work on her precious teapots. Sherlock felt bad interrupting her, she obviously took comfort in the ritual.
When he returned John had rolled onto his belly and was stretched across the bed. Sherlock took a few moments to watch him, paying particular attention to the exit wound scar.
Lestrade patted him on the shoulder awkwardly. ‘Honestly you don't. You've just got to trust to instinct.’ Lestrade chewed his lip, obviously looking for something more positive, useful to say. ‘There's less blood than you'd think, I can say that. Also, in the moment, you can see it's what they want.’
‘Easy.’ The alpha said, holding him up.’ I'm not knotting you on a hard floor, not with this leg.Besides, I want to take you on a bed the first time. ’
‘You're asking me to share your heat?’ The alpha asked licking his thin lips. There was quiet promise in the gesture.
' You must be pretty thick Raffles. Not only is there fuck all to steal but you're robbing the wrong person.'
So much bare skin contact seemed to calm Sherlock, make him serious. Their kisses softened as the alpha' s hand slid down John's belly and gently along his swelling flesh before moving between his legs. Tensing as his fingers found where John was sensitive, wet and, suddenly, oh so empty. He broke away.
'You'd be a great bondmate, you're respectful and kind - in your own way. You don't assume or demand anything. Don't get me wrong, you're off your head, I don't really want to share a fridge with you and I wouldn't be surprised if you get me killed one day. John stopped abruptly and looked up at him, he appeared to be proposing, omegas didn't propose. They submitted, presented their neck.
'Come on Molly I'll take you in, don't want you accosted by strange men in the lift.' He took the keys from John.
The officer opened his mouth to say something else but thought better of it, walking away talking into his radio as his colleague hand cuffed the thief.
John laughed a little. 'Of course we can. You're adorable when you're inarticulate.' He pecked the alpha on the lips again before carefully getting up. He had the urge to lead Sherlock by the hand to the bedroom in some grand romantic gesture but that obviously wasn't going to work. Instead he walked ahead, switching on the lamp and turning down the bed.
The doctor asked about his work as a detective, asked if it could be dangerous. When Sherlock confirmed it could be John got a wistful look in his eye.
He gently opened Sherlock's bedroom door. The alpha was wrapped in the blanket John had borrowed the night before, gently snoring. He decided, given how he'd woken up this morning, to go to his own bed for a change. He climbed the stairs to his neglected room, stripping to his underwear before crawling gratefully under the duvet.
Running full pelt through the crowd he carried an aluminium walking stick like a weapon. Assuming an accomplice Sherlock pushed himself extra hard , fighting his lethargic legs, only for him to run straight into Mr Walking stick who had stopped dead and turned towards him. The thief had been caught by an (unusually observant) police officer.He found himself on the filthy tile floor practically on top of the man, the
John made tea while Sherlock made a mess. He’d pulled out every piece of paper they had on the serial suicides, the jade pin business. He was shuffling them like cards on the floor. ‘What are you looking for?’ John said quietly, not wanting to break his flow and getting no response.
‘Nearly there.’ Sherlock said, pulling John back to him and kissing the top of his head before carefully tidying up John's clothing as they travelled the last couple of hundred yards. He surveyed the street as the driver pulled over. It was quiet save for a couple of smokers outside the cafe. One of them, an alpha, made a casual crude remark and grabbed his crotch as Sherlock helped a shaky John from the car.
'I can see myself doing that.' John said, he loved that his job allowed him to help people but he couldn't deny that in civilian life he sometimes longed for a little more excitement. Generally he got that from Sherlock but a little more couldn't hurt. John tried not to look too keen.
'Do you see a bond bite?' John tilted his neck to emphasise the point. 'Its up to me. Though I will talk to him obviously. So?'
'Not exactly he, that is to say his minion, told me you needed my help urgently. It was implied it was life and death -the usual. I was kind of relieved they got in touch to be honest. I'm sorry . I shouldn't have left you there, like that. Especially when I knew those bastards were still nearby.' John sighed and looked at his feet. 'I really hope this isn't your idea of a date-this is -
. Yet in spite of their reputation for fucking around unbonded alphas could be remarkably persistent when they got attached.
The shot that saved Matt came from Thomson, boorish Thomson. It struck John then, with pain blurring and bittering his mind, that if he'd just turned Bill down, sent Matt to Thomson then, neither of them would be here.
He moved quietly inside closely followed by Lestrade. It confused him at first, the rich woody smell, so out of place. Then he realised what it was masking. His body was half a step ahead of his brain and arousal was already curling in his lower belly when his mind registered the cloying musk of omega heat. He was suddenly moving unconsciously towards it. He tried to shake off Lestrade when he grabbed his arm but the inspector was stronger and more in control, though not unaffected. His pupils were blown when Sherlock turned to him.
Molly and Lestrade looked at each other for a moment smiling in disbelief and then back at him. He saw something travel across Molly’s face and he realised. He'd got carried away, forgotten about his wrist.
‘Here, you need to drink plenty.’ John could feel himself getting hard at the sight and smell of him. He found himself relieved, he'd never had problems before but he'd had a niggling fear that he'd be faced with. desperate omega and suddenly become impotent.
'Look,' Sherlock pulled something up on his phone before pressing it into John's hand. 'It doesn't just happen here, things are stolen from rooms as well. In the rooms they take nothing else but the requested item so its not even seen as a theft sometimes. The person assumes they've lost it while drunk. The point is, the thieves are selective. They seem to have a taste for art deco and Edwardian pieces.' John skim read the review in front of him. A family heirloom necklace had been taken while a pricey gents watch sitting beside it had been left alone.
Greg nodded. 'Can you come with me to the nightclub on Thursday? Shouldn't be too dodgy. You might be able to help, see if any of the omegas around know anything about the trafficking.'
'Were in the fucking the army John. People get shot. I'm perfectly capable of deciding who I fuck and how I operate on patrol, regardless of what's between my legs.' Matt drew a breath and blew it out steadily. 'Look I can see you’re not...I'll get in touch the next time I'm on leave alright?' Matt gathered his jacket and John accepted a peck on the cheek. Neither of them speaking in case they betrayed how close they were to tears.
The armed police officers were standing in front of him, they had quickly established that  something was going on in the house. Something fiddly had now been done with a drill and a miniature camera and they could see a blurry, odd angle of the living room.
'John, just wanted to let you know it's much appreciated.' There was a creak in the background and John imagined Mycroft leaning back in a heavy leather chair in some far flung outpost of the Diogenes Club.
'Hang on.' John grabbed his arms and rolled them both till Sherlock was on his back. Pinned with a move from a long ago hand to hand combat course.
Greg let out a breath. 'That could work. You're thinking he'll offer assistance in scaring the other alpha off?'
A primitive rhythm that he would have thought brutal but for the way John arched into the contact, swearing breathlessly as he bared his neck for the bite. Sherlock realised that this would be over very quickly, too quickly perhaps, when he felt the extra resistance of his swelling knot.
' Don't worry,I'd worked it out anyway. The way you look at each other.' John smiled and Joe fought back his own grin.
John had started to feel better about Harry, eventually, he'd stayed a week longer than planned. She'd finally lost that stillness that made her seem like an accident waiting to happen.
They found a quiet corner and made their calls. Sherlock coaching Lestrade through his calls to both Graeme and internal affairs. He didn't have to fake the required edginess. Then he called his brother.
'The Sherlock Holmes? You look different without the hat.' Jason said, with a lop-sided grin that John remembered being unable to resist once upon a time.
Sherlock stood and pulled his shirt over his head, unconsciously adjusting his hair before moving his hands to his waistband. As the trousers were unfastened and began to slide down over otherwise naked hips the impression John got was of roundness, abundance. Rather at odds with the long lean angles on display in his suits. Sherlock’s cock was thick and the curve of his arse was decidedly generous.
The deflection was obvious but accurate, by the time they got back he'd barely have time for a sandwich before he had to go out again.
John woke to a dull throb. The sofa was fine most of the time but it didn't always agree with his bad shoulder. He turned to pick up his phone from the floor beside him and startled at the figure perched on the the arm of the sofa until he recognised the profile.
‘No, no, no.’ John said into Sherlock’s hair as he gently climbed into his lap. ‘I meant this.’ He took Sherlock’s hand and carefully pressed the fingers around both their erections.
He'd a acquitted himself well at the crime scene considering. He lacked the flow, the speed, focus he'd have after a whole heat spent with an alpha but he'd managed.
‘You should go to A&E, get it x-rayed.’ The alpha carefully helped him to his feet using his good arm. ‘John Watson by the way.’ The alpha added before they were rudely interrupted.
'Graeme will ask you quietly about it at some point, offer help, public humiliation is not his style. He will immediately see it as another opportunity for you to owe him. Combined with what appears to be your covert and subtle handling of the dead omega from the other day you are well on the way to being his favourite member of the Met.'
'On another day another situation he'd have been have been the one trying to protect you and you'd be the one saving his arse in the end You're what's that word, two things that need each other?'
'Was Mycroft threatening you.' Sherlock said, kissing the top of his head absently and handing him another glass of champagne.
He had planned to go straight to bed but now realised that he would stink of Lestrade and that aside , the whole thing had made him feel decidedly grubby. He got fresh pyjamas from his own room and went for a shower. Lathering and rinsing repeatedly under water as hot as he could stand.
'Sally please take John to hospital.' Sherlock ordered , opening the back door of the car and bundling the clinging John inside with difficulty.
‘Well they’d have been hard pushed. That was the really bad winter. Nothing moved for weeks at the beginning of the month, then of the course the building trade takes a full two weeks at Christmas, sometimes more.’
Sherlock stepped away to the violin case. John's scent too good, too close. ‘It's late to be crossing town, even armed.’ They shared a grin. ‘There's a room upstairs. Mrs Hudson keeps it made up. You can sleep there tonight, if you like.’ John looked weary, doubtless they both did.
'I was tested for everything the last rehab I went to. Haven't touched anyone since or cocaine, I was always fastidious about needles anyway.'
‘There’s a hole in our security. Find it and we’ll pay you – five figures.’ Sebastian glanced between them as he produced a cheque. Obviously very pleased with himself to be throwing around such sums so casually. ‘This is an advance. Tell me how he got in, there’s a bigger one on its way.’
‘Well someone’s trying to get your attention. It’s different from flowers, I’ll give them that. I can see what this is, it’s not random, it’s not about some arms deal, it’s about you. I get it being about you. I can see why they…’ John paused and looked at him and they were back in the flat, during his heat. John’s arousal proud in front of him as he stalked towards Sherlock who was stretching on the bed waiting… ‘anyway. What they don’t realise that I do is you’re…’ John looked at him in a way that made him feel exposed. ‘You’re one of the good guys.’ John looked a little embarrassed and jumped up In the direction of the kitchen, probably to get biscuits.
