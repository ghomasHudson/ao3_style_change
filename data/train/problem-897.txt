"Merry Christmas Sherlock" John yawned happily into the silken plane of Sherlock's chest. "Merry Christmas John" Sherlock replied, stretching languorously. Looking around him, John had to admit that their room was beautiful. Situated at the back of the house, A large circular window facing east streamed hazy winter light across their skin. Framed by a cushioned window seat, the majority of the wall was consumed by the glass. "It was always the room I would choose when we ventured down here too." Sherlock said quietly, remembering a time not all that long ago when he'd hidden himself away in the small cupboard behind the bed to avoid his father, and how Mycroft, on the cusp of leaving him for boarding school, had found him and stayed, playing deductions with him until he'd gotten too bored to stay curled up together any longer. "It seems like the type of place you'd like" John agreed as he clambered out of bed and donned his dressing gown with a grin. "The other great thing about this room is the rather large shower just waiting for us to use it" Sherlock chuckled and hopped up, following his fiancé with a wide smile.
Sherlock tossed in his sheets, sweating as he dreamed. John in the lab during the HOUND case, only this time Sherlock was the hound, and he was out to get John, who was whispering Sherlock's name like a prayer for help that would never come because Sherlock was already trying to get him. John wrapped in a coat and a semtex vest with a gun against his head and Sherlock being forced to set it off. John's screams of agony as he clawed at the harpoon that flew into his gut, blood spiraling out to darken his shirt in the shape of a lotus flower. John on the roof of St. Barts with Moriarty. John on the pavement just outside of St Barts, eyes glassy and pulse already gone by the time Sherlock reaches him. Mary shooting John instead of Sherlock. Moriarty kissing John and walking away hand in hand with him. John dying in a sand dune, crying out for Sherlock to help but there's a canyon separating them. John in pain. John leaving. John dying. John hating him. John forgetting him. Sherlock cried out again and again, he would save him, he would.
Taking that as a sign that anything to do with family may be an unwelcome discussion, John nodded and said nothing more. As Sherlock turned to hand the phone back to John, the scattered moonlight streaming through the window provided enough illumination for John to catch sight of Sherlock's left elbow.
"Alright Sally?" Jim slipped his phone back into his pocket and sat down at the smallest table in the lunch room of New Scotland Yard. "Did you get the texts?" Sally asked, smirking into her chips. "Yeah, sounded pretty urgent but you don't seem busy..." he looked around as if to make sure that she was in fact not busy, and Sally once again found herself agreeing with the freak's proclamation that he was a complete dunder head. "I was busy at the time and so were you. It was a crime scene Jim, we both worked on it until the Freak and his lap dog arrived?" Realisation dawned on him and he nodded, slyly pinching one of her chips. "Alright alright I'm not a total dim wit Sally, what about it?" Eyes darting around the packed room, Sally beckoned him in closer, leaning in until their bodies created a shielded circle. "Well, the freak was rushing about, spewing his voodoo crap while little lap dog was chatting to Greg in the corner right?" Anderson nodded, eyes wide, riveted already. If Sally Donovan knew one thing it was gossip and judging by her excitement this was good stuff. "Ok so he's leaning over for a while, examining the body and complaining when he does that thing where he jumps and runs away screaming something random about gardeners or colours or whatever. Lap dog trots loyal at his heels and that should be that. You know we all keep dusting for prints yada yada yada and it's all normal stuff. This time though, I was the only one left at the scene and when the freak jumped up, something fell out of his pocket.""What was it?!" images of human fingers and bloody knives ran through his head, but nothing prepared him for the shock he got when Sally placed it on the table. "A ring box. The freak was carrying a ring box. Haven't opened it yet, thought I'd wait for you" Sally batted her lashes a bit and shimmied closer still, hiding the box from view. "You gem Sally Donovan! You do the honours." Nervously, fingers tingling, she prized open the box and looked inside. "Well fuck me. He's going to propose?!"
The sound of fabric hitting the floor made John look for the source. "
hey ended up in the conservatory, with Sherlock's head on John's lap while they sat on the sofa. Sherlock fiddled with the leather bracelet on John's wrist, His army tags were attached to it and John never took it off. Sherlock felt John chuckle. "You have this fascination with it, my bracelet." Sherlock looked up at him "Every letter has a part of places you've been ingrained into it. Sand from Afghanistan, Dust from London, even some of our cases have a place in the engravings. If even one of them had been different we might never have met, and I would never have seen what I was missing out on." They lapsed into silence. "Well, neither would I." he leaned down and planted a soft kiss on his cheek. "Thank you, by the way. For all of this. I'll remember it when we have cases and you ignore me" he laughed briefly "Is it terrible that I'm excited to go home, and I'm hoping there's been a murder?" Sherlock grinned at that. "You are constantly surprising me John, constantly surprising."
You're very annoying, have I told you that before? -J
"What does that mean?" Greg whispered to John who was standing now. "Battle stations. Someone is going to die." He was up just in time to see Sherlock's head dip to whisper in Major Sholto's ear and the pair of them disappear off. "Call a medic would you Greg, and an officer or two as well. I think the suspect is in the building." Greg was already dialing before John had said call. John himself was rushing off with no explanation to the now mollified guests. Mostly they just accepted the word "Sherlock" and a shrug as explanation enough.
John was unconscious already, the calm of sleep smoothing out the lines of his face. Sherlock simply lay awake, combing through his mind palace. Try though he may, there were some memories that refused to be ousted from his domain and the recent ordeal was one of them. Sebastian Moran would join Sebastian Wilkes in the south tower, far from any other memories,or rather from any decent ones. The grass that surrounded that particular tower housed many graves, and was littered with needles and other memorabilia from dark nights in dark alleys. The sky above was always grey, dull and lifeless in that sector, as if the barbed wire on the ground had somehow met the sky and cordened it off. When he did venture there the visit was without fail brief and unpleasant. It was a dumping ground for the stubborn memories that he would like to be gone and while there were not that many memories preserved there, they were generally considered frightful in nature. This new one involving John was most vexing. Sherlock was all for danger, but knowing that he was the reason Sebastian had known where John was shed a new light on everything. He was a danger to John and that was unacceptable, John would get hurt by his side. Maybe it would be better in the long run to save him from all that now, to cut all ties? Sherlock thought about it, then dismissed it with a growl. He was much too selfish to do that. John deserved better.
The revelation had hit him on the plane, when Gregory had texted him asking (he thinks it was a joke) if this month long trip was annual so he could plan his own schedule around him being gone. In front of at least three colleagues, he'd almost actually laughed. And then it hit him that he was in love with the salt and pepper haired detective, and he was terrified. This was the point at which caring became a disadvantage, because now Gregory could destroy him by leaving, if he left Mycroft wouldn't be able to go to the manor because the whole place was memory after memory of Gregory, cooking, dressing, lounging, grinning, laughing, coming apart above him. At the same time, Gregory could be targeted by association and that... He wasn't sure which was worse because either way, whatever small semblance of a heart he had was Gregory's and would live and die with him. He sipped at his scotch.
” John panted as he slid to the ground against a wall, rubbing his eyes with the heels of his hands.
‘My shoes?’ John thought to himself, momentarily confused. ‘Oh my god. My
“Sherlock?” He called loudly, voice echoing down the seemingly empty corridor, but there was no way - unless the man was some sort of Usain Bolt speed runner - that he had made it very far.
Since the wedding, keeping in regular contact with Sholto had become a lifeline of sorts to a world where bravery was instinctive.
Sherlock had begun looking forward to sleep rather than resenting the fact that he had to succumb to it. In his dreams John spoke to him, asking him questions and simply telling him all manner of things. It was so vivid that sometimes Sherlock was not sure if he was asleep or awake. In his dreams John would profess his love for him over and over, never once asking for the words in return.
To be honest John hadn't even been all that surprised that she had picked up on the little (all consuming, John, admit that at least) spark that had been growing between them, even though he'd tried to avoid him, there are only so many times you can be caught lurking outside a door before people start to question your motives, doctor or not.
John was beginning to feel woozy, the blood had slowed to a creep, thick droplets rolling sluggishly across his skin, chasing rivulets of sweat to pool around his back. Sebastian watched him, stared at him even, as if he were a piece of food. The cigarette was half done, and that meant that his break was half done too. Sebastian's eyes swept up his arm and settled at the top of it, where his captain's patch was sewn on. Two steps and he was looming over him, blowing smoke in his eyes before pulling the cylinder from his lips and placing the tip onto his patch. The fibres shriveled quickly, blackening into wisps of nothing and still the burning went on. His skin was bare before Sebastian moved off, pulling the bracelet from his wrist. That made John furious, more so than he had been throughout the affair. It confused him as well, right up until Sebastian pressed the engraved surface against his newly exposed skin. The lighter flickered to life and illuminated the room for a few moments before Sebastian pressed it against the metal. John could smell his skin sizzling, burning his name into his skin. As the tag began to heat up it burned red and black, certainly second degree John thought as he struggled against the bonds, tearing the holes in his stomach wider with his movement. At least one thing had been clarified. He was in an old psychiatric hospital.
“Holmes!” John shouted again, “what is going on?!”
Mycroft rolled his eyes as he stepped back, but in doing so, his sudden movement caused the prisoner next to John’s cell to let out a horrible shriek.
“Our man hunt for the doctor and Mr. Holmes should widen to these areas…” Detective Baynes turned around to point to a map of greater London. The map had areas circled where John and Sherlock were known to frequent along with residences of people who had contact with them in the past.
Sherlock eyed Lestrade before verbally responding. He could tell that the inspector was keeping something from him.
The secretary shook her head. “No, he just left for lunch. Did you just schedule it because I don’t have any meetings in the books for him today.”
“Watson—”
Detective Baynes sighed before looking back at the house. “And it was only the other day that the Judge had graced me with his presence at the Yard.” He grinned at Lestrade once more before turning around to walk over to a group of other officers.
“Holmes!” John shouted, referring to the revolver that had landed a few feet away from the scuffle.
.” He offered, waving his arms about, the tone is his voice verging on the side of mystic. “The chaps at the Diogenes mention him frequently.”
“But…John told me that he lost this months ago—” He tossed the bag back on Lestrade’s desk before placing his hands on the edge to lean forward, “Dr. Carberry
Lestrade squeezed his eyes shut as the weight of Dr. Carberry’s murder rested on his shoulders. He knew John was innocent and he knew Detective Baynes had something to do with the murder, but it would only make Lestrade look incompetent if he accused the detective without any hard evidence.
John groaned loudly as soon as the door to their room closed. “Finally, some much-needed privacy.”
John looked up from his notes. “I only care about your wellbeing.” He added with a grin. He then rose from his chair to fetch Sherlock a cup of tea.
“Dinner is served.” He bowed before stepping to the side to let the group into the dining parlor.
John laughed before his expression grew serious. “I’ve always trusted you. You’re the only one I truly can.”
Sherlock slumped into the seat. “I’m only going because I want to.”
John let out a laden sigh, indicating that not only was he not pleased with the tone of the conversation, but over it as well. After a moment or so of silence, Sherlock began to rattle on about one of his findings as John mentally prepared himself for a weekend at Mycroft’s.
Lestrade sighed, looking up from his desk just in time to see Detective Baynes walking past the open door to his office.
Sherlock took a moment as he turned to look at John. “Watson, I’m sensing
Still holding onto Bridget, John let out the most dramatic groan. “Holmes!” He began through shear exasperation and disregard for the situation, “this was supposed to be a vacation!”
“Yes, of course,” James reached toward Sherlock to shake his hand, “pleasure to make your acquaintance, gentlemen. Our father is more than excited to have you both staying with us. God knows he can’t shut up about it.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes as he rose from the chair to stand in front of Mycroft and John. “Questioning my methods will only hinder my efforts. Everything is going according to plan, however,” he turned directly to face Mycroft, “Mycroft I need you to tell me about your informant. I need his name, now.”
Sherlock yanked on John. “Come along, Watson!” He then dragged John out of the room and down the stairs. They looked through the opening to the oval room to find the McArthur siblings speaking to themselves quietly, but there was no sign of Mr. McArthur.
“Mr. Holmes,” John could hear Detective Baynes, “we just need you and Mrs. Hudson to answer some questions, but that’s all. We’re holding Dr. Watson before transporting him to another facility.”
Mrs. Hudson sniffled with a nod before turning around to exit the sitting room. Mycroft sighed as he turned slightly to find Sherlock rifling through some documents on his desk.
Usually, John hated it when his companion studied him as if he were a potential clue or a wayward experiment, but something about Sherlock’s expression this time calmed John; he could tell that his companion was sincere in his intentions, no matter how irresponsible he had been since they found out that Carberry had been murdered.
Mycroft turned around to face Mary with a slight grin. “Ah yes, and it was such a lovely dinner, Margaret!”
“…I’ve…seen the ghost…with James—"
necessary for us to all be outside while it still feels like winter?
the only person who can help me.”
Sherlock and John were standing next to Mr. McArthur in the oval room near a window overlooking the cemetery as the latter talked on and on about purchasing the house and the cemetery.
“My dear Watson. It seems as if you’ve forgotten the affinity toward charity your alma mater encourages in her graduates. Perhaps you missed the memo?”
Detective Baynes flinched slightly before grinning. “Excuse me?”
John laughed awkwardly, causing Sherlock to reach out to rub his arm to help him retained his composure.
Sherlock waved his brother off as he stood in front of the fireplace, now clearly thinking deeply. Mycroft sat down in a chair, watching Sherlock now pace back and forth.
“Clara! What is going on?”
John sighed to himself, leaning forward to rest his head in hands, too shocked to piece together the situation.
Detective Baynes kept his eyes on some paperwork related to the Carberry case as he heard his name being called from the doorway of his office.
“Mary?” John said to himself, stopping in the middle of the street.
“Holmes!” John shouted through pain, but the force of the punch to his stomach kept him on the ground.
“What do we do? Father’s friends are visiting this weekend. And he is going to show them this house.”
John walked to the safe and crouched down. He could see Sherlock holding several documents. Sherlock handed the documents to John, and John looked at Sherlock before looking down at the documents. He could see a police report detailing the night Carberry was murdered and some information about Schuller’s drug poisonings with a memo stating that John was known to be in connection with the poisonings.
“I love you, too…” Sherlock answered. They stayed like this before John maneuvered them to the bed, gently pushing Sherlock onto his back before lying on top of him. They continued to kiss one another, letting their hands travel against the other.
John stared at Sherlock as the latter whirled around him gathering their things. “Wheeler? That’s our thief?”
John scrunched up his face. “How do you know that from only being here for a minute?”
Sherlock waved him off again. “The police are not helpful. You need to trust me.”
“…Mr. Holmes…I don’t know what you’re trying to get at, but—”
Sherlock walked toward the door before turning to face Warden James. “In what type of an emergency?”
“Holmes!” John shouted as he quickly followed, finding Sherlock running toward the luggage car, “what in God’s sake is going on?! And what are you wearing?!”
Gladstone sniffed the hat before taking off down the dock. John and Sherlock followed behind, managing to catch up with Gladstone who stopped to sniff in various areas before stopping to howl.
“Watson, we’re almost there.” John felt a hand on his shoulder, which instantly calmed his nerves to a degree but he couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed.
Sherlock smirked. “Merely keeping my eyes open and wide to the facts laid bare, Madame.”
John’s eyes widened as he accepted the card. “But how did he leave without us noticing him?”
“I’m coming!” He finally opened eyes in a huff as he launched himself out of his chair to march to the front door that led into his sitting room.
John groaned. “Are you never off the clock, Holmes? Please relax this weekend. I assure you nothing sinister is occurring underneath the surface.”
John glared at Sherlock. “And of course, I do all the work, but you get all the credit.”
“Holmes!” John shouted even louder before running toward Sherlock wrestling around with the ghost.
“It’s nice to meet you, Miss McArthur.” John greeted with a smile.
John looped his arm around Sherlock’s, tugging him toward the exit. “I think this is a good opportunity for us to mind our own business. Everything about this old house and cemetery is giving me the chills.”
Sherlock laughed again as he ascended the hansom. The laugh irritated John as he followed. “I’m serious,” he kept his voice to a whisper, “this is dangerous.”
Clara inhaled deeply as she concluded. “Mr. Holmes?” She kept her eyes on Sherlock, “am I…going to prison?”
Sherlock nodded once more, lingering a bit to indicate to John that he was doing his best not to devolve into a complete mess in public.
A man showed Moriarty through the main area of an opium den near the docks before they find the office in the back. The man opened the door for the professor who barely acknowledged him before walking into the office.
“Tell me what you know. You’re only helping Watson.” He pleaded.
“Good.” Sherlock sat back before looking at John who still looked incredibly confused. “I’ll explain everything when we get to the estate, Watson. But for now, young Wiggins gathered some items for me to help with the escape. Homemade smoke bombs that triggered the poorly designed cell door system.”
“Status please. I have a meeting in ten minutes.” Moriarty commanded to the group.
John looked around aimlessly, puzzled by Sherlock’s urgency. “Holmes? What in the—”
The interloper sat up straight in his chair, straightening out his jacket before waving his hand. “No, no. I don’t mean to interrupt, Professor Moriarty.”
“Mycroft, I’ll just be a minute.” He pointed in the direction of the restroom that was down the hallway in the opposite direction.
“To be accused of such treachery, my goodness, Mr. Holmes!” Bridget added angrily, through a fit of tears.
Sherlock grinned as he relaxed back into his seat. “That seems like a fair compromise.”
“Mary!”
“Holmes, you shouldn’t be here. The case is being handled.”
“…I suppose if we walk to 3
Sherlock nodded as turned to walk toward the breakfast table. “I very much appreciate that, Mycroft.”
“Quick, Wiggins!” Sherlock shooed Wiggins across the sitting room into the bedroom, shutting the door closed before launching himself into the sofa near the fireplace.
Lestrade threw open the door to find a vey rough looking individual waiting for him out in the hallway.
“This opium den is not too far away from here, is it, Wiggins?” Sherlock showed Wiggins the vial.
Lestrade’s superior stopped right in front of him, obscuring his view of the damage wrought by the bombing. The house had been recently built but its expert craftmanship had saved the rest of the house from total collapse. Also, both the judge and his wife had been on holiday when the explosion had occurred and their servants had also been out as a result.
As he read John’s detailed description of the event, which included a few words from Sherlock, Moriarty tossed the newspaper across the desk. He seethed; based on his observations, it would be difficult not to be detected by Sherlock and his capacity to insert himself in anything and anywhere necessary.
When John gets back, Mycroft doesn't look at the supplies, he just watches as John sits down in front of him and takes Mycrofts cock in hand. “You know I love you and I also love this beautiful dick. But I also love to torture it” Mycroft shudders at that. John leans in and tongues Mycroft's slit slow and teasingly. “Mmmm you taste so good” John wraps his hand over Mycrofts hard dick and pulls it slowly, rubbing his thumb over the head from time to time. Mycroft is hard, he aches, he loves that it hurts a bit too, John is not using any lubricant and Mycroft is already a bit chafed from humping the cushion earlier. John starts to rub his finger over the exposed head, again and again. At the beginning it feels good, than it becomes a burning sensation. “Lets take this a bit further. I know how you like it, when I hurt this sensitive dick for you.” John grabs a dry wash cloth, he has brought with him and wraps it around Mycroft's dick. It's not exactly rough but it burns like hell, when John starts to wank him with it. Mycroft, puts his hands on Johns shoulders and stares at his own dick, which is still hard. “Ohh, please, it hurts, please not, please John...., ohhhh.” Mycroft is sobbing, but he doesn't pull away. “I have one last special item for you, Mycroft”, John says. The moment, Mycroft sees what it is he trys to step back, out of Johns reach. “Come on Mycroft, I know you can do it and more important I know you want it” Mycroft nods and steps back into Johns reach, who wraps the wash cloth back around his cock and exposes the head. Then he takes the toothbrush, and presses it to the sensitive flesh there. It is a toothbrush with soft bristle but it hurts like hell, when John starts to rub with it over the head in circles and repeatedly presses it into his slit. Mycroft can't hold back the tears know, as he looks at his bruised member.
Detective Baynes grinned at John which made the latter recoil from how unsettling the former’s expression was. The detective stood halfway out between the hallway and the room. “Guards! This prisoner is ready to be escorted.”
Sherlock nodded, but it was clear that he was still ruminating over the presence of the member of parliament. Eventually, John figured it was no use to try to get his companion to relax.
Moriarty sighed with relief as he sauntered over to his desk on the far end of his lavish office, one of the few typically reserved for only the most senior and respected of faculty members at the university. He tossed his lecture papers onto his desk before walking over to a tea cart where one of his research assistants had already began brewing him some tea.
“What in the world?” John said out loud as he sat up in the bed before letting out a cry brought on from the aches and pains from the night before. John clinched his eyes shut as he slowly reminded himself that he was in the guestroom of Mycroft’s estate and not at Baker Street.
“I have quite the reputation.” Was all Fedorov answered with.
“Thank you for your quickness. We had an unfortunate accident early this evening…” Sherlock had the police follow him to the dining room where they found Standish.
John ran toward the scuffle, grabbing Gladstone by the collar before running down the stairs and out of the factory. As he reached the outside, John could hear the man shouting for help. John put Gladstone down on the ground, quickly scanning the area for any sign of Sherlock, but he panicked again as he hurriedly searched the area; he couldn’t see Sherlock anywhere near the factory.
Singapore.”
. John groaned to himself as he held an increasingly excited Gladstone. John tried to shush Gladstone one more time, but the dog broke away, barking excitedly.
“Fine, but I’m not happy about this.” John wagged a finger at Sherlock before opening the door.
Mycroft hummed to himself. “Not surprising that Basil Whitehall managed to survive censure by his colleagues. Was there any doubt he would lose his popular stand—”
“Watson.” John heard Sherlock call again, but he was unable to answer. He lingered before slowly turning his head to face Sherlock who expression remained grave; John had never seen his companion look so serious before and it frightened him.
He reminded himself of his task before taking his time opening his office door out into the hallway.
Everyone murmured to one another before shuffling into the back parlor. John sighed again as he joined Sherlock at the window.
A man slapped Schuller hard on the shoulder to force the latter down into a chair. Down in the dank and damp cellar below the university, the chemist had been pacing wildly as he and two other men waited for orders.
Schuller nodding slowly; he was holding a test tube in one hand and a notepad in the other. Moriarty walked forward, finding a chair to position in front of Schuller. He dusted off the seat before sitting down in a huff from how poorly kept the room Schuller was working in appeared.
“Every single file in this safe is evidence for your case, Watson. Someone’s been sending the judge tampered evidence.”
James nodded slowly as he sat down next to his father. “Everything’s fine, father. The client requested a meeting with you, but I told him you were busy until next week.”
Moriarty packed up his lecture materials, trying to leave the dais as quickly as possible but a few of his students managed to catch up with him, follow him out into the hallway, and to his office. Moriarty fielded a few questions before he escaped into his office, shutting the door on one student who persisted on discussing his last paper.
Mycroft chuckled loudly before motioning for them to follow him inside. John and Sherlock dragged their luggage through the front door as Mycroft continued to chat mostly to himself.
Mary nodded timidly as she joined Sherlock in the middle of the space. She looked around before sighing to herself.
“No time to explain!” Sherlock came up from behind John to push him out of the sitting room, down the stairs and outside their building. They found a hansom already waiting for them.
John watched Sherlock struggle to lie down on the sofa without expressing his aches and pains.
“Holmes!” John called before covering his face again, “what on earth are you cooking?”
“Sherly.” Mycroft jumped into the hansom right after Sherlock as the latter gave the address to their intended destination.
“At the event,” Moriarty started up again, “you must show that you’re the best person to save the soul of the country. Possibly the world.”
“Assume the position, Mycroft. You practically begged me with your eyes to let you come. Be careful what you wish for.”
The Doctor pushed himself in the willing body, and shoved his hand between mattress and Sherlock’s body to grab his cock. It was hard, hot and pulsing under his fingers. After a few pulls Sherlock came hard. His orgasms triggered Johns instantly and he shot his load in the warm waiting body, making Sherlock whimper. The doctor pulled out. Sherlock winced a bit.
John brushed over the little puckered hole, repeatedly, before pushing one finger in. Sherlock whimpered. He didn’t know what to think. It was exactly what he wanted, and Myc was holding him, but he was afraid. He knew it would hurt. Would it be bearable?
After spending the afternoon wandering around London, Sherlock broke in as he always did when visiting Lestrade. However, to his surprise, he didn’t get the usual exasperated look, for ignoring the doorbell – again -. Instead a little bundle with fine brown hair was shoved into his arms, and a hectic Lestrade told him: “Just look after her for a minute, the bloody soup is scorching already” and with that he vanished in the direction of the kitchen. Sherlock looked down into big brown eyes observing him with interest. Oh, this little ten-month-old girl has to be Annabel Lestrade. Otherwise known as the last attempt to fix the relationship between Lestrade and his cheating wife. As always in these situations you can’t mend what is irreparable and the Ex moved to France with a 30 year old carpenter, and left little Annie with her father. He completely forgot that Lestrade has been a single dad for quite some time know. In retrospect, the dark circles under his eyes and the exhausted look on his face made actually sense.
A muttered “Good morning, love” had the desired effect. Mycroft still wasn’t used to endearments and a blushing Holmes was a sight to behold.
Halfway into his musings Lestrade came back, took his daughter and gave him a bowl with vegetable soup.  “Eat Sherlock, I don’t have the nerves to coax food into two kids.” The warm soup actually tasted quite good and Sherlock watched as Greg fed his daughter spoon after spoon.
“I bet you want that too, do you? Having a warm mouth sucking at your dick. You’d be probably content with a warm hand around it. Nevertheless, you won’t get it, your cock is useless, unable to get hard, just a limp piece of meat hanging between your thighs right now. And look how hard you try.”
At that, Mycroft whimpers. John tugs him down, and kisses him. He is dominating the kiss, plundering Mycroft’s mouth. Mycroft is giving, he is graving this, he loves to submit himself to John.
Mycroft, leans a bit forward to do as he is told, as he can feel one finger slowly penetrating him. The finger is pulled out, then replaced with two circling his rim, then pushing inside again. Mycroft thought what he must look like to John, eagerly lapping on one man's cock while trying to fuck himself on the fingers of some other men. One of them grips Mycroft's hard dick.
His brother tried to escape. This earned him a sharp slap on his upper thighs, and a stronger grip on his sensitive cock. Mycroft started whimpering. “Please Sir stop it! I can’t ……”
This chapter is no plot and pure smut. Be aware of the new tags. Don't be mad at me, if it's not up to the usual standard, i wrote it in a rush.
John lubed the stimulator quickly. The wand was so slim, he could push it into Mycroft without any preparation. The Doctor made sure that it was exactly at the right spot, and flipped it on.
The man in front of him lets him go and Mycroft hangs his head, while he feels the men coming into him. After a few seconds the man behind him pulls out, and Mycroft feels empty. The two men looking at his twitching open hole, one of them feeling the rim and pushing some of the leaking come back in. The one on his side, gives Mycroft's dick a few slaps. “Look how hard this poor puppy is, should we let him come?”
John gets up again, to stand in front of Mycroft. He takes his caged cock possessively in hand. He can feel the warm soft skin, under the hard metal. “Do you like that, Mycroft? Do you like it when I hold your useless cock in my hand? I am not sure if I’m inclined to let you come anytime soon.”
To his surprise, Sherlock did just that. It was another gruesome case involving kids. Usually he shuts himself down emotionally in order to concentrate on solving the case. He had never had a problem doing this hence his self-diagnosed sociopathy. The difficulty was that he couldn’t do it anymore. Since his last visit, two things had changed dramatically. First, he remembered that as a child he had feelings. Feelings of happiness, sadness, and all things between. He remembered that he liked to be touched, to be cuddled, to be held. Second was that he couldn’t sleep anymore, even less so than on normal nights. He was aroused constantly. A problem he haven’t had since he was a teen. The lack of sleep in combination with all the sudden changes in body and mind were too much. He didn’t understand what was happening with him and that triggered the panic-attack.
Greg takes the clothing out of Sherlocks arms and tips his chin up with his right hand. He looks into these beautiful but unsure eyes.
“Yes I want John in me, I want to belong to him, I want to be taken by him, I’m sure”
Mycroft is trying to get away from the pain. It is unbearable. “Please, please, I’m sorry I moved, but please don’t hit me there again” begged Mycroft.
Sherlock pressed his face in the warm jumper. He didn’t know what happened. Firstly he hadn’t thought this was something a professional dom would do at all. This was so vanilla. On the other hand, John was right. During his time here, he hadn’t thought over the case, the drugs or anything at all. He just let everything happen. And now he was lying here warm and safe ins Johns arms. His spent cock in his wet trousers pressed against Johns leg. It felt just perfect.
With that, Greg crawls back under the covers, holding one end up for Sherlock to join him. Sherlock looks unsure, but follows him and lays down on his back next to Lestrade, staring at the ceiling.
“Okay, let me get some supplies. You go and stand naked in front of the bed. I'll be back in a tick.”
John loves watching as Mycroft lowers himself on his cock. The look of concentration on his face, when he pushes himself down, the flicker of pain and then the utter bliss when fully seated.
“Mycroft, get naked and bring me the key”
Mycroft seeks out Johns gaze. “Please, Sir?”
Instead of lying on the floor, Mycroft is lying on his stomach on the bed, his head resting on John’s chest. John has one hand in Mycroft’s hair the other one holds Mycroft’s uncaged soft cock securely.
In the following years, Sherlock developed to the man lying on his couch. His appearance changed dramatically. The gangly kid became a lean, but strong man. The hoodie and tracksuit bottoms changed into suits, too tight shirts and a showy coat. The man was rude and arrogant. God help him but Greg feared he was attracted to that, too. While he had discovered some bodily reactions to the attitude both Holmses where showing, he still felt the need to care for the younger one and look out for him.
“Don’t hide from me. I want to hear every sound. I like to hear it when I do things to you. I also want to watch you twitch, to pant, to come. You look so beautiful like this. Look in the mirror next to the door; look at how gorgeous you are like this. Can you feel what you do to me, can you feel how hard I am for you” Then John heard a shocked gasp.
After Sherlock’s concerned look. John asked: “Do you want to safeword?”
Sherlock threw the phone at the wall. Fuck Mycroft and his bloody cams. Then after a short amount of rethinking his actions, he went over to the fireplace and picked up the card that lay besides the skull. He read the name on the card again. “John Watson”, could anybody think of a more common and more boring name? Despite his thoughts he called the number on it.
“Move! Fuck yourself on my dick, work for it boy!” Orders John.
Sherlock stared in Mycroft’s face. Thought of all the times they had quarrelled and how his brother had hurt him by leaving him. He thought that he desperately wanted him here, he wanted to be looked after by his big brother.
“Get to the bedroom, I’ll be with you in a few seconds” Mycroft turns around and leaves in the direction of the bedroom. John just grabs a nice pink but plug, and his special set of keys before following him.
John gets between Mycrofts legs, his fingers caressing his thighs. “Come on, relax for me” John says and begins to push the pink plug inside.
John is kneeling in front of him, bracketing Mycroft’s face in his hands. “My, look at me. You did very well. I’m proud of you. However, I am sure that you can stand this last hit. You will do it for me. Go back into position, now.”
Sherlock insulted Anderson one last time on his way out of the Yard. Donovan just directed a disgusted look at him, before looking back at one of the kids she was comforting in her arms. She blamed it on him, that it took them two days to find the abducted twins. She accused him of not working hard enough, because apparently a simple abduction wasn’t interesting enough for a sociopath.
In the end, his consideration didn’t matter at all. Because, when Mycroft Holmes asks you to do something, it isn’t optional.
“Mycroft, hold still and spread your legs a bit more, to get me a better aim. I will hit your balls three times. I will hit hard. Feel free to scream as loud as you like, you know this flat is soundproofed. But you will not move. Did you understand this boy?”
The men in front of him, grabs the back of his head and presses him face first to his jeans clad crotch. “I want you to take a sniff, isn't that what dogs do?
Mycroft looks down at his half hard cock and nods his head, he wants to know what cruel things John has thought about for him.
Greg moans as these beautiful lips stretch over his dick. He never thought the day would come when he could push his throbbing cock into the brilliant mouth of Sherlock Holmes. Greg reaches down to grip a handful of the silky locks, holds him there to thrust deep into his throat. The resulting retching, doesn’t sound quite right, however. Greg wakes up abruptly and senses a lot of things at once.
“To be honest, I’m quite nervous about today”
“No, I want you to lay down on the Sofa, on your back, with your head in my lap.”
“Look at your beautiful brother, Sherlock. That is not unusual, when he has been locked away for long enough. And he is so beautiful sensitive, afterwards. Let me show you”
John wields the crop again and hits him hard. Mycroft screams at the impact. John let him get his breath back under control until he hits him a second time. Mycroft screams again and tries to scramble away.
The man in front of him takes this as a hint and shoves his cock deep into Mycroft's mouth. His eyes watering at this sudden intrusion, blocking his airway. At the same time one of the men behind him, lines his bare cock up with his hole and pushes in, steady and relentless. Mycroft is filled on both sides, he can't breath and his mind is calm. It's nothing he can do, besides letting them use him in any way they want. The cock in his mouth pulls out for a bit, letting him breath for a few moments before pushing back in and fucking his mouth in earnest. The cock he is impaled on, also setting a punishing rhythm, and pushing him forward with each thrust.
“What did he tell you?”
“Should we reschedule our plans for today? We could, you know.”
Mycroft does as he is told, he fingers himself first with one, than with three fingers. He carefully gets up, straddles John’s thighs and lowers himself on his big cock. He loves it. The stretch of his hole, the burning sensation intensified through the fast preparation.
I Love you all
“Sherlock is it ok for you, to have your brother here? He is going to look out for you.”
“Let us concentrate on us. How are you Mycroft?” He presses the lean man to him, luxuriating in the smell of the man and the feeling of the expansive clothes under his hands.
The Doctor nodded. He prepared Sherlock as gently as possible. John had to force himself to go slowly as he entered Sherlock for the first time. His own long neglected cock would prefer a much more forceful encounter.
Mycroft shook his head, at the same time as the first tears were dropping down on the blankets.
As he re-entered his living room, the empty bowl was standing on the floor and a softly snoring detective was occupying his couch. Lestrade spread a blanket over the sleeping person and gave into the impulse to ruffle through the dark curls on Sherlock’s head. Afterwards he snapped a picture and attached it to a short message to Mr. Holmes.
John looks at Mycroft, who is shivering with anticipation. He is on all fours besides his chair, with Johns right hand resting on the small of his back. Getting him ready had aroused them both. Mycroft is naked, but wearing a black leather hood which has only one opening for his mouth. They cant risk anyone recognizing him, so the hood stays on all the time and Mycroft isn't allowed to talk.
“Sherlock, I don’t know who told you differently, but you are gorgeous. Come here, kneel on the bed, and face the door.” John got around the bed and looked at Sherlock, spine rigid and unsure how to behave in this situation. The doctor got on the bed and knelt directly behind the detective. He put his hand on Sherlock’s chest and pulled him to his chest. Sherlock was sitting practically on Johns lap now, his thighs bracketing Johns and his back pressed to the Doctors front. John kissed Sherlock’s shoulder, and caressed his belly with one hand. The hand wandered downward and grabbed his cook, for slow perfect pulls. Sherlock tried to supress a moan.
Sherlock sucked in a breath, and stopped himself from the urge to cover himself up. He knew he was bony and gangly, and as he was informed just his mouth wasn’t as repulsive that a man couldn’t stuff his cock inside. But John looked at him with warm appreciation. John caressed his stomach and started to kiss him again. With that, all thoughts of former encounters simply vanished. Johns hands were warm and playfully petted his rips, before wandering upwards and started lightly teasing his nipples. With that Sherlock whimpered in Johns mouth. John cupped him through his trousers. Only now Sherlock realised that he was painfully hard.
John circles Mycroft slowly, spreading his knees a bit more. He likes to watch him, like this. John takes the riding crop in hand and stands in front of Mycroft.
“I am going to make you a cup of tea” announced John before he got up and left in direction of the kitchen. He wondered what could have worked the detective up so much to trigger a panic attack, while putting a generous amount of sugar in the tea.
Sherlock woke up slowly. He was lying on a warm cuddly cushion and felt oddly relaxed for the first time in weeks. After blinking one eye open he froze completely. He wasn’t lying on a cushion, he was lying on a chest, a naked chest, the naked chest of his brother.
Mycroft blushes all over, he new they would love that. To see him, humping a cushion on the ground. It couldn't get much more humiliating than that. He hears someone placing something under him. Then the man in front of him tells him. “If you want to come, go for it” Mycroft spreads his legs as wide as he could, to get near enough to the ground, for his cock to come into contact with the cushion. He tries to rub his aching cock over the ornate fabric, but every time he pushes, the cushion slips away. He tries to put a bit more weight on it, but the result is the same. The men are laughing at his more and more desperate tries to humping the cushion. One of the men eventually steadies the cushion with a foot, to make it at least doable. Mycroft rubs his cock over the fabric. Precome making it wet. He doesn't want to imagine what he looks like. He could feel a bit of the semen the man put in him leaking from his hole as he desperately tries to reach orgasm. Hi is making little moans and whimpers with each thrust against this pillow. It's chafing his sensitive dick, but it is a good hurt. He gets a bit louder at the end, and he is shuddering through his orgasm.
John let his fingers trail over the seam of his lips, before bending over and kissing the corner of his mouth very lightly. He kissed the full lips of the slightly open mouth. Sherlocks breath was stuttering with this very simple ministration. John licked lightly at the seams of Sherlocks lips, till he could feel the shy touch of Sherlocks responding tongue. John let himself sink into the kiss. Sherlocks warm mouth tasted fantastic, and he was so responsive, just like his brother. John let his hand wander over the lean column of Sherlocks neck, down over his ribcage to loose Sherlocks dark purple shirt out of his trousers. Sherlocks skin under his shirt was burning hot. John undid the buttons and let the shirt fall open.
Mycroft shuddered at that and let out a raspy moan. Sherlock turned to the other nipple, treating it in the same way and latching on as he did yesterday. Mycroft’s hands holding Sherlock there, carding through his dark locks.
Mycroft hears them coming. According to the sound of the steps there has to be three men. A short knock on the door, then John gets up to open it. John greets them in his usual friendly fashion and offers them drinks. After everyone got a beer, two of them sit down on the couch, the other takes the chair which is not occupied by John. He can feel their gazes on him, as he hears John saying. “ You can use him as you like, I just sit here and watch. I will tell you if something is not on..”
“Just come here, Sherlock” Greg pets the free space on the bed beside him. He looks so fucking vulnerable as he sits there on the bed, still clutching his clothing to his chest. Sherlock actually jerks away as Greg lays one hand on his back. His spine is too pronounced at his too thin body, but that is not the foremost problem Greg is facing right now.
Sherlock stood at the bedroom door and watched his brother and John sharing breakfast. This was everything he had looked for. Someone caring for him, someone laughing with him, someone smiling with him. However, everyone he had thought cared for him eventually left. He didn’t want to come between them and he also didn’t want their pity.
Mycroft scrambles back in position, the stiffness in his spine clearly visible. He takes a deep breath and braces himself for the hit. John hits his balls hard but kneels down immediately and lays a soothing hand down on Mycroft’s lower back.
“Let’s get this started. I want you on all fours, here on the living room floor, Mycroft. I’ll get everything I need and I want you in position by the time I come back.”
To date Greg didn’t forget his surprise in hearing that dark voice, and the split second in which his mind wasn’t quite sure about his decision. In the end he did the right thing, arrested Sherlock and had the questionable pleasure to meet the second Holmes within an hour. All charges against Sherlock vanished mysteriously and he was brought to a probably very expansive and very discreet rehab centre.
Greg had put Annie in her bed. For once the little girl slept almost instantly. Lets hope I have the same luck with my next task, thought Greg. He had to find out why Sherlock had appeared on his doorstep or rather in his living room, looking quite forlorn and not even pestering him for cases.
Mycroft is totally exposed, in this position he is absolutely vulnerable and they can see all. The men in front of him pets his belly, and rubs at his nipples. “What a good puppy you are. I love to fuck my puppies when they are all spent and pliant. With that he thrusts his big cock in Mycroft's already fucked hole and pounds him in a steady rhythm. “Mhh, you feel so good, your are already so wet inside, do you like it when I use your hole like this?” Each thrust found Mycroft's prostate and he squirmed with the overstimulation. “I especially love, to see your flaccid cock, flapping around with a good pounding.” Mycroft whimpers with every thrust, his body couldn't take much more. The men empties himself into him with a big groan. As he pulls out, Mycroft can feel his hole open and leaking.
“ I don’t understand…. I mean why….why don’t y…”
Greg woke from a sobbing sound transmitted by the baby monitor. Anny had been particular grumpy during the last few days and especially during the nights. He expects to see her very first tooth, very soon. On his way to her room, he can see Sherlock is still sleeping on his couch. After caring for his little girl and persuading her to fall asleep again, he stops in the living room to look at the detective occupying his old battered leather couch.  He can’t help it, but compare this man to the gangly kid he found during a drug raid.
“I want you to remember one thing tonight. You are allowed to come as often as you want, when our guests are here. However, I have a little surprise for you afterwards. I plan to do some not so nice things to this beautiful red cock. You probably doesn’t want to be too sore for that already.”
“Shit, come in”. John grabbed his arm, manoeuvred him through the sitting room and pushed him gently in the chair.
John knew instantly that this was new for Sherlock, he was so fucking tight. He shot a look at Mycroft who understood. “Is this what you really want, little one?” Mycroft asked Sherlock.
Sherlock lets his finger glide over the chest in front of him. He marvelled at that. Feeling the soft, pale skin of his brother under his fingers, the few chest hair, letting his fingers run over a pale pink nipple, he heard a gasp. His brothers pupils were fully dilated, just from this. Carefully, he licked at one nipple with the tip of his tongue. He played with the little nub, and bit it playfully.
John sits back on one of the armchairs and watches Mycroft strip. He likes the way Mycroft divests himself of his clothing. Every article of clothing is folded meticulously. Mycroft doesn’t like his looks at all, but John is very fond of every detail of it. The long lightly muscled legs, the pale freckled skin, the small red nipples, the light reddish hair, the soft belly, the beautifully caged cock. Oh Yes, this body is his, to worship, to possess, to love, to hurt, to mark, to own. Mycroft gave himself to John over 2 years ago. It is his Job to care for him, to take him to pieces and to put him back together. The last step was the custom-made cock cage; Mycroft is wearing for 6 month now. It was Mycroft’s decision to give him the responsibility over his cock and his orgasms. John is the only key holder to Mycroft’s cage, and only he decides if Mycroft is allowed to come, or left desperate, or being milked.
“Sherlock, come on I want you to lie down on your front, with your head on Mycroft’s chest” Sherlock crawled between Mycroft’s legs and lowered himself on his brother, laying his head on his brother’s naked chest. Mycroft smelled like home, even after all this years.
“ Shhhh Sherlock, calm down, this is exactly the reason you are here. This is for you to stop thinking, stop deducing what’s going to happen next, stop being responsible for anything that happens. Everything that happens here will so because I want it, because I decided that it is something you need. In this flat you are my responsibility. I’m going to care for you.”
“I think it is time for an affirmation, of what you have been told” John sat up against the headboard. “Go on, Sherlock! Caress your brother. And look at him this time, look what you do to him!”
With that, John turns around and makes himself comfortable in his chair. He watches when Mycroft comes into the living room, with two cups in hand. He looks striking, in his prim suit, with his hard cock hanging out, and an already flushed face.
“Oh my dirty boy. You love it, don’t you? You love that I can order you to do that. I tell you to let your cock hang out for me to see and you go hard like the slut you are. It’s humiliating to walk around like this and knowing that I can touch or hurt you, at any time, but you love it anyway, don’t you? Come here”
Sherlock gets out from under Mycroft and watches his brother, who just came but is still hard.
When John comes back, he takes in the scene in front of him. Mycroft is on the floor like requested, head hanging down between his shoulders, beautifully bare and awaiting what would come.
The doorbell was followed by impatient knocking. When John opened the door, his eyes met an agitated Sherlock. He was sweating, a panic-fuelled gaze wandered over his face and he seemed to have difficulties in breathing.
Three month later Greg was contacted by the slightly intimidating Mycroft Holmes. He was asked to let Sherlock help him, as an incentive for him to stay clean in return. Greg didn’t really knew what he should think about that. He just wanted to forget the boy with the unusual features, and tempting big eyes. He was totally aware of the fact, that the attraction he felt for that young boy was more than a bit not good. In addition, since meeting the boy only for a few hours, he felt the urge to somehow care for him.
Greg really doesn’t know what to say. Of course, he had these fantasies. There were times, when the consulting detective was at his arrogant and cocky best, he’d very much like to shove him over the next table, pull down his expansive trousers and fuck him into submission. But that doesn’t stop him from caring for Sherlock. And just now, with this insecure and vulnerable man beside him, nothing is further from his mind. He isn’t sure what he is angrier about. Is it the fact, that Sherlock thought so low of him to assume he would only be there for him, if he would be sexually available? Or is he really angry at the person who made Sherlock think so low of himself, who made this brilliant man believe nobody could be interested in him as a person.
`He is unsure if he is allowed to do this, to ask for touch, to seek closeness´ thought John in astonishment. He smiled at Sherlock and took his free hand in his own. “Tell, me” was the only thing he said.
The one on the chair, tells him. “Come here, boy. Let us have a good look at you.” Mycroft knows he is not allowed to stand, so he crawls forward until he is in front of the chair. He shivers as he feels the man cupping his chin and rubbing his thumb over his lips. One of the others, lets his hand trail over his back, stroking up and down, then giving him a short slap on his buttock. Mycroft feels exposed, he doesn't like his looks and they get to inspect him thoroughly.
Mycroft looked up surprised when Sherlock just went for the door. “I’m going on a case”, was all they could hear before the door banged shut. John also swallowed his mouthful of tea and looked a bit bewildered. “Do you think he is okay?” asked John. “I’m going to increase my brothers’ surveillance, and then we will see.” , answered Mycroft already tipping on his smartphone.
John is thinking fast, his plan was for Mycroft to turn around, and torture his nipples, his soft belly and his caged cock with the riding crop. His Mycroft loves pain but he thinks that today it is enough of the crop.
John pushes Mycroft of his cock and looks fascinated as his cum drips from his used red hole and down his thighs. He uses his thumb to push some of it back inside
John pulled the stimulator out carefully, and put it on the bedside table for later cleaning. He opened his arms for a befuddled looking Sherlock and arranged themselves to lie down at Mycroft’s side. He put the blanket over themselves and the now sleeping Mycroft and let the younger man cuddle into him.
“Dear Brother mine”
“What do you want Mycroft?”
John is amazed of Mycroft, he is panting and shivering all over, he is crying and sobbing. However, he hasn’t tried to move once. He looks so good with all the red marks over him, he probably loved the ones on his thighs the most.
To Mycroft's astonishment, he hears John say. “Actually you guys gave me some ideas, do you want to hear them?” They probably nodded to that, because John continues: ”You already made him, your little doggy. Let him get off, like a horny dog would do. Throw him one of this cushion rolls of the couch on the ground. Lets see if he can get off like a horny dog by humping it”.
John was waiting for Mycroft, when he came home at four o clock as agreed upon.
Sherlock could see, that Mycroft struggled to keep himself on all four. But John kept the toy inside his brother buzzing cruelly. He put his hand on Mycroft’s soft cock, and started to wank him, steadily.
Sherlock had been wearing old tracksuit bottoms and a hoodie, his curls were dull and his cheeks were bruised. Despite the split lip and the fact that he was obviously shivering with withdrawal, his eyes quickly evaluated the situation at hand. He looked at him, calculating his options and then turned on the shabby mattress and crawled towards him.
The next time Sherlock woke, he was alone in bed. As he turned around to press his nose in the already cold pillow, he could hear low voices through the ajar door. Sherlock put on his pants, which he found on a chair beside the bed and peeked through the door. John and Mycroft sat at the kitchen table eating breakfast. John wore jeans and a frankly horrible oatmeal jumper, his brother was in one of his three-piece suits. What really stopped him from entering the room were their faces. He couldn’t even recall the last time, he had seen his brother this carefree. John said something to Mycroft with a soft smile on his face and Mycroft actually chuckled before biting in his toast. This little scene in front of Sherlock was like an epiphany. This was in no way a professional relationship between a sub and a dom, this was real affection and a very real relationship.
“Oh, it looks like this little doggy likes it to have something in his needy hole. Go on, give him what he really wants”
“What the fuck, Sherlock”, Greg presses out as he simultaneously tries to scramble into a more upright position and to cover himself up with the blanket. “Are you fucking mad? You can’t just come in here and…”
The first big surprise came, after handing Sherlock his tea and sitting himself on the couch. He just thought about the best way of asking what actually had happened, as Sherlock got up and sat himself next to John on the couch. Their thighs were pressing against each other and Sherlock locked at him for a second with a strange expression on his beautiful face.
“I think we can do better, then that.” says Greg “Come here”.
“Good boy”, John purrs. Sherlock can see the slight blush on Mycrofts face. John takes the key from Mycroft’s hands and begins to unlock him. In the moment the older brothers cock is free, it gets hard instantly.
Only now Sherlock remembered how fast and obedient Mycroft had followed Johns requests yesterday, his eyes getting bigger and bigger, as Mycroft returns fully naked, but for a metal cock cage and kneels in front of John.
After a few moments, John started to move out until only the head remained in Sherlock’s body, then pushing inside again. Sherlock’s moans got louder and louder, as John’s movements picked up speed.
I'm not so happy with this one. But at least it is another chapter.
"Not yet, you loved it, to let them watch you humping that cushion, didn't you? I want a private show. Get down on your knees. I let you hump my leg. We wont stop, before you reached orgasm."
John looked at the man in his lap. Sherlock was absolutely breath taking, his sweat soaked curls hanging in his face, the red well kissed lips open and panting. He rubbed him through his orgasm, feeling the wetness soaking through the trousers. Sherlock looked utterly debauched.
Mycroft got on all fours and crawled in the middle of the bed. He closed his eyes, he knew Johns way of thinking and was nearly 98% sure, what he was in for. His whole body shuddered he couldn’t wait for the anticipated agony he was sure to come.
Sherlock just blinked a few times, this needed processing. He rearranged his body in the requested position, but his mind was screaming at him. What did John want to do to him in this position, why wasn’t he acting like predicted? He couldn’t stop himself, he had to know…
“Sherlock, talk to me. Why, did……”
Mycroft inhales deeply and can smell and feel the arousal of the man. Tentatively he puts his tongue out, and laps at the hard bulge he can feel trough the jeans. At the same time he can feel the hands of the others all over his body, petting, probing. One of them is parting his cheeks, and looks at his hole.
Greg isn’t sure he understands, what is happening at the moment, but he knows he can’t let his friend leave now. Sherlock is kind of frozen midway between bed and door, his shoulders are slumped, but he doesn’t turn around.
Greg rubs his head to disengage himself from his musing, and steps to the couch to pick up the blanket, which has fallen to the ground. He spreads the blanket over the sleeping detective, and can’t resist the temptation to let his fingers trail over one cheekbone.
“No I don’t think so, John. He is with Detective Inspector Lestrade. I think Sherlock is in no immediate danger at the moment.” The scene they wanted to do today, was the result of weeks of planning. The right people had to be chosen. Then they had to do a security check on them, which was realised, very thoroughly, by Anthea. And last but not least, any of them needed an absolutely clean state of health.
“Ok, Mycroft. I want you to leave your shoes over there. Then I want you to open your shirt, but leave it on. Get on the bed and lay down on your back, spread your legs” Sherlock watched fascinated as Mycroft did exactly as he was told.
“Let me tell you a secret Sherlock, your brother is a bit of a pain slut, who revels in getting used. Isn’t that the case slut?”
I'm really sorry, that it took so long, but real life was interfering.
They don't let him come down. The man who previously fucked his mouth. Pulls him up unto the couch. Mycroft is arranged on his back, head in the lap of the third man. The man who pulled him up, instructs him to spread his legs and holding himself open at the back of his knees.
After John had showered and towelled him dry. He asks him if he still wanted him to do, what he had indicated.
The blanket gave Sherlock hope; maybe Victor still cared for him. Therefore, he got to his feet and stumbled into the kitchen. First he washed the soil off his face at the sink. Then he started to make breakfast for them. After the toast was ready, he heard the bedroom door opening. Sherlock turned around with a hopeful smile on his face. “Good morning, I made us breakfast.” Victor stared at him for about 10 seconds and then started to laugh loudly at him. “You don’t really think I would eat breakfast with a filthy slut like you? And by the way you shouldn’t eat either, if you become fat in addition to your ugly face, nobody will even want to fuck your dirty mouth.” In hindsight, this was the breaking point. It took three more month, until a young Lestrade found him in an abandoned house during a drug raid.
That is what John loves about Mycroft. No one else is allowed to see him like this. No one but him. Everyone only gets to know, the public persona, the man who has the power to start or end wars, the iceman.
His thoughts went back to a different kitchen years ago. He woke up on the floor in front of the couch. His throat raw and dried semen on his face. Somebody had thrown an old blanket over him. Maybe Victor didn’t want him to get cold. Victor had been so nice at the beginning. He told him sweet things and smiled a lot at him. Then he coaxed him to try cocaine. By the time he was hooked on it, Victor cut him off. When Sherlock was quite desperate and begged Victor for just a bit of the drug, he told him in a cold voice, that maybe one of Victor’s customers would spent some on him if he would be nice to them. This was how Sherlock became some kind of commercial gimmick. The wealthy ones of Victor’s buyers could get an additional blow job from the thin boy with the dark locks for just a bit of cocaine.
John brought Sherlock back to him and dipped them both low, "Really John how clichéd are we being-" but he never did finish that sentence because John's lips were taking every word.
Mycroft would be ecstatic, he'd have a whole new range of artillery to fire about Sherlock not being a man, and how could he be so quaint. Ugh. He'd tell mummy on top of everything else and subject both him and John to at least two night of intense irritation. They were having this conversation before Mycroft showed up again because the one thing Sherlock would not be able to endure was the smug look on his face. This was going to be very uncomfortable.
"Try not to do something like that without me again. I... worry." John admitted softly into the dark sitting room, already lulling Sherlock to sleep with his hands.
Lestrade nodded his agreement “It’s to Pentonville and then abed with me, Dr Watson, this business has taken enough of the night. I assume we’ll be seeing this one in the Strand?”
Outside, the snow still fell, their hearts fell together, and quiet reigned supreme.
It was John's song. He swallowed deeply and lifted his bow. The melody flowed out with ease, soft at first, low, melancholy notes building to a crescendo that was John all over.
When he replies, John sounds fierce, and certain of the truth in his words.
. Your idiotic peers may fall for that tripe but I am not about to. Spare me your platitudes and run along, I'm sure you're
Greg groaned loudly into a soggy pillow. His head was throbbing, pain pulsing and rising with the beat of his heart. To top off the headache, his stomach was a bit iffy and his mouth was about as dry as a towel. He opened one eye and looked down to find himself fully clothed thankfully as the bed he was in was definitely not Mycroft's. Slowly so as not to exacerbate his head he rolled onto his back and breathed a sigh of relief, John Watson truly was a saint. A quick glance at the clock showed it was only 7am and he rolled out of bed and trundled downstairs to find the apartment silent, and the coats of it's owners gone. He sighed and shook his head, wincing when the throbbing intensified "Bloody Holmes's." he cursed a bit before shuffling into the shower and turning it up high. God he felt horrific. What had he been thinking last night, drinking himself into a stupor. More importantly, what had he been saying!? Try though he might, his memory only allowed for patches of his conversation to come back to him, but he was relatively positive that he'd told John (and by extension Lucia, Mycroft's ever watchful assistant) that he loved Mycroft before he even told him that.
And yet. There was that pesky ray of hope every time Sherlock prolonged his gaze, or crowded against John when there was space enough for them both to have lots of it. Always John's heart would be in his mouth and then Sherlock would turn away, or the crowding was just his complete lack of respect for personal space. Still, John was secure in the knowledge that after last night Sherlock was not in any way, shape or form feeling the same. Secure was a bit strong. A bit devastated but willing to soldier on regardless because that's what you do when the people you love are oblivious arseholes who like to crush your hopes of reciprocation in their perfectly shaped hands. Walking wasn't helping that much with that. It was just making him feel bitter actually, watching elderly couples toddle hand in hand to the shop fueled a dozen completely innocent fantasies of future domesticity that would most likely never come to pass.

The slideshow began with photos of both men as children: John in a little rugby kit (his first), Sherlock wearing goggles and a lab coat that was entirely too big, John on his father's shoulders, Sherlock scowling into a scientific journal, John mushing icecream into Harry's face, Sherlock smiling as Mycroft tied his tie for him. It went on in that fashion and people awwwwww'ed and laughed along with it, and Greg's occasional commentary too. The slideshow moved on through their lives: A preteen Sherlock beaming with his arms around a massive redsetter, A teenage John with his arm around a pretty girl and a twinkle in his eye, Sherlock fast asleep on a pile of books, John with a trophy raised above his head and his rugby team all around him, Sherlock carefully dissecting some sort of eye, John grinning through the sleeve of a jumper his mum had knit for him. Sherlock at twenty with a scowl on his face as he sat around for a Christmas picture, John wearing his army fatigues and hugging his parents goodbye, Sherlock looking gaunt through the crack in his door, John with his platoon, Sherlock at a crime scene with Greg at his side, John being awarded his service medals. John and Sherlock walking away from the cabbie case side by side, Sherlock in the deerstalker, Mrs Hudson with her arms around both men on her birthday, John at the pub with Greg, John laughing on the side of the road with his arm around Sherlock as the fire brigade extinguished the apartment, Molly and John frowning at Sherlock as he stares into a microscope, Several of the men in various restaurants, The pictures the police had circulated of them when they'd believed Sherlock was a criminal, Sherlock on horseback, Sherlock asleep on John's chest in the hospital, Christmas with Mummy Holmes, John pressing a kiss to a sleeping Sherlock's forehead, Walking down the street hand in hand, Drinking from graduated cylinders at the stag do, Mycroft, Greg and Sherlock laughing as they sprinted away with a blue French horn in their arms, Sherlock and John scribbling on each other's faces in sharpie, Sherlock glowering that very morning as a competent looking man messed with his hair, John, Molly and Greg with their heads thrown back in laughter and three exasperated hair dressers behind them, John standing at the altar looking nervous, Sherlock comforting his mother in the gazeebo, John winking at the priest, Sherlock walking down the aisle, John leaning in to whisper something to Sherlock with a beaming smile, their rings being slipped on, and finally Sherlock clinging for dear life onto John as he dipped him when they kissed.
This felt too good. His body was riddled with desire, his emotions were a whirlwind inside of him. How could he have thought he could live without John. His home, his partner, his heart.  Once in, he stayed as still as he could, bringing John’s back to his chest again, and slowly beginning to gently move within him, until John moaned. “Go ahead, Sherlock, God, just do it.”

-If you just picked up the phone, it would be great.
“So, does Sherlock know?" Nyla asked. The year would be ending soon and the summer festival performances were shaping up. The solo performers knew their time spots.
DJ saw him immediately, with his black leather pants and a green shirt. They made eye contact, lingering for a while, Sherlock grinned. If John could go on a ‘date’, then so could he. Tonight. Music man started Sherlock off with “Mad Love”(Sean Paul, David Guetta)”, “Familiar” (Liam Payne) then “Sorry, Not Sorry (Demi Lovato). DJ gave it a long intro. Sherlock got into it and danced his perky arse off to it. DJ hooted.
Sherlock started talking: “I told you some of my life in Colombia. I was passing as an up and coming drug dealer. Adrian was the prodigal son of the state’s governor. He was a bohemian who used recreationally. He bought from me and eventually invited me to share his flat. I knew he… was attracted to me. When I made a wrong move, sold stuff I made myself to some blokes I was trying to get information from, I was captured. They thought I was a spy from their rival group. I had no information for them. Obviously, they didn’t believe me. They beat me up, waterboarded me, gave me no food for days. They drugged me. At some point, I slipped and twisted my ankle. I must have favoured it, because from then on they seemed to focus on breaking my foot and stomped on it to insure it was useless. I was so drugged I didn’t feel it. They gave up on me. Luck was on my side and they threw me in a ditch at the garbage yard, unable to move but alive. Once it started to hurt, it turned excruciating. An old man found me and took pity. He called “los gringos”, some american missionaries, who took me to hospital.
*******
Sherlock covered his eyes against the visual of John fucking and holding him on their bed. Almost overwhelmed by the sensations, the sounds, and the smell of the two of them together. He moaned and writhed and shook with blind need. He had to come soon, to finish, or it would all be too much. He wanted to tell John, but his words had abandoned him.
This piqued John’s curiosity, since he hadn’t met anyone from Sherlock’s “Underground Network” yet. Sherlock did not look happy. “Rusty? I thought you left town.”
“Really, John! Without even telling her and worse, letting her think you were getting back with His Highness!! Low, brother.”
Charlie snorted. “I think they’re stalled. In the beginning it seemed like I had lawyers on me all the time. Now when I called my ‘barrister’ to ask him what’s going on, he said he hadn’t had any contact with Lizbeth’s guy. Thing is, I kind of want the whole thing to be over now.”
“Why are you crying John?” Sherlock looked alarmed. “Help me sit up!” he whispered.
-We should definitely catch up, though. It has been a while.
-So you guys drank?
“Yet you came back to rescue me, a washed out war doctor with nothing but the clothes on his back, and a prospect of a job, you feed me and offer to share a flat with me? Do you realise how sad and boring my life has been since I was incapacitated? How good it felt to help you? You said I’m in danger? I tell you, it was about time.” And the two men smiled at each other.
“Oh God, John! All that was true? So are you two... getting along? I like Sherlock, but he’s not very successful with human interactions.” Mike said, a tentative smile on his face.
As always listen along at
John had to move, to get wet rags to clean up, but Sherlock got up into the bathroom and stayed for a long while, the shower running with no one in it. John fought sleep, until he came back to bed. John decided against a shower when Sherlock cuddled against him, little spoon.
“We did. But I knew he would go back to the States and he knew I have my family here.” Sherlock said, wanting the Earth to open and swallow him whole.
“Quite frankly, John, for a romantic your pessimism is worrying. Molly and Wiggins are doing fine, as you should note from the considerably expensive engagement ring. Besides he obviously adores her. She was distracted by trying to keep a secret from me, which only brought it more to my attention, though it is clear as day.”
John looked at him in amazement. “Sherlock?”
The screeches turned into squeals when Rosie noticed the signs on the turn John made. Sherlock turned to ask her what was the matter, and she could only say, “The dogs!! The dogs, Papá, the dooogss!” After everything they had gone through, Sherlock didn’t seem to place the name, but when he did, he turned around to gawk at John. “Murray’s Birthday place? The Huskies, John?" When John nodded yes, Sherlock’s smile was wider than Rosie’s.
-His older son, Todd. Mycroft managed to either charm Lestrade’s whole family with interesting prospects or threaten them with bodily harm, but they all seem to be supportive of Gavin. Even his ex-wife and her new family have helped with the preparations. SH
Sherlock put his hands in his hair and started to try to pull it out, desperate;  “Enough, that’s enough! Stop STOP!!”
“John? What is all this?’ Why is the door closed?’
Sherlock shifted a bit, to allow John to lean on the desk. Side by side, their arms touching,  they took a minute for their hearts to slow down. Sherlock smiled; “Probability that we were not overheard?” he asked with a sly smile on his lips.
Harry wore a thoughtful expression. “But he was never expressive, right? I remember when Meghan’s family came to visit and you guys came over for the picnic. He introduced you to everyone as ‘my best friend’, even though you were clearly holding hands and dancing together. I called him on it. He explained the two of you had agreed to not be obvious in public because you feared they could be targeted.”
The spotlight on, the lights off, sensual music and the stripper worked his stuff to the delight of all present. Greg’s face was scarlet as the boy stripped down to a sexy black corset, black leather shorts, netted black fishnets and boots to “I’m too Sexy” When that ended he did a naughty dance number to Rihanna’s ‘Umbrella’ using his in very creative ways. John noticed the black umbrella was lined on the inside with cake slice designs, and was presented to Lestrade as a gift. So Sherlock had deduced something. After that, the Yard’s belly dancer was good, but paled in comparison.
“Good.” Moriarty smiled back at the group, “proceed normally and give whatever Dr. Schuller asks for. We need him focused to have what we need for the event.”
“Let’s go now,” Sherlock started as he crossed the room to grab his coat, “we don’t have time to waste.” He added quickly as he exited the sitting room leaving Mycroft and Mary to awkwardly gawk at each other.
John turned around before finding a chair to sit in. He nodded thoughtfully. “I don’t think you’re entirely opposed to it, so yes.”
“Dr. Watson? W-what happened?”
John grimaced as he was finally allowed to help Sherlock to his feet. He looked around the space: half of the factory was exposed to the night air but the men who had attacked him and Gladstone earlier appeared to be gone.
end up finding something to exonerate Dr. Watson…also I really shouldn’t be discussing the case with you. I’m not even the lead on this; Baynes is.”
Schuller looked down at Moriarty’s hand before slowing looking up at the professor whose expression remained content. Schuller nodded curtly to acknowledge that he did in fact remember their last encounter.
John grimaced at Mycroft as the latter nearly shoved him into the room. “Only the best for family.”
Sherlock nodded as he retained his smile. “Of course, Mycroft. Aren’t you? You’re the one who so graciously offered. Of which I also very much appreciate.”
“Are there any more issues I need to address?” Moriarty offered as he leaned against the desk.
floor.”
Sherlock stepped into the room. “Dr. Watson, could you please assist Mary with her father.”
“Gladstone!” Sherlock shouted, but it was too late. Gladstone ran toward Henry who shrieked from the charge. Henry took one giant step backward which caused his body to flip over the railing into one of the vats. Sherlock ran up to the railing just in time to see Henry disappear into the melting metal.
Bridget nodded as she left through a theatrical flurry. About a minute or so after, Fedorov appeared looking just as gruff as he had been earlier.
the extended vacation.”
Sherlock handed the vial to John who wearingly accepted it. “The substance in the vials is the same substance that Mycroft and I found at the murder scene of a priest in Whitechapel and the same substance I found with Wiggins at a cemetery worker’s home who had suffered a similar fate as the priest…”
The woman waited a second as she eyed both John and Sherlock, seemingly on the verge of telling them to vacate her property. But instead of demanding that that they leave, she sighed heavily with another nod.
“Watson,” Sherlock poked his head back out through the window, “it’s clear. Follow me.”
“Holmes…” John began, too stunned to really comprehend what had just happened to Henry, “I'm not sure, but I think I recognized that man…He was in a cell with me…the morning they took me to Scotland Yard…”
Sherlock nodded, trying to reach for Gladstone to calm him. “I’m sure that’s the case, Henry. I know you work for my brother Mycroft. I know you didn’t have anything to do with it.”
“It’s fine, Watson! Come along!” Sherlock shouted from inside.
“…despite the man’s nefarious methods,” Mycroft continued, not realizing that he had been left alone, “I do admire his persistence…” he then turned to his side, noticing that Sherlock had disappeared behind the back of the house, “Sherly!” Mycroft managed to cry out in a half whisper.
“…he lunged towards me, and I pulled out the knife to defend myself…he impaled himself on it…hitting the table, taking the cloth and the stacked dishes with him before knocking over the stand with the bust on it…I froze for a moment before running toward the kitchen…throwing the knife out the window…”
John backed away, shocked. “What? What for?”
Sherlock turned slightly away from the fireplace. “Yes, Mycroft. Actually, I think the alone time will do me some good.”
“Gentlemen, when I give specific instructions, I expect them to be followed to the letter, not done carelessly…”
Earlier that day, Mycroft had given them the priest’s nephew’s address and Sherlock had convinced John that they would remain undetected in the city in disguise. Before that moment, John had never indulged in Sherlock’s penchant for disguises, but he had no other choice since the police would be canvasing all of London to track them down.
file, Holmes?”
“Oh, uh…” John jumped out of the way as the man tried to reach for the bags, “that’s quite all right. We can take them.”
John expressed his bewilderment as he accepted the file, opening it to find copies of court cases. John’s jaw hardened as he flipped through the case files.
The upper level of the sawmill looked just as deserted as the lower level. There were remnants of machinery, but everything was covered with cobwebs and dust. John walked slowly into the middle of space; he could see between the floorboards and joists down into the lower level as he walked. John crouched downward to get a better look; the men were now packing up whatever explosive they had cobbled together.
John rolled his eyes as he hopped out of the driver’s seat. “For god’s sake, Stanley. The queen hasn’t arrived.”
Sherlock crossed his legs before beginning. “Could you please tell us about your whereabouts before we found Standish?”
Lestrade ran ahead to stop Sherlock at the door. “Holmes,
John sighed once more as he looked around the room. “Carberry was working on something, but his methods were unethical…”
John’s eyes widened as shock registered on his face, which then changed from expression to expression as he ruminated on Sherlock saying out loud what felt like a complicated chess match between an unknown assailant. Of course, the thought bothered John; who could be so conniving and callous towards the innocent lives that had perished so far in pursuit of whatever goal?
Lestrade stepped right in front of Sherlock who had walked ahead of the group toward where the prisoners were usually detained before processing.
“Mr. Holmes! Dr. Watson!”
Mycroft nodded as he turned to walk away. “I’ll speak with the director now. Come along, Sherly.”
“Baynes.”
“I’m not sure,” the woman posed thoughtfully, “but I told him he needed to clean out whatever it was, or he would have to find someplace else to rent.”
Mycroft smiled as he removed his coat and hat. “And I’m not too late for dinner, correct? I was looking forward to giving you more words of wisdom,” he turned around to sit down in the chair facing the fireplace, “and I know all of this is trying, Sherly, but I really think the approach you’re taking is the best—”
“You’re going to do whatever you have planned even if I don’t go with you…” Mycroft stated rather than questioned.
Sherlock shook his head as he pointed downward at the men. “Watson, we need to figure out what Schuller is up to.”
“Sherly.” Mycroft started, but Sherlock waved him off again as he continued to pace.
Sherlock grinned as he looked at John then back at the guide. “How untimely. Do you remember the names of these two battling historians?”
John laughed as he shook his head. “Well, it seems as if the real crime has been discovered.”
Lestrade looked around the office before walking over to Detective Baynes’s desk. He looked around hurriedly, all the while glancing back at the office door. Lestrade searched the desk before something in a waste basket next to the desk caught his eye.
“So, what do you make of it?” Sherlock whispered.
Sherlock looked up at him before grunting. “Of course, I did. And look how handy it turned out to be.”
Sherlock nodded again, but he was too upset to contribute.
“I’m afraid it is not our dear Mrs. Hudson!” John heard Sherlock shout back at him.
Sherlock shrugged as if he didn’t know what John was referring to before taking a seat at the table.
A grin slowly crept up on Moriarty’s face. He laughed to himself before looking directly at audience again.
“Please don’t tell me Saxon’s the one who’s been stealing priceless artifacts because we had a ‘tiff’ over that damned exhibit at the Collingwood House.
“Is this man one of the attackers?”
“…whatever Schuller went to prison for was the same substance in some vials Mycroft and I found at Carberry’s—the police didn’t even bother to search through the study.”
Sherlock quieted John with one finger pressed to his lips. He hugged his body up against the wall, sticking out an arm for John to do the same. They could hear guards shouting about a fire down in the basement.
Sherlock expressed confusion. “That’s strange…Henry told us to meet him here.”
Sherlock huffed as he continued reading the paper. “Also, it appears that Basil Whitehall is at it again with his fearmongering.” He added before flipping to another section.
The wheels of the hansom ran over a few pebbles causing their bodies to sway back and forth. Mycroft slouched further down in the seat.
Soon after, the secretary opened her door. “Will you gentlemen be all right? I need to go to the main telegraph office to send a telegram.” She walked briskly to the door before entering the hallway with a huff.
Sherlock hugged his body up against the exterior of the house as he approached a window looking into the study. He crouched down before straightening up, spotting a figure rummaging around in a desk inside the room. Sherlock fished around in his coat until he found an instrument he usually used to pry open windows and doors. He then carefully unlatched the window, hopping effortlessly through the window to land lightly on his feet.
John nodded as he watched Sherlock rejoin him. “Something about that Fedorov character bothers me, too. Holmes.”
Mr. McArthur waved his son off with a frown before leaning in toward Sherlock and John. “James went to school to study architecture—actually he went to that fancy school out in Paris! ‘Echole’ or something rather.”
Saxon turned instantly angry. “Terrorizing? I am an educator, Mr. Holmes! I only meant to get what I was owed.”
Moriarty descended from his automobile as he waved to his driver to stay put. He dusted himself off from the journey before walking toward the mansion, but he didn’t approach the main entrance. Instead, he rounded the mansion to access the service entrance which led him downstairs to the cellar where he found a group of men busying themselves. However, the men working in the cellar weren’t the house staff; these men resembled the same rough individuals Moriarty employed to run his drug ring across the city.
“I’m grounded and can’t do a thing, but at least I would think I would be able to get a decent meal while at home! Stanley! Stanley!”
Mycroft sighed as he leaned back into his chair. “Sherly, I don’t—”
John stood alone in the room, looking around aimlessly until his eyes landed on the desk where Henry kept his stash of vials. He shook his head, knowing that Sherlock was right, but also knew that if they didn’t stop whoever murdered his colleague, more people would get hurt. He took another second before racing after Sherlock who was waiting for him by their hansom.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Okay, so you managed to decipher a poorly structured poem written by our thief.”
John took his time opening the door, revealing a distraught looking Mrs. Hudson accompanied with a man surrounded by police officers from Scotland Yard.
“Uh,” Mycroft squinted his eyes as if that helped him to remember who he was greeting, “may I help you, Miss?”
“While Conrad Coney often trades in oleaginous scandals,” Sherlock started, “from time to time, he does offer some information for a potential lead.” He kept his eyes on the paper.
Mycroft nodded with another sigh. “I did, however…” he then let out a heavy groan, “Sherlock, this is getting dangerous. And more so than I think you realize.”
Mr. McArthur showed Sherlock and John around a bit longer while ignoring that he was still dragging dirt throughout the house.
The men that had been chasing Sherlock were standing outside of the pub, waiting for him to come out. After a moment, a man wearing dirty clothes that were a little too big for him, walked out of the pub. He greeted the men before walking past them and down the street before breaking out into a run to hail a hansom.
“Who’s buried at Saint Paul’s?” Sherlock said out loud, but the question sounded rhetoric.
Sherlock glanced at John with a wink before sauntering over to their breakfast table. He sighed as he picked up that day’s newspaper which hadn’t been trimmed and shredded for his archive.
Sherlock nodded back before holding a hand up. He walked a few steps forward with John closely behind before looking back at John.
Everyone looked at each other for a moment or so before John fired at one of the train employees holding a gun before shooting the hand of another who was in the process of reaching for something in the crate to defend himself. Sherlock ran toward one of the unarmed train employees, wrestling with him to the ground. John lashed out at one of the individuals before the previously armed employee grabbed him from behind, forcing him to lose his grip on his weapon. John fell to the ground with the man, rolling around until he found his revolver. He aimed the revolver at his assailant who cowered in a corner.
“…I didn’t know that Mr. Standish would be here…I panicked…I took the knife for protection after I wrote the letter to my son. I told him that I loved him no matter what…”
“Get in the cab, Watson! I’ll explain when we get there.”
John stared at Sherlock, trying to piece together what the diplomat might have given before William appeared in the room. He looked extremely annoyed.
“What?” Was all John could offer in the moment, “I’ve done nothing wrong!”
“Please remove him.” Moriarty commanded as he wiped the handle of the pistol before delicately placing it back into the desk drawer.
He crouched down to see a burned telegram. Upon examining the telegram, Lestrade could discern a partly visible address.
John waved Sherlock off before entering the sitting room. “Holmes, please. I’m not in the mood.”
John took his time sitting down on the edge of the bed; his expression softened as soon as he realized that Sherlock was being sincere.
Sherlock motioned toward Madame Loire and James who were standing near the fireplace. “Madame Loire and Mr. McArthur,” Sherlock pointed toward two available seats, “could you please take a seat?”
“Oh my god!” Mary shouted, pointing in horror, nearly poking her brother in the eye, “there it is!”
Sherlock nodded but he kept his eyes on his samples. “There are tear patterns here that closely resemble teeth marks…”
“Holmes, I am at a lost. Besides a connection from the poem to Saint Paul’s and the stolen painting, I am not entirely sure if I understand our thief’s motive.”
Sherlock laughed heartily. “You do indeed, dear. Miss?”
John screamed as the bullets rained into the compartment for a moment or so longer before the deluge stopped suddenly. John, too shocked, laid on his side as Sherlock nudged him in the back.
Sherlock waved John off as he stared off determinedly at whatever was out the window. “Holmes.” John called again, but Sherlock wouldn’t respond.
“Mycroft,” Sherlock angrily interrupted, “the article
Sherlock scrunched up his face as he turned sharply to look slightly upwards at his brother. “Mycroft, I am
Sherlock had emerged from their bedroom, later than usual for a typical weekday. John was sitting at their breakfast table reading through his medical notes. Sherlock walked over to pet Gladstone, who was sleeping next to the fireplace.
John, annoyed with himself that he had taken the bait, sighed as he rolled his eyes. “What about it, Holmes?”
“Please plan to discuss the pages on the psychology of the mind during recitation. I will discuss it further during next week’s lecture. You’re dismissed.”
The director eyed Mycroft before accepting the pass. He looked it over once before looking up at both Mycroft and Sherlock with a genuine smile.
Sherlock nodded as he turned around to walk behind Coney’s desk. “Upon entering, I noticed the strange position of the chair which seemed too far eschewed from the desk,” Sherlock pointed to the visitor’s chair, “Coney had a visitor
As they entered, they found an elegant looking woman playing a reed organ in the back corner, seemingly unaware that she now had an audience. Sherlock and John watched her play for some time before she suddenly stopped and turned, gasping out loud in fright from the disturbance.
Sherlock and John bumbled into the room with their suitcases. Mycroft lingered near the door.
“I plan to. Why?” John asked, squinting his eyes at Sherlock who took his time approaching the table.
Sherlock turned his body to watch John walking toward the staircase that led to the upper level of the sawmill. He then turned his head slightly to get a better view of the activity on the ground floor of the structure. From his position, Sherlock could see the group of men working at the table. He could hear one of the men fusing over the charge of the explosive.
John blinked a few times. “Holmes?” But before he could further berate Sherlock, something out of the corner of his eye caught his attention as the hansom sped away from the prison. In fact, it was a figure of man running in the opposite direction from Westgate. John’s eyes widened as he realized that the man running away was Hans Schuller.
“Watson.” Sherlock stood up from the floor to limp toward John, “you need to trust that we’ll figure our way out of this. We have Carberry’s journal. That’s the key to solving this case.”
Coney nodded as he couldn’t help himself from being flattered by the attention. “Why, yes I am. You say you read my column
“Okay!” John heard the ghost shout back, “please, you are hurting my arm!”
John shuffled around awkwardly. “Uh, yes. Is, uh, Mr. Wheeler home?”
Bridget nodded slowly before shuffling around.
Wiggins shook his head. “That’s no problem, Mr. ‘olmes! You’ve always been so kind to me.” He smiled widely at Sherlock who couldn’t help but smile back.
“Lestrade,” Sherlock began quietly, “I need to speak with Watson.” He stepped to the side to get way from Lestrade.
“John?” Sherlock’s voice interrupted a brief fantasy John was experiencing, imagining reading the morning paper in peace, “we have tea with Mary later this week, so please bear that in mind.”
James sighed loudly again. “I…gave…Pierre…the shoes. We knew each other back in Paris…” He turned slightly to look back at Pierre as his face turned red.
“I think you’ll be in for quite the surprise. I managed to get a few close friends of mine over for the weekend as well.” Mycroft had stopped them in front of a grand staircase.
. You’re overreacting to a misunderstanding.”
“Fine,” John started as he sat back into his seat, “but if we don’t find anything quickly, we need to leave right away.”
He clapped his hands together before disappearing down the hallway.
Sherlock straightened up as he walked toward the trail with John following closely behind. Sherlock opened the door to the kitchen to find the rest of the trail.
Mary huffed before taking a sip of her tea, but she didn’t respond. Sherlock turned in his seat to look at her directly.
John grumbled. “I forgot that I need to visit James Carberry. He hasn’t been feeling well lately and asked if I could give him a second opinion to confirm his own.” The last part of John’s explanation irked him the most. James Carberry was a classmate of John’s back at the University of London, but lately they hadn’t been seeing eye-to-eye. Most of this tension was due to John objecting to Carberry’s marginally unethical medical practices.
“Well!” Mr. McArthur rested his hands on his hips, “I think we can finally get all this ghost business behind us.” He then spun around quickly to exit the bedroom, “let’s all hurry back and try Madame Loire’s tarte tatin.”
The man nodded. “We should be ready in time for Whitehall’s event.”
Lestrade frowned, a little put off by Sherlock’s response. After a moment he smiled slightly just to remain calm before finally letting Sherlock leave the office. Sherlock rushed out into the hallway without further explanation. Lestrade sighed before saying goodbye to Mycroft and Mary who then followed Sherlock down the hallway.
Sherlock smiled at Mary before waving for everyone to follow him to the source of the noise. The group walked upstairs and into one of the largest bedrooms, but they found nothing besides some old furniture covered in cloth and paintings lined against the wall.
Sherlock ignored him as he waved John’s behavior toward his antics off casually. “We’re getting closer to whomever framed you, Watson, but we need to go home.”
Both Mrs. Hudson and Sherlock crowded around a now terrified looking John. “For what?” Mrs. Hudson shrieked.
“…which is why,” Sherlock continued ignoring the whisperings, “I think your findings are too simplistic, Professor. Especially coming from some with your invaluable knowledge.”
Mycroft smiled as he joined Sherlock at the cell bars. “Dr. Watson, enjoying your lodgings?” He sneered.
Sherlock held up a hand to stop his brother from rambling on. “Mycroft. We have no other choice but to get Watson out of Westgate. Now.” He turned to face Mycroft directly who looked confused.
John looked around as they approached, remarking to himself that the atmosphere that night felt particularly eerie. The sawmill, and the yard it was located in, had been derelict for quite some time; vegetation had overgrown the site and the sawmill looked to be on the verge of collapse. Yet the lighting from the candlelight inside illuminating the group of men brought an unsettling air of life to the sawmill.
Sherlock waved a hand as he turned slightly so that half of his body was facing the fireplace. “I suppose I should finally explain myself.”
John nodded before taking a hold of Sherlock’s hand. “I know.”
The police officer’s eyes widened as his mouth fell open. His neck swiveled his head back and forth as he gawked at John then back at Sherlock, seemingly surprised that the man wearing an ill-fitting dress and smeared makeup was the great Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock smiled as he walked into the middle of the room. “It was obvious from the very beginning that the ghost,” Sherlock turned to point back at Madame Loire’s son, “had help. I had my suspicions, of course.” He then looked directly at Madame Loire. “Madame Loire, you lied to me when you told me you hadn’t seen your son in ages, correct? Actually, I saw the two of you back at Mr. McArthur’s mansion before we came over here for dinner, correct?”
“Mr. Holmes.” A smartly dressed woman whose carefully posh English accent gave away years of elocution lessons addressed Sherlock with a curt nod.
Sincerest apologies that this chapter is late!! Got caught up with some personal stuff this past week.
“Quickly, Watson!” Sherlock grabbed John by the elbow as they ran to the front of the house.
“Well, Mr. Holmes, maybe we can continue this riveting debate at the end of the session. I would love to hear more of your thoughts.”
“I do believe that Mrs. Hudson has graciously prepared our meal for us already.” John commented as he followed Sherlock up the stairs. He walked ahead of Sherlock to open the door to their sitting room, smiling widely.
Sherlock hid behind one of the main receiving doors to the factory, peering out past the door to look around the corner. He could see a nicely dressed man standing several feet beyond the factory in the yard dedicating orders to another individual who resembled the men inside the factory. Sherlock inched further along the door, straining his ears to pick up anything from their conversation.
John made a face at the word “we”, but a spark of memory flashed, interrupting that thought process as John instantly recognized what Detective Baynes was referring to.
“…but what is the most puzzling now is this stanza the thief left behind at Saint Paul’s…clearly it is not his own…” John pointed to a few lines of a poem scribbled out on their board.
Wiggins gasped. “…Mr…’olmes…?”
Sherlock walked over to Wiggins and accepted the vials for inspection. “Indeed, they are, Wiggins.” He crouched down to look through the tray Wiggins had found the vials. He turned one over to see a label from a well-known opium den in Whitechapel.
“I had absolutely nothing to do with this!” William exclaimed.
Sherlock shook his head. “Baynes supposedly has some incriminatory evidence that Lestrade was unwilling to divulge. We need to find out what they missed at that house.”
“…why am I here?” Schuller then responded quietly without taking Moriarty’s hand.
