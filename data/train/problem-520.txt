Liz turned in her seat. “I read about the case in the papers and remembered your name. Also, I recognised you in the photograph. You haven’t changed much since uni, I have to say. Only your sense of dress is more refined. I really like your coat. Belstaff, isn’t it? Pity they don’t sell them anymore. But in fact I had already been reminded of your name before the article was published. I’d heard about your supposed death, of course, back when it was all over the news, but I didn’t immediately make the connection with the scowling fellow I remembered from Cambridge. I thought you looked familiar, but since, as I said, we never really had much contact at uni, I wasn’t entirely sure if you were the same guy. And then I met your friend at some charity event in Kensington where he was promoting his teas, and we got chatting. He’d only recently arrived in the UK, and I think he was glad to see a familiar face, even though we hadn’t seen each other for years, not since he suddenly left uni.”
They passed through a small village, Eyke, John managed to read on the sign when the headlights illuminated it briefly. It just consisted of a few low houses lined up along the road like beads on a piece of string. Behind the village Katie indicated right and they left the road, following a narrow lane towards a darker patch of land which seemed to be a line of trees or a forest. Dark hedgerows rushed past, dense like bristly walls, encroaching onto the road on both sides. At one point a pair of eyes met John’s briefly, the car’s lights reflected in them before they vanished in the gloom.
Now, John has proven himself to be willing to bend the rules now and again. He even appears to be enjoying it, despite being used to a strict hierarchy and chain of command
“What are we going to do now? Call Katie and the Millers to come and fetch their foal and have a stern word with their offspring?”
John takes another looks around and smiles. “No, not at all. Better than your place, anyway. I doubt your landlord there approves of you bringing company. I also prefer this to some run-down hotel, because that’s all we’d be able to afford with what little money I’ve left. I’ll have to visit the bank tomorrow before with return to Bletchley. I doubt I have enough on me to pay for our train tickets, and you gave all your money to that street urchin, Wiggins.”
Interestingly – surprisingly – John finds that he doesn’t mind the fan activities. They’re obviously having a lark, bless them. People are paired with others, often of the same gender, all the time. One simply has to look at Moriarty and Moran and their enthusiastic fans. They don’t mean any harm, or do they? John is slowly coming to terms with the fact he might be –
“Yes, that’s the one. She’s read it once already, at least, and seemed quite upset about the author dying as I’ve mentioned. Apparently, one of her favourite characters dies, too, in the book. She seemed very moved by it, drew several pictures of the characters.”
Denniston raises an eyebrow, a faint smile twitching at the corners of his mouth. “I very much doubt that anything we might discuss here is news to you, Miss Smith. You may stay.”
With a sigh, John got some fresh underwear from his rucksack and set out for the bathroom. The smell of coffee greeted him as he crossed the corridor. After a quick wash and shave and brush of teeth, he dressed, returned his pyjamas to their room and fetched his phone (still no message), and wandered off in the direction of the kitchen. There Katie sat at the table nursing a mug of coffee and reading the paper, an empty cereal bowl next to her.
“Likewise,” gasps Sherlock, grinning at him. Suddenly, this whole sex thing doesn’t seem so daunting anymore. Yes, Sherlock still feels woefully unprepared and resents having little practical knowledge to fall back upon. Yes, his mind palace is still in shambles. Yes, he is probably making a complete fool of himself. But he’s also made John laugh so hard he cried. John dissolved into happy giggles in his arms. He can feel John’s desire for him, hot and hard against his hip. So whatever else happens, this alone has been worth the storm of emotion wracking him, and the destruction in its wake.
“Sorry, sir”, he mutters. Lestrade nods towards the door. “Get him into the car and out of my sight. Sergeant, I see you’ve been taking notes. Excellent. If Mr. Moran spews any further nonsense, record each and every word. He’s already in deep, but if he starts spouting Nazi propaganda, he’ll dig his own grave very quickly. Off with him.”
Sherlock holds his gaze, before his lips twitch in a tiny smile. “Well, I’ve come this far already,” he replies, waving a hand evasively, “and things have been going better than I thought. The team is tolerable, the food excellent, the countryside spectacular ...”
“Fuck,” he curses when the water hits the wounds, followed by “Jesus fucking Christ,” when he begins to rub the skin gently, tearing off the thin layer of cream, forcing the abrasions to bleed again and washing out any remaining bits of road dirt and gravel still stuck in the wound. He lets the water run for a while, as cool and with as much pressure as feels comfortable, washing away sweat and grime and blood. He forgoes shaving his legs this time, simply stands in the shower until the pain subsides somewhat. When he reaches for a towel, he silently apologises to the hotel staff who are going to have to clean the blood-soaked thing again. Carefully dabbing at the oozing wounds, he then wraps another towel round his waist and hobbles into the room. Apparently, Sarah has organised another key-card, because she is already there. Her bag sits on one of the beds where she has spread out bandages and medication after removing the duvet, and a large disposable cover to protect the mattress. She turns to him, taking in his state with a wry smile while pulling on a pair of disposable gloves.
John shook his head, smiling sleepily to himself. Apparently someone had forgotten to pack his pyjama bottoms.
John made room for him to sit down, having already fetched plates and vinegar for the chips. “Was Mehmed the fellow we helped in that forgery case with the carpets?”
“How do you know your way ‘round here so well?” enquires John when Sherlock turns into an alley leading southwards, his sense of direction sure and his pace quick.
“In a manner of speaking, yes,” answered Sherlock evasively, pulling his pyjamas from the bag and hanging them over one of the chairs at the table.
John quickly scans the article, which picks up on the rumours that by undermining safety protocols and environmental safeguards, the company was directly responsible for a large leak of toxic chemicals into a river in Romania, causing widespread destruction of wildlife and natural habitats, as well as poisoning the water supply for a number of settlements, endangering the inhabitants. Baskerville’s CEO and other high-ranking officials have been accused of trying to buy off the affected people or to pressure them into silence, as well as obscuring the true reach and effects of the spill, which apparently can be traced all the way along the river Danube and into the Black Sea. Due to the investigations of a number of environmental organisations and journalists, the true cost in the affected region has come to light and calls for not only reparations but also consequences in the leadership and organisation of Baskerville Chemicals have arisen from a number of outlets, reaching as far as EU leaders and the WHO.
John sighs, suddenly weary. “Why can’t you just answer a damn question frankly for a change? You reveal so little about yourself, and know so much about me. It’s ... frustrating. I don’t have your deductive powers. I can’t read you like you read me.”
“Not a problem,” John assures him, gesturing to him to lie on his arm and cuddle up to John’s side, which Sherlock hurries to do. It feels utterly brilliant. Familiar and safe and cherished, he realises how much he has missed this. John seems to share the sentiment. He leans in to kiss Sherlock’s forehead. “Sherlock, you are spectacular.”
“Is it bad?” asks Sherlock, pointing at the bleeding leg while stroking the lamb’s neck with his other hand. He’s fascinated by how fatty it feels under his hands. No wonder sheep can stay outside all year, even in winter, with their coats repelling water naturally.
“Well,” replied Sherlock sternly, “they are thieves. Thieves usually go to prison when they are caught.”
Looking up, Sherlock spots John. Some of the agitated tension leaves his frame. The honk of a horn announces the arrival of Sam’s car. John lets out a huge sigh of relief.
The plan works. Both of them arrive back in Albi about ten minutes later and cross the finish line only about twelve seconds apart. Well, twelve seconds plus eight minutes. Both are soaked to the skin, Victor’s white outfit having become mostly see-through where it hasn’t been splattered with mud (John is once again grateful for the dark colours his own team uses), and both are winded and somewhat unsteady on their legs as they dismount behind the finish to be welcomed by their
“Still not interested. You don’t get it, do you? You’re trying to protect your brother. I understand. But your methods are questionable at best, and the exact opposite of what you should be doing to regain his trust. Had him locked away in some rehab facility, right? No wonder he’s slow to trust other people, when his own family sectioned him against his will.”
“Yes, I did. Frequently. In the weeks after your … Fall, I relived the scene almost nightly. I saw you lying on the pavement with your face splattered with blood. Sometimes I was on the roof with you and you fell or jumped or were pushed before I could reach you. Sometimes you spoke after you had landed. Sometimes ...” he swallowed hard. “Well, suffice to say my nightmares weren’t about Afghanistan anymore, or if they were, those weren’t the bad ones.”
John nods thoughtfully. That things have come to this ... But he approves of the measures. “Have you found out anything concerning yesterday’s stage?” he asks the mechanics.
for suggestions and advice concerning 1940s music. All the songs mentioned in the chapter exist and can be found online. To get you in the right mood, I suggest listening to Benny Goodman's famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Concert, or Glenn Miller's from the following year. One of the songs of their repertoire, incidentally, is featured in one of my favourite Sherlock fanvids: "
“Think about it, John. I’m not a child. I can look after myself. While I appreciate your care and concern to a certain extent, I resent molly-coddling in any form. And what I resent even more is petty jealousy.”
Now, Nora Perkins wouldn’t have tried to break and enter for some secret exploration and documentation of the place, would she? Or did she have permission to enter, but the security personnel weren’t aware of that and attacked her, thinking her an intruder? How did she get in, anyway? Surely, the place would have been locked to the general public. Did she discover something unusual while she was down here, with permission or without? Illegal use of the place, perhaps? A large subterranean space like this would surely make good secret storage for contraband goods, drugs, stolen treasure. Or become a strategic location for terror plots, as the Moran case revealed. What plans does the owner of this old station have for it, anyway? The buildings surrounding Brompton Road Station aren’t very representative. Does the owner want to tear everything down to build his luxury flats? Did Nora want to document the station before it is changed forever, its historic value destroyed by greedy investors like so many places in London right now?
are getting louder. Sherlock stands gazing unseeingly into the shaft. How deep is it? There isn’t another floor beneath this one, only the slight slope and flight of stairs down to the tracks. That means the hole of the shaft should only be deep enough to accommodate the lift itself, which has been removed. But how to make sure? Sherlock can’t risk climbing or even jumping down, only to find that he can’t get out again. That would be more than counterproductive.
Sherlock grins at him broadly. “Don’t you see, John? It’s obvious, isn’t it? The handkerchief was obviously a woman’s. Fine muslin fabric, lace trim, no monograph, however, which did strike me as odd at the time, because most of her other hankies bore her embroidered initials. So the handkerchief wasn’t Jenny’s originally, none of those she brought from home, but must have been a gift. Could have been from her fiancé or another man, yes, or perhaps she bought it somewhere. But bear with me as there is another explanation. Because there was more. God, how could I not have paid more attention to the find back when we checked her room? The hanky had been used. There were traces of face-powder and lipstick on it. Someone had wiped their face and mouth with it. Now, you may wonder, and rightly so, why Jennifer would keep it in that state and not wash it after using it, or after lending it to someone else and receiving it back. To preserve the scent of perfume? Unlikely. The entire envelope smelled of it. If she wanted to keep the scent, she could easily have kept the envelope on its own. No, the perfume, the fact she preserved the handkerchief in its used state, despite there being make-up stains on it suggest something else.”
Team Speedy’s are sitting glued to their screens, rooting for both Kit and Sherlock. The former manages to gain nine seconds on Lachapelle in the end, which sadly is not enough to take over the white jersey. Kit nearly collapses behind the finish and is escorted back to the team tents by Irene and Kate.
“I’m all for an early start,” agreed John. Even though he did not particularly mind temperatures over thirty degrees, having experienced far more extreme weather phenomena in Afghanistan with its blazing hot days and freezing nights, he didn’t fancy cycling in these conditions. He tended to sweat a lot and needed to drink much accordingly. And Sherlock did not function well in strong heat, claiming it impaired the proper functioning of his brain. This statement had caused John to call him a troll and suggest an air-cooled hat in a reference to Terry Pratchett’s
Just when John is about to enter the hotel behind Kit and the others, a last glance over the Place de la Comédie makes him hesitate. Across the broad, oval expanse, he spots a figure with a familiar mop of dark curls sporting a dark hoodie and jeans, a camera with a large telephoto-lens in hand. Before he can even make a conscious decision, John has already turned around and is hastening past the fountain towards the figure who is heading into one of the side streets, walking quickly and with purpose.
“Even patients need fresh air,” declares John, grinning as he watches Hattie make sounds at the birds, her tail swishing excitedly, her ears twitching. Sherlock laughs. He’s always considered himself a bit of a rule-breaker, but it seems John Watson is beating him at this game.
Sherlock laughs softly at the comment. He feels light and slightly dizzy, but in a good way. This is so exciting. It’s almost as good as being kissed by John. The possibilities ... oh, they are marvellous, both for crime-fighting and case-solving. They’ll have to work on communicating with their environment – the world of the living – of course. He wonders whether Lestrade actually got his texts and emails asking for cases. Can living people receive ghost messages sent electronically? He needs to find out. And as for Mrs. Hudson, there are two possibilities. Either, she can easily communicate with ghosts, which Sherlock wouldn’t put beyond her. Perhaps her consumption of herbal soothers helps there. Or ...
The landscape becomes rougher. Forest encroaches on fields and meadows. The heights visible from the ridge the riders have just climbed look increasingly like mountains instead of hills. Exposed rock-faces are showing, erosion scars, some peaks are rising above the treeline. The vegetation shifts subtly towards a more alpine one. In the higher regions, deciduous trees are replaced by firs and spruces. The shapes and building materials of houses and the layout of towns and villages change. Roofs become flatter and are covered with slate instead of tiles, facades are hidden behind wooden panelling to protect them from the elements. Further to the east, the outliers of the Alps can be seen rising blue in the distance.
“The ‘team’, yeah,” growls Wiggins. “Like the happy little family we are. Fuck the team, seriously. Nobody listened to me when I told you about my plans for today. Or rather, you did listen, and then told me to shut up and do what Captain Jim here tells you, even though it was fucked up and wrong. I’ve already lost out on the polka-dot once, because I worked for the fucking team. Worked my arse off and didn’t get one word of thanks.”
Sherlock wakes with a start, to almost complete darkness. To his surprise, once he’s regained his bearings, he can see a sliver of moonlight filter into the room. John must have drawn apart the heavy blackout curtains a little to alleviate the oppressive darkness. He has also opened the windows a fraction to air the room. A faint touch of cool night air wafts through the room. Sherlock can hear the soft hoot of an owl in the distance. Something is rustling in the potato plants in the garden.
here – purely accidentally, of course; a word to the tabloids there – just picking up what others have said before. Some pressure on your teammates to ride extra fast to distance Wilkes during the Camargue stage and others. Your association with your team doctor Fratelli – guess he was the best man for the job, wasn’t he, with his extensive connections and huge arsenal of ... medications.”
“But you have solved it, Mr. Holmes. She committed suicide. Isn’t that what the coroner found out? Doesn’t the evidence you gathered point that way? That’s all I know, too. I didn’t kill her. Why would I? I loved her.”
Sherlock takes his time tuning the instrument, both to consider what to play for John and to get a feel for the violin again. Even though his arms and fingers remember how to hold the instrument and will surely recall what to do to coax music out of it, Sherlock wants to get this right. When he is finally satisfied with the tuning, he casts a glance at John. “Any particular wishes?”
“No. They must have been acquired for guests. I don’t have any clothes here any longer, I don’t think.” He gazes at John, sighs. He does need the toilet. “I’ll be quick,” he promises.
“Nothing,” replied John softly, not keen on the others overhearing them. “It just surprises me that you seem content to more or less let the case rest for tonight, that’s all. Usually you’d firmly insist on visiting the Goodman brothers yourself instead of casually mentioning you’d like to see them. Or you’d be following the trail of our fugitive over the heath, even at night. Hell, I would, if I was unhurt. And yet here you sit and fill out boring forms. That’s … unusual, to say the least. Almost worrying, to be honest.”
Susan smiled broadly. “That’s Icelanders for you. We’re lucky with the ones we’ve got. Most tölt easily, which is always a delight for the children who usually ride them. Would you like to try a faster speed, too. Try and get them to gallop. Both are five-gaiters, so you might try the skeið, too? Not sure you’ll manage since it usually requires quite a bit of experience, but both ladies can be persuaded to use it, Fenja more than Tjálga.”
The sound of a rock rolling down the hillside makes Sherlock jump and almost drop the phone. The wind is stronger now, howling and whistling around the cairns. It almost sounds like a choir of uncanny voices. Instead of dispersing the damned fog, it’s bringing more and even denser clouds from the north-west – or from what Sherlock assumes the north-west to be. He can barely see his own feet now. It seems to have got darker, too, despite it only being half past four. His heart is hammering in his chest. The rock ... somebody or something must have tread it loose. John? A sheep? Which direction did it come from? The fog seems to carry and distort sound in a weird way. This sound, just now, was this another rock sliding, or a foot grating on scree on the rough ground. Was it a hoarse voice calling? Was it the raven again, croaking forlornly, or a lamb bleating for its mother? Or was it just the howl of the wind again? Or was the voice in Sherlock’s own head?
Sherlock is interrupted by a furious growl, and braces himself for an attack. Moran certainly looks ready to hit him. His face is red. He is breathing heavily through his nose. His unscarred hand is balled into a tight fist, the knuckles of which are showing white. He looks like he is restraining himself from attacking Sherlock with considerable effort.
The hours he spends roaming the Downs, mostly with Jan and his dog but sometimes on his own when Jan hasn’t arrived yet or is elsewhere – he never says where he goes then, but Sherlock notices that he rarely shows up when strangers are about near the tree-henge or the pond. Sherlock has asked him twice where he lives, but each time Jan has only made a vague motion over the Downs which seems to imply that he is local. He certainly knows his way around, knows places to find good flints to make tools and arrow-heads. He knows which wood to use for what, be it bow or arrow-shaft, walking stick, flute or basket. He knows which plants are poisonous and which ones are edible, or whether they have any healing properties. He can tell what the weather’s going to be like by looking at the clouds and feeling the wind. To Sherlock’s amazement, he correctly forecast the thunderstorm by studying his sheep’s behaviour. And he knows a lot about sheep – as he should as a shepherd. Sherlock wonders if that is indeed his profession. After all, he is still a child. Maybe he is just jobbing for the holidays. When Sherlock asks after his school, though, he only gets a vague answer. He concludes that Jan may be home-schooled, and that his parents don’t speak English. That would explain the fact that he can’t read, only the odd word that he seems to recognise by its shape. He can do maths, though, and seems pretty good at them. Sherlock tries to teach him chess on his little portable set, and he picks it up quickly. Sherlock learns Jan has an elder brother who seems to be a bit of an idiot, which makes him even more sympathetic in Sherlock’s eyes.
John wakes at the break of dawn. Grey light is filtering into the room, the corners of which are still dark. He needs to piss, but when his mind has cleared enough to take stock of the bed situation, he stays put. During the night, Sherlock has scooted over to John’s side and now lies curled up in a foetal position, his arms angled and his hands nearly touching his face. From John’s vantage point, he almost looks as if he is sucking his thumb. Sherlock’s tousled head is partly resting on John’s pillow, his forehead is bumping against John’s shoulder. His drawn-up knees are touching John’s upper thigh. His warm, regular breaths are fanning over John’s throat.
“We don’t really have a strategy for tomorrow apart from getting all of you through without crashing, if possible,” says Sally. “There’s no pressure on any of you. Just try to stay inside time limit. That goes for you as well, Sherlock.” She grins. “Well, the time limit shouldn’t pose a problem for you. But don’t take any unnecessary risks, okay? You’ve been doing so well – all of you – that we’ve more than earned our keep already. The weather thing is unfortunate, but it will hit most of the favourites with late start times. So perhaps we’ll see a surprise winner tomorrow.”
John grins, nodding towards Billy. “Well, there’s the skull, obviously. And,” he steps closer to Sherlock, runs a hand down his lapel, “you.”
“Because she asked what the most curious thing at our place was, and whether we had any interesting books,” says John as he approaches them.
“I thought you wanted to apologise.” Sherlock lowers the camera and turns to gaze at John. His eyes are narrowed and his lips pressed together, but he looks more curious than angry, and even, if John is reading his expression correctly, a little amused.
“Probably. But there must have been something else, something more official. I strongly suspect that some samples Magnussen gave recently tested positive and that they’re now waiting for the results of the B-sample for confirmation.”
At some point during the night, Sherlock must have returned to their room to fetch a few things such as toiletries, but not to sleep. His bed is still untouched when John wakes around seven. John’s phone, which he forgot to plug in to charge, only shows a few Twitter notifications and a message from James thanking him for the call and wishing him good luck for the stage and with Sherlock. There is no other message from Sherlock. John plugs in the device, then goes to open the window and steps out onto the veranda-like balcony that connects all rooms on the first floor. The air is cool with a light breeze. Some animal or bird is making strange noises somewhere near the lake. The other rooms are quiet.
Moran spits, narrowly avoiding to hit Lestrade’s shoe. “This country is finished, anyway. You’ll be starved out of this war before long, and even your American friends won’t be able to help you. And then you’ll suffer the same fate as Poland, France and Scandinavia.”
Sherlock made an indistinguishable noise. John translated it as ‘no’, but decided not to tease his friend about it at this point. “I see,” he said. “Which animal did you have?”
Sherlock scowled at him, a sharp remark obviously on his tongue. John braced himself for the barb, but it never came. Sherlock’s expression changed. He dropped his gaze and let out a long breath, his intimidating demeanour deflating. “I learned my lesson,” he said quietly, looking grave, almost sad of a sudden.
Sherlock can’t help exchange a glance with John. “Well, I might need a place in London after the war,” says John, speaking lightly.
killed us, it seems, by accident. Sorry about that, by the way. But we didn’t notice, you see. We just woke up with those skull-splitting headaches and you administered painkillers and lots of water and we slept it off and then stayed in the flat for a good while because we were feeling somewhat weird and out of sorts. We didn’t have contact with anybody because nobody can see us, and of course we had died, so why should anybody come and visit? And—”
“Right, well, I’ll go there tomorrow morning and ask.” He stifles a yawn. “And if you’re right, I fear you’ll have to endure my tagging along for a while longer. But for now we should try and get some rest. Hope I won’t disturb you again. Just ... I don’t know ... pound against the wall or something to wake me should the dreams start again. Or if I snore or something.”
He does look the part, too, for people who care to pay attention to these details. His pale skin has acquired a freckly tan. His nose and the back of his neck are even slightly burned when he forgot to apply suncream one day. He has gained some muscle, too, mostly from working at Ellie’s, but also from running around so much, uphill, downhill, after the sheep, playfully chasing Lightning or be chased by him. His fingers are rough and callused, and the soles of his feet are thick enough now so that he can walk all the way from the Warringtons’ house to the Downs and back barefoot without being bothered too much by hot asphalt or the odd sharp flint.
the following evening. Sebastian Wilkes survives the stage, being chaperoned by his teammates throughout it and mostly riding in their slipstream. He doesn’t stay around for interviews at the finish. Few riders do. Most are glad to disappear into their coaches and head to their hotels, to catch as much rest as possible in preparation for the upcoming mountain stages. Thankfully, there is no transfer between stages this time, meaning distances to hotels are short.
Her calm and collected facade cracking, she runs a slightly tremulous hand through the strands that have slipped out of the bun. “No, Mr. Holmes—”
Sherlock chuckles. “I am aware, John. Unfortunately, crime doesn’t rest. I received a tip-off concerning Magnussen which is worth following. His team’s hotel is not far from ours. A ten minute walk at best.”
“No need to explain, Eddie,” Sherlock assures him. “I take it you ... saved some films, or indeed snippets of film material you were asked to cut by your employer so certain films could be shown or distributed more widely, and now you earn a little on the side by copying them and selling them on. Well, we all must make a living, I guess.”
Again Sherlock remained silent. Belatedly, John realised that Emma had to cross the corridor in order to reach the staircase. He pressed himself against the wall, hoping she might not notice him in the gloom, but of course she did. Her eyes widened, but then she bit her lip and smiled very slightly. Winking at him, she gathered the blanket she was wearing like a cloak more tightly round herself and set out in the direction of the stairs.
She sighs and gazes at him. “I noticed how you were around James, how he was around you. You were joined at the hip. I also remember, vividly, how you reacted when he had that accident. All of us were worried about him, naturally. But you ... it was ... different. He meant a lot to you, didn’t he? You were friends, had been roommates for years ...” Catching John’s expression, she goes on. John detects a wariness around her she doesn’t usually display towards him. Sarah can be frank to the point of being rude, and he’s always appreciated her no-nonsense attitude, her outspokenness. But now she seems to be choosing her words with great caution, obviously not wanting to upset him.
Sherlock sighs, shifts uneasily, his dressing down swaying. “I thought it would make things easier,” he defends himself, sounding pitifully unsure. “I don’t ... I’ve never done this before. I don’t know how to explain these things in words. Hence the ...,” he motions awkwardly towards the pages on John’s lap, swallows again. “Hence the pictures.”
“Let me tell you something about your brain, Mr. Holmes,” said John, stepping to him and reaching up to tap his forefinger against Sherlock’s brow under the fringe of wayward curls. “For something this massive and hyper-active and intelligent, it can be a real idiot sometimes.”
“Remarkable, or shocking? But I spoke the truth. I haven’t been drunk, at least not in the way you are implying, for ‘fun’ at some social event or other. However, I once rendered myself somewhat inebriated during an experiment with different concentrations of ethanol. The effects were such that I did not long for a repeat.”
“Yes. Most emails in my inbox were either spam or cases so simple I solved them on the spot or deleted them as insults to my intelligence. Three were of interest, though. You have the choice between a stolen sculpture in Bloomsbury, Jack the Ripper Tour accidents in Whitechapel, or a potential murder in the Lake District.”
John sniffs. “Yeah.” He doesn’t look at Sherlock, doesn’t need to feel even more embarrassed. His cheeks and ears are burning. A spiky elbow pokes his side gently.
“Looks like he’s gonna need a new one, then,” says the cleaner dryly. “Don’t think anything can be done about that one, but if you’d like to hold on to it, feel free. Perhaps the SIM-card is still intact. It’s always so annoying to get all those contacts back. Here, take it. Wait, I’ll give you a bag for it.”
Sherlock laughs softly. “At interrogating me. I should like to satisfy your raging curiosity, but unfortunately, I have no straight answer for your question.”
“Yes, but there is more. According to Lestrade, her Oyster card revealed that she bought it three days prior to her death at Liverpool Street Station. It had last been used the day before her demise for a journey from High Street Kensington to Chalk Farm on the Tube, but not on the day of her death. That means she must have walked to Tate Modern, and according to what we found out about her eating habits passed by Borough Market for her lunch.”
When he looks around, he can’t spot any CCTV cameras, at least not public ones. There is some kind of security device next to the door, but it looks like a normal and not very sophisticated burglar alarm. Interesting. If this is indeed the entrance to the old station, someone with access could easily drive into Cottage Place with a car, park in front of the door, and unload their cargo there without too many people noticing, particularly at night when even Brompton Road isn’t very busy but for the usual wankers racing their macho cars there. John harbours a profound loathing for these people (and actually most others who use a private car in central London – selling the one he owned with Mary was one of the first things he did after she’d gone).
But at the same time, his body clamours to fuck patience, fuck slow, fuck cataloguing, and more importantly, to fuck John – but that last bit quite literally, please. Sherlock has been patient for eight years. And now that finally, finally he’s been given a second chance, a chance to explore this with John, to kiss him, touch him, feel his body pressed against his own, feel his arousal and know that it’s because of Sherlock, that John wants him as well ... Why on earth should he be patient any longer? He wants this, he wants ... everything, and is both shocked and emboldened by this desire.
“Sherlock, could you please breathe for me,” John’s gentle voice pulls him out of his mind. He blinks again, until John’s actual words register. He sucks in a deep breath, coughs, then breathes some more. John reaches out and claps his back.
Sherlock sits down next to him, wondering whether complaints about John’s day will once again blow up into a diatribe about the menace of cars in inner cities, leading to air pollution, leading to the failures of government, leading to Brexit, leading to the USA and the possibility of the Americans electing a fraud and con man as their next president.
Whether his words somehow reached through to Sherlock’s consciousness or else Sherlock was waking by himself, he seemed to be coming round. Drawing a deep breath that wracked his entire body and made him sound as if he was emerging from deep water, he pulled his head from John’s shoulder abruptly and gazed round, sniffing. The room was dark but for the soft greenish glow from Katie’s time capsule under the desk. John doubted Sherlock was seeing much and if he was, he didn’t seem to be recognising his whereabouts.
John gazes at him, and now he’s the one to blush. “Good. That’s ... good.” He clears his throat and licks his lips as both of them gaze ahead, avoiding the other’s eyes as if fearing they’ve already said too much.
He is unprepared for the flash of anger in John’s eyes, much less for him standing up and walking over to Sherlock. He looks put out. Sherlock wonders if he’s angry at him. Will this be the confrontation about the Fall? Will they finally talk about that? Will old wounds be torn open again? Automatically, he takes a step back, and half lifts the coat hangers in his hands like a shield. Immediately, John freezes. His eyes widen in shock, and then he raises a hand to his mouth.
Sherlock makes a questioning sound, and John explains, “Swifts. Swallows, too. But mostly the swifts and the sounds they make. Back when I was a kid, every year once they had arrived, it felt as though summer had come, too, and the summer holidays were not that far off.
Sherlock’s spine straightens. He seems very interested in the instruction manual of a sudden. His cheeks are tinged crimson.
“Well, I’ve never given another bloke a blow-job before, if that’s what that last drawing, the one with the question mark, is supposed to show.”
“Surprisingly, yes,” replies Sherlock, sounding stunned, awed and pleased at the same time. He swallows, clears his throat, his tense shoulders relaxing. His voice takes on a more habitually bossy tone. “And while you’re at it ... it appears as though icing sugar has found its way down the front of my shirt as well. And the side of my throat. And my chin. And my lips.”
Sherlock smiled warmly at this. “I won’t forget,” he promised. “For now, could I request some light cuddling?” he then asked. “It helps me think, and you look like you’re about to fall asleep again after your exertion.”
Sherlock shrugged again. “Maybe. It was … easy to be around him. He didn’t seem to judge me or try to alter me. Often we’d just spend time at the library reading, or sit outside the Café Nero on Market Street to watch (and in my case deduce) the passers by, or visit Fitzbillies on Trumpington Street for tea (although I suspect he was more interested in the girls from Pembroke College than the homemade cakes). I didn’t accompany him to parties or sporting events, despite him asking. But those things didn’t interest me, and moreover I didn’t want to invite more spite from his ‘mates’ who’d already begun to ridicule him for keeping company with the ‘freak’ even after my shoulder and leg had healed and he was under no obligation any longer to be around me to carry my bags. Perhaps to shut them up – I guess you can imagine what inventive names they spouted forth whenever they saw me – he pursued this girl whose name I've deleted. She was bright, good public speaker and really knew how to keep his obnoxious friends in check when they offered some lewd comments. They went out for a while during which time I rarely saw him.”
John smiles at them. Rummaging in his wallet, he produces two half crowns, which he hands to the girls. They stare at him wide-eyed. “For us? Do you want more cigarettes, then, sir?”
“Yeah, thought so,” stated John darkly, giving Sherlock a meaningful glance and indicating that Sherlock follow him.
Sherlock is busy with his phone again. John watches him as he sits with a pillow in his back, the curls spread against the headboard. He is frowning at the screen, the light from below making his odd features look even stranger, sharpening his cheekbones and outlining the indecent shape of his cupid’s bow – wait, indecent? Where has this come from? John shakes his head to get rid of the intrusive thought. Nope. Not going there, thank you very much.
“Quite, yes. Uhm ... Sherlock ... I know this might be a bit soon, but would you like to join me here? You must be cold. Also, perhaps we could go through this here together, see if I understand everything correctly. We don’t have to,” John adds quickly, seeing Sherlock tense slightly. “Just a suggestion.”
“Wow, that’s about as remote as it gets, eh?” says John, shielding his eyes against the run as he gazes to the snow-capped peaks rising beyond the lake. “Are there even roads up there?”
“Competent,” Sherlock finishes her sentence. “Indeed. Well, what is it? Do you have any new information concerning our case?”
“Oh yeah, the job you invented for yourself because you messed up a proper academic career by doing drugs and spending a considerable time in rehab?” Daniel strikes back heatedly.
Sherlock gave him a quick look before glancing down at the gel in his hands again. “I’d prefer if you didn’t.”
At the after-dinner team meeting, Greg, Sally and Sam offer to take the riders along the course the next morning. They’ve already studied it on paper. Sam gives them a thorough account on what to expect based on its profile, having ridden it themselves. But apart from them and Sherlock who surveyed it closely during his individual training in spring and early summer, nobody has actually checked it in person. Sherlock does offer some insights when prompted, but on the whole, he appears absent-minded and preoccupied throughout the presentation. He only perks up when Greg talks about the weather. The forecast is troubling. Rain and gusty winds are expected for the late afternoon, which would mean uneven conditions for the riders, disadvantaging those starting later in the day such as Sherlock, and making the track dangerous to navigate, particularly on the descents.
“Speak for yourself.” Sherlock gazed at John, his lips twitching as he was fighting down a smile. “So, cuddling, yes?
John wasn’t appeased. “I hope we’ll meet the moron up at the pass. I’ll take his fucking engine apart.”
Mycroft frowned. “As you did, although in your defence you weren’t an official field agent, more a rogue freelancer.”
“You okay?” asks John. Sherlock looks relaxed and rather tired, but doesn’t seem to be in strong pain.
“Stay behind me,” Sherlock calls to him when John makes an attempt to overtake him and give him a reprieve in the wind.
John shook his head, running a hand through his hair. “Because of what happened this morning? Sherlock, I’ve told you before, I very much enjoyed what we did. It was just the timing that was bad. Nothing you did made me want to leave. On the contrary. Right, okay, I admit I was a bit surprised by your sudden … eagerness. But that didn’t mean I didn’t like it. Come on. You’re the only consulting detective in the world, and you observe and don’t just see, and I assume you feel just as well. You must have felt that ... well ... that I was pretty aroused by your kissing and even more by you sticking your hand down my pants. I had to take a bloody cold shower to function even halfway normally again.”
at them, while on the table where apparently Sherlock is supposed to sit, somebody has made the effort of creating a small arrangement of all things yellow, mostly pasta and bananas, complimented by a stack of national and international newsprint.
As annoying and potentially alarming as it is, of course Sherlock has been right. John isn’t straight. Not quite. Not when it came to James, and not during his mountain bike days. But admitting it, to himself and the world ... He isn’t ready for that, not by a long shot. Perhaps after he’s retired ...
will cope. And Sebastian, despite being my only son, deserves to be punished for being such a stupid, irresponsible brat. You may tell him I said that. Like father, like son. My late husband was an idiot, too, and I wasn’t sorry to see him go – which does not mean I had anything to do with his demise, Detective Inspector. You may strike through the note you just scribbled down. It was a riding accident, and he fell because he was drunk and attempted a jump too dangerous for himself and the horse – the poor creature broke a leg and had to be put down, one of our best stallions. I never forgave him for that. Served him right that he put himself down, too, in a way.
John steps back from the door. Sherlock relieves himself, washes his hands and also his face, before opening the door. “You can come in. I just need to brush my teeth.”
Holmes smiles thinly. “In his opinion, certainly. He has always been so ... contrary. Difficult. Delicate, too.”
John thanks them. “I’ll have a look round there. If you find anything else that seems odd to you, could you let me know? Here’s my number.”
Sarah pats his thigh. “You’ll work it out, I’m sure. You’ve changed, John – for the better. Sherlock is good for you, as you are for him. I have a good feeling about you two.”
John swallowed, stroking the back of Sherlock’s hand with his thumb. “We really should invite Mike for dinner one of these days. You’d have died of poison and because of your bloody need to show off and prove you’re cleverer than the rest of humanity, and I of boredom, feeling no longer needed, or because of risking my life for some idiocy, just to feel alive. God, Sherlock, to imagine I’d never might have met you ...”
His friend’s strange behaviour and its possible implications – because John might not have his skill at deduction, but he could read emotions as well or even better, and moreover could put facts together – were yet another thing John tried not to think about too deeply. The two of them were still caught on the bumpy, pot-hole riddled path of rebuilding their friendship, after Sherlock’s faked death and sudden, miraculous return had bombed a huge crater right into its middle. For the time being, this meant work enough. John certainly didn’t want another set of complications on top of that only because he had come to notice that his friend – or whatever Sherlock was to him – looked good (no, strike that: bloody hot) in tight lycra. Still, the realisation that apparently said friend, Mr. ‘I consider myself married to my work’, thought the same about him
“She died the night before yesterday, or in the early hours of yesterday morning. The coroner said he couldn’t be entirely certain, and Dr. Watson confirmed the approximate time of death,” explains Lestrade calmly and soothingly, holding out a hand to Jim as he takes a few halting steps towards the wall to sag against it, dropping his cigarette to run both hands through his hair and making rather a mess of it. Lestrade draws a small notebook and a pencil from the inner pocket of his jacket.
John shook his head in a mixture of awe and trepidation. “I can’t believe I agreed to join you in this madness. So tomorrow, we go up there? And because cycling up this one mountain which looks pretty steep and intimidating won’t be enough, we’ll be continuing on to yet another, even higher pass?” He whistled softly through his teeth. “Jesus, Sherlock, two thousand metres difference in altitude. That’s over six thousand feet.”
Now John is the one to look surprised, even shocked. He recovers quickly, though, cocking his head slightly to give Sherlock a long, calculating glance.
John turned to him fully, glaring at him darkly. “You know what, if you dare to die before me again, or worse, pretend to, I’ll pile your fucking grave with artificial flowers so you can’t see the headstone anymore. I’ll also sprinkle coloured pebbles around them behind a border of fake grass, and add two of those snow globe-like things with saints in them like you find in Irish cemeteries and a plastic copy of Michelangelo’s David. I’ll also put up a photo of you wearing the deerstalker and surround it by coloured blinking fairy-lights for good measure.”
Sherlock’s lips twitched into a quick smile before drew a deep breath. “Amongst other things, I claimed that sex didn’t alarm me.”
He enjoys discovering natural wonders, he likes scientific riddles, and solving them even more. But he also liked when Father read
Mycroft remains suspiciously silent during their drive along Buckingham Road. John is seated in the front next to the driver, while the Holmes brothers share the back seat. Sherlock would have preferred it otherwise, but since it’s a short drive only, he doesn’t complain. Mycroft seems engrossed in a file on his lap. Sherlock knows this is just for show, to make him start a conversation.
“Sherlock?” prompts Mycroft impatiently. “It’s going to rain soon, and I’d like to go inside and beat granddad at chess.”
“No. I didn’t particularly enjoy it. Not necessarily because she was bad at it. I guess I wasn’t very good, though,” he adds thoughtfully. “But I never wanted to sleep with her.”
Giving John a sideways glance, he smooths some of the folds in his pyjamas. “What happens now?” he asks.
Sherlock holds up one of the shards, then points at the floorboards. John whistles softly. “Do ghosts bleed?”
John grins at him, his heart suddenly light which could be due to the sugar boost from juice and cola, but also from the fact that somehow, he and Sherlock seem to have navigated clear of the cliffs and icebergs that endangered their friendship because of John’s behaviour this morning, and seem to have reached a new level of trust and ease with each other. As John shoots a quick glance at Sherlock’s profile with his sunburned nose and weird chins and indecent lips and intense eyes and posh nose, all topped by windblown, tousled curls, he feels warmth suffuse him. He realises that he really, really likes this odd, outwardly rude but inwardly soft man, and that he doesn’t mind what Sherlock deduced about him, because he feels that his secret is safe with him.
“The man was shot, Dimmock thinks a silencer might have been involved. I don’t trust his judgement, but there must be something strange about the victim for even Dimmock to pick it up. He’s sending photos and what information forensics gathered now.”
Sherlock shrugs. “The case looks to be a five or six at least. That, however, is without taking into account that it involves some members of my family and another feature I am not sure is appropriate for the ... situation right now. You can easily deduct one or two points for that alone.”
Having noticed that John is awake, Sherlock gives him a small smile. He runs a hand through his curls which are particularly funny this morning because Sherlock fell asleep with damp hair, flattened on one side and sticking up chaotically on the other, creating even more of a mess. He looks unsure of a sudden, a touch guarded and with bashfulness creeping into his formerly unconcerned and easily graceful stance. “Good morning,” he says, his voice deep and still rough from sleep.
John grinned to himself. That was a challenge. He might not have Sherlock’s investigative talents, but he did know how to research things online. Also, there was always Mrs. Hudson to ask about Sherlock’s American past, and if she didn’t turn out to be helpful, then Mycroft. An image of Sherlock dressed like the protagonist from Dirty Dancing swirling an elderly, violet-haired lady in a purple dress around flashed through his mind and he chuckled. “Speaking of names ... there’s something your father mentioned.”
“I think I recognise that woman in the immediate background behind Goebbels,” muses John, squinting at the picture – and leaning even closer against Sherlock. “I’m pretty sure she is an actress. One of my mates on my last ship was a big admirer of hers. She has a very distinct voice, deep and dark. I don’t recall the name, though.”
John nods grimly. This is beginning to sound all too familiar. “Have you spoken with Sherlock about it? He’s investigating Moriarty and his team.”
John could tell he hadn’t been listening to him, but had instead been eavesdropping on the lively conversation the five Italians, also already in cycling gear, were entertaining at a nearby table.
chasing them and catching up second by second, John knows that he’s lost by the time he, Fantoft and Achterkamp reach the
John stares at him, then nods. “I should have told you much sooner, to your face. And afterwards, after your return ... I should have treated you differently.”
John shakes his head and smiles fondly. “Of course you did. Actually, I sent your brother’s driver into town, because I was helping Mike at the infirmary and wasn’t sure if the shops would still be open, anyway, on a Saturday after lunchtime. The man was quite happy to leave for a bit instead of standing around here waiting for his master. He doesn’t harbour any hard feelings for us commandeering the car, by the way. Oh, and as for dinner, often leftover pie is even better than on the first day.”
The last mountain stage of the 2018 Tour de France starts in the mediaeval town of Orthez, a short distance from Pau. The weather is hot and sunny but with white clouds clinging to the highest peaks in the ragged blue line of mountains visible to the South. The atmosphere in the peloton is tense as the riders congregate to sign in. The stage is long, over two hundred kilometres. That alone would make it hard, particularly so late in an exhausting stage race. But the fact that it contains five classified climbs, two of which are category one and two even
Sherlock shrugged, brushing mortardust from his coat. “Perhaps they were out of the country, or otherwise detained. Dimmock, check who has recently been released from prison, especially after spending time there for robbery or burglary.”
“Oi, John, are you going to spend the rest of the stage watching telly or are you planning to do some more cycling today?”
“She was already engaged when I met her here. She seemed to be very happy. I never met him because he was away on duty. But then she visited him in London while they were both on leave, and when she returned she’d taken off her ring. That was … two months or so ago. She said she didn’t love him anymore and that’s why she’d ended it. I didn’t want to ask her, but I think she’d fallen in love with somebody else.”
“Actually, it was a gift from the cat,” Sherlock defends himself. “She likes to bring dead things into the house to feed her humans. She seems to have taken to you, so you might receive some in the future.”
“No, it’s the title of Zarah Leander’s film. It was released in ’36 or ’37, I think. I remember reading about it. I didn’t watch it, though, obviously, it being in German and everything. I seem to recall that there was a British remake not long ago, but I didn’t watch that, either. What I do remember, however, is hearing some of the songs from the original film. Jenny used to hum or sing them sometimes and I asked her about them. They were nice.”
“You can tell the Warringtons we’ll be down in a few minutes,” Sherlock calls towards the door. A single knock acknowledges his words, before footsteps recede down the corridor.
“All right.” Brief hesitation, plucks up his courage. “D’you have a boyfriend? Which is fine, by the way.”
Smiling, Sherlock shifts closer and lowers his voice. “Precisely. Victor also said he had a little gift for us but was reluctant to say what it is. He said it’d all be revealed tomorrow.”
John sighs. “Yes, that’s true. But, you know, the problem wasn’t that they assumed we were in a relationship, or that they implied I was gay. That never bothered me, even though the latter isn’t true, strictly speaking.”
John grunted an affirmative, not entirely convinced, but equally excited about the venture, and, as usual, trusting Sherlock to know what he was doing.
“She’s all naked in that one,” pipes up Billy from behind the palm-tree where he has settled down with his wine. “I’ve seen it. Bit skinny for my taste, but nice moves.”
John decided against remarking on the comment about him sulking. “Well, I’m all for cycling again tomorrow if we feel like it. I had actually considered attempting the Col du Glandon and the Croix de Fer since the Italians were so passionate about them, but considering that this would mean we’d have to travel down the valley to Saint Jean to get to the climb it might be preferable to do something in the vicinity. I certainly don’t fancy cycling on the main valley road. But let’s see how we feel tomorrow, yeah?”
The other farmer chuckles. “Or a pitchfork. Here’s to the strapping Land Girls. They at least know how to work.”
John hears a grunt from the American. “Whatever, asshole. Not my fault you jerks don’t know proper language. Anyway, don’t lock the door again from the inside this time.”
“John, please. I’d like to, but I have to check at work first. It’s a difficult time of year to take a few days off. Flu season and all that. But yeah, I’d love to come.”
,” said Sherlock, startling John out of his thoughts. He was holding up his phone, the screen of which showed a picture of the dragon.
He curses when he passes another cairn – one that looks dreadfully familiar. He remembers the white stone somebody placed there. Has he been walking in circles all this time? It’s not impossible. People tend to do so because of one of their legs being dominant and making slightly larger strides. He blows on his fingers, rams his hands into the pockets of his anorak where his right one encounters his phone. He gets it out, wipes fine droplets of mist from the display and wakes it. No signal, still. No message from John, subsequently.
Katie turned to John. “Anything I can do for you, John? I’m afraid we’re not very well equipped with painkillers, just some Aspirin and Paracetamol. If you need anything else, tell me, and I’ll drive to Woodbridge and get it. I’ve got some Voltarol gel, I think, from when a horse stepped on my foot a while ago, and arnica salve which might help your shoulder.”
“Yes. But don’t let yourself be fooled by his public persona – quirky TV personality, sponsor of major sports events, benefactor of hospitals and arts foundations and the like. He is an ice-cold businessman who always puts his own interests first. He and Magnussen have had some major fall-outs in the past. It’s rumoured that Smith took over sponsorship of this team in order to thwart Magnussen Jr.’s attempt to win the Tour.”
Sherlock has refilled the kettle which luckily retained some water so as not to boil dry. He has also opened a window to release some of the steam floating in the air, and is now rummaging in the cupboards for cups, tea and milk powder. Gazing at John as he stands in his new flat, having divested himself of his coat and hat, the gold braid of his uniform glinting faintly in the dim light of the kitchen lamp, Sherlock’s heart leaps once more. This is more than he dared hope for. He can barely comprehend how lucky he is. John is here, in his flat, breathing, warm and solid and real. Sherlock can actually touch him, hug him, kiss him, even. And he wants him to stay, preferably forever.
John exhales loudly. For a moment, neither speaks. Then, to his surprise, Sherlock feels soft, tentative fingers at his chin, lifting his head. “Sherlock, I’d like to make a deduction. Will you correct me if I get it wrong?”
“You left your helmet in the shower,” Sherlock’s voice interrupted his musings and he switched off his phone.
“Yes,” sighs John. “I get them from time to time. I had some after Mary died, but these must have been brought on what happened in the spring. I usually dream I’m drowning, or that I’m locked in a small room with water or fire coming at me. Or I see my friends perish and I can’t help them.” He shrugs. “Unpleasant stuff.”
Still, this is uncanny. Sherlock hates not knowing things. It scares him, sometimes, as do the many impressions deluging him all the time and which he can’t all sort through and categorise. He gets overwhelmed easily, needs time on his own to deal with this overload. And this is even worse. Something strange has happened and Sherlock can’t explain it.
“I don’t know how long this is going to take,” she told him when they were on their way. “But Sherlock has my number, in case you need me to pick you up somewhere. If you need to rent a car for greater mobility, we’d have to get one from Ipswich. I don’t think there’s a car hire in Woodbridge. Oh, here’s the map you asked for.”
“I would have come earlier,” apologises John, “but when I arrived about an hour ago, I was accosted by the police who took down my statement in the Wilson case. The DI said he’d spoken with you and Molly already. I didn’t tell him about the note, however, just what medical facts about her death I had observed. Hope that was all right.”
“Well, our two fast men, Stephen Bainbridge and Harry Lyons, weren’t ideally placed, and two breakaways were still ahead of the sprinters on the last metres. There was a time bonus to be won, so if Victor Trevor had been first across the finish line, he’d be the one in yellow now. Call it experience, call it luck, or just a good nose for an opportunity. An old geezer like me can’t outsprint men like Trevor or Moran. But our ace in yellow obviously can, so I saw to it that he had someone to pull for him until the last metre.”
Sherlock shrugs. “Well, the bed is large enough for two.” He hears John’s soft inhale. Blood rushes into his cheeks. He clears his throat, avoids looking at John. “For sleeping, I mean,” rushes out of him. “Whenever you need to ease your back or shoulder. I didn’t mean to imply—”
John and most of his fellow teammates stay near the head of the peloton to avoid getting caught in an accident. In Saint-Michel, the D902 that will lead them across the passes of Télégraphe and Galibier branches off southwards from their current road. It crosses the broad, stony, ice-grey river Arc via a bridge to then climb in narrow serpentines through the hamlet of Saint-Martin-d’Arc into the woodlands that clad the northern slopes of Col du Télégraphe. John expects attacks to get launched directly after the bridge – and he’s not disappointed. Several riders attempt to jump away, with others sprinting after them to reel them in again. This confusion is used to good effect by Ricoletti who manages to slip away. By the time the other GC teams notice he’s already distanced himself from the peloton by almost half a minute, and he’s fast, being a good, experienced climber with the stamina and will-power of a time trialist. Moreover, should he manage to bridge the gap to the breakaways, there are two of his teammates to look after him: Mario Girotti and Carlo Pedersoli. The teams of Magnussen, Moriarty and Baskerville attempt to close the gap to him in again but instead of working together, they manage to thwart each other in the process. The peloton soon shatters into several groups. Team Speedy’s manages to position Sherlock and Kit with Gregson as their helper with the riders who split from the peloton to form a third group behind the breakaway and Ricoletti. John hangs in there as well, as do most of the GC hopefuls and some of their mountain
Sherlock is grateful for having to concentrate on the road. The visit to Chanctonbury Ring and moreover Tiffany’s words concerning the strange shepherd she saw have shaken him. More memories he thought long buried are rising to the surface again, rattling the locks of their rooms. He must not indulge in them now, but must wait for the privacy of his room at the hotel.
The corner of John’s mouth twitches up in a small smile. Well, perhaps some good will come out of this. He likes to look after Sherlock, and even though Sherlock is going to moan and complain and generally be his drama queen self in the days to come, John is also convinced that secretly, Sherlock enjoys being looked after by John. He allows so few people to get close to him that John feels immensely privileged that he is one of the chosen, that in fact he is the one person Sherlock wants to spend the rest of his life with.
The arm appears to be almost stiff. What Sherlock can see of the man’s haircut doesn’t point towards recent military service, however. The hair is too long for that, partly visible under the hat. He is wearing a thin moustache, too. When he turns his head slightly to blow out a cloud of smoke, Sherlock sees a scar disfiguring his right cheek. Over the distance it looks like a cut, by shrapnel, maybe.
John exhales forcefully. “I know. It’s just ... I hate how the press are giving him barely time to catch his breath. His legs are still shaking so badly he can barely stand upright.”
“No, but many are. Many otherwise honest people have little choice, because the criminals have infiltrated almost every part of life, from waste collection to agriculture to education. And politics, of course. But quiet now, I need to concentrate.”
“I don’t take sugar with tea,” says Sherlock. “Only with coffee.” He muses about his drinking habits. “Bit strange, really. I prefer tea with milk and coffee just with sugar.” Then he frowns. Is he attempting to make conversation? How odd. But then it’s almost one thirty and he’s sitting in a quaint kitchen with a dishevelled looking naval doctor and an old cat, drinking tea.
Sherlock can’t help smiling, while at the same time feeling another frisson of apprehension, of a different kind now. Unbidden, the image of a dark greenhouse appears before his inner eye, accompanied by a feeling of being pinned under a magnifying glass. So that’s what’s been on John’s mind. In Sherlock’s own head, they’ve had this kind of conversation many times, and every one of them was awkward and highly uncomfortable. So now, finally, John has gathered enough courage to confront Sherlock about his romantic history in the real world? Interesting. Scary.
“Their blood simply stopped flowing properly while they were asleep, clogging up the coronary vessels and other vital capillaries,” Sherlock explained to Lestrade as he handed the further investigation of the doping network over to the authorities, his work done. “They used their own blood for doping to increase the transport of oxygen, which is why the drug screening didn’t show any results.”
He breathes deeply and runs a hand through his curls as they are being tousled by the wind. His brother’s words are weighing on his mind. He is still undecided what to do about the entire John situation. He turns to glance at the bed. Naturally, it’s not the one he had as a child. That was replaced by a bed for an adult when he was sent to Harrow, to return during the holidays and the occasional weekend only. A towel, fresh underwear and pyjamas lie there, and a dressing gown he recognises as his own, dating back to his Cambridge days. To distract himself from thoughts about John and the impending night (they could just stay in their respective rooms and that would be it, but something tells him this isn’t going to happen), he closes the window and the curtains again. Switching on the bedside lamp, he walks over to the massive wardrobe and opens it. Linens and an extra blanket are stored there now, but, interestingly, also his old school trunk. He opens it, swallowing when he lays eyes on the contents. More books, a folder with his drawings, several of them maps of London he painstakingly copied when he was about twelve or thirteen, adding in bits of information he gained during his forays into the city. Some clothes, too, mostly from school. Why on earth did his parents keep them? It’s not that he’s ever going to wear them again. It is sentiment? Were they seriously hoping he’d produce a son of his own one day who could inherit the garments?
Today’s stage crosses several départements: Haute-Alpes, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, Var, and Bouches-du-Rhône – some of the most photogenic areas of France. The landscapes are varied: limestone hills grown with
“We only have one free room at the moment due to the girls billeted at our house,” says the landlady. “It has two beds, however, if you don’t mind sharing a room.”
“Understood,” Sherlock and John reply simultaneously, before grinning at each other. John licks his lips, and Sherlock believes he knows what the other is thinking. Sharing a cell with John Watson wouldn’t be too bad, since sharing any room whatsoever with John is good.
His phone remained silent throughout dinner. Likely Sherlock was indeed busy interrogating the two brothers, or else he had no reception again. Like during the car ride, the meal was a quiet, somewhat subdued affair. Emma had already donned her pyjamas and was swathed in a colourful blanket, looking like an oversized paisley caterpillar as she said devouring pumpkin soup, bread and cheese and beetroot salad. John marvelled at her eating the salad, actually. She was the first child of his acquaintance to eat beetroot voluntarily. He vividly remembered the battles his parents had fought with Harry and him. To this day, he wasn’t particularly fond of the vegetable and its somewhat earthy flavour, but he had to admit after carefully trying the salad that it tasted rather nice.
