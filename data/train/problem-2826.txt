Sam thought about it and wrapped his fingers around his watch puppy.  “ ‘iger,” he said as he thought of the animal print band-aid that he had put on Dean’s hand earlier that morning for his booboo.
Sammy didn’t want to talk right now, cause he was eating
SO SORRY I HAVEN'T UPDATED IN FOREVER!!!!
“No,” Sammy giggled and grabbed at Dean’s hand. “I eats my chip. My chip,” Sammy squirms off Dean’s lap and goes to the bag of chips that Cas was holding.
We meet 13 year old Kate Winchester
Dean snorted as he accepted another bite of the sandwich.
, Dean thought with an internal eye roll as Cas hid a smile behind looking busy cleaning up the lunch meal mess.
Cas was the researcher of the two historians so he took over the paperwork, Dean adding in when he felt like it. When they were finished, they headed back out to give the lady the paperwork. When the lady asked them to follow her again, the men followed her to another room that looked like a small courtroom.
Sam huffed a little as he tried to get under the blanket while not realizing that his butt was on top of a corner of the comforter.
“He did!” Daniel gasped as Kate giggled so hard she leaned over on the table.
“Okay,” Daniel Novak said when the family had stayed there for 5 hours and the girl had had no seizures. That was a good thing and she was about the size of a nine year old girl at 4 and a half feet tall.
“Right there,” Dr. Novak nodded ro show his agreement. When Kate nodded, he smiled and stood up. “Alright come on then,” he went to the door and waited for the family. As they were all headed down the hallway, he held his hand out for the scared girl to take. She looked at him and went to walk close to Cas, who was walking side by side with Dean.
“Yeah and almost taller than Daniel!” Kate put her hand in the air to show how tall it was. She nodded when Papa gasped again.
Daniel looked at the mirror to see himself wave. He found small things to make him happy as he smiled. “Yes, it is,” he said. “And there is a camera right there, there and there,” he pointed to the cameras in the corners of the ceiling. He was used to kids being unsure and knowing about how to avoid cameras and two way mirrors from their past lives.
Kate giggled. “Cas wouldn’t let me have a dog! Dogs are too dirty. I  would have to do more chores cleaning up. Daddy would let me have a dog, probably. He walked all over the house the other day in his dirty shoes!”
‘I can do this. I’ve dealt with worse.’ Kate steeled herself as she followed the man in the white coat into the room. ‘It was a nice room I suppose.’ she thought.
Which of course meant it was Sammy’s, so Sammy ate it.
It was a small room with jungle decorated walls. The carpet was a bright red, orange, yellow and green squares with the ABC’s on each square but in a different color than the square it was on. There was a plain white cubby on one wall with baskets in them. To hod, Kate didn’t know what. She followed the doctor to a small round purple table with small blue chairs. When she sat down she noticed the other wall was a mirror but it looked like kids had drawn all over it.
“Hello there Mr. and Mr. Winchester,” A well built man came up to the trio. “Thank you Jess.” The man extended his hand. “I’m Fergus Crowley. Please tell me you didn’t name your child Fergus.”
Once the boy climbed back onto Dean’s lap, Dean let out a burp, satisfied with his meal and stood up. Cas shot a glare up at his partner as Sam let out a giggle behind his casted arm.
“You’re ok kiddo,” Dean said as he gave his poor kiddo’s knee a kiss then his forehead, “What do you say we eat?” Dean asked as he got up and went over to the table and started ruffling a picnic basket Sammy hadn’t seen before.
“Good!” Daniel was always happy when things became official. “Now just because things are settled, it doesn’t mean you can go out and see people. One day she might be 13 then see the same people in a month and have a 5 year old.”
Sammy moved a dirty hand to brush his hair off of his face and gave a wet sniffle. “My k-knee De-de. O-owie De-de. Owie,” he whined as Dean took a look.
“Cas, you’re human now,” Dean reminded him. “You need to eat too.”
“So good,” he moaned and watched Cas look at him with “bedroom eyes.” And if their kid wasn’t in his arms he
“Good,” Kate said and shook the man’s hand, but like most kids, who don’t regularly shake hands, it was a bit awkward and uncomfortable.
“What?” Dean looked over the rim of the computer with suspicion.
Katie falls into headspace and gets her next as Dean and Can make things official.
“No baby, no more,” Cas said as he held the sandwich to the side and out of reach. “Look! Rocket is on the table,” he pointed to said table.
Kate nodded so hard her hair flew around like crazy. She wiped it out of her face and took a breath or two to calm down. She felt relaxed enough to look around the look and saw a basket in the cubbie labeled legos.
Sammy barely heard his brother as he shook his head while trying to attach his lips to the spout of the blue cuppy in his brother’s hand. “Cuppy De-de,” he whined when Dean didn’t give it to him right away.
“Ok,” Dr. Novak said as he signed into the computer and put in an order for the next shot of Alethoura. “So Kate is doing really well. So because of her seizures with the last shot, I want to keep her only for a couple hours,” he reassured the parents. “She should be in the right headspace for a couple days afterwards and things should be fuzzy. And because of the fuzzy she might be a little more tired than usual. But you’ll just have to take a nap then, won’t ya,” he grinned at Kate when she frowned and shook her head. “Well ok then,” he smiled again. “Did you guys get all the paperwork finished?”
It was only when the light started to fade as the sun started to set that Cas finally broke the silence. “Why today?”
Dean closed his eyes for just a moment. Just long enough to think about shifting the fingers cradling his ribs down to brush against the warmth of Cas’s skin. Instead, he opened his eyes and pushed away from the wall.
Sarah reached up to tangle her fingers with Jenny’s on her shoulder, then looked back at Sam. “Where was I?”
“Oh come on, the staring. The sacrificing yourselves for each other. The grieving. You’re raising a kid together. The staring. That’s worth mentioning again because it never stops. Ever.”
Castiel froze.
Dean stared back at him with an expression Castile couldn’t quite pin down. It had hints of the reverence and extreme gratitude Castiel had first seen on Dean’s face when they met.
“Freebird?” Dean asked with a laugh.
“You were... distracted this morning,” Sam said. “And it’s probably not our kinda thing anyway. If you’re not up for it, we can call someone else to take a look at it. I’m sure Mom knows someone out there.”
“Being a judgmental ass,” Cas offered.
“You’re quiet,” Cas said. His voice rumbled in his chest as he trailed his fingertips over Dean’s shoulder and back. Dean nuzzled against Cas’s chest and tightened his grip on the angel’s torso. Cas chuckled. “I thought there would be more yelling when we finally found you.”
The back of Dean’s throat burned.
“Is that not what happened?” Donna asked.
Nicole raised her eyebrows at him. Sam elbowed Dean in the side.
The door opened. Castiel stood there for a moment dressed in a pair of sweats and one of Dean’s old t-shirts. His hair stuck up in all directions like he’d been running his fingers through it. His eyes were red and heavy lidded. He looked exhausted and he held Dean’s bedroom door knob in a white-knuckle grip. He looked miserable and alive. Gloriously alive.
“That’s me,” Scott said. “Who are you?”
Dean grinned.
“We should call Dean and Cas,” Mary said, breaking through Sam’s thoughts. “See if we can split the list of families to interview.”
“Forgive me if I don’t always pay attention to the things you tell me not to do, Dean,” Cas said. “I couldn’t let you die down here by yourself and you know that.”
“Just another Tuesday in the life of Dean Winchester,” he said with a cocky grin and an ache in his chest.
Dean led them further down the row of seats.
“It makes my life easier,” Dean said.
a bad kiss could be when it was with the right person. When it was Cas he was kissing and not someone whose name Dean didn’t know.
“I warned you.”
is an angel kill?” Mary asked. “You mean like…”
His orgasm took him by surprise. One moment he was sucking on Cas’s lower lip, the next his muscles pulled tight as he started to come. His mouth went slack against Cas’s as the orgasm rolled through him.
When he caught himself searching the crowd again, he rolled his eyes.
“There might be,” Cas said. “Did Dillon have any enemies?”
Dean’s pulse picked up. He was thankful the nurse had removed the heart rate monitor from his finger. Shame boiled in his stomach when he realized he was glad Castiel was graceless and couldn't sense Dean’s reaction. He'd stopped trying to figure out for himself if his heart raced because Castiel’s anger scared him or whether it was something… else.
And that was Dean’s cue to turn around and continue toward their motel room home of the month. Because they were not going to have this conversation. There was no reason to talk about what Sam thought he saw in the locker room that afternoon. Or about who he thought he saw Dean with.
“A wash?” Sam asked.
“I wasn’t last night.” Dean grinned at him. Judging by the copper taste in his mouth and Cas’s increasingly worried expression, his teeth were probably covered in blood. “I picked up a milk run case on the way home. It was supposed to be a quick salt and burn.”
Dean tilted his head so he could see the woman speaking in the center of the circle. Her gray hair was pulled back in a low bun and her clothing was somehow casual and severe at the same time. She continued to speak with passion and the kind of presence that reminded Dean of Sundays when his dad had drug him and Sam to visit Pastor Jim’s church.
“This seat taken?” Castiel asked.
“I—I should’ve…” Dean’s vision blurred as his words failed him. He didn’t know what he’d intended to say. That he should have told Cas how he loved him before Lucifer ran him through? How he should have checked in with Crowley sooner to make sure Lucifer was really back in the cage they’d tried to send him to? Looked harder for a way to kill the devil before he could get his greasy mitts on Cas again?
They stood there wrapped in memories and each other until Dean’s body couldn’t resist the urge to shiver anymore. It felt like the marrow in his bones was set to vibrate as Cas cupped Dean’s face again and stepped away. Tears burned rivers down Dean’s cheeks as he stared into Cas’s sad, faded blue eyes.
“Room’s all yours, Cas,” Dean said. “I was just leaving.”
“We—my good friend Carolynn and I—are organizing a protest,” Summer said. “I’ll be donating a portion of the proceeds from the festival to fly us out to the studio that’s trying to put that wicked show on the air.”
Sam stared back at Dean with one of his trademark bitch face expressions.
There was a new email from Dillon, who had also returned fully human. He’d sent Castiel pictures from a trip to Puerto Rico he had gone on with Scott and Ashley. They’d gone down there for a vow renewal slash trio marriage ceremony. Their relationship was unconventional, but they seemed overjoyed to be together at last.
When Dean first caught sight of Cas standing there in front of him whole and gloriously alive once more it felt like the universe ground to a halt around them. There was no sound save for Dean’s heartbeat in his ears. For the first time that he could remember it didn’t matter to him who else was in the room with them all he saw was Cas.
“You told me that one time when you were drunk after giving me a sloppy kiss on the cheek and then panicking for five minutes about what it meant,” Cas said.
“Yeah, tell me about it,” Sam said. He shuffled through his stack of papers again and handed Dean a flyer he’d printed out advertising the festival. ‘1990s Movies With Angels Festival’ was written in bold script across the top of the flyer. Every Saturday of the month there was a different film scheduled. The first weekend was
Castiel closed his eyes again.
How was he supposed to explain to the woman who’d taken him in and given him a life when he’d lost everything, including his memories, that he’d burst into tears at the sight of a man in a tan trenchcoat in the middle of their dinner rush? They weren’t little tears either. It wasn’t just a watering of the eyes that had struck him numb and broken in the midst of the diner. He was full on sobbing by the time his knees had hit the tile of the men’s bathroom and he’d retched up anything and everything in his stomach.
“Your call,” Sam said as he started gathering his stuff to head out on the road.
Dean stared at him.
Memories and fantasies began to blur together as he touched himself. His thighs flexed when he thought back to all the people he’d had ride him in this car and the people he’d imagined riding here. Then there were the people he’d ridden on this seat.
“He’s not really watching them,” Dean said. “Not exactly.”
“Sam,” Cas said.
Dean narrowed his eyes and turned in his seat to watch Ricky leave. The waiter was swinging his hips as he walked. Any other time it would be mesmerizing, today it made Dean's stomach sour with something that tasted like jealousy.
Dean swallowed.
Roughly twelve hours later, Dean and Cas woke up in a disorienting tangle of naked limbs, sheets, and pillows on Dean’s bed as Sam kicked in the door, flipped on the overhead lights, and started blaring Etta James’s “At Last” from a Bluetooth speaker he’d picked up a few months before.
“Wild boars with big tusks,” Jenny said holding her fingers up in front of her mouth to mimic the tusks. “They’re mostly harmless, but they’re big and travel in packs and if they think you’re there to mess with their babies they’ll charge at you.”
“What do you want?”
“Shut up, Sam,” Dean said as he stood up. “I’m gonna go get us more drinks.”
“Does that guy look see-through to you?” Dean asked.
“You went back to the theater?” Cas asked as he stared at Dean. “What happened to waiting for us to get here?”
Mary and Sam left the diner first. Dean and Cas stayed behind to pay the bill. Dean wished he was surprised to see Ricky’s phone number scribbled on the back of the receipt when the waiter handed it to him. He folded the paper up and shoved it in his wallet. He’d burn it later.
(Art by
Dean stared at his brother.
“Not the time, Sammy.”
“Yeah, unless we want to end up shot by some trigger-happy rent-a-cops,” Dean said. “We could always flash our badges to them now.”
“Cas and I have become very close, yes.”
Cas cupped the side of Dean’s head with his empty hand and started to dab at the top of Dean’s head.
Cas tilted his head and stared back at him. “Dean.”
“She turned full-on lesbo,” the hunter said. “Moved to Illinois and started banging some chick. She was married to that guy Harper for a while. You remember him?”
“No, Dean,” Sam said. “You need a break.
that Jessie and her boyfriend wanted entirely different things out of life. Why couldn’t she see it?
Dillon started to slowly shake his head. He mumbled words Castiel didn’t catch and started to rise into the air with a flap of his wings. There was no breeze coming off his wings as they moved, something about that disturbed Castiel more than anything else they’d seen.
“The frame wouldn’t fit in the Impala,” Sam said. Dean scowled and started mentally rearranging things in the car so the framed poster would fit on the drive back to Kansas. Sam waved a hand in front of his face. “Forget the poster. Aren’t we supposed to be here getting clothes for Cas?”
When Cas popped into their motel room unannounced it was all
“It’s a little different, but yeah,” Dean said. He changed the playlist on his phone to some slower songs that he may or may not listen to whenever he was thinking too much about his angel and wanting to wallow in the sensation for a while. After a deep breath, he held out his hand. “Come here, Cas.”
When Dean got caught up in the library patting his pockets looking for his car keys and a chest compressing, tunnel vision panic attack at the memory of losing all of his memories brought him to a gasping standstill. It was Castiel who came rushing to his side. It was Castiel who pulled him into a tight hug and repeated the words
“Drive,” Cas shouted as he threw himself into the backseat of the Impala and slammed the door shut.
“But what, Dean?”
The hospital tile was white with streaks of gray in it. Something industrial and easy to clean up. He studied the floor like it was a new exorcism he’d yet to master.
“Looks like it,” Sam said. His expression betrayed exactly what he thought about Dean including Cas in the family reunion comment.
“Dean?” Cas called out as he raced across the war room and up the stairs to Dean’s side. “What happened? I thought you’d finished with the vampire nest in Abilene last night. You didn’t mention getting injured.”
He laughed long enough that Sam shifted his weight and started to question if he really did see Dean and Cas kiss that morning or if he’d somehow hit his head on his run and hallucinated it all.
Sam -- Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
Three hours after leaving the diner, Dean parked the Impala down the street from their last obituary lead. Cas was in the passenger seat, getting more and more frustrated with each fruitless interview.
Lips. That brought back memories to the waitress from a month ago. She was pillowy soft from her lips to her, well,
“Really?” Summer asked. Her eyes widened, an expression amplified by the glasses she wore. She cleared her throat and nodded slowly. “Well, it’s been interesting meeting you both, but I believe I have another engagement to get to. Best of luck with your research.”
An embarrassing, fuzzy warmth spread through Dean’s chest. He looked around the bar to see if anyone had noticed him being the weirdo giving his phone heart eyes. The liquid happy in his veins took over as liquid courage and he was typing out
Before long, Dean had finished the article and was deep into the interview with the action star from the cover. The guy had a scruffy beard with a twisted smile and bright, light colored eyes. Dean couldn’t name the movie the guy was promoting if he had a gun to his head. He swallowed hard as his pulse hammered in his ears.
Cas took a sip from his own mug.
Cas pulled a hanger off the metal rack in front of him and held it up at arm’s length. “Do you think this would fit me?”
“Those dickheads were throwing empty beer bottles at the poor little javelinas. That’s why the herd charged at us.” She turned to look at Jenny with narrowed eyes. “Worst anniversary date, ever.”
so far.”
Cas stared back at him impassively.
“Private business,” Dean said before he could catch himself.
Since Chuck had restored Dillon as a human, Castiel and Dillon had grown close. Much closer than they’d been in Heaven as fledglings. Castiel was thankful that he had a brother who could empathize with his choice to fall for love. And someone he could vent to when Dean or life as a human got too grating.
Sam had spent more than enough time living with Dean in situations that gave both of them little to nothing in the way of privacy. He’d suspected since he was a young teenager that his older brother liked guys too, but he’d never had real proof. Still, suspicions and instincts concerning Dean’s feelings about Cas weren’t reason enough to out Dean to their mom. Or anyone. It wasn’t Sam’s place.
One of those blades appearing in the middle of the man’s chest. Dean’s own voice screaming in desperate agony. Blue-white light pouring from the man’s chest, eyes, mouth. Dean hitting his knees in the sand next to the man’s prone body.
“Only on Tuesdays,” Dean said with a grin.
They watched in silence for several minutes before Dean finally worked up the courage to lean over and rest his head on Cas’s shoulder. He caught sight of Cas’s smile in the tv screen as Cas tilted his head so it rested on Dean’s.
“I’m fine,” Dean said immediately. He caught himself in the lie and sighed. He took a sip of his coffee and settled back into the padded seat of the booth. “It’s been awhile since we’ve seen either of them.”
Cas shrugged.
“It’s like a creek, but bigger,” Jenny said. “During monsoon season in the summer washes fill up really quick and tend to flood over. If you get stuck in one during a storm, you’re likely to get washed away in a flash flood.”
Dillon smiled a distant, disturbing smile. “I dreamed. I dreamed of leaving Heaven. Of falling in love and falling from grace. It was beautiful Castiel. Then… I died and I kept dreaming.”
“Sam got the number of the woman behind the film festival,” Dean said. “You two should meet with her and get a feel for whether this is a hoax or not. Cas will come with me. Sam and I looked through the obituaries from the last couple years for anyone who looked similar to the ghost angel we saw in the theater.”
The smile that spread across Dean’s face was like the sun rising over a nightmare filled night. Dean jumped from his seat while wrestling with his wallet. He threw a few bills on the table before grabbing Castiel’s hand.
“I don’t know how to do that, Dean,” Cas said. “Why don’t you tell me what it’s like not to think, since you have so much experience with it.”
“Have you seen Castiel this morn—,” Sam’s voice cut through the warm silence of Dean’s room from the now open bedroom door. “Ah, never mind.”
When he’d had enough of the water, he leaned over to set the bottle on the bedside table behind the bowl of water. He tapped the rim of the bowl and looked back at Cas. “What’s this for?”
Dean moved to sit in the car automatically. Castiel swearing was still a rare enough occurrence to make Dean a bit nervous and a bit… other things that he wasn’t going to study to closely. Castiel closed the door with a dissatisfying, hollow thud. Dean grumbled to himself about stupid new plastic and aluminum cars as Castiel thanked the orderly and made his way around to the driver’s side.
Cas’s sarcastic irritation melted into a smile that Dean could only call loving. Cas’s right hand curled against Dean’s cheek and he traced along Dean’s bottom lip with his thumb.
“When Sam first started coming with dad and I on hunts, he had nightmares,” Dean said. Castiel’s movements stilled enough to let Dean know that he was listening. “We came up with a… I don’t know what you’d call it. A mantra, I guess. Just a few words I’d tell him when he woke up from those nightmares to help him calm down. Help him keep his head in the game.”
“Whatever stupid plan you’re thinking up now, I won’t go along with it if it means that you’re staying here,” Cas said.
“Dean, that’s enough,” Cas said. “Mr. Allen, I don’t know how much Dillon told you about us, but I can assure you I am not like one of the angels who was sent to bring him back to Heaven.”
“Cas?”
Dean lost himself in the kiss. In the feel of Cas’s hands clutching Dean’s hair and back like Dean was something precious and worthy of cradling.
“Sure man, we could use the help on this one,” Detective Baum said. He called off his team and cleared some space for Sam and Mary to approach the body.
Dean tilted his head as best he could so he could speak the words somewhere between Castiel’s temple and his ear.
Cas nodded and looked down to watch Dean’s feet as Dean began to move. Cas took small steps. His brow was wrinkled, and his feet landed heavily with each step. Like dancing was a math problem he needed to solve.
“You know what did this, don’t you?” Mary asked.
“Nope,” Sam said. “This isn’t for you.”
Murmurs of agreement ran through the prayer circle.
Dean’s attention tore away from Cas and the world came rushing back into focus. The band was taking a break and the waitress was grinning at Dean and Cas as she set their glasses down on the table.
“Maybe you do know what it’s like, Agent,” Scott said as he looked from the door to Dean.
Dean shook his head. “I’m sorry. I don’t know you.”
“Well, that asshole was a bust,” Dean said. He took a seat across from Sam and kicked his feet up on the table. “Let’s never call him again, by the way. Homophobic piece of shit was trying to pimp me out so I could fuck the gay out of some hunter chick.”
Cas shifted on Dean’s lap until his own erection was pressed against Dean’s hip, making Dean moan into Cas’s mouth as they continued to kiss. Dean hoped this wouldn’t be the only time they got to do this. The list of things he wanted to do to and with Cas was too long and varied for it to only happen once.
“You were bleeding internally. I wasn’t going to let you die just because you want to coddle me, Dean.”
“Dean, wait,” the man said.
Sam laughed and held up his hands.
Castiel hummed and seemed to lean into the touch.
“Dean,” Cas said. His words were calm like the ocean covering a dangerous riptide. “I can understand you wanting to wait to talk, but do you really expect me—us—to wait until we’re back at the bunker to share another kiss? After all this time you want us to wait after one kiss where I was caught off guard?”
Cas grumbled.
Sam froze.
“Becky was a sweet girl,” Dean said, truthfully. “She just had a thing for dolls and Sam is terrified of clowns, so it never would have worked out between them.”
“Why, Dean?” Cas asked, his tone dangerous. “Because I’m the one who refuses to acknowledge his feelings? I already told you how I felt and you called me family again. You’ve made it very clear you have no interest in returning my feelings so why am I the idiot here?”
“That sounds fascinating,” Ricky said. “Let me know if you need another research partner.”
“Smitings like this have saved mine and Dean’s lives a bunch of times,” Sam said, he met Mary’s eyes before continuing. “Cas has saved us many times by smiting people.”
“He’s not my…” Dean closed his mouth with an audible click when he saw Sam’s reaction to Dean’s words. “Fine, but don’t bitch at me later about how I left all the ‘hard work’ to you.”
Dean’s eyes lingered on Cas’s hands. They’d healed him, pulled him out of danger, even hurt him a few times. Each time they grazed his skin, they left an impact on Dean. Like a tattoo or a bruise of emotion deep in his bones. In his soul.
“We’re in town for business,” Cas said.
“Let’s go, Cas,” Dean said.
“Not directly, no,” Nicole said. “She’s close friends with the woman behind it, Summer Bloom. It’s Summer’s baby, she spent the past year trying to get it organized. Carolynn helped out now and again, but she’s more involved with her charity work than this.”
Scott’s eyes flicked to Dean and back to Cas.
Draped over the thin metal hanger was a long piece of dark fabric covered in gold sequins. The sequins shimmered in the overhead fluorescent lighting. Cas’s expression was devoid of nuance, all blank and unreadable.
“Peachy,” Dean said. “Let’s go buy tickets for this stupid movie, then deal with Cas’s riled up sibling.”
“If it was such a quick, easy hunt, why are your ribs broken?”
“Why the hell did you come after me?” Dean asked.
Dean laughed.
Robert, the cook at the diner with his dark hair pulled back in an ever-present ponytail, would melt away to a quiet, tall man with long hair who would alternate between studying a laptop and sleeping soundly against the window. If it wasn’t the tall man, Robert would melt away to reveal a surly-looking college student with dark hair and hurt eyes whose arms were constantly curled around a backpack.
“No,” Cas said. “You gave me an excuse and I don’t understand it. Why would I want to bring Ricky up to our room? Why are you trying to run away from me?”
“Scott Allen?” Dean asked.
He shrugged, helpless.
“I think you pressed the wrong piec--”
“You said ‘fuck you’ and I said okay,” Cas said. “If you are offering to have sexual relations with me, then I accept.”
“No, you didn’t,” Dean said. “I don’t know what’s wrong with that guy or how he ended up as a ghost, but I know two things.” Dean pushed Castiel down the row of seats toward the aisle of stairs. “You didn’t cause whatever the hell that was. And I know how to wake him up from this nightmare.”
“You're a selfish ass,” Castiel said. “You're always right there ready to sacrifice yourself and you never think about those of us who are trying to save you.”
“It’s my job,” Dean said, his voice cracked over the last word.
Dean tightened his grip on Cas’s hand and held the door to the thrift store open for him. Cas gave him a small smile as he brushed against Dean’s chest while walking through the door. Dean followed after with his own growing smile. This whole thing between them, the thing where they held hands and kissed, was still new and left Dean breathless more often than not.
Yeah, right.
Dean winced as he straightened back out in his seat.
The kiss was deep and slow and paired with wandering hands and tangled legs. It felt like they kissed for hours, rolling around in the hotel sheets together, whispering
“Wooing pretty professors and convincing them to be my date for the awful red carpet parts of the job.”
Dean laughed harder.
“Yeah, I’ll call him,” Dean said with a sigh. “It’ll probably go straight to voicemail, though.”
Dean let his eyes close. Being horizontal helped the pain in his ribs. He opened one eye and peered at Cas. “You didn’t try healing me, did you?”
When they reached the theater there was a line wrapping around the building. Dean stopped in his tracks and stared at the line of people with slumped shoulders.
“Sam, we do not have any more time. The orb is beginning to shake,” Cas said. “How do I stop it?”
Learning that Ricky was a troubled teen William had taken in under his wing added to those conflicting feelings. Dillon had told Castiel that Ricky was, technically, Ashley’s stepbrother. They were more like friends than siblings, though.
Technically, it was Castiel’s entire team who were responsible for rescuing Dean from his captors, but Dean and his family always gave the credit to Castiel alone.
“I was just remembering something,” Mary said. She looked back at her plate. “From when you were little. You’ve probably forgotten it, but it’s still fresh for me. I just got lost for a moment, sorry.”
Dean blinked.
He also didn’t know why thoughts like that kept coming to him. Like he was holding strangers up against a man he didn’t know to judge their worth.
Dean opened his mouth then closed it again, tightly. He nodded his head. Kinda deserved that one.
“Good call, kid,” Dean said as he slid the glass and metal shaker cup across the table. “Milkshakes are delicious.”
They reached their orgasm together with soundless screams, having trained to keep quiet as to not attract unwanted attention. Castiel collapsed on top of Dean, his orgasm and the alcohol creating a comfortable buzz in his body that made him lax and pliable.
With a peck on the lips and a whispered
“Are you telling me that your boyfriend is possessing someone?” Bobby questioned, as his face started verging on angry.
“And what about dad?” Dean couldn't help but ask.
Silence. Both Castiel and Sam stared at him like he had grown three heads. Dean rolled his eyes. “I mean, there are thousands of seals, it’s impossible to know which ones the demons are gonna break. So we let them break. Until we reach the last seal. We put all of our time down to finding the last seal and then we protect the Hell out of it and try to find a way to undo
So, Feathers & Gunpowder's Season 4 storyline is almost finished and then it's right onto season 5 (Yay!) Season 15 is finished (shooting at least, airing will continue for a while) and I'm honestly nervous.
“Everyone.” She responded before she paused and shook her head in dismissal. “Forget it. It’s stupid.”
Julia sat up straighter in her chair when Anna responded. “Warn who?” She questioned, studying the young woman in the hospital bed.
Julia shrugged in response to Dean’s comment. “We think she may have planned this, waited behind the door.” She recounted.
“I just want to know: That brand on your shoulder, where does it come from?” The younger asked.
Castiel smiled. “Of course.” He replied, a promise that warmed Dean’s heart. The two shared a quick kiss before saying goodbye. “See you later, Nerd.” Castiel said, Dean’s old slipping off his tongue like it hadn’t been 30 years since he last called him that.
“Hey.” Dean heard Sam greet the demon, but Dean couldn’t tell if his voice was happy, angry or sad.
Dean chuckled and pressed a kiss to Castiel's cheek. His smile quickly dropped as he quietly spoke, "Uriel has Anna's grace." He leaned into his fiancé's arms and let himself be held.
Dean chuckled silently, hearing Castiel’s voice echoing in his ears before he nodded and turned around, Sam doing the same. “What do you think?” Dean questioned in a whisper, waiting for a second opinion on Anna, even though Dean’s 99.8% certain that Anna Milton was the same Anna as the angel Castiel had been under the command of.
“Wendigo.” Dean answered, from the corner of his eyes seeing the shock on Sam’s face when he answered so quickly. “Got a couple of big leads.”
Sam cut her off. “Yes. I know. He broke in Hell and picked the knife up himself. Anything to make the pain stop.” Something in Sam’s eyes -- a light perhaps? -- changed and his eyes looked heartbroken as he thought of the night-terrors Dean had almost every night.
“Might be.” Sam answered with a small shrug and leaned back in the rickety, old chair he had taken from the kitchen and was sitting in as he researched.
He thought of his most painful memories; when he lost his wings. Not when Michael cut out his grace, he had lost his wings long before that. Lucifer had cut them off before God locked him in the cage; Lucifer had experimented on how to break an angel the easiest, using the angels’ most sensitive parts to do so.
“No.” Castiel answered. “She has to die.” He declared and Dean's suspicions were confirmed.
Faintly, Dean heard Anna scream, but his eyes were focused on Alastair. “Ah, so you do recognize me even with the pediatrician?” Alastair tilted his head and seemed to stare at Dean’s soul. The green-eyed hunter self-consciously tried to shy away, but it was hard to control one’s own soul. “You seem… different from what you looked like in Hell.”
The hazel-eyed Winchester nodded. “Well, she saw a kid’s shrink, got better and grew up normal.” He explained.
“Sam, I’ve been to Hell. What do you want me to say?”Dean asked, softly stopping Sam from saying anything else.
“Both cars are in the driveway.” Sam responded and nodded to where the two cars stood in front of the garage.

With love, Jupiter Mountainstone
Castiel smiled brightly before pulling back from Dean and slipping his normal blank face into place. He nodded towards Bobby, as if to say goodbye and show his respect, before wings fluttered and he disappeared.
Sam sighed and rolled his eyes. “Dude, you’re confusing reality with porn again.” He light-heartedly scolded Dean before continuing. “Look, Anna didn’t say who her dad was. She just kept repeating that this real father of her’s was mad. Very mad -- like wanted-to-kill-her mad.”
"Sorry, kiddo. Why don't you go run to daddy?" Alastair smirked at the fear in Castiel's eyes. He opened his mouth and began to exorcise Castiel, using an old spell to do so. "Potestas inferna, me confirma. Protestas inferna, me confirma. Potestas inferna, me confirma!" He chanted, and bright light shone from Castiel's eyes as he was beginning to be pulled from his vessel.
“Coma girl? Slowly rotting on the floor back at the cabin with Anna, so I've got to hurry back. See you when you get there. Go!” She commanded and watched as Sam and Dean climbed through the bathroom window, just like she told them to. As she left the destroyed room, she couldn't help but smirk. Everything was going according to her plan, Lilith would be dead in no time and Lucifer would rise. She had Sam wrapped around her finger.
Dean chuckled lightly as he put the phone between his shoulder and chin to tie his shoelaces. "I've never liked Uriel either." He agreed.
my relationships are toxic (including the one to my mom). The only relationship I have that isn't toxic (what I can think of) is the one to my dad and to my cat.
Anna looked at him with a raised eyebrow as she replied, “Sure.”
Usually, Dean didn’t mind reading. Sure, before his memories were back he’d rather be out interrogating witnesses and going to bars than go to the library. But the fact that he’s been reading non-stop for 2 days was driving him insane. And they hadn’t found anything about the seals. Nothing. Nil. Nada.
“No, you’re right, Anna.” Sam spoke and looked at the young woman with apologetic eyes. “Is there something you want to tell us?” He asked, hoping she could tell them something that cleared the mess up.
(See the end of the chapter for
With his hand on the doorknob, Castiel stopped and looked back at his fiancé with a warm, genuine smile. “Nannaeel nonci hoath.” He spoke.
Dean snapped back into reality when Sam angrily spoke. “And? Anna's an innocent girl!”
Castiel hesitated, but a small spark of warmth in his grace showed his agreement.
“What?!” Dean almost yelled as he fully woke up. He scrambled up onto his feet and started frantically collecting his clothes. He had been gone for over 24 hours and Sam and Bobby was probably worried.
Sam shook his head. “Feelings are overrated if you ask me.” He spoke.
With the tiny amount of grace Castiel gave him, Dean had some of his angel senses and he could feel the Earth moving, both around the sun and around it’s own axis. He could feel a flower bloom in Japan and an avalanche in the Alps. Creation and destruction.
“Nothing.” Sam spoke through his chuckle. He quieted and spoke, “Sorry. It’s just… I can relate.”
Dean recognized the exorcism and immediately rushed over to protect the angel. "Don't you fucking touch him!" Dean screamed as he hit Alastair with a crowbar he picked up from the floor and stopped the exorcism.
Dean -- as Heaven’s master of Enochian sigils, spells and artifacts -- opened his mouth to answer, but was cut off by Ariel.
Dean looked back at Ariel and knew what she meant even though she didn’t say it; she felt like she was taking over his job when he fell, like she was replacing him. Guilt swelled up in Dean’s stomach and he covered his discomfort by taking a drink from his beer.
Dean thought to himself. But instead of saying it out loud, Dean just smiled at the dark-haired angel.
Anna gracefully sat up in the bed and looked between the brothers -- Dean was helping Sam up from where Sam had landed on the floor -- and Missouri who was looking at her cautiously.
“Or what?” Sam asked, feeling the trepidation being joined by unease, curling in his stomach.
Woohoo! Another chapter while sleep deprived! Sorry if nothing makes sense, when I'm tired my writing tends to get sloppy and weird.
With his plate empty and his cup half full, Dean sat back and looked out of the window. It wasn't much to look at, just the diner’s parking lot and the small road beyond it.
Missouri, who had looked concerned when she read Dean’s mind as he compared his and Anna’s experiences, asked her, “So, you forgot you were an angel?”
Bobby clapped him on the shoulder with a warm smile. “I’m glad you’re okay, boy.” Bobby leaned back in his seat just as one of the waitresses came up to their table.
“Where's the knife?” Ruby asked when she saw neither Winchester pull out the knife.
“There,” the man said, his dark voice momentarily catching Dean off guard. “Jimmy Novak, as you requested.” He continued.
As Sam ripped her clothes off, he couldn't think that Dean would've been a better fit for her than he was. They crawled into the backseat of the car and continued stripping their clothes. Their lips stayed sealed together as the car rocked in time with their movements.
Ruby huffed loudly. “Sounds dangerous.” She replied.
The angels that Anna killed (Niki, Paul, Freddie, Stan, Kim, Alan, Kim and Marilyn) are all based of deceased celebrities:
, Dean thought. “Like... right now?” He asked aloud, hearing only silence from the angel radio in his own head.
Sam frowned at him, while Bobby scowled angrily. “You’re gonna risk your life for something you don’t even know anything about?” He asked angrily. He had just come back, was he going to die again due to his selflessness?
Dean felt anger course through his body at Uriel’s comment, the description ‘Daddy’s good little soldier’ echoing in his head. He clenched his jaw and saw Castiel sending him an apologetic from the corner of his eye. “Well sorry boys, looks like the plans have changed.” He growled.
“Illinois.” Castiel answered, simply.

good at sympathising and offer comfort.
“Oh really?” Balthazar questioned, well aware of the archangel’s former plans that quickly got screwed up. His idiotic strategies is why he didn’t become a soldier and instead became Heaven’s master of Enochian spells, sigils and artifacts.
Sam's bright smile dimmed, but a determined edge shone from his eyes. “I don't care about dad. It's not him this is about. You're the one coming out, not him. And he's just one of thousands of asshole too blinded by their fear of differences between people to see what everyone else sees; love. And as for the transsexuals and nonbinary, our bodies are just shells meant to hold us; it's our soul that truly identifies as who we are.”
It was late, sometime around 3 in the morning and Dean was still awake. But to be fair, he had been sleeping earlier, he was only awake because of a nightmare.
Castiel lightly pushed Uriel out of the way. “Look, I understand that this is regrettable.” The blue-eyed angel said.
“Hey! Stop it!” Anna told the hunter and the demon in a loud and strong voice, the same voice she used when she was a commander in Heaven.
Making up his mind, Dean ate his burger slowly, enjoying the feeling of his stomach being filled. He slowly sipped his coffee and picked at the skin around his left ring finger, trying to twirl the ring that was no longer there. His engagement ring. A band of white gold, covered in sigils to shrink or grow to the perfect size to fit his vessels or his true form. Castiel had proposed to him in 1887, on a warm summer afternoon in London.
“I know. But… let him know that he has people who wants to help, alright?” She told Sam in a soft voice.
Dean briefly sat his beer down to pick up one of his own books Castiel had dropped off, one about Heaven’s weapons. He opened it to a random page and saw a hand drawn picture of the Michael Sword.
Dean and Sam were in a bar, hustling some pool. Sam appeared to be drunk, tricking their opponent to place more money in the game.
The younger of the two shook his head, causing his long hair to flop over his face. “No. She hasn't. Probably thinks Alastair is watching us and doesn't want him to find Anna. So until she thinks we're safe, we should lay low and wait for her to contact us.”
“Castiel?” Dean’s voice was hoarse as he looked at the angel in front of him. Said angel looked at him, frowning at the use of his name; he hadn’t told Dean his name yet. He didn’t have time to react as Dean leant forward and kissed him deeply. The angel quickly pulled away, was about to yell at him. But Dean’s soft Enochian whisper stopped him. “Ol hoath…”
“What happened to staying away from Ruby, huh? I thought you promised me you weren’t going to drink demon blood anymore.” Dean hissed out, letting his younger brother know just how unhappy he was with the case, but the underlying feeling of worry for Sam was what bubbled up the most.
“That’s not funny, Dean.”
Dean turned to look at the pot now sitting there full and ready. Maybe the coffee would help warm him up. Dean turned back to Cas to offer him coffee out of habit when he realized the kitchen was empty again. His shoulders slumped. He reached into the pocket of his dead guy robe and ran a finger over the edge of the mixtape he’d taken from Cas’s body.
“I rebuilt his body from a cellular level when I pulled him out of hell. Part of that process was retrieving his memories from where they’d retreated in his soul and returning them to places his working memory could access them in his mind.”
Cas looked at Sam like he was the last lifeboat on the Titanic floating away without him. Sam muttered something about hoping the goo obscured the view into the cars from the outside so he wouldn’t need brain bleach. Dean’s frown deepened.
“Tell me what you want, Cas.”
“What’s that face for?” Dean asked.
Dean closed that app too and headed toward the library; maybe Sam had finally found something.
“That’s not really what I meant when I told you to find band t-shirts,” Dean said.
Castiel made a noise in the back of his throat and turned his head against Dean’s collarbone once more. His body began to shake gently in Dean’s arms. Dean closed his eyes and swallowed hard.
Sam sat back in his chair and looked at Dean with his head cocked to the side.
Watching Cas learn to move was entrancing.
“I’m not hungry.”
“Is this my jacket?” Dean asked, his voice rough and thick with slowing tears.
“Here,” Sam said as he clicked around on his laptop for a bit before turning it around so Dean could see the screen. “This is a video I found under the tag. I think it’s from the theater that night and it looks nothing like technical difficulties to me.”
“Fuck, okay, you’ve made your point,” Dean said. He stared up at Baby’s headliner as he struggled to swallow against the lump in his throat.
Sarah shook her head once. “Uh, no, I basically got away from it as quick as I could and called in an anonymous tip to 911. I’m not the kind of person who goes poking around dead bodies.”
Castiel continued to stand in the doorway. His eyes flicked from Dean’s face, around Dean’s room and back again. Dean continued to watch him. Memorize the way he stood there whole and unharmed and alive.
Scott ignored him and continued staring at Cas.
Cas’s eyes narrowed, but he returned Dean’s grip on his hand fiercely.
Finally, Castiel caught sight of Dean huddled over a bottle of cheap whiskey in a little two person booth on the far wall of the bar.
William had helped Ricky get a handle on the addictions that had plagued him as a teen and assisted Ricky in paying for nursing school. He was only a semester away from being able to quit his job as a waiter and start working at a hospital when Kushiel had taken possession of William and changed Ricky’s life.
Dean laughed.
Scott’s eyebrows raised. He looked over their badges, then opened the door wide enough for Dean and Cas to go inside.
“Right,” Sam said.
“Yes,” Dean said. “Whatever the hell you want, yes.”
He’d get this out of the way and then maybe he could finally sleep. There was no reason to take a lot of time playing with himself. All he needed was a quick and business-like jerk-off session and he’d be fine.
“Get out of my house,” Scott said.
His blue eyes widened as he stared back at Dean. He stared long enough that Dean began to fumble through his mind for a way to smooth over what he’d just admitted. A way to salvage what he’d inevitably just ruined.
“I don’t know,” Dean said as he struggled to contain his laughter. “You picked up some unknown, probably dangerous orb in a factory where ten people have died in the last five years. We were all nearly killed or eaten by creatures with tentacles coming out of their faces and voices like Gilbert Godfrey. I swear a week passed while we were in the warehouse, not just an hour. Oh, and, best part. The thing you picked up that could have definitely been some kind of alien bomb? It exploded. All over the inside of my car. I’ll never be able to get this shit out.”
Summer was wearing a white silky blouse that created a stark contrast between the deep, unnatural tan of her skin. Her skin reminded Sam of the aged leather look some people who were naturally pale got when they spent decades of their life tanning. Around her neck she wore a large bronze, crystal, and turquoise cross.
“I do,” Dean said. He pulled down and considered Cas’s shirt again. “Though it is a little weird that she’s staring at me like that.”
Dean turned.
“My son has feelings for another man or angel or whatever and he’s hiding it from me,” Mary said. “Like I said, I don’t understand you boys, but doesn’t he know that I’d support him?”
“It’s hashtag, angels among us, Dean. Not pound sign,” Sam said. “It’s a tag that started on Twitter minutes after these supposed technical difficulties happened. And get this, the tag originated in this small town in Arizona. People got on their phones and started tweeting about whatever it was they saw at the theater.”
“Let’s try,” Dean said.
Sam stared at Dean with his mouth open for a moment before snapping his mouth shut and shaking his head.
It was late and dark when Dean finally gave in to his heavy eyelids and pulled the Impala off the highway to park for the night. Stars dotted the night sky outside Baby’s windows as Dean stretched out on the driver’s seat using his folded up jacket as a makeshift pillow. Moonlight lit her interior with an ethereal glow.
“I-I’m here,” Cas said. He sounded tired and worried. “When you say like a ghost…”
He nodded once.
“Okay,” Dean said as he stood up, taking the mug with him. He used it to gesture at Cas while he spoke. “No more coffee for you today. Did you even eat anything before drinking all that? You know what, nevermind. I’m going to make some breakfast and you are going to drink water until your brain has stopped traveling at the speed of light.”
Sam nodded.
“We know you do,” Sam said as he looked away from the tablet screen and settled back into his chair. He looked at Mary, at the lines of hurt and confusion on her face.
“What?” He asked as he dropped his hand and looked at Cas again. “Fighting with me isn’t entertaining like it used to be?”
The next morning, Dean woke up with his face still buried in Castiel’s hair. His arms and legs still wrapped tightly around the mass of angel. Castiel’s breathing remained slow and thick with sleep.
Cas’s lips twitched into a shallow smile at that.
“Hi, Baby,” he’d said as he caressed her cool metal.
“I don’t want to fight with you either,” Castiel whispered back.
Dean studied his brother for a moment, then shoved his chair back and casually grabbed his jacket and made a b-line for the stairs.
Dean blinked.
He rolled his eyes hard as Jessie answered a phone call from her boyfriend instead of listening to Kim’s story about her trip. How Jessie was still oblivious to the way Kim looked at her was beyond him. He shook his head and kicked up the footrest on the recliner then dug into his snacks. If he had to sit through the rough early parts of this movie to get to the good parts, he was going to do it comfortably.
On the tv, Jessie was in the middle of running down a crowded city sidewalk on her way to Kim’s apartment. She’d finally come to her senses about her boyfriend not being right for her and she’d finally realized she was in love with her best friend. Dean’s eyes burned as he mumbled along with Jessie’s heartfelt confession on Kim’s doorstep.
As whatever mess they’d gotten into inevitably got worse and worse, they repeated the words.
Castiel typed up a quick reply to Dillon’s email and promised to call soon.
Dean cupped Cas’s cheek. His chest ached. “I should have been there when you woke up. I shouldn’t have taken off like that.”
He looked at her as he stuffed another bite of pie into his already full mouth. Something told him she wanted to talk and that whatever she wanted to talk about it wasn’t anything he wanted to hear.
Sam immediately jumped into explaining the research rabbit hole he’d lost himself in for the last week and a half. The four of them caught up while they finished eating. Mary told them about the werewolf she’d hunted in Utah before coming down to meet them in Arizona. Cas told them about the issues he’d had with the lead on Kelly Kline in New Mexico. She’d bought plane tickets to two different cities in two different regions for the same time. Cas was frustrated that he’d followed up on the wrong flight.
It started because of a movie role Dean landed. This was the first major studio dramatic role Dean was hired for after over a decade of playing dumb jocks and ditzy playboys. His agent, who was also his younger brother, suggested Dean do some one-on-one research for this role.
And tonight, all of those months of awkwardness and long nights would pay off.
that slipped from his tongue? Sometimes, Dean let himself imagine what it would be like to have something real with the angel. Something recognizable and comfortable. How many nights had he lain awake staring into the blackness of his room, wishing he could work up the nerve to invite Cas to join him in bed? How many mornings had his dreams left him reaching for the empty side of the bed, half expecting Cas to be there?
“Right now? The bed.” Dean paused, then pointed at Cas. “Don’t you dare tell her that.”
Cas growled. “What is there to talk about, Dean?”
Castiel grunted in his sleep and burrowed closer to Dean, as if that was even possible.
Cas’s thigh was warm and comforting beneath Dean’s palm while they drove.
Kissing Cas felt as natural as breathing. Regret at not doing this sooner threatened to taint the moment but Dean shrugged the feeling off as he finally got acquainted with those chapped lips that drove him wild.
Cas pulled back and tried to capture Dean’s mouth in a kiss.
“I did this,” Castiel said. His wings bristled.
A smile tugged at Dean’s lips when he saw Sam with his hands braced on his knees breathing hard.
An older woman with short, white blonde hair, gold rimmed eyeglasses, and red lipstick sat at a table near the coffee bar. Her back was straight. Her hands were wrapped around a large, white mug of coffee on the table in front of her. She was staring at the front door of the cafe. When she spotted Sam and Mary, she lifted one hand and waved at them both.
Dean’s pulse thundered in his ears. Was this it? The moment he’d been imagining thousands of times over for nearly a decade?
“Maybe,” Dean said with a tight smile. Dean finished off his coffee and forced his thoughts back to the case. “Can you tell me a little more about Dillon? What kind of person was he? Was he religious?”
“The angel did look like it might be a ghost though,” Sam said.
“I believe I can do that,” Cas said.
“You two have been dancing around each other for years.”
A feeling Dean couldn’t quite name bubbled up in his chest. It was warm, like a big fluffy blanket or a good hug. A smile tugged at his lips. He closed his eyes and his muscles grew heavy. Water from Cas’s towel dripped down the back of Dean’s neck, raising goosebumps in its wake.
“I understand,” Dean said.
Dean turned into the parking lot he’d seen online. He passed the old tire shop and a martial arts studio aimed at kids. The remnants of a long abandoned K-Mart sign hung across the front of the strip mall in front of them. To the right of the abandoned store was a sign that read
“I’ve got music,” Dean said. “What are you looking for?”
Then Cas sat up on Dean’s lap and started fumbling with the fly on Dean’s jeans. They both fought to push Dean’s jeans back down his thighs like they were before Cas had made his presence known.
Something scraped along the floor outside their cell. It was the sound Dean had learned to associate with two things. Feeding time and more beatings. So far their captors hadn't bothered to ask them any questions or do any kind of testing on them. But they seemed to derive a sick pleasure from causing them both pain—physical and psychological.
Cas looked at the infirmary bed. “Right, I’ll clean up and let you rest.”
“This one decides she wanted to go on a pub crawl for our one year anniversary last month,” Sarah said. “I cut her off at one a.m. because I knew she’d be miserable with her hangover the next morning and I had still had a paper to write. She knows I’m not that good with directions, especially at night, but she insisted she knew where we were going. So that’s how we ended up in the same alley as a little herd of javelinas.”
Once the wound was clean, Cas moved on to washing the rest of Dean’s head, neck, and face. His opposite hand was a steady, constant weight on the side of Dean’s neck. Whenever he needed Dean to move, he’d use that hand to guide Dean in a different direction. Like most of their deeper communication, it was silent.
Before he could talk himself out of it, he scrolled away from the action movie tab and stopped at one near the end of the list. Once there he found one of his old favorites and pressed play.
“He’ll get over it,” Dean said.
Dean tore his eyes away. Cas and his guardian angel schtick was exhausting and concerning at the best of times. And this year was nowhere near the best of times.
They parted ways once inside the little convenience store attached to the gas station. Sam headed toward the far wall where a sign advertised healthy foods. Dean veered left, picking up a hand basket. He grabbed whatever snacks caught his eye.
“Shut up, Sam,” Castiel said.
Summer stared at him for a moment then started to laugh. She laughed loud and vibrant. Sam shuffled in his seat when he realized how much attention her laughter was earning from nearby tables. Mary glanced at Sam, then back at Summer.
She pressed her lips together and studied him again. “You’re free to go. Take care of yourself and, Dean, if you ever need someone to talk to, I’m here for you.”
“Took you long enough,” Dean said in a watery voice against Cas’s shoulder. He didn’t have to pull back to know Cas was rolling his eyes at Dean’s impatience. “Damn, I missed you.”
“Okay,” Dean said, for lack of better words.
“Why would they hire armed guards for a film festival?” Dean asked. “We got someone important in the crowd here?”
“That you were, you know.” Dean looked at Cas for help.
“That went well,” Sam said with a sigh.
with him. She said she wouldn’t compete with a ghost and then she got a lawyer.”
“Yes, Dean?”
“Ouch,” Dean said.
Cas studied Dean’s features and traced over Dean’s lips with his thumb one more time before stepping out of Dean’s hold. Dean grabbed hold of the counter behind him again as he became aware of the coldness in his bones once more. Cas gestured next to Dean.
He made promises to visit again when they were in town and told her to call him if she ever ran into anything weird enough that it made her question her sanity. She gave him a curious look at that but agreed.
He felt the phantom twitch of his wings--now gone as he was permanently human--fluttering in happiness. The phantom limb syndrome had disturbed and torment him when he was human for the first time after the fall. Now it was a comforting reminder of all he’d gained by giving them up.
For the first time since they’d been reunited, Cas looked unsure of himself. He let his hand fall from Dean’s face to curl around Dean’s elbow. “What else could have triggered it? Do you think it was a side effect of being near the rift when it closed?”
“You really expected us to leave you there?” Castiel hissed.
“He’s fine,” Dean said. He slipped his phone into his pocket and turned to his brother. “He hit a dead end on Kelly. I told him more about our case. He said he’ll be here in the morning. I told him we’d wait to do the rest of the investigating until after he got here.”
. The last weekend had
Cas took hold of the hem of Dean’s shirt.
(Art by
He did not watch Castiel walk out of the hospital room. He finished buttoning his blue and green flannel and did not let himself rub at the ache in his chest.
Crinkled eyes and a gummy smile. Lips pressed together and a determined look. A long silver blade.
He swallowed and adjusted the pillow and blankets to a mostly comfortable position.
“Of course,” Cas said as he took hold of Dean’s hand.
“No, I wasn’t,” Dean said. He didn’t admit that there was definitely at least one partially ripped page in the book now. Sam would figure that out soon enough.
“Hey Sammy?” Dean asked. “I’m glad you found something, but I’m a little busy right now. Can this wait, like, twelve hours?”
“May we get a copy of this?” Cas asked. He pulled out his cellphone and held it up to Scott. “I’d like to take a picture for reference.”
Sam did his best to ignore Mary’s studying look as he worked his way through the different research databases he had set up on the tablet. Times like this—with Mary’s impatience and black and white view of the world—reminded him a lot of Dean when they were younger and just starting to hunt together after Jess died. Ignoring his mom only worked for about five minutes, another sign that Dean took after Mary in a lot more ways than either brother had anticipated without her there while they were growing up.
“Why?” Mary asked. “Our lead went nowhere and they have more than enough people to interview. We can cover more ground quicker if we split the load.”
Dean shook his head. If he waited any longer, this moment of unsteady peace in their never-ending war with God would pass, and who knew if they’d ever find another moment to really talk. Who knew if Dean would ever get to tell Cas how much he never wanted him to leave his side. “I don’t want to wait anymore.”
“We’re safe, Dean,” Castiel said. “We’re home and we’ve got each other.”
Dean shifted on the seat. His jeans were growing a little tight at the memory of the detective and the things he could do with that fucking mouth of his. Dean wished he could have felt it on more than just his lips.
“Sam, twelve hours. That’s all I’m asking,” Dean said. He huffed, emboldened by the intensity in Cas’s eyes and the thick air between them. “You’re interrupting date night.”
Dean could never bring himself to look into the backseat of the car.
He cleared his throat.
“Have you talked to Cas today?” Sam asked as he watched Dean from over his laptop screen.
The time passed quickly as the 4 friends drank hard booze and chatted about everything and nothing, tried different drinking games until all of them were more than slightly drunk.
“So, what do you want to do? Dump Anna and run? And let her be killed by the angels or demons? Forget it. Look, I know the angels freak you out-” Sam spoke but was cut off by Ruby.
The invisible force holding Ruby's throat let up and she collapsed onto her knees as two demons appeared behind her. They grabbed her arms and harshly pulled her to her feet so she stood in front of the master torturer.
"That would be a neat trick." Uriel replied, before he pulled out the chain around his neck, showing off a vial of blue, glowing grace. "But I know you're lying. I've had this for years and Anna is yet to reclaim it. But I'm gonna keep it until you give her to us. Can't let Hell get their hooks into her."
The blonde angel choked on the liquid he was drinking and coughed. He looked up with wide, watering eyes. “What?” He asked.
He quickly called and Sam answered just as quick. "Dean?"
Dean looked back to the door and tried the handle. The door opened and the two Winchesters quietly stepped inside. “Mr. and Mrs. Milton?” Dean called out in question as he and Sam made their way through the house.
Missouri smiled gently at the red-haired woman. “Hello, Anna. I’m Missouri Moseley. Dean asked me to help out with your blocked memories.” She introduced herself to the young woman. “How about we go inside while Dean makes a phone call.” She suggested after having read Dean’s mind and finding he wished to contact his fiancé.
“What about-” Sam started asking, but the demon cut him off.
Dean had yelled at the younger angel after the angels had wiped out a fourth of London’s population with the Plague.
When it comes to updates, I have no idea how fast each update might come. My depression makes it hard to work, but since I'm just home 'cause of online classes, it might also go faster. I'm gonna try to write as much as possible and post it as soon as it's done.
“Who I am.” Anna simply answered, almost tearing her hidden secrets.
Castiel look at him with understanding eyes, while Uriel glared. “It’s the life of one thousand against the lives of six billion. There’s a bigger picture here.
Dean saw the moment his words registered to his brother (or brother-by-body, he supposed). Sam’s eyes widened and his mouth dropped open. “Dean?” He asked, voice on the edge between hope and disbelief.
“At the FBI we have been very disappointed by your lack of success on this triple homicide” his disapproving glare nearly shattered the glass vase on the desk.
Glaring at them Dean reached for his knife, but before he could do so one sprang up and grabbed Cas, forcing him onto the bed. Castiel was about to blast the vampire into oblivion but there was a flash of steel and suddenly there was an angel blade pointed directly at his neck
“I feel like something out of a horror movie” grumbled Cas
There were a pair of glowing red eyes staring at him, unblinkingly. They seemed to pierce his chest and look right through him.
There was a burst of hurried whispering before Cas felt someone holding his hand and guiding him across the room.
Sam took out a flask of holy water from his pocket, but Ruby put a hand on his arm to stop him.
“So, what, were they your bosses or something?” Missouri asked in a hesitant voice, hearing all of Dean’s thoughts and seeing his emotions in his aura. If the archangel -- angel of family himself -- didn’t like Anna, then she must have done something truly terrible.
Bobby hummed in response, his face taking on a calculating look. The old hunter moved to his desk where he opened a drawer and pulled out two glasses and a bottle of whiskey. He poured a generous amount in both glasses, handing one to Dean and drinking the other himself. “Does all angels look like that? Bookish, human… nerdy?” He asked after a minute of silence.
Sam nodded frantically, brain quickly working on a plan. “Okay, I say we call Bobby, get him back from Hedonism and-” Sam rambled until Ruby cut him off.
“Dude,” Dean said hoarsely. “Do you have to loom over me while I’m naked?” Dean questioned as he pushed Sam away. Sam turned his head when Dean stood, silently offering the older a towel to cover up his privates.
Ruby did a double take, clearly shocked that Sam knew who the demon was. “Yeah… You met him in the church. He’s like Picasso, but with a razor.”
While the doctor was not surprised, Dean was not really prepared for what happened next.
Kate huffed and went back to sit on the exam table with the crinkley white paper. “But I wanna know what's in the drawers. What’s in the jar? It says tongue depressors. What’s a tongue depressor? Are they sad?” She hopped off the exam table for the fourth time and went over to the small counter top with a small sink. She looked at Cas as she looked over her shoulder then looked at the clear jars on the counter. “I just wanna see it? I won’t touch it.”
“Oh honey, it’s okay,” Dean cooed and picked her up and put her on his lap. “It’s okay.”
Cas wasn’t convinced when Kate went to subconsciously touch a clear jar filled with cotton balls. There was another jar with tongue depressors and another filled with normal sized bandaids. Then There was a final clear jar with individually wrapped antiseptic wipes. She had just grabbed the lid of the tongue depressor jar when she felt hands wrap around her waist. She squawked when she was set back down on the exam table. She looked up only to see Dean smirking down at her. “Wasn’t gonna touch it,” she pouted and crossed her arms as Dean sat next to her. A little too close for her liking and she scooted over a bit.
“Okay, okay,” Dean cooed in Kate’s ear as he nodded to the nurse to proceed. The continued to coo and rub Kate’s back in a loving manner as the nurse cleaned her right upper arm and went over to get the shot. Another nod and the nurse administrated the shot.
Kate’s head snapped up from where she was playing with her fingernails. “What?”
“I think I’m going to color a race car,” Daniel said. “By the way, my name is Daniel so you don’t have to call me Mr. Novak.That’s a funny name isn’t it.”
Sammy was tired and cranky. He was bleeding frustration at not finding anything. Like
“No b-b ‘ood. Still owie,” he looked up from his knee to Dean.
“Yes,” Dean replied with a smile.
Kate eyed the man warily even though he wore a smile. She watched him the entire time he set the tray down, grabbed an antiseptic wipe from one of the clear jars on the counter and came over to her. That’s when she had had enough of that.
Cas gasped as Sam crashed into the table as Dean simply snorted and rolled his eyes. It looked like Sammy was already over his last tumble and was about to get into another one.
“So I’m going to give you some paperwork to fill out. It will have a new name, birthday, your address, stuff like that? Are you changing your child’s name?”
Cas looked up from the Enochian library book he was reading as Dean sat across from him. He smiled as Dean opened h\the computer and signed on.
“Mmm, thank you baby boy,” Dean said with a smile. “You picked the best chip out of the whole bag.”
“I said your name twice. Where did you just go?” Dr. Novak asked gently.
Kate looked at Daniel nervously, but he was busy coloring one of the race car neon green. Then she looked at the basket.
“Dam-ding? Ohhh,” Sam smiled when Dean held it up and he opened his mouth so Dean could pop it in. It made him so safe that he couldn’t help but give a wiggle and give Rocket an extra little squeeze.  He was so excited for a moment that he forgot why he was so comfy in the first place. “I’s no need a nap De-de cause I’s a big boy and big boys don’t need naps so just story dis time, peas.” he added when he saw a look on his brother’s face.
“It’s not yellow, it’s a golden retriever. My first foster parents had one. They were nice. Her name was racer cause she ran around like crazy,” Kate laughed at the memory.
“No where,” Kate mumbled. “There’s no place to hide.”
Kate looked at the cameras. It was an open room, she couldn’t hide.
Kate wakes up and they get to go home
After a while watching, Dean couldn’t take it anymore and went into the room.
Cas’ heart swelled at the sight of his daughter having fun and being relaxed. He was a bit sad that they weren’t the first ones but he knew what Daniel had to do to evaluate Kate.
Cas stepped closer, his eyes shining.
“That’s good” He replied gruffly “Is it ok if I sit here with you while you wait for him?”
He said ‘not’ so honestly that Dean almost believed him.
“I’m sorry”
“Meg?” Dean's voice was incredulous.
“Cas, I know you don’t really feel human emotions” Sam started.
Shrugging off his FBI garb Dean announced that he was going to find a burger joint and get takeaway for them all. Puckering up his mouth Sam groaned and begged for a salad.
And suddenly Dean couldn’t breathe, his throat was tight and his only thought was to not lose Cas.
The slime that had been around Cas’s legs dribbled to the floor and disappeared leaving him standing in the middle of the empty room staring, unseeing at the spot Dean had disappeared from.
Sipping it thoughtfully he checked his Phone for any updates from Cas.
“Oh nothing much”
“Uhh second room on the left I think. Why?”
“I was just wondering if you knew how Dean felt about us-, about me”
He was hit from behind by a branch of black goo that coiled around him faster than he could say another syllable.
Unsure if it was the right move Cas tenderly put his hand on Dean's arm causing Dean to shudder involuntarily, Cas was about to move his hand when Dean tilted his his face up, they both stared into each others eyes for a minute understanding on both their faces, the vampires and blood forgotten.
From the moment they had arrived The Empty has been in control of the room and now was no exception. Billie had opened her mouth to speak but there was suddenly black goo pinning her mouth shut.
Once they were outside and heading for the Impala Dean started shouting, “what was that? You nearly made the man wet himself! That wasn't good cop bad cop that was bad everything!”
Trying to ease some of the tension out of his shoulders Cas tenderly rubber circles on Deans back feeling them relax after only a few minutes.
“Thank You, Cas you’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me. I have to do this, I couldn’t live without you, you know that and I Lo-“
Trying not to spook Dean he whispered “I like you different than a brother too” and the look on Dean's face was worth every feeling he had hidden away.
Dean just rolled his eyes, smirking slightly and Sam gave him a very pointed look which Dean ignored.
“We would be extremely indebted to you if you would provide us with the case files, otherwise we may have to take a more severe form of action,”
Knowing that this wouldn’t be a problem for Dean he scrunched his nose and grinned at Cas to continue,
Castiel stayed in the shower for as long as possible. Knowing when he got out he would have to properly face Dean.
Cas was doing research on the laptop in silence before the door was shoved open and Dean appeared pulling a huge fir tree behind him, snowflakes swirling in the doorway.
And Cas smiled so sadly Dean wanted to believe it just to make him feel better and to stop him looking at Dean as if it was the last time he would ever lay eyes on him.
They eventually pulled up to a Motel and found rooms. Once they were settled, Dean and Castiel headed off to talk to the local police.
“Because it is.”
Up the hallway they heard the front door bang - Sam coming back from another run and Castiel half expected Dean to jump up and pretend nothing had happened. However Dean kept his eyes fixed in Cas’s face as he changed into fresh clothes and handed Cas his trench coat from where it lay discarded on the floor.
Putting all the dishes in the sink for Sam to do later he headed to the garage, Sam watched him wondering if it was safe for him to drive in that condition but then again Dean hadn’t crashed all the times he had been drunk off his ass so who was he to judge Dean's driving capabilities.
Dean's eyes prickled but he kept them focused on Cas’s anchoring him to the real world. He wanted Castiel to be the last thing he saw before The Empty took him.
Dragging his feet and rubbing his eyes he stumbles into the kitchen hands reaching for the pot of coffee he knew Sam would have brewed.
“Come on dude, You’re gonna have to confront your feelings for him at some point.”
Then the blindfold was being lifted off him and he blinked at the bright light.
Once he was in bed it took at least another hour for him to fall asleep and once he was asleep the nightmares started again.
“Well if hunters would stop coming onto our patch then we wouldn't have to resort to such extreme measures.” His soft tone threatened to seep into Deans veins.
“So Castiel, that speech was quite something. I guess that means your end of the deal is up.” She smirked and was about to move before a loud bang alerted the to the presence of Billie who they had forgotten in the confusion.
Letting themselves into the motel they found Sam still hard at work searching the internet for clues. He hardly glanced up when they entered and didn’t seem to notice the strange energy between them.
Dean's heart was racing, there was a blurry figure kneeling next to his bed.  Blinking rapidly his eyes cleared and he saw a familiar trench coat underneath a worried face.
Sam noticed and smiled to himself, he wanted his brother to be happy and while it wouldn't be easy he thought Cas could give him that.
Checking him over Cas found a cut on Dean's arm which probably wouldn’t have been too serious but Cas wasn’t going to take any chances.
The bunker was looking surprisingly festive. Dean had spent the entire day decorating it and there was tinsel twirled down the banister and baubles hung all around the hallways.
Getting flustered Sam tried to explain, “I just mean that you don’t always understand love or…”
Suddenly he was running, running as fast as he could but not fast enough. Not gonna get there in time,can’t save him.
“Dean?” Cas tentatively touched his shoulder, his eyes wide with concern.
“It was Chuck all along.” Dean's voice was filled with despair. “We never should have left Sam and Jack. We should be there with them now.”
“You look like something out of a horror movie”
But it hurt Cas more than he would admit to see Dean's inner turmoil. All he wanted was to comfort the man but he couldn't do that without revealing his snooping.
“You’re The Empty.” He realised.
In an instant he realised what Cas had been asking, mentally cursing himself for not seeing it sooner.
Deans breathing was rapidly getting quicker. He gave a strangled gasp and reached out for Castiel's arm.
“Well it’s not … conventional but I’ll sleep sweeter knowing that” their voice turned icy, “ The person who woke me up in the first place is going to  suffer forever. If I took you would be fast asleep in microseconds.”
“Put it on”.
The sizzling smell of the omelette was oddly comforting. It was homey and calmed him in a way nothing had for a long time.
“Why does everyone keep saying I don't understand human feelings?” Cas interrupted a hurt look on his face.”
“Because you're an angel” He smiled winningly at Cas who had a vaguely bemused look etched across his face.
He tried to run from them but the air was like glue and he could only move in slow motion.
Interrupting the moment Sam walked over with three mugs of eggnog. Grabbing one Dean flopped onto the sofa. Sam tapped Cas on the shoulder and waved at Cas to go sit next to Dean.
“Cas, you're his best friend, you know that. He loves you like family.”
The door swung open and Billie was standing in the doorway her scythe grasped tightly in her hand.
Sam immediately regretted asking, Dean's face had turned stony and he was glaring at Sam.
“I was drunk when I told you that, It didn't mean anything!” Dean was almost shouting and Sam was concerned that he would get violent. Dean hated himself for all the feelings he had for Cas, The affection and care he had for the angel felt wrong in his head but right in his heart and Dean had no idea what he was supposed to do about it.
He wasn’t sure he wanted to hear what came next.
Just then a huge hulking form barged past the vamps crowded in the doorway, It was at least 7 feet tall and wearing what could only be described as a potato sack, the ugly face looked like it could have come straight out of Buffy. The two sitting inside the motel who up until now had been very collected and calm looked panicked and leapt up. There was a hushed conversation between the three which seemed to end in the new vamp telling the others that the Winchesters must die immediately.
“You-“ he looked at Cas then back at The Empty, “You can have me instead”
Sam was still confused about what exactly Cas was getting at but he was beginning to piece it together.
Once Sam was sick of the graphic burger descriptions he turned the conversation onto the case. “So far three bodies have turned up with the blood drained and of course the locals are completely clueless.”
“How dare you! This is some of the best coffee I've ever drunk! Why don't you bring Dean here sometime? He likes coffee, you know.”
Without realising Cas caught himself gazing fondly over Deans slumbering form. Pondering the complexities of love.
“Heh sorry, I keep forgetting that you were human for a bit. It's just that you're not any old angel in the garrison. I care about you.”
Dean rubbed his eyes staring up at Cas, a small smile turning up the corners of his mouth.
“What’d he tell you?” Sam asked, realizing his brother would only act like that if something wasn’t right.
Balthazar broke the hug and took a step back, the woman doing the same. Looking at the two, Dean’s suspicion was confirmed at the sight of the ring of rose gold and diamonds which was covered in sigils wrapped around the woman’s finger.
The steps traveled over to the stairs and Ariel appeared at the top, wearing an expensive sheer black robe, trimmed with pink fur and simple cotton underwear underneath. Over the course of 1 day, she had managed to get hold of Danielle Imagé and also get her to say ‘yes’. Ariel had probably been preparing her for some time before Castiel and Dean met her in the restaurant.
Sam turned his head away and gripped the steering wheel and continued the journey towards the Connor Beverly Behavioral Medicine Center in a tense silence, during which Sam thought about how many deals he had tried to made with demons, trying to sell his soul and make Dean come back.
