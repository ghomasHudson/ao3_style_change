It took all day and into the night, but Dean finished all of his scheduled commitments and can finally be alone. He was a guest on a vidcast this morning, did some looping work for his latest movie, and then had a long dinner with his manager and a producer that wants to work with him. While they both stuffed themselves with food and liquor, Dean obediently stuck to his diet.
Looking around his treasure room, as he calls it, he smiles. The walls are stacked with paintings, the makeshift shelves overflowing with statues, jars full of trinkets, ancient tomes, and even dinosaur skulls.
Cas stops immediately. Everyone he knows is at work themselves. “What? Who?”
Cas’s face resolves in the inky mirror, his lips brushing along Dean’s neck. “You’re going to have to draw lines here, Dean. If I had my way, you will have all of your firsts with me tonight.”
Cas grins. “Sure. Let me up and I’ll take the rest off.”
His adorable friend glances up with pink cheeks. “I don’t really know how to do this for someone else.”
“Excellent. So we’ll see you in a few weeks?”
“Yeah, I remember his eyes,” an Omega said. She was heavily pregnant - most of the breeders at the ranches were. “…He a double breeder?”
“Okay, then,” Cas said, stroking Dean’s face, gently wiping away his tears.
Besides, later in the evening, he has an opening party to attend at his sponsor’s gallery. There’s no way that they will let him miss that. Whenever they host a new show, all of their other celebrities must go and work the crowds. He’s technically there as a guest, but he’s been trained in what that means. He is an accessory for the show. He is a draw that gets the buyers into the building. From what Naomi has suggested, Mr. Roman has spent an exorbitant amount of money on this artist, and he intends for this gala to be a success.
“Already? I just got back.”
“We made it!” he whispered, pulling Castiel along until they made it to a small embankment, pulling him onto it. The cave seemed to make a sharp right turn, and, where it did, there was a carved out space, round, with a little pit in the middle.
“Like what?” Dean questions.
He was at the end of his rope. He’d hoped to have found a solution by now, that
“You do, don’t you?”
But the river was growing deep. They were going to have to leave the river.
“Oh, Cas, you’re so good, you feel so good…” he said as his knot grew too big to pull out, forcing him into quick, shallow movements, rubbing his knot up against his love’s sensitivity.
“…You, too,” Sam said, softly.
“Dean, I’m sorry I-”
“Yes, Alpha,” Dean whispered.
It turns out that Cas wasn’t involved with the group already, but that he was extremely interested in their ideals. While Dean couldn’t be seen at their meetings because of his status, Cas could go and report everything back to them. As their intelligence about the currents of rebellion grew, so did their plotting.
told you that, I assume.”
“Yes,” Dean said, some hope rising in his chest. Though, he couldn’t help but feel suspicious. This seemed too good to be true.
“What you said. Getting eggs implanted in me, if I need it?”
“But it is.”
Dean sat down as he thought. [[I don’t know.]] Just then, he jumped up and slammed his forelegs down playfully. [[How about you run with me?]]
“What happened?”
“Of course, sweetheart. Everyone should see it, and maybe one day they will. But, for now. I’m happy to share it with you.”
Dean took a deep breath before knocking on the door of the quaint little witch’s hut in the middle of the jungle. He looked down at Castiel before wincing. “Don’t take anything she says personally,” he said, finally knocking on the door.
“Castiel? Dean is ready for you.”
Dean quickly slithered out of the room and back to his own, sighing in relief.
It tingled through his shoulder, down to the end of his stump, where there was suddenly almost an unbearable pain. Yet it felt so good.
“Excuse me, everyone. Dean is needed at the recording studio, so I’m afraid you will all need to take my card and schedule an appointment to speak with him another time.”
Well, he was right about one thing. It did take three minutes to get there.
“Yes, of course,” the figure replied.
As they start their hike into the area Cas wants to show him, Dean follows directly behind him, hand in hand. It’s as much for comfort as it is for safety. Dean doesn’t know his way here, and Cas was prepared for the reality that their trip would be spent with Dean staring up into the canopy.
He needed to get him warm. Now.
“He’s lain with it.”
“But he will.”
They arrived back at the little camp far too quickly.
Squinting at the lock itself, Cas determines the type of mechanism easily. After all, on the inside of a secure building, the locks are more or less decorative. A request to not enter the room rather than a mandate. Swiftly, Cas is inside.
“I apologize, Sam, but even if we do find something, you know that they won’t make the video inadmissible.”
Castiel was dangerous. Powerful.
“Don’t let me be greedy, Dean. You need time to process all of these new sensations; to figure out what you like and what you can’t live without. Exploration is important. Don’t let me rush you just because I want you so badly.” As Cas is whispering his advice into his ear, that cavernous deep voice is vibrating through Dean’s body. Cas’s big hands are running over his chest, soothing and stoking the fire inside of him.
“I’ll be back,” he promises, backing up several feet before he can make himself look away. When he does, he turns directly into his manager. He apologizes and steps back before he realizes who it is, but when he does, he cusses in an obvious way.
“No. I haven’t. Is something wrong?”
The pack had finally tentatively allowed him to join, as he was a skilled hunter - excellent at archery when few are. After all, he’d been a lone wolf for so long. When in a pack, a wolf can rely on teamwork and knives to take down any prey they needed. But alone? A wolf needed to pick off prey from a distance to keep safe. Only lone wolves and druids knew archery to any extent, and the druids only knew it so they could use enchanted arrows to combat fell creatures.
“It is likely just mindless Alpha instinct. Not really kindness,” Dean said, turning away.
Castiel was quiet for what felt like a very long time, before, at last, he spoke.
Dean stabbed him in the gut, relishing how it turned the water around them red.
“That was wonderful, Dean. I never wanted it to end.”
“Inais will take care of her and keep her alive, don’t worry. Only two more, Dean. You can do this.”
“Up here,” he yells back, making a complicated run of notes before setting the guitar down.
“Do they need food?” Sam said, hope rising in his chest.
“What did you say?” Dean said, ignoring the pain in his neck.
And he was never going to let him go again.
“Then what’s wrong?” Dean asked, holding onto his mate who seemed to be trying to climb up him, only to keep losing grip and falling. Fortunately, Dean held onto him tightly.
The wolf blinked back tears, bearing his throat even more for the god to slit any time it should wish to.
And that was all it took.
Dean nodded with a needy whine.
“Don’t say I didn’t warn you.”
“You like it when I touch your useless dick?”
So it can’t be harmful. That means the worst it could do would be nothing at all.
Just then, far away, there was the distant sound of shouting.
Long ago, when the world was young, before the stars adorned the sky, only the moon lit the night. The moon: the winged white wolf, the god of wolves and of Omegas, darkness’s bane. However, for one day in its cycle, the moon is new and dead and gone from the sky. This was the Black Moon - when the night was lightless. On this day, it was unwise for travellers to wander in the forest, as the darkness gave rise to many strange and fell creatures who sought to take any unsuspecting traveller as their food or their slave. Or worse.
“My wolf form?”
He tripped and fell, rolling to the ground. It didn’t matter. He immediately got back up and kept running. He had to get to his Castiel.
Joining Cas out on the porch of their home, they watch the sunset, arms wrapped over each others’ shoulders. Dean touches the necklace given to him by the monks a lifetime ago. The golden fish make sense to him now. It’s like the monks were telling him to hold on, that freedom would be his someday.
“You heard the gossip they’ve been saying about your arm, handsome?” Megara said as soon as he walked through the door, not bothering to look up from her books.
Cas grins and takes the shirt from him, flipping it over his shoulder before holding the new one out for him to put on. The scent of Dean’s skin washes over him, and it takes every ounce of willpower not to drop his nose into the warm fabric.
His love was naked.
The very idea made the hair at the back of his neck bristle with fury.
Dean claims his lips again, fiercely. “Of course, Cas. Show me how good it feels.”
One month, he arrived at the lake a couple weeks early. He had plans. Spurred on by his excitement at seeing the Omega again soon, Dean searched around until he located a cave, not too far away from the lake. Immediately, he began forming a den out of it. This accomplished, he constructed some crude furniture - a table, a couple of chairs, and a bed for him to sleep in while he waited for the Black Moon that also doubled as comfortable seating. There was even a nice fire pit he’d prepared just outside. That done, he made sure it was thoroughly scented so no one would steal it, then buried a line of enchanted dust at the den entrance to protect it. Lastly, he painted runes on the threshold that would both deter intruders and mark the den as owned.
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel said, warmly.
“You’re welcome, Lone Wolf. See if I ever do
Dean nods furiously. “Yes, that.”
“Think of Sam.” Cas nods toward the kitchen.
“Too true.”
This precious wolf, so selfless and gentle and loving, and Castiel had hurt him. Someone who had suffered so much pain, and Castiel had only given him more.
“Cas!”
“I still would want you to bed fed and warm,” he said, thinking hard. “Besides, I don’t think I have a chance with you, anyway. You’ve spent so little time with me, and likely much more with others more like yourself.”
“They don’t have to be.”
“Meg?”
He’s known about the maintenance tunnels and decontamination huts his whole life, and it wasn’t difficult to find one that was no longer in service when the time came to get and stay off the country’s radar.
you. That’s blasphemy. I should be put to death for such wicked heresy. Mortals and gods, they don’t… they don’t-”
“No!” Castiel said, angered at the accusation. “I told you, I’m not hungry! It’s
Dean didn’t feel it, though. This was all happening so far away. So far away.
The Omega gasped for a deep breath, but it only caught in his throat. He tried to steady himself, but he felt so
“No…” Castiel said, heart stopping in his chest. Not his wolf. Not his precious wolf.
Dean smirked. “I have a gift for seeing into the hearts of those under my care.”
“An emergency?” Cas’s concern is immediate and consuming. He crouches down next to Dean. “What happened?”
,” Dean retorted with a huff.
That wasn’t its name, though. Not really. The mansion’s true name was Havendale - but Heaven was more classy. And no one dared take down Heaven. Too many powerful clients used Alastair’s services. But maybe, just maybe, if it was found they were using claimed Omegas something could be done.
“I’ll be alright. The pack's taking care of me.”
*****
“Will I ever see you again?” Dean said, an ache burning in his chest. Now that he’d met him, he never wanted to leave him. He wanted to always be there, to protect him. To keep him warm. But to lose him forever…?
Cas shrugs. “That’s the idea, yes.”
“No! He isn’t evil! He would never be evil!”
“Don’t let Uriel hear you say that,” his friend Devon laughs and bumps his shoulder.
Fool. I fear no mere arrow, no mere bow.
Dean nodded, lost in thought.
Their lips crash together, drinking deep from the desire between them. Cas uses the moment to wet his hole and start to loosen himself. As soon as Dean breaks the kiss for breath, Cas has a finger working in and out smoothly.
“Yes?”
Castiel sighed and nodded, allowing Dean to slowly yet tightly wrap the wound.
“What do I need to do, Cas?” Dean asks, looking far out of his depth.
Jinushi: “Owners”
“I just feel so… so weak. Doing anything is so draining, and I feel like someone’s carving up my stomach, almost like I’m being stabbed.”
Cas went pale. “Oh fuck…”
Cas set his jaw as he inspected his knife.
A roar split the night, high-pitched and piercing, so loud that Dean screamed in pain as his ears bled.
Dean shrugs. “My dad is still out there. He retired from his career long ago. He was an actor, like me. He and my mom had a relationship arranged by his sponsor and her family.”
Jaime nods politely to him, but then glares at Cas with petty vindictiveness. When he huffs and makes a direct line to the back, Cas knows his time is up.
“You’re actually drooling.”
“Sorry, I-”
And he was gone.
It is the right thing to say because Cas grins at him with heat building in his eyes. “Can I suck you?”
There it is. The painting he’s here to rescue. He scowls to see the situation is even worse than he’d thought. It isn’t even kept behind glass. Rolling his eyes, he gets to work. Peeking behind the frame before he touches it, he finds no wires or sensors. Similarly, he finds that there aren’t laser alarms or cameras of any kind here. The absolute arrogance of this man makes him chuckle. He’s so sure that no one would ever dare steal from him that he doesn’t even try to secure his treasures. Cas feels no guilt at taking advantage of such an obvious weakness.
“…The great deer?”
At first, no one knew what it was. It just shone a deep, powerful red, first dim, then brighter and brighter as its magic swirled and filled the lake.
Dean seems to snap out of his stupor. This man has a lovely smile and such brazen confidence that it catches Dean off guard. “Of course. Please take a seat.”
Dean kisses him again while circling his fingers around the head and stroking light but fast. Cas keens at the feeling, dropping his head back.
It… it sounded like Castiel, like the Omega he’d met. But was the Omega he’d met even real? Even true?
“Don’t feel bad, we get plenty of new customers. Do you know what you like? What you’ve got a craving for? You want an Unbroken one that’ll put up a fight? A Broken one that’ll let you do whatever you please? Or an Archangel - one that’ll do their very best to give you the best experience possible?”
Dean gives Cas a blessing, another ancient piece of religion that is a holdover from their past. Once it is said, he steps into the waiting vehicle, and is home in moments.
Dean started bringing fruits, too, or new foods for Castiel to try, as it seems he hadn’t eaten many. Fortunately, the land on which is prospective pack lived on was rich with fruit. So many fruits to bring his love, to watch him bite into and love every moment of it, to suddenly remember what apples tasted like when there's joy in his heart.
“I am. For maybe the first time in my life, I am seeing clearly.”
Little coughs, crying.
He looked around, only for his eyes to fall on his mate.
Part of him is teasing, but he has to hear the words from Dean’s mouth that he wants this.
They were so soft, a little oily, but still so soft and really a pleasure to touch. “Is… is this a pinfeather?” Dean asked, poking a suspicious quill.
“Black Moon?”
stay!” Castiel shouted. He didn’t intend to, but he did.
“Oh!” the figure responded cheerfully. “Thank you,” he said, hugging the cloak around him. The large coat swallowed his small figure, but he seemed delighted by it.
“Um, I’m Castiel. This is Jim - I mean, James.”
They were all going to be alright.
Instead of his brother, Dean sees his valet, the man who has grown up with him and served him throughout his life, scrolling through Sam’s personal tablet. This is an egregious breach of trust for a servant to commit. There is no valid reason for Cole to be in Sam’s room. He is Dean’s assistant. Even touching Sam’s personal property is a fireable offense. Dean can’t believe his eyes, but he’s innocent, not stupid. Nothing good comes out of this situation.
Gathering all his willpower, Dean grabbed Castiel and pushed him gently back.
Dean scowls and looks over to his manager. As soon as their eyes meet, he approaches, full of bluster.
Dean sighed. “Castiel.”
There was a horrible, sharp pain. Yelps. A weight.
“Farewell, Speckled Wolf.”
He had to free Castiel. He had to find out more about the curse. He had to break it, had to free his love.
Cas huffs in surprise. “Yes, of course I do. I was flirting with you the very first time we met, Dean. I don’t think my appreciation has been at all subtle.”
And, god, there it was. Room #316.
Angry that they would deprive Dean of such basic needs, Cas replies, “I don’t care. I need your lips on mine right now.”
“Gotcha!” She at last said, holding the blood-drenched arrow triumphantly, replacing it in the quiver on her back.
“No,” Castiel responded. “I mostly stay a wolf.”
“You won’t. Nothing bad will happen. I promise.” Dean nods and continues to watch their cocks slip together in Cas’s hand.
“You may come when I say, not a second before,” he ordered, his Omega nodding vigorously. “Say it,” he demanded.
One problem, though.
“No, I don’t think you heard me. Leave. Now.”
Sitting up with nonchalance, Cas nods. “In the ass, yes.”
________________________
“C-Cas…” he breathed through frozen lips.
“Take your shirt off,” Cas ordered as he slid off his suit jacket and loosened his tie, making his way upstairs towards their room. Dean immediately complied, following behind him like an eager puppy. As they neared the bed, Cas grabbed his Omega’s collar and pulled him in tight for a voracious, hungry kiss.
“Cas,” he sighed with awe in his voice. “It’s so beautiful here.”
“Alright,” Dean said, looking down at the big wings in front of him. Gingerly, he reached out and
“Use your eyes, wolf!” Pamelia said. “This creature is an incredibly powerful dark force. Who knows how many he’s killed? How many he’s planning to kill? Things like him can reduce entire civilizations to ashes. He must be killed before he can harm anyone else.”
Yet Dean forced himself to go on. Because it was worth it. For Castiel, it was worth it. Every second with him was amazing, a light in the wolf’s dark existence, a time when life was good, when life was clear.
He makes the appropriate bow of a servant and says just loudly enough to those around to hear, “Sir, I’ve come to take you home. I’ve already gathered your things from the dressing room.”
Dean stared deeply into those blue, sincere eyes, before looking down at the hand now clasping him.
This one here is dripping out giant black globules because yay. It also prefers to eat its prey’s guts while they’re still alive, because it’s warmer that way. <3
The woman, obviously one of the escorts that are circulating at the party, freezes comically. When she turns, Dean finds that he is not a woman after all. The blonde hair is obviously a wig, but the scruff on his face is the dead giveaway. Unreal blue eyes meet his and the man takes a horrified step back with a curse.
“What is it, Cas?” Sam tries to hide his hopeful tone, but he’s not the actor of the family.
“You don’t know that.”
The man stares at him now, a concerned furrow growing between his eyes. He seems so familiar, especially the eyes. If he didn’t know better, he’d think this was…
The wolf couldn’t help but feel himself become aroused at the sight of him.
Dean whimpered. He wanted his baby girl.
“You’re in heat, aren’t you…?” Jimmy breathed in his ear.
tail.
Dean comes over to sit beside Cas, worry in his eyes. “Please do not think like that. Our differences are only circumstances.”
“Dean I,” Castiel said, shock in his voice, heart racing in his chest.
“I know you don’t like talking about them a lot, but I really want to know. If that’s alright,” Castiel said, looking down upon realizing his intrusion. His eyes, they looked so anxious, so sad. Dean could never bear it.
“You can call me Cas.”
Dean nods and follows at his side. “Tell me about yourself, Cas.”
Then a voice. In his heart.
On shaky arms, Dean pushed himself up, breathing new life into himself for the first time in so long. He tore away the vines that had curled themselves around him, shaking off the moss and dirt as his cloak repaired itself behind him. He forced himself to his feet, leaning against the nearby tree, bright green apples still hanging from a few of its branches.
Castiel looked up at the sky, worry etching his face. “I think it’s time we go back to the lake.”
“It’s not your fault.”
When the chef brings Dean’s egg whites with spinach and a shot of wheatgrass, he doesn’t even complain. Beside him, Cas is eating wheat toast, a bowl of berries with honey and yogurt, and a plate of bacon. He arranges the plates so that the bacon is practically on Dean’s plate. When the chef leaves the kitchen, Cas tips it up and two pieces slide on top of the egg whites. When Dean doesn’t move, Cas nudges his shoulder and gestures comically with his eyes.
Oh, he wasn’t going to last long at all.

“Can you eat?” he asked, softly, as if speaking too loud would hurt him even more.
“Is that so?” Castiel smiled. “Yes, my fur is partially black.”
________________________
“Castiel?” Dean said, holding either side of his love’s face.
“I love you, too, James,” Castiel said, taking one last breath, preparing to fall to his feet in surrender, already the need in his channel was growing, clawing within him. How did Jimmy last so long with this?
Now, you know that feeling? The one you get when you’re asleep and you start feeling cold, and you realize that your feet aren’t covered by the blankets? That’s the unpleasant feeling Castiel woke up to, sometime in the middle of the night, he didn’t know quite when.
Castiel didn’t realize it, but his hands had started to shake.
“Don’t ‘Oh, Dean’ me. I’ve been given opportunities only a handful of people will ever have.” His tone is rougher, more aggressive and emotional than Dean ever allows.
“I could ask the same of you. After all, I hear it is bad luck for a wolf to wander the forest when there is no moon in the sky.”
He couldn’t continue. He was lost to tears, his weeping wracking his body.
“You’re big! And gold as wheat!” Castiel exclaimed cheerfully as he examined him. “And you
His beloved’s grace was fading. Fading away, right here in his arms.
And now Dean had lost him. Forever.
Taking Dean with her.
She cocked an eyebrow. “You
Just then, a sputter. “Castiel?” Dean asked as the Angel coughed to life, before grasping his leg.
So it was too late.
“Oh, stop, we aren’t going to eat your heart,” Pamelia said, annoyed, stepping towards him.
“But you said-”
__________________________
“Alright,” he said, grinning lopsidedly as he stood to his feet. He turned away from the little Omega so as to give himself a modicum of privacy as he removed the clothing he did not wish ripped or constricting him during the shift. First the cloak, then his crude jacket, leaving him shivering in the cold as he worked at his pants.
He needed to warn Cas.
“No, it’s me,” Castiel said, suddenly realizing exactly what he was doing.
“Do I ask too much?” Dean flushes with a combination of vulnerability and shame.
“Here, let’s do it together.” Cas maneuvers to his knees and pulls Dean close in a mirrored position. Dean is patiently waiting to see what Cas is up to. It isn’t until Cas takes his own cock and presses it against Dean’s, circling both of them in his hand that Dean moans and holds onto Cas’s shoulders.
As he winds through the crowd of servers and cooks in the kitchen, Cas feels the steamy heat of the warmers crank up. Sweat has been trickling down his temples for hours. He would rip this shirt off if he could. Made of thick, black fabric, it doesn’t breathe at all. Because of the other employees, and a few of the customers, his arm is covered in various stains along the sleeves.
Dean gave his throat a loving, tender kiss. “Never, beloved.”
“Okay, reach behind me. You can help work me open for you.” Dean moves swiftly, eagerly, which makes Cas smile. His thick fingers slide along Cas’s skin until they find the right spot. Dean huffs out a noise when he feels how slick Cas is.
“Hey, Jude,” he sang quietly into his ear, “don’t make it bad.”
It turns out that he doesn’t look at Dean, doesn’t even speak, until they are all the way to the edge of the dome, inside his humble home. Cas walks around the dark rooms mechanically, lighting enough candles to illuminate the room they are in. Only then does he rip off his Sabanto wig and scream profanity. After he kicks over a stack of books, he flops down into the makeshift couch.
“Hm,” Rowena said, lifting a foot to kick the dark god onto its back to get a better look at its wounds. The little thing yelped at the gesture.
Dean nods, goes back to his table and touches his false identity bracelet against the table, leaving only enough credits to pay for his meal. He meets Cas in the foyer, his former boss standing over him like he is guarding a criminal. It raises his ire again, even if he did promise Cas that he would not pursue it.
The world beyond the domed, contained world that is all he’s ever known. The sounds alone are enough to draw him in. Bird calls are thick like they cover every branch of every tree. The rest of the sounds are completely unrecognizable, but they send a thrill up his spine. He takes a step forward, looking up to see himself pass beyond the thickness of the dome. Though his heart is racing, it is equal parts fear and exhilaration.
Dean looks up and sees that the voice belongs to a tall, dark haired man, who looks absolutely frantic. He’s carrying a pair of gym shoes and an empty leash in his hands. He’s wearing a pair of dark wash jeans and a navy blue button-up collared shirt, the cuffs on both are haphazardly rolled up and his hair is wild. This guy looks so out of place that it would be comical if it weren’t for the terror and worry written all over his face.
“I’m originally from Kansas. I moved out here several years ago when my brother decided to make California his permanent home. After he left Kansas, there really wasn’t anything to keep me there, and besides, who could say no to palm trees, beaches, bikinis, and year-round sunny weather, right?” He flashes a smile at Castiel, hoping that sharing a bit of himself will encourage him to open up. To his disappointment, Castiel’s face seems to close off and the grin that had been lingering fades away. He pulls his legs up to his chest and hugs them with his left arm while his chin rests on top of his knees, and he begins to draw random shapes into the sand with his right hand. Dean isn’t sure what to do, but then Castiel speaks.
Dean’s having a difficult time getting a read on this guy, which only encourages him to continue.
“Wow. So you’re here to write about the Roadhouse?”
By the time he’s ready to head out of the kitchen and back out into the crowd, he realizes it’s been nearly forty minutes. Cas is sure to have left by now. Damn. He was really hoping for one more chance to talk with him, maybe get a feel for how the review is going to go, or maybe to lay on his charm a little more, or maybe just to see if he can coax out one more of those small little smiles Cas lets slip on occasion. What’s the harm in that, right? If he leaves the restaurant smiling, then he’s bound to recall his experience as a positive one. So what if Dean wants to be the one to make him smile? It’s not like the food didn’t also do its job in leaving a good impression.
“Nah, you’re not an idiot. You clearly care a great deal about Charlie and little Seb, is all” and before he can stop himself, he adds, “and they are obviously very lucky to have you.” Once again, Cas looks at him with a mix of uncertainty, as though he’s weary of Dean approaching some imaginary line that indicates he’s about to cross into a territory that’s too personal.
As if on cue, Jo walks through the front doors and interrupts. “You’ll what, Winchester? Tell my mother on me? Because if you think--”
Dean takes a step back and refocuses. Cas looks away.
“Well I’m glad you ended up here.” As soon as the words are out, the embarrassment squeezes tight around his shoulders . He looks down at his feet and brings a hand up to rub at the back of his neck, willing away the blush he feels pulse hot on his cheeks. Cas is silent and still, and Dean feels the weight of Cas’s gaze like a heavy blanket, holding him secure but unrestricted.
The man looks up and his eyes go wide in recognition, quickly turning from surprise to confusion as he looks at Dean and then behind him, as if to decipher where Dean appeared from and how.
Castiel fumbles to pull an invitation out of his shoulder bag and hands it over. “I was invited to the pre-opening event.” Awkward looks flit across his face and Dean isn’t quite sure what to make of him just yet.
“Is there something I can help you with?” Dean asks.
, and Bobby’s been complaining about her ever since. But it’s no matter because Dean’s proud of the work he’s done with her. The truck was undriveable, useless, and barely worth the scrap parts holding it together, but all Dean could see was potential. And now? Well, now he’s nearly ready to drive her off the lot thanks to his own two hands. He has absolutely no clue what he’s going to do with her when he’s done (another point that Bobby’s made on several occasions), but he’ll figure it out. He knows he will.
Bagyo Bay is a small community nestled right on the rocky coastline and tucked away from the bigger cities in this part of the state. It’s quaint and beautiful and old and charming. The drive there can be described in much the same way, long and winding and full of trees until they eventually give way to rocky cliffs and scenic bluffs. About ten minutes outside of San Seton, the main city road comes to a ‘T’ and Dean takes a right, letting his wheels rumble over the worn asphalt of the coastal road as it weaves in and out along the bay. It’s a drive that requires patience and demands attention, not just for it’s curves, but for its views.
Well, it wasn’t his fault that he wanted to spoon the Omega from behind, take Castiel into the security of his large arms and languidly trace the outline of the Omega’s mouth with his tongue. Kissing Castiel with a fierce yet tender passion, hearing the soft sounds escaping the Omega’s mouth and the Alpha, recklessly trying to keep Castiel by his side.
Dean became aggressively protective of Castiel
Dean could feel his fingertips burning with an eager anticipation, the sea of raven strands was easily enchanting him.
The Omega nodded. “Yes.”
Castiel rested his head against Dean’s shoulder. “Dean.”
John nodded, slowly turning his attention away from the Omega and eating his breakfast. To his surprise, the cake was delicious and the Alpha could only imagine how sweet Castiel would taste on his lips. After spending about an hour in the diner, Bobby paid for everyone’s breakfast. Rufus and Bobby didn’t leave the diner without giving the Omega a massive bear hug along with a sloppy kiss to Castiel’s mouth.
Castiel was literally having a panic attack, the Omega’s eyes were clouded with lust while the Alpha urgently pressed the palm of their hands together, keeping them high above Castiel’s head. They were so close, so
Jack began to scan the items. “
Castiel frightfully but with every care and respect, removed his fingers from Dean’s mouth. Castiel was breathing heavily and his eyes were glued to Dean’s lips. There was a shadow that burned with animalistic hunger and

Garth squealed, “
But for the time being, Dean could do this. Call it a night of redecoration. It was a plan, the Alpha needed to do this right now because Dean had to prove to himself that no matter how destructive he was, there was always a choice of repairing everything he managed to break. And if he did fix everything to his liking, then there was hope for him at becoming a better Alpha.
Dean gave a deadly grin. “Was I that obvious?”
Dean snarled, wishing he could be an adult and take on the doctor himself but since he was still a child, the little boy had no other option but to sit and wait. Dean hated waiting, the little Alpha despised being away from his mother for so long, Dean couldn’t breathe without his mother and that alone was eating him alive.
Although Sam was currently living in dorms, he often visited Dean as much as he could because the Alpha enjoyed the rare moments of brotherly love he shared with Dean. On Saturday, Sam and Dean went out for drinks, getting wasted and having a good time. On Sunday, they went to a diner and ordered burgers — of course, Sam ordered a veggie burger — catching up with one another and talking about life.
The Alpha’s mouth had the only privilege to leave as many marks as the pretty blue-eyed angel respectively deserved. And
Castiel faced Sam, gifting the Alpha with the softest look that made Sam lose all rationality, the Alpha was punching down the primal instinct to cross the room and take claim of the Omega’s mouth, passionately intertwining their lips into an ardent kiss. “Thank you both for accepting me and giving me the opportunity to work here. I promise to leave you both satisfied with your decision in letting me stay.”
“So, tonight is just for me?”
Castiel tossed his backpack towards the passenger seat, gasping tenderly when John’s enormously large hands branded themselves on the Omega’s hips. Castiel was swirling his hips in a painfully slow motion, feeling the hot graze of the Alpha’s jeans against his bare thighs. The Omega rested his hands on John’s pecs, squeezing the firm muscle of meat and slowly changing the roll of his hips into small bounces.
That was Dean’s main priority but being inside this house and doing nothing… well that made the Alpha feel even worse.
Sam Winchester, an Alpha, was in town visiting his older Alpha brother, Dean Winchester. Sam was currently on a short break from law school, taking advantage of finally breathing air without worrying about upcoming exams or stressing about the new material waiting to be taught. The Alpha was keen on seeing his older brother and the mere fact that the drive from his school to Dean’s house was only 50 minutes away, was a dead giveaway that Sam would spend the weekend with his brother.
“Jerk.”
, the Omega’s collarbones were screaming to be tasted, to be bitten, and to be sucked on.
Sam forced the Omega to face him, Castiel’s ocean blue eyes were filled with salacious lust as he met the Alpha’s ever-changing irises. The Omega couldn’t place the Alpha’s eye color, it was like looking into a kaleidoscope; Castiel felt himself being lost in a swirl of hazel honeycombs, sunlit fields of sunflowers, and masses of golden powder fluttering into the air.
But money was scarce and in general, if Sam and Dean worked full time, then their lives would be simpler. Dean wouldn’t have to work long hours, busting his pretty ass to make ends meat. Dean wasn’t proud of it but he’s been sleeping with men since he was 14 and thankfully, Sam was spared from the enchantments whispered by repulsive men who desired ripping away the threads of virginity with their teeth, instead, Sam lost his virtue at the ripe age of 18.
Yet that wasn’t enough, whenever the Alpha moved, the office lights provided the sight of smooth waves colored in dark umber highlights, glittering with soft hints of maple honey strands that made Castiel want to rake his fingers through Dean’s hair, feeling the Alpha intimately. And of course, the Omega couldn’t keep away from staring into Dean’s intensely green eyes.
The Omega stiffened at the request, blue eyes flitting across Dean’s features in fear, yet the option of pulling away from the Alpha was not even remotely considered. “Why?”
the Omega looked so cute today. The Alpha whined a bit, the Omega wasn’t wearing his trench coat today which Dean thought was the cutest thing ever to exist but instead, the Omega wore tight gray pants and a navy-blue sweater, which made his eyes pop out beautifully.
“That’s good to hear, Cas. That’s really good to hear,” Dean gushes with a bright smile.
“No.” The answer is firm and more abrupt than Dean was expecting. “I mean… I’m just passing through,” he recovers.
Bobby doesn’t understand why Dean’s going through all the effort of restoring the F-150, and he’s said as much time and again. He grumbled and griped when Dean brought her to the garage, but after some shameless pleading, Bobby ultimately allowed him to make space at the shop for her - Bobby really is a big ol’ softy at heart, but he’d kill anyone for saying so.
. “...I’m a teacher and my students were working on their final projects this week. I was helping some of them and I guess I may have gotten a little too enthusiastic. Thanks for the heads up, though. I’ve been walking around like this all damn day.” Dean continues to rub at his ear, hoping he’s getting all the paint off and not actually making it worse.
Steve briefly glances at him with side eyes, but doesn’t turn his head. “I…” He looks down at his feet and even in profile, the sadness that washes over his face is heartbreaking. He finishes his sentence with a voice so small, Dean almost doesn’t hear him. “...I don’t know.”
Dean’s first instinct is to get defensive or make a snarky remark, but he realizes in time that Sam’s question seems honest enough. “Yeah. I just wasn’t feeling it. I don’t know. Changed my mind I guess.” He’s not lying. Stacy was beautiful and willing, more than willing, actually. She asked Dean to take her home more than once and was the one making all the moves, but Dean just couldn’t get himself to accept the offer. He absolutely thought about it, of course, but instead of excited, the prospect of spending the night with a stranger just left him feeling empty and unfulfilled. He would rather go home alone than deal with the emptiness he knew he’d ultimately face in the morning.
Dean makes it ten minutes before the worry finally overtakes him and he can no longer ignore it or reason it away. He’s gripping the steering wheel far more tightly than necessary and the nagging feeling beating against the inside of his chest is too much. It’s as though a physical force is tugging him back to the marina.
Unable to fight the urge any longer, Dean tries with everything he has to bring the man in the coat into clearer focus. He wants to see the man standing by his side, wants to know his face. The harder he tries, the quieter his dream gets until the storm plays like a soft soundtrack in the background.
“Aw man, listen to this. I flew in late last night and called Ellen first thing this morning to ask her to put me on the schedule as soon as possible... I was here an
“Coming right up.”
“So Cas, how’s it going? Alfie treating you alright?”
“I was considering that as one of my options. Now I’m disappointed that I didn’t go with my gut instinct when making my selection. I’ll most definitely have to come back to try it.” Cas looks down with a shy half-smile on his face and Dean can’t tell if he’s embarrassed or maybe just nervous. It throws him off because wouldn’t someone who works as a food critic and has a career in journalism be a little more arrogant? No, that’s not the right word. Well, maybe it is, but it’s certainly not a word that belongs anywhere close to Cas. But shouldn’t he be more confident or opinionated? Dean doesn’t exactly know how these kinds of things work, but he definitely had an expectation and this wasn’t it.
If the guy is going to stick with short, vague answers, Dean reckons the next best thing is to offer information on himself, even the playing field. “I’ve lived here most of my life, since I was nine, at least. Well, not
The sky has really opened up now, and the rain is coming down in droves as the wind pushes it slantways. It’s an ominous sight, the late afternoon dark with thunderclouds lining the sky as far as he can see. The news reports have all said that this storm is just the beginning of what promises to be an incredibly strong storm season. The weather has been abnormally mild the past few years, so Dean supposes it’s well past due.
It’s too chilly to drive with the windows down, but he does it anyway, relishing in the sting of the wind at his face. He’s headed towards Bagyo Bay, his favorite place on the planet (well, at least of all the places he’s been, which actually isn’t many). San Seton is only about a thirty five minute drive from the ocean, twenty seven if he guns it, and the closer he gets to the water, the more the smell of the salty air relaxes him even as the air grows colder.
Dean can’t help it, he beams with pride before he gives an answer, but his smile must be answer enough because he notices that Cas’s own face lights up in response. “The next time you come back, which I certainly hope you’ll want to, you’ll have to try the bacon burger. I know it sounds boring and basic, but I promise you that you’ve never had anything like it. That meal is my own creation.”
Popping the top off, Benny slides it over to Dean who takes a long, appreciative pull from the chilled bottle. It goes down smooth and it’s perfect. It’s never too cold for a cold beer.
The guy is dressed in an old pair of running shoes, ill-fitting cargo pants, and a blue jacket that he wears over a maroon zip-up hoodie, a light blue button-up shirt beneath that - he’s wearing several layers, none of which are well suited for the buckets of water currently being dropped outside. Keeping his eyes down, the guy slowly turns towards Dean and appears bewildered and confused. Dean follows the man’s line of sight and glances down to see a large, dirty backpack sitting atop one of the lobby’s chairs.
“Watch your mouth, young man, and come over here and give me a proper hug.” Ellen moves out from behind the bar and Dean stands to wrap his arms around her. “Hiya, baby. Good to see you. Bobby got you workin’ too hard?”
Until it doesn’t.
Benny’s always been the type to take things as they come, never overthinking or overcomplicating things. He’s laid back, tells it like it is, and doesn’t stress over shit like work schedules and angry customers - Dean’s always admired and maybe even envied him for that. It’s an attitude that makes him a great bartender. It also doesn’t hurt that he’s a big dude, so no one tries to start anything when he’s there... usually.
“So thanks for coming by tonight. I hope you enjoyed yourself”, and then, as an afterthought he clarifies, “and not just because of, you know, it being your job and all that.”
Cas is looking at him with a closed-mouth smile that somehow makes his eyes even brighter, and Dean doesn’t know what to say. Cas’s words feel like more than a compliment and his face is awash with something akin to adoration, but Dean knows that can’t be entirely right. He forces himself to respond.
When Dean looks up, it’s to stare back into a set of earnest blue eyes. They are deep and unwavering, but through the intensity, Dean can only sense inexplicable softness.
“Ha, I know what you mean. My brother, Sam, can get the same way. He has this puppy dog look he gets in his eyes and it damn near works on me every time. Always has.” Another short pause and Dean already finds himself eager to know more about Castiel. “So, where did you move from, anyway?”
Steve notices the vehicle and bends down to see the driver. His eyes grow big in surprise. “Dean?”
“Har har,” Dean mocks back. He knows Bobby’s just giving him shit which, coincidentally, usually means he’s in a good mood. Feeling brave, Dean pushes his luck. “How about while I’m out here in the cold, you pour me a cup of that coffee? I know Jody made you the good stuff today and I know she makes enough for you to share.”
The tension that had been wound in the air eases and Steve responds with sincerity.
Currently, Dean is chatting up a gorgeous blonde woman who claims to run a popular food blog, but Dean’s not buying it - he knows how to spot a liar, especially if they suck at it. For one thing, the poor woman suddenly can’t remember the name of her own blog and isn’t able to backstep quickly enough to recover from her mistake. She stumbles over her next words while an intense blush washes over her face and neck. Dean can’t help but be amused at her discomfort, but he’s not about to turn her away. She has a legitimate invitation and Dean makes a guess that Ash has something to do with it. His suspicions are confirmed when the woman looks somewhere over his shoulder and gives and enthusiastic wave. Dean turns to see Ash waving back and gesturing for her to walk over to the bar to meet him.
“That would be— yes, thank you.” The stranger looks awkwardly around the lobby for a moment, as if he’s just now realizing where he is, and Dean wonders if he simply ducked into the first door he could find when the rain started. He then takes a seat on the chair nearest to the front door and fidgets with his hands before finally retrieving a tattered book from his backpack.
It’s clean and crisp outside, and although the night promises to be chilly and perfect for watching a movie in bed, Dean decides to take advantage of the fresh air and the rejuvenated energy he feels with it. He turns right and, sticking his hands in the pockets of his jacket, he heads towards The Roadhouse. As he walks the short distance, he can’t help but wonder where his stranger went. Not
“She’s right, Ellen” Jess chimes in, she and Sam also standing now. “You might want to consider a little extra staffing for the next few weekends to prepare yourselves.” Sam hugs Jess, clearly getting emotional himself, and then Jess trades places with Jo to give Ellen a hug as well. Before they know it, hugs are shared all around and the excitement is palpable. Even Bobby gets in on it, but just for a moment.
*****
, a squawkie little bird. I’m not exactly a Disney expert or anything, but you are talking about some of the classics here! You really don’t know these movies?”
Unbidden, Dean’s mind flashes with an image of taking Cas home to officially meet his family as his… what? His boyfriend?
business but his own.
face.” Sam leans in to lick the tip of her nose, and that’s when Dean realizes that Sam’s face is red and he’s definitely had more to drink than Dean realized.
Okay. So Cas remembers his name, too. This is good. It’s fine. It’s also totally fine that he definitely did not imagine how deep and soothing Cas’s voice is. Dean feels a small rush of happiness at seeing him again, but quickly tries to ignore the jolt of excitement that flutters in his chest.
review drops.
that has settled somewhere in his abdomen. He’ll take care of that tonight, though. He’ll get what he needs and he’ll move on. Easy as pie.
, not a lobster, and he’s a friend of Ariel.” Castiel blinks at him. “
Over the sounds of the storm building outside, Steve speaks for the first time since leaving Bagyo Bay. “I didn’t realize. You said there was a storm coming but… I didn’t realize.” His voice is wrought with regretful awe.
Dean makes it home exhausted, but content with the way the night played out and happy to know that everyone got home safely. It takes him no time at all to fall face first into his bed and let sleep consume him, but another vivid dream follows soon after.
The truck sits under a rectangular tin shelter that provides shade for most hours of the day, but it’s an open structure and exposed on all four sides, which means it’ll be mostly useless if the wind picks up and the rain comes in sideways. The exterior of the truck can get wet, of course, but there are some windows that still need replacing, and he has no desire to clean the interior…
It’s been a very long time since Dean’s seen a rainbow that vivid.
“Oh.” The man stands up and turns his back towards Dean, looking out the front doors again. He’s silent for a minute and Dean begins to wonder what he’s thinking and if he ever plans to actually leave the shop, but then he speaks again; “I didn’t realize.”
The command is as gruff as the man issuing it.
? Disney movie? Ariel is the mermaid with the red hair.” If possible, Castiel appears even more confused as he cocks his head a little to the side. “Really? Nothing?”
Right. No girlfriend talk. He remembers now.
He resists the urge to run after Cas and apologize, or maybe ask for his phone number, or both, but he can’t. The guy clearly has a family. Besides, it’s possible he’s simply misreading the whole thing. He feels like he has a connection with Cas, but maybe Dean’s just desperate. Sam has told him as much recently, anyway. How long has it been since he’s gotten any action? Two months? Three? Yeah, that’s probably it. He just needs a good roll in the hay and he’ll stop obsessing over some guy he’s met all of two times now. Okay, so it’s decided. He’s going out tonight.
When Dean falls asleep, for the first time in a very long time, he dreams.
Finally, Ellen stands up from her chair, sniffles, wipes her hands on the front of her jeans like she doesn’t know what to do with them, and says; “Well, that was all very nice, but I think I’ve got to get to work now.”
But the man in the hoodie is nowhere to be seen.
“Wait.” Jo looks back at him. “A guy. I don’t know, just… yeah. A guy.”
“You’re a ways away from home, then.”
He tries again. “My name’s Dean.”
When he makes eye contact with Sam again, he finds Sam staring at him with a look on his face that suggests he wants to ask a question, but he’s deciding on whether or not to voice it. Dean knows the look, he just refuses to acknowledge it and focuses his attention on his beer bottle instead, taking a long swallow and downing half the bottle in one go. Sam’s not impressed.
Before taking off he gives one final glance towards Steve, who’s walking quickly in the opposite direction. There’s no car in sight and Dean realizes that he’s walking away from town. There’s no nearby hotel or even campsite down the road he’s headed, not within decent walking distance, anyway. Dean’s got half a mind to get out his car and chase after him, but the dude’s a grown man who already said he has somewhere to go. Who is Dean to call him out on that?
“You, too, Dean. Have a good night,” and with that, Cas turns and exits the restaurant as Dean deflates.
“Yeah, pretty much. I don’t mind it, though. Figure I’ve got a lot of making up to do. Ash was basically left unsupervised while I was gone, so I need to assess the damage and all that. Besides, it’s just a bunch of laundry and unpacking waiting for me at home anyway. I’m good here. Plus, I’ve missed the tips,” he says with a wink.
Dean rounds the corner and crosses the asphalt to end up at the front of the bar. He takes a brief moment to glance up and down the street one last time, pausing before he opens the door, his body giving way to an unintentional shiver as he ignores the ping of disappointment at the absence of a maroon hoodie... and sapphire blue eyes.
“Sebastian! Seb?! Seb! Where are you?! Come on, boy!”
“Last I saw, she was lookin’ good. But is everything else okay? You need anything?”
Steve watches, clearly confused. “This is two meals.”
Steve hesitates and fidgets with the straps on his backpack, feet planted and unmoving. “I’ll be fine—”
“Hey, let the man look! Not everyone is as lucky in love as you and Jess,” Ash defends. “Besides, our buddy here is out of practice. He’s going to need some time to get the training wheels back off again.”
this time. Rain’s comin’ in fast.”
“Do you like it out here?”
Well, too late now. That’s done. He pays and then steps to the side and waits for his order to be called. Meanwhile, he looks back out at the bench and the man still sitting on it, and now that he's had the chance to take a longer look, Dean is sure it’s him, the guy’s backpack is at his feet. When his order is called, he thanks the woman behind the counter and takes both bags in hand, passing through the patio and heading for the other bench.
“Doesn’t sound familiar, why?”
The man suddenly stops and looks at Dean as though he only just now realized that he was standing there. He stares at him for a long moment before he finds his voice. “Oh. Uh. He’s a ummm… he’s a puppy and only about this high.” He waves his hand around his kneecap, trying to gauge the dog’s general height. “I think he’s a Visla? Maybe? He has kind of reddish fur and floppy ears, and... and I don’t know… he’s a dog!”
to help him sleep, but after nearly a week without sleep, Castiel had ran out of fucks to give.
Feeling Dean directly behind him makes him feel both horrified and protected. It’s a bizarre combination that short-circuits everything else. Through his rosy cheeks, Cas answers, “No, Dean. Everything’s fine.”
Dean frowned, distressed by the tone of Castiel’s voice. “What’s wrong?”
“I’m not sure I know what you’re asking for. Spell it out clearly, please.”
If there’s a fire pit… maybe there’s something to light it nearby.
Oh… he still tasted the same. His beloved would always taste the same. His little beloved.
Roughly, he grabbed Castiel’s hips and sped up, yanking him back into each thrust, relishing the softness of his round, perfect ass, dripping with slick.
“Can’t we just sleep here?” his tongue is getting heavy in his mouth, too.
“Castiel, how are you? Are you in pain?”
“Cas,” Dean said, awe in his voice as he looked up at his mate.
“That’s what I’m hoping to change.”
A fire blazed within him.
Dean bites his bottom lip, wondering if he should follow his instincts or follow the road he’s always taken.
So they went down the list. Mostly they sold to Omega ranches as breeders. Were able to break into a few, to find and free a couple of claimed Omegas.
And, just like that, they were gone.
“Oh, if you’re there,” Castiel prayed desperately, reaching to touch one of the handprints in the wall. “Please, god, protect us.”
Three days.
But this was… different.
“You’re going nowhere. Not until you’re healed.”
Above him, Dean sucks in a harsh breath, holding it for entirely too long. Cas has to remind him of his need to breathe. Only then does he let out the contents of his lungs in a punched out sound. Cas continues to rub around the ring of muscle as he bobs up and down on his cock. This dual sensation is going to make Dean loosen faster, but it takes more coordination and rhythm than most people possess.
“You’d do that?”
“Dean, no, it’s okay,” Cas said, forcing himself to remain composed even as a lump grew in his throat. “We’ll be alright. You aren’t broken. Look at me,” Cas said. Obediently, his Omega straightened and met his gaze. The Alpha cupped his mate’s face in his hands. “You are not broken,” he said, giving him a chaste kiss, leaning his forehead against his mate. “I love you,” he breathed. “There’s no other mate I could possibly want. I mean that.”
“Cas!” he yelped as he backed away, immediately wrapping him up in the cloak, fighting not to look at his beautiful, lithe form. “You need to stay warm,” he said, holding him close once more.
“You don’t understand!” he said, reaching up to yank her hands away.
But Cas never stopped. Sam’d used his prowess as a lawyer to get Cas out of work for three months, and had done his best to pay his bills for the fourth.
It wasn’t natural.
Cas moves in front of Dean, who is looking gob smacked out at everyone trying to get his attention.
Poor thing had been so tired that the gentle massage had put him to sleep.
“You said you were a wolf, but aren’t a normal wolf.”
It wasn’t until the smell hit him, though, that he lowered his bow.
No, no, that wouldn’t make any sense. Meg wouldn’t poison the prince’s spouse, the symbol of peace between Angels and Nagas. That would be unfathomably stupid.
Sighing, Sam tells him, “It’s a political activism group called DENY.”
Dean flushes under the stare, certain now that he’s been found out. That’s the only reason that this man would be so interested in him. Well, if he’s caught, he’s caught. It’s not going to steal the joy of indulging in this sugary bliss. Defiantly, he takes another bite which is even better than the first. He moans and lets his eyes slide shut as he savors the combination that works together to create perfection.
Frightening.
A quick sketch of the den. Because I felt like it.
But he couldn’t.
“I know. Me neither,” he said, forcing them both forwards, pushing against the current that threatened to sweep them off their feet and carry them right into their captors' arms.
Reverently, Dean bowed to them before leaving them to themselves.
“But it is, Dean. I love you.”
*****
“Dean, I wasn’t-”
It was unbearable.
Slowly - god, painfully slowly - Dean pushed inside him. He almost couldn’t bear it; Cas was so fucking tight and hot, squeezing him, choking him.
It was that damn tea, it must have been. Maybe it had something in it that made Angels trip out or something, Castiel didn’t know, he just knew he felt
“Outside.” Cas’s head is on a swivel, paying attention to every possible danger.
Dean ran as fast as he could towards their little den, torch still lit, and lay the little Omega on the bed. Castiel had stopped convulsing, but he was still trembling, and still so very pale. Dean immediately wrapped him in all the furs on the bed, trying to warm his cold little body.
Dean growled, blood burning feral in his veins. “You will not take him!” He shouted, the runes along his enchanted arrow glowing with power at the beasts’ nearness.
Cas can’t be evil. He can’t be.
“Cas?” Dean said, worry crushing his heart. He felt Castiel start to lose balance, falling back, but Dean gently pulled him into his chest.
The two of them curled close in their soft nest, worry burning in Cas’s heart. Fortunately, the pain seemed to be subsiding.
Dean didn’t think he’d ever ran so quickly as he did then. He ran through the woods, then out into an open field, then wherever the wind took him. Here, in Castiel’s arms, he felt like he could run forever.
With a sigh, he admits, “I can’t, Dean.”
But, that is merely a day dream. Dean is a celebrity of the highest stature. He is one of the elite few ‘Glam Gods’, celebrities that are bred from birth to be the epitome of glamour and style. Dean wouldn’t be content with a simple life after growing up in this world. How could he be? Every once in a while, Cas sees a look in Dean’s eye that makes him wonder if he has Dean pegged as well as he believes. He sees a twinge of irritation that is immediately followed by resignation.
“Yes.”
“That’s bold. You hardly know me, Dean.”
“Consider them an inconvenience tax,” the smirk on the large man’s face makes Cas wish he were big enough to down the man with his fists.
But he couldn’t. He had two more to deliver.
He doesn’t let go of Dean, despite his struggling, until the vehicle skims by within a meter of them. The speed of it is enough to make the plants thrash around like they’re being shaken. When it passes, Cas realizes that Dean has gone still, so he lets go of him.
“No, about the other pack.”
They walk in lock step, Dean following Cas without question. He is sure that Cas will need to vent some of the anger he’s holding onto, but he can wait.
Dean looks back at Cas, assuring he heard him correctly. “Yes, people. They would sit inside the cars and use the wheel to steer them wherever they wanted to go.”
“No,” Dean said, tears stinging his cheeks. “No. I don’t want anyone else, Castiel. I love
“Speak up!” Megara jeered, slapping its face. “What is it? Did you want to tell us how much you wanted to eat our hearts, devour our children, burn our earth? How sorry you are that you won’t get to now because you were fucking killed by three ‘pathetic mortals’?  Is that it? Speak up!” She said, hitting it again.
Dean fell against his Alpha’s shoulder, holding him close and kissing his neck. “I’m sorry.”
The Alphas continued to shoot even as fire grew from his hands, his mouth, his eyes. The arrows merely fell from him, the shafts already in him burning to ash, their torches growing impossibly hot.
Dean immediately reached for the small, black cooking pot that he kept under the bed and rushed to the lake the clean it off and half-fill it with water, hanging it over the fire in the fire pit to get it to boiling. Quickly as he could, he formed a makeshift spear and caught a few fish in the lake, setting the meat, a few herbs, and some of his salt lick in the pot to give it flavor.
“Yeah! I have tea I drink every day, helps me in all sorts of ways, so here’s some for you,” she said handing him a small bag.
,” he spat.
Dean’s body had long since returned to the earth, turning to dark ashen stone, buried under roots and vines and moss. Beside it, an apple tree, planted there by his brother in his memory.
“It isn’t poisoned, I promise,” he said, breaking off a piece of the bread and eating it.
they could deal with Meg.
So it was agony.
Then someone touched him.
“Yes. For some reason.”
Castiel grinned widely. “I like it.”
“Heya, handsome,” she said with a wink. “Don’t worry, we aren’t here for you. All you have to do is stay right there.”
“Cas?” Dean asked as he followed the Omega to his knees. “What are you doing?”
(See the end of the chapter for
His mate. His dear mate. “Mine,” he said with a gentle kiss.
“I think I hear running water.”
Castiel took a breath. “But - but how is that going to
“You’re the one who touched me,” he said, spreading his palm out against the Omega’s as warmth and love and gratitude coursed through him. “You lit my fire. You touched my hearth. You prayed to me. It was you.”
“At this point you’re just wasting arrows,” Rowena said with a sigh.
Suddenly, in the fire, a figure formed, tall and broad, made of flame.
Dean held his love close, his love that was barely croaking anymore, his love whose eyes had already faded to grey. The wolf’s heart ached hearing him in such pain, at knowing how soon he would be gone, tears burning hot against his skin.
“No, Cas, don’t bother. I’m not worth it.”
How long had it been?
“Well, yes.”
“Are you cold at all?” Dean asked as he wrapped Castiel’s arm next. “Are you able to breathe easily?”
“Cas?” comes the wobbly reply. “Is it really you?”
“Your speckles get so bright when you blush.”
But at last, he reached the foyer and shut the door behind him before finally collapsing to the ground in agony, dropping the carton, its broken contents leaking out.
The wolf’s gaze fell. For one moment, he’d been able to pretend he was whole. And now it was over.
And he couldn’t. He was utterly spent. He didn’t even think he could move anymore. He barely felt real. Nothing felt real.
“I-” he said before doubling over, grabbing his belly, wings stretched out in pain.
“No!” he shouted, turning away as tears fell from his face. “Stop. You’re not real.”
“I know, that’s what I’m trying to change.”
“Cas?” he asked, going still. “Cas!” he shouted, rushing to his Alpha’s side.
His brother scowls and leans closer. “It’s just us, Dean. You don’t have to be the perfect Yumeijin with me.”
Turns out, he was. For a while they were softer, but at the very least there was a soft sigh at each released pinfeather. Not so much for the loose feathers, but the pinfeathers were enough. Especially when Dean got to the feathers on the underside of his wings. He seemed to be a
They wade through massive forests of the kelp-like plants, reaching heights of at least ten meters in most places. The plants that have saved the planet, at least their corner of it, have yet to be named as far as Cas knows. As they meander through the dense copses, Dean takes the opportunity to find the right name.
Cas grins wide and sits up to steal a smacking kiss. “That’s a little advanced for today. Let’s get back to touching.”
Castiel whimpered at the feeling of it, quivering, thighs shaking, body utterly spent.
“Are you telling me that…men penetrate each other?”
“Why did you stay then?”
Sabanto: “Servant Class”
“Yeah,” Sam said, grinning crookedly as they stood back to take a look at each other. Sam was much thinner and more gaunt than Dean had ever seen him, and the gold in his eyes was going grey, and blackness was running up his fingers, winding up his arms.
Rocking the distraught man in his arms, Cas feels him right his foundering ship and eventually step back. Glassy eyes, red-rimmed with emotion stare back.
“Yes, I’m fine,” Dean said, taking a breath. “Anyway, what happened was my mother became too proficient at fighting demons, so they made it a point to kill her, teaming up to attack her and her whole pack. They killed her, my father, my… brother.”
Cas sees Dean’s worldview take another tumble through his highly expressive face. The poor man must be reeling from all the unexpected twists and turns he’s navigating tonight.
“It’s Ben, Dean!”
“Wait until you see the rest in the daylight. A broken-down well was here, and I got it cleaned out and running so we have water. I planted some crops last spring, too. I think we might be lucky enough to find some vegetables ready to harvest.”
Dean interjects, “Sam, Sammy, stop.”
Dean nods his head curtly. “I’ll do it now.”
Cas is startled when Dean turns with mournful eyes and steps into his path. He’s taken aback when he hears the words that he speaks. He recognizes the words and gestures, even if he can’t speak them himself. Dean is speaking a blessing for his parents in Tibetan. It comes from the Book of the Dead, and it is sacred to Buddhists.
“Cas. Please?”
*****
“Oh!” Castiel said, unfamiliar with such a concept. It was exciting. “That way!” he said, leaning to his right.
“Very good taste, sir,” he said as a litany of faces flashed up on a small touchscreen in front of him - one of several pages to scroll through. Dean wasn’t on the first page.
I am.”
Dean reels backward as if Cas had slapped him. Cas’s hand freezes in mid-air. Suddenly all of the inconsistencies about Dean connect to create a story that makes perfect sense.
At last, Castiel had eaten enough. His little belly was distended, like a proper Naga’s belly should, and he seemed so be so drowsy and almost giddy.
“Not a monster, a demon.”  Yes, I know it’s a little much, but it goes with the theme of the art or something.”
The door opens on unadulterated chaos.
At last, though, his little mate was clean. He carried him out, lay him on a cot. They hooked him up to an IV, stuffed some tubes down his throat. Said it would take a few days for the drugs to get out of his system.
“What. Did. You. Do.”
“You cook? How do you cook without electricity?”
“They have engines which used a fuel called gasoline; highly combustive and a major pollutant.”
Then, it was over.
“Mmm, it
“You’re so soft, Cas,” he said between loving kisses, relishing the feeling of the rise and fall of his love’s chest, the subtle movement of his muscles. “What do you want, my love? Do you want me to knot you? Something else? Do you want me to pull out before that?”
Gone.
“What was that?” Megara asked.
“You bet your ass I do,” she said, grabbing the arrow deep in the creature’s heart and giving it a sharp twist, ripping the tiny beast’s heart further even as it filled it with killing magic.
“Is that what we’re doing? Is this a date?”
For that is what gods do when they are forgotten, when they are no longer revered. They fade and return to the earth from whence they came.
Dean shrugs, “Me neither, but it’s not my place to question them, right? They must have a reason.” With that, he pushes back to his feet. “I have an appointment with my bed to keep. I will see you in the morning?”
“How did it happen?” Dean inquires. Cas takes in the gorgeous man sitting in his home. He longs for this friendship in ways that he isn’t comfortable admitting. He has friends, but he would never tell them any of this. They wouldn’t understand. They wouldn’t believe him. Somehow, Dean’s innocence is so pure that he believes.
“…Dean?”
Dean doesn’t even ask for real meat anymore. The chef will only give him fish or skinless chicken breast. It’s better if he just opts for plant protein powder. At least that is flavored to simulate chocolate. Come to think of it, he’s been choosing that so long that he’s inadvertently been vegetarian for several weeks. That thought makes him huff out a laugh.
The Angel took a tentative sip, smacking his lips in thought.
“I told her that you were so worked up about the pageant that you didn’t fall asleep until early this morning, and I was worried about your health if you didn’t get enough rest.”
“It-” Dean said, shaking his head. “It’s not like that! Please!”
“I can’t walk around like this,” Dean calls ahead. Looking back at him, Cas realizes that he’s right. There’s no way that he can walk through town with a demon. It would call entirely too much attention. Tapping his hand on his thigh as he thinks, Cas finally points down the street.
He stops then, giving a moment of silence to the family he had loved and lost. It makes Dean ache for him.
an Omega, Dean. And my beauty, I'm afraid I cannot help."
As soon as Castiel was comfortable, Dean walked over to the table to sit at one of the chairs, resting his arms on the table itself. “I, uh, wanted to thank you,” he said, looking down. “For healing my arm.”
“Cas!” He shouted in shock.
Of course, he’d been forced to cover up the real reason that he knew any form of martial arts, which soured the experience. Still, he looks around the room full of glittering gowns and jewels and realizes that he would give up everything for five more minutes of talking with Castiel. The flashing lights, both of the camera flashes and the stage lights, are causing a pounding behind his eyes, and he needs to get away.
Dean made a pitiful whimper before swallowing. He knew what being held like this meant. He forced a word out of his throat. “Knot.”
“I don’t flirt with anyone else. Who would compare?”
“Yes!” Dean said, proudly, before pulling Castiel up to the fire and bidding him take a seat. Castiel complied, stunned at everything around him.
“Well, here it is; my humble home.”
He sets his face and body language to match a perfect contestant and then coasts through the rest of the night. He claps where necessary, laughs where necessary, and gives a gracious head bob when they acknowledge him specifically.
“What do you want from me?” Dean asked, voice cracking. “I thought you loved me. Why did you make me think you loved me?”
In the beginning, he had been loath to put down his lyrics and chords on his tablet where his agent or manager might find them, so he had tried to keep them locked up in his memory. He hadn’t counted on the prolific amount of music he could and would write, so Cas made him his very own treasure.
He wanted it to last forever.
He felt Dean shiver above him, falling apart at the request. “Spread your legs,” he ordered.
“I could guess,” he said, looking down at the frail, lean Omega now curled up in his cloak. Look at him, so small, so helpless. In his Alpha heart, he couldn’t leave him like this. He had to care for him. Some part of him just wanted to hold the Omega close and share their body heat, keep him safe and protected in his arms. Despite his strangeness.
Remembering what he looks like, Dean grins and holds up placating hands. “It’s just makeup.”
is a magazine dedicated to reviewing all the hottest spots up and down Southern California. It’s also renowned for its associated food blog. A good review with this magazine and blog is basically the holy grail of approval stamps and all but guarantees a successful opening simply due to its mass amount of followers. Dean knows that Jo and Ash specifically sent the publication an invite, but no one actually expected them to send someone and, of course, Dean is even more surprised that that someone is Cas.
The eyes that
“I didn’t know you were back - why didn’t you tell me? I’d have come by sooner and we coulda grabbed a bite or somethin’.”
Suddenly, Dean realizes that they are caught in another wordless moment that lasts just a tad longer than what seems normal. He snaps himself out of it as best he can. What is it with this guy that makes his mind wander and his heart race? Sure, he’s beautiful and interesting and somehow different than anyone Dean’s met in a very long time, but they’ve spoken all of two times. He needs to reel it in.
Finally, one by one, they say their goodbyes and repeat their congratulations before heading out to face the rest of the day. Dean is the last to leave, but as he closes the door behind him, he looks back past the bar and sees Bobby pulling Ellen in for a more intimate embrace. Bobby kisses her on the forehead and Dean turns away to let them enjoy this moment together, slipping quietly out the front door and into the sunshine with a lightness in his heart that he hasn’t felt in a long while.
The work day finally ends, Bobby promising to close up tonight so Dean can get his weekend started. He would normally take at least an hour or two and work on the truck, but he’s not about to dismantle the coverings he so carefully secured just to have to tie it all down again. Instead, he decides on going to The Roadhouse knowing Benny’s on shift tonight, but when he grabs his jacket and walks out the front door, his feet don’t take him there. Within a few minutes, he finds himself sliding into the front seat of his car, instead.
“Apologies for the interruption fellas. Dean? Bobby and Sam could really use your help in the kitchen. Do you mind?”
They exchange numbers and after a few additional minutes of pleasant conversation, the two of them finally part ways. Dean grabs that handle of Jack without another thought and heads for the checkout line. Cas continues down the aisle in the opposite direction to pick out some wine for his girlfriend.
As a teenager, he wanted nothing more than to get the hell outta Dodge, as does every rebellious teen who calls these roads home, but as a man in his early twenties with a bit more life experience and a lot more perspective, it ain’t so bad.
“No, no. I understand. Of course. My apologies. I just thought that if you weren’t busy… but clearly you are. Sorry. I’ll just get going then.” Cas takes a step away looking so disheartened that it tugs at something deep within Dean’s chest.
“We’re fine, baby, thanks for asking. I was just telling Mr. Novak a little history about the place, but I think he’s just humoring me at this point.” Ellen turns her attention back to Castiel. “Thank you so much for joining us this evening and we look forward to having you back here real soon.”
, so yeah, I get it.”
“Yeah. Mostly. Did you grow up in Washington?”
Sam tells Dean that he’s headed to the library for a study group and they text for a couple of minutes before he’s got to go. Just as he clicks his phone off, Benny returns with a fresh Blue Thursday in his hands. He wiggles it at Dean and raises his eyebrows in question.
The Roadhouse is more crowded than usual for a Thursday night, probably due to the locals finding an escape from the sudden downpour and deciding to use it as an excuse to stay for a couple rounds. Not wanting to be in the way, he finds an empty barstool towards the far end of the bar and takes a seat, scanning the room for any faces he might recognize.
“You alright there, Sammy? You need a ride home?”
“So what brings you out here? No offense, but you don’t look like you were exactly planning on a day at the beach.”
With that, Castiel turns down the beach with Seb trotting happily alongside him. Dean watches them walk away for just a moment before he also turns away, he and Zaz making their way back up the shore towards where the car is parked. As he goes, he can’t help but feel like he is leaving something behind. He might have actually asked for Castiel’s number had it not been for the girlfriend thing, but even so, walking away just doesn’t feel right. That thought in mind, Dean looks back over his shoulder.
The banter continues and Dean picks up the first round of drinks. If he’s going to invite his friends out with the clear intention of bailing on them before the night ends, he figures it’s the least he can do. Before long, Ash is supplying round number two while they all laugh at his story about the girl who met him at the Roadhouse earlier that night. Apparently, she was under the impression that the event was far more extravagant and that Ash was someone of far more importance. Ash pretends to have no idea how she came to that conclusion, but they all have a good laugh at it and Ash is more amused than anyone, so it’s all in good fun.
Dean walks behind the desk and logs into the computer. He really does have to get to those emails, but when he chances a peek towards the door, he sees that the man isn’t reading, he’s staring out the window instead.
Realizing that there’s no escaping this situation that he’s put himself in, he gives in and gives the girls an answer. “It doesn’t matter. I’m not picking a life partner here, I just want to have some fun.” The second the words are out of his mouth, they feel dishonest. It was his instinctual reaction, but it seems off kilter. Just as Jo and Jess look at one another in excitement and stand up from their stools, he can’t stop himself before he puts a hand out and grabs Jo by the elbow, halting her movements.
“I got a job offer here that I couldn’t pass up. Much like you, I didn’t have anything holding me back in Chicago, not really, so here I am.”
“Hey man. You okay? Did you lose your dog?” he asks carefully.
Dean pulls off on the next turnout and flips a bitch. The sky is dark and threatening and he really needs to get home - this narrow two-lane road is a nightmare when it’s raining, let alone during a big storm - but even the slight possibility that Steve really doesn’t have some place to stay tonight, well that thought makes him feel sick. Dean guns it back towards the restaurant.
The Roadhouse is something that Bobby and Ellen have been slowly working towards for the past several years, Ellen having always wanted to own her own restaurant but putting her ambitions on hold when two little boys were unexpectedly placed in her care all those years ago. Dean’s heart clenches at the memory and the knowledge of her sacrifice and he forces the thoughts aside to avoid becoming emotional, focusing instead on Bobby’s amusing display of childish obstinance.
“Okay, seriously? Zazu is a character from
Cas can’t just casually ask him for a beer while Dean’s practically having a meltdown. He can’t ask for Dean’s company while mentioning his girlfriend in the same damn sentence. Maybe if they were friends first, but they aren’t, not really. If that’s what Cas is trying to do - to be friends - then fine, but Dean isn’t even sure he can do that.
“I have a couch,” he offers. Steve goes still. “Back at my place in San Seton, next to the same auto repair shop I work at.” Silence. “And if you need to be back here in Bagyo, I can drive you back once the storm clears.” More silence. “Is that okay?”
Dean never minds the drive. It calms him, restores him. He finds a kind of solace in this place that he’s never found anywhere else. Whenever he feels stressed or upset, or when he simply needs to clear his head, it’s the bay that calls to him, it always has. The salty air, the rolling waves, even the seagull cries bring him peace of mind, and like the reliable comfort of a familiar song, Dean feels the tension in his shoulders slowly release the closer he gets to his destination.
“That’s rough. So, she got you workin’ shifts all weekend or what?” Dean asks, suddenly aware of how much he’s missed one of his best friends.
They head inside and since it’s already quite late, the few larger tables are taken. Jo spots a small table in the corner that has been recently vacated, so they make their way over, Jo and Jess taking the only two stools available. It’s no matter, Dean won’t be sticking around for long anyway, he has other plans and his gaze immediately starts scanning the crowd for potential candidates.
“Hello, Dean.”
“Hey, Cas. This is a surprise,” Dean says, embarrassingly lacking eloquence.
He strolls along the shoreline taking in the scenery, his brother’s big, goofy dog in tow. Actually, she’s not so much “in tow” as she is running around in the general vicinity. This is why Dean likes the off-leash dog beaches the best; there’s just something wrong about bringing a dog to a beach and not allowing her to run free, chase tennis balls, or splash in the water. He isn’t even particularly fond of dogs, or so he says, but he’s not a monster. Besides, it’s basically free entertainment and exercise for the pup with minimal effort on his part (and if she’s so worn out that she sleeps the rest of the day and doesn’t bother him, he’s not going to complain).
“I have somewhere,” Steve responds defensively, pointing ahead of him. “It’s just up that way.”
“Thank you, Ellen. The pleasure was mine. You have a beautiful restaurant and I wish you great success.” He sounds genuine and Dean can’t help but smile at the compliment.  Ellen looks flattered and she reaches out to give Castiel a gentle squeeze on his shoulder before she turns and heads back towards the other patrons.
“Wait… does the lion have anything to do with the lobs-- uh, crab? I’m very confused.”
“I’m Dean, by the way.” He sticks out his hand for a handshake before his thoughts get the best of him, and the stranger shakes back with a firm grip and long, strong fingers.
“I’m fine, just thirsty.”
“Hello, Dean.” His voice is deep, but there’s a soothing softness to it, too. “I’m Castiel and that’s Sebastian, but we usually just call him Seb.”
“Just get in.” Dean reaches across the seat and pushes the door open. “Please?”
been a while and he’s beginning to feel that familiar itch, that need for intimate contact.
do this to him.
“Yes, it is.”
“You’re right. That does surprise me.”
“Next up!” The woman behind the counter calls, pulling Dean from his thoughts.
As if he can hear Dean’s internal grumbling, Benny spots him and walks towards him.
Dean can’t help the smile that crosses his face right then. He tries to, he really does, but he can’t stop it. The guy looks at him with a mix of hopelessness and agitation, and now Dean feels like an asshole for not being able to control himself. He steps next to the man so they are side by side and he places a hand on his shoulder.
“Thanks again, for finding Seb.” Castiel stands up straight after gathering his shoes and looks at Dean, offering his hand for another handshake.
“Yes. My last name is Novak and I am here on behalf of
Glancing back and waiting a moment, the man eventually responds. “I’m Ca— ” He’s interrupted by a brief coughing fit and when it’s over, he answers more clearly. “My name is Steve.”
“You, too. And thank you, again, for the food.” And with that, he walks away.
Just as quickly as he appeared, the man walks out of sight. Dean has the strangest urge to run out the front door and go after him, but why? What’s he going to say? What would he do? He nearly gives in to the urge anyway, but just as he’s about to step out from behind the desk, the phone rings and he remembers that he’s on the clock and has a job to do. He does his best to shake the unsettled nerves prickling at the back of his neck and he answers the phone. The man doesn’t come back.
He appears to be standing in an abandoned home as a hurricane-like storm whirls and thunders around him. The room he’s in is unfamiliar and he doesn’t recognize his surroundings. The walls shake and the windows rattle and, save for an occasional flash of lightning, the world is shrouded in darkness. He hears shouting, but he cannot make out the words. Suddenly, as if by magic, a ring of fire appears on the floor in front of him and a figure stands inside of it - powerful, menacing, and fearsome.
“Don’t worry about it, I got you. I stopped drinking before Ash finished my beer. Hey Jo, you want a ride, too? Ash left with Katie and Stacy and I’m not leaving you here alone.”
*****
Dean pops the lid off of his own container and begins to eat. He feels Steve’s eyes linger on him, but not for long. He smiles to himself behind his spoon when he hears the lid pulled off the other container.
“I can’t.” Before he can pull them back, the words fly out of his mouth much more harshly than he intended, but Cas
“Hey, don’t worry about it. See that golden lab he’s playing with? That one belongs to me. Your dog came up to us not long before I saw you. Looks like they’re friends now.” The dogs still haven’t stopped their game of chase.
With that image in his head, Dean spends the rest of the day thinking about the beautiful man with the funny name and the intense blue eyes.
“Well, it makes me very happy to hear of their success and I sincerely hope it continues for as long as they want it. It’s very apparent that a lot of love was woven into the foundation of that restaurant and I find it incredibly rare when a business is built on compassion as opposed to a desire for pure profit.”
“Sorry baby, no. But listen, I gotta get going. Ash just walked in the door and that boy better have gotten to the bank on time or so help me…”
Dean isn’t fooled. He notices the way Steve’s eyeing the food. The man is hungry, and Dean knows it, and he’s not about to let him turn it down. “Have you ever had their chowder?” he asks, throwing a nod to the restaurant behind him. “It’s the best you’ll find in all of Northern California, I promise you that much. And I really can’t eat this all on my own. Here.” He sticks out the bowl and a spoon, not giving Steve much of a choice other than to at least take it in hand.
“Hey, I didn’t even do anything.” He reaches out to shake Castiel’s hand. “I’m just glad he decided to stop and hang out with Zaz here. They got in a pretty intense workout. Zaz will sleep for the rest of the day and for
He reaches forward to push his way inside when the door suddenly swings open without his assistance. From the other side pops a guy sporting a mullet, nearly knocking Dean back a step.
“Nah, this is just my personal favorite spot. You’re not getting any special treatment, you’re just getting the Dean treatment.” He shoots Castiel a quick wink, laying on his Winchester charm and then, leaning in conspiratorially, he adds, “Although, I would argue that that in itself is pretty damn special, so maybe just don’t tell anyone.”
“Can it, G.I. Jo.”
Well, too late now. He just really hopes that he hasn’t done anything to mess up this opportunity. Ellen and Bobby both worked too hard for Dean to be the one to fuck this up. They deserve to have everything.
“It was good to see you again, Cas.”
Bobby and Ellen eventually push them all out the door with plenty of hugs and thank-you’s passed around. The group of five walks the few blocks to end up at one of Dean’s favorite bars. It’s a dive of a place, but they serve cheap drinks and he knows most of the bartenders there, including the owner. It also doesn’t hurt that there’s more often than not a selection of beautiful college students who find their way inside. It’s perfect, actually - it’s enough of a dive not to be too popular or overcrowded, but also approachable enough that there’s generally a steady crowd of twenty and thirty-somethings.
“Yes, ma’am,” Benny responds before turning a guilty look towards Dean.
Dean wakes abruptly and during his first few moments of groggy consciousness, the dream sits at the edges of Dean’s mind. The images quickly begin to lose focus and the details are already fading, eluding him and slipping from his mind’s grasp like a receding tide. Even as the dream makes it’s escape, Dean feels it tugging at him, begging not to be let go. He is weighed down with a sense of nostalgia and familiarity, but has no idea why. He tries to hold onto anything he can remember, but as his memory fades, so does the man with the wild hair.
Dean doesn’t know why he feels so deeply for this stranger, but there’s something about him, something that screams that this whole situation isn’t right. Steve’s not some drifter who enjoys spending his time wandering from city to city. He’s lost and alone… and
“Yes, I remember.” The guy looks back out towards the water. Dean isn’t sure if he’s already bored of the conversation or if he just assumes that’s the extent of it.
“Chicago.”
Their drive is quiet save for the radio playing low, static breaking in and out. Dean pays attention to the road and Steve stares out the window.
“Careful, you know not of what you speak. Ellen is never someone you want to underestimate.”
To his credit, Sam simply nods and doesn’t say anything more. They make the rest of the drive in silence.
Cas’s eyebrows pinch together and that ridiculously adorable head tilt is back. Dean understands his question before it’s even asked.
Dean is caught so completely off guard that had he not been able to control the flinch that jerks his body to attention, he would have swerved his car right off the road.
Steve clenches his jaw as he looks ahead of him, probably trying to see if Dean’s right. “I—”
Dean had decided earlier not to tell anyone that Cas was from
Driving out here, Dean doesn’t have a particular goal or plan in mind - he usually doesn’t - but something in the air triggers his taste buds and he finds his way to the restaurant, though it’s probably more accurate to call it a hut than a restaurant. He parks his car and taking a long, deep breath, he rolls up the windows and heads towards the line. Just like everything else in Bagyo, the place is old and rustic, not at all fancy. Weathered wooden tables and benches are set up in an open patio area outside. There’s no seating indoors, just a counter where orders are taken. Dean gets in line.
Dean intends to give Cas one of his devastatingly disarming grins. He means to flirt and to lay on all his Winchester charm, but it comes out all wrong. He feels soft and shy and awkward and... what is wrong with him?! If his awkwardness is obvious, at least Cas pays no attention to it.
pretty Omega like Jack wanted to be his best friend in the first place.
Carpet stained with blood: thrown away and replaced with a newer carpet. Check.
The Alpha got up from his seat, crowding the Omega’s space and wrapping his arms around Castiel’s body.
what was he supposed to say?
The organs inside his body were slowly melting or at least, that’s how the Alpha felt. The brawny muscles embedded in his arms, back, and legs were being pulled apart, it was like being tied at every limb with thick rope and letting the horses pull you until there was nothing else but the massacred pieces of a human body.
the Alpha was the epitome of an ideal man who was godlike and perfect in every way possible.
. A word that was absent in Castiel’s book.  The quick tour of seeing the new town was cut short when Lucifer turned into a driveway and low and behold, their new house was shining in dreadful glory. The house seemed ordinary, in fact, it resembled the houses next door but it was the Omega’s new cage.
Sam and Dean Winchester were inside a vehicle pertaining to the Novak family, it was said that the Novak family was wealthy beyond belief. The Novak family was known for having powerful connections with people of authority, then again, investing their time and money in bonds and becoming stock brokers led to no other expectations except breeding affluent gentlemen who were bathed in riches.
Rufus leaned forward, grabbing John’s chin and forcing the Alpha to look him in the eyes. “Listen boy, you can go after him but here’s the thing, we love that Omega. He’s basically family and we would go to hell and back for him. He’s the only sexy angel we have in our lives so if you break his heart —“
Once the Omega checked himself in the mirror, Castiel turned to face his beautiful ass — mind you, the best ass in all of Kansas — the Omega gave a seductive wink to his reflection and went towards the front of the diner with a smile on his face. Like clock work, their boss was entering the parking lot when everyone took their positions.
Dean stood up straight, puffing out his chest and rumbling happily at pleasing the Omega, the Alpha patted himself on the back,
“Nothing!”
With a rushed
Blood lineage was considered important to the Winchester family, monopolizing the choice of demon mates to ensure the bearing of pure-blooded pups was just as important as making a blood pack with a reaper. Henry made it his solid duty to teach John about the importance of keeping their bloodline clean and never
And boy did the Alpha enjoy the sight of the Omega begging for more kisses, chasing after his mouth whenever Dean dared to pull away.
Dean hated it.
Sam, unashamedly, gave the Omega a flirty smile and sent him a teasing wink while waving hello to him. The Omega blushed underneath the attention, giving a shy smile and waving back hello to the handsome Alpha who was equally as hot as the other Alpha standing next to him. Dean was completely starstruck at Sam’s boldness,
Once the Alpha was satisfied, Dean removed his fingers from the Omega’s dripping wet hole and sharply slapped Castiel’s bouncy ass. It was a wonder, watching the two mounds of fleshy meat jiggling at the touch of the Alpha’s hands. Before laying himself on top of the Omega, Dean mischievously pressed a kiss against Castiel’s entrance, drenching his lips in the Omega’s ridiculously sweet slick.
The Omega booped Dean’s nose. “Yeah. You.”
The years passed and Dean grew up to be 16 years of age while Sam was entering the phase of being 11 years old. In all honesty, Sam and Dean were Castiel’s only true loves. Being a single mom was hard but thankfully, Gabriel invited the boys over to his diner whenever Castiel had to work. Although Dean was old enough to stay at home and take care of his little brother, Sam and Dean always insisted on going everywhere with their mother.
The Omega was never prepped during sex. Nor did Lucifer ever take the time to make sure that his cock was dripping with his Omega’s slick, making sure that every violent thrust against Castiel’s prostate was pleasurable for him and his Omega. As always, Lucifer never cared if Castiel was in pain, in fact, the sounds of the Omega’s pained screams during sex aroused the Alpha even more.
it was barely 1 am.
Sammy didn’t mind.
Sam and Dean heard their mother’s shout, turning just in time to see an Alpha hitting Castiel across the face. “
to surf through Castiel’s messy and gorgeous strands with his fingers. To drown himself amongst Castiel’s perfect sex hair.
Dean drove Sam backwards, crushing his little brother against the wall and loosening himself from the surprisingly tight grip. “Get off me, Sammy! I’m not gonna let you win this bet.”
“Hm.”
why couldn’t he fall for the security guard instead of Dean
Then, as if things couldn’t get any better, the Omega turned to face the Alpha; his chest,
There was a raw need, no, more like a naked

the Alpha couldn’t take his eyes off the blossoming pink color that spread from Castiel’s ears, to his cheeks, and
The summer haze of eagerness for sensual longing was washed away by the mist of clarity; freeing Dean from the basal necessity of wrapping his strong arms around Castiel’s fragile body, taking hold of the Omega’s ripe lips, feeling the softness of Castiel’s porcelain skin, taking the Omega as his rightful mate, and fucking Castiel with an anxious devotion that promised the beginnings of a mating bond.
“Would you like to be my best friend?” Jack asked innocently as he carried two of the grocery bags that were not as heavy as the ones Castiel was carrying.
Omegas will forever be seen as precious sex objects; their bodies useful for sex, breeding, producing as many pups as possible, and most importantly, servicing Alphas and their carnal urges. Betas and Omegas deserved more than bias perspectives tainting their secondary gender but, in a society, ruled by Alphas, that dream seemed like a long shot.
Castiel took one of the strong hands branding into his hips, coaxing it over his stomach. The Alpha snarled salaciously as he felt the Omega guiding his hand over Castiel’s
Behind the secrecy of midnight oblivion, there were images flashing before the Alpha’s closed eyes, it was like being forced to endure the uncomfortably long hours of a distressing film that was stuck on an endless time loop, never ending and always starting again.
There it was again, the flooding adrenaline that triggered Dean to lose every fiber of control, that constricting feeling of being powerless and incapable of doing nothing. The thrashing whip against his back, threaded in weakness and the nauseating sensation of being stripped of his own predominance, made the Alpha bare his teeth in a spiking frenzy.
The Alpha closed his eyes at the benign touch, it was surreal and
This wasn’t Sam, the Alpha wasn’t himself at the moment. It was difficult, well that was an understatement, no words could express the longing pain Sam felt when he pulled himself away from the exquisitely gorgeous Omega, but it had to be done. There was such a thing as being a goddamn gentleman and Sam was going to makeup for his foolish behavior, acing his way to Castiel’s heart.
Chuck gave a playful slap to Dean’s ass. “With this pretty ass walking around, I’m pretty sure my son won’t last 24 hours. This is going to be a wonderful week for you two.”
The Alpha wanted Castiel to touch him, really badly,
Jack released the Omega, lifting his hand and eagerly waving goodbye as he went down the steps. Castiel curiously eyed the Omega boy, smiling to himself and wondering how he managed to become friends with Jack. The Omega waved goodbye before closing the door, taking a deep breath and walking towards the kitchen.
Man, when did Dean become such an old man? This was probably the most horrible, correction, the most shittiest rut the Alpha has ever experienced. With a bit of luck, Dean may never encounter another spontaneous rut in the future… hopefully.
Alpha how potent he was while Dean kept coming inside him. The Alpha came for about five minutes, the amount of semen he deposited inside the Omega was so much that he could feel the streams of white hot cum slipping out of Castiel and dribbling down his thighs.
Well… here goes everything.
For without loyal followers and humble subjects, Crowley’s title of being king meant nothing. So, Crowley was credited with the variety of dangerous creatures that represented the satanic gates of hell. Vulnerable human souls shining in pure starlight were the missing ingredients to creating the damned in hell; hosts were seductively tricked into selling their souls to Crowley, allowing the Alpha king to lock those innocent souls behind bars, rotting away in the dungeons of obscurity.
“He’s a virgin. He’s never slept with anyone before. But you.
You better fuck me up so badly that I can’t walk tomorrow!”
But for now, Dean was fucking thirsty.
“Yeah, yeah. Go enamor some Alphas but Castiel, if anyone tries to harass you, let me know and I’ll burn their eyes out.”
The sight alone would make Sam and Dean go into a painful rut. And the Omega’s body was perfect; slim torso, curvaceous hips, long lean legs, and a plump ass that needed to be covered with bite marks. The thought of Castiel naked, tender, open, wet, and ready for Sam and Dean’s cock was making both Alphas snarl with carnivorous hunger.
Dean Winchester and
all thoughts and actions to prevent this was completely derailed.
wanted to hear Castiel referencing himself as a pretty Omega who was nothing more than a slut begging for an Alpha’s knot. “Cas,
Because their doctor was an Omega, John was convinced that her incomplete knowledge and useless degree was a waste. Mary was dead and there was no way to bring her back. Since then, John became unbearable when it came to respecting Omegas. So, when John’s father died, the image of Henry Winchester was torn to bits by his son.
No doubt this brought a huge grin on Gabriel’s pretty face. “Good morning, my lovelies.”
of the door being opened, a blonde woman greeted them with a large smile and a bear hug that was sweetly suffocating. “Hiya boys!
From afar, Castiel could see Gabriel threatening Lucifer for a bit until his older brother came back into the diner, huffing angrily before calming himself down and reaching for his little brother’s hand. “Are you okay?”
“Do you promise not to hurt anyone?”
It was no secret to Castiel that Dean Winchester was fucking gorgeous. The Alpha’s hair alone was impossibly perfect; strands of hair kept morphing into new colors, one moment the Omega believed that the multiple shades of brown began with coffee-colored strands adorned with droplets of cream but then Castiel could see the specks of cinnamon powder dusting over Dean’s hair.
“Because I want to ravage you right here in front of everyone in this bar.”
“You know that I love you, right? You’re the only thing I care about and after what happened with that big bag of dicks who tried to take advantage of you, I’ve always been protective of you and in a heartbeat, you know I’d die for you.”
When their eyes locked together, the Alpha slowly stood to his full height, never breaking the hold of their stare and trying very hard to keep himself from crushing his lips against Castiel’s chapped ones.
As if being abruptly awoken by a horrible nightmare, Dean was being slapped across the face. The hit was sharp and excruciatingly painful. The dosage of pain spreading across his cheek was enough to shake away the venomous traces of his Alpha instincts that were now silenced. The Alpha felt like himself again, he didn’t feel poisoned by the primitive instincts that controlled him only just now.
Those lovely pink rosebuds would harden at the touch of Dean’s teeth, the Alpha would teasingly pull on the fat nub until his perfect Omega was coming for him.
There, on his bed, laying completely naked with his pale legs slowly opening up for Dean, was the Omega from next door.
Castiel sighed worryingly, he never really was good at making friends. “Sure, if you insist.”
There was a pause, the Alpha caressed his cheek while staring at the Omega as if he’s lost his mind. Then the Alpha’s face darkened, a shadow filled with a sinister glow entered his eyes and, in a flash, the Alpha swung his arm forward, punching the Omega in the face. The force of the punch was too great that the Omega landed on the floor.
mixing their blood with humans or angels.
It seemed stupid to consider this option but Dean felt the Alpha inside him frantically searching for an Omega, an Omega to claim and fuck.
The Alpha was talking to the Omega, their calm conversation turning into muffled shouts. Then the Alpha was charging towards the Omega but the Omega did everything he could to fight off the Alpha’s hands. The Alpha was trying to get a good grip on his mate but the Omega wasn’t submitting to him, and after struggling for a few seconds, the Omega managed to push the Alpha back and deliver a painful slap to the Alpha’s face.
Chuck was displaying a wide grin, patting Gabriel’s shoulder and mentally congratulating Gabriel for being a goddamn genius. “Yes, Castiel. Gabriel wanted rent boys for his birthday so I got him two. The one he chose, Sam Winchester, is currently upstairs waiting to bed your brother.”
“How about afterwards?”
Castiel to be here with him. Compared to all the whores he’s fucked on the block, his sweet angel — definitely not a whore because considering Cas as a whore would be like committing a war crime — was by far the prettiest, cutest, and sexiest Omega he’s ever known. The Alpha’s mind was plagued by the thought of Castiel;
Castiel, by all means. The Alpha felt his body burning with a flaming passion to mark the Omega as his. Dean was on the verge of shoving Castiel against the wall, turning the Omega around and wrenching the collar of Castiel’s sweater to the side, giving no mercy and ripping through the Omega’s claimed scent gland with his teeth.
so gently, tracing the outline of his freckles.
Omega. And
The Novak house was stupendous, Sam and Dean were gawking from the window as they waited for the artfully carved marble gates to open. Once the gates were open, the house that Sam and Dean were going to stay in for an entire week was finally coming into view. The house was delicate in a sense that it reflected the structures of a doll house yet it radiated big dick energy with its enormity.
Well shit.
of every canine releasing Castiel’s marred skin. Dean let out a terrifying growl as he searched for the Omega’s lips, hungrily kissing Castiel and breathing in the Omega’s existence.
Did Dean just die and go straight to heaven? Was this how it felt like when you approached the gates of paradise?
Then the Omega’s eyes.
“Dean Winchester. Rent boy, at your service.”
Dean grinned optimistically; the Alpha knew that the Omega would fit perfectly into his life.
to lay one filthy hand on the gorgeous Omega that belonged only to Dean.
So damn cute.
, the Alpha immediately regretted scaring the Omega but by the time his green eyes found the Alpha responsible for Castiel’s suffering, Lucifer was already closing the front door.
, goddess of time or whatever. The Alpha rested his cup of coffee on the kitchen island, placing the palm of his hands against the marble top and breathing through his nose, trying to keep himself from exploding.
“Will you marry us, Castiel Novak?”
Everything felt worse. Every part of his body was
The Omega sadly pushed himself away from the window, shutting it closed while stripping himself bare. Dean growled wolfishly as he watched the Omega lift his shirt from his slender and soft body. Inch by inch, pale skin was being presented to the Alpha, the Omega was surprisingly muscled, the faint V-line dipping into those curved hips were driving Dean insane.
There was a light billow of orange and red hues that slowly became brighter against the Omega’s vision. The blinding sparkles of the sun caused Castiel to close his eyes, enjoying the wavelength of colors glittering over his closed eyes. Finally, there was peace. Shortly lived but the Omega found peace, something he’s been lacking in for a couple of months.
“Yes, Alpha.”
cuddle bunny, for the Alpha was a major beast when it came to cuddling. Dean would probably suffocate Castiel with his bear-like affection, which was difficult to resist by the way.
It was almost as if he was searching for something, something crucially important to him, something like a
But to be fair, no man was as sexy as Castiel. Sexy being a complete understatement. And
The Alpha stared down at a piece of kale and miserably ate it. “Hey Tinkerbell, remember when I bought this place. I told you that I wanted to help you and make you happy. You were born for waitressing and because of you, we’ve had a huge increase in customers and our business is booming because of your fine ass. You’re the head waitress, Cas. And I don’t want it any other way. Why, don’t you like your job?”
; demons that were of free will, had no obligations to hell, and never responded to Crowley.
Dean rolled his eyes, swatting the older Alpha away. “Please, we all know that the best ass here is me.”
Dean hungrily gave the Omega a once over, making Castiel shiver in disgust. “Not that I blame him. You are a fine piece of ass and you’re loyal to him, pleasing him like the bitch you are. But you wanna know what I don’t get, if he hurts you and you don’t like it, why don’t you leave him? Why don’t you save the whole crying act and just accept that this is your life, haven’t you heard, nobody likes a whining cunt.”
Domestic happiness was equivalent to being normal.
. I’m not a whore like you.”
The Omega pushed against the Alpha’s chest, squirming away from his touch. “
Flirtatious pick-up lines usually ended with meaningless sex.
Dean almost forgot how to breathe, the Alpha felt as if he were in the presence of a sculpted goddess and like a faithful worshipper, he should be on his knees, devoting his entire life to Castiel.
The years passed and eventually Sam and Dean Winchester grew up into two different men. Starting with the eldest, Dean Winchester was the next in line to inherit the Winchester wealth. Once this small fact was known by every rogue demon in town, Dean suddenly became the most popular Alpha in Kansas.
has Dean ever smelt something so
But of course, paradise in hell never lasted long enough. Crowley’s reputation began to subside when the Winchester family — the first pure blooded demon family to exist — began to question the king’s ruling. Disobedience reeked with the name of Henry Winchester, a headstrong Alpha who believed in the hazardous concept of free will.
He should do something. The poor guy is alone and no one is bothering to help him. Dean stands up and walks towards him.
Showered, naked, warm, a little drunk and a lot happy, Dean passes out quickly.
By the time he gets back, Steve is nowhere to be seen, so Dean drives along the back road, the one Steve had been walking down. It only takes a few more minutes of driving before Dean spots him, still walking alongside the road. He slows his car and carefully pulls up next to him, rolling down the passenger side window.
in Bagyo, but in this area.”
The article begins with a basic description of the restaurant - the location, the front entrance, the constructional and design layouts - the boring stuff. As Dean continues to read, however, his heart rate picks up a beat. He tries not to fidget and to maintain his composure as he reads on, Castiel’s words explaining that
He can’t tell if he’s surprised or not to find that Cas is looking back at him, too.
A few days later, Dean finds himself at the end of the workweek. He’s exhausted, but the excitement over the Roadhouse’s phenomenal review has carried him through it with spirits high. He’s also been looking forward to their family dinner and on his way home from work, he stops at the grocery store to pick up a couple of six-packs. He’s standing in the aisle debating on the consequences of adding Smirnoff Ice and a handle of Jack Daniels to his cart when his internal argument is interrupted by a familiar voice.
Dean watches him as he shifts around, trying to get comfortable with his rigid body and bulky pack. He buckles his seatbelt and stares straight ahead, not saying a word. Dean turns the car around and heads out towards the main road again, a sad satisfaction relieving the knot in his stomach just slightly.
When the night eventually winds down, Dean is still too drunk to drive home. Jo crashes in one of the spare bedrooms and Dean is about to do the same, but he honestly just wants to sleep in his own bed tonight. It’s been a long week and he’s desperate for a hot shower, to sleep naked, and to enjoy the simple thrill of turning off all his alarms. Luckily, Jess stopped drinking awhile ago and didn’t hit the hard stuff (probably still too squeamish from her hangover from hell last month), so she offers to drop him off on the way to her and Sam’s place.
There is a silence that settles between them then. Neither of them knowing exactly what to say next, but yet they don’t make a move to walk away either. It’s Dean who breaks the silence first.
Dean mingles with the crowd, helping out when and where he can. He doesn’t have an official job to perform at the restaurant tonight, but being the natural charmer that he is, he mostly stays at the front and welcomes the guests alongside the host. Considering that Bobby and Ellen are the two people who raised him and his brother after their parents died when they were young, he’d do just about anything he could to give them something back, so if he can spend his Saturday night being their errand boy and helping to ease the stress if only a little, he damn well will. It’s the same reason that Sam is here with his girlfriend, Jess, even though he should probably be home studying for his upcoming Bar Exam, having recently graduated from Stanford Law School.
So he turns the ignition and heads out of the parking lot, a little speck of maroon in his rearview mirror and an uncomfortable weight knotted in his gut.
Bobby huffs out an annoyed grunt. “Well, since you’re so insistent on fixing that old piece of junk, make sure you put the tarp on her… and tie it down
Dean can see the man shift in his seat.
“Yeah, sure. I’ll take one more before I head home,” Dean answers. He’s still gotta work tomorrow and while he’d love to stay and hang out, he’s exhausted and there’s a pair of flannel pajamas at home calling his name. Benny pops the cap off the beer and slides it over, resting his hip on the edge of the countertop, giving Dean the impression that he’s got a minute to spare. “So how’s the family?”
Cas is still looking at him with a fondness that Dean isn’t used to and he needs to get out from under Cas’s scrutiny.
“My whole life, aside from living elsewhere for college. This is the first time I’ve… it’s the first time I’ve left on my own.” He lets out a long sigh, as if he’s contemplating his entire existence in one breath. “Anyway, thank you for sharing the food. It was… it was delicious. Please tell your friend that it did not go unappreciated.” He begins to wrap up the remainder of the sandwich and place his trash in one of the brown bags sitting at his feet.
With a small weight of disappointment tugging at his chest, he scans the room looking for Ellen. Now that he’s lent his hand in the kitchen, he might as well find out if she could use him for anything. It only takes a few seconds before he spots her. She’s near the front doors and, to Dean’s surprise, Cas is standing with her. He’s smiling, but there is something slightly forced about it, reserved. The air in the room seems to shift and Dean can feel his pulse beat a few times against his cheeks. It’s a strange sensation, but along with it comes an unexplained urge to reach out to Cas, to make sure he’s okay. Nothing seems particularly wrong or urgent, but he feels the need to be sure.
“What can I get for ya, darlin’?”
“Yeah. I told you I couldn’t eat it all on my own, didn’t I? I love food and all, but even I have my limitations.” Dean throws a satisfied smile towards Steve.
“Not at all.” He gives Ellen a squeeze to her forearm in a gesture that he hopes is reassuring. Before walking away, he glances at Cas and offers him a small smile as a quick apology. Cas understands and gives him a silent nod in return.
“Yeah, yeah. I’m comin’. Hold your horses.” Using the old, rusted creeper, he slides himself out from under the truck, sitting up and giving Bobby a grin as he uses a dirty rag to wipe the grime off his palms before tossing it to the side. He lifts a hand and proudly pats the front bumper. “She’s gettin’ there. I should be done with her soon.”
“Glad to hear it! The recipes are all original. It’s mostly Ellen’s handiwork, but a few other family members have added their own touches along the way.”
“You go home and get some rest. I’ll see you Sunday for dinner at Bobby and Jody’s.” Without another word she leaves to go corner Ash, who Dean seriously hopes made it to the bank on time, for his own sake.
“Listen, I’m not trying to be a dick here or anything, but I’m gonna be blunt. The sky is ready to open up any minute and by the looks of it, you don’t have a place to stay. Let me take you somewhere.”
because he didn’t want anyone losing their cool over it. The nervous tension was difficult enough to deal with, and no one needed the added pressure of knowing they were being watched by a journalist from such a prestigious publication; however, in this moment, Dean is worried that perhaps he made a mistake in keeping Cas’s identity under wraps. Ellen has such a familial quality about her that Dean wonders if maybe her easygoing approach to customers might come off as a bit unprofessional to someone like a food critic. Do they frown upon that? Will the Roadhouse lose points because of it? Wait. Is the judging process even based off points? Shit. Maybe he should have told someone.
Dean doesn’t think about the nearly healed bruise on his cheek, either. It must have been one hell of a shiner, something Dean knows a thing or two about.
Then, then his love spoke.
“I vow to the sun and moon, I will be there.”
He would walk everywhere if he could, but that’s hardly ever allowed. Dean is only given permission to be outside when there is an opportunity to be photographed. When he was younger, especially in his teens, he tried to argue for being given that freedom, but since fans became desperate enough to risk death to meet him, he’s stopped asking.
love you, Dean? After everything you did for me, a stranger? After all you’ve shown me, after all the care you’ve bestowed upon me, after your kindness, your gentleness to someone that gave you so little in return? To someone that hurt you so much?” Castiel said, taking a breath. “Please, please believe me, Dean. I love you. I’ve loved you from that first night. I wouldn’t lie about that. Oh, please, Dean, I’m so sorry. Forgive me. I love you. I still love you. I’m still me, I’m still Castiel. And I love you,” the Omega said, holding Dean once more, burying his face in his lover’s neck. “But I’m not worthy of you.”
“But you’ll freeze to death,” Dean said, immediately grasping Castiel’s slender wrist. “I need to get you near the fire, now.”
Cas quirks a lop-sided grin at him. “What about you? I’ve never heard you or Sam talk about your parents.”
“Oh, so he isn’t completely idiotic,” Rowena said, stepping away as Pamelia took her place. “Why else do you think we had Pamelia’s crows track you since you left Megara’s house?”
Dean is wonderstruck as his hands bracket Cas’s flared hip bones. His thumbs run over the sharp edges. Suddenly, mischief fills his eyes and he grins. “Even if I want to do this?” Dean reaches his fingers into Cas’s sides, tickling mercilessly.
“He’ll be alright,” a voice said. Dean didn’t bother to place who it was. His son was going to be alright.
“There!” She said, twirling happily to face Dean, whose bright eyes were filled with sadness.
Angel
It wasn’t his outer door that was being knocked on, no.
“Come on,” Jimmy said, fighting his own need, a need so strong he couldn’t even bear it. But he just ignored it by focusing on how painful the water was.
But things just kept getting worse.
Everything about the video is wrong. Dean would never drink or do drugs. He would never get into a fist fight unless it was choreography for a movie. He is one of the most even-tempered man Cas has ever known.
“Cas, I- I don’t know if I’m going to make it…”
Dean couldn’t keep himself from thinking of his love, couldn’t keep his mind from wandering to their den. The den he’d made for both of them. The den that was now going to rot.
Warmth slowly left his body, his limbs from his fingertips inward slowly turning back to the ash he was made from. His sight grew dark, and the fire that once burned bright in his heart was now but a cold ember within his chest.
“They definitely aren’t rumors. I’ve been going out there for years. I have a small home, supplies, some food.”
“Stop it!” Dean shouted. “Stop it! Haven’t you done enough?!”
The creature, yellow-gold in his wolf form, padded through the thick forest, following the steady flow of the stream, depending on his keen eyes to guide him in the thick, pitch black darkness. Eventually, the stream opened up to a calm, flat lake. It was early winter, so there was snow on the ground, but the lake remained unfrozen still.
Cas smiles and sneaks a quick peck on the cheek. “Your brother and Eileen are meeting us. They’re coming, too.”
The Naga grit his teeth. “Hello, Meg.”
But he couldn’t smell him.
“My tables are handled. None of them need anything.”
“YOU FUCKED HIM YET?”
“Will you tell me why you’re taking it before you go?”
Heart aching within him, Castiel enveloped Dean in his arms, nuzzling his face in his chest.
“Fear not,” the Alpha whispered softly. “I will do nothing to you or your brother.”
“Of course! All things must end.”
“The two-headed dragon? The pair of spears? Once for a fuck, second for luck? Twice your pleasure?”
“You-you’ve never talked to me like that,” Dean says with a kind of wonder. “I didn’t think you thought of me…”
“I do what, Dean?”
But it was too late.
On their way out of the judge’s chambers, Cas is incensed. “This entire fucking system is corrupt.”
“I have to leave.”
“We’re here,” Cas grins and walks faster and with more intention. Dean trails behind him, not letting him get far enough ahead to be out of his sight line even for a second. Yet again, Dean thinks about how suited Cas is for this life. If Dean was left to his own devices, he’d get lost and die in that gargantuan maze.
Uriel crosses his thick arms over his barrel chest. “They are no longer your problem.”
“Oh, Dean,” he said, holding the amulet up to look at it from every angle, holding it so delicately and reverently. “It’s so beautiful.”
The way to break the curse.
Castiel yelped as thorns dug into his leg, and he fell to his side, dropping his brother, now completely lost to heat, unable to think, only whimper as slick soaked his legs and his twin’s shoulder.
Then he cried out again.
The Moon God.
*****
He lays back and enjoys Cas’s attentions, but hazards a comment when he drops down below his clavicles. “It’s very risky.
Beyond a slight hiss, Alastair didn’t respond, but kept smiling. “You must be ‘Cas,’ then! Oh, he cried for you so much that first week. It’s alright, though. We cured him of that. Got him to stop crying altogether - broke him after only three months!” he chuckled.
“Room #316. Take the elevator to the third floor and make a right. The room will be down the hallway on the right. Remember - no permanent damage.”
Taking himself in hand again, Cas gets into a filthy rhythm, returning the favor of using Dean’s body to aid his rush toward release.
“Thank you, Ms. Adler. I appreciate you coming to see the show.”
“Ah, what’s this?” Megara said with a smile as she reached for something glistening in the water.
And, in that night, the god Dean, the god of families, started from his work, as though his heart had been pierced through with a thousand knives.
“Alright, then,” Dean said, rejoicing at Castiel’s brightening face and his wide smile.
“Eat,” Dean said, warmly.
“No, I guess not.”
“I-” he said, shaking, quivering in his mate’s arms. “I can’t.”
“Thank you, Dean.”
And Dean’s heart broke.
“Keep talking to him!”
of all the angels in heaven. I don’t deserve you, but you give yourself to me anyway,” he said, dark wings wrapping around his love. “Remember when we met, Dean? God, Dean, when I first saw you there, standing, wings flared out like an Alpha, smelling like honey and apples, god, Dean,” he said, holding his mate’s head close. “You were the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen,” he said, lips pressing to his mate’s cold forehead.
“Castiel! I have to see him! I have to find out how to break it!” He said, trying once more to right himself. Megara just held him down.
“I don’t have to tell you anything.”
Yumeijin: “Celebrities”
When his eyes return to Cas’s, he leans in closer. “I thought men only dated women?”
He caged back his anger, instead pointing away.
“I was looking at the number of open tables, sir.”
, writhing on his fingers, grasping at his wolf’s arms. “Dean,” he said, lightning coursing through his body at each touch of that spot inside him, building low within him. “Dean,” he repeated, before something snapped deep inside him. “Dean!” he shouted, suddenly tensing as pleasure shot through his marrow, through his very core, pulling him tight, making his cock twitch.
The more pressure Cas exerts, the harder Dean gets in his mouth. His sounds melt from tense discomfort into languid bliss by the time Cas is coasting in and out of him with full, easy strokes. He had hoped that Dean would like this, had prayed that he would enjoy anal play, but the reactions from the man below him are making him dizzy and giddy. Just one finger and Dean is turning wanton, grinding down on the finger when Cas pushes in. His head is spinning with the possibilities.
Castiel knew he wouldn’t be. But that didn’t mean he hadn’t prayed that it would be otherwise.
“Dude, really?! That’s how Sebastian got his name?” Dean fails at holding back a laugh and Castiel just looks at him with his eyebrows pinched together, like he’s missing the punchline to a very important joke.
“Could that be the little guy you’re looking for?” Dean points to where the two dogs are sprinting through the shallow tide chasing each other, stopping to jump and paw at one another before the chase begins again. The guy peers out at the beach and Dean knows exactly when he recognizes his own dog because his shoulders relax and he breathes out a heavy sigh. He then bends at the waist, puts his hands on his knees, and drops his head in relief. “Come on, man. Why don’t you have a seat - you look like you could use a breather.”  Dean pats him on the back and leads them further away from the shore where they can sit in the sand without getting wet.
“You just make sure you two are doing that on your own time,” the woman says, glaring directly at Dean.
Dean glares at him, but then lets himself be led to the bar by a very excited, if somewhat wobbly, Stacy. As he’s following Ash, he sees in his peripheral Jo and Jess heading back towards Sam. Well, this night isn’t going as expected.
Dean watches Bobby retreat towards his private office without another word, presumably to finish some paperwork before leaving. The responsibility of closing up the rest of the shop tonight falls on Dean, so he puts away his tools and finds the large tarp, throwing it over the truck and tying it down to keep it from getting drenched in the coming storm.
Steve finishes chewing his bite of sandwich before he answers, and Dean thinks he intentionally slows down, delaying his ability to respond. “Washington… state.” The reply is tentative, and Dean makes a mental note to tread carefully.
As she exits the door and he calls out his goodbye, he notices a man standing on the opposite side of the street. It’s
“He really doesn’t seem like he has a care in the world, does he?” The man makes an annoyed huff but cracks half of a smile as he shakes his head and, with it, Dean can see that last bit of tension leave his body. Dean is finally getting a better look at him now, and damn, the guy is attractive. He’s wearing all the wrong things for a day at the beach, but that doesn’t stop Dean from noticing the toned biceps under the fitted shirt, or the strong jawline underneath a hint of day-old stubble, or the immensely blue eyes reflecting the ocean right back at him. The air leaves his lungs and he blinks a few times to bring it back.
Cas is still looking away from him when Dean speaks. “So we, uh… we read your review. It was pretty incredible and I guess my family owes you a pretty big thank you. What you said about the restaurant was… well, it was really special.”
“They’re good, real good. Spent most of my time out there spoiling my niece and nephew and the rest of the time eating as much crawfish as I could possibly handle. Must’ve gone to at least four different crawfish boils.” Benny absentmindedly pats his belly as a fond smile spreads across his face. “Ain’t nothin’ like it, let me tell you.”
later.” Benny chuckles and shakes his head like he should’ve known better, and he definitely should have. “In the last twenty-four hours, I’ve seen more of this place than I have my own bed.”
Bobby, of course, understands that tonight is a big deal, hell, his life’s savings is tied up entirely with the Roadhouse’s success, but he’s always been one to feel uncomfortable in anything fancier than old jeans and a baseball cap. If it were up to him, he’d choose to remain unseen tonight, either helping in the kitchen or working in the small upstairs office they had built above the bar, but Ellen would never let him get away with hiding on a night like tonight.
“Does this have anything to do with that guy you were talking to earlier? At the Roadhouse?”
Dean lets out an audible groan. “Shit, yeah. It’s paint - and glitter.”
Steve looks down the road, then down at his feet, and then at Dean, contemplating his options. It doesn’t take long before his shoulders sag in defeat and he looks like a lost puppy, sad and afraid, and a bit skittish.
His walk home is quick, the cold air nipping at the apples of his cheeks and the tip of his nose, causing him to lose feeling in most of his face by the time he reaches his front door. Luckily, he doesn’t live far; just behind the garage, as a matter of fact.
The room holds a collective breath as the article emphasizes that
