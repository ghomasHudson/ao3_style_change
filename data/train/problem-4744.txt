Sam didn’t look up from his plate. “Well, I saw you slip some protein bars in your pocket. Some other stuff has gone missing too. Scent blockers, the hex bags, some of the books on warding...”
Dean stepped back, holding his hands up apologetically, as Bobby shifted himself in the chair and seemed to roll it into the house. Castiel had seen such things before, mostly in the houses of the wealthy who could afford such things, whereas what Bobby sat in had been cobbled together with whatever had been available from the looks of it, but it was not that that struck Castiel. It was the way Bobby moved it as though he was still not entirely comfortable with it. As though he hadn’t been doing it long enough to know how his body would cope with the movement.
“Look, we’re not all that interested in your garden, we just wanna get our friend back, okay? If there’s anything you can tell us that might help us find him, we won’t get in your way,” Sam offered, the diplomatic shit that he was.
It’s the late hour and the proximity to Cas which means he’s not considering what he says. That’s what Dean will claim to his dying day as he murmurs, “if you’re dreaming...I’m dreaming too.”
The sound of the horses' hooves echoed against the stone cobbles of the courtyard. Given the number of men and horses following and Sam beside him, Dean probably shouldn’t have been able to single out the sound of his own horse, but despite the number of them, there was hardly any sound. They were too exhausted for that.
Dean wanted to say yes, more than anything he wanted to say yes.
“Oh shit,” he murmured, sighting what was clearly
“He saved our lives, Dean.”
“Dean!” Cas snaps and Dean is already rolling off the couch. He’s lost this round.
One final scream from Cas and that was it. Dean threw off his father and charged through the door. The air thrummed with Cas’ power unrestrained and raw but Dean paid it no attention. Cas was lying on their bed, his head thrown back as he panted against the pain. Dean threw himself down and took his hand.
“That’s him.”
“Hold on there, boy. I don’t know.”
Castiel watched Dean for a long time, though Dean’s attention was solely on the ship. He might not have even noticed that Sam had left. It gave him the opportunity to look at him, though it wasn’t as though he hadn’t availed himself of that opportunity whenever he could so far. Quite simply, Dean Winchester was the most beautiful person he’d ever met, inside and out. Normally, such a thing would be beyond him to admit, even to himself, but…
“I don’t know where Castiel is,” she said, quietly, “it is not my friends who have taken him.”
There was silence for a few minutes longer before Zachariah pursed his lips and clicked his teeth, evidently having come to a decision about something.
Somehow Castiel had worked the room and had landed near Roman again, who was looking at his plate curiously.
Not that Dean quite understood
He heard Cas chuckle and then there was a warm cloth wiping away at him. There was nothing for him to do but lie back, relax into the water and let Cas clean him up. He wouldn’t allow himself to sleep though, not yet, though he was halfway there already. A very small part of Dean wished they’d just gone straight to bed but the bed would surely never recover from the state of him if they had.
. I don’t know what fantasies the pirates fed you, but you shall not use them to tarnish the reputation of a man who has kept the fleet afloat. Will you retract your report.”
would not have survived.
Clearly, the door had been unopened since before The Tribulation and it bore all the hallmarks of how The Old People used to live. There was furniture, but it was nothing like the wooden creations of the sectors or the scavenged attempts of the lesser villages. These were soft, colourful almost, though time had inevitably faded the brightness. There were books, actual, proper books that weren’t falling apart despite the pages yellowing a little. There were pictures on the walls, pictures of long-forgotten landscapes that probably didn’t exist any more, photographs of people who certainly didn’t exist any more and posters that advertised popular singers instead of racial purity.
A long time later after the announcements had been made, after Dean’s parents had greeted their grandchildren, after Dean’s brothers had said hello to their niece and nephew, after the proclamation had gone out and the bells had been rung, the feasting began.
“Yes, sir,” Alfie muttered, already turning to obey. Castiel breathed out, a weight leaving him, he knew Alfie would do well, even at short notice Alfie was more than capable of making Castiel look his most presentable.
Thanks for joining me on this wonderful ride and a reminder that if you want more this entire thing was based off anyrei's marvellous fic
The barn where he’d first met Castiel: Angel of the Lord.
Dean dropped a gentle kiss to his crown, taking a moment to breathe in the glorious scent that seemed to cling to Cas; the first flower’s dew, a breath after a rainstorm and something that never failed to remind Dean of the night sky. “I love you too and not just because you can do
“Would you like me to fetch Dean?” Castiel offered when he realised that Sam wasn’t going to open up to him, but at that Sam jerked in his chair so hard Castiel might as well have struck him.
outclassed by
“He’s pissed but if we get our reports in and bring down Michael, he won’t mind.” Dean leans over to kiss him. “You get breakfast, I’m going to shower.”
A frustrated snarl broke from Dean’s throat as Castiel discarded the last of his clothing, while Dean struggled with the fastenings of his cape. Mercifully, Castiel pushed himself up onto his knees, somehow able to undo the tiny hooks with an unfairly steady hand. If it weren’t for the bright gold of his eyes and the raggedness of his breath he could be confused for being utterly unaffected by his alpha attempting to claim him.
It doesn’t take him long to set up their equipment again. He double-checks his phone and sees from the locator that Dean has set himself up at the bar nearest the lobby, no doubt watching to see if Michael comes or goes. A glance at the feed shows that Michael hasn’t left his room.
As though sensing Dean’s hesitation, Cas put a hand on his shoulder. He could have kissed him or held his hand or embraced him. But he put his hand on his shoulder; a gesture that might have been between friends.
When they had cleared the floor, there was nothing to do but wait for the others to arrive with the supplies. Castiel pushed himself up onto an empty cask and looked at Dean, intently, gesturing to the box beside him. “Tell me.”
They were quiet for a moment before Sam prompted, “
The man cocked his head in a motion that Dean would never admit to having found adorable. He glanced between Dean and the building opposite before he said, “I was waiting for my brothers. We were supposed to meet here.” His voice was ten degrees lower than Dean had expected, rough, as though he hadn’t had a reason to use it for some time. He looked back across the road and Dean could have sworn he looked sad for it. “They are late,” he said, softly.
They carried on though Dean noticed out of the corner of his eye Cas adding things to what had become 'their' pile. He tried not to think too hard about what was going in because popping a boner while on a grocery run was hardly his idea of a good time.
“You remember the rules?” Dean asked, as he asked every single morning and it was a testament to how worn the routine was that Sam nodded and said, ‘Yes, Dean,’ without a hint of argument, even though of course he knew, the rules hadn’t changed since yesterday, or the day before, or any of the seven hundred and forty-seven days since they came to this sector. “Don’t talk to strangers. Keep to the patrolled routes. Don’t mention Meg. Come straight home after classes-”
Dean pulled off, but covered Castiel in his hand, pumping him roughly as though he had taken it as a personal insult that he couldn’t finish with him in his mouth.
"Credit," Cas muttered, reaching for Dean's wallet.
Another kiss and Castiel couldn’t help but laugh, wiping them as clean as he could with the underside of his shirt. It wasn’t brilliant, it was barely satisfactory, but it would do.
“He’s an angel!” Dean had shouted, uncaring that Castiel and Meg were well within earshot. Meg had huffed, loudly. Castiel had looked sad.
what you meant and my answer is still yes.”
“Not for a few weeks yet. I won’t be able to see it from here and I’d like to see it properly, so I was thinking of heading out to California...”
Something of a frown passed over Roman’s features but Castiel was still smiling as he released his hand and stepped into the room, without waiting to be dismissed. He could feel Roman’s stare burning into the back of his neck, but he didn’t turn around, walking through to the banqueting hall, holding himself as though his surroundings were practically offensive.
“It’s just...you’re amazing, Cas. You’re funny, you’re gorgeous, you’re smart and I love everything about you. I’m...I’m nothing special. So I figured you’d woken up and realised you could do better...” His voice trails off sounding smaller than he’d like.
Cas had been right. They were quick. It was hard not to be when the angel felt so good around him, canting their hips together, stroking them firmly, murmuring holy words in long-forgotten languages that sounded so sinful when his voice dropped as low as it did. Still, Dean held off. He forced himself to hold off until the air around them seemed to crackle, the car rocking from more than just their increasingly ragged movements. Cas threw his head back and Dean wanted to claim his neck with his lips more than he wanted to breathe, but he wouldn’t move, determined to watch. Cas’ eyes snapped open, unseeing, glowing brighter than the sun as he cried out. Dean didn’t so much feel Cas’ release as he saw it, when the shadow of his wings, something Dean had only ever seen in these moments, unfurled around them as something that could only be described as ‘light’, even though it had no form, consumed them and burst outwards, sending a tremor for miles around.
” Dean hissed, as they stumbled across the dimly lit pantry, “Where the hell are we going?” But Castiel silenced him with a glare. Normally, Dean’s impatience was endearing, right now, with the fate of their unborn child on the line Castiel found himself guarding against it. There would be time for talk, for now they had to get out before the angels realised they were gone. The king too, but he was the lesser of the threats.
He moved around the room, holding vague and superfluous conversations with people he recognised by name or reputation but would never have cause to speak to again. At one point Castiel caught Crowley’s eye and they raised their glasses in a grim toast to each other, but neither did any more than that. It would not do for Roman to see them together, not even the implication of them together.
“We have things to do,” Castiel said, firmly, leaving a chaste kiss on Dean’s lips and ignoring his whine as Castiel pulled away, forcing himself out of the warmth of their makeshift nest and back towards the tomes he had been looking at the night before.
“Other angels,” Castiel said, grimly and stepped away. For the first time, it was him to put the distance between the two of them.
“Alright, listen up Cas,” Dean muttered. “You’re about to see Richard Roman’s base of operations. Keep your head down, stay out of sight and if Sam and I duck, you duck too, got it?” Castiel stared at him, uncomprehending. Scrubbing a hand over his face, Dean sighed, “Just trust us, okay? If Roman’s men see you, they’ll kill you. So just stay quiet and follow us.”
“Can you fly?”
“I don’t know who you’re talking about.”
“It seems so, sir,” Castiel said, a little sheepishly.
Dean snorted, “Oh, well, I’m glad I could entertain you.”
Michael’s cheeks flushed red but he grinned at Castiel, “Nothing gets past you, huh?” He shifted his weight so he was sitting next to Castiel, the two of them leaning back against the wall behind them. “My family have me doing this thing, I’m supposed to be preparing for it tonight but...I thought I’d sneak out instead. Last night of freedom and all that.”
Sam shook his head and Castiel squeezed the hand he was holding, wanting to reassure him. At length, Sam took a breath and looking Castiel square in the eyes he said, quietly, “It hurts, Cas. It hurts when I don’t take it.”
Almost involuntarily, Dean’s fingers went to his cheek, touching where Cas had kissed him.
important.
The two of them were so caught up in each other’s gaze, they didn’t notice Sam approach. By the time Castiel actually looked up, it had been clear that Sam had been clearing his throat to get their attention for some time.
Under normal circumstances, Castiel would have curled up with Dean and stayed with him until he inevitably fell asleep. He didn’t need to sleep and there was plenty to figure out in the twilight hours, but biology had other ideas. Carrying a nephilim
Castiel and Dean were still hiding out in the old barracks with mostly Adam for company. Sam couldn’t have stayed away too long without arousing suspicion, especially with Castiel’s in-laws orchestrating the search from Sam’s own garrison. The king and queen continued to pay no attention to Adam and so didn’t notice in the slightest that he wasn’t present for the search effort. He did slip back to the fortress occasionally but that was mostly to fetch things that Dean needed or to pass messages between them and Sam.
She might have opened her mouth to speak but Dean turned on her the moment she was close enough and demanded, “What the hell is going on? Where the hell is Cas?!”
“I think it’s wonderful,” Castiel said when it became clear Dean was waiting for a reply. In return, he was rewarded with a beautific grin that warmed Castiel to his very core as the night chill set upon them.
“Is it Roman?”
“You have women in your crew?”
Dean was about to say something, what he hadn't figured out yet, but he was sure his brain would catch up. Before he could Cas rolled his eyes.
Dean’s head jerked up with such force, Balthazar would have had less effect if he’d struck him. “I thought...I thought you were the captain.”
“You okay there, buddy?” asked Dean after he’d been quiet for longer than normal.
“You don’t have to. I’m clean and I know you are. I saw your test results.”
!” the guy breathed, looking at Castiel like he was a marvel. Though Dean supposed, he really was. “That was
Or at least it should have been, but then...there were the screams. Even through several locked doors, Dean could hear them. As could everyone else. He recognised them as Sam and when he’d first heard them on the second day of his and Cas’ self-imposed quarantine he'd had to stop himself from breaking the door down. Dean would know his brother anywhere and Sam was screaming loud enough it was a wonder the demons had not assumed it another summons to battle. Dean and Adam had hovered beyond the door, but the guard, pale-faced and terrified had assured them Cas had said it would be okay. He didn’t look convinced. Sometimes Dean wondered what the man would do if he just outright ordered him to open the door, but Cas had said Sam would be okay and...he trusted Cas.
Cas lies back down with relative ease but it takes Dean a few more minutes before he can do the same. Even when his head is back on the pillow, he finds he cannot relax. Not totally. He figures he can feel the remote under his head even though he knows it isn’t. His fingers itch with curiosity but he needs to be mature. He needs to ignore the warmth of Cas through the covers and fall asleep. He needs to-
“I never cared about that,” Dean admitted, “I’m just glad they’re healthy and strong.”
The man,
“And I’ll still need your help managing the men,” Sam said. “There’s going to be a lot of rebuilding to do and you can bet your ass we’re going to be the ones to lead it. I’ve already started drawing up some plans but I’m going to still need my right-hand man.”
“Ishim...tried to kill me?”
, and so every day, Dean went to the railing and looked out to sea.
“I can,” Cas smiled, patiently and the instinctive hardness that had risen in Dean melted away. He had never had anything to worry about, his mate would not disappoint, greeting Adam as an equal.
closed on her quarry with far greater swiftness than Balthazar had predicted. Their advantage would only last until the bad weather that engulfed the other ship met them, but it was an advantage nonetheless.
Again Gabriel waggled his eyebrows. “If I’d known I could have it this good I’d have gotten tamed a long time ago.”
He wasn’t entirely sure what it was he was going to say, and before he’d properly considered what it was he was doing Castiel had risen and he heard himself say, “Dean?”
Castiel passed his glass to Balthazar who was hanging onto the rigging beside him, they were close enough that they could read the ship’s name Impala, picked out in gold across the stern.
Castiel leaned back into his chair and sighed, he would like nothing more than to sink, burn or take her a prize, but first, he’d have to bloody well find her and the
Castiel rolls off him, lying on his back and staring at the ceiling, thoroughly satisfied.
“Me...and Cas?”
“A banquet, Cassie?” Balthazar asked, suspiciously, “What banquet would this be?”
Even before he had left the cabin he was aware of the flurry of activity beyond the doors. It was not something he heard so much as something he felt. Castiel didn’t have to captain the vessel to feel the low buzz of excitement that could only come from the promise of action or a change in routine, however slight. Naturally, this being a pirate ship he wasn’t sure what to expect. What he absolutely did not expect was to find the ship hove to trading goods with another ship. Another ship that he recognised.
“Come here,” Cas said again, this time just outright pulling Dean against him.
Dean was looking through the things Sam had packed for him when he paused at first the touch, then the sight of a battered novel.
“Yeah, well,” Dean mumbled, still unwilling to relinquish his position beside Cas. “They wanna take the baby.”
Not for the first time Adam glared at him as though he couldn’t quite believe Dean was the oldest and therefore the heir. “No, Dean, I didn’t mention the possibly mythical crook belonging to a demon that may not have ever existed as a means to end the very real war. Especially as it’s thought to be locked within Hell itself, assuming it exists at all. Sorry I didn’t instantly think to launch an expedition into Hell to find the crook, which, again, in case you didn’t catch it, might not exist, before recalling all the demons and having the gates of Hell sealed simultaneously across Purgatory and Earth.”
Dean woke to find that Cas was not in his arms where he’d left him and there was an unfamiliar guard on the door. The man had barely finished saying that Sam had fallen ill before Dean was already running across the fortress, looking for his brother and wondering why his mate hadn’t seen fit to wake him in such an emergency.
He didn’t recognise the guard outside the door that led to Sam’s chambers either, but the man had the audacity to stop Dean before he could go through.
“It’s true though,” Castiel smirked, “We’re not going to look at our new bed unless I can keep you in it.”
“You were afraid?” Castiel smirked, arching an eyebrow.
“Cas,” Dean breathes. His name on Dean’s lips is a prayer. It brings him to a stop, looking down into those beautiful, green eyes that pin him in their intensity. Castiel slides off and rolls Dean onto his stomach, kissing the expanse of his shoulders. This way Dean won’t see the emotion in Castiel’s eyes. He won’t see that Castiel never wants to let this go. He should never have allowed himself to get this involved. It’ll break his heart when Dean walks away. But with every breathy sigh of satisfaction as Castiel trails kisses down his back, he dares to hope. Maybe Dean won’t walk away.
"What’s wrong with our horses?” Dean asked, noting the unfamiliar steeds being led to them.
“And...” she said, drawing them in with her words, “Was your heat due these last two weeks?”
“Cas,” Dean breathed, “We can’t- We don’t have-”
For a moment it looked as though Dean might wave the prospect away, but he didn’t. Instead, he turned to Castiel with almost a smile. The hint of half a smile at least. “Yeah?”
Castiel moves his hands to grip Dean’s hips, driving into him at an almost punishing speed, trying to hold back the sounds that desperately want to burst from his chest. He’s not going to call Dean’s name right now. He’s not going to do that.
Cas’ smile didn’t diminish in the slightest. “Alstroemeria, red tulips, red carnations-”
to Cas’ lips which was never a safe train of thought to follow. What Dean would like to do to Cas’ lips would give way to what he’d like to do to Cas’ neck, his chest, those hip bones he can’t help but spy when Cas walks around with just a towel after a shower and...
“And look at you now, having dinner with a pirate.”
“I do beg your pardon, sir,” Castiel said, coldly, “but I do not believe you are on first name terms with my brother.”
and blowing away your mizzenmast.”
Dean can’t help himself. He’s never been this close to Cas before and he’s been plenty close to Cas in the past. Without so much as a rustle of the covers he reaches out and lets his fingers lightly card through Cas’ hair. It is every bit as soft as Dean has imagined it to be. The thought makes him smile but the realisation that he’s made a terrible mistake has him pulling his hand back as though scalded. He shouldn’t have- He really shouldn’t have. Cas is sleeping and now Dean knows what his hair feels like against his skin. Now he knows what it would feel like to tangle his fingers into that hair and how it would feel beneath him. And Cas…
They paused there for a moment before Sam and Dean cautiously pushed themselves up to look at whatever they had seen to make them hide. Slowly, trying to make as little noise as he could, he pulled himself up beside them and looked, though he didn’t quite understand what it was he was looking at.
Cas can obviously hear him considering it. “Dean, if you’re going to press it, press it now so we can get it over with and go to sleep.”
Dinner with Dean.
“Then I think it a good thing she sails with you, I doubt the pirates will have the luck they had last time against two of you.”
“I’m resting,” Dean insisted, his mouth passing over Cas’ shoulder. He didn’t feel so tired anymore.
“We should probably head for Nassau.”
“We need to talk,” Sam said in his firmest ‘
,” he hissed, “but I’d prefer ‘Captain.’”
“About what?”
Should have been.
Castiel cocked his head, where else would he go? “They will be here.”
Nobody around him even looked up.
The guard scoffed lightly, not surprised in the slightest and gave a quick salute. “Of course, sir. I’ll go now.”
It looked like Cas might reply, but Dean interrupted them. He hadn’t meant to, but he couldn’t stop it. He started laughing, not just that but he doubled-over, gut-wrenching hysterics escaping him as he clung onto the edge of the table to steady himself. Cas turns everything they know about him on his head and Sam’s first thought was the nerdy shit. Of course it was.
Dean snorted, fully aware that his driving was shaky at best, “Sure, Cas. Whatever you say.”
“Sorry about this Benny,” Dean muttered, as they approached, but Benny just shrugged.
Shaped like an egg and has a wire...
“Alright, if you say so,” he said, quietly, but he didn’t sound convinced.
From the moment Castiel took his first breath beyond the confines of Dean’s cabin, he realised what a fool he had been to lock himself away. The fresh air was revitalising, and he inhaled it deeply, feeling his spirits lighten just from being in the open air. He’d put his coat on, but it felt too warm in the heat of the sun and he envied Dean’s plain shirt.
For Dean, it started as a swell of emotion deep in his gut, sheer joy that could only be expressed with an incredulous laugh until the two of them were clinging to each other again, this time to keep each other standing.
The merchant was still calling to them when Castiel handed the glass back to wherever it came from.
” Dean couldn’t help muttering under his breath.
Cas looks so peaceful when he sleeps. His default expression is usually a frown except around Dean that is. With Dean, he’s always laughing, always smiling. It’s not that he’s miserable otherwise but...no one makes him laugh like Dean. It’s something Dean has always treasured in the small part of his heart where he allows himself to think about Cas like that. Along with the way Cas looks up at the stars as if he can see something wondrous that no one else sees. The way he always groans at the first bite of the burgers Dean makes. The way he always makes sure to ask after Sam and knows Dean’s brother’s schedule better than Dean knows his own.
Sam folded his arms, annoyed but that was probably because Dean had actually placated him. “Yeah, well, you better,” he muttered, “It’s your turn to cook.”
“That’s what you said last time,” Cas rasped and Dean couldn’t help but laugh.
Sam held his hands out, “No idea, you hear them more than me.”
“Cas?” Dean breathed.
“So, how about it, you wanna go tour our new home?”
“Yes?” Cas asked, gruffly.
They stayed in the courtyard long enough to watch the last of the men drift towards the barracks, only four less than they’d started, but then the demons seemed more interesting in picking them off one by one, gradually wearing them down than killing them all. They’d be able to take the fortress with one well-coordinated attack at this rate and Dean thought it might be too much to hope that they didn’t know it.
Cas dropped back against the pillows, his face paler than Dean thought he had ever seen it which just made the flush in his cheeks seem more pronounced. Sweat clung to his skin and Dean had never wanted to kiss him so much in his life.
“I am so happy for you guys,” Sam said, warmly. Castiel couldn’t help but smile back at him, across the room Queen Mary kept glancing up at them, shooting them an enthusiastic wave when she caught his eye. This was his family. He was aware that there was a lump in his throat, this was a world away from what he had imagined, even before he’d met ‘Michael’.
There was movement beside him and Dean clocked it in the corner of his eye but took a beat too long to realise what it was. At first he thought it was just one of the women, shifting as she slowly came back to reality but then Sam shouted to him and he knew something was wrong.
This time when Dean looked over he caught Cas’ eye and the mirth there. They both laughed aloud even though Dean was only vaguely aware of what it was he was laughing at. Somewhere in the back end of his memories, he could hear Zachariah saying,
Cas goes boneless beneath him, pulling Dean in for a long kiss, letting him use his body to chase his own release which is hardly far behind. “Fill me,” Cas whispers directly into Dean’s ear. “Let me feel you.”
“I’m alright!” Dean insisted, but Charlie wouldn’t let him up. “Come about!”
“I’ll do it,” Castiel said, quietly, yet somehow with enough authority that Adam’s protest died on his tongue and Sam fell silent. Dean, however, did not look impressed.
Dean shook his brother off, “What the hell are you doing here? Does anyone else know you’re here?”
Nobody stopped them as they slipped out, not that anyone could have given that Dean was now the ruler of everyone present. It could not have been more obvious what they were doing. They practically ran from the room, Dean pulling Castiel along behind him, seeing as he knew where the rooms were. It should only have been a short walk to the other side of the palace, but it seemed to take ten times longer given how they couldn’t keep their hands off each other. More than once Castiel pressed Dean against a wall and kissed him to within an inch of his life. More than once Dean returned the favour.
“Wait!” Dean says as the idea strikes him. “If we can’t go out, you can’t see your planets.”
Sam and Dean watched her leave with mirrored expressions of disbelief. “Uh...yeah,” Sam said, eventually, “and please, you guys, I know you’re going to be...busy,” he swallowed, awkwardly, “but will you please answer your phones? Even if it’s just a text.
“We got two frigates on our tail and they’re closing. Fast,” Benny added, tossing a glass to Dean and gesturing in the vague direction that he should look. Dean shook himself down, as though he could shake the melancholy that had hung over him for the last few weeks as he extended the glass and saw what Benny was talking about.
“Dean, your brother Sam...” Cas said, casually, but Dean frowned. He could hear how careful Cas was being, as though he were forcing himself to be deliberately nonchalant. “Does he seem...entirely well to you?”
“Always,” he said, softly.
“What you got, Sam?”
“For what?” asked Dean, after he failed to elaborate further.
The man frowned, scratching the back of his neck in an entirely nervous gesture. “Don’t look at me, it was nothing to do with us.”
“Yup, heard it off one of his goons. They’ll be clearing off soon I imagine. Crowley’s taking over.”
He wondered if Clarence hated saying it as much as he did.
“Dean, they’re a little off their route,” Charlie said warily, coming forward with a map she had drawn several lines over.
Cas flicked through some of the papers, “they came in from sector nineteen about three weeks ago.” He paused, looking up at Dean for a moment, “you came in from sector nineteen didn’t you?”
The king looked past Dean and Cas to Sam, a hard expression on his face as he asked, “Has it gotten
a request.
“Your funeral,” Adam mumbled, turning his attention back to the paper, but he didn’t offer anything more. “Oh,” he called, suddenly, as Castiel started for the door, “Did...Did you ask Dean about our plan?”
“Too much hassle,” the man shrugged, but Castiel wasn’t convinced, not that he was in a position to argue for his own ransom. “We’ve got a stop to make before we head for port but,” he gestured to the cabin, “You can bunk in here. I usually share with my brother but he’s been in Eileen’s cabin since we set sail.”
And Castiel let him.
“No, I-” Castiel sighed, marshalling his thoughts, “I understand
The old joke earned him an eye roll from Sam, Sam would be the first to argue the point. Without Dean, Sam wouldn’t have made it out of Sector Nineteen and even if he had he wouldn’t have survived the journey to the sector they currently called home. Sam started clearing up their bowls, “Clarence says he’s sorry about Meg, he’ll have words with her later,” he said, quietly.
Behind him, he heard Benny roar out, “open fire,” but even in the chaos, he calculated that they were on the wrong tack to do any real damage. He turned to look for Dean, but couldn’t see him where he had been standing a moment ago.
“So, Castiel, you’re going to be fighting with us, then?”
When Dean opened his eyes Cas had tackled the djinn to the ground and was stabbing at him with his angel blade making sure that there was no chance he could come back from it. Queenie was sprawled on the floor in front of Dean, grinning at him even though her chest seemed to be heaving with the effort of breathing.
“Our horses came from the palace,” Castiel answered for Sam, aware that all three of the brothers were looking at him in surprise. “They won’t be used to the terrain, the proximity of the demons or the brimstone would likely scare them.”
Dean scowled and went back to watching the rain. He hated that thing. He’d hated it when it had jumped into the road and forced Dean to spin Baby off the road. They hadn’t hit the tree but it had been too damned close for Dean’s liking.
Dean watched the rain pounding against the ground outside.
, but then nothing about this situation was particularly normal.
“Dean, it’s me-”
Castiel looked up at him, trying and failing to ignore the heavy ring of black in Sam’s eyes. It was clear that Sam believed what he was saying.
At first, Castiel had not known what was happening. It had been late, so late it might have been considered early and the clanging of the bell echoed through the hall, jerking Castiel, Dean and anyone else who had been lucky enough to be sleeping rudely into the world of the waking. Dean had thrown himself out of the bed, almost falling over himself as he pulled on his leather armour. It wasn’t the best he had, but it was the easiest to don.
Castiel frowned, he could not tell the time, not precisely, but he knew it was around now they should be meeting. He sniffed the air, surreptitiously, yes...it was about right. About five thousand years had passed since Castiel had spread his wings around a planet in its infancy and turned his gaze outwards, protecting it from anything that threatened it. His watch had ended and he had returned, here, to this place, where the others were supposed to meet him and return him to Heaven. His brothers were not here yet, but, he sniffed the air again, they would surely not be long.
Dean’s lips broke into a wide grin when he saw the pie, “Is that the toffee apple? Man, you never have any of that left.”
Dropping heavily into a chair, Balthazar looked as though he might be weeping. “You’re mad. Do you know that? Roman is a renowned crack-shot. You have actually run mad.”
He turns his attention to the bag and sees that Dean has left him breakfast. The thought makes his heart soar.
Dean nodded, but there was no question. Not really. If the impossible was needed to safeguard the life of their child, the impossible it would be. “I love you,” he said, regretting the tone of finality that crept into his voice. Cas didn’t mind. In fact he smiled, leaning in to kiss him, returning the sentiment.
“We figured,” Dean grumbled because even Adam had worked that much out. “Just...tell us what happened.”
“Alright,” Cas grinned. “The three of us.”
The haze subsided and Dean lazily kissed at Castiel’s mating mark, laving it with his tongue to clean it, feeling a warmth settle in his body as his own mark took hold. They were mated. They were forever joined. Forever attuned to each other. They would never be parted, not even in the next life. Already their bodies were drawing closer even as they lay against each other. Dean ran his fingers through Castiel’s hair, trailing kisses along his neck, reverent and worshipful.
“He said he wanted it to be special,” Eileen said, expressing her words as much with her hands as her voice.
Dean rolled his eyes, “Place called Baker City, Oregon,” he added when Castiel raised an eyebrow, “Yeah, I had to look it up too,” he smirked. Out of his satchel, he pulled a series of paper folders and slapped them down in front of Castiel, gesturing for him to read them. “This week I’m an expert on djinn.”
Castiel stepped forward, just as Dean called over his shoulder. “Come about.” He passed the glass over to Castiel and helped him up into the rigging. “Look.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean sighed, scrubbing his face in a gesture entirely borne from nervousness, “Listen, I’m really sorry, but I gotta close up.”
“Sam?”
It was still day, the sun had not yet set, but it seemed much later under the black clouds that choked the sky, belching forth from over the hills. The demons had obviously set up a camp of their own just beyond the horizon and where the demons went, hellfire followed.
He did not recognise the sound he made when he caught the familiar scent on the air. It was somewhere between a cry of relief and a sob. It wasn’t until he felt Castiel’s strong arms around him that Dean realised he was actually crying, huge sobs that wracked his body as they escaped him and he clung to his mate.
“Mild?” Cas snapped, affronted, “
“Alright,” he said, more to himself than her. “Let’s do this.”
The other ship came around and Dean caught Benny’s eye and they exchanged a look. They’d faced bad before, but this was pretty bad. The two of them braced themselves, waiting for the shots to come.
There was no one here who knew him.
“The Norm is the Image of God,” Dean heard himself saying it before he realised he was speaking. He didn’t want to be here, but he could not leave and when the crowd’s blood was up, which it inevitably would be, if he wasn’t seen to participate not even his uniform would save him.
“Yes, well, for my family it was as much about getting rid of me as adding some prestige to their name. I have several brothers, older and younger...I’m not even the only omega, this is the only way I could be useful to them.” He broke off when he saw that Michael looked distraught, “Anyway,” he added, hastily, “I don’t mean to burden you with my problems. I’ll figure it out.”
Michael gave an awkward shrug, “Yeah, but...I mean at least I get to stay around them y’know. I don’t have to give up the life I have here,” Castiel saw his eyes flicker towards the castle, probably because it dominated the horizon. “You’ve given me a lot to think about, Clarence,” he said, softly.
“You’re not going to demand my sword?”
“Sam-” Dean began, his relief to see his mate hardly touching the concern for his brother.
Dean has never in fact been a particularly vocal lover, preferring his body to do the talking for him, but Cas is taking him apart and he can’t do anything but groan Cas’ name. He’s begging but he doesn’t know what for. Cas’ tongue is hot against his length pressing up and curling around him sinfully. He can’t stop the moans and whimpers as he forces his hips to keep still under Cas’ grip, letting Cas control the pace with that glorious mouth of his. Cas looks up, blue eyes lock with green and then Dean is babbling. Honest-to-God babbling and Cas reaches up, giving Dean his fingers which he sucks into his mouth desperately.
“Your bath is ready, Dean,” Andrea called and Dean rose from his chair, heavily.
It was almost funny, the way Dean had given the orders to sink a ship that was already beaten, but seemed cowed under just the hint of admonishment from the older man.
It was a redundant question, had they sighted their quarry the ship would be a mass of gunpowder and drums, rather than a relatively peaceful cruise, disturbed only by the necessity of changing the watch. Castiel, therefore, made no response.
“Is that-”
He gestured for a woman, dressed in what looked like sackcloth decorated with crosses, to step up and Dean braced himself. It might be anything from someone with an extra toe to a cat with no tail. Dean’s breath left him all at once when the woman stepped up with a box. A relatively small box, nowhere near big enough to seal a person in, not even a kid.
Dean drops into the couch and realises it’s only a two-seater just before Cas sits down on the legs he is already stretching out. They fall into a familiar, comfortable silence as Cas orders the pizza and Dean flicks through Gabriel’s channels. If all else fails there’s always Netflix.
Dean paused at the sight of it, Sam hesitant beside him.
from the other side. But there was no time to worry about that.
“I’m not sleeping in that,” Dean says even though he would naturally offer to take the sofa. But he feels like it’s important to put it out there straight off the bat.
“Why?” Gabriel asked, not looking up from the letter he was holding in his hand, “Perks of owning the place, surely? Besides, I know you got it.”
Castiel was so deep in thought he barely noticed when Sam and Dean both dropped to the ground. The first he knew of it was when Dean pulled him down harshly, pushing his back against a series of roots that had lifted themselves from the ground. Whatever retort Castiel might have made was lost as Dean clapped his hand over Castiel’s mouth, gesturing for him to stay quiet.
Dean’s heart had gone from pounding out of his chest to hardly beating at all. The breath he’d taken had been knocked out of him and was showing no sign of returning. Sam’s words settled into his soul with a chill.
Just for a minute.
Cas smiled softly, “Dean, it was you who stuck by me, in spite of the “whole angel thing”.”
“You and Cas,” Sam said and Dean put on his best poker face even though he was fairly sure he was having a heart attack.
He was going to drag Dean out of Hell whether he wanted to leave or not. He just needed to find-
“He’s just scared, Dean,” was all Cas had said to that, as though Dean was the dumb one for asking.
in the admiralty.”
The small gathering around the grave started to relax and a handful of people drifted away. The sheriff looked up and happened to catch Dean's eye. He took in the suit and saw that Dean was clearly waiting for him. He gestured that he'd be along soon.
Scents didn’t lie. He didn’t know how it had happened but the man in his arms was Clarence,
Cas stared at them for a long time, finding only sincerity in Sam’s face and...well...a scowl in Dean’s but it didn’t seem to matter for the moment. Eventually, Cas sighed, “Okay. You can help.”
Michael scratched at the back of his neck, looking at his feet as though he were nervous, before he waved a hand non-committally at their surroundings. “So, the Temple backs onto these gardens. They’re pretty beautiful, not many people come by after sunset and I figure you wouldn’t have seen it yet. It’s...one of my favourite places actually.”
Certainly, Sam looked much better for a wash, however brief, and a change of clothes. He looked so different he felt the need to introduce himself anew to Castiel, reaching out to shake his hand as though they hadn’t already done so. Castiel didn’t shy away from the contact, frowning a little against the touch, trying to place what it was he could sense. Sam saw him frown and quickly dropped his hand again, pointing beyond the gate somewhere, showing where they needed to go, as Adam brought round the horses.
Castiel dropped down after Dean, taking a moment to reassure their ride in such bleak surroundings. He moved over to examine the stone, just about able to make out the faint carving of a sigil etched deep into it, but not deep enough that it couldn’t be blighted by the swipe of a particularly vicious demon claw.
. “I think this might be beyond saving, even for you. Balthazar has a buckle I can wear, but you’ll have to get a dress shirt out of my dunnage, I don’t think we ever unpacked them.”
“What? No, you really think we’d do that?” Sam looked so hurt, for the briefest of moments Dean regretted the accusation, but with Cas’ safety on the line, even his brothers were suspect. “You’re good, Dean, Cas, you’re safe,” Sam looked to Cas whose jaw seemed set in a grim line, seemingly as unconvinced as Dean was.
Dean took a sip of the coffee, licking his lips in a motion that Castiel certainly didn't track as close as his sight would allow. "Well, yeah, this is a fancy gig, gotta look my best," he added a wink for good measure and it was a miracle Castiel hadn't collapsed into a puddle on the floor.
“Look,” he unrolled one of the longer letters and held it next to a page where he’d apparently drawn columns indicating the strength of various armies. “The demons use their strongest forces against Heaven and their weakest for us. But what they lack in strength, they make up for in numbers. They’re so relentless they chip away at us gradually instead of Heaven which they’ve been trying to take in huge offences.”
Castiel hadn’t intended to wake him, not really. He leaned in and pressed gentle kisses along the line of Dean’s jaw, revelling in the way the stubble scratched his lips. Dean shifted a few times and he smiled before his eyes fluttered open.
“Wait.” Dean drew back. “How did we get here? My parents...the angels, don’t they want you anymore?”
They take a moment for Dean to adjust, for Castiel to get comfortable and then he’s thrusting into him, their moans mingling with the sound of flesh slapping. The buzzing of a phone cuts over it but this time it’s persistent.
The challenge was obvious, but Balthazar never got the chance to voice it, interrupted by a knock at the door and the Captain’s steward, little more than a boy, stepping in and addressing Castiel, nervous in the presence of so many senior officers, said, “Mister Benjamin sends his compliments and requests your presence on deck, sir, coming up on a merchant ship, sir,” he added.
He puts himself on his side, trying to fold his legs into the small space. That’s somehow even more uncomfortable. He rolls over, curling himself into the back of the couch but that isn’t even worth the attempt. Dean turns back with a small huff. He’ll find a way. He’ll-
“Really?” Dean snapped, “You seemed pretty happy to sign us up back there.”
“Michael!” he said in surprise, “you didn’t have to do that.”
But Michael didn’t flinch. He just stood a little taller, still holding Castiel even as he rejected him. “Yes,” he said, bluntly, though Castiel would have sworn his eyes looked wet. “I know it’s not what you want to hear, I wish I could just take you away, I wish...”
The church hadn’t exactly been overflowing with garments and Castiel grabbed the first ones he’d found. Of course, now Castiel could appreciate that it was as unusual for a lowly priest to be wandering around the city at this hour alone as if he’d kept his finery. The robes were white, heavy and beneath them, Castiel’s skin prickled with sweat even though the night was not exactly hot. They were also permanently infused with the sweet-smelling scent of incense which was doing wonders to mask his own scent which would have no doubt given him away as an anxious omega on the run.
Cas shouted something from his trap at her in her own language, not one Dean recognised. She replied in kind and got a sharp kick to the head for her trouble.
Sam looked like he might want to say something more, but Dean had heard it all before and even what hadn’t been said. Dean knew. So to save his brother the hassle of having to convey how sorry he was that Dean had drawn the short straw when he’d been born first, Dean stepped into his chambers and let the door snap shut behind him. He heard Benny shout something into the halls and a few moments later a bell rang out somewhere, announcing that for the next twelve hours the betrothed princes would observe solitary meditation in preparation for their wedding.
“This isn’t a debate, Cas,” Dean snapped right back at him, “There’s no way we’re letting you go out there on your own. We can help, you know we can.”
Michael’s eyes flickered to the palace behind them again and he chuckled, “What can I say? I’m all about making the best of things. C’mon, let me show you the fountain. You won’t regret it.”
Dean gave him one last peck before he drew back, looking more like a disgruntled child than the Crown Prince. “Fine, but you better believe we’re doing more than just kiss when we get there.”
Sam cradled Queenie’s head in his lap whispering reassurances to her though Dean couldn’t tell if she was coherent enough to know what he was saying or what was going on around her.
Dean gave a small shrug, “I talk to him.”
even though the thing had been spitting lightning just a minute ago.
“Blessed be the Norm, Benny,” Dean said smoothly, catching sight of their captain’s dishevelled head bent over a desk. “Blessed be the Norm, Cas,” he called over, but the guy only waved his hand tiredly, mumbling something that was probably the appropriate response and Dean couldn’t help but smile fondly. Even that might have been a familiarity too far, he was the guy Dean always had to be on guard around, no pun intended. A stickler for the rules, he looked like he’d never laughed a day in his life, in short the complete opposite of Dean. But he was also kind of adorable in the way he was overworked and seemed constantly tired as a result, which was why Dean could chuckle that he hadn’t even graced them with the proper response in full this morning when he usually insisted on it.
“Don’t be lewd, Dean,” he said, softly, “We really do have things to do.”
with full assistance and I need not remind you of the penalty of failing to engage the enemy. Your orders will follow, good day, sir.”
“He’s fine, Cas,” Dean mumbled, as his brother stalked off, “He’s tired.”
"Why do you need so much whipped cream?" Sam asked with his stupid little brother mouth that wouldn't shut up.
Sam was fine. Sam talked to all of them as easily as he ever had, as though Dean weren’t deliberately keeping his distance. At first, Castiel had tried to catch his eye, probably wanting to explain himself or something. It didn’t take long for him to catch onto the idea that Dean was not interested. Eventually, he just started conducting himself as quietly as possible, his shoulders a little hunched. He seemed smaller somehow, even though Dean knew that his true form would likely dwarf the forest.
to help you. You’re our family so let us help you. We’re not gonna lose you, okay?”
Dean’s heard of heart-shaped beds before, he’s even seen them on some really poorly-scripted porn films, but he’s never seen one in person. Until this moment he hadn’t realised this was something he was grateful for. The rest of the apartment is nice; all clean lines, white counters with black tops and then...a monstrosity of a bed (complete with heart shaped headboards, naturally) draped in so much red velvet Dean can’t help but wonder if Gabriel picked it up from a second-rate brothel. Or at least, the dumpster behind a second-rate brothel.
“Gabriel has convinced the angels to leave us be for now and...I didn’t stop to consider your parent's wishes.”
Dean’s throat went dry - drier than he could ever remember it being and he nodded, not trusting himself to speak. He knew this discussion was coming of course, how could it not have been? Cas might be his true mate, but he was still an angel of the freaking lord. He was still the most perfect being in all of creation and Dean had seen enough of it to consider that a reasonable statement of fact. There was no way he would want to be stuck with Dean Winchester, not beyond the physical demands of heat. Was this rejection? He couldn’t blame him, Cas had confessed his feelings but that was surely before Dean had messed it all up-
But ever a man of action there was only really one course Dean would be happy with.
There was that smile again, the one that was soft yet chilling. The one that showed her to be something other than human. “Now they will beg us to be wiped from the earth.”
"Whoah. Champagne, Dean?" Sam asked as they loaded the belt up with the groceries.
“And we know what a Mutant is?”
“Yeah but...our mother is an angel and she’s never done anything like this,” Sam said.
The table around which Sam and Dean Winchester sat eating the stew Dean had picked up from the stand outside the guard station, was small enough that when Sam started laughing unexpectedly, the mouthful of beef and whatever else he’d been chewing sprayed all over his brother. A beat too late Sam clapped his hand over his mouth. He might have been looking at Dean with something between embarrassment and apology but he was still laughing, though it quickly became a choking wheeze as he quickly tried to swallow what remained of the contents of his mouth.
“Is that...is that you?” he asked, his voice shaking a little as he inhaled deeply again. It was the first breath of a winter morning, all crisp, clear and fresh. A hint of pine that had nothing to do with the trees around them that complemented a winter frost. Dean looked at Clarence, aware that his eyes were starting to bleed into alpha red and he growled out a single word that seemed to reverberate around them.
Castiel quirked a smile, “I put some aside for you when it came in this morning.”
“Oh, hi Andrea, what...what can I do for you?”
With a final wipe of the cloth, Castiel Novak restored the glass to its gleaming state, having successfully removed all the smudges, grime and a couple of streaks he wasn’t sure he wanted to identify but had probably come from the hands of small children. Why people couldn’t just
“I’ve got some books on the subject, if you want to read up on it,” Sam offered, but Adam seemed to be thinking in new terms already.
“You just don’t want to move,” Castiel muttered, accusingly, but he couldn’t help but smile.
They stared at each other fondly for a moment before Adam cleared his throat, “So...should I leave you guys to it?”
“Cas-” Dean started but his voice sounded weirdly high even to his own ears so he cleared his throat and started again. “Cas...d’you wanna get a drink with me?”
But there would be time enough to explain it later. Right now all Castiel needed was to find the way back into Hell.
“Michael?” he breathed, barely aware that he was moving towards the man. Michael crossed the space between them, his stride long in the water as he closed the distance and buried his face in Castiel’s neck.
“Adam?” Dean had never heard his mother’s tone so icy before. It didn’t suit her, but then infidelity hadn’t suited his father.
When Sam had asked what Dean’s problem was, as though he’d needed to ask seeing as the guy was a
cannons. “Jo? Open fire when you’re ready!” They were clearly prepared to make the pirates work for their cargo, even if they didn't stand a chance.
...why have you gotten me flowers?”
Dean glared at Castiel as though he were one of the men mistreating the workers. “This is where Richard Roman grows his crops. This is where he mines for jewels. This is where he gets his good quality wood. The other beach is good for fishing, that’s where Roman gets the lobsters for his banquets. Back in the town is where the good stuff is made. You know, the real fancy furniture for your admiral’s house, the jewellery for his wife. Most of what Roman sells starts here. He came here, found that there was a whole island of good shit to be had, he didn’t have to pay for the setup and he doesn’t have to pay for the labour.”
come near to them before they lowered their colours, closed their gun ports and dropped their anchor.
Cas seemed amused and he drew back a little so that he could look Dean in the face. “I
Clarence followed the point of his finger and his eyes lit up at the sight of the stand. “Seriously?” Dean laughed, “you’ve never had a fritter before?”
From below deck, Jo’s shout rang out. “On the uproll!”
Sleep was a luxurious treat. Something Castiel partook of but didn’t need. Yet within a week of arriving at the front, Castiel was exhausted, his very being yearning for the softness of their bed and the rest that came with it. The first attack had come on the third night after their arrival and it had been relentless ever since.
“No, when he’s being gross, he’s your boyfriend.”
, able to appreciate for the first time how fine she looked in the water. He and Dean didn’t speak, there was nothing left to say even though Castiel found he had so many thoughts and feelings lurking just below the surface, if he’d opened his mouth to speak a word, they would have all tumbled out.
“From what I know of the story the magic only happened because they were true mates.”
began to follow them, no doubt cursing their gunners for having wasted an opportunity with their need to reload, Castiel turned back to Benny, “Avast! Garth!” he leaned over the deck, shouting across to the lithe man at the most forward part of the ship, “Now!”
work and its sequel for your reading pleasure:
It seemed almost inevitable when the rattle at the door came. Not from the trapdoor Dean and Cas had emerged from, but the actual door that led to the barracks beyond. Dean already knew that he didn’t want to fight whoever it was coming through the door. If they were human they’d be one of his own men, if they were angel then he was about to start something Sam might politely term
pulled up her anchor and set her sails for Kingston. As they passed, they fired a salute, probably the only time the Royal Navy had ever rendered honours to a pirate, before
Adam held him for a moment longer before stepping back, his eyes wandering to Cas naturally, even though he was clearly overjoyed to see Dean. “I’m sorry I couldn’t come to the taming,” he said, falling over his words in his haste to get them out, “I asked but-”
Dean wants to close the drawer, he really does. But it’s like watching a car crash he can’t look away from. The sex toys, lubricant, and condoms are not a surprise. What else would he have expected from a drawer in proximity to a heart-shaped bed? But the sheer variety in length, size, type,
“-and he says we can stay here for as long as we need. It looks like the rest of the country will follow suit so it’s not like he’s going to surprise us by showing up.”
“We know,” Sam said, “That’s why we’ve been looking for you. Adam figured you wouldn’t have actually gone anywhere. He said he’d been showing you all his hiding places, Cas, but!” he added, hastily when he saw Dean shift a little, “he only told me. We want to help.”
“Are you insane? I’m a Captain in the Royal Navy, not a madman, I can’t just go up to the man and murder him, they’d hang me. I’m going to goad him into provoking me and kill him in a duel.”
He smiles softly at Cas and this time when he kisses him it is something sweet. Tender.
“I...I don’t have to,” Cas said, gesturing across the scorched field where even at a distance Dean could make out a faint glow and another and another, several springing up around the distant fortifications.
“Your mother is with him,” his father tried to assure him. “It’s fine, Dean. I know it’s hard,” he said with the long-suffering tone of a man who’d seen it through himself.
“Could you give me a hand, Dean?” he asks eventually.
For both their sakes.
“Hey, Dean? It’s okay. You know that right?” Dean frowned, not entirely sure what he was getting at. Sam sighed. “I mean...it’s fine. Dad was wrong and if Cas makes you happy...well...there’s nothing wrong with who you are is what I mean.”
Dean mouthed over Castiel’s scent gland, searching for the spot that he would mark later. He couldn’t have said whether it was he who lifted Castiel up or whether Castiel used his position against the door to his advantage, but either way, Castiel’s legs were wrapped around Dean’s waist and thank the Gods Dean could call on his alpha strength to carry him because the feel of his mate so close was enough to make him weak at the knees.
There were two men in the hallway, the guard who had delivered Prince Dean’s letter and another man, a much taller man, who was dressed in robes almost as fine as Castiel’s. Neither of them had seen him leave his chambers and their heads were bowed in hushed conversation. The taller man ran his hand through wavy hair that flopped down immediately into his eyes despite the motion.
"Oh… Yes," Cas sighed but Dean could tell there was something more. Cas' hand reached for his and squeezed tight. "Sorry. I was just thinking about how many times we've died."
“Yeah but...” he takes a breath. This is veering dangerously close to talking about their feelings. At least when those feelings were bottled up where they belonged there was no chance of Cas walking away because of them. “If we do this then we...I-” He wants to say that they can’t go back. That if they do this Dean will never be able to look at Cas again without remembering this night. He’d never be able to listen to him speak without knowing the noises that he made or watch him trying to tame his hair knowing how it felt to tug it and how hard he liked it to be tugged. “It’ll change things,” is what Dean settles on.
In an ideal world, Dean might have reassured his husband that there was nothing to worry about but…there really was. Neither of them were under any illusions that a hunt could be Dean's last. They hadn't ever discussed it but then… They'd never had to.
“They’re low in the water,” Castiel noted, taking in the size of the ship and how it seemed to be struggling to turn.
. They’d come up with this whole plan about how they were going to get Cas away from you and- did you really punch father when they tried to send you here without him?” Sam asked, suddenly, clearly unsure as to whether he should believe that particular story. Dean flushed a little, but beside him, Cas looked thrilled and Sam’s face split into a grin. “Awesome. Anyway, you’d been gone a while so mother went to fetch you both. Obviously, you weren’t there and it didn’t take them long to figure out
sleep, but it was hardly a practice he had engaged in often, something he had never done at all in fact, before Dean had tamed him. If his body had desperately required, he’d always opted for
“Then Ishim and his lot jumped in and it just sort of snowballed from there.”
Dean’s lips part and Castiel swipes them with his tongue. He should probably have brushed his teeth first, but there’s no way he’s getting out of this bed. From the way Dean inches closer to him, it’s clear he isn’t going to either.
He nipped at Dean’s lip and Dean fell back against the wall behind him, holding Castiel at an arm’s length while he got his breath back.
They walked far longer than was sensible, especially given that they had no heading and had just picked a direction. Anything could have been waiting for them. At one point they passed within earshot of what sounded like a werewolf, but it had obviously scented the air and realised it probably wouldn’t win a four on one fight, so it rustled off into the woods. They finally came across a place to rest, even though Dean had no idea what a ‘Drive-In Theatre’ could possibly have been.
Castiel definitely did not flush at something as minor as a smile and definitely did not reach into one of the refrigerators for the slice of pie he’d stashed there earlier, ensuring that nobody else could see it and therefore order it before this moment.
They kiss for a while longer before Cas shifts so that he’s out of Dean’s lap and back on the monstrosity of Gabriel’s bed. Dean finds that he hates it a little less this morning.
Benny didn't say anything more but Castiel could tell from the silence that he wasn't convinced. When Dean pushed the door open, Castiel closed his eyes, as though he hadn’t been disturbed by the exchange. Not that Dean had any intention of questioning him one way or the other. Castiel felt his coat land heavily on the cot as Dean threw it at him.
From the outside, Bobby’s shack hadn’t looked particularly impressive. The inside wasn’t much better. But then Dean had moved the bed from its place against a wall, and pulled away a rug that had apparently been concealing a trap door. The underside of Bobby’s house was far more impressive. The door led to a ramshackle basement, but that itself was a front for the storeroom Bobby had somehow built into the mountainside behind the shack. Someone who didn’t know it was there would never have found it, and in hindsight, Castiel didn’t blame Bobby the stern glances he kept casting towards him. Dean showing him all of this was a huge mark of trust, one that Castiel wasn’t entirely sure he had warranted.
He held his hand out and Cas took it, falling into step beside him, though his eyes were wandering over the fortifications appraisingly and Dean nudged him to break him out of the trance. “Hey, there’s time enough for that. You heard the kid, we need to rest.”
“I don’t require anything.”
“I agree,” Dean smirked, pulling him back in for another kiss.
“That’s the last of the chickens,” she told Dean, handing him his own plate, “We’ll need some supplies soon.”
“No, I mean- I expected him to be annoyed, but this is something else. I’ve not seen him this withdrawn since Dad died.”
Cas had paused, somewhere by Dean’s knee, frowning. “You have a cut here,” he said, softly, running his hand over it, allowing it to heal even as he pointed it out. “It’s gone now.”
Dean looked up at him, his green eyes gleaming in the dim light of the fire as his hand moved towards Castiel’s abdomen, where their baby was growing inside.
Dean didn’t seem particularly bothered, “Tomorrow, Ellen,” he assured her, “We have an appointment,” he added, cryptically but it was clear that only Castiel didn’t know to what he was referring. He thanked her for their food and led Castiel out of the mess back on deck where they made themselves comfortable beside a cannon, watching the sunset over the sea.
“We’re having a baby,” Cas repeated, a little breathlessly.
In fact, Adam seemed entirely nonplussed at the outburst. “Getting all the demons
It was dark, or at least as dark as it could get on a clear night. The moon was mockingly bright, reflecting off the surface of the ocean and illuminating the cabin through the wide windows. For some reason, Castiel had gotten it into his head that if there was darkness he could hide from his own thoughts. But no matter how much he screwed his eyes tight shut against reality, there was no escape.
“We both know I do,” Castiel said, moving closer even though Dean had not turned to him at all. “I am sorry, Dean. I didn’t mean to snap and I know you’re only worried about me, even though there isn’t anything to be worried about.”
“I dunno, but he’s got no business here,” Bobby had shrugged.
For the longest time, they just smiled at each other. Dean was reminded of all the poetry he’d ever been forced to read where wordsmiths had blown sentiments all out of proportion. At the time Dean had wondered why they had bothered with such ridiculous expressions, now they didn’t seem to be enough. Nothing would ever be enough to describe how utterly perfect the man in his arms was.
Eventually, they had recovered enough of their strength to move off the beach onto the porch of Bobby’s shack. There was room enough inside for them, but it had been so peaceful, they had been content to watch the moon’s reflection cross the water and look up at the unobstructed starry sky. Dean had found them a blanket to pass the night under and they’d sat beside each other, occasionally exchanging leisurely kisses when they could find the energy to do so. Certainly, they were too exhausted to do anything else.
There was light. Blinding, pure white light that bled through his closed eyes and then…
“Alright, Cas,” Dean sighed, scrubbing a hand over his face, his mind already turning to the sheer amount of things he would have to do if Sam was out of commission. It was a decent distraction from worrying about his brother and why his mate was so obviously trying to keep him in the dark over something. “Alright,” he said again. “I’ll...I’ll see you soon.”
Of all the idiotic, ridiculous-
Dean’s parents came by every day though it might simply have been a human concern for their son. Castiel wasn’t prepared to risk it and Dean didn’t seem to be in any particular rush to see his parents. He was still upset that they had been so eager to turn over Castiel and the baby to the angels. Their own grandchild.
“Your boyfriend is being gross,” Sam muttered.
had stopped firing, but they’d obviously caught a powder keg and half of
“Cas, I’d love to go on a date with you,”
“You don’t say?”
He would never tire of that.
Dean had been grossly misinformed as to the ferocity of archangels.
So maybe Dean doesn’t hate him. If he does, he has a very strange way of showing it. When this is over, he’s going to ask Dean if he’d like to go for a drink and not just because they’ve hardly touched the stuff while they’ve been working. He’s going to ask Dean out for a drink and maybe, Dean will say yes.
“How kind,” Castiel grumbled, unable to quite sound as annoyed as he should at his oldest friend who had once held his hair back when Castiel had still been in short trousers and gotten sick on his first time in a row-boat. Balthazar just shot him a winning smile and held the door, giving an exaggerated bow as his Captain stepped past him.
“I know,” Sam mumbled. He rocked forward so that his head rested in his palms. He looked like he wanted to hide, even though Castiel could see him plainly. It must have helped for at last he started talking.
“They can’t change tack,” whoever had been keeping a lookout laughed, but it was shortlived. They might not have been able to keep up with
The offer brought a startling clarity to Castiel. The answer should have been an obvious ‘I’d love to but I can’t.’ It was a ludicrous offer, an impossible dream whispered in the throes of lovemaking that could never be fulfilled. Castiel had a life that could never be squared with that of a pirate. What would he do, resign his commission and spend his days beside Dean, raiding the ships of a dishonest merchant? It was ridiculous.
Castiel reached up and covered Dean’s hand with his own, holding it there, firmly. “Dean, I am never leaving your side again.”
“Cas, hey, mechanical engineer remember? Not an astrophysicist. Layman’s terms, okay?”
The fading sunlight did nothing to hide Dean’s blush. “What? Well, I just meant...You know he probably would have killed you, right?”
,” she said, meaningfully, but Dean flushed red and waved her off.
, yet she was doing her hardest to avoid the inevitable confrontation.
“Ah yes, I’m sure you had an excellent view from languishing in their cells.”
“From the Queen. Something about a gesture showing the joining of two kingdoms.” Clarence looked over at Dean thoughtfully and Dean covered with an awkward cough, “I mean, that’s what I heard anyway. Your homeland is all about ice, right?”
“Just being here is enough,” Dean murmured, crowding Cas into the wall behind them. He caught the smirk on Cas’ lips just before he tilted Cas’ chin up so he could devour it. Cas’ hands dropped to Dean’s hips, his lips parting in an invitation Dean was only happy to accept.
Castiel didn’t respond.
“But, I still want to help.”
“They were-”
“If you think you can get ready in time,” Dean added, laughing aloud when Adam practically fell over his feet trying to leave so he could prepare himself.
“I thought of you,” Cas gasps out, bucking his hips as though he already has Dean’s cock. “It’s always you.”
As he gently works one finger in, Dean’s fingers claw into the bedcovers, his groan muffled by the pillow he drops his face into.
Wreathed in lightning and spitting rain. How the hell did you stab a cloud?
The mischief in Cas’ eyes vanishes and he looks as though Dean has mortally wounded him. “
“I love you,” Cas sighed, burying his face in the crook of Dean’s neck.
Dean was in love.
to you...that you let me share in your love in such a way is more than I ever dreamed possible.”
“Your prospects didn’t play a part in our mating,” Castiel said, dryly, “In fact, if you’ll recall I had little choice in the matter.” Dean’s attempt at a smile faltered, at least until Castiel raised Dean’s hand to his lips to kiss. “I could never have chosen such a perfect mate.”
Castiel was still staring at the point of the horizon where the island had been, even though it had long since disappeared from view when he realised that Dean was beside him, and from the way his eyes were dancing, he’d obviously been there for some time.
He wasn’t sure which of his brothers protested first, their shouts seemed to overlap with each other before Adam paused to let Sam speak.
Frowning, Dean thought for a moment. “He’s okay...I think. There’ve been a lot of changes, he’s still getting used to some of them.”
There were two plates and a candle between them. Ordinarily, it wouldn't be anything special, but Castiel could see the effort that Dean had gone to to make it look nice. He covered Dean’s hand with his own, “It’s fine. You don’t have to impress me.”
Sitting up, he rubbed his face. This sucked, and he couldn’t see it sucking any less in the immediate future. His eyes fell on a package he hadn’t noticed in his haste to act like a disgruntled child. It was plain, unassuming and left on his bed among cushions and pillows that might have disguised it. It was only now Dean was looking right at it that he could see it and he frowned. This might have been what Benny had been talking about, something to pass the time. He unwrapped it and stared at the contents in disbelief. Clothes. Plainclothes, plain boots and a small pouch of money. Just the sort of thing a prince wouldn’t wear. The sort of thing nobody would expect a prince to wear. Dean turned the fabric over in his hand. If a prince wore this he’d become faceless, nameless. The fragrant salve wrapped in the cloth would mask his scent.
He held a finger in front of Dean’s eyes, only for Dean to push it away harshly after just the smallest of movements. “You’re moving it too fast! The ship-”
Dean was heading back to him so Castiel simply stepped away from Gabriel. “Well...I’m sure the two of you will have fun.”
Her matter of fact tone was completely at odds with the way Dean practically recoiled, blushing furiously. “Oh...we haven’t-” he caught Cas’ eye and looked away, quickly. Rowena and Sam needed to leave. They needed to leave now.
“My brother resorted to drinking demon blood because I wasn’t here to help, because I-”
“What? It’s not like we’re gonna drive the thing. It might just be a decent place to stay tonight.”
“May all here bear witness and pledge their fealty to King Dean and Prince Cas-”
“This used to be a forest,” Dean said, quietly. Castiel looked over the field with him, noting the clear gouges in the ground where trees had been uprooted, no doubt to assist in the war effort. “I remember my father bringing Sam and me here when we were younger. The front was a long way away back then, our Uncle Bobby lived just over there,” he gestured over to a small hill that looked like it couldn’t have supported life for a long time. He sighed and gave Castiel a weak smile. “Sorry, it’s not all pretty palaces and flower gardens. Every year we fall back a little more and lose more ground...bet you wish you’d mated someone with better prospects, huh?”
But the smile Cas turned on him was blinding. “Of course...” he turned to the Captain of the Guard, “If you’ll report to Commander Adam, who is probably in the barracks, he will show you the arrangements for billeting your men.”
Dean frowned, “Cas’ heat wasn’t due until-” he stopped, dead, as the calculations came to him. He looked down at Cas who was staring up at him in, frozen in shock.
“As you all know, my business has been dramatically affected by the operations of pirates, in the area-”
He isn’t going to stop.
Dean scoffed even though it was only him and his reflection. What the hell was Cas even doing saying yes the way he had? Cas was…
"Oh, gross, guys, seriously?!"
Adam’s smile was infectious, he looked as though Castiel had offered him the keys to the gates of Heaven, “Really? He doesn't want to check-”
out. We’re going to go in and eat hot dogs and candy floss because it kinda goes with the territory. We’re gonna ride some rollercoasters and look ridiculous in the photos they take and we’re gonna buy them even though they’re always overpriced. We’ll ride the log flume and get soaked but we won’t care because it’ll be fun. We’ll head for the stalls and I’ll pretend that I’ve never shot a gun in my life before while I figure out which way it’s rigged so I can win you the most ridiculous stuffed toy you’ve ever seen. Then we’re going to head back to the motel and the toy’s gonna be too big to hold in the bed and you’ll insist on giving it a dumb name but I won’t care because you’ll be happy. Then we’ll have to turn it to face the wall when you start showing me your appreciation for such a great night ‘coz you won’t want to scar it and it’ll be weird to do stuff with it watching.”
"You leaving us, Cas?" Dean asked, unable to keep his voice from sounding as low as it did. It wasn't a new story, but he'd thought they were past this tendency of Cas’ to disappear without notice and for weeks at a time. He tried to focus on Cas’ face so he didn’t have to focus on the way his stomach felt as though he’d just been drop kicked.
“It’s all quite different in Heaven,” he continued as though he were musing on nothing more consequential than the weather. “When angels did such things, the emphasis was always on the bond between a mated pair more than physical release, even when a bond was formed for breeding purposes. I suppose if I am to experience a heat in this form it would make sense to be prepared for the sexual elements that come with it.”
Cas looked like he might want to say it back but it was lost as his breath picked up. His hand tightened around Dean’s and Dean didn’t even care that he could feel his bones breaking. Cas screamed and then fell silent again, trying to catch his breath.
On the third day, Castiel was
Someone was trying to pull Dean off and it must have been Cas for his scent surrounded him but it was alarmed, worried and Dean’s alpha reacted accordingly to the presence of another alpha and his mate’s distress. There was another shout, a bang and then Dean found himself inexplicably at the end of the hallway, crumpled in a heap.
“See?” Dean said, happily, spreading his arms out. “Even Cas agrees.”
Sam had managed to get Queenie onto her feet, though she struggled to stay there, one arm flung around Sam’s shoulder as she gripped him to stop herself from falling again. Cas’ hand found Dean’s, entwining their fingers though he shot Dean a look to make sure he wasn’t overstepping. Dean had never wanted to kiss him so badly in his life and there had been plenty of times Dean had wanted to kiss him.
Still beyond words Dean manages to nod, unable to fathom why Cas should look like all his birthdays, Christmasses, and wet dreams have come at once. Cas leans in to kiss him and Dean uses the distraction to reach blindly over to the drawer that had scarred him for life but he knows there’s lube in there. There must be, surely. He feels his way to a bottle and pulls it out, bringing it to his eyes and he recognises the font and the shape; it’s lube. It’ll do.
usual for them, Castiel had realised there and then that he never wanted to wake up without Dean’s arms around him if he could help it. It was hardly the first time Castiel had entertained the idea that his feelings for his best friend weren’t strictly platonic, but it was the first time he’d decided that he simply could not go on without doing something about it.
Of course what actually blurted out of his mouth was a rather less impressive, “I’d like to go on a date with you.”
It wasn’t like the market to stay open so late and Dean couldn’t figure out what was happening until they passed a particularly busy stall laden with crockery. Clarence paused, bemused, and picked up an earthenware bowl, looking at the painted image. “The wedding of Dean Winchester and Castiel Novak,” Clarence read with a frown. Dean felt his blood freeze until Clarence turned the bowl towards him and he saw that the likeness of himself was so poor it barely looked human let alone like
It wasn’t exactly the best time to be planning a trip.
asleep when barely muffled voices woke him. For a moment, he couldn’t figure out how it was that he could hear voices so clearly, but then he realised that Dean had started coming into the cabin, his hand still on the door handle before he’d been called back.
“They saved my life,” Castiel offered, receiving gratified looks from both Sam and Dean.
Dean drew back, allowing only the smallest of spaces between them. He didn't want to bathe, he wanted to strip his mate and make love to him on the same bed they'd made love just a few hours earlier. But, they really were filthy and not in a good way. “Yeah, you’re right. Together?”
Castiel was on the verge of a retort, though he never got the chance to say it. Dean stepped between the two, facing Crowley as though shielding Castiel from him.
. Not really. Not enough to ignore Meg completely, but then Dean couldn’t grudge him that. It was a lonely life at the best of times and Meg seemed to be way more astute than any of the other ‘friends’ Sam had met in his mind. He could only imagine that that had been Clarence’s doing. The others hadn’t had anyone else, or at least, no one that they talked about. No one to tell them to keep it to themselves at all costs.
Almost instinctively, he looked over at the other cot, hardly surprised when he saw that it was empty. He really did want to know how Dean was able to keep time. He caught himself smiling and tried to force it away. He was a prisoner of the pirates he had been sent to apprehend, he was
“I’ll go and tell your father,” Dean’s mother said to him, kissing him softly on the cheek and giving them a moment alone. Dean’s mind was racing. There was so much to do...or at least...he thought there was so much to do. They had to summon a healer, an angelic one who would know what Cas needed, they would need to alert the Host, they kept tabs on every angelic/human hybrid born either in Heaven or on Earth. Then there were the Principalities, or was it the Cherubim? One of them would have to be notified, they’d have to come down and see if Cas was carrying a nephilim. He wouldn’t be of course, nephilim hadn’t been born for centuries, but didn’t they have to be checked anyway. Tradition or something? Dean had a vague memory of someone arriving when his mother was pregnant with Sam. Had that been a Principality? A Cherubim? He couldn’t remember…
Castiel pushed himself up, resting his head against his hand so he could look at Dean. “But I might. After the war, I could-”
It took them a little while to actually get out the doors which Castiel would insist was entirely Dean’s fault. It had been months, months since Castiel had seen his husband in his princely clothes. Or any clothes that were clean for that matter. Before they left Dean bathed in rosewater, he shaved and he dressed in what could be considered his most casual doublet and hose but compared to the torn and ruined clothes he’d been wearing since they left the palace seemingly an age ago he looked...delicious.
“Yeah and that’s all you saw. No offence, but did you not think you were getting off a little light? I know we’re pirates but we’re not
Castiel was sure he’d stopped breathing, but his heart seemed to be pounding harder than ever in his chest. “Dean, I-” he broke off, there was nothing he could say that he had not already said. Nothing he could do that he had not already done, so he did not try. Instead, he swallowed down the lump in his throat, held out his hand and said, levelly, “I hope I see you again.”
“Yeah, no need to lock me up when they already know I can’t go anywhere, right?” Dean spat out, bitterly and Sam flinched from the tone. That made him feel a little guilty, it wasn’t Sam’s fault. None of this was Sam’s fault, he was just trying to make him feel better. “I’m sorry, Sam,” he whispered, appreciating for the first time how his scent, usually just the right side of smokey was instead acrid and burnt, yet his brother hadn’t left his side.
There were steps that led up to a porch that Cas would decorate with windchimes. Dean would complain about them but secretly he’d find their soft, melodic clinks comforting.
“Samuel?” Rowena trilled, again and Sam rolled his shoulders.
“You come back soon, you can show us how it’s done any time,” Benny said, slapping him on his shoulder as Ellen handed him a satchel of food she’d prepared for him.
“I bet they all knew your name.”
There was a knock at the door and Dean frowned. Cas had said he needed to get something but he had a key. Dean took a last look in the mirror. Well. He wasn’t going to get any prettier.
Castiel shifted a little, still supported mostly by Meg. “There are wardings you can draw that repel demons, I...I could show you how to?” he offered.
Dean managed to look up. His mother was beaming at him, her eyes shining with unshed tears. Then there was a bundle in his arms and Dean was looking upon a miniature version of Castiel.
Dean’s head was spinning. Cas had been wrong. Everything about this was wrong.
“I don’t know about that. Didn’t you say your family had you taking over for them?”
Castiel leans in to kiss him. It’s easily done. He barely has to move. And to think, he had reservations about sharing a bed with Dean Winchester. What a fool he was. Dean’s lips are soft and gentle, a contrast with the way his stubble is coarse against Castiel’s. Neither of them mind.
“He should have come with us!”
“What’s this? Which captain?”
“I missed you,” he breathed, kissing Dean as though Dean were the air he needed to live. “I missed you so much.”
Dean breathed. Was he dead? He must be dead.
Cas didn’t look in the least bit surprised. “I’d remind you he was your brother before he was my boyfriend.”
Still, Dean had talked a lot about Sam.
The other ship’s cannons exploded, and Dean closed his eyes, waiting for the blow to land.
“The hell can track an angel?”
“That’s not the point, dumbass.”
“No, Sam, Castiel is my mate. My
Castiel joined in the smattering of applause, though he ensured it was slightly lukewarm.
Crowley regarded him over steepled fingers. “Well, I suppose I don’t need to worry about you saying something that might things awkward for me. I’m intrigued how such a choir boy could piss off the boss.”
then Dean would have made a move years ago and accepted the rebuff.
Cas frowns without looking up. “Is there any other kind of pizza?”
Of course, the obvious answer would be to split up. To go back to their original plan where they found a place in their pairs. They’d managed quite well before they’d ended up together. But...Dean didn’t want to leave them. He’d worry for a start. He’d spend the rest of his life wondering what they were up to if they were okay. And he liked them, even Meg who managed to get on his every nerve sometimes but was generally alright to be around.
Dean lets out a long breath and sinks back into his chair. “That’s him?”
The man in question, Michael, is sitting on the couch watching television. The camera in that room is set behind him so they can only see the back of his dark hair but it’s closer than they’ve ever gotten before.
He reaches for the bottle of lube on the nightstand. He’d made fun of Dean for bringing it. He’d said it showed how little care he had for the job.
Dean pulls back a little, just a little so he can look at Cas though the sight of him with lips full and flush from sucking Dean off is almost as much as he can take. He wants to ask if he’s sure but the part of his brain that forms words went offline when Cas said that he loved him.
“When was the last time you ate?” Castiel asked, casting around in his mind, but he couldn’t recall Sam sitting with Dean to dine. “Or slept?”
“No, but he feels like he shouldn’t rest when there’s something to do and,” Adam waved his hand around in a gesture several years older than himself, “there’s always something that needs doing here.”
crippled in the first place. Would you mind telling me what’s going on?”
So Cas did, repeating the words and the intonations in an exact replica of what he'd just said. There was silence so absolute sound itself might have ceased to exist. Sam and Dean exchanged a look, and after several moments of confusion as the angel's words settled into their minds, Dean turned to him and said, "Cas, buddy, that doesn't sound like nothing."
He watched Cas go, noting the slight sway to his steps and filed it away to talk about later. “So?” he asked Sam, pointedly.
Weirdly, Sam seemed utterly unfazed, even though he was as surprised as Dean to learn the truth of Castiel’s existence. Dean had wanted to put as much distance between them and Meg as possible but Sam had put his foot down.
“Because
?” he asked, again.
“We just ended the war, Dean. We have sealed the gates of Hell and hopefully with it secured our future with our baby. Believe me when I say inconveniencing your mother’s feelings is not something I’m particularly afraid of.”
He warms the lube in his hand as much as his patience can bear and then he moves in to cover Cas’ back with kisses as he allows his first finger to wander, teasing Cas’ rim, testing the waters. But Cas pushes back and practically swallows the finger with such ease, Dean can tell he’s done this before. Well- obviously he’s done this before but he’s done this
Castiel closes both of the laptops and slides one of the spare phones over to Dean.
“...We’ll take what we can get,” Dean sighed. “Alright, thanks.” Even though he couldn’t see his brother he recognised the loaded silence and knew that if he’d been there Sam would be avoiding his eye. “What?”
“The others are recovering from the skirmish that killed four of them in the early hours of this morning,” Cas ground out, his voice almost brittle. Dean had never seen him like this, it was...concerning to say the least.
Castiel stared at the man before him, unmoving, the only part of him that seemed capable of movement were his lungs which inhaled the new scent on the air deeply, taking it into every pore of his being. His inner omega, a being that had not had cause to rear its head for so, so long was positively preening, jumping into life at that first breath of woodsmoke and beneath it a faint hint of cloves.
“Anyway, I came to tell you your new suite is ready and mom says you’re allowed to tour it whenever you’re ready.” Sam patted them both on their shoulders and disappeared to talk to some noble or other, leaving Dean and Castiel to carry on making eyes at each other.
Balthazar drew back without a hint of shame or embarrassment and checked over every inch of his captain. “Look at the state of you, Cassie,” he huffed in disapproval. Castiel didn’t even reprimand him for the nickname he despised. “Come on, Alfie will be so glad you’re alright. We thought you were dead, you know?”
“Send your letter, Cas.”
Dean grabbed his glass and saw that the captain’s gig was being launched, complete with its crew of liveried rowers. His eyes were drawn to the man in the uniform, a smart coat and hat, but...there was something wrong with the picture. It didn’t look like Cas. He tried to level his breathing, aware that his heart was thundering so hard in his ears, the crew might mistake it for another call to action.
The sound of laughter distracted them from their less than furtive looks at each other, as Charlie emerged from below deck, hand in hand with yet another woman. The two of them had obviously made short work of their dinner and were now engaged in some kind of game where they tried to get away from each other even as they refused to let the other’s hand go. Charlie reached out with her free arm to pull them both towards the rigging, only to lose her balance and stumble into the other woman’s arms. Castiel swore he heard the thud of his jaw hitting the deck when the two of them laughed it off and shared a kiss before they righted themselves.
“Blessed be the Norm, brother,” Benny greeted Dean, almost pointedly, as Dean clocked in for his shift. Dean arched an eyebrow, already completely done with the Norm for the day. He was about to make some wry comment about his choice of greeting when his fellow security guard caught his eye and gestured, discreetly, to the back of the office.
Dean was looking at a full-length picture of a man holding a guitar when a scuffle broke out behind him as Sam and Meg pushed each other aside, racing each other for the bed. Cas and Dean both shared a smirk, even more so when they realised there were two beds.
. “Just...leave me alone, Cas, I’m fine.”
The Queen did nothing in haste. She sat on the side of the bed and lay the back of her hand against Cas’ forehead, as though looking to confirm something.
“A misfire, I assure you, gentlemen, but the result would have been the same. Is he dead?”
Cas was everything.
Queenie struggled to pull herself up and just about managed it. She took the djinn’s hand in hers and started muttering under her breath.
.” Unsurprisingly Sam turned in unison as Dean did. “Thank you,” he said, quietly, “but I’ll be alright.”
It didn’t, but he didn’t care.
At that Dean could only blush harder. Cas looked so worried, his touch was so tender. He had been the prisoner for the djinn for days and his only concern was that Dean was a little red in the face.
“Dean!” Sam shouted, yanking him from the positively sinful sight before him and reminding him that they were actually here to do a job.
Sam was outside as Rowena had said he would be. As soon as he saw Dean he threw his hands up, “Sorry, man, I didn’t think, I should have-”
“There’s nothing about this in the lore so I’m not sure how much help we’ll find in the library,” Sam muttered, more to himself than anyone else. He turned to look at Cas, “So when an angel takes a vessel they suppress their secondary gender, which is why you have no scent and can’t scent anyone else...” Even though Sam was talking directly to Cas, it was clear that he was trying to make sense of it himself. He didn’t need an answer, not that Cas looked like he was going to give him one. “But you think that they can force you to...I dunno...
He could do this.
Castiel recognised the door he wanted, gesturing for Dean to follow him. They stepped down into what was ostensibly a wine cellar but in actual fact was being used as storage for every kind of food except wine. Wine was a luxury hard gotten in these parts, but there were still some empty casks tucked in the corner and it was to those casks that Castiel took them.
“Can we not just go home already, I feel like I haven’t kissed you for months.”
He opened the door expecting to see the motel owner or the maintenance guy. Not Cas. Not Cas holding out a bouquet of flowers and beaming at him as though Dean were the sun breaking through the clouds on the first day when man did not know if it would rise again.
Benny flushed and looked away while Dean laughed, a little too loudly, a little too giddy. “I like him.”
“Why didn’t they call us? They,
“You’re talking about slavery.” Castiel’s voice sounded dull even to himself.
With impressive speed, the smallest sail the ship had to offer was run up and Castiel waited until it was secure before he called back to the wheel, “Hard to port!”
” Instinctively, Dean turned at the sound of his name, relief flooding through him when he saw Cas crossing the courtyard towards him. Cas had been in no danger, still, there was something undeniably reassuring about knowing he was safe. After the things Dean had seen, the stench and blood that came with a battle, seeing Cas was like a breath of fresh air. He’d let Sam go and melted into Cas’ arms before he’d even made the conscious decision to do so. Sam let him go and Cas held him, holding him close, refusing to let go. He needed this as much as Dean did.
Dean might have been discouraged but Gabriel didn’t seem to be saying anything that he didn’t believe to be true. There was no malice in his voice, he was simply telling them how things were. Maybe that’s why, instead of letting Cas do the talking, Dean blurted out, “We’re going into Hell and we’re gonna take all the demons with us. We’re ending this war and then you and yours can leave our baby alone.”
“’Course,” Dean mumbled then with far more resolution than he expected he grabbed a couple that came with flashy if not descriptive stickers.
He found a guard easily enough, though Sam had done a good job of isolating his chambers from the rest of the palace’s workings. The man stood to attention as Castiel approached, more as a reaction to the natural authority he exuded than because he’d been invested with any specific powers.
Cas winces, “I don’t think I’d want to know what Gabriel does in...that thing.”
For the longest time, they stood there with Dean just breathing Cas in. He smelled like the first breath after a thunderstorm, clean, clear, a far cry from sulphur, fire and the dead. Eventually, Cas leaned back, giving Dean a thorough once over with his eyes alone to make sure there was actually nothing wrong, no injury that he was somehow concealing. Dean couldn’t help but smile at him, softly, amused even as he tried to be reassuring. When Cas was satisfied and not a moment before he looked at Sam, reaching out to him to check him too. Dean couldn’t fail to miss the way Sam drew away or the way Cas frowned, but then they’d just come back from a battlefield, Sam probably didn’t want to be pawed at by his angelic brother-in-law.
Queenie had said...she’d said that Cas loved him. That he had only ever been interested in her because she had something that Dean wanted. And now, with his “wife” lying on the floor, struggling to push herself up, it was to Dean Cas went. Breezing past her as though she wasn’t there.
Cas was waiting for something. Dean had never seen him fight before, not like this at any rate, but he could sense that he had
“Castiel!” Balthazar snapped, “You wrote a report calling Roman a slave driver and worse and now you have an invitation to his banquet where he will relaunch his ship. A ship which
Castiel allowed himself to breathe a sigh of relief. His hand covered his bump and Dean’s hand covered that. They rested their heads against each other and smiled.
“He’s not worth it,” Meg snapped, glaring at Dean when he realised she was talking about him. “What? You treat him like shit for days and he’s still supposed to die for you?!”
“Twins?” Dean heard himself whisper. He never wanted to look away, taking in every detail of their tiny faces. Their fingers clasped around the swaddling cloth. The girl met Dean’s gaze head-on while the boy slept peacefully. “Cas, we have twins.” He looked up at his mate but the image was blurred. He managed to wipe his eyes on his arm without jostling the children.
Dean looked over at him, but whatever would be said between them was interrupted from a hail above them.
“We’ll meet you here?” Sam asked hurriedly, gesturing to the card and deliberately talking over Dean.
“Come about!” Castiel shouted, dropping his hand and feeling
They parked up and Dean even ran around to open the door for Cas before he could get out himself.
With a quick brush of his hands, Dean tidied them up but from the way he smirked when his eyes met Castiel’s, Castiel knew that they looked guilty. A fact that was confirmed when Sam finally found them and came to an immediate stop.
“Anyway, you guys should see this,” Sam called, gesturing for them to follow. He hesitated as they stepped forward, surveying them with narrowed eyes for a moment. “Okay...you’re lucky you don’t need to change.”
If Cas’ smile grew any brighter Dean would surely go blind.
cinnamon which had apparently caused the palace cook no end of confusion. And he was sleeping. Not just because he could or because he liked to, he found himself taking naps in the middle of the day, something he could only appreciate when Dean shook him awake, looking down at him with undisguised worry.
“For now,” Dean said, raising his eyebrow suggestively.
Dean felt relief spread through every inch of him. This was more than he could ever have dreamed of but still, Cas didn’t seem happy. This was everything that they wanted and more; the war was over, they were home, the baby was safe...why couldn’t Cas even look at him.
In the mess everyone was falling over themselves, in some cases literally, to congratulate Castiel on his excellent seamanship. He waved them off, but he couldn’t help but grin under their open affection. Someone mussed his hair, another braced his arm across his shoulder and gave him an exaggerated kiss on the cheek. The most he’d ever received by way of thanks in the Navy was the one time Balthazar had said, ‘bloody good show’ when they’d successfully negotiated a hurricane and the note of commendation from the admiralty for the “satisfactory and successful discharge of his duty” catching pirates in the Mediterranean. Jo had all but jumped on him, even though it had been one of her gun crews that had pummelled Leviathan into submission. Ellen had already laid out two bowls for Castiel to take back to Dean’s cabin, but before she passed them over to him, she leaned over and tapped his face, affectionately. “You did good,” she said, smiling at him the way a mother might. Not Castiel’s mother, of course, Castiel couldn’t remember if she had ever smiled, let alone look at him the way Ellen was.
They stared each other down for a moment, but short of calling him out there wasn’t much Zachariah could actually do. In the end, he drew back, scowling, “Just remember you sail in the morning.”
Adam stood a little taller, almost to attention, “He’s out inspecting the warding.”
Cas pulls Dean close to him, tentatively stroking his face, looking into the galaxy in Dean’s eyes. “It’s a shame I’ll miss the conjunction tonight,” he says but even as he says it, he’s smiling softly. “But, I have something infinitely more beautiful to look upon.”
, Castiel.”
Sam’s eyes narrowed dangerously, “Dean. Your better half shorts out half the power grid every time he...he...” he waved his hand as though the gesture alone could finish the thought that he clearly didn’t want to voice.
“Hm, yeah, that’s true. My mother used to tell me stories about the Winchester fire wielders. You know the legends say the magic started with a Novak and Winchester mated pair, I think that’s why they chose a Novak for the Prince, y’know. All that romantic stuff about mating and magic.”
. Being here, with you, just the two of us. It’s nice.”
Gabriel held out an opened envelope that Castiel practically ripped from his hands, “
"I um...I have something...that uh..." Cas stuttered, nibbling at his bottom lip. Dean wished he wouldn't do that at the best of times, but at this point it was less distracting and more worrying. Cas rarely stuttered. Dean had seen several shades of Castiel: Angel of the Lord in his time and this was well into ‘freaking out’ territory. Reflexively, Sam and Dean lowered their cutlery, the ting of metal on ceramic perfectly coordinated as they both turned their full attention to the angel, who looked as though a moment longer under their gaze would have him sweating from stress.
’ might have been nothing more than the lingering stench of demonic activity and would be washed away by the time Sam refreshed himself.
Gabriel looked over at Sam with a long smirk. “I might have had my reasons.”
“The hell does Sam think he’s even doing?” Dean grumbled, kicking at the floor, hardly caring that he was scuffing his boots and had no prospect of replacing them if they tore.
“The old barracks,” Castiel muttered, checking that the room was secure, but nobody had been here for some time. “One of Adam’s hiding places. He gave me a tour of his nooks while we waited for you and Sam to come back sometimes. These barracks were used when there was an army large enough to justify its construction. Before Sam took over and brought everyone into the castle."
“He has a point,” Cas said, surprising them all. All eyes turned to him, Dean’s included. “They were called mobile homes, people used to use them for vacations.”
Night had settled over them, but the market was not darker for it. There were fire pits and lamps everywhere. Some of the stalls had put bright candles behind coloured glass sending beautiful patterns across the crowds. There were people everywhere, children running around despite the late hour and everyone seemed to be happy. If anyone thought it was odd that a priest of the Temple, however lowly, was walking about the place with a random peasant nobody said anything; they barely even looked. The atmosphere was too jovial for antagonism at any rate.
There is more kissing and Dean can already feel Cas getting hard in his lap. Dean’s been hard since Cas straddled him though granted he’d lagged a little when he thought Cas was breaking up with him before they’d even started.
,” Cas gasps and Dean can’t hold out against such a request. He closes his mouth around the head letting Cas rock deeper until he’s flush against the back of Dean’s throat and Dean is trying to remember how to do this. He swallows around Cas and that is all Cas can stand, pulling him off sharply. Dean looks down on Cas’ heaving chest as he tries to bring himself back under control.
Cas nodded absently even though his eyes had already been drawn back to the wreaths left on the nearby grave.
of him? And hadn’t Dean given every indication that he was also...
“What’ve we got?” Dean asks. He drops into the seat beside Castiel and looks over his shoulder at the screen. He doesn’t try to interfere. Castiel has known other agents who would attempt to assert themselves at this juncture, to take point so that when the time comes, they’ll be the one to get the credit for the success of the mission.
“What is it?” Cas asked even though he was perfectly capable of reading the sign. Dean couldn’t remember when he’d looked so happy and he’d seen Cas look plenty happy recently.
of frustration as his answer.
Castiel couldn’t help but laugh even as Dean tried to kiss it from his lips. “Truly I wonder why I ever resisted your charms when we met.”
“It’s fun though. Maybe I’ll see what the fuss is about one day.”
Dean threw himself down on his bed dramatically, but there was no one there to see him so why not? It was alright for his parents, he thought, thinking back to how his mother had hugged him and cried that morning. They’d met each other several times and knew they would be happy before their wedding. Even if they hadn’t been true mates, they’d at least scent bonded before the marriage negotiations were finalised. Dean hadn’t met his betrothed once yet, negotiations had kept them apart and so they wouldn’t actually meet until they were at the altar. Not that he wanted to meet him anyway. It was nothing personal, but all he had of Prince Castiel was the formal courtship letter that might have been written by anyone to confirm his permission for the arrangement. Not that the prince had received much more from Dean. They knew nothing about each other, they certainly wouldn’t have chosen each other if they’d been given a choice but that was sort of the point. Neither of them had had a choice. Dean tried to imagine Prince Castiel, which wasn’t easy given that he’d never actually seen the man, sitting in the chapel right now. Was he happy to be here? Was he as thrilled with the situation as his mother had apparently been; quite the coup marrying a Novak to a Winchester. Was he reconciling himself to his fate? Was he praying that he’d be a good husband? Dean snorted if he’d chosen to spend his last day as a free man in a church it’s doubtful they had anything in common.
whenever they go stargazing as though Dean has any comprehension of the beauty above them. He’s always too transfixed by the beauty in front of him to notice. That said, he has to admit, the first time Cas pointed out Jupiter to him was pretty cool. And not just because Cas had leaned in close, his hands on Dean’s shoulders to do so.
“Dean,” Castiel pleaded, pulling him back by the arm, “Dean, please.”
With a sigh, Cas had started again. “There’s a rare conjunction of-” He caught Dean’s eye and stopped before he had gone too far. “Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn will be passing close to the earth and to each other at the same time as a meteor shower.”
Still, he forced himself to level the pistol and fired, though he could not have been certain whether or not he had struck true. Roman’s face seemed frozen in that expression, that half a smug smile that showed him untouchable. But there was a hole in his head that had not been there a moment before and Roman’s expression did not change as he dropped to his knees and fell forward into the sand.
“Hi Gabe,” Dean pulled out a chair at his usual table, already unpacking his satchel, “The usual?” He asked Castiel hesitantly, as though Castiel hadn’t started brewing his regular order the moment he’d stepped through the door. As though Castiel hadn’t been doing that for three years.
When Cas moved off Sam caught his eye. Dean tried to reassure him with little more than a smile but Sam’s expression was grim. Adam, by contrast, just looked excited to be there. He’d never heard of an archangel summoning before and his eyes seemed alight with anticipation. Dean couldn’t help but chuckle at the enthusiasm.
and sighed.
Roman was greeting his guests as they filed in and Castiel had naturally fallen into line. He took a breath to steady himself, he would have to be insulting but vague. If he was too direct he’d be removed for disrupting the proceedings. If he seemed to be insulting Roman outright he’d be dismissed as a drunkard and a fool. He was not going to lose this chance. Roman leaned in to shake the hand of the person in front of Castiel, any minute now the game would begin. He closed his eyes for just a moment, remembering Dean, the feel of his arms around him, the press of his lips beneath his ear and he felt calmer than he ever had.
Abruptly, Castiel pulled back, “I’m sorry, I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable, I-”
“I beg your pardon?”
“Dean,” Cas says, almost impatient.
They rested for one day and one day only. They were all in agreement that they wanted to put as much distance between themselves and the ‘Special Children’, though Cas pointed out they were in far more danger from the demons that seemed to live in the area. Meg had cuffed him around the head for that.
Dean was surrounded by idiots.
let out a whimper only to be soothed immediately by Cas’ hand scratching deeply around its ear. It lowered its head again, nuzzling it into Cas’ lap even though the thing was large enough to cover the entirety of Cas’ lower body.
It was the only thing that could explain such peace.
, that’s what he had fallen back on. The role of the angels in all of this. But, that wasn’t why Dean was annoyed. The guy had an angel blade, Dean had never seen him eat, his eyes were surely too blue to be human. The signs had been there for him to pick up on, but he hadn’t, he’d thought with his dick not his head and he’d gone and gotten a crush on an angel.
“Took you boys long enough,” he said, gruffly, though Castiel heard the warmth in his voice. Even though the man wasn’t smiling, he couldn’t have been happier to see them. He didn’t rise from his chair and Dean got down beside him to hug him, unmistakeably checking him over as he did so. “Alright, alright, I’m fine, get off me,” the man grumbled, pushing Dean away, even though they were both laughing. The man gave a polite nod, “Sam.”
He’d only been there once. Physically at least. He thought about it often and dreamed of it more.
He was so beautiful.
His mate.
Castiel felt the rigging beneath his feet snap and he fell backwards onto the ship, aware of both the stinging of a rope as it frayed past his face and the breath that left him as he landed heavily on his back. Not that he lay there for long, immediately pulling himself up to survey the deck. Several of the halliards would need to be re-rolled and the deck was littered with splinters and crew pulling themselves up to resume their duties, relatively unfazed by the turn of events, as only sailors could be.
If you would like more Dean/Cas carnival adventures feat. plushies may I suggest this amazing,
It was the wrong thing to say, or perhaps it was the very right thing to say as Cas closed what little distance existed between them, slipping into Dean’s lap, straddling his thighs. Dean’s hands went to Cas’ hips automatically, as he shifted to make them more comfortable. Goddamn, he loved how roomy the car was.
Over his mate’s head, Dean felt Sam’s eye on him and they exchanged a look, somewhere between shock and utter amusement.
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas says quietly, still looking at him fondly.
Dean’s eyes opened and he realised with horror that he wasn’t dead. Crowley’s hand was harsh against his scalp, forcing him to look up. Crowley’s eyes were red but it was the way that his lips were twisted into an unnatural smile that made him truly look like a demon.
Castiel didn’t let him finish, surging forward to kiss him, their lips slotting together as though they were meant to be, because ultimately they were. It was love and adoration and sadness, a little wetter than either of them would have liked but Castiel was not about to let him go, not for anything. Even as they broke for air, they barely allowed a fraction of space between them.
Clarence had paused at a stall, surreptitiously sniffing the air, “What’s that?” he asked, Dean, his lips parted as though he might taste whatever it was he could smell. For a moment Dean panicked, wondering if it could possibly be him he was scenting, but he quickly realised that even if by some miracle such a thing could happen through the layers of balm he was wearing to disguise his scent then he still wouldn’t be able to detect it through the multitude of smells that surrounded them. But the one that cut through them all was the distinct warmth of sweetness and vanilla and Dean indicated to a stall tucked away where a woman was preparing all manner of pastries.
“What the hell are you doing here?” Zachariah hissed, foregoing the formalities.
Cas rolled his eyes and laughed, “Of course, together. I don’t want to be apart from you, not for a moment.”
Castiel rolled his eyes, allowing Alfie to slip on his overcoat, “The man is frustrated and has family far higher in the Admiralty than I,
“Have you been feeling dizzy? Either in spells or generally? Any nausea at all, Castiel?” his mother asked, completely ignoring her son.
Dean looked at him,
"Oh like the power doesn't start going every time you two-"
“Yes,” Cas said, in perfect time with Dean’s, “No.”
“Garth!” he shouted over to one of the swifter members of the crew. “I want you up for’ard, we’re going to come about but when I call, I’ll need you to run up the headsail and flat it out to starboard.” Garth stared at him for a moment, before Castiel tapped him on the shoulder, “go on!” he insisted.
“Wow. We finally got him.”
Sam almost knocked Dean aside as he dropped from his horse, practically running to the stone to touch it, as though his touch could confirm what his eyes were telling him.
“We’ll be back!” Dean assured him and he might have launched into a whole new avenue of teasing seeing as the only reason Sam would rule himself out of helping was if he already had plans. Plans that probably involved Eileen. But, he had his own date to get to and he would never run out of opportunities to hassle his brother.
Sam handed Bobby his satchel, staying long enough to hear Bobby’s snort of thanks, which sounded sincere even though he didn’t actually say anything. Sam headed back the way they came, while Dean seemed to hesitate over moving closer to Bobby.
, I remember that. I’m just wondering how we’ve gone from ‘the gate in Purgatory needs to be closed behind them,’ to ‘
“Oh yeah. Perfect sense,” Dean sighed, running a hand through his hair, “Except the bit about trapping an archangel. I don’t know much about them but aren’t they supposed to be assholes? What makes you think trapping one of them will make them want to listen to us?”
Castiel took a breath, mentally counting to ten in his head. It was a tired argument, one he was sick of having, but his desire for cohesion above all else among his ranking officers meant he wouldn’t challenge the man directly, even though a stern word is all that would be needed.
The sand beneath Castiel was turning red with his own blood and he was aware that he couldn’t breathe so much as he was forced to gasp down burning lungfuls of air. There was no pain, that was unexpected. But he wasn’t dead yet and Balthazar’s arms were firm around him. He looked at Balthazar and gave the slightest of nods, his head already spinning from such a small motion.
“Blessed be the Norm, enjoy the afternoon,” Dean said, cheerily, not wanting to talk to Gordon for any length of time longer than he had to. If nothing else the line of people wanting to pass through the checkpoint was long and those at the front were clearly impatient. Thankfully, Gordon didn’t hang around and Dean took a few moments to make sure he had everything he needed to hand. The government list had been updated, he noticed. The arm length limit had been reduced by a centimetre for whatever that was worth. Dean shrugged and buzzed the next person through, remembering just in time to smash the timer beside him to random, Cas had said they were on alert after all.
From his bunk, Sam snorted, “You just want to look at the cars.”
Stepping forward, Dean was on the brink of greeting his father when the king turned away to help someone dismount.
” Gabriel snapped, but there was no malice there, “You’re already joined at the...you know...everything...of course he’s going to say yes. If you don’t believe me, here’s your chance to find out.” He gestured to the front door where the man in question was stepping in, wiping damp shoes on the welcome mat.
So this was supposed to be the last chapter but...it started to get real, real long and I honestly had a blast with this chapter so I'm just gonna roll with it :D
Ishim was not deterred and again Castiel quashed the urge to roll his eyes. “But five weeks and not a hint of him, the admiralty would not take it amiss if we couldn’t find him.”
He'd take his family sword. It rarely saw the light of day, it seemed appropriate.
“I’ll tell Dad.”
Gabriel and Sam exchanged a look. It had been some months since Castiel had seen them. Gabriel was, of course, unchanged but Sam was showing the signs of an extended stay in Purgatory. His armour was tarnished, his beard fuller than Castiel had ever seen and he had apparently developed the ability to communicate with Gabriel without saying a word.
Cas looked between them, puzzled, “...I feel fine.”
Now if the rest of Dean could accept the statement as easily as he could think it then everything would be just peachy.
Phone still in hand, Cas thinks for a moment and Dean can’t look away. He’s staring into the middle distance, working backwards from the time the planets will be the most visible. Even when he’s doing something so mundane Dean finds him beautiful.
Even with the promise of battle looming, Ishim seemed determined to keep his ill-humour. Every time Castiel looked over at him he seemed to be engaged in hushed conversation, which was impressive in itself given the close quarters in which every man was forced to conduct himself. Castiel wasn’t prone to paranoia but the way in which Ishim went quiet every time the captain passed was starting to grate a little. Castiel had commanded
It was eight days before Dean saw Castiel again and Gods how he missed him. They had not been parted before and it seemed strange to be parted now, especially as Cas had only come with him to this Godforsaken place in the first place to prevent them from being separated. And it wasn’t as though they were particularly distant. Only one hallway and a handful of heavy doors came between them, but it was enough. Cas had asked that no one enter, closed the door and that had been that.
Dean didn’t want to hear it. “Cards on the table, Cas. You tell us that actually despite everything we thought angels
A footman tapped the side of a champagne glass, calling for the room’s attention.
The salty tang tastes bitterly sweet on Dean’s tongue as he moves from kisses to lapping at the slit. He runs his lips, his tongue down the length to the base and listens for every groan, every whimper that tells him what Cas wants him to do again.
They walked around the market, taking in the sights with Dean pointing out things he thought Clarence might find interesting. Not once did he indicate something that Clarence didn’t give his full attention and even as men started lighting torches around the place, indicating the end of the day, they didn’t stop their meandering. Neither did anyone else.
“We need to leave, we need to leave
,” she insisted, “I knew you’d be the one to make my son happy.”
Dean laughs with him and the sound of them laughing together is probably the most wonderful sounds Dean’s ever heard. They’ve laughed at things before but not like this. Not
‘Rooms’ was something of an understatement. An entire wing of the palace had been refurbished for the newlyweds, though thankfully Mary’s hand was everywhere and all was tasteful and understated. Dean knew that tradition ran to ostentatious decorations, huge golden vases filled with flowers of glass and silk, or chandeliers draped with crystals and quartz. He still remembered how his mother spoke of the water feature that had been installed when she had married his father. A huge, garish thing that apparently symbolised fertility and love. She had it removed before the wedding celebrations had ended.
Castiel watched him go, fondly, before he turned his attention back to the other Winchester brother. He wasn’t exactly sure what it was he could offer and he was in no way close enough to Sam to presume to tell him what to do, but still...there was something not quite right and if Castiel could help at all, he would. Or at least he’d try to. The worst that could come of it would be Sam being even more annoyed at him than he already seemed to be.
Dean caught Cas’ hands in his own, “You might have saved his life,
is ready to set sail.” Again the smattering of applause, again Castiel was sure to join in. “Come dawn,
“I’d like that very much.”
“How long are we going to continue this fool’s errand, wasting time and rations looking for one lousy pirate? Shall we starve to death in the endeavour?”
Dean all but dragged them over, still laughing that Clarence could find such joy in something as mundane as a pastry sold for less than a denar on a street corner. He held two fingers up to the stall tender while Clarence wasn’t looking, “it’s a pastry, glazed with sugared fruits...They’re great.” The woman at the stall passed Dean two fritters and Dean passed one to Clarence.
Never that blue.
“We can stay for tonight,” Cas said, patiently, already holding his hand up in anticipation of her protest. “We don’t know where the nearest clean water source is, the remaining asphalt prevents us from farming and we have no way of securing this place against intruders.”
The movement Dean had clocked earlier was revealed to be a small group of people, all gathered in front of the building, one of the tallest Dean had seen to survive the Tribulation, looking at them curiously.
It was backbreaking, gruelling work and after moving just a few boxes Castiel found himself wishing for his coxswain, anything to help ease the weight that screamed against his protesting limbs. But he kept going. They all did. Benny managed to navigate the boats even in the dark and still found the strength to carry twice as many casks as Sam, Dean and Castiel, putting them to shame a little.
“Meet them amidships!” Castiel called, hearing his orders echo from officer to officer until the ship obediently turned to close the distance between them.
“Zachariah wouldn’t hear it, he burned the report in front of me.”
Castiel nods and lets him go. He takes his time getting up, his body refusing to be rushed. He ties off the condom and throws it into the bin. He tilts his head and between the sheets and the trash, he wonders what housekeeping are going to think of them. The bedclothes are in dire need of attention. The sheets are streaked with patches of semen and he knows they’re going to have to have them changed before they sleep on them again.
Dean looked at Sam but Sam only shrugged even if his face looked panicked. “Alright,” Dean snapped. “Rig me up.”
“Yeah,” Dean chimed in, hoping that maybe he might be able to sway the argument. “C’mon, you must have wanted to poison me at least once in the last few days.”
This couldn’t be real.
Dean hadn’t been about to say anything, but his mouth clamped shut anyway. Sam fell silent too and they exchanged awkward glances. Maybe...Maybe he could just grab Cas and force him into the Impala? That would be preferable, infinitely preferable, to having this conversation.
“I’m fine,” he insisted, trying to push Castiel away, even though all Castiel was trying to do was wipe the crusted blood from his brow. There was a lot of it.
Cas’ touch was warm against Dean’s cheek, bordering on too warm, it wouldn’t be long before the next wave of his heat hit. “I’d say I love you too, but I hardly feel that does my feelings justice,” Cas said, quietly, and Dean could not remember a time when his heart felt so full. “Now, if you don’t mind, Alpha. I’d very much like you to knot me while I’m in my right mind.”
There were words about the importance of the alliance that was being solemnised between the two kingdoms today, the significance of the ancient ties between the two lands, even some poetry over the symbolism of the two emblems of fire and ice. Their gloves were set aside and in removing them Dean detected the hint of a tremor in the other man’s hands. As well there might be. Dean didn’t know what was going on, there was no way this could be happening, but nobody seemed inclined to stop it. Nobody stepped forward announcing there had been a terrible mistake and then the Novak family ring was on Dean’s fourth finger and it wouldn’t have mattered if anyone had stepped forward.
Dean held out the letter, sealed with his own device, the device he’d be allowed to use as of today once he took the throne. “Could you take this to my-” the word died on his tongue. Affianced? Intended? Future husband? “-to the Novak prince, please?”
“Sure,” Dean grumbled still not entirely willing to trust her, even though if it hadn’t been for Rowena, Cas would probably have succumbed to rejection. And, Dean would have likely ripped Sam’s head off. Still, he wasn’t a hundred percent convinced of her motives and Rowena hid her own scent as much as the Winchesters did. Come to think of it, Dean wasn’t even sure what Rowena’s secondary was. Not that he had cause or reason to ponder it often. Or at all.
Queen Mary shook her hair out as she took off her helm, as unassuming and unrecognisable as any of the soldiers behind her. The Queen had never been a warrior but she was hardly an easy target. If any demons had tried to make off with her then they would have found themselves biting off more than they could chew. And many of them had several mouths. Still, disguising her as a run of the mill soldier was a smart move. Beside her, the Captain of the Guard dismounted, like them, removing his helmet but he looked hesitantly between Dean and his father.
Turning his attention back toward the world outside, Castiel realised that he was impatient for his brothers to arrive. Perhaps they had mistaken the hour, after all when one deals in timespans of millennia the individual minutes tended to get lost. He had not appreciated how lonely his service would be, looking out among the stars. As beautiful as they were, they were nothing compared to the quiet softness of Heaven and the company of his brothers. He had not thought angels could get lonely, but after a few thousand years with only the comets for conversation, and poor conversation at that, Castiel had found himself longing for even Gabriel’s irritating affections.
“Coming,” Dean called, his voice a little raspier than he would have liked.
“Or we could stay,” Castiel offered, beyond gratified when he saw that Dean was considering it. It had been too long since they’d kissed each other like this.
“They’re right, Dean,” Adam said. “Castiel isn’t in control of his power right now. He could hurt you.”
Cas named the giant teddy bear Balthazar on account of his light fur. He had a blue ribbon around his neck which reminded Dean of Cas’ tie, he was large enough to take up most of Baby’s backseat and they most certainly turned him around so he couldn’t watch them that night.
sleeping next to Dean. Given how long he had lived, Castiel had thought there was little that could surprise him. Finding out the simple delight in being lulled to sleep by the rise and fall of his mate’s chest, the steady softness of his breathing only to wake again, refreshed to find Dean exactly where he’d left him or smiling down at him, his hair mussed from where it had lain against the pillow, had been an unexpected pleasure. That was to say nothing of his dreams.
An angel.
Dean heaved the shopping down the stairs and regretted that he hadn’t accepted Cas’ offer of help on what was just a standard supply run. He managed to get to the bottom of the stairs without dropping the beer which was the important thing but his stomach instinctively clenched when he looked up and saw that Sam was waiting for him at the war room’s table.
Dean takes a breath. Then another. He doesn’t sound at all okay when he picks up the phone again, but it doesn’t stop him. “Sorry, sir. You were saying?”
Looking over at the deck Castiel couldn’t help but snort. “I wouldn’t call that clean.”
“You look wonderful, Dean.”
Standing before the door to Dean’s cabin, Castiel was aware of the great many pairs of eyes watching him. He would be lying if they didn’t make him feel a little self conscious, but he also knew that the people looking at him were happy to do so, fully aware of what Castiel’s presence there meant and what it meant for their captain. It felt strange to knock on the door of the room he was practically living in, the room he had deliberately stayed out of so he wouldn’t accidentally bump into Dean and blow the surprise he himself had been preparing for their dinner. He heard shuffling from the other side of the door, before Dean opened it. He did a double take and then his jaw fell somewhere on the ground and Castiel beamed at him, totally satisfied that Dean had reacted the way he had wanted.
“I-” he started but he broke off, looking at Cas. Cas looked back, seemingly conveying an entire conversation through his eyes alone. This time when Gabriel sighed it was one of resigned defeat, “Alright. Alright, if you pull this off I’ll make sure the gates are sealed behind you, but you know you won’t be able to use the crook
"What do you mean 'us'?"
“Thank you,” he said, quietly, only a little surprised to find that she apparently knew exactly what he was talking about. Convention required her to wear black, as the widow of the old king in the presence of the new, even when the new king was her own son, but even so, her eyes sparkled and she beamed at him.
He clicks the next button along and flinches in surprise when soft music that must have been composed for a really bad seventies porno flick starts playing from speakers that are apparently concealed within the headboard. This time when Dean clicks it a second time the music doesn’t change but there’s a faint whirring sound from above them. A moment later the room is bathed in a steady rotating glow cast by an honest-to-God disco ball that has descended from above them.
There was a bridge not far from the bunker. It had stretched across a valley once upon a time, though it had long since collapsed before it reached the other side. Dean would never have risked taking the car onto it at all, but it was a nice spot to park nonetheless. It was open enough that if anything tried to approach them then they would see them in plenty of time to do something about it, plus they could look down into the valley. Cas liked heights.
Beside him, Cas’ wings bristled and he rubbed at his nose, sniffing against the stifling smell of smoke laden with sulphur. It was a far cry from the gardens Dean had promised him the run of back home and not for the first time since their journey had started did Dean feel a pang of guilt for the life he was bringing his mate to. The week they had spent during Cas’ first heat, with nothing else to do but lie on silk sheets and bring pleasure to each other seemed very far away right now.
