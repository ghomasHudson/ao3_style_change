“Shhh, shh,” John soothed, thrusting in a steady, claiming rhythm. “Good omega,” he crooned.
Sherlock looked up from his experiment as Mycroft stepped in. “You’re leaving.”
Mycroft pulled back and Sherlock snuggled deeper into his arms, ignoring the tears pricking his eyes.
“Sherlock sent you,” Mycroft said, a statement not a question. “What did he say?”
He was somehow completely at ease in the dingy pub. It might have something to do with being the closest pub to his parents’ cottage, but Greg doubted that. Whatever his reasons Greg was certainly enjoying the view. Mycroft had always been attractive, but a less stiff Mycroft was a gorgeous one.
“And what gives you the impression I would be interested?”
Already large blisters covered her hands, face, mouth, and throat. Time stopped for him then. He remembered counting the leaves, none were missing or eaten. He remembered stripping off his gloves, not wanting to risk any of the oils being on his hands, then grabbing Watson. He stripped he down to her nappy, and gently placing her in the sink. He doesn’t remember calling Lestrade and his brother, begging for them to pull a miracle out of the air. All he remembers is washing Watson with lukewarm soapy water, hoping to get as much of the oil off as possible. He remembers watching her airway as she screamed. He doesn’t remember paramedics, or arriving at the hospital. He does remember seeing Watson look so small in her hospital gown and too big bed, wires and tubes hooked up to her as she slept. He doesn’t remember what John screamed at him in the hospital hallway, only his face, and the whirring noise in his ears. Watson was going to be ok, but that wasn’t the point. Sherlock let her get hurt, he said he would protect her, that his lab would be safe. He didn’t, it wasn’t.
Rosie sat laying upside down on her bed with her head off the end and her arms raised in a crossed position above her eyes. Overall a pose she probably shouldn't hold for very long. Her sobs had settled a bit but, she continued to sniffle. Gina had seen the crap telly shows her uncles sometimes watched, Rosie had all the symptoms of a broken heart. Crying, comfort food as evidenced by the jaffa cakes on her side table, isolation, and even anger if the argument she heard when her Dad dropped off her and Max. Da had always said that a broken heart was the most world ending thing that could happen to a person. Da was composed of 78% logic, 20% weird government loop holes, and 2% noir film buff, so he must be correct on this.
Sherlock doesn’t remember leaving the hospital, or calling Molly to retrieve his experiments. He just knows that somewhere between John shouting at him and the nurses escorting him out that he made a decision to change. Truly change. Three weeks later Mycroft found him in 221C, with three walls gutted and the floor ripped up, laying on his back on said floor panting. His hands were sore, apparently he ripped at least some of the floor up by hand. He explained what he wanted, and Mycroft called professionals for the remodel. John had been staying primarily with his daughter, only leaving to shower at Lestrade’s, as it was closer. After Mycroft made his calls John had come storming down in 221C and demanded why he hadn’t been to see his goddaughter.
Mary was taken aback. “What?”
“Hmmm?”
Shit.  This was it, then.  It was time to come clean.  “My father...” Ivan began.
Sherlock shrugged and stole more crisps. He’d eaten more than half by now. “Tolerates me, then.”
Nods of agreement all around.
“You could have called Angela...”
They’d arrange things differently, tonight.
“No guards at the door of the main keep.  He’s depending on the guards at the outer gate.  Bit sloppy, that.”
“Damn it, Sherlock, there are police constables meant to be doing that sort of thing. Couldn’t you have waited for one just this once?”
Oh. John glanced at the bedroom door. It remained closed, as it had been when they returned home the night before. He looked back at Sherlock, laying visual siege to the kettle instead of trying to concentrate on work. Nerves?
When he arrived in the kitchen, Marfa Hudovna looked him over and nodded.  Then she reached around her neck and pulled something over her head – a cord from which was strung a wooden frame with a handle, holding a round piece of clear glass.  She handed this to Ivan, indicating that he should put it around his own neck.
“But this isn’t your thing. I knew that and I asked you anyway and it’s amazing that you took the time to research dating, uh, protocols and you were, well. You were perfect. But this isn’t your thing.”
large. Mary’s no more than average height and
When they reached the house, Sherlock bounded into the kitchen yelling.  “Mrs. Hudson, Mrs. Hudson!”
“It is, however, a ring recognized as symbolizing power, which is all that I need.”  Sherlock attached the ring with a pair of wires to a small, glittering device, then attached another wire to the black feather he still carried.
John couldn’t help it. He started to laugh, which set Harry off, and then she started crying again, just a bit, even though she was still laughing.  John handed her more napkins.  She blew her nose, loudly.  Her eyes were even pinker than her hair.
But Mary kept talking. “I did some digging around while I was away. Sherlock may not have known what his absence would do to you – but you don’t know what he did

This was not the life John had expected when he returned to the UBR.

“Why’s that?”
“She got the first point right too,” John inserted. “About me not paying attention to other betas. Or didn’t you ever wonder why I only brought megfriends home, never bettifriends?”
Ivan flexed his feet in his boots and tried stretching his hands as surreptitiously as possible.
“I joined the Fifth Northumberland myself, 14 years ago.  Served three years, before, well...”
Sherlock stared a moment, then quirked a humourless smile. “Very good, John.  Yes.  Working in and selling supplies to illegal drug labs was, for some years, my favourite means of support.  I had no objection to being paid in kind, and the work was far more lucrative that picking pockets or other sorts of petty theft, although I did resort to those as well on occasion.”
“The conductor of light thing. Yeah.”  John felt his anger begin to drain away.  “I recognized that.”
“He’s moulting, dear.”
“Sherlock, your body has five months’ of preparations to make in half the time! How are you going to make that happen?”
“There is another camera on the building opposite you.  Do you see it?”
Somehow John ended up in a cab with Sherlock heading back to Baker Street while Mary drove Isaac Whitney and Bill Wiggins home, although whether or not Wiggins actually had a home was a good question. Then once they arrived at Baker Street, Mycroft and his minions were there and John’s chair wasn’t.
“Don’t shrug at me like that. The case is over, so you’re eating.  Thai, or would you rather something else?”
“He’s been here all evening, Mrs Hudson?” asked Lestrade.
moderately intelligent.  He’d been lacking... motivation.”
2)	Also in life as we know it, chorioallantoic placentas are the exception rather than the rule among marsupials.  Google bandicoots if you’re interested.
Sherlock seemed to take the insult in stride, merely replying that he was here to see Detective Inspector Lestrade and that yes, he’d been invited.  But when the woman persisted in questioning him as to

“After which nothing at ground level is safe.”
“Now, you mentioned that you’ve just returned from holidays?”
“Dull,” sniffed the creature.
“What does that mean?”
a minor.”
“Perhaps that Inspector Lestrade could assign some constables as guards? Where Sherlock’s a witness in a murder case and all?”
“If you’d yelled for me then...”
After what seemed a long while later, John poked at the drowsy detective in his arms. “Enjoyed or tolerated?”
And then his wife, the nurse, pulled a gun out of her jacket, cocked it and pointed it at him. John’s breath caught before he realized. Not at
“I thought you said he approved of me?”
And John leaned forward and kissed him.
“Whatever you were thinking of made you smile,” said Sherlock quietly.  “You started to, ah, masturbate and you looked as if it were hard for you and then your face changed and you smiled and it got easier.”
“Well, people usually trust doctors.”
“When I was a child,” Sherlock began, “I wanted to be a dancer.”
“Today we saw two people make vows. I’ve never made a vow in my life, and after tonight I never will again. So, here in front of you all, my first and last vow. Mary and John: whatever it takes, whatever happens, from now on I swear I will
“John, I’ve had a lovely evening,” Sherlock began. Then he seemed to hesitate.
“I knew Sherlock and his brother as boys,” she began.  “I was head cook in their mother’s household.  The boys were always about the kitchens, Mycroft – that’s the brother – to cadge sweets and Sherlock, I think he was just looking for a place where he could watch people rather than be watched

Over-protective.
The man looked at him curiously.  “You don’t seem very afraid.”
“Okay. Okay, I’ll do that. You going to see him today?”
“Hashen’ka,” Ivan said wearily, “it’s hardly past noon and you’ve had three bottles of vodka.”
It was an obvious distraction, but one Ivan was grateful for.  They spent the rest of the evening telling tales, but the entire time Ivan’s heart sang, he’s alive.  Sherlock’s alive.

“Ah, hello,” she said, a bit hesitantly. Nice voice, a bit high.  “I hope you don’t think I’m pushy, but...”
Sherlock laughed, while Dexter mimed mock-offense, grinning all the while.

3)	As Sherlock notes, a newly born marsupial uses its forelimbs to pull themselves from its mother’s birth canal to her pouch.  In life as we know it, evolutionary biologists theorize that this would prevent the development of marsupial species in which the forelimbs had evolved into flippers or wings.  Hence the amarsupial bats and sea mammals in this fic.
John maintained that he was perfectly capable of following verbal instructions and pointed out that Sherlock certainly had no problems telling him what to do in
“Vigourous feeder, is she?” he asked with obvious approval.
Ivan watched with curiosity as Sherlock positioned himself facing the wall to one side of the spot Ivan had indicated.  He spread his wings slightly and leapt up from the floor.  As he grabbed hold of one of the brackets supporting the hangings, he also dug his clawed feet into the hangings to brace himself.  Then he manoeuvred his body until he could lean over and reach
“John, dear, would you like some breakfast as well?”
A sharp knock at the bus’ door brought John back from his reverie.  They were locked in a line of traffic, none of the vehicles able to move even a few inches.  Still, John was surprised when the bus driver got out of his seat and opened the door.  John smelled... sausage?  His mouth watered.
“You’re saying that until Mary, I’d never met anyone else I was genetically compatible with? Sorry, Sherlock,
A pause.  Then: “You didn’t kill him.”
“Sherlock, please, yes!” And then as Sherlock sank down on him, John threw back his head and yelled, “Sherlock!”
“Can you talk about something else while we’re eating?”
“Riots in the streets, people shooting.  My husband Joe was one of the ones shooting.  Our son, Joe Jr, he wasn’t ever involved.  I made sure of that.  But he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  My son’s been gone these 14 years.  Now my husband’s gone too.  So what were these questions you wanted to ask?”
Or, no, not flame, Ivan realized when he started breathing again.  But the growing sunlight displayed all the colours of flame – crimson and scarlet, gold and citrine, even the pale purplish-blue of the hottest flames – on its wings and tail.  The feathers shaded to a rich purple on its upper body, which had two very human arms, and then to black on its head and lower body.  A crest of black feathers grew from its head.  Its black-feathered legs looked almost human, except that they ended in the clawed feet of a bird.

On the first day, there were no texts.

Sherlock put his own menu down onto the table.  “If Angelo finds out that you’re my husband just returned after 14 years away, he’s either going to organize an impromptu anniversary feast or take you out back and knock you around with a frying pan for being gone so long.  Actually, he might knock you around first and

“John,” Sherlock mumbled. “You.” Then he straightened in John’s arms and said more clearly, “Oh!
John resigned himself to the inevitable.  “All right.  I will stay up all night with you.  I will take the phone message for you.  But Sherlock?  If you attempt to leave this flat without first phoning the information in to New Scotland Yard, I will knock you down and
be swept under the carpet! John, be a dear and take one of these out to Timothy.” She handed him two cups of punch. “He’s fussing with the fire in the sitting room. And if he starts making little humming noises, just give him a little poke. That usually does it.”
Capellini al gamberetti turned out to be shrimp on very fine pasta – and delicious.  It came with a green salad, which John made a discreet pretense of ignoring once he realized that Sherlock was picking bits and pieces out of it with his fingers.  If Sherlock was willing to eat at least John’s salad, then John was willing to give it up.
“All right, then, thanks.”  John turned to go – and then turned back.  “Look, Dr Hooper, I’d like to apologize for Sherlock’s behaviour earlier.  No one should be treated like that.”
Ivan hesitated, then said, “I don’t mean to pry, but if we’re to infiltrate the keep together, I need to know what you know.  You wouldn’t know about the windows unless you’d been here before.”
“You’re kicking me out.”
John was wool-gathering as he waited for Sherlock to return when he heard the pub’s main door open and shut again.  He glanced in that direction – and froze.  For a horrible moment, he thought he was looking at his uncle Andrew.  But no, Andrew would be older now than the man who stared back at him, red-faced, sweating, a good three stone overweight and apparently just as shocked as John was.
Sherlock closed his eyes, not letting any sound escape, though he couldn't help the stiffness of his spine, the wrongness of Mycroft’s bite. It hurt because someone not an alpha bonding him left his hormones with nowhere to go, the chemicals that should be mixing with his alpha instead sizzled in his veins. It hurt because he knew Mycroft took no pleasure in this, but continued to do so because cold logic told them both it was the best, safest, course of action. It hurt because Mycroft deserved more then him, deserved to find someone that could make him smile, not sigh with frustration, someone that wouldn’t feel trapped in a life and a lie. But that could never be. Even if Mycroft found a lover, it was still illegal, still not done. Sex and bonding were only for procreation, anything else was uncivilized at best, depraved at worst. If the truth of his inclinations were ever discovered he could be killed or worse. And that would leave Sherlock all alone, an omega with no one to shelter him.
“Have you lived here long?”
Mycroft caught the emotion on Greg’s face, but let it lie as their food appeared.
“Thank you My,” Sherlock said softly, trying to find sleep, though it took a long time to come.
“I'm only trying to keep you safe, ‘Lock,” Mycroft murmured. He pulled away, pressing a kiss to Sherlock’s brow. “I love you, brother,” he said, stepping out, and shutting the door behind him.
“Yes, well, he does have unusual interests, and I wouldn’t be terribly surprised if he was in fact able to solve it.” Mycroft tapped his umbrella gently. “Would you mind releasing him into my care? He shouldn’t be kept here, we’re trying to get him to catch. Not good to be in such a stressful environment.”
Heart pounding, Mycroft lay underneath Greg, panting for air. “Perfect.”
Mycroft frowned. “I’m listening,” he said quietly.
Sherlock blanched. “He wants to work with me?”
Sherlock huffed. He looked out the window. “There's an opium den.”
Greg kept his voice low. “You've been gone some time. So we tell the truth. While you were gone your omega and trusted boarder fell into congress. You have no choice but to separate from your omega and send them away. I, grieving widower that I am, stay with you to see you through this time. John and Sherlock could set up in another part of town. There will be scandal but I know Sherlock cares little for his reputation and yours will be barely smirched. Mine and John's will take a small hit. By the time the child is born it will have mostly passed. You can ‘reconcile’ by the time the child is born with hardly a huff. Yes, I've been thinking about this.”
“Don’t lie, Sherlock,” Mycroft said, sagging back against Greg. “That’s why you take the drugs. Isn’t it? You really were taking them for the pain.”
John bit, instinct overwhelming him as he knotted Sherlock with a groan.
Mycroft set a hand on his shoulder and then took his leave.
“I don’t have to go home tonight,” Mycroft said. “We could have a room here.”
John took a moment, and then wet his lips. “The servants are gone, it’s just you?” he confirmed, standing quickly. “We...it won’t get out?”
Mycroft moaned. “It's been too long,” he panted, pushing against Greg’s hand.
Sherlock was aware of a bit of arousal in the room and was unsurprised when Stamford quickly made excuses and left. He just wasn’t sure if the arousal was from himself or him. This was going to be terrible trouble. Good. “Your shoulder in the way you carry your arm. You use a cane but the way you stand it’s as if you forget about it. You’re thin, though making some attempt to hide it and you have the hands of a surgeon but also a slight tremble. Also in your head.”
“Please,” Mycroft repeated, panting as he caught Greg’s gaze. “I want you inside me.”
“We should renew the bond bite tonight,” Mycroft said quietly as the carriage arrived outside their home. “It’s fading.”
Greg kept the omega close by him despite the stares of the rest of the yard. “Tell me what you see, Sherlock.”
Sherlock squeezed his brother’s arm. There was the sound of footsteps on the stairs and he took a step back. “Doctor John Watson, this is Mycroft Holmes.”
John sighed, stroking his hand over Sherlock’s belly and then tucking Sherlock to his chest, wrapped them in blankets. “Sleep.”
Sherlock came out of the drawing room, a little bit drawn from the laudanum he'd taken earlier. “Yes?”
“That is your choice. You either ride it out alone, ask Gregory for help, or you risk telling John. Risk losing everything. Your freedom, my power, our money. It is your choice.” Mycroft stood. “You know I will go with whatever you decide. I'll come to you tonight for the bite. I leave in the morning.”
“It’s in my room.”
Sherlock was in bed later that night when Mycroft came to him. He knew he wasn’t what Mycroft really wanted, but part of him was glad he could find some comfort.
“Quite a bit like Sherlock's, aren't they?” Mycroft asked. “Would you care to scent me?”
“Morning...you're Sherlock Holmes?” John asked hesitantly. “Mike Stamford said you might know a place I could board at. I've just gotten back from India. Injured,” he explained.
“No...Sherlock’s heat is due, though.”
“I'm honored.” Greg touched his knee under the water. “Aside from my silence, what do you want from me? This doesn't have to change anything if you don't want it to. But you have a lovely smile.”
Greg rubbed a hand through his hair. “You need to know some things. And those two are so stubborn they might not tell the truth. Sit down, please. Hopefully they forgive me for telling you.”
“The same to you, Inspector. I hope Sherlock is being of use.”
“Pleased to meet you,” said Greg, shaking his hand.
Mycroft sighed, and went to see about supper.
“I am yours. Bite me, Mark me,” Mycroft mumbled.
Mycroft offered his wrist.
Mycroft opened his eyes at the footsteps, staring in shock at Gregory Lestrade.
“It hurts beyond the bite itself?” Mycroft asked suddenly. “Sherlock, why didn’t you say anything?”
Mycroft stepped in, shutting the door behind Greg. “The walls and doors are not as thick as I would like,” he said, wetting his lips.
“It was on the table by the door where I’d see it when I first walk in.” He rubbed his face. “You don’t think she did it?”
“There’s much I could do. Work you open until you’re a writhing mess, then take you so slowly you’re begging me for it?”
“I know.” Mycroft nuzzled into his neck gently. “Everytime I bite him...It’s hard for both of us.”
Sherlock huffed and handed over a piece of paper. “In case you forgot what I told you.”
“It’s not good for an omega to be bitten by a beta,” said Greg. “Because your body doesn’t know what to do with itself.”
“As you so frequently point out, this is how it must be.” Sherlock tried to keep the bitterness from his voice.
“There’s no need,” said Sherlock in a carefully controlled voice. “I know Lestrade is waiting for you.”
Greg sighed. “I do miss her. We were friends, at least.”
“Sorry Master Holmes,” said John. “There’s someone here who says they need to speak with you urgently.”
“Of course. Thank you for letting me know that.” Greg smiled at him again, captivated by the blue eyes. Ah, the things he could never have.
Mycroft stepped out as the servant answered, eyes going wide. “Inspector Lestrade? Are you all right?”
Sherlock quickly collected himself. “Yes. My mate and I have a spare room. You’re a doctor.”
“Gregory, where did you find this note?” Mycroft asked, leading him out to a waiting carriage.
Mycroft spread his legs wantonly, grasping Greg’s shoulders.
“I trust you.”
“Yours. Only yours.”
Greg chuckled. “There's a lot of paperwork for us too.”
Greg found himself oddly relieved. “I understand. The things omegas must do to even try to make their way in society…” he shook his head.
“It’s fine. You can afford it. 221 Baker Street.”
Mycroft hid an amused smile. “Come along, Sherlock. Thank you, Inspector.”
“Yes sir.”
G. Lestrade
“I’d like that,” admitted Sherlock. “I’ll be in my rooms.” He flounced up the stairs.
I didn’t get it, but I wasn’t about to ask him to explain. “I’ll be ready, eventually. I promise.” I hoped. “I just... need some time.”
“It doesn’t lock,” Sherlock explained, tiredly. “It’s never locked.”
Anna wailed louder. “Oh, get her out of here!” John barked from the tub. “Why are you even here? What are you—“
“You know,” John continued, uncomfortably, “like, make it a game. Make it fun.”
“Oh, come off it! I can see the length of it, all the way from here to the top of the hill. It looks fine to me.”
Sherlock gathered his nerves, whatever little he had left, and turned around.
Mycroft began. “First of all, Molly, no one is like me. No one. I am a person, but I am not 'people.' Most people are extremely narrow-minded, they can’t see that the world extends much farther past the person they kiss goodnight. Much, much farther.
” he shouted, pushing him back. “I’m done with you! Just leave me alone.
“I’m a bloody doctor, Sherlock. I know everything there is to know about the human body.” He began to move his hand over Sherlock’s cock. “I know about every pleasure center, every sensitive spot. And I know exactly where to find them.” And with that, John gently took one of Sherlock’s balls in his mouth.
“It’s the beach!” cried Mrs. Hudson. “You never know. Let me run and get that bottle for you.” She climbed down the stairs.
The desire shoots all the way up through my chest. The couch is beginning to creak, we’re really bouncing, now. The lady’s voice goes up high, and then higher, and higher. She hits the highest note and I come, just for the cliché of it. I arch my back and grip the couch and groan with my eyes shut tight.
“I hope so, too,” Sherlock added. “Your marks cannot afford—“
“So he somehow got the key, and used it to get all of us in the same place at the same time, to expose her partnership with him, thus ruining any chance she had at a normal life with me.” John shook his head. “God, that’s sadistic.”
chooses.” Harry glanced back down at Anna, and Anna, right on cue, burst into tears and hid herself again. Satisfaction blossomed in Sherlock’s chest. “I believe that settles it. Goodbye, Harriet.”
John gave him a puzzled look.
Of course, when I say “all over,” I’m exaggerating. His knee brushed up against my knee for the majority of the ride there, jostling back and forth as we drove. His spread-legged stance was just a bit too wide to be completely comfortable, so I could tell he was doing it just so we had some sort of physical contact. He couldn’t stand to be away from me for any length of time, even the thirty minutes it took to get to Wembley. I tried to keep from smiling too much. It was a strange dichotomy, to be annoyed with him for being there, and also immensely enjoying his physical presence. I’d hoped to go out today, alone, to be distracted from our affair. My brain needed a rest from it so that I could go back to deducing it later with a fresh perspective. But there was no rest, it just kept on going.
“And then I… told him I didn’t know why, and he fell forward, and I…” Sherlock squirmed in his seat, “I tried to comfort him.”
. He swiped it off the table and stood up, swaying a bit on his feet. “’Night,” he said to Sherlock, turning and shuffling toward the stairs.
“I would say it is extremely likely, Annalise. He knows that you are his daughter—he’s the one who told us in the first place—and he hates Sherlock desperately. He made it his mission long ago to destroy Sherlock’s life... which is why he killed John, of course. It only makes sense that he would come after you.”
Anna had smiled, remembering the vents from when she was a child. “Don’t worry, I’ve got a plan.”
“I don’t know, Mary,” John sighed. “I just have this feeling, like something is very, very wrong.”
Carruthers nodded. “Yes, and I usually prefer to wear a mask… but no need to, in this case.” He looked down to inspect the cleanliness of his glasses before putting them back on his face. “Killing is quite rare, actually. We only kill the ones that discover who we are.” He winked through the lenses, and Sherlock felt a bolt of fear down his back.
There in the distance, through the easing rain, Sherlock could make out the figure of his brother and Greg Lestrade. Mycroft was standing under his ever present umbrella while Greg was down on one knee presenting a ring box. Sherlock could see Mycroft nod yes, enthusiastically. Greg then stood and kissed Mycroft passionately. The two seemed in perfect bliss, the now misty rain creating a lovely fog in the forest. Sherlock found it deplorable and shouted. “I’m telling Mummy!”
John raced back up the path through the trees and into the barn to his work bench. However the length of rope was not there and the John remembered he’d used it to secure the last load of hay when he’d brought it in the truck. He ran out to the truck and looked in the bed, and then in the bench seat and behind the bench, but he still couldn’t find it. He cursed aloud and felt tears of frustration on his face. “Where are you?” he screamed and ran back to the barn to see what else he could use. He passed the cow’s stall and doubled back because he saw the long rope lead that he used to hook to the cow’s halter in the summertime when he moved her between pastures.
Sherlock’s father chuckled. “Yes, that’s right.”
“If only it were that easy,” Mary sighed, as if John had made an appropriate suggestion. “You have to consider the consequences of the mistake I made in making Moriarty the front-man of our little operation. He is, unfortunately, the one with all the connections, all the relationships with the powerful people in our network. If he dies by my hand, what reason will they have to trust me? To follow me? I’ll tell you right now: none. It doesn’t work like that, you can’t stage a coup when no one knows who you are.”

didn’t follow the plan, either.”
of it. She was the first person I’d met since you that I actually connected with, who interested me… and all of a sudden the blood was pounding in my veins again… life was
,” Mycroft spat at Anna, looking at her from his periphery. “I shall deal with you later.”
“A row? And then he kicked you out?”
As if I’d have a chance, against her.”
Meanwhile Sherlock was splashing and the ice around him was breaking as he tried to climb out, and John heard him gasping his breaths as he tried to get enough air in the cold.
“Excuse me?”
“Sherlock… this was a mistake.” His voice was more forceful now. “We shouldn’t have started this in the first place, I see that now, and I take full responsibility, it was completely my fault—“
, she said to herself.
Sherlock reluctantly walked out of the water and set Anna on the beach as the man stopped in front of them. “Fancy seeing you here!” he said, breathless and with a smile. “And how are you, Anna?” he asked her, crouching down. “You’re getting so big!”
“Well, maybe it’s not exactly to the same degree. You’ve always done things in extremes.”
on Anna’s door. “Anna? May I come in?” Sherlock opened the door and found Anna sitting on the bed, her face wet with tears. “I apologize for raising my voice,” he began, walking over and sitting on the edge of the mattress. “Do you forgive me?”
I swallowed now, with John’s lips against my throat, and he let out a heavy breath in response, tightening his one handed grip around the small of my back and pressing the length of his hardening prick against my thigh.
, he thought desperately.
Sherlock replaced his current slide with a new one, still not responding.
“About you and Mum,” she clarified.
“But what I can’t figure out,” continued Moriarty, “is why Mycroft kept up the lie? I’m positive they did a paternity test when they got back to London. They would have found out the truth, that you actually were John’s daughter.” He shook his head. “I’m stumped, I really am. It’s so delightful! How refreshing!” He giggled again. “What is his endgame? Oh Mycroft, you silly, silly man. A man with a plan. What is your plan?"
John sighed. “Just…
you?”
She arrived home after Friday’s practice, humming one of their songs and replaying every detail of the session in her head—especially all of the instances where David’s eyes had met hers—and was so deep in thought that she didn’t look where she was going as she went through the front door. She turned the corner and ran right into Molly Hooper.
“Redbeard could do the best tricks.” His eyes began to water and his bottom lip trembled a bit. He stopped abruptly, shaking his head, and then looked directly into her eyes.
“What do you say Watson, want to be the King to be my Queen” he asked while scooping her up and grinning at John.
Rosie frowned at the dismissal of Mrs. Suresh but shrugged through it. “It’s a bit nippy to play in the garden. Do you know how to play rummy?” Stasha nodded, and they played for a bit before Stasha made a statement about Rosie’s neighbourhood.
Rosie had tears in her eyes, and was once more looking into her lap. “OK.” Her voice was strained and small. She sniffled. “I still don’t understand something though.”
“I’m bad at Maths, will Gran love me less?” Rosie asked as she continued to stare out the window, no longer sipping her juice, but letting the straw ghost her closed lips.

Mycroft placed a mug of hot chocolate, topped with cinnamon and whipped cream, in front of her before sitting down. “Yes well, your fathers don’t see it that way,  nor do I expect them to.  And as for your daddy, we’ve never gotten on. Our relationship only became worse. To be honest I’m very surprised he’s allowed me any role in your life.” He sipped his drink.
Two years later, literally no one was surprised when John moved into his room, leaving Watson the upstairs one. At first the move was honestly just convenience, they had shared hotel beds after all, and the littlest member of the household was becoming not so little. It developed from there. Apparently there had been a bet, Lestrade won, Mycroft was sour for weeks. If Watson had to be harmed by his selfishness, then he’s glad this was the result. The Work accessible and safe, Watson free to roam and grow within absolutely safe boundaries, and he and John. It was always just the two of them against the rest of the world, after all.
“How long have you been standing there?” His voice is raw, and it seems he can barely speak above a whisper, but Lestrade hears him all the same. The D.I. takes this inquiry as permission to enter.
“You know, Nan Hudson sometimes wonders how you can lure Daddy out on your adventures. She also says that’s she proud I have a proper head on my shoulders.” Rosie is grinning too, eyes full of mirth. “Yet here I am, all of seven years old, trapped in an old musty and creaky tree house with my Papa. All because you said ‘Want to go for a hike? There could be treasure’. And honestly I’m my fathers’ daughter.”
Rosie babysits for the first time.
Mycroft sits up straight in surprise and stares at the inspector.
Mycroft covers his eyes with the heel of his hands and leans back. “Inspector" is all he offers in slightly slurred speech. Gregory Lestrade had been dropping in to his office nearly every day since the incident. Mycroft knows his brother had asked the inspector to keep an eye on him but, after another verbal lashing from his mother, he was in no mood for the arrival of his assigned babysitter.
“Can’t help but feel you’re winning on both ends of that, Love.” He craned his neck a bit to go in for  kiss. Only for Mycroft to yank back and smirk down at him.
Mycroft’s attention was once more focused on Greg, his moment of discomfort gone. “Sherlock was banned from this pub when he was 12.” Mycroft gave a slow sly smirk.
Steadier than he was previously, he lifts his head to once more survey the cell. Only to discover he is no longer alone. On the other side of the room, just outside the now open door, is D.I. Lestrade.
Mycroft frowned deeply. “Rosamund, desist immediately. Your godfather has correctly determined the raw poultry bird to be unsafe for playing.” Rosie was undeterred and kept at her shenanigans.
Anna met her eyes for an instant, then turned and flung the treasure into the deep, black sea.
“Just tell me the truth,” Sherlock demanded, shrilly. “Just tell me you don’t really love me.”
Anna balled up her fists and tried as hard as she could to imitate Sherlock’s emotionless stare.
In response, Sherlock stretched his lips up wide in that grotesquely forced smile of his that showed every single one of his teeth.
he thought.
He closed his eyes.
“No, I didn’t. I put it off and put it off, and then I really asked myself why I was putting it off, and I didn’t know the answer, or want to. But eight months later, I was in labour in the hospital, and I phoned your father, and I said, ‘Do you still want to have a family with me?’ I hadn’t talked to him in months but he didn’t miss a beat. He said, ‘Of course I do,’ and I said, and I quote, ‘Well, I’m at the hospital. Come on and get it.'
John swallowed. No, he hadn’t. He knew she would say no, absolutely no, no way Sherlock Holmes was going to stay with them for a whole week and certainly no way he was going to bring dangerous experiments into her home. The baby
Bullets pelted down from above, and Sherlock’s shout of “Down! Climb down!” pulled them both back to reality. Anna whipped around and hurried down the stairs, all the way to the bottom, John and Sherlock half a step behind her.
, that’s how. Ordinary people aren’t half as clever, or intelligent, or…” he trailed off.
, who waste any potential for greatness that they ever had, on sentiment.”
John sighed. “Yes, but—“
“Nonsense, John, of course you can. We’ll start early, leave the flat around—“
John thought to himself,
Sherlock turned to them, the remains of his delight still on his face. “Oh, nothing,” he said, struggling to control his expression. “Just that Mummy has been complaining about Daddy’s weight, and Daddy isn’t allowed biscuits anymore, but she’s seen him sneak them from the tin he’s hidden under her crib.” Sherlock’s eyes sparkled. “Apparently, Daddy told her not to tell Mummy, that it was their little secret.”
,” he’d instructed, almost as if he expected it to happen, and turned to pick up his umbrella before walking out of the flat without waiting for confirmation.
“’Talk?’” Sherlock hated when people used those sorts of pet names for things. “What talk?”
worried.”
John furrowed his brow at the phone. “Yes…”
. He crossed the street and went up to the house that Sherlock had supposedly gone to visit the morning before.
“Well, the unofficial diagnosis is that she killed herself. You know, she was there for nearly a week in that basement—raped, beaten, starved too, probably—if that doesn’t fuck with your mind, I don’t know…”
that I’m not actually dead.”
Another new year was beginning.
“Please,” John had stared him right in the eye. “The world needs Sherlock Holmes. It does not need me.”
I sighed. “Of course I’m attracted to you,” I repeated. I was. Or I had been. That one time. It wasn’t a lie, exactly. “I’m just...” I sought for the right words to pacify him. I knew I couldn’t avoid the topic forever, but maybe just a bit longer... “Afraid,” I finished.
“Yes,” Sherlock breathes.
Molly closed her lips, twisting them to one side the way she was want to do. “Just… you don’t have to explain anything to me. I
The problem was, I didn’t exactly know. Being “with” John was something I wanted, but it turned out that he and I had very different definitions of what that meant. Well, that’s not quite true. In the beginning it meant the same thing—the beginning, when we’d got trapped in that basement with the water coming in through all the windows and we thought we were going to die. The beginning, when being “with” John meant his hot mouth on mine and our fists full of the back of each other’s jackets. It was desperate and close, a desire to live, to experience life in a primal way that I usually abhorred. It was a revelation, no, a breakthrough. I was emotional. I was sexual. I was human.
Sherlock thought,
But Sherlock didn’t seem to hear her. He was too focused on the boy, who was trying to put on his t-shirt and ended up sticking his arm through the neck hole, twisting it and getting tangled. In one giant movement Sherlock was in front of him, grabbing the t-shirt, pulling the boy’s head down and slamming it to the top of the dresser. He recognized the boy as one of the members of Anna’s band.
Sherlock eventually left and John closed the curtain again, turning up the heat of the water and shutting his eyes. He stood like that for a long while, just letting the water run over his head and down his shoulders, before finally picking up the soap and washing the residue of the blood from his skin.
idea, the gum. She put the screws just inside the duct and started moving carefully into the passageway.
“Anna?”
“I...” I started, unsure of what to say. I wanted to impress him, more than anything, because I knew it got him hot, and then we’d at least be even. But all thoughts of the case had vanished in an instant. “Just give me a moment.” I moved away from him and walked round to the other side of the body. I crouched down, examining the finger-shaped bruises on the throat.
. Yet, he could help thinking… if anyone could decipher baby-speak, it would be Sherlock Holmes.
Moriarty began to smile. “And he assumed you got that from me?”
: to speak with my baby brother about what’s going on in his life.”
,” he said into his pillow, imagining John’s free hand gripping the base of his neck, his thighs keeping Sherlock’s trapped against the counter as he stroked him faster, tightly, and then John forcing him into a sloppy kiss, mouths opened and tongues wet against each other, then Sherlock’s head in John’s shoulder, John whispering in his ear, “Come for me. I want to see you come. I want to
“I believe I hear tea brewing,” said Anna, as the sound of the hot kettle whistled down the hall.
“So, you’re the infamous Sherlock Holmes,” Ella greeted him, smiling as she came into the room.
John’s stomach lurched with anticipation.
“Well, you’re very much welcome to stay here,” she said again, firmly. “In fact, I insist.”
Sherlock felt a rage boil inside of him so suddenly that for a moment he thought he might pass out. But he didn’t. Instead, he stood there, watching them in shock. They hadn’t heard him come in; they were oblivious.
. What you said, before, the story about uni. It wasn’t about me.”
“He was upset,” she went on. “And afraid. We’d just found out that Anna’s life was in danger, and he was frustrated because he couldn’t figure it out, what they were planning… I think he was sort of grasping out for something, anything really, to make himself feel less lost. And I went with it, because, well,” she smiled a little, looking guiltily at John, “you know.”
“Precisely.” Sherlock sat back, as if this answered everything. John took another breath, but stopped, still confused. “Keep going, John, come on. She wanted to steal the key from the British government. Why ever would she think that we would help her with that?”
“I am most certainly not—“ he haughtily began, but stopped once he caught sight of Sherlock’s expression. “You can’t be serious?
“I’m not jealous,” Sherlock lied. “I’m just upset that I’ll have to spend Christmas with Mycroft.”
Sherlock wondered if he should be worried. He was secretly proud of her for figuring out how to do that—she was only five, after all—but he wondered if this was normal behavior. He looked over to where Lestrade’s girls were standing, the youngest still crying. All of them looked shocked at Anna’s actions.
Anna and Molly didn’t return home until very late, and when they did, they found Sherlock playing violin. “Sherlock!” scolded Molly. “It’s nearly midnight, you’ll wake the whole street!”
When Anna was younger, she’d had these wild fantasies about Sherlock and Molly getting married. She’d even attempted, on a few occasions, to set them up. Once, when she knew Molly was coming over for dinner, she’d lit some candles on the table and when Molly arrived made an excuse to leave: Mrs. Hudson needed her to read something to her, she was blind as a bat! Of course Sherlock, as obtuse as ever, yelled down the stairs for Mrs. Hudson; and when Mrs. Hudson tottered up to the second floor and had no idea of any plans for Anna to visit her that evening and said her eyes were perfectly fine (as long as she had her spectacles), Anna was sent to her room for lying. She was nine, at the time.
his daughter, Anna, don’t just play the role. It will be the only way that you’ll survive.”
“Yes,” John replied. He was going to come soon. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d come just from clothed stimulation. But then again he couldn’t remember the last time he’d come at all. He’d masturbated few times during his four years in the woods but those were only middle of the night wanks between REM cycles where he wasn’t really awake enough to care about the fact that he just couldn’t enjoy that sort of physical pleasure anymore.
Sherlock felt plenty bad enough.
By the time she was ten, she’d tired of the lies. She’d tired of making fun of others and being made fun of herself; she just wanted to leave it all untouched. It was so much easier to just not interact with people. Instead she focused on homework and music and fiddle and, if she needed companionship, she’d go to Sherlock, or Mrs. Hudson, or Molly. That was enough, for her.
Sherlock watched the way John looked after the child, concern and adoration written in his features, an unsettledness about him, too; he wanted to hold her again, have her back in his arms. She was barely ten hours old, but he already loved her.
Ella ignored his combative tone. “No,” she said, patiently, “I think grief can make us do funny things, and I think combining grief with the judgment-clouding effects of alcohol is a poor idea.”
, thought Anna.
The other man twisted his lips into a wry smile. “I’m going to see my brother."
“Major,” he greeted, nonchalantly.
Sherlock smiled knowingly. “The flash drive.”
, Sherlock thought,
“But of course you can stay,” Molly interrupted. She didn’t know where the answer had come from, but it came out before she could stop it. Perhaps because Sherlock had kicked him out, she’d suddenly felt a little sympathetic.
Mary gave him a look. “Surprisingly? What, am I not adorable?”
Anna sat, alone now and tied to a chair, tears rolling off of her cheeks and down her chin, dripping onto the front of her shirt as her head hung low. It was awful, this waiting. It was quite possibly the worst part. She didn’t know what Moriarty planned to do, but whatever it was, it would be grotesque, and vicious, and deadly. And inevitable.
“The flash drive.” John choked out, hollowly. “She gave me that bloody flash drive, with her whole life’s story on it, and I threw it in the sodding fire.” He let his head fall forward into the wall with a
want to talk.
Sherlock wrenched the coat off John’s shoulders and dropped it on the floor with a flourish of fingers. He cocked his head to one side, considering how to proceed. Then he began to work on John’s shirt buttons. John kept talking, but he didn’t try to stop him.
There was nothing that convinced Molly that Anna was their best bet in bringing down Moriarty. Perhaps Anna
Because of the nature of John’s death and the length of time it took the forensics team to investigate, it was almost three weeks before John was officially “pronounced” dead. Sherlock remembered when Mycroft rang to tell him: he was holding Anna in the kitchen, she was crying, he was testing the heated formula on his wrist the way Mrs. Hudson had showed him, still unsure what was too hot and what was too cold—“It has to be body-temperature Sherlock, just imagine it came right out of a woman’s breast!” “I’d rather not, Mrs. Hudson.”—and had somehow found and extra hand to pick up the phone.
“No,” confirmed Mycroft. He looked thoughtful for a moment. “I suppose he said it because he wanted to hurt John just a little more, but it was completely untrue; we did a paternity test after the fact to prove it. Yet when I saw the results of that test, that John was actually Anna’s father, I had a decision to make.
“Fine,” I sighed, then stopped.
“Beat him to death,” Moriarty commanded. “The old-fashioned way.”
“He’ll be fine, the wound was not deep. But next time, let’s try not to kill the help,” Mycroft reprimanded, slyly.
If Anna were to imagine the most unfair thing possible, it would be this exact moment: she’d finally had a father,
Sherlock gave Anna a few more moments to process, then bent his head to catch her eye. “So? What do you say? Will you go with me?”
“It’s not the same,” said John, and for the first time in a while, he looked at Sherlock with pity. “I know you don’t understand, because you haven’t been with someone before, but—“
, I meant my
“Shut the hell up,” Anna replied, her nostrils flaring.
“Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock said, from the viewfinder, “you’d better go and bake us some more biscuits.”
She took off her apron and sat down next to me, smoothing out the wrinkles of her blouse. She folded her hands in her lap and sighed. “I’ve never told either of you kids this, but I didn’t plan on becoming pregnant.”
“Does it matter?” Anna challenged.
Anna giggled. “I’ll rub it in,” she promised. Then, suddenly, she sprang off the blanket and ran.
of questioning was sufficient—“
He could try to keep it private. A private feeling, stowed away, compartmentalized unless he really needed it… for moments like this. For moments when he needed relief and couldn’t get it just by touching himself, for moments when he needed his imagination to help stimulate him to climax. Those moments didn’t happen very often, anyway. He could pull out the thought, indulge in it for a short time until he got off, and then he could put it away, hide it deep in his mind palace for next time. Yes, he could do that.
He needed to get out of the warmth, abscond his nakedness, and distract his mind with something else. He sat up and unplugged the drain, then stood to reach for a towel.
“And it felt like ten,” Anna said. Sherlock gave her a look, and she scowled. “The snow makes it
,” John exhaled, unable to stop himself. Sherlock’s breath quickened, his torso expanding and contracting rapidly as John’s eyes moved down to—
Sherlock peered at her through the glass. “It wasn’t a waste, Mary. Anna came from it—it could never be a waste.”
“Come, Anna,” he said, straightening up and thrusting his hands into his pockets. “We’re going for a stroll.”
So there he was, sitting awkwardly in a chair that was much too small for him, Anna next to him whispering back to her classmate. “Yes,” she said, too low for Sherlock to hear—she would have been corrected and scolded for lying, if he had, but sometimes it was much less awkward just to lie than explain the truth.
Anna spun around, and Sherlock looked up. His heart stopped beating.
“Hello, dear,” replied the landlady, smiling. She went over to Anna, moving much slower in her old age. “And what have you got there, love?”
Sherlock looked over at her.
reason that he was kept alive and then released. “Yes,” he answered.
reckless, and needed to be, to solve crimes. But he couldn’t do that, not alone, not with the fear of being injured or killed drumming about in his head.
“She was a complete moron, that’s how,” Sherlock spat, and John snorted out another laugh. “Well, she was! Put the rug back the wrong way round. Can you believe that, John?” Sherlock leaned forward over the coffee table, his drink dangling in his hand. “Picked up the whole bloody rug just to shove one measly envelope underneath! I mean, all she had to do was just lift up the corner,” he mimed it in the air, “and slip it in! How can people be such
The ride home was silent, as John promised. Although I wasn’t thinking about how to figure love into my life like he wanted me to. The Work and love just didn’t mix. Like oil and water, they didn’t blend. I couldn’t have it both ways, even though I wanted to, and John wanted to. Sometimes it doesn’t matter how much you want something.
When John got to the front door, he heard his name from down the road.
Sherlock immediately began to inspect all of the furniture and trinkets, the magazines, the books on the shelves…
I took a few steps toward him.
“Of course I remember,” said Sherlock. “And why is
.” He almost did, because sod duty, sod responsibility. If he wanted to live his life as a confirmed bachelor with his sociopathic best friend (who, was, at the moment, completely reversing that diagnosis), why couldn’t he well do it?
I didn’t really like it. Sex, I mean. I’d never really liked anything about it, except maybe the beginning, before it was actually had, the
“Well, I—“ John started, but suddenly the words caught up with him. “What’s wrong with my faces?”
“Good start. What else?” prompted Mycroft.
“Sherlock.”
. Though I rather detest the use of the word “giddy” in reference to myself, I believe the definition is most accurate for the circumstances: “disorienting and alarming, but exciting.”
Instead Sherlock smiled slightly. “Correct. Now look at the tattoo under his right ear.”
Sherlock shrugged. “Is there anything still there that you want? If so, I’d suggest you collect it. Then call UrPlace and give them the address. They’ll send a truck and people to haul things. If you prefer, I can arrange to have Wiggins meet them with the key. Give him a chance to catch up with some friends, so to speak.”
“Also, getting impatient.”
Something flew out of the darkness. He caught it on pure reflex, then looked at it.  A travel-sized bottle of mouthwash.
Mary looked sceptical. “You’re making the child sound like a sort of vampire, feeding off the mother’s blood.”
John sniffed the corpse’s mouth.  There was something there – something acrid? – but it was faint and gone almost as soon as he noticed it.  “No scent of alcohol.  Drugs are a possibility.”
All this without a breath taken, while John continued to stand in the doorway.  “Er, may I come in?”
John relaxed and nodded. “Yeah, okay. Are William and Scott people you know or just names you like?”
“It’s too bad, that’s what it is,” opined another one.  George?  “’Cause it means you don’t remember the posh junky.”
Sherlock handed him a piece of paper.  “You have a certificate to carry it.”
“As will Lestrade and his team. Curran’s involvement was sufficient to pique their interest.”
“Not that I know of.”
“And good luck with your date tonight!” John gave the younger man a grin as he stood up to go.
Sherlock didn’t look up from his microscope.
“Then why
“Well, I’m an accountant!”
Carefully, John unfastened Sherlock’s trousers and drew them off, along with Sherlock’s pants and socks. Then he placed one steadying hand on Sherlock’s hip and leaned down to taste. Several things happened at once. Sherlock gasped, his hips tried to buck upwards and something hit John on the underside of his chin.
John grinned. “Impatient, are we?”  But he pulled the garments down around Sherlock’s ankles.  He pressed a kiss on the inside of Sherlock’s upper thigh and then considered the cock in front of his face, the blood red glans already emerging from the foreskin.  To be honest, it seemed larger from this angle than it had when he’d given Sherlock hand jobs.  But John had invaded Afghanistan.  He wasn’t about to back down now.
“Inquiries about the blood of juvenile sheep are fine,” Sherlock added in a matter-of-fact tone.
“A hyperplasic placenta,” Sherlock replied.
The guards had been nothing more than animated wood.  The spell which had given them a sort of life had now been broken.  Sherlock’s work, Ivan guessed.  But the alarm meant that Sherlock had also caught Muircheartaigh’s attention and would need help.  Ivan started towards the keep, only to stumble again and almost fall, his vision darkening even further.  He bent forward and braced his hands against his thighs, feeling dizzy and weak.  This might, he realized, be the end.
see it, of course, at least not in any detail, because he was still standing some feet in front of the gates.
“The woman who helped you?”
likes that idea.”
Tyuleneva looked puzzled, but nodded.  “She sent us to get you if you survived.”
“Damn. That would have only made Sherlock more determined to pursue it. What about the other case? What happened during the meeting?”
Ivan began to tear pieces off one of the loaves and hand them out.  “Easy, easy now.  Chew it thoroughly.  There’s plenty more.”
Ivan woke early, while it was still dark.  He dressed carefully in a clean shirt and trousers, but left aside his surcoat and sword, for he would not be travelling far.  He retrieved the case with Sherlock’s heart and feathers from his saddlebags.  When he went down to the kitchen, Marfa Hudovna was already at the stove.
“Father, we don’t know that there’s a curse, it could all just be a coincidence of events.  And Harrieta doesn’t need to marry someone of royal or noble blood, she just needs to marry.”
In the morning, his soiled trousers were still there, his sword was still there, his horse and the remains of last night’s campfire were still there.  So was the meadow, green and untouched except where Bezimyan had grazed.  Ivan washed himself and his trousers in the stream, waited until the cloth had more or less dried in the sun, then mounted up and went on his way, east and a bit north along the road.
Wentworth appeared on the pavement supporting Campbell-Williams, who seemed to be on the verge of passing out. When a black cab pulled up to the curb, he more or less dragged her towards it.  The drunken, elderly man pried himself off the wall he was leaning on.
“And perhaps the sort of person who’d be willing to marry a partly crippled ex-soldier wouldn’t mind finding out that instead they’d married a possibly cursed tsarevich,” Ivan offered.  “If there
Christ, John was so distracted he hadn’t heard Janine leave the bathroom, let alone enter and exit the bedroom. She must have, though, for she was now wearing a flowered dress and white jumper.
John sat alone in the bright flat, which was still almost clean at that point despite the days of Mary’s absence. He didn’t think about Mycroft providing identification for a woman Mycroft had met exactly twice, once at his parent’s house for Christmas and once, briefly, on an airstrip.  John didn’t think about whether or not it had been Mycroft’s people who’d taken Mary down in the end.  It didn’t matter.  It was always going to happen.  John had just never thought about it, and he wasn’t going to start now.
“Mr Holmes, Dr Watson. Please come in, be seated.”  Foucault was a soft-spoken man, his French accent worn thin after years in the UK.  His office was chock full of books and papers, but very neatly kept.  The only personal touches were a brightly coloured mug and a small, framed photo on his desk.
“I’m sure it has, dear,” said Marfa Hudovna, with a smile that led Ivan to suspect that she might actually know very well.
Ivan started to say yes, of course, but something made him stop and think.  He had been happy as a child, playing with Harrieta under their nursemaids’ watchful eyes.  He had been happy as a youth – he’d enjoyed his studies and done well at them.  He had been happy to dance at his sister’s wedding, even happier to leave court for the army.  He’d been happy with his men amidst the southern mountains.
“Great, fantastic! Thanks for the reminder – except I didn’t need to hear it from you because Molly already delivered it! Did you

“Sherlock, don’t be like that. This
“Yeah, but I handle the mushy solids and soft finger foods. She’s a pretty adventurous eater. Every now and then she gets a bit...”
Until.
,” she’d said back at Christmas.
They left David staring after them, rubbing his hand.  Sherlock’s grasp had been perhaps somewhat more firm than necessary.
Sherlock blanched. “I’d prefer we didn’t discuss my testicles, thank you.”
Mycroft had stopped by the second day, when the worst was already over. Sherlock didn’t know how he’d heard so quickly; had a sneaking suspicion that John had contacted him out of some warped concern for Sherlock’s wellbeing.
We caught him in an apple orchard just outside of the city, and spent the better part of twenty minutes chasing him and dodging his throws—two of which nearly decapitated me. John finally got him in the back of the leg with a shot from his gun, snapping his hamstring and causing him to shriek in pain while falling to the ground. John stood over him with the gun pointed between his eyes and proceeded to make calm but chilling threats about what he felt like doing to people who threw sharp objects at his “boyfriend.” He was sweating on his forehead and next to his ears so that the hair there was dark and damp, and his breath was coming out in bursts of fog, and his hand was perfectly steady as he spoke and cocked his gun in the man’s face like it was nothing. Scotland Yard showed up directly after and we went home in a taxi, laughing and chattering breathlessly.
“Thank you,” said Sherlock and stepped into the bathroom and closed the door.
babies.” Mycroft stuck his nose in the air.
“So? What do you think?” he asked the sky. “You think Mycroft is right? Do you think that Anna can do this? Or should I go after her?”
, Molly.”
“Can I see my Daddy?” she asked, in her little-girl voice. She blew a bubble with the chewing gum in her mouth.
“I know, you idiot,” John said. “It was a joke.”
He walked over to the table to replace the scepter and pick up the crown.
“Molly,” Sherlock began. “I—“
“You did that to go after Moriarty’s network,” John told him, his voice shrill. “Jumped, I mean. Faked your death. So they wouldn’t see you coming.”
The band had been his idea—she loved music and played the fiddle (all those lessons Sherlock forced on her would finally pay off), so it would be a much easier transition into a lie than “Science Club.”
“I,” Sherlock’s father corrected, smiling at his wife, “I thought it would be good for him to have a pet. You know, something to cuddle, to love.”
And then Sherlock did a curious thing. He unbuttoned his lab coat and his dress shirt, and began to lift up his vest to reveal his bare skin beneath. “Sherlock…” Molly began.
