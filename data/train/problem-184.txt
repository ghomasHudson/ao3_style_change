“Really?”
He was momentarily frightened the waiter was going to say something to their manager, but his worries were appeased when the waiter just shrugged and turned away as a way to say, ‘I don’t get paid enough for this job to really care.’
"No, no she didn't. Was she supposed to?"
Sherlock gives John a small smile, “Yes. Yes, I do.”
He walks up the few stairs and reaches into his pockets in pure routine, surprised to find a small key still in his pocket; still there after the chaos of the last few days. The keys to 221B Baker Street.
the Christmas dinners?”
“Yes…? That
They both sit and stand in silence.
“Of course.”
John mentally facepalmed and nodded as he remembered all those years ago when he had first met Sherlock at St. Bart’s. Now that he remembered the date of it, he could never forget it. Reaching up to peck Sherlock on the cheek, he whispered in his ear,”That’s so sweet you remembered.“
John quietly sneaks down from Rosie’s room upstairs and joins Sherlock in the living room again. He sits down on his chair and takes the cup of mulled cider that Sherlock offers him from his spot in front of the window.
“No. What is she?”
----------------------
“Then we’ll take what comes. I know you might never really get over your old soulmate, and as long as you can understand that I might not ever get over mine,” John nods, “then who cares if we’re not ‘soulmates, soulmates?’”
"Sorry, sorry," he muttered apologetically while he stacked the glasses again and looked up.
But it should be.
Sherlock stares at him in confusion for a bit, “Christmas? Why would I do anything for Christmas? I’m not religious.”
“We need a time” William added, “how about midnight?”
Once the cab arrived, he threw some money he hoped was enough and legged it to his office, pushing past people here and there. If you asked him why he had run in the middle of the hallway instead of against the wall so he could avoid hitting people, he would tell you to piss off but would take your advice. Unfortunately, you were not there to tell him this, so he did run into someone.
Cold.
Lestrade nodded in understanding, "So in the end, it was all about revenge?"
“Hey, John!”
It had been a perfectly perfect Thursday. The sky was blue, the birds were chirping, Mrs. Hudson was baking, and John was sleeping peacefully.
“It had too many sleepless
Sorry for the weird metaphors...
patient, it makes John want to scream himself hoarse. To scream until he doesn’t think of anything else.
John grabs Sherlock’s cracker with different his right hand, and with Sherlock, he pulls.
“Good evening.”
John sits in his chair and reads the newspaper, as Sherlock play the violin in front of the window.
Lestrade shrugged, “Maybe he didn’t want you to know?”
A few minutes passed in comfortable silence, whilst the two of them finished their tea. John shifting Rosie on his lap every few seconds.
Sherlock shook his head again, “No. Ever since we repaired this flat, I’ve bolted the windows.”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Sherlock looks bewildered.
"Should I?"
After they were pleasantly full with pasta, they had both retreated to the couch, cuddling as
“In what way?”
And Irene, who had been spying on the boys was happy too.
John smiles grimly, “No clever comeback?”
"Can I ask you something?"
The walls were a simple white, and the foyer was lit with a dimmed, tremendous chandelier that must've cost thousands and thousands of pounds. The staircase that winded up on both sides was a lush coffee-colored color, and the draped windows at the top let a few rays of sunlight fill the room, giving it a calmer atmosphere. He could hear the hushed voice of a receptionist conversing with guests and the small clatter of silverware. Suddenly he felt self-conscious in his -rather cheap- suit and ran a hand through his unkempt, brown, hair.
Wait, riding crop, mortuary- what was he getting himself into?
John holds out a dotted red Christmas cracker to Rosie, “So, you know what to do. Right?”
The name clicked in his brain; he had seen the name in the case file Sherlock had thrust in his face only last night. (A triple homicide, Sherlock had been thrilled.) But Howard Mossle wasn’t a victim… no, he wasn’t. In fact, Sherlock had been yelling over the phone with Lestrade about how Howard Mossle was the murderer.
“My- my,” John motioned uselessly to his left hand, “-you know. The fact that I’ve- we’re not-”
Sherlock watched as John brandished a package from behind himself and gave it to Sherlock.
“Are you doing anything?”
"I don't. But if I had to guess, I would say, for a long time."
"Yes, Sherlock?"
“I know. It’s just- what if this…”
“Oh my god.”
Sherlock furiously shook his head, as if that would make the thought disappear. He couldn't-wouldn't- think about it.
He took a deep breath and clenched his fists.
Slipping into the bed with a blissed-out and more-than-satisfied John, they lay next to each other in post-orgasmic bliss; Sherlock whispering sweet nothings into John's hair. He bent his head down to John's ear,
"Oh, the horror."
It triggers an awareness in John. Everything that Sherlock had been doing, while it seemed selfish, or manipulative on the surface, it was just Sherlock trying to help him. It gave John an inner look into Sherlock’s heart. It suddenly makes John feel like an arsehole. All along Sherlock had been helping and he’d been constantly accusing him and belittling him.
"It most definitely did." Sherlock's thought process was racing. After months, even years, of pining hopelessly after John, finally, finally, his heart was put to rest.
When they parted, they were both panting. Sherlock smiled, "Really John? French?" he mock teased.
“It’s been a while, but I’m sure I can remember it.”
They waded far into the ocean. Far away from everyone else. Where it was just the two of them. Together. And just when Sherlock couldn’t reach the seabed, he arched his back and let himself float onto his back; peering to the left to see that John had done the same thing. He breathed in the salty, warm air and let his dark curls soak into the cool water.
The lady's face filled with fright and glanced around nervously before looking at her computer, "Alright, he's in the room 726 on level B. But don't tell anyone I allowed you to visit; I could get fired."
John looked around and crinkled his nose as a smell hit him. It smelled like old grapes, yeast, and a sewer all mixed up in a horrible concoction.
“He only adopted that kind of thinking about five-ish years ago.”
“That doesn’t even mean anything.”
“Oh yeah, right!” John grabbed his green crown and balanced it on his head, “do you wanna do jokes again?”
She nods gleefully, “When Sher’rock comes in, we say ‘Happy Christmas!’”
"It's more than that Sherlock."
He stands in front of Sherlock's coffin and skims his fingers across the top of it. The wooden lid is smooth and cold.
He managed to make out that all the furniture was still gone, but the couch had been returned to its place against the wall, and all the clutter of Sherlock’s papers were gone. Stepping cautiously forward to investigate the room, he felt something soft under his feet and stopped. He looked down to see a cluster of rose petals that extended into a messy, rosy line, leading into the kitchen.
Sherlock threw on his coat and made his way to the door, "I'm going."
It was 9 PM by the time John had finished shopping at Tesco and came back to 221B. Trudging up the stairs with his “groceries” he flung the door open to 221B, only to find that the lights were turned off. John flicked the lights and gaped at the sight.
William smirked, "Look here Holmes. I've heard of you, and I haven't heard of you breaking any promises."
“I hate you.”
They settled back into silence until, suddenly, they were encompassed in darkness. All the lights had abruptly been flicked off, and the minimal light from the moon was their only source of light.
John gently took the package and cautiously began to unwrap the shiny gold wrapping off of it. Inside, there was a silver box, and they both took the lid off. Inside, there was a golden, magnificent picture frame, with a small note set on it. They read it:
”7? Wait, I was at Tesco at 7…“ John paused for a few seconds as Sherlock waited for everything to click, ”That’s why you told me to go all away across London? So you had time to pre-prepare things?“
When night falls, John holds the
John laughs and shakes his head, “No, we’ve had a scan. We’re pretty sure it’s a girl.”
“-sentimental.” Sherlock completed.
He collapses against the back of the cab back seat. No, he can't think about that right now. What he has to think about is his just going back to Baker Street and getting a few of Sherlock’s things.
“So; Sherlock’s going to his parents for Christmas huh?” Lestrade laughs and takes a sip of his pint, “Never thought I’d see the day when the twat actually celebrated.”
"Yes, that would be me," John nodded in agreement, "and just John, please."
"She seems like quite a bit of fun," John remarked, still gazing at the still-swinging door.
Lestrade sighed, "He was found unconscious and was sent to the nearest A&E about two hours ago. He has several broken bones-"
Mary smirked, "Oh is it real-"
Check me out at
John nodded, “South London actually.”
John looked at him, perplexed, in the end deciding to turn back to get ready for his work. He stretched his arms and his left shoulder protested angrily, immediately reminding John of the events of the day before. Including pinning a patient to the wall, and almost getting fired. He groaned, he really had to apologize to Elise for that.
His twenty-five-minute lunch break, in fact, was sadly not even twenty-five minutes. His lunch break was ten minutes since Sarah wanted to introduce John to a brown-haired, man; a new GP from America. It had been filled with awkward introductions and pleasant conversation between the two men. Therefore, when John had walked back to his office to see a new patient, he was in a lighter mood and ready to finish the day with a lighter tone.
"Interesting," the man took another sip, "anything else?"
John smiles sadly, “That’s only the beginning, mate.”
“Shut up!”
He groaned as he sipped a cup of now cold tea and looked out the window at the pouring rain; like it would help him find out where John was. Or as if John would pass by the window and come back to 221B. But alas, that didn't work.
Je t'aime. -JW
"Mmm,' he gave John a hum of -what John hoped to be- satisfaction, "it tastes different. A bit sweeter than usual gin martinis."
The waiter sat down his food, “.دلته ستاسو خواړه ده”
Sherlock snapped his eyes open and gasped.
Where the hell is he?
What made that day so great was the fact that Elise had apologized for yelling at him, the American GP that he had met the day before had become incredibly invested in the cases Sherlock and John had solved, the person who had permanently stained his shirt with coffee had gotten him a new shirt, and people kept passing by and smiling at him.
Sherlock followed John’s eyes and saw a gold, shiny wrapped box under the tree, that hadn’t been there before, “I… don’t know.”
He smiles down at the photo on his phone and promptly runs out of the room.
again.
-------------
He sighed and sat back down in his armchair. If he had known wrapping Christmas presents was going to take a ridiculous amount of wrapping paper, maybe he wouldn't have decided to wrap his Christmas presents. In fact, he did know, but he had still wanted to wrap his presents. No matter how much of a trouble it was for him. And there was only one person to blame.
"Really? You didn't have to Sherlock."
He can tell he’s trapped in a small enclosed area. And with what he can tell, he might be in a cell. Or something, as he can see tiny slits of light in his space.
John meets a woman. She just started working at the clinic less than a month ago and is sweet, funny, witty, polite, and very respectable. She’s everything Sherlock was not. Sherlock was everything she isn’t.
He needed to go back to John.
“No.”
His life keeps collapsing right in front of his eyes. Just as he thinks he has a grasp on it, it slips from between his fingers, like grains of sand.
“In a way.”
John stared in shock, “How did I not know this?”
John smiles at the gesture and for a moment he remembers a wisp of ginger hair, an American accent, a pale face, and a lanky body.
But there was one more unexpected thing John Watson did.
”Your shoulder has been hurting.“
Sherlock raises his eyebrow, “We’re doing two at the same time?”
“I… don’t. But you’re the one who told me about it. Six years ago.”
That was until John had woken up alone in Sherlock and John’s bed.
to our team.”
He facepalmed and groaned. The sky -like sensing his mood- lit up with lightning and growled with thunder. It was a mere few seconds later that rain started to pour from the clouds, soaking John and his clothes within seconds. Angrily cursing his luck, he went to the nearest pub. There was no way he was going back in that rain. Walking in and sitting at the empty bar. Not being too much of a day drinker, but also needing a drink after almost getting fired, he settled with a pint of beer. He verbalized his order and looked out the foggy windows in the back of the building, into the pounding rain.
"Who was the assailant?"
“Hard! Rough! O-oh god, anything, just fuck me! Please!” He couldn't help the whine that left his throat and whimpered at how Sherlock moaned. He was being overwhelmed by pleasure and could almost taste his release.
“Mhmm! It makes noise!”
Lestrade scrambled to catch up with him, "What else?"
“You can’t just-”
a bad cabbie. Should have seen the route he took us to get here!”
"Where is he?"
And Howard Mossle still hadn’t been arrested.
He coughs; the air seems to be thicker, like if there’s smoke filling up the air.
“What the hell are you talking about?! You tryin’ to get me framed? Well, let me tell you, you little shit, that I’m innocent, and that you should let go of me before I call the police on you.”
“Yay!” Rosie ran back to the living room couch and climbed on.
“What the hell was that?”
Sherlock cocked his eyebrow, "It was that easy? What was he, an idiot?"
“Sherlock is actually a girl’s name.”
John placed the medium sized box from under the small Christmas tree in front of her. It had little candy canes on the wrapping paper and was labelled, “To: Rosie, From: Santa.” The wrapping paper was exactly 8’ by 12’. It had been under the small tree for two weeks now. Sherlock should know. He and John had chosen and wrapped Rosie’s gift from “Santa.”
Sherlock glared at Lestrade and kept quite.
He went to the living room to see Sherlock sitting up on the floor, smiling up at John silently.
With a deep breath and a clench of his one free hand to ease his nerves, he pushed open the door to the grand hotel.
“No,” John picks up his newspaper again, “I just thought you should know.”
John furrowed his eyebrows and brought a calloused hand to Sherlock's cheek, concern on his face,"Is everything ok love?"
Sherlock frowns, “Mary? How so?”
Sherlock puts down his violin to rosin his bow, “For what?”
The not-red-head-but-red-headed man nodded with a thoughtful frown, “Yes, that would be. But when? And where?”
When they exited the building, Sherlock hailed a cab for him and Lestrade to go to the A&E and visit John. Once they arrived, Sherlock walked out leaving Lestrade to pay the cab driver and entered the building. Apparently, someone, (most likely Mycroft) had informed the employees and nursed about their arrival and Sherlock and Lestrade were allowed to visit John with no implications.
“Well then, William. I really can’t say my name either, as I’m technically not supposed to be here,” William raised an eyebrow in amusement, “but it's nice to meet you.” John slipped off the glove of his right hand and extended his arm out to William to shake.
“Oh, god,” John rubbed his face, “What the hell do we do now?”
“Because that’s where
“You didn’t kill Mary.”
Somehow, John knows this is definitely the last time he will ever talk to Sherlock.
“Well, you have just killed a man.”
“The City at Night.”
But when? When would John come back? And why was John so mad when he left? Did Sherlock really push John past the limit this time?
It’s a rare happening, John saying that little three-word phrase. He’s only said it once before, and he knows that Sherlock knows because he immediately stills. John is momentarily worried, but then Sherlock just smiles.
“So, here we are.”
John was about to ask why they had a tour guide, but he realized the silliness it and kept walking. They took a left and turned around the corner to a black door with a gold "Storage Room" sign stuck to the middle. Molly scanned her ID and let them in.
Sherlock held his breath. What did John know?
“I'd rather have a funny little brain and a big heart than a massive brain and no heart at all.”
behind him, but never turned around. He approached the coffin, intent upon his task.
“Oh, this was all rather touching, Sherlock. Who would've thought.”
John got in the car, albeit grumpily. What – or rather whom – he spotted when he got in, made him nearly choke on his next words. Next to Mycroft sat the last person he was expecting to see.
about him.”

It was so like John to see the good in what Molly did. Sherlock had to smile before he spoke.
“And that's exactly why I think this is too easy.”
“Of course not. But this

. Maybe it has always been, since the day I met you. But it feels so fragile that I don't dare speaking about it.”
to make a sappy confession, remember?”
. John made a disgusted face and retrieved it from Sherlock's coat.
Sherlock's tone was even, but John could see right through it. Sherlock was highly irritated. He had tried to build up some kind of relationship to his sister these past few weeks, attempting to make up for a lifetime of lost opportunities, and now … this. It seemed that,
His eyes opened comically and he looked up at John, who was staring at Sherlock intensively, trying to gauge Sherlock's reaction. He looked back down at his phone and tried to still his trembling fingers.
Sherlock doesn’t speak.
Sherlock gesticulated in frustration, “The case was about a baseball coach luring a group of unaware red-headed players into participating in a plot to distract from a bank robbery!”
“You know that’s not what I mean.”
“Oh come on!” John teases, “I think it might look good on you!”
——————————————————
John wearily sat down in his chair. After a morning of treating a woman who thought she broke her ankle, (but it was just a sprain) a boy with the flu, a girl with a broken arm, and a few cases of the stomach flu (two of which weren’t very pretty), he was certainly looking forward to his lunch break. He stared at the digital clock until it hit 12:15, then closed it with relief. No dealing with any patients, angry bosses, or any angry GPs for another twenty-five minutes.
“John,” Sherlock says slowly, looking confused and bewildered, “what the hell-”
John cocked his head, "James Bond. You know. Double-0 Seven? Spy for MI6? Can't keep his equipment in one piece?" John stopped as he saw the other man was even more confused, "You don't know James Bond?"
He didn't have time to ponder on it, though, because at that moment, Mary walked through the door, announcing that the bar was going to close up in ten minutes.
It was a picture of the two of them, taken while Sherlock and John had been walking through the street in the snow after a rather thrilling two days before Christmas case. They both seemed to be looking at some Christmas lights. John was smiling at them while Sherlock, on the other hand, was scowling. The picture was from an old newspaper clipping that John had found while they had been repairing 221B. The newspaper clipping had been crinkled and dusty, and all the way back from 2011, but John still protested he keep it. So there it stood, on the mantle, in a cheap £1, plastic gold picture frame. Sherlock stared at the picture; reminiscing later that very night after the picture had been taken.
Mike smiles in a mysterious way, “Not a word.”
What just happened?
He dropped the new shirt he had in his hand on the ground and followed the line of rose petals into the kitchen, awed at what he saw.
John took a bite of his sandwich and a sip of his drink, “And are you going to tell him that his boyfriend is planning to propose to him tonight?”
"I was getting to that. He was friends with Blythe Evans."
“Oh, some undercover work in Eastern Europe.”
Sherlock groans, “It was for a case.”
"Good," Molly nodded, "and one more thing,” she grabbed a card from the nearby table and handed it to him, "this is your ID. It'll let you come in here every day, so make sure not to lose it. You wouldn’t want to be locked out of your own job!" She giggled. “Well, off I pop. Have to tell the manager I can guide the tour in an hour," she checked her watch and mumbled under her breathe, "he really isn't going to like this."
She nodded happily, “Papa’s telling story!”
John’s eyes widened in surprise, “Yeah, yeah it is” his eyebrow furrowed, “How did you know that? I thought you didn’t care for, or even understand things like sentiment.”
But he lets go of it because he's got the real person before him; no longer just a memory far away in Afghanistan.
“You would think," Lestrade rubbed his face with his hand, "We sent him to the nearest prison for questioning a few hours ago when he woke up.”
Until he remembered Mary.
Sherlock faintly smiled at the memory. He might’ve not understood sentiment then. And he didn’t. Sentiment is ridiculous. But he would be lying if he said he had never felt sentiment.
"W-what? W-Why?"
Speaking of Sherlock, where was he? He couldn’t hear the violin from the living room or any clatters of equipment.
All the furniture was gone. No chairs, no tables, no desks, no lamps, no nothing. Only pictures on the wall, a refrigerator, an unplugged telly, papers scattered around the room, and hopefully a bed.
Sherlock swore under his breath. John looking, John sounding so undone… it made blood shoot right down to Sherlock’s groin. He tossed off John’s trousers and pants, relieving the pressure off of John’s erect cock.
"That's what I thought. He has been arrested by Inspector Lestrade."
Sherlock snaps around and throws his bow on the ground.
John beamed and lean in. Placing a small kiss on Sherlock's forehead, "You’re welcome Sherlock."
They both giggle like children on a playground, and John half-heartedly chides Sherlock, “Stop! We can't giggle, it's a crime scene,” John finds himself and Sherlock giggling some more, “Stop it!”
“I mean, how does it work?”
(Also, sorry if the spacing is a bit wonky. I use Google Docs to write, and for some reason, when I transfer it to here, the paragraph spaces become twice as large. Anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this?)
“Happy Christmas John Watson.”
"I'm sorry sir. But only family members are allowed to see him."
John freezes. Even after six years, John has never forgotten that face. It’s not Sherlock, it’s William.
"Yes."
"J-John?"
Sherlock laughed at himself.
“But why?”
The effect was instant.
There was silence.
“And you will tell me your name, right?”
-------------
“Ever the observant,” Sherlock joked. Nonetheless, he opened the package.

They both yawn and try to stand up, but they slip, and Sherlock slips onto the next stair.
And Sherlock wasn’t an extremely religious person. Nor was he a person who still believed in old child tales. But all the same, he swore he could hear a faint ringing of bells, and a soft, “Ho-ho-ho!”
. And do you have the first idea how
(See the end of the chapter for
“-would complete you as a human being.”
John gasped as he felt an -almost- electric spark run down from where their hands met, up his arm, and down to his left hand.
He looked down at the cup of apple cider in his hands. Someone had definitely slipped alcohol into it. It explained his raised temperature and the sweating of his palms. But wasn’t alcohol supposed to lower your heart rate, not increase it? Sherlock would have to experiment more with the effects of alcohol. It could really help him in future experiments…
"Who?"
. This is where you sit and talk, and this is where we sit and listen, then we decide if we want you or not.”
John Watson gets shot.
John goes beet red, “Sherlock!”
His lips slammed into Sherlock's as Sherlock pulled John forward by the collar of his hospital gown.
He stares at the photo of William before putting it back on the shelf, at the bottom of the stack of books. Standing up, he picks up the stack of books, grabs Sherlock’s dressing gown. and plans to walk straight out of the room. But, right before he walks out the door; he breaks. He walks back to the shelf and takes a picture with his mobile before he can rethink his decision.
----------------------
----------------------
He could feel his hand ache as he gripped his cane, and his leg twinged when he accidentally hit it against a shelf. He was sweating profusely, (even though he hadn't run or moved that much) and he had to abandon his suit jacket in order not to overheat. "Why is it so hot in here?" John grumbled under his breath to Mary.
John slammed his head against his desk. Something told him that he was in for a long day.
Sherlock snapped out of his thinking and came face to face with a smiling Irene and a clearly uncomfortable John, "Hello Irene. Do I want to know what you're up to? Getting into more- oh!"
can't-”
“Not many people from the States say ‘lovely chat.’”
“Why?”
"You're a drug addict, an alcoholic, and you smoke, quite obvious really. Your yellow teeth show that you smoke, and your eyes are bloodshot; a common sign of drug addiction. The ring-shaped pale line on your ring finger clearly shows that you used to be married, recently divorced. Probably due to the addiction to drugs and alcohol."

"Well, he failed to shut down all the cameras, so I would presume he was an idiot. It really should've been a lot harder to find him. Even if it's archetypical other humans to be idiots," Lestrade shot a glare at Mycroft, "this level of idiocy is incredible."
John held up his hands in mock surrender, “Alright, alright. Then what’s your, name?” he put finger quotes over the last word.
“What do you mean?” John knew that this was a sort of invasion of privacy, but he had wanted to know what happened with Sherlock’s soulmate for years.
Sherlock laughs and John feels eased at the sound, “That’s true. He
John closes his eyes, “Just text her. Phone her. Do
John gives him an equally shaky smile, “Trying.”
Later that afternoon, after they both had cooked and consumed pancakes (which almost had ended up as a glop of batter on the kitchen floor if John hadn't caught the bowl), and washed up, Sherlock, John, and Rosie all bundled up into their coats and took a walk around Regents Park.
*****
“Your-,” John paused. He was sure the other man knew what he was talking about, so there had to be a reason why he seemed so defensive about it, “never mind.”
Sherlock opened the door to his bedroom and John set Rosie down on the bed; taking off her shoes and his while Sherlock busied himself making a makeshift pillow out of a blanket for Rosie. Once Rosie was settled in between the covers of the bed, Sherlock and John slipped in on either side of her. Sherlock looked at John with half-lidded eyes and watched while John slowly fell asleep, the rise and fall of his chest, and pressed a chaste kiss to John’s forehead. Making sure not to wake John up, he murmured,
Right before he reaches the door, John speaks. In for a penny, in for a pound, “You know, Christmas can also be a time to make amends with people. People who can be… important to you.”
He sees a couple of thin bookshelves in the corner next to a lamp and he decides to take a look there.
fuck.
"O-of course."
Sherlock looks down at his lap, “What do you want me to say?”
“Yeah, actually, I can’t think of a single thing to say.”
“But there have been murders-”
“I know them, but I’m not planning to have a lovely chat with them today.”
“Of course,” Sherlock’s looked away at the window, “I remember everything you say.”

“Oh god. We’re a mess, Sherlock. You tried to give me the things you thought I wanted, but all I really wanted is you,” he groans, “what are we

Sherlock holds up his hand and John scowls, “I don't want to know why else you thought it, because I’m not going to dye my hair ginger. The first time was-” Sherlock freezes.
It was two books. One was a book that had a brown leather casing while the other had a dull, tan cover. He read the title of it,
Once he arrives at the surgery, he stepped out to see police cars surrounding the building.
------------------------------------------
John slowly wakes up, and his head is foggy.
Sherlock’s eyes widen, but takes a sip of his coffee, “Interesting; but if you’re trying to say that my parents named half of my name after a person who might’ve not even been born, then you’re sorely mistaken.”
“Well,” John grins widely, “does Sherlock want to join us in popping them?”
”No. I did some pre-preparations last night too; had Molly’s help.“
“I’m not letting you go till I call the police and the police arrive.”
“Ooh! What are you doing back? I thought you were going to be out late?”
John chuckled, "And you'd be right." He hauled himself and Sherlock up off the ground, brushing themselves off. Thanking whatever god or whatever science that had placed the refreshments table right behind them, so no one could see what they had been doing.
“Tell me what?”
Sherlock let it go.
Sherlock ended up telling John three more cases that he had solved before he met John. One about a chef that disappeared, another about a dead raccoon that had been stuffed with millions of dollars that had been stolen days before, and a third one (his personal favourite) a murdered clown that someone had found with a knife through his chest, and a red balloon tied around his neck. (Sherlock hadn't understood the red balloon part until John explained the movie "It" to him. Which he replied with a grumbled, "Idiotic pop-culture references.") It wasn't until 2 AM that their conversation started to dwindle, and Sherlock started to notice that John seemed to get increasingly nervous. His leg started to fidget, and his laughs became strained. Sherlock became worried. Did he do something wrong? He was just ready to ask John if something was wrong when,
Sherlock turns from his lying place on the couch, “Why would I dye my hair, ginger? I would never dye my hair any color, let alone
John nodded, “.له تاسو مننه”
“You have no idea.”

And later that night, after a chat-filled dinner at a small 24-hour diner; John and Sherlock were sitting by a lit fire, Rosie tucked into John’s old bed, while Mrs Hudson came up and gave them a tray of tea,
But where was it?
“Bet you never saw this coming.” His heart breaks a little at the sight of Sherlock's despair, and he opens his coat to reveal the bomb.
“And you are also in no way prepared for any sort of romantic relationship!”
. I want you to fuck me.
What Sherlock saw was something else entirely. John’s hair stuck up in all directions with sweat in an it-shouldn’t-look-good-but-damn-it-did, way and his white t-shirt was thoroughly soaked through with sweat. Sherlock’s mouth suddenly went dry and he unbuttoned the top few buttons of his shirt. He could feel his palms sweating, and his heartbeat ringing in his ears. Everything felt entirely too hot, even with a large fan spinning right next to him.
They both stand in silence, and John tries not to think that this is the last time in a very long time that they will talk.
“Ah, interesting,” William nodded, “I’m from South Wales, though I live in London.”
"The robber and killer?"
John Watson.
John smiles and a rush of affection runs through him. Something almost like… he doesn’t know. He frankly feels too lightheaded to care.
“Who you thought I was,” John’s vaguely realized that he’s started to talk to Mary, instead of Sherlock, “is the man who I
“Which was it,” the man repeats, “Afghanistan or Iraq?”
"I think it is."
“Forgive me, but you are doing yourself a disservice. I have known many people in this world but made few friends, and I can safely say-”
"Are you sure?"
“Yes?”
-------------------
William was nodding slowly, “Yes, that would work.”
John looks Sherlock straight in the eye, and instead of saying ‘yes,’ he says,
The only man who was patient enough to stay with Sherlock every day, and the man who was brave and kind enough to save Sherlock Holmes.
"Yeah. Shaking a gin martini just ends up bruising the gin," he huffed a laugh, "as cool as James Bond is-"
“Thank you-" John pauses and smiles, "thank you for making Rosie’s Christmas fun this year. I know you haven’t celebrated for a long time, but she really enjoyed it.”
------------------
Sherlock nodded, "Do you?"
Sherlock pressed a kiss to John’s neck, “I know. Come for me.
He stalked to their bedroom, not bothering to eat or shower. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he knew he shouldn't have snapped at Sherlock (after all, he was used to these things by now) but after the day he had, he couldn't give less of a shit. He stripped out of his stained clothes and laid on the bed, his left shoulder screaming as he rolled to his side, irritated from that morning when he fell in the bathroom. Sighing angrily, he turned on his back and tried to ignore the pain, falling asleep into a dreamless sleep.
Lestrade motioned towards him, "Yeah, come one."
Sherlock fell into his chair, "What kind of case? I prefer not to be too involved with the British government. Dealing with Mycroft is enough. Dealing with his minions would drive anyone to the point of insanity."
Sherlock took the file, "When can I meet him?"
He lifted his wrist to his face. Pinpricks. Bruises.
Elise scowled at him, “Then you have the wrong guy. If he was a murderer, I’m sure I could tell,” she glared at John, “Go home, John. And don’t bother coming back until tomorrow morning. You better be glad I’m not calling someone to fire you right now.”
Sherlock seems to ignore the jab and continues to look out the window.
Rosie picks up the oversized tissue paper crown and places it on her head, “Daddy, Daddy, it’s you and Sher’rocks turn!”
What the-
The other man shrugged, “Boredom, I guess. Waiting for someone.”
“I gave you my number. I thought you might call.”
“He was a rubbish big brother.”
Carefully, he inserted the key into the lock and stepped inside. He knows Mrs. Hudson isn’t in, as he just saw her at the hospital, so he skips his usual hello to Mrs. Hudson and and climbs up into his old flat.
Sherlock groans again, “Why was King Arthur’s army too tired to fight?”
John murmurs under his breath as he reads the neon-lit sign that was attached to the outside wall of the (non-alcoholic) bar.
Why, he did not know, and frankly, didn’t have the time to figure it out. He threw the sheets off himself and hurriedly threw on a random set of clothes that laid in the bathroom and looked decent enough for his work. Unfortunately, in his frenzy of “hurry up and get to work before Sarah fires me”, he slipped on the wet tiles,
“Because that's the only thing we can do! It’s not as if you haven’t faired just fine without knowing!”
“How about,” he barely restrains himself from saying,
“Because High Wycombe is better than you are currently equipped to understand.”
The older man glared at Sherlock and silenced as Sherlock continued, “Good. Now, where was I? Right, you were incredibly drunk when you attacked Dr. Watson. The little scratch marks on his leg? They could only be done with a shard of a beer bottle; the scratches were too crooked to be anything else. If you were sober, you would've made long lacerations on his leg, but you made short shallow cuts, showing that you couldn't think straight. Not mentioning the cloddish way you hit him with a metal pole, and how you didn't even break the security cameras nearby. Both facts pointing to that you were drunk, really, the only reason you aren't dead right now was that you managed to knock Dr. Watson unconscious," Sherlock leaned against the table till their faces were nearly touching and his voice turned into a low, dangerous growl, "and honestly, I wouldn't care if you were. Because you injured a person I care about; and people who hurt the people I care about, shouldn’t get off as easy as you did."
John nodded, “Tea would be lovely.”
John shakes his head, “
“You and the Woman. Do you go to a discreet Harvester sometimes?” he laughs humorlessly,  “Is there a night of passion in High Wycombe?”
The other man shrugged his shoulders, "That might help," he downed his drink and set the martini glass on the counter along with two fivers, "keep the change." He slinked away from the bar and behind another customer.
He clambered for the needle. He needed to go back.
John shakes his head, “We’re not naming our daughter after you.”
“The man you saw yesterday, Howard Mossle; I heard from your boss that you had pinned him to the wall, accusing him of murder.”
John frowned, “Huh.”
They jumped apart, an awkward Lestrade standing in the doorway, “I-I, um, I couldn’t hear anything so I wanted to make sure you two were alright. It seems you two, are, so I’ll just go…” He slowly backed out and closed the door, and left John and Sherlock, blushing madly.
*****
Hey! Back Again! Thank you to everyone who is reading this story!
And John tells her. He tells Sherlock, too. And it hurts- it hurts realizing over and over again what he’s done. What he did.
“And I’m telling you that you’re lying and if you don’t stop struggling I’ll-”
Sherlock abruptly stops.
He nodded, "Thanks."
“Oh god no,” the other man shook his head, “I would rather do anything than join the CIA or anything like it. When they meddle, all they do is cause chaos.”
He brought himself off his back and looked about himself, “John?" Where did he go? What was he doing?
"That world would be highly improbable, but indeed, a major improvement in our world today."
“Mm?”
Sherlock shakes his head, “No, no, just… thinking.”
Sherlock nods, “No. No, he wasn’t really.”
“Alright, alright,” John says, and he grabs his own dotted green, and gives Sherlock a dotted blue one.
“Do you like your present, Rosie?” John asked.
“It’s
Sherlock shrugs, “Who knows?”
Wait, where did that last thought come from?
John frowned in minute disappointment, until an idea popped into his head, “That’s alright. Just something to look forward too.”
Wait… Howard Mossle. He had seen that name before. But where?
Sherlock gives him a smirk, “You're not going to be gloating by tonight, when I give you a good-”
John wakes up in the middle of the night, (which was probably 6 AM) groggy and sleep-addled. The air in the room is cold, and he shivers and pulls his blanket tighter. He expects to meet soft cotton, but instead, he feels something smoother, and less soft. Almost like skin.
“John, there’s something ... I should say. I-I’ve meant to say always and then never have,” What is Sherlock saying? “Since it’s unlikely we’ll ever meet again, I might as well say it now,” John's eyes widen as Sherlock speaks. Could it be…?
John smiled back up at him, ”And you changed my life too,“ he pulled away from Sherlock, ”Now why don’t we eat dinner. That pasta looks a lot better than Chinese takeout.“
He spent the rest of the night pounding John into the mattress as they both kissed each other sloppily while Sherlock babbled on and on. (
John sighed in memory of Mary and held Rosie a bit tighter before speaking, "I-I loved Mary honestly. I really did. She was important to me. To both of us,” Sherlock nodded in silent agreement, “And losing her, was devastating, don't get me wrong. But, as much as I loved her, I love you too, maybe even more. And nothing can change that."
“That wasn’t the point of the case!”
When they finally parted for air, John was the first one to speak, "Do you know how long I've been wanting to do that?"
“And do you…love...?’’
"What?" Sherlock quickly stood up, nearly knocking over his chair.
She grinned again, "Alright then. I guess you're good to go!" she patted him on the back, "Remember! Smile and talk to people! Become their friends." John nodded meekly and he followed Mary out of the room and into the bar.
"Thanks so much, John," she grinned ear to ear.
He didn't care.
He let it go.
Holmes.”
John smiled adoringly and nodded, and they walked out the door. A perfect ending to one very surprising party.
"Sherlock-"
John was going to work here.
“It is what it is.”
And regretfully, his response wasn't the most elegant, “Sorry? What? Do I know you?”
John smiles, “And?”
John giggles drunkenly and he looks down at his left hand, trying to check the time. Instead of the time, he sees the red circle on his ring finger. “Sherlock?”
"Mr. Watson?"
“What?”
Sherlock made an uninterested wave of his hand, “For an experiment.”
Good luck, John reflected, a bit unsettled. Not the best thing you want to hear on the first day on the job. And the way Molly had said it, almost as she knew something was wrong-
They rode their orgasms out, shaking and heaving heavily. Slowly, Sherlock pulled out of John; discarding of the come-filled condom in the wastebasket next to the bed. He cleaned them both up with a nearby washcloth and let the towel fall onto the bedside table.
He tries to break through but finds the wood branches too heavy. He reaches into his pockets to find something sharp but groans when he can’t feel anything.
Anthea walked towards the lady,"My name has no concern to you. What is a concern to you is that my boss has a major role in the British Government, and the man you are talking to, just happens to be his brother. My boss would not be happy if you didn't let his brother visit his friend. On the contrary, if you don't allow him, there may be some, unfortunate consequences at the hands of my boss."
The man's amusement didn't fade, "Can I have my drink now, then?"
He takes one last good look at the closed coffin and lets Mrs. Hudson guide him out the door.
“We’ve only just met, and we’re going to go and look at a flat?”
Yet Sherlock felt wrong-footed; as if everything was off equilibrium. Alike the feeling you get when everything in the room is just one inch to the left than it originally was.
John moved his hand so it was holding Sherlock's, "Let's go back to shore."
The playing doesn’t stop, but he hears a hum from Sherlock.
___________________________
The room is different from the last time he has seen it. The bed is rumpled (most likely because of Janine and him doing… things he doesn’t really want to think about), some of the pictures that Sherlock had are gone, and the bedsheets are a different color. But the beloved Judo certificate and Periodic Table of Elements picture are still there.
Sara Fahmy, Assignment Reporter
Sherlock nodded and began to scan the screen as he watched; his expression unreadable to Mycroft and Lestrade. Once the footage ended Mycroft spoke, "I have been able to identify the attacker using the footage. Like I said before, it was incredibly easy."
"Sherlock! Calm dow-"
John’s jaw drops, “So you have dyed your hair ginger before!”
William was the first one to speak, “I’m not quite sure if I’m right, but, maybe this is a good time to say that I’m not actually ginger. Or American.”
The other man shook his head, “Most likely not.”

“I saw the photo on your bookshelf. The photo of William. For a long time, I had no idea why you had a photo of him. Until I realized. It was
"Well if you're quite finished, Ms. Morstan," Molly's voice cut like glass into the air, "I would like to show Mr. Watson around his workspace." She looked at Mary pointedly, and Mary laughed and sauntered off back the way she came.
------------
Sherlock picked her up and put her in his arms, “Are you having fun, Watson?”
“Yes. I would- I would be amenable to that.” Sherlock gives him a shaky smile.
John wondered if he was going to see that strange man again.
Sherlock licked the pre-cum that leaked out of John's cock, his tongue lapping its slightly salty taste. Sherlock growled, “Oh you’re leaking so much. You’re so eager, aren’t you?”  His fingers ghosted over John's throbbing length. John almost sobbed in frustration and he threw his head back. He
Lestrade nodded grimly.
“You’ll see.”
“Really?”
Sherlock hummed again in agreement, "Your idea of a holiday wasn’t as bad as I imagined it would be. Albeit the lack of cases and crime.”
"Greg? What are you doing here?"
When they got entered John's room, John was awake and sitting up. John turned his head towards Sherlock and Lestrade and when his eyes set on Sherlock, he visibly tensed. There was a stifling silence that persisted for a few, long seconds before Lestrade couldn't handle it and broke it, "I heard you beat up the bloke who attacked you pretty badly."
He looks down at his body to find Sherlock's arm and legs wrapped around him like an octopus, keeping him in place.
John ended up asking Mycroft for a picture who, unfortunately, denied him access to any. But hey. Who said he still didn’t have a chance?
Well, granted, he was going to be a bartender here. But still, he wasn't going to be picky about what kind of job he got, as long as he got a job. And plus, being a bartender wasn't all that bad.
Sherlock smiled in relief and pulled John down into another kiss. It was shorter but cleaner than the last one. Sherlock looked up at the clock, it was 3 AM already, “We should go to sleep before we fall asleep right here and now. That would be havoc for all of us. Including Rosie.”
) has got to be the creepiest older brother he’s ever met. But it doesn't phase John one bit.
“Splendid!” He sat down on the floor, and sat her on his lap.
John shrugged, “I’ll take it.” He was choosing his battles, and he had a feeling he wasn't going to win this one, “and anyway, that isn't the only reason I thought of you on ginger hair. I also just simply thought it would look-”

Rosie pranced through the snow, throwing little bits of white into the air, John, and Sherlock following her around, laughing and playing with her. One or two tourists that weren't adapted to London’s natural happenings around them stared at the sight of two grown men rolling in the snow with a two-year-old and laughing.

Je t'aime aussi. -SH
“Speaking to you?”
“You remember that?” John’s expression was incredulous.
He flailed his limbs and kicked. He had to get to the surface again. But where was it?
times before, romantic entanglement while fulfilling for other people-”
John watches as Sherlock gives Rosie a wide smile and follows her to the couch. John pulls up a chair next to the sofa.
John laughed. He didn't really understand what he liked about this man, but he couldn't deny that he didn't, “You know what mate? Against my better judgment, I like you. What's your name?”
He had been 'mingling' in the corner behind the refreshments table (or if you had asked any other person in the room, Sherlock had been just silently staring out from the corner) slowly drinking a cup of apple cider that he suspected had some alcohol slipped into it. He caught sight of John in the middle of the room, chatting with Irene. To anyone else, it seemed like an ordinary sight.
The man (who John now knew had ebony curls and pale skin) cocked an eyebrow in amusement, "Are you in need of assistance?"
Sherlock avoids his gaze, and John can feel anger rising, like a tidal wave, “Yes, she’s a lunatic, she’s a criminal, she’s
“It was worth a try.”
“She’s
Sherlock puts down his coffee and stares at the ground.
"Good."
“I cheated on you, Mary.”
Sherlock spun around, "We're going to need blankets. At this rate, the temperature within this building will drop rapidly." John shook his head and stood up, shifting Rosie in his arms, “It’s fine, I’ll just go.”
“Who said this was a holiday?”
"If I told you something that might be a bit -oh who am I kidding- very weird, would you promise not to hate me for it?"
And number three, he, for no reason he can explain, has killed a man for Sherlock Holmes.
“So,” Sherlock started, “what brings you here? Your house is far from here, and with the snow outside, it would have been nonsensical to drive here.”
“What in fresh
"Sherlock? Sherlock? What’s wrong? Sherlo-"
Sherlock rolls his eyes, “As I think I have explained to you
“I did,” the man picks up his coat and puts it on, “Told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for. Now here he is just after lunch with an old friend, back from the military.”
“Don't make such a surprised face. I
“I know my visits mean a lot to her. She wouldn't want to keep me from coming. Therefore, this might be a game which she secretly enjoys, but someone else has started it.”
“Sherlock can only deduce what I choose to allow him to.”
“It's either the violin or the coffin that goes over the railing. You decide.”
he scolded himself,
“You forced
That was the crux of the matter. Sherlock knew he had to be honest, once and for all.
“It must be. You remember my first name correctly.” Sherlock could practically hear the smirk on Lestrade's face.
The first thing that caught his attention was the fierce wind. It was so forceful that he barely heard the music that was played at a distance to the door where he was still standing, rooted to the spot. But then the wind slackened, and he heard his very own violin, played by a woman clad in a black coat. She was standing next to the railing with her back to him, and her long dark hair was swept like a flame behind her by a few gusts of wind.
“The rest is up to you two idiots.” She smiled fondly at him.
“And now you're creating the same scenario. For what, Molly?”
“Of course Molly did this not only for revenge.” John said. “That's simply not her style. She wanted something good to come out of this mess and was willing to set up a plan to get a confession out of you. She managed to turn a simple act of revenge in something selfless.”
“And what is that supposed to tell me?” Mycroft asked politely, if somewhat bemused.
John calmed down enough to slow down and look around. He was now walking along Ulster Terrace, so he merely had to cross the street to enter Regent's Park. At that moment a sleek black car stopped next to him. A door opened. Sighing, John stepped close.
“Really, Mycroft? I am not in the mood right now.”
“John, listen. I know every sign points to Irene. And we should pursue that until we gather new intelligence. But ...”
When Sherlock arrived at Bart's, he had worked himself up to a state of mild hysteria. He had tried to reach John on his mobile several times, unsuccessfully. Of course, John could still be mad with him and drown his anger in several pints in a pub down the road. But somehow Sherlock doubted this.
John rolled his eyes, good-naturedly, finally pulled his hands away from Sherlock's shoulders and slapped him playfully on the arm.
“Why would you hurt John? He is our friend.
“Honestly, what does she want? Is this supposed to be a joke? Sorry, Irene, not funny. Stealing Sherlock's violin … what's in it for her anyway?”
Now he nimbly took a step forward, interrupted Sherlock's frantic pacing, and placed both his hands on his friend's shoulders to calm him down.
“I suggest that Mycroft continue finding the person responsible for this” – he indicated to the empty screen – “and we talk to Euros.”
“Who else would do this? Who would be so manipulative and cunning as to team up with Euros? Irene is the only woman I can think of.”
“Come see for yourself.” He opened a door not far away from Euros's cell and entered codes and times in the computer where the footage was stored.
the only one visiting, then?”
Sherlock sighed, thanked her and went upstairs, literally dragging his feet behind him. He dreaded the conversation. On entering the flat he saw that John hadn't returned from his room where he probably sat by Rosie's cot to watch her sleeping.
John came back, but instead of sitting next to Sherlock, he chose to stand at a distance, still silent. Sherlock sensed that he would have to start the talking. He looked up and was barely able to face John's anger.
. She was simply a means to an end. I couldn't have blackmailed your brother as effectively as she did. And I needed Euros to get access to your violin. While I remained in the background of this game.”
“I should have been mad at Euros. And I was, at first. It was her stupid game, after all, and you were as much a toy as I was. But after you'd left, it dawned on me that I'd rather be mad at
She gave him the cup of tea she had just made for herself and leaned against the kitchen counter.
stage this, John.”
“What's the story with you two?”
If Mrs Hudson was surprised about another display of affection – from Sherlock, no less – she didn't show it.
“Do you have someone else in mind, then?” He tried to sound casual about it.
“Speaking of emotions: Sherlock doesn't know you're here, I take it?”
“Oh God, no.”
to see that there was no point in putting me through that farce. I don't know if I can ever forgive you for that.”
While he waited, Sherlock anxiously paced the flat. He vaguely wondered why John hadn't come back yet. It was not like him to take prolonged walks. Usually he calmed down fairly quickly after a row with Sherlock.
The cab arrived at Baker Street and they went up the stairs. Mrs. Hudson, upon hearing their arrival, opened the door and started lecturing them.
“Well, I won't just give you back your violin.”
John's voice had grown louder.
John was not so easily placated, although Sherlock's close proximity gave him a whiff of the detective's perfume, which he found oddly distracting.
. Were they simply here for her entertainment? Wasn't it enough what she had done to them? He was fuming. No more hiding his anger. He took a step forward and faced her directly, giving her his best
Meanwhile, John sat on the couch, ungraciously slurping his tea, and mumbling something barely audible to himself.
“Bugger off.”
“Oh, I have enough data. But I won't spoil the game by telling you. Goodbye.”
“You might recall that I was not even here when you came to visit Euros yesterday. Nor the day before. Believe it or not, but I do have other things to do. Running a country, for example.”
If anything, her remark even deepened the frown on John's face. He threw Sherlock a look of deepest disappointment, turned on his heels and headed towards the stairs. Sherlock stood rooted to the spot, at a loss as to what John was so upset about.
Molly sincerely hoped they wouldn't have to resort to such drastic measures.
The footage showed Euros's cell. Sherlock's next-to-last visit bore last Friday's time stamp. Nothing out of the ordinary could be seen for the days after. Euros pacing the confines of her cell, warders bringing food, Mycroft talking on his mobile ...
John had had to hide a smile at that.
Sherlock spun around and faced none other than a smirking Irene. More importantly, however, was the man standing directly behind her.
“Okay, give me the number and I'll get our technician on it. Call you right back.”
“Hello, Sherlock. If you're asking for a new case, I'm sorry to disappoint you. Nothing fancy on the horizon.”
It didn't matter now. He had to gain some precious time.
the coffin was meant for John, and you wanted to protect him. Just like you did when you faked your death. Instead you chose to put
“Sherlock. Did you miss me already?” John slightly winced at the
Someone behind him coughed politely.
“You're right. It isn't. This is about you and John. Tell him that you love him. You desperately want to. I am just setting the stage. Come to think of it, I'm doing you a favour.”
– John grinned at Sherlock's deliberate belittlement of Euros's game – “brought you in even closer confinement than before, I am certain you wouldn't risk losing your few privileges here. No. Someone else has started this. But you happily play your part, I can see how animated you are. You didn't object to anything John said. But your face showed a minuscule frown when John was referring to that someone as a 'he'. Hence, I assume that person must be a woman.”
was it necessary to play this bloody, fucked-up game, involving Euros, Molly and Irene, to fool me into thinking that something else entirely was going on, all this simply to make a love confession?”
into danger.”
have a heart.”
The last thing Sherlock noticed before his gigantic, restless brain finally shut down for the night, was John's hand at the nape of his neck and his even breathing rhythm that told him his friend was peacefully asleep in his arms.
“And that would have been a bad thing because...?”
“Not all of it.” Molly replied calmly. “I merely came up with a rough plan to make Sherlock acknowledge his feelings. Irene did the fine tuning, Euros was only too happy to help. We wanted to set such a stage that Sherlock would be forced to confess his feelings for you.”
“A woman? No. Sorry to disappoint you.”
“But with spying on other people.” Sherlock snapped.
“I am not responsible for his brain capacity.”
“Please, Greg. It's urgent.”
The irony, of course, was lost on Sherlock.
“Remember the day you came to me to apologise?”
“Do you?” He held his breath.
“Oh really?” Sherlock was not sure if he liked where this was going.
Sherlock stepped forward. He saw tears blinking in Molly's eyes. She then turned around and faced the railing, as if she wanted to give him some privacy. He thought that he heard some faint
“Now that you mention it … I
“Now what?”
John was at the end of his tether.
glare.
“Why would I do that?”
“See?”
Oh Sherlock,
“Well, it's either that or the empty coffin. If it's indeed empty, that is.”
“In Euros's cell, of course.” Sherlock sounded a tad annoyed, his face clearly saying
“Of course not.”
“I wouldn't go that far.”
Sherlock looked up when the music stopped. He slowly approached the railing and briefly wondered whether it was Irene standing there with her back to him. But no. When he drew nearer, the woman turned around and gracefully swung her long hair over one shoulder. She held Sherlock's violin clutched to her breast, as if it was very precious to her.
John sometimes wondered how he would have felt in Molly's place. He didn't want to dwell on that. Of course he loved Sherlock. Though what kind of love it was exactly often left him puzzled. Maybe it wasn't important, after all. Still, it was something else entirely to speak that simple truth out aloud. John didn't know whether he would ever find the courage to do so, nor if doing so would destroy the delicate balance of their relationship. So he simply let it be.
Sherlock's first thought was
John chuckled, a joyless sound. “Ten points for your deductive skills.”
love you.”
“Molly.”
“I want answers, Molly.” John didn't waste any time on small talk, stepped into her flat and faced her.
Sherlock stood in the middle of the kitchen, at a loss. This … his violin stolen, another game in which Euros was involved, Irene … the whole case reeked of something personal. The violin was merely a tool to distract him from something much bigger. He had a vague notion what this was about, but if he was right, then it would not do to tell John now. He had to be patient and wait for the next clue.
to have played some part in this. But somehow John had stuck with the notion that Irene was behind all of this. It seemed far too cunning to be Molly's plan. He simply didn't assume she would invest her intelligence in some sort of revenge-come-matchmaking-act. Oh, if he had been able to step out on the rooftop only moments earlier, he would have heard about Molly's plan and not suspected Sherlock. But Irene had made sure that he remained behind the closed door until she allowed him to go out and hear Sherlock's love confession. Which had left him speechless.
“My violin. Gone. Impossible! How ...? It was supposed to stay safe with her ….” He drew a shaky breath, and John quickly interrupted his ramblings.
miss the joys of waking up at 3 AM to your, ah,
. Are you really that clueless?
Sherlock looked as if he would dash out straight away, but John reminded him that it was 8 PM and they had to put Rosie to bed. What was more, they couldn't very well order Mycroft
“Did you?”
“I am loath to admit it, but I have no idea what happened.”
“Frankly, Euros, I don't give a shit about what you're playing at. You may have endless time on your hands in that comfy little cell of yours. But we are normal people who lead normal lives.”
“I bet she could have. But she didn't. It's one of her silly games.”
Where, a few seconds before, the monitor had shown the empty passage to Euros's cell, suddenly there was … nothing. Only a blank screen.
“That’s what I thought too. Until he knocked out two nurses."
“A case?”
As if he’s in a bonfire.
John shook his head in wonder, “I will never understand how you do that.”
John looks down and then looks back up. “The game is over.” His voice has gone rough.
John shifts sleepily. His head is heavy, and he wonders what they were doing before this, “No, I don’t have an international reputation.”
The words spill out of his mouth, “Did I ever tell you what happened to my soulmate?”
“Sh-Sherlock-
"Oh! Right, sure, I'll get that," he grabbed a chilled mixing glass, "how would you like it?"
“The door?”
“Wait, really?”
Sherlock nodded and immediately took off running as the lady continued to speak to Anthea, "Are he and Mr. Watson really good friends?"

The puzzle is solved, and Sherlock and John resolve what has been already known.
William raised his head and suddenly, John's eyes met his. William’s eyes, even in the dull yellow lighting, looked almost ethereal. Unreal. It was a bit silly, really, and also a bit preteen, but John felt like he could get lost in the depth of his eyes. Like if he could just-

As he got ready for work, eating breakfast, changing his clothes, combing his hair, and hailing a cab, he thought of ways to apologize for pinning an injured man to the wall. (He really didn’t want to get fired. After all, this helped pay the rent for the flat.)
He turned and found himself staring at a picture of John and himself on the now newspaper-cleared mantle. “Oh John,” he muttered, “what you do to me.”

"I was about to. Blythe was about to hand William the money until Blythe was arrested about a month ago."
“Alright!” John exclaims, “on the count of five!”

“Sherlock doesn’t share those kinds of things. His brother told me.”

"My Jo-my colleague is in danger; I need to know where he is."
John nodded as he skimmed his shifts on the wall. He seemed to only be working at night / very early mornings. Which was what he requested when he applied and during the interviews. It wasn't like he slept much in the first place. Might as well be productive.
Mary walks towards him and grabs his hand. John grabs back as if he’s hanging onto the last person who he loves. Or at least, that’s what he tells himself.
’” John reads out the book titles as he pulls a few out that he thinks that Sherlock might enjoy reading. He sets the three books down and reaches blindly for another book, but pauses as he feels a flimsy surface. He frowns and looks at what he’s just grabbed. It’s a grainy photo of a man. John rejoices and he thinks he’s found a photo of a ginger Sherlock. (Hah! He knew he would find it at some point!)
Back to salty air and clear skies.
“Badly like how?”
He took a physical and mental step away from the man. Usually, he wouldn’t be nervous, he was in the army for god's sake, but he was in a room filled only with medical tools that were useless for self-protection and he had left his gun at home under his pillow,  And even with a broken arm, the man could well kill him right here and now, if he had somehow sneaked in a weapon. After all, you only really needed one arm to shoot a gun.
John pinched the bridge of his nose, “For an experiment? What kind of- You know what, I won’t ask,” John looked back up, “So, do you need the milk, steak, chicken liver and chicken organs that you made me go across London for?”
“No. But it is what it is.”
"Hello, brother mine."
He doesn’t talk about what he knows about Sherlock. He also doesn’t talk about what he wished he could’ve felt for Mary. He’s not sure if he should.
The bartender smiled sympathetically and gave John the glass, “There you go, on the house. I know how it is on bad days.”
“I don’t want to hear about crazy murders, John.”
“How about… Molly? No, actually, you might ruin her reputation even more.”
Lestrade sets down his pint, and his smile falters, “Well, actually, he hasn’t.”
“Bee!” She exclaimed. She grabbed the bee and held it tight to her chest. If anything that had rubbed off of Sherlock and onto Rosie, it was his love for bees.
Molly jumped, but immediately recovered, "The manager doesn't like when things don't go to plan."
“A stethoscope? What kind of damage can you do with that?”
you aren't part of the CIA? Or MI6?”
John furrowed his eyebrows and turned his head towards Sherlock, “I said what was what?”
Sherlock cut him off with a slap in the face and a glare, "Idiot," Sherlock snapped up and exited the room, slamming the door behind him.
----------------------
"By you and John."
“Yes!” John holds each longer side up triumphantly.
A voice caught his attention and he turned to see Lestrade walking up to him, smiling.
That night, John sits in front of his laptop and thinks.
Rosie nodded vigorously and climbed into Sherlock’s lap.
showed them the picture of Sherlock and John making out on the floor. To John though?
“Hell no.”
The next morning, they took a visit down to the beach and lied down on the rough sand as their bodies soaked in the hot sun for hours and hours. He could’ve stayed there forever really; if it hadn’t been for John, who had convinced him to go down to the ocean. (I didn’t bring all these towels if we weren’t going to swim, you berk.)
“How long have you known?”
His jaw immediately fell open with awe. He had expected many things; a few being an elegant stairwell, high ceilings, and velvet rugs. But nothing could've actually prepared him for what it actually looked like. It was practically a palace! His eyes went wide and he took in his surroundings.
John woke up again alone in the bed, but unlike that day before, he woke up on time to the ringing of his alarm clock that had appeared back on the floor, surprisingly working. He would have to thank Sherlock for that…
And Sherlock keeps being so
And he fell asleep to John’s easy breathing.
“William Sherlock Scott Holmes.”
"Shut up and get into the car."
“Whazz wrong?”
Sherlock hummed, “Yes. Set them in the fridge.”
John looked at the clock too, “Yeah.”
That was the final thing Sherlock heard from John before John had stormed out of 221B. Sherlock presumed that John would return that night. Or the next day; but John didn't.
"What? Don't trust your minions?"
“Christmas.”
”God help me, it is.“
“Then… why are you…?”
“I don’t need to.” And with that, the bedroom door slams shut.
When the cab stops, he pays in full amount, (he thinks about all the times he’s thrown money at a cab driver when on cases with Sherlock and smiles ruefully) and climbs out; coming face to…door with 221B Baker Street.
“Problem?”
“For how long?”
The calm wind ruffled Sherlock’s hair as he sat on the dock; his legs and bare-feet dangling off the edge. He took a deep breath of the salty air, absorbing his surroundings.
An awkward cough came from the doorway.
Sherlock timidly kissed John’s cheek, cautious not to accidentally knock Rosie off of his lap, “Thank You.... love.”
“Ah, Hudders!” Sherlock calls out, and John has forgotten Sherlock’s weird mood, “What time is it?”
They’re sat across from each other in their respective (blackened) armchairs. 221B around them has crumbled walls, the floors are covered in debris, and their both waiting for the cleaning service.  Sherlock’s drinking a cup of coffee from Speedy’s, and John’s twiddling a pen in his hand.
Sherlock smiled tiredly and pressed a kiss to John's lips, "I'm sure."
“Shit!”
John rolled his eyes playfully and took the watch out of the box carefully, taking off his old watch. Sherlock motioned towards himself, "Here, let me."
Sherlock briskly walked in front of Lestrade, "I figured it out last night. William Smith attacked John because he wanted money he couldn't obtain."
Maybe books?
John laughed, "I have to agree, it was a bit ridiculous, but it worked, didn't it?"
John shook his head, “We really don’t do enough for you. If you ever need help with anything, just call us. It’s the least we can do for you; with you cleaning our mugs and sweeping the floor last night.”
John shook with fury, “ You need to ...? Doesn’t she mean
John shook his head, there weren’t any holidays observed in Great Britain, it wasn’t Valentine’s Day, and it wasn’t either of their birthdays.
Rosie and Sherlock pull on each side, and John can tell that Sherlock lets Rosie get the larger half.
but they both knew he secretly enjoyed the thrill.
"Yeah," Molly laughed, "it smells in here, I know. You'll get used to it. At least, that's what other people have said. Personally, I'm still not used to it either." John chuckled. It seemed to lighten up the mood. He looked around. The room had a large bulletin board, industrial sink, a grey door (which he assumed was a walk-in cooler), and a large shelf with rags and extra glasses.
“That’s the whole of it- if you’re looking for baby names.”
“But why?” John growls, “what possible reason could that dick have now?!”
Note: HMP Pentonville is a real prison in London!
Yes! John smiled giddily and nodded, “Good. That's, that's good.”
She smiled and walked out the back door as John turned his attention back to a stack of dirty glasses in his hand, debating whether he should put them in the room behind him with the sink, or wash them now.
John chokes and he can feel the tears well in his eyes.
“I’m supposed to say I’m in Afghanistan temporarily as an airplane pilot, but I’m not one at all.”
"The case is about a mysterious attack."
John thought about it for a moment. He couldn't meet with his family, but he still wanted to go somewhere familiar to him. A place that felt like home.
Sherlock's throat went dry, and he tried to sound plenty more confident than how he truly felt, "John, I have known you for almost eight years. We have lied to each other, hit each other, and argued countless times. I refuse to let one little weird comment change anything."
John immediately froze and slowly looked up at the doorway, wincing at who it was. It was Elise, another GP he had met five months ago. Another GP who was currently fuming and stalking towards John, “You are pinning an innocent, injured man to the wall!”
- I’m going t- to-”
"Mycroft told me to come here to meet up with you. William Smith is in this prison," Lestrade motioned to the building behind him, "currently locked up."
dangerous. Trust you to fall for a sociopath.” John almost laughs at his own hypocrisy. Marrying an ex-assassin, falling for Sherlock, and all, “ but she’s… you know.“
“Shit!” John stuck his hands in his pockets and retrieved a few Afghani dollar bills worth a few British pounds. He stuffed them into William's hand with one other coin, “sorry. Ah, could you give those to the waiter, please? I’m so sorry, but I really must go. I hope you find whoever you came here for.”
When Sherlock had been invited by his roommate, John, to go to Mary's, 'Autumn Equinox,' Party, he hadn't expected to come.

“John.

are now, Mary,” he spits out her name, “You’re a
The other man rolled his eyes, “I’m doing something that must involve absolute secrecy, but no. Not part of those organizations. I feel as if we’ve discussed this before.”
“It's not.”
"Oh, you must be Mr. Watson! The new bartender!"
He turned around briskly and sat down his tea cup, collapsing in his chair with a slight pout on his face.
East Wind? “What’s that?”
—————————
John rolled his eyes, “Yes, of course, they were.”
“Well, it seems like you boys have yourselves a free little Christmas gift,” Mrs. Hudson winked, “Well off I pop! I have some gifts I have to deliver.” And with that she left the flat, leaving Sherlock dumbstruck. (Which was not a daily occurrence)
"I matched his face with information from the archives. The assailant was a man of the name, William Humphrey Smith. I have his records," Mycroft handed Sherlock a manilla file, "I have personally not read them, but I'm sure they will help you."
John looks to Sherlock to see one of his eyes his half opened, “Yeah… we promised to-,” John yawns, “-to meet each other next Christmas.”
----------------------
Sherlock blushed and set Rosie on the floor to climb to his feet and retrieved the silver box off the bookshelf. He handed it to John and he gratefully took it. Carefully unwrapping and opening the box, his eyes widened at the site.
“How do you want me to fuck you, John?”
John looked down and clenched his fists, “You can’t keep trying to decide my own life for me; let alone my own love life, or my own sexuality! Can’t you just let me decide something on my own?”
"Good. I'm Molly Hooper," she introduced, "I have been instructed to show you to your station. Follow me." She turned around and John limped his way after her.
On hearing this, Mrs Hudson was not able to remain disgruntled. She gracefully accepted the apology, went to fetch Rosie and put her in John's arms.
“You'll get your answers. I just don't know whether you will like them.”
“John.” Molly opened the door to her flat. She half expected him to be calling on her.
“But –” he quickly found the flaw in her logic – “if Euros intended the coffin to be for John, you were never in real danger. You see that, don't you?”
They were back at their flat, Sherlock with a satisfied grin on his face, John still at a loss. Although he possessed enough self-esteem not to be bothered by the fact that Sherlock often left him puzzled – the man was a genius, after all – he sometimes wished Sherlock wouldn't be so damn cocky about it.
“Oh stop bitching for once, will you? You're worse than Harry and her on-off girlfriend.”
“It leaves us here. Nothing has changed.” John spoke calmly.
“Are you ever, my dear John?”
John went to her and gave her a hug, effectively interrupting her rant. “I am truly sorry, Mrs Hudson. We had a bit of a crisis earlier. I was practically kidnapped and no one could reach me. Of course I was worried sick about Rosie.”
“What the …?” John looked disbelievingly at the screen; Mycroft made a resigned face.
“What's wrong, Sherlock?”
Sherlock looked at him. His heart thumped against his ribcage in a mad rhythm. He was still afraid. But if John was unafraid, he would follow his lead. He felt John's hand close around his right wrist, then his arm was pulled forward until he was snugly pressed against John's chest. He carefully wrapped himself around John and felt his tension dissipate.
, John thought. But he did not say anything. They weren't here to exchange pleasantries, nor would he be able to win a battle of words with Euros. So he simply kept silent.
It was impossible to avoid her stern look. Sherlock didn't even try. He felt on the verge of a breakdown. His feelings for John were out in the open, but he didn't know whether they were appreciated, let alone returned. He felt as if his skin was stretched to the point of tearing, leaving him utterly vulnerable.
Sherlock was already seated on the couch, while John rummaged in the kitchen's cupboards for clean mugs. The kettle was happily humming along. Rosie was still with the nanny, to be picked up in two hours' time. As Sherlock was not helping, John tried to methodically recall what Euros might have given away during their encounter.
Sherlock was on the verge of making another scathing remark, when John cut in.
. John was alive and well. He was not trapped in the coffin, had never been in real danger. Somehow, Sherlock had doubted it anyway. But it was another thing altogether to
“Pray tell, how would I know that? Much to my chagrin, I am not gifted with foresight.”
He hadn't noticed it before, so engrossed had he been in the music.
“Why would he be upset about that? It's obvious that you two love each other and it was high time you told him so.”
And that was all Sherlock would say, no matter how hard John was prying. John finally gave up and, in an even fouler mood than before, announced “I need some fresh air.” He grabbed his coat and left the flat without so much as a mumbled “Git.”
“I hope not.”
“I trust Sherlock's abilities. He probably deduced from your micro expressions whom you were talking to.”
After he had left the flat, fuming, John barely saw where he was headed. It was a good thing that he remembered calling the nanny to tell her that he would be late in picking up Rosie. He stomped along Baker Street in the vague direction of Regent's Park. A brisk walk was just the right thing to do to calm down his nerves and sort through his jumbled thoughts.
He hated it.
“Let's find out who it is, then.”
“Didn't expect that, did you?”
“But he feels manipulated.” Sherlock was tired of explaining why John would think that.
All was well.
“Care to tell me more about it?”
. Is there any excuse for forgetting to pick up Rosie? The poor nanny never reached you on your mobile, and thank God she had my number and I was at home, so Rosie is with me now. How many times to I have to tell you that I'm not your housekeeper? Let alone your babysitter?”
what you said. And I'm done with not knowing and being kept in the dark.”
“No, Sherlock. You simply told me what I knew all along. It's not frightening me. Not any more. And, yes, you know I love you back. Now go to sleep, it's been an awfully long day. We can figure out the details tomorrow and the rest of our lives.”
, John thought. He found himself at a dead end.
“Where is it?”
“Why didn't I tell you I suspected Molly?” Sherlock drew a deep breath. “Because it would have caused more questions I was afraid to face. Such as, why do you suspect her? Why would she do that?”
“Oh, right. Sorry, I forgot.”
“Oh, now you make me curious, Sherlock. What could you possibly have found out?” John thought he could detect a hint of insecurity behind her even features.
The two Holmes brothers, for once in unison, shot John a look that clearly said,
Sherlock had to draw breath. His view was suddenly blurred from unshed tears. He was at a loss where all this had come from. It seemed that once the words had left his mouth, he couldn't stop. He ought to have felt embarrassed for saying all this in Molly's presence, but he didn't. He almost felt exhilarated.
“John thinks I arranged this whole kidnapping thing.” he blurted out.
“It was so obvious, wasn't it?
Mycroft's face gave nothing away while he answered.
“This is not a bloody game, Molly.”
“Good luck, John.” She kissed him on the cheek and watched him leaving, a slight smile on her face.
“So you're

“That I love him.”

to hurt him. It's all up to you, Sherlock.”
“If it's not for a case, I'm afraid I can't.”
, she simply wanted someone to play her cruel games with. If ever the term of “high-functioning sociopath” was adequate, it was for Euros (not Sherlock,
“It's only a guess at this stage, but yes.”
“How very thoughtful of you.”
“You gave him a taste of his own medicine.”
Time slowed down almost to a standstill. John and Sherlock were staring at each other. Silence ensued.
When Sherlock entered John's bedroom some time later, he found John in his bed, facing him. Rosie was peacefully sleeping in her cot, a few feet away. Sherlock looked from her tiny shape back to John. After a few moments of breathless silence, he worked up the courage to climb in John's bed and crawl under the duvet. He stretched out carefully next to John, not daring to move. It was hard not to be overwhelmed by John's presence, the warmth, and his unique scent, emanating from him. John's eyes were on him, nearly black and hard to read.
The last words rang unnaturally loud in the quiet living-room. John's eyes never left Sherlock's. Affection shone in them. Suddenly he smirked.
.” Molly's voice grew angrier. She was facing him directly now. The violin hung limply by her side, forgotten.
Sherlock could only nod.
Sherlock gaped at her.
Sherlock was a bundle of nerves by the time John came back. In turns, he sat down on the couch, went to look after Rosie, made himself tea – only to forget the cup on the kitchen counter until the liquid was undrinkable slush – and frantically paced the living-room, all the while listening for John's footsteps outside.
“Sherlock came to me a few weeks ago.”
Mycroft had left the manager's office and greeted John and Sherlock as they were approaching Euros's cell tract. Although his face betrayed his words of welcome, there was no real menace in his voice. It seemed to John that, ever since the brothers had to work together to solve the riddles Euros had set for them, they grudgingly respected each other. Nonetheless, they still kept up that much-loved tradition of trading insults.
“You're upset, John.”
“I have no idea what you two have been up to, and I don't want to know. But, honestly,
The very moment he received Irene's last text message, Sherlock phoned Lestrade.
“I miss my violin. But you know that already.” Sherlock's voice was clipped. John could see the tension in his firmly set lips.
Two words blinked on the display.
“Because I'd rather have come up with her name if that means I could protect you. I didn't know what Euros would have done with you had I given her your name.”
Suddenly, the penny dropped.
John looked disbelievingly at Molly after she had ended. Of course, he had suspected
Sherlock thought his legs would give out. When he was finally able to come up with an answer, all he managed to say was “But John knows I love him. Why would I need to make sappy confessions?”
“Really, Sherlock? I am no fool. Neither are you. I know that the first person you thought about who would fit in that empty coffin was
Hopefully, they would sort it out. If not, there was plan B. Irene had said that one always needed a plan B. It involved John and Sherlock locked up in Euros's cell.
“John.
But Sherlock had already disconnected the call.
to have them helicoptered to Sherrinford. Sherlock eventually gave in to John's reasoning and slopped down on the couch, sulking. But when John returned from Rosie's cot, he found his friend fast asleep, all sulking forgotten. John couldn't suppress a smile. Usually, it was way easier to make Rosie go to sleep than Sherlock. Come to think of it, he had two children to mind now, just as he and Lestrade had joked a while ago. He put a blanket over Sherlock and absentmindedly stroked a stray lock from his face, before stifling a huge yawn and retiring to his room.
“Because you wouldn't have believed me had I told you that she was merely seeking revenge.”
. Afraid where that would leave us. What you would expect from me, other than what we have now. Maybe it's irrational. Remember when you cried in my arms? When I said to you
“I see.” Euros's voice bled amusement. “And what makes you think that you are any closer to find out who this person is?”
“I don't know if you even
“I guess I have to thank you for this?” John grumbled.
“I don't understand.” Sherlock's tone was defensive.
“Emotional, are we?” She patted his arm, then took a step back and gave him a soothing smile.
“I don't
Before Sherlock could react, John had grabbed his coat and left the flat.
It was infuriating. Especially since this seemed to be a personal case. It bothered John that his best friend didn't seem to trust him on this.
“Never doubted that. So … today you went to see your sister, and the violin was gone? Did she tell you something?”
“Honestly, Mycroft, how many different people could have had access to this room last week? It's hardly rocket science to find that out. Even you could do it.”
“You already saw this bit, didn't you?” Sherlock did not even bother to hide the anger in his voice. “Who could have been tampering with the footage?”
“There's another reason why it would have been risky.”
“Oi, Sherlock, stop pacing the room like a lunatic. Tell me what happened.”
“I figured as much.”
part. By God, he was bloody sick of those two words.
“ – –“
He did not have to wait for long. Half an hour after John had left their flat, Sherlock received another text from Irene.
“What. Has. Happened. Tell me.” He put on his best Captain Watson face, his dark blue eyes boring into Sherlock's, lips set in a straight don't-mess-with-me line. Sherlock sighed.
“But … you can't probably be upset about what I said to you?” Sherlock hated how insecure his voice sounded.
“Is he in danger?”
Sherlock wasted no time in rattling down his observations.
“I thought so. What kind of game do you have in mind?”
When, after Sherlock's “death” he started dating Mary, John had accepted that his life would become less adventurous (blissful ignorance!). Although Mary had deceived him in many ways about her identity and her past, he had been grateful for her presence in his life and her unwavering friendship to Sherlock. For weeks and months after Mary's death, John had fallen into a bottomless pit of grief until his best friend was able to reach out to him. Over time, Sherlock had somehow become his significant other. John never questioned it, although he sometimes wondered what it was that made their bond so unique, and so difficult to explain to others (and himself). But he had stopped a while ago to be bothered about what other people thought about them. He was content to live with Sherlock in 221B, just like old times, with the addition of his beautiful daughter. Rosie had taken a great liking to Sherlock; and Sherlock never even once complained that she was a nuisance. When John had asked him one day if it was okay that they were having a baby at 221B, Sherlock had simply answered:
“You know very well why we came here, Mycroft.”
They left the computer room. Mycroft returned to his office, while Sherlock and John approached Euros's cell. Euros was already waiting for them, enigmatic smile on her face. It was the first time since Sherlock had rescued him from the well at his parents' house that John saw Euros. He had a hard time keeping his cool. Everything from that dreadful night rushed to the surface of his memories. He could taste the bitterness of holding an innocent man at gunpoint. He heard the mad cackle of Moriarty and the pleadings of the girl on the plane. Although the voices had turned out to be fake, John's fear had been all too real. He tried not to give in to his dark memories, but to face the task at hand.
“Off you go then.” She shoved him in the direction of his flat. “Tell him that you didn't manipulate him. And then repeat what you told him earlier.” She made it sound the easiest thing in the world.
a case.”
“Why, Sherlock?” he finally asked. There was no anger in this voice.
