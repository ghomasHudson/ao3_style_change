"I would definitely agree with that assessment." In Peter's exhausted haze earlier that morning he had only packed about half of his usual amount of snacks, and had been planning on raiding the kitchen as soon as he got home.
"Oh yeah, he just had some dust embedded in the elbow joint. Pete and I took care of it."
"Or a warning shot," Peter muttered, catching himself when Papa gave him a frown. "Nevermind. You sure you'll be home tomorrow though?"
"Pretty sure Петр's anxious to get home too," added Bucky. "Think he misses that girl of his. He was up pretty late last night talking to her."
"Love you too, Dad. Talk to you soon."
"Yeah, I guess it is." Peter gave her hand a final squeeze before gathering up his backpack. "I'll see you tomorrow, okay?"
Fury scoffed, tapping his palm on the desk.  “Right before you called, I received word from one of our undercover agents in a neighbouring country.  Now, given that this is still unverified information, I have to take it with a grain of salt.  But if what she’s been able to uncover is true, then I have good reason to believe that the entire STRIKE team has been taken over by HYDRA.”
"Yeah, I've noticed," Peter said. "And my dad and I never used to cook before Papa came to live with us. He's the one who taught me how. He told me when he was young his ma had to work all the time, so he ended up doing most of the cooking."
🐰 = it’s so fluffy!
"So…" Peter said as he moved his first pawn. "Has there been any word from—"
"So, what should we draw today?"
And while Tony was rather used to having to take care of things on his own, the fact that Senator Davis had recently been appointed to the Armed Services Committee—and rather suspiciously, if Tony was being completely honest—had meant that the bureaucratic red tape was even thicker than usual. Senator Davis seemed to thoroughly enjoy making Tony's job as difficult as possible.
"Yes, dear, I know that," Maria said softly, her fingers curling around Howard's hand. "But right now I don't really think that information is going to help Tony sleep through the night, so—"
"Tony, where're we going?" he asked, rather frantically. "I told you, I don't want Peter to see me like this—"
"Interior could sure use a paint job or something," Tony muttered as he took another step, carefully to keep his foot from clanking against the metal floor. Tony had never been a fan of that dull, charcoal grey colour, as he'd always thought it too industrial-looking. In fact, he was fairly certain that he and Peter had even discussed that very topic a few times, coming to the conclusion that if they were ever to build a spaceship, they would paint the interior something cool, like bright blue.
"Oh, yeah!" Peter said, squinting to get a better look. Whatever it was was orange, moving quickly through the emptiness of space as it left a sort of fiery trail behind it. "It kinda looks like a comet? Are there supposed to be any of those coming through this area now?"
"Yes, but that small increase in mass will give you another seventy-six percent in channeling capacity," insisted Grandpa. "And we could probably boost that up to eighty or even higher if we altered the design from a true cube to a more rhomboid shape." He paused, holding out his hand for Peter's pencil, which Peter promptly handed to him. "It's like this. You alter the design just so, and—" Peter watched as his grandfather proceeded to sketch out a rough diagram of an alternate containment vessel, one that slanted slightly outwards instead of straight down. "—this would allow more of the energy to build up inside the container before it gets funnelled into the satellites, which means higher amounts of energy are produced, which means—"
"Yeah, that's what Стиви used to say," Uncle Bucky said, chuckling. "You really are a lot like him."
He was Tony's son, his boy who was dying a slow, agonising death, and he needed to make absolutely sure that even through all of the madness erupting all around them, that he
“T-Tony!  Are you there?” he tries to call, managing only a weak sort of croak.  “Tony?  Wh-where are you?”
It was all Peter could do to force a smile as he took the phone from the pretty nurse. He should've known it wasn't going to happen since the sun was almost completely set already, but…
look Steve always got whenever Tony gave him a compliment.
They were quiet for a while, the steady
special.
"I know, babe," Tony said somberly. "Which is why we need to get that stuff decrypted as soon as possible, and hopefully before the entire government has fallen under President Cole's spell, 'cause if that happens—"
Tony gave a nod as he shoved the comm device into his ear. "Steve? Steve, honey, are you there? Steve? Oh gods, don't do this to me now, honey! Not when we've just figured out how to—"
"Do you want anything else?" Steve asked once they'd polished off all the food and the entire bottle of wine. "I'm pretty sure there's a couple of mints floating around the bottom of the bag somewhere."
And also—as Phillips liked to bark—plenty of them that were lost in the very same way.
"Uh huh," he said. "Or at least I used to be. It's… been awhile."
With Dad’s permission, Uncle Bucky had told Peter the entire horrific story of his crushed arm and how it came to be amputated, including how the doctors had tried to save it before they determined it was beyond saving.  Peter had thought that since he’d read so many books and seen so many movies that depicted some pretty gruesome injuries that he would be fine.  And, likely thanks to how much he loathed vomiting, he’d always felt that he had a pretty strong stomach too.
"Thanks, Ned," Peter said, inwardly kicking himself. He had completely forgotten that Ned was going to be hanging around them while Betty was busy overseeing the festivities.
He was a former soldier, after all.  Well used to the imprint of teeth marks on his tongue as he snapped to attention yet again.
They were already too late.
"Well, it's not like you can blame me. Not my fault that you're the peak of human perfection."
"That's affirmative," said Bucky, interspersed with rounds from his custom-made machine gun. "And Сэм said he'd treat."
He couldn't tell them right away, not when he was scheduled to do his experiment with the MAUDE glasses in only a couple of days. This was gonna be a doozy of a confession, and he was too afraid that Dad would be so mad afterwards that he would cancel the experiment.
And yet, somehow, Steve still didn’t see it.
"Well, I hope that's the case, Rogers, for your sake. 'Cause as much as it irks me to admit, this newfangled class you and all of your hotshot friends are starting tomorrow morning could very well be the most important thing that you ever do in your lives, you got that?"
And, even worse, he just couldn't seem to formulate a way out of it. Couldn't seem to coerce his mind into doing anything except worry himself nearly sick over Tony.
Bruce shook his head, not looking up from his papers. "Eh, not too much, unfortunately. I was kinda hoping that Peter would be able to uncover some more stuff, 'cause I honestly think I'm gonna go permanently cross-eyed if I do much more of this decoding." He shot Tony a rather sheepish wince as he pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose. "Sorry, Tony. I don't want it to seem like I'm trying to exploit your kid or anything, but—"
"Okay, good," said Grandma. "Then I'm going check on how the caterer's doing right quick, all right?"
"Says Sam."
“Okay, so… how ‘bout you think of it like this,” Peter cut in.  “You know how I like to sleep with my bedroom door cracked open, right?”
of Papa's shield as it slammed against their enemies, something still wasn't quite right.
"I'm—I'm not supposed to talk to you," she said in an accent that Peter couldn't quite place, and barely loud enough for him to hear over the deafening roar of the battle.
“Yeah,” murmured Tony.  He cleared his throat, straightening his back.  “So, you’ll prepare the press release?  According to JARVIS, we’ve got about three weeks left in our current contracts, so—”
his eyes said.
Uncle Bucky's lower lip started to shake as he reached his hand over to the notebook, his fingertips tracing along the outer pencilled lines.
"Yeah?"
not really up for it," Tony said casually, as if they hadn't just recently listened to a government official try and smear Steve and the Avengers across the entire United States Senate. Steve felt his jaw tightening again, and he took another sip of his tea, trying to force himself to calm down. Tony wasn't trying to minimise or ignore what was happening, he was just compartmentalising it.
" Peter breathed as another shiver raced down his spine, more freezing cold than he'd ever felt before. "Does that mean I was—was I
His rather passionate love affair with whisky apparently didn't help at all either, and while Grandpa had insisted after Peter's admission that he had dumped all of the whisky down the drain, Peter could still often smell it on him when he came to visit.
"Exactly zero, Senator," answered Tony. "Just because I halted production didn't mean that I reneged on any of my company's contracts. Stark Industries has never broken a contract made in good faith, and it never will. And if you don't believe me, I'm sure there's a few Colonels or Generals sitting behind me who would be happy to vouch for me."
Peter shot him one of his
The three second pause that followed was all Steve needed. No wonder Bucky had changed his tune so quickly.
"The one that his mad sister destroyed?" asked Ned.
"Gwen," Steve gently cut in. "It's all right for you to be sad about—" He broke off, unable to say his son's name for fear of breaking down himself. "We're all going through it. All of us, and trying to suppress how we're feeling only makes things worse in the long run."
"Yes, Captain?" Scott answered, immediately standing at attention.
his traitorous mind thought as his heart started to thud, so madly that he felt lightheaded.
That had been a really fun time.  Uncle Sam had taught Peter how to cook gumbo, a yummy dish that Peter had never before eaten, much less knew how to make.  And Peter had taught Uncle Bucky how to play chess, listening while Uncle Bucky told him stories about growing up in Brooklyn with Papa.
"Um… Missouri?" Cindy said with a grimace.
"Pete—!"
Various heads bobbed around the room in agreement, with Chairman Oklahoma giving Davis another deep scowl.
Steve grinned, knowing all too well the kind of trouble the three of them tended to get into when they were bored. "Yeah, I do. I'll be down in a minute."
"Then I guess it's good that his daughter likes Peter so much," Steve said.
"Tony!" Steve said sharply, startling Tony as he wrapped his arms around his rigid body, pulling him tightly against his chest. Tony tried to fight him at first, not quite awake enough to understand what was going on until he felt Steve's fingers weave into his hair and his warm breath on his ear. "Shh, sweetheart, it's okay. It's okay, I've got you."
"Only Peter Stark, Anthony Stark, and Howard Stark have been given permission to alter my matrix at this time, sir," answered JARVIS.
But now that JARVIS was halted, that meant it was probably only a matter of time before someone tried to get Ultron up and running.
"That's a discussion for another time, Peter," Papa said in his Captain's voice—
"As you wish, sir," JARVIS replied. Bucky flinched when the scanning beam appeared, but thankfully it was over before anything else could happen.
And while the new device had helped some, as had Steve and Tony trying to keep him so busy that he'd have no choice but to sleep, Steve was still rather concerned about how well he was going to do with being away from home for two whole nights.
"He's a plague," Bruce continued. "He invades planets, he takes what he wants, and he wipes out half their population. Guys, he's the one who sent Loki. The attack on New York? That was him. The Chitauri are his army, Tony. And he's their general."
Papa gave a sigh, squeezing his hunk of dough so hard that it squirted through his fingers. "There was initially a problem with Loki, which is why Uncle Thor had to leave here at first. Through a weird turn of events, he ended up discovering that Loki had put their father into exile so he could take over the throne of Asgard. Thor managed to find him again but Odin was very sick by the time he did, and apparently when Odin passed away the magic that had contained Thor's evil older sister in her prison also went away, so she was able to escape and return to Asgard."
"Okay, now that's just not fair," Tony said, gasping again as Steve's tongue flicked across his other nipple. Tony's fingers wove into Steve's thick blond hair as he kissed across to the mass of scars, laving his lips and tongue over them. "You know how damn sexy you are when you start talking dirty to me."
With a sort of half-smile, Carol hurried over to Ma, whose eyes were puffy and red-rimmed from crying. Steve had seen her down in the emergency department shortly before he was discharged, but after a few minutes he had asked her to return upstairs to be with Peter. Neither Steve nor Tony really trusted anyone else to care for him besides Ma and Sharon.
—of how indelible Steve had become in their lives.
"All right, Sam," Steve said as he pressed the autopilot button, grinning at the
"Holy shit, that's so fucking sexy," Tony said on a gasp as Steve began kissing Tony's neck, working his way down to his chest to the mass of scars that decorated the skin over his sternum. During his recovery in Wakanda, Steve had asked Shuri to repair just about every single remnant left behind from the injuries that had led to Tony and Steve's fateful meeting, except for the scars created by the arc reactor. Steve had asked Tony's permission to leave them alone, of course, but even if Tony had wanted them removed, all it would've taken was one look at Steve's pleading blue eyes and he would have relented.
, and it had been so long since Steve had met anyone who wasn't wearing some kind of invisible mask that he'd almost forgotten what it was like.
"Cap?" Clint asked as T'Challa followed his King's Guard into the palace. "Do we have a plan?"
Rising from her chair, Lorraine pads over to Steve’s area, leaning against the dividing wall.
Tears stung Peter's dry, scratchy eyes as looked up into his father's worried face. "D-daddy, where—where's Gwen? And—and her dad, he—he came inside, and—and then the m-monster t-tried to—and… is Uncle B-bucky okay? Where—where is he, 'cause—?"
However, none of that was the information he was looking for.
hadn't been the next to last item on his list, Steve would’ve already locked the front door and raced to his room to take care of the raging hard-on he’d had ever since he and Tony first shook hands, the two hours remaining till closing time be damned.
Somehow, without ever having heard his voice in person and relying only on Tony's descriptions, Peter had managed to program Mr Jarvis's voice so closely that Tony was instantly able to recognise it.
At first, Tony had been too stunned to speak, staring down at the metal tags that rested against his sternum directly below the arc reactor.  He’d learned enough about military history during his years as a weapons’ manufacturer to know that a soldier presenting his dog tags to his gal—or fella, in Tony’s case—was only one or two steps shy of a marriage proposal, something that Tony had never—not even once—believed he’d ever experience.
But in this universe, Tony was there. Fighting alongside him.
But yet, here he was.
"Dude!" Ned hissed just as their teacher stepped into the classroom. "That was like
"Oh, yeah," Gwen whispered as fresh tears welled in her eyes. "We're… we're trying to hang in there. It's hard, but… being here, and trying to stay busy, it—it helps a lot. I think if we were at our own house, it'd—it'd be a lot worse."
Emoji Key for those who don't know what to say in the comments!
"Tony!" Steve choked out as Tony's fingers finally slipped underneath the soft fabric and curled around his aching cock. "Please, teastaíonn níos mó uaim!"
"They do exist for a reason, little guy," Steve said. "Do you know if Dad's awake yet?"
"I know," he said softly. "And thank you for understanding."
“I’m pretty sure we’re both looking a bit worse for the wear,” says Steve.  He raises Tony’s hand to his mouth, kissing the back of it.  “Can I—um… would it be okay if I held you for a little while?  I—I’m just so cold, and I—I really don't like—”
"Week from Tuesday at one," Tony repeated. "That'll work, thanks, J."
"Yes, sir. It is housed in one of the now-defunct Stark Industries buildings on the old California property."
Slamming his gaping jaw closed, Steve's mind immediately flew into its rapid-planning mode that he had perfected during the war, cataloguing data and formulating theories as he attempted to come up with all of the possible explanations for where Dr Strange had just transported himself from, and, more importantly, why he was no longer in possession of the Time Stone.
Which, Steve realised, it likely did. As much as Steve couldn't imagine how horrible it would be to lose a spouse, he figured it had to be even worse to face the prospect of losing your child.
"So, I heard that you kicked your Uncle Sam's ass again at chess today, hmm?" Tony said as he brushed the curls out of Peter's eyes, trying to keep his expression as neutral as possible.
“I know all about what’s going on in Sokovia, Tony,” Obie had replied, so low and deep that a chill had raced down Tony’s spine.  “But what I want to know now, is what the hell you think you're doing with that…
"Uh huh." Peter breathed in, letting it out slowly. "I'm ready, Uncle Sam. You can start now."
He didn't remember all that much from the ensuing hours. He could vaguely recall his mother dragging him out to her car—calling for an emergency transport was well beyond their meagre budget—strapping on his safety belt, and slapping him lightly on the cheek, warning him very sternly that under no circumstances could he fall asleep. Steve's lungs were so tight it was as though they'd been caught in a vise, his throat so swollen and sore that he couldn't breathe out. He had been told by his doctors numerous times over the years that if he ever reached the point where he couldn't seem to exhale that he was in very serious trouble, and the thought that he was literally suffocating from his own built-up carbon dioxide as his ma drove only made his panic that much worse.
"Yeah, I see it," Tony responded, low and tight, his arms not wavering a single centimetre. "Does anyone have eyes on Steve or Pete?"
"Ahh, you killed him?" asked Peter. "Or the planet?"
how he had imagined their first kiss would be, standing in the middle of a dark and stinky boys' bathroom during a school dance, but somehow, in all of the craziness that was his life at the moment, it seemed to be just perfect.
doing any of that practise, Dad, so—”
Actually, now that he thought about it, he didn't even know if Gwen considered herself his girlfriend or not, which was probably something that he should clarify before asking her if he could kiss her.
"I love you, sweetheart," Steve whispered, his warm breath against Tony's ear sending a shiver down his spine. "It's all gonna be fine."
Well. Tony could certainly do something about that.
“I know it seems real, honey, but I promise you, it’s not,” said Dad.  “You're right here.  You're with me and Pete, and we love you so damn much, honey.  You are
"All right, I'm on it," Steve said. He locked eyes with Bucky, nodding as Bucky reached his metal arm towards the hatch's handle. "Three… two… one…"
Since Liz had always been especially fond of the lightning round, the team spent pretty much the entire time with answered rapid-fire questions, with Peter and Gwen answering the majority of them, much to the chagrin of Flash Thompson.
Natasha's grey eyes were glassy as she wrapped a large towel over her soaking wet clothes. "You don't need to thank me, Tony. Peter's the closest I'll ever get to having my own child, so… you'll never need to thank me for taking care of him."
"Pardon me, Captain, Agent Romanoff," he said. "But there appears to be a guest waiting at the front gate of the Compound who is requesting access to the residence."
"Oh. Well, that's good, but still—"
“But—!” Peter said, even though deep down he knew JARVIS was right.  So far everything that he’d found could very easily be explained away by coincidence, or an accident, or just people being greedy.
"Sure, I can take a look," said Carol, almost like Steve had asked her to take out the trash or something. "I'll leave now."
Peter was still shaking in his father's arms, his eyes squeezed tightly closed as he tried to force the fact that he was just nearly strangled to death out of his mind.
"Copy that," Steve stammered, cursing himself for not at least being in uniform. Being forced to fight a battle without wearing his proper uniform only served to increase his fear, reminding him way too much of the bunker battle in Miami where he had almost managed to lose both Tony and Peter in the span of only a few seconds.
Rhodey leaned closer, lowering his voice. "O'Brien said that as long as you can come up with all of the simulations that they've asked for, then he'll go ahead and authorise the conversion of three of the X-302 aircraft."
Sliding the final book into his backpack, Peter slammed his locker door closed, huffing in annoyance when the thin metal bent beneath his palm.
Peter grinned as he flipped through the book, finding the page he had marked the night before. "Wanna know where it came from?"
“You're damn right I don't believe you,” Tony cut in.
"Very good, sir."
“It’s—but it’s—!” Papa choked out as tears streamed down his cheeks.  “It looks just like it—!”
"And I also meant what I said to you," Steve said. He tentatively curled his arm around Tony's waist, drawing him closer. "I love you, Tony. I love you and I want to be with you, and I'm so sorry that I almost messed things up, and—"
"JARVIS?" Peter asked as he rolled over, clutching his polar bear to his chest.
But he hasn’t.
"You know what? I don't wanna hear it!" Tony stated, his hands clenching into tight fists. "But I swear to you,
"I see. Can you please explain to my colleagues how exactly the fifth time was the charm?"
As soon as Steve heard the back door close, he slid his arms around Tony’s waist, pulling him close for a kiss.
out of it; he couldn't remember the last time he'd allowed someone to sneak up on him like that. "Captain, do you think you can walk?"
"I can do this all day."
"Yeah, I bet it did," Steve said softly. He narrowed his eyes at the screen as the reporter launched into yet another meandering statement regarding the unexplained phenomenon that had taken place high in the skies over Wakanda. Tony sighed, trying to ignore the high-pitched, nasally drone of the reporter's voice as he repeated himself for the third time.
A knot rose in Steve's throat at his beloved's tone, all no-nonsense and tough, but still with the slight wobble to it that only he and Peter could ever detect.
He sat back as the waiter placed their drinks in front of them, some fancy Italian beer that Steve had wanted to try. Steve reached for his glass as soon as the waiter disappeared, raising it in a toast.
"You're right, sweetheart," Steve whispered as he pulled Tony onto his lap, burying his face in his neck. "He does deserve that. Both he and Bucky deserve to be free of it, but—I just—I just don't know if I'm—if I'm strong enough—if it doesn't work, and we
What if
And since he’s barely keeping up with the bills as it is, he just can’t afford to waste money like that.  Every extra penny Steve has goes towards paying down Ma’s lingering debt, which means he’ll wait until he can get to CVS later to avoid paying the extra three or so dollars for his bottle of OTC pain medication because that’s three more dollars that he can put towards the debts.
"Oh, yeah, I know that," Peter said. "But when can we start?"
"That's exactly what I'm saying!" exclaimed Peter. "'Cause if I don't, pretty soon the enemy's gonna have a weapons system that'll be basically unstoppable!"
“Well, okay.  I’m sure the polar bears will appreciate that, but I just wanted to ask,” Dad said.  He planted a kiss on Papa’s forehead.  “Just let me double-check a few things and we’ll be ready to roll.”
Papa flinched as a shiny blue light suddenly flickered across the lenses of the glasses, his eyes going wide as soft humming noise filled the lab.
"I had another nightmare, early this morning," Steve finally said.
"And I've already told him the same thing," said Dad. He pressed his fingers to his lips, blowing Peter a kiss just like he always used to when he was little. "I love you, bud. I'll see you soon."
And he hadn't been the only one. Mantis, Drax, Quill, and Dr Strange were all still on Titan after Dad and the others disappeared, which probably meant they had been snapped too, along with potentially billions of others.
"Well… Dad hasn't been sleeping all that great lately, and when he doesn't sleep—"
There was a loud growl as Fake Man got to its feet, its armour scratched and dented where it'd hit the floor.
"What do ya think, J?" Tony said as he tossed the hologram into the space next to him. He ran his finger down his goatee, giving the belt design a quick tweak. "You think Steve's gonna like it?"
"Well, I'm definitely that," Peter said with an exaggerated nod. "Absent-minded, I mean."
"Right," Peter said. "So… the plan?"
Stacy hesitated before replying. "Um… to put it delicately, Mr Stark, Captain Rogers is pretty distraught. He has to be in a lot of pain, from the looks of him, and he's also told us that HYDRA has been drugging him, so—"
"And why not?" Tony snapped. "Sorry," he added quickly. "Um… why not?"
"I'm gonna be okay," Peter said firmly. "You don't need to worry about me."
"Hello, Peter!" Mr Stacy called as he poked his head out the window to wave in their direction, with Gwen heaving a sigh. "Nice to see you!"
"Steve… I can't—I mean, I just—
Gwen was openly crying now, dabbing at her eyes with the crumpled-up napkin and half-hiding her face in his shoulder. Peter was debating whether to try and extricate his hand from hers so he could put his arm around her shoulders, when he suddenly felt the all-too-familiar ice bolt race down his spine just as the floor literally started to shake beneath his shoes.
"And you," Tony said, his voice wobbling ever-so-slightly. He frowned, pressing a hard kiss to Steve's temple. "Babe, I know you probably don't wanna hear this, but we need to get you to the hospital too, okay? I've been trying to get your gloves off of your hands ever since we came over here, and… well… honey, they're fused to your skin. The fabric burned into your skin, and from the melted state of your boots I'm pretty sure that your feet are just as bad, so—"
"Absolutely," said Tony. "At most we'll be ten minutes away, and if it helps, I'll even stow one of my suits in the trunk."
Steve's eyes fluttered briefly closed, his hands wrapped tightly around Tony's arm. "I know that, Tony."
Oh well. It was still a very small price to pay for getting to watch his dads get married, an event that Peter had had no intentions of ever being able to witness.
“I’m gonna try and get a read on the entrance!” Tony calls as he suddenly angles downward, approaching the far corner of the building.  But just as he’s about to skim across the top, he bounces off what appears to be some kind of invisible energy shield, nearly knocking him off of his flight path.
"Well…" Steve trailed off, his nervousness evident even thousands of kilometres away in space. "I was—I was gonna wait until I got home to ask you this, but… just in case, I wanted to—"
"Steve, baby,
"Mr Stark!" Gwen said, rather frantically as she tugged on the end of her blonde ponytail. "Um… I was hoping that I could talk to Peter?"
Because the man standing in front of Tony was truly and completely
It was guilt that drove Dad so hard, Peter knew that without a doubt.  For as long as he lived, Dad would never be able to let go of his guilt for “allowing” Obie to do what he did to Papa and his team, no matter what else happened or what Papa or Peter tried to tell him.  Kind of like how Papa’s memories of what happened to him and his team would always be tainted by his own guilt.
"Ready to go?" he asked as Gwen zipped up her bag, offering her his elbow. She took it with a flourish, one that made him laugh as they exited the classroom.
"No, what you need,
Yet another demon in the ever-growing stack that he needed to slay.
Last-minute confessions of love only happen in books, not real life.  And as much as Steve might hate to admit it, even if they’re currently experiencing something out of a goofy science-fiction television show, it’s still real life.
But for someone who was used to risking his life pretty much every single day, somehow confessing to Tony the truth about knowing his son scared Steve badly. Almost as much as the thought of losing Tony.
"This guy really is just a goddamn cheater!" Sam yelled as below them, Thanos raised his blade over his head.
"So I take it that's a yes?" Tony said, gasping when Steve rolled his hips again. He was obviously
"Yeah, yeah, I got some stuff set to move in about twenty minutes 'bout a half a kilometre from here. Don't worry, I said I'd get it moved and I'm gonna get it moved. But now all the convoys are at a halt because someone got a little too interested in the numbers, so until they start moving again, there's not really much I can do. We just gotta wait it out. Shouldn't be too long, though, Stark's too damn impatient for the delay to last too long."
Satisfied with his mental image, Steve opened his eyes and proceeded to spend the next fifty-six minutes sketching a picture of Tony Stark’s face, nearly cursing at his alarm when it went off to end the hour when he hadn't managed to get the crinkles around Tony’s left eye exactly right.
"That's exactly it!" Tony exclaimed. "'Cause we are technically using it as a tunnel, which means we'll be travelling through it just like a ship that's travelling at warp speed."
"Uncle Sam took Uncle Bucky back to the Tower as soon as he got here, little guy," Papa said. "He's gonna take care of him, so you don't need to worry."
"You're all right," Tony said, even as his stomach dropped to his knees. It's what he always said whenever Peter was sick or hurt, no matter how badly, because he simply couldn't fathom the idea that he wouldn't be. "Pete, you're all right."
That had only lasted about half a day, however, and thanks to a couple of fierce scowls and a stern talking-to from Uncle Bucky, and another barrage of questions from Uncle Thor as to why JARVIS was having to relay every single question and answer between them, Peter decided to forgive his dads and attempt to move on.
A world record that still stands, actually.  If Steve was able to take one miniscule victory from his Olympic debacle sixteen months ago, it’s that Alexei Shostakov didn't even come close to breaking his world-record time.
"Why do you think I followed him around so much?" said Uncle Bucky. "He'd pick fights with guys all the time, and I was always afraid that somehow one of 'em would figure it out and really try to kill him."
" he said, very softly. "And the same stuff was happening. The controls were frozen, I didn't know how to land, I radioed for help, all of that was the same."
Apparently Thor wasn't dead after all. Not unless dead Norse gods could still travel by light beams and catch axes almost as tall as Peter.
," he said slowly. "The third engine is a reserve engine that would only be used in the event that the aircraft were to exit the planet's atmosphere."
"No, sir. None," answered Tony.
So instead he just pulled Tony close again, tucking his head under his chin and burying his nose into his husband's hair. He closed his eyes and breathed in, inhaling Tony's scent, allowing it to chase away the demons of fear and panic and remind him that they were in this whole thing together. That no matter what happened, they would always have each other's backs.
"Which is basically what Strange did on Titan," said Tony. "Guy took a sneak peek into all of the possibilities in about three minutes flat."
And just like that, they had lost.
"No, honey,
Bucky shook his head, his eyes flicking nervously up at Tony and then flitting away just as fast. "Хауард," he repeated. "Your—your f-father. Стив and I, we saw him at the World's Fair the night before I shipped out, and he had… he had a floating car."
"Okay, I think I'm good now," Peter said a few heartbeats later. Then he planted his palm on Steve's shoulder and slowly hefted himself up, pausing again for a few seconds once he was standing.
“Yes,” Steve whispered.  “Sam Wilson.  He works at the VA On the Mall in D.C., and he helps… people like me.”
“Yeah, that all depends on who you ask, buddy,” Tony says.  Then he winks at Steve, sending warmth blooming across Steve’s chest that’s so sudden and so shocking that Steve nearly chokes on his own spit.
"I did indeed, sir," JARVIS said. "I shall commence with rendering once your armour is complete."
"Um, did you need something, Gwen?" he asked. "'Cause I'm not really in the mood for talking, so—"
Steve did wonder, though, if the same could be said for his own country's government. Was the President still alive? The Vice-President? Any members of the Cabinet, or Congress, or the Supreme Court? What about local police forces? Prison wardens?
"And how're we planning on informing the people that they're now free?" asked Cam.
“Oh, come off it, Tony!” Obie snapped.  “You know what those damn tabloids say when you show up to those kinda things alone!  It’s not a good look for the company!”
Stepping inside, Peter immediately glanced up, his eyes going wide at the sheer number of books crammed into what appeared to be a no larger than ten-metre by ten-metre space.  Towers of shelves stuffed with books stretched from the impeccably carpeted floor to about a half a metre below the ceiling, with each aisle marked with a hand-drawn sign indicating the genre and the author’s last names, arranged in alphabetical order.  As soon as the door closed behind him, Peter halted, closing his eyes as he drew in a slow, deep breath.  He had always loved the smell of books, and the entire place seemed to be saturated in it.
"Thank you," Steve said, so sincerely that Tony had to blink back tears. Wordlessly, he climbed back onto their bed, taking his usual place in the centre as Steve curled his tall, strong body around him, his arm draped across Tony's waist.
"Uh huh. Be safe."
"His coffee intake increases exponentially," finished Peter. "Yeah, that sounds familiar."
If anyone would have suggested during Steve’s college years that one day he would find himself working at the very same private Manhattan university he had mocked for most of his life, Steve would’ve laughed in their face.  Unfortunately for him, the old saying “beggars can’t be choosers” meant that once Natasha recommended him for the newly-vacated Director of General Athletics position almost exactly a year ago, Steve simply didn't have the option to say no.
Tony's eyes went wide. "So there'd for sure be enough for the containment vessel?"
"Okay, then what about Beck himself?" Steve asked. "He's an engineer, correct?"
"What's so funny?"
"Before
The realisation that JARVIS was offline—and the reason for it—suddenly hit Tony, and he paused his steps, trying to stamp down the uneasiness bubbling up from his gut. The ship had passed through the atmospheric barrier in the middle of his last conversation with Steve, before he could verify that Peter had safely returned to the Tower, and while he knew without a doubt that Steve would ensure Peter was safe before he and the team left for Wakanda, Tony couldn't help but worry about leaving Peter alone in the city with only George Stacy and the drones to guard him.
"Right," Bruce said as he leaned over Tony's shoulder, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose. "But doesn't all that mess with—?"
If Steve hadn't possessed his serum-enhanced eyesight, which was thankfully completely healed following his run-in with the blinding yellow beam, he would have missed the flinch that O'Brien tried very hard—but still failed—to suppress. As it was, the general managed to catch himself before it became too apparent, but the effect was clear. In his arrogance, General O'Brien had completely underestimated Steve.
"And you would be correct, sir," JARVIS interrupted. "That particular code was written to allow Mr Beck to transfer certain project files to a computer server off of the Stark Industries premises."
🔥 = this was so hot/ sweet!
"Did you manage to get him to sleep in time?"
About a hundred different emotions all crossed Peter's face at once, and he scowled, shaking his head.
"Okay?" Steve asked once he was fully sheathed, his eyes squeezing closed when Tony nodded, his arms shaking where they bracketed Tony's head. "Oh gods, Tony, you feel
"Hey," Steve said, all raspy and croaky and way,
Tony had even heard Captain Rogers tease the pilot called Mitchell that if he loved the aircraft so much then he should marry it, a statement that immediately prompted an eyeroll from Tony and launched an entire litany of groans from the rest of the patrol, with Captain Barnes replying that "Stevie apparently needed to brush up on some of his non-military vernacular".
Peter rolls his eyes.  “We’re being really careful, Dad.  I promise.”
Bruce tapped the keyboard again, bringing up the picture of a lanky brown-haired and bespectacled man who appeared to be in his late thirties to early forties.
"We're all teammates here, Scott," Steve said in his Captain's voice. "And there's no need for that kind of formality among teammates."
coming," he said, low and raspy. "Now. As we speak."
“Well, I guess that’s what happens when you're the owner of the largest tech company in the entire world,” Steve said.  “And even more so when that same tech company is making groundbreaking strides almost every single week.”
But Phillips only shook his head. "That's classified, kid. Sorry."
"And again, I'll believe it when I see it." Tony looked up as his office door swung open to reveal Rhodey, a steaming cup of coffee in his hand that Tony immediately lunged for. "Hey, you wanna say hi to Uncle James real quick?"
Steve breathed in again, nuzzling even further into Tony's hair as Tony let out a semi-contented sigh, his ass pressing rather insistently against Steve's already aching erection. Ever since Tony had moved in with him not a day had passed where Steve didn’t wake up so hard it was almost painful. Aside from how much he loved Tony, Steve's physical attraction to him was beyond anything that he'd ever experienced, or even dreamed of. Tony was always talking about Steve being perfect, but to Steve, Tony was the one who was perfect.
"Who?" Tony sputtered, glancing at Steve. "Is… Thanos?"
Tony's fingers twitched, an involuntary response he had whenever Bucky was mentioned that he hadn't quite been able to shake just yet.
Lord, would you like to tell us what exactly you have in mind?"
“No, honey,” Tony gently admonished.  “You know you don't have to thank me.”
the little voice inside his head reminded him.
"Yeah, sure," Tony said with a sigh. "No harm in trying."
And up until about an hour ago, Tony had believed that Steve was as well. But despite his best efforts to keep his heart hardened towards him, Peter's words insisted on reverberating around in his head, like a never-ending echo.
Steve blushed at the compliment, giving Tony that "aw shucks" smile of his that he always gave whenever Tony praised his artistic ability.
"Someone thinks there's too much space in the storage facility?" he asked. "How'd they figure that?"
They were running out of time.
Tony waved an impatient hand. "Yeah, yeah, enough about that. What exactly did Pete design you to do?"
"Just a few bites, maybe three or four," Peter answered. He looked up into his father's worried eyes, kicking himself for not being stronger. This was not going to help ease his fathers' paranoia at all. "And then I threw it all up."
"Does that answer your question?" Steve asked, panting as he pressed their foreheads together. "You're right, mo grá, I am stuck in my own head, and I just need—right now I need—I just need
"I'm sorry, but who the hell are you?" Sam asked as he stepped out from behind Steve, his arms crossed in front of him. "And how did you know where we'd be—?"
"Daddy!" Peter cried, tears stinging his eyes as the word tore through his raw throat like scissors through tissue paper. His Spider Sense was still going haywire, his heart was thudding madly, and his legs were shaking so badly that his knees were practically knocking together. "Daddy! Where are you?"
"Good work, guys, we're heading in," Steve answered. "Sam, have Redwing continue circling above while we're inside the structure."
And yet, something was still wrong.
"Well, yeah, I know it's not perfect or anything," Peter said, rather sheepishly. "But we probably won't be allowed to take pictures once we get there, so—"
"Uh huh," said Peter. "Sounds good."
"Uh huh, Papa," whispered Peter. "Love you too."
"No, no, it's okay, bud. I knew you guys got home 'cause the music cut down, but when you didn't show up I assumed you were doing something with Papa somewhere." He ruffled Peter's hair, blatantly ignoring the fact that Peter was now almost too tall for him to easily do so.
"Oh. Okay," Gwen replied. "Do you know when they're supposed to be back?"
"No, it's not nothing, Peter," Papa said in his Captain's voice. "Not if it's upsetting you."
"Don't think I could say no to that if I tried," Tony murmured. He slid his hands up Steve's back to his shoulders, rolling his hips up to meet Steve's. They were both hard, and despite the fact that he'd already gotten off three times in the last seven or so hours, Tony was more than ready to go again.
Peter's head snapped up as something clicked inside his mind, a half-remembered thought that he couldn't quite place, but had a feeling it meant something important.
"But it wasn't real, Peter!" Gwen said. She pressed her palm over his hand, tilting her head to meet his eyes. "Look at me! I'm right here!"
The line that ended with the command: ЦLtЯ0П
"Exactly," agreed Tony. "But once the kid goes to bed, you're all mine,
Except for Thanos.
All of HYDRA's anger and hatred, and all of their frustration over not yet achieving their ultimate goal of control through fear, it was all about to be channeled directly at Papa.
"How?"
"How many did you see?" asked Quill.
"I'm so sorry, sweetheart," he finally whispered. "How—how can I help? Tell me what to do, you know I'll do anything—"
First, it’s almost eerie how similar Tony is to Brock looks-wise.  Both men have wavy dark hair, brown eyes, and very muscular arms, features that Steve has always found attractive.  Both men also have strong jawlines and nicely-curved backs, although Tony’s ass is definitely rounder than Brock’s.

“Well, I’m pretty sure that whoever owned it before me didn't quite appreciate its value, since I found it in a pawn shop,” said the man.  “Still cost me a pretty penny, but not as much as if I would’ve found it on eBay or something.”
"Oh, r-really?" he stammered. "And why—why do you think they would do that?"
But Pym only stared back, finally giving Maria a cursory nod.
Apparently Obie had been collecting garbage on certain members of the Board for quite awhile, just waiting for the right time to pull it out.
like that to happen ever again.
Stifling a yawn, Peter headed straight for the virtual deposit box where Dad had tried to safeguard JARVIS's programming. Since Peter had designed most of JARVIS in the first place, he already had his own unique set of passwords and encryption codes that allowed him full access to the program without compromising Dad's information, or even revealing that he was in there at all.
"Okay, well, enough about that now," Tony said. "We've got more important things to worry about first."
"You're kidding, right?" Peter asked, making a beeline for the refrigerator, and the huge bottle of orange juice that they replaced every two days or so. Twisting off the cap, Peter was just raising it up to his mouth when he caught Steve's eye. "Um… yeah. I'll, uh, get a glass."
Peter can understand Dad’s need to separate himself from his father, he just wishes Dad didn't feel like he needed to work himself to the bone in order to do it.  He knows it was hard for Dad to grow up under the huge shadow of one of the most prolific weapons’ manufacturers out there, to have his name forever linked with a man whose legacy is building bigger and badder weapons of mass destruction.  And even though Dad hasn’t spoken to his father since Peter was a tiny baby, Peter knows Dad still feels like he’s trapped under that shadow until he can come up with something that is completely his own.
"We're gonna be taking a break for a while once we get back. About six weeks, like we did last summer," he said instead. "So if you guys want to make some plans, then now would be the time."
As soon as the bathroom door closed behind Peter, Steve leaned in. "Do you really think he's okay? I know all the scans and tests and stuff said he was, but… you know him better than anyone."
"Oh," said Steve as he reached for a second banana. Of course Peter would be missing Gwen, and she, him. Even if it technically had only been a few days since they'd last seen each other.
“Not too many kids your age have a butterfly stroke that’s that smooth, Peter,” Mr Rogers says once Peter pops his head up.  “You seem to have a lot of natural talent.”
And Sam was right; Tony was waiting for him when he got there, propped up on the bed with his tablet in one hand and the coffee Steve had brought him in the other. As soon as Steve stepped inside he set them both down, folding his hands into his lap as Steve tugged off his t-shirt and sat down next to him.
Letting out a heavy sigh, Peter dropped his head back down, trying to ignore the throbbing in his broken finger.  He had been trying to go without his pain pills since they made him so loopy, but he also knew if he kept pushing it, Dad would get even more hyper than he already was.
Placing his misshapen polar bear carefully on his pillow, Peter hefted himself off the bed and headed back out to the living room to find Uncle Bucky waiting patiently, the chessboard set up on the coffee table and two bottles of Dr Pepper sitting beside it.
“But, Daddy,” Peter said, his small, quivering voice tearing off tiny shards of Steve’s heart.  “Daddy, it’s not—it’s not that bad.  It doesn’t even hurt that much, and—Steve, he couldn't help it—he didn't mean to!”
that I'll ever give up on my son." He sucked in another deep breath, forcibly removing his hands from Howard's robe as he took a step back, briefly squeezing his eyes closed. It would not do well for him to self-combust right before his date.
That plus the fact that lately it seemed like Uncle Thor was the only member of Peter's family who even remembered how strong he was, and let him use his strength, made him even more likely to want to listen to him. Uncle Thor never seemed to go out of his way to baby him, which Peter really, really appreciated.
Because, like it or not, what he'd told Dad earlier had been the absolute truth. The system they had developed wouldn't only benefit Langara, it would benefit the entire planet.
Peter said on a gasp. "Dad, are you hearing this? This guy… he's just—just—!"
he thought miserably.
It was the smell of his beloved husband, and now he had him
"Well… yeah…" Steve said. That was no exageration, he really did stink at poker. "But I don't understand what that has to do with Tony."
“Well, then it’s settled,” says Mr Rogers.  He stands to his feet, offering his hand first to Dad, whose cheeks turn pink as he takes it, and then to Peter.
"Okay."
"I have become rather adept at using this stone, Stark," Dr Strange said, rather arrogantly. "I highly doubt that would happen."
Dugan. Morita. Falsworth. All teammates of Steve's that he'd lost in the three years since he had first qualified for the program, and all deemed unavoidable accidents as a result of testing experimental aircraft.
Steve shakes his head as he studies his apple juice bottle.  “Nat, there’s really nothing to tell.  Yes, I thought he was handsome, but… I—I just don't think that—”
"Yeah, I know," Peter mumbled into Papa's chest. He tilted his head up, opening one eye so he could glance over at Dad. Despite Papa's presence, his sleep was not a peaceful one, with his forehead etched in deep worry lines and his lips curled into a frown.
Peter's brown eyes were glassy with tears. "But Papa, I can heal just fine on my own! Please, it's Dad we need to worry about, and I wanna stay with him!"
Our boys have finally met!  And here we go! 😉
protested Tony. "Which is why I want you to get started like right now!"
"Besides," Tony added. "It's probably best to have a snazzy new suit for your first meeting with a prince, right?"
No more being plunged into the darkness every night, so only a select few can stay in the light. No more denying people basic rights, like a life-saving surgery, just because someone else doesn't believe that he's a person worthy to keep alive. And no more divided societies of military vs civilians! We are all in this together, and we must all work together in order to survive!"
"It'll be okay, honey," he repeated as Peter shuffled over to the car, yawning so widely that Tony was afraid that his jaw had come unhinged.
"Copy that," Steve murmured. He drew in a deep breath as he glanced around the circle, at his teammates who he had come to love as though they were his own brothers and sisters. Natasha, Clint, Bruce, Thor, and James, who had been there from the very beginning, Pietro, who had become the son Clint had never thought he'd have, and Scott, Gamora, Nebula, and Rocket, who were all there because they believed in the Avengers, believed that their team could actually return things back to normal.
Steve gave a not-quite-modest shrug. "I'm actually not too bad at it. I did most of the cooking when I was growing up since Ma was always working so much."
"Um… you said that you've got a plan?" Peter said, still just as low and tentative. He'd always been too perceptive for his own good. "I'm only asking 'cause Gamora here seems to think that Thanos is gonna show up kinda soon, so we probably should figure out what we're gonna do before then."
Gwen sniffed, covering Peter's hand as she nodded. "Okay. But what about you?"
"Well, that was the plan," said Steve. "Why, do you have some information that might help us?"
yelled Steve. But his words had no bite to them, his voice cracking on the final word, and he managed to maintain his composure for about three more seconds before his face completely crumpled and he pitched forward. Tony managed to catch him just before he hit the floor, guiding him over to the far wall where he sat them down, removing the shield and Steve's cowl.
"Tony hasn't even noticed," Steve spat out, instantly hating himself for speaking so badly about his husband. "He—he can't. He's so locked up inside his own mind that he—he—"
After a lifetime of war, it was the happy ending that no one could have predicted.
Tony smirked as he pointed to the smaller central engine bell tucked down underneath the larger dual bells of the regular engines, noticing that Mr Muscles's fierce glare had been almost entirely replaced with an aura of boyish excitement.
"You're right, you know," he said, his voice quavering. "You're absolutely right, but I—I don't—I just don't know
Which, if Peter was honest, didn't really narrow things down all that much. Dad had made more than a few enemies during the years that he was making weapons, and they probably didn't just disappear once he stopped.
It was still neck in neck.
"Honey,
"It won't hurt at all, Uncle Bucky, I promise," Peter added when Bucky hesitated. "And it only takes a second."
"Sure, bud. Where do you want me?"
Bucky's head jerked back. "Whoa, just hold on a second. You're telling me that someone's refusing to operate on a sick kid just because… well… why, exactly?"
Reaching for the bag of homemade trail mix that he and Peter had made the day before and a bottle of Powerade, Steve shoved a handful into his mouth as he unzipped the special pocket that Tony sewed into his uniform, looking for the small sketchbook and pencil that he always carried with him. He opened it to the front page, to the sketch of Tony and Peter that he'd drawn from the very first photograph he'd ever taken of the two of them, only hours after Peter had taught him how to take pictures with his new phone. Steve's throat tightened as he examined it, which he attempted to remedy with a big sip of his Powerade. Even now, after taking literally thousands of photographs, and sketching and painting dozens of drawings, this little drawing was still one of Steve's very favourite sketches of his beloved husband and son.
"Congratulations, guys," Tony said. "I bet Pete was thrilled too."
And once they were back, safe and sound in their Tower penthouse, with Steve's healing foot carefully propped up on pillows on their bed and he and Peter cuddled up in his arms, Tony laid his head down against Steve's chest and closed his eyes, finally allowing his tense, exhausted body to relax for the first time in over a month.
“Language,” Steve says weakly, relief washing over him like a wave.  At least he knows that Tony’s still alive.
He could tell Steve was nervous by his ramrod-straight back and tight set of his jaw, but no one who didn't know him well would've been able to tell. To the outside world he just looked like Captain Steve Rogers, war hero and leader of the Avengers, and Tony's sexy-as-hell husband.
"Honey, I think we need to—"
"Steve?"
And Peter had no doubt that he'd be able to see Dad through the pain of losing him.
"Now I've got you, you son of a bitch!" Steve heard as he pushed himself up onto his hands and knees, trying to catch his breath. His ears were still ringing from the various gunshots and explosions, and it took a couple of heartbeats for Steve to process why the voice sounded so familiar, and who it belonged to.
“Jesus fucking Christ!” Tony muttered as soon as the door had closed.  He pinched the bridge of his nose, gulping down over half of his coffee before pressing the intercom button for Pepper’s office.
"The dance!" Peter exclaimed, quickly smashing his face into his polar bear. The dance would be the perfect opportunity since none of his family members would be there and wouldn't be expecting him home for a few hours. It would mean skipping out on Gwen, and Peter felt a sharp pang of guilt at the thought of disappointing her again, but… hopefully she would be able to forgive him once she understood what he was doing.
"Or at least, no one has officially heard from him since," said Colonel Rhodes.
"Cap!" Uncle Sam called from above. "Cap, these guys are still coming, what should we do?"
He had done some research, as he usually did whenever he had a question about something, and had read on several popular medical websites that people struggling with grief and depression often had very little interest in sex.
"Dictionary opened, Master Peter," said JARVIS. "May I inquire as to what you are doing?"
"Really?" Scott asked with wide eyes. "And they actually found him?"
"Copy that," Sam said. "Seventeen—"
what we're doing, Clint," Steve said in his Captain's voice. "We'll be right out."
Reaching for his bottle of ibuprofen, Steve quickly pops four of the gelcaps and resumes his writing, ending Peter’s Friday practise with a short series of goal fifties that Steve plans on having him complete butterfly.  Once thirty minutes have passed, Steve sets down his notebook and clenches his jaw as he slowly raises his left arm in the air.  After counting out five Brooklyns, he brings his right arm up to join it, trying to keep his breathing steady as he psyches himself up for the final move.
Grinning, Joseph tilted slightly as he shifted around the mountain, rechecking his fuel gauge as he dipped into a wide crevasse, skimming just above the surface. Hopefully Colonel O'Brien would be too distracted by the ceasefire announcement to notice just how low he'd managed to run the fuel again. The X-101s were the most smooth and maneuverable aircraft that Joseph had ever flown—not to mention just downright
A point he had experienced again after the snap, on the day he feared he had not only lost his son, but also his husband. The day that he punched his shield.
interrupted Uncle Bucky as the nurse began pushing him out of the room.
"Yes, sir," Steve breathed, his cheeks flaming hot as Tony sauntered back towards his lab, all perfectly mussed brown hair, back as straight as a ballet dancer, lean, toned limbs, and the most beautifully round ass that Steve had ever seen.
"Ahh, are you—are you—holy
the little voice whispered.
Uncle Bucky's voice trailed off then, and he looked down at his metal hand, flexing his fingers. "Before the serum he thought that his asthma would kill him by the time he was thirty, which probably wasn't too far off. It's one reason why he was so damn insistent about enlistin'; he figured if he was gonna die young that he may as well die doing somethin' that he thought was worthy." He paused again, shooting Peter an odd look. "And then afterwards… well… Back then, the time when we came from, it—it wasn't allowed, without a wife, or—he would've been—"
"What the hell…?" Dad muttered under his breath as Antennae Lady started jumping up and down in the lower gravity, a wide, childish smile on her face. "I sure hope Thor hurries his ass up, we could definitely use the help."
"That's what I've always thought, but… lately I've been wondering if it meant something even more than that." Steve pursed his lips, giving his head a quick shake. "But that's a conversation we can have another time."
Peter had just pulled out his two laptops to start working on the HYDRA files when JARVIS announced that his dads were on the line. He quickly hid the computers under his blankets, running a nervous hand through his hair as he grabbed his tablet.
"Do you think you'll be in school tomorrow?"
Peter rolled his eyes. "I didn't say that you were trying to hurt him, did I?"
"I know," Peter said, swallowing hard. "And yeah, I think I'd be okay. Gwen doesn't know about the ice, so…"
And now came the hard part. Convincing Phillips had been relatively easy since he was sick and tired of the constant war. Convincing the rest of the military government, though, would not be.
“I’m not in love with Bucky, Tony,” Steve says firmly.  “I never have been.  He was my best friend as a kid.  Saved my life more times than I can count, and he doesn’t deserve what HYDRA’s done to him.  But I’m not in love with him.  I’m in love with you.  You and Peter, you're my family.”
When Tony doesn't answer, Steve clears his throat.  “Tony?  Do you have any ideas on where we might be?”
Steve thought.
Steve tilted his head, chuckling as he ran his fingertip along the lid of his cup. "Well, I've kinda been what Peter might call a hobbit this morning."
“You found it in Ireland?” Peter asked, aghast.
"Uh huh," Peter said as he checked the wall clock. "It should hopefully be starting in about ten minutes or so."
"The Avengers are a family as well, sir," Peter said, his voice trembling despite his best efforts to keep it steady. "My parents are married just like you and Mrs Stacy, and while my aunt and uncles aren't related to me by blood, that doesn't mean that I love them any less. And just because my papa and Uncle Bruce are enhanced it doesn't mean they're not people, just like the rest of us."
"Thank you," Steve answered as he gave Peter's hand a quick squeeze, then placed it carefully under his blanket and turned to Bruce. "But whoever that is out there, he doesn't come within five metres of Peter, understand? Code green?"
"No," replied Dr Strange as he shook dust from his long maroon cloak. "Well, yes, actually, he did. But now it doesn't matter anymore."
The last thing Steve needs is for his shoulder to become locked.  Then he’d never be able to get back on his motorcycle.
Without another word, Tony crossed the room to the door and left, making a beeline across the base to his office. He'd just barely managed to get the door closed before the tears began to fall, streaming down his face in hot, salty rivulets. He wanted so badly to believe Steve, believe that he'd meant it when he'd said that he loved him, believe that it was all just some wacky coincidence that Steve had met Peter before he'd even realised who he was, but—
"You had another bad dream, didn't you."
"It's just writing, Dad, something I do all the time anyway," Peter answered. "It's not like I'm doing much of anything else."
"You guys got something?" Natasha asked.
"Okay, JARVIS, let's see if we can get a basic backbone here, yeah?"
Peter dropped his head, tracing his fingertip around the edge of the chessboard.
"His head, if it wasn't attached?" Steve said, attempting to smile.
"Tony,
Steve thought, giving his head a hard shake.
"Oh, yeah," Bucky said with a short laugh. "Dumb question." He cleared his throat, leaning even closer. "I've—um… I've been doing some ring shopping lately. Our anniversary is coming up in about four months, and I thought… if he's been able to put up with me this long, then, you know… maybe he'd be willing to put up with me forever."
It wasn't that Tony didn't have a plan. It was just that he felt like he was being forced to involve Peter against his will. Objectively, Tony knew how strong his son was, and how well he could handle himself in the field—or rather, in the safety-controlled field that was the Avengers' training dome up at the Compound. He also knew that Peter had managed to find and break into HYDRA's secret—and very much
Flash's tanned skin immediately went pale, his throat bobbing as he attempted to swallow. "Yeah, whatever. At least I don't need an actual god to stick up for me. And you're just trying to assert your new authority as Decathlon Captain whenever you get the chance, aren't you, Stacy?"
As soon as the serum infusion was completed, Sharon hurried back to Peter's side, removing the infusion apparatus and disconnecting the ventilator. Then she closed the sides and the top of the capsule, sealing Peter inside.
"Okay, okay," Tony said carefully as he crouched down, looking up at the obviously disturbed wizard. "You're back now. You're all right."
And every single one of them always had an open door for Peter as well, pretty much whenever he needed one. It was a massive weight off of his and Tony's shoulders to know that if one or both of them got held up somehow, that any number of their teammates could jump right in to pick him up from school or something.
"Okay, Papa, I think I've got it," Peter said once he was done. He smiled as he scrolled through the various photos on his camera screen, thinking they would work great in the photo book he was planning to put together after the wedding. "I'm gonna go get some pictures of Dad now, okay? That way you'll get to see what he looked like before the ceremony."
"Uh huh. Love you too."
Because he did. If anyone understood the constant need to remain by his loved one's bedside while they were sick or injured, it was Tony.
"No, he sure wouldn't, big guy," he said, his lower lip trembling. Not too long before he was taken, Steve had given the team one of his famous Captain America pep-talks at the end of one of their training sessions, talking about how they all worked together as a synergistic system, the kind of system that was the most efficient and least likely to break down.
As Papa liked to say sometimes, he needed to get his head out of the clouds and be aware of his surroundings.
"Thank you, sir. I appreciate that very much."
"Sheppard here," said John.
"Okay, but I fail to see why we would need such a feature," said Rogers, a deep frown forming between his perfectly-shaped eyebrows. "Unless—"
"You got it," she said. "On to History."
"There are three left, Captain!" she said as she lifted off from the ground, using her levitation power to fly back towards her brother and Natasha.
"Steve?" Natasha said, softly, but still enough to cause Steve to startle. "Steve, this could do it! This could bring everybody back!"
"Which means we'd better get the hell moving," said Peter.
"Okay," Steve said, heaving a relieved sigh.
Steve's heart lurched as T'Challa called out a command to his warriors, all of whom instantly stood at attention. Then he stepped forward three steps, planting his feet as Steve joined him, shield at the ready.
Tony blinked, fighting the urge to roll his eyes.
"He knows that, and he said he's really sorry about what happened," Peter cut in. "He told me he's even quit drinking because of it. Said he dumped all the whisky down the drain after we left the house."
Peter curled his shoulders, trying to burrow further down into his jacket as he pulled his hat down to cover his ears. It had to have been zero degrees or colder outside, and with the rapidly setting sun Peter was already starting to shiver. He'd have to ask Dad if they could make the heater in his suit adjustable somehow.
“That’s ‘cause he’s the smart one,” Tony says, causing Steve to smile at the abject pride in Tony’s voice.  Peter Stark truly is an amazing child, one of the sweetest that Steve’s ever met in his life, and Steve loves it when Tony brags about him.
Tony thought.
Steve hadn’t even swam the relays yet, and still Ma somehow knew he would win.
Instantly, Steve backed away, his entire body violently shaking as he watched Tony gather Peter into his arms, his eyes shooting darts in Steve’s direction as he cradled Peter’s left hand in his own, his pinky finger grotesquely bent and starting to swell.
“Monday morning, bud, all right?” said Dad.  “As soon as I drop you off at school.  I just… wanna make sure I’ve got all my ducks in row with this rifle and bullet stuff first.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter watched carefully as the camera panned along the coastline, afraid to even blink in case he might miss something. But after three hours had passed with nothing but more waves and birds to show for it, Peter was both exhausted and fried, and still behind on his homework.
"Are you Howard Stark, sir?" said the larger of the two Safety Officers as he pulled his ID badge from his breast pocket.
"What do you suggest?" he finally asked. "You—you know him better than I do, so… I'll go along with whatever you want to tell him."
"You're gonna stay with me for the rest of my life, and you're gonna love me," Tony said as he began trailing kisses all along Steve's neck and chest while Steve fumbled to turn on the shower. Steve caught his wrists in his hands, stopping him just long enough to get them inside, backing Tony up against the tiled wall.
And when he just happened to sneak in one of his sly winks,
"And something would be correct, honey," Tony replied. "I'm guessing that's probably around the time when Smythe was 'medically discharged'."
"I told you," Uncle Bucky cut in. "I sent Sam home to get some sleep. Guy was exhausted."
A knot rose in Steve's throat, one that he hastily attempted to swallow down. He understood completely where Stacy was coming from. It was a father's job to protect his children from harm, to keep them as safe as possible. And as a police officer, Steve suspected that it had to be especially difficult for Stacy to not be able to protect his daughter from the Avenger-level events that tended to occur far more frequently than Steve wished.
Tony's lips quirked into a soft smile. "Ah, I've still got a bit of programming to do, and then I need to go over the patrol reports from last night and this morning, but then—"
Peter huffed as he pocketed the phone, shooting the ceiling a deep scowl. "Gee, thanks, JARVIS. You're such a big help."
"All right, then," Steve said, his lips pursed in determination. "Here's what we're gonna do."
At first Steve was too choked up to reply, shocked almost senseless by Peter’s overt display of affection.
"Ned! Not so loud!" Gwen hissed. "No one's supposed to know about this!"
"Well, you did an exceptional job," Steve said. He patted Peter on the shoulder as his cowl retracted, momentarily surprising him. He wasn't used to not having to remove it himself. "I'm very proud of you both."
"Nope," said Tony. "They didn't."
"Well, he's got a pretty good example for a father," Steve said as he reached for Tony's hand.
"Captain Rogers!" Colonel Phillips called—or rather, yelled—through his open office door, which just happened to be only a few doors down from the computer lab. "A word, if you don't mind?"
Hence the need for coffee.
Because they were about to embark on a mission that would not only change their entire world, it would also save their son's life.
"Okay. Could that someone be Adrian Toomes, for example?"
"Yeah, right," Peter said with a frown. "You don't really expect me to believe that, do you?"
Peter said, because he did.  Papa had spent the last year showering both Peter and Dad with so much love and affection that sometimes Peter felt like he might drown in it.  He’d even booked a table at their very favourite restaurant on Peter’s fourteenth birthday, the Friday before Obie’s trial began, just so he could ask Peter if it was okay for him to formally adopt him.
Painfully hoisting himself out of the water, Steve reaches for his towel, pointedly ignoring looking over at Shostakov as he preens for the crowd.  As he drapes the towel across his neck, he wishes he didn't have the reputation of being such a good sport.  That way he could have an excuse for simply walking past Shostakov and a whooping and yelling Bucky Barnes, and no one would think twice about it.
"Right," said Tony. "We definitely don't wanna dance with this guy, we just want the gauntlet. 'Cause I figure if we can get the glove off, then all our wizard friend has to do is portal either it or him off into space or something, and we've won."
of the polished military shoes against the carpeted floor and the soft jingles of medals a soothing backdrop to what otherwise might have felt like a final walk down death row.
Not too bad of a haul for a soon-to-be high school senior.
A hope so fragile that it couldn't yet even be whispered, out of fear it would simply vanish again.
Sucking in a deep breath, Strange locked eyes with Tony. "I went forward in time, to view alternative futures, to see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict."
"Yep," Tony stated. "You're damn right."
“I don't doubt that for a second,” Mr Rogers says.  He attempts another smile, his fingers tapping anxiously on the tabletop.  “My fee is one hundred dollars a week, paid every four weeks.  We’ll try it for one month and reevaluate after that.  Practises will be Monday through Friday for two hours a day, and once I feel Peter is ready, I’ll schedule him to participate in a meet, which are held on weekends.  Does four o’clock work all right for the two of you?”
"True," said Bucky as he shut off his shower. "So, is it worth asking if you wanna join the rest of us for some card games before dinner, or do you need to go clear your head again?"
"It's Latin, and it means, 'I remember the living, and I can't forget the dead'," Uncle Bucky said. "Сэм taught it to me, said it was fitting since I'll always be trying to get back what HYDRA stole from me, and at the same time I'll never be able to fully let go of what I did."
"You are most welcome, sir."
“And as Iron Man, who just happens to be one of the Avengers—you know, that team of superheroes that Captain America’s in charge of?  The team who saved New York City when goddamn
🔥 = this was so hot/ sweet!
"You just need to hush so they can fix you up, okay?" said Tony. "We'll go up and see him as soon as we can."
Steve audibly gulped. "You saw me?"
"I know you're not the only one," said Steve. "Tony?"
The corners of Dad's lips quirked up into the slightest of smiles. "Sure thing. Go on and brush your teeth, yeah?"
"Hey, little guy," Steve said fondly as he took a seat on the block-like chair. He placed his free hand on Peter's shoulder, his blue eyes begging for forgiveness. "Peter, I am so, so sorry that I put you in the position of having to lie for me. That was very selfish of me, and something that I should never have done."
"Mr Wilson's vehicle will arrive inside the Tower garage in approximately three minutes, sir," said JARVIS.
And not at all what he would've expected from the son of Howard Stark, the infamous Langaran traitor.
Peter smiled again as he set down his plate, leaning back in his chair just as Uncle Thor erupted into another round of raucous cheering. The Rangers had scored a goal.
Gwen shrugged. "Eh, you know. Just another typical school day."
"Sure ya didn't," Bucky said, rolling his eyes when Sam shot him a warning look. "Look, we're just a bit concerned is all. We've never seen you like this, and we've gotta admit that it's kinda throwing us off."
"Okay, honey, okay," Tony murmured as Steve kissed down to his neck, latching onto his pulse point as his hand slipped under Tony's ass, pressing their hips together. "I've got you, babe. I've got you."
"Nope, I'm good," answered Steve. "Numbers are good, JARVIS says I'll reach the atmosphere in fourteen seconds."
"Displaying it for all the world to see," said Steve. "Yeah, I got it."
Switching off the receiver, Peter placed it on his bedside table and grabbed his notebook, laying back against his pillows. A proud smile stretched across his lips as he flipped through the pages, landing on the lines of code he'd just completed earlier that day.
As soon as O'Brien returned the salute Steve turned on his heel and headed for the exit, his mind racing at MACH-1 as he headed back towards the barracks. Colonel Phillips had informed him that he could take his usual place in the patrol shift once he was done meeting with the general, but he needed to change first. There was no way he could comfortably fly while wearing his bulky dress uniform.
"Was it because of your heart?" Steve asked.
books?”
"Oh, yeah," Bucky said with a frown. "Not that it was worth seeing or anything."
Once again, thank you so much to my wonderful betas jehbeeeh and allthesinnersandallthesaints.  You guys are awesome! 💗
"He was afraid that you'd bar him from seeing me again if I told you," said Peter. "But Dad, please don't do that. He doesn't really have anything else to do, and—"
"Oh gods, this isn't happening," Tony cried. He pressed his palm to his chest, his heart threatening to break through. "This can't be happening, Rhodey! I only talked to him a few hours ago!"
Tony had even asked Sam that question a few times since he'd moved into the Tower, but not even he had a decent answer for it. His standard answer was that it was his job to help the team move forward from the whys and the what ifs, not to dwell on them.
Madison Square Garden was already packed to the gills as Peter, Gwen, and their three chaperones made their way through the winding concourse up towards the luxury boxes. Uncle Thor was leading the way, but since he was pausing every few seconds to sign an autograph or smile for a photograph, it was taking literally forever for them to get to their seats.
"Oh, I definitely am," added Steve, wincing as soon as the words left his mouth. Bucky was right; he was
Bucky's eyes went wide, then narrowed. "No, I wasn't late—hold on. Did Sam really tell you I was an hour late?"
General Okoye peaked over at Steve from around T'Challa. "And how do we do that?"
"Tony—!"
"But it's not okay!" Peter rasped against Tony's soaking wet chest. "Daddy, I was just—I only wanted to help, but now—we're not—we're not ever gonna—!"
Which meant that his pissed-off, I'm-Iron Man-so-don't-fuck-with-me voice was more like he was screaming into about a dozen bullhorns, scraping along Peter's already frazzled nerves like Papa's favourite cheese grater.
The corners of Ma's lips twitched. "I figured that was the case when you brought him over," she said. "Your father proposed to me only a couple of days after he introduced me to his ma and papa."
said Tony's answering shrug. All of Peter's heart and lung scans had come back completely normal, and both Sarah and Sharon had checked his vital signs numerous times since the procedure and pronounced him perfectly fine, but both Tony and Steve could tell that something was still a bit… off.
completely regained his senses, but that, Tony decided, was currently beside the point.
"Everything going okay in here?"
"Yeah, probably," Peter muttered as he flopped over again, facing the ceiling.
Tony's lower lip shook as he glanced down at Steve's chest. "Yeah, honey," he whispered. "I'd—I'd like that."
Tipping his head back, Steve closed his eyes as his aircraft breached the barrier, his hands firm but pliable on the controls as his entire cockpit shook with turbulence. This was by far his least-favourite part of the whole flying into space thing, and he was very relieved for JARVIS's help as he allowed the computer system to guide him through.
"Yeah, I know," said Peter. "Um… is Dad still working on the SHIELD stuff?"
"No, no, no!" Peter cried as he struggled to free himself from the vice-like grip of the thing's metal claws as it flew higher and higher, until he was at least twenty metres up and directly over the lake.
"Thank you," Steve said as Shuri gave a gentle but insistent tug on his arm.
"It's a wormhole to another universe!" yelped Peter, yanking so hard on Papa's elbow that he nearly pulled him down. "Papa, you've got to listen to me! Before I came through the portal, Dr Strange told us that he'd seen what could happen when powerful beings drew even more power from other dimensions or universes! So I think—!"
"Steve, I
Gwen huffed, her shoulders sagging as she picked up her trigonometry textbook. "Yeah, it probably was. Sorry."
And if
"Just one more," Peter muttered as he selected another file, this one a bit larger than the two previous ones he had decoded earlier that night. After that first initial evening, Peter had decided that it was too dangerous to work on the files while his dads were still awake, so for the past three nights he had been going to sleep at his usual bedtime, then setting an alarm to wake him up at 1am and working for as long as he was able to keep his eyes open.
“All right, on second thought, I’m not sure this is all that helpful,” Tony said a few minutes later, after about the umpteenth photo.  He scrubbed his palm down his face, tapping his chin.
A pained look crossed Grandma's lightly lined face, just for a moment before disappearing.
"Yes, and also because public opinion hasn't exactly been swayed in their favour yet," said Sam. "No matter what the news has been saying, I hear stuff when I'm out running and there's still plenty of folks out there who aren't buying what they're trying to sell."
"Ah, well, like I said. He would've loved you."
"Except that Mr Wizard here is the one who's got the Time Stone," said Dad. "So, yeah, Thanos is probably coming here."
"Yeah, I'm pretty sure one or two of my uncles would agree," Gwen said. "And my grandpa too."
Like trying to figure out how to defend the planet against another alien invasion.
And what in the hell happened during the four years between those two races that caused Steve Rogers, arguably the most beautiful man Tony has ever seen, to transform from a happy-go-lucky elite swimmer into the sad and jaded man that he and Peter met earlier that day?
"When did you realise that Sam was… was the one?" Steve asked, biting his lip.
"You got it. Talk to you then."
"Ah huh. You at least got to see him the other day, didn't you?"
Just then the glasses activated, projecting an image of a dark, dank, bunker-like building. Steve gasped as soon as he saw it, grabbing onto Tony's shoulder.
"Come in?" said Tony, his eyebrows shooting up when Colonel Phillips, Rhodey, and Sam all came into the room, assembling at the foot of Steve's bed.
Tony huffed out a sharp breath, his fingernails digging into Steve's biceps. "I need that gorgeous mouth of yours on me, babe," he choked out. "And, like, as soon as possible."
"Daddy, what're they gonna do to him?" Peter cried into his father's chest. "Oh God, they're gonna hurt him, aren't they? They're gonna hurt my Papa?"
Did a father stop being a father after the death of his child?
Uncle Bucky choked out what sounded kinda like a laugh. "Yeah. I guess I do."
"Regardless of who can actually access this place," said Steve. "You do believe that Thor is correct? That this Soul Stone might be tied in somehow to your Ancestral Plane?"
He had to make sure that the arc reactor didn't flicker into nothingness, not even for one single second.
"Ohh," Peter breathed as he took off his hoodie and pulled on the sweatshirt on, closing his eyes as he burrowed down into it. It even smelled like Gwen, like she had sprayed it with her perfume or something before she mailed it.
"Everything ready out here?" Steve asked as he exited the panic room, stepping up between Peter and Tony. "Bucky says he's as ready as he'll ever be, so…"
"But of course you are," Tony said with a laugh.
"Thank you," Peter murmured. "That's really nice of you to say." He paused for a moment, still chewing on his lip. "Um… what did you mean when you asked if I was good at keeping secrets?"
"Oh my God," he whispered as he squeezed his eyes closed, drawing in a deep breath through his nose.
"And once we do? Then what?"
They had at least been able to rule out a few places thanks to the scouting raids conducted by Uncle Bucky, Uncle Clint, and Auntie Nat on several HYDRA coastal strongholds throughout Eastern Europe and Russia. Western Europe was more difficult to cover, as it wasn't as easy to slip in and out of those countries even with just the three of them. So far they had been able to rule out the countries along the Mediterranean coastline, but that still left a lot of European ground uncovered, which Director Fury—along with Pepper, since Stark Industries had offices in many of those countries—was trying to help cover using some of his old spy connections.
"Oh, sorry," Clint said in a more normal voice. "Hearing aid must've gotten jostled loose."
Or at least, he sure as hell hoped not.
"Losing my family," Steve said quickly, squeezing his eyes closed when the tears threatened to fall. "Growing up, I never thought I'd—I was always so sick and weak, and I thought I'd die before… and then afterwards, in my time it wasn't—wasn't allowed, so… And now, I have—I have this amazing husband and an incredible son, everything that I never thought I could have, and I love them both so much, but then I almost
Once they arrived in Wakanda, though, they would be on their own, as the devices would not be connected to the JARVIS of the past.
Steve gave a sheepish shrug. "I'm sure the rest of the team won't mind having that week off. Sam's mentioned wanting to take Bucky down to New Orleans to meet his family soon, so…"
Steve attempted to swim that race even though his arm was injured, and maybe even made the injury worse in the process.
"And I'm kinda one myself," Peter said as he lifted his head. "Well, at least on weekends."
"Yeah, of course you would be," Bucky said. "'Cause you're mean."
"Okay, but you can fix it, right?" Steve asked, his panic already spiking again. "Because we need to know who did this, and why, and—"
"Tony?" Pepper asked. "What's going on?"
To Peter's relief, the door swung open easily. As he and Ned stepped over the threshold, Peter fought against the urge to cover his ears against the blare of the music, kicking himself for not remembering his earplugs.
"No, Daddy, please!" Peter cried as Tony hurried towards the door, his pathetic voice squeezing Tony's heart like a vise. "Please don't take me away, I don't wanna go!"
"Yeah, well… maybe I'm just trying to not be so type-A all the time," Peter retorted. He didn't want to admit just how much time he was wasting daydreaming about Gwen. "Like I said, I'll start on it this weekend."
"Yep. And not exactly something you'd think a pilot would be into, right?"
"Yes," Steve said as he trailed his thumb across Tony's cheekbone. He was already dreading having to let him go. "Yes, I'll be here."
"Hold on, that was you?" Tony asked, scowling. "And what the hell were you doing with Peter? I told you to stay away from him!"
Unfortunately, even though he'd already sent three balls sailing over Bucky's head in left-centerfield the ache was still there, like a loose thread in his flight suit that was just sharp enough to chafe his skin if he moved the wrong way.
"Signal activated, Master Peter," replied JARVIS, just as quietly. "Do you require any further assistance?"
"Yeah," Tony whispered, trying to smile.
"Then why don't you try and get some more sleep, and I'll see you when I get back, hmm?" Steve asked, flashing that million-credit smile that never failed to cause Tony's heart to flutter.
"But it's right, right?" Tony interrupted. "I mean, even the scriptwriters didn't make this stuff up for the show, they got it from actual scientists."
"Yeah," he finally whispered. "Okay." He cleared his throat, tucking his head back under Steve's chin. "But that confounded noise doesn't mean that you have to get up or something now, does it?"
"Yeah, but he's not just some uncle, he's
"What?" he said, squeezing Peter so hard that he grunted. But Strange was already gone, his final words lingering in the still-settling dust.
, that they were out there, wherever
Steve's lips pressed together in what Tony had come to recognise as his
"We can all help keep an eye on Peter, Steve," said Natasha. "But you know he won't need it. He can hold his own just as well as any of us."
“Eh, I'd call it more of a lull.  It happens from time to time,” says Dad.  He curses under his breath as he swerves to avoid a delivery bicyclist trying to make a left-hand turn from the right-hand sidewalk.  Then he tosses Peter a rather self-satisfied look, waggling his eyebrows.  “‘Specially when I got to spend most of last week playing with a ‘12 Aventador.”
"You're not sure if we can really trust anyone in a law enforcement position right now," Tony finished. "Right?"
Covering his mouth with his hand, Tony headed down the short hallway to his bedroom, relieved to find it spared the catastrophic condition of the rest of the house. He quickly crossed the room to open the window, gulping in a few lungfuls of the cooling night air.
"Thanks," he murmured before shoving the entire handful into his mouth, ignoring the far-too-sharp
"Yes, Master Peter?"
"Pete—"
books!”  Peter pulled out the box, showing it to Dad as he pulled up to a red light.  “There were only fifteen of ‘em ever made, and that store owner had one of ‘em!”
Closing his eyes, Steve took several deep breaths, attempting to relax his tense muscles. Rain was still falling against the windows as he propped himself up onto his elbow and leaned over to give Tony a quick kiss on the cheek, his heart jumping into his throat when he realised that Tony's skin was so hot it nearly burned his lips.
Steve pursed his lips, firmly ordering his eyebrows to stay in their proper place.
"Yeah, well, that kinda comes with the whole parenting gig, bud, and you know it," Tony said. He kissed the top of Peter's head, grateful he could still reach it with how fast Peter had been growing lately.
I know you’re all probably missing Peter, so we’ll get to hear from him first in the next chapter 😊.
"Mmm, that's swell of him," Tony said with a nod, shifting slightly on the table. "Bet he and Bucky are spoiling Pete rotten though."
"Uh huh. Love you too."
"Peter's gonna be okay, Tones," James said as he drew Tony into a tight hug. "He is one tough kid, and you know it."
"Don't think you have to worry about that, honey," Tony murmured. He came up next to Steve, who curled his arms around both his and Peter's shoulders, hugging them to his sides as they all gazed across the lake, and the water rippling lightly in the breeze.
"Then hold on," she said. "I'm taking you home."
"All right," Tony said as he circled the hologram. "Now show me the areas that are in the targeting range of the current drone system."
“Thank you for inviting me, Peter,” he whispered as he patted Peter’s back.  “It was fun.”
Sam had warned Steve that it would take time for him to get back into the swing of things after his experience down in the HYDRA prison, and as usual, Sam had been absolutely correct. The Ireland vacation had helped, as had the unwavering support from Tony and Peter, but Sam had also warned Steve that only he could work through his own traumatic experiences. Others could sympathise and help him, but Steve's demons were all his own. They were personalised, so to speak, which meant that only he could defeat them.
"Well, I'm sure I helped him a bit when I almost died after I was born," Peter said around a mouthful of garlic bread. "Which is why the neonatal intensive care unit at Mount Sinai has a Stark wing now."
Clint added. "
"I'm so sorry, sweetheart," he whispered. "I'm so sorry you're in so much pain."
that those rules have always suited us just fine."
"Jesus Christ, Steve, what the hell are you doing?" Tony demanded as he knelt down next to him, bleary-eyed and disheveled. He slid his arms underneath Steve's shoulders, trying to hoist him back up. "You trying to give me a heart attack or something?"
Slowly flexing his bloody, tingling fingers, Steve began searching through the various closets and shelves for another punching bag. It had been a long time, months, since he'd run out, as before—well,
Doctor List's eyes crinkled as he smirked. "I have been very eager to meet you for quite a long time, Captain, as I'm sure you can imagine." He stepped even closer, placing his palms against the window. "I have studied the work of Abraham Erskine for most of my life, but unfortunately I have never quite been able to replicate the miracle that he created in you. And as a scientist, this was immensely frustrating for me."
"Oh gods, I'm so sorry." He rubbed Tony's fingers in apology before moving his hand to the crook of his arm. "We're almost there—"
"Yes!" Steve rasped. "Tony, we could bring Peter home, and he would barely even know he'd been gone!"
Finally, once he was almost finished with his float, Peter cleared his throat. He'd thought he had heard Dad head down the hall towards his lab during the night last night, and had even been tempted for a bit to join him. But he'd ended up falling asleep again before making up his mind, and by the time his alarm went off for school, Dad was back asleep.
that it's almost unbelievable that people back then survived at all." He grabbed onto Uncle Bucky's hand and led him into the kitchen, showing him a book he had found at the library on early nineteenth century medical treatments.
"Yeah, 'cause the fact that Thanos is just as big as Hulk isn't already compensating enough?" asked Rhodey.
, don't do that! It's the middle of the night, and—"
Peter blinked. "Well, he kinda is. I mean, you've met him. Uncle Thor is pretty goofy."
“Oh, you definitely did that, honey,” said Tony.  “Tell Pete hi for me when he gets there, yeah?”
All of the lovemaking they had been doing might've had a bit to do with that as well. It had been a long time since Steve and Tony had been able to enjoy this much sex on consecutive nights, and Steve was soaking up as much of it as he possibly could.
The second thing that he noticed—which might have actually been the first, but he supposed that was besides the point—was the
And it
being held at Peter's head. "Well, hopefully that won't cause us any problems."
With Papa's stress levels already through the roof, Peter knew that having to travel across hundreds of kilometres of barren frozen countryside yet again wasn't helping him at all, and was probably causing Dad even more stress as well.
Tony flinched at Steve's words, prompting Steve to reach for his hand, running the pad of his finger along Tony's wedding ring.
Davis started, his brow furrowing. "Can you elaborate, Mr Stark?"
As capable as Tony was of designing complex flight simulations in his head, the more complex the simulations the more difficult it had become for him to translate those ideas onto paper. Peter was the artist in their family, not him, and Tony wasn't about to add to Peter's stress level by having to ask him to draw stuff out for him anymore.
"As much as I hate to say it, we really need to meet with the prince as soon as possible. I can get Tony and Bruce to take a look at whatever you guys manage to find on the biological, but this information that Thor has needs to take precedence at the moment."
Sixteen years old, and he still never turned down a single offered hug.
He did find it amusing, though. And somewhat comforting, if he was honest.
"But you told me that Colonel Phillips thinks that it might work," Peter said. "And Uncle James, so—"
"On our way, Cap," came Natasha's voice over the comm. "Stand by."
Tony's heart gave a flutter, and he cleared his throat as he twisted the cap off a bottle of superwater and handed it to Steve.
Steve thinks for a moment.  “Okay, I can see that.  You're referring to the way Loki was able to use it to open the portal between Earth and space?”
A flutter of wings outside the window caught Peter's eye, and he smiled as he saw Mrs Bird returning to her nest, a fat worm caught in her beak that was pounced on so quickly by her three chicks that she barely had time to land first.
“Okay, so… what’s the plan?”
I have more stories in the works!  I am hoping to post the first of my Marvel Trumps Hate auction winners in the next couple of weeks, which will also be part of the Pieces of Echoes series.  I also am participating in the Fandom Trumps Hate auctions, so be sure to look for my listing! 😊
Almost against his will, Steve's lips curled into a slight smile. "Why?"
"Please don't," Steve murmured against Tony's skin as he added some more lube, reveling in the way Tony was writhing beneath him, chanting his name. "Then we'll never get to the best part."
Grandma sighed, her eyes flicking up to the wall next to Peter, and the huge Air Corps poster that hung there. It was a picture of the first of the X-series of aircraft, the X-101. The very same aircraft that Papa's papa had flown.
“Oh God,” Steve rasps, shuddering as he swipes his sleeve across his mouth.  Ever since he was a kid, he’s always hated vomiting with the fiery passion of a thousand suns, and apparently that hasn’t changed in the slightest since SHIELD defrosted him.
Tears welled in Steve's beautiful eyes, and he raised his shaking left hand, bruised and bloodied across the knuckles and only partially covered by a torn fingerless glove.
"Steve," Tony said once they were out of earshot, his heart lurching as he studied his husband's face, which was covered in dirt, sweat, and blood from various scratches and bruises.
Isn’t that what Phillips always used to tell him?
"Not sure you can do much else for me at the moment, but I'll keep you updated." Peter had already programmed the chip to send out a Morse Code S.O.S. signal with his current coordinates if his phone happened to get damaged or destroyed, but he was really hoping that he would get the chance to include some info about what kind of opposition the team would be facing once they got there before that.
"Someone," Howard practically spat out. "Yeah, I'm almost positive that it was Pym, Chester. He's the only one stupid enough to do something like that."
"I'll call and check on you later, okay, Peter?" Gwen called after them, with Peter barely managing a weak nod in reply. As soon as Dad set him down on the stretcher and pulled off his blood-soaked hoodie he curled onto his side, clamping his hands over his ears and trying not to flinch as Dr Cho listened to his chest and started treating his cuts and scrapes. It took her almost an hour to dig all of the splinters and bits of plaster out of Peter's skin, with Dad and Papa practically having to sit on him to help him hold still so Dr Cho could stitch him up.
He was just putting Tony and Peter ahead of himself, like he always did.
With a somber shake of his head, Uncle Bucky slapped his palm against the remains of the wall and disappeared outside, shouting instructions to the people already gathered outside to move away from the theatre. Peter waited until he was completely out of earshot before grabbing a discarded baseball hat from the disgusting floor and shoving it onto his head, pulling the hood of his hoodie up over it. He didn't have anything to cover his face, but he highly doubted that anyone would be looking too closely at who he was as he attempted to figure out a way to get the trapped people free.
"I was living on the Kree homeworld with no memory of who I was or what had happened to me," answered Carol, rather sharply. "Is that out of commission enough for you?"
"I am definitely looking forward to it," said Steve. "I might even cook for us, if that's okay?"
"Holy shit, that was a close one, Rogers!" called the voice of Tomis Syler, one of Joseph's two wingmen. "You all right?"
"Um… sure, Captain. That sounds—that sounds nice," Tony said before he could change his mind. He had to admit that he was a bit surprised by Rogers' nervousness. For someone who looked like he could get any girl or guy that he wanted, Rogers sure seemed to be lacking in the suave department.
“Uh huh.  Love you too, Dad.”
But she had refused to say, only telling him that he needed to try and go back to sleep and ignoring his tear-filled pleas for a light, any kind of light to break up the darkness that terrified him.
"She does not believe it will do any good," Drax said softly. "Now that Thanos has the Time Stone, it does not matter how long it takes us to repair the ship."
"Steve, I know Peter's gone," Natasha murmured, thick with emotion. "And there's not a single hour that goes by where I don't miss him, my sweet милая ошибка. Peter was one of the brightest lights that I've ever seen in my life, and it's just not fair that he was taken and we weren't. None of it's fair. But you also know that there is no way he would want you and Tony to go through what you're going through now. You know it, Steve. He would hate to see how much you guys are hurting."
"Thanks," Peter murmured as he slid the dark glasses into place. "So… um… they ran out of coffee? How'd that happen?"
"I shall, Captain."
"Steve was doing his job," said Uncle Bruce. "Just like you and I would have if we'd've been there. Although, I probably would've made an even bigger mess than the HYDRA guys ended up making, so… maybe it was a good thing that I wasn't there."
"Yeah, I saw Betty putting up some signs about it," Peter answered, internally kicking himself. Normally he'd be jumping for joy at the possibility of getting to go to a dance with Gwen, but at the moment…
"Good. Now, tell me what else you'd like."
"Oh gods, Tony," Steve said on a gasp as Tony did it again, a rather self-satisfied smile on his kiss-swollen lips. "I can't—I can't… feels too good…"
Peter and Papa had also both had nightmares the previous night, which ended up with all three of them piling onto Peter's bed at around three in the morning, trying to catch at least a little bit of sleep before he had to get up for school. Cuddling with his dads did help Peter get back to sleep, but he was still pretty embarrassed about the fact that he had needed them there in the first place.
Just like physical injuries took time to heal, and certain injuries longer than others, Steve would be recovering from his severe PTSD for a long time to come.
"Maybe they've decided they've had enough?" suggested Uncle Bucky. "Time to turn tail?"
"As long as you wash your hands when you come back inside!" Steve called after him, earning a breathless, "Uh huh!" in return.
"Okay, maybe a little."
No. It was better to simply prevent the snap from occurring rather than try to reverse it. Even if doing so meant that some babies wouldn't be born or relationships wouldn't be formed, the tragedy of having potentially tens of thousands of people reappearing at thirty-plus thousand feet or over the open water because their planes and boats were no longer in the same place would be far, far worse.
Peter pursed his lips, a sad look marring his sweet, boyish face.  “‘Cause I think Steve might be sick, and I wanted to see if we could help him.”
"Be like getting to kiss you goodnight again, right Pete?" said Dad. "I've missed it."
"All right," Steve whispered, slumping back against his pillow as soon as Natasha left the room. He tipped his head, dragging his eyes back to where his wedding ring sat on the table, sparkling in the sunlight. It was the perfect summer day outside, the kind of day that Peter used to adore since he didn't have to worry as much about getting too cold. The kind of day that often saw him and Steve fishing out on the lake, or playing catch or baseball out in the yard. Steve, Peter, Sam, and Clint against Bucky, Natasha, Wanda, and Pietro, with Tony serving as both the cheering squad and the occasional umpire.
"You mean, other than just pointing to it and waving a flag?"
"Scott Lang?" Natasha said, taken aback. "But wasn't he reported as missing?"
That what the computerised Zola said down in that bunker was true: Steve’s life has amounted to nothing more than a zero-sum.
Another alien with long brown hair, huge eyes, and a pair of antennae on the top of her head—
"Um… thanks?" Peter said, frowning in bewilderment. That had been a bit too close for his comfort, but it wasn't like he could just sit there and watch Gwen break her computer. "I guess Auntie Nat's ballet lessons are finally starting to pay off. She's been trying to teach me to move like that since we started, so…"
"She's not my girlfriend," Peter said quickly, wincing when Uncle Bucky took another one of his pawns. "She's just a friend."
Satisfied with the GPS, Tony squared his shoulders, trying to convey to Steve that he wasn't as nervous as he felt. His brief living room nap aside, neither of them had slept well the night before, with what little sleep they did manage to get plagued with nightmares of sinking airplanes and people breaking apart like leaves.
Another sentiment that Steve could now understand. The weeks that he and Tony had spent in uncertainty that Peter would ever recover from his injuries sustained during the Miami battle had been even more tortuous than his captivity in the HYDRA bunker, and something that Steve absolutely never wanted to go through again. Like Tony, Peter was a part of Steve's very soul, and to lose him would be to lose one of the best parts of himself.
"I'm so sorry, Scott," he said quietly. "That must've been pretty scary."
"Yes, Captain?"
Tony bit his lip at the obvious concern in his son's voice, concern for his Papa, who he'd once feared he might never see again.
Psyche himself up, so to speak.
"You guys know I can hear you, right?"
"Whoa, whoa, hold on," Peter said as he stepped between Tony and Strange. "All right, can you guys just step back here a bit, please? 'Cause this bickering's not getting us anywhere."
Sliding onto the corner of his desk, Tony huffed out a sharp breath and picked up the phone, punching the button for line three like it had personally offended him.
"Hoo boy," answered Rhodey as he and Sam immediately broke off their formation, flying towards Tony. "I am really hoping this doesn't mean what it used to mean."
Peter's lower lip shook as he tried to turn away, held fast by Gwen's hand. He knew she was right, but since it wasn't at all what he'd wanted to hear, he also didn't want to admit it in front of her.
The television was still on in the living room when they got home, a sharp slap in the face compared to the last couple hours of relative peace that he and Tony had just shared. Steve's heart skittered as he turned his back to the screen, winding his arms around Tony's shoulders and pulling him into a tight hug.
"Another new suit?" Steve said as they exited the lab. "Tony, none of my uniforms are even close to being worn out, and—"
Peter gulped, trying to soothe the stupid throat tickle that just wouldn't leave him alone. "Something happened with Papa's reentry, right?" he asked. "That's why he's not home yet?"
"He's strong, sir, so he'll eventually be okay," Steve said. "It's just going to take some time."
"Yeah. Okay."
"But is it really necessary to have those… what do you call them? Those awful flying bodyguards actually following the convoys?" asked Senator Davis. "I mean, if we've already caught the perpetrator behind the thefts, then why do we still need them? They're not exactly what I would call attractive, and at this point I feel that they only serve to frighten people."
"Only three?" Tony said, his left hand clenching into a fist. He had asked for all six of them to be converted knowing that the leadership would then insist on only four, which was all that he really needed anyway. But with only three of the aircraft available it would be a lot more difficult, requiring more alterations to each one of the components than he had initially anticipated, which would then take even more time that Peter didn't have, and—
Well, actually, more than fine. More like,
"Goodnight, bud," he whispered. "I'm sorry I scared you."
"Pardon me, Master Peter, but Sergeant Barnes is asking for permission to enter the penthouse," JARVIS suddenly said, startling Peter such that he knocked his pen onto the kitchen floor despite the UI's quiet tone. Dad had reprogrammed JARVIS to speak more quietly once his enhancements started to emerge, but nine times out of ten whenever Peter was alone and concentrating on something, JARVIS still managed to startle him.
"There," he said, nodding in approval. "That's better."
“Right.  ‘Cause I’m not already?” Peter muttered as he picked up a single popped kernel, eyeing it like it had somehow offended him before popping it into his mouth.  Tony watched him as he chewed, biting down on his own bottom lip as he tried to keep his gurgling emotions in check.
"Nat—"
That at least got Steve to chuckle. "Oh, really," he said, raising an eyebrow. "Is that how it is?"
Tony playfully rolled his eyes, ruffling Peter's hair as Happy stepped onto the plane looking concerned.
"Really?" Peter exclaimed, covering the receiver so he didn't cough in Dad's ear. "I mean, really? How?"
"Peter!" Papa shrieked, more panicked than Peter had ever heard him. There was nothing that Papa hated more than feeling helpless during a battle. "Hold on, little guy! Dad's coming!"
"Will do, sir."
"Gamora?" Peter suddenly heard from behind him, startling him so badly that he nearly jumped out of his skin. He whirled around to find Quill patting the ground where Gamora had just been sitting, obviously just as frantic as he felt. "Gamora? Where the hell did you go? Where the hell's the ship?"
"He said, 'I do
"That's 'cause you ripped out your IV, bud," Tony said, his heart rate finally returning to something resembling normal. He nodded at Bruce, who quickly fetched the first aid kit from Peter's bathroom and bandaged his torn-up arm before turning his attention to Steve's busted-up face.
“All right,” Steve says evenly.  He twists the cap off the bottle, taking just a big enough sip to wash the lingering sour taste from his mouth.  Then he sets it down and looks at Tony, who’s still trying his best to avoid Steve’s gaze.
Steve slumped down into the chair as Tony wheeled him away, his heart starting to thud when he realised they were heading towards a bank of elevators instead of the exit.
"Okay, buddy." Tony leaned forward, pressing a soft kiss to Peter's forehead. "I'm gonna get Papa back in here so we can both say goodbye, yeah? Let you get some sleep?"
"And I do." Steve pressed a final kiss to Tony's lips. "Are you ready to go? Ma told me that she'd have dinner waiting for us once we got there, so…"
"Yes, we think so," Natasha said gently. "Did you know him?"
“Oh my God!” Steve suddenly exclaims, startling Tony such that he bangs his head into Steve’s chin.
"Go on, then."
"What? But
Tony thought grimly.
Tony's lower lip was shaking, and he caught it between his teeth as he looked into the beautiful eyes of the man who he knew without a doubt loved his son just as much as he did.
“Okay, how ‘bout we try this,” Peter said.  “That one day that Steve’s friends came into the store, one of ‘em had a metal arm.  And then later that week, Steve had a nightmare when he was here, right?”
"Yeah babe, that's exactly what I'm thinking," Tony answered. "This must be the guy who caused the lake to freeze over up at the Compound."
“Yeah.  Didn't I just say something about that?” Dad says, his lips twitching in their usual ‘I-told-you-so’ way.  “C’mon, bud.  There’s a sporting goods store right on the way to the place.”
"That's it, you assholes," he muttered, briefly wincing at his awful language as he stared down the approaching missile, counting down the seconds in his mind.
"No, no, no, honey, don't," Tony choked out. "Don't try to move just yet, okay?" He fell to his knees next to his boys as his helmet retracted, pulling Peter into a fierce hug.
"Can you tell us now, little guy?" he said softly. He moved his hand to the back of Peter's neck, digging the pads of his fingers into Peter's tight muscles as Dad's jaw twitched in anticipation.
With how much difficulty Steve had been having with his memory, especially with how he'd managed to get so badly injured, he had at least been able to keep track of the two different men who made regular appearances at his window.
"Okay, babe, I think we've gotten all we can from here," Tony said as he entered a few final commands into the workstation. Steve gave a stiff nod, their rather terse conversation with Peter a few hours ago still echoing around in his mind.
"So you decided to lie to me instead?" Tony said, scowling. "And force my own son to lie to me for you? Did you even stop to think about what you were doing to Pete?"
“I’m getting there, Cap!” Tony shouts.  “JARVIS, I am getting there, aren’t I?”
All because he’s stubborn.
Some of them were obvious. Justin Hammer had been removed from his post because he had failed to live up to the Air Corps expectations, which Steve could attest to personally. Bruce Banner had apparently died in an accidental lab explosion a few years back, the cause of which was classified beyond Steve's clearance level. He got the same result for Reed Richards, who had also died from some sort of tragic accident that was classified above Steve's clearance level.
"Babe?" Tony said again as he crouched down in front of his husband, gently tugging on his left hand. "C'mon, it's not gonna do any good to just sit here and brood all night."
“Buddy, I’m almost positive that any goggles you might unearth from that mess wouldn't even fit around your head now,” Dad says.  “Why don’t we just stop at the store on the way there and pick you up a new pair?”
"I see. And it was SHIELD Director Fury who arranged for your involvement?"
Unless…
"It's—it's… ahh… you really made this?" he quietly asked. "For me?"
"Yeah. I'll… um… tell my dads about it." He huffed out a sharp breath, wincing as another bolt of tingling pain rushed up his spine, nearly causing him to cry out. The nerve pain was always the last thing to go away after a peppermint exposure, and it was pretty awful while it lasted.
"Steve!" Tony exclaimed as Image Peter dropped from the railing, right into Image Steve's arms.
Unfortunately, Dad still needed to find some hard proof that Beck did actually steal from Stark Industries. They had Beck on record as saying that he'd had more of the CTX-616 manufactured, but since he was still a Stark Industries employee at the time it didn't count as proof that he had stolen it, so Peter was hoping that he would find something about it hidden inside the HYDRA files.
Steve shot Tony one of his worried looks. "That's good, Peter," he said. "But that doesn't mean that he never will, so… we still have to be careful."
to you?"
After flashing his ID badge at the security guard, Steve steps out into the pool deck.  Almost instantly he smiles, the enthusiasm of the cheering crowd giving him a much-needed boost of excitement and energy.  As he heads over to his lane, Bucky grabs onto his arm, jerking his head in Shostakov’s direction.
published?"
"Several of which were actually SHIELD consultants at the time, doctor," added JARVIS.
And he can’t have that.  Not when he’s getting ready to defend his Olympic title.
The text that read: longing, rusted, furnace, daybreak, seventeen, benign, nine, homecoming, one, and freight car.
"You all right?" Dr Strange asked as he scrambled up, offering Peter a hand just as Dad came zooming back in, rapid-firing missiles from the back of his armour, engulfing Thanos in a massive orange fireball. But only a second later Peter's relief turned to shock as he watched Thanos somehow absorb the fireball into the gauntlet and shoot it right back towards his father.
