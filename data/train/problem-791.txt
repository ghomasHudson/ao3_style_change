I didn’t even see him until it was all over; by 6 p.m. he was at his post in the empty house directly across from our sitting-room windows. It provided him with a clear view of what was going on not only in the room, but also on the street and the rooftops around. I knew that the distance was well within his range should anything go awry with Morstan or Moran, unless his aim had deteriorated since Jeff Hope.
But I was angry, after he came back. I was so angry, so bitter and hurt that I strangled all that love and desire, warped and stunted it into relentless mateyness and vengeful condescension.
Note the rating change to E. I am apparently incapable of a modest ellipsis and a "next morning over breakfast" kind of epilogue. Forgive me.
Perhaps this was my bargaining: I would believe this when I could understand it, and not before. I would accept it, but only if I could figure it out, make sense of the motivation—and the coat.
he’d said. —When, exactly? He’d have to find a way to tell me. But I knew I’d be going back to Barts.
He gave his low chuckle at this negotiation and nodded, kissing my hair again. Funny, I never expected him to be this tender.
for anchoring Sherlock, for steadying him. If he only knew what Sherlock had done for me—had done and kept on doing since the day we met.
Placing the mobile beside what remained of the helmet, he said, “Here he is, Erica. Warren. You can talk to him.”
Did the correspondence of date and line number work for the 2011 songs? It did not. John’s first six songs were what they seemed to be on their surface: entire songs dedicated to a friend he had lost. It wasn’t until he’d completed his investigation and somehow concluded I was alive, that he began to make his songs into more specific messages. Clever John.
This time it’s John who’s flat on his back as Sherlock explores him all over with hands and lips and tongue, with excruciating slowness. His suspicion that Sherlock is a right bastard is confirmed when time and time again John asks him for more, faster, harder, and Sherlock responds by pulling back, slowing down, easing up on the pressure. This isn’t a race, lord knows, and the first time had gone too fast, but Sherlock is taking the piss, and it’s only their second time.
In the velvet violin voice of Freddie Mercury, no less, from the poignant, pleading “Love of My Life.” If I hadn’t known better—but I did know better, didn't I?
But the flat was locked, dark, suspiciously tidy. Ominously empty. Sherlock’s violin case lay in its usual place on the bookcase, but nothing else about 221B looked usual. When Mrs Hudson came up and silently handed me an ivory envelope with Sherlock’s handwriting on it, my first thought was that he had gone away again on a mission for the British Government. It felt like some horrible joke.
Christmas we kept under our usual strict control. Watson held stubbornly to a set of absurd so-called traditions that were traditional nowhere else but 221B, and which fortunately did not involve gift overkill. We were, according to her grandparents and her Nana, utter killjoys on that front. Watson opened one important gift on Christmas Eve, and a tiny one on each of the twelve days of Christmas. Early on Mummy and Mrs H always tried to push the envelope on the gifts, but it had become more a game than an actual subversion; and in any case I was naturally winning.
Even after I knew Sherlock hadn’t died that day at Barts, there was always a chance he’d never make it back to London alive. To me. So when he did turn up—my package, delivered to Baker Street—I was totally overwhelmed and unable to do anything but hold him. Locked in my arms, stiff and strange and uncomfortable.
This was devastating. I could barely stand to see this man’s pain, yet Sherlock was so solicitous, so compassionate with him. Anyone who’d thought him cold, had thought dead wrong.
I wanted to stalk out of the room and monopolise the shower for 45 minutes so he couldn’t get to work on time. I wanted to fling out of the flat and clatter down the stairs and cover my ears so I couldn’t hear John taking his distance with that carefully cool voice. Instead I went into my bedroom and closed the door, thinking about what armour to wear for what was now certain to be an utterly hateful day.
I’ve been much too afraid all my life about the things that really counted. You, for instance. Everyone could see you were the most important thing in the world to me. You were my universe, but I wasn’t yours, and that terrified me.
Da was a bit more functional than Ba, and heaved me off of himself to go find a dressing-gown. As he put it on he pulled a folded sheet of paper out of the pocket and tossed it onto the bed, smiling. Then he opened the bedroom door to collect our daughter and take her to the kitchen.
*Typically any Italian words in the text will be glossed in the immediate vicinity. These though are glossed only by context. Readerly imagination will suffice.
The time passed. Well. I hope I never have to live through anything like that again. The nights were grueling: when Rosie was asleep the silences stretched out taut and bottomless. The days were spent at work or with her, the nights I spent alone, knowing that Sherlock was … not.
didn’t want, to know what other scenes John had seen. It was humiliating even to think of it. “What was Mycroft playing at? What did he want to accomplish?”
Places to go, Sherlock thinks. Other victims of Mycroft’s to torment. She’s forgotten before the door closes.
Hanging back enough to draw no attention, I follow them out the side door into a narrow and rather malodorous alley. Donovan’s trying feebly to pull away but the blond man is tugging her to the brick wall, pushing her against it and at once his hands are all over her, as she pushes back weakly and her knees buckle.
Neither band nor audience ever made it through that song without tears. They always played a cheerier encore to go out on, but there was no denying: the pandemic had changed everything.
Back to square one, then. He was meeting someone for sex and he didn’t consider it enough of my business to tell me anything except “I’m going out.”
It’s full of wonder. I understand that. I’m filled with it, myself. By now closeness is both our default and a thrill. In Bologna I’d been afraid that something we might say
Which, though I didn’t tell the dads, was fairly often. We were such a triad, after all. They had the Hellhounds who were lanky adolescents now, and I got photos and videos of them playing like mad things in the snow that blanketed most of Europe that December; but I wasn’t with them, and I felt hard done by despite Uncle Robbie and Aunt Valentina taking me in at Christmas.
Sherlock hears his own voice at its most chilly, its most pretentious and dismissive, and for a moment he hates himself. He isn’t being honest with this woman—but why?
“Oh, no. He comes home late and freshly showered. And humming.” Holmes’s self-possession was starting to crack.
At the pub on Saturday, Patrick’s interest in Sherlock hadn’t really registered; for one thing, John hadn’t got a clear view of the stage. Then too, the music and the crowd had been sensory overload, and seeing Sherlock after so long had been emotional overload.
for that reason. Here too, two possibilities: if I warned him via radio, the trackers would either know it or they wouldn’t. If they knew, I’d be revealing nothing by using that channel. If they didn’t, the audience would just hear a spooky song by a classic British folk-rock band.
“What if it doesn’t last?” He was in such evident distress that my immediate temptation to laugh disappeared quickly.
The next morning, the familiar breakfast room again intensified the impression of temporal overlay I'd had the evening before. Once again Sherlock spurned the vast majority of the breakfast offerings, accepting only a cappuccino and one slice of some kind of cake, while I piled my tiny plate with everything that looked nutritious and enticing—and then filled another.
He could hear those words from John’s perspective, and they sounded dismissive. Of him, and of everything they’d done together.
I beg him silently to understand what I mean: that I’d been pretending to be an unequivocally straight man, to be better at human relations than he was, to care about him only as a mate.
Last night he hadn’t been able to speak and hadn’t dared to move, while John sucked him down; John didn’t have that problem. He was vocal, unreserved, and Sherlock soon understood that he wanted something rather more vigorous. He shifted onto his side to allow John to fuck his mouth, stretching his lips over that mouth-filling erection, a hand each on John’s arse and cock, encouraging but also controlling, just enough for comfort.
Ella never tells me things directly anymore; she’s more a Socratic therapist, asking me questions that will lead me to tell her things. She went off on what I thought was a wild digression, asking about my parents, Harry, and me; Sherlock’s parents, him, and Mycroft; resemblances, differences, oppositions. It took her nearly an hour of “digression” to maneuver me into informing her that children are not miniatures of their parents. That children are not the direct reflection either of their nature, or of their nurture. Sherlock is not, Mycroft is not; Harry is not, I am not; and Rosie would not be. Ella looked much struck by this information.
Donovan ended the interview, which had taken longer than expected, and the recording. We headed to the morgue where we’d been
“Yes, John.” I said it meekly, though it already made my stomach hurt to think of him being attracted to other people. “Does it happen ... often?”
Minor-key piano chords, light but insistent, open the song. Lyrics half-spoken, half-sung. He listens to the end. It’s—fascinating. Edgy and somehow old-fashioned at the same time. A seduction, a plea.
I put on my sunglasses and the distractions fell away: dimming the brightness let me see the larger structures and the volumes, run sight-lines, measure distances, run hypotheses on entrance and escape points. The original investigators were naturally fifty years behind current methods, and I was hopeful of discerning something new about the theft of the painting, one of the ten great unsolved art crimes of the twentieth century.
was suddenly much more promising than it had been before this evening, but still he needed to think.
) excellent pastry-shops, or a three-hour walk through the forest to Subiaco, with its underground frescoes. He’d listened with apparent interest as I’d told him about a similar, smaller set of frescoes in a humbler church near our country house. He was equally agreeable whether we spent hours in the car, or walking in the woods, or exploring archaeological sites.
“And you did, believe me. I’ve never felt better. But if you’re miserable about it anyway—nothing’s stopping you from spoiling me next time, or all the times. We’re just getting
And finally, finally. On 1 April, at 6 p.m., the programme’s first song was dedicated to John by “An Absent Friend.” In fact, it was the one I’d dedicated to him in December: “We’ll Meet Again.” It wasn’t Vera Lynn, this version. The Ink Spots. (Did that mean something?)
“Well, after all the trouble they had with IVF, she’s not exactly geriatric, but definitely on the later side for a first pregnancy. Twins won't necessarily be a complication.”
sounding you out that first evening at Angelo’s. But you made me backtrack and I never dared to bring it up again. I thought you didn’t want it. And you didn’t.
“Come on, let’s make it a contest. Ten best moments of 2016, written down and ready to exchange tomorrow morning. If nothing else it’ll reconcile you to the apparently intolerable existence of end-of-year lists.”
“I know that, now. Then, I’d no idea you’d been protecting us. Not until almost three weeks after, in fact. If you’d told me right away it’d have saved you some bruises, at least. I’m sorry I hit you. I’m sorry I meant to hurt you. I thought you were … laughing at how distraught I was, at how much I’d mourned you. But I should never have hit you.”
Again Sherlock fell into something like catatonia. He’d failed Heather entirely, then. Not just failed to stanch her bleeding; failed to save what was most precious to her. Failed to collect the testimony that might save hundreds of lives in the future. He couldn’t speak, just left the chaotic sitting room and went into the shower fully clothed and let the water run over him while he screamed inside. Only inside.
John senses Greg craning and twitching to catch sight of Molly in Sherlock’s arms. Greg knows better than anyone how long Molly had pined, and how hopelessly. John gives his hand a shake and says, “eyes on me, mate. Molly’s in good hands, so just make sure we don’t bump into anyone until you get her back.”
I don’t know what I said to him, I never did hear my own words, I was listening to his voice, that gorgeous liquid cello tone that filled my head and my chest. But when our breathing calmed and pounding hearts slowed, and I opened my eyes and saw him by the light coming in from the skylight I saw, as clearly as though he’d spoken, that something was wrong. Disconcerting, that, when I’d thought everything was perfect.
“No, I was in and out, running various operations at once. But I went back to Belgrade when things started shaping up with Miletić.” There wasn't time now to give him the whole backstory.
, in Magnussen’s hateful term: we’d let those pressure points become weaknesses by dint of concealment, and ignorance of each other’s plans and doings.
Perhaps John doesn’t want to sleep alone. Or lie there angry alone. Perhaps what he wants is for me to think this through alone. After all, he says he’s not good at talking. He doesn’t like it. The more intense the topic, the more he avoids it. Serious things make him clam up. All those hours of talking—in Bologna, in London—were almost a one-off, something we had to do to have a fresh start. Even yesterday didn’t mean he was a convert to talking things out.
“I was thinking. I mean, I thought I was. I was trying to get it straight in my mind, why you were so angry.” Carefully neutral.
beautiful. When he stood there in the buff, held my head in his hands as he breathed me in and kissed me for minutes on end, I realised all that he’d been holding in all this time, and all that I’d been holding in too. When I finally, clumsily, got my kit off, he looked at me like a starving man to whom they’ve opened the whole of Fortnum and Mason’s: wanting, not believing, not daring.
His heart was pounding now, his breath coming faster, harder, ragged. What had been a light perspiration had cooled, thickened into a clammy slick over his skin. Over his scalp, leaving his hair lank and sweaty.
It was indeed unexpected, all of it. First of all, the victim was hanging fully clothed from a cargo hook crudely fastened to the kitchen ceiling, in a position which would have been agonizing for a living person: hands bound behind his back by a rope that held all of his weight, dangling from a chain. At the very least the shoulders would have been dislocated, the ligaments and tendons torn beyond mending. The
Everything we’ve done and had and been in the past year has been just ... right. Time to stop overthinking; sufficient unto the day is the evil (or the good) thereof. And suddenly I’m not at all tired anymore.
He’s going on without me, though. “I was mourning what I’d hoped might come of her ... revelation. Provocation. But also. When I stroked the curves of the instrument I sometimes imagined I was touching you.”
. Given what he knew, and given that his knowledge existed only in his head, there was literally no other way to guarantee he wouldn’t leak it to anyone she had harmed in the past. Whereas once he was dead, and no documentation anywhere, your ... life together was ... safeguarded. For good.”
. I nearly killed myself staying in character as the grieving friend for eighteen months—well, a year. However long I’ve known you were alive out there, and unable to tell me about it.”
As he finished wiping his fiddle down and settling it in its case, Patrick asked, “Want to come back to mine for a drink? I need to wind down, and it’s too noisy in here.”
and all that.” And as if he too were trying for reassuring, he lifted his left hand and cupped my head, cradling it to his shoulder and stroking my hair. It was easy to lose my train of thought.
She looked annoyed, but managed to say “Zero seven three zero three four…” before we both recoiled at two shots, fired across the street.
“Maybe that had somethin’ to do with me ... doing what I did, I don’t know. Or maybe it’s just that Ciaran and I were married so young, nearly half my life ago. Are we still even the same people?” Ash looked forlorn and even now, still young.
“Night, John. See you tomorrow.” I take my leather gloves with me—it might be a bit too much leather, but he gave them to me, and I do like them. It adds a fillip to his jealousy, as well.
Long ago, Sherlock worried that the fireworks of love would fade when it no longer had an obstacle. John has an answer. 🎇🎆
It was a little too easy, making John’s mouth water, and I relished it whenever I could justify doing it. Not too often. I didn’t want to destabilise things by making John face what he wasn’t yet ready to face. When he eventually was ready, I’d be here.
“Yes. You don’t mind? I thought you’d rather dance with me for one of the same-sex dances. Makes it look like less of a choice. Stand out less.” John’s heart jerks at the nonchalant tone in Sherlock’s voice that barely masks his uncertainty, his humility. Suddenly he can’t bear it another moment, that Sherlock should think John would be embarrassed to dance with him.
So the interim solution became our normal. What had happened, without my really realising it, was that Sherlock had morphed into Rosie’s primary caretaker, companion, and teacher. And she was benefiting from this, as I was, but it was hardly fair on him. He was indeed taking far fewer cases than he used to, and the man whose greatest horror had been boredom was now overseeing the education and well-being of a little kid. A darling child he loved as his own, as
Mycroft nodded, his eyebrow arched. “Which is why Moriarty’s ‘world-wide gang’ continued to function as well after his death as before it, and why you were kept so busy for so long, Sherlock. It was never a single-headed dragon with local overseers; it was a hundred-headed dragon with Morstan and Moran simply extorting tribute from a number of unrelated crime bosses. It explains why Moriarty killed himself; they pulled his strings while he was useful and cut him loose to self-destruct when he grew too volatile for them. The plot to discredit you was probably set up to frame you for his murder, if you didn’t jump.”
, and no need for them, either. I suppose that could change, and of course I’d follow him anywhere he wanted to go; but it suits me to have him all to myself, his attention only on us, with what we get up to in bed being a natural outcome, neither studied nor pursued.
It was a matter of faith that I could liquidate the Moriarty crime cartel in the following months. Those months became a year, then two, and here I am, still dead—to John, and nearly to myself, in sober truth.
John was silent, letting me find my words: he knows better than anyone what nightmares do to scramble language. Dreams are mostly images, after all. And emotion. Impression. Words only come in as dialogue. A nightmare is a horror film without a voiceover; if there were one, they wouldn’t be so paralysing.
gone off on a mission without me. What he’d done was far worse: he’d left me, gone to Rome with his bloody admirer Roberto Zanardi.
It wasn’t an out-of-body experience, at all. If anything, an out-of-brain experience. Language centers shut down, leaving only images and sensation and the vast, oceanic
Slowly, haltingly, he did. First the events; then the anomalies; finally the experience of seeing this unknown woman out of the world, fighting every step of the way to keep the blood in her ruined body even as it poured out and formed a lake around them both.
He could ring the Festival office, obviously. No answer on a Friday night, equally obviously. He left an anxious message with a request for a return call, then rang back and left another to emphasise that it was really important. Stupid. He was going to sound like a sad fanatic folky stalker.
In the mirror of Mary’s horrified reaction he saw for the first time how deeply he’d hurt John with his fake suicide. And having done so, swanning back in disguised as a waiter, then congratulating himself like some flamboyant Houdini, had made John feel ridiculous and small and unimportant. Everything John wasn’t.
That courteous gesture was its own reward, as the dogs put on a show that made me laugh harder than I'd laughed all year.
His voice, if not warm, had nonetheless thawed a great deal over what had become normal of late. “Yes, and that’s where that’s this all started, so let’s start there.”
Now he’s moving smoothly beneath me, back and forth, chasing stimulation to his cock to go along with what I was doing behind him. If I had a hand free I’d slip it under his hip to lightly tease his cock. Instead I slide my tongue back down to his bollocks, growing hard and tight, and nose and tongue at them as John groans unabashedly and grabs the pillow under his head.
Relief draped itself over John like a warm blanket, and he felt the last of his muscles relax. “Ah. I got the feeling that he didn’t want this last week to be a one-off at all.”
Icy guilt, followed by terror. Out in the field I never panicked, but here: it could be fatal for John if I stayed. He mustn’t be followed to me, or seen to be relieved or happy after seeing me. Twenty-two hours later I was in Belgrade, deluging Mycroft with increasingly furious and menacing messages: he had to find out who was following John and why—whether he was in imminent danger.
A few former readers, still faithful, asked about Sherlock. About whether I’d be writing up any new (they meant old) cases. How could they have forgotten that his reputation was still in ruins? I just answered that it was still too soon. My blog entries were laconic, dreary, rather boring.
scalp massager (well, that’s really for Ba too) (Ba’s way easier to give gifts to) (Da never seems to think he deserves them)
“Really, John, I promise you’ll be better off for a little diversion. You seem stretched so thin. It’ll be good for you.”
The closest I ever got to articulating this to him was a night of Chinese food and a Japanese movie. A
Sherlock pinks up even further, and John reaches up and adjusts his white tie, unconcerned that the gesture looks more than a little proprietary. It’s meant to.
If Sherlock had been an option I’d have been thrilled, but I was still far from certain that he was completely clean. Whether he was or not, he’d been back at work for weeks now—back to a life of unscheduled time, bouncing unpredictably between crisis and tedium, reflection and furious activity. No room for a baby in that, even if he’d offered.
The next hour was taken up with making her tea, and shuttling her suitcase upstairs (less heavy than it looked, no wonder she’d got it up to the flat unassisted), and waiting while she took a shower to wash away the journey.
status) “but almost never comfortable enough to act on it. It was just so much easier—in medicine, in the army—to date women, and be friends with men. Well, with one exception.”
He didn’t always look at me; John used touch, hearing, taste, more than just vision when we made love. It gave him all the sensory data he needed to bring me to my knees. He kissed his way down my neck and chest, lingering on my nipples until my legs were shaking. But I had something in mind, and wanted to get to it. I pulled back a bit.
Oh, he’d pleasured himself to any number of balletic choreographies, but he’d never fantasised that John would simply rub Sherlock’s bollocks with his own through
When I had stripped sentiment away from my daily experience to the best of my ability, I found I had stripped away the
The centrifugal shards whirling in Sherlock’s brain suddenly coalesced into a perfectly coherent picture and he punched Donovan’s speed-dial, talking faster than she could decipher, he knew.
Standing up in front of our guests, I tried not to look at Watson. She was the one I thought would tip me over into an unseemly emotional display. Instead I glanced at my parents, both looking as proud as if I had brought peace on earth rather than merely striking it incredibly lucky in meeting John. (Having met him, falling in love with him was a foregone conclusion.) Mycroft too looked unwontedly mellow, somewhere between relieved and smug.
, John would like to know?—appears to be a master of the slow burn. He escalates in microscopic increments and already John can’t breathe, can’t reach out a hand to caress or guide Sherlock, can’t think of anything except the kaleidoscopic patterns of sensation erupting over his skin.
“Did you even remember what day it was?” I hated it when my voice went reedy. It was such a humiliating tell.
perfect gift—a booklet of coupons for babysitting occasions—and pooh-poohed our fervent thanks, saying it was more a gift for herself than for us.
Sherlock wakes up with John’s fingers laced in his own. The bedsheets are an absolute shambles, twisted and pulled free, the covers turned round at a ninety-degree angle, wretchedly uncomfortable. He’s never been happier in his life.
Sherlock’s face went both chastened and sulky, always an unfairly irresistible look on him. John couldn’t fling up his hands for the carrier bags, so he went into the kitchen to sort the latter and try to think about dinner.
It was fascinating watching John and Watson together, and unsettling but thrilling to begin to be part of their routines and their rhythms. If I’d thought he and I could finally breathe again, however, our uneasy sleep proved me wrong. Sometimes we were awake for all the best reasons; sometimes we had nightmares, and once on the same night, seemingly unrelated to anything that had happened during the day.
“Yes. I’ve not played this music often enough since we left Kerry. I thought we’d all see more of each other, but the pandemic made that impossible. And now—well, the music belongs to a different identity.”
Because Roberto is also discreet, and he could imagine that no one could be less welcome there and then than he.
But even before it was full, the moon was on the wane. I felt that I’d rounded a cape, somehow, and was homeward bound.
She could tell what I was doing, and gave a small smile and tight nod to dismiss the subject before it could generate any more emotional intensity.
Sherlock pulled back, his eyes gone a bright viridian and his cheeks a high pink. He had, perhaps, an ingrained habit of being inconspicuous while abroad, or maybe he was just well and truly off-balance given how fast our breakfast conversation had escalated.
He checked the hall and the bathroom, concluded there was only one option left, took off everything but his shirt and pushed open the door to the bedroom.
So that's where I was with my opinion of Sherlock Holmes. I’d have called it my knowledge of him. He was an enemy, plain and simple.
. But Sherlock swung in with a red herring that changed the topic for the rest of the visit: “See, Clara? When you’re in love with a Watson—accept no substitute.”
So two days later, January 31st, I took Rosie to her biggest fans Sarah and Julian, and went back to Baker Street.
If you think you heard a whisper of Harriet Vane in John's thoughts, you're right. And if you heard a bit of Crowley in Lestrade's last line, you're right there, too.
This request isn't just for me--other readers and commenters will be glad of the self-recs! Please, pour us all a glass or two. 🥂
Sherlock and I slept late the next morning, waking when the Saturday sun was already high. I’d already been awake for some time, in fact, stroking and caressing the beautiful man who was sleeping next to me in utter abandon, something he almost never did. I was working on waking him slowly to affection and to pleasure. He captured one of my caressing hands and carried it to his mouth, caught two fingers and drew them inside, his tongue gliding over my knuckles and fingertips. It wasn’t a seductive move, though; his eyes were still closed, and I could swear he was mostly asleep.
They wouldn't want to live always in such isolation, but in the winter light, when time cracks open, there are always—only—two of them.
This is a hermetic universe, which for a few minutes a day has only two inhabitants. They don’t even need names.
The painting is by the extraordinary procoffeinating, who read and reads my mind with terrifying precision
The arrival of the various courses helps to keep the conversation afloat, at least between Roberto and Elena, since Sherlock is rarely inspired to relish a dish, let alone talk about it. Still, he uses the pretext of eating and exploring the tastes—genuinely very fine—of the starters, the pasta, and the wine, to keep his reticence from standing out too plainly. Or so he imagines.
Sherlock’s been dreaming of this, fantasising about this, scheming for this for literal years, and at last, at long last, it’s happening. John betrays no anxiety, no second thoughts. Quite the contrary. In the half-dark his smile is all but predatory, his skin is gleaming, and eventually Sherlock remembers that he can touch John too.
I pulled back and said, “Please, can we slow down. Let’s not rush it, our first time. I want to feel you,
“I promise I’ll tell you. But not now—please, let’s just be together. No one else, just us, here, together. Finally. Desperate for each other at the same time, no games.”
” warned him to slow the pace, and he returned to kissing and tonguing scrotum and arsehole instead, using the barest touch of fingers on Sherlock’s frenulum.
White apron, white wine. White tablecloth, napkins. Green candles, green salad. My timing was improving: I heard him bounding up the stairs in that peculiarly weightless fashion of his, heard the door open just as I was setting the risotto to rest for a few minutes before serving.
He inserted a mental bookmark into his sequence of thought and picked her up, swung her round, smiled at her squeal and stepped into the hallway for a furtive hug and a murmured endearment. She was delighted at having got his attention.
“Yes. I was a bystander, and” (steadying his voice) “rendered assistance at the scene. I’m the one who called you on her mobile.”
“In a way it is,” John answered, kissing his throat. “When I tuned you out, it was to take you with me into an erotic fantasy.”
I could only imagine. There had been a time or two when Sherlock had got the wind up about some very attractive woman or other, but he’d never seen me respond, until that evening. It was coming back to me now. But I had receipts: I was going to be able to reassure him quite comprehensively.
“I wrote you a letter once. A horrible letter. Had Molly give it to you.” His tone was no longer casual.
He located a yoga ashram nearby but soon left off going: he said it was too all-or-nothing, so nothing is what he chose. He said he got enough exercise and meditation walking the streets of the city; considering that he never strolled when he could stride, I could believe it. One day he went to the stables in the Villa Borghese and rode a horse over the grounds. That I did regret not seeing. He must be a compelling figure on horseback.
By late March, though, he was close to ready. He’d gone to Mycroft again to ask what he’d learned from the Facebook posts: proof of life only. Cagey, no identifying clues at all.
On the other hand, though, the very urgency of my desire to delete it undiscussed made me doubt myself. Made it clear that I couldn’t. It was moral cowardice, which had got me far in my life until it had brought me to a complete standstill with John Watson. We had agreed: no more lies and no more secrets. Whether this exchange ever came to light or not, concealing it out of cowardice was going to be corrosive to me. I’d made a promise.
I felt like an idiot. Sherlock reassured me that I was, in fact, an idiot. This generous confirmation I took at its proper value. I’d been afraid Rosie would be the only kid to excel in several areas; instead, with the exception of her advanced reading and vocabulary, she didn’t even stand out.
This was a sore spot, and she must have seen it right away, because she back-pedalled. “I’m sorry. Truly, none of my business. I don’t even know if you
Even before he’d finished the question Sherlock was shaking his head. “No, not tonight. Tomorrow. Come to the flat tomorrow evening, after seven. I’ll be free then.”
I took us both in hand, red and rock-hard; when we grunted in unison, we laughed at the sound, but secretly I loved it. By now Sherlock was mostly seated on the table, only the tips of his toes touching the floor, and I was supporting myself with one hand on the table while the other worked our cocks in exquisite slow motion.
After what had to have been the bleakest in a very long line of bleak New Year’s Eves, Sherlock woke up early on New Year’s morning. He wasn’t hung over, having spent the evening irreproachably and quite tediously playing exercises on the violin, only at midnight allowing himself a proper piece: Auld Lang Syne. For the past several months he hadn’t been satisfied with his technique, and if the moronic tradition of New Year’s resolutions didn’t bore him stupid, would have resolved to practise in a more disciplined and systematic fashion. As it was, he had played scales and études on the violin for three relentless hours, and this time next year would no doubt still be regretting his flabby discipline and frayed technique.
I did try, with Roberto. Once while he was cooking I came up behind him at the stove, wrapped my arms around his waist and lowered my head to his shoulder. Not quite comfortable; leaned my forehead against Roberto’s spine, then. I wanted my arms to feel full, I wanted to feel full. I only felt empty. This wasn’t what I expected. It wasn’t completeness; romantic entanglement hadn't completed me at all. John was wrong.
I didn’t know what I’d find when I got there. For all I knew Zanardi was still ensconced in the flat, wearing one of Sherlock’s dressing-gowns and a gloating smirk. Or worse. All I did know was that doing nothing wasn’t an option. For years Sherlock had left the door open for me to come back to 221B, and in return got only my open hostility and serial cruelty. I was finally ready to walk in, if he'd have me.
They wouldn't want to live always in such isolation, but in the winter light, when time cracks open, there are always—only—two of them.
“Throughout the interrogation, Miss Morstan portrayed Moran as the senior party; then we played her the tape where she bragged the opposite. In the end, she said that in exchange for
John fell asleep before I did, because I never did fall asleep. He’d surprised me, inviting me to join him on the sofa, and he might have surprised himself: there was a good chance it might not be repeated. Oh, it
“Oh—you’re early! Come in, you, I’m glad you found the key.” He laid the fiddle in its case, set the bow on the mantel, and moved toward her. Her face crumpled and she let out a jagged sob before he even got his arms around her.
By the time he reached the pub he was in a proper stew, and Mike, bless him, had the whole story (such as it was) out of him halfway through the first pint. It was good to talk to Mike, it always was; he was sensible and clever, and John couldn’t hide a single thing from that discerning eye or resent that kindly twinkle.
had been sentiment, he knew. Midnight blue. It startled him every time he looked in the mirror. But you’re never ready to say goodbye to some things, it seems.
Whatever else I’d expected from this meeting—rage, relief, an embrace—it wasn’t a lengthening silence that lapped around us like water.
So yes, he recognised the expression as the man tracked Sherlock round the sitting-room. And well he should: he’d worn it himself for years. Fascinated. Admiring. Covetous. No, no—there it was, his missing rhyme—
I took his cock in my hand and thumbed over the tip, felt it slide wet into my palm and out again as he thrust and groaned. Before he could do it again I had my tongue wrapping and licking around that tender frenulum so that he bucked again and gasped “John—
I didn’t want to open it—and didn’t want to hear the file, if it was “Via con me.” Didn’t want to remember any of it.
But the awful cases—the crimes against children, the crimes against humanity, the murders so brutal they made even Sherlock go still—those, we kept on the other side of that membrane. Impermeable, we thought, until the day it wasn’t, the year Rosie turned eight. But in her babyhood, her little-girlhood, we mostly succeeded in preserving her innocence about all that.
He pulls out one of his prepared questions to draw John’s attention from his own feet to his partner. “Do you have plans for this weekend?”
What inspired this fic is a combination of the Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong duet CD, and this dress from a random online catalogue (the artists made it better though):
The investigation turned out to be more of a labyrinth than Sherlock had expected. There was a surfeit of possible motives and suspects, but whoever had done it had been exceedingly careful not to leave unnecessary forensic traces. It took him a solid four weeks of work, not to mention the personnel-hours of Met staff, to trace the string of very slim forensic evidence back to one of those Lancashire cousins, with a long-standing grudge and a newfound interest in the victim’s property, born of learning that the MP had no will and the cousin stood to inherit one-sixth of a decent estate.
Happily she chose the third option. She’s a conversable, energetic little person, who seems to emit warmth like a woodstove in winter. Her Italian is perfect, of course, and I knew she’d add sunny cheer to the Christmas Day visits of my own children and grandchildren. Valentina was fond of Rosie, despite having met her only after she began studying in Salerno; I of course had known her already as a pre-adolescent.
“I memorised the map of the city centre, and my list of things you will like includes the university’s historical anatomy theatre, its collection of wax anatomical models, the outdoor food market, the astronomical meridian line in the city basilica, and the museum of music. And one or two other surprises.”
) for a chance. Another chance. Any chance to be more than ex-best friends, a pallid descriptor for what we really were.
How we got from normal life into sex and back out again was something I hadn’t given any thought to. After a long day of relative solitude, when I saw him again I was either aroused or I wasn’t. If I wasn’t, it didn’t take much to get me interested. What I wasn’t craving, I realised, was intimacy for its own sake. Affection—given or received. Touch. I didn’t want to sleep entangled, I didn’t want to wake up in his arms. In his bed. It wasn’t Roberto’s fault I wasn’t there yet. Perhaps it takes practice.
I want him to. I want him to put order back between us. I want to touch him. I reach for his shoulder as he fills the hot water bottle. He looks up, and his smile is resigned.
That only made him laugh harder, but he went back to dressing and we got down to the empty breakfast room just before ten.
John kept trailing his fingertips up and down the ruined map of my back. It brought to mind Roberto tending those scars—they might be a little less ugly, now. “Why did you never ask me before? About the scars. About my two years away.”
This wasn’t the reunion of a love story or a spy thriller with a romantic side-plot, all gold lighting and soft focus and violins swelling in the film score. It was the return of a man who had never hesitated to do a full-body dive into a skip in search of evidence, and thought nothing of contaminating a refrigerator with severed body parts.
I knew who that was, and I didn’t want him in the room tonight. Maybe some other year. Some other decade. I'd be ready to learn more about James Sholto’s hold on John’s heart, when I could be more confident about my own.
I consider answers like “make me,” “Very well, Your Majesty,” or “All Ye Faithful.” But perhaps it isn’t the moment for levity. He might want soothing, or he might want stimulating, and sarcasm wouldn’t promote either.
“Did you like it that he’s taller than you?” Sherlock probably wondered at the abrupt change of topic and tone—there was laughter in my voice.
His breathing is uneven too, now, his heartbeat speeding up under my shoulder blade, his hands finally, finally gripping me properly and giving me the grasp and friction he’s made me desperate for.
He insisted on keeping a low musical profile: no singing, no guitar, and just two or three fiddle solos. After some initial moaning Ash seemed resigned; the band had its own guitarist now anyway, Patrick’s man Dennis (which explained John’s unfeigned warmth toward Patrick).
“Are you meeting someone? An agent?” He asked, and heard the local lilt already making itself at home in his speech.
Sherlock thinks uncertainly of the smallish room on the top floor of the Settimo Cielo, with its skylight and the window overlooking the hidden canal. Is it large enough? Is the
“Yes, come after dinner. Bring the sprogs and tin whistles?” Part of him wanted John to see that he’d made friends here, had fit in. Could care for people, and matter to them, even though what he’d done to John was unforgivable.
“Ha! Now there’s a phrase you don’t hear every day.” He was bemused; what did that even mean? But it allowed a segue into what he wanted to talk about, had come here to talk about, and he wasn’t going to let it slip.
In the light from the bedside table, Sherlock looked both languid and eager, his hair wild, lube somehow already in hand. What was it about that visual echo of Will Scott that supercharged John’s libido every time? Smoothing the slick over John’s erection and then his own, his large hand taking them both together, their bollocks pressing sweet and soft as kisses—it wouldn’t take long like this, they were both so ready.
“And it isn’t just us, anymore. Once I told you that Rosie had no one but me. But that hasn’t been true for years. For her whole conscious life, she’s had you. It isn’t just you and me. It’s Rosie, too.”
Knowing a place and a language is never enough. What I know of England is deeply rooted in knowing English down to my bones, it is true, but I can only observe, extrapolate, deduce the way I do in England because of the million nonverbal cues that I lacked in Rome. Social relations, conventions of behavior and dress, objects, bonds, ways of performing the self.
The key modulates and Louis Armstrong’s growly rasp gives a different tenor to the whole song: if he and Sherlock don’t have a proper conversation after this night, then they may never do. And it will be too late.
Gently John put his hands on Sherlock’s cheeks and stopped all further stammering with a kiss. All unconcerned with who was looking, too.
It's midnight and I creep in quietly just in case, but he's up, of course. Sitting terribly straight over the microscope, his posture as always both disciplined and relaxed. A posh thing, I expect. Something they teach them in public schools.
At this rate I’d be whitehaired and wrinkled before John made a move. So if a move was to be made, it was for me to make it. The problem was, he spooked and jumped back every time
Sherlock’s small touches are the intimate but not sexual gestures of a new lover, the spontaneous caresses he’d come to doubt he’d ever want to make. Now he can’t stop himself. The silver-blond of John’s hair, his sharp profile, the marveling blue of his eyes when he looks up—everything makes Sherlock want to touch him. They haven’t done more than snog in a railway station and walk a kilometre joined at the hip, but Sherlock is almost sure they finally understand one another.
It took me a humiliatingly long time to identify John’s code. I spent twelve weeks gnawing at the songs as a complex signifying mechanism, perhaps multilingual, that had to be deciphered.
I went back to bed, got in as unobtrusively as I could, and was rewarded with a gentle and wholly unconscious little snore. Well, snuffle. It was a sound that Sherlock would never, ever admit he could make: unguarded, vulnerable. When he let himself go, when he let me in, I was completely undone. With one cautious hand, and holding my breath again, I stroked his hair until I felt him begin to wake up: because I could not
*"Sherlock's war on food" is a phrase I adore from the superlative SilentAuror's fic "Best of Three."
“Not for me: for Italy. For Europe. For migrants from Africa to Ukraine.” Zanardi’s voice was earnest but still collected; his speech patterns were familiar, his background smart but not aristocratic. Interesting.
“Which do you want first? Vows, or our first married sex?” Always knowing when I was overwhelmed, John; he was trying to lighten the tone.
I never wanted to leave him behind, to think me dead. It was, however, the only way to guarantee his life, and fortunately he’s not suspicious enough to doubt the truth of that particular magic trick. Doubting me was a reflex he had never acquired, though for his own sake he should have done.
Though what John had written on his blog seemed so much less angry than everything he’d said that night, and today he hadn’t seemed angry at all.
221B: check. Hives: check. And not just Regents Park, either. Sherlock had contacted the London Bee Keepers Association and through them, made contacts with a number of smaller collectives in the greater London area. John shouldn’t have been surprised at the rich diversity of aficionados, loners, and activists who turned up in the flat as the weeks and months rolled on; Sherlock, for all his posh background, had always been able to interact with all sorts, as long as all sorts didn’t mind his imperiousness and occasional acerbity.
The Rome he explores isn’t, for the most part, the Rome of mass tourism. If he’s ever to work in this city he has to know it as he knows London: its neighbourhoods and their inhabitants, the rhythms of the activities legal and illegal that characterise them. He reads the city section of all the newspapers, of all political stripes. He learns the names of the politically ascendant, the financially influential, the criminally dominant—and the overlap between them.
“I want you to make an honest man of me. I want a wedding. A December wedding. Are you in? Or do I have to drag you in?”
Sherlock tried again, lowering his voice. “It wasn’t the sex. Or rather, it was the sex, yes, but with you. Because it was you.”
Near the hotel he swerves into a whisky bar and a few minutes later fetches up at the counter with a bottle and, apparently, two glasses. When he’s paid I know there’s another reckoning due.
But “Ba” it was, whether it was a query, a summons, or a sleepy sigh. And as Sherlock looked quite unsurprised by it I thought he might have some idea as to where it had come from, though he said he hadn’t.
A short walk along the N70 and there it was, the footpath to Caherdaniel. Sherlock was right, of course, he literally couldn’t miss it. Early on he caught glimpses of the bay to the south, but soon found himself in a wide valley between two jagged lines of rocky hills.
from being used by other people, about other people. There must be words that are only for us, only for him.
To Sherlock’s intense relief, Molly Hooper led them not into the autopsy room but into a small conference room with a round metal table and punishingly uncomfortable chairs. She read out the pathology report impassively, detailing the evident cause of death (exsanguination) and some of the massive secondary injuries (
He’s never told me what was so horrid about his childhood that he almost never looks back at those years. For that matter, Da almost never talks about his life before meeting Ba, let alone about his childhood. Apparently they both sprang full-grown from the head of Athena, one brandishing a scalpel and the other a magnifying-glass.
But it was John who had the really shrewd idea. On the off-chance that his nurse Mary was more than a menial in the Moriarty hierarchy, he said, why not try to use her to lure Moran, and arrest them both at the same time? If he issued an impromptu invitation, Moran would be caught off-guard and with no time to set up a counter-force.
to kiss you. I have, for so long, and I do, so badly. Just that you’re also Will now, also Scotty. You’ve still got your contacts in, even.”
Nothing about this discussion had been comfortable, but “it lies in you” was especially disconcerting. He seemed to have finished, so I just said, “I'll try to remember that. How about getting some sleep?”
This ficlet's companion piece will post tomorrow, and Sherlock will tell us his top ten. Put this under "accidentally tactless": on Tumblr I am
“Revealing.” Here my voice wasn’t so controlled, and John leaned up and kissed me long and tenderly. As though he were trying to make up for that nightmarish, agonising time.
We extricated ourselves from each other and from our outerwear, then, agreeing with a glance that we were in no hurry to go out, from our clothing as well. We climbed into bed, and I stared at the mesmerising forms again.
“So really, it is the chair, isn’t it. You don’t want him to take your place.” Mike signalled the waitress for two more pints.
He flushed and I realised: of course. He'd be dancing with men. Some men. A man. Who would expect to lead. It wasn't my boss, I knew that. And, well, the field of suspects was not huge.
“Late yesterday I was informed of this tragic event by a subordinate assigned to monitoring police reports for data relevant to my office. He recognised the victim’s name: Erica Solomon. Not her real name.”
“When I heard your half of the conversation yesterday, I thought I could just ... do some follow-up.” John nudged him with his shoulder for a reaction.
What he knows without my saying is that sometimes I just want to concentrate on this, only doing, only feeling, watching, hearing, smelling him. He understands and lets me have my way, arouse and adore and admire him, my hands everywhere I can get them, stroking a nipple so lightly he thrusts upward for more pressure, or brushing along his perineum until he groans, or slipping a thumb into his beautiful mouth, or cupping his luscious buttocks to pull more of his cock into my mouth, or pushing a finger so slowly, so tenderly into him that he loses his breath and his words. And by the time he comes I am as aroused as he, as eager to receive caresses as I had been to give them, my skin as flooded with sensation as if he had been touching me all along.
The other is full-on, flat-out, over-the-top ugly, the full ticket to dreadful. A kind of lumpy, thick-yarn, kelly-green, shapeless affair hand-knitted by someone who had never seen knitting needles before and should be legally prevented from ever touching them again. Someone who had appliqued on the most lurid, malproportioned, and frankly depraved-looking reindeer in the history of Christmas. Its red nose was a little pom-pom, and it looked as though it had had a few too many.
He’s craning back to see my reaction, and I don’t know what I’m revealing but he remains quite serene.
His repertoire was immense, and he said that the instrument was leading him back in time, that his dramatic nineteenth-century go-to pieces sounded thin and tinny on this violin, so he played more and more baroque pieces, Bach, and the Italians. But sometimes he played plaintive old folk tunes, and sometimes sharp, jagged-edged songs by LP or Tom Waits or Leonard Cohen. He always stopped by ten, when I’d told him that quiet hours begin.
She tried to smile brightly, but her gentle eyes looked sad. “You’re moving on,” she said bravely. “You’ve met someone.”
After several songs new from the past couple of years, the last was, as promised, Dennis’s “Gone Too Soon.” His light, high tenor soared at the end—how did he manage to sing such sorrow without choking up?—and collective grief made a community out of the audience.
Well, I never could resist Nicole Kidman, could I. Her lookalike was even called Nicola. She admitted I wasn’t the first person to tell her she was Kidman’s astral twin. We talked about Rosie’s case; I told her Rosie’s mother was dead, and that she was a very advanced little girl for her age, and that I bet she heard that from all the parents.
follow him, of course. The one or two times I’d tried to tail someone in the course of a case, he’d let me know in no uncertain terms that even a toddler would have clocked me. Disguise was equally out of the question. As for hiring someone—the fact that I’d even considered it was proof of increasing desperation.
I assumed he was projecting, and said so. “Is that how you felt about it yourself? That losing me was worse than never having known me?”
And with sweeter memories came greater pain. This time he couldn’t tell himself he’d been forced to leave John by circumstances beyond his control; no, he’d had to leave because he’d made himself hateful to John, unforgivable. Treated him cavalierly, at the very least. He couldn’t blame Moriarty for it: he’d lost John all by himself.
. But I did. I do. Her little face, her expressions and gestures, her desires and demands, were a perfect blend of her multi-faceted parents. But as she grew, she also grew into herself, a new compound where neither Mary nor John dominated.
Pinning my gracious and unruffled persona back in place, I took her arm above the elbow and guided her to the bar next door, watching in my mind’s eye as Sherlock put on his clothes again, a smile both seductive and mocking on his beautiful, mobile face. No one would understand better than he the need to pursue a case, I thought. No one better than he this network of obligation, of favours given and banked against a future need.
She looked uncertain, at least as far as he could make out between the tears and blotches; but she mopped at her eyes again when the street door opened downstairs and John’s voice called up, “Hey, where’s the music?”
The Rover pulled up by the kitchen door, and John got out and opened the door for the hellhounds. He signaled that they could get out and run, but the hounds had never seen snow, and they exited apprehensively. One wary, one curious, they thrust snouts into four inches of snow and tossed it in the air. They seemed at a loss to connect the different texture of the ground and the white flakes falling on their thick coats.
The smile he gives me back is breathtaking; my bow hovers a moment and into the silence Watson teases, “Ba, play that song that goes “‘Holly Jolly?’”
He made music, alone and in company. He picked up a steel-string guitar for the first time in twenty years and found his fingers hadn’t forgotten much; it gave him a different soundscape to accompany soloists with. He began to sing himself again, for the first time since his voice broke and he was finally allowed to stop being a chorister.
In the event Sherlock didn’t seem to want to discuss his reading. Or to talk. Or to look at me. When he did look up, he wasn’t there. At all. He’d retreated behind a thin but impenetrable film of ice. Subtle, but unmistakable.
“Of course I am. Wherever you are, I’m coming along. I’ll clear out of the flat, and I’ll tell our friends that I’m leaving for Ireland for the next however long. Do you—mean to tell them where you are, now?”
“Hardly enough for your pain and suffering, I’d have said.” The tone was equivocal. Wry? Chagrined? Remorseful?
He wasn't talking to me; he was chatting with the older woman in the seat opposite. She was clearly in ecstasy, arthritic fingers digging deep but gentle into the silky black coat of a great black lab mix. The dog in turn grinned at her and made an attempt to put first one paw and then the other onto her lap. She pushed him away but so carefully, whispering,
But there were fireplaces, and candles, and 15-year-old single malt, and two Holmes brothers in a mellow mood. They were entertaining, without any of the acerbity or rivalry that usually edged in even on a Christmas Eve.
“You’re right. It’s juvenile. It’s not Aubrey’s—sorry, Alastair’s fault—he’s got a posh name.” Maybe he shouldn’t have taken his shirt off so soon; Sherlock’s gaze had dropped to his chest, and he was all but licking his lips.
John loved the sparkling gold mosaics of the Cappella Palatina. Now that we knew we’d be coming back, we decided to let the Chapel stand in for all the ancient Palermitan churches whose mosaics we would admire at leisure next time—even Monreale, that eighth wonder of the world.
With so much sensation flooding my brain it was easy to follow that quiet, intense order. I sat down on the side of the bed. I pulled him to me, then down onto the bed, and stretched out beside him and kissed what was left of his frown into a panting grimace. Then he was reaching for me, pulling me on top of him. I pushed him back down and stretched his hands out over his head with my fingers gently circling his wrists. He had taut, compact nipples, a small divot of a scar just to the side of his sternum. Prominent rib cage and collarbones, and a neck that went on forever.
, where Sherlock is desperate for inspiration for a gift for John, it's suitable Christmas Eve reading. Text fic, not too long, and -- well, sparkly. With
After a moment he went on, “It wasn’t that hard, you know. Once I got over the worst of the mind fog. Grief really doesn’t help cognition.”
“Now. What do you say to a shower? And then we’re going to clear off that bed of yours, because I’m not sleeping with the Definitive Treatise on Tobacco-Ash.”
So if he’d looked for information online, he hadn’t found it; I had. The arrest was a major story in the Italian press.
After weeks of tailing, wiretapping, and other forms of electronic surveillance, we finally had an arrest planned—actually a large and complex sting operation, and Zanardi had asked for Sherlock to be there with us. That was fine with me, but if Sherlock was there I wanted John in on it as well. A few days earlier I’d had John summoned to the morgue, when I’d just sent Sherlock there; but I didn’t know the outcome, if they’d seen each other.
” I could imagine him horrified, curious, surprised. Probably not surprised that I loved him, only surprised that I admitted it, and very surprised that I was leaving for Italy, possibly forever.
The dogs were very obviously her idea of a replacement and a distraction for us. As puppies they fulfilled all the meanings of the word “distraction” (as in “driving me to”). We had squabbled over their sleeping protocols, until the day they shredded Sherlock’s precious blankets. After that they slept in the sitting room.
hear, and he wasn’t having to stop every four notes, or actually hardly ever). That wasn’t what started the alarm bells. No, that happened when I realised that Rosie spoke French.
And then, there was John, slamming the door of a cab and striding to him, sinking to the kerb and pulling him to his chest as he had never, ever done.
But a quirky plot took hold of me, where John reaches out to Sherlock in his own version of the newspaper agony columns that ACD Holmes perused so assiduously. He is hoping but not completely sure that there is a living Sherlock out there to hear his song requests--because John has applied Sherlock’s methods to the man’s own death.
Sherlock had found himself staring at the successive layers of fabric—shirt, jacket, overcoat—draped elegantly over Zanardi’s torso by the hand resting in his pocket. Good lines, excellent tweed, fine stripes of pearl grey and charcoal. Well made, well-fitting. Sherlock thought of Via Panisperna in Rome, where tailors still did bespoke work without pretension, fanfare, or extortionate costs. So absent was he that Zanardi had to repeat himself:
“This could be the break we’ve been waiting for. I mean, we’ve done well so far, but this—visibility in a series or a film—could make us the next De Danaan, or Clannad.”
Our days in John’s Bromley flat were a study in beige. I kept scanning the drapes, upholstery, cushions, “art” on the walls, carpeting (unpleasant), looking for some flash of contrast to the relentless neutrals. The flat was unnaturally empty, nothing left lying on the end tables, no cheerful confusion in the bookshelves. Even the books were bland colours, and all but arranged by size. (Did she buy them in bulk at Ikea?) The occasional note of burgundy, a sober colour in itself, positively blazed next to the four hundred variations on sand, twine, écru, tan, and bone. The horrible suspicion arose that Watson's tastes might be shaped for life.
Trembling. Unmasked, and laid bare down to the marrow. We both are. Winded, and shaken, and dizzy with dissolution and aftermath. It may be his arms I see at my waist, it may be my own, I don’t know where he ends and I begin. I don’t know how I look or sound or feel or smell and I could not care less; I can relinquish the need to seem, I can simply be. And that, after all these years of longing,
“If Sherlock were here last night Moran would shoot him, and, inevitably, John. And if it was just an agreeable date for two, she would close the curtains to signal that there was no need for Moran to intervene at all. Strangely enough, she did not consider that John might have handed off the entire encounter to you, Sherlock, leaving himself free to outflank Moran.”
It was immediately clear that he was a rival, and a formidable one. He didn’t look like it at first: on the short side for a Brit, on the shady side of forty, and not especially prepossessing in appearance. But he had a powerful presence that Dr Hooper was certainly deferring to, and between him and Sherlock there was some kind of force field that made them into one unit. It was a strange kind of energy, though, as if they were both positive and negative magnetic poles at once—both attracting and repelling.
? When did I—” but John remembered, with sinking dread, condemning the thorough-going tedium of that work. It had seemed so meticulous as to be pedestrian. Ridiculous of him, not to mention unfair, when
The first time I came home to find Sherlock and Rosie having a kip together, I’d been operating all day and was fairly elated at having resolved an unexpected complication in my patient’s shattered knee. I breezed in after seven, three hours late, to find the flat suspiciously quiet. There was a fire trying to burn in the hearth, but it hadn’t been tended recently and the sitting-room was nearly dark.
Attention swung back round to Harry and Clara, who took it good-naturedly until the party began to break up.
Sherlock had organised one over-the-top wedding already, and it wasn’t a happy memory. We began our planning with the exclusions: no formal wedding wear, no wedding attendants, and emphatically no professional photographer. No music, no flowers, no customised vows. Literally nothing of the expensive and uncomfortable wedding paraphernalia of 2014. Just a private ceremony and a party Rosie could enjoy and even remember one day, when we were both gone. She’d been present at the marriage of her father and mother, after all; now she could be conscious at the marriage of her two fathers.
One Sunday night in November I got a text from John suggesting it might be time for Sherlock to start back to consulting, and the very next afternoon a quite famous body turned up in Kensington of all places, dead some days and hanging from a cargo hook. If that couldn’t intrigue Sherlock, buck him up a bit, then I didn’t know him at all. I sent him a text, non-committal, didn’t want to emphasize how long it’d been since he’d been in on a case.
Fair: I’d never leveled with Sherlock, never acknowledged what and who I really wanted. To add insult to injury I’d goaded him to take up with Irene Adler. Unfair: I was turning myself inside out trying to find every goddamned way this was unfair.
All night long I wrote to him, trying to be both equable and fair, when in fact I was so angry and desperate that I wrote and discarded many more pages than I finally kept. Toward dawn I decided that what I had, would have to suffice. And writing to him did restore some of my equanimity, even some of my understanding for John. He couldn’t help what he was, if he wasn’t even aware of what I wanted, let alone of what he perhaps wanted. I was desolate to lose him, and Watson as well, but I meant what I told him: I finally had a shot at freeing myself from an obsession that seems to have meant only misery for as long as I can remember.
When Sherlock had asked to put his things in the glass room on the terrace, after my initial disappointment it had honestly been a relief. Both Chiara, a gentle but private seventeen-year-old, and Luca, at fourteen boisterous but insecure, would have been hurt to find their bedroom reassigned. I tried to tamp down the thought of the cleaning lady—I’d have more plausible deniability if Sherlock clearly had his own sleeping space.
Happily, his host, already wincing at his own presumption, didn’t notice. “But of course you’d never want to put your own practice on hold for a whole term. Dozens of cases would pass you by. But perhaps you could do an accelerated summer seminar, say two weeks?”
We have an hour before Watson will begin to fuss in her cot. A private hour to ourselves, and afterwards I’ll ask John to marry me. He’ll say yes, and then he’ll go upstairs and bring Watson down for tea, as I’d taken her up for her nap. She won't know that anything has changed while she was sleeping. She’ll tell him everything she’s done today, and he’ll make tea, and I’ll slip out for some milk for the morning, and think about how we’ll spend the rest of our lives giving the lie to "No happy love."
“He didn’t tell you where he was going? Not even how to reach him?” John remembered Sherlock’s tenderness with Mrs Hudson, his ferocity on her behalf. He’d never have thought Sherlock would leave her. But then again.
John sat up and listened but heard nothing, stretched silently. A few joints popped, not silently, and there was a distinct tightness in his calves: no longer used to walking twelve miles, after six sedentary weeks.
beautiful, and I felt yet another shock of pure lust at the sight of that pale, long neck, those eerie blue-green eyes, that mouth so lush and yet so firmly closed, that cloud of hair that looked like it was made to be touched. But that was just projection; I was the one aching to touch it.
By the time I was done with rehab a full year later, I could still look good on a dance floor, but I couldn’t do any of the jumps or landings that professional dance requires. So I packed those dreams away and started looking for a job where I could make a difference. A career counselor suggested teaching, nursing, or the police. Easy choice: I don’t much like kids and I
I kneel behind him on the bed and begin running my hands slowly up and down his thighs, going higher each time until my thumbs are resting at the juncture of muscled leg and lush arse. He is so beautiful, his bollocks compressed between his legs, round and sweet as his buttocks, and I stare a moment before lowering my face to lip softly at his pale skin stippled with gooseflesh. I smell a blend of my soap and his own scent, with an overlay of musky arousal.
“He runs a private clinic there, for sport injuries. Looks like a good set-up. He’s, erm, expanding.” John sounded … tentative. Why?
“One last thing. This new case may turn out to be far more important than the first. Let us avoid connecting them in the public imagination. I don’t want to be associated with this new investigation in any way, in any statement official or unofficial from the Met. If asked, I will tell any member of the press that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on a case I am not involved in—which would not be a lie. With any luck they won’t remember that I routinely refuse, on the same grounds, to comment on the cases I
Hating myself as I did it. I knew what it did to Sherlock when I shut him out, or subjected him to my ruthless straighty-matey routine: it killed something in him, every time. But the raging erection I’d woken up with, after dreaming of him in his exotic dancing get-up and face glitter—panicked me again. For all I knew he was asexual, wanted closeness but not sex. And I was going to scare him away, at the rate of arousal I had going.
So much had happened since then. So many losses, reboots, corrections of course. And through it all I’d never stopped mourning surgery, and I’d never stopped long enough to see that—well, that my hand no longer shook. Ever. Not out of tension, exhaustion, emotion. Once I noticed, even, I never connected it to surgery. Until the night in Italy when Sherlock had said, “You hand never shakes anymore. Did you notice?” and said that maybe I could operate again.
about it. I need to take it in.” I try to keep my tone light. It isn’t his fault that I haven’t sensed any of this, and I don’t want him to sit here and stew while I think my way through it.
Still, as Sherlock (just a little too flustered for dignity) makes the hurried round of electronic devices, John has time to reflect that they don’t have to stay stood up by the door to the hall. They have options. Several rooms, many pieces of furniture, scores of square metres to choose from. If he has any say in the matter they’re going to choose every single one, sooner or later. Starting with Sherlock’s bedroom, which this evening does not seem to be emitting any repelling vibrations
I didn’t really hesitate when I saw him in danger. I never had. He was mine to protect, and I never saw the point of cutting things too fine.
He was wiping his eyes and so was I, but not for the same reason. He’d said “nearly killed myself,” and that was too much, it was insupportable. I couldn’t take this just now, not while I could finally see him again after leaving to
She winced; I must’ve sounded too enthusiastic. “Yes. Six years after this one. But more than just that. There’s so much to see in Milan, it isn’t just commerce and fashion. It doesn’t get the credit it deserves.”
“Always. I’m going to...what was it?” (though I knew perfectly well) “‘Take care of you, body and mind, heart and soul.’ We have hours before we have to leave, and” (pulling out his shirt, opening its buttons from the bottom up) “we have the most luxurious shower and bed in the Serenissima Repubblica di Venezia.”
with asparagus—a dish I’d once wowed Giulia with—or pasta with asparagus. Just as well it takes time to make the broth and prepare the risotto, as Sherlock wasn’t in when I got home. He’d left a note, though.
is for the only one I see,” Cole trills flirtatiously, and John is as happy as he ever remembers being, watching Sherlock whirl the unexpectedly gorgeous Donovan round the floor as the other dancers make room for them. “
A moment later he was back at the table, addressing his own plate with the look of a man wholly absorbed in my superb vegetarian lasagna.
I always thought I was finished underestimating John Watson. Misunderstanding him. That I wouldn’t make this or that mistake again. I learned from each error, and
In the other photo I was wrapped around John in bed, in a pose very familiar from post-coital bonding; I could feel his chest under my hand in the same way. We always fell asleep with my cheek on his shoulder—though I didn't stay there long enough to strain it.
was going on? My cheeks started to burn as I realised how stupidly optimistic I’d been about Sherlock’s recovery. Addiction isn’t a cold. You don’t get over it with bone broth and bed rest.
“You proposed to me once, and I said yes. I proposed to you, and you said yes, but here we are, still not married. Care to remedy that? How about a December wedding?”
We held each other unspeaking, just getting our breathing and heartbeats back within shouting distance of normal as we kissed and smiled, flexed and stroked, marveled and savoured and sighed.
“No, I’m extrapolating. I loved you as Sherlock, and I loved you as Will. They’re facets of you, an essential you, that’s all. They’re not different

To his credit, he was contrite: “Sorry, sorry. I didn’t mean to dredge up the ... past. French because Sami is also fluent in it; the piano because it’s a good base for other instruments. I’ve been teaching Watson music and a language because those skills literally grow the brain. Because children her age are sponges for both. Because they’re an immense advantage cognitively, socially, and emotionally. All reasons I’ve told you at least ten times.”
). Occasionally his operating schedule collided with a case, but the tension and alienation of the previous spring were not even a distant memory: Watson loved school, I actually did enjoy having more time for The Work, and I didn’t mind admitting that John had been, well,
We woke up again in the night, of course, and dragged ourselves into the shower, though the resulting cleanliness soon became moot. I couldn’t keep my hands off Sherlock, my mouth either for that matter, and under the rinsing stream I fell to my knees and took him in my mouth.
“What—um,” he got out, before his voice cracked. “What—um, do you think Sherlock—” He stopped there.
And that’s all it took, really. A romantic evening, romantic songs, a spotlight of dance magic, and my heart in my eyes. Oh, and body language, as Holmes had said. I didn’t go home alone; August tucked my frothy, starry skirt into the cab behind me as though I were the Queen and climbed in after me.
He resolutely refrained from texting Lestrade for some encouragement. What would he even ask, anyway? He’d just … wait.
It was a bitch for John Watson, as well. The evening after the sting operation was successfully concluded I went round to Baker Street at seven. What had happened the previous night, the escalation, the touching: it made me optimistic about what Sherlock would say to my proposition. Proposal. Whatever it was. But I was also careful; despite the unmixed triumph of the operation he’d retreated at once, put me off until tonight. I was eager for an answer, but I didn’t want to push him into a no by being too impatient to wait for a yes.
like you, John, and that’s all. He doesn’t hold himself like you. He doesn’t talk, think, or care like you. He doesn’t make me laugh like you. I’m not attracted to him, because he isn’t—he isn’t you. That’s the long and the short”—he sent a telling glance at John—“of it.”
“Don’t be burning them at both ends, now, dads,” said Watson, giggling. She went bright pink when she realised her semi-innuendo, and we burst out laughing too when we pulled out the anatomically correct, luridly coloured, and (as to size) rather
like a growled “nothing,” you know? But he left the room before I could ask if he wanted to talk about it, and nothing about the front pages at least of the
But for a man making a new life, it was a perfect place to play with the widest possible variety of traditional music experts. Practically a university of folk music. And a few miles up or down the coast he’d find somewhere he could actually live. Put down roots. Learn to live on his own, without any of his crutches. Without The Work, or the Flatmate, or the Drugs. The Brother. The City.
) in malicious mischief, and eventually wore themselves out and flopped—the names appeared out of thin air. And settled on the dogs, who learned them quickly and accepted them without demur: Merry and Pippin. Again, no commentary invited on which is which.
“Oh, good. Won’t have to work at it, then.” He smiles against Sherlock’s kiss; the distinct change in tone hasn’t diminished the urgency at all.
in the world got into John--or what John got into, though I'm guessing it was a single malt. I've never known him so waggish before, but he can always surprise me.
I was to be a witness, not a target, as the victims who had been raped in that area over the past months were all women. Sadly, it was almost certain that not all had come forward, and the police had taken an appallingly long time to notice the recurrence of the pattern: a woman out alone for an evening in a dance club, given a drink by a seductive stranger, waking up the next morning in a strange place, clothing disarranged and—well, the whole horror of it.
I downloaded and listened, several times in fact. The words were simple, but the images so rich. A pikestaff to the heart.
“Let me get something straight,” he said, carefully. “What you said, before, about me and the island of women.”
And now he's done it again. Apparently my partner, life partner, co-parent, and love of my life has yet another obsessive dislike that brings out the contemptuous loathing I’ve seen so little of lately. This is one I’d not noticed before. (Did we never spend enough late Decembers together?)
“Only an academic one. Lecturer in Criminology at Oxford.” His tone was airy and offhand now, and John’s antennae went up.
So. I made a decision for John, about something important to John. I didn’t consult him; I made the decision based on my own discomfort with his... with his thinking he had no choice about whether or not to be a surgeon again. I didn’t ask him, deliberately didn’t let him have a say in advance. How could I have thought that John would be fine with that? I thought it would give him a sense of freedom, and that if he kept on in the Work with me it would be because he’d chosen it, not because he had no other option.
And just like that they were shouting with laughter, accomplices in their unpopular opinions and decidedly
We stop a bit short of the summit; I pointed out that the wind will be at its worst at the most exposed point, and we won’t be able to settle in and survey the blue-white winter fields and hillsides if our eyelashes are frozen shut. That had prompted an eyeroll but reluctant concession.
In any case, my reply was easy this time: I’d had the song on my mind for months, and miraculously, the line number worked out.
John knew all about imprinting, and beginning as you mean to go on. There was every opportunity here for buyer’s reverse, if not remorse; on waking, Sherlock might take a step backward and let a paralysing mud of awkwardness come creeping back in. Nope. Not happening. He wasn’t going to give the man even ten seconds to start second-guessing this new development. Because it was clearly the right thing for both of them, and because it had taken fucking
The song is an incongruous choice for Greg, since neither of them has any amorous history with the other, but he seems to be determined to make Sherlock notice all the lyrics. What is Greg playing at? Staring up at Sherlock now, Greg seems to smile as though proud of him for figuring something out. He murmurs, “Good man. Sometimes you just have to dare, don’t you? Sometimes you just have to take a chance.” Sherlock’s eyes fly open, astonished. Is it Greg who’s figured something out?
My other reason for hoping: Sherlock was uprooted. Transplanted. He might be distracted for a while by the alien beauty of Rome, but he couldn’t settle there, not for the long term. I wasn’t above seizing on the advantage that our city could lend me: London was the sprawling, secret siren that Sherlock knew intimately and craved infinitely. No doubt Rome had everything a city could offer, and probably a lot that London never could; but it wasn’t his city, and it never could be. London was his, and mine. Ours.
It was so good to hear him say “John.” Absurdly, stupidly good. If he only had one day, he was going to see how many times he could make “Will” say his name in the course of it.
Procoffeinating is an amazing artist, and "Drawn to Stars" owes them a great deal. Now so does "Winter Light."
He’d set down his tea mug on the night table with a truculent thump, then sat bolt upright in bed with a zing of energy racing through him, at an email he’d never dared hope to see.
“I love you.” Blurted it out like a teenager. “I couldn’t say it in a text. It isn’t even the right word. It’s too little, it’s too banal, it—”
They realised at the same time that they were still partly dressed, and Sherlock stepped away and opened his own flies. Black pants and trousers came away at the same time, and he bent to pull off his socks, taking the opportunity to look up and see John from a different angle. Saliva flooded his mouth as he saw John’s cock spring free of his own pants, heavy and full and thick as he had imagined it from years of secretive observation and speculation. (A disastrous “He always walks like that” had once burst out of him in a display of drug-induced disinhibition, and Mary, he knew, had not missed it.)
John had left abruptly, his lips compressed, his shoulders hunched. Why? What had he seen? The fiddle solo had commanded all his own attention, but—ah. That verse.
We still have the fall to talk through, and my absence, and my clownish return and all that came after. As we always should have done, without hiding or manipulation or violence.
John’s looking at Sherlock now, trying to make him see but it’s clear that he doesn’t, he’s stuck in the story where it’s all his fault because it was in his power to make it all go differently.
“You always look ... incredible.” He unbuttoned the top shirt button, pressed his mouth to the hollow of Sherlock’s throat, felt the tension ease a hair as Sherlock gave a low hum.
The event was winding down without my having gathered much more about the school than I had from the headmistress—beyond the sense that music, at least, was a regular part of the curriculum. That boded well. I said goodbye to Nicola, caught Sherlock’s eye, and met him in the corridor to walk home.
No reply; just an inhale, suddenly loud in the quiet flat. Pale light from the street-lamps leached into the sitting-room, and I knew he could see me better than I could see him. I tried again.
Her bright tone didn’t quite conceal the determination edging her voice like the thin steel wire in a florist’s ribbon. And just like that, the penny dropped.
Don’t come at me about Mephistopheles and Asmodeus. They are not permanent; it took some time before the puppies revealed their true names.
If it even was Sherlock’s violin. Perhaps he’d dreamed the whole thing. Were violins so distinctive? Were melodic frills and flourishes?
He seemed to like street markets and to loathe supermarkets, though he never explained why. The quality of the food for sale certainly had nothing to do with it, as he was mostly indifferent to what he ate. In the evenings I was home by eight if I could manage it, and made us a quick pasta. Having usually skipped lunch he tended to eat dinner, not always noticing what it was; since I was more interested in what came after, I may have cut a corner or two to get us out of the kitchen and into the bedroom the faster.
? The editor had admired the summary version on The Science of Deduction blog, and thought it a vital contribution that should be given both the imprimatur of a learned society—the British Academy of Medical Forensic Sciences—and distribution in full among its expert members.
“What—um,” he got out, before his voice cracked. “What—um, do you think Sherlock—” He stopped there.
When the boy’s legs buckled he took Sherlock down with him, both of them hitting the floor with a stunning jolt. He was paralyzed with something like guilt and grief long enough to be taken again, shoved into a truck on landing, and hauled away to Serbia. (What John always, always calls “Fucking Serbia,” thinking only of his aborted mission. If he knew what had happened there before Sherlock had come home, he’d call it much worse.)
John had goggled, incredulous and frankly unwilling. He couldn't imagine why Sherlock should choose this occasion to set aside his haughty reclusiveness, or why John, whose dancing skills Sherlock didn’t hesitate to term “appalling,” should have to accompany him. In retrospect he doesn’t think he ever actually agreed, but this evening Sherlock had bundled him into a tux and a taxi as though the whole affair had been settled weeks back.
“But the material point—and here you need to pay careful attention, this is the heart of it—is that I don’t want to be with anyone but you.” He leaned in and kissed me, warm and quick. “I only want you. Both by desire, and by decision, and by promise.”
of ever organising another Met Gala. His first was going to be his last, he said. Too time-consuming, stressful, and complicated. He’d got what he’d been aiming for, and saw no reason for a repeat performance. But I did.
“Well. Perhaps you’re right. I should have asked. But I also wanted to solve the puzzle by myself. Pity. I’ll think it through next time. I could’ve saved myself a lot of stress. And it was so time-consuming. Who knows what cases we’ve missed in the past week?” The glance was both regretful and playful, and John’s heart flipped. Sherlock wasn’t falling for Julian, and he wasn’t rebuffing John—in fact, he was praising the writing he’d always disparaged.
Somehow we got ourselves to the bed and sat down, then I laid him out and straddled his thighs and drank in the sight of him as he did of me. Every touch, every stroke over his chest and collarbones and sides, every kiss to his throat or nipple, was a declaration of love and he felt it. I saw that in his eyes welling up, his eyelids fluttering closed. I felt it in his changed breathing. And when I lowered my mouth to take him in I tasted it, smelled it, I heard it in his cries and there was nothing between me and Sherlock anymore, nothing to part or hurt us. I’d finally told him the truth, and I’d finally seen his.
This was an oblique approach. And unwelcome. Was he asking me to compose something for this? Record it, and send it? It felt manipulative. As if he thought I couldn’t reject an overture that was putatively about his daughter.
That couldn’t be right. I knew I’d been wrong when I nearly shut down our relationship over a misconstrued (and incomplete) message string on his phone. Adults are responsible for their (our) own behaviour. But if he really had been initiating a flirtation with that Nicole Kidman lookalike, would my reaction be his responsibility then?
“You’re not fooling anyone. You love it. You’re going to look like a shooting star in the lifts.” He wasn’t wrong. The dress was miraculous that way, gathering all the light and drawing all the attention. No one would even see him, in his black tails.
After the trumpet solo the duet comes to a close, and Molly and Sherlock glide to a stop, Molly’s gown swirling around her before it too hangs still. Something in Molly’s expression is poignant, like a farewell, John thinks. Sherlock smiles, puts his hands on her shoulders, and kisses her cheek. Then he leads her off the dance floor to the little table where she left her wrap. With a pointed grin Greg thanks John for the dance, and hurries off to join her.
And he does, he dances Sherlock slowly across the bedroom floor, holds him tight. Sensation sings along Sherlock's nerves and skin as John does his best Elvis croons:
“So the Rich Brook story wasn’t entirely false,” I mused. “Always the strongest kind of lie.” Somehow I wasn’t surprised.
was a signal, if anything was. And everyone there saw it, and looked astonished, looked embarrassed, or looked away.
“Two nights ago. Minutes before you texted. When I read it I felt alive again. For the first time in months... years, really. I nearly broke an ankle racing to find my phone and turn it on, to see if you’d text. And you did. That’s when I told Roberto that this experiment was over.” The rush of relief in his voice—as though he were reliving that moment again.
He evicted that unwelcome distraction by taking Sherlock in his arms and kissing tenderly across chest, nipples, and throat, murmuring words he couldn’t swear made any sense.
I’d invited Ella, but she had professional boundaries I respected. (“It’s either come to your wedding or continue as your therapist, John. Which do you prefer?”) I vetoed Bill Wiggins before Sherlock could even bring him up; and I couldn't imagine inviting James Sholto to a second Watson wedding that—well, the first had hardly gone well for him, had it, and that was reason enough to spare him the second.
Just the tiniest dab of his tongue on the head of Sherlock’s cock, and a moan filled John’s head, a flood of light as he registered the textures and tastes of soft skin and hardening erection. He slicked his tongue along the shaft and down to explore testicles and perineum and the taut little pucker as Sherlock gasped and sighed and writhed, pulling a foot up onto the bed to give John better access.
Just for a moment he put his hand on my own over his ankle, flashed a quick smile, and started Kurosawa again.
The radio announcer had mentioned John’s name and an absent friend, but never mentioned the regularity of his requests. Perhaps it was something many sorrowing people did, and it would have been tactless for them to draw attention to it. So, a trick wouldn’t seem a real danger, unless it was from the radio programme itself.
I’d hoped the next few weeks we could get used to being together with Watson in Baker Street, where we’ve spent so long
Morning sleep after morning sex may well be Sherlock’s favourite thing in the world. For John’s sake he would even admit the appeal of breakfast.
. But much worse: I can’t trust Sherlock if he’s seeing Wiggins on the sly. And if I asked him he was bound to withdraw, whether the circumstances were innocent or not.
He held out for another twenty minutes, then apologised to the group that he had to bow out early. He felt Patrick’s gaze on him throughout the good-natured ribbing, the scattered reminders for the next night’s gig, and the repeated “where’s John?” This too would have been a bit hard, seeing Sherlock disappear into a life that had no room for him.
I sighed. It was a relief, a twist of anxiety I’d been trying to ignore. So Sherlock hadn’t even known it was a letter from me when he'd got it and discarded it. Still, I couldn’t help wondering what would have happened if he’d opened and read it the night it arrived.
London was calling them, but they’d be going back changed. There'd always be a substrate of Ireland in them now, audible in their speech and their intonation. As to what they would do once they were back in the city—there was time to figure that out. Oceans of it.
Morstan’s language took a deplorably vulgar turn as the agents uncuffed her from the chair and frog-marched her down the stairs, but I was too anxious to appreciate it. I wheeled around and barked at my brother, “What happened? Who’s been shot? Is John alright?”
They don’t talk about this, naturally. If either had been adept at such conversations, neither would have reached the other only after and through the ruin of every nearer tie. They turn away from words, focus only on their journey back through the south of Lazio. They will not go to Naples now, with its glittering bay and sky; they are headed back to Rome.
“But also: no. The very beginning of our—collaboration—was the Jeff Hope case. Moriarty was behind that. Our work with the Met afterwards, our whole time together—he was the catalyst for all of it. If it was all Moriarty, and Moriarty was dead—what need was there for Sherlock Holmes? At best, the Work—the mission—was over. At worst, it was never anything but an illusion.”
. The pale length of that neck, freckles showing here and there; the dark thatch around his frankly gorgeous cock. The elegant curve of lower back and lush arse—he could drive me mad just standing there, but he wasn’t, oh, he wasn’t, he was reaching for me.
John’s hands had left his hips and traveled to his arms; John’s tongue, slick and firm, slid along his own, and it was as warm as the sun and sweet as honey—oh, sweeter, and John’s kisses effortlessly rewired an entire central nervous system.
Some are protected by their very transparency. He’ll think you can’t actually mean what you’re clearly saying, so you’re completely safe saying it. He’ll assume you’re speaking in some kind of code, probably your patented snark. “That’s what I was suggesting!” “I am a ridiculous man, redeemed only by the warmth and constancy of your friendship.”
He reaches her in time to get to the edge of the dance floor as the gentle bounce of the introduction begins. She’s a tall woman and they do indeed dance cheek to cheek without any uncomfortable contortion or forced embrace. Her emerald-green sheath keeps her movements relatively sedate, but she’s a self-assured dancer and he knows they look striking together. They haven’t been talking as they dance, but he remembers her as
We were tired that one morning, so very tired. Nights and days spent making love: deliriously happy, exhilarating, and energising. Talking about what had gone so wrong between us: certainly that was rewarding, and revealing. But also sobering, and somehow draining.
I didn’t speak as we picked up the key and went upstairs and down the plush corridor to our room. And still didn’t, as we took off our coats and flung them on a gilt chair, and turned to look at each other.
Well, that was satisfying. Once I’d have found this overture gratifying, flattering. Not anymore, and especially not right now, when my home life had suddenly become suffused with a tension I hadn’t experienced in
” Sherlock takes his cue from Roberto, though they hadn’t discussed language, and Elena’s brows shoot up. She continues in Italian, though, responding to Sherlock with the same formal pronoun that he’s chosen as suitable for a lover’s mother.
) up from the sofa. Plastered himself to him knee to breastbone, held his hips with unmistakable intent.
And God, he was so responsive. His plush, curious mouth, tongue moving tenderly, tight little vocalisations as he burrowed blindly closer. The counter dug into my lower back and I shifted up to sit on it, pulling him between my legs at an angle that had him groaning rather loudly for one person, until I realised it was both of us responding to that perfect angle of contact. Half hard to rock hard and searching, questing.
I hadn’t been the object of a pursuit so dogged since I was an adolescent, when kids my age hadn’t mastered the art of giving up in the face of obvious indifference. Mary was an attractive woman, confident and used to getting her way with men. But I hadn’t encouraged her at all, and there was no obvious reason for her to keep at it.
He hadn’t seen much of John and Rosie in the past two weeks; John’s visits seemed to be tapering off as Sherlock got better (“better”?). He didn’t even text daily anymore, and Sherlock wouldn't text him first: if John was giving him a tactful message, he was going to accept and respect it. His place in John’s life was circumscribed now; as the talons of addiction slowly loosened, John seemed to be putting distance between them. Once Sherlock didn’t need his medical attention, John wasn’t proposing contact of a more optional, casual nature.
He’d driven over with Ash after an early meal at hers, leaving the noisy kids to come later with the quiet, steady husband. Ash was quiet too for a change, and he didn’t try to deduce but he did wonder.
Which put me in mind of the uncomfortable conversation in progress on my phone. I picked it up and checked the text string. Yes, there were new messages.
There's a whisper of a Brassens song, "Une jolie fleur," where he writes, "mon coeur lui pardonne / d'avoir mis mon coeur à feu et à sang / pour qu'il ne puisse plus servir à personne" (My heart forgives her / for having set it to burning and bleeding so that it would be of no further use to anyone).
Dance was always my thing. I was naturally good at it, so I worked hard at it because I got results miles better than my peers. All kinds of dance—tap, ballet, ballroom, hip hop, interpretive, it was all good. Well, maybe not folk dances. Though that was less about the dances than the people who did them. Nothing spontaneous or creative; they were all self-conscious purists, always anxious about whether things were “authentic.” Or so it seemed to me.
“Not for most people. You’ve done more work than I have with professionals, but I’ve done more with amateurs or absolute non-dancers, and most of them just want to be able to give up their anxiety about not being perfect. We
This wasn’t quite the heart of it, but it was a large part of what he hadn’t been able to rest without telling Sherlock. It felt good to get the words out.
Fred was in, and free, and surprisingly excited to come over and get Rosie up from her nap and play at fitting coloured plastic shapes into a cylinder, a Christmas toy I’d expected her to outgrow quickly but the charm of which was proving surprisingly durable. He was a head taller than me, ten years younger, Jamaican, and had quite possibly the best speaking voice in London outside of 221B Baker Street. Rosie wouldn't be out of sorts at finding him there when she woke; but then, she was accustomed to being taken care of by quite a few different admirers, and was never fussed.
They wouldn't want to live always in such isolation, but in the winter light, when time cracks open, there are always—only—two of them.
“Well, he’s going down, anyway. Fingerprints on the glass, your testimony, the drug in his pocket and in my bloodstream. The D.I. says they should be able to get him on at least some of the others, too.” She was back to staring down at her coffee.
That worked so well that I started doing it most mornings, and we had a dance or two most evenings. A week later I picked out another Conte, one I was fairly sure he’d know: “Sotto le stelle del jazz.” When it got warmer we could dance outside, under the jazz stars; for now the sitting-room would do.
. He hadn’t taken that tone of kindly tolerance I’d expected he would, after observing such a familiar fugue state; he didn’t sound quizzical or amused at my inability to pass for normal.
I don’t ever want a repeat of last spring, obviously. That was—” an unforced shudder went through him. “That can’t happen again. But more than that, even, I want you to be happy, day to day. Not wondering when I’m going to wander off. Because the answer is,
After the wave of relief that he hadn’t been “engaged enough,” I felt one of sadness that I hadn’t any family to show Sherlock off to, or to make Sherlock behave for, besides Harry. And their relationship was one of casual dislike, spiking into antipathy whenever Harry remembered his faked death or Sherlock thought of her drinking.
It was far from a physical attraction alone, although God knows there was that, overwhelming every other impression made by anyone else. It was his
John never noticed; it was his turn to be comatose but he fought it. He took Sherlock’s hand and pulled him up close, muttering “Oh, love, oh, fuck, I’ve never... I never even imagined, you are... amazing, brilliant, fantastic,” and Sherlock’s neural circuits lit up with memory, oh
No hurry, here. I pulled back and hollowed my tongue around his shaft, moving up and down slowly until he began to push for more. Caressed his bollocks with tongue and fingers, gently knuckling his perineum, trying to keep him at the edge for as long as I could control my own reactions. Nothing doing: he curled himself away from me and before I could properly protest, reversed direction on the bed so that we could do the same thing to each other.
The journey was dismal, of course. Airports are horrible, airplanes little less so, and passport control when crowded (as was perhaps inevitable for a spring Friday) is like zombie world. Not to mention a companion who was unsmiling and silent and distant.
They’d hit a plateau in this place. John suspected that the tide was on the turn, and the turn was back to London.
This is the halfway mark in terms of chapters, and in case it isn't obvious, I am thrilled with every comment. Comments are a gift and I cherish every one.
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut and shook his head firmly. “No, John. Not that. Never that. No kink-shaming in 221B. Though as kinks go, it’s fairly common. Just not... universal.”
I watched the emotions play over his face at the same lightning speed as his reading. He finished and looked up.
And Sherlock, when we went to leave the registry office and found a small crowd lining the steps outside in the dark and
It seemed clear that there wasn’t going to be any more rest for us that morning. I was still tense; we’d negotiated the minefield, me trying to be frank but careful, John trying to open up about everything he’d kept locked in for years. I felt his distress too acutely to even hint at physical intimacy, but I touched his nape, his arm, his cheek, whenever I could.
Without a word I pulled out my phone, found the message string from over a month ago, and scrolled back to the beginning. Handed it to him.
Even at one remove, therapy gave me a great deal to think about, and much that was reassuring. I don’t have to control the rest of the world’s inhabitants, or ward off prospective bids for John’s attention. I don’t have to monitor his interactions. I just have to trust
“Yes. This is going to sound terrible, and stupid, but it killed me that I wasn’t enough reason for you to stay away from drugs. I know addiction, Sherlock, and I know love isn’t enough; I know drugs aren’t something to do or refrain from doing for the people you love. But it still seemed to me that you could do better, if the stakes were high enough; and if you weren't, it's because they weren't high enough.
Thank you to my betas old and new who helped me groom this very shaggy beast, and who tried to show me what would make it a more sleek and powerful beast—even if I couldn't always go that route. The fic was a bossy beast, and was usually riding me rather than vice versa.
That’s when it hit me. They needed something to fill that empty nest. Not another kid, obviously. We’re pretty triadic that way, now Nana’s gone. But something ... noisy. Affectionate. And fun. Definitely, fun.
The victim’s eyelids fluttered shut, her hand began to relax, no longer grinding his knuckles. Relief gave way immediately to anxiety, mirrored in the expression of the young woman sharing this vigil with him.
“When I’m better.” He keeps his tone equally neutral, and sees John’s relief at that. The Sherlock of old would never admit to being tired, or ill, or hungry. Let alone an addict. He’s working now on making occasional concessions—verbal, if not wholehearted—to his humanity. That may be part of what John thinks he lacks, after all: if not humanity, then the humility to acknowledge it.
list, of everything from films and books to adverts and songs and recipes and travel destinations and God knows what else, and it’s
7PercentSolution gave me marching orders months ago when I was still thinking through the Venetian honeymoon. Only one hotel will do, she said, and it has a
A grating cascade of laughter greeted his tense lament. “Oh, Mister Watson, I’m so sorry, our connection must’ve been terrible.”
He could only half follow the discussion; whenever the playing stopped a clamour of voices erupted. Ash and Patrick spoke as often in Irish as in English; everyone talked over each other; and he’d no idea of the substance of their disagreements anyway, but someone was always calling someone else flat or sharp.
It was clear I wasn’t going to get anything more that night, and in any case, I might not be able to process anything more that night either. I found the driver waiting in the hall, and he took me back to Baker Street barely two miles away as the crow flies.
Circumspect we were not. John had the baby monitor by the bed but Watson was, is, an admirable sleeper, and we never woke her despite some quite audible exertion. Perhaps John knew I needed reassurance; he certainly gave it in spades. The last thing I remember is him heaving and thrusting over me, holding my hands down on either side of my head, gasping, nearly sobbing, my name over and over and then collapsing on me when we both came.
True enough. Indeed, I thought I knew John better than I knew Mycroft, the secretive, posturing drama queen.
John huffed, almost amused, almost impatient. “Obvious: where are we going? Where’re you staying here? I want to get you alone, you know. This is all very well, but I
I put the kettle on and turned to see Sherlock holding a bottle of bourbon: a much better plan. I put ginger, lemon, and honey into the teapot, and poured a shot of the bourbon into each of our mugs. The best of hot tea
I realise that can’t be encouraging, but I’m winded, and not from the climb. He’s not; he leans back into me and says, quite easily, “If you want to.”
“So. Let’s talk tomorrow. Start out by 10 a.m. on the footpath toward Caherdaniel, and after a couple of hours we’ll meet in the middle. You’ll enjoy the walk. At least—” he looked inquiringly under the table at John’s footwear. “Yes, those’ll do. Bring rain gear, just in case.”
He wasn’t listening anymore, he was already in it up the elbows, annoying the Scene of Crimes officers and entertaining John Watson mightily. I had to admit, he could be fun, in his own weird way.
His skin, so smooth under my hands. His nipples, tightening in the cool air and my warm mouth. His cock, bouncing free as I tugged down his pants and
The air was electric. I’d never thought to hear words like this from John. It meant so much more than the borrowed words in songs I’d had to speculate about. I found my thoughts going blurred and loose around the edges. My body felt increasingly heavy and I was sorely tempted to close my eyes, just sink back and—
“He didn’t attend. I phoned to invite him but he shouted abuse at me and hung up without listening.”
“I’ve had occasion to get better.” I sounded a little defensive. It was true that John was immeasurably better with a gun than I was, but my work while ‘dead’ had meant that I’d got quite comfortable, and capable enough, using one.
Every day that passed involved this internal debate. Was he alive or not? Bills never arrived; everything had been diverted to the bank, paid by direct debits according to the utility companies. I no longer paid rent; Mrs Hudson said that the whole amount was transferred every month from the bank account that still remained open. No one at the bank would tell me what was in there, whether money was still being deposited or not. But I took some comfort from the fact that the bank had not closed the account.
I must have looked surprised; he said, kind of defensively, “Well, it’s true. Roberto can shoot if it becomes necessary; we always had to cover for John.”
“Ah. Same.” And here was the crux of it: how the biggest brain and the biggest heart in London had managed to misread each other, year after endless year. John shifted onto his back foot and leaned against me. A simple gesture, but from him so revealing of trust, of confidence.
Christmas at the Holmes’s was better than I expected. Mycroft was unexpectedly absent, and while Margaret was chagrined, it did make for a more relaxed atmosphere. We’d agreed to avoid a gift-giving frenzy, which definitely eased the socio-economic anxiety I still felt now and again.
He wasn’t expecting that one. Probably seemed a bit random. But I wanted, no, needed, to know what his life here had been like for the past month.
Bees. By all means, let’s pick up the pace.” John tugged his arm and turned from admiring the glistening bay.
I thought briefly about contacting that pillock Anderson, and I probably should have done. But he really repulsed me, and I decided he could wait.
For now, though, there was no talking. Sounds, some words, but no sentences, certainly no sequences of thoughts. Sensation, and emotion, and a driving desire that left no room at all for coherence. John reached for Sherlock’s lapels and slid the jacket off his shoulders at the same time as Sherlock pulled John’s belt through the buckle and then opened his trousers. Their movements were too urgent to be anything like seamless, and after a moment of getting in each other’s way, the jacket somehow kicked under the bed and the belt halfway through the loops, each turned to pulling off his own clothing, two shirts disappearing almost simultaneously.
I collected myself and started chewing again, running a thumbnail higher up Sherlock’s thigh and over his flies. I was rewarded with a ragged sigh as he pushed up into my hand.
This case was different. There were people in and out at all hours, not just Watson, John, and Hudders, but Donovan’s junior PC Chantal liaising with Donovan in the incident room at NSY, Mycroft once or twice, Lestrade once, Donovan on video conference twice daily and incessantly via text. There was an incident wall like Donovan’s over at NSY, but for the Will Simpson case. Will’s brother even came to 221B to be interviewed (it was John who remembered to cover up the murder wall before he arrived).
Early Thursday evening he tagged along with Sherlock to Ash’s house. He’d been warned that rehearsals were raucous, scrappy, and long; it figured that the smooth synergy he’d seen at the pub concert took a lot of work to look natural. He settled in on the sofa to watch.
Speaking of plot: my generous, brilliant, and frighteningly fast beta 7PercentSolution has a mind like a steel trap for plotting, and rescued this fic from innumerable plotholes and bloopers. That's not all she's great at, as everyone knows who reads her writing. There's one fic forthcoming that is going to knock our socks right out of their sock index:
Sherlock’s work schedule was no longer so erratic as it used to be, because he put Rosie’s needs first. So I shouldn’t have been surprised when he said, “We’re overlooking the obvious solution. We’ll keep her home. With me, when I’m not on a case.”
The night Sherlock and I slept together on the sitting-room sofa I’d thought—hoped—we were getting somewhere. There was nothing sexual about it, but there was definitely something
Because John had seen Sherlock cry for cases, of course he had. And he was piss-poor at it. He could turn on genuine waterworks, but he was melodramatic and unconvincing, overacting because he didn't truly understand the emotion he was feigning. The poor mugged priest on Irene Adler’s doorstep. The “old friend” of a presumed murder victim in Moriarty’s great game. No matter what he said about John’s ability to dissemble—Sherlock was
I’d forgot, in the past week, that I hadn’t only been missing John. Hudders met me at her door in classic floral dress and fluttery demeanour, and before I knew what I was doing I’d whisked her into a fond hug. She blushed and fussed and hugged, then swatted my arm with disconcerted fondness. It wasn’t long before she'd turned the conversation around to Roberto, and to John. I warned her that she wasn’t going to get much detail out of me, but next to Mrs Hudson I am a rank amateur at interrogation. What I didn’t say, she deduced; what I wouldn’t answer, she confirmed.
Desires. I hadn’t wanted anyone, ever, the way I wanted John, from the day I met him, and all that was spinning in my brain was John, infuriating, tranquil, amused, annoyed, devastated.
It was heaven. But it was also unnerving, how Sherlock shifted from ordinary conversation to full-on and very hot sex, without passing through tentativeness or tenderness. It was uncomfortable to be the one longing for more affection, angling for it. Because words were pressing at me, words I knew I couldn’t afford to say aloud because saying them would not merely confirm their truth but make them true.
This gave me a pretext to look him over with an appraising eye, and I liked what I saw. Playing up the Italian I said, “I hope you have someone to look after you.”
I did try, with Roberto. Once while he was cooking I came up behind him at the stove, wrapped my arms around his waist and lowered my head to his shoulder. Not quite comfortable; leaned my forehead against Roberto’s spine, then. I wanted my arms to feel full, I wanted to feel full. I only felt empty. This wasn’t what I expected. It wasn’t completeness; romantic entanglement hadn't completed me at all. John was wrong.
My life revolved around every second Sunday. My weeks were spent either maniacally parsing what he’d said, or poring over song lyrics I could tangle up with his, saying more clearly what I was only now seeing more clearly, feeling more strongly.
They wouldn't want to live always in such isolation, but in the winter light, when time cracks open, there are always—only—two of them.
Roberto’s eyelids half closed and his lips opened, his hips moving infinitesimally forward as though independent of his will. The erotic charge of this tiny, helpless thrust slammed into Sherlock with a force he’d never felt with anyone but John, but he and John had certainly never done anything like this, his arousal only ever one-sided.
She gives him an eye-roll worthy of the master himself, and when the music stops they applaud with the rest. John thinks she just may be applauding for Sherlock.
“I’ve not heard from him since 30 September. Before that he hadn’t missed a week since 1 April. What am I to make of it?”
“Well, what about it? What are you saying?” —Wrong tack. He stiffens, withdraws, without a change of expression or position, but it’s tangible. “Sorry. I’m listening.”
Yet while the autumn had been colourless it had also been oddly placid, lacking the flaying boredom of old. He’d had so much to think about, to speculate on. To review. It had made the passage of time feel subdued. As though he was waiting for something to happen, but couldn’t do anything to trigger it.
But he hadn’t said that, had he? He’d never made me any promises, at all. On the contrary. He was a master at leaving me behind, he’d done it the very first night at Lauriston Gardens and a hundred times after that.
I can’t think. I can’t remember anything, can’t find any words. His soft breath on my ears, in my hair. His cool fingers moving to my chest now, tracing my pectoral muscles, curling under them, flattening out over my rib cage, holding me to him. I know what he’s doing, now. In some dim corner of my lust-fogged brain I can sense him keeping his own control while robbing me of mine. Why? Why can’t we slide together into this delicious, dizzying chasm together—neither of us observing, neither of us observed? No one granting, no one begging. I would beg, now. I would.
Sherlock manic, Sherlock inert—he’s seen the extremes, but nowadays Sherlock seems careful, in a way John hasn’t known before. Isn’t quite sure about. It’s a bit like seeing a twin pop up out of nowhere. These weeks since the end of the Culverton Smith madness Sherlock has been quiet, companionable, neither sunk in gloom nor jittering in shrieking boredom; but the time they spend together isn’t easy, comfortable, the way it used to be. How could it be? John is watching Sherlock, always watching, for any sign of a relapse; and Sherlock seems to have withdrawn from him, just a bit, nothing he could readily put into words. Resents being monitored, maybe?
When the train car bomb was defused and Lord Moran detained, he finally had time to think. He was sick of himself, sick of his failures and his weaknesses which had cost him so much, had cost John so much—and now had even cost him John.
Conversation on the rest of the walk was desultory, by silent but mutual accord. For his own part there was too much to say, and too little that could actually be said.
on. That you wouldn’t ask for help, but you wouldn’t refuse to give it, either. So I had to be visibly more out of control than you’d ever seen me. —Don’t think I enjoyed it. What I gave up in ratiocination was far more valuable to me than being high.”
Whereas he himself had committed the most egocentric, the most boorish and amateurish, of errors: lost on a drift of bliss he had neglected John,
Her mouth turned down at the corners when I tried to pry the thing loose, her little hand tightened on the empty tube—how had that got within her reach?—but fortunately she hadn’t the strength to break it and cut herself. She had her father’s tenacity, and was no more reasonable about being thwarted than I was; Mycroft was right that she was a visible blend of the two of us.
This is a hermetic universe, which for a few minutes a day has only two inhabitants. They don’t even need names.
Reading John’s last texts Sherlock spins around, his coat fanning out behind him, looks up across sixty feet of vertical space and finally sees him. John’s eyes are wide and intent; his white face in the penumbra of the station is unsmiling but eager. A second of hesitation and Sherlock is racing for the escalator, leaping up the high steps to gain five seconds against the clattering mechanism. As the slotted metal steps flatten out he lunges, bulleting into John’s chest and pulling him in hard until John’s arms lift and circle Sherlock’s waist.
“I want you. I want you in my mouth. Say I can.” When I hear his raw, urgent words I’m suddenly hard as a rock. This is one of my longest-lived fantasies: for John to come into my bedroom while I’m half-asleep,
clean. Now stop talking.” Hardly my most seductive lines, but just the sight of John in that position has me so delirious I can barely get any words out at all.
Well, friends, it’s official: we’re finally retiring, for good, to our house on the Downs. (Sherlock calls it the cottage, but it’s too large to be a cottage. Perhaps I’m just accustomed to the modest dimensions of 221B Baker Street, but the house in Sussex seems
At the utter sappiness of the line John stares, then smiles, leans up to kiss just the corner of Sherlock’s mouth. “You’re not fooling me anymore, you know. You’re a great softy.”
My overriding obsession remained to identify every cluster of Moriarty’s cancerous crime syndicate and to decapitate each one definitively. Either by delegating to the law (a non-starter in lawless countries with corrupt governments), or by depositing the heads in the lap of the British or American secret services, or by taking my own direct action (a euphemism).
The cab picked me up as planned, and I resisted looking back to see whether anyone had been following me, or still was. The driver, who was indeed familiar, pulled away from the curb and drove sedately for the first two or three minutes, then did his best James Bond imitation. We may have driven twenty or twenty-five minutes to end up perhaps eight minutes from the pick-up point. Not at the Diogenes, but at a new apartment block over a purpose-built urban shopping centre near the Russell Square tube station.
If he’d been too restless to sleep before reading the blog, he had full-blown insomnia after. Obviously. He should have waited to have the interview over first; then, even after seeing John smiling and tentative last night, he’d have been braced for the John of their last meeting, enraged and brutal.
A day or so later he slammed his laptop shut hard enough to make me fear for the machine’s working life. Shoved it under his chair and stomped upstairs, I suspect to avoid another question from me.
This was fine, he thought. Roberto’s knee touching his left thigh was good, really. Wrist, thigh. His focus narrowed to these points of contact. Not too much; not too intrusive. Enough for confirmation, consolation. Nothing demanding. Just comfortable contiguity. He could handle it.
We’d been together just over a year before I decided to ask John to marry me. We were bringing up a daughter. We were more than exclusive: we were symbiotic, dyadic. We were permanent. We had a family, however bizarre and hybrid, all equally involved and opinionated in the rearing of Watson. John was working part time as a surgeon, part time with me; he could take off when he wanted to, and we had an embarrassment of choice for where to take Watson when a case required it. She wasn’t a burden, she was a bond: between me and John; between us and her legion of admirers.
There. I’ve said it. Mary wasn’t distraught, and she didn’t fire a “surgical” shot. She wanted him dead and me tied to her forever. Why she wanted it, I don’t know. She didn’t have much respect for me, or much care for my feelings. But she wanted it. She wanted me broken again, clinging to her and to our child as the only certain thing in my life, the only people I truly loved. Mary couldn’t share.
He tilts his head up to kiss me, and I plunge my hands into his hair without a second's remorse for how I'm disheveling it. I'll be doing a lot worse a few minutes from now, and from the pleased hum as I kiss him, he's well on board with that.
I put the puppies to do their business on the little mat, then gave their fuzzy coats a quick brushing. There was only one collar, so instead I put a Christmas bow on each little neck. I’d loaded up the laundry basket with red and green towels, and popped the puppies into it and took it downstairs to the bedroom. I knocked,
“While you were away. The first time, I mean. Will you tell me about it?” His tone was studiously casual, but the strain beneath was audible.
“This past week was a one-off—he’s headed to America for a year and wanted to get the publication sorted before he left.” He was staring at the television, but his attention was clearly on this conversation.
The flight attendant eyed us speculatively, but Roberto’s deliberate hand on my leg made him give it up as a lost cause. Flattering. I never ceased feeling flattered by how visibly attentive he was, as though he was not only unembarrassed at being with me, but actually proud. Again I felt a stirring of arousal that came less from desire than from the unfamiliar sensation of being desired, instead of craving. (Regretting, mourning.) I deliberately pursued that arousal. It was what I was there for, after all.
He didn’t delete it but he cauterised it, sealed it off and ignored it with a degree of success that increased with practice.
to closing down a nerve centre of the human trafficking network exploiting Italy’s porous, five-thousand mile coastline. So my guard was up and my tolerance was down when I finally met the loose cannon in person.
His mouth quirked a bit and he almost smiled. “Not angry, not now. Not for months. Once I knew for sure you were alive, I figured you had a hell of a good reason for putting me through this. And then at the end of October, Mycroft told me what the reason was. So I really couldn’t be angry about
Check the atmosphere: uncertain, at first. They're alone, but not really. Sherlock watches the passing lights strobe across the cab’s interior, across John’s face; he's looking away, out the window, his hands clasped loosely in his lap. But it's okay because they are alone, but not really. No more than John does Sherlock want their first real kiss to be in a taxicab, with a presiding spirit staring at them in the rear-view mirror, possibly disapproving.
I don’t smile. I close my eyes and lean close to him, to breathe him in. If it’s the last time, or if he makes me sleep alone all night, at least I’ll have that to think of instead of that hideous abyss at my feet and no John.
It got so obvious that Helena, the office manager, asked me into her glassed-in office, sat me down, and said tactfully, “You’d tell me, wouldn’t you, if anything or anyone here were making you ... uncomfortable. We do like to keep everyone on board and
Whenever Zanardi wasn’t actively working on the trafficking case he shadowed Sherlock, praised him, touched his arm or his shoulder. And Sherlock let him. I never thought Sherlock could find a partner as compatible as John was. But Zanardi treated Sherlock like any other person—a genius, but not a freak—and Sherlock responded by acting like any other person. Well, more like, anyway.
That he’d left me here to grieve instead of telling me: that too was a bitter pill. I’d thought I meant more to him than that.
His gravelly voice breaks into this happiest of loves to assure me that there’s no such thing as a happy love, that happy love does not exist. The absurdity of it makes me laugh into John’s mouth, a ridiculous sound that breaks our kiss and leaves John looking tender but quizzical.
In the weeks before Christmas John stopped by Baker Street once or twice with Watson, and on Christmas Eve Sherlock was invited over to John’s flat along with several other people. He decided to go to his parents in the country instead. He’d already given John and Watson his gifts, to be opened on Christmas morning, and he doubted that watching one of John’s female neighbors flirt with him over eggnog and baby toys would contribute significantly to his happiness. When he’d finally declined, John had seemed disappointed but hadn’t pressed, which in turn had disappointed Sherlock.
Of course there’s a real Christmas waltz--composed and played by John McCutcheon. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0AeCdEbZhE
But nothing prepared me for how I felt on the anniversary of the day Sherlock left London for Rome, leaving me a letter that shredded me completely.
Again, he did anything but. He was attentive and generous. He made sure I had whatever he thought would make me happy, whether meals (regular, delicious) or stimulation (in bed, out of bed), or gratification. He translated; facilitated; took care of everything, and never let me feel dull or stupid because of my complete lack of Italian. He looked pleased when I tried out simple phrases in public. He held my hand, touched my arm or back, and after he’d made sure I was comfortable with that, he kissed me. Who’d taken my Sherlock—who could be so insensitive and imperious—and left this fond, attentive model in his place?
Sherlock’s voice is dry, but he is more uncomfortable with this conversation than he’s willing to show. Defending his treatment of her son by vaunting his own prowess in bed is not, by any stretch, what his own mother would regard as edifying.
She kept chattering as she settled him into a kitchen chair and put the kettle on. He put on a conspiratorial grin and went straight to the point.
Nice. Can’t be arsed to find out why I’d been hauled out of my real job, out of the blue, to be ignored and humiliated at Molly’s morgue. I’d suspect Molly, she’d looked awfully uncomfortable and slid out of the room as soon as she could; but she isn’t cruel. —Is she?
. It’s too—I won’t—I can’t last if you do that. I mean, don’t ever stop, but be still just for a moment.”
Oh. He’s been ignoring conversational cues again. He always has, that’s nothing new. What’s new is that now he has to parse his own behaviours, his words, if he’s ever to figure out where he’s incomplete, and remedy it.
As soon as the words left my mouth I heard how stupid they sounded. If she and Sherlock had been plotting a birthday surprise, how else would a small child react but with theatrical secrecy and isolation? Had I been imagining some ridiculous “bad seed” scenario?
He was taking off his socks with a kind of sheepish smile and looking down at my legs, seemingly uncertain. Below the waist I was still completely clothed, and went into the bathroom to take care of that in short order. When I came back out he was holding a box of condoms. I was a little surprised, but didn’t say anything.
, rice and peas. I wanted to have another go at an impressive meal, since we had the time and he seemed to be napping on the sofa, though his hands looked oddly prayerful. When I’d set the preparation to rest before serving I turned around and saw that Sherlock seemed now to have other plans.
John wandering through narrow streets along shimmering canals, his face illuminated with delight at the legendarily dazzling architecture. Even in Italy, justly famed for its attention to beauty, few other cities seem so wholly to privilege grace and gratuitous elegance and harmony of line and colour. The absence of automobiles is the icing on an already exquisite cake.
“Git.” John’s tone was light but his face was deadly serious. “He. Moriarty. Moran. Morstan. Whoever takes it into his or her head to eliminate you. You, Sherlock Holmes, are going to have to learn to change your way.
The venue had a younger look, but still warm and welcoming: flashier colours, but white fairy lights. There was a wider range of music, but still plenty of chances for the uncertain to enjoy dancing. The advance signup online got more people involved, gave them time to prepare, and made the bidding more competitive. People could still bid at the Gala, which looked like raising
I thought it was my prerogative to decide? Somehow this was far more delicate a topic, far more gross an oversight, than Sherlock’s equable tone made it sound.
I hated to doubt Sherlock, but I knew very well that being an addict or not isn’t a matter of rational choice or morality or character or willpower. He could relapse without wanting to, and as brilliant as he is, he could keep me from finding out almost indefinitely. The downside of loving a genius: my only recourse is either low cunning, or distance. If Rosie came to need Sherlock the way I’d always done—like a drug—how would I protect her if he let her down, if I had to separate them? She’d suffer without understanding. I couldn’t risk it.
“For you. A surprise for your birthday. Two songs: one on the piano, with me; and one she’s going to sing for you. A simple Bach minuet, and a children’s song in French.”
And he leaned close and kissed me (oh the taste of him, so sweet), nudging my face up to meet his eyes.
After that conversation I thought about little else, ricocheting between stupor, and fury, and aching, raging love. My moods were so volatile I was hard put to it to keep up my hangdog demeanour at work.
2. I owe 7PercentSolution a serious debt of gratitude (on the order of an organ or a firstborn child) for volunteering to beta & brit-pick, and for deftly suturing up more than one plot hole wide and deep. 🌞 🐝 ❤️
John’s face was a study in disbelief. I wanted to laugh, and I wanted to cry. Was it that rare that I admitted when I was wrong? But I was so thrilled that John might be able to return to surgery that I hurried into another misstep: “And I can watch you operate.”
There isn’t much John can’t reconcile me to, if he sets his mind to it. I already eat and sleep with metronomic regularity, and I no longer leave organic tissue in our refrigerator unless I mean to cook it. I am even civil to Mycroft in front of Watson.
“I’m off too, then,” said Donovan. “Holmes, I’ll text you when I have more information about tyres, make of vehicle, all that. We'll issue a call for witnesses to the public and a bulletin to vehicle repair shops, and start database searches for the star tattoo.”
When John writes about my return for his blog—the part of it that can be revealed, not the “I executed another man for Sherlock” part—he’ll make a thrilling drama out of the three-sided argument with Mycroft. The only reason there wasn’t actual shouting is that we couldn’t afford to draw any more attention to the flat than Mycroft already had, coming in.
“He’s just gone into the shower. I’m sure he’ll be right out.” I wanted to exaggerate the apparent intimacy of Sherlock leaving me on my own while he showered.
It’s probably a bad husband who inserts a work obsession into a honeymoon plan, but the opportunity was as irresistible as it was unplanned.
There was only one thing to do, though I’d resisted it for months, and I did it now as soon as the 28 October radio programme ended without word from Sherlock. I took the precaution of buying a pay-as-you-go burner phone, just in case whoever was following me was also monitoring my calls.
John is (mentally) a bit of a shit on the subject of Sherlock's first partner. He gives himself a check, but he's got some work to do, drat him
He waited for the coughs and chair scrapes and jars-on-the-bar to settle down, then touched his bow to high F and cascaded lightly down as though the fiddle were a thrush singing, a nightingale. An octave down, Ash joined him and started the mournful “Ned of the Hill” first in Gaelic, then shifting into English.
The rather slow lift finally lurched to the top floor and we set some kind of record to our own door. Once through it, though, time slowed down again. We hadn’t dressed for going out, so undressing him went rather quickly, the buttons on his white shirt slipping open as I ran my fingers over the skin beneath them, caressing his nipples and bending my head to take first one, then the other, between my lips and tonguing them, already hard, into perfect warm pearls, the hitch in his breathing telling me he loved it.
But he didn’t say yes. Craving to bury myself to the hilt inside him, I nonetheless held back, concentrating on his pleasure, hoping that at this rate it wouldn’t be long before we could breach that last barrier. Then I’d be able to dip, then press, then plunge into Sherlock. The thought was dizzying enough to make me come, as I shouted the house down and we both ruined two perfectly good sets of clothes.
A long time ago I made a sampler afghan. Every square was different; only the two colors, of squares and border, were the same, conferring what unity the thing could claim. This fic is like that, darting from POV to POV, voice to voice, tense to tense. Thanks all the more for persevering, if it was as disruptive a narrating choice as I think it was.
For my part, if I’d had him with me, I’d have been much better off in every respect but the most important one: he’d have made me vulnerable. At any serious threat to John I’d have backed down before any adversary, in any circumstance. Moriarty had known that, and used it accordingly; I had to suspect that some among his surviving minions knew it too.
allowed John into my conscious mind. Since leaving London, I’d held hard to my promise to give my full attention to Roberto. This had taken far more effort than I’d expected; for so long John had occupied so much of my time, concentration, and emotions, that the moratorium had required a nearly constant effort of will. The only place I found it easy
John recovered first. “For God’s sake, you have an editor out of a Wodehouse novel! Does this Augustus Fink-Nottle have a title, too?”
We were planning on Morstan being ready to come as soon as John invited her, that very evening. I had nothing to do but wait until she would come to the flat to meet John—and find me, instead.
There was still anger there, and hurt, even knowing Sherlock was alive and well. It was what it was, and he had to do better now than he had in the shock of Sherlock's poorly-executed return.
She gave a brisk nod as though to end the conversation, and stood to shoulder her bag. John turned back to me as she left.
They seem to move automatically in sync, John competent if not effortless, coordinated if not smooth, and Sherlock’s overcome with tenderness at kind, caring John stepping outside of his comfort zone like this. He bends down and discreetly breathes in John’s hair, his slight sweat from the slight exertion of their slow, swaying dance. This alone could almost, almost, be enough. John’s proximity, his pleasure in this, his excitement at getting out into the countryside for a case—combined with his simply beautiful face and form, his allegiance to Sherlock, established at last. If this evening gives him nothing more than this moment and this music, this mood and this man, it will already have been a success.
He ordered another drink for his companion and himself. The conversation meandered through film and fiction without particular direction or intensity, until the woman asked, “Are you here on business?”
“About the scars: after you were shot, and I saw them. About your time away: much earlier. After the bonfire night. Something about that whole night didn’t make sense to me. When I came to, the way you were looking at me, holding my face in your hands. I almost knew, then. ‘Fire exposes our priorities.’ You, just back after so long. The kidnapping. Mary shrieking. The skip code. It was all too... weird not to be part of some Mycroft web or other.” John’s hands were motionless on my lower back until he returned to caressing my skin gently, raising gooseflesh.
, and how to write for them. Simply.” John was amused, not impatient, but evidently Sherlock thought he was being mocked, since he shut down for the rest of the day.
Instead he sounded impressed. Awed, even. After all these years John still seemed to see my oddities as
But he’s sorry, too, of course he is. Hours and days go by without John, and when he does come, their interaction is mediated by Watson’s presence. Perhaps his desire to have John to himself is selfish, or childish. —But isn’t “romantic entanglement” all about dyadism? Two people apart from the rest of the world? He sighs. He can’t apply logic to emotion, to metaphor. It’s always seemed an excellent reason to avoid both.
exhausting, and I decided it was time for a thorough mind-emptying distraction. We were already well in sync in lovemaking, and in no time at all we were thinking of nothing but each other, the immediacy of it.
Shit. Sherlock doesn’t usually bother to equivocate with me, and if he does, he tries to make it believable. This was more “none of your business.” But he’d bothered to make sure I was fed, and given me an ETA so I shouldn’t worry, so there was that.
), highlighted with colours and patterns so lush they were almost synaesthetic. The black velvet coverlet embroidered with red, green-gold, and silver threads was made for a pirate’s lair; doubtless John was remembering my youthful career ambitions. The damascene walls were the rich man’s version of our iris wallpaper in 221B. But more than the gilt lampstands or the ruched sheer gold curtains or the Louis Quatorze chairs, the room’s crowning glory was the black glass chandelier in the center of the ceiling.
“Upstairs room: clear it all out. Pale yellow walls, not lemon, not chrome. Sprinkler system, smoke alarm, carbon monoxide detector. Move in an excellent single bed and nightstand.” (
That was remarkably insightful of him, but then, he is a clever man. I wasn’t quite ready to be as pragmatic as he was, though. There were still things I had to know. “So no asking about lovemaking between you, then. How about this: When you were
“No, that’s not what I meant. It was my fault, all of it. The whole time, your safety had been my one concern, I just didn’t realise how I’d threatened it
Mycroft, for once, they were playing pirates. We made them come in for lunch, and you can see how he felt about having to leave his pirating.”
Never the same person twice. Who besides Sherlock had an anonymous army to deploy? Who would bother following me unless it had to do with him? He might actually be behind it, but I had no way to ask. I’d have to get word to him in my next song line. If he was behind it, he wouldn’t be alarmed. And if he wasn’t, he could avoid walking into a trap.
I didn’t know what to make of that, but I let it go. Sherlock's tone suggested that his brother wasn't his favourite topic.
He’d always been able to take his distance from people who fell for him based on his appearance. Beauty is an irrelevant criterion, either too conventional or too subjective to be meaningful. Certainly too superficial. And Roberto wasn’t immediately magnetic in his own right, either; even trying to be open to new prospects, Sherlock hadn’t been able to work up real desire. But Roberto was tenacious. Discreet, but persistent. And unguarded. It was ... disarming, somehow. Winning.
, at the end. She got to hear your voice. She was badly hurt, but she heard you speak when your safety was
Now that it's clear we're in Ireland, it's time to say: this fic is born of Anyawen's plot bunny made into a love song to Chryse's 2016 fic
John is elated: watching and waiting, admiring and desiring. His breathing and heart rate haven’t calmed yet, though he’s been sitting for a few minutes now. Deep breath: hold: release, slowly. Repeat three times. The song draws to a close, the scarlet dress swings around and settles in a liquid fall, and Sherlock escorts her back to her table with an attentive gallantry that John knows to be wholly insincere.
I jeered and patronised her, told her it might well be she who ended up dead; I kept trying to make her lose her temper, but she’d regained her calm. That composure confirmed that Moran must indeed be somewhere in the vicinity.
Sherlock, whom Ash announced as Will Scott, was eerily unlighted, his fiddle line emerging from the dim back of the stage. For song after song he stayed in the shadows, only emerging for solos, even then mostly looking away from the audience. John could see the moment Ash saw Ciaran, and Christy, and Maire walk in at the back of the hall. She turned to Sherlock and inserted a song that wasn’t on the set list.
“I wasn’t asleep.” John clicks the kettle on and clatters the tea-things, rooting through the kitchen drawer for the hot water bottle. I haven’t looked for the idiotic thing since I left. I’ve no idea where the wretched thing is.
I wondered whether my increasing emotional intensity was due to the fact that love songs were the default means of communication between us. But it was more likely the reverse: I was choosing love songs to speak to him because that was the way I thought of him. And I wondered whether it was the same with him.
He interrupted, trying for his calmest register. “I’m not Erica, I’m with her, though. There’s been a street accident, and I’m, we’re, waiting with her for help.”
When we’d finished eating—I’d eaten less than usual—I took a book to the plush velveteen sofa in the sitting room and pretended to read. Roberto, realising that I was abstracted, went off to take a shower and pottered about with his laptop until midnight, when he announced he was for bed, and looked at me with a query.
“It’s water under the bridge now,” he says, coolly again, as though the conversation were over, and inconsequential in any case. And when he takes me into his arms, lowers himself onto me, covers my mouth with his, brings every sense alive with his fingers—well, it
This one creature was doing a lot, on that ride. The blend of boredom and tension that usually marks tube passengers lifted and people met each other's gaze with a smile for the dog's easy bonhomie. And by putting all his faith in his one person, the dog gave his owner a sense of strength, confidence.
And oh yes, of course: I do love feedback, in whatever form you choose to leave it. Comments are chocolate. On Tumblr I'm totallysilvergirl, btw. Again, ❤️🙏
“It’s important,” I said, firmly. Never overexplain, not with Holmes. “By the way, you should shift your weight to your back foot just there.”
Sherlock didn’t take the humour bait, saying instead, “Solitary. Hyper-intellectual. Obsessive. Socially awkward.”
Once the three of them were alone, Mycroft said, “There’s one more thing. If Sergeant Donovan does well on this case there’s a promotion in it for her. Gregory— Lestrade — has been urging his superiors in that direction for some time.”
His voice is sleepy and soft-edged. No sign of Captain Watson at all, just my blond-to-grey sleepy John, my—I have no words for this. “Penny?”
This was a lot, and I wanted to give Sherlock a chance to say something. He didn’t look put off, just uncertain. So I went on.
Sherlock was the best part of every night and every day, and I wanted him with a constant ache I hadn’t felt in twenty years. Discovering sex with him was like discovering it again for the first time: I was what I can only call obsessed. When we weren’t together I was counting the hours until we were; when we
—to be angry at her. But beneath it all, I was. She came into our marriage with secrets she never gave me the choice to accept or reject. She brought me back to life after you died, but Sherlock, you can’t build a marriage on secrets and lies. And we had a child, and Mary endangered Rosie, and left her to go do more killing, more damage control. Just like you. Working alone and taking all the risks alone, shutting me out like some kind of useless appendage. A clumsy junior partner.”
“This footpath’ll be easy to find, I assume?” John tried for casual, tried not to reveal that he’d walk barefoot over nettles and thistles and gorse if need be, to meet Sherlock “in the middle.”
We’d learned to make the very most of Rosie’s hour-long nap each day, usually managing to work in a shower before collecting her from her cot. (One day she’ll find out from other kids that parents don’t usually shower in the middle of each day.) It had got so I had a Pavlovian response to the sound of Sherlock closing her nursery door. The time constraint focused our attention wonderfully, and made for some of our most memorable, well, episodes.
It’s glorious, it’s over ridiculously fast, he should've tried to slow down but he’s been craving it for so long, they both have; they don’t last a minute before they are coming at almost the same time, with cries just as synchronised. John collapses on top of him but doesn’t stop kissing, his throat, his collarbones. Sherlock has the most absurd fear that John will taste tears.
John truly had buried the past, then. I knew there’d been a handful of times he’d been in a rage about Roberto, a futile retroactive rage for which he had no outlet. He told me he’d gone into those episodes in depth with Ella, in a way I found quite unnecessarily masochistic. But she seemed to have helped him to a serenity about the whole existence of my month with Roberto that I hadn’t realised he’d reached.
Every day he learned from John, yet here he was still resenting Mycroft, and for that matter, his parents. He should give this forgiveness lark a go.
He rang off and stared in the mirror over the fireplace. His hair, his eyes, his posture, his clothing—after knowing Will Scott all these years, Ash was about to meet Sherlock Holmes. Or some awkward hybrid of the two.
better. Two snarks in a row. I went down to find a giant bin bag for his bloodstained clothes, thinking that this is what murderers must have to do after dismembering someone. In surgery we get to just throw it all away; these, we’d have to leave with Sherlock’s bombproof and ever-patient dry-cleaner.
Walking, and talking. Silence, and sleep. There was something about Sherlock’s mere proximity—there always had been. A magnetic tug that gathered everything around him into orbiting satellites, John among the rest. He’d always thought it was surface allure: cosmetic features like verbal virtuosity and intensity and speed, charisma and sheer physical beauty, class and accent and clothing. The sum of these things had always dominated John’s reactions to Sherlock’s appeal.
“God, no. It’s dull. Banal. Motive’s always the same. Modality’s always the same. Roberto works on those kinds of cases. —Not art thefts; that’s a special unit of the Carabinieri, another branch of service. Anyway, Mafia crimes aren’t just dull, they’re squalid. The worst of human behaviour: primacy through violence and intimidation, and a conspiracy of silence to cover it all up. Simplistic and horrible.”
