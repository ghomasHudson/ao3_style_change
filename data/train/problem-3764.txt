Castiel doesn’t know how to respond. He moves his hand lower, to a scar that crosses over Dean’s spine, and Dean straightens his back out under the touch.
He can’t get anything right. He can’t protect his brother when he’s supposed to. He wasn’t strong enough or brave enough—or idealistic enough—when he needed to be. He is too easily intimidated, too jealous and scared—Dean is weak and he is a disappointment and simply
more, but it’s pretty hard to keep track at this point. The lamp lit on the bedside table next to him paints half his features gold, casting long, gorgeous shadows like the silhouettes of trees in summer sunsets across the rest of his face. A frown, deep in thought, carves between his brows and it’s weird how relaxed and alert, absorbed and aware the guy looks right now. Dean’s lungs feel tight.
He starts sleeping in the same bed as Castiel, again, inviting himself over under the guise of homework, and staying until late, very late, then saying there’s no point going home, now: it’s too dark. Castiel doesn’t point out that Dean’s ‘home’ is a matter of yards away from Castiel’s front door. Dean even starts reaching out for Castiel in the night. Only innocently. Only hands tangled. Only jovial, light kicking. Only fingers grazing Castiel’s elbow or back. Dean is tactile and always has been. But it comes in waves and crests, with Castiel: Dean will crest, all affection and touch and needing to be touched, and then fall, plummet in slow motion, withdraw and scowl at Castiel’s attempts to reach out, physically, and engage with his best friend.
Ellen titters and leaves to fetch more food. Dean frowns over at the shepherd, who shoots him a quizzical expression.
“Yes, yours. You got a grudge on me, or somethin’? Why do you want me to fuck things up with my best friend?”
“You’ve always been the one to pick up the pieces, Dean,” He says, quietly. “Seriously. Like, where’s mom right now?” Dean flushes and cannot answer. “Exactly. She bails every time the going gets tough. You never have.” He looks up at Dean, whose eyes are prickling. “Seriously. I’m so grateful.”
What a strange thing it is to say goodbye to a building. A house becomes a home when its inhabitants are bled into its walls; it doesn’t matter how in want it is of repair, how faded the paint of the door may be, the cracks on the tiles of the bathroom; people are like water or air: they take the shape of their vessel, going so far as to fill it. To leave is to be ripped away. And as it is, Castiel’s home has been beautiful and functional, somehow balancing the privilege of spotlessness with warmth and sincerity. A
“That sounds—” Dean’s head is spinning so hard and so fast he can barely get the thought out, “that sounds—good—I like that—”
“Heya, Charlie,” Dean accepts the hug she pulls him in for without too much fuss, rolling his eyes as he does so. “You doin’ okay?”
The problem is, when Castiel spoke to Dean when his eyes had fluttered closed, it felt like honey was dripping through his system and spreading all over his frame with a kind of sweet-fullness that had Dean believing the universe was something fragile with beauty, despite all the pain and sadness within it.
“Cas was—Cas needed a bath—” Dean stammers as Sam turns toward the door. “So he—he had one after me.”
Jody seems to agree with his idea, anyway, and they carry Bobby over to one of the pale blue chaises in the room as Dean’s hands grow clammy and cold. At least he can feel them now. Bobby has stopped twitching by the time Ellen brings in a hot drink for Dean and a stiff one for Bobby. But Bobby can’t seem to drink it.
one another, because when Dean wakes up in the morning and opens his curtains he can see Cas doing the same, in the house opposite his house, in the room opposite his room. Because here, they wave and smile to one another, Dean sometimes sticking a picture of a dick up on his window and earning a punch from the other boy when he next sees him; because they walk side-by-side everywhere they go, shoulders brushing, no need for conversation. But if they want it, they can talk for hours, and
“Are you okay?” He asks, and there’s a clatter, and the sound of someone cursing, and Castiel opens the door slowly, peering through it warily.
“God, Cas!” Dean shouts, shoving at Castiel again, who stops, hands shaking, beautiful blue eyes stitched to Dean’s face. “It’s wrong,” Dean shakes his head, “you’re
the sea, and seeing a storm raging above its surface, lighting flashing across the waters above your head. The same pink lips, pursed, indignant. A heavier brow, somehow both furrowed and slanting, as though at once troubled and perplexed. Same head inclination, ten degrees, then twenty, then thirty to the side as he regards Dean with what Dean is certain Castiel intends to be a neutral expression. Same messy dark hair, ruffled just so, so that Dean’s fingers itch with the temptation to reach out just a little and run themselves delicately through jet-coloured tufts.
of that before. Different kinds of dragons? The idea of it is exciting, makes Dean’s mind wander to notions of dragons the size of mountains and dragons the size of dogs that could sleep on the couch and be used as a hot water bottle on cold winter nights, the fires in their blood warming cold skin and dulling shivers.
“Just try to be good today, okay? Please?” The King asks, his voice a quiet mumble uttered in Dean’s direction from the corner of his mouth.
“I’ve missed you,” the middle child of Jimmy Novak beams, expression swept up in affection and only slightly mocking nostalgia. “But seriously,” this expression falls, and is surpassed by one far more sombre, moving as waves move over sand, one overcome quickly and smoothly by another. “How are you?”
“Then why can’t you be as kind to yourself as you are to them?” Castiel asks. Dean swallows and doesn’t answer, face red. “Or at least half as kind, one quarter? Dean, you really are so deserving of kindness. Is it so difficult to believe?”
“I don’t know, Mr Winchester,” the girl, Krissy, frowns. “You’re asking us a pretty enormous question, there.”
The music they had been listening to when they arrived starts up, and Dean reddens in the light flooding onto the lawn from Lisa’s house.
“Because my dad just died,” Castiel and rubs his arms in the freezing cold of the rain. “And I’m not going outside—save for now,” he gestures, “And a couple of other times.”
“It’s very beautiful,” Castiel agrees when Dean expresses this. “And even though it’s a hub for a faith I don’t subscribe to, it absolutely feels sacred. Plus, they have a bit of a legacy of being inclusive, in King’s Chapel, which is nice. Apparently now they host loads of interfaith events. Also, Evensong is beautiful. I think you’re gonna love it.”
He scrubs his face with his hands and lets out a devastated, quaking sigh. He misses Cas. Cas is right across the street, and he misses him like the moon must miss the sun, part of him destroyed, missing, invisible.
Dean has to keep avoiding Cas’s gaze all through lunch. Something heavy has settled in the air between them, some wordless intensity to parallel the shepherd’s gaze. It doesn’t matter: Adam has plenty to say and rambles excitedly about the snow fort he and Dean built, while Dean nods encouragingly or offers a word of agreement when Adam stops to breathe or chew his food. Cas watches him during these moments with a muted smile.
“Dean—” Castiel tries, but Dean holds up his hand, motioning for Castiel to be quiet; a simple, cold gesture that rips into the Angel’s heart.
“It doesn’t feel that way,” Dean shakes his head, concerned. “More than all you earn in at least a fortnight—where did you get it?”
How could he ever be? Not for the first time, and he suspects, or perhaps he hopes, not for the last, he is overwhelmed by the sympathy and acute, perceptive thoughtfulness of the man who has chosen to sit with all Dean’s anger and resentment for
“I’m not your landlord,” Dean laughs honestly, “and in any case, you can’t be left to shiver through the autumn and winter, in your own home.”
“But how do we do that? We help her with her homework, I teach her to cook, you watch reality TV with her, we get her a fucking
“Yes—” Dean stammers, “yes—you too—you—” he fumbles to stand as the shepherd does. “I’ll see you tomorrow?”
His daddy is trying to make it feel as much like home as possible for Castiel; but he doesn’t like it, and doesn’t like the change, and doesn’t like the thought of finding new friends here when he already found it hard enough back home; back in his
And, he sighs to himself, Jack knew exactly what he was doing when he said he was going back to earth.
“Me?” Castiel repeats, frowning and more than a little upset at getting blamed for he-isn’t-quite-sure-what. Honestly. Was Dean
There’s Ellen, who in the midst of a busy shift and breaking up another fight between two drunks will catch the sorry look in Dean’s eye and take him aside, putting up with all of his lies and pretences of being okay, will invite him round for dinner and give him warm hugs punctuated by the smell of the perfume her husband always used to buy for her and that she wears, still.
The sky is turning grey. Maybe that’s just Dean’s vision. Everything hurts so much that white daggers have come striking up across his eyes and nothing is clear anymore. The daggers burn his gaze as though they have been heated by the most terrible of furnaces.
“You still avoid eye contact when you feel things are getting too personal,” Castiel states with a laugh. Dean chuckles.
Charlie takes Dean’s hand and slips his cell back into it. She doesn’t answer, but nods in confirmation.
Dean doubts he will ever get over the warm curl of the man’s accent. All his syllables close gently into themselves. It’s like music.
like the father it mourns, is in its own way so much more than the sum of its parts. It is a meditation, it is a manifesto, it is an essay, it is a Hymn—(the title, not-so coincidentally, of the third poem in the collection). The poetry’s form constructs the dead father it grieves for as much as the content does. It is a rare and bright and horrible thing.
“Never,” Dean shakes his head. His voice is barely raised above the lick and crackle of the flames in the fireplace. “Never.”
“Your father’s in prison,” Dean shoots back, words clipped. “He’s going to be for a long, long time. He’s lost his parental rights to you. I don’t think his opinions are the ones you should respect.”
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel smiles. Dean blinks hard, before grinning and stammering out something that even
Humans don’t have this ability to connect so intimately with each other—if intimate is the right word. Truthfully, the touch of one Angel’s mind on another’s is nothing more than cordial and bitingly formal; however personal the
So starts the most painful song Castiel has ever heard. The kind of pain that grips at the base of the heart and pulls, pulls, pulls with every string played and note sang. The kind of pain that aches and grows and stifles breath, constricting the throat, tying itself around the neck.
“I’m afraid not,” he shakes his head. “You need your sleep, and I need to pack. But maybe another night?”
“If he really cared about you, he’d want you to go, he’d want you to be happy!” Dean exclaims. “I know
Dean is like the unfurling of the fractal patterns of a fern. For days, he says nothing to Sam, Eileen, or Jack, about their relationship—whatever it is—and honestly, Castiel grows less clear every day. He loves more, is able to touch more, but it seems as though he can speak it into being, less.
“Now, shut up.” He feels too sad to stop this coming out rather harshly. “She was—her name was Cassie.”
way? What thoughts could mend this, make it better?” Dean asks, exasperated. “Nothing will fix what I have broken.”
“You’re doing just fine,” Dean says. “Try using one foot, not two, and just relax, take it smooth—don’t overthink it. Here we go,” he says, as Jack breathes in deep and starts up again.
“Your Majesty,” he tried, which nearly made her cry. He flickered his gaze, frustrated, to the medicine she was refusing to drink.
“It’s not! And even if it were, when Dean is killed, he will be transformed by the mark into a weapon worse—”
He orders a coffee for Ellen, a camomile for himself, and a hot chocolate for Dean—in case he comes around. The sugar will probably do him good, if this is the case, after everything, it’s unlikely he has anything left in his system, and Castiel is hardly surprised the oldest Winchester is crashing quite so hard that he’s able to fall asleep on the floor.
“Like a nest,” Dean says, “high up,” and thinks of the hills set about the place. Well, it makes sense. He turns back to Bobby. “I thought they were saying
“I don’t wanna go in,” Castiel decides, pulling his daddy back, still holding onto his coat. “Can we go home? Please?”
“You ‘t don’t know what I saw, when I saw your soul. You know nothing of what I saw, every time I looked at it.”
to read a story, at which the writer hesitates, looking equal parts thoughtful and troubled, then leaves the room. He returns a couple of moments later with a notebook in his hand. Why’s he changed his mind on reading these to Mara?
Jo goes through weird periods of being nonverbal, though. It’s hard to get her to talk about emotional crap at the best of times, and this is probably the most emotionally turbulent thing that can happen to a person. Ellen’s due to start treatment at the end of January, when Dean is gonna be back from a
“Ah, and you speak the language of my mother and father well,” Castiel says, and Dean beams at the broadened pupils and flashing irises Dean speaking Irish sets into Cas’s gaze. “But those are a fair few names.”
Castiel tries to speak when they make it out into Lisa’s front yard. His voice is heavy with drunken gravity and this inexplicable sorrow that has overcome his person in the past ten minutes.
“And where was the open window?” Dean asks, before the last of them has a chance to enter his father’s chambers. The sentry points further down the corridor, and Dean sees it. The air is even colder down this end of the passageway.
I am SO SORRY this took so long. I've been having a major shitstorm at uni and my mum just moved home which sucked & was sad so I had to head down to London to help her out. Anyway. Cambridge is fun but kinda balancing fun with being, like, fucking chaotic. I'm in a play though! And auditioned for another today but it went kinda shit. Anyway, I thought I'd just update you all on how it's going.
At dinner, Dean’s foot is touching Castiel’s under the table. Neither of them mention it. Neither of them move.
They stay a few more hours; the kingfisher diving once more and Dean catching a few fish of his own. That evening, they cook and eat the fish, before turning to sit on the cliffs, at the rocks Dean cut his hand on that night Castiel invited him into the croft and touched him with more determined and exasperated kindness than Dean could remember being gifted.
“I hope he’d be kicking himself because he could see the gravity of the damage he’s caused,” Castiel replies seriously. “I hope he’d be kicking himself over the hurt, not over the wasted resources.”
“—And if you stay,” Samandriel speaks over Castiel, holding his head high and meeting Castiel’s gaze with a new kind of fierceness, “then everything will be fine. We can stay together. No breaking up. We can see where this goes, and I really
“Twelve years I loved you,” Castiel reminds, “and lived for millennia before that. You and I have very different ideas of what taking your time means.”
The breakfast is like a warm weight in Dean’s stomach. Ellen heats milk and pours it into cups for the boys; the bread is still warm when she slices into it, the bacon salty enough to stop Dean from dipping into lightheadedness, which he has been headed toward since about midnight last night. For some time the only sound from the boys is eating—Adam in particular, messy and ravenous with pre-teen appetite. Jo eats and complains about someone—Mick—whom Dean hasn’t yet met, while Bobby chuckles and tells her to look up the word longsuffering, when she has a spare moment.
“Digging around in your hand with a sharp pair of tweezers,” Novak answers frankly. “Or let the slate sit, and stay, and rub and cut and grate at your poor tender nerves from inside of you until your last breath.”
Dean is collecting herbs in the courtyard for Ellen when Mick dashes out of the kitchen door and ducks beneath the window. Dean frowns and approaches him, and as Mick hears his footfalls, practically jumps out of his skin.
Calev’s entry to the war was unexpected, as unexpected as his and his people’s appearance outside of myth and into reality; Dean returned to a kingdom to find that another had somehow swum into existence, miles west of Hera. And its entrance into the Demon war is not unconditional: Calev is power hungry, Calev is land hungry, Calev is glory hungry. After centuries of silence and anonymity from the kingdom across the sea, he seems determined not only to map it, but expand it, not only have its name spoken, but sung.
“And it’s hard not to behave with immaturity when you’re treated as immature!” Castiel glares. “Stop being invasive! Stop poking your nose in my business!”
“Cas,” Dean takes a step closer again, and his hands twitch once more as though he thinks to reach out and touch. “You’re… You’re… this is really you?”
“He was almost a captain,” Ellen shakes her head. “He climbed up the ranks remarkably fast for a maidservant’s husband.” She laughs a moment. “Sir Robert was in a similar position to my husband—after that night of the attack on Hera; because of his services to the Kingdom, he was knighted and went on to become John’s most trusted advisor. But before that, he and my husband were close friends and in a similar ranking. Robert and I were friends, too.”
“I think that—that becoming a parent is dangerous. You risk a lot. It’s a dangerous thing. You don’t quite know what you’ll become. You just… it’s a blind leap.”
“Aw, but I’m Cassie’s plus one!” Gabriel exclaims, and hoists himself up from the ladder and into the treehouse in one smooth movement. “You
“And I liked seeing you make it,” Castiel hums, watching Dean warmly. “It was generous of you to say it came from both of us, considering the work
“Cas?” Comes a soft, sleepy voice that rouses Castiel as well as relaxing him still more; and Castiel stirs, his eyes sliding open slowly. He realises suddenly that he is outside, and that the night sky is almost pitch black, save for the stars flickering dimly overhead—and that Dean’s body is resting on his own. “We fell asleep,” Dean states dumbly. Castiel thinks this is a rather obvious conclusion to come to; but knows better than to say as much.
The room—large, large enough to comfortably seat a dozen people, and then some—is peopled with gold and wiry cages, metal webbing crafted into bell shapes, ceiling to floor, with chattering, nervous, excited, flittering birds. Ordinary, unremarkable birds, most likely carrying all manner of diseases: thrushes and finches and sparrows and blackbirds. Dean frowns, shaking his head—a madhouse? His inheritance is a
It comes as a surprise when the Angel tangles his fingers with Dean’s. And it gets easier for Dean to imagine that maybe; he means something to the Angel. Something important.
Inside, chatter and laughter bubbles from the kitchen, and something sweet is on the air, like the scent of hibiscus but… deeper. Dean follows it, growing hungrier with every step, the idea of something sweet and warm sitting heavy in his stomach particularly relieving, until at the bending doorframe of the kitchen he can make out the source of the sound, and fizzes with anger at it.
“Think about it,” Cas leans forward, something weighty in his gaze. “Baltimore travelled far. Strange places and places, I’m sure, that reminded him of where his parents raised him. And if he hadn’t travelled that far in the first place, then his home would be less, when he returned to it. And he travelled so far, for so long—it got to a point, there was nowhere else to go. Just home. He’s teaching us things about snow owls that we never hoped we’d know: they’re a really elusive species, Dean, and so when they tracked him, and he flew back home, they were able to learn so much more about his life in the Arctic—and by extension, the lives of snowy owls in general—”
“You don’t think you deserve to be saved,” he states, voice lost to its own thoughtfulness. Dean still doesn’t look at Castiel. “Good things
“This is our shepherd, Mr Novak,” Bobby steps in, and unlike with Dean and Sam, Alastair doesn’t hold out his hand to Cas.
The girl cried out, pointing to the doe, lying dead or dying, twitching a very little, on his side of the river.
“I didn’t know that it would hurt you, like this,” Cas says, sorry and sad. Dean shakes his head, blinks, wills away the stinging at his eyes.
“Guys, what’s—” A girl appears at the trapdoor. Castiel recognises her immediately—she was the sweet and unbelievably shy girl from Dean’s music class. She makes direct eye-contact with Castiel, and after what Castiel must assume is a moment’s processing, flushes furiously, eyes bulging, hands withdrawing.
Like he can read Dean’s mind—or perhaps just his features, Castiel hardens his own and speaks again.
You’d have to be something harsh and brittle to be so thoughtless to the needs of a child, the need of a
“Catastrophic,” he answers, and surprises Dean with the fact he answers, seems to surprise Lucifer with the fact he answers, perhaps even surprises himself. “Unredeemed,” he continues. “Doomed.”
—and that Angels and Demons were the first around. There’s no saying which came first, but I suppose it’s always implied that it was the Angels… And Angels fought against the Demons for years, keeping them back in their own lands, before they noticed movement below their mountains. And they came down, cautiously, to witness the birth of Humanity. My mother said that the first Humans of Eofor were born of the forest and of the water. And, deciding to guide it themselves, the Angels placed the Cerydien sea between the two nations—the Demons and the Humans. And as Humanity spread, Angels took more and more of an espial role in all of their affairs, scared of how close the Humans would become to their sworn enemies—the Demons.
“Can you tell me more about your kingdoms?” He asks, looking at Cas, who has a look settling in his eyes that makes it even harder for Dean to take each breath.
Low, guttural ringing that sound eerily like Human voices; high twinkling chimings some of which could be mistaken for birdsong, others for windcharms, others for coins jangling against one another.
He replies carefully, his words forming in slow, delicate syllables on his tongue and unwinding carefully into the air between them.
Jack’s eyes flash a heated orange to stay the cold knives of light gleaming from Michael’s fraying vessel, fraying by the second. It’s like watching a star collapse in on itself. Inward and outward force. He smokes and cinders and burns hot ice before, in a moment’s moment, after the agony of seeing oblivion open its arms, he’s wrenched into ash. A bright flash of that divine, angelic, silverblue light thrusts out on every side, launching the sheet of the lake into waves, billowing at the trees from their very trunks, which seem like poppy stems in the wind. Thunder seems to roar around them in applause but there are no clouds about to cause it. And Michael is gone. Another one, gone.
“We grew careless, I suppose,” he answers, “and were found. Stumbled upon by eyes so hardened with hatred they could not bring themselves to look softly upon us.”
You don’t know,” Dean opens the bottle resting on the table and tips the rest of its contents into his glass. Sam watches: his jaw has locked, frustrated, as Dean speaks, but his eyes are melancholic as Dean pours himself another drink, “you don’t
“Just because there’re a few angry songs that like, happen to be political,” she begins, a little nervously, it seems, “there still isn’t a
“And,” Dean squirms, flushed, “I mean—you’re not alone. Not this time—obviously—you weren’t those other times,”
“Why should we do that?” Campbell interrupts Bela again, his face and tone growing increasingly frustrated. The Queen somehow manages to maintain her own indifferently even and empty expression.
And it had been such a nice evening—Claire had seen a recipe for falafel burgers somewhere online, and had wanted to try it out. Dean had had a business call and so Castiel and Claire had muddled about in the kitchen, making a mess and a lot of mistakes, both giggling at their own culinary inadequacy. When Dean’s call was done, dinner was pretty much ready. And the food hadn’t turned out half bad, in the end.
He hears that Cas has been taking long walks from the Eyrie, disappearing for hours and working late into the evening as a result of these excursions. He wonders if the shepherd is thinking of leaving him. Perhaps he’s seeking employment in some new farm, with some kinder and less impulsive farm hand to lay beside every night, playing with
Michael shrugs simply, lips turning up at their edges, probably against his better judgement, Castiel speculates. This smile is far too sentimental for Michael’s usual character.
Okay, so maybe that isn’t quite true; maybe Dean likes to graze his eyes over the muscled, slim torsos of his teammates after football practice, maybe he admires Dr Sexy M.D. a little
Conversations bubble and glimmer around them. The sun is a bright promise of life and tomorrow in the sky.
“You’re acting like you don’t,” Dean shakes his head, trying to pull himself from the grip of Castiel’s arms. He’s not some hawk for taming, and even if he were, even Cathy is allowed to fly, to feel the thrill of flight and freedom. “You don’t understand—you seem happy in the shadows—”
“I should get going,” he shakes his head. “I’ve been in you guys’s hair long enough, and I need to be in The Roadhouse in—” He glances up at the clock on the wall, and nearly flinches. “Forty minutes.”
“It was a good sort of surprise,” Dean confesses. “I had no idea you were coming!” He pulls back now, still holding on to Cas’s arms, and the Angel hums placidly and shrugs.
“—I,” Dean’s brother tries, but words fail him for a moment and his throat is left sounding ragged and raw. “—In Heolster—I—there was a—” Sammy stares at his shaking hands, his eyes beading with tears. Dean wants to reach out, to touch, to comfort his brother—but something mistrusting and terrified curling inside his heart is telling him—no,
“I have a song for you,” he states, “and have been asked by my employer to sing it. You may blame him, for whatever comes next.”
“No problem,” Anna offers her cousin a small smile. Castiel lets it comfort him within his resonance of despondency and sorrow. “Green? Mint?”
“Here,” She says, handing Castiel her coat. “Use it as a blanket, or a cushion, or whatever. Since you were such a good guardian angel to me and Dean, while
“Dean Winchester,” he says, with a slow delight which makes Dean sigh longsufferingly. “I never took you to be such a romantic.”
a little queasy.” Dean admits; his eyebrows knot up into a worried frown and he thinks his heart is rising up into his throat. He’s concerned that any second now he’s going to puke the organ up—along with several other vital body parts.
“I owe her everything,” Dean laughs. “Even today—with getting you to come back. I have to make all of it up, some way.”
Dean shouts, terrified tears searing his eyes, and Adam falters, because Dean hasn’t shouted at him like
“Are you looking for something in particular?” The man asks, smiling good-naturedly down at Dean. Dean looks up at him. The man’s eyes are kind, he looks at Dean like he wants to laugh and wants Dean to laugh along as well.
“Well, I hope you like my music more than you did nine years ago,” Dean states, and puts a mixtape into the player.
Jaw clenched, Dean follows angrily after him. Castiel walks behind, not looking at Dean, not looking at the hand of Dean’s which is woven in Benny’s. Dean swallows.
So instead he exits his bedroom, his face burning with embarrassment, which was probably Ellen’s intention the whole time. He scowls at her on his way out.
“Why did you hide this from me?” Dean asks, looking suddenly hurt. “What—you didn’t—you didn’t trust me? You didn’t think that I deserved it, seein’ you like this?”
He asked, eyes trained on Michael’s face, his high cheekbones, his delicate, sharp features, the soft twist of his smile.
“Uh—” Dean laughs, embarrassed—but there is no embarrassment with Castiel. Not anymore. “Worrying,” he admits, with a chuckle, and Castiel takes a step closer, and Dean can feel the warmth of Cas’s body radiating off him.
kiss, more than any other. The lips that are sugary with flavoured chapstick and part into blissful, serene smiles when Dean so much as compliments Lisa, the lips that have caressed, have laughed in the early hours of the morning with Dean, have entertained his nonsense, the lips that honestly deserve so much. Maybe this will be it for Dean and Lisa. Maybe if he tells Cas how he feels tonight—whatever the outcome—he’ll have to say goodbye to this farce.
If you felt like I wrote like a fever dream before, that's nothing on this chapter, hahaha. Sorry if it's not at all lucid, even by my standards.
“The thing about Cyndi Lauper, Cas,” Dean says, quite sincerely, “is that she’s already grown on all of us. I think we’re born liking her. It just takes real humility and sincere artistic taste to admit that.”
“Yeah, watch out for its teeth,” Dean advises. “When I was eight, I got bit by one of these bastards. Should’ve gotten stitches, but dad…” He trails off. Jack nods and shares a story about his own father injuring him in a fit of rage and being adamant afterwards that Jack didn’t need to go to hospital. It makes Dean’s insides squirm, his head reel with pity and revulsion. He tells Jack that his anecdote is very different to Jack’s. Jack shouldn’t confuse them.
“I hope you pick up over your stay here, brother,” Gabriel says with a small, apologetic smile. “You’re no fun when you’re upset.”
“Sammy’s counselling,” Dean rubs his hands awkwardly. “Mainly. It’s not cheap, and he’s… not great. Not happy, I mean. If you—I mean, that’s an understatement. He’s not employed, at the moment. Sort of…”
“And you,” Castiel turns to Gabriel and Anna, “why would you not stand up for Dean? Why were you so complicit?!”
“A great deal of time—to Humans, at least.” Cas smiles. Dean doesn’t like the affection he regards Dean’s brother with.
well, in this house, this house which everyone seems able to twist roots around, find good soil to dig down in, except for Dean.
“Thank you,” Dean bows his head. “But I fear that this place shall be forever associated with mourning, for me.”
“Why not?” Cas frowns defensively. Dean could trace the lines on his face and feels a curl of inexplicable jealousy at the shadows and light that are able to do so, touching his skin and carving across it. “It’s food, right?”
to—” Dean’s jaw is tightening and he can feel the humiliating heat of tears at his eyes, stinging his vision. His hand moves to grip the long table, instead of the silver of his knife and fork, desperate for an object a little more grounding to touch. He is anxious, he’s floating away from the earth, his head spinning while his father’s ugly words of duty and responsibility come ringing in his ears like the sound of bells cutting at air.
his father would laugh. His father would laugh and stroke the tips of Castiel’s feathers, distant, immediate, his face smiling, but his eyes crying. He would cup Castiel’s small hands in his own, tears falling onto the shadows beneath his eyes. His chest would rumble with both laughter and sobs.
“I’m hungry,” Cas presses a hand to his stomach and frowns. “Whether it’s what fathers do with their daughters, or not, I’d like to get food.”
“He went to see Dean play,” Castiel explains, voice small, face heated. For all Gabriel’s teasing, Castiel really
it. He wanted to be better at it, and he laboured hours upon hours to be better at the thing that he loved, at the thing that he cared about. For me,
Chay looked back up at Anna. He had seen all the faces of Abra Herself, and all in the expression of an infant.
It doesn’t matter, in any case. Summer in Cornwall is beautiful, Castiel is beautiful, the sea and the cliffs it throws itself against are beautiful—even the
He remembers when Sammy took his first steps, how he had walked over to Dean. Something so proud had swelled in his heart—and then Sam had fallen flat on his face, and Dean had stumbled over to him, blood rushing in his ears. He hadn’t wanted Sammy to fall. He never wanted Sammy to fall. He’d been crying almost as much as Sammy had.
“No,” he says, “no, of course not, no I don’t want to go through with this, I don’t want this to end. I—I love you more than I can say. Even with—even with myself in the way,” he laughs hollowly, and Castiel does, too.
“You wanna go home?” Dean asks, and understands, it would seem, just like that—at the sight of brokenhearted Castiel and brokenhearted Samandriel down the corridor, Dean knows, and knows what Castiel needs.
“Uh,” Samandriel falters. He swallows, Castiel watches the clench of his right fist and is reminded, of all things and at all times, of Dean. Yet, shocked by the press of tears that brand his boyfriend’s eyes, Castiel gets up, taking hold of Samandriel’s hands and grazing his thumbs over the boy’s knuckles—the knuckles that, while they will never be Dean’s, are still pretty and graceful and worthy of love, in themselves. Why should doubt sear at Castiel’s heart, now, of all times? He and Dean are friends again, he will move to study in England in a matter of weeks, he and Samandriel are resolved to keep dating all through that. It is Castiel who is complicating things, and Castiel who has hurt his boyfriend in the process—by not giving Samandriel the love that he deserves, especially in light of what their relationship has become.
“Right,” he murmurs in reply. “Really, Bobby. It’s no problem. It’s just for my peace of mind. I know you don’t need it.”
inherit, effortlessly, from his father. But outside of the physical, inheritance is something to be practiced. If shiva taught Castiel anything, it’s that tradition is a process. One cannot sit back passively.
“We can tell,” Castiel says, rolling his eyes and picking up discarded cups, setting them by the sink. Dean honestly thinks he’s going to cry with regret. “Why?”
coming up—but that’s—anyway. I told Sammy to get out of the house, with me, if that’s what you're asking.”
“Hiding from Miss Jo,” the shepherd answers, eyes sparking. They stand, facing each other, backs pressed to either side of the doorframe. Cas raises his hands in peacetreaty. “I’ve no ammo.”
“You told me, nine years ago,” Castiel’s voice can’t find firm footing, he breathes in rattly motion. “You told me nine years ago, that you didn’t feel the same. And that’s
he nearly cries. She’s running late to meet a friend, fumbling about the house for her bag, hammering up and down the stairs.
“The truth will probably cause you a little offense,” he waters down his words, diluting them in an attempt to rid them of any potency that might offend the young Human, but Dean pulls a hard, unconvinced face and Castiel has to look away.
Dean is silent, mouth hanging limply open, unable to answer. Cas’s eyes crease up, glittering, at their corners.
He looks back up into Cas’s eyes to see something flickering brightly in them. He swallows hard, nerves slicing his throat.
are their last moments, and no, they will not be short, and yes, they will be without forgiveness. Dean’s blood is fire. Dean’s hands are fury itself, but precise and perfect, Dean turns murder into and art, he thinks, and nearly laughs at the crush of skin through muscle through bone beneath his fingertips and the loud cry of pain, sweeter than any song, sweeter than any song and more erotic than skin against skin in the night; there is jolting pleasure at the crush of jaws and—
“John’s words, not mine,” Dean tries to smile, but it comes out sour and mangled. “And anyway, what, like he was wrong? That’s what I was. It’s what I am.”
Silence as they look at each other. What kind of resentment, Dean wonders, must the shepherd feel for him, considering all Dean’s barbed comments and cold treatment?
and his health, and all Castiel’s things get spoiled by his work anyway, so why invest in something which would be so quickly ruined?
“Bless us, O Lord, and these, Thy gifts, which we are about to receive from Thy bounty. Through Christ, our Lord. Amen.”
“And Jimmy too, of course,” Michael nods distractedly. Or—not distractedly. With that quintessential Novak focus on the just-beyond. “You were a real comfort to him, too. That might not seem impressive but, most adults failed to be one to him. Maybe all. He moved to an entirely new state to get away from most of the adults in our family.”
He forges jewellery alongside tools, and enjoys this finer and more delicate craft, and scrapes together enough funds for the inspiration which comes to strike him, at the break of September.
Down the track, beaten by rain. The only light is the light of the moon and stars, a cold, removed light, the light of memory. Dean is led into the future by memory. Maybe this is how you walk with loss. It’s possible to be happy and sad. Dean has been, all his life. He’s still trying to understand it, but, at least lamenting himself and the man he loved is… purifying. Heated silver.
Castiel looks back down. Gabriel looks out of the window awkwardly too, now. Michael’s gaze lingers on Castiel’s face for only a moment, before he sighs and shifts his line of vision away.
left behind university for even smaller things. Death—death is to heartache what a tsunami is to a glass of water.
“Yeah,” Dean murmurs, brow furrowed, not making eye-contact with anyone but rather staring at the ground.
He glances at the shepherd. He wonders, again, what paths the man’s past has tracked and how they led him here. But for all their small trading of secrets in dark candlelight over food picked from the fringes of bushes and hedges, Castiel has yet to plough his heart and heave this part of it up from the turned soil for harvest. Not for Dean. Not even for Dean.
had the worst time with this one. the document crashed and didn't recover, so I had to re-edit everything and editing is my least favourite part. I also lost a really good scene from the next chapter so RIP, that's sad. but anyway, here we are! This one's disgracefully festive but in my defense we're comfortably in November, now. Loads of love!
there for him,” Dean groans, despairing, weeping. “What have I done?” He asks, running his hands roughly over his face. “What kind of man am I? I’m no good, Cas, I’m—what was the last thing I said to Sammy?” He asks, breath catching in his throat, and new kind of terror flashing across his eyes. “What if he—” He stops, unable to finish.
“And the wisest men must only be able to imagine why,” Cas answers. “As you’ve only ever been softly spoken and respectful toward me.”
“What else?” Dean asks. Orange embers from the fire rise on the smoky air like amber stars. “What else can you tell me of the caves?”
“I told him to tell her, but…” Dean shrivels with guilt, though he doesn’t know what exactly it is that he's guilty about. “...I doubt he will.”
“Yeah,” Jimmy smiles gently. “I thought so. Is there anything you enjoy about it, though?” He asks, obviously concerned.
“Of course not,” he says at last. “All I mean is—the kids care about this kind of thing. It’ll be encouraging for them to hear about it from someone who went through a lot of the things them, or their peers might be going through.”
say.” The Demon’s eyes wander over to Sammy, Dean moves move defensively over to his brother without any other thought.
He’s drawn enough of his own blood with the pain of silence—silence about his sexuality, silence about who it is he loves, even with the
Once upon a time, Dean playing music was enough to send Castiel’s head reeling with adoration. Castiel
Dean doesn’t seem to know how to respond to this great burn of a confession, so he doesn’t—and so in an instant, Castiel learns his lesson: he will not bring it up again. Not for all the world.
“Greetings, Your Highness,” an Angel greets Dean, bowing deep and long. “My name is Samandriel. I am a servant in the High King Michael’s household.” The Angel has brown hair and wings of an odd dark ruddy brown colour, that Dean doesn’t recall his mother describing to him when explaining all the Angel wing varieties. They aren’t nearly as big as some of the Angels behind him. Dean’s mind flits back to Michael’s enormous and terrifying gold and silver pair. Dean wonders if perhaps the size of an Angel’s wings also says something about the Angel themselves, as well as the colour of them.
“He was, um, a French writer…” Cas murmurs, no less sheepish than when Dean first stepped through the door. Dean knows this, he’s heard Cas rave about the guy enough times, now. “He’s very good,” he says quietly, looking up at Dean.
The Angel grazes a cloth against Dean’s chest, and Dean closes his eyes and sighs at the touch. It feels better when Cas is the one doing this. When Castiel has cleaned Dean chest and shoulders, he looks a little lost about what he should do, next—and much as Dean wants Cas to continue, he definitely
“Quite the opposite, actually, Dean,” he answers honestly. “You think I wouldn’t want a friendly face in there? When I’m talking to students years younger than what I’m used to, about how I got where I am, which even
In the shower, Castiel’s head seems to grow at once more and more heavy, and more and more disconnected from his body. The steam does nothing to help this, it feels like heavy smoke in his lungs, and he thinks he might pass out from exhaustion. He’s relieved when he can step out, hot water twirling off his skin. He wipes down the mirror and scruffs at his hair with the towel before wrapping it back around himself and heading back toward Dean’s bedroom.
Michael says that when he got older, his teachers were nicer and more laid back with him. And when he got to college, he says they were all
physical—but Cassie was the only one who touched Dean with something that made his heart stammer. Being touched like that—
“I’ve heard that you’ve had some of those same troubles here,” Hess says. Alastair’s gaze flickers to her.
Sam sits on the armchair and pores over a ragged text. Perhaps, in another life, he would’ve been one of those well-to-do boys who finds themselves able to go to college, think, dream, read as though having thoughts is a profession. Well, this isn’t another life—and Sam’s lucky to have had the education he
“Your cab’s about a minute away, Dean,” she says. Dean turns to look at her, still holding his cell to his ear.
“He didn’t kill me, so I’d like to count it as a draw,” Lucifer shrugs coolly, but something flickers behind his eyes that gives away a feeling more resentful and bitter than the Angel’s calm exterior probably intends.
He’s not a morning person. Everyone knows this. But now, more than ever, he wishes he could be buried in his sheets, a mess of hair and limbs and pillows, unaware of the world—with the world gorgeously unaware of him.
Gabriel lets out a soft, remorseful sigh from next to Castiel and makes his way up the white-gold steps of the palace, the surfaces of which are covered with winding golden vines and leaves pressed into the rock.  These shimmer in the sunlight. Castiel and Anna follow slightly behind. Even as siblings, it is rude to impose on one another’s kingdoms.
“I don’t wanna talk about it,” Dean’s lip curls, and he makes a gesture at the air between him and Ellen, as though wishing to push her away.
“Why do you doubt so vehemently that the Angels would choose to act for your good?” She asks, her face turning a similar shade of red to that of her wings and hair. Castiel has to look away, creasing internally.
“You’re a Heran,” Mary was very aware of the fact that the boy was trying to goad her. “I can hear it in your voice, I can see it in your clothing.”
Castiel can’t answer, can’t even say that he would never consider the promise of a life with Dean any kind of downgrade, because Claire has barrelled over to him and is crying, is actually
a place costs money, too,” Mrs Penryn states, downcast. “And if you’ve a family, you can’t simply uproot everything, on account of a little discomfort. Mr Chambers thinks it wiser to negotiate with Sir Alastair, than risk everything on the gamble of displacing his wife and child to some new parish, with some new master who might not pay enough, and provides even less.”
“I’m doing—” Dean tries to swallow back tears and cough out a lie instead of any kind of painful truth, but no lies come. In fact, nothing seems to come—truth or otherwise. “I’m—” He chokes around his answer. “I don’t know,” he admits. He balls his fists and rubs them furiously against his eyes. “I don’t know.”
Jack’s throat constricts, he doesn’t say a word. Dean doesn’t wait for him to. He can’t face it. He walks away.
without them. You cry and want to punch a wall and you can’t tell anyone because they have all of their limbs and they wouldn’t get it, and maybe the person you want to talk to
“This is where you’ll be staying,” he states, turning to look at Castiel for the first time since Castiel arrived. “Your brothers and sister will be just down the corridor if you need them. Father has elected our finest knights and guards to patrol this corridor to ensure your safety.”
“No idea,” Dean shrugs. “I’ve got a lot of music. I have a feelin’ Sammy made this tape, which means—”
The hairs on her forehead and about her face were stuck down there, still curling, by sweat and tears, all for an infant who would not even thank her for he sacrifice.
He lies awake in the Eyrie staring up at the exposed beams of his bedroom, the room Bobby intended for his son, the son which became Dean—or the son who is still becoming Dean. The son to Bobby Dean is slowly growing into. And Dean doesn’t know how he feels about that, only that it hurts and heals him at once. He knows how he felt about it at first. Angry, exasperated. He was a thing hard with anger when he first came here—but it was his perfect defense. Now Castiel has washed away at that anger and left him something soft, feeble, vulnerable. He wants to be made coarse and brittle again. Coarse and brittle is what’s kept him safe, all these years.
“I did the same,” he laughs in the brief, steaming air between their mouths. “You left stuff at mine. In—in what I thought were moments of weakness, I’d take deep breaths of them. I—I liked the smell of you, too.”
“I dunno,” Dean shrugs. “Maybe a pulley system? Like, a way of pulling stuff up to the top, without having to climb up by the ladder and bring it that way?”
“No, thank you, Dean. You and Castiel should go play outside. Have some fun. You’ve had a long day.”
And Cas isn’t around the next day, either. Dean spends the whole day, primed and ready to run to the door, filled with nasty flashbacks of Lucifer tricking him into opening it with Cas’s voice. He springs to his feet more than once, saying he’s
Jack steps back, on instinct, Dean staggers forward and reaches out a hand to the kid’s arm, but it’s startlingly hot, now, and he pulls it back, his skin red and flowering in blisters.
I thought you were too good to be loved by someone, something like me—to hear you talk about—as though you were someone unworthy,” Dean shudders out, blinks, tears and rain like waters from a baptism tracing his cheeks, “Cas… you’re somethin’ damn impossible.”
“Still,” he shudders out, and yes, blinks out a few tears. Cas watches him, the way he used to look at Dean, all those years ago, when they first met and Cas was a new ethereal soldier who had not been softened to the world, yet. He watches Dean like, once again, they stand where they stood twelve years ago, in a barn shuddering with the force of an
But perhaps Dean has a very kind heart. Perhaps Castiel will find himself enjoying the Human’s company; liking him—maybe
“Home,” Castiel repeats, though he hadn’t meant to say it the first time, he says it and means it now. “We’re back. Shall we go in?”
But Sam helps, Eileen helps. They read and read—over weeks and weeks. Dean starts looking for work—motivated, if nothing else, by the prospect of impressing Cas when he comes back, comes home. Miracle starts sleeping in his bed, pawing at him to wake him up when nightmares hit, which they do, they do increasingly. Now, alongside the nightmares of hell, the nightmares of purgatory, the nightmares of Alastair and the nightmares of what the Mark of Cain turned him into, the nightmares of hunts gone wrong and losing Sammy, now there are nightmares of the moment Cas confessed, the moment he was taken. Dean already had nightmares about the various times he’d lost his best friend, but these ones are different. These ones hurt more. Even more. Now he knows everything he could’ve had. Now he knows everything he lost included a universe of possibility he never even had the guts to pursue.
Jo had a mother of her own, and none of the kindly looking women in the market-squares, nor the proud and beautiful and fearsome looking women in the King’s Court could ever fill the home in Jo’s heart wherein her mother resided; none of them ever would. The thought made something mean and unfriendly curl inside Jo’s chest, it made her resent all the women she looked at while considering what kind of a mother they might be. Ellen Harvelle was like the flowered honey the merchants brought to the market from the forests in the east, and all these other mothers were like the sour-smelling wine the high born men drank at dinner.
He asks immediately—and then swallows hard, taken aback that this was his immediate reaction. But Michael’s smile is sad, and he shakes his head.
“Dean puts on a façade of not caring about all that stuff, but we know he’s lying,” Sam grins. “He loves it.”
He wonders how Dean would react if Castiel told him, today, everything. If Castiel should be frank and honest, or casual, dropping it into conversation—“Oh, by the way, Dean, I still love you. I always will.” Perhaps he ought to be tender and soft about it. Perhaps he ought to start off by kissing Dean, and forget the words altogether. But then, how would he kiss? Should he wrench Dean toward him passionately, or let them drift together after the two of them have been talking, heads close together, for hours? Maybe he should be funny about it; say, “Dean, you’re not as subtle as you think when you’re drunk, and I know how you feel about me. Considering the states I’ve seen you in, you’re lucky I still feel the same way about you.”
Beach. Clouds made of ribbons in the sky. Dean’s hand in his. Some things are just good. Even with the uncertainty of living, even with their creator being something Bad, some things are just Good.
Dean scowls, attempting to cut Bobby off, but Bobby gives him a cool, hard stare that however frustratingly—or humiliatingly—somehow manages to shut Dean up.
“Lisa, I have so much to apologise for,” Dean leans forward like a sigh. “I don’t know where to start—”
“I’m not a kid,” Dean grumbles quietly, frowning at Ellen’s back, though shuffling a little sheepishly forward. “And shouldn’t you knock—”
“No. That’s the beauty of it. That’s the terror. Fact is, if one person’s capable of it, so is any other. What matters is the choice. That’s the ecstacy of choice. And the awe.” He pats Dean’s hand. “Sometimes, you’re like John. Sometimes, I’m like
here, surprisingly—ready to greet him with a bear hug and a ‘brother’ which, when they were roommates, used to prick Dean’s heart just a little at the thought that Benny only seemed to see him as family.
“I don’t know,” Dean replies, shrugging and shaking his head. “But a while, I hope.” He laughs. “I don’t want you to go, just yet.”
His soul flickered in his frame. Ahava could see that it had been bonded to another. It danced at the seams of his body like it echoed with an absence.
“I doubt I could,” Cas answers. His knee bumps Dean’s beneath the table. Dean’s heart staggers into his throat.
to pick a guy, though, it’d be him. She tells Castiel that Dean already knows, that she’s already told him. She tells Castiel that Dean was the first person she told—well, first guy. And first person in real life. Everyone else she’s told has been an online friend.
The sun begins to set. Eventually, he calls Madra inside the Croft, and fixes supper for her. Normally when he does this, she seems to grin at him, flashes him a thankful look before settling down to her meal. She all but ignores him this time. He frowns and shakes his head at the dog.
at music. Oh my gosh,” he smiles, the expression splitting his features as Dean flushes and squirms in his seat, “I couldn’t believe it, when I first heard you perform. You were so good. So, unbelievably good.”
Dean has a son who’s weird and dorky and serious and excitable and curious about everything and a bit of a nerd and Dean
Anna smiles. She pats his wing one last time before standing up, tucking a loose strand of her brilliant red hair behind her ear.
“Mazzy Star,” Cas repeats, then glances over at Dean. “Oh, don’t pull that face,” he rolls his eyes.
Eyes two suns, he turns to Sam and Dean. Dean’s vision is fading, there’s a lot of blood on the sand beneath him. He remembers the feeling of Cas’s grace twisting bright warm electric coils around him, the taste and spice of whisky at the back of your throat, when he would press a hand to Dean and heal him. Yes, yes, Dean longed for that, longs for it still. Worries he would see the stars fall if only to feel Cas’s touch upon him, knitting up the sinews of his flesh and tacking his bones back together, forging them within him like they’re only iron and he their blacksmith.
Michael frowned, puffing himself out, flaring his wings—though in the confined space, it didn’t work at all, and he could only raise them off the ground and up to his shins, and was certain he looked more than a little ridiculous.
Dean shakes his head, lip curling, eyes stung with bitter tears, tears bitter with twenty five years of being so
“Ah, I see you’ve taken to Elowen,” Bobby smiles, so that the lines around his eyes stretch out to his temples like bands of light. Dean is nonplussed. “The nightingale,” Bobby clarifies. “I named her Elowen. I found her beneath an elm tree. Broken wing. Elowen—that’s Cornish for elm tree.”
Dean gets up. He’s up, and round the table, in a heartbeat. Cas is on his feet and the moment is wild with ecstasy but all that happens is Dean pulling Cas toward him to hug tightly. He can’t give his embrace the same weight and sincerity Cas’s always seems to carry.
of them is summerwine,” Castiel points out. “The other is strong enough to take the varnish off armour—”
Castiel must live in Evadne, too, with his brother—he looks fairly young, so it’s unlikely he would have moved away from his home yet. But how
“I guess…” He looks down. “I guess I thought we’d earnt a happy ending,” he says again. “I know that’s not… I know you don’t think life works that way. But I’m tired. I wanted a happy ending.”
He prayed Castiel would find real and perfect happiness, and that he would live a life untouched by the horrors of war and anguish and death and loss.
“It was like…” He struggles to recall, struggles to find his words. “Like a rod, or a scythe. That sort of shape. With two short marks beneath the blade of the scythe, if you like, one after the other. That’s how I remember it.”
“And here it is,” Cas says, “a song, a love song, for one who has nothing, and is loved, anyway.” Cas’s gaze flits toward Dean. His eyes are the Atlantic. Severe and weighted and stormy with the mysteries of only the most ancient and buried things. “May all of us be the lucky objects of such regard.”
Writing this was a companion where there were none. It was so strange, that the traumas I set out in the opening chapters were the ones that I would live through while writing this story. The traumas, and me processing them, healing from them, aren't over. But the story is. That feels so strange. Those of you who said this story helped you on your road to healing, know that it helped me, too. We can do it, will do it, together. Those of you who said kind words over the past four years, said you loved this story or my writing or the characters, picked out phrases you loved, gave support and encouragement - thank you so much. There were lots of points at Cambridge I didn't feel worthy, didn't feel good enough, to be there. The things you said made me feel a little more worthy. There aren't any words for what that meant to me. I might not have made it through my degree without your kindnesses.
be, and cannot help it. His hand slips under his shirt and plays with the skin stretched across his torso as he lies back and listens to Dean’s voice curling into his ear from five thousand miles away.
“I guess so,” he confirms, wondering what other excuses he could possibly invent to keep him from going back with Dean and pinning him up against the walls of his home. They begin to walk back. Dean looks upward, squinting at the sky through the layers of foliage above them. “They love you too, you know,” Castiel says, but Dean isn’t listening. He frowns.
Bereft of it all his life, belonging becomes the new pulse of this redeemed life. He feels it at the strangest moments and it seeps and melts into everything: it’s there when they revisit the beach they married at, and mingled here with joy and gratitude; it’s there when Jack comes home and sits, cross-legged and strange-wonderful as ever, on the living room floor talking to their other children; it’s there when Krissy slips up one day and calls him
Dean, Angel,” Dean snarls, now. Castiel blinks. The Heran sneers. “You missed the coronation. And the funeral.”
“Shit, it sure feels like it,” Dean smirks back. All Castiel can think of is how much he would like to grow old with Dean; to see him on the front porch of his house—the big white house of both of their childhoods—on lazy summer afternoons, leaning back, maybe sleeping, maybe watching the world, maybe writing music. To see Dean knelt down on the living room floor with their kids—then their grandkids—playing and talking and helping and laughing, softly encouraging like Castiel knows Dean can,
And that just about sums it up. Lonely hearted, hating his own soul, with a mind too big and desolate for his own good, Dean is travelling alone.
“And then you will be forever indebted to a man who keeps predators as playthings, who keeps people as possessions, and who watches you as though he wants you to be
Someone must be able to help. Why can’t Castiel’s father make it happier? Normally he can, normally he makes Castiel smile and feel warm and safe—but normally the sad isn’t like
“I’m not feeling good,” Dean squeezes his hands into fists, and his wounds from last night tear open along their seams. His eyes begin to burn. “Tell him I’m sick.”
Several people murmur in confirmation, Castiel catches Ellen smiling encouragingly at Dean from the bar. Dean smiles grimly back at her, and starts up.
“Everything,” Dean looks up, from their tangled fingers, back to Cas’s features, his eyes, those eyes that have always pierced his very soul. Or perhaps not. Not if Cas had no idea, no idea that Dean—
He knows—or should have remembered—the knot and thorn of Castiel’s sense of belonging in any place, the spear the word
Thanks for reading, sorry it's been so sad so far - the first chapter from Cas's perspective should come round pretty soon :)
Heaven grows. Opens, as if it has petals to unfold, to lay out against the yawn of the sky. A new and swelling reality, universe, of its own. And good. Good, at last. Something to be proud of. Jack has given Castiel something to be proud of. And the opportunity to write a love letter to Dean—and this is what it becomes: he builds a new heaven as a love letter to Dean.
“What did you guess?” Dean asks quickly. Charlie shrugs, looking as though she’d rather take back what she just said.
“No, I took it from one of Mr Singer’s cages,” the shepherd answers flatly. Dean balks, eyes wide, before realising at Novak’s expression that he’s pulling Dean’s leg.
The next couple of chapters should come around daily, least another two chapters will be posted before Thursday!
A pocketful of poems for his father, and another, soon, for Dean. It seems right: the two men who he has loved, who—his heart trips—have loved him best, in this life. One half of it is done, Jimmy’s. Now, he realises, the truly difficult task is set: he cannot publish a poetry collection for Dean without any forewarning: he’d be outing Dean, for whom sexuality has been a constant sorrow and struggle. He’d also be ambushing Dean with his own feelings—how would
The house across from theirs had been empty for months before the big green ‘For Sale’ sign had come down and Dean’s mommy told him that a new family would be moving in there.
I haven’t,” Sam’s voice has gone quiet again. It fractures in his throat as he stares at the ground. “There’s something
Castiel jumps down the steps of his porch and turns to Dean. His dark eyebrows frame his face in such a way that he either looks constantly worried and confused, or inquisitive. He looks inquisitive now, peering at Dean with eyes that might contain the moon and stars. The boy is like something out of a storybook, Dean thinks: something about him seems magical and unhuman, like a fairy or an elf or some other creature that lives in the forest and mountains.
But they speak, increasingly, Dean ridden with guilt and unable to voice it, Castiel riddled with sharp pangs of longing and… the feeling of walking through a forest, burnt. Mourning. Mourning for a landscape you stand in, but which has dissolved. Been destroyed. This is a place which cannot be returned to, even as Castiel stands in the midst of it.
banner, and Claire does very well at avoiding complaints about how embarrassing holding this up at the airport is.
A noise of confirmation emanates from Michael as he steps towards Dean to dry the things Dean has been washing. Castiel is tempted to sigh; shiva isn’t a time for
“He’ll be back,” Sam says, as Dean’s heart crumbles a little, watching Cas wave goodbye to Ellen and go.
“I went to some dive bar on the other side of town,” Dean explains. “Shady place, but cheap, and I wanted to get
“Oh,” Castiel says, dumbly. He hadn’t even considered this possibility before. How could he not? How had he been so stupid? Dean is right. Castiel feels as though he is being dragged underwater and waves are folding over him, because how
“I’m so sorry, Cas,” Dean blinks, more tears springing onto his cheeks, “I’m so sorry—I know you were dating Balthazar, I
Over a year since he last entered it, Dean returns to the big white house across the street, and Jimmy hesitates in the hall, between turning right into his office, or left into the living room. It leaves Dean strangely taken aback—one year ago, if Dean came over wanting to talk, wanting help, Jimmy wouldn't hesitate. Dean would be in the living room, on one of the couches or an armchair, Jimmy pulling another seat close, talking to Dean as intimately as if they were kin, as if Jimmy had
“That I get to take your virginity?” Castiel asks, pupils so big his eyes are practically all black, right now. Dean licks his lips and nods. Castiel presses his forehead against Dean’s. “I like that too…” He steps even closer so that all of their bodies touch, the tips of their toes, all the way up to their foreheads..
With the way he stops playing, it for a moment looks as though that is it, the whole show, finished in just three songs—but then Dean speaks again.
Dean is finally sat properly in the car—well, sort of properly. He mainly sprawls. Castiel looks over to him. He still hasn’t got his seatbelt on.
“I could do that, if you want,” Castiel offers, without thinking, and is about to kick himself again for saying such foolish, needless things, but then he catches the way Dean’s breathing falters and his pupils dilate and something like hope stirs itself inside of the Angel.
teach something so—so unfathomable, spectral, strange and different and beyond the scope of a human mind, let alone understanding—how could Dean have taught something, someone, like that, to love?
“You’re too much like Mary,” John growls. “She was wrong, you know, Dean—she had her head caught up in the clouds, too—and I loved her, granted—but she was wrong. And it rubbed off on you.”
“Forgiveness,” Dean states, finally, still looking at Castiel. Then he looks back to his ex-students. “Cas and I wouldn’t be where we are today, if it weren’t for forgiveness. His, to be exact.”
what’s your obsession, now?” Dean asks, unable to stop himself. “Have you got a new favourite era? A new favourite genre? A new favourite author?”
hadn’t bothered shaving today, of course he never would. Crumpled suit. Blue tie. It’s all almost picturesque, how ruffled and beautiful and heartbreaking the man looks. Dean presses his trembling lips together.
“And I know that when I was six years old, and scrawling words into my notebook with my dad peering encouragingly over my shoulder—” Castiel’s voice actually breaks of here, to his surprise and embarrassment, at the mention of his father even in such an innocent light, and he has to look down. His eyes sting. His hands shake. When he looks up, again, there are a pair of green and gold eyes glued to him that refuse to so much as blink. Castiel, surprised by his own actions yet again, smiles. “When I was writing stories at six,” he continues, taking a steadying breath, “I wasn’t thinking about how much money I would make, how successful I would be, how many people would know my name.
“Now,” Novak says, rising, picking up the muddied cloth and tossing it into a basket on the floor, and taking a small tin pot from the little table beside his bed, “you’re lucky I have some of this left.” He approaches Dean again, sitting. “Give me your foot,” he says, and Dean balks.
Cas’s horse stops right next to Dean’s and a hand curls around his shoulder. It’s warm and Dean wants to lean into the touch, and instead he closes his eyes at it and hopes that it will be enough.
Everyone is eventually encouraged to find their seats, and Castiel spots Dean looking suddenly afraid at the realisation that there’s a
“My mother calls me Daf, which is short for Dafyth,” he explained. “She’s from the Hill Tribes, eastward. We travelled here years ago, but I still remember our old home, and the wild horses that we used to tame, and run with, there. My father was an Eofori. In Eofor, I am called David—that’s how Dafyth is said, here.”
“Don’t go getting ideas about demolishing my old guitar,” is all Dean can think to say, fearful, looking down at her. She looks up. Her eyes are watery.
Dean stirs, like he is going to say something more, but just before he does, John stands to make a speech. Castiel glances to Dean, now rigid and militant, listening to his father address the crowd in the hall.
“So it’s all for your own self-preservation, is it?” Dean asks, irritated, and unimpressed. The air is cold around them, the stars distant and watchful. Clouds like smoke drift slowly across the vast surface of the sky.
Castiel goes with Dean. He would, to the ends of the earth, until the end of all things. This is what he does. Follows him even unto death, even beyond its veil. Does, and would, a thousand times over.
“You could still make cider,” Novak frowns. Dean sighs, but finds it is slightly more affectionate than exasperated, and picks up his fork. “Aren’t you going to say grace?” The shepherd asks. Dean falters.
He climbs up the steps of the house’s huge porch, after his mommy, looking at the ivy that scales its pillars. The old man who used to live in here liked to garden. Dean wonders if he gardens much in his new home, wherever it is, or if he’s still too sad.
Dean starts playing, one note at a time, the sound filled with vibrato and nostalgia as he plucks at his guitar.
He sighs. He thinks of Castiel. He remembers something Castiel said to him, once, on their quiet nights over dinner lit by amber flame and soothed by the sound of Madra’s steady breathing.
“I can,” Dean protests, trying not to raise his voice. “I’ve hearded cattle, out in Kansas, I’ve looked after goats and cleared out pigsties—”
“Damn straight,” he confirms. “Even more miserable than I’m making it, already.” The shepherd rolls his eyes. “And come for Christmas Eve, as well. Everyone will be there. It might even be fun.”
Dean wants to blurt out everything he feels for Cas in this moment. Even though he doesn’t know exactly what those feelings
of plaid,” he explains. “Still do, but don’t tell Cas.” Mara giggles again at this, and Dean begins to smile genuinely. Warmth that he feels whenever he talks to kids, makes them laugh, makes them smile, ekes from his chest and into his features. “He used to say I looked like a lumberjack—especially when I made fun of what
“It feels like this,” Dean holds up his wrist which, from the amount of blood he has let from it in summoning spells, attempting to open the Empty and retrieve Cas from it, has been scrawled with scars. He pulls down the collar of his tee to show a long, jagged cut he earned from a werewolf, last week. Yes, he wished at the time it had cut deeper, longer, harsher. Yes, he still wishes this, in the moments where ugly thoughts overpower him. He pulls back his sleeve to show the angry scorch-mark left from a witch’s spell which again, he let hit him. So many wounds over the hunts since Cas left. No Cas to heal them. “It feels like
How would Cas have responded, nine years ago—before Dean fucked up? When their relationship was all joy and laughter and constant, animated flirting—animated, Dean now realises, half by fear, and half by hope. And the hope, the hope now glowing dimly like embers blown on in a dying fire—for nine years, Dean thought it was out, forever—it crackles and sways in shimmers of terrified red. Even the hope is scared, now.
Underneath the chuppah, Castiel’s heart a trapped and singing bird, they say their own vows before exchanging rings, promising each other as holy and sacred, both promising
what the Angel has just said, let alone think of a response to it; before Castiel strides, lividly, out of Dean’s quarters.
“Dude,” Dean says, softly, “she’s been through a lot. She’s just acting up to test our boundaries. Give her time.”
The backs of these chairs are broader than Castiel is used to, and it takes some effort to manoeuvre his wings around them.
Castiel is kissing at Dean’s back, just as he did, that night—but now that Dean can see his face, he can see that the Angel’s eyes are wide open, fierce with disgust. His lip curls, repulsed, against Dean’s skin, mottled by scars. The memory makes them look even uglier than Dean ever could have realised they were.
“I don’t think I want to go back,” Castiel confesses. He knows that this is an absurd thing to say, but he has said it anyway, and he knows that he has only known Dean for two days, but this feels right, and
words wrapped in soft affection and expression riddled with it. He’ll manhandle Castiel—not hard—standing behind him and adjusting his arms or stance, Castiel’s soul radiates bliss in these moments, though it will take years for him to understand why.
“I’m glad you think so,” Cas’s eyes crinkle at their corners, fold over themselves like the creases of poppy-feathers.
Dean clamps his jaw and stares out at the horizon. Vaguely, in the far distance, a hulking gray mass of land approaches from beneath the white vale of clouds. Gulls have begun screeching around the boat, riding the rippling air above it and tilting about like puppets with their strings pulled taut above the air.
“Daddy says she’s gonna have hair just like Castiel,” Mara answers, looking up to the doorway, where, perhaps, Castiel stands.
“Not in so many words,” Castiel admits, and to Dean’s quizzical expression, answers, “he kissed me.”
“Maybe,” he begins to rinse the conditioner out of Dean’s hair. “You also smelled of wood. Green, like a forest. You always smelled green.”
Defeated, Mary wiped the loose earth from her hands onto her dress, before trailing them in the clear stream and wiping them again. She stood up, picking up a stick long enough to be a shepherd's crook, and trailed it in the soil after her, ambling slowly back towards the citadel. She glanced back up at the sky. Still grey, still overcast.
“And have you been talking to your mom?” Ellen asks. Dean’s worried expression slides into a scowl, souring the crush of feelings trapped in his chest.
the one who was taunted, who was sneered at, who was scared, even—what, you think it was easy just ‘cause I had a good group of friends?”
“Yes,” Castiel frowns, head drifting on its usual confused incline. His charcoal lashes frame his bright eyes a little tighter. “And I wasn’t aware that you actually
I'm so sorry this has come along so late! Hopefully the content for the chapter will make up for it!
“You really don’t have to do that, Castiel,” Bela tries to soothe sympathetically, “not after everything—
And in an instant… they’re all back. Like the sun appearing from behind a cloud. Jack has reversed the damage caused by their sudden disappearance—no more cars smashed and mangled together on the road, planes lifted from the ground and undented in their projection up into the sky. Even the plates dropped as they were carried through restaurants the moment Chuck decided to vanish every living thing in the world are miraculously un-smashed, back in hands, stacked to be washed or handed, full of food, to hungry customers.
“Didn’t see that coming,” Jody rolls her eyes. “Okay,” she pulls out her phone again, and scrolls through for her next lines. “Those who G—fuck that—
“He’s beautiful, isn’t he?” Alastair asks, but doesn’t look at the creature as he says this, only stares at Dean. Dean nods again.
“Dean,” Castiel’s hands shake, he wipes at his tears with his sleeve. “I’m sorry, then—but don’t talk like that—you’re my best friend, and I—I misread, I misread—”
Jimmy’s expression shifts, though Dean still isn’t looking at him. He forgets how to attempt nonchalance, what acting natural looks like, what normalcy means. All his limbs are too stiff and too tight and a muscle in his neck twitches.
There is something different about Dean—Castiel can sense it, even from way across the table, even when Dean speaks, even when Dean
Staring as Colt says a final word, muffled by its quietness and the jabber of students outside, Castiel sees Dean hang his head when the principal turns and makes his way back over to Castiel.
desperate to save you. So desperate that when one of my Demons made contact with him, with a deal—well,” Lucifer smirks, “he took it. And this Demon healer also let John know of the
The journey has been long. But maybe this is Dean’s reward. Maybe this is the sound of the trumpets on the other side. It sure feels like it. He thinks of the warmth in Jimmy’s eyes when Dean announced he hoped to marry Cas, all those years ago, in the kitchen of this very house. Jimmy looked so endeared, so happy with the thought, so certain it was true. Yes. Yes, this is the sound of trumpets. Trumpets and clouds pillowing and a victorious rest reached.
His heart jumps in his chest but his brain ticks slowly, not comprehending, or believing he has comprehended, what Alastair has offered him.
Normally, Dean hates Cas’s music. But this song is hurting his heart in a new and beautiful and agonizing way.
“I want that, too—” Castiel says, heart a trilling bird, against Dean’s lips. Dean’s mouth beams against his own.
“Ah, not much,” Dean shrugs. Somehow this song, and the darkness surrounding them, and the warmth of the car, and Cas’s beautiful eyes trained on Dean’s face, are making it remarkably difficult to concentrate. “Mainly just… Y’know, practicing music. Playing guitar. Trumpet. Drums. Piano. Bass. Percussion, when mom asked me to. The usual. What about you?”
“My music is nothing,” Dean shakes his head. “Not on you. Not on what you can do. And not on what the world’s got planned for you—”
“I’m tired,” e says softly. His voice sounds dull and flat in his ears. “I’m going to my chambers to get some rest, if that’s everything. Please don’t interrupt me unless it’s…” He sighs emptily. “…Absolutely necessary.”
“What was that line in the Shakespeare,” Dean grins, heart fluttering, watching the shepherd, who doesn’t reply.
“I want that.” Castiel nods. Dean’s thumb grazes his cheek. “I—I’ll count the days until I see you again. And wait for you, too. Of course. of course I’ll wait.”
Mara stands and pulls Castiel towards her for a hug. He laughs awkwardly, tearily, as she stands at least a head taller than him from where he sits on the floor, hugging him tightly.
The mirror-voice splinters and refracts around him, fragments in pain, into pain, more pain, more mirror, more pain.
Dean cups a hand over his mouth and shakes his head, the world outside his lungs turning into a vacuum and sucking all the air out of them.
Dean looks out at the rugged, wavering landscape. It doesn’t seem soft to him. Soft to Dean? That’s the crops in Kansas, in the middle of Spring. Lush and hopeful with growth. Spring showers leaving spattered droplets of water across feathery leaves. Landscapes flattened and trodden down by millenia of grazing, wild farming. Hills cresting softly in the distance, in a violet haze. Not stretching wide and vast and sudden as a wave.
“I love you, Sammy. You’re my little brother. I know the idea of a future is so scary… but you have to have one. I’ll walk it with you.”
that if he’s gonna be a good friend to Dean, he’s gonna have to start compartmentalising: feelings for Dean are for
And Dean’s other option is turning Cas down, lying to him, biting down on his feelings, as he has always done, which has turned out fine, so far—has hurt no one but Dean, who
was pretty, too—and Cas was sat on the other side of Dean, a detail Lisa either can’t remember or is omitting, for the sake of this cutesy fairytale narrative with which she’s shaped the events of her interactions and then relationship with Dean.
“That’s just the response we were hoping for,” Azazel sneers, leaning back triumphantly in his throne-like chair. Dean wants to be sick.
Anna ripped her gaze away from Michael. Her brother stood slowly, she could feel him stare steadily at the side of her face all the while, but she refused to look at him. Even as he approached her, she had yet to even glance at the child that killed Ahava, had only glimpsed the bundle of linen that he was wrapped in. When she finally flitted her eyes back over to Michael, he was standing but two feet away from her, holding the infant as though he were made of freshly fallen snow. But there was plenty of snow on the mountains, and nothing could be precious about this delicate little boy who sacrificed another to bring himself into life.
Had been answered with a vice grip around his other arm and the wordless threat of breaking this one, too.
to speak; not to Dean, not after everything. She holds up one of the plates helpfully, and Castiel’s gaze flickers over to it, ripping off Dean’s body.
“Dean,” Anna says firmly. Dean jolts and turns to face the redheaded Angel. He hadn’t realised that she had stayed behind.
And at the release of Cas’s second novel, this is no less the case than it ever was. Two novels, a number of essays in critical journals, and a whole book on women and witches in the English literary tradition. Dean scrolls obsessively through book reviews, less modest in number than his first books, which received a handful of reviews at its release, however warm and excited they were by the prospect of the young, Jewish and openly queer writer who bound the three together in equal tension and perfect balance. Now the name of Castiel Novak is steeped with success, fame floods the name suddenly and Dean, however much it would kill him to actually
“Where do you normally live?” Mara asks. Dean swallows loudly. Castiel stares at the plate Dean has handed to him, refusing to look anywhere else, frowning heavily. He feels as though he has been suspended in ether, tiny strings made of glass holding him perfectly still, immobilised, and that any second they may break, or drop him, or both. All around him is nothing; silence; he starts to ache, thinking about his father and how much time he spent with Dean
with Dean—all of that seems to point toward Cas wanting the two of them to be a thing in the long run. People don’t jeopardise their relationships with their best friends for nothing. This is a leap of faith, and one that Castiel—the most tentative and thoughtful creature Dean has ever met—made it.
“Well, may the days of Mr Winchester’s humourlessness soon return,” Cas shakes his head solemnly. Dean threatens to pour his wine down Cas’s shirt. “Not so soon as
to, and they’ll want to hurt us until they understand us, and how can they understand us, if we keep on kissing in the dark—”
Dean has a bag of tea—loose leaf, Earl Grey—just for when Jimmy comes over; he’d have no other need for it, and in Dean’s humble opinion, it tastes like ass. But for Jimmy, anything. And now, in golden summer light of a surprisingly cold day, Jimmy cradles the tea, taken black, in his hands. Rocking it back and forth between right and left hand, curled neatly around it, Jimmy moves the teacup to the pulse of his own thoughts, looking up at Dean, who laughs self-consciously.
Dean glances at Castiel at this point, who continues to frown at Dean. Why is he telling the story in this way? Why is he looking so pointedly at Castiel? Iron and fire rush through Castiel’s veins: he knows why. Dean suspects that Castiel has a crush on him—and is—the
They’ve reached the stream and neither know what to do—the way of crossing it is already risky; stones made slick with the downpour, and the way around this is obviously not to do what they both, grinning and shouting angrily at each other, end up doing—which is to leap, full force, at the first stone in one swift and uniform motion, together.
“I think you presume to know too much,” Castiel starts, thoughtfully. “I know that every faith claims to be the only one of any legitimacy, but… We’re vain, when we claim to know better than another religion, or the powers that religion worships.”
a damn thing. His heart breaks and flakes and turns to bitter ash inside his chest. Jimmy—all this time, has thought that Dean really
Today isn’t Castiel’s first day of sitting shiva. But the last time he sat it, his father had held his hand the whole way through and told him to cry as much as he liked. Now Castiel has no one to tell him that his tears are allowed.
“I would have us allied with any Kingdom or people if their principles and morals were similar to my own—and by that I mean, fair and just—were it to benefit our own causes.”
Two months into Castiel dating Samandriel, and Dean dating Lisa, all the awkwardness between Dean and Castiel has died down and been forgotten, and Castiel has made peace with the fact that Dean will never love him back.
“Things didn’t end too sweet between you two,” Dorothy nods in a wry kind of understanding. “I get it.”
“What do you mean, look at her eyes?” Mick grimaces. The bird, giant as she is, is beginning to tire herself out against Cas’s steady hold. Dean does as Cas suggests, though it isn’t easy, what with all the bird’s movements.
An old man and his wife used to live in the big white house opposite Dean’s nice green house. They had smiled a lot and their children used to come and visit at Christmas and the old lady used to say that Dean would break a lot of hearts when he grew up, which Dean didn’t think was true—and then one day mom said she’d gotten very sick, and the old man who’d been married to her had stopped smiling and seemed to move slower and something in his eyes turned sad. Then one day Dean’s mommy gave him a big bunch of white lilies and had told Dean in a quiet voice that the old lady had died. Not long after that, the old man moved out of the big white house.
“What would you have me say, father?” Michael bit. He looked out at the city, despondent. “And what would you
Castiel glares back his father, but doubts that it’s at all effective considering his current condition.
is their bastard brother, Adam, the product of their father’s inability to think beyond a present tense need, or to look at the wants and hurts of others.
Cas knew him. Cas knew him by every fibre and follicle, every piece if grit and gristle, and yet, and
It seems as though all the eyes in the room have flashed pointedly over to him, sullen at Dean for disrupting the quiet of the grieving house. His face flushes, and, of all thoughts to whistle through his head, the one that causes Dean the most distress is the thought that Castiel will look at Dean, now, and think that this means Dean must be shitty with kids. Which is totally unfair, actually—kids are just about the only people in the world Dean
Perhaps this moment should chasten Dean, make him grow more cautious. But he swells with too much adoration to slow the electric sharp and magnetic tug of his heart towards Castiel’s heart, his being toward Castiel’s. Out in the fields, herding sheep, Dean turns to the shepherd and grazes his hand up the column of Cas’s neck, drawing close so that his lips might linger an eternal moment against Castiel’s, with the late spring sun shining bright and rich behind him.
be, I guess. Our dad was a good guy, so…” He presses his lips together and seems to try to laugh, but it comes out strange and grated and so unconvincing that it’s cut short before its first syllable tumbles past the copper-haired man’s lips. “Well. Y’know. We loved him.” He looks down. “It sucks.”
He’s going to die. He’s going to die, he didn’t say a long enough goodbye to Sammy, or to Ellen and Jo, or to Bobby or his father—he didn’t say
Castiel glances down at the mess of dog at his feet. Barely a dog. More like a haybale. It pants and stares expectantly up at him, eyes bright and big and black, tail wagging. Something in its countenance is expectant.
He did all this for the child. She knew it and yet—and yet was stung by longing, wishing, that it would be for her,
“Very,” Alastair’s smile is chilling, Dean’s gut twists. “As my return is looking to be.” Dean nods, unsure of where to look.
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Castiel shakes his head. Of course—this house has been a wealth of security to Dean Winchester, over his lifetime, and is perhaps Dean’s only real way to reconnect with Castiel’s father, outside of Castiel himself. And the writer has simply
“Is this not cool?” He asks, indignant. Claire snorts. Castiel is acutely aware that the entirety of this performance is being observed by their family.
Well, of course Castiel remembers. Of course, he could never, can never, forget. Is cursed to remember Dean and everything about him for the rest of his life.
if you will. Truth be told, Dean, you were right to think that Angels are egotistical and supercilious. We are. Angels pity Humans.”
“I know I’m maybe the last person you’d want to talk to, Cas,” Dean acknowledges, “and you must’ve gotten a lot of these offers from a lot of different people, by now; but if you ever need anything—
move too fast,” Dean disagrees. Cas doesn’t look happy at the challenge. “We didn’t,” Dean repeats. “This would always happen, with me. What—what my dad taught me—he taught me before I even
“Thank you,” her beam comes out slowly, like the dawn, but once she’s smiling, she’s positively radiant. “You look nice, too.”
Castiel’s blood is growing colder. Mary manages, voice floating down the stairs, to sound both hurt and frigid. Castiel strains again, heart hammering as he leans forward to hear Dean say,
“You did,” Castiel agrees. “I apologise—I think it slipped my mind during each of my stays with you. I could teach you some, now?”
down the phone just as Dean was thinking what would be the best way to get Gabriel to jump out at them as Cas opened the front door after arriving back from the airport. Gabriel would be up for all sorts, he might even jump off the roof if he knew it would give Cas a big enough fright, even though he’s in the fifth decade of his life.
Dean doesn’t say anything, only stares at Castiel like he couldn’t possibly be more uncomfortable, and honestly, could Dean
Still, he continues teaching Dean, however. Every night they sit in the croft together, and tread through Keats, and, as March begins, Dean brings Castiel a pile of books—writers he’s mentioned passingly with undeniable affection—for them to start on, and tells Cas these books are his, now, his to keep.
But his thumb grazes Dean’s chin, and he pulls his husband toward him for a kiss. Dean’s lashes flutter. He kisses back.
Here in the vulnerability of the kitchen, where anyone might wander in, Dean’s blood freezes in terror at the word.
and one of the most powerful women in the Four Earthly Kingdoms and this is what you decide to do with it? You become a thief?”
“Cas,” Dean says, worriedly. Cas chuckles, and his fingers, tangled with Dean’s, flex softly. Is he squeezing Dean’s hand?
“Of course,” he cracks a weak smile. “Never.” He opens his arms, “Hug it out?” He asks. Castiel laughs pitifully.
him, what Castiel would’ve said, if he’d have pushed Dean away or pulled Dean close, if he wouldn’t have ended up moving to England…
Eileen teaches Jack how to play chess and Dean watches, worrying with his hands, before he gets up, sighing, and announces that he’s going to bed. He gives Jack one last hug before leaving.
Bitterness and melancholy wound themselves across Mary’s heart at the thought of this arrogant young man coming and invading her sanctuary in the forest, kept to herself for so long.
“You know, over the years, I have observed that it’s extremely difficult to be able to see the stars as clearly, from the Earthly Kingdoms.” Castiel squints slightly, still gazing out of Dean’s open window. Dean should probably close it; he and Castiel have a few candles lit and this could attract insects through the open window—but Cas’s speech interrupts his thoughts.
“Okay,” Castiel nods. He squeezes the cloth over the bucket to allow the last of the excess water to drip out, before holding the cloth a few centimetres above Dean’s chest, rising and falling steadily. How can Dean be remaining so calm in moments like this? When Castiel’s frame is about to tremble and burst? How can Dean be so
“I’m sorry,” He says again, “I must’ve—I thought, after everything you’ve been saying tonight—that maybe you felt the same—but I guess I was wrong—”
“Hey, you forgot something,” Dean calls as Cas reaches the door. His friend turns, frowning, as Dean basically sprints over and frames Cas’s jaw in his hands and kisses him deeply, turning Cas so Sam gets a full view and can have no doubts whatsoever that Dean is
But it still doesn't explain why Cas stayed there after graduating! And what ruined their friendship! Well, that's coming up.
“Nice hangover you’ve got there, Dean?” Ellen asks, raising her eyebrows. Jo rubs her eyes and rouses herself as Dean gags, practically stuffing his fist into his mouth.
“Geez, you don’t have to be so sarcastic about it,” Gabriel replies, frustrated. “Why’re you acting so immature? We know you’re the youngest, Cassie, but this is—”
“You’re dead,” Dean shakes his head, looking down at him from the top of the stairs. Lucifer was meant to be dead. Cas was meant to be
“And the Empty only came, ‘cause of me,” Dean shakes his head bitterly. “It was on me. Again, it was on me. Cas wouldn’t have started talking, if Billie hadn’t been about to kill me—and
is Dean in Castiel’s head? His skull rings with it. Dean is in the shepherd’s head. In moments of low light and twitches of starlight, what enters Dean’s head is a pierce of blue like lightning over a rippling sea. When he sees cliff faces—which now, on a farm beside the roar of the sea, is every day—he thinks of a voice like shale grazing softly but with the thrilling threat of pressing harder, against his skin. Is the shepherd in his head, too?
As soon as they’d arrived, Dean had scampered in, without a backwards glance, full of energy and practically bouncing off the walls as he decided what toys he should play with first.
“I think I want to go home,” he says, looking up to Jimmy with wide, scared eyes. His brother sighs pointedly.
Dean looks down. His chest is vein and bone, what chance could it have of containing what’s storming inside him?
Dean laughs. He kisses Castiel. He has to lean across the table and press hard into Castiel for balance. The beak of his unfinished nightingale presses into his palm.
Tears shine at the fires of Dean’s eyes. Castiel can make them out, each glint and glimmer, aided now of course by the hundreds of eyes spattered across his wings and hands and heads.
to worry about you.” She squeezes, then lets go of Dean. He pulls back and the air outside of her arms is cold.
“But it’s been some time since you last saw him,” the shepherd draws beside Dean, watching the land pan out around them. He has a slow way of moving, the way mountains must grow, sure and certain, something untapped and enduring within. No unnecessary steps, no unnecessary gestures, it could be graceful but for its stubborn minimalism.
“I like feeling useful,” he admits. And seeing as how he won’t be able to eat with the others, he wants to at least be part of the process in some other way.
“We just don’t get them on the mountains, I suppose,” Castiel shrugs. “Where do they normally live?”
It takes days. Days of drinking and unanswered prayer. Dean’s head is a fog and Sam won’t stop asking annoying fucking questions. Dean hates it, hates life, needs Cas back. What’s the purpose of anything, if he can’t enjoy it with Cas?
Dean leaves his job as a firefighter, but keeps his friends, who he sees often and who invite Dean and Castiel for dinner in their respective homes. Dean plays with the children of his coworkers during these visits and Castiel will watch while stabbed with longing to see Dean with more kids of his own. They take over Sonny’s Home and Dean teaches the boys to fish and play ball and cook and play guitar and takes them on long walks and slowly but surely breaks down the walls of even the surliest, even the angriest, even those who carry bitterness in their hearts like it’s their last lifeline. The home is owned, technically, by Jimmy Novak, who Castiel poses as to get them around every knot legality and bureaucracy would present them with.
only a boy—he had stared at Castiel with his mouth open, lost in the swim of tears in his eyes, watching trembling pink lips sound every line, balling his fists at his sides with how much he loved the dark haired boy. Ached with love. Always ached.
“Oh,” he replies. Is Cas only just coming to this conclusion? If Michael is not comfortable with telling his younger brother the whole truth on any matters of his past, why should he be comfortable telling
“Thanks,” Samandriel beams, though it's undeniably insincere. In the next instant he tugs Castiel up, out of his seat, with streamlined motion by the hand, and pulls him out the room.
The question is pointed and well-aimed. It hits Dean, square in the chest, and he trembles, unsure of how to respond.
is the one who has been gifted with walking with Castiel. It’s not self-indulgent enough to be pride, and it’s too unbelieving to be happiness. What is it that Dean is feeling?
The house is big, though not quite big enough to be called grand, and would be called square were it not for the unexpected turns in its architecture and the stables and storehouses adjoining either side of it, and would be called gray, were it not for the surprising warmth of hue in the stone, and the ivy crawling over its face.
Now Castiel has no reason to count. He knows how Dean feels and knows how Dean hurt, knows what was sacrificed that night in the hope of what Castiel might stand to gain. But Dean doesn’t know his portion.
“Well,” Ellen nods, pressing her lips together in a thin, unconvinced line. “It’s fair enough, I suppose.” Fuck, she
“Cool,” Gabriel grins. “I needed a way to avoid doing any actual studying, and this seems kinda perfect.”
“And what have they predicted right, so far?” Campbell bites back. “All I know is that in front of us lies a weapon powerful enough to stave off the Demon forces
Dean leans back on his palms and hums a tune Castiel recognises, notes whispered from his past like a voice calling his name, but blown over by wind, the winds of time and change.
worked like a dog to support him, so he and Sammy wouldn’t have to live like I did! Who gives a shit if I resented him, sometimes? It was
The few days before the journey are punctuated by Sam’s absence—Dean doesn’t know where his brother is going, or what he’s doing.
“You, uh—how are you feeling, now?” Dean asks. “Like, you feeling more nervous about going back to work, or less? Or the same? Or…” Damn, he’s bad at this.
He prickles at Dean’s use of his full name. This confirms it: Castiel, in this form, is less of the friend he represented to Dean when in his human form, and has returned to that unknowable, untrustable thing he was to Dean when they first met.
Michael pauses. He looks down, swallowing around something obviously sharp. He considers his words. Castiel expects more lies, or half-truths.
“But I’m not done yet, you know. I don’t doubt you’re wondering where I—as my twin would probably put it—‘stormed off’. Well, as it turns out, the Demons were having something of a civil war at this time, and needed someone to patch things over—someone, that is, to rule them.”
helping John prepare as sincere a welcoming speech as possible, and Dean missed all of it because he was
does he mean, by this—again, it unravels something in Dean’s chest as much as it makes that same chest constrict.
At least it mostly seems affectionate. If it wasn’t, Dean guesses people from the town, and even several towns over, wouldn’t come with injured birds for Bobby to nurse back to health.
“Obviously not,” Dean answers. “I think you’re just being a drip. What makes you think it’s dangerous?”
Dean tells Castiel, when evening has fallen and the two of them are sat outside in their usual spot in the courtyard, of how he sleeps better after sitting here with the Angel. Castiel smiles says how glad he is.
two paths to take: Dean can’t come out, but he can’t stand watching Cas with Samandriel either, can’t stand the bittersweet unhappiness of a relationship with the tragically beautiful Lisa, can’t stand watching Castiel fall in love with another man and have it not be him.
“You mean a lot to me, too, Dean,” he replies, still staring at Dean, to which the green eyed boy snorts.
“Not really,” Dean shrugs. “Colt’s a conservative, deep down. Not, like, a terrible guy, wavin’ a Bible around and yellin’ about damnation—and he wears the guise of social liberalism as far as
“If that’s the way you see it,” something sparks inside Dean’s chest. “And why do you like this stuff so much, Cas?”
They hear the bells and shouting from across the horizon. Dean is in his room, looking out in the direction of the sea, but Adam shouts for him, and the panic in the boy’s voice is enough to rouse Dean from his thoughtfulness and sorrow. Rushing into his brother’s room, Dean sees Adam staring out
he smiles in an attempt to be comforting, but he balls his fists from the effort of keeping his hands from shaking.
“What if I don’t kiss you, all night,” Dean offers, and though it’s absurd and a half-joke, he almost means it. Cas’s laughter is warm and rough as seastone warmed by the sun.
“I herd ‘e got ‘im an ‘orse,” one of the men mutters to another, in a thicker Cornish accent than Dean has yet heard, and Sam balks in Dean’s direction while Dean attempts to translate the words in his head.
“Yeah!” Krissy exclaims, as the other teens all echo agreement. “Why’re you here? And why’re you with a famous writer?” She grins. “And why’re you guys
“Are we just overlooking the fact both of you were being totally invasive and insensitive?” Cas asks with a glare. “Michael, don’t pull that face—you weren’t just complicit, you were a participant—”
“Oh, that’s wonderfully charitable of you,” Castiel rolls his eyes, “but I’m going to have to decline.”
Thanks for all your gorgeous and touching comments so far. I know I'm awful at replying to them but I read every one of them and they make my heart sing, and I'm trying to reply better! Loads of love xx
He follows it—or the sun—or the sound of his own tentative hopes. Or the tide-tug in his chest. Trees and fields flash by. Is he excited, or afraid? He drums his hands on the steering wheel, if feels like weeks. Eventually, he reaches coast. In minutes, or years? Time is a gaping sea which stretches out beyond Dean’s attempts to confine it in his mind, by his own human comprehension.
He went down to the sacred caves on his twenty-first birthday and accepted a fate which, paradoxical to the long stretch of life it bricked ahead of him, felt synonymous with death.
“What the hell?” Dean manages to gasp out. He still trembles. He doesn’t understand. Something feels as though it crawls all over him. He begins crying in earnest. “What was that?”
“Don’t be angry at Jack for processing his trauma different to the way you processed yours,” Castiel states, and this has an obvious effect on Dean. He straightens up, looking Castiel in the eye. “I know you saw—saw some kind of mirror, in his experience of his father, to yourself. An exaggerated, a more extreme mirror. I know when he arrived you were expecting a child angry with what the world had put him through, and relieved to be out from under his dad’s thumb. A boy aching to rebel from the ideology he was taught. But that’s not who Jack is. That’s not what he is. Maybe one day he
“Well, until then,” Dean shakes his head. He needs to get to his room, to pull out the weapons which he knows best, those most deadly in his hands. Until then, this sword stolen from a servant will do.
And so they have to gather round Jody’s kitchen table, after a lot of hugs and tears from a lot of different women, while Cas is forced to recount, again, how it is he came to be rescued from the empty, and again, fall from heaven.
glad to see you, Cas,” Ellen smiles gently. She pats Castiel’s shoulder. Castiel hadn’t realised that he and Ellen were on such informal terms.
Dean swallows hard, his hands trembling, and he tries to speak up—to tell Sammy he’s wrong, that everything he’s saying is wrong—to be the big brother he knows he’s
“I was just curious to see what you had to say about me,” he counters. “Anyway, if we’re talking about low self-esteem,
“I miss Cas—of course I miss Cas—of course I want him back. I’ve prayed to Jack—” Dean looks up, surprised, at this. “—But I guess what he said about us having to figure it out ourselves was true.”
This leaves Dean and Castiel with a small double bed, which overlooks the surf and the receding sun. The curtains are a threadbare and pale linen which drift like mist in the wind singing off the back of the sea. Castiel doesn’t mind the small space. He has discovered, these past few months, that heaven is in the small space between Dean’s arms. And eternity now stretches in the now brief fluttering of his life.
“I can’t find my bag,” Castiel confesses, eyes burning, as they reach the bottom of the stairs. Suddenly, it seems as though they’ve stepped right back into the vibrant motion of the teenage world they both inhabit; it basks in the orange and yellow lighting of Charlie’s house; music throbs and pulses through their surroundings as though it is alive; teens dance and chatter and bustle all around them and seem to create a language of their own in Castiel’s ears.
“No I don’t!” Sam exclaims, frowning as he attempts to step round Dean again. “Stop it! You’ve been acting weird for
Nine years of apart. Nine years of heartbreak. Nine years of continents apart, of not speaking, no acknowledgement, no interaction, no closure, no peace. No happiness. Nine years of Dean’s life entering motions, going through them, constant, cold and mechanic, like clockwork. Nine years of alone.
“I don’t know what I believe anymore,” Mary shakes her head quickly, bright eyes even brighter with the obvious press of tears. In the strange light of the sun, muted by violet curtains as it strobes into the kitchen, these eyes look more lilac than they do green-blue. “But I know that I love my little boy—and that I might have been wrong about stuff, and that my parents might have been wrong about the stuff that they taught me, and that being a good parent means
“Yeah,” Dean says, breathing the word out and watching as Cas rises from his lips to peer down at him. “More than—I want it—”
‘Luminous, dark, horrible and wonderful, Novak does justice to grief, and to the complex, hybrid image of his parents. The final poem,
An Angel is curled around a limp Human body, flesh captured in stone, face pressed into the curve of the Human’s neck. Sobs seem to wrack the stone Angel’s body in the pulse of the rain the same way they wrack Michael’s, now.
“I know almost everything, now. Past, present, what is, what is to come. It’s all one, to me. Especially here.”
“No they didn’t.” Dean flattens his palm against the table, unsure of what to do with his hands. “No,” he shakes his head. “Jess was—Jess was—” he doesn’t know what to say. Saying ‘the love of your life’ is a bit of a death sentence for Sam, as is ‘soulmate’. But isn’t that what she was? Or was it? The fear of entering a relationship with Eileen, in light of this, must be… What would Dean do if Cas died? He can’t think about it. Was Jess Sam’s Cas? “Radiant. So kind. She was sacred then, she was so special to you, and it’s no wonder she’s sacred now. I can’t imagine what it was like losing her, and I’m so sorry I wasn’t there for you like you needed, all through that. I’m sorry for not understanding what addiction’s like—”
“And no sweethearts?” Dean finds himself asking. The shepherd frowns, confused. “No-one waiting for you, back home? No-one who asked you, pleaded with you, not to leave, none writing you letters, no sweet young Irish lady hoping to call you husband, and to call you that, soon?”
“That’s so funny,” Samandriel continues, radiantly. “How typical of us! Never saying what we mean until we don’t mean to.”
“You can’t mean that,” Michael laughs bitterly. “I thank you for flattering me, but…” He sighs. “I fear I have done you great wrong in my own thoughtlessness.”
“Apparently your old man has a sense of humour,” Dean answers. “He thought it’d be hilarious watching the three of us, on an empty planet.”
Nobody will tell Castiel more. Only that Lucifer had attempted to return, thirteen years ago, that resolving the dispute between himself and their father had not been the aim of his sudden reappearance. Their father had still loved Lucifer too much to be able to defeat him, that he had still been too wounded, too splintered, after the impact of their mother’s death—and so the task to oppose Lucifer had fallen upon Michael’s shoulders.
“What else could it be?” Castiel asks, sourly. “Dean’s a homophobe. I thought it, and kept on thinking it, for a long time. And he’s confirmed my suspicions—no, not that, he’s amply
He doesn’t say: Dean’s performance at the roadhouse where he won Balthazar over so completely and where Balthazar made Castiel doubt whether or not Dean was straight. When Castiel made the connection between Dean playing
“How do you know?” Balthazar asks, not even defensive. He smirks over at his friend as he takes another sip of his drink.

“Killing John Winchester gave Azazel great pleasure, but it was once again part of a larger plan,” Lucifer continues. “And you see, he had no idea … But he found out about our plans for dear, sweet Sammy—remember your miraculous healing from what should have left you, broken, immobile at the very least, forever? John
But not yet. Grief, like a wound infected, festers, and is not nearly so bad the moment it is inflicted as it is a week, a month, five years down the line.
“I’m sure you will,” is Alastair’s answer. He smiles. Dean swallows. His fingers haven’t stopped digging into the arms of his chair.
“Yes,” he admits. Dean listens, interest piqued. Still, it’s rare that Cas will talk with him about his youth. “I travelled a great deal, when young—and before, by good fortune,” he looks up and over at Dean from where he sits, “I came here.”
“They are,” Bela says coldly, crossing her arms as she regards Dean. It’s strange how, in the smallest of motions, Bela can display such a deep dislike. “Have you got a problem with that?”
Michael speaks over him, pressing his hand onto Castiel’s shoulder, grounding him in a moment’s moment with his heavy, warm touch.
They reach the stream which must have been emitting the sounds of water Castiel heard earlier. Dean chases it upstream, Castiel follows behind, perplexed. Turrets of water bounce off stones and birdsong rings round the trees about them, small finches darting from one branch to another, cocking their heads curiously then flitting away in panic at the Human and the Angel, traipsing through the forest.
“You have your brother to train you—” Dean tries to say, but Castiel laughs and shakes his head, cutting the Human off before he can continue any further.
A man who stands in a great black shaggy coat which reaches his knees, and a broad and battered hat which he only takes off at Dean’s entering, to reveal mussed hair as dark and roughed as the coat. A blue scarf is coiled loosely at his neck: the man is all rumpled layers, his shock of whiteblue eyes burn out from beneath his heavy brow. His jaw is stubbled with dark hair which betrays the time he’s been travelling as much as the battered pack, dropped onto the floor. A collie sits at the man’s feet, staring up at Dean with a gaze as wary and accusative as its owners, tufts of feathery coal ears pricked up.
Sometimes they stop on their rides to allow their horses a break and to graze quietly at the surrounding plants—while Dean and Castiel lie on the dew-covered ground, their bodies pressed together, their lips meeting to kiss slowly for what is a glorious infinity. The sun pours down upon them like honey through the dappled leaves of the forest, Dean’s otherwise light brown hair threaded with gold in the sunlight.
This is the closest Dean can get to a love confession without his heart falling out of his mouth and onto the sheets in-between them, but it doesn’t matter, because Cas has leant forward and wrenched Dean into a limb-binding hug. Another one.
Dean says it, and it’s half true. But he’s still feeling weak, feverishly so, and shaken, and furious with himself at not being more constant and reliable. Thinking of things constant and reliable, he thinks of Castiel. Rattled by panic and near catastrophe, he wants Cas here to stand beside him.
Dean swallows back the burn in his eyes. He takes Benny’s hand again, and runs. The hard footfalls of their pursuers sound behind them. When Dean looks back, Cas is surrounded by a ring of fire, but he doesn’t look scared for himself. His eyes are on Dean.
“Fine, be angry with me,” Dean shakes his head, “fine, think that I embarrassed you in front of a group of boys you should want
Anna bounced the little boy resting in her arms, the way she had seen mothers do to their children in the streets of her home. She still didn’t know what to think of this little one—but Michael was right: he missed his mother. Ahava had carried him for nine months; nine painful, uncertain months, with no other thought than to see the child inside of her safely into this world. She had succeeded. Ahava and her baby had travelled the world and learnt of all its pain together from the confines of Evadne in the nine months of her pregnancy, and now, this poor child was to suffer the world without a mother to hold him.
She doesn’t want to see him, now. She ignores his texts and calls and Dean is given his updates from Jody, Donna, and Sam, who she’ll still happily talk to. Or, not happily. As happy as possible for a kid with a life as fucked up as Claire’s has been. And maybe it’s not all Claire’s fault. Maybe she wanted him to push, to persevere, to fight and prove that he thought she was worth it, where all her life she’d been abandoned by the people who seemed like they could be a dad to her. Jimmy. Cas. Then, Dean. Jimmy and Cas didn’t choose to go. Dean did. Will she forgive him for that?
Dean pretends to look unimpressed, but cannot sustain it. Not while looking at Cas. Not while looking at the very definition of wonder.
Maybe it’s just a matter of waiting. Sam says it’s just a matter of waiting. Jack says the same thing. So Dean waits.
“Strange, unfamiliar. You began the trend of calling me Cas, now I could count on one hand the people in my life who still call me Castiel.”
“But I’ve tried some of your other concoctions,” Dean laughs. “I don’t even think honey—dark or not—could fix their taste.”
“Not only a boy,” Sam laughs sadly, shaking his head. He looks away, into the fire. The flames make ringlets and rivulets in the air.
Dean laughs. He beams. His eyes crease up, pure and silver tears wrung out of them like the starlight rain around them, two figures woven together in the downpour.
“The King of Hera has instructed me to tell you what an honour it is to have you here. His Majesty and his council are waiting to greet and welcome you in the main hall. You will be shown through in just a moment, when more of your court has assembled. After this, you will be shown to your rooms—we pray you find them acceptable for your stay. Tonight, the King is holding a great many celebrations of your arrival. We hope you find these, too, worthy of your presence”
how I felt about Cas. And not to diminish those feelings at all—but I only feel it, even stronger, now. Every moment with Castiel, he’s only ever made me feel it stronger. It was like throwing ash against the wind, trying to bite down on everything he made me feel.” Dean swallows. He still holds a tight grip on Castiel’s hand. “Jimmy… Jimmy Novak said being in love with someone, it was like coming home,” Dean’s voice is wrought with tears. He hand is twined around Castiel’s like a promise. “All the things he said, I just—even as a kid—I thought of
Years of idolising the courage and brutality of warfare and fighting could not possibly have prepared Dean for what he saw; and as fate would have it, this idolisation of the affairs of battle served to disadvantage him in the grand scheme of things. After having seen conflict like that; Dean understands why John dislikes the Angels so much for their apparent utter indifference in the affairs of war. He now understands why John is still so furious that no help had arrived when he had asked for it. In comparison to the war against the Demons, what Dean has seen and fought through with Dione is laughable, is child’s play. But scars still litter his body from the battlefield, and sleep is something which Dean is deprived of now, more often than not, plagued instead with nightmares of swords sharp enough to cut through chainmail and woken by fits of cold sweats.
“Gone,” he says. And her grandmother, and aunt and cousin, who lived in that place with them. They’re—everyone. All gone.”
“I’m still pissed off that I’m being used as some kind of bartering tool, if that’s what you want to know,” he frowns, even though he feels guilty about his tone with the look Ellen gives in response.
“It doesn’t matter,” Dean finally speaks up, and for the first time in the proceedings looks up from his hands which rest on the table. “I’ll do it.”
He can’t make Cas stay, and he won’t let him. And the only way of doing that is pushing him away, hard. So hard it bruises and breaks both of them.
“Well, if you imagine the slating that bi people get within the community,” Castiel says, “then imagine that half the community doesn’t even know you exist. And then imagine that outside of that, most of the
“I suppose I should be,” Mary hardly suppressed her smile—it was in Cai’s nature to be playfully flirtatious with whoever he spoke to, something in his manner and his long, dark, ringletted hair and warm black eyes had half the city in love with him, and at least another quarter deeply infatuated.
own mother. Who had spurned every one of her attempts to comfort him, speak to him tenderly, sit with him, cradle him in her arms when he missed his own Beloved beyond the grave, cry with him, Michael, who could not comprehend the tenderness of a being so pure that paradise itself couldn’t stand to wait for her and had stolen her away from the earth, centuries too early. Michael, who would not weep, even now, but idolise the creature that tore Ahava from the land’s surface, cradle

“Well, boys,” he says, and Dean thinks to dart toward the book but again, Lucifer holds up a hand and Dean is thrown back against the wall of the bunker, head connecting to concrete. He groans sharply at the lurch of pain, vision white then red, as Lucifer takes a step toward Jack—no. Will Lucifer ask Jack to join him, a second time? Or just hurt him? And will Jack say yes?—This thought tastes bitter, kind and innocent Jack filled with a self-doubt and fear to parallel even Dean’s. And all this in a three year old.
“You also never used to get that kind of drunk,” Castiel murmurs, squinting at Dean. “So why did you get so drunk, last night?”
salad options are appalling,” Dean answers, even when Tamara and Castiel pipe up in agreement. “Quit the rabbit food, start eating real crap like the rest of us,” he gestures down to his own lunch.
They make it to the road and to the Impala, and Dean unlocks it and opens his door. Castiel doesn’t do the same.
He takes the copy of Twelfth Night the shepherd gifted him last Christmas, and sits on his bed, and flips not to the beginning of the play, but to the song which once he sang to the shepherd of Mr Singer’s farm, at the times they roamed the hills together, at the times Mr Novak held out a strong arm to steady Dean from all his falling, and at hour the day crested and Dean arrived at the Croft and saw Castiel for the first time, each gold morning.
“Nice answer, Rick, but it doesn’t count if I’ve performed one of his songs by way of introducing the topic.”
He leads the Angel though a grey archway decorated with a stone shield and sword at its top, and out into the town set on the lower levels inside the castle walls. Here, it smells of sweet-meats and rotting fruit and woodchip. Dean finds himself staring at Castiel’s wings, yet again—whenever he even glances at them, something inside of him twists in a sharp, odd kind of want. These wings are stunningly beautiful—more beautiful than any of the others Dean has seen today.
The Earthly kingdoms often face conflict with each other, as well as with the Demons: the most common of these conflicts is that between Corinna and Dione, in a disagreement over the spacing of land and territory. Just a few months ago; Dean’s father had been forced to go to war against Dione because of how closely allied Corinna and Hera have been these past few decades. Disputes between Corinna and Dione occur very often; as they are set so closely together. Assisting Corinna in their war was the first time Dean saw battle. He has been training for war, for combat, his whole life—but at fifteen, his father had finally allowed him to actually
