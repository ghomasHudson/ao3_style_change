John and Sherlock spent three idyllic days at The Waldorf Astoria. No strike teams to call down upon the heads of would be miscreants. No big brother lurking behind every CCTV camera, just the two of them. Unguarded. Un rushed. Naked. Literally and figuratively.
“Do you know, that if I told any member of my team to put a gun in their mouth and pull the trigger they would do it? Do you know why? Because they know as insane as it may seem, that somehow I’ve got them. They trust me."
"I do know, but as his friend, it's not my place to tell you. But I'll talk to him.  And if it helps, I think he's making the biggest mistake of his life."
“You Dr. Watson are over confident.” Mycroft refused to be rattled simply because this man was an elite killer.
"If kittens are made of blue cashmere then yes Irene, it is in fact a kitten. Thank you so much John. It's...perfect."
Sherlock looked at him with confused annoyance. “I was expecting you.” John half thought he was going to say “duh” afterwards. “When are we leaving?” He pressed.
“Hello there.” A young man, a very young man, early twenties, dark brown eyes, chocolate brown hair, his dicription was plan, the man himself was anything but. His eyes were dark brown yes, but not so brown as to be black these wild eyes were the color of jewel enstatite, and the chocolate hair was shot through with gold, and there was an engery about him that made Sherlock pay attention even more then his looks did. The man Sherlock thought was a spring wound too tight. Thats when it hit him...
"And Mercy, thank you." The words were heavier then usual, from a grateful brother to an understanding sister.
John never made a show of his power over the rest of the team, he was the senior most member with more training and skill then all of them put together and they all knew it. When he had to voice it there was a problem. Cardinal had fucked up and she knew it. “Sorry J. Copy that.”
Later that night John and Irene talked over the events. Sherlock lay on the bed his fingers steepled resting lightly on his lips, eyes shut, naked feet in John's lap.
Sherlock's whole body shivered at the sound. In Sherlock's mind when John laughed the gods where pouring pearls down from Elysium, just for him. It took a moment for John's laughter to die down, when it did, his eyes fell on Sherlock and John gave a contented sigh. Still in a mischievous mood.
"Hit the locker room lads. Oi!" Greg hefted his and John's gear bags and jogged to catch up. "Talk." It wasn't a friendly suggestion.
Back upstairs there now sat a fully dressed John Watson sipping tea and beaming. “I do love a Christmas fete.”
"Well maybe for an hour or two, but I wouldn't bet on it." They kissed deep and slowly breathing each other in and loving the feeling of falling together. They broke apart and took some time to just smile and reveal in the moment, in this bubble that had been created by their growing feelings.
Everyone perched against the bricks or leaned on a railing, a few sat on the ground, Sherlock stepped out and attempted to merge with the rest of the crowd, but Thomas’s eyes found him in an instant and cast Sherlock a look of smug nastiness that made his skin crawl.
"Don't do that. It's not your fault that the coroners report was incomplete. You couldn't have spotted that. You knew the man was lying, it just took a moment to put the pieces together." John set about pouring two rock glasses of rich amber liquor.
John reached his hand between them and ran his fingers over the head of Sherlock's cock, ready to take him in his fist and stroke Sherlock to release, but one touch of John's hand was all the spark that was needed. Sherlock ached sharply, violently, tears streamed into his curls, his fingers digging mercilessly into John's shoulders and John's name ripped from his throat. White hot cum spilled over John's fingers, onto Sherlock's belly and down his shaft. John lost his rhythm, his breath, and his mind at the primal beauty of the sight. He rocked into Sherlock relentlessly, all the while Sherlock pulling John closer in the grip of his legs, arching up to him, giving him everything. John took everything, and pored himself, his soul, with a jerky shudder into Sherlock's depths.
"John..." Greg had been friends with John since primary school and he knew John as well as he knew himself. John was most certainly in trouble.
John stripped down to his paints and climbed under the covers. He always enjoyed this part of the evening, watching Sherlock across the room slink out of his dressing gown, cast off his tattered t-shirt and last but not least, slip off his pajama paints and walk naked to bed preening ever so slightly under John's gaze.
“How positively magnanimous of you.” Sherlock pulled a face all sass. No anger, the mood was as it had been, warm loving and fun. In a word, Happy.
“The whole of London? I hadn’t noticed. And your sofa is perfect.” John deepened the kiss to something more.
"Hey Sherlock!" A pretty dark hued girl leaned in the door frame. "Please say you're here to see me. At last." Irene's roommate the admittedly very beautiful yet also very annoying American named...
"Nooo Sherlo..." John's words died when Sherlock crushed him against the wall with a hungry kiss, that trailed John's jawline and back down to suck deep purple love bites into the crook of John's neck, all the while Sherlock's hands delved into John's waistband tugging at his shirt, belt, button. "Sherlock you're mad! We can't. Molly is in the next room."
Sherlock sat in the spot where John had left him. Eyes close fingers steepled and resting lightly on his lips, trying to breath evenly, trying to think properly and trying to ignore the erection that was sucking all the blood from his brain.
“Because you could never stand to be wrong, and you believe in  some kind of misguided hope that John and I could still be together.”
"Oh please! You're the one always accosting me in ever other dark corner. Why in Gods name would I be interested in following you?" Thomas's face turned three different shades of red. Paul, muttered something in the background and rushed off. Sherlock realized his mistake as he watched Paul's retreating back. Thomas backed Sherlock against the wall and was inches away from Sherlock's face now. Too angry for worlds he just made a sound that reminded Sherlock of a dog that had his hackles up. He raised his hand, and to Sherlock's surprise his hand was not made into a fist, but an open palm. That surprise turned to pain as that palm slammed Sherlock's head against the wall. Pain burst throughout his skull and blackness took his vision.
Jim's low sing song voice chimed in. "I don't go in for field work Dr. Watson. But if my Tiger wants come out and play...fine. But I'm not doing this for you, you're not my favorite and if anything happens to my sniper along the way they'll be picking bits of you out of the tigers teeth down at the London zoo for weeks my dear."
"Sherlock. I don't see any reason for us to leave Baker St. plus it would leave Mrs. Hudson, unprotected" Sherlock raised an eyebrow brow, understanding that they where obviously putting that conversation on the back burner.
“When do we leave? Why are you pointing your gun at me?” Sherlock asked slightly quizzical, but with no fear.
“It’s a large optiration. And two years ago the Americans botched the opt and now the sellers skittish. J, never once in all our years have you questioned a mission. You have loved this job every step of the way. I think it’s time to take a closer look at what you love now.”
"Stop there. You need medical attention." A young constable that Sherlock knew to be one of Lestrades, pups put a hand in the middle of Sherlocks chest to stop his progress toward the ambulance.
“Permanent commitments. Mmm.” Sherlock raised an eyebrow and asked softly a hint of worry creeping into his voice. “John are you a virgin?”
"I know." John  almost whispered the words. And they were all Sherlock needed to hear. He felt his face go warm.
"No it's not." Sherlock kicked at the mans leg as he walked past to get the first aid kit from the loo.
"This is bollocks. Gentleman let's go, leave the queer to his practice." Thomas nearly spat the words at John and Sherlock.
"Well, ugh." There was clear hesitation in Lestrade's voice. John stopped in mid motion, closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose.
“Text me when you’re done here.” Sherlock tried to sound nonchalant, but after what they’d just shared that was impossible, Sherlock’s voice didn’t have that caviler tone he’d been aiming for. John made to reassure him with his response.
"So this is unorthodox...in...so many ways, and if no one else is going to address the elephant in the room then..."
"You don't deduce an inanimate object. You extrapolate data." Sherlock shook his head woefully as he read. The data he found there made his throat tighten.
John stood on the tarmac looking down at the MacBook on the hood of his Land Rover trying desperately to focus on the plans in front of him. The Chinook was behind him ready for take off and so was he. So where the fuck was Moran? Had his fickle boss decided he wasn't allowed out to play after all? Fuck if John was going wait around for them to get their psycho shit together. Alone it was then. Just fuckin fine. And if he died trying to save the man he loved then so be it. Sherlock was worth a thousand deaths. Wait then that would leave Sherlock...still a captive. Fuck! Where was Moran?
Sherlock had a decision to make. John most certainly would not let him stand alone if there were farther issue with Thomas. So the question Sherlock put to himself was this, was it selfish of him to carry on with John knowing Shipton's plan, knowing that it could destroy John's future? Sherlock didn't want to end things with John, but being the cause of his ruin was unthinkable. So decision made.
"This." Moran gestured between the two of them. John shot him the finger. "Is just fine with Jim. We have a beautiful new protege at home who's dying to impress Jim, and I think Jim is rather dying to be impressed. To tell the truth I think they couldn't wait till I left."
“What?! No!” Sherlock protested and moved away a little frantic. John held up a closed fist. His men froze. He went to Sherlock John took his hands and rubbed his thumbs over his knuckles.
"Because, if even a fraction of the things I know about this man are true, there is no one else aside from him that should be standing here with you Sherlock." Elliot seemed rather happy with himself.
"You're sooo hard, oh God!" Sherlock whimpered. His words made John shutter. Sherlock ran his hands from Johns ass up, to brush over his cock and up still more to John's chest where he stopped to tease at John's nipples with his thumbs. Sherlock studied John as his face contorted and his muscles jerked under his hands. Sherlock's heart ached. He loved this man. And this was goodbye. Sherlock took John's face in his hands and rubbed their cheeks together, letting his lips ghost over John's open pleading mouth nipping and licking at John's lips.
John was already beginning to feel the warming effects of good scotch and Sherlock's playful wink was only adding fuel to a fire that John had been trying to bank for years. He often wondered if he burned alone. There were times when he was sure that he saw the same fire in Sherlock's mercurial eyes, saw some spark of shared desire. Sometimes when their eyes would find each other and the silence lingered a little too long the air would become heavy in his lungs, and his blood would buzz in his ears and he was certain that the fire would consume them both.  But something always broke the spell, cooled the moment, pulled them apart. John took another sip and watched Sherlock's frustration wane. He threw himself dramatically onto the sofa and kicked up his feet.
“Ordinarily your choice in partners is of no consequence to me. But this latest...consort of yours is unacceptable.”
“221b Baker St. I’ve got a nice little flat, in central London, with a spare bedroom if you’re interested.”
Sherlock slid into the back of the taxi oblivious to anything aside from the message he was frantically tying out to Lestrade.
“Nooooo!” John bellowed deep and angry and ran forward full tilt with no caution whatsoever and was stopped dead in his tracks as two bullets cut the air hitting him dead center mass, dropping him to the ground, in a flash leaving him with the thought “finally someone with a decent shot.” Pain bloomed across his chest, and a haze of black creeped into his field of vision.
Sherlock wanted to watch, wanted see the expression on John’s face catalog every nuance. But he couldn’t Stars are busting behind his eyelids and he raps out a repatriation of, “John oh God John John fuck yes John oh god yes.”
“Excuse me. What the hell do you mean untraceable? That’s impossible. We’re SAS. No one’s untraceable.”
Free ficlet of your choice to the first person to find the TJLC, reference. The updates I've recently made have been at the request of Death_Nonie. No. New content as yet, I just hope this makes reading a bit easier.
"Must we be so maudlin. Next question." There was a sparkle to Sherlock's clear eyes and John wasn't sure if it was tears or cognac.
Four days ago team Methos had been tracking this cell of Boko Haram in connection with a bombing that had taken place at a known tourist market when they where hit by a roadside bomb. The led humvee of John and Voltaire, had suffered the most damage. The second with Cardinal, Pope, and Bishop and all the medical supplies had faired much better with most of the team emerging with only minor injuries. Voltaire had not been as lucky.
Helloo. The Cold East Wind here. What follows is a text message conversation between John and Sherlock. Please let me know if it is confusing or should be written somehow differently. A thousand times thank you in advance.
“English, you fat fuck.” John advanced on the man with fist raised and punched him hard in the face. Once. Twice. The mans head snapped back violently, and blood poured into his mouth, John followed it with a powerful elbow to the temple, a solid left to the solar plexus and a vicious kick that splintered the Russian’s leg and left him a cripple, on the floor and screaming.
"Honestly? It's simply the bloodhound in me. I *know* something's off about this whole game. There's more to it then a group of college kids having a laugh. And as my BFF you'll just have to trust me." Sherlock winked at her and huffed as he waited for her to sit upright and passed her her tea.
“I love you.” John was well aware that his declarations of love may not be returned, but he couldn’t care less. *He* loved Sherlock, with a certainty and clarity that was perfect in his eyes. “Don’t say a word.  I know, it’s mad. I’m mad. Just...be...and let me be near you. “ They kissed in between words and touch and so much more, content to be lost in a world that was all their own.
Helloo. The Cold East Wind here. I don't even have a good excuse for why this chapter took so long. Apologies. Oh, watch for falling smut.(There's smut ahead)
John shut is laptop shoved it in his go bag and boarded the Chinook. Moran slipped on his headset and strapped in across the cabin from John.
John pressed his back against the doors ready to lay down cover fire as Voltaire went to work, but found that it was totally unnecessary. Each lab secured. God he loved his fuckin team.
“You know Irene, if I didn’t know better I’d say you got tangled up here in Pakistan just to get me on this side of the world.”
"I do. Thank you Elliot." Sherlock extended his hand, Elliot gave it a rueful look, and a firm shake.
“I’m not leaving here without him.” John leveled his eyes on Sherlock’s to gage his mental state. What he saw was the defiant spark of Sherlock’s eyes and a smug little half smile. Sherlock tilted his head ever so slightly to the left and raised an eyebrow.
-Funny how plans change. I’d intended to to see you out on that perfect little ass of yours, but now. Now I think I’d rather see the ruin of John Watson and watch you suffer for it.-
“Normally I would agree. It’s a description with a certain weight. But I’ve seen you work, and you’re quite good. No other word will do. So then how long?” Sherlock punctuated the words by trailing his fingers along the soft path of blond hair that ran from John’s navel all the way down...
Someone was playing with him. More importantly someone thought it a good idea to try and keep him from the man he was rapidly falling in love with. Someone had no sense of self preservation.
“What! Oh bloody hell I’ll enrich the uranium for them just to get out of here.” Sherlock huffed like a petulant child and threw himself into a nearby chair.
The next round of flyers was found the following morning. Taped to doors in the night, with no more then twenty recipients. Time and location remained the same. Sherlock had kept track of the last players to see if anything unusual happened to any of them. It had. James Harper, suddenly went back to America.
Sherlock woak slowly to the gray London morning his head pounded and his nose was sore. But most disappointing of all was the absence of his new doctor. He had enjoyed John Watson's company. The thought made him smile. Sherlock slid out of bed and resigned to get ready for his day.  Once showered and dressed he took one last look at his battered face in the mirror and sighed. He was purple and bruised there was nothing for it. Oh well. He didn't give a damn what people thought anyway.  Sherlock stepped out his building and was greeted by a one Miss Irene Adler. Shit.
"John this man, this butcher, he creeps in under cover of darkness, drugs his victims while they sleep and then dissects them while their still alive." Sherlock was on the verge of tears, the image of these thing happening to John clear in his mind.
"Stupid, stupid!" Sherlock admonished himself loudly with his eyes closed tightly and his teeth clenched. He opened his eyes and glared hatefully at his surroundings stalking around the confines of the cabin.
"More John, oh please God John, more. Yes.yes!" Sherlock brought his knees up level with John's shoulders, reached down and splayed his hands on John's bottom, gripping, grinding, feeling John's muscles work at a feverish pace.
John squeezed his eyes tight and pinched the bridge of his nose. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck! He really shouldn’t be this deep this fast on nearly nothing but Sherlock Holmes was everything lighting in a bottle wished it was. And John was hopelessly in love with every elusive powerful and brilliant bit of the man. And now John knew that Sherlock didn’t feel the same, all his beautiful stumbling over his words had made that much clear.
"So you're just going to walk out on him on your wedding day?" John's voice now held an edge to it that seemed to bring home Elliot's point in a nutshell.
John looked at the clock above the bar for the bezillonth time and  went back to watching his teammates enjoying their win, drunk laughing and singing and wished he were somewhere else. With someone else. With Sherlock. After talking with Irene it had been hard to come to the pub and celebrate, yet as team captain he had a duty to his mates, and so he sat. But some how every thought led back to the gorgeous young man and how much John wanted to simply be with him. In his presence. This thing between them it felt like...madness. To think of Sherlock made John's heart ache in the most beautiful way. It felt like...oh God. Oh fuck.
“I’ll be there to pick it up tomorrow.” John payed and winked at the lovely dark haired young man at the register on his way out.
"Why bees?" Was a rhetorical question that silently tumbled out of Sherlock's lips. "Lestrade." He turned his head to the lead inspector, who snapped his attention from the body to the squatting detective. "Can you run a background check on any beekeepers in the relative vicinity of the two crime scenes?"
"Mr. Sherlock. The case was deemed self-defense." She brushed strands of hair that fell onto her face and tucked it behind her ear, in a soft motion, glancing at Sherlock, who only hummed in acknowledgment.
"You pulled the strings because you need me," Sherlock mumbled out, a was a conversation they had during similar cases to this. This created a situation where Sherlock didn't care much to answer (if there even is a time he did truly care)
“Ugh, Alright let’s get going. You’re hailing the cab.” I muttered out slightly annoyed but comforted by the thought of sitting on the couch with a nice hot cup of tea as I continued to read over the newspaper I never had time to finish.
"Another case already boys?" Her voice was a comfort to hear, but her voice held a tone that was a bit distraught.
"I have an R," I mumbled out not so soon after him, glancing up at Sherlock to see if he had found anything as well to help complete the puzzle where all the pieces were askew.
"Spit it out," I piped in, wanting to be caught up in what Sherlock had already gathered on the wound of the victim.
He then reaches out and softly clasped around the scarf from my hand. Pulling it out before flipping it around his neck, the purple a blur as it swung rapidly reaching the other side of his neck to his awaiting hand. Pulling it fully around he loops it into a knot, securing the fluffy scarf around his neck. While he was busy I gave my hand a slight run through my grayish blonde hair, feeling it move across my sculpt as I try to predict how my hair was without having a mirror to glance into. Before I had even finished combing my hair down as best as possible he had already opened up the door. His coat flowed behind him as he quickly starting running down the stairs. I could hear his dark black shoes thumping against the wood as he made his way down the flight of stairs. I followed quickly behind, reaching the bottom of the stairs a split second before Mrs. Hudson (who is not our housekeeper) walked in through the door.
His eyes flicked across the paper in almost complete silence. His pale blue eyes blank, and his facial expressions neutral giving away nothing to as to what he was reading as he skimmed across the coroner's report. He cracked his right hand out through the air, shoving the report in Lestrade's face without glancing up from the pictures that were now in view. I strolled my way over to Sherlock, tempted to see the crime scene within his hands. I walked behind him, standing on the top of my toes, glancing over Sherlock's shoulder as he shuffled through the photos.
"Well, Ms. Bull. Striking evidence has come up to prove that the killing of your husband may not have been in self-defense." He turned his sharp blue gaze back to the mantel, his eyes still searching for something within the photos in oak made frames.
"Aren't you glad? This could clear your husband's name." I tried to hold back my slight anger and suspicion, I mean, who wouldn't want the chance to help clear your significant other's name? Despite how long it has been since the trial, but I knew it could just be from nerves as well, and I tried to keep that in mind.
"I see you got my text." Sherlock hadn't even turned his head, but everyone knew he had acknowledged Lestrade nonetheless, who was standing to the left side black plastic-wrapped body, which was resting on top of the silver-colored metal. His arms were crossed as he lifted up one grey eyebrows in a questioning look, that had made him seem even more annoyed than previously despite the fact he clearly wanted to hear the questions and answers tumbling around in Sherlock's mind.
That's how I got into this scenario, drinking Sherlocks cold tea as he wouldn't allow me to get up in order for me to make a new hot cup of tea. This had been going on for almost three hours, three hours was enough for me to get sick and tired of this behavior, his constant stare upon the ceiling. I had my limits, and I just met mine. I found myself pushing me out of the chair with surprising speed. Lifting my pointer finger out just as quickly to give a sharp point towards Sherlock, as he too shot up into a sitting position, his feet still laid out across the couch.
Sherlock stared down at his phone as he grunted out the next address of the next potential suspect to the taxi driver that seemed just as annoyed as Sherlock was. This was going to be the third beekeeper we've seen, all previous ones leading us to a dead-end of this ongoing mystery.
"This transition is going to be hard to write on my blog," I grumbled out. Despite this new breakthrough in this case. I also understood that this was one to blog about. I knew writing a blog would be difficult but I didn't expect it to be this annoying.
I found myself rolling my eyes as Sherlock jumped over towards Molly giving a silent handwave as a signal for Molly to close up the bag back up. Molly had quickly gone to work as Sherlock started speed walking in the door. Only Sherlock could find murder fun. Well, that and me. I found a deep chuckle rising out of my chest as Sherlock turned around from the door shouting out.
"Interesting, " I hummed in response to the statement. Keeping my newspaper standing straight despite holding it with one hand in order to take a sip of the freshly made tea. We had just gotten home and Sherlock removed his coat, loosely hanging it on the rack before instantly moving over to his signature couch plopping himself down upon it as he got right to his reading 'Kylen Lancaster' file trying to find any potential evidence to figure out who our potential killer may be. "It says here he was on trial for the murder of Maxwell Bull." I found my head popping up from the London Central newspaper that I was formerly engrossed in.
"I mean." She snapped her body around to face me, clearly forgetting that I was also within the room until I broke the silence. Her eyes widen as she looked directly into my slightly squinted eyes, clearly feeling anxious about something. "Yes, I just." She paused pulling her bottom lip beneath her teeth. "Don't want to go through the whole process again."
“What makes you think that dear Watson?” I almost choked on my tea from the surprise of my theory not being turned down outright, I ended coughing multiple times to clear my throat as I rubbed my watery eyes all while under the scrutiny of Sherlock who was staring at me as if I was an idiot. Before I was able to get the explanation to leave my mouth,
"Good point." Sherlock rolled out. "But still highly unlikely, so, irrelevant." He turned his gaze back to the window but a small quirk of his lip helped bring a comfortable silence back over the car ride.
“It’s quite obvious John I'm trying to solve the case, he clearly has some anger issues, Which fits with the profile of our killer.” I wasn’t even aware that I really thought of doing the action until I felt my hand come in contact with Sherlock’s cheek.
"Well…" I breathed out seeing the cloud of cold white form in front of my face "Here we are." I raised my ungloved hand (a mistake on my part) to give two knocks on the dark wooden door, the sound reverberating against the surprisingly empty streets of London, sending pain right up my cold stinging hand.
"If you wanted me to do what I want whenever I want. You could've just asked. I'm always willing to follow." He gave me a smirk like he was the smartest person to ever exist. I rolled my eyes at his behavior as I lifted up my other hand to point a finger directly at his face.
"Another murder?" I struggled to turn my body around wincing when I pulled too much on my muscles but was able to soon turn so that my whole body was facing Sherlock. "How…" I paused slightly, pulling my bottom lip beneath my teeth, thinking of what to say. "Do you think it's the same guy?" Without being able to see my own expression I could tell it was one of desperation, an exact carbon copy of the emotions bubbling within my mind.
I felt a chuckle flow out of my mouth in response, smirking as Sherlock turned around to face me, his eyes fuming that you could practically see the smoke flowing out of his ears, and the lighting of the flame in his eyes.
That's the end, this chapter is sorta a bit of filler, to help bring context to the story to help you solve the case right beside them. Sorry if it's not up to par with the first chapter. I promise it gets better.
"I… well yes. That does happen." I stammered out, I wasn't quite sure how to respond, I never had to think hard on a subject like this before. We never delved this deep into a conversation like this. We never,  I found my eyebrows pulling together as my eyes glanced off to the side, glazed over. I found my voice becoming stronger as a working suspicion clouded up within me. "Why are you mentioning this all of a sudden?"
"Do you think a beekeeper is behind these murders?" Lestrade questioned pushing himself up from the tree that he had been previously leaning up against.
I saw Sherlock, the man who had just spewed out who the murder was, smile. He quickly snapped back around, his coat snapping in the wind as he turned towards the body. Dropping to the ground balancing on the top of his toes, his actions almost deafening silence. He lifts up his gloved hand, the black leather gloves thick as he pulls on the suit of the dead man lying on the ground. The dark black and blue bruises are now more noticeable with the fabric pulled back. He tilts his head back to Lestrade.
"You know, you shouldn't just barge in there," I mentioned, changing the subject as I looked forward, seeing Sherlock pause as he tilted back his head to glance at me. He rose his eyebrows a silent expression that spoke 'watch me' as he snapped his way back forward, a dramatic flap of his coat as he pushed his way into Lestrade's office.
“Look I.” He paused as if he was residing if this was the correct route or not, a wise decision on his part. “I’m sorry. What did I do wrong.”
His feet wherein the air he lifted himself off the ground leaping up and down in the air. Wildly bouncing his arms up and down as a silent chant   'yes' rumbled out of his mouth. He jogged towards me, his coat following close behind as he latched his hands upon my shoulders in a tight embrace. "This is going to be a fun case indeed."
I felt something heavy hit my nose, confused I lifted up my hand from where it was resting in my warm coat pocket. Putting it on my nose only to pull it back to see it was slightly wet, I rubbed my forefinger and thumb together to get rid of the moisture. I turned my head to look at him, he was already starting back, we nodded our heads at the same time in understanding. He held out his gloved hand in an invitation, I moved my hand slowly to put my hand into his gloved one. Our fingers curling together as we started our journey back to the city.
“I mean... I would always choose my wife over my bees, others, I don’t know anyone well enough to remove my only source of income to please them.” Turner turned his head away from the icy eyes of Sherlock’s almost as if he was ashamed of his answer.
"Why do you think?" His voice came out like a snarky snort, being annoyed at having to explain at least to him was 'obvious'. "To avoid suspicion." His tone spoke of an eye roll despite not actually rolling his eyes. "If you stand in the crowd, trying to figure out what happened, you seem less suspicious." He rolled his eyes, believing this 'uninteresting' case was dragging on for far too long. Believing that staying here was a useless waste of time, I could sense this, and in order to defuse this situation, I used what was every genius's weakness was. Recognition.
"It's such a short transition between one part to another, almost seems insignificant, except it holds an important part." A scowl found its way across my face my eyes squinting as I tried, and failed, to think of a solution.
"John." He had now turned his head to look at me, his eyes having a questioning look in them, a question yet to be solved.
"Yes, It appears so." Sherlock snapped his spine straight, moving almost seamlessly to the other side of the table, where Molly quickly moved out of the way of his flowing coat. I followed quickly behind him, giving Molly a quick wave of my hand as an apology before finding my way besides Sherlock. He wrapped his hand around the hand, picking it up, and studying using the same treatment as the other.
“Just go.” Was the soft defeated voice that left the man’s mouth as he turned his head away from the door, while I turned my body to walk out. “He already succeeded.”
"Thanks." I murmured out, for Sherlock to which Lestrade answered with a nod of his own. I quickly turned around giving another quick 'thanks' as I closed the door behind me. Jogging in order to catch up with Sherlock who was almost all the way down the hall already.
I watched as a big grin found its way onto his face once again. He used his hands to push himself off the couch, his eyes glinting as he walked his way over me, walking over the table like it wasn't even there as he stood right in front of me. With a big grin on his face, he put his hands on my shoulders as he mumbled.
"Now, who appears to have chipped nails, and pink nail polish that appears to be peeling off?" His face pulled into a smile knowing that he had enough evidence to arrest the person in question. "The blonde highlighted brunette in the crowd out there."
Before the whole body had even been uncovered, you could see all the inflamed red circles littered around his entire face, facial expressions almost unrecognizable. His eyes seemed to be sewn shut with inflammation, his light brown hair messy and curled falling down into a sideburn on his face, the light stubble littering across his chin and neck, his body unrealistically large due to all the tiny pricks that had found their way into them. Once the whole body was uncovered, Sherlock instantly brought out his pocket-sized magnifying glass, sliding it open.
"Indeed it is my dear Watson." He looked up at me, giving me a confident smirk at my 'caught off guard' expression, one of which found its way to become a snarl as Sherlock turned his head back down. I turned my head away as well.
"221B Baker Street." The words poured through his lips in a careless manner. I watched as his blank face turned into a grim expression as he turned to look directly at me.
He soothed fears and instilled confidence as he went. John moved from one wounded soldier to the next. And then the next, and then the next. Sweat, blood and sand marked his brow. Seven wounded and two dead with no end to the fighting in sight.
"I don't need help, I need John." It seemed like the other man was about to get the better of him when Sherlock decided it was time to end this he gathered himself and punched the younger man in the nose, breaking free and running for John.
"What are you on about?" Irene sat, took a drink from her flask and passed it to Sherlock who took it without question.
"John." Sherlock said his name like a gift. He turned on Lestrade, practically manic. "When did this arrive?"
Sherlock’s strides carried him quickly toward his destination. All the while his mind raced with a bevy of possible scenarios for the evening, he was keyed up and ready for the game to begin.  So running smack into John Watson at the far end of the covered walk had been nowhere on Sherlock’s rader.
"Really John? This is our starting point." Sherlock rolled his eyes and let his head fall back exasperated.
After hearing this news Sherlock wasn't going to wait another second. He pushed pass the doctor and headed for recovery. Lestrade followed knowing he would have to explain the whirlwind that was Sherlock Holmes as he passed. Sherlock opened the door slowly and was pleasantly surprised by what he saw. John was peaceful, his color was normal and he was breathing on his own, making small sounds that Sherlock couldn't make out from across the room. Sherlock closed the distance and rested a hand on Johns bicep leaning in to hear the whispered words.
When Sherlock pulled himself up out of the resivor it was to a crowd of police and EMTs, but the only person Sherlock saw was John, the rest was just noise. John Watson, scanning the crowd with anxious worried eyes, that fell on Sherlock the second he was clear of the entrance. Sherlock smiled wide at the sight of John, knowing that he was safe, happy in that knowledge he collapsed into a hep on the ground, not unconscious, just exhausted. And then John was there on the ground with him. Right there, holding his face gently in both hands speaking words that Sherlock never thought anyone would be saying to him, let alone a man as good as John. Those deep ocean blue eyes where worth every bit of every single thing Sherlock had been through or would go through in this life. And then there was the voice. Johns voice had always made Sherlock think of hot tea, strong not too over powering with a hit of sweet.
Finsbury Park, or Hornsey Wood Reservoir was a gargantuan labyrinth of stunning brick archways and after ten minutes of silent wondering Sherlock found what he was looking for. A long wooden table covered from one end to the other in bright shining metal. Knifes. Curved ones, serrated ones, straight ones, and long ones just like the one the killer had left stuck in John.
"They're grown men now. So yes I can. All I need is names." John was all seriousness as he looked at Sherlock over the rim of his raised glass.
Helloo. The Cold East Wind here. This chapter that you’ve all waited so long for is very short. For that I am sorry. But I can only write what our boys give me. This felt like a fitting end to a long ride. I do hope you’ve enjoyed it. A thousand times thank you for reading in advance.
"God save us from Cluedo!" John took a seat on the floor with his back leaned against one of the two leather chairs. They stood on either side of the sofa which was facing a fireplace almost large enough for John to stand up in. He kicked off his shoes, sat the bottle of scotch off to the side and let his head tilt back and to the side so he was facing Sherlock. "We could..." John rolled his hear side to side. "Oh, I know! We could play 20 questions."
"Well I was merely concerned after his well being, I've heard of a couple of fags getting ruffed up recently and naturally my thoughts turned to him."
"Why must you always think the worst of me? But no in answer to your question. Nothing so dramatic.” Thomas had shut the door and was now leaning against it.
“You do just that then. As I’m certain that you’ve already run to your uncle on John’s behalf. I came to hear you say the words, to admit to me that you did all this as a way to get rid of all the people that you deam unfit, unworthy, or some how wrong. But know this Thomas, you are one of us. You are the very thing you loath, and your propositioning me only proves it further.”
"It's Greg." John was bone tired and only wanted to turn back into Sherlock's curls and sleep. Well maybe a quick shag and then sleep. At that moment as if he'd read Johns thoughts as usual, Sherlock pressed his lean frame against the length of Johns side, rolling his hips suggestively sending a jolt through Johns whole body that came to rest firmly in his cock.
"Ruskin Park is an eerie place at the best of times, without all the clandestine trappings."  Irene said from her desktop perch.
“I’m fine. I just need a reset.” John could hear Mercy starting to slip into sister mode and loved his twin all the more for it.
"Yes." Again, there was no space between ask and answer. Silent tears rolled over classic cheekbones.
Sherlock shivered but didn’t let this chilly exposure keep him from his own goal of working John’s fly open and pressing their heat together.
“The...The sun. Yes. The sun is wrong. It’s wrong...it’s all....just. It’s not...not right John. Without...”
Moriarty paced the aisle between the leather chairs of his private jet clearly agitated. That’s why Sebastian hadn’t said a word since the Maryborough. An agitated Jim was a dangerous Jim, and there wasn’t enough room on this jet for one of their fights.
“Fuck all Sherlock!” John burst around a corner. “This is the second time I’ve nearly shot you...what...what’s wrong?” John was frozen by cold terror and some unfamiliar fear rooting him to the floor.
Once they entered John’s rooms he took out his mobile and placed a call. Sherlock ambled around taking off his jacket and pouring himself a drink. John’s eyes were on him the whole time and he knew it so he embellished his gestures a bit. Removing his jacket with his back to John so that the silhouette of his frame and his bottom would show to advantage, trailing his elegant fingers lightly over the liquor decanters as he made his choice, raking his fingers through his curls and rubbing the back of his neck. Small things but incredibly powerful.
"I was never supposed to know that you loved me as much as I loved you?" John was confused and hurt."Why?"
"J, you shouldn't be the one on the ground on this. You're too recognizable. You should send one of us in."
"No. But you are most certainly a drama queen. If not you wouldn't have sent me this letter and your wedding invitation together. You wanted me here, in Northumberland (which also did not go unnoticed) you wanted me to stop this wedding didn't you?"
“Look, I have a...a...ahh...very dangerous experiment in the kitchen that could go  off at any second.” John’s eyes went wide in fake shock looking around the kitchen for said experiment. Sherlock didn’t know if he wanted to laugh cry or scream in Lestrade’s face.
Time stopped. Sherlock could see every partial of dust and hear the blood in his vains, he could have sworn he felt the second his heart broke. “Who?”
"Oh John don't be silly, I am happy. I have you." The words where meant to sound causal and lighthearted. But to John they were profound. To John they meant that everything he wanted for Sherlock was right there in him. His mind spun with possibly.  John chose his next question with care.
"Yes he is. A grown man with limited knowledge in relationships who lost his virginity to a prick who publicly shamed him as a lying fagot."
Stupid, stupid! Sherlock dug both hands into his curls and balled his fist. What had he done? Had John misunderstood and thought Sherlock didn’t want them to be together? Or had he understood and been put off by the thought of them together? Oh who the hell knew? What Sherlock did know was that somehow he had to find a way to try to make things right between he and John.
Lestrade took the steps two at a time to the third floor of the building where the bodies had been found arranged around a board room table as if in a meeting.
Sherlock wouldn't say so but he knew that Irene was right. Caution maybe necessary.  "What was his message?"
John shut the door quietly, trying not the wake the sleeping beauty he had just kissed goodbye. He turned with a broad smile across his face and slammed right into Irene.
"Oh God Sherlock. " John was panting, and now he did fist his hand in the dark curls. He tugged Sherlock's head gently. John hesitated, and rubbed the stubble of the day against Sherlock's smoother cheek.
Helloo. The Cold East Wind here. A thing or two before we rejoin our boys. Below is some information about Boko Haram, it’s good to know ones enemy. Also I mention two songs. The first is instrumental, so there’s no real need to listen to it other then it’s beautiful. The second is “Make it to me” by: Sam Smith. This one, well I guess you can learn it’s meaning right along with John.
"Got it?" Despite everything, detective Lestrade knew his job and knew how to do it well. Knew the ups and downs of the laws of law enforcers, laws Sherlock didn't care to follow, and for the most part, ignored. If detective Lestrade was going to allow the man in front of his access to these case files, he was going to be darn sure that Sherlock wasn't going to mess this up for him.
"Right. You're mad at me. I'll stay quiet." He mumbled out, his lips still against my hand before he slowly pulled away. His hand sliding slowly across my palm, from beneath mine as he backed up from me. Allowing me to have my space to do my own thing.
Sherlock didn't speak as he moved up from the dead guy's shoulders to push around the individual hairs on the top of his skull. I saw him straighten up, his eyes calculating each possibility of what was possible. His eyes all of a sudden shined with knowledge as he figured out the answer speaking it out in a  dark rumble left his mouth in a sound that helped everyone understand the power of the words spoken.
Also you'll notice that Sherlock isn't using his mind palace in a situation that would seem perfect for it. Well that's because he doesn't have one yet. He is only 21, and still learning what his brilliant mind is capable of. He's building rooms. But will soon begin to put those rooms together in one glorious place. Now let's go...we're about to be late for class!
“And why would you choose me over a life you’ve planned for yourself. I’m just some...I don’t know. Momentary distraction.”
"John I'm sorry. He's left. He's scared to death. He just needs time to think." Even as Irene said the words she knew that that was the last thing Sherlock needed to do. Given time he would rationalize a million different bullshit reasons to run away. "Sod this. Talk to him. He's a fool John and he's scared."
He took it. “Hello you’re self Sgt.” John knew who she was. He knew Sherlock wasn’t a fan. He wanted to find out why.
"Don't be idiotic Thomas, you know I am neither blind nor dumb, you're just angry that I of all people caught you and Paul is it? In a position that you would much rather your mates never find out about. You really should aim to be more creative in your insults, or at the very lest accurate..."
Sherlock stepped into the shadows of the alley right behind a very unsuspecting man who was too intent on creeping up on someone else to notice Sherlock creeping up on him. Sherlock swift and silent wrapped his arm around the mans neck affectively cutting off the man’s air supply and the would be assailant slipped into unconsciousness. Sherlock dropped him to the ground with the rest.
"I'll get the assets, you lay ground cover." Moran hefted Sherlock up on to his shoulder. John gave a curt nod knowing that it was the right call even if it didn't sit well with him. They made for the first cell, there Moran grabbed the small man and practically drug him by the coller up the steps. They ran to the waiting Chinook in the clearing with John at the ready to lay down cover fire.
“But it could be.” John leaned in and placed two fingers under Sherlock’s chin. “Now, shut that pretty mouth of yours and let’s get to work yeah.” John let his hand slid to the back of Sherlock’s neck and smoothly pulled him forward to pressed a lingering kiss to said pretty mouth and then just as smoothly departed the Land Rover, L9A1 in hand, L96A1 across his chest, 9mm in his shoulder holster.
"I don't give a damn what you tell him, but you sure as hell can't leave him in the dark like this! It's cruel even for you!"  Irene knew she was being harsh, but she was fighting for (as much as she hated to say it) love. "This dose not involve just you Sherlock! John should get to decide what's most important to him!"
"So you two had a thing?" John handed a cup to him. Sherlock wasn't usually this chatty but he'd come this far in the telling of things so there was really no need to stop now.
"You may need more than names. You may need a snowplow and a helicopter. Or have you forgotten where we are?" Sherlock took a sip, chuckled and ran a hand through his curls, something he rarely did and John couldn't help but wish it was his fingers tangled in the lush blackness.
"Fine. Well...ok. So. In light of new developments I guess it's an unfair question. Admirable then."
Sherlock shuttered and tighten his hold on John’s rigid muscles, Sherlock didn’t need to stroke his own cock, presse between his and John’s belly the friction of each deliciously powerful thrust pushed Sherlock closer to the tipping point. John could feel Sherlock’s every muscle.
"Exactly. How is he supposed to defend his medical prowess in his absence if not for me?" Sherlock looked doe eyed and innocent.
"No, no not this. You're here now." Johns speech held just a hint of a slur, so slight no one else would have noticed. Sherlock noticed. This was not his John. "I don't want to do this, this is a cruel game. Should have known this was coming though, now I'm a complete nutter."
“Do you have it?” Sherlock watched out the window as John jogged across the street heading to pickup takeaway.
"Yes John I know! We should have left yesterday. I shouldn't have gone back to look at the body again. I should have seen it the first time." Sherlock whirled about as he spoke unconsciously trying to relieve some of his angry tension.
Sherlock arched against John’s frantic pounding release hot and sudden within forcing Sherlock’s eruption his own stream of endless white ribbons shot over his shoulder into the canopy of leaves behind him. They silenced the jungle around them with gruff praise and shouts. They lay still joined together and let the breeze cool their hot flesh. John with his fingers tangled in silk as usual and Sherlock kissing any of John within reach.  Sherlock pushed himself up on John’s chest and smiled down at him peppering his face with yet more kisses.
Sherlock smirked at the slight stiffening of the soldiers back. He’d only laid eyes on his savior briefly, but sparks were quick like that weren’t they? Burning out forgotten in seconds, with  no danger whatsoever, or igniting an uncontrollable blaze. Sherlock wanted to throw himself into the flames.
"What you mean to say is that I'm too feeble to stand in one spot and hold a cocktail because that's essentially what I’ll be doing." Sherlock bothered his cuff.
“I’ll handle it.” John was unfocused and more then a little dazed as if he’d suffered an actual physical blow. What the fuck was happening? He had to get his head around this right fuckin now, the opt ahead was a dangerous one, and he needed to be on point. Fuck if Sherlock Holmes was going to put him off his game. If he wanted it to be...what over? Then so be it. It’s over. Right?The thought stabbed his heart, behind his eyes, in his gut. John rubbed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose. Fuck! What the fuck. Why? Why? Why? The question filled John’s head in a cacophony of pain pushing away everything else. Fuck this! John was not some fresh faced school boy who'd never been kissed. What he was was a grown ass man who had NEVER been dumped in this life. And now was not the time for this absolute bullshit! FUCK!
“The pretty one, yes.” Sebastian would like nothing more at the moment then to skin “the pretty one” alive if it made his Jim happy.
"Thomas Shipton, is a basterd and a fool. Now get some rest Sherlock Holmes, and I'll come look in on you tomorrow."
“Fuck me John and see how real I am.” Sherlock’s voice was strained with that lust yet still full of the cocky defiance that John loved.
“Yes you are,” John was fairly certain Sherlock had stomped his foot. “especially since you’re making us go to this foolishness.” Sherlock sulked settling his chin on John’s right shoulder.
“Paris is for lovers J.” Moran held a cigarette between his pearly white teeth hand shoved deep into the pockets of his leather bomber jacket. "Did you have something in mind?” The words were delivered with Sebastian’s signature sly smile.
“Hello Mr. Holmes.” John stood at attention under the stern appraisal. How are you feeling?” No response, just a deeper furrow to an already furrowed brow. “You must be starving.”
“And not be board.” Sherlock interjected. “Mercy, convinced you to join her at MI5, then MI6, because she knew surgery would never be enough for you. Thrilling enough for both sides of who you are. She knows you well. From there the two of you became what you are today. Judgment (nothing so pedestrian as justice) and Mercy. She is your sister.”
"Shut it while I think of my first question." John closed his eyes, trying to think of all the things he had always wanted to know about Sherlock Holmes. 20 questions wasn't going to be enough he mused.
First I mush apologize for the long absence. Life will out. Anywho, when last we saw our boys they had just enjoyed their first night together and we are waiting to see exactly what's in store with the invitation only truth or dare...is Sherlock right? Is there more to the game then innocent fun? Or is our budding detective wrong? And how was the morning after? Let's see.
"John!" Sherlock didn't have much fight in him at the moment but what he had  he was going to use to reach John. "Get out of my way! I need to go with him. John!" Sherlock was beginning to get angry, and started a shoving match albeit a weak one with the constable.
"Not too scared, he just seems...standoffish, more of a challenge then my average pursuits." They both stretched in place as they talked.
He wanted to walk away. But it was no use. John Watson was made to love Sherlock Holmes not the good not the bad but the man in all his perfections and frailties.
"Move! You great bloody git!" John shoved Sherlock aside. And thank god that's when Scotland Yard arrived.
“Alright. I had a bunk mate in Uni, his name was Victor Tevor, I thought he was important to me, turns out he wasn’t.”
When Sherlock blinked his eyes open painfully and slowly he could just make out Thomas walking far off across the campus lawn. So he deduce that he hadn't been out very long, and tried to stand. His head screamed with pain and his legs were wobbly. Fighting down the urge to vomit, Sherlock braced himself on the wall and started his trek back to his room. The blood from his nose had dried and he could feel a lump just above his right eye. He knew he must have looked a mass and was glad for the lack of people he encountered. But as fate would have it Sherlock did manage to cross paths with just one person on this struggle home. John Watson. Sherlock could see his building less then a block away he pulled out his keys and kept his focus on his goal. Clutching his coat and scarf tight at the neck and keeping one hand free for balance, he didn't notice the young man run up beside him and clap him on the shoulder until he was nearly knocked to the ground from the force.
“Oh. Hell no. You thought I meant with you? No.” Sally’s mouth dropped open and her eyes began to narrow. “Cause you see that freak over there,” John gestured to Sherlock with a glass in hand. “I plan on letting him fuck me speechless later and I have a feeling you’d just be in the way.”
"There indeed." John raised his glass and offered to refill Sherlock's. He tilted his head in thanks and accepted.
This was skirting far too close to topics Sherlock didn’t want John to know about. Not yet anyway. He wasn’t ready for John to see him in that light. Diminished. No longer the moon of his life, but the common junkie he allowed himself to become.
”You told me he was fine.” Moriarty and the rest watched a woefully thin Sherlock make his way to the far corner and take a seat. "You call that fine?"
“At first...I assumed Cardinal, was your lover. She fits your type. Then perhaps an ex. Until I saw that she wasn’t. You and she are close, comfortable even with no lingering malice no undercurrent of longing or resentment. So friends.”
“I’ll agree, I have my moments.” Sherlock’s voice pitched low and John could feel the deep resonance of Sherlock’s words in his very bones. The hunger that never strayed far, began to uncoil low and smoldering in John.
"No shit Sherlock. I was wondering about the details, why the jury declared it as self-defense." I replied in a snarky tone, lying through my teeth as I really hadn't considered the self-defense root, but I wasn't about to let myself lose this round.
"So they wrote of Killer on the body?" Lestrade was the first one to speak up from the silence, his head tilting up to glance at Sherlock across the table. His tone was slightly questioning as if he was trying to see if there was another way to see this scenario.
"Well, no. It's in our nature to seek close connections with people, even in certain scenarios, it helps put pressure on you that could result in you getting to the answer quicker." I gave a soft nod at the end. My mind feeling authoritative on my feelings. Believing I had good evidence to support human interaction having benefits to people and society as a whole.
I forced myself to ignore the body hanging below and glanced up from where the corpse was hanging from the tree. My eyes squinting trying to figure out what was carved deeply within the tree above his head. A ragged S shape was carved into a tree with some sort of blunt object of which I could only assume was a knife. I stole a confused glance towards Sherlock who happened to glance at me at the same time. He snapped his head back to the body whipping his hand out, pressing it up against my chest until I started walking backward, Sherlock followed me on this adventure as we backed up and more trees came into view. That's when the note that Sherlock mentioned to me came into view, carved into the trees.
"Who's calling me? I'm busy." He growled out at the phone before his face lit up in confusion recognition. "It's Lestrade." He turned to look at me, and with my nod of approval, he answered the phone.
“Yes, that thing.” Sherlock spits out that as if it was a poisoned word that he needed to spit out in order to survive, his hatred of that hat seeping into his voice. I continued to give my friendly smile, even as I was holding back the urge to tease Sherlock further.
“I don’t know then.” I tilted my head down to reopen the newspaper back to the original page, expecting the conversation to be over. Instead, I heard a ruffle of fabric and when I looked up I saw Sherlock had turned toward me and staring at me with expectant eyes.
"You didn't think of it?" He laughed again, out of slight frustration waving his arms slightly once again before looking back down at the files, flipping through each one mumbling under his breath. 'Look what I have to deal with' I saw Sherlock's whole body tighten and his eyes fume, lifting up a foot in order to talk a step forward. An action that was blocked by my arm that had been moved from my side to go across his body. He turned his head to face me, his expression a confused angry, as his eyes kept snapping from me back to Lestrade. While giving me another short glance I shook my head no, causing him to slump slightly and eyes to turned into a sad, upset expression, but made no argument against it.
I felt the page crinkle beneath my grip, as my licked wet finger, pushed itself between the pages, pulling them apart and opening up the world of the newspaper. I was glancing at the titles of the stories of London, trying to figure out what this place had in store for us today. I couldn't control my soft laugh that escapes as a headline caught my attention. One that very well might be an adventure to go on in order to solve. I bit my bottom lip holding back my smile.
He had turned his head away, after that, his eyes pulling together as he thought upon the subject. "Yes, it appears so." His head shifted down to look at his legs, his hand resting on my back felt like it got ten pounds heavier with the weight of the words spoken.
"Woah! Sherlock." Lestrade jumped up from his seat slightly before settling back down, removing his hand from his belt where the gun was held. "You can't just barge in like that." Lestrade barked out, doing wild hand gestures before pointing directly at Sherlock before bringing it up to his face to rub his forefinger and thumb in a soothing manner in between his eyes. He sighed once he realized Sherlock wasn't going to speak up, preferring to wait for Lestrade to speak first, mainly to annoy the other detective. "What are you even doing here in the first place? What's so bloody important you have to barge in like this?" He spits out in slight annoyance, his eyes squinted into a slight glare. Sherlock had ignored this as he walked straight up to Lestrade's desk, sticking his hand out in a demanding gesture.
"K, LL," I spoke out more to myself than anyone else. "Why a K and an LL? That doesn't make much sense." I found myself closing my eyes and taking a deep breath. Trying to make the images form in my mind, moving through and discarding alternatives. It couldn't be morse code, these are fresh so it couldn't be from some sort of organization that had veered its ugly head against him. That's when an idea hit me, something that had the potential to be valid.
“I have an idea, we can go home, you can make yourself a cup of tea and read the newspaper, or watch bad telly. Whatever you want.” I gave a confused glance towards Sherlock, half expecting this to be some sort of set up that I haven’t figured out yet.
"Stop it." The words were short and the tone was nothing short of his annoyance, but it had caused a giggle to fall out of my mouth anyway. "Do you know how long it takes me to tame this in the morning?" His words were a slight growl, but I could hear the slight smile in his tone as he managed to pull my hands out of his hair.
"Thiers an E here." Lestrade was the first one to speak, he had mumbled it out after getting the left shoe off the man. The cut was easy to spot as it wasn't surrounded by a bunch of bees stings as his shoes protected his feet.
"I need the records of the bee victim. Where his family lives, criminal records. Anything with possible use." Sherlock's voice was calm but firm as he stared right into Lestrade's eyes, his stance firm and straight, showing he wasn't going to back down until he got what he wants.
"Don't, just don't. I'm going to go in there." I pointed behind me to the kitchen, "make myself some tea. Maybe go for a walk." His eyes widened in response to an expression that read of sound similar to 'how could you do this to me' He spun himself around the couch so his feet now hit the ground, fully facing me in his purple shirt of 'sex'. "And you're not going to stop me." A scoff was the only word I could think of to describe the noise that had come out of my mouth as I stormed towards the kitchen.
"And how did you come to that conclusion." Detective Lestrade the captain of the police force spoke. His voice gruffer and more authoritative tone, though not quite questioning the man before him, more wondering how the man came to this conclusion.
"Ah, here it is." Lestrade paused his flicking, grabbing and pulling a file out of a stack of them. He closed his drawer with a harsh bump from his hip, ignoring locking it back for right now was he focused on reading the name of the file. "Mr. Kylen Lancaster" Lestrade spoke with a tone of a teacher giving a lecture walking over to Sherlock, plopping the file down in his open hand, not expecting a thank you in response. A quite correct assumption as Sherlock instantly turned around to walk out the door.
"What is that? Some sort of cult symbol?" Lestrade spoke up, his face contorting into one of confusion as he put his hand underneath his chin, his eyes downcasting to the floor. Not even a few seconds later he decided to join us to inspect the wounds inflicted on the victim. He found his way to the left of me, picking up the hand Sherlock had discarded, lifting it up and nodded his yes head as he came to the same conclusion as us.
"You better be lucky I expected you to say that." The paper made a slight drinking sound, as he pulled the white folded up papers out of his dark grey coat pocket. The papers were almost placed into Sherlock's outstretched hand, but they were snapped away at the last second, his brown gloved hand moving up to point a sharp finger at the man in question.
"Alright. Yes, we can leave now you pouty baby." I rolled my eyes as he huffed in disapproval at his new nickname. Despite that he had still shoved himself out of the chair, reaching for his coat upon the coat rack. A coat he shouldn't have even taken off in the first as he slid it around his shoulder. I already had my coat on, as I had never taken it off, set down the cup that was in my head, setting it on to coaster getting up to go to Sherlock who was now waiting by the door.
“The bees were a coincidence,” Sherlock whispered in a solid tone, his eyes gleaming a sense of adventure that was soon to come.”
"You coming? We have a murder to solve." I could tell that his eyes were gleaming brightly despite the fact he was halfway across the room. I shook my head side from side, starting to walk over to Sherlock.
“Did you move from the United States recently?” Sherlock questioned as he turned his head towards the couch in the middle of the room before plopping himself down on it like he owned the place, which metaphorically, he did.
I moved my attention, staring deeply into the blood-stained petals of the man's eyes which despite everything seemed to stare deeply into my soul with that blank flowery stare. My mind ran around with a multitude of theories, my head swimming with possible explanations as to why they chose to show off this murder in this particular fashion.
"Killer…" Another whisper had left my mouth, but this one was one of fear, the killer had told us something. Whether it was about the person they killed or the killer themselves. Either way, it was, the risk to do could help us catch them. So why take the time to carve in the words on the man's skin? What was so important that they felt as if they had to do it?
Sherlock growled something that seemed unreal based on the anatomy of human vocal cords, but he had managed to make every syllable of his words spoken with a rumbling growl. His head already snapped back towards me as the words I feared to hear come out of his mouth poured out.
"So where are we going?" The question hung in the air as he didn't answer, instead, he leaned forward in his seat to speak to the cabbie driver. My question was answered soon after when he gave the cabbie the address to the morgue where we had first met. And presumably where Molly had the man who was stung to death laying around. I could feel a smirk perk up my lips as I turned and looked at him. "I guess that answers my question." I out an airy laugh out turning my head to the side looking through the window as the cabbie put the car into drive and started on its journey to the morgue.
“So, would you say you prefer your bees over other humans.” Sherlock leaned forward and rested his elbows on his knees and held his head in his hands. A pose that made me realize this was a question that would determine if he would still be a suspect or not.
I could feel all my anger fade away, deep coiling of regret filling in my gut. I felt sick. I couldn't see it before now, but I could now. Sherlock was trying to push me away, he wanted me to leave him, but not because he saw me as a weakness. But because he couldn't see me killed by what he believes is his hands, he cared too much to allow that to happen. I felt my eyes close, by world turning into black as I  let out a soft exhale somehow feeling as if it was crystallizing in front of me. I opened them the world of somber colors as the world around me filed back into my senses. I had made my decision. I bit the inside of my cheek, my fingers twitching at my side, sensing what was about to come. My arm felt heavy as I reached it up, my hands just nearly hovering about his shoulder.
