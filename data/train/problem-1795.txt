John laid a towel over Sherlock’s shoulder and draped it over the newborn. She quieted little by little as her body heat rose from resting against her mother, insulated by the cloth. Her lower lip quivered as she let out little whimpers, the fractious movement of her arms and legs calming. John crowded at Sherlock’s side to gaze on their daughter.
Only when her cord was cut by John’s steady hand and once she was wrapped in a warm, soft towel did she quiet, resting on Sherlock’s aching chest and sleeping already. Close to her mother’s heart, hearing again its comfortable, reliable beat, she was lulled to sleep, unaware of the bustle of activity surrounding her arrival. Sherlock was reclined on a pile of pillows, recently delivered of an eight-pound, six-ounce infant and her accompanying placenta, sponge-bathed and exhausted and watching his daughter with rapt adoration.
They spent New Years' in each other's arms, bringing in the new year with John deep inside Sherlock. They spent Sherlock's birthday the same way, and many days following. Sherlock was starting to reach the point in his pregnancy where he needed his Alpha the most, and thankfully, his Alpha was more than happy to provide.
“Who’s in mummy’s tummy?” John asked, bouncing Cara on his hip. The baby giggled and put her hand over her mouth, looking at Sherlock’s stomach with concentration. “Come on, love, who’s in there? Who’s in mummy’s tummy?”
"Your little baby," John said, nodding and crawling up the bed to sit beside an exhausted Sherlock. "Your little baby girl."
John tutted and shook his head. “Just for that, you get a glass of milk to go with it,” he said, rising again and returning a moment later with a tall glass of milk, which he set beside the plate of cake. “Silly man. You’re not finished until I tell you so.” He reached out and laid a finger in the middle of Sherlock’s belly, pushing down until Sherlock winced and bent double, trying to escape the pressure on his stuffed stomach. John kept going until Sherlock let out a whimper, then pulled his hand back and laid both palms flat on Sherlock’s stomach, rubbing lightly. “It feels full, love, but I just know you can fit more. Have some of the milk,” he said, nodding toward the glass.
“Ssh,” John murmured, teasing Sherlock up out of his chair. “Doesn’t matter. We can always pretend, can’t we? Your body clearly wants us to,” he said, raking light fingernails down Sherlock’s neck and teasing over his bond scar.
Soon, the can of whipped cream became nothing but nitrous oxide, and Sherlock hummed happily as John emptied the last of it into him. He was fuller now than he’d ever been, the pressure in his belly incredible. He’d been so focused on the pressure in his lower stomach that he’d almost ignored the pressure in his upper belly, which he’d slowly been filling with more soda. That knot of pressure from the carbonation had come back and made the peak in his stomach even harder and more pronounced. He ran his palm over it and pressed down, then groaned loudly. “John.”
Mycroft takes his phone from his pocket, holds down a button, and replaces it. “Could I have a moment to...speak with him?”
“Mmmhmm, that’s what I thought,” John said, nipping Sherlock’s lower lip and then ducking down again to capture Sherlock’s nipple in his mouth, suckling gently.
John moved again and deftly slid two fingers into Sherlock’s opening. He was already swollen and sensitive as his body loosened, so there was no pain, only pressure. John’s fingers pushed and prodded until they found Sherlock’s sweet spot. The Omega whined and breathed John’s name again, begging for more.
“Reuben?” Soren asked, and Sherlock nodded. “Reuben. Little brother. Can I get up and see him?” he asked, and at Sherlock’s nod the little boy was already scrambling up onto the mattress. Oh…oh, man,” he breathed, looking down at the baby, who was now awake. “Daddy, he’s really little.”
"Some go to Victor, others mixed in the cow feed, some are used for cooking and I just toss out the rest. I've too many hens at the moment."
The calf, whom John had named Gladstone, was growing quickly, and at lunch one day John interrupted the silence to ask if Sherlock was going to halter train the young bull. Sherlock had looked at John quizzically and told him he'd had no plans of doing any such thing, but John found an old worn rope halter looped around the fence pole the next morning. He began by slipping the halter on the young calf while he ate, letting him get used to the feeling, and then tying him up for a few minutes a day to get used to the rope. Sherlock scoffed when he saw John crooning to the calf, and said that simply tying him up for a day would break him far easier, and that he was coddling the bull. John snapped back that if Sherlock wasn't the one training the bull, he could back off and let John do whatever the hell he wanted. Sherlock had blinked and stalked off, and as he walked away John had slid down and sat in the straw next to the calf.
A spike of something hot and happy shot through John's heart at the words 'your baby', and he pushed his chair back and made his way around the table to drop to his knees in front of Sherlock. He pushed the man's shirt up over the swell of his stomach and laid his hands on Sherlock's sides, feeling the baby -
It was a bit like watching a magic trick - John’s eyes didn’t quite know where to look when Sherlock shifted, so it was rather like his brain just skipped over the weird bits and started working in real time once the transformation was over. One second, Sherlock stood in front of him, tail flicking, and the next there was a three-foot-tall cat with big, round ears staring up at him with icy blue eyes.
But they were past that, and he had to accept it. He had his bees now, and John had his own little practice in town. They weren’t
The milk made a stinging, metallic sound as it hit the bottom of the pail, rhythmic - sssssrit, ssssrit, sssssrit, sssssrit. "Don't pull, just massage. Make a ring of your thumb and forefinger and slide it down, light pressure. You should be familiar with the motion."
“Bag’s ready.” Sherlock lowered himself onto the sofa with a low grunt. “Everything in there that I can think we might need. Spare socks this time, in case he takes after Soren.” The four-year-old sitting next to John reached over to poke Sherlock’s belly with a faux-menacing frown.
Even months removed, there are wounds in him that have not healed. He forgets sometimes, for increasingly longer stretches of time. But then he’ll pass a mother nursing her child in the park, or spot a young omega who clearly hasn’t told his partner the news yet, or his thumbs will brush over his nearly-faded scar as he buttons his trousers, and the pain surges hot and fierce. The barren hollow above his pelvis sometimes aches to distraction. Sherlock wants, desperately. He should be scrambling to fill that hole.
he said, waving off John’s forkful. “I need room to finish this, and room for pasta is at a premium these days.”
The doctor smiled honestly. “I like hearing that,” she said. “Too many mums these days want scheduled babies. They just want their pregnancies to be over. That’s not to say inductions are bad, but in my opinion, babies come when they’re ready and not a minute before, and that’s the way it ought to be unless something’s wrong.”
John picks up his laptop and sits it on the kitchen table. Meanwhile, Mycroft goes to the sofa and kneels down next to his brother.
"Fine, we just need to try and get it out in the next several contractions or it might suffooooooooh-" Sherlock moaned as Marjorie contracted again, and his own body followed suit. "Crank, god," he gasped, and clutched his own hardening belly as he tried to guide Marjorie's calf out. The head was huge, but facing the right direction, blessedly, and Marjorie herself was no small cow. By the time the contraction ended, the calf's feet were out, and Sherlock could see the bulge of its nose following close behind.
If anyone in a low-flying plane or helicopter happened to fly overhead, they would notice ten-foot-tall letters that read:
That doesn't mean he doesn't find himself himself half-sobbing under the inexorable downward pull of his body's demands, the physical task overriding his faculties and overtaking his brilliant mind. Again, he is terrified. He can hear the midwife talking with John, discussing their options, and he hears the word "caesarian."
“Nursery is done. We’ve more baby clothes than I know what to do with. We could make a blanket for all of Baker Street with the number of burping cloths we’ve been given.”
The thing about knowing that John wanted to take him to bed was that it wasn’t necessarily distracting, unless John wanted it to be. Every once in awhile during a lull in the film, when John moved or the baby shifted or Soren wiggled, Sherlock would think about what John had said, and he’d be filled with a little warmth. By the end of the movie, any reservations Sherlock had had were long gone, and he let John take a sleepy Soren to his room to give Sherlock time to wind down.
“A boy,” Sherlock repeated, squeezing Joanna’s shoulder with a hand that was absolutely not shaking. “Well, let’s see him then,” he said, bending down to look at the baby in Joanna’s arms.
“We’ve only got the stuffing and cranberry sauce left,” Sherlock said. “And there’s not much of either. I think we can do it. Think of how accomplished we’ll be.”
Sherlock is on the couch. He’s still in his pyjamas, and he’s lying on his side with his head on his arm. His other arm is at his side, hand resting softly on his stomach.
The kitten’s fur was drying rapidly, and it looked as pitch black as Sherlock’s own fur was. It was hard to believe that this kitten had any of John’s genetics at all, but he supposed Sherlock didn’t look an ounce human when he was in serval form anyway. His heart beat a little faster at the idea that, in a few months, their kittens would learn to switch forms like Sherlock, and he’d get to see what their children looked like. Sherlock seemed to catch on just as John did, and gave another catlike smile. He let John scratch his ear again, purring at the murmured praise John gave him.
Fact: John's eyes lit up whenever Sherlock put his hands on his swelling middle, in a way that he was sure couldn't be faked.
"Stop that, your fingers are freezing." Sherlock wiggled until John relented and stepped to lean against the countertop. "And nothing's wrong with Marjorie. She's due to dry up soon." At John's inquisitive look, Sherlock elaborated. "She's due to calve in mid April, so we'll dry her up in mid February. Her milk production will decline and we'll just stop milking her. Her body's preparing to give birth, and it'll start producing colostrum for the calf in those two months' break."
“I know you love it until about week thirty and then you do nothing but gripe at me,” John quipped, then let out a strangled moan when Sherlock clenched tight around him.
John scooped up their daughter and bounced her on his hip. She continued to look at Sherlock, concerned for her mummy. “Go back out with Granny,” he said, kissing her cheek. “Mummy needs to be alone for a bit. He’s got to work very hard for Tess to come out.”
“He’s...not talking a whole lot,” John does say. “I think he’s grieving in his...in his own way. He’s already gone to bed. Not feeling well, I don’t think.”
That thought scared John too; what would happen if Sherlock's labour didn't go smoothly? If the baby was breech, or if he needed a caesarean? In a pinch, John could do the work, but he would need to get to a hospital as soon as possible afterwards, to make sure everything was okay. But for now, it was nearly Christmastime, and they had a few more months to go before any of the risks became reality.
Sherlock awoke from sleep to the sound of excited footsteps in the hallway. Reuben was half awake as Sherlock picked him up, settling him in the crook of his arm just as the door opened. Soren paused in the doorway for a split second, then raced to the edge of the bed to peer up at his daddy and brother. “This is him?” he asked, clearly fighting to keep his hands to himself.
“Oh, what a love,” Mrs. Hudson said tearily, hands fluttering over her heart and mouth. “Sherlock, what a beautiful baby you’ve made. Oh, she’s just perfect, isn’t she.” Sherlock felt a swell of pride - he had made a beautiful baby, a perfect baby.
John turns to Sherlock, whose face has gone carefully blank again. John, though, is done. Days and weeks of pent-up emotion have seeped into his chest and festered, becoming something toxic and repulsive.
“What—Sherlock! What are you doing? What the hell did you do?” John cries, shoving Sherlock out of the way.
even though his stomach was jam-packed with food already. He looked down at himself and let out another low sound. He wouldn’t be able to eat it; there was no room at all in his stomach for anything else. He drew in a shallow breath - anything deeper pulled at his skin and made his lungs ache - and shook his head. “I’ll have it tomorrow,” he said, touching his belly gingerly and hoping that would satisfy John.
John had apologised at lunch, but Sherlock didn't respond. The man seemed more distant than usual, which was really saying something. He spent the entirety of dinner with one hand on his growing stomach, and left the dishes on the table when he was finished, retreating to his room without a word of acknowledgement to John.
“You’re awful.” Sherlock drank more slowly, but drank the rest of his glass, letting out a quiet ‘oof’ when he finished. He stood up, holding his stomach for a moment before picking up his glass and John’s and re-filling them from the sink. He couldn’t help but notice that he was moving differently, more carefully, and that his stomach pressed into the countertop when he stood as close as he usually did to the sink.
"And I did get you something, really. Let me-" Sherlock grunted and pushed himself upwards, rubbing his stomach lightly as he rose to his feet. "It's nothing much, really, just something I did while you were out tending the sheep a few weeks ago." Sherlock walked into their bedroom and came back out with a large sheet of paper, which he handed to John carefully. "It's not anything great, but it's the best I could do."
Sherlock’s eyes wrinkled at the corners as he smiled. He smoothed his shirt over his bump, the wrinkles giving way to show off the round curve of it. “Tessy is in here, isn’t she,” he said, nodding back when Cara giggled and nodded again. “Do you want to say good morning?”
The cat had awoken John in the morning by pawing at his arm. John awoke and sat bolt upright, searching Sherlock for signs of labor. Sherlock shook his head and rolled onto his back, wiggling and flicking his tail. He held his front legs up, and John realized what he wanted. He picked the big cat up with a grunt and carried him to the litter box, where an extremely uncomfortable Sherlock waddled in to relieve himself.
Sherlock nodded, a little reluctantly. “It was a good dinner. Very - big portions,” he said, his eyes still on his full middle, which John was rubbing with enthusiasm.
Sherlock only managed a nod, but John laughed, the tightness in his chest easing. The nurses knew what they were doing, and it would all be alright now. “It’s our first,” he offered, and the second nurse - Abby, by her name tag - smiled. “A girl. Joanna.”
Sherlock turned with a frankly pissed off expression on his face, glaring at John. "Now is not the time for jokes, John."
Sherlock’s ears flicked and he tipped his head into John’s hand. “Steak,” he said. “Thick, juicy steak, barely warmed. Mmm, a few of them.”
He felt John’s hand on him, on the sore, swollen flesh between his legs, pressing down as if to give resistance. He took another breath and pushed, and felt himself spread wide against John’s hand. Pain, white-hot, burned through that flesh, and he stopped pushing even as his womb continued to contract. “It hurts,” he whimpered, his chest jerking with irregular breaths as he looked up, worried, at John.
John blanched when Sherlock handed him the folder. “I totally forgot,” he said, and cast a glance Sherlock’s way. “I don’t suppose any of that was -“
John caught the blanket gratefully, wiping off his face and wrapping the warm cloth around his shoulders and following Sherlock into the sitting room. He perched awkwardly on the edge of a well-worn sofa and looked around.
John slid his arms under Sherlock’s and moved him forward, then picked him up. Sherlock cried out and clutched his belly, trying to stay as still as possible, but John forced him to stand on his feet. “It’s a short walk, love. If you want, I’ll carry you, but you’ll have to have another glass of milk when we get there.” This threat made Sherlock lurch forward, trying to stay bent double to keep some of the pressure of his stretched skin from making it worse.
He hadn’t realized just how much worse the contractions were going to get. The more they happened, the more they hurt, and after a few hours there was more than just the pain of the contractions to deal with - there was the pressure of a baby moving down in his body, preparing to exit. By noon her head was pressing against his ripening-but-not-quite-dilated cervix, and it felt like a blunt red-hot iron was being held to his insides during contractions.
Mycroft lets his hand drop and looks to his brother on the sofa. His mouth twists into something strictly controlled, but only just. "How has he been?" he says, talking to John but looking at Sherlock.
"No. These are Wiltipolls sheep, they shed naturally. Meat breeds. In the spring, after lambing, they'll be sold and fed out, then butchered for meat."
The chickens were squawking when John came round the corner, and he could see Sherlock standing in the center of the small flock and tossing kernels of corn out onto the ground. "These are simple to care for; I'll do them for awhile longer. Just throwing feed at them once a day suffices. Come here, I'll show you how to gather eggs."
Sherlock laid awake in bed that night, long after John's breathing had evened out and his mate had entered REM sleep. Staring out the bedroom window at the moors, lit only by a half moon and eerily foggy, Sherlock contemplated. Did John really mean it? Would he really want the baby wriggling in his belly, would he really treat it as he would his own flesh and blood?
Sherlock's mouth spreads into a grimace of pain. He blinks once, twice, then opens his eyes. They don't focus on anything in particular, just gaze glassily at the ceiling. He goes to lift one arm, but finds it heavily weighed down by IV lines. He winces, lays it back down, and tries the other.
Sherlock made a low rumbling noise and John looked up. Sherlock was staring at the kitten John held, nodding toward it. John made as if to put it back and Sherlock shook his head and nodded at it again. John caught on and quickly peered between the kitten’s back legs. “Girl,” he said, cradling the kitten close. Sherlock blinked slowly, nodded his head, and kept licking their newest kitten.
With John’s hands where Sherlock wanted them, the omega bore down with another contraction. He felt the first baby’s body move, keenly aware of exactly where the baby was. Its head moved through the open muscle of his cervix and started pressing downward, outward, stretching Sherlock wide as he pushed. He inhaled sharply through his nose and stopped pushing as the contraction petered out. “It feels like…a knot,” he said, opening his eyes and looking up at John. “Like a huge…huge knot. Moving down.” He exhaled as a full-body shiver ran from his neck all the way down to his toes.
“Thankfully, your parents won’t mind if not everything is fitting perfectly,” John said, attempting to soothe. “Your mother bore two children. She understands the difficulty of it.” He pulled at the button and hem until he managed to force the two to meet, if just barely. All done, he laid both hands on Sherlock’s middle and rubbed softly. “You’ve not long to go, I promise you. Babies are fickle things, but they always come in the end. You’ve done a wonderful thing, you know. It will come soon, and be healthy.” He planted a soft kiss on Sherlock’s frowning mouth.
After a light lunch - all he could manage, really - John joined him in bed, rubbing his swollen stomach and talking quietly to the baby. "Come on out, love. Daddy's tired, and you've got to be all cramped up in there. Why don't you come out and say hi? I promise, it's not as bad out here as you might think."
“Lovely name,” said the nurse pushing the wheelchair. “I’m Maggie. Abby and I will be helping your little Joanna come to meet you, but first let’s get you settled into your room.” John nodded and followed along at the fast clip that Maggie set, shouldering Sherlock’s hospital bag as they got inside.
John pulled the cap off the can of whipped cream and stuck the tip in the end of the hose, then pressed down. Sherlock didn’t really feel it at first, but after a few seconds he could feel the cream moving into his guts, a small influx of pressure at first that quickly grew intense. “Ooh,” he breathed, watching as John moved his hand to the side. It didn’t take long for his shirt to start to shift - or, rather, for his lower belly to start to fill up in a way that made his shirt stretch. Before his eyes, his lower stomach was filling up and getting round.
“It looks like it’s very good,” John agreed, helping towel his mate off and guiding him across the slippery floor back to their bedroom. He didn’t bother to hide his own arousal, shamelessly adjusting his erection as he watched his gravid partner waddle toward the bed. “Do you want me to do an exam, just to make sure everything is progressing alright?” he offered.
John calls Sherlock’s name when he arrives back at the flat, but (unsurprisingly) there is no response. Sherlock’s here, though—his shoes are at the door, coat on the hook, phone on the kitchen table. “Sherlock?” John calls again, and this time hears movement behind the closed door of the bathroom. John wishes, briefly, that he sees Sherlock even half so often as that damned shower does.
Almost immediately, his milk let down, and he felt a surge of hormones course through his veins. The pleasure from the second baby’s position ratcheted up and so did the strength of his contractions, all culminating in a hard push that had Sherlock’s toes curling again as the baby’s head came to crown. The first baby’s sucks were hard, drawing colostrum from Sherlock’s breast, and she nursed hungrily, her little grunts drowned out by the noises Sherlock made as he worked to deliver.
“My thigh muscles are shot,” Sherlock said, shaking his head. If the pregnancy itself hadn’t done them in, the short walk had.
John had moved to the window seat when Sherlock got back. He sank gratefully into the aisle seat, glad at least to not have to climb over John to get back to his place. He took John’s hand and laid it, palm-down, on his lower belly, where the baby was having hiccups. He smiled at John’s wide grin and quiet laughter, relaxing a little knowing they were close to their destination.
That is the very last straw. Because that's what he was afraid of, wasn't he? That Sherlock didn't come to share in their mutual grief. That instead, he wants to force the lid down on John's, when frankly, John isn't finished with it yet. It's too much to lock away just now. Even if it wasn't, he's not sure he'd try.
John could tell the moment Sherlock saw what John had seen. “So I do,” he said, looking at himself in the mirror and tracing his finger along the line of his trouser waistband. “Well. These were my largest pair of trousers, so they’ll have to do. We won’t be fooling anyone tonight,” he said, and John saw the light in his eyes.
“It hurts,” he said, the skin of his belly - for that’s what it was now, swollen and round and firm - taut and hot under his palm. Even though some of the food had settled lower in his digestive system, his stomach itself was still packed, so full that it looked like it was coming to a point. He looked over and saw the glass of milk, still mostly full, and the piece of cake, all there but for one small bite, and made a noise of pain and uncertainty. “John…”
“I’m here,” John said, and his hands were on Sherlock’s shoulders and arm. “I’m right here. You’re ready, love, you’re almost done.”
Sherlock is running his fingers back and forth over the scar. Already it’s only a thin pink line, intersected by the dark tan vertical line that appeared halfway through the second trimester, when Sherlock was just beginning to really show.
Sherlock’s serval-ness grows more prominent week by week. As the kittens get bigger, he naps more, stretching out on the sofa with his growing belly poking up underneath the blankets. He demands more pets and scratches, and positively purrs with delight when John scratches and rubs his belly. His nipples start to get puffy and sensitive, getting ready to provide kittens with colostrum.
“Lot of muscles there doing some pretty hard work,” John sympathised, kissing Sherlock’s crown and sliding one hand down to his lower back to knead at the tight muscles. “It’s alright, love. It’s not ideal, but it’s going to be fine. You’re going to be alright, and so will she.”
"I mean, I live with you after all, and it's your baby, and I'm your friend. I suppose…" John trailed off and cleared his throat. "I…if you don't want me to feel it, that's fine. I just figured I'd ask."
“I can change back and forth now, if I need to. They’re eating enough solid foods, they don’t need my milk all the time. And I can teach Faith and Calvin how to change, too. If Alice has figured it out, they won’t be far behind.” Sherlock ran his hands up and down John’s upper arms, seemingly unable to keep his hands off John too.
in,” Sherlock said, tossing another shirt to the side in search of one that could cover his bump. “I want to move her around some, see if she decides she can come out already. I
The bartender interrupted John's train of thought by sliding a steaming basket of fish and chips under his nose. John inhaled deeply and sighed. "Thanks, mate," he murmured, and doused his chips in vinegar before popping one into his mouth.
Across the table, John was in the same state. His stomach had become a tan ball, pushing his pajama pants low. The whole thing was round and packed full, and John was breathing as shallowly as Sherlock, leaned back in his chair. They both sat there, staring wordlessly, their breaths labored as they cradled their bursting stomachs in both hands.
"Do you make a habit of fucking sheep?" Sherlock looked affronted and John guffawed. "I didn't think so, but just thought I ought to ask. Potential mates should know the worst about each other, after all."
"Yes, yes, obviously. Here, put this on, I won't have you dying, I wouldn't be able to dispose of your body properly," Sherlock said, and tossed John a blanket before striding back into the sitting room and flopping down on the couch.
Sherlock disappears to use the bathroom after the service, abandoning John to their friends. John fields interminable embraces, expressions of sympathy, offers of home-cooked food, and other people’s tears. His own eyes are dry, though his throat feels tight.
“Have a lie-down, then, and I’ll give you the famous Watson foot rub.” Sherlock rolled his eyes and waddled to the little bedroom, settling in on the mattress and sighing heavily.
“When I became pregnant with Joanna,” Sherlock finished, nodding. Something strange and more sad than he wanted to admit had settled in his chest as soon as his brain had finished slotting all the pieces into place. “I’m sure mother knew exactly what I was going to tell her when I asked if we could come visit,” he said, nodding again. “Even consulting geniuses are transparent at times.”
"You've been recently injured," the tall man said, ignoring the question entirely. "In which branch of the army did you serve? I didn't see any identifying tattoos."
“The head is coming out,” John said, throwing a glance at Sherlock. “I’m holding - I’m holding it in my hand. It’s coming out slowly. Just breathe.” He fumbled for Sherlock’s hand and Sherlock took it, squeezing his fingers unbearably tight as he felt the slow emergence from his body.
The third one happened twenty minutes later. Then a fourth, and then a fifth, and after the sixth they stopped counting.
John hesitated for a minute before reaching toward the box. Sherlock’s head shot up to stare at John’s hands, then his face, and John waited for Sherlock’s permission. The serval slowly lowered his head and nudged their firstborn toward John, blinking at the human.
Sherlock, for his part, wanted nothing more than to be rid of the thing, support be damned. Somehow he knew that no amount of fiddling with the fit would bring him any sort of relief. “Whatever you think best,” he sighed, knowing he’d be unable to fit back in his garments without the minimizing, if uncomfortable, corset.
There was the same joy at feeling her kick that he’d felt last time. As far as he could tell, John was as incandescently happy to feel her thumping inside Sherlock’s womb as he had been when Violet did the same thing, but even through the joy Sherlock could see the edges: a little ragged, a little tattered with worry.
Some days, Sherlock speaks to the bees, who listen to what he has to say while working merrily. When Sherlock takes his grandchildren out to the hives, they buzz and land on little hands without fear of harm. He teaches the children how the bees organize and work for the hive, and they taste the raw honey from the combs. John teaches them how to use it in tea, and Sherlock sends them home with jars to use on their own, and after a time, he never feels empty at all. He has more than he’d ever thought he would have, and he cherishes every moment.
"Milk goes in here to cool. We'll check the chickens and sheep, and come back later to process it. Oh, christ in hell," Sherlock cursed as the rod of the milking stool banged against a pile of empty egg cartons and knocked them over. "Tell me next time," he spat, and set the pails down angrily next to the cooling tank and yanked the leather straps off.
Sherlock obeyed, pulling the shirt down over his stomach. It still went down the whole way, but it was tightest over the top of his stomach, where the carbonation still made his skin tight. John knelt between his legs and Sherlock let him take his pants off, then spread his legs to let John put the hose for the whipped cream in. Sherlock shivered a little in anticipation.
“I never said goodbye. I never even said her name. I never held her, not once. I didn't even see her. I thought maybe if I didn't, I could—it could be like it was.”
After a few minutes, Mrs. Hudson took Cara and bade them goodbye. Their oldest was going to sleep downstairs that night, and give Sherlock and John an evening to themselves without having to worry about taking care of their eldest along with the brand-new baby girl.
“Not really,” he said, glancing down at his bump. “I feel gargantuan, but I don’t like the idea of shunting her out before she’s ready. I want her to come when she’s done.”
Gradually, eventually, it tapers out, leaving John exhausted and drained. His limbs are almost too numb and heavy to lift. He turns his head and rubs his face over his arm, wiping away tears and spit and slime.
John dropped to his knees in front of Sherlock, pushing up the hem of his gown, heedless of decorum. He gasped and looked up at the omega. “It’s past time. Sherlock, the baby is almost crowning.”
Sherlock pulled himself to his feet and arranged his shirt in a way that minimised the four-month pregnant bump that was growing on his front. The result of an ill-fated coupling the
Cara said a quiet okay and let herself be given back to Mrs. Hudson, who fluttered a hand in a goodbye and retreated to their sitting room. John sat next to Sherlock on the bed, taking his hand and squeezing it. “I’m so tired,” Sherlock said after a moment of silence.
Sherlock opened his eyes and looked down. The veins that had been visible before were even more visible now, his skin stark white and so smooth it looked translucent. It was shiny along the tightest, fullest part - the curve just beneath his pectoral muscles leading down to his navel. The whole thing felt hot to the touch and so packed full that it had no give at all when John pressed down. Sherlock gave a halfhearted wince and moan but didn’t have the energy to try and move away from the pain.
“What the hell are we meant to do with these?” Sherlock groused as he lugged the third cooler full of Christmas leftovers to their rental car. “Mummy made enough food for a dozen people, I’m not sure why she was so shocked she had leftovers after feeding just five of us.”
"You taste amazing, god," John murmured when he stopped for air, and then pushed his lips to John's so harshly that Sherlock's opened in response and their teeth clacked together.
Sherlock let out a noise very close to a moan when John rubbed his arches. “Remind me of how good this feels in about a month,” he said, his eyes falling shut. “I’ll suck you off as belated thanks.”
The cookie tasting was a good way to spend the afternoon, though by the time they were finished, Sherlock’s back was starting to ache fiercely. He turned on the heated seats in their rental car and was glad for the relief the heat provided, and by the time they made it back to their cottage, he was feeling better. “I’m in for a nap,” Sherlock said, kicking off his shoes and heading for their bedroom. “I’m entitled to an afternoon of laziness on Christmas Eve. I’m nearly forty-one weeks pregnant and just spent the majority of my day out and about on holiday.”
“Not our bed for much longer. Not our problem,” John said cheerily, pulling Sherlock’s feet into his lap and starting to knead lightly at the arches.
“They’re perfect,” Sherlock said, swiping at his own tears. He shook his head. “No, I love them. They’re perfect.”
Sherlock’s eyes were heavy-lidded and he was already out of breath, but the pleasure he was getting from grinding himself against John was the best he’d felt in ages. He breathed out John’s name shakily, the barest of grins on his face, needy and aroused. So he was one of
When John makes him, he eats. He showers for a very long time, so long that John gets concerned and is about to consider breaking the door in before he emerges.
John did, starting off slow to get the right angle and then moving faster, watching his cock slide in and out of the shallow but terribly hot space between Sherlock’s breasts. The head of his cock appeared and disappeared with every thrust of his hips as his foreskin rolled over it, making the sensation even more intense.
John put their take-home portions of pasta in the fridge while Sherlock changed clothes. The milk for their hot cocoa was just starting to steam in the pot when Sherlock emerged from the bedroom in his pajamas, looking very cosy. John said as much and Sherlock smiled, giving John an indulgent kiss on the cheek and leaning back against the counter.
On the mantle, there are photos, and at some point everyone in the room quietly notices two sonogram prints, nearly identical in gestational age. Two murky silhouettes, outlines of tiny hands and feet, both marked “female” with Sherlock’s name typed near the top. In the corner of the print on the left is a tiny lock of hair, tucked into the frame.
He lowers himself to aching knees, then flops backward gracelessly and leans against the tub walls. Sherlock is hand-expressing one breast, which is reddened and looks terribly painful.
“Let me know if it gets too bad, yeah?” he says softly, feeling like his words are disturbing some sort of thick dust that has settled over the room.
“I’m beginning to feel a bit like a stuffed turkey myself,” Sherlock said, starting slowly on the meat and potatoes. He noticed John shift a little in his chair, and saw his cheeks flush. “Oh, you like that. Do you want me to talk about it?” he asked, letting out an inelegant burp.
“We can freeze some,” John said, shutting the door after Sherlock had shoved the cooler inside. “And she’s right, we don’t cook often enough, so having actual home-cooked food is better than ordering in all the time.”
“Oh, I’m sure you will, love. You’ve still got plenty of room,” John said, patting Sherlock’s side lightly. “I’ll even feed you, so all you have to do is chew and swallow. That’ll make it easier, won’t it?” he said, his finger brushing over the tautest part of Sherlock’s stomach.
He sighed as he put all the papers away and back into their folder. “Well,” he said, looking down at his rounded stomach, “You’ll be coming with us one way or another, I suppose.”
They walked another mile in silence, weeds rustling in the gentle wind. As they crested the hill, the landscape suddenly opened and spread out in front of John and Sherlock, miles and miles of dull green grasses and bright purple flowers, brown foliage and deep green trees. The clouds overhead cast slowly-moving shadows across the valley, and sheep dotted the hillsides in small packs.
"Yeah. You're smart, and a fast learner, if your finesse at farm chores is any indicator. And I think you really do care about your baby."
John’s eyes went wide and he made an impressed face. “It might be better than Angelo’s?” he said, reaching across the table to rap his knuckles on Sherlock’s forehead. Sherlock frowned. “Just checking to make sure that’s really you in there. I never thought I’d hear such blasphemy.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at John, and the doctor’s heart skipped a beat. Sherlock’s ear flicked back and forth, and he took another slow bite of his sandwich, staring John down. “We’d better start getting ready,” he said.
"Okay, Sherlock?" John asked, pausing in his cranking as Marjorie's contraction ended. "Everything alright?"
Sherlock shook his head and tugged at John’s hand until he laid down across from Sherlock. “It’ll be okay. Won’t be able to move tomorrow, but it was worth it.” He picked up John’s hand and traced his fingertip around the edges of John’s short, blunt fingers. He kissed the tips delicately and then released the hand once more.
“Incredible,” John said, “Amazing.” He wasn’t sure whether he meant Sherlock or Joanna, but it really didn’t matter, in the end.
“Good morning,” Sherlock replied. “I like Greer too, but it’s just a bit too Scottish for central London.” He rubbed the top of his bump. “Perhaps for the next one.”
Sherlock was pink around the ears and stifling yawns every other minute by the time everyone put on their coats to leave. He did stand up to hug everyone as they left, ignoring his exhaustion and back pain in favor of showing their guests how genuinely grateful he was to have their company for the evening.
John kept an eye out for the snow plows, but by six in the morning they still hadn’t come. Sherlock was still sleeping between contractions as best he could, but the time between them was starting to decrease and it was getting harder and harder to fall back asleep. Finally, the sun rose and Sherlock decided to abandon the idea of sleep for now. “Happy Christmas,” he said, sitting very delicately on a chair and wincing at his sore back. John’s tight expression relaxed and he gathered Sherlock into his arms, kissing his temple.
“Oh my god,” came John’s voice, thick with tears. His hand was on her head, cradling it next to Sherlock’s, touching their baby daughter. “Oh my god, Sherlock,
Sherlock took John’s hand and laid it over his stomach, mostly flat now, decades after he’d borne their daughter. Some of his stretch marks were dark around his navel - those would never fully fade, he knew. Reminders, always, of Joanna and the time he’d carried her. Reminders of the one they’d lost. This body, over half a century old, marked from bullets and knives and fists and, in the most tender way, from creating new life. John’s fingers curled around Sherlock’s there, in the space between his hips, and Sherlock didn’t feel empty at all.
John moved warily to stand in front of the hen, and slid his hand under her, trying to be as unobtrusive as Sherlock had been. He thought he'd succeeded until a sharp bite to his arm made him yelp and withdraw quickly, holding his thumb over the spot of blood that had risen to the surface. "What did I do wrong?"
“I told her you were fine,” Mrs. Hudson said softly, a soothing presence at the edge of the mattress. “But she heard you and needed to see you. I told her that her little sister will be here soon.”
“Look at you,” the Alpha murmured, stepping forward. His gaze traveled up and down Sherlock’s body, lingering on the fullness of his belly and chest. “Hardly seen any of you the past few weeks. You’ve been hiding.” He closed the distance between himself and Sherlock, palms running flat over his belly and settling on his hips.
“I want you in me,” Sherlock breathed, his knees spreading as if in response to the thought. John nodded and helped Sherlock lie down, finally able to catch sight of his cock as he laid on his side. Just as he’d suspected, it was hard and pressed against Sherlock’s belly, the tip leaking freely. His thighs were slick with clear fluid.
"Oh," Sherlock breathed, and pulled it closer to look at the embossing on the fob. "It's lovely, John," he murmured, tracing his finger around the intricate patterns and admiring the watch's face. The hands ticked delicately, clicking softly as each second passed. "I love it. Thank you."
“Well, I don’t think I’d help anything if I said what we’re both thinking right now, so let me try to reassure you because at least that won’t hurt.” John smiled into Sherlock’s shoulder.
John chuckled and stood up, taking Sherlock’s hands and helping him to his feet. Sherlock swayed for a moment as he stood, finding his balance again, and offering John a shy smile. “How I long for the days that I could stand on my own and not risk falling over,” he said, shaking his head.
“I think she meant, you know, pacing. Or going for a run or building a bookshelf or whatever. You’re supposed to conserve energy.”
“Stop, or my head will be too big to fit out the doorway,” Sherlock chastised, a flush coloring his cheeks. He ducked his head to hide his smile, a fruitless effort. “You’re rather handsome tonight, yourself,” he added, lifting his gaze to meet John’s eyes. The flush renewed when he saw how John was looking at him - the same way he’d looked at Sherlock a year ago today, as they held hands in front of a crowd of friends and family to declare their commitment for one another.
With each roll of John’s hips, heat coiled at the base of Sherlock’s spine, tight like a spring. The base of the Alpha’s cock puffed up little by little - not a knot, he couldn’t manage a knot outside of heat - but just thick enough to add a little more friction to the in-out rhythm John had set. Sherlock’s breath came quicker and a flush rose to his neck and chest as John fucked him faster and harder. His fingers tugged more roughly at his nipples, squeezing the blossomed flesh of his breasts, sensitive and tender to the touch. John’s irregular strokes of Sherlock’s cock dragged even more sensation out of his taxed body, making that spring twist even tighter.
“Don’t make this any harder on me than it needs to be, little one,” he murmured quietly, touching the hard line of her shoulder lightly with two fingers. “If this was your sign that you’re coming soon, I heard it loud and clear.” Of course, there was no answer, but something inside Sherlock told him that their daughter would be on her way very, very soon.
John shrugs. He's fielded the question already and given more or less the same rote answer every time: "He's managing as best he can." But saying the same to Greg after his unexpected honesty feels wrong.
John looked at Sherlock, hair ruffled and fluffy, and looking enormously pregnant, and broke out laughing, shaking his head. “Sorry! Sorry. It’s just really hard to take any threat seriously when you look like a fuzzy kiwi bird.”
Somehow, he’d run out of laces when he’d had just enough that morning. He frowned and looked down, trying to figure out what had changed. “You’re run out of laces,” he said, glancing at the nearly four inches of undone corset at the top. “I don’t know how, unless I’ve not done it tight enough.”
Sherlock nodded and kept pace alongside John, pulling the head off a daisy as he walked past. “Joanna Grace Holmes.”
There’s no point in lying, not to him. John shrugs helplessly. "Like...this. All the time. He eats whatever I give him, and he showers. Besides that?" He gestures to the couch. "Right there."
The knot went down after a few minutes and John was able to slide out of Sherlock. He arranged their bodies to curl around one another, sharing their body heat and basking in the remains of Sherlock’s false heat, which was fading as fast as it had come on.
The room is quiet now that John’s phone is off. He’d let a few people know—Greg, Mrs. Hudson, Mycroft—trusted them to pass the news along to anyone else who needed to know, and powered it down. He wants the silence.
Suddenly, he knew exactly what he wanted to do. Exactly what his body needed. With a gargantuan effort he rose from the couch and left his toast there, heading back toward the bedroom where John still slept. Not for long.
The pressure changed. Dropped. Sherlock let out a harsh noise and bore down, barely aware of the scuffle of movement around him. Someone else’s unfamiliar hands were on his thighs, spreading them wider. Sherlock allowed himself to be moved, too focused on the gradual exit of the baby to protest.
“I bet you’ll feel it a lot, the more you drink,” John said, and Sherlock knew what that meant, so he kept drinking.
He sloshed a little along the way, all the liquid in his tummy moving around the gas that filled the rest of his bloated organ. He waited until he’d laid back down, remainder of the gas still safely in his stomach, before speaking again. “I’m sloshy,” he called, stroking his stomach.
"You're not in heat, berk," John replied, and Sherlock blinked and then glared. "It's not my fault! You're the pregnant one." Sherlock glared down at his stomach. "It's not his fault, either. Well, inadvertently. But not really. That one's mostly you."
fault. I’m not calling the shots here, she is. But I’m not in labor,” he said definitively. “And I won’t be until we’re safe back in London, even if I have to hold her in by myself.” John made an affirmative noise and put a DVD in the player, abandoning the fading TV signal.
“I’m sorry,” John breathes, and stops himself from reaching out to take Sherlock’s free hand. “Is this why you left?”
Not much changed in the way of chores; John continued to do everything but feed the chickens and collect eggs. They woke up together in the mornings, Sherlock did the loathesome household chores while John worked outside, and they ate their meals together. John caught him with his hand on his belly every now and then, cradling the swell. On occasion, Sherlock would pull John's hand down to feel, tentatively pressing it against an elbow or knee. John loved those moments, when Sherlock felt open enough to let John feel his baby as it grew.
The midwife arrived at half past five in the evening and asked John to help strip the sheets from and remake the bed. More hands made light work and they were done before Sherlock had another contraction, this one bad enough that he made a low noise in his throat until it passed. “Vocalizing is a good sign,” the midwife said, kneading Sherlock’s shoulder. “Comfortable squatting like that?”
Sherlock went to his desk and ruffled around looking for the receipt and tickets and found that John had helpfully put all their documents in a folder, labeled ‘Christmas Holiday 2017.’ He pulled out the sheet of paper for their train tickets - ‘NON-REFUNDABLE’ in big bold black print on the bottom. That much he’d suspected. He found the printed sheet for their rented cottage and winced when he saw the same ‘NON-REFUNDABLE’ printed next to their deposit and subsequent full payment.
“That I don’t mind. I just don’t want her waiting too much longer. I’m afraid she’ll find herself getting evicted if she overstays her welcome.”
"And how did you fare, while your strong Alpha was gone?" he crooned, and yelped when Sherlock reached over and pinched his arm.
“Got you, beautiful mum,” John murmured, moving an arm to wrap around Sherlock’s back, pulling him up and against John’s hard body. Sherlock’s hand found the back of John’s head and held on tight, and the blond responded by sucking more of Sherlock’s breast into his mouth and sucking.
“I’d be so fucking hard if I weren’t so fucking full,” John said, his cheeks flushed and eyes slightly glassy. “Remind me to take pictures so I can remember this and get off to it sometime when I’m not in awful pain because I’m so full.”
“It’ll be so nice to have a little girl around,” Mrs. Hudson cooed, bright-eyed thanks to a second glass of wine. “Running around the flat, cheering the place up. This man-cave needs a bit of a feminine touch to it.”
“I want her to come out, too. Go back and see papa. I’ll be back out in a minute.” He ushered Cara back toward the door, and the sound of her footsteps echoed down the hallway as she headed back to the living room.
He stares over at Sherlock’s face, lying pale and motionless, blue veins stark under the cold fluorescent lights.
Whether or not it should, the first punch catches John by surprise. It strikes him across the cheek. As he staggers backwards, he blocks the second one coming at his face, but misses the hard shove to his chest. He misses the next shove too, but on the third he catches Sherlock's arms and fights back. Sherlock wrestles him to the side, and John sees the look on his face—manic, wild, teeth bared and eyes savage. It ignites something in him, and he surges up and fights back. He bats Sherlock's hands out of the way, braces his own against Sherlock's chest, and pushes him away.
John cut a piece off of the cake - heaped with glistening chocolate frosting. He brought it to Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock took it but hesitated before chewing and swallowing, knowing that it was going to hurt when he did. “Come on, now,” John said, and Sherlock swallowed, then let out a quiet whimper.
He connects the disparate facts—appetite, lethargy, mood swings—while he’s in bed with John on a Tuesday morning. The realization strikes him with a wave of nausea so acute that it makes him bolt upright with a gasp. In an instant, John is awake, if not entirely alert.
“Oh,” Sherlock’s spoon stopped halfway to his mouth and hovered in midair, shaking very slightly. A drop of soup dripped from the bottom of it and landed on the table, but Sherlock didn’t notice. He concentrated very carefully on the unfamiliar feeling of a cramp rolling through his belly, far stronger than the practice contractions he’d had.
"Easy enough," John said softly, and he heard Sherlock's grunt of agreement. "So. You don't seem the farming type. How'd you get into…this?"
John sat in the straw for a few minutes, wondering why he'd gotten so angry at Sherlock for a simple suggestion. He felt horrifically guilty. Gladstone grunted next to his ear, interrupting his thoughts, and licked John across the face. John had laughed and pushed him away. "None of that, you great bloody brute."
His trousers and the rest of his undergarments were taken away to be washed. Sherlock stood on shaky legs on the tiled floor while John ran a hot bath. He didn’t dare look in the mirror for fear of what he’d see - his own body, grossly swollen and disproportionate, sagging and marked. Another spasm of pain rolled through his back and he pressed a hand to it, biting his lip and leaning hard against the sink.
“It’s snowing,” Sherlock said, watching as flurries fell outside the window. “You know, if I weren’t so enormously pregnant, I think I’d like to take a walk in that snow, but as it stands I’m much happier being off my feet and inside where it’s warm.”
Sherlock’s hand moved to rest on his middle, which felt more hollow now than it had twenty-nine years ago, when he’d been emptied of his burden to have her laid on his chest, brand-new and wet and screaming. More hollow, even, than after the second child they’d lost before they ever knew it was there. Somehow, despite the decades that had passed and all the joy that Joanna had brought them, the pain felt new again. “But I’ll have a grandchild,” he said, mustering the strength to speak.
"How long?" His voice is barely louder than a whisper. John remembers why: the long, awful scream of pain just before Sherlock fell terribly, awfully silent, and the room filled immediately with people.
Somehow, it did. Even through the pain and discomfort, something arousing curled deep in the pit of his stuffed belly, telling him that this was good, that this was right. “It does,” he said, letting out a little burp and another moan.
He was woken at half six to the feeling of Sherlock squirming to roll over. The cat let out a yowl and moved off of John’s lap, which in and of itself was very out of character. John was about to ask why he hadn’t just asked to have been carried to the litter pan when he connected the dots.
John came home from the clinic and set his bag down. “You smell nice,” he said, walking over to Sherlock in his chair. “Mm, very nice.” Sherlock could tell he was thinking - he could hear the gears turning. His pheromones must have been having a field day in response to Joanna’s, because as soon as John came close, Sherlock felt the embers flare into flame. He couldn’t hide his little gasp and he heard John’s chuckle, then felt the sandpapery-rough of John’s stubble against his jaw. “I think someone needs to be taken to bed and thoroughly satisfied,” the alpha rumbled, sending shivers down Sherlock’s spine.
"Go on, anyone who's sitting has eggs underneath her. Pick them up." John managed to finish the chore, Sherlock watching him intently, and only got nipped once more. When they finished, the basket had nearly two dozen eggs, and they were all different sizes - very unlike the ones John bought in the ASDA.
They were getting ready for a late New Years party with some of Sherlock’s family. “I’m not sure I’m ready to tell them yet,” Sherlock said, pulling on his trousers and letting the waistband settle on his hips while he buttoned his shirt. “I know it’s safe now, and we planned to, but I’m still just...”
“Yeah, I bet so. Do you want - I mean, they’re both out there and I’m sure they’re anxious to see her, but we can make them wait if -“
Sherlock, the poor thing, was growing uncomfortable. As it stretched, his womb started tugging at muscles that really weren’t designed to stretch far distances, and as a result his spine smarted when he spent any amount of time on his feet. At the same time, laying down didn’t bring much relief, because his sheer size pulled at his spine until it was curved past the point of comfort. Looking at his mate, John really wasn’t sure if he had four weeks left in him.
Without pain to inhibit his pushes, Sherlock bore down eagerly and for as long as he could with each contraction. His breathing was heavy and sweat beaded on his forehead. He pried his eyes open when he heard John make a noise and his gaze shifted to the reflection in the mirror. To his surprise he saw a dark head opening him wide, their baby’s head emerging already.
“Love you, too. Clean me up.” Sherlock sank back onto the pillows, lacing his fingers together over his belly.
“Perfect,” John said, putting his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder lightly. Their daughter was as pale-skinned as her father, but had her papa’s button nose and cheeks. Sherlock’s dark hair was a drying wisp of a curl on her crown. As the sun came weakly through the windows, the snow falling just beyond the glass, Georgia slept peacefully in her father’s arms on her very first Christmas morning.
"If we get it out to its neck the next contraction, we'll be fine," Sherlock panted, his legs shaking as his body relaxed. "Crank like the wind, John." John affirmed Sherlock's statement with a nod and both men were silent as they waited for Marjorie.
John gaped at the sketch in his hands. It was of him and Gladstone, outside the barn going on a walk. Gladstone's tail flicked at flies and the smile on John's face was wide and genuine. Though the pencil marks were rough, the drawing was accurate, and Sherlock had captured the moment perfectly. "Thank you," John whispered, eyes dampening as he took in the tiny details - the spots on Gladstone's side, the white hairs in his tail, the wrinkles in John's denims and the splatters of mud on both of their legs.
“I have an alternate proposal,” John said, setting to work on Sherlock’s right ankle. “How about I rub this foot and then I bugger
Father and son turned as John entered the room, Soren’s duffel on one shoulder and Sherlock’s hospital bag rolling next to him. “Family hug time, is it?” he asked, and crossed the room to gather their family together in a big, tight hug. “That’s it. We’re going to be just fine, my loves. Let’s get daddy to the doctor to have the baby, alright, Soren?” he asked, ruffling Soren’s messy curls. Soren nodded in agreement, smiling widely, and ran to put on his shoes. John gave Sherlock an extra hug and laid a hand on his low belly. “We’re gonna be just fine.”
“You wouldn’t have slept through this part,” John said, striding back into the room, looking silly in his pyjamas carrying his leather bag. Sherlock was about to agree when a pain started in his lower back, creeping around to the front of his belly and stealing his breath away. John pressed his stethoscope to Sherlock’s belly as he cramped, listening for a heartbeat. “Still strong. Lie back when this contraction is over.”
The crisp, overcold air singed the hairs inside his nostrils and brought a startling clarify to the events that had just taken place. Sherlock closed his eyes and thought.
The air in the room goes very, very still. Sherlock can't look away from the box under his hand. John hovers in his liminal space, unsure whether to move towards him or turn and leave. Sherlock lurches forward, hand twitching up towards John, but he holds himself back. He sways a moment, then raises his head, meets John's eyes for one fleeting moment, and, with a terrible, shuddering gasp, he crumples.
Mrs. Hudson clucks sympathetically, wipes her eyes, and pushes past John. “My, but the flat is a bit of a mess, John. I know how it can be, preparing for—well.” She stops and swallows, and John sees briefly how frail she looks, like one wrong word could send her crumbling to the floor. He’s glad he lied. He wishes he didn’t have to. “If you need help tidying, packing things away—I would be happy to help. And meals, too. Goodness knows how busy you must be with the memorial service.” She turns to look at him, question in her eyes.
John nearly laughs at that. A little smile breaks through, an almost genuine one. “Same old, same old.” He rubs his thumb back and forth over the silky fabric of Sherlock’s dressing gown. “How are you?”
He was about to give up and switch positions when John shifted behind him, leaning up over his body. He opened his eyes and watched as John drew their firstborn closer to Sherlock’s chest, moving her and guiding her head until her lips brushed the tip of Sherlock’s fat nipple. “This might help,” he said, holding his hand under her head until she rooted forward, instinctually, and wrapped her lips around Sherlock’s nipple.
Sherlock’s smile eased the look of concentration from his face and the pace slowed a little, really luxurious now. “I don’t have the figure I used to,” he said, but there was no sense of loss to his words.
Around back behind the calf stable was a small, dark red calf, who bellowed eagerly when it saw Sherlock coming with his bottle. Sherlock easily slid the nipple into the calf's mouth, and it drank in earnest. "Whose calf is it?" John asked.
"He did seem rather appalled," Sherlock replied, smiling as well - but more at John's expression than at the bull's reaction. "He'll get over it soon. It won't take long for the band to take effect."
John presses the heels of his hands hard into his eyes in a futile attempt to suppress the hot tears streaming down his cheeks. His knees have gone weak and his head is going threateningly dizzy. Greg takes him by the shoulders and steers him into a chair, where John slumps forward, props his elbows up on his knees, and buries his face in his hands.
"Overexertion. I didn't…eat enough, for lunch. Brought more sandwiches, they're in the satchel. Get…get one for me, please?" Sherlock exhaled, his eyes closed tightly and still breathing hard.
“Yeah,” came John’s anxious reply, and a soft towel wiped at Sherlock’s skin to dry it. “Time to push?”
“The baby is crowning. You’re stretching to let it past. It will burn, it must burn. Don’t stop now,” the doctor said, harried. Sherlock could feel his hand shaking. “Small pushes, two - two seconds each. Breathe between. Small pushes.”
It all started with two pink lines. Shaking hands held the test over the bathroom sink, waiting for the last few seconds to seal his fate. The second line darkened even more as he clutched the plastic in his hands, as though to say ‘this is real.’ Sherlock looked at himself in the mirror and was surprised to see a wide smile on his face - it had crept in without him noticing, but as he noticed it grew all the wider. “So I’m going to be your mother, then,” he said, pressing a hand to his bare stomach beneath the white cotton of his t-shirt. “Take it easy on me, if you could. I’m new to all this.”
"Lunch? It can't be-" Sherlock pointed to the clock on the wall, and John frowned. "It's only 10 a.m, Sherlock, why are we eating lunch now?"
He made a plate for himself and one for John, taking care that the portions were equal on both plates. He passed John’s plate across the table and sat down in his regular chair. He’d changed into pajama pants and a plain t-shirt, and John had done the same. Just changing into comfortable clothes to prepare for their meal was enough to have John on edge, and Sherlock watched as he took the first bite.
“Sure? Of course I’m sure.” Does he sound sure? He hopes he does. He’s reasonably confident in being sure, which will have to suffice.
"Sorry," Sherlock croaks, when a contraction has passed and he is unclamping his hand from around John's wrist.
“Is that the last one?” John asked, and Sherlock’s ears flicked. He gave an experimental push, then nodded and flicked his tail in affirmation. That was it, then - after all that waiting, their kittens were all here and all healthy.
“If that’s what saves our hides, I’ll forgive you, but otherwise you owe me bigtime,” John said, sniffling and stripping off his wet trousers. Sherlock laughed until his belly ached.
“Just a moment, love,” Maggie said, clamping the newborn’s cord. “Dad, would you like the honors?” She handed John a pair of scissors and showed him where to cut. One thick slice through a rubbery cord and Joanna was her own person, and Maggie whisked her up off the bed and deposited her into Sherlock’s waiting arms.
“Close,” was all Sherlock said. John nodded, hugged Sherlock tight, and led him up and down the hallway until the next contraction came.
With tears of indignant fury rising behind his eyes, John swung one leg over the calf's neck and pinned him in place. He petted the calf and tried to soothe his pained noises when the hot burner touched his head, burning a copper ring in his white hair as the machine killed the horn bud. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry," John murmured, stroking the fighting calf's neck as Sherlock grimaced and switched sides. "It's for your own good, Gladstone, it's okay."
“It won’t hurt,” Sherlock said, and wrenched himself upright. He gasped at the pain of doing so and reached out for John. “Jesus. It must be counterproductive to have muscles get so tight when one is trying to shove an infant out of one’s body,” he groaned, letting John help him into the shower.
Sherlock never seemed to get comfortable in the box. He would get up, circle around and lay back down, lift his rear leg to lick at his inflamed vulva, then curl up only to repeat the whole activity two minutes later. Finally, something seemed to change and the cat tore the water bag open, releasing a small flood into the box.
Sherlock is lost. Days and days of denied emotion are possessing him, racking him with sobs. Every muscle in his body is wound tight with the force of his grief. How could John have ever thought this man felt nothing? The proof of his heart is plain in every spasm of anguish. How much had it taken for him to lock all this away? And how painful must it be now that it’s finally spilling out?
“Drink your soda,” John reminded, bending forward to kiss Sherlock’s full stomach. “Finish that, and I’ll suck you off, hmm?”
John counts to three. He is about to shake him again—really shake him—when Sherlock flies to life, throwing John's arms away and flinging himself at him.
“Will do.” Sherlock took a spoonful of cranberry sauce and ate it. His stomach lurched, trying desperately to reject the food he was attempting to stuff into his already stuffed organ. He swallowed despite the pain and had another spoonful, followed by a sip of water. His throat felt raw and his stomach was crammed, uncomfortable and hot. They had only a few spoonfuls left, each, and when John’s last spoonful was swallowed he collapsed back in his chair, holding his stuffed belly in both hands. Sherlock, however, struggled to stand and lurched his way to the fridge.
“God,” he rasped, roaching his back and pushing again. The contractions didn’t seem to stop now, his body clearly eager to see the last of this pregnancy, and before he could contemplate what was happening, the second baby’s body slid from his own and came to rest on the mattress. John moved quickly, scooping the baby up and bringing it to rest halfway on top of their firstborn. Sherlock’s hold fumbled a little but he was able to figure out how to hold both of them at once, cradled against his chest. In the back of his mind he realized he hadn’t come again, but he didn’t think he’d have been able to if he’d tried. His body was too exhausted to manage all of the strain and pleasure again.
John ate every bite that Sherlock did. It was a punishment, now - if Sherlock wanted to start this, damn it, he was going to finish every last bite of it. John lurched to his feet and filled their water glasses again, drinking part of his so Sherlock was forced to do the same. Sherlock took a big bite of the Yule log so John had to follow suit. Bite for bite. Swallow for swallow.
The midwife picked her up and handed her between Sherlock’s legs to John, who touched her for just a fleeting second before putting her in Sherlock’s waiting arms, cradled against his swollen stomach which had been her home for so many long months. She squalled like she was trying to wake the dead, loud enough that her cries made Sherlock’s ears ring.
"What interest would you have in feeling the foetus move?" Sherlock asked, looking over his shoulder incredulously as he set the soup pot on the stove. When he turned, John looked - really looked, for the first time in months - at Sherlock's burgeoning belly. It was full and heavy under his shirt, and John was honestly surprised at how much he'd grown when John wasn't really looking.
John munched happily on his dinner, idly reading the ads on the newspaper that served as a grease catch. Half of the classifieds seemed to be under his chips, and he uncovered each ad in turn as he ate. "Oi, is this the local paper?" he asked, and the bartender looked at him curiously before nodding.
The creak of the door wakes John immediately. It’s hardly the first time that Sherlock has crept into their room hours after John has gone to bed. After the first few times, John had stopped reacting, in the interest of more quickly getting back to sleep. This time, though, his stillness has a different quality, as if he’s afraid he’ll spook Sherlock into flight.
Sherlock had just settled Evelyn on his chest when his mobile and John’s suddenly chirped with an apparent backlog of calls and text messages. John sighed and went to pick both devices up, and immediately returned Mycroft’s call to explain the situation. “Happy Christmas, Uncle Mycroft,” he said with a grin, and heard a racket from his mother and father shouting over Mycroft on the other end of the line.
The smell of burning flesh and the sound of Gladstone's agonised bellows followed him around all day.
“That’s more than enough of that,” Sherlock said, eyes pooled black and shifting uneasily from foot to foot. John was sure that if he bent over, he’d see Sherlock’s cock rubbing hard against the bottom of his belly, so he took mercy.
Sherlock, in intense discomfort, nodded and reached for John’s hand. Their gazes met for a moment and he took a shallow breath, eyes wide and worried. John’s were equally so, but he nodded as if to say, ‘Yes, Sherlock, you can do it.’ He nodded back, closed his eyes, and waited.
Sherlock’s milk wells had filled and dropped, and his nipples were peaked, ready to nurse kittens. It seemed like his belly grew bigger with each day, and he swayed side to side when he did heave himself up to walk. The area beneath his tail grew red and inflamed.
Late pregnancy was not particularly kind to Sherlock. The maternity corset he wore was on the last of its laces, as it were, and barely fit well enough to provide the support he needed. Even with it on, he looked and felt enormous.
at Sherlock’s rim. Sherlock drew a few shallow, shaky breaths and opened his eyes, looking at John. “Even the fake heat fooled you,” he said, poking John’s hip. John’s resulting shift tugged at the place where they were joined and Sherlock let out something dangerously close to a coo of pleasure before getting himself back under control. “Didn’t think your knot would go.”
“No,” Sherlock said, feeling like an ape as he half-dangled from the back of John’s armchair. “But I’m no more comfortable any other way, and this isn’t truly awful.”
He felt the release of pressure and another rush of fluid released as her head emerged. He gasped, feeling hollow and drained, sweat beading at his brow and rolling down his forehead. “Can’t,” he said again, unable to move or shift at all to find a better position to bring her forth. His legs refused to move.
Sherlock spread his thighs wide as he could in response, panting as his belly heaved with a contraction. He moaned low in his throat and took John's hand in his own, gripping it tight as he fought not to push. Slowly, inch by inch, John could see the head emerging, and he moved his hand down to stretch the skin as the head pushed free. "That's it, Sherlock, almost out," he murmured, squeezing Sherlock's hand tight.
John quirked an eyebrow and shrugged again. "I said I didn't see any reason to argue, didn't I? It doesn't bother me as much as you seem to want it to, Sherlock. Are you sure you're not the one creating the problems here?"
Sherlock took the glass, surprised by its weight. Must be very dense - “A milkshake,” he said, licking some of the whipped cream off the top with a hum. He put the straw in his mouth and sucked. The cool liquid hit his tongue first and then slid down his throat, almost too easily to be considered an effort at all. He barely had to swallow. John toyed with the waist of his trousers as Sherlock drank, quicker at first and then more slowly as the glass emptied.
"She certainly picked a good day to give birth," Sherlock muttered, walking heavily abreast John as they trudged through the mud. "Very convenient, on several counts."
At first, he thinks Sherlock is going to continue the silent treatment. But then: “Nothing worthwhile,” he says.
“She’s perfect,” Sherlock said, tears shining on his cheeks. Joanna wailed loud and long in his arms, gradually turning pinker. Sherlock took her little fist in his hand and lifted it to his lips, kissing her tiny new fingers. “Oh, my god. John. We have a daughter. She’s so perfect.”
As another contraction gripped his middle, Sherlock knew that it would be a day of firsts for him, as well.
With the next contraction came the need to push, to expel. Sherlock’s voice, hoarse and hollow, filled his ears as he bore down, taxing his muscles even more than they’d already been taxed as he worked to birth their daughter. He felt her move within him, felt her stretching at his body that had opened for her. Her head was blunt and huge inside him.
“It’s time,” he said, his voice weak and reedy. “The baby, it’s coming. John -“ He put a hand to his middle, his nightgown wrinkled and rucked up over the full curve of his belly.
“A baby before the New Year,” he said, unable to hold back a smile, which Sherlock, in his giddy relief, returned. “I’ll gather my bag. Stay put.” He rose to his feet, pressed a fleeting kiss to Sherlock’s forehead, and dashed out of the room.
Hours passed. The vague ‘I want to squat’ feeling that Sherlock had been having for days now only got more intense as the contractions got closer together, pushing the baby down further and closer to his not-quite-ready birth canal. He alternated his time walking slowly and squatting inelegantly, hanging off the backs of furniture heavy enough to stay in place as he dropped his arse to his heels and waggled his knees back and forth. It was just enough to sate that urgent feeling, and made him feel like he was more open, at least.
Sherlock bore down again and this time the sliver of scalp that had appeared didn’t disappear - it emerged millimeter by millimeter, until the whole top of her head was in view, with dark brown hair scattered across it. John relayed the information to Sherlock, but he was too far gone in the labor to really comprehend what John was saying.
"What did you do, walk the whole way from the village? Get inside, you'll catch your death, are you mad?" Sherlock scoffed, and pulled the man roughly inside and verily slammed the door behind him. He pulled the drenched coat off and tossed it in a pile in the corner, and, ignoring the man's protests divested him of the rest of his clothing until he was standing in a puddle of wet garments, naked save for a pair of greying pants, in the entryway of Sherlock's cottage.
Sherlock took a little more time getting up on the bed. He too settled on his knees, his belly resting round and heavy on his thighs, hands spread along both sides. He opened his mouth as if to speak and then stopped, looking unsure.
“You’re properly huge now,” John said, and didn’t bother moving out of range of Sherlock’s playful slap. “I’ll rub some liniment on your legs tomorrow morning and suck you off as an apology,” he said, pulling up the sheets to cover them both. “For…both the wearing out and the rudeness,” he added as an afterthought.
After everything else John had experienced in his life, he barely batted an eye when Sherlock revealed that not only did he have ears and a tail, but that he could shift and become fully serval if a situation warranted it.
John wasn’t, either. With one lamp still on and the room quiet, he pulled Sherlock to lay with his head on his chest, safely tucked against him. “She’s going to be a good mum,” John said, running his fingers through Sherlock’s hair. “They’ll be good parents. Heads on their shoulders, like us. Even with us as bad influences, he’ll turn out to be a good kid, Sherlock.”
The cottage was still available when they called back, and John took down the address and information. Sherlock stretched out on the sofa and Joanna stretched out too, pressing her little feet into his ribs for a few seconds before his gentle hands encouraged her to curl back up. “You’ll be out of there before too long, little one,” he assured her. “Just stay put and let mummy and daddy enjoy their weekend away. We’ll meet you soon enough.”
Sherlock nodded and looped his arms around John’s neck, resting his weight on John as much as he could. His belly pressed firm and hard against John’s stomach. Within him, Joanna was still, sleeping as she waited to be born.
Sherlock felt an unexpected jolt of arousal at the sight of John leaning back and showing off his round middle. The way his t-shirt pulled tight over his abdomen, and the way John touched his stomach, was more of a turn-on than Sherlock thought it would be. He looked down and saw how his own shirt pulled tight, too, and how round his stomach had become. He prodded it gently and winced. John laughed and Sherlock looked up. “Come on, don’t stop now. You’re the one who said you wanted to eat all of this, and you’ve barely touched that plate.”
“A Christmas baby after all. She will need a name soon,” John said quietly, sitting down on the bed next to Sherlock. “Had you thought of any?”
He heard John’s breathy laugh as the roaring in his ears dulled, and reached to pull John against him as his head cleared. “Now you,” he said, grabbing a handful of John’s arse and kneading it as he guided John to rut against the damp crease of his arse. John complied, back rigid and hips rolling, and with a gasp and a familiar shudder, the Alpha came. The warmth of his spend painted Sherlock’s thighs, and he squeezed around the hard length of John’s cock, pulling a few last throbs from the thick organ before John collapsed back against the bed.
Nothing happened, and then everything happened, and her shoulders burst forth with another waterfall of fluid and the rest of her body slid from his in a rush of limbs and wetness. There was a beat of silence where all he could hear was the ringing in his own ears and then the sound of a baby’s first high wail filled the room. He tried to turn but couldn’t move his legs, and had to crane his neck to see over his shoulder.
“Well then. I see no reason to deprive you, or your body, of the delights of me and my body,” John said, wiggling his hips until Sherlock outright laughed.
“What do they look like?” John asked. “Babies, or toddlers? I - I have no idea what to expect,” he admitted.
of snow last night, Sherlock. The car’s half-buried, and the roads were hilly on the way in. I’m nervous to try and drive to town only to get stuck partway there...we’re not in great shape here, but we’d be worse off stranded on the road.”
, not talking! Not to me, not to Mycroft, not to anybody. He didn't care about the funeral. He only eats when I make him, and I'm pretty sure he only showers because it hurts less when he does. And I—shit, I need—someone who will. He's the only one who went through it all with me, and now he's all—gone. Jesus, Greg, it's like I lost them both."
"Condition, weight. Faeces on tails, indicative of worms. Bald patches, indicative of lice causing premature shedding. Everything seems in order. Ready to go back?"
When Sherlock awoke the next morning, it was to the sound of John behind him, murmuring their daughter’s name quietly with his hand on Sherlock’s belly. The baby kicked inside him, the movement just barely able to be felt - but she was growing stronger every day.
Fact: Sherlock loathed the idea of handing his newborn infant to a couple he didn't know, to raise it in a way he was certain wouldn't be up to his standards.
With John’s help he moved to lie on his side, and John moved in kind to lie behind him. Their daughter was pulled to Sherlock’s chest, Sherlock lending her his warmth and taking comfort from the closeness of their firstborn. It took only a few minutes for strong contractions to come again, and though this time the pleasure was more muted, it was still there.
Even Mycroft is showing the strain, though. The lines around his eyes seem more pronounced, and there's a hint of redness and swelling there that betrays his lack of sleep.
Soren looked at his papa, then his daddy, and then his little brother, then carefully leaned over to press a feather-light kiss on the baby’s forehead. Reuben wrinkled his nose and let out a milky huff, and Soren erupted into a peal of laughter. “Hi, Reuben,” he said, giggling and settling down next to Sherlock. The Omega looped his arm around Soren’s shoulders, holding him close.
John has always thought it unfair when it rains at funerals, as if the family needs something else to go wrong. But he can’t deny that there’s a certain obscene quality to lowering someone into the ground on a bright, sunny day. At the very least, he figures they merit clouds. Instead, the sun is bright and the weather unseasonably pleasant.
“Trust me, Sherlock Holmes,” John said, sipping his mug of tea and looking at his husband over the rim of it. “I know just how lucky I am that you love me.”
Sherlock went quiet as John worked, apparently enjoying the relief John’s expert foot rub provided. John finished off the toes of the left foot and was satisfied to see some of the swelling had gone down, the skin a little pink as blood flow rushed to areas previously blocked off. He patted Sherlock’s ankle and moved the other one into his lap, then glanced upward and stopped short.
“Me, too. But wait just a few more days, love, until we’re home. You’ll have to wait until next year to spend your first official Christmas with mum and dad, little one.” John bent down and kissed Sherlock’s belly and then helped him into his shirt. Sherlock laid down and John curled up behind him, kissing the back of his neck, and in a few minutes they were both asleep.
John's chores got marginally easier as time went on, with Gladstone long weaned and Marjorie dried off. The sheep, Sherlock said, would last the winter without John's help, so his duties were over until lambing season began.
“You know, you didn’t have much trouble finishing the soda,” John mused. “I could get you some more to drink. Really top you up. Or fill you up from…the other end,” he suggested, and Sherlock moaned quietly. They hadn’t done that much, but the few times they had, it had been an enlightening experience. John seemed to figure out which of the two options made Sherlock the most eager, and he rubbed Sherlock’s stomach a little roughly. “We could try the whipped cream again. Since you seem to be enjoying air pressure today.” Sherlock nodded, still fondling his cock, his other hand on his belly. “We’ll need to move to the bed, though.”
John can’t do much more than grunt in surprise. He takes hold of Sherlock’s hips and finds he’s naked from the waist down. Sherlock pulls back to strip off his shirt.
John sat down next to the tub, one arm around Sherlock’s shoulders, watching their daughter sleep. “I can’t believe you did that,” he said, shaking his head and speaking quietly, not wanting to wake the baby. “You just delivered our daughter in the tub of a rental cottage in Wareham on Christmas Day. I think I remember saying that this trip wasn’t the craziest thing we’ve ever done...but I think I was wrong.”
“It must only eat yours, Soren, because I haven’t lost a sock in the whole time I’ve lived here,” Sherlock said with a grin. “It must just like the taste of little boy socks.”
John left the last of his bills on the counter and shrugged back into his still-wet coat, stuffing his soaked shirt into his duffel and steeling himself against the impending weather. Baker Place was just a few miles' walk from the pub, and he'd rather make the journey in the rain and have a warm bed tonight than stiffen up in some motel room and not be able to walk in the morning. He pulled his hood up and opened the door, heading out into the storm.
As he watched his cow lick her new heifer calf clean, Sherlock leaned back against the wall, hands rubbing his belly all over. John was watching the newborn in awe, and Sherlock had to admit, it was a unique experience; this baby calf was taking its first breaths, her mother licking her clean, and soon, she would have her first meal. First steps, first weak moo - it was a day of firsts.
“Yule log,” Sherlock replied, grabbing the plate and putting it down between them. “We said we were going to eat it all. We won’t have eaten it all if we don’t eat this.”
He didn't even realise John had left to do chores until an urgent tapping on his shoulder rousted him. "Uh, Sherlock? I think Marjorie's in labour, um, I don't know what to do."
Sherlock opens his eyes. John is sitting on the bed next to him, cradling a bundle of blankets. Wordlessly, Sherlock holds out his arms, and John lays their baby in them with heartrending care.
“Suppose that’s true,” John said, and retracted his offered pasta to eat himself. Sherlock noticed that John suddenly looked a little concerned, and he huffed.
Sherlock scoffed. "Oh god, no. Wool's worthless. You're the first person I've seen in years wearing a wool jumper." John looked down at his jumper and was about to defend himself when Sherlock continued. "No, the birds will pick it up and use it in nests, or it will gradually decompose. What farmers used to get pounds for is now costing them to produce. Wool's gone out of style," he finished, and then looked at John's jumper once more. "Obviously."
“Mmm.” Sherlock watched Joanna for a moment longer, then shifted his gaze to John. “You look good as a dad.”
John chuckled and gave Sherlock a peck on the cheek before he left the house, promising to be back before dark. He patted Gladstone on his head - "you big brute, you're growing like a bloody weed." - on his way to the dust-covered sheet in the shed. He pulled it off and gaped.
“Oh, John,” she replies thickly. “It’s okay, dearie. I knew you’d talk when you were ready. How is Sherlock holding up?”
When John disappeared out of the box stall, Sherlock let himself have a few moments to whine low in his throat. His stomach was rock hard and suddenly so low he could hardly stand it, his baby dropping into position and making him feel heavy and slow. "Christ, baby, you picked a very opportune time, didn't you?" he muttered, and pressed a hand to his low belly.
After a few moments of stunned silence from John, Sherlock looked up. The ex-soldier had set his coffee cup down heavily on the tabletop and was holding his head in his hands, shoulders heaving with great inhalations of breath. "John?"
But instead, Sherlock rolls back over onto his side again. He doesn’t say anything, but John knows that his invitation into Sherlock’s space has been withdrawn. Stinging, he gets up and goes.
It was the better part of an hour later when all the food was re-heated and on the table. A roast turkey, mashed potatoes with gravy, brussels sprouts, far too many Yorkshire puddings, stuffing, and cranberry sauce. There was also part of a Yule log in the refrigerator, should they be able to clear all of the main meal away first. That would be a tall order, Sherlock thought, looking at the spread of food in front of them.
“A walk?” John said half an hour later, still as incredulous as he’d been when Sherlock first suggested it. “Sherlock, you can barely stand on your own. A walk will do you in.”
"So you're not as dense as I initially thought. Congratulations." The look of shock disappeared as quickly as it had come, and the man once again looked stony-faced. "Well, John Watson, congratulations. You've found yourself employment for the next few months. Make yourself comfortable on the couch, there are spare blankets in the cupboard and we'll figure out rooming tomorrow. Good night." The man rose from the couch, and now John could see the slight bump on his middle. As he was about to disappear from sight, John stood up and called out.
