He steeled his resolve as The Warrior walked over. “Heya, Castiel,” Dean said, “any words for the paper?”
“How?” He turned now to Gabe. “You said it yourself, a whole army of angels was barely able to do it last time. How do three of us, cut off from heaven, stand a chance?”
He opened his puffy eyes and looked over Charlie’s shoulder at his backpack. The tablet was in there. He had tried to get rid of it. He’d tried to dump it in Pennsylvania, in Virginia, and in Kentucky. But for some reason, he just couldn’t.
~~~~~
Gabriel shot her a petulant face. “Really powerful prophets can sense the tablets. A powerful enough prophet, especially right after being activated and especially if within a few miles of a tablet, would be drawn to the tablet, seeking it out before even knowing really what it is.”
“Dean, I’m so sorry,” Castiel said, coming to stand in front of him.
Renegade stepped out of the house with two detectives and they came to join Castiel and Archangel on the lawn out front. Dean had been watching the other two since they’d stepped outside with a detective and begun speaking with some of the forensic techs outside. After a brief discussion between the three detectives and the three Angels, one of the detectives with Renegade pulled aside the detective that had come out earlier and began talking with her. The other detective brought Renegade over to the three forensics techs he was speaking with. Castiel and Archangel were looking around, and Archangel caught sight of Dean watching them.
Swallowing his pride and dislike, he raised his hand and knocked twice.
“The PR job’s gonna pick up soon. Now, I know you took this job when you weren’t doing much ‘round here but twiddling your thumbs, but Charlie’s predicting these Angel stories’ll be picking up. You sure you wanna continue?”
He got his car keys and walked out to his car, eager to meet Benny that night and unwind a bit after today.
“See ya.” Dean hung up.
The hood was lifted off his face. Kevin looked around. It seemed like he was in a limo or something. In the seat in front of him, facing him, was the man dressed in all black from the bus station. Sitting on either side of him were the two people who had been flanking him.
Dean sighed and tilted his head up from where he’d been laying it on the desk. “Yeah, oh well.” He had been the one to offer to answer questions people had for the newspaper.
“Neither do you,” Eileen levelled her husband with a fond look.
Cas smiled softly again. “It has been the greatest privilege of my life, my existence, to watch you grow old. I feel honored that you allowed me to experience that. Time’s different for me too,” Cas kissed Dean’s hand, “Space and time were never precious to me, not in the stretch of infinity. Not until you. Not until I was able to see you live your life and live it well.”
The figure of Dean left, but Lucas stayed and was joined by his mother, Dean remembered her too. They embraced, and the figure of Lucas grew, changed into a young man, a husband, a father. Soon a half dozen figures were standing there, waving to Dean, and then they disappeared, melting back into water. Lucas was the last to go as he was the first to arrive. He signed a phrase to Dean, and Dean knew the words: Thank you, Dean Winchester.
Dean shook his head slightly, “Not fair.”
“Okay so maybe I’m overestimating your abilities a little,” Dean held up a hand, “But still, I… I like this,” he gestured to the space between them and around them, “I like us. I like waking up to a clean kitchen and sleeping in on weekends. I like not having to ask more than one person whether or not I can take a drive by myself or crank my music really loud at midnight. And I fucking hate
He felt the bed move as Cas climbed under the covers with him. The angel curled around him, enveloping him. Dean could swear he felt the brush of feathers cradling him and pulling him closer, but he couldn’t muster the ability to reach for them, stroke them like he used to. “Sleep, Dean. I’ll be here when you wake up. Wherever, whenever here is. That’s where I’ll be. Wherever you go, I’ll go with you.”
Dean looked back to Cas in confusion, but he didn’t look alarmed. He gave Dean a timid smile, kissed him behind his ear, and whispered, “Just watch.”
Dean watched. For a moment, the scenery couldn’t seem to decide what it wanted to be. Then, it decided not to decide. Grains of sand took the form of towering trees, a picnic table, a bench. Green lake water formed the shape of a small boy, hunched over and scribbling on the table. Lastly the wheat twirled and spun and became an all-too-familiar-looking young man wearing a jacket too big for his frame, walking over to the bench and sitting down across from the kid.
, Dean remembered, blushing at the memory.
“Dean,” Cas said, rubbing the back of Dean’s liver spot-covered hand, “Please listen to me very carefully.”
Dean turned, looking from the space Jack had stood back to Cas then back again, “What-”
“Old, but not a bastard.”
. Your job is done.
“We?”
After some time, longer than he’d like to admit, Dean sniffed, wiped one hand over his face, and raised his head. Cas was waiting for him, looking at him with care. With love.
Dean did.
“For how long?”
But just as soon as he’d reached the end of that thought, it wasn’t the ocean anymore. It was a lake. On the lake was a pier. He’d seen that pier before, couldn’t remember exactly where though.
“Okay, fine, I promise,” Dean took a step forward and leaned in for a kiss then. Castiel could taste the beer on Dean’s tongue and sighed. Dean smiled against Castiel’s lips, lowering his voice to a comical level, “We could, uh, you know, try and
“You don’t mind that I’m a wrinkly, senile, crotchety old bastard?” Dean had asked, more than once, but he had always said it with a smile. And Castiel would smile back, replying with the same answer the answer many times, in many ways:
“Dean,” he turned around to face Cas whose brows were knit in worry, bright blue eyes narrowed, “Are you okay?” Dean realized he hadn’t seen Cas clearly for a few years, not since before the cataracts. He’d never gotten completely used to that piercing gaze.
“Wow. Um, loaded question there, Cas.”
think you would be.”
The abrupt return of Dean’s panicked look made Cas smile a little, shake his head, "Not
"Right. Of course, yeah,” Dean looked around, down the road, the back to his car, out past the waving grain that had returned inexplicably. “Well,” Dean flashed what he thought was a very convincing smile, letting Cas’s hands go as he tossed the keys once and caught them, heading towards the car, “Time to hit the road, huh?”
He twirled them around the end of his finger a couple times, a thought itching at his brain. Or a couple dozen thoughts.
“How is he?” Eileen asked, but she was smiling, so she knew the answer.
“You… don’t want to have some of your own?” Castiel had asked carefully, taking the beer Dean held out for him.
When Dean died, at the ripe old age of 85, he knew what to expect.
Dean hesitated, but under Cas’s stare, relented. When he was settled, Castiel laced their fingers together.
Dean looked over at him, and Cas was smiling.
“Yeah, but I don’t
you.”
“He’s good,” Castiel smiled back, “Getting what he deserves.”
Dean caught the keys on instinct, they jingled on the simple ring.
He sighed. "I just…” Dean ran a hand through his hair, “I don't know, I guess it just don't sit right that I’m… I'm gonna see Mom and Bobby and Jo and Charlie and… everyone. How am I going to look them in the face and not feel guilty that I got decades that they’ll never have? And what did I do with that time, sit on my ass? Judge local car shows? Go to freaking baseball games?"
Castiel sighed, taking a swig of his beer, considering his words. “I’m an angel, Dean-”
“I’m not usually here to meet people who pass on, but we weren’t going to miss your arrival.”
“Want to what?”
The phrase, “I don’t think we’re in Kansas anymore” popped into his head, but he suspected, greatly, that he was, in fact, in Kansas. The blowing fields of wheat tipped him off to that.
want kids?”
Then without warning, but without alarm, Dean saw someone standing on the end of the dock. A young man with light brown hair and a sweet smile Dean would recognize anywhere.
Then the sand reformed into a schoolgirl, the shapes in the green water plaguing her with images of mirrors and Bloody Marys until Dean stepped in front of her, holding a mirror of grain in front of the cruel, refracted specter. It dissolved, and Dean’s form bade goodbye, but the girl remained. She grew too just like the boy did, becoming a professor, graduating with honors, writing dozens of books, and changing dozens of lives. She smiled, and waved, and dissolved as well.
Jack suddenly blipped into existence, giving Castiel two big thumbs up, then blipped out again.
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean saw movement. The endless sea became endless plains which became endless trees, the landscape changing at a rapid rate.
“Cas, could you quit monologuing for a second and-”
But Castiel smiled, giving Sam’s shoulder one last firm squeeze. “You will.”
Eventually, the images and figures departed. The sand blew away, the waters swirled and dispersed, and the landscape made its final decision. Only a simple field of golden wheat remained, waving and rippling in the wind.
“Swear?”
And as the crowned Cool Uncle, he teased Sam mercilessly about his minivan and his “#1 Dad” mugs, but Castiel knew how proud Dean was of him too. How glad he was that Sam got the future he wanted, and how grateful he was that that future included him.
Castiel smiled, “I’d rather be here with you. Always have.”
“Do you think you’d be a good father?”
Castiel shook his head. “No, but someone will be here soon.”
“I don’t mind.”
come next. And this is it, right? No more resets?”
Cas nodded.
His brain was sure full of them gummy worms now as he clung to his body and to his life. He wasn’t completely sure where he was. Bobby’s? The bunker? His childhood home? Sammy had come to see him earlier, at least the kid had looked like Sammy… No, fuck, that was his grand-nephew, Cas had reminded him of that. Sam, his brother Sam, was in the next room. That's right, he’d told the asshole to give him some space, stop smothering him. He sort of wished he was here now though. And Cas, Cas was here, he knew that, but only because the angel was right in front of him. Cas, his friend, was holding Dean’s hand, talking about what their grand-nieces and nephews were doing in school. Dean could swear he already knew these things, but they still sounded new when Cas said them.
“I’m here,” Cas’s hand went to Dean’s cheek, holding him in a kiss. They separated, foreheads resting against each other. Cas’s eyes twinkled, “We had an appointment.”
“It’s not about deserving, Cas,” Dean had said, half-whispered in the middle of the night a few short months after they had begun to share the bed they laid in. “It’s… fuck, well I don’t know what it’s about. But people don’t get what they deserve, not most of the time.”
It was Eileen who noticed Castiel first as he entered the hospital room the day he'd been informed that Sam Winchester was finally coming home. He didn't have to tell Eileen; she saw it on Castiel's face. They’d already spoken, he’d prepared her for the eventuality a few days prior. Eileen smiled, looking back at her husband, teasing him lightly, but Castiel knew she was holding back on her usual snark because Sam looked, well, tired. Turning away from Sam, Eileen signed, “Are you here for him?”
an option,” Dean leaned back against the counter, “I think we can agree on that. Second of all, you didn’t answer my question.”
But he didn’t want to pay. He wanted it for free, every day and every night. He wanted Dean to want him back, not just for Dean’s Omega to lust after Castiel’s Alpha simply because they happened to be in the same room for more than five minutes.
“I’d add some fresh milk though, to dunk the buns right in.”
But he did want them off. On his wooden floors preferably.
The Alpha gritted his teeth, and kneaded Dean’s ass, head lowered in defeat.
Dean chuckled and rolled his eyes, taking the seat across from Castiel. With his chin perched on his hand and pouty lips glossy, he said, “She’s going to give me an F anyway.”
Dean made a sound in the back of his throat and it nearly made him choke. After a small coughing fit with Cas’ hand rubbing circles over his back. Seeing Dean so flustered usually warranted some affectionate teasing from Castiel, but this time he kept his comments to himself. Hurting Dean’s ego was not something he dared risk right now.
Being enveloped in the heat of Dean’s ass cheeks, cock or face, was paradise, and he didn’t lie when he said Dean’s hole was impatient. At the first lick around the rim, it trembled, as did Dean above.
“Go on, princess. Getting hungrier by the second, and I have a feeling my little friend is getting impatient too.” Above Cas, Dean’s asshole was palpitating obscenely, the muscle fighting to unfurl once again, enticing the observer to either lavish it with caring attentions or wreck it until it was a gaping mess. It just wanted and wanted and wanted, the slut’s hole longed for a cock to fill it, or a tongue to fuck it or a vibrator to punish it or a plug to seal in Cas’ cum when Dean went to class. Fuck, was Dean slutty.
“I - Dean. We shouldn’t.”
. There was no reason for him to be. Maybe strong emotions affected him to the point of triggering his slick-production, a confused body believing irate excitement was mere mating foreplay, or perhaps the adrenaline was comparable to the frenzy caused by a mating chase?
“Do you know I’ve fucked every single Alpha in your year, Cas?” Dean licked the seam of Castiel’s lips and mewled, hugging the Alpha tightly, humping his oozing dickhead against Castiel’s stomach. “Every single senior has been balls-deep inside me, Cas. Everyone except you.”
Now, that Dean slept around was a well-known fact, and everyone who bedded him had nothing but praises for the boy. That or streaks of jealous possessiveness coursing through their veins, or both. But as much as Dean loved taking it up the ass (and, if rumors were true, he loved it to the point of being a total cockslut for it), not once did the Omega let any Alpha knot him, not even Cassie, an Alpha with whom he seemed particularly smitten.
“Was I in this dream, Dean?” he asked.
His brain had made the right call by waking him up at the crack of dawn. Blessed be early risers.
“You think I’m a slut.” Dean said with storming fire illuminating his pupils.
The rest was history.
Dean groaned and finally, finally sat on Castiel’s face. Cas hands immediately went to the ample cheeks, all ten fingers splayed open but still unable to cover the whole expanse of the boy’s ass.
“You think I’m a slut and you don’t want me anymore. You think I’m dirty.”
“I… Okay, yes. I can do that. I’ll be your slut today, babe.”
“Oh, Cas!” Dean whined in an instant’s respite, rising on trembling thighs up to the very tip of Castiel’s cock, contracting the tight ring of muscle around the Alpha’s enlarged cockhead, then plopping all the way down without a hint of finesse. He took it so well, not complaining or showing indications of pain or discomfort, making it obvious he’d had plenty of practice.
“No. No. That’s not it, Dean.”
"Excuse my staring and this may come off as a cheap excuse, but would you believe me if I said I was honestly mesmerized by your beauty?"
“Care to tell me what this dream was about?”
He probably should've been embarrassed, and to some degree he was, but Castiel was also man who went after what he wanted. He always gave his best to achieve his goal, whatever it happened to be. In that moment, he wanted nothing more than that juicy ass impaled on his cock, those voluptuous curves pulling him deep into their hotness, and the man clawing at his bedsheets, shouting for Castiel to fuck him harder and faster, begging to be debased.
He started his morning prayer with a peck at the top of Dean’s crack and makes his way down, down, nuzzling like a damn dog sniffing at bitch in heat. It was an appropriate comparison, but not one he’d share with Dean, yet. His boyfriend still struggled to admit he was a bit of a slut.
Ah, yes. There it was, the mischievous glint in Dean’s eyes. The boy wanted to be pushed, he wanted to have someone else do the dirty work so there was nothing left for him, but do as he was told. He was the freest when cornered. Dean used it as an excuse, of course, but Cas knew this was the best approach to getting Dean Winchester to open up.
Comfortably seated at the teacher’s desk, Castiel was browsing his phone notifications when he heard the door open, and the wave of fragrant scent that hit him was unequivocal as were the final echoes of the laugh he daydreamed on the daily, much to his chagrin.
He sat Dean sideways on his thighs and ignored the throbbing of his slick-wetted cock.
Having Dean’s lush ass right on one’s face could be a suffocating experience, but Castiel, never one to lose his cool, would even out his breathing, splaying both hands over Dean’s ass, pulling the globes apart to gain better entrance. At first the ring of muscle was always timid, as was its owner above, but then it gave, and once it got, it asked for more. The act never got old, as familiar as they both, –well, three, Dean’s ass seemingly having a life of its own– were with it.
“’kay” Dean said, and the short reply dragged in the air like a purr.
His tongue flicked against Dean’s, and Castiel dug deeper, grazing the soft ridges at the roof of the younger boy’s mouth. Castiel opened up, lips pulling Dean’s mouth closer, teeth clashing. The Alpha was past the need of oxygen, all he needed was the sweet taste of Dean flooding his senses. For his part, the Omega was pliant, mouth yielding to the fevered attacks, yet moving in tandem. Each time Castiel sucked in, Dean moaned and pulled back, inviting the other to charge at him again and again.
Voice higher than usual, he objected “No! Cas, I could never!”
“Are they saying I’m a slut, Cas? Is that it? Are they saying I sleep with every Alpha that says ‘hello’ to me? That so much as looks my way?”
Castiel smacked Dean’s ass three times before the boy choked out a feeble ‘yes’.
Castiel sighed and propped on his elbows, pulled in by the lewd display. He tongued at a new gush of slick straight from the source. Dean pushed back a little, and more liquid flowed from his entrance. Castiel sucked gently at the hole, and fondled Dean’s balls, careful not to press too hard, just enough to coax more slick from Dean. If he could have just this for the rest of his days, he’d die a happy man.
Miracle barked again, this time more animatedly.
That anyone would always be Castiel though. He’d make sure of it.
“Cas!” Dean protested scandalized, as if he hadn’t begged shamelessly just minutes ago for Castiel to suck his asshole, as if he weren’t playing bouncy that same instant.
"’Course I do!” was Dean’s amused response.
Since that moment, and with every day that passed, Castiel accepted how out of his league Dean Winchester was. Not wanting to be part of the Omega’s mob of followers, he kept to himself, never spoke with Dean if he could help it (and being a year above him helped greatly on that front) and avoided their paths and eyes from crossing, although this latter had occurred more than Castiel was comfortable with.
“I want you. I do. And I don’t care if you fucked the whole school, Dean. Or the whole town. I don’t care. I still want you. Have wanted you ever since I first saw you. But I was a coward, and I got scared. Never thought you’d- This wasn’t part of my plans, Dean. You were a fantasy, and I felt guilty, so I avoided you. I’m sorry, sweet Omega. Never meant to hurt you.”
The green of Dean’s eyes glittered like emeralds in the sun, and the pink tint on his skin rose in brightness, as if he were lit from within. The Omega looked down, rubbing the back of his neck and shifted in his seat. “Thanks? But regardless of my lousy writing and your most-welcomed, grade-A assistance, she
And as they said love came in all shapes and sizes. By extension, Castiel’s love was round and large. It was perfect.
“No! No, I mean- Ah, ah,
“Congratulations on completing the set then.”
“Y-yes.” He agreed.
“No. No, Cas. Got it wrong. I-?”
They got inside the shower together, warm water splashing against the glass doors and washing away sweat, cum and the reek of sex that seemed to emanate from their pores. Cas motioned for Dean to turn around, and Dean twirled obediently, standing still –for the most part. He seemed all too eager to rub (accidentally) his soapy-wet ass against Castiel’s front– as Cas lathered him with a sugary-scented shower gel, all the way down his neck and back, over his chest, teasing pebbled nipples, below his arms, then his belly, his bloated little cock, the crevice of his ass.
No response.
Most times, a dripping Omega meant an aroused Omega, but Dean couldn’t be aroused like
slept with Mrs. Roberts’ husband. The Omega had stumbled upon the couple at some shop downtown, and Dean had let the man grope him behind a shelf, but nothing more. It wasn’t Dean’s fault the man was obsessed.
“So now she wants… revenge?”
They spoke of everything, eager to know each other better.
Nothing.
“This is what you wanted, Dean? You wanted my knot, baby?”
Right. One step a time.
, for wanting you. You receive a lot of attention, is all.”
“Talk” he said, the word stifled by the skin it reverberated against.
“Dean?”
Cas could not have found a more perfect boyfriend in a million years.
On steady feet, the Alpha took them back to the chair, and there they remained placidly locked until Castiel’s knot deflated.
Surely he was misinterpreting Dean. Dean was beautiful and striking, and he could have anyone. To think he’d been waiting for him of all Alphas... It was a ridiculous pipedream, one of his most innocent fantasies, but doubtlessly the most dangerous of all.
In conclusion, ever since they met Cas had been irrationally attracted to Dean’s ass. And that was before getting acquainted with the dusty pink rosebud tucked safely in-between. His personal little treasure.
Cas chuckled and wrapped a hand around himself to pump his aching cock and provide it some respite. But first, he needed to get Dean fully on board with his plan.
It’d require some time, but sooner or later, Dean would cave in and he’d become every bit a slut as Castiel knew he already was. A happy, big-assed slut.
From a quick glance below the waist, the front package wasn't bad either. A rather subtle bulge for a dick curved upwards, cushioned by nice-sized balls. Cute. The tightness of the shorts gave him a cameltoe.
Baby steps, he reminded himself.
"Verdict?" he asked, raising an eyebrow.
Taking all this into account, Castiel had no clue how Dean did it, fuck his way through school, and not take a single knot, or get pregnant for that matter. From what he knew, the boy was not on the pill either. It was no wonder whatsoever that he reeked so deliciously.
Castiel too was an Alpha. A healthy 18 year old Alpha in his senior year of high school, ready to graduate, move out of town and go to college. He had also been crushing on Dean since he'd first seen the boy three years ago during lunch time, when the Omega walked through the cafeteria double-doors with a spring in his step and playfulness in his eyes, taking everything in with fascination, as if he was actually happy to be in a poorly-ventilated room packed with hungry and boisterous teenagers. Castiel hadn’t been the only one to gape at Dean in awe back then, forks and spoons stopped their clattering and the typical hubbub quieted down. It didn’t take long for a junior from the football team to approach Dean, and soon the boy was being guided, the stranger’s keen hand on the small of his back, to the team’s table.
"What do you need, Mrs. Roberts?"
Dean squirmed and Cas pulled back a little.
Castiel blabbered as well, but he couldn’t register the words his mouth spoke. He had a single mission: knot his omega and satisfy his needs.
A sleepy Dean, Cas had come to learn, was much less inhibited than a fully awake one.
His sweet-musky scent, charged with concentrated pheromones made it seem as though he was constantly on the brink of his heat. Most other Omegas envied him or tried to imitate him. Betas admired him, confused due to their lack of olfactory senses, yet were unquestioningly pulled by Dean’s undeniable allure. And Alphas... Alphas fell at his feet like drunken fruit flies, circling the Omega like a swarm of moths chasing the only source of light in a pitch-black abyss, and so, so many tried courting him properly, to make him into their mate and enjoy a lifetime of savoring his addictive scent and, by extension, his even-more-so addictive slick. A lifetime of fucking him silly.
“Dean, this is not news to you, so don’t act so shocked.” Dean rolled his eyes but didn’t say a word, not that there was anything he could say in his defense. “Now, you were going to show me something, right?”
“Nothing worth repeating. Envious lies.”
“I- No.”
Dean smiled sheepishly at him and lowered his stare, nervous and self-conscious. Castiel lifted his chin with a finger and tried to help him out, navigating with ease the sea of Dean’s awkwardness.
And there it was, that delicious, almost painful squeeze around his member: Dean’s ass gradually opening itself to house its first knot.
So, there he’d been, in his early morning run, steps matching the beat of the music ringing through his earbuds, when he saw the most delectable and lewd of scenes, what people called a bubble-butt, barely concealed by a pair of cherry-red booty shorts. Cas was suddenly hypnotized by what the scanty piece fabric struggled to cover, by those constrained cheeky ass-cheeks peeking from below the hem, folding deliciously over thick hamstrings, and resulting in a very well-defined underbutt crease.
The end.
No argument there then.
Dean spoke between snivels, his runny nose making him take pauses to carry on. “You’re never around. I’ve tried, for years, but you wouldn’t even look at me, and then it was like you were hiding from me or somethin’. You disappeared. Talking to you was impossible, so I got tired. My heats were getting real bad, and I -I wanted to forget you, and it’s stupid, but I thought I’d make you jealous, sleeping with other Alphas. But, I’m s-sorry, so sorry.” Dean nuzzled closer, nose inhaling Cas’ scent, “I fucked up, but it felt so good, getting fucked. Didn’t mean to, but I got hooked on it. And I love it Cas, I love it. I know everyone says I’m a cockslut, and it’s fucking true. Getting on my knees, having my throat fucked, god! And I love when I get bent over, and a thick cock fucks me hard and fast; love the stretch, the burn, heavy balls slapping against my ass. I just- And I love the sounds, the fucking dirty sounds, squelches and -and slapping, my asshole sloppy and greedy slurping for a fat cock. Gets me so wet, Cas. Just thinking ‘bout it, has me slicking. I’m always wet, need to change my panties at least twice. But I -I wanted them to be you, all of them. All those Alphas, those dicks. But they
His stomach growled. Cas deemed it perfectly suitable to satiate the most primal of needs, hunger. So, he did.
Dean simply stared; fiery annoyance turned coy bashfulness.
To his surprise Dean didn’t make him wait or turn him down. Cas held the handshake longer than necessary or acceptable, locking eyes with Dean and causing the younger man to blush under the scrutiny. This was neither a casual nor a forgettable encounter, and Cas wanted the man –Dean, to know that.
Castiel couldn’t think, could barely breathe. He bucked up his hips to meet Dean halfway, and it didn’t take much for his Alpha and Dean’s Omega to achieve a comfortable, forceful pace, dragging and thrusting. Were they naked, Castiel’s cock would be buried to the hilt in Dean’s tight channel, filling him like he deserved and loosening his hole stroke after stroke.
He brushed lightly Dean’s swollen little penis with the back of a finger and leaned over to kiss Dean’s freckled shoulder.
The borderline vulgar vision had Cas slowing down to a trot and biting the inside of his cheek, hands itching with the need to have his way with the stranger’s curvy ass. He strolled behind for a while without a hurry, flagrantly admiring the harmonious sway of the man’s hips as well as the juddering swing of the raunchy spheres he had for an ass.
Dean started a circular grinding motion, but Castiel needed to tread carefully and remain a gentleman. “Stop that, please. I don’t know if I could stop myself, Dean. I want you too much.”
That was such a nice dream, and Dean had done so well describing it while he was being rimmed within an inch of his life. Cas was so proud of his boy. He dug deeper into Dean’s hole with his digit, until he scarcely grazed it, that sweet spot that would have Dean seeing stars and emptying the heavy load trapped in his balls.
“Hey, Dean? Look at me.”
give me an F. There’s no way I’m passing that crap.”
Cas didn’t even have to push Dean’s legs apart to settle comfortably between them, the boy slept with them open. Again, nature seemed adamant in making Dean a creature meant to be debauched. If any one person were to come in and saw Dean sleeping like that, bow legs spread carelessly, the creamy mounds of his ass extending like fertile hills to be plowed and plundered, the boy would rouse to a cock crowing sweet good mornings inside his rectum.
Just a single look, years ago, and Dean had turned Castiel’s world upside-down. Now, with his sweet touch, he was setting it upright once more. The course Castiel’s life was meant to take, was the one that led him to Dean.
Dean was smart, but he needed discipline and guidance to make some choices.
Dean knew it too. He just needed a little confidence boost to acknowledge it.
Dean’s mouth fell open and he reached back with a hand to pull Cas’ hair. Next thing, the young man was forcing Castiel’s face against his ass, sobs and broken words tumbling out of him in husky tones as he canted his hips back and forth, left and right.
One time too many.
Dean sighed contented and joined Castiel’s hand around the older man’s engorged shaft, tugging at it with long, resolved pumps. If Castiel was an ass guy, then the sexy little thing lying beside him, panting and fidgeting, throwing a leg in between Cas’ to hump away his afterglow, was indisputably a cock guy. With Dean’s newly added friction against his thigh and the warm puffs of his labored breathing trickling into Castiel’s ear like liquid sex, he felt the familiar heat pooling low in belly.
That perked Castiel’s attention, and he crawled up on the bed to lie next to Dean and have a face-to-face conversation.
But the comment lingered in Cas’ mind, and there he was, wide awake as the first rays of sunlight broke in through the window, pondering the power Dean’s attributes had on him. Or, thinking of ass first thing in the morning. Again. It’s not like he was unaware of how much he liked it –no, not liked. Straight up worshipped. Adored. Loved. How could he not know it when every single day Castiel sought new ways to claim it, to own it?
Fuck if he knew. The Alpha basked in the scent, unmoving. Paralyzed.
“So good, Cas.” Wanna feed you every morning, Cas. Wanna wake up with you inside me, your cock splitting me open, fucking me so hard I cry and beg, but you ignore me and make me take it harder, faster, because you know I like it rough. You know me so well, better than I know myself. Would you come inside me then, Cas? Fill me with your seed? Would you kiss my slutty little asshole and slurp your come out of me or would you make me keep it inside all day? I love making out with you after you eat my ass, love tasting myself on your mouth. So filthy, fuck. But I can’t help it. It’s all I want. So horny, all the time. Would let you fuck me when we first met, Cas. In that park, not caring about being seen. Oh, I’d let you mount me like a heated bitch. Like your bitch. Oh, Cas, I’m such a slut, I know I am, I know! And you do know it too, Cas. You fucking love it. “Love you, Cas.”
Dean remained silent, but scents spoke louder than words. Too bad Castiel didn’t know what to make of it, of the scent of fresh Omega slick in this very non-sexual, emotionally at odds scenario.
be a next time) he’d bite his neck hard enough to draw blood, effectively staking his claim as the Omega’s one and only mate. His Alpha.
It was impossible not to guess where this was heading, but Cas didn’t push. Beaming he indicated for Dean to straddle him, and the boy plopped heavy and playfully atop his chest, punching the air out of him.
The young man leaned down to ruffle the hair on his pet’s head, and said, “What say you, Miracle? Think we can trust him?”
“Right.”
Castiel chuckled and rolled his eyes, feeling pity for the man. He was just as obsessed as the old pervert, but he was fortunate enough that Dean wanted him back.
Through scraps and snippets, but always against his will, Castiel learned that Dean belonged to the kind of Omega who refused to wear blockers, which explained why his scent was so potent. He also learned that Dean liked classic rock and cheesy pop songs equally, was admitted in the cheerleaders team without presenting the test, that he swung both primary-sex ways, and that he was infamous (yet adored) amongst Alphas for being an incorrigible knottease.
"Dude, you think I’m fucking stupid? You were friggin’ leering at my butt. Raw-dogging me in your mind, I bet. So whatever crap you’re saying it’s only because you wanna get in my pants."
“Tell me Dean, were you a cock-loving slut in this dream?”
It was process, Cas told himself. And he’d be there every step of the way for his boy.
“Leggings or not, you’ll still be turning heads wherever we go, darling. And I know that you want attention, but there’s literally no need to advertise your ass for everyone to see you. Besides, you have me already, and I think your legs would look just as good if you wore a burlap sack. Now go and change into something decent, okay?”
Cas appreciated honesty and directness. He liked that Dean called him out, even if he was only partially correct. Yes, he wanted to fuck Dean, but he had also been physically unable to tear his gaze away. No, he was not lying just to get in Dean’s pants.
Well, maybe just a little.
He didn’t mind that at all.
That morning, seven months ago, he’d woken up in a foul mood, a whole hour before his alarm was supposed to go off. As much as he’d wanted to crawl back under the sheets, Cas knew he wouldn’t be able to fall back asleep. He was a light sleeper and once up, he was up for good.
“Yes.” Cas can feel a blush rising up his neck. Dean’s not the only one drunk, but he’s addressed it enough times now that it finally sinks in. “Dean. D-do you mean it?”
, and he was worried — so he can feel how tensed his best friend is. “Because
“Well, now you’ve said it.” Cas deadpans, and Dean throws his head back to laugh.
Castiel smiles slowly, a tear landing on his pillow. “I love you too.”
"You're making it sound like there's a rule."
Dean waits.
"What the fuck is this, Cas?"
“You wanted a boyfriend.” Cas repeats, flatly. He associates such despair with the word, that Dean wants to punch him for it.
Cas looks at him, terrified. He wishes he could hug Dean - wrap himself around him in a tight embrace, and not let go until Dean stops shaking, because right now, he’s trembling, but Cas has no idea if he’s allowed to do that. Dean is - well, from what Cas interprets of the situation, he’s having a panic attack, and Cas doesn’t want to cross boundaries.
crushes.
a sound Sam never thought he’d hear his brother make. The entire ordeal is too much, and he starts laughing, Eileen squinting in his direction. Sam signs a quick 'it’s Dean’ at her, his face splitting with a grin as he adds a 'one minute’, and hangs onto the phone as 'Cas’ continues.
“Dickface-atron keeping ya busy?”
And then, his jaw drops.
But he'd suspected Dean would too, so he returns Dean's look with one of equal surprise. "It's a crop-top, Dean."
Dean cries into a lonely whiskey glass
It’s night.
, but he doesn’t know yet that this’ll continue to plague him in friendly and family gatherings whenever Cas recounts their getting-together tale for posterity, but that’s something else entirely.)
He just stands at the door, miserable, his tie so completely wrong, that nothing is right.

"Get in, and we'll talk?" Dean grins in return, waving the keys to the Impala in the air.
“No.” He snaps. “I wanted
"I mean," Cas goes on. "I still don't understand why you won't say yes to armor, spellcarved or otherwise, but even the Winchesters wouldn't be reckless enough to actually deduct the layers between the weapons and —"
- I love you too.” He takes a full breath. “I love you so much.”
"Goddamn slinkies." Dean lets out, softened voice brimming with nostalgia and affection, as he stares at the colorful coil on the library table.
Fuck weird - Cas is infuriatingly
“Dean, we just left a party.” Cas points out, gently. He’s got his hand between Dean’s shoulder blades, has had it there since Dean stopped the Impala in the middle of nowhere, got out and sat down on the hood instead — and of course, Cas followed because that was
“Dean.” Cas loses what remained of his reticence, and if Dean has more to say, he can say it with Cas close, hovering near with his hands featherlight along Dean’s arms, wanting to comfort, but not knowing how. Cas
Cas hands him the keys from Dean’s pocket, while Dean protests his indignance. “I’m driving -”
Oh, that's his face for when Cas answers a rhetoric.
“Oh, also — wait. Just a second.” He interrupts himself, and probably covers the speaker with his palm before yelling blurrily to someone near him.
And Sam immediately proceeds to half-sign, half-laugh and fumble through a description of what just happened, his exhaustion forgotten completely in his high, and Eileen soon joining in his glee, because how could she not?
Dean gulps.
Dean again, then he’ll take what he can get.
Charlie’s a blessing, and it’s not like Dean didn’t know that already, but it feels like a realization of even greater magnitude when she sits with him through coffee after coffee, patiently (and kindly) dismissing his ideas.

Dean can’t get himself to say the whole thing. He can’t make it more demanding. If he had to say all of the words, he couldn’t have done it.
“Dude. Forget about it.” Dean immediately cuts him off. Sam raises his eyebrows, knowingly, but neither of them are paying attention to him right now.  “Doesn’t hurt. I, uh. Just didn’t know it could go that low.”
"So then the list of people who can wear them just became," Cas sighs. "Everyone, except these men."
“You’re a little shit when you’re drunk.” Dean rolls his eyes, and kisses Cas again just because he can, now.

(Or tries to, anyway.)

“Hello. Dean Winchester, who’s this?”
He can’t find Cas anywhere. Dean’s looked where he works, and he’s looked where he lives - it’s like Cas just disappeared.
Now Cas thinks he’s a creep who spends time staring at random apartment buildings. Exactly the boost his confidence had needed.
that Dean’s smiling up at the ridiculous glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling when he drifts off, and completely misses the haze of tears clouding the blue, when Cas stares at him.
it’ll be alright.”
.” Dean breaks down, and Cas immediately wraps his arms around him, holding him up. Before closing the gap between them, Dean adds, for the last time. “I wanted you to be my boyfriend.”
“Back then? You would’ve put two angelic fingers on my forehead, and zapped me the fuck to India, or something.” Dean grits out, edging towards his worst temper. Cas can hear him trying to restrain himself. “But now, you won’t - now, you

It’s kind of weird to look at, but Dean’s own flustered face makes it more than worth it.
Cas smiles.
shouldn’t have been your response to a metaphorical being-dumped situation, either.”
Blissfully unaware of Dean’s revelation, Cas just frowns as he returns the hunter his bottle. “Dean, do you think anyone truly enjoys the taste of —”
"Dean?" Cas stops mid-step, entering the garage, and greets him with a puzzled stare - because Dean's not usually found wandering alone by the cars, in the middle of the day, and because staring is kind of their thing.
“But I’ve said it now?”
And well, he isn’t particularly into romcoms, but he hopes the poor guy gets a chance to finish his sentence.
He holds the angel’s gaze, lips curving in a smirk.
,” He begins, to no avail. Dean looks on with fascination, as Cas’s face traverses almost the entire spectrum of human (or ex-angel, he isn’t sure what Cas is anymore, but he avoids grouping him in with their unimpressive kind mostly) emotion.
Cas knows he’s never been more enthusiastic on a personal level about the discovery of a vampire’s nest. And he doesn’t pin it to a hunter’s heart dripping gamelust - because he’s aware that the idea of flying across the country with Dean Winchester, after so long, is significantly more appealing than the intricacies of pretending, and ridiculous badges, when they get there.
He’s allowed this, he tells himself. Allowed to be selfish, one last time.
"You know that doesn't help either of us understand," Cas says quietly, and Dean lets out a sigh, less aggravated than before and more exhausted at the same time — the way he gets whenever Cas's lack of experience being human comes up like an unavoidable wall in the middle of an argument, and Dean has to explain things that should, and otherwise
But Cas rallies to stay serious. There’s a chance Dean needs that right now. “If you’d really rather. Of course.”
And as Cas holds on - simply holds on, running the pads of his thumbs on Dean’s skin, Dean’s chest stops heaving. He still looks dazed, and is breathing heavy, when Cas moves insufficiently closer, swaying into Dean’s space.
Cas pauses. Or Dean does. Maybe both of them do, and Sam wonders if they’ve figured out how to talk inside their head - but because blessings are rare when you’re a Winchester, of course they haven’t.
Dean smiles, but in the absence of flashed teeth and gums, it’s closer to Cas’s reserved ones.
Castiel opens his eyes a sliver again. The walls do resemble a hospital. Plain, white tiled. Way too many AC vents. Is that something on his hand?
Cas looks up at Dean's voice — whisper, to be fair — and finds him standing in the doorway.
Easy.
that way, that’s why. Basically, look into those unbelievably blue eyes, and somehow manage the words, “Please go out with me, Cas. Please.” (but less lame, hopefully) without spontaneously combusting.
It’s kind of amusing to see your brother choke on a simple, yet easily mislaid, ‘you’re bigger’, delivered in pointed deadpan, and your best friend’s dialect. Especially when it’s his own voice saying it.
louder.
“N-no.” Cas struggles, and it’s getting harder to not pant. He sounds too breathy anyway. “We don’t. Didn’t.”
“And I haven’t fucking changed.” Dean ends abruptly, inflicting a scornful glare at the floor, and -
Dean turned around. There was Cas, beaming at him.
Castiel had wrapped his arms around Dean then, embracing him, surrounding him, and they curled into each other completely. Burying himself in Castiel’s neck, Dean had never felt so close to him, and yet so far away. “You don’t have to follow the same patterns if you don’t want to, Dean,” Castiel stated, as if it were that easy. “Do you want to?”
They hadn’t spoken about it again, not seriously anyway. They got a dog. Dean opened a vintage car garage. Castiel learned how to bake. They took long road trips to the beaches in California, wandered through roadside attractions like Carhenge in Nebraska and Cadillac Ranch in Texas. They bought decidedly way too much merchandise at Oklahoma’s National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum. And maybe they killed the occasional vampire, the wayward poltergeist, but the occasions became less and less. There were younger, more spry hunters on the road now, always welcome at the bunker to look through their library or ask advice on a particularly troublesome spirit. Sam even coerced Dean into holding what became a yearly “conference,” “What are we, a tech startup?” for the next generation of hunters to learn from the legendary brothers.
Dean looked up at him then with a pout, “You sound pretty confident in that statement for a dude who hasn’t shown up to heavenly chorus practice in a few years.”
Cas silently pulled Dean into his shoulder as he sobbed. Dean didn’t even know why he was crying, didn’t know what for. Maybe he was happy. Maybe he was grieving. Maybe he just felt… relief. He wasn’t sure the last time he felt such relief. He wasn’t sure he
The brothers still fought. They still bickered, pranked, and glowered. Sam complained that Dean let his kids use power tools too young when they visited, and Dean complained that Sam’s kids were too old to have never heard “Stairway to Heaven.” The usual, the routine, many times over. But they never lied to each other, at least not about the important things, not anymore. And Castiel was welcome in Sam and Eileen’s house and lives, an honor he felt he didn’t deserve, but as Dean said, maybe it wasn’t about deserving.
. It was a long road, a family that waited for him, a shoulder to lean on. It was, at long last, a place to lay his weary head to rest.
He’d visited heaven before. Been there, done that, got the t-shirt. Not an exciting place, but exciting wasn’t necessarily good. Hell had been exciting, and he was in no hurry to return there. Purgatory had been exciting in a different way, years later he swore the stench still lingered on his skin. Sometimes, when he would lose himself in his “senior moments,” he thought he was back in that bloody in between. Or back in hell. Or had gone to heaven. “Times and places are difficult to navigate when your brain’s turning into gummy worms,” he told Cas once. He didn’t remember saying this a few hours later, but that didn’t make it any less true.
“I don’t think I’d be very good at it,” Castiel stepped closer so that Sam wouldn’t have to crane his head, “I’m not very persuasive.”
“Yes, Dean.”
Castiel found himself stroking Dean’s hair, an action he felt suited him. He thought for a moment in the stillness and in the space between their breaths. “Maybe it’s idealistic of me, but I still think people should get what they deserve. Even- no,
“Dean,” Cas said sadly, but with his trademarked firmness, “You

Cas shook his head with a smile, “I could never
“For however long you want me to be.”
Castiel smiled.
“Got my hearing aids in, go ahead,” Dean joked.
Then Dean would smile, and it would light up the room, and Castiel would wonder again how he came to deserve the focus, let alone the affection, of such a man.
you.”
soon, Dean.
“Dean,” Jack stopped him, “This is heaven. You are in heaven.”
“And… fuck,” Dean stood at sudden attention, “I left Sam down there, is he okay?”
“Me to beef it, finally. I know this hasn’t been easy, watching me… seeing me like…” Dean took a shallow breath. “No matter where I go next, at least I won’t be a senile senior citizen.”
“It’s not about fair. It’s about the truth. Whether you believe it or not, ET goes home.”
“You’re making them sound like trading cards. I don’t know, I- I guess I never thought too hard about it.” Castiel could tell this was a lie by the way Dean didn’t quite meet his eyes. “Wouldn’t know what to do with a kid if I had one.”
him. He had really only passed by John’s cell, stole a glance at the infamous hunter on his way to retrieve Dean’s soul. He’d never told Dean what he saw, they were not close enough at the time. He wasn’t sure if Dean would even want to know. Castiel had almost spoken about it many times, but whenever Dean talked about John, “Dad,” a look crossed over his face, sometimes for only a second. A furrowing of brows, a tight smile, a quick transition to happier subjects.
"Wait,” the suspicious squint was back as Cas caught Dean’s arm, “Something else is bothering you."
“Get mauled by a werewolf?”
“It took less persuading than you’d think.”
“And… you’re here.”
“Children love gummy worms. They listen and will behave better when offered gummy worms,” Castiel knew this for a fact from very recent personal experience, “I don’t see how gummy worms could pose an issue. Slingshots, however-”
Dean turned around, and the ocean was back. The ocean he’d taken a trip to see, had selfishly insisted Cas come along for the ride for.
some babies,” Dean waggled his eyebrows and Castiel pushed Dean’s laughing face away, but grabbed his hand, turning towards their room.
“Where?”
Only in that newfound silence did Dean notice he was crying. He shook his head, wiping the tears away furiously.
know, this could… I could be dreaming or some shit, and I guess even in a dream you could say whatever I wanted you to say, so-”
Castiel cocked his head, the smile fading. Fifty some odd years and he still had that same confused look. “Waiting for what?”
A relieved but small smile spread over Dean’s face. “Cool…”
“She’s a memory of a car, Dean,” Cas rolled his eyes, “She isn’t going to dent.” He patted the spot next to him.
“They had… well I wasn’t going to find those editions in America, and-”
“Do- wait,” Dean shook his head, trying to understand where Castiel was going with all of this, “Do
Castiel kissed his forehead. “I swear.”
“Well if people got what they deserved, they’d… I don’t know, Sam would’ve actually become a lawyer, stayed in school. Jo, Ellen, Bobby, they’d all still be here. I’d get mauled by a werewolf or something, go out with a bang, and Baby,” Dean said sternly, as though chastising the universe itself for such an injustice, “Would never get so much as a
Dean registered that, swallowing, “I don’t know. I guess I just never thought I’d even make it this far. Hunters have the shortest lifespans of any human subspecies,” Dean cracked a smile, but his heart wasn’t in the joke. Castiel knew Dean was doing the math in his head. He knew Dean was mentally recalling how long it had been since Bobby left for heaven. Tallying up the number of people who were gone because of self-sacrifice, mistakes, pure dumb luck. Counting exactly how many years he had outlived his own mother.
No, wait. That wasn’t a field, it was a… sandy beach. It looked kind of like that beach he and Cas had stumbled upon driving down the Pacific Coast Highway, what was it called? The one where they’d had to hike down from the lookout point? The one where after they’d trudged back up the trail, they’d sat in the car and looked out over the sea as the sun set? The one where Castiel had smiled at him and the light glinted in his blue eyes and Dean had kissed Cas for the first time ever because he just couldn’t stop himself?
Time took its time with them.
Dean grinned and pulled him into a solid hug. “Jack. I missed you buddy, how have you been? Where, uh… are we in…”
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean took a step back, seeing Jack grinning out of the corner of his eye. “Is, uh… is anyone else coming? Or is this the welcoming party?”
“Get what ready?” Dean asked.
Jack waved, walking up casually, “Hey, Dean.”
Dean took a deep, shuddering breath. “If I don’t end up in heaven-”
Jack chucked, “I think you know where we are.”
had truly felt it.
"Okay," Dean took a deep breath, concentrating on the physical contact, grounding himself in Cas’s movements, "Okay. I mean I know he's gonna be fine, he was always fine without me," Dean said, almost to himself.
“Sorry,” Dean muttered.
“Okay…” Dean was thinking, swirling the beer around his glass. He pointed the mouth at Castiel, “You’re still avoiding my question,” Castiel really rolled his eyes this time, “But I don’t really think it’s for me, all that white picket fence stuff. If you really wanted a kid, I would definitely hit the library and read all those, I don’t know, fucking parenting guides, and take the Mommy and Me classes, whatever. And I think you’d be a good father, better than me, I’d just let them eat gummy worms and shoot slingshots.”
“I mean I love the little gremlins,” Dean had said, cracking open a beer after a long few days of babysitting Sam and Eileen's girls while the expecting parents were in the hospital. He was exhausted, they both were, but beaming from meeting the newest member of the Winchester clan: a healthy baby boy named Robert. “But have you seen Sam’s house? Goddamn mess in there.”
“You think that’s what you deserve?” Castiel’s voice was soft, not wanting to disturb the still of the night, but steely as he considered even the possibility of Dean’s violent end.
Castiel frowned, furrowing his brows. “They should,” he grumbled.
“You mean they haven’t given you reaper duty yet?” Sam joked from his horizontal position, speaking and signing with his usual quick wit, but not with his usual articulation. Castiel had seen him argue with Dean for fifty years like it was his job, he was accustomed to the precision with which Sam had always wielded his words. Not today.
, and always were,
Again and again the scenes changed. Green waters showed the cities he had passed through, the homes that were kept from destruction, entire communities that were healed. The water formed and reformed into smiling faces and waving hands. Some of the people, Dean had known on Earth. Many of the places, Dean had remembered driving through. Most of the people and places, however, were foreign to Dean. He lost count of the number of strangers who appeared, the cities he’d never been to. He struggled to keep track as they cycled faster and faster, as numerous as the grains of sand and droplets of water they were made of. It seemed that a whole generation of people, all over the world, would-be victims of an apocalypse they never even knew was happening, knew him. Through words and cheers and song, they retold the tales of Dean and Sam Winchester, the tales they had only learned once they had passed on.
“We’ve taken vacations!”
. You don’t have to be strong right now. You don’t have to be strong ever again if you don’t want to. You have done enough.”
“Okay, lots of stuff to unpack here. First of all, a normal life isn’t and never
Infinity stretched out in front of him like the fields of grain. It wasn’t an exciting infinity, but it was
“I want you to live a normal life, Dean. I want to be able to give you what you want.”
“They’re all waiting for you,” Cas put his hand down, and as he did, it was stopped mid-air, as if resting on something solid. Dean blinked, and there was Baby, new as the day she was made, parked on a long, long road that stretched far out of sight. “Any time you’re ready,” Cas tossed something in Dean’s direction, “we can go.”
“...And third of all?” Castiel prompted.
“You’re not senile.”
"And you'll see him soon."
Throughout all of this, Cas pressed his shoulder to Dean’s, his presence grounding but not distracting. Dean’s grip on Cas’s hand grew tighter and tighter. Cas did not let go.
“No kidding,” Sam shakily clasped Castiel’s hand and grinned. “I’m surprised Dean even went with you.”
“You always wanted to go somewhere exotic and then you’d just end up in the library. Remember Berlin?”
So maybe they spent more time at home than on the road, but home suited them. Routine suited them like Castiel never could have predicted it would. It wasn’t a white picket fence, but it wasn’t a lonely highway either. Dean would joke about how “boring” they’d become, but Castiel reveled in the repetition. The three hundredth time Dean brought Castiel coffee in bed was just as lovely as the third. The five hundredth time Castiel cooked dinner passed without fanfare, though Dean hugging him from behind, chin hooked over Castiel’s shoulder as he whisked, felt like fanfare enough. The one thousandth kiss they shared was in their bed, lazily breathing each other in as the first beams of sunlight shone through the window after a week of straight rain. Home, a thing he and Dean had never known in their youth, held the majority of their most precious, most banal memories. But still, Castiel always looked forward to those moments speeding down a desert highway when Dean would reach for his hand, turn his head to meet Castiel’s eyes, and smile.
Dean died at the ripe old age of 85.
Lucas. The name came to Dean from deep in his memory, he was that quiet kid who drew Dean pictures of the ghost in the lake. The grain animated Dean’s smile as he talked, the figure of Lucas showed Dean his sketches. Their forms dissolved as the scene changed and Dean's form was pulling Lucas out of the water, the sheriff having paid his due.
The man blushed. “Well, if I go… I mean, wherever I go… Where will you end up?”
“Cas…” Dean reached to embrace him too, only now noticing that the hands that reached out were not as wrinkled as they’d been when he last saw them. He hugged Cas tightly, relieved more than he wanted to admit. “You’re here.”
It seemed the opposite with Sam’s children, who grew up faster than Castiel could keep track of. And as they grew from waddling toddlers to full-fledged human beings, Castiel was fascinated, enamored, but Dean was simply proud. He attended their tournaments, their decathlons. He went to their graduations, weddings, barbecues, and Castiel went with him. They took the kids to concerts and movies, parks and shooting ranges, and Castiel never got tired of the smile on Dean’s face when they threw their small arms around Dean’s neck and called him their “Cool Uncle.” “Hear that, Cas? That means you’re the No Fun Uncle. The No-Funcle.”
“Yeah, I’ll go get everything ready,” Jack blipped out.
“Hello, Dean.”
Cas gave him a look, then turned to Jack, “Could you give us a moment?”
“You’ll tell me though, if this is something you really want,” Castiel insisted, “If you think about it and decide something else.”
Tears welled in the corners of Dean’s eyes. He furiously tried to blink them away, but Cas was already there, dabbing carefully with a handkerchief. “I’m… I’m scared, Cas. I know I shouldn’t be, I’ve seen it all. I’ve beefed it a few times already. But maybe that’s why I’m scared? Because… I know what comes next. What
“I, uh… I don’t gotta sign any autographs, do I?”
Dean sniffed in laughter, and that was answer enough.
The shapeshifters appeared next, the sand in the form of Sam’s friend Zach, his sister Becky, and even Dean’s false shifter form, but the true form in the too-large jacket blew them all away, leaving Becky waving goodbye. She too welcomed a family that appeared by her side, and they all looked so happy and grateful to have each other.
Castiel had met John Winchester, in Hell. Well, he hadn’t exactly
Castiel wiped an errant tear from Dean’s cheek, holding his face between his hands firmly, tenderly.
“I’ve been trying to convince you for all the time I’ve known you that you’re worthy. That you deserved to be saved. That you deserved to rest.” Cas looked down at their entwined hands, “I don’t think I ever really succeeded.”
He tried to speak, but the words stuck in his throat. Cas helped him swallow some cool water. Dean cleared his throat, “Bet you’ve been waiting for this for a while.”
“No, second of all first.
Castiel closed the distance between them fully, thumbing across Dean’s cheek as they kissed. “Anywhere. If you want me there, I will be there, whether it’s here or heaven. I’ll be there.”
He abandoned the all too tantalizing task at hand to come up for air, resting his head on one of Dean’s ass cheeks, using the stout knoll of muscle and fat as a pillow.
In his frenzy, he’d taken Dean’s cries for pleasure alone, but the crying was steady now, and Dean’s chin quavered. The Omega was genuinely upset. Fuck.
Castiel loved it.
“I know, honey. I know they are comfy, and I know you look beautiful in them, and I know that you want me to like you in them. But this isn’t about that, is it? Hmm?” He nipped Dean’s earlobe and carried on, “This is about you wanting to show off your lovely body, for others to gawk at it, isn’t it? This is about you flaunting this sweet and ripe fat ass in public.” Cas rubbed himself against Dean, holding him in his place. Dean’s lack of response was answer enough. “Baby. This ass?” – a smack – “All mine. I don’t want strangers lusting after my property. And you say these leggings are opaque at the top, but you know they’re not. I can see everything, my love, and I know you didn’t bother with underwear, not even a thong.”
Castiel wondered how many times had Dean’s ass been penetrated by a cock.
With how much unprotected sex they’d soon be having, and with Dean’s ass promising to suckle every drop from Castiel’s sack like he was doing right now, the Alpha knew it wouldn’t take much time for Dean to fall pregnant either.
“Yeah, Cas?”
But. It also was what Dean had just said.
Castiel slapped him hard, causing Dean’s body to jolt.
Castiel’s knot pressed against Dean’s asshole, little by little, it was being sucked in. Even if Dean didn’t want it, his body did. God. The Omega was aching to milk a knot, to be impossibly stretched while an Alpha cock spurted its semen and bloated his belly.
“It’s alright, baby. Just a little kiss, see?” and Cas would give the pucker feather-light kisses which turned into careful nibbles, tongue swiping along the taint.
And mate.
Many Omegas, eager to follow in their idol’s footsteps, tried leaving their partners blue-balled and with a raging knot. It became a trend, for a little while.
Dean fell forward, collapsing against the headboard and from his mouth erupted a strangled giggle that was all quenched arousal. He circled his hips happily, enthused by his release.
Dean didn’t seem totally convinced, but Cas knew just the right words to make him cheer him up and get this slut tantrum over and done with.
Dean chuckled, but the sound got caught in his throat. He tried dissimulating it with a cough, but Castiel didn’t mind. What was another name in Dean’s list that wasn’t his?
“I see.”
"Can you blame me though?" he replied, moving his hands enthusiastically up and down, making Dean’s fat ass jiggle in the process.
He knew Dean needed his rest, but Castiel was only a man, and one who was in love at that. The stark-naked body of his lover was bound to have an effect on him. His cock, a mile ahead, was hard and weeping at the head. This was not about him though; it was about Dean’s ass. For Castiel, it always was.
Maybe, maybe. But I was just, just waiting, Cas. Want it to be s-special.”
“Fuck. Fuck, Dean. You’re so beautiful, baby. Such a perfect little Omega, can’t help yourself, can you? Is that why you do it? Is that why you let everyone fuck you?”
His boy nodded once; the green of his eyes having turned all pupil.
Was Dean trying to prove a point? To say he wasn’t who people said he was? Or was this some twisted way of teaching Castiel a lesson?
Castiel was highly compelled to do just that.
One, two. A little push, Dean’s loud scream. That’s all it took for Castiel to slip his knot inside that vice-like heat. He wouldn’t last much longer, and neither would Dean. They were panting heavily, catching their breaths, in sync, as if they’d done this before and yet reeling with the newness of it.
Stars bloomed in Dean’s eyes, and all of a sudden Castiel was attacked by a burst of kisses all over his face. He chuckled and grabbed Dean’s hips, lifting him up a little, and damning his cock for being a stubborn, selfish bastard. The Omega was a crying mess, and he was still raging hard, avid to sink his length inside the tightness of Dean’s ass.
“Y-yeah, Cas”.
He thrusted a few times, relishing in the velvety softness of Dean’s channel, and then he began to fuck the Omega earnestly, hips stuttering aggressively as he chased his release. He could hear Dean howling, his body shaking from hanging midair, perched on a hard cock. He repeated the same words over and over in a debauched litany,
They’ve been talking within (heh.) themselves for ages.
The uniformed official stuck with the responsibility of calling the next of kin, Victor Henriksen, fishes out the wallet as the paramedics carry him into the ambulance and attach him to IV immediately, and steps away to dial his emergency contact with a crinkled brow of sympathy.
“Figures.”
So Sam huffs out a short breath, and the three of them pile into their car, with just Sam in the front. He starts the engine, distractedly inserts one of Dean’s tapes in the deck, and decides to hum along to tune out the increasingly growing weird conversations in the back - for their sake, and at this point, also his own.
It is what it fucking is.
Cas swallows. “Dean, you’re drunk.”
“I did.”
“Dean?” Cas pauses, eyes utterly wild.
not a Blue French Horn kinda guy either.”
Castiel picks up his phone.

“You’re way too adorable.”
But he did leave. Dean asked him to be his boyfriend, and he agreed - and the next morning, he left.
Immediately, there’s a hand on his arm.

“They do?”
“Hello?”
“I’d let you take me anywhere, Cas.”
Before he can finish, Cas kisses him.
Castiel returns, simple as that. He’s wearing a hoodie with a local diner’s logo on it — and either he won it being the millionth customer to order black coffee, or just woke up and decided to support small businesses. Either way, it’s clearly overworn, bulky, and a shade of grey that matches his glasses, and he’s too fucking cute for Dean’s sake.
A dog, for Dean.
He loses himself trying to remember the last time he saw Dean smile — earlier this morning, kissing him goodbye before he left — no, down from their balcony, accompanied by a gleeful wave because Dean’s shift started a couple hours after Cas’s day in the office did —
Sam looks on curiously, as Dean thumps his chest to regain his breath.

Castiel laughs, and takes the flowers from Dean — leaning in to kiss his cheek after he does, and as Dean blushes again, he knows all those coffees and embarrassment from the dismissed ideas was truly worth it.
Dean says it quiet, not looking into Cas’s eyes. He feels Cas’s arm around him tensing. His head’s still on Cas’s chest, one hand on his stomach, caressing the skin.
Dean holds on to Cas, with arms clinging around his neck, until the end. It feels like he’s gliding - but somehow also like he’s driving hands-free in the clouds, though he’s surrounded by too much of everything for it to be the sky. He’s not terrified, but he’s overwhelmed, and he’s goddamn living- hell, he’s never lived this much in a breath, because the second he’s trying to replace the oxygen in his lungs, he finds the chasm of warped space start to dissipate.
— drifted off.
Dean seethes, pinkfaced, but he remains silent, and that’s clearly the most affirmation he’s getting from there. Cas is the one who directs a slow and understanding nod.
Sam slams the book shut, getting up and already starting to dial Cas’s number from memory.
Cas doesn’t think about the fact that if Dean isn’t angry at him, there’s no reason to be yelling. Instead, he thinks about the rare haziness in intense, green eyes, and the pain in his crushed voice.
Dean, after all that their lives have been, then that’s for him (
“A really big one.” Cas agrees, sounding guilty. “But
“Oh.” Cas sighs thankfully, the frown smoothening itself out. “I’m so glad to hear that.”
And then Cas breaks into a smile, chest heaving as well, with the corners of his eyes wrinkling, and lips pulling up, and Dean gets to lean in and kiss him again, and he gets to tell Cas he loves him, and tell Cas he loves him every morning, and every time he feels like it’ll burst out of his chest if he doesn’t, and he gets to want Cas to hold him, as they fly, and -
Dean Winchester
It’s like a switch had flipped.
"You're right, Jack would like it."
"Enlighten me."
Dean draws a quick breath, tunes the voices in his head out, and leans in abruptly to press his lips to Cas’s cheek.
a crop-top, buddy. Why is it here?" He looks at the (apparently) offensive item once again — candy red, cropped, and frankly adorable in all its glory — and seems to absorb it's redness straight to his cheeks, his blush deepening. "Why would you buy this, Cas?"
Cas hums.

that, because you were doing the toystore equivalent of pining from afar."
“I’m so sorry, I’m so —” He chokes, horrified, beginning to roll down the windows but Castiel’s already begun to walk to the other side, curving around the front of the Impala,
Sam’s never going to let Dean live this down — “no chickflick moments”, his
Ever the genius, Dean rushes to open the door — and freezes entirely when he sees Castiel’s eyebrows pinch as the door up and slams into him.
"You mentioned your clothes were getting a little tight this morning," Cas says, slowly. "Over breakfast. You said you needed to buy some."
, you’re one of the best men I know, just, please -”
Dean shifts, raises his eyes from the floor to meet Cas’s, and they linger in a stare of depthless confessions.
But after long years of struggle, and fight, and therapy, he’s no longer that guy. His sexuality doesn’t take away his right to want things for himself. He deserves to be happy.
“Yeah, but fucking hold me, okay?” Dean huffs, and it’s such a relieving sound of mild exasperation, more than a reach for normalcy, and Cas adores it. He knows Dean isn’t alright - not yet, and he doesn’t know how long it’ll take in the long run, but he knows he’ll be there for Dean. Through all of it, and on the other end.
“I am aware.”
Cas, obviously, stops speaking entirely.
. Around him, inside him, everywhere.
And then, Dean’s right thumb twitches, tracing the second knuckles of Cas’s fingers, and Cas feels a shadow of solace go through him, nervousness mingling with grace in his veins.
“Gladly.” Cas mouths, and Dean probably imagines the way his cheeks pink when Dean says it, which is frankly adorable, but before he can lean in to kiss his glittery smile, there’s a sound at the other side of the door, and Dean shuffles in his seat abruptly, reaching for his shirt and causing Cas to fall to the floor with an overexaggerated grunt, which sets him laughing.
“Shuddup.” Dean grins, leaning in to peck his lips. “And in my defense,
Dean interrupts him with a groan. "Not why it's

The words don’t register, but the voice does.
Apparently, you can’t fit two six-foot-tall men on a single officechair.
“Such a weird phrase.” Cas whispers back. “Almost sounds like 'I love you’, wouldn’t you say?”
He was in pretty bad condition, Henriksen recalls, and the bloodloss had knocked him out for several hours, but he looked twenty five at most, more importantly healthy, and — he looks at the wallet again, and the picture of two men (one of them, the victim) smiling at the camera with their hands around each other —

And that’s okay.
Oh, he loves him so much.

“I’ll try to stop -”
They haven’t fallen asleep.
Cas, of course he loves Cas, and —
Cas responds almost right away, pushing back into the kiss, and Dean, with all of himself, and letting both arms circle Dean’s waist and shoulders, ending up impossibly close. Dean cups Cas’s face, tilting it towards himself, as he kisses him with everything he’s ever felt. There’s gratitude, and apologies, and need, and
Charlie’s a blessing, and Dean Winchester is a chick-flick-saturated, ridiculous romantic.

slinkies." Dean swears, expression miles away from his words. His lips are parted in innocent wonder, and curled a smidge at the corner in just a hint of a smile. His green eyes are graphic, opened wide, and they glitter - at least from where Cas sits.
“I’m lonely.”
Cas’s face scrunches, suddenly doleful. “Bee day would’ve been funnier.”
Cas looks on, trying to dissect the way Dean’s eyes stay glued to his, unconsciously, and trying to read Dean through them. He can sense faith, and hope, and his resolve is renewed.
He’s got this.)

His heart is beating faster than it ever has.
This time, Dean doesn't shut himself down or look away. This time, a tight laugh escapes his chest, unchecked, because of how unnerved he looks by it, as he grits out, "'Cause no one wants to see a fat old geezer in a crop-top, Cas, that's why."
Dean buries his face in the hoodie Cas just offered him — to wear, in fact, and not to use as a handkerchief but it wasn’t the time for semantics.
“Shuddup. And dude - stop that.” Dean again. “The hell are you doing to my voice, anyway? What’s wrong with the way it is?”
Blink and a miss —
And that’s a happy ending, if Dean Winchester’s ever dreamed of one.
“Huh?”
Cas doesn't rise to the bait. "Because

Sam pinches his eyebrows together, nose scrunched in reaction to the ridiculosity unfolding in front of him. Too engrossed in himself - themselves - to notice Sam bitchfacing in their general direction, Dean stands with his hands on his hips, and Cas in his head. He’s staring himself down, in a very Dean kind of frustration - but his expression is clear enough to belong to a particular ex-immortal, kinda-sorta-angel of the Lord.
“What the fuck is going on, Cas?” Dean scrubs his face with his hand, and looks down at the floor. “All I know is, you said
Every person in Truman High who had eyes or a nose knew that Dean Winchester was the most mouth-watering, desirable and charming Omega to grace its corridors without putting up a show and simply being his genuine, likeable self.
“So you’re not a tease?”
Check.
Castiel huffed.
“Tell me, Cas. What dirty things are being said ‘bout me?”
“Indulge me, my sweet boy. Be a little slut for me today. Please.”
“Don’t you want me, Cas?” Dean asked, hiding his crotch from view. No one should be allowed to look so sexy playing coy when they were the complete opposite.
“Hey!” came the reply.
“I don’t -We don’t know each other,” he retorted, trying to make sense of this new information.
But the boy was yet to speak.
He turned Dean around and kissed Dean’s lips, a gentle glide meant as reassurance.
His need for it was such that by now it’d become second-nature for Dean to sit on his face whenever Castiel was feeling antsy or stressed, it helped him relax. On those occasions, he’d lie prone on the bed or the couch, and beckon Dean with a crook of his finger, his boy dropping whatever he was doing and ridding himself of his confining undies to perform his duty as a human pacifier.
Cas suppressed a grin, and cut short Dean’s embarrassment, “Have you had breakfast yet?"
Castiel leveled his gaze with Dean’s and stroked his cheek. The omega leaned into the touch and exhaled, moaning sheepishly as his asshole showered Castiel’s implanted knot with more slick.
Sure they were. Cas could clearly distinguish the outline of Dean’s cock and the heaviness of his snugged balls behind it. Nevermind how inappropriate the outfit was, even if Dean went out dressed like that, there was no way the continuous rubbing and the lascivious looks he received wouldn’t have his boy getting an erection. He’d have to walk around with his slutty little dick tenting the front of his pants and leaking pre-cum through the flimsy cloth.
“You’re not mad?” Dean asked.
Gone were the days when Dean had to fuck away his frustrations with any knotheaded Alpha who offered him a quick fuck. He’d still be the same crazy little thing of an Omega, horny and hungry for cock to fill his mouth or his ass, presenting his slicked-hole at any given opportunity and avoiding blockers like the plague because he chose to reek of mating pheromones. But he’d be
I don’t -don’t let ‘em knot me, Cas. Never had a knot.”
Before, Castiel thought the list of alphas who ate Dean out had to be shorter than those who fucked him. Most alphas were all about fucking after all, but now that he’d gotten a taste for himself, he wasn’t so certain.
"My apologies...." he started, waiting for the man to offer his name.
In that moment, Castiel knew that the next time he knotted Dean (and there
“Let me guess. It has to do with this beauty–“ he slapped Dean’s ass hard enough for the boy to let out an ouch “riding my face.”
The boy still had a hard time believing Castiel wanted him for himself, that he wasn’t just keeping him around because of his –and this was an earnest compliment from Cas– ‘frankly pornographic ass’.
Daylight. In school. His crush dilapidating his carefully-constructed defenses,
Castiel gulped and memories of all the things he’d heard, and envisioned compulsively late at night, bloomed in his mind. Good thing, unlike Dean, Castiel wore blockers, so he only had to keep a poker-face and his wits about him, and maybe, just maybe, he’d come unscathed out of this one.
That seemed to be enough encouragement for the moment, and soon Dean’s ass shadowed his face, coquettish pucker winking down at him and the boy’s knees planted on the mattress while he held on to the wooden headboard for support.
Cas moaned in encouragement, prodding at the entrance with the pad of a finger. He was enraptured by Dean’s narrative. It seemed Dean’s dreams were quite liberating, if the even skimpier outfit was any indication to go by. Fuck, he loved his little cockslut.
“Right.” Castiel cleared his throat and fiddled with his phone to hide his reddened face. So much for leaving Truman High without ruining his aloof persona. Dean, so skilled in reading between the lines when it came to attraction, would surely add Castiel’s name (Cas?) to the list of horny Alphas who lusted after him, who would do anything to have their way with him. “Uh, you- Mrs. Roberts said you needed help with your final essay on the Relevance of Contemporary Philosophical Movements?”
“What else have you heard ‘bout me, Cas?”
“Tell you what. You keep the crop top, show off your perky little nipples, but change into a nice pair of jeans. How’s that?”
Cas, I’m… y-
Castiel felt his dick grow chubby and his mouth start salivating. He’d always been an ass guy, appreciative of his partner’s curves, but never in his life had he been spellbound by it. He was reaching new lows, or maybe the man before him was truly a god.
He wasn’t kidding anyone. Worshipping while maltreating Dean’s ass had become his goddamn hobby.
He could feel Dean’s asshole leaking on his knot, every drop invigorating his Alpha and telling Castiel to push his cock deep inside that heat without any sort of preparation. Dean was squelching wet, so there was no need. More than anything, Castiel wanted to fuck the Omega so hard and so thoroughly the whole school heard Dean’s cries of pleasure. He wanted to split that tight, famished hole on his knot, inevitably claiming Dean’s knot-virginity and locking their bodies together, so the Omega would nurse Castiel’s balls empty.
These were the type of smart, decent reasonings Castiel was thinking of, but as a response his mouth blurted out, "You know my name?"
“Wanna go over my essay draft anyway?”
Castiel groaned and bit Dean’s collarbone, latching onto the skin until he’d sucked a hickey that would mark Dean as his for days to come.
After a pregnant minute, Dean turned around, and he sounded so small when he spoke. His panties were lopsided, Omega-sized dick peeking over the waistband, and the front of his black tee was smeared with pre-cum.
Cas rewarded Dean by reaching lower to where Dean’s balls hang hot and heavy. The size of Dean’s dick paled in comparison to them, and anyone would say it was a mismatched set for any man: small dick, fat scrotum and a much fatter ass, but Castiel thought it was a match made in heaven.
“Do you want me to pull back?”
Subtle compromises were a loophole that often did the trick though.
The grip of Dean’s hole, locking them together, the soft tug lighting the erogenous zone that was their searing point of contact, it was maddening. Castiel did it again, more forcefully this time, and the tugging sensation was too much, the pull too intense for Dean, who, in no time, was painting the dark fabric of his t-shirt in white, and hugging Castiel tightly in his arms as he moaned out what sounded like a yes, his bow legs wrapped around the Alpha’s middle while his worn out hole spasmed, eager to be fed Alpha seed.
Castiel fumed, and still he was entranced by the way his erection disappeared inside Dean, how easily he could dive right in, how well they fitted together.
Dean chuckled and shook his head to hide his embarrassment. At least he didn’t seem mortified by it anymore. Baby steps.
Castiel shuddered and tried to keep still, but his hands found their way to Dean’s hips, fingers digging into the flesh, and he moaned when Dean began moving to-and-fro, accommodating himself to ensure Castiel’s hardness was slotted between the slicked globes of his ass, which wasn’t a struggle, since he was so wet he’d drenched the back of his pants.
It was the last class of the day, and he wanted nothing more than to go back home and finish his novel, but he figured extra credits could come in handy. His book would have to wait.
“If anything I’m mad at myself. I should’ve been there for you, Dean. Should’ve been the one fucking you instead of letting all those alphas take advantage of you.”
Dean stirred in his sleep, but his breathing was regular and profound, so he was still deep under.
“Fuck. No, no. I don’t- You’re very attractive, Dean, and your scent is heavenly. So I wouldn’t blame Mr. Roberts or any other Alpha, or any
"Novak. Wanna earn some last minute extra credit?" his Philosophy teacher asked. Castiel basically acted as her TA. A title easy enough to claim when no one else wanted it, and one with more than a few perks too, included using the teacher’s break room anytime he wanted, as well as free access to the coffee-machine and the microwave. Thanks to that and his packed lunch, he could skip the cafeteria altogether. A Dean-free lunchtime was bliss.
At that, Castiel saw red. He knew Dean was promiscuous, but facing cold-hard facts directly from his mouth was too much. With a flick of his finger, Castiel pulled away the poor excuse of a panty Dean wore, and plunged his cock inside with one swift thrust, brushing against Dean’s sweet spot in the process. The Omega was knocked out of his breath, eyes open wide, brows arched high and jaw left hanging.
Castiel bit his lip, jealous despite knowing very well that Dean wasn’t his, and he was free to do as he pleased with whomever he pleased. He should count himself lucky to even have this, and he wasn’t going to be the one to look a gift horse in the mouth.
“Of course I do. Come here, honey.”
Castiel went to the assigned classroom, and opened the door to an unsurprisingly vacant room. The level of irresponsibility some of his peers showed never failed to amaze him. He'd wait fifteen minutes before taking his leave.
Venus in slutty shorts.
“... Me?”
"My sincere apologies, Dean" Cas continued, extending a hand, "My name is Castiel."
“You only get to ride my face if you tell me about your dream while you do it.”
He was half-knotted to Dean, the Omega’s hole expanded around the full diameter of his engorged knot, but he wouldn’t take advantage of Dean. The Omega had said clearly he did not take knots, and every Alpha who’d fucked him (and there were oh so many) had abided by the rules. Castiel wouldn’t be the douchebag to force himself upon anyone, especially Dean.
The Omega looked at him puzzled, and broke down with renewed tears running down his face and little hiccups that made his whole body tremble.
In a few weeks time, Castiel was supposed to be starting college, and Dean still had a whole year before he graduated from high school, but they’d make it work. And if worse came to worse, and he knocked Dean up, well, Castiel believed things did happen for a reason.
He stroked Dean’s tender perineum and flicked his hole to elicit a verbal response out of him.
Dean felt so good clamped around his cock, he was slippery and his scent was overpowering. Needing more, Castiel flipped Dean around and got up, pushing Dean’s chest flat on the desk. Standing up, with Dean extended before him like a feast, it was easier to surrender to his deranged Alpha, and the intense but unhurried fuck turned into a relentless pistoning of sharp hips pounding against Dean’s plump ass, propelling him forward with each thrust.
Dean looked at Cas over his shoulder, eyes gone dark and cheeks blushing.
Another bark, and Castiel directed his gaze for the first time at the shaggy blond dog sitting by Dean’s foot. Which inevitably brought his attention to the exquisite pair of bowlegs he’d neglected in favor of the asset sitting above them.
Dean met his gaze then, and after a loud sigh said, “She thinks I slept with her husband.”
"True" he agreed.
Castiel draped his body entirely over the Omega, and kissed the assortment of freckles on his left shoulder. “Can you repeat that? Didn’t hear you there, got a little distracted.”
“Cas?” he mumbled; voice hoarse.
Dean’s sigh turned into a moan and his hips humped the mattress in tiny aborted movements that had the rippling effect of springing Dean’s ass towards Castiel. Thankfully, Dean was a heavy sleeper and although his body was reacting, he was still asleep.
Grateful for the intrusion, the tight muscle relaxed and gobbled down the silky-smooth tip, throbbing around it shamelessly.  Dean whined loudly.
Every touch was an adventure, the kisses, the sucking, the nipping… And it was so tight, no matter how often he ravaged its hole with his cock, how he left it gaping and oozing with his come.
He’d feel Dean shudder above him, always fighting so hard to keep still, to let Cas have his way with him without disruptions. As mouthy and sarcastic as he could be, Dean was also incredibly sweet, constantly seeking approval and validation in every little thing he did, which meant Dean would not fuck himself on Castiel’s face unless he was explicitly asked to do so.
Castiel kissed Dean, and there was no tenderness to it this time. It was hot and hungry and frantic, a placating distraction to keep him from coming right then.
Case in point, the hefty handfuls of hot-as-fuck ass Castiel was squeezing and stroking with his thumbs.
Then Cas would pull back and help Dean regain some composure, only to prolong his sweet torture. Dean was to find release untouched.
He prided himself in being the composed sort of man, never a slave to his impulses. And yet, the mere sight of it drove Castiel fucking insane with lust and greed and desire. It gave him an honest-to-god appetite, for fuck’s sake.
“No! I mean-
, and looking like the most beautiful and enraptured of creatures.
Dean stopped talking, and from his mouth came only breathy, frantic whimpers.
There were traces of lube on the little hole, making it glisten. Cas blew air over it and watched in fascination as the pucker pulsed once, twice, three times. Poor thing, puffy and tender and used, but still so hungry.
Cas grinned. That gorgeous plump ass and tight little pucker had quite a day ahead of them, and Castiel would be having one hell of a night. He’d keep Dean aroused for oh so many hours before he granted the boy his release.
“Have you heard I suck dick in the bleachers, the bathrooms, the janitor’s closet? Mhm? That I drink down Alphas just for kicks and that I lick cum drops from the fucking floor? Heard that too?” The Omega’s traced the shell of Castiel’s ear, and then Dean circled his hips, the lace of his panties embedded in the crack of his ass, the scarcely-sheltered hole quivering, trying to cup the thrumming knot. The most delicate zone of Dean’s body doing its best to tempt a possible mate into the oldest of traps.
“I love you,” He cries out, aware that the line’s cut, but
This is the farthest they’ve gotten, too. Dean’s hinted at these issues before, but he’s never had a breakdown in front of Cas - or anyone, and he’s never not backed off into a shell, after. This Dean is trying, and it’s wonderful. And it’d be growth, if Cas had ever looked at Dean Winchester, through the lens of an all-knowing immortal, like he’s not the most incredible being in the world, but a specimen, an experience - a phenomena to be analysed.
, and you try - because you’ve grown, Cas. You’ve become
In more ways than one, it’s like being administered anaesthesia before a surgery — Castiel was operated on for tonsils at age eleven, and he remembers it still — and it finally sinking in, and knocking you out, as the doctor says to count to ten, and you hardly graze six.
"You're the one making a list!" Dean snaps.
Then slowly, Cas turns, lips parted, and starry eyes directed straight at Dean, and this time Dean doesn’t even have to convince himself to go for it, and finds himself leaning closer to plant a kiss on Cas’s temple.
He wonders what Cas will say. He wonders if it was a mistake. He wonders if he should’ve shoved the principles of
“Will you let me take you flying?” Cas says. “And we can hold hands, or if you’ll let me, I can hold you, and I

Castiel beams. “Why thank you.” At this point his eyes leave Dean’s to check out his surroundings — and Dean mentally prepares himself to modestly receive compliments on his Baby, but Cas just stills, staring at the space between them.
It’s outstandingly painful to bend his neck enough to see he’s picked the right number — but the mere idea of accidentally calling an acquaintance at a time like this brings a tensed sliver of life into his muscles, and straining, he looks. Right enough, he’s got
Dean stares at him. What does that mean? A million different things go through his head at once. Cas doesn’t want to tell him. He cannot tell him. He doesn’t know. He cannot say.
Cas doesn’t seem like he intends to move either, for a very, very long time — though there’s a smug lining to his voice when he speaks, and it’s so exasperatingly the

Because anything that makes Cas look as happy as he does right now, is always going to be worth it.
“Of course.” He croaks, and slips —
“Dean, is that your car —”
Dean stops, thinks, and relents. "Fine.
“I can live with that.”
Dean's eyebrows furrow.
There’s no way he was going to live.
Castiel stares at the screen, devastated.
"Which is?"

They don’t pull away this time, for almost too long, and Cas is trailing breathy kisses from the bolt of Dean’s jaw down to his collarbone, and Dean’s back is arched, hands lost in Cas’s hair, lips chanting Cas’s name like it would kill him to stop - when the first tear falls from Dean’s eye, and hands on Cas’s cheek.

He frowns, because the plan had been for Dean to finish putting away the things Cas had bought this morning, and then join him and Jack in the Deancave — except Dean doesn't look like he has any intentions of entering. Instead, he hovers just outside, almost like he doesn't want Jack to see him.

Sam paces as he waits, and waits, and waits until the ringing ceases, and is followed by a beep. There’s the beginning of a rare string of curses aimed at the carpet, but then, a familiar voice comes up.

fainter, and it’s a miracle it doesn’t show.
Cas ducks his head.
A switch, stuck for longer than a decade in the middle, apparently the one holding Dean back from giving in all this time, and how badly he’s wanted to give in,
Missouri’s book kept talking about - up his ass, along with Cas’s dick, so that he forgets all about what’s right and what’s healthy, and focuses on what’s good.
— hell, I don't even know where I'll be next year. But I know I’d follow you to the end of the world if you asked me to and told me you want me to, and we’d never have to change, and do you even understand how fucked up that is?”
“I love you.” Cas lets out, because it seems far too important that Dean knows, and there’s limits to implications which can’t hold him back anymore. They’re going to fly together.
Sam shrugs noncommitally.
Castiel coughs, and gives up on squinting against the bright light. It’s a LED. Like in hospitals.
“Nothing. I think it’s lovely.”
Dean’s hands are colder than his, so Cas squeezes till Dean’s feel warm, and he looks at Dean as he does it, and Dean’s noticed now, and he’s staring at their hands, held between their chests, and he’s looking such awe - this delicate, beautiful wonder which makes Cas demand from himself why he hasn’t done this before.
“Sonuvabitch, Cas -”
Dean seems uncomfortable, still, though Cas just gave him an out. Cas can feel the restlessness in his guilty stare.
"Because I'm not a twenty year old twink anymore!" Dean retorts instantly, looking away from Cas.

“They’re both the awesome kind.” Castiel teases.
"They're just not."
Cue the blush. Apparently, Dean still had control over the parts of his face prone to reddening when he was embarrassed. Though, paired with Cas’s naturally stoic demeanor, it made for a comical display.
He pulls the blanket closer, and it’s still so cold. Cas’s shirt and trenchcoat are missing from the chair on which he’d discarded them last night. He closes his eyes, and a tear rolls down his face.

Cas turns to Dean Winchester, amused, yet not entirely surprised. The hunter’s standing in the doorway, the line of his lips slant. But he’s got his eyebrows raised in a pleading stance, his posture as unsettled as his pink, flustered cheeks. He is, in spite of his hesitation, beautiful to Cas.
“Will you let me try again?” Cas asks, in the same voice he’d have asked, do you trust me, and Dean understands it.
“Well, I’m sorry.” Cas returns, graciously. “I promise to beg you to keep me, the next time it happens.”
have been obvious.
Out of earshot at this point, Dean continues stalking to his room, though his brain stays stuck in the hallway, as it tries to figure out the rest of that conversation.

) longer, but there’s a knock on his window and Dean whips around to see Castiel blinking at him.
“Huh.”
“And I’m hoping you didn’t do it on purpose, because if so, I’m afraid I just defeated your motives by coming in.” He adds, and Dean rolls his eyes.
on the screen.
(Sam set off for Texas with Jack six days ago - a newspaper article leading them to cremated ghosts with elite, mysterious family members, and a whole lot of them. It’s fairly tame, as far as salt-and-burns go, and Castiel trusts both Sam’s intelligence, and commitment to keeping Jack safe, enough to not have decided to follow, three days in.
So yes, Castiel was indeed obsessed with his boyfriend's derriere, so what. It wasn’t an issue for him, and it certainly wasn’t an issue for Dean.
“Dean, baby. You cannot possibly be serious about going out like that” the conversation had taken place three weeks ago, before one of their Thursday night dates.
Castiel lapped at the Dean’s outer rim, circling the zone and moving south down now and then, caressing Dean’s balls, and back right up, kittenish licks finally landing in the middle. The teasing little muscle refused to be breached at first as Dean made a noise above him. Castiel spit on the hole, fat glob of saliva making it twinkle like the star it was.
Dean smiled, grateful and cheerful “’kay.”
Everything smelled of Dean, and Castiel was going crazy with the need to dig deeper, to have the full weight of Dean’s ass fall on his face as his boy went for a ride. He would die happy like that, Castiel thought, crushed by sweet ass.
“We still have over a week before handing it in, so I wouldn’t worry yet. I’m sure we can come up with something worthy of a B at least, but I really think you could get an A. You’re smart, and I can help polish your work.”
His cock was seeping profusely, a steady flow of pre-cum that added to the musky scent of the classroom. The door wasn’t even locked, but luckily the whole row of rooms in that hallway was unoccupied, which was why Mrs. Roberts had suggested it in the first place.
“I- Sorry. It was rude and uncivil, and I promise never to let petty gossip cloud my better judgement again. Just, please accept my apologies, Dean. It won’t happen again.”
Dean laughed, brash and spirited once again. He wiggled his ass, ever the tease and ducked to kiss Castiel on the lips.
He heard Dean chuckle and felt him shake his head. Opening his eyes, Cas could see a smile tugging upwards the corner of Dean’s mouth.
He’d never complain as long as he had Dean, his sweet, horny, beautiful Omega. His soon-to-be mate.
“Cas, shut up!”
Cas didn’t answer, he was much too preoccupied at the moment, but he did meet Dean’s heavy-lidded gaze and smiled. His tongue was curling inside Dean’s asshole, and with his finger he stroked the boy’s prostate. Dean shut his eyes forcefully, brow furrowing and an expression that resembled too much that of pain rearranging his delicate features into a grimace. However, Castiel knew it wasn’t pain Dean was experiencing, but an overwhelming, toe-curling pleasure of which his tight little hole was the primordial source.
“How about I prepare us some real breakfast, you big sap?” Dean asked, partly to deflect and partly because his stomach grumbled. “We can take Miracle for a walk when we’re done.”
Dean’s legs were already struggling with the effort not to sit, but Cas was not feeling charitable anymore. He’d always been grumpy upon waking and being with Dean didn’t erase that. He wanted Dean to squirm and pant and moan as he fucked himself on Cas’ tongue, just like the slut he was.
"Hey asshole! Snap a picture, won't you? It’ll last you longer."
“Never.”
Castiel leaned forward and placed an innocent peck on Dean’s plump lips, then wiped away the salty trails on his face with a thumb.
Castiel Novak absolutely fucking loved Dean Winchester and his perfectly plump, round ass. Admittedly, his boyfriend, ten years younger than him, was gorgeous all over, and although Castiel was biased, there was no denying that Dean was exceedingly attractive. It was a fact, plain and simple. The sun rose in the east, set in the west, and Dean Winchester was beautiful. Truth be told he was the single most beautiful human being Castiel ever laid eyes upon.
“Sorry to have disturbed your sleep, my love.” Cas placed an open-mouthed kiss on the downy ass cheek beneath him. “Trust you slept well?”
“What? It’s the truth, and I didn’t even eat half of it. Think I could get seconds?”
“Cas?”
After a couple minutes Dean calmed down and nodded. In his scent still lingered the heady notes of excitement brought by his outburst, but soon sultrier notres became more pronounced along with a wave of pheromones signaling the Omega’s mating call. Castiel’s half-formed knot pulsated in his jeans.
The shock on Dean's face was adorable, jaw dropped, eyebrows comically high and rounded by surprise. He seemed to be used to people sugar-coating their way to him, but Castiel was not of that sort, and he was feeling impatient. No time to beat around the bush.
Just then Cas has an idea, and it wasn’t a bad one either.
Castiel would love for Dean to embrace this side of him fully and freely –the wanton, whorish, brazenly sexual side–, to bask in it. He wanted Dean to ask to be fucked whenever the itch arose. Fuck. He wanted Dean to feel confident enough to demand Castiel break his ass in two with how hard he fucked him. But the demure twink façade Dean hid this side behind was not an act. There were things Dean genuinely found shameful, and that made it difficult for him to ask for certain things, made him guilty for wanting others.
Cranky, he’d almost skipped the start of his daily routine, but being a creature of habits, he reasoned it couldn’t do him any harm to pump some endorphins into his bloodstream.
“But are you… ashamed of me?”
Cas took pity on it and made a mental note to have Dean wear the largest butt plug in their collection throughout the day.
“Then what’s up with the seven-cigarettes-before-breakfast voice? I’d thought that was a custom Jimmy thing.”
Dean already regrets ever opening his mouth. It’s been too long of a pause. And then, Cas speaks up.
“Like hell you would.” Dean rolls his eyes, still breathing heavy. That brings Cas’s eyes back to his mouth, and
Cas wonders why.
There’s a tinge of worry. Only a smidge, and it still hurts. The last time Castiel hears Dean can’t be laced with anything bad. And it can’t be Castiel’s fault.
Cas’s smile grows wider, and Dean thinks he lets out a lightheaded chuckle.
“Dean, there’s no backseat in you, unless you mean your -”

Still, Dean picks up on it. Guarded walls come up to shelter something akin to fear. “You
“Ten years, we’ve known each other.” Dean looks up again. There’s too much in his eyes. “Forty years, I’ve been hunting. And I’m still the goddamn same, Cas. Angry, pissed-off, worthless. The hits just keep on coming, and all I do is bury myself in the losses, and then Sam or you screws my head on straight and we pull a miracle out of our asses, but end of the day, I’m this fucked-up, hurting piece of shit, and -”
, when Castiel checked the time, and the Dean on his lockscreen grinned up at him — and he doesn’t realize he’s fallen silent until Dean’s speaking again.
There’s a faint voice in the back, probably the real Cas, and then Dean’s back
There’s a scuffle, more bedsheets and pillows than anything else, followed by a satisfied sigh that probably signals Dean thinks it’s stopped recording, followed by a random mention of burgers, and then a more distinct, and sultry, ’

“Yeah, you are. Although it can’t stop my revenge being
“I love you, you son of a bitch.”
If Cas is going out to a ridiculous restaurant chain to win giant slinkies for Jack, Dean's driving him there. Hell, he might even win Cas something, if he's feeling lucky - like a discount on dessert, in case they stop to have lunch.
“I’m going to close my eyes.”
“Look, I can explain —”
So alright, Cas’s been waiting for this. Packing, planning and leaving. With Dean, and Dean’s familiar duffel, and his
Emotions shine at the corner of Dean’s eyes; years of keeping it all down, finally overcome. With the surfacing ruinness, Dean lets out a strained sound, and lets his head fall. Chin buried in his chest, at last, he forces out.

Dean sounds beautiful as always, and so familiar its like
Eileen stands up as well, shoulders sagging in defeat. She’d been more forward last night against interrupting Cas and Dean on their honeymoon, but at the moment? Not so much.
It feels like a strange thing to say, but it’s exactly what he means.
Later, when they’re both piled on top of each other on Dean’s chair; naked, exhausted, and secretly thankful for being vagina-less so they don’t have to worry about just having used a wallet-condom, Dean asks Cas, in the most incredulous tone he could manage. “I can’t believe you thought I wanted to date other people.”
“Well, we’d have to let go, first.” Cas points out, slow, and Dean tentatively does it first, ending up with his arms on his side again. Circling back to awkward, and adorable in his nervousness. But Cas doesn’t let him fold in, and retreat into himself, because now that he’s got Dean saying yes, and Dean asking him to, of course he’s putting his arms around him.
He just goes to sleep, euphoric.
, says his entire posture, folded in. But it's about a lot more than a (probably) refundable crop-top now, and Cas knows Dean knows it too.
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel interrupts, a hoarse whisper, and he thinks he hears a sob from the general direction of the love of his life.
He forces a smile into his voice while saying it. As if it doesn’t break him that he’ll never get to see Dean again. But he

to hear himself say it anyway. Plus, his head feels too numb to keep words inside anymore. It’s less a prison of thoughts, and more a canyon of loss.
? - more space.” Cas stops abruptly. “Dean, what are you doing - ?”
So when Cas tries to render a small smile, because it felt like the silence needed to be reacted to - needed one of them to pull off, there’s no way for him to know that it’ll push them over the edge. Dean wrenches away from him, and Cas sees the strings holding him stoic, snap.
. Dean’s been an idiot to have been trying to ignore the things he feels, because if he’d gotten here sooner, he could’ve had more of Cas looking at him like that, and Cas’s hands planted warmly on his sides, and Cas just smiling at him from this close.

guys wear them, I ‐ I guess."
Holy shit, it’s Cas.
"Uh —" Dean looks down at his feet.
More tears fall.
And Dean — well, he does go on.
When they separate, Dean realizes he’s almost done with his however-many-th bottle, and flings it at Sam who catches it in a rare stroke of luck. He proceeds to collect as many emptied bottles as he can in his ginormous arms, to drop off at the kitchen because he’s a regular boy Scout like that — and then waves goodnight at the two of them before hobbling off to his room.
Cas reseats himself next to Dean, bright-eyed and satisfied.
The kiss is different from the ones before, but just as passionate as it is soft. It’s Cas’s turn, apparently, because tears start to fall from his eyes, and Dean swipes the pads of his thumbs over his cheeks, hands cupping Cas’s face, and kissing him fully, and thoroughly.
Dean nods.
(He doesn’t want to die.)
“You’re not dying.” Cas informs him. (Himself?) “And I’m very attached to you, Dean.” As if to prove his point, Dean - Cas - brings his hand up to touch his own cheek. Grazing the skin, gentle, his fingertips trace along his jaw, all the way to his chin.
“Fine.” Cas, again - maybe Sam was imagining this, or maybe his voice really does come down half an octave. This way or that, Cas projects the word with the sort of insufferability that’s long been associated with Dean’s stubbornness. There’s a ponderous pause, like he’s not quite done yet. “But you’re bigger.”
“Sam Winchester, you’re a treasure to mankind.” He tells Sam proudly, earning a snort from Dean, and a bark of laughter from the ‘treasure’ himself, as he lugs himself to his feet with a relaxed 'that’s my cue’ look at Dean.
Dean’s saying, in what Sam identifies from numerous times in the past, as his ‘Cas’ voice.
It’s been a long, long night of research — which, let’s be fair, is only fun if successful — and right
But it will never be him again.)
What the fuck it
That tone is familiar — meaning they're finally where Cas has been trying to get. "Fine." He purses his lips. "Who?"
“So you - you
Maybe, in some way, they knew this talk was coming. Dean and Cas have been hooking up for months, and pretending it hasn’t been happening for longer than that. Dean knows they’ve both had difficult pasts - Cas had had to run away from his family, and the first girl he fell for had ruined the last of his trust in people. Dean himself has had a tough time coming terms with himself, and dealing with John’s voice in his head telling him what he is, isn’t natural.
