He slips into the taxi and the door slams behind him. I stare after the silhouette of his curly hair through the rear windshield as the taxi pulls away and gets swallowed up in the flow of traffic.
? He's pretty sure from Sherlock's behaviour since then that he'd hurt him quite a bit by how he'd left things.
Though still in a sling, he tried to keep busy. He packed up the apartment that he and the woman who had called herself
lunges forward, pinning me, hands everywhere, holding me down, clawing and ripping at me. "John," he urges and his hands are tearing at my clothes. My flesh. His voice is rising until it rattles on all my nerves. "John? John! JOHN!"
"You gave him the Hong Kong accounts," I add, trying to hasten the conversation along. Sherlock is being strangely silent.
“Yeah,” Gary confirms with a nod. “We protect each other.” They look at each for a long moment. Then Billy turns towards the camera, leaning forward and talking quickly and excitedly.
John's shoulders drop immediately once he's inside. Not only is it comfortably warm and dry but the plush seats and the rich smell of leather, wood, and roses envelopes him. This car is more chic and luxurious than anything John has ever been in before. He can’t help but look around with awe. All the expensive materials and refined details speak of quality that only a disgusting amount of money can buy. When his gaze drifts back around to the woman, her smile is slow and knowing.
Sherlock feels the loss in John’s body retreating and he pushes up again, but John does not lean back in. He waits calmly.
It is not unlike the atmosphere in the flat these past few weeks. A veneer of the familiar over a somehow freneticly enhanced substrate.
“Anger?” John smirks looking up at Sherlock with that exquisite sparkling in his eyes of awe and the thrill of a perfectly reasoned solution. Sherlock drinks it in. It is one of his favourite expressions in all the world.
"I am capable of seeing details others overlook." His voice is purposely low and hollow of everything so that he sounds bored. "Using a process of logic and reason, I use the data I observe to form accurate conclusions. Simple."
There are words he wants to say, small but powerful words, however he knows them to be feeble, inadequate for the truth and impossibly abstract. His insides squirm and he feels something working its way up into his chest towards his lungs, so he swallows them, shoves it all down and grabs for something safer.
This is a frequent occurrence of late. The familiar dichotomy of nearly motionless trances and vibrant, boundless energy has slowly shifted to a constant buzz of barely contained verve and constant vigilance.
John feels the familiar sting immediately, but he rolls over on top of Sherlock, covering him as he pulls up his British Army L9A1. In the space of a heartbeat he’s shot the gunman square between the eyes. The murdering bastard crumples into a pile on the floor. John holds him in his sights a few seconds longer before he lets out a long breath and collapses around Sherlock.
“We need to go, Billy,” the figure says slowly, as its eyes return to the young man standing by the table.
Sherlock freezes. His eyes go wide and his gaze is distant as his mouth forms into a perfect circle of revelation. "Oh.
My palms itch to reach out and grab him - as I had then - to put him between the wall and my body - pin him in and make him confess whatever is behind all this. But, remembering the surveillance cameras watching us, I shift my eyes to just over his shoulder, clench my hands into fists and wait for him to reveal what he plans to do. He draws right up to me with an invasive stare studying me.
He can feel a wet patch forming near John’s tip. He whimpers in spite of his efforts to stay silent. He runs his fingers through the dampness and quickly touches it to his lips; tasting cotton and John’s essence. The flesh of John’s neck is growing tacky with sweat beneath Sherlock’s cheek. He barely restrains the urge to lick that too; taste him with sex and adrenaline in his pores.
The smell of earth and mint and John mixing with the dust and rust and old grease of the disused machines... the slightest whiff of gunpowder overlaid with the sharp metallic scent of blood, so heavy it almost has a taste on the tongue… even as it cools to a tacky film on the tips of trembling and numb fingers.
“Give me a minute,” Sherlock snaps irritably. He knows that outside, in the real world, the seconds are ticking by and soon his pause will be long enough that
“Like?” Dimmock's brow is furrowed with shocked confusion. Perhaps it's because Sherlock seems so virulent and malicious in contradicting him and he can't help but sense that this is about something
The familiar hum of Baker Street resumes. In one bound, Sherlock is standing on his bed; tiptoed, every muscle at full extension upward, strained muscles quivering and his head tilted to the side.
He hears John sigh and adjust in his seat behind him. He closes his eyes. The weight of John's stare is burning into his back, and the things John refuses to say hang in the air above Sherlock, pressing into his skin. He feels stripped naked in a completely different way. He shifts, drawing his legs up towards his chest and curling into a ball beneath the covers. As much as he'd prefer to dismiss this and give into his exhaustion and sleep, he can't. He sees himself through John's eyes and it cuts to the bone.
Sherlock swallows down the nausea trying to force its way past the lump in his throat. His heart is still racing and his breathing is too quick. The sheet swaddling him now feels itchy and claustrophobic.
“Don’t you dare,” she says playfully punching him lightly in the arm. “You were the best thing could have happened to me, Sherlock Holmes. Got me away from that creep, Magnussen, and out to my cottage in Sussex Downs. Nice place, really. I’ve just redecorated. You should call down... Or I can slum it - stop by Baker Street.” She smiles.
“You're so - and I really shouldn't-” John's hands are in his hair and his eyes are wide in panic. “I'm drunk and you're
But alas, people can be counted on for little aside from being unobservant and completely oblivious to what is right before their eyes. No one seems to notice. Everyone talks and looks and acts towards him as if he is the same boy that went to bed the night before, alone and ignorant to the universe of new possibilities now opening up inside him. It is a bit maddening, how ignorant and oblivious they all are. How vacant and unseeing their return gazes.
“Just hold on-” I shout back. I release Sherlock to crouch down and meet the cabbie’s eye, offering a finger - not the one he
"Idiot. Idiot. Idiot," Sherlock mutters as he proceeds to pull a pair of tailored trousers that match his suit jacket from his wardrobe.
“You want to know why no-one came to save me? ”Sherlock fumes; eyes swirling with dark emotions. “I’ll tell you why, because I killed them or I made them leave.” He lifts his head weakly, glaring at her with all his strength.
He sighs and looks towards the window, straightening his spine. He can't do this anymore. Sherlock made his choice and moved on and now it's time for John to take the lot he has been given and do the same.
Standing in the place where John first lay on the floor and staring at his mussed bed, he concludes that, logically, there is no value in dwelling on something that happened in the past. No amount of reflection and analysis will alter it. It is unlikely he will ever encounter John again, since their paths had never crossed previously. So, it is a closed matter that he must put aside and move on from.
"What do you want, Lestrade?" He steps in front of John, his whole demeanor transformed in a million small ways that radiate confidence and authority, even in little more than a silk robe. "Something has changed with the case, or you wouldn't be here."
generally swells, filling him with an irrational compulsion to scream at his friend or list to him every twisted, selfish, demented thing he has ever done.
He is a dark storm of fury as he sweeps through the flat and marches up the stairs to John’s bedroom.
“You were what?!” They both look at Molly again, who has gone pale and wide-eyed. Her stare is snapping between the two of them as if she is desperately trying to work it all out. "With Sherlock?"
Sherlock bristles with the familiar sting of a thinly veiled insult of intelligence. Shoulders shifting in something like a shrug to try to shake off the weight of that cool and calculating stare, Sherlock draws his hand away from the book, turns and walks a few paces to stand before the other shelf.
Latin. Indicative of a force or situation that is generally destructive or unfavorable. She's not necessarily a threat to me
“Mmm. Don’t know,” John mumbles. Then his hands come up and land on Sherlock’s ribs. Sherlock freezes. He can still leave. He
He moves to lie down on the bed and he pulls the covers up over himself. He breathes deeply and tries to push himself back through his memory, to last night. He closes his eyes and an image begins to resolve.
He grips Sherlock's hand and whilst Sherlock tries to keep his arm stiff, the man pushes forward and leans into Sherlock's space encasing the seized hand in both of his own.
In spite of the dangerous desire to plunge in with both feet, John keeps the pace slow and relaxed, building the intensity like a beautiful waltz. It might have been completely consuming and overwhelming to Sherlock, yet, because it is John, it is interspersed with moments of playfulness and a sort of innocent joy that keeps Sherlock from withdrawing in self-protection.
“Take my air, Sherlock. Just breathe. It’s fine. You can do it, Sherlock. See, we are breathing,” John is murmuring. The soft lips close over his again and warm, wet air pushes into his lungs, gentler this time. He can feel it spread, infusing his blood with not just oxygen but bits of John; strength and devotion that makes the fiery, life-stealing creature dissipate like so much smoke. He is coughing it out, trying to rid himself of the poison.
He strips off his jeans, tosses them on the pile with his jumper and shirt and goes to his sock drawer to get a spare bottle of lube. It is a twist of fate that, as a byproduct of needing to frequently take his covert desire for Sherlock (quite literally) in hand, he is now armed with an abundance of supplies. John holds the tube in his hand, considering it a moment, then nods decisively. He must choose his battles in order to win the war. Though he would prefer to take this slow, savor it, building towards the intimate act of intercourse after the prerequisite romance, it is absurd to expect Sherlock to play by ordinary rules of engagement.
friction against the bed more frustrating than satisfying, yet he can't bring himself to stop. He bites down on the pillow to choke back moaning John's name.
“Oh,” he says softly, a peaceful awe washing over him, like warm sunlight. It is gentle waters of loving comfort lapping at his feet. He finds he wants to sink into it, to surrender, to slip beneath it and let it carry him away.
Every time Watson focuses on the voice the burning in his chest becomes excruciating. With determination, Watson pushes towards it. He grabs onto the wisp of sound like a rope and pulls at it, to haul himself back towards the end; shedding parts of himself in the pounding waves of destruction. It is ripping him apart. Just when he thinks he can't hold on any longer, it pulls him free of his own skin to float above his body. He looks down to see himself laying in his cot, arms folded over his chest, eyes closed.
He gives up and yanks. He will buy him a new bloody shirt. A thousand shirts. He has no want for money. When you have lasted thousands of years, it is remarkably easy to set up substantial means of financial security. He could live quite opulently if he so chose, but he’d found centuries ago that being rich was rather…
An exasperated sigh echos against the tile of the bathroom walls as John lets his head bow again; chin resting on his chest.
“John?” It is choked and has a slight wobble in the middle that cannot be helped since the whole universe is wobbling on its axis.
John’s smile is soft; amused, sad and aroused and, even after all these years, so complex that Sherlock has no idea how everyone doesn’t suspect that the soul within is thousands of years old.
“Sherlock!” My voice is hushed but with that harsh, commanding edge from my army days. I've stepped forward and squared my body to him to make it clear that that was
The grin is still lingering on Sherlock's lips when his gaze sweeps back across the courtyard. He finds John standing where Mary left him, hands in his pockets, his head tilted to the side, and an expression of surprise and confusion on his face.
and that concerns himself with nothing but solving mysteries. The cold and manipulative MI6 agent that tried to seduce me, then cast me aside the minute he had my aligenance secured. In many ways, it is easier to accept and believe in
“I never said thank you,” Sherlock says quietly. The bark of laughter from Lestrade makes Sherlock look up.
Sherlock takes two steps towards the window. His face has gone darker and his hands are lifted slightly as he tries to work something out.
So much had happened in those weeks since our last appointment. Yet, many of those incidents are things I wouldn't dare to share with her even
John stares at him as if he might be speaking a foreign language; eyes narrowed to slits and brow furrowed. “I've upset you."
It was devastating for John. He ached to hold his friend and yet knew he was the cause of the man’s fear. Somehow, without even being awake, he’d managed to destroy everything that was most important to him. He hadn’t seen it coming. There was nothing he could do to make this better.
Reaction to a tough case causes a big shift in relationship dynamics as Sherlock realizes he failed to take into account all the variables in his experiment in intimacy with John.
John may not have Sherlock’s superhuman intelligence, but he has always been quick to learn and not repeat mistakes. He had long ago concluded that his interest was unwelcome. After a miserably failed attempt at subtly flirting during their first dinner, John restrained his feelings and squashed all signs of interest. After all, Sherlock consistently expresses nothing but disdain for sex and romance generally and a complete lack of interest in John
“Supraventricular tachycardia,” Captain Watson spits the words like curses. “Push 1.5ng/ml Digoxin.”
“Well, what’s the plan?” Mind Palace John quirks a half smile as his form shimmers and settles into something more solid. He is standing beside his bed in his perfect navy blue boxers, his arms folded over his chest and an eyebrow cocked expectantly. “I know you’ve a plan.”
“At this juncture you are going to try to convince me, with some ridiculous babble that you no doubt picked up from your sham of a psychiatrist, that anxiety and panic attacks are a normal response of the body to a situation that it perceives as dangerous.” His voice becomes a hiss, “I am
John is on his side, one arm folded to prop up his own head on the pillow and the other resting lightly on his stomach. He is smiling that incandescent, warm smile, and his eyes sparkle in the low light.
snogging. Just look at how adorably flustered you are. I could never get that much of a rise out of you, and I was naked on your lap.”
In an endless moment, it teeters there, wanting to pull back the veil and reveal itself fully to John Watson. Wanting to join him in that intimate moment. It feels compelled to answer the man's gift of vulnerability with equal measure.
“I don't care for most people,” Sherlock tries for a patronising tone with a sneer of distaste. “I don't imagine I'd enjoy having their tongue down my throat.”
“You will have to go back into your body, Henry.” The warm light flowing through Henry from the entity's grasp on his wrist is making him leaden and he sinks to the earth, feeling more solid. The room loses some of its ephemeral glow; more noise and colour bleeding through. The figure pushes Henry towards the operating table and Henry sits down on it.
He convinced himself that if Sherlock was not going to come to him it was better to let his gunshot wound fully heal before forcing the issue and seeking him out. After all, he wanted Sherlock to see him healthy. Given what Sherlock must be going through in grieving Mycroft, he didn’t want to inflict more emotional pain by showing up wounded.
“I won’t do it Sherlock. I won’t fuck you.” John’s voice is so quiet but firm and absolute. Sherlock could just cry.
“This is clearly a mess of your making.” Sherlock is growing more confident now, dark delight coiling through his insides as he watches John's control crumble.
After the last nine days, he wouldn't be surprised by just about anything Sherlock does. It's been a good refresher on an essential part of what has always made them work well together. From the start, John has existed in the moment - taking things as they come and waiting for Sherlock to put things into context when he is ready to reveal the big picture. John hadn't tried to overthink things and project his own expectations onto the situation, or onto Sherlock. Unmet expectations seemed to be the main reason everyone else got so frustrated with Sherlock - expecting the
“Haven't we?” Sherlock turns away. He places his hands flat on the desk and looks out the window. He can get through this.
really.” Sherlock observes John, hoping his words are conveying the meaning he needs them to now. He desperately wants to keep John a bit longer. “I know you will leave me… One way or another… All I can do is wait… I wait, for you to come… to leave… to return… to leave again… I wait, in the knowledge - the hope anyways - that there will always be this.
Billy, looks nearly ready to burst with excitement. Gary throws his arm around the smaller man, a quiet smile on his face. As John sings, the camera pans around him, remaining fixed on him as he turns so that behind him two chairs beside a roaring fire come into view.
“No. He doesn’t.” he speaks firmly with conviction because he doesn’t doubt this - not now - not after what happened tonight. “I don't know what you think you've worked out but he’s made it clear…  I’m
that John loved him. He still can't remember anything but fragments of that night, but it seems like John might have said something to confirm her assertion and then he apparently proposed some sort of shift in their relationship. Irene had clearly forced John's hand into confessing his attraction and now it seems fitting that she is going to provide him the lever to pry John away from some succubus tart that hopes to bed then wed him. She is proving to be a valuable tool.
Sherlock…" John's smile is warm and softened by the alcohol, but it manages to capture some of the exasperation that is usually Sherlock's specialty when he finds himself needing to state something obvious. John leans forward in his chair a little, as if to share a secret. "I am going to need a genius to figure out a plan if I am ever going to get off that bloody island.”
“No,” John says stilling Sherlock with a firm grasp on his thighs. His weight shifts then a tube of lubricant is being pressed into Sherlock's hand. John briefly leans over him, body pressing him down into the mattress as he whispers in his ear. “I want to watch. Show me how you prepared yourself, Sherlock.”
It may not be a challenge but Sherlock eagerly takes it as such. He is a great cat closing in on prey as he springs up, strides over the bed and, in an instant, plants himself in front of John. He moves in close and looms over the shorter man with every bit of menace he can muster; narrowing his eyes into slits, body taut as a strung bow - meeting fire with fire.
When you deduced that she had a suitcase from a splash pattern on her leg I wanted to snog you senseless. Might have done, dead body be damned, if Lestrade wasn’t standing there. You turned my world on its head and I’d have followed you anywhere from then on.
He can't remember having done anything specific to tick Sherlock off, but he is a fickle beast. He doesn't really believe Donovan's assertion that the consulting detective is a psychopath capable of murdering someone for the thrill of it. That is not what he sees at all when he looks at the man he has been living with. Sherlock may have a scientific view of the deceased, and be driven to find solutions to the point of being oblivious to the feeling of others, but he is not
I startle out of sleep with the sensation of something pressing down on my face. I struggle to fight it off but, as I breathe in, my head spins and I sink even deeper into that gray, dreamless abyss.
I almost object out of defensive reflex but she holds up her hand to stop me as she fixes me in her no-nonsense stare. "Let's not waste time, John. We both know you wouldn't be here if
“What are you looking for?” John’s head is tilted to the side and his somewhat amused smile is made soft by his sleepy, half-lidded eyes. They’re bluer when framed by his blonde lashes like this. There's no less than five distinct colors; sapphire, aegean, cerulean, slate, and lapis. Is that prussian blue as well? Prussian blue; produced via oxidizing ferrous ferrocyanide salts. It's a cure for certain kinds of poisoning… And when did John move so close?
There's a pressure to the air of a room after a fight has happened within it. I can't say what it is exactly; some shift in the energy so subtle it can only be felt on the subconscious level; like the charged atmosphere after a thunderstorm. It makes me bristle.
"Fine. I'll deduce it, then," he says at last with clear irritation. His eyes flick over John and his expression transforms into that sharply focused and analytical gaze he'd used when studying the corpse at the crime scene.
Sherlock gave a slight shudder, obviously missing the combined heat generated by their bodies and having his friend to act as a barrier against the cold night air. He suddenly seemed small, lonely and fragile. A familiar protectiveness surged in John’s chest; a need to keep this remarkable man safe from the world.
Sherlock has never coped well with vulnerability. Being exposed makes unpredictably irratic. It seems to spark in Sherlock fear, that is a recipe for an explosion of catastrophic proportions.
that set the chair up to block the door," Sherlock grumbles on the other side of the door. At least he's stopped throwing his weight against it.
John tipped his head and pursed his lips, feeling something swell in his chest as his mind flooded with snippets of memory of watching that impressive figure sweep through rooms, dash down alleys and jump across rooftops with a striking poise and swiftness, all while wearing a tailored suit and posh shoes worth more than John's entire wardrobe. Even now, in his housecoat and pajamas the man had an undefinable grace about him.
. He couldn't see Sherlock's face, couldn't tell his expression, but he didn’t need to. Sherlock had said it in the exact same tone that he had once used while standing on the rooftop of Bart’s looking down at John
The Game Master chuckled gleefully as he punched in the next two numbers of the code. He cooed about how
When I return to the lobby, it appears that Sherlock has yet to return from his investigation. Determined that he won't have the chance to dash off without me once again, I station myself by the elevator and wait. I naturally fall into a military parade rest; feet shoulder-length apart and hands clasped behind my back. I let my eyes drift over the tide of patrons flowing through the bank; an endless parade of city boys and office workers in expensive suits and skirts - a mind-numbingly boring assortment of muted blues, beige, grays and blacks. They move quickly. Self-absorbed and brimming with focus and determination, their polished shoes and high heels clack sharply on the smooth marble. It doesn’t take Sherlock to identify the plain clothes security guards among them.
Sherlock turns towards me and takes in my stance; slightly crouched, gun aimed and at the ready, as my eyes scan the room for threats.
John smiles and sits back on the sofa his ankle on his knee and his arms on the back of the couch spread wide. He gazes off to his right. “Well, I was quiet… Mostly kept to myself… Was what you might call a
“It's…” Sherlock takes a slow shaky breath. He shakes his head back and forth and tries to disconnect from his body enough to sort his thoughts. “Can we… perhaps… lay down?” Sherlock asks tentatively. He feels John freeze, his breath catching in his chest. “It’s just… I feel more…
He is shivery, and there’s an immense feeling of fatigue as he at last lifts his eyes to numbly survey the destruction. He is surprised to meet the gaze of Lestrade sitting directly in front of him on a chair, forearms on his spread knees, fingers woven together as he leans forward. His brown eyes are surprisingly soft and compassionate. Waves of embarrassment and regret crash over Sherlock along with anger and disappointment.
“I didn't do it... You're thinking I killed him but, I should say, I didn't kill him... Borrowed him from the hospital morgue for an experiment.”
"Oh good, I do so love the spirited ones," she remarks with an overly bright smile and a little shimmy of excitement. She brushes her hair back. "I could work myself to exhaustion breaking you in." Her feet slip back down to the floor and she leans forward with her elbows on her knees and a heated look in her eyes. She's too close in the limited space and very intentionally providing a view down her dress. "Would you like me to try, John?"
" He looks Lestrade right in the eyes. It is not a card he plays often; at least not so blatantly. Overplaying this point could just as easily get Sherlock temporarily banned from crime scenes. Lestrade will likely solve the case on his own
Sherlock is breathless with laughter, can’t seem to stop, doesn’t want to stop but she has slipped her hand over his again; holding it, patiently searching his face.
"The front door was open, isn't that correct John?" I feel Sherlock turn his eyes on me, but my stare is already fixed on DI Dimmock. When the DI turns his gaze on me, I shamelessly play up the military angle, since that seems to appeal to him. Sherlock certainly isn’t the
“You’re all bluster and bravado trying to bullshit your way through this - bully your way into my bed.” John's tone has shifted to something sterner, the edge of frustration and reprimand slipping in. “But you can't. Not this time. Not with
As this thought forms and takes root, John hears a deep rumble that shakes him to his core and shivers up his spine to vibrate at the base of his skull.
McDonnell is taking deep, ragged breaths of the sedating gas in his mask and the panicked edge in his eyes has dulled. He reaches up and clutches Watson's forearm tightly, then nods at him with determination. His expression speaks of gratitude and relief. Then McDonnell’s grip loosens and his eyes slide closed and his hand falls limp to the gurney. The moment he slips into unconsciousness, Watson's demeanor flips, like a switch.
Sherlock mentally takes stock of what provoked this reaction. The need for adaquate distraction had reached epic proportions today. While the resulting experiments had been fairly productive, Sherlock can sense that John is not pleased with the somewhat hazerdous state of dissaray that has overtaken their sitting room. Papers are strewn across every surface next to piles of smashed Christmas ornaments; separated by material, color and size of shards. The weapons and blunt objects that caused the related damage are laid out beside each pile.
“That’s that then.” She taps her finger against her cheek, looking thoughtful. “Right. The note.” She reaches into the folds of her cape. “Really sweet, that. Makes me wish I wasn’t on me tod. Must find meself a romantic one.” She thrusts the note into his direction, laughing gently. Sherlock takes it and clasps his hands behind his back. He clears his throat and looks around before tucking his chin and looking up at her. He takes a deep breath.
I've had my fair share of nightmares since returning from the war, but this was like nothing I've experienced before. Could it even be considered a nightmare when I'd spent the better part of it aroused?
If he wasn't overwhelmed with pain, Sherlock might be able to better wallow in the horrifyingly intimate predicament he'd managed to force them both into. It's humiliating. But right now he's in too much pain to even try to move away from John. He knows that, once the pain subsides enough to extract himself from John's reluctant embrace, he'll only have what meagre dignity remains in rejecting before he can be properly rejected once again. So, he lays there, panting, and desperately trying to work out what to say to save face. Surely there is a harsh comment or pointed observation to be made to put John on the defensive.
"What now?" John takes another step back, his shoulders rising with tension "What did I do now?!" For Christ's sake, Sherlock abandoned him halfway across London without a word of parting, how did John somehow end up being the one getting yelled at here?
Sherlock lets out a harsh, vaguely disgusted breath through his nose, and pushes past me to stride after her. I can't decide if I am imagining it or if he intentionally keeps his gangly form and large, fluttery coat positioned between me and the flirtatious secretary just to obstruct my view.
Sherlock takes a deep, trembling breath. He can feel the vibration of John’s energy, the heat of his body. He looks at John’s hand and wants to to grasp it, but resists the urge. They have not done
When John was 16 he inherited a car from a distant relative that passed away. Truth be told, it was only given to him because no one else wanted it. Just a rusty, old, beat-up junker with nearly 320,000 kilometers already on the odometer but, as his first taste of freedom, it was exhilarating. For that reason alone, he'd cherished it as something glorious.
Sherlock looks completely lost and a bit like he might get sick. His chin drops and his eyes dart around as if he's looking for something to tell him what is really going on here. He swallows and focuses on John.
Obviously, now that John had sobered up, he realises once more that he ‘isn't gay’ and kissing a bloke is a rather repulsive thing for a heterosexual male.
No one spoke or even looked my way as I mumbled a morning greeting. It was more for show than anything. I knew Sherlock would ignore me but hadn't quite figured out Mycroft's role or level of threat in Sherlock's larger mission. Hiding the immense fissures between Sherlock and I seemed like the safest approach. Sherlock, apparently, didn't care to feign civility though.
"No, I'm not saying-" John takes a deep breath and eases back onto his heels putting his hands up in a placating gesture. He hadn't meant to put Sherlock on the defensive for being aroused. "It's fine, Sherlock. That's all fine."
He was curled in a ball making pathetic little sighs. God he hated seeing Sherlock so out of sorts. He wanted his friend back; to joke, to smile and to laugh. He missed the comfortable companionship of their quiet moments. John adored Sherlock’s dark sense of humor and those brilliant little insights that always were pleasingly random.
He is right there across the room, but Sherlock knows that he can’t simply ask him for the missing vitally important information about what exactly he wants.
“Oh. Ok,” John says with a small smile of encouragement. John's expression is open, caring, a little concerned but kind. It is not at all what Sherlock expects in the face of such an earth-shattering conversation. He re-evaluates everything, trying to work out what he's missed that would warrant this reaction from John. He considers that this is failing as miserably as their first and only conversation about a potential relationship, during that first evening with John at Angelo's.
When his gaze found Sherlock and the ex-soldier realized it was him that the disheveled younger man was terrified of it felt as if someone had sliced him across the stomach and pulled his guts out through that gaping hole.
“Well…” My shrug is awkward and I know it, but I plaster on a smile. Between his beady eyes and smug, slimey smile, Wilkes registers somewhere between rat and snake in personal appeal for me, but I don't want to appear as if I'm disparaging Sherlock for his (potential?) interest or for some past relationship with the man. “I suppose... the slick hair, the expensive suit, the sly smile… can be appealing, yeah?” I press my lips together and lift my eyebrows, trying to appear as positive and open as possible to his potential confession of interest in Sebastian, even though my stomach is clenched into a fist.
“Alright,” Miranda says softly and she climbs into the cab after Kellie. Her face is set in a deep frown and disappointment is in her eyes as they pull away. He feels a flicker of guilt over chatting her up then letting her down, but quickly puts her out of his mind as he jogs to the alley. He slows as he gets to the end of the building, peeking around the corner to assess the situation.
“A man that has had intimate relations monthly since our association, often unsatisfactory, with a variety of mediocre partners...”
He waits a moment, taking in all the sensation, then he slowly sweeps his hand up to John’s neck. He feels John swallow and hum as Sherlock moves his fingers around to feel the bristly hair at the base of his skull.
These many months later there are both fewer barriers and significantly more risks in considering the possibility.
John and Sherlock look at each other a long second and then they both brake down in a fit of laughter.
“Mmmm, ok.” And suddenly John is up, off the floor, and lumbering over the footboard. He flops clumsily into Sherlock's bed with a harumph.
- over me. That’s his game. He gets off on it - taking with ease another’s hard-won prize. Feeds his ego.” Sherlock’s eyes are blazing fury and he’s grown quite close to me in his rising furor. “What he can’t destroy completely, he sullies then tosses aside - broken, like so much rubbish - just to prove he can. You’ll be no different. He’ll
In general, I don't take well to being threatened. Anger flares white hot in my chest. I clench my hands into fists.
From (far too much) personal experience, John knows that if Sherlock gets scared, instead of dealing with it in any rational, straightforward manner, there is likely to be an epic row and John may well end up drugged, locked in a cage and scared witless.
“Stay,” John says firmly in a low murmur. He lifts up and one hand briefly presses on the back of Sherlock’s neck, holding him firmly to the mattress, before it begins an agonizingly slow path down his spine. Even after the heat and pressure of John's body draped over him leaves, Sherlock doesn't dare move. He stays still, hands clasped behind his back, eyes crushed closed, panting into the mattress.
He is standing outside a large wrought iron fence, in the background are the Queen’s guard in their distinctive black bearskin hats.
They stare at each other in silence a long moment and something in the air shifts; there is weight and electricity. John's hands work at his side, clenching and unclenching, and he realises he is swaying. He’s only had half a beer so far, so he isn’t sure why he feels so lightheaded.
“That's not what your instincts are telling you.” The man's face is placid, almost serene in its lack of expression. Yet, his eyes are trained on John with the keenness of a falcon. “You've superb instincts. You should trust them more.”
… Shot a bad guy to save my idiot flatmate… told off Mycroft again… dinner again.” John smiles. Sherlock smiles back. The silence turns oddly tense as Sherlock's mind begins to make connections it hasn't before around dinner... that first dinner with John... then another - Irene's insistence on dinner as a thinly veiled innuendo for sex.
Sebastian hands me the cheque and I thank him. I look down at it and shake my head in disbelief. £5000 is more than enough to straighten out my issues and this is only the advance. Relief washes over me as I tuck it into the inside pocket of my jacket and excuse myself.
All that adrenaline pounding through my system moments earlier is suddenly right there beneath the surface again, aching to split me open. He looms over me - far too close - and his whole body is tensed to the point that I think he might be quivering with barely restrained action, like the spring of a gun when the trigger is gently squeezed, straining to hold back the hammer until that moment of violent release.
” he replies softly. Her face flickers with amusement before it crashes down into sadness with the heavy truth of that statement.
John makes a sound in the back of his throat and it seems like acknowledgement of Sherlock’s shift in demeanor.
once your conscious was out of the way. Therefore, I need only provoke a rash, physical, reaction (beyond logic and reason) to loosen your tight reign of control.
was what the sadistic bastard called himself who took Moriarty’s place, gathering up the remnants of that criminal web for his own twisted purposes. He was every bit as intelligent as the psychopath that died on the roof of Bart’s, but doubly gleeful in indulging his immense cruelty. John shudders at the memory of the new
After 60 minutes John is looking more sober, with clearer eyes and less slurred words. It only makes sense that his body has had time to process the alcohol. However, he still seems giddy, often grinning like the Cheshire cat whenever they break apart to catch their breath. He also often mumbles little exclamations of praise that don't seem altogether voluntary, yet, they melt Sherlock's anxiety and stoke a heat deep within Sherlock.
After a frustrated grunt of protest, John seems to make up his mind to give as good as he gets and the soldier re-emerges. John fights back; carnal and demanding, his tongue, lips, and teeth quarrel with Sherlock’s with a deep and skillfully avaricious kiss. He sucks on Sherlock’s bottom lip, then nips and plunges his tongue in, forcing Sherlock’s questing tongue back into his own mouth. A hand twines itself into Sherlock’s curls at the back of his skull and tilts Sherlock’s head just right so John’s attack is even more devastating, invading Sherlock’s entire mouth with a fierce fervor. It steals Sherlock's breath and after only a moment of this brutal, skilled snogging, Sherlock is breaking away to gasp into John's shoulder again, feeling dizzy and drugged.
I drag my eyes from the file up to his face. He is watching me with his head tilted back so, even in our relatively equal positions, he can look down his nose at me. It's
When John steps out into the hall and turns to shut the door behind him his last glimpse of Sherlock finds the young man standing in the middle of the room and looking at the window with something like longing.
As he travels back to London, fingers running over the notes in his pockets,  he can't help but recall Hopkins impassioned words that day she had seen him hit rock bottom and offered to help him pick up the shattered pieces and move on.
Sherlock's brain snaps back to the hall where he is moving through molasses. "Are you listening to me?" John is right beside him now.
by virtue of Sherlock’s own special strength of character or some admirable force of will that he had somehow managed to endure being torn open. Existing past that moment when everything, including all his carefully laid defenses, were shattered around him could be no more considered an accomplishment than staying alive for 32 years could be defined as somehow making him victorious over death. There was no doubt who would win in the end, who had
beneath all the trappings, but even here, among the equally posh and bespoke, he stands out. There’s just something about him; arresting... enticing. He is practically gliding as he strides across the marble floor; back straight, and coat swishing around his calves. Contained within the long, lean lines of his body, he emanates a mix of power and elegance, fierceness and finesse - like some clever, wicked demon realised that beauty could be refined to a deadly point. Everyone else simply seems
Sherlock’s body, like his brain, is an oddity. By acceptable standards of attractiveness he considers he is far too lean and gaunt and, with his pallid skin, he can hardly be taken as a model of health and well-being. His height provides him some advantage; useful for intimidation. However, he must acknowledge that many of his features are more valued among the fairer gender; prominent cheekbones, above average lip volume and facial feature symmetry. Sherlock knows himself lacking in the more masculine features of a broad forehead, prominent chin and brow and chiseled jaw.
.” He was trying to make his voice forceful and insistent, but it came out all wrong. There was an edge of urgent need, like a whine.
"Sherlock," I growl, my gun steadily trained on where I estimate his head to be on the other side of the door. The door unlatches and he pushes it forward. However, it is halted with a loud screech after a few centimeters by the desk chair I'd wedged under the knob.
"I'm fine," Sherlock wheezes, straightening and lurching into motion again - moving towards the bed. He nearly pulls free from John's supportive grasp in his bluster. He sucks in great gasps of air that strain his inflamed ribs, but the physical pain doesn't drown out the
You are obviously choosing not to understand - retreating into some feeble attempt at feigned ignorance-”
Sherlock looks down at it, then turns away towards the wall again. He knows every smallest detail of that photo. He has spent many an hour gazing at it. He knows his own face is smooth and impassive, as always, eyes a practised blank. He is seated with his legs crossed in his fine, Victorian attire. However, it is the man stood behind him that Sherlock’s eyes are inevitably drawn to. The tilt of the man’s mustache betrays a familiar smirk, the lively glint in his eyes is evident even in the grainy, sienna toned tintype. The man’s strong, gentle hand is curled around Sherlock’s shoulder. He can still feel it at times; the subtle pressure, the reassurance, the protectiveness, the slightest bit of possessiveness in that touch. It had made his heart flutter in his chest. It still does.
“Done. Just the one nasty lump." He tries to make his voice light to counterbalance the tension. "Should go down in a couple days.”
Sherlock wades through the gray, swirling fog of his mind with nothing more than flashes from the previous night pushing through; nebulous, shimmering phantoms that skitter away before he can place hands on them. He searches for some source of this internal chaos.
I reach into the jar and take a bright red one, the same colour that Artemis had. These types of lollies are not exactly a rare item
That simple touch sends such electricity through Sherlock's body. He wants more. He contemplates all the times he has attempted to make a move on John. There was the alley where he had wanted to kiss John, there was the sheet incident, the weighted blanket incidents, and he had all but offered himself up on a platter just now, but still it always seems to go awry as John moves in oddly tangential and unpredictable directions. If this were an experiment Sherlock would assume there was an unknown variable causing results to skew.
I swivel my eyes back around to Sherlock and consider him. His mood seems much improved from earlier. He's practically vibrating with energy; apparently high on the challenge and invigorated by the mystery unraveling before him. It's captivating to see him this way after, what I now realise (by witnessing the contrast), must have been a depressive funk hanging over him this last week. He really does feed off of this sort of thing.
I am supposed to be buying him time but instead I'm bringing on the End Game that much quicker. If I had just kept my feelings out of it during the ruse of us having sex, they'd still be biding their time.
I let out a disbelieving sound that's not quite a laugh at the absurdity of Sherlock, a highly capable and deadly MI6 agent, being considered a
"Right." John looks unconvinced. He rubs his hand over his chin, then purses his lips as if holding in something.
Or they find it both unpleasant and pleasant." He casually runs a finger over a divot in the headboard and John can feel it on his skin; goose flesh is pricking up on his arm and along his spine. "Which, I suppose, neurologically speaking, there is some evidence to support such claims, in that pleasure and pain use the same neurochemical pathways and are processed in the same centers of the brain. Evidence of a foray into sexual deviance is her preferred method of entrapment," Sherlock is inspecting a schedule on John's cork board now. "Of course, that would be the first possibility to eliminate.
to look it all in the eye. So he just stayed submerged in the numbing delusion, letting momentum carry him forward.
Sherlock exhales sharply and rolls his eyes at his own frivolous thoughts. He flips over to face the back of the couch and curls himself up into a ball, wrapping his blue housecoat tightly around himself, like a cocoon. It is a poor substitute for John's comforting weight pressing down on him.
Sherlock turns his head to look up at John, prepared to protest. A sensation suddenly thrusts itself upon him from his memory.
; fingers moving rapidly over the keyboard, posture public school straight even in his old t-shirt, pajamas bottoms and blue robe. John's blood begins to heat, rushing into his cheeks. He tears his gaze away to fix his eyes on the fireplace as his mind casts back to last night.
As much as that moment hurt, John would make that same choice again and again; putting the gun to his own head and pulling the trigger for that one moment of knowing the true depths of Sherlock’s love for him.
“No,” Sherlock interjects. His muffled growl is clear and sharp. He twists his hands a little in the fabric of the coat. John sighs and starts again
Memories flickered across his mind’s eye of all the vulnerable moments they’d shared in recent weeks; the night Sherlock had been drugged, the alley where the detective had pinned him and then had his first panic attack, the second panic attack, so much worse and yet even more intimate, then this evening where he'd basically cuddled the man to sleep.
Sherlock pushes off the desk to stand at his full height. “No? You would just prefer to erase the whole thing. Come to cover your tracks? Ease your conscience, perhaps? Afraid you’ve wasted your time. Think it through. Who would I tell, John? No close family. Haven’t any friends. No evidence. Who’s likely to even believe
He felt a familiar mixture of fondness and exasperation at the realization that, in all likelihood, Sherlock failed to see any difference between John being his emergency ‘shock blanket’ during a crisis and insisting his companion stop everything and cover him when he was apparently just in need of a casual kip. Of course these types of implied boundaries and appropriate social norms would not be common sense to Sherlock.
The undertones of expensive leather upholstery, sickly sweet woman's perfume and faint whiffs of Mycroft’s aftershave.
, John.” Sherlock barks rising to his feet;  his eyes are sharp and narrowed, his posture is straight and he is bristling. In spite of his bruised face, split lip and roughed up appearance he manages to look every bit as haughty and self-possessed as he was at all those crime scenes an eternity ago. The sirens are getting closer. John scrambles to his feet as well; squaring his shoulders to Sherlock and tightening his jaw.
John stands there in shock and confusion for a moment before he nervously ducks down to peer inside the car. There's a woman with long black hair and a white silk dress arranged in the back seat. She turns to look at him and tilts her head. She seems slightly familiar but John can't place her.
John is smiling at him. It's that dark, thrilled expression of facing impossible odds together. He licks his lips and his breathing is excited and eager. A bone-deep groan escapes Sherlock's chest as he squirms on the sheets. What he wouldn't let the soldier do to him if he just looked at him like that; with the intent and desire to conquer him.
“Then, let’s not waste anymore time waiting,” John says firmly and he leans forward, his hand wrapping around the back of Sherlock’s head as Justus's had as he took his last gasps that first time. Sherlock lets out a breath he’d been holding for centuries as their lips slide together and the world, at last, is as it
Irene.” Sherlock grits out as he makes a sweeping gesture to take in his book and Molly seated across the table, who is watching everything with wide eyes. He'd agreed to help her work on organic chemistry because she'd promised to filtch him a human liver from the university cadavers. Again, not exactly a friendship, but a mutually beneficial arrangement.
The reflection’s eyes widen in alarm before Sherlock can shove that thought into the mental waste bin. He clenches his jaw tight and fixes that repulsively transparent visage with an icy glare full of scorn.
“Say it." Sherlock’s low voice rumbles with careful annunciation. “Say exactly what you said at the crime scene, exactly how you said it.”
“Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson to see you, Sir.” She is stroking a finger over the side of her neck now while eyeing me in a clearly flirtatious way. That same tempting shade of crimson of her lips is on her nails and is a very appealing contrast against the milk chocolate brown of her skin. I feel my own smile warming, becoming less forced politeness and more acknowledgement of potential interest.
“You have no idea what the hell you’re doing, Sherlock.” John is starting to push against Sherlock, pry him off, and Sherlock can't allow it. He has no retort for John so he crushes his lips into John’s again to try to squash his objections. Though, admittedly, he is already missing the heat and slick pressure of John’s lips tangling with his own.
Sherlock tries to restrain the quiver pulsing through his body; fearful it will wake the man sleeping above him. His muscles feel tense and tired, his brain is overwhelmed, but he forces his mind to seek a logical analysis, to define the variables that lead to failure of this experiment.
"I'm his doctor." He turns his eyes back on Sherlock and fixes a stern gaze on him, willing the stubborn young man to listen to him. "And only a fool would ignore the advice of his doctor."
"Lost five mill in a single morning; made it all back a week later," Sebastian replies, turning towards me as he dries his hands. "Nerves of steel, Eddie had." I look up at Sherlock.
I dump the groceries onto the table, feeling too irritated to deal with putting them away, which will likely require more cleaning - who knows what lurks in those cupboards.
"He has recently suffered some injuries." John turns his eyes on Sherlock and deploys his own tone of confident authority. "He needs to avoid strenuous activities and ideally should be staying home and resting - monitored by a medical professional."
“Sorry,” John clears his throat and shifts to shove his phone in his coat pocket. His lips thin into a grimace at realising he’s just outed himself as inexperienced with this type of luxury. He runs a hand through his hair, slicking it back and then wipes his damp palms on his jeans. He's wet and rumpled and not at all suited for such a sophisticated place. He just hopes he’s not ruining the leather seats because he certainly can't afford to pay any damages. When he looks over again, she’s watching him; her dark brown eyes startlingly piercing and perceptive. She can't be much older than him but she's so perfectly polished and elegant that John feels young and crude in comparison. She's beautiful but there's a hardness to her, a sense of discipline and control to her every move and expression. That, along with the clearly suggestive undertone to her question, sets him on edge. He has no idea what he's gotten himself into by accepting her invitation for a ride but he definitely feels out of his depth.
Sherlock blinks, snapping his mouth closed and shaking himself out of his shock. He's not sure how long he'd been staring at John. Thankfully, John's eyes are steady on the suitcase. So, perhaps this momentary lapse went unnoticed. He turns to the case on the bed.
Sherlock hooks his leg around John’s ankle, sweeps his feet out from under him, and yanks hard on his own wrist when John moves to catch himself on the bed. John slips, losing his balance and releasing Sherlock. Sherlock turns and attacks and then they are wrestling, scrambling across the bed; limbs flying and tangling. They pant and grunt, and John curses, as they scrabble along the mattress, trying to get the upper hand.
He had suspected since the Best Man speech at the wedding that Sherlock felt something for him with an intensity beyond that of friendship. Sherlock had indicated it was
“You're so much and I just can't-” John's voice is full of devastation. Sherlock looks up and the door is closing. “I'm sorry. I should go. I'll just-”
so something must have been altered between the time of the incident and now. Something that has shifted the encounter’s significance.
“He is... fighting for me.” Billy looks over at the figure. “I think… maybe, I should try... try to fight.”
This place; the bedsit, the emotional devastation, it is all so uncomfortably familiar. This is the inescapable cycle of his life. The wheel makes another turn back to those days before he met Sherlock or those days when he thought Sherlock was dead.
“Yeah, I mean… I could give it a look.” I reach out a hand, palm up, eyes fixed on the file rather than him. “Not exactly my area but can try.” The silence holds a moment and I finally look up at his face. My hand is still awkwardly extended into the space between us.
John sits down again with a thump that gives the impression it was not quite voluntary. “No… but… that’s
he hears in John's awed whisper. He subtly pushes his body into the door to put additional space between him and John. The cabin is closing in. He grits his teeth and forces himself to respond.
... my plan,” Sherlock says slowly, forcefully, as if he's trying to will John to understand that there's more meaning behind those simple words. All Sherlock's disparaging remarks about the fallacy of emotion and sentiment come back to John. He watches the silent struggle as Sherlock allows his own despised emotions surface and his typically unreadable face becomes a myriad of emotions.
D.I. Hopkins barely recognises the gaunt man before of her; hunched up, hands resting on the interview table in front of him. He most certainly does not appear to be worthy Lestrade’s assertion,
The entire day - the whole week - maybe his whole life. A series of unfortunate miscalculations that all accumulated to conspire against him in this very moment.
John is leaning into him. Lying on the bed, Sherlock strips himself of clothes as, in his mind, John runs his hands slowly and smoothly over his chest, down his flanks and to his hips. His eyes are thoughtful and reverent as he looks up at Sherlock. Sherlock rubs his own hands down his chest and sides as John had. It sets off a rolling wave of heat and throbbing inside him.
"Mydriasis; dilation of your pupils. It occurs when the smooth cells of the radial muscle, controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, contract. Light conditions have remained constant. No discernable source of adrenaline. That leaves intense interest in the subject - in this case,
“John?” His voice is thick with anguish and determination. He tries to push himself up onto his feet. The room could have been an ice skating rink for as much difficulty as he is having getting his feet under himself.
Sherlock heaves a sigh. He hesitates for a moment, then draws himself up straight, all his muscles tensed. His heart is pounding and his respiration is not within normal parameters, but he clings to the knowledge that there is simply nowhere that he truly feels a sense of complete acceptance, joy, peace and belonging except those moments when John is pressed to him and the rest of the world falls away. If he wants
"Right." With a nod I step forward and slide into the seat across from Mycroft. To my surprise, Artemis doesn't follow. She shuts the door behind me and I see her through the window leaning casually against the fence as we pull away. She's sucking on her lolli and looks just the way I'd found her, as if she's waiting to spring her next trap.
“Sherlock.” It is an inhaled breath; a gasp like a blow has landed to John's chest, and it pulls all the air out of the room. A pained expression washes away John's sternness. His eyes flick down to Sherlock's neck then up to meet his stare and, even though his pupils are dilated, consuming the dark blue of his iris, his expression has softened.
“You're death,” Henry gasps, sliding back towards the door. Fear still prickles at him, though it is dulled by a remoteness; as if everything that is happening is a step removed, and muted by a soft peace flowing through him.
Captain Watson glances around, getting his bearings. It is clean and brightly lit in a way that is jarring to those used to the grit and hodge-podge, make-do accommodations of medical care on the front lines.
Sherlock refuses to look over once he hears John catch up. The sound of breath and heavier footsteps, and the solid heat that occasionally brushes too close is merely an irritating distraction. He immediately sweeps away the sense that the world has tilted ever so slightly off its axis at having that strong, steady presence beside him.
Desperate to shut John up, Sherlock crashes his lips into John’s. It is nothing like a kiss and everything like their battle so far, messy and a bit violent, with both of them clashing as they work at cross-purposes.
Sherlock can't hear anything over the roar of blood in his ears. Eyes, like daggers, pin John in place as the practised mask of neutrality hides the roiling and seething inferno beneath his surface. He is the whole bloody thesaurus of words related to ire; every shade and variant of frustration and wrath contained within the burning flesh of his hedonistic and craven body. A potent mixture of desire and rage burns through him and it is an even draw on which will prevail.
It’s not a point system, Sherlock.” Her hands are gesturing in the air now, her hair bouncing with the vigor of her exasperation. “You don’t keep
“Fucking amazing,” I mutter, throwing the file down on the stack of papers on the table. It does him no favours to have refused to reveal the truth of this case to Mycroft. He is giving the British government, who might be the only ones capable of lending him some protection in the coming fight with his big target, the proverbial finger (rejecting whatever rewards and bearing any consequences of failing to cooperate with them).
Statistically speaking, it’s one of the primary motivators for crime. There’s money at the heart of this. Follow the money and we’ll find our killer.”
- well, it doesn't take much for him to feel the compulsion to rearrange the expressions of awe and respect off their faces. It makes him sick and unaccountably angry that they think that there is anything worthy of
