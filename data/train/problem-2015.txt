Sherlock's footsteps echo loudly in the silent corridors leading down to Bart's morgue. There's not a soul about, and isn't that quite a pun in a place like this, Sherlock thinks and smiles to himself as he pushes through yet another fire door. He's actually a bit excited what Molly might have found. Finally a useful trace, linking this crime with Moriarty?
“Sherlock, this is for your own good.” John starts to explain, sounding all reasonable and doctorly. “After I saw your non-compliance this morning, your brother and I decided that we had to employ other methods to make you eat. You need nutrition. Your persistent refusal won't get you anywhere.”
Sherlock swallows but does as he's told. As he lies on his back, John puts each of his arms in one of the designated internal sleeves before pulling up the first zipper, careful as not to trap Sherlock's raging erection in its teeth. The bag closes around Sherlock lower half, hugging him tightly, making any leg movements impossible. Next, the bag is fastened with a strap around his neck, and a second zipper is pulled down from there to meet the first one above his groin. There, John connects and locks both zippers with a small padlock.
After stepping out of his snug grey boxer briefs Sherlock sinks back down on his knees and waits. Miss Adler's gaze travels down his body to linger at his crotch, eyeing his flaccid cock with an amused expression.
Suddenly, the contact is gone again. Sherlock hears a blister packet getting torn. Why is John using a condom? They never use condoms.
“On your knees, slut.” John breaths, and Sherlock sinks down in one fluid motion, kneeling before John, still fisting his cock. John takes his chin between thumb and forefinger and pushes his face up. “Look at me.”
He hands it to Sherlock, grinning. “You need to stay hydrated. Come on, fill that up.” John demands.
Only, nothing of those had prepared him for what is about to happen. As the bells stop ringing, just after six o'clock, a shadow falls over his table. John had been fiddling with the burner phone, anticipating maybe another message, chasing him across town, but it had stayed quiet since last night. He only glances sideways as the chair next to him is pulled out from under the table and a woman sits down, wearing a long floral dress combined with a rather ridiculous I Love Amsterdam cap under which short ginger curls protrude.
Sherlock has no words to reply to that. He just pulls the soiled, wet sheets around himself and crawls off the bed, crouching at John's feet.
Eventually, he unties Sherlock and removes the vibrator before they both take a much needed shower, Sherlock kneeling on the tiles as John washes come out of his hair.
John can now bend Sherlock over anytime, anywhere and just push inside him. Not just with his cock, but with his hands as well. Once he even uses his foot.
“Maybe. I have to go out. Meet some people. Call in some favours.” Sherlock is up and already half-way down the corridor to his bedroom when John's voice stops him in his tracks.
On the other hand, who was he kidding? He was only able to sleep with the aid of pharmaceutics and drink, otherwise, sooner or later, he'd come again face to face with Sherlock's lifeless eyes and a pool of his own dark-red blood. He was unable to work, and couldn't distract himself otherwise. The worst were people trying to help him by stopping by or calling, offering to talk to him about IT.
“Please, John, it's been so long. I've been so good, please...” Sherlock is outright begging, sounding as needy as he feels.
John kneels between his spread legs as his free hand drags down Sherlock's body, over wet cotton and skin damp with piss, sweat and saliva. Sherlock's hips jerk upwards to meet him, but John just swats the inside of Sherlock's trembling thigh as his hand descends between those lovely pale cheeks and touches the base of the plug. He turns it left and right and Sherlock moans unabashed, nearly gone with lust.
“Seriously.” John replies, and Sherlock obediently opens his mouth. Sally feels her cunt heat and her nipples peak as she steps up to Sherlock, giving him a good long look at her wiry pubic hair, still glistening with her juices and Kate's saliva. Sally spreads her legs slightly, and Sherlock slowly leans forward. His tongue darts out to taste her, the tip just touching her still swollen clit, before he places his mouth over her vulva, coaxing her open with his tongue. She tastes warm and sweet, until suddenly salty piss floods Sherlock's mouth. He seals her with his plush lips while he keeps on sucking, drinking eagerly, swallowing as best he can, and is rather proud of himself that he spills very little. Sally holds his head in place with a hand in his hair, making sure he doesn't pull away. Not that he wants to.
To his surprise, John bows down and kisses him, softy and almost chaste, mouth closed. The gesture is so very tender that a shiver runs through Sherlock's body.
This time Sherlock is able to calm himself as John grabs his wrist and pulls his hand away from his cock. John is kneeling between his spread thighs and gently removes the gag while brushing his damp hair from his forehead. Sherlock is so grateful he wants to melt against John's body and curl up there until the ache passes. And John pulls him close and strokes his hair for a few minutes and Sherlock just breathes and sobs as he sinks even deeper into subspace.
“Have you ever done anything like this, Sherlock?” John asks very gently and removes his thumb to stroke a wet stripe over Sherlock's cheek bone. Sherlock wants to turn away but John grabs his chin and forces him to meet his eyes. “Tell me. Have you?”
Sherlock is lying in bed the next morning, aching, lingering. John is still curled up beside him, fast asleep, but Sherlock has been awake for almost half an hour now, watching the sun rise – or rather, their room getting brighter as the light permeates the curtains, for he can't see the sky from where he's resting beneath the crumpled sheets.
“Y-yes.” It's strange to speak like this, with a tube up your nose and down your throat, yet it is possible.
Sherlock's whole body undulates and he moans loudly, both in anticipation and frustration. He'd been so close...
“Sherlock...,” John frowns down on him before gathering him up in his arms. It helps a little, being held like that, and the shaking subsides. Yet, John is worried. “I'll be right back, I promise. Lie down, breathe, I'm just going over to my room.”
After a while, Sherlock's head tips back, looking up at John from dazed eyes. His legs still feel like jelly. His cock is swollen inside the chastity device; everything aches: his groin, his arse, his shoulders, his abdomen, his head. He concentrates on his breathing as he tries to focus, embracing John and the exhaustion. Sherlock Holmes fucked into oblivion is a sight to behold
Sherlock hadn't been able to get off for the whole two weeks of their separation. By now, he must be gagging for it.
Sherlock seems very drowsy from the medication and probably from the shock of John operating at those most intimate parts. His eyes keep falling shut. John tenderly strokes his curls and assures him that everything will be alright as Sherlock drifts off into an exhausted slumber.
Sherlock wants to protest, he wants to cry, he wants to correct John; it wasn't his fault. He really wanted to eat this morning. But it had been too much, administered too fast for him to cope.
“John, I have an appointment. It's important.” Sherlock tries to slide past but John grabs his upper arm.
Afterwards, he even gets more of an eyeful as Sherlock sheds the rest of his dirty attire and stuffs it into a bin bag before strutting gloriously naked over to their bathroom to take a shower.
John stays inside Sherlock just a little while longer, relishing the sweaty body writhing in agony beneath him. Eventually his soft cock slips free but Sherlock is too far gone to notice. He simply slides off the table and rolls onto his side on the floor, biting down on his gag while his arms can do nothing to support him as they are still tied behind his back. It's a sight to behold. Nevertheless, John removes the towel before Sherlock starts to black out from lack of oxygen. That's for another session.
The feeling of John's lips pressed tenderly against his marred mouth lingers while the agony spreads through Sherlock's body. He tries not to move, but his muscles start to cramp again after a while. Yet, flexing them makes the thorns scrape his skin. Shifting his body even slightly results in more damage. To distract himself, Sherlock closes his eyes and tries to imagine what John would do with him upon his return. From time to time, he takes a look in the mirror, to reassure himself that he still exists.
Sherlock is both mortified and aroused, tied down to his chair, sitting in full view of the slightly open living room door with his leaking cock jutting out of his trousers – on display for anyone to see who should walk into the room.
The next chapters will get a bit more plotty, just so you have been warned. I also don't speak Belarusian, this is just what google translator provided, so I'm sorry for any mistakes.
“It's for fisting.” Sherlock murmurs, fascinated, turning the toy in his hands, peering through it before trying to insert his hand.
Sherlock can't move, not with the heavy bucket still attached to his sore nipples. Of course, he doesn't think about removing it. It's like a ball and chain, tying him down. He'll wait until John releases him. If he releases him. While John tales a shower, Sherlock licks come and spit off the floor to keep John's taste fresh in his mouth.
John stares down, licking his lips. “I'm going to fuck your slit now. Nice and slow.” He announces, taking the needle between thumb and forefinger as he slowly pulls it almost all the way out of Sherlock's cock. Before inserting it, John had taken some SurgiLube from his kit to slick it up nicely. Sherlock had watched wide-eyed as the rod glided up his urethra. He'd been half hard by then. It hadn't felt unpleasant, just strange. John had gone very slowly, for which Sherlock had been grateful.
John fucks Sherlock twice more this day, always hard, deep and brutal. His hole is read and burning by the end of the day, and finally John allows him to come, watching while Sherlock fucks his own fist. The cloth pins are still in place, as is the glass plug, and John slaps Sherlock's face again and again, calling him a filthy whore and a needy slut, while Sherlock answers with “Yes, John, sorry, John”, begging for more. His cheeks burn and show bright red marks; he even bit his lip. He shudders when John eventually removes the cloth pins and finally comes as sharp pain shoots up his spine. The nipple clamps stay in place.
John tweaks him again, harder this time, and Sherlock makes a pained, keening noise betraying his suffering, but otherwise stays in position. The piss filling his bowels is rapidly cooling but he doesn't dare to emit it; because John would punish him for it. Ruthlessly. And he's not sure he can take that right now.
Sherlock bows down again to do as he's told. The angle is awkward and his neck starts to hurt immediately but he obligingly takes John's sack into his mouth and starts to lick them, rolling them over his tongue. His saliva starts to mix with the spit dripping from Kate's mouth.
Sherlock slumps to the floor, curling up on himself as Moriarty opens the handcuffs around his wrists, not waiting for his ankles to be untied. He shuffles back on his bare arse, as far away from the stretcher as possible while still being chained to it. What little saliva is left in his mouth he spits on the tiles, frantically trying to remove the vile taste of death from his tongue. He's not sure if it will ever go away.
“Well, come on then, smear your fingers through my come and lick them clean.” John relents, and Sherlock sets eagerly to work. Meanwhile, John sinks back down onto the mattress and takes Sherlock's leaking cock in his left hand. It's hot and heavy, thick and rock hard. Sherlock's eyes literally role back in his head as he pushes into the touch.
“Are you thirsty?” When Sherlock turns his sweaty face sideways, John fishes one ice cube from the glass and presses it against Sherlock's swollen lips. John made him suck his cock for hours this morning and it still shows. Now, Sherlock sucks again, greedy, his pink tongue swirling around the frozen splinter to wet his enticing lips.
It’s not easy. Sherlock has to twist his body, looking over his shoulder in the mirror to observe what he’s doing. He’s holding onto the bed post with his left hand as not to topple over, up on his knees. The glove is by now coated in lube, and Sherlock has almost succeeded to press his hand fully inside his open, abused hole. The rim stretches around his knuckles, burning, bright red now, sore. Sherlock almost dislocates his shoulder as he pushes deeper still, forcing his fist past the ring of muscle, enduring, aching.
He knows he's starting to dissociate. There's only so much pain one can take. After a while, the agony becomes rather boring in its repetition, especially to a drugged brain. He wishes the cycle would break, though. He wants this to be over, and therefore allows himself to sink deeper and deeper into unconsciousness to await the end of his ordeal. It works. He zones out.
“Well, it'll be only anal for you for the next weeks. Doctor Watson, I'm sure you know where Miss Adler keeps her first aid kit.”
There's an attendant standing by the front door, wearing silky Indian pantaloons riding low on his slim hips, an earpiece, and nothing else. His tanned, well-muscled torso glistens with oil. He indicates for John and Sherlock to step into the hall and change in a room to their left.
“You need to eat.” John pokes him in his all too visible ribs. “Something substantial. Eggs. Bacon. Do we have anything in?”
“Thank you.” Sherlock sighs again, pushing up against the plug. He can feel the muscles in his arms and legs shaking and almost cramping from the effort to hold still during this ordeal.
“Um, ok, want me to come with you?” When Sherlock just storms down the stairs, John decides he might as well follow.
John continues to play with Sherlock and his toys. They spend an amicable afternoon on the sofa. Afterwards, Sherlock is due for his first punishment.
Sherlock's brain kicks into gear. “Who's been murdered?” He sits up as well, winces a little at the abrupt movement and snatches the paper from John.
“Not much.” He takes a step forward and the sound moves inside him. Sherlock can't suppress a moan. “Oh god... it's... painful... upsetting. Wow... it's truly shocking.”
There's a case the next day and during the following 36 hours Sherlock and John run around London, inspect dark alleyways and search even darker dwellings before cornering the young but fierce leader of an all female money laundering ring in a chip shop in Hackney. Sherlock knocks her out with a frying pan as she tries to slice up John with a butcher's knife and that somehow seems to restore some kind of truce between them. In the cab home Sherlock looks intensely at John who stares out of the window and doesn't turn, not even when Sherlock whispers “Doomsday.”
“God, you're unbelievable. So amazing. I want to keep you like this.” John murmurs against Sherlock's sweaty temple before brushing a feather-light kiss there. Sherlock moans, raw and needy.
Sherlock tries to speak, to beg, but can't because his mouth is stuffed with cotton. John doesn't let go of him but continues to touch him until Sherlock stops thrashing as the agony paralyses him. He still screams into his gag, his eyes almost popping out of their sockets in his reddened face.
Until he'd vanished. That had been the moment Mycroft's suspicions had been truly raised for the first time. Now he knew something was fishy.
“So,” John eventually finds the strength to speak again. “I think it's time for your first corrective punishment.”
“God, you really get off on this, don't you?” He asks Sherlock, who opens his eyes and nods. His gaze is glazed over, his mouth hanging open in a silent moan.
Slowly, John pushes the thin tube up his penis. He has lubed it up, so it slides in fairly easy. But it still hurts. Ss it enters Sherlock's bladder, it feels very strange. Now he won't be able to control this bodily function. For as long as he can remember, he had his excretion under control. Not anymore.
He's glad that he hadn't seen the full extent of Sherlock's injuries back at the manor in Sussex, otherwise he might have caused a major diplomatic incident by putting a whole in at least one head.
“Yes, John.” Sherlock breathes, his head dropping back against the door, going pliant under John's onslaught.
“Precisely. Driven to suicide by the defamatory slander of the tabloids. Neat, don't you think?” Sherlock sounds rather proud of himself. John sighs, resting his chin on top of Sherlock’s red curls. “Oh, sorry. You weren't supposed to be there.” Sherlock interlaces their fingers and squeezes reassuringly.
Sherlock wants to give an acrid retort, but only now senses that he can't open his mouth. It's sealed with something – adhesive tape? A bandage? Leucoplast? Whatever it is, it ensures that just a muffled sound escapes his throat.
Chequered fucks him so hard that Sherlock's head hits the radiator and he starts to see black spots dancing in front of his eyes. His voice by now is raw with screaming, as he begs the man to use him, to give it to him, to hurt him, to fill him. When suddenly the man inside him stills and pulses, Sherlock can feel it and gasps both in bliss and disappointment that it's over.
“Oh, god, brother mine, if you could see me now. I came all over my fingers. I'd allow you to suck me clean if you where here. It's rather a lot, I might have ruined my morning suit.”
Sherlock listens to John's breathing evening out, a sign that he's falling asleep. Yet Sherlock knows that John's a light sleeper, due to his army training, and will probably wake numerous times during the night anyway to check on him. No need to worry.
At thirty, Sherlock’s back is glistening with sweat. His bollocks hang heavy between his slightly parted, shaking legs. A few welts have cracked open, exposing raw flesh. Small rivulets of blood trickle down the back of his legs.
And Sherlock looks up at John, sucking on his drenched panties, his face streaked with tears, yet smiling.
The small house is spotless yet cosy and smells of freshly brewed coffee. Thankfully, Murray doesn't ask why Sherlock is just covered in a blanket and looks more dead than alive. He just shows them the bathroom that's so clean John could probably perform a heart transplant in it. After gratefully accepting a mug of coffee for himself and some water for Sherlock, John sets to work.
“I want you to come just from this.” John murmurs softly yet still demandingly into Sherlock's ear as he relentlessly rubs his prostate, milking Sherlock. And, rather surprising to himself, after some time Sherlock looses himself in the sensation and starts to rut against the table, seeking at least minimal friction. At this John intensifies his administration until suddenly Sherlock's hips buck and he shoots thick stripes of semen into the jar John is holding beneath him.
The next morning Sherlock is sitting in his chair opposite John, wearing slim black dress trousers and a tight black shirt. It's so thin that his rips are slightly visible through the soft cotton. Sherlock let's his legs fall open invitingly while he sips his tea but John merely glances over at him. Only when Sherlock rolls up his sleeves and tucks his violin under his chin to tune his instrument does John's eyes flicker over him. He even absent-mindedly licks his lips as Sherlock raises the bow. Sherlock smiles to himself as he gets up and turns towards the window to play some Bach.
Sherlock wants to protest. No! No cage. Not with Mycroft being the master of the keys. It might be ages before he'll be released from it.
Greg just grins even more wickedly as he removes his fingers. “By the way, I like it that you don't overuse lube.” He says while pulling his belt out of its loops.
John can't believe he's heard right. Up until a few minutes ago, he'd not even been sure if Sherlock actually had some sort of sex drive. Now, Sherlock is already offering to indulge in one of his most deviant fantasies. It feels like they've just omitted the 'tentatively getting to know each other intimately' part of a blossoming relationship and went from having a drink on their first date to full on carnal indulgence. But as this is Sherlock Holmes – should this really surprise John? Besides, they were already living together, sharing their daily life and routines... John's suddenly quite sure that skipping the usually complicated relationship negotiations is actually a brilliant idea.
“Take it. Take all of it.” John groans as his fingers dig into Sherlock's hips, keeping him firmly in place. Sherlock's eyes roll back in his head and he's sure he'll pass out any minute. Still, he spreads his legs even wider and arches his hips up a bit to change the angle. He desperately wants to be fucked by John, despite the pain. He needs this, they both do. When he feels John suddenly tense, then swell and pulse inside him Sherlock is riding on a wave of bliss. He did that to John, for John, and it's breathtaking and wonderful and absolutely transcending. Sherlock triumphantly sobs with joy and smiles through his tears.
As Sherlock can't drink by mouth at the moment, John has to administer fluids by IV. For this procedure, Sherlock is told to lie on his bed and not to move as John inserts the cannula into the back of his right hand. Sherlock, lying motionless, with a drip up his arm, dried come covering his body, is strangely erotic. John takes his time to watch as the saline slowly drips into Sherlock's vein.
John has had time to cool down a little. He's reached a conclusion. “I accept your apology. But this plan stops here. You keeping secrets from me stops here. We are in this together. I can't have you doing drugs. It's my duty to protect you, and I will protect you, Sherlock, even from yourself.”
Therefore, he'd refrained from putting anything big up Sherlock's arse after stitching him up back in Berlin, allowing his used hole to heal and shrink back into the tight ring of pink muscle it used to be. Now, even the small vibrator buzzing inside Sherlock is driving him insane, rubbing constantly against his prostate. He's unable to do anything about it, because John has his hands cuffed, attached with a short metal chain to the headboard behind him.
“You like that, don't you? Being tied down and beaten into submission?” John growls in a dangerously low voice.
“Take it.” John growls, standing up to move even closer, slapping Sherlock in the face with his hard, leaking cock, smearing glistening precome onto his cheeks. But when Sherlock tries to catch John's cockhead with his mouth, John tuts and yanks his head back by his still sleep-mussed curls.
The walk back to their hotel takes almost an hour. Sherlock has to go slow, and still the burdocks chafe and scratch his penis, balls and even slide back between his cheeks. It's agonising. He moves with a rolling gait like a sailor, but event hat doesn't bring him much relieve. He's almost in tears when they arrive at their Pensione, his face reddened, his shirt sweaty and clinging to his back.
“Why not start with some snogging? Nice and slow – with tongue.” Moriarty hisses in Sherlock's ear as he squishes Sherlock's mouth somewhere in the vicinity of slightly parted unresponsive lips, already turning blue.
He wants this shadow gone from their lives forever. They are together now, that's all that matters. Sherlock will heal.
“I seriously advise you not to take too long to make your mind up. I'm not a very patient man.” Rossi's voice brings Sherlock back to reality.
Thankfully, John had also found some pruners with which he now quickly cuts the branches wrapped around Sherlock's head and legs. There surely are some scratches on his face, and his legs hurt rather badly, but right now, the endorphins flooding his bloodstream give Sherlock a natural high, suppressing the pain.
Over the next few days the atmosphere in the flat is thick with frustration as they both try to avoid each other as best as they can; but there's only so much chance to do so when you share a kitchen and a bathroom. Sherlock is nervous and irritable while John seems tired and grumpy. There are too many petty remarks and snappy replies and even Mrs Hudson bringing up some scones on Saturday afternoon doesn't help to ease the tension.
“Down to Sussex for the weekend. But before, John and I have arranged a little surprise for you.” They both smirk at him. Mycroft knows very well how Sherlock loves surprises. And this one will be something quite special indeed.
“I thought I was losing you.” John whispers. “And I won't allow that. I don’t want a complaisant fuckdoll. I want
After that, John had manhandled Sherlock up to his room. All the stuff they needed was up there, and it was as far away from Mrs Hudson as possible. John had made Sherlock lie on the bed on his back before tying his hands to the headboard. When he'd finished, he'd folded Sherlock in half, bringing his spread legs up until his ankles were next to his ears. John had tied them to the headboard as well before wrapping rope around Sherlock's calves and forearms, binding them together. Sherlock had felt utterly exposed and was totally unable to move. In addition, it was very uncomfortable.
Sherlock can watch the minutes tick by, there's a clock on the wall to his left. It's no help. If all, it makes his ordeal even worse, knowing how long he'll still have to suffer.
But Sherlock only shakes his head. He flinches when John starts to wipe at his chest, but relaxes a bit when John continues to mumble soothing words into his hair: “It's ok, we just get you cleaned up a little. Sorry, I know, it's cold...” John's hand moves further down Sherlock's belly and the man suddenly jerks back, but John holds onto him, tight. “Molly, can you go and get some water, please.” He asks over his shoulder, hoping that Molly will get the hint.
“We are out of coffee. And Milk. And almost everything else!” John shouts over into the bedroom from which only emanates a long-suffering sigh in return.
Because he's gaping. His anus is wide open, the rim only slightly wrinkled, a bit red but otherwise looking delectable. Fuckable. And he stays open. His knees are slightly spread, and his arsehole is on full display. Vulnerable. Ready. Some of the excessively applied lube is dripping out of him, running down over his perineum, his balls and inner thighs, and it's deliciously debauched. Sherlock cants his arse upwards a bit more and presents himself, in awe of what his body can be transformed into. A soft moan escapes his mouth.
“Wait here.” John breaths against Sherlock's mouth, and then he's gone, taking his assuring warmth with him. Sherlock feels temporarily thrown off balance but it only takes a few moments for John to return from the kitchen, carrying a role of black gaffer tape from one of their drawers.
Still, he complains again when told to ride a 10 inch dildo, glued via a suction cup onto the coffee table. Sherlock has to squat over it and whines as he slowly sinks down. John makes him bop up and down on it all morning, until he's sore and almost screaming with oversensitivity. His prostate feels positively chafed. Meanwhile, John sits in the kitchen, drinks coffee and reads his paper, but every time Sherlock starts to slow down, he walks over and swats him hard with the rolled-up Independent. By midday, Sherlock is drenched in sweat and his thigh muscles are burning as he begs John to be released, because it's too much, too big. Eventually, John has enough and hits him so hard that he bites his lip. After that, Sherlock's quiet, swallowing his whimpers as John makes him fuck himself on the monster cock for yet another half hour.
It takes a few minutes for John's red hot anger to simmer down to a darkly determined ire. But eventually he releases Sherlock's hair and shoves him away as if repelled by the broken figure at his feet. “Stay like this. I get everything ready.”
“Well, I know people working for the BBC. We went to school together, they owed me a favour. Long story. The gun wasn't yours, it was a prop. I used blanks and had a small pad filled with artificial blood as used on TV hidden beneath my hair at the back of my head. When I shot myself,” Sherlock has to disentangle their hands to make air quotes with his long fingers, “I fell backwards, the pad ruptured, and it looked like blood oozing from my head. I hoped Magnussen would be too shocked to look at me thoroughly. You arriving at the scene complicated matters a little. But I had people from my homeless network on stand-by, to intervene quickly. They posed as ambulance staff and carted me away.”
The hand is gone a second later as Toby just shrugs and pretends to busy himself with mixing the ink and adjusting the needle. Suddenly, he asks: “You agree to that, don't you?”
On a nearby window sill, two men flank a third one, taking turns kissing him open-mouthed while fisting his cock. Suddenly, a fourth man joins in, grabbing the guy in the middle by his hair to pull him in, biting his lower lip. The noise of wet kisses and flesh pumping sweaty flesh fills Sherlock's ears.
Sherlock blanches. His jaw drops, but no sound comes out of his mouth. He has to grab the sink tighter as to not bolt from the room.
Sherlock blushes a bright crimson as two servants enter the room, carrying tablets with pots, cups and plates, accompanied by an assortment of scones, clotted cream, jam and honey and a silver etagere laden with cream tarts and eclairs. He's highly aware of his dishevelled appearance, his plugged arse and the nipple clamps, but Mycroft has his employees trained well. They barely glance at the naked man on the floor who drips precome onto the hearth rug.
Sherlock is too frail to stand. John grabs him under his arms as his sated body slides off the rack after Mycroft had loosened the straps. Both men support Sherlock as they carefully manoeuvre him over to Mycroft's large four-poster double bed. It's already covered with clean towels. They place Sherlock on them face down. His back is too raw to lie on it. He won't be able to sit properly either for a few days.
“Hold onto the head board.” John orders. As Sherlock raises his trembling arms, blood spatters onto the already soiled duvet.
Sherlock's blissful misery is heightened by John's fingers playing with his hole, stroking it, circling it, teasing it but never pushing inside, not even a little bit. Sherlock relaxes and flutters his sphincter, trying to coax John inside, at least a fingertip, but such slutty behaviour just earns him a swat on the buttocks before John turns the vibrator onto its highest setting, making Sherlock almost sob with need and desperation.
“Yes...” Sherlock huffs, his voice hoarse with lust. He clenches and unclenches his fists at his side as Mycroft continues to caress him, flicking his index finger against his swollen pebbles. The pain soars through Sherlock's body like a bolt of white, hot heat, making him leak between his legs. He wished John had put a cock ring on him because he fears he might just come from this.
“Five minutes.” Mycroft grants, before he stalks down the corridor in the direction of the foyer., twirling his ever present umbrella
It takes a few moments for Sherlock to be able to push himself up into a sitting position on the slippery floor. John – who's still wearing the gloves – unties him quickly and rubs his arms to start circulation again.
John looks up over his computer, taking in Sherlock glistening, twisted body, his balls dark purple, his face contorted in discomfort. The frown spreading on his face is not even angry, just disappointed. He slams the laptop shut and gets up.
Sherlock's bruises have faded over the past few days. As John spreads his cheeks a little, he's satisfied to see that his rectum has fully healed as well. Some rather tempting ideas start to play out in his mind.
Sherlock shrugs. “She despises me anyway. I've got nothing to loose here. You, on the other hand, always were her favourite. Imagine how she would react if I showed her my tattoo.”
Sherlock’s own cock is painfully hard in his neoprene confine while his rim contracts around the fat plug splitting him open. Every movement of his pelvis causes him pain. His lower abdomen is almost entirely filled with the hard rubber cylinder, straining his bowels almost past endurance. To add to his discomfort, John had put a cock ring on him earlier, so he’s unable to come. John hadn’t allowed him to for the previous three days either. His balls feel like bursting, especially with this enthusiastic stranger on top of him, riding him, fucking himself into oblivion, panting, moaning...
“I'll get you another one. A better one.” Suddenly, Sherlock scrambles stiffly to his feet, his face distorting in pain as he moves.
“Come on, get up.” Sherlock's legs shake as John guides him onto the sofa. Sherlock sinks back against the cushions as he hands John the slippery toy he's been sucking for the past quarter of an hour. Then he pulls his legs up to his chest by grabbing them from behind his knees, spreading himself open right in front of John.
Mycroft runs his hand tenderly over the dark oak. “I had to pull some strings to obtain this from Wandsworth prison.” He smiles, then gestures for Sherlock to step closer.
“I told you, not yet. “John admonishes him, pulling off the soiled kitchen gloves. “Offer me something else, Sherlock. An incentive. Something special. I can get a blow job anywhere. What I want from you is to watch you debase yourself for me.”
“I bet you are. You were amazing, little brother. Breathtakingly beautiful. John did prepare you well.” Sherlock just murmurs something vaguely affirmative in response. He's bone tired, his head pounds, yet he's floating on oxytocin and endorphins. Sated. Content. Satisfied. All he really wants is to curl up and rest.
“I'll give you a short break now. Breath, Sherlock. This is all your fault, and you know that. I have to punish you when you don't obey me.” John gives Sherlock's abused cock a short hard squeeze before gently rolling his balls in his right palm, his middle finger dipping low between Sherlock's spread cheeks, tenderly massaging Sherlock's hole
Sorry, no porn, just plot, drama and feels. But this is needed at this point of the story, so please kindly bear with me.
Watching Sherlock like this – tied up, fucked out, moaning and trembling – is a feast John can't live without anymore. He'll do everything to keep him like this – debauched, spoiled, corrupted by the needs of his body.
But then Acri snaps his fingers again. Sherlock opens his eyes and sees the boy who's been riding the other man and swallowing come all evening walk up to them. As he kneels onto the bed as well, Acri strokes and squeezes his rounded belly a bit before whispering something in his ear. The boy grins, nods and scoots over to Sherlock.
The slave grunts again. Sherlock swallows. His mouth has suddenly gone dry. He wonders if somewhere along the way the boy has lost his ability to speak. Sherlock knows that after some time in an intense relationship like this, it can be hard to surface from subspace. He remembers all too well his time at his family mansion, being trained for Mycroft. He's lost something back then and is still not sure if he'll be able recover from it. Looking back, it frightens him  how far he's prepared to go; or what he would allow John to do to him.
John strokes himself slowly from root to tip, pulling back the foreskin with every tug, exposing his wet slit, and says. “Take the other jar.” Sherlock grabs the second jar without hesitation. “Prepare yourself for me.”
Under John's persistent touch, Sherlock's abdominal muscles tense and flex, setting the pins below his belly button wiggling. His erect cock twitches, and a drop of precome drips from the tip of the knitting needle protruding from his urethra.
He steadies Sherlock’s head with one hand clumsily pushed into his short, blond hair while the other stays on Sherlock's chest. As the tip of the dildo breaches him, he spreads his fingers as if anchoring himself. While slowly taking the toy deeper, Mark moves his hand to adjust the angle, his fingers sliding over Sherlock's ribcage until they come to rest at the base of his long throat just below his Adam’s apple, touching his skin above the neoprene. Sherlock has a prime view of the tight red pucker stretching around the black toy. Lube squelches as the muscle gives and the rubber shaft sinks deeper and deeper. It's beautiful.
Sherlock can't respond to this, for his mouth is filled with a double penis gag. He's biting down on the shorter, yet thick part that John pressed between his lips, making him suck on it before fastening the leather strap around his head.
“Hi! Is this Doctor John Watson?” A voice that sounds way too cheerful for the godforsaken hour greets John as he answers his phone.
Suddenly, there's a fist wrapped around his shaft. Sherlock throws back his head and howls into the rubber hood. He's so sensitive that the touch aches, yet so keyed up that he bucks into it nonetheless. Pain and pleasure intertwine in his brain, short-circuiting his nerve endings, crossing receptors. Signals mix until he feels like shattering into tiny pieces, his mind shredded by antagonistic impulses of YES – NO – PLEASE!!! - STOP – MORE.
John is aware that they won't be able to hide for long from Sherlock's brother and the Belarusian secret service. They have to make good use of what short lead they gained. As he's sure that the car is most likely equipped with a GPS transmitter, he has to get rid of it as soon as possible. They have to change mode of transport. Yet John is not a professional car thief. The man who actually can pick a lock and might even be able to short-circuit an ignition is currently knocked out next to him. Therefore, John is forced to think of an alternative.
Sherlock suddenly goes rigid, stepping away from the man. Magnussen continues, with a smirk on his otherwise stony face: “Oh, are you getting cold feet now? I thought you were doing rather nicely. Come back over here, let's proceed. What were you about to offer me?”
Sherlock does, sitting back on his arse, his arms supporting him behind his back. His mouth is stuffed with his own underwear as tears dry on his face. Despite the pain he's hard and leaking, his erection jutting out in front of him, red and swollen.
Sherlock doesn't get up. He stays on his knees in front of the fire, clears his throat and says: “I'm truly sorry, John. It won't happen again. I promise.”
“I’m not going to blackmail him. I’m going to offer him a deal he’ll better accept.” John states gravely.
John lets Sherlock sleep in his bed that night. He perfunctorily cleans the sheets, brushing off the residue of the wax play before getting undressed himself and climbing in next to Sherlock, who's warm spent body is a solid weight against John during the whole night.
“Not so fast.” John steps in. Sherlock stares at the bowl, unable to believe his luck. John wouldn't spoil the fun, would he?
“Yes, John.” Sherlock groans, getting more and more desperate. He can feel the pressure on his bladder increase like a dull throb building deep inside him.
Sherlock simply can't move. He can't breath. His diaphragm locks as a violent spasm shakes his whole body.
There's a picture of their host from last night, all properly dressed in tie and suit jacket, shaking hands with some politician, looking confident and successful. Below is a picture of the villa they'd been partying last night.
This earns Sherlock another enema, this time spiced with cayenne pepper and chili oil. He cries for hours afterwards, chained to the bed again, crouching on the hard floor, blindfolded and gagged. The rubber ball of the gag has been dipped in chili powder as well, and John had even rubbed it into Sherlock's eyes before tying a scarf around his head. His whole body burns as if on fire but John just watches him, amused.
The wounds are healed by now but make a beatiful pattern on Sherlock's back, red scars criss-crossing on pale, smooth skin. John strokes the marks tenderly with gloved fingers, telling Sherlock how awesome he looks.
John's tongue follows his fingertips down Sherlock's spine as he eventually rises to kneel behind him. The plug sits still snug inside Sherlock's hole, not giving way. John's fingernails scrape up the tender backs of Sherlock's thighs, and Sherlock shivers, gooseflesh breaking out all over. His hole tries to twitch in anticipation but it's impossible, as he's literally filled to the rim.
In another alcove between two large windows, a fair young man has been tied to one of the ornate  red and golden Louis Quince chairs with what seems like a thick velvety curtain tassel. His head is thrown back, exposing his long neck, and every muscle in his body seems strained as a tall man drips hot wax from one of the flickering candles all over his left thigh. The moan the blonde lets out borders on a scream, yet is so full of arousal that Sherlock doubts he's truly in pain. His agony is of a totally different kind.
John presses the palm of his left hand against his crotch. This is definitely the hottest thing he's ever seen in his whole life. He might be about to have a coronary – but sod it, if he's to go like this, it's totally worth it.
John's hand pins him down as he opens him, steadily turning the screw. Sherlock is sobbing uncontrollably by now, babbling incoherently, but John isn't deterred in the slightest. He only stops when Sherlock's anus is gaping wide open and he can see the pale rose coloured walls of his colon.
John forces Sherlock onto his knees on a soft white rug in the middle of the large living room, pressing his face into the fluffy carpet. Sherlock goes down willingly, his arse once again raised in the air, exposed, open. The silver chastity device gleams between his legs. God, he needs to be touched so badly!
John only presses his foot between Sherlock's legs from behind, squashing his already abused balls. “Rut.” He orders, and Sherlock does, biting down onto his lower lip to stifle the groans of pain that want to escape his mouth.
“Be as loud as you want. I like to hear you scream.” John brushes his knuckles over the reddened flesh and hears Sherlock inhale sharply.
Sherlock grunts in front of him, keening into the silk in his mouth while John cuts him in quick, precise succession until the hateful tattoo is marred with at least ten deep lacerations. Only when it's rendered illegible does John stop and leans back on his heels. After a moment, he pulls the soaked slip from Sherlock's mouth.
“We'll leave you to it, then.” Sherlock's father says as he scuttles off, pulling the door shut behind them. They are probably used to this kind of secrecy between their two sons.
“What was that? Did you just make an appointment with the man who's currently dragging you through the mud?” John can't quite believe what he just heard.
“I... I liked it.” Sherlock's throat is raw from sobbing, which gives his voice a convincingly husky tone. Moriarty gestures with his free hand and Sherlock gets the message and continues. “It was... good. Hot.”
Up in Mycroft’s apartment, the three of them make straight for the spacious bathroom. It’s fitted with a luxuriously walk-in shower inside a large glass cubicle but there’s also an old-fashioned claw-foot bathtub. A huge gilt-framed mirror hangs over the sink, catching their reflection as the scene unfolds.
Sherlock knows that the next drip will hit the man's left thigh before finally, finally his tormentor/lover will get to where he really wants him – between his legs, covering tight balls, his twitching cock and all those silky golden pubes with hot molten wax.
This is it. So it has begun. He briefly closes his eyes before striding back into the bedroom, where John is silently cursing at the screen.
Sherlock gazes at John, inquisitively but also very tired. After a moment, he sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger. “I can’t think right know. Just, don’t underestimate my brother. He didn’t get where he is now by playing by the rules.”
“Oh, Sherlock... do you give up just yet? All fight knocked out of you? Good. You might actually need your stamina for a more demanding tasks.”
At first, Sherlock seems overwhelmed by the variety. Mycroft keeps his gear neatly stored in drawers, cupboards and on hooks. Sherlock stares at them in a mixture of horror and awe. Some instruments seem to outright perplex and confuse him. It's an impressive collection, John has to admit.
“Remember, Sherlock, I know what you need.” John cards his finger through Sherlock's hair, cupping the back of his skull. “If we stop this now, we'll never get back to it. And you don't really want to stop this, do you?”
After the fifth stroke Sherlock's arms are split open from shoulder joint to elbow. His chest is heaving as he tries desperately to suck in air between his screams.
When he's finally done, John dabs Sherlock's now much tighter hole with antiseptic before placing another cool aid pack from the fridge over the fresh sutures. To cover the stitches, he puts a clean, soft towel between Sherlock's legs.
Sherlock tries to catch as much as possible and it occurs to John that Sherlock might in fact be really thirsty, so he slows down a bit to give Sherlock the chance to gulp down as much liquid as possible. Despite Sherlock's eagerness, urine starts to run over his chin, chest, belly and groin until Sherlock is dripping wet and drenched, just as John promised.
Sherlock's hands shake slightly as they close around the smooth glass but then he raises it to his mouth and starts gulping the pale yellow liquid down.
“Does it hurt?” John asks. Sherlock nods. “Good.” John smiles, stroking his knuckles up and down Sherlock's sides.
John has no idea if Sherlock cares for hands-on sex, real physical intimacy – somehow, they'd skipped that part of the conversation entirely – so he doesn't expect any participation. But his balls feel like exploding if he doesn't get off NOW – and as Sherlock is not the squeamish kind, John's rather sure that he won't mind John masturbating in front of him. He might actually enjoy it – even if it is for totally different reasons than John.
“Now, I get it you are peckish. Don't you like to be fed come like this? No?” She grabs his hair again and pulls so fiercely that Sherlock cries out in pain.
When he’s finished, he whispers John’s name against his palm, his lips warm, his breath hot and moist.
“My... my brother is fucking me.” Sherlock pants, staring somewhat hazy at the lens, his face contorting in a mixture of lust and distress. It's the hottest, most intimate thing John has ever seen. Sherlock is truly coming undone.
And John does, slamming into Sherlock's shivering body rough and fast, chasing just his own orgasm. Sherlock's half-hard cock hangs neglected between his legs as John is not bothering with him. Thankfully, John has at least used lube this time.
John tucks himself away before kneeling down onto the floor beside Sherlock's head, gazing intently down at him, stoking his thumb over his hot cheek. Sherlock’s jaw aches a little from biting down onto the toy, and John gently massages his face before grabbing the dildo gag again.
Sherlock doesn't want to do this as he crouches down between Kate's spread legs and tentatively darts out his tongue to give the moist flesh in front of him an experimental lick. It tastes different from John – tangy, slobbery, pungent. It's warm and soft and his tongue swipes over the glistening fold again and again. The woman moans, louder this time, and Sherlock becomes acutely aware that he's being watched by Irene and John. Not only watched, but that his performance is judged. He swirls his tongue experimentally and elicits another low moan from Kate.
“Collateral damage; a concept you should be familiar with.” Mycroft's tone is almost as acerbic as Sherlock's. John swallows, fists clenching, but he tries to stay calm.
“Does she make an effort?” John asks a little breathless as his cock hits the back of Sherlock's throat and the man below him splutters while fighting for air.
Sherlock's hand stills abruptly. He's panting, but isn't so foolish as to doubt John's words for one second.
Sherlock feels his tormented cock twitch in anticipation as John helps him up and into his coat before getting dressed himself and calling a cab.
“I'm sure you'll come up with something to prevent this. One of your clever plans.” John ruffles Sherlock's hair and Sherlock looks up at him, grinning smugly.
He would love a shower. He feels itchy, covered in dried sweat and semen. The latex sticks uncomfortably to his skin. His stomach hurts, his nipples pulse with a dull ache, his arse is sore, and he still doesn't know what his brother has written onto his body. Yet he tries to stay very still, sensing that they want him like this, pliant, an inanimate object, dehumanised.
“Kitchen.” Sherlock barks, almost jumping to his feet and swaying slightly as a result of the sudden movement combined with unusual heavy drinking. “Sorry. I'm a bit excited.” He smiles down at John as he steadies himself with one hand on the mantelpiece. This admission makes John relax a little.
“No, no, no, Sherlock! Look at me. Look what you are letting me do to you.” Moriarty traces Sherlock's upper lip, dipping into his Cupid's bow, smearing blood on his face like some gory make-up. “Does it feel like this when John touches you? Or is he firmer? Rougher? You like it rough, Sherlock?”
“If you throw up, I'll let you lick your own vomit off the floor. Now, take the glass and drink. All of it.”
So, after a while, John had abandoned the Tequila, made himself a coffee and had sat in his chair, thinking. When the sun had started to rise, he'd not even bothered to pack a bag, just showered, changed and left the flat. He'd walked along Marylebone and Euston Road until he'd reached St Pancras station to board the next Eurostar. At Gare du Nord, he'd taken another train to Amsterdam, where he'd arrived at three in the afternoon, wandering the streets until it had been time for his appointment.
John is sitting on the couch, skimming through the paper with a mug of tea by his side as Sherlock walks into the living room. He stands next to the coffee table and waits until John lowers the paper before slowly unbuttoning his coat. As the heavy wool falls open, Sherlock strokes his hand down over the damp shirt, usually crisply white but now soaked in pale yellow urine.
This is enough of an incentive for Sherlock to decide that he won't ask to be released, no matter what.
John's hands are steady as he threads the needle and sets to work a few minutes later. Sally makes Kate watch the proceedings, stroking her tits while holding her head up. Kate rests on her elbows and has a good view between her legs, witnessing how her sensitive flesh is tightly sewn shut underneath John's deft hands.
He stays with Sherlock until he falls asleep about ten minutes later, stroking his hair, mumbling praise and assurance into his skin. The last thing he hears is that John calls him beautiful, gorgeous, amazing. Sherlock desperately wants to believe it.
“Are you sure about this?” Sherlock's mother asks when the silence has become somewhat uncomfortable.
John immediately pins him to the hard wood, fiercely, urgent, kissing him viciously. His coarse beard scrapes over Sherlock's delicate face as he opens his mouth even wider to give John access.
It’s nothing like anything else John has put inside him during the past weeks. The stretch is solid, ever increasing; Sherlock pants and gasps as John gradually stuffs him, easing the toy in inch by inch.
As if Sherlock can read his thoughts – and perhaps he can – he sits up a little, wincing. “No. Please, no…” Sherlock is whispering, like a mantra. “Don’t stop. Don’t stop.”
Sherlock grins at the thought, by now sucking Greg's come from his his own fingers as he pushes the gooey mess into his mouth.
“See what I have here for you." Moriarty croons as he pulls back the white linen, exposing a male corpse. "He's even blond, like your little army doctor. Come over, take a look. I'm sure you two will have so much fun together. He's quite... pliant.“ Moriarty raises the dead man's arm and lets it fall back down again to emphasize his words before gesturing towards Sherlock's somewhat flagging erection. “Better keep it up. I fear we won't have much time left. The quicker you come, the earlier Molly is released.”
Ten minuets later, Sherlock sits in the back of a car, just clad in high heels and a soiled t-shirt covered by his coat, with spit drying on his face, come on his clothes, smelling unmistakeably of piss. But John is holding his hand, soothingly stroking his thumb over Sherlock's knuckles as he gives the driver an address. The cabbie doesn't even arch an eyebrow, just nods and drives on.
Sherlock can feel the plug inside him as he moves, dressing up in his dark purple shirt and a slim black suit. The sensation is not painful, just a bit odd. He feels stretched and filled; owned, because he does this for John, and John will be the only one allowed to remove the object. Sherlock is willing to sacrifice his body for John's pleasure. If John wants him open and prepared at any time, Sherlock will be exactly that.
“God, I really want to fuck you again, Sherlock.” He sighs and Sherlock moans in response around the rubber stuffing his mouth. He sucks it in deeper than he's thought possible, almost gagging on it and John smiles fondly and strokes his hair once before getting up to leave. Sherlock is thankful that John not only closes but also locks the door to their flat. No-one will disturb him as he plays with the rubber toy. He'll be a good slut and do as he was told. The dildo feels amazing in his mouth. How mind-blowing it will be when John eventually fucks him with it!
“Finish whatever you two are up to right now. I'm sending a car round. This is important. Comes from very high up. A former minister. Found dead in a very exclusive sex club you two might be familiar with. Sherlock's presence was specially requested by the owner, a Miss Irene Adler.”
After a moment, Acri had given another one of his boys a nod – a thin twink with brown hair and a hint of freckles – and obediently he had set to work, lubing his right arm up to the shoulder with the oily elbow grease before spearing his fingers and pushing them slowly inside the kneeling boy's arsehole, next to the hand already at play there. The sphincter had given way easily. As the broad knuckles breached the rim, however, the pig had gasped a little before his muscle had closed tightly around both wrists. John and Sherlock had watched with unabashed excitement.
As if sensing Sherlock's thoughts, John suddenly pulls out of Mark’s alluring mouth with a wet pop. It only takes a few fierce pulls to get him off, and then he comes with a low shout all over Mark’s face.
He marches into the room, stands in the middle, turns, scans everything, taking in all the minute details.
“I'll remove the cock cage now, but the plug stays.” John mumbles against Sherlock’s skin just below his left ear, and Sherlock sighs and nods again.
He bites down onto the plug and groans in pain when John forces a third finger inside him, the stretch of Sherlock's anus deliciously enwrapping John's knuckles. Moving in and out, John can hear Sherlock gasps in agony, especially as John starts to spread the fingers inside Sherlock, opening him up. Sherlock grunts and John can see his sphincter flutter as it gives way and relaxes.
This continues until the candle is almost burned down and threatens to sear John's fingers. But John doesn't just blow it out. Instead, he presses the stump with the still burning wick against Sherlock's right arse cheek where his Gluteus Maximus meets the Iliac Crest. Sherlock's body jerks in agony as he shrieks in panic and pain like a wounded animal, tearing at his bonds in a futile attempt to escape. The smell of charred flesh fills the room as John makes soothing sounds to assure Sherlock that it will all be over very soon.
Kate rides her own orgasm out above him until they are both spent and she slumps down, her head resting against John's scarred shoulder. Sherlock's head lies against John's quivering, sweaty thigh. His eye is nearly poked out by one of Kate's heels as she shakily climbs out of John's lap. Her weak legs don't support her anymore and she sinks down onto the floor, crouching next to Sherlock at John's feet.
“Well, you were certainly game to play with my brother. Maybe you wanted to bring a new participant in? See where that led to?”
Sherlock whimpers as he touches his over-sensitive cock and searches the slit. The clothes pins on his arms bite into his flesh as he moves, and he groans in agony. He can't see, as John's groin is blocking his view. But the pain guides him. He manages to insert the tip of his index finger before another raw choke shakes his body. He's almost convulsing in pain now, and the clothes pins pinching his skin only add to his utter discomfort.
“Did you make a mess, dear? Well, now you have to lie in it till the morning.” John tells him with a smirk in his voice before lying back down. He's soon gone back to sleep.
If he's honest with himself, he's afraid of their future. He needs John, yet is not sure how to keep him. Won't John tire of him rather sooner than later, when the newness of their... affiliation has faded. Are they even in a relationship? John calls him love but he also makes him hurt. The former is way harder to bear than the latter.
“Useful? How can shooting up be useful?” John shouts, throwing his hands up while glaring down at Sherlock, who's lounging nonchalantly on their bed.
But first of all Sherlock needs the toilet. His bowels are still irritated from the intrusion they suffered. They threaten to empty themselves any minute. So, with John's permission, Sherlock rushes to the bathroom.
“Sherlock. How very good to meet you, little brother.” Is there a threat in his smooth voice? John's not sure. “How are you? Our parents just told me about your... abduction.” Mycroft completely ignores John.
John cleans Sherlock up as good as possible, covering the cuts on his back with another towel to soak up the blood, then takes a hurried shower and dresses. Sherlock has told him that there is a pharmacy just round the corner where he'll get everything he needs.
When he's finished John shakes the last few drops into Sherlock's yearning face before ordering him to clean his wet cock with his mouth. Sherlock licks and sucks with abandon until John has to remove his rapidly hardening cock. This is not supposed to be a blow job.
When John attaches the leash to the collar, Sherlock sighs. He's coming down, sinking into subspace.
“Three? Like this?” John pushes his ring finger in as well and Sherlock moans as his hole relaxes enough to accommodate John.
Sherlock can feel his face heat up in humiliation. Oh, god! All those pictures John had taken! He has to close his eyes, unable to endure the lewd smirk Moriarty gives him.
Sherlock must have nodded off again, because suddenly, his very busy big brother is leaning over him, tenderly touching his shoulder. “It's late, Sherlock. Let’s all go to bed.”
“Oh. Then we'll better get you prepared.” But instead of getting up, they stay in bed a little while longer, limbs entangled, rolling around in the sheets, snogging like teenagers. Only when they're both too turned on to keep their hands off each other does John finally pull back.
Sherlock sucks and licks, pushes his tongue inside the stretched hole until the boy above him writhes and moans.
Sherlock kneels next to the table. His hands have been shackled to his ankles; his mouth is held open by a spider gag. Mycroft is spooning porridge into his mouth, but swallowing is difficult as the braces suppress his tongue while preventing his mouth from closing. Most of the mush is dripping out again as Sherlock fights his gag reflex. He must look a right mess, greyish gruel running down his chin, neck and chest. Yet Mycroft doesn't stop. Sherlock's eyes water as he tries to gulp down at least some of the breakfast. He's sure he'll need the sustenance. No use to pass out due to hypoglycaemia during one of their scenes.
They are both startled awake a few hours later in the early hours, grey light lazily seeping through the curtains. Both their mobiles start ringing insistently and simultaneously. That's not a good sign, John thinks, as he blearily staggers into the kitchen to take his call and retrieve Sherlock's phone from the desk in the living room.
“Hurt, doesn't it? Are you sure you prefer it like this?” John enquires, holding Sherlock firmly down.
“Very good.” John squeezes his arse cheek, rubs them together, and Sherlock moans in pain and pleasure. The thorns dig into his sensitive skin while stimulating all the nerve endings located at his entrance.
They share a quick shower, and, while getting dressed afterwards, Sherlock's phone pings. He's once again absorbed by the case. Apparently, there has been a new development.
John has taken a cab to Bart's and paid the driver fifty quid extra because he'd made the journey in record time. As he storms through the front door of the hospital, he almost collides with Molly Hooper in the foyer.
Sherlock's longing, come-covered face will serve him as wanking material over the next weeks of separation.
John helps Sherlock to lie down, tugging him under the soft sheets. He’s still wearing his hideous outfit. John will ask his parents for some of his old clothes. Sherlock keeps very still, grabbing the blanket, staring up at John from his bruised eyes. It’s evident that he doesn’t want to be here, but he also knows that they need a place to rest. And this is the safest they can be. Mycroft won’t do anything to his little brother under their parent’s roof.
He knew that it was kind of abhorrent. And still... just the mental images of Sherlock, clad in his pyjama pants, his crotch darkening; or Sherlock, standing in one of his bespoke suits in the kitchen, his tight trousers dripping with piss; or Sherlock, naked, kneeling on the bathroom floor in a pool of urine... suddenly, this had seemed incredibly enticing to John.
Sherlock is shivering in pain, the strain to his stomach already making his back muscles quiver and tighten. But he gives a small nod, indicating that he has understood, that he will be good, that he'll endure what they did to him. He tries to blink the tears from his eyes to look more accepting, humble, as if welcoming the gavage. He has to show them that he will comply, that he's grateful for their concern, or this will happen again.
He pushes back and gets up clumsily, staggering backwards, only narrowly avoiding another table. Then he turns and runs. Because this is like his worst nightmare come true and he's sure he's losing his mind.
Moriarty frowns and tilts his head. The next thing Sherlock feels is a a fierce blow, delivered with Moriarty's open hand against the sensitive place where thigh meets buttocks. Sherlock howls in pain, but still shakes his head, tears springing to his eyes.
“You don't have to drink it all. Just a bit. To show us how much you like it.” A glass filled with light yellow liquid is held in front of Sherlock's face. Yet his shaking fingers can't hold it, and he's unable to raise his arm. So John has to help him, holding the glass to Sherlock's lips as he slowly takes a few sips. It tastes stale. The caustic odour fills Sherlock's nostrils despite the tube. He doesn't want to swallow, wants to turn away, but he obeys and takes another swig.
“Take it, Sherlock.” John orders, finally moving away. He turns back around and watches Greg emptying his full bladder inside Sherlock's anus. “Try to  keep it inside. I prepared you for this.”
“I got some of my stuff. But we'll need to buy new ones to use on you. I'd never had a virgin before so you'll need lots of preparation. But look what I got for you so far.”
When he's spent John admires his work. Sherlock's face and hair are streaked with glistening pearly come. “Lovely...” John murmurs, reaching down. It only needs a few strokes of Sherlock's abused cock to wring the second orgasm that day from him. He comes all over the kitchen floor and is elated as John orders him to lick it up. Sherlock crawls onto his hands and knees as he eagerly slurps his semen off the linoleum.
“Up.” John tells him after a few moments. He comes up again, his face dripping with come, forming bubbles in front of his mouth as he breathes rapidly. In a reflex, he licks his lips, tasting semen mixed with gastric acid. It should be disgusting but it really turns him on; he undulates his hips in a pathetic little gesture, whining as the sound pushes in even deeper.
Sherlock groans in pain but pushes the damp jeans aside and sets each of his hand into the yellow puddle for leverage. Then he lowers his face, opens his mouth, and starts to slurp his own urine from the floorboards.
Sherlock is panting hard by now and has trouble staying up, his wiry arms shaking, but John has been adamant that he stays upright and watches. So he does.
After a few more moments John slowly peels the dead candle end away from Sherlock's arse and moves up the side of his body until he kneels next to Sherlock's tear-stained face. As John strokes Sherlock's damp curls from his forehead he can see Sherlock's pulse hammer in his throat.
“I want you to deal with me as you see fit.” Sherlock whispers, staring directly into John's cobalt blue eyes. “Do anything you want with me.”
“We should clean him up now before his wounds get infected.” Irene reminds John. But John can smell Sherlock's sweat and blood and musk and suddenly he knows that if he won't be fucking him right now his balls might explode. He's so hard he has trouble to unzip his trousers.
Sherlock concentrates on his breathing – inhaling, holding, exhaling - but it starts to get ragged. He's panting and moaning, biting his lower lip, his hot, flushed face resting on the table.
Sherlock tries to stay ramrod straight and not to twitch a muscle. But that is getting harder by the minute as John wanks him so exquisitely lazy and slowly, just how he likes it, paying attention to his already tight balls as well, playing with his foreskin, massaging his frenulum.
Sherlock sets the mug down and stares at him for a long moment before suddenly dashing into the corridor, pulling on his coat. John follows him onto the landing.
They don't have lube at hand but that doesn't matter as they are both sweaty and John is leaking copiously. Ad he pushes in between Sherlock's legs, the friction is exquisite. It's so tight! His hard shaft is rubbing along Sherlock's perineum and balls, brushing the by now cold wax covering Sherlock's cock, eliciting a long, needy sigh from the man in front of him.
“If you only knew, John. Anyway, it's nice for once getting help from someone I didn't quite expect. You'll both go down and I won't even have to move a finger. I think the drug's squad will be over at your flat by noon. Good day, John.” Mycroft hangs up.
John looks gone, sweat dripping down his face, lost in pleasure and arousal. And suddenly, Sherlock is beyond pain and despair, because he's doing this to John. He makes John loose himself in this act. I'm doing this for you, Sherlock thinks, and suddenly, John presses his mouth over Sherlock's severed lips, licking, caressing, as he comes deep inside Sherlock's body.
“Move, please, John...” Sherlock actually tries to rock back further and John has to grab his hip with one hand to stop him.
But John takes his time, admiring Sherlock’s extremely stretched hole instead of ravishing him here and now. The black rubber spreads him wide open, exposing his light pink insides. As his rim tries to flutter in excitement under John's scrutiny, the rubber device doesn’t give. It's so frustrating that Sherlock almost sobs in deprivation.
John had watched the scratches and bruises fade on Sherlock's body while he played with him. He'd stroked Sherlock's cock whenever he'd felt like it, making him gasp and shudder, sweat glistening on his pale skin.
“That's the only thing your dirty hole is good for, Sherlock.” He tells him as he starts to move the brush in and out.
The sleek black car races through the night. After a few miles, John pulls over into an unpaved side track and parks the car to rummage through the boot. He's seen a blanket there earlier. It's a soft chequered woollen plaid that smells faintly of petrol, but it will have to do. He drapes it over Sherlock before gently stroking his hair back from his forehead. He can't tend to his injuries here, in the dark. He needs proper light, hot water. But he has a plan.
Finally, the plug is removed. The sounds his excrements make as they gush out of him indicate that the shady figures must have placed a bucket beneath his arse, for which Sherlock is eternally grateful. He wants to sink down onto his knees and thank his saviours, praise them, and his gagged mouth distorts into a manic smile. He's sure he's never felt happier in his whole life.
Until Sherlock pulls back and swallows audibly before speaking again. “Now, what I need you to do is to step outside and say something.”
“Are you seriously expecting me to spend the afternoon bend over the coffee table while you play with my arse, while Moriarty is on the loose?” Sherlock asks, his tone acerbic.
Mycroft hums approvingly as he again fondles Sherlock's testicles. The pressure building with no hope for release is mindbogglingly frustrating. John bowing down, coaxing Sherlock’s mouth open with his tongue, doesn't help much either.
His whole body spasms, a shiver running down his spine. His eyelids flutter as his mouth crinkles in a dreamy smile. He drifts. John can almost taste his pain, his surrender. It's amazing.
“You'll be alright here for a while?” He asks, and Sherlock groans softly. In the distance, his phone chimes, forgotten in their living room. “I'll tell your friends you're indisposed.”
“Shall I use the Tiger Balm again?” John asks in a low voice and Sherlock shakes his head frantically as he remembers the last time.
“Your brother and I worked out a routine for you. You will follow it, strictly. I'm here to take care of that. You'll get up at seven every morning and clean yourself – shower, shaving, enema - then go down to the kitchen and wait for me. You'll be fed some glucose via your nasal tube and I'll tend to your piercings and the tattoo. Then it's playtime. You have to train your body. Afterwards, you'll be tied down in the attic as an exercise in patience, on which you also have to work. In the evening, I might use you as I please – or not, if I'm not in the mood. Your cock will be put back in the cage the whole time. You only speak when asked a direct question. You only do as you are told. You'll kneel in my presence until told otherwise. You won't be wearing any clothes apart from the ones I give you. I'll feed you a nutrient solution with a syringe via the nasogastric tube before you are allowed to retire to bed. Any transgression will be met with immediate, severe punishment over the first days. Later, when you've had sufficient time to take the rules in, I'll compile your infringements, and you'll be punished at the end of the day. Have you understood?”
“Not that well, as you can imagine. But I was able to distract him for the time being. That doesn't mean he won't have questions... later.”
John nods, feeling like he’s been caught red-handed while nosing around. Sherlock's dad continues: “I just thought I better tell you. It wasn’t easy with him, you see. You’ve seen his room?”
“That's it. Eat my ass out. Nice and slow.” John holds himself upright with one hand at the edge of the desk, his erection bopping right in front Sherlock's eyes.
“I didn't, John, please, of course, I didn't.” Sherlock is almost babbling, the words spilling out of him in a desperate attempt to get back into John's good books. “But I'm sure she recognised the company I was with. They were snorting coke at her kitchen table, and she eyed me all the time. I'm sure she took some photos on her mobile.” John groans. “But don't you see, this is perfect, John. My drug habit will make the papers. They'll have a field day, calling me a junkie, unstable, and whatever else. That's exactly what we need.”
It feels perfect, natural, to be on his knees in front of his brother, but a sharp tug at the chain pulls him to his feet again, albeit reluctant.
They rub against each other, kissing and licking their skin, open-mouthed and greedy, and both moan, swapping bodily fluids, lost in the feeling, the taste, joined by enjoying the absolute lewdness of their dirty actions.
After fifteen minutes, Sherlock is openly crying. There's a core of white, hot agony lodged in his middle, radiating pain. All his muscles are pulled taut. It feels as if he might snap any minute. His cheeks and neck are wet with tears and spit. It's seeping under his collar, making his skin itch.
“See you tomorrow, then. At home.” John tries to sound cheerful and uplifting, but his tone rings false and put on in his own ears. Sherlock doesn't answer, just closes his eyes again.
Moriarty stares at John for a moment before his eyes flick around the room, wild and manic. John takes a step towards him, then another. But suddenly, there's a scalpel in Moriarty's hand. He wields it like a dagger, slicing the air between them. John suddenly becomes blatantly aware that he is unarmed.
Sherlock sobs. He cries. He begs – but not for less, for more. Greg shoots John an amazed glance as he delivers yet another ten thrashes for good measure on Sherlock's already red arse. After a few more strokes, however, Greg's arm starts to hurt.
Sally quickly picks up her pants and dress but then glances over towards the two men who still embrace one another. Sherlock's head rests back on John's shoulder, his face flushed, eyes bright and burning.
.” Sherlock gasps, oblivious to any discomfort, not even able to catalogue all the sensations and signals his body is firing up to his brain.
Over the next few days, the new routine is implemented. At first, Sherlock has trouble adjusting. For example, when John orders him to stretch himself with various large dildos and plugs, or other objects he likes to see up Sherlock's arse (a wine bottle, a cucumber, a candle), he doesn't comply quick enough, but instead eyes the instruments chosen for him wearily. John has to slap his face a few times to make Sherlock do as he's told.
“I'm not talking about him, I'm talking about us.” Sherlock's voice is cold, devoid of any compassion.
Excruciatingly slow, as not to upset Sherlock's stomach, John pulls the hose out. It feels like his bowels being dragged out of him. Sherlock closes his eyes and wills himself not to throw up. Eventually, the feeder gag is unbuckled, only to be replaced by a large ball gag. But it's a relief, compared to the degrading rubber hose.
Molly does as she is told, her face stony. Her hands shake a little as she passes the keys to John. Afterwards, she pulls off her soiled lab coat and cardigan and tosses them to the ground.
But John isn't that easily fooled. “How about we get some Chinese again tonight?” He asks with a smirk as he gets the menu pinned to the fridge door. “I have some new ideas how to use the chop sticks.”
Sherlock can't help it, a giggle erupts from his strained throat. As if he would need a safe word – with John.
While John goes downstairs to get the first aid kit from one of the staff rooms, Sherlock and Sally arrange Kate on a large desk between the windows. There's a table lamp which they position at an angle that John will have a perfectly illuminated operation area. Finally, they tape Kate's ankles to the desk's legs. When the preparations are finished, Sally tenderly strokes Kate's inner thighs, alternating the caress with brushing her knuckles over Kate's wet cunt.
Soon, the wax has filled the small orifice and starts to coat Sherlock's cock head. John continues his ministrations until Sherlock's cock is covered in a congealed layer of white stearin, looking almost like a candle itself. Even Sherlock's fingers are coated, resembling frozen come. It looks absolutely stunning. John crushes his mouth onto Sherlock’s in a bruising kiss.
“We'll start with this.” John says, stroking first the paddle and then Sherlock's bare arse admiringly.
John must have heard when the shower was turned off, for he's back in the bathroom a few minutes later while Sherlock is still towelling himself off. He has their first aid kit with him. Sherlock's wrists and ankles are sore and there's the burn high on his bum. John uses antiseptic and burn ointment before putting some gauze over the bright red mark. It sits high enough on Sherlock's arse that he'll be able to sit without too much discomfort. In addition to the meds John has also brought a plug for Sherlock with him – the smaller black toy they'd started with yesterday.
“Well, I have to say, up until now he seems very well behaved. Shall we see how he gets on with the maid?”
John admires his work, caressing the buttocks with the tongue of the crop. Sherlock is openly crying by now, biting down on his lower lip. John steps up close behind him and brushes his clothed groin over the sensitive skin. Sherlock can't suppress a groan as John rocks his hips against his abused body.
“I am just a hole, John, for you to use. Sorry, John.” Sherlock mumbles; he's sure the kick will give him a large black bruise within the next hour. He loves it, and will wear it with pride. He even imagines John ordering him to show it off, perhaps to Miss Adler at his next visit.
“Yes, Sir.” Sherlock pants, wiggling his bum. “Please, Sir, give me more. I've been such a naughty boy, I need more.”
I'm so sorry, folks, but real life has been a mess lately. I don't like to whine but it was difficult to find time to write. But now I'm back on track, and even with S4 approaching, I feel positive to be able to return to my usual update schedule. Sorry again for letting it slide a bit. This will be continued.
“It doesn't have to be like... back at the manor.” Sherlock says, his long fingers wrapping around the chain tying him to the bed.
John. John's firm touch, full of confidence. His harsh voice, giving strict orders he has to obey. He wants to obey. Because he trusts John. Because it is intoxicating to give up control. To John, who knows what he needs. To let go. John, who pushes his boundaries relentlessly, making him whole, making him want. More. John, fucking him, hard, deep and fast, without mercy. John, who beats him and torments him and gives him what he craves. Sensation. Pain. Care. Love...
“Might as well staple some papers with you, later, training your anal muscles...” Greg smiles darkly before taking off his trousers, getting on all four on the floor.
When the bag is empty John explains: “I'm going to remove the nuzzle. Clench your muscles as firm as you can. You don't want to sit in a tub filled with your excrements. Try to hold the water inside you as long as possible. The longer you can hold it, the cleaner you'll be afterwards. Ready?”
“Look into the camera, Sherlock.” A hard kick to his ribs, then another. “Look. At. Me. Say you are mine.”
They spend the rest of the day in the sitting room. John plays with Sherlock's piercings and his dribbling cock until he's almost mad with want. The large plug fills him beautifully, and he's allowed to rock on it, making the toy shift inside him. Yet, the cock ring prevents him effectively from coming.
Something thorny is slowly wound around his legs, first around his left calve up to mid-thigh, then around the right. Sherlock gasps out in shock.
He can feel his brother's hand stroke up his sweaty spine, lingering at his nape. “I'll show you, little brother.” Mycroft whispers. “I'll be so good to you. But it always hurts the first time. Can't be helped. We have to prepare your tight little virgin hole first, Sherlock. God, you are still so tight.” Mycroft scratches his manicured nails down Sherlock's back before giving the base of the plug a decisive twist. Sherlock bucks his hips involuntarily. “God, look at him, John. He's stretched past endurance and still... So eager. Almost greedy.”
When Sherlock reaches for the wet hard cock in front of him, however, John stops him by saying: “That's not for you, I'm afraid.”
And Sherlock does, sucking on Greg's swollen hole, spreading his cheeks further apart with his thumbs to reach more of him. He has no idea how long he's been servicing Lestrade like this. His jaw starts to hurt but he knows he's not allowed to stop. He listens to his brother's soft moans over the phone, relishing the feeling to pleasure both men at once.
Sherlock is by now shaking his head as much as his constriction allows, sobbing and quietly begging: “Please, don't... don't ask this. Please, I can't... No.”
“You've been very good today, Sherlock. What would you like me to use on you tonight? It's your choice.”
Sherlock feels nauseous, yet he nods. John had made him wear a short tight dress all day, that's now pushed up over his hips as he bounces on John's lap, riding his hard cock.
Sherlock remembers fantasising about a scenario like this. Only, for real, it makes him feel vulnerable and exposed. Fear pools ice-cold in his belly; he doesn't know these men. They could do anything they want to him. But then he remembers that failing John again will lead to the end of his education. He can't allow this, not now, when he truly starts to embrace subspace. Besides, he was  promised to be eventually given to his brother. Well, now that would be quite an experience, Sherlock imagines. He won't miss out on that, he decides.
Any attempt at fighting or running is futile, Sherlock registers, as he tries to arrange his body into a sitting position. He's too weak. His head lolls from side to side and his limbs dangle from his torso as if they don't belong to him. Like a rag doll, he thinks. I'm just someone's toy now.
“Shut up, Sherlock. Just shut the fuck up, or I can't guarantee for anything.” Sherlock goes very still. Never has he seen John's anger directed at him with such a force. His mouth is pressed into a tight line while a vein throbs on his creased forehead. Sherlock instinctively knows that he has to treat very carefully.
“Perhaps it’s all been too much. Us. Your brother, what he did to you, your flight, now this… new identities, us roaming Europe with no plan or destination. Perhaps I pushed you too far.” John can hear the uncertainty creep into his voice. He’s the one supposed to lead here, but at the moment he’s unsure how to proceed. The night takes its toll on him as well. John didn't like Sherlock becoming a pliant fuckboy, but his own reaction to Sherlock showing defiance tonight frightens him as well.
Over the next 20 minutes John drizzles hot wax over Sherlock's exposed perineum, his shaft, his spread cleft – even the base of the glass plug – before finally devoting his attention to Sherlock's glans and slit. It doesn't help that Sherlock can see where the hot splashes will hit him next, as the knowledge of the pain caused by this torture is at least half the agony he experiences. But he can also see how much John enjoys punishing him in this way. His eyes are dark and his breathing is almost as ragged as Sherlock's.
“Don't leave me alone.” Is the last thing Sherlock can say, his voice shaking slightly, before his mouth is covered as well. The only way he can breathe now is through two small cavities over his nostrils.
John waits for him in their living room, getting up from the sofa as Sherlock enters, squaring his shoulders, feet at parade's rest.
“God, it's hot.” John's not only referring to the temperature in their room. The lingering smell of sex combined with Sherlock's noises have him half-hard again already. But it's simply too hot to fuck and John is nearing forty.
Mycroft had arrived with the SWAT team but had stayed back in their van to watch the action from a safe distance. Therefore, he wasn't aware of the details of the scene down at the morgue. John should have known that such a state of uncertainty wasn't acceptable to a Holmes.
He later makes the most desperate and funny noises when John starts to play with his stiff, tortured nipples. John takes his time as he pinches, pulls, licks and bites the sensitive nubs until they are bright red and raw. He imagines getting those lovely nipples pierced, two thick silver studs attached to them, but is sure he has to consult with Mycroft first.
John presses a condom wrapper into Greg's hand, who rips it open quickly and starts to roll it on, much to Sherlock's dismay.
“God, Sherlock, if you could see yourself...” That's John's voice next to his ear. And then there are lips pressing against the rubber covering his mouth, licking the latex that separates them. Sherlock moans and leans forward, in the direction of the body heat, and loses his balance again. But John is there, holding him, grabbing his waist, and Sherlock wraps his legs around him. He swings in the air, but John carries him, strong arms slung around him. John's jeans are pressing against his sensitive groin. Sherlock gets hard again despite the catheter, and it's utterly painful but still intoxicating. He ruts against John, who lets him, holds him.
Irene opens a door on the first floor and steps aside to let John and Sherlock walk past her. At first glance it seems to be a rather spacious study with a large oak desk and a few hardbacked chairs in the middle. An elegant chaise lounge with a low coffee table beside it is placed at the far wall between two windows. The thin white curtains prevent anyone from seeing inside while still letting natural light stream into the room.
John stays like this for minutes, and Sherlock doesn't move, just gasps for air. He still feels John's fist violating his insides, stretching him, filling him. He even begs John to stay inside him as John starts to pull out, and John gives in, turning his fist a few more times until he finally dislodges his arm as he can feel Sherlock's wobbly legs start to give out.
“I could do this all night.” John says in a dreamy voice. “My finger breaching you... god, the sight of it. My white come seeping out of your red hole. I can feel your pulse down here, Sherlock.”
When John returns to the bedroom, Sherlock hasn't moved. He still kneels in his and Greg's come and piss on the edge of the mattress
“Please, don’t do that, John. I can’t… not right now.” He’s begging. He knows he shouldn’t but he can’t help it. No.
As you can see, this fic will run for two more chapters. Don't worry, though, we all know that Sherlock Holmes is the man who never dies...
John is aware how tense Sherlock is when they get back to Baker Street. He's already powering up his laptop when John walks through the door mere five seconds behind him. He didn't even take the time to shed his Belstaff.
“Please, no, please...” Kate starts to beg, but Sally's finger inside her speed up as her other hand clamps down over Kate's mouth. The maid doesn't resist.
He'll do anything, and they both know it. This is the greatest freedom he's ever known. But it's coming with a responsibility John can only hope to be worth of.
When Acri realises what's going on, he slaps the boy hard, a few times. His head lolls on his neck, spit flying from his contorted lips, but his eyes find Sherlock's again, two bottomless lakes of cold bleakness that make Sherlock recoil. It's like starring into a dark mirror, a disquieting outlook into a possible future. He can hear his brother's sonorous voice in his head, calling his name.
When John starts to bite down on his nipples, Sherlock is done. He whimpers and sobs as he comes, his cock twitching beneath the shiny satin. Then the fabric darkens as his come starts to soak the lace.
Sherlock has to swallow a few times, his Adam's apple bobbing in his parched throat. “Please John. I'm so hot. I need something to cool me down, on my hole. God, it burns. I might get mad.”
Sherlock opens his eyes and smiles back up at him, a lewd, promising grin on his face. “Anywhere. I'll go anywhere you want, John Watson. Even to hell.”
Eventually, John bows down and grabs Sherlock's curls, kicking the bowl away. Sherlock is grateful for John's help, even if John pulling his hair hurts. But instead of allowing him to get up, John pushes Sherlock's face down onto the floor and directs him him to lick the floor clean. Sherlock struggles to obey as his tongue swipes over the not to clean linoleum. When all the rice is gone, John starts dropping some of his own noodles, forcing Sherlock to slurp them up as well. Sherlock hurries to comply, eagerly shuffling forward to please John, accepting his place as some sort of human bin and nothing more.
After a few minutes, John can't stay upright any longer. He bows forward, grabbing Sherlock's wrists above his head, pinning him down. Sherlock can't move, is surrounded by John, at his mercy. John is in total control, his cock rubbing against Sherlock's forehead. Precome drips into Sherlock's curls. They stay like this for a long time. Sherlock's jaw starts to ache but he doesn't falter. He licks and sucks, trailing his tongue in long, sensuous swipes through John's creak before tonguing his lose hole again. John ruts against his face, pressing down before raising himself just a little bit to allow Sherlock a moment to breathe. Sherlock's cock lies hard and straining against his concave belly and weeps with need.
“See, Sherlock, that's the problem with you. You think this is a game, something that can be turned on and off again as it suits you. Well, let me tell you: it isn't. It's a way of life. Which you embarked on. You asked me to take you down this road. Your brother employed me to help you along. But you chose it. Because you want to embrace it. Only, sometimes, you need a reminder.”
“You are not tied up. If it gets too much, you can free yourself.” John tells him. “But I'd rather you did not. You look absolutely stunning. I will be gone for a few hours. But I promise that we play when I get back. Can you do that for me?”
This time, Sherlock is stored in the closet with a dildo gag attached to his face. John tells him before leaving that he has plans with him tonight – but doesn't disclose what those plans exactly constitute of. Sherlock has plenty of time – bound and gagged and stored in a dark cupboard – to figure it out, keep his mind busy and come up with scenarios.
It's over far too soon. The rivulets of piss become a dribble. The look on Sherlock's face is something John has never seen before. Total bliss.
“And you want them to meet Sherlock? All of them? And by meeting I don’t mean having small talk over dinner.” John asks. He needs to know if what he presumes is correct.
“I... I'm not... I don't...,” he stammers, his voice hoarse from lack of use. He starts to blink rapidly, and his body is suddenly shaking. He can't stop it.
“No, you git. Messed up, wounded, jealous and on the run.” John smiles, still holding unto Sherlock, who grins back. John takes his hand and places it over his groin.
“We shouldn’t have come here. It’s not that Mycroft won’t be able to find us.” Sherlock huffs after a few minutes, turning on his back.
Mycroft is the first to pull out, cautiously shoving Sherlock against John's chest. God, his arse burns! Sherlock hisses and John hugs him, holding his trembling body close, stroking his sweaty back. After some moments, when the first shock has abated, John slowly, carefully, raises Sherlock from his lap to slip out of him as well. The emptiness is distressing. Come literally gushes out of Sherlock, coalescing on the bed-sheet, seeping into the blankets. It's disgusting. Disturbing. Sherlock is shaking, unable to control his body.
“Oh, are we not a little bit self-righteous here, Doctor Watson? If I remember correctly, you offered my brother to four random strangers you met at a pub, to shag him almost into unconsciousness before letting him lick their urine from your kitchen floor. Who do you think you are to judge me?”
Suddenly, Mycroft's touch is gone. “Let's have some nibbles, shall we?” He offers cheerfully, as if this was just a usual invitation to tea. “Sherlock, get over to the fire place and kneel down. You'll be serving us.”
Sherlock is by now shivering in the rapidly cooling splashes of piss that cover his naked body. But there's still something to do before he'll be allowed to shower. John takes the still warm bottle back into the kitchen and puts it in the fridge. He knows it's sterile, but anyway. No good if Sherlock catches something by drinking contaminated beverages.
“I know that you can't service me in the usual way right now, but I think you owe me at least a hand job for saving your virtue from those friend's of your brother.”
He looks truly delectable. As he shimmies closer, John stands still and watches him until the man smiles wickedly, takes John's hand and places it right over his groin. John can feel an impressive length throb beneath the shiny rubber.
“Better.” Sherlock moves a little and winces. John had needed five stitches to repair the damage caused by the rape. The knot of a Great Dane is truly massive.
John steps up close and scrapes his fingernails down Sherlock's lower abdomen until they brush through the dark hair above his cock.
“You could show me, Ormond.” The Italian suggests playfully. He's standing next to the wooden bench with only one boy still sitting on it. Now Acri grabs the his head and presses it against his crotch. Obedient lips start immediately to suck him through the silk of his dressing gown.
He loses track of time. The light changes in the living room as they go on and on. John's taste fills his mouth, his smell, an intoxicating musk, surrounding him. Sherlock's cock is pulsing against his belly, glistening with precome. He's wet all over, filthy, reduced to a panting, choking mess, kneeling between John's spread legs, servicing him. The noises he makes... spluttering, whimpering, groaning around John's hard cock, begging for more, for his come to taste, his release to swallow.
“I can hear neither you nor that moaning cockslut anymore, so I presume the receiver is fully inside him? Just take a picture and send it to me, please, for confirmation.”
“This is...” John is unable continue, speechless with frustration. But instead of hitting him again, John manhandles Sherlock over into the bedroom and throws him onto the unmade bed, towering over him. Sherlock rolls on his back and stares up at John, waiting.
He wakes up the next morning, still wedged between two bodies. John is quietly snoring, but Mycroft seems to be already awake. His left hand plays with Sherlock's left nipple as his prominent erection pokes Sherlock in the back of his thigh. He still feels somewhat sore, but doubts that his discomfort will impress his brother.
“I don't know. This mattress is killing me. The sheets are an abomination. They smell of rose potpourri, for god's sake.”
When Mycroft fastens the clamps over Sherlock's nipples the instant pressure makes him gasp. The pegs bite, despite being sheathed in a thin layer of black rubber, but not as sharp as John's clover clamps. The chain, however, is made of solid silver, and its weight pulls strenuously at Sherlock's sensitive nipples.
“As you rightly mentioned, I was averse to the pissing... thing, at first.” Sherlock gives a little embarrassed cough. “Therefore, I suggest that you give me nothing else to drink as your or my bodily fluids until I'm used to it. Aversion therapy.”
“Those bruises...” Sherlock's father seems searching for words. “And the rings in his...” He turns a bright prune as he gestures vaguely in front of his chest.
“Oh god!” Sherlock groans. It truly stings. The sensation is enhanced by increased blood flow due to the manual stimulation. Beyond the prickling burn it is not entirely unpleasant...
“You are going to blackmail him, aren’t you? That’s tremendously stupid of you.” Sherlock sounds rather disappointed in the face of John's alleged idiocy.
John strokes and squeezes him for some minutes until he's empty. “Finished?” He asks, his voice rough. Sherlock can see how turned on John is by his mishap, how much he likes to see Sherlock like this – humiliated, degraded, filthy, yet horny as hell.
Only, as they reach the pavement outside 221b, Sherlock's arm already in the air to flag down a cab, John feels his own phone vibrate.
“But tell me, Mr Holmes, how do you explain about the drugs?” The voice is cool, with a somewhat harsh Nordic accent. “There's photographic evidence.”
“Hold still.” John says as he grabs Sherlock's hips and slightly spreads his legs so Sherlock's arse is raised in the air while his face rests on the dirty floor. Very slowly John inserts one of his chop sticks into Sherlock's twitching anus. It slides in easily. When it's half-way up Sherlock's rectum, John takes another; Sherlock ends up with all four chop sticks up his arse, panting with excitement. John admires his work before starting to rotate the sticks, wiggling them, pushing them in and out, careful not to hurt and penetrate Sherlock's intestinal tract. Sherlock stays very still, just breathes and lets John use his hole.
Just as Sherlock contemplates getting up and using the toilet, those blue eyes suddenly open, fixing him with a surprisingly focused stare.
He can see Moriarty taking a picture of the corpse covered in Sherlock's semen, and then of him, lying on his back on the cold concrete floor, arms wrapped around his head, trembling with disgust.
“Oh, of course, it will be my pleasure so give you a little demonstration of the use and impact of the different devices.” Her smile broadens. Sherlock swallows hard and cranes his neck to get a better look at what John and Irene are inspecting.
Mycroft finally lowers the folder. “I wanted to see you. Ask how you cope.” Mycroft fixes his brother with an unreadable stare. “How are you, brother mine?”
It's not huge, it's enormous. Luckily, it's cone-shaped, and therefore the upper third slides in rather easily. Sherlock has been trained well. He’s now able to accommodate such a girth, but it still takes some effort. He can feel ridge after ridge being pressed inside him, helped by a lavishly applied large amount of lube, dripping down his bollocks and thighs.
Sherlock has to lie in his piss all morning as John forbids him to get up. Meanwhile, he showers, has breakfast, checks his emails, reads the paper and goes to Tesco to do some shopping. Sherlock is left alone, curled up in their soiled bed, the wet cotton clinging to his skin, wrapping him like a cocoon. He's achingly hard, and just yearns to hump a pillow, but he doesn't, because he's pretty sure John wouldn't approve.
Having his fingerprints and DNA taken would certainly alert Mycroft. He’s sure nothing the man opposite could do to him would be worse than what he’s to expect from his brother. Therefore, the only logical answer to the question put to him is to agree.
“Come here. Lick.” John pushes his come covered hand into Sherlock's mouth, all five fingers. Sherlock chokes as he tries to open wide enough to accommodate John’s knuckles, but immediately starts to suck, his tongue cleaning Mycroft's and John's come with his own blood from John’s fingers that are obscenely stretching his mouth. But Sherlock’s suckling is weak and not as eager as usual.
John ties the end of the leash to one leg of the desk. Sherlock has to kneel next to it as John sits down in a chair. He's palming himself through his jeans. Sherlock licks his lips as his eyes are glued to John's groin.
When Sherlock's hole is nicely stretched beyond what he thought anatomically possible, Mycroft sits back onto John's legs, pulling Sherlock's back flush against his chest, one arm braced over his brothers sternum. John catches on and pushes up on his elbows, then almost sits up. The angle of their cocks change, and their glans are suddenly rubbing against each other deep inside Sherlock's body.
“Come, John, join me.” Mycroft invites John inside the spacious shower cubicle. Sherlock is made to kneel at their feet and soap their lower body regions while the men above him wash cream and sticky residue from their hair. Soon, they start to lather their chests with fragrant soap. There’s something going on between them, a shared heated look, an outstretched hand, a touch, and suddenly they are engaged in deep messy kisses while Sherlock works their cocks rhythmically in both his hands, expensive shower gel making his fists conveniently slippery.
