Dean sealed his mouth around the head of Cas’s dick and jacked his length. Cas squirmed and moaned until he shouted Dean’s name, and his body shook. Dean’s mouth filled and—
“You’re the fucking love of my life, man,” Dean exhaled.
John turned toward Cas. “Can you
Cas’s hand went limp. “What?”
“Like shit, the fuck you think?”
. What the fuck, Cas?”
Dean sniffled, but satisfied Cas would stay, his eyes closed and drifted close to sleep.
“You didn’t even give me a chance to say anything. Not one second.”
Cas kept Dean’s hand against his chest. “Did John hurt you?
Cas had a runner’s thighs with tan skin covered in soft hair. His dick was hard and long. Dean had been around the block, but this… He’d never seen anyone like Cas before, and not only because he had honest-to-god wings behind him. The planes and sinew of his body had been chiseled into a perfect vessel.
“I believe she is just very… forward.”
Cas turned to meet Dean’s sleepy green eyes. “Didn’t know you needed sleep in Heaven,” Dean said. He stretched his arms over his head then flopped onto Cas, flinging an arm over his waist.
” Sam says enthusiastically. “We have an apprentice!”
“Not at all, Ma’am.”
Well, he hopes so.
It takes a while for Castiel to get his bearings after that night. There’s no denying that some sort of spellcraft was used on him, and yet it’s so unfathomable that Castiel can’t wrap his mind around it. He spends three days mostly in his room, save for when it’s time for chores or meals. He cleans his little room obsessively, fixes every crooked board and bent nail he can find. He cleans both guns, washes every washable item in his bag, then his bag. Anything to stop thinking about the idea that magic is real and that his gut is telling him he spent the last several months tracking and planning to kill the wrong men.
“Looking for two things,” Castiel says, using the authoritative voice he’s been perfecting the past few months. “Place for board, and these two men.” Castiel takes out the wanted poster that features both Winchester brothers, placing it on the shop counter.
“That’s a childish way to respond.”
Castiel is terrified, and awed. This room feels more holy and sacred than any church he has ever set foot in.
“I hope you realize how eerie that is,” Castiel says, putting his hat back over his face.
“CAS!” The room shouts in unison.
He works his hand slowly, face buried in the bruised skin at Dean’s neck. The hickeys will heal when Dean sleeps, for the magic in his body can’t help but work to regenerate him when he’s unconscious, but Dean still loves being marked.
“HEY!” Bobby shouts from further in the house. “No magic indoors! You know the rules, Dean!”
“You must be Castiel,” Sam says with a grin, turning to cleave the head off a fourth vampire Castiel hadn’t even noticed rushing through the barn door. “I’ve heard a lot about you.”
“I didn’t say the rumors were
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Sam says, slapping Castiel on the back with gusto. “We’ll figure something out. Go get some rest, tomorrow I’m teaching you about sirens.”
Castiel blinks and the entire world seems to change, because Dean Winchester is kissing him. Gently, just for a moment, but a kiss nonetheless.
“Also true. Usually we’re good at what we do, you know, but if you get sloppy, or if things go sideways… it draws attention.”
Castiel groans when they collapse on their backs in the blanket-covered pile of hay. “I wouldn’t call it
“You’re observant,” Castiel replies. He hasn’t slept or eaten in two days, he’s a bit peevish. The man grins, though, setting down the empty jar he was cleaning.
Lawrence isn’t all that different from the other areas of Kansas that Castiel’s made his way through during the past few months. More wheat and cattle country, ground beaten into hard roads by years of horses and stagecoaches. It’s bigger than most other towns, aside from Wichita and the capital, but it still looks the same. After months zigzagging through Kansas on foot, horseback, and any other method, it all looks the same.
Dean proudly talks about training, and how Castiel almost got himself killed back in Cherryvale. Castiel feels embarrassed until it turns out nearly everyone in the room has an “I was almost killed by a vampire” story.
There’s open space when he reaches the bottom, a large… very large room. Almost as large as the entire perimeter of the house, even. There are a few stone pillars for load bearing, but other than that it’s a fairly open space. Nothing in it is burned. There are two beds, a big desk with chairs, and several shelves overflowing with books. The floor is etched in large, ornate occult symbols. There are crates and trunks with strange sigils on them, swords displayed on the walls, and jar after jar of unusual substances meticulously arranged on what appears to be an apothecary table. Despite there being no ventilation, the air down here is clean and breathable, there are even a few potted plants thriving despite a lack of sunlight. Strangest of all, the lights that Castiel assumed were gas lamps aren’t gas lamps at all, but jars with bright, slowly moving lights trapped inside.
When he wakes the next morning, he and Dean both eat large bowls full of oatmeal and diced berries. Castiel is groggy, so he doesn’t bother asking how Dean cooked the oatmeal.
Once to get me and Sammy to Cherryvale, once to get you and me back here.”
Searching through the room, Castiel is able to find all of those things. These, he does take. He has to assume if they were vital to Sam and Dean’s hunting excursions, they’d have the items with them. The things Castiel finds are old, scratched, stained with blood. Probably spares.
“Mhmm,” Gadreel says, “well I know the produce market’s got a special on cabbage this week, but don’t be feeding that to Angel unless you like your horses stinkin’ up all the breathable air.”
“Yeah, that takes more power and it’s a bitch to maintain.”
But Jimmy’s dead, remains laid to rest with their parents all the way back in Wichita. Castiel is the one who has to keep going, and this is how he’ll keep going. He has a mission.
“Hey guys!” Dean shouts, and the people in the living room turn to look. “I brought Cas!”
Castiel nods sheepishly. “It was incredible,” he says, taking the lump of clothes out of his bag and unwrapping them until he reveals the jar of light.
Before John Winchester died, he owned a house, which was partially destroyed during the sixty-three raids and never rebuilt. It’s not much, but maybe there’s something there, something that can give Castiel answers, or at least help him decide if he should continue pursuing the Winchesters.
When did the world stop making sense?
“Wichita, Wichita,” Bobby mutters, staring off into space a minute. “Think that’s Tara’s stomping grounds.”
Castiel just glares.
Castiel watches Dean walk away and doesn’t say a word.
A few tense minutes pass before Castiel speaks again. “How did you know where I was? Or that I was in danger?”
The man’s eyes twitch, just barely. “I know em’. Got Sam’s nose all wrong there,” he says, tapping the poster.
“So the two of you just… travel through Kansas over and over, looking for new monsters to take care of?”
Eventually, the night ends. Several hunters leave with Donna, who apparently lives nearby in a similarly large house, while others bed down at Bobby’s. Castiel expects Sam to come back with him and Dean, but he doesn’t.
Castiel has nothing.
“May I ask you something?”
Dean seems determined to teach Castiel every bit of knowledge he can, from the best accelerant to use when burning bodies, to how to evade the lawmen that don’t take kindly to things like grave desecration and chopping the heads off seemingly human people.
“Singer said the same.”
Castiel tries hard not to speak, but the words so desperately want to come out. “Because I’m hoping that avenging my brother’s death will bring me peace.”
“I didn’t draw it,” Castiel says.
But that’s not Castiel’s favorite part.
Castiel does go home. He fetches his belongings from Naomi’s, then spends days riding Angel back to Wichita, back to the little one bedroom house he shared with Jimmy. It’s a tiny, shabby thing, but it was cheap, a good place to live while saving for somewhere better. Well, for Jimmy. Jimmy planned to ask a local schoolteacher to marry him someday. Amelia. Jimmy had planned to marry her, and for them to move into a nicer house together. Castiel had no such plans. He used to think it was because he wasn’t the marrying type, but eventually he realized he wasn’t the marrying
He rides Angel around the outskirts of Cherryvale, checking abandoned and poorly attended properties for any signs of vampires, and finds nothing. Over and over, he finds nothing. No blood, no corpses, no vampire. The sun will be getting low soon, and Castiel fully intends to be indoors when darkness falls. There’s an inn nearby that looks a little expensive, but hopefully is safe.
He circles the pile of rubble a few times before going to the pile itself and starts moving things around, kicking up clouds of dust as he goes. Any wood that survived the fire is rotten, there are certainly no documents, and there appears to be a surplus of spiders. The only interesting things Castiel finds is a burned metal chair frame that seems to be secured to the floor, and a cast iron pan, rusted and far too heavy to be worth taking. He sighs, standing at what he assumes is the back of the house and staring at the floor. This truly was pointless.
But if it were truly nonsense, Castiel would be standing up right now, and he’s not. He’s lying on the floor in the dark, listening to the crickets in the distance, wondering if he’ll ever move again. It hurts, this position. His back is going to ache something fierce in a few hours, surely. Still, there’s nothing he can do about it. He hums old hymns that his mother used to sing, wishing he could at the very least fall asleep.
The sketches are beautiful, in Castiel’s opinion. If Sam and Dean Winchester weren’t grave robbers, horse thieves, and murderers, Castiel would want to keep their wanted posters based on aesthetic value alone. Although, that would likely raise a few eyebrows. Still, perhaps when he catches the Winchesters, when he’s had his revenge, Castiel will have their posters framed as a trophy.
Dishonorable, perhaps, but Castiel is no lawman, and traveling all over Kansas isn’t cheap.
There’s a great deal of open space in the cemetery, which means Castiel has to fall even further back to avoid being seen. Sam and Dean walk to a newer looking part of the cemetery, pausing along the way to grab shovels from the maintenance shed. Knowing what will come next makes Castiel’s stomach turn.
“Town doctor said it looked like they’d lost a lot of blood, only there’s never much blood at the scene. They want to believe it’s a feral beast, but tell me, Deputy, when have you ever heard of a bear or coyote draining blood from its kill? None of them were torn to pieces, far as I know. Just one or two wounds, sometimes a broken neck. That sound like an animal to you?”
"Cas, there's so much I need to say to you. But right now ... Right now I just ..."
Dean rolls his eyes.
The air is punched out of Dean's lungs when he turns around. "Cas?"
"Cas, I ..."
Cas sighs, weary and defeated.
"… is that I like bees."
Dean had been breathless with relief.
"Yeah.  Now we're writing our own story, right?"
"Look, just hear me out … maybe …"
"Hello, Dean."
The open, earnest adoration in Cas' eyes had encouraged him to go further.
The corners of his eyes are crinkled. He's not amused by the joke, Dean knows, just absurdly pleased to be saying something he knows will make Dean happy. Of course Dean knows that Cas loves him, knows the whole cosmic-realm-crossing magnitude of it, but in little moments like this, he's floored by it. Dean can't help his sudden exhale or the massive grin that breaks across his face. He wraps his husband up in a hug that they hold for a good long moment, before Dean leans back to kiss Cas.
The lessons continue.
Castiel needs to go out.
“Maybe when I’m sure I can let you go back out in the world and not get yourself killed.”
“What’s enough?”
“Surely you were taught how rude it is to put filthy boots up on furniture,” Castiel says.
Castiel shakes his head vigorously. “I absolutely refuse to participate in any sibling rivalry,” he says, and walks out the door, leaving Dean to catch up after him.
“I’m a
“Cas, you don’t have to keep saying that.”
supernatural.”
“Cas, there’s more to life than studying and killing leprechauns.”
He turns his head. Dean is standing there, glaring. He’s wearing a red union suit, the kind of soft, one piece thermal bodywear Castiel used to sleep in as a child, but that makes him no less intimidating.
When night falls, Castiel opts to seek shelter at the local church. He’d rather spend a night uncomfortable in God’s house than risk sleeping outdoors, though if it were allowed he’d just curl up in a corner of Angel’s stable at the town’s livery.
There was a time when that wouldn’t have scared him at all, but now… well, if Castiel walks a bit
“Yeah. My dad said I was the exception, and I believed him for a long time. But a lot of supernatural beings are just… people that got dealt a bad hand.”
so he pulls the pale blue ankle-length garment over his head, so terribly pleased to no longer smell the various stenches of the road.
“I was thinking I’d stay here a while, actually, since Dean’s still using my bed.”
“Long list of grievances from the state, most recently the murder of a deputy. Are you sure you haven’t seen them recently, Mr. —”
“You can show that gratitude by not making fun of my clothes, then.”
“Can we talk about something else?” Sam says.
Still, there are some important things he’s able to glean, themes that appear over and over in the books and in his notes. Salt, iron, and holy water are essentials. Along with that, it’s important to have something that makes fire quickly, a sharp and long blade like a machete, a rosary, and a charm to prevent demonic possession.
“Three weeks ago.”
“I’m just trying to learn.”
Dean grunts in reply, but the ball of light disappears. “Yeah well you teach Cas about sirens and then we’ll ask him who’s better at it.”
This is Castiel’s favorite part of a hunt.
, can barely get out of bed.”
“The longer you hunt, the more likely it is that you’re going to do something that gets the attention of lawmen. That’s just how it is. Sammy and I are good at what we do and we still got on your brother’s radar. Sooner or later, you’re going to have your own wanted poster circulating. Can you live with that?”
As if on cue, Castiel’s stomach emits a loud, groan of hunger. Naomi
Castiel puts his hand over the woman’s the way people did for him when Jimmy died. “I am so sorry for your loss.”
Dean seems a bit scattered in response, and he quickly changes the subject to demons. He goes over the exorcism with Castiel and has him recite it over and over until he’s satisfied that Castiel has it perfectly memorized.
in the room. These are people that have seen the worst in the world, and still they have so much joy.
“There’ll be someone along soon enough to deal with it,” she says, wiping down her empty counter. She’s wearing jeans, which is something Castiel doesn’t see that often. “Until then, I’ll be keeping me and mine indoors at night, suggest you do the same.”
Wait, how did he get here?
“Hunter…”
It’s no matter. Castiel found them before, finding them with a literal list of the cities they visit will surely not be as difficult.
“I wasn’t making fun, I was merely—”
type.
Dean falls silent for nearly a minute. “It hasn’t been an imposition, Cas. I like having you around.”
It takes a long time to bring Dean to completion this way, and Castiel loves it; Dean’s innate impatience put through the wringer, the waiting, the longing, his moans… the fact that he never tries to make Castiel go faster. Dean is strong, powerful, zealous, but for Castiel he is vulnerable and tender.
“Shut up. And I know you stole that damn machete from me. And holy water. And a rosary, an anti-possession charm, my old zippo… you a kleptomaniac or something?”
He’s grinning at Dean. Dean’s staring at him.
It’s still dark when Castiel wakes. He’s not sure what woke him, but he knows he’s not alone. He rolls over onto his back. Dean’s sitting just a foot or two away, propped up against the tree, watching Castiel in the light of the moon.
The hardest part is not knowing if he’s wasting his time here or not. If he should be moving on, or if the Winchesters truly are hiding out here somewhere. Nine days. If the Winchesters have indeed moved on, their lead will be growing and growing. But Castiel doesn’t want to pick a random direction and hope he’s on the right path. No, that would be foolish.
Which is no good.
Castiel looks at Dean, who makes a scoffing sound and looks away. “I hate to impose, perhaps I should stay elsewhere so you can have your room back?”
Castiel finds himself tilting his head, as though he can understand Dean better if he simply looks at him from a different angle. “Meaning?”
“But you’re a witch.
Dean Winchester, in the flesh. Dean Winchester, who’s now staring at Castiel and looking incredibly alarmed.
“You wha—”
“I wanted to make sure you understood that hunting isn’t just death and killing and isolation. We’re a community, a family. We look after each other.”
“So… how is the town so loyal to you? When I was posing as a deputy, no one here would give you up, not even Naomi, who doesn’t seem to care for you at all.”
“Is that a double entendre?” Castiel replies lazily.
“It was another spell, okay? I cast a spell on you. Back at the church.”
“Uh huh.”
Castiel sits up to face Dean fully. “So… that’s what you and your brother do? You lay spirits to rest?”
“How do I fight something I can’t touch?”
“What about that other thing?”
He also knows, deep down, that Jimmy would not support Castiel avenging his death at all. Jimmy was the good, temperate brother, never a hand raised in anything other than defense of himself or others. He’d never spend months tracking two outlaws across Kansas just to shoot them in cold blood. He wouldn’t forgive and forget, but he wouldn’t do this either. He wouldn’t want this for Castiel.
Dean realises that he's moved his right arm around Cas' waist, so now Dean is wrapped around Cas like some kind of koala/octopus hybrid. An octoala? A koctopus? Definitely koctopus. Heh.
Dean is staring hopelessly into Cas' eyes as he leans in closer, and then Cas is lifting his chin and their lips are meeting and everything in the world is beautiful and perfect.
Jack is wandering around somewhere with Claire and Kaia. Jody and Donna are here, too, with Alex and Patience. Adam and Michael have probably partied their way through fifty international pride parades by now, but they should be meeting up with everyone else later. Sam and Eileen are not far away. Eileen was the one who'd slapped the bi pride sticker on Dean's chest - with unnecessary force, if you asked Dean. She'd grinned at him, showed off the identical sticker on her own chest, and said, with a suitably cheesy wink, "we need to stick together". He remembered the moment he'd nervously asked her the sign for 'bisexual', and when she'd shown him - the letter signs for 'b' and 'i' - she'd added, "me too," and Dean had scooped her up into a crushing hug. His love for his family is endless, and them all being here is definitely not why he's uncomfortable.
Dean had barked a laugh, which turned into a warm smile as Cas raised their joined hands up to his lips and kissed Dean's knuckles, eyes locked onto his the entire time.  Dean had mirrored the gesture, and then lowered their hands again to slow their pace, pull Cas to a halt, and reel him in for a kiss.
"We drink," Cas had announced, and steered Dean in the direction of the quiet little bar and its scattering of sun loungers.  Dean had grinned.  He'd married a goddamn genius.
"I'm on my honeymoon.  I'm allowed."
Eileen, Sam and Jack are smiling too, and their eyes are full of tears and love. They have drawn closer, so Dean and Cas part for long enough to exchange hugs with their family, before pulling them all in for a group hug.
Cas huffs a laugh, looks down, lifts the corner of his mouth into a wry smile and then looks back up into Dean's eyes.
"I love you, Cas." The words are softly said, almost into the other man's mouth.
Dean feels Cas' hand on his shoulder, and then it smooths over his back, finding the back of his neck underneath the boa. Whatever his shape, Cas' touch has the exact same effect on Dean. He looks up into the impossibly blue eyes of his husband.
And yes, through the following days he'd carried that love with him, together with Cas' words that had cut right to the bright, hard truth of him.  He'd realised that he, too, had something to say, and he'd pulled Cas out of that impossible nothingness and into his arms.  Together, with their whole found family, they'd fought for free will and for love.  One hack writer hadn't stood a chance against that.  But for that one desolate, concrete-cold moment he'd been utterly, hopelessly lost.
"I love you, too."  It's not a kneejerk reply or an automatic response.  It's a declaration spoken with soul-deep sincerity.
Suddenly, the blank page had seemed more like an open road.
"You think your outfit's lacking accessories?" he deadpans.
Right on cue, here's another one. From over his husband's shoulder, Dean levels his very best glare at the guy. It's a look that can stop a demon dead in its tracks. A vampire would tremble. A werewolf would wet itself. But one young gay guy with a few drinks in him? Totally unaffected. Like the others, he's all smiles and understanding when Cas politely, if awkwardly, waves him away. (Literally. With a final dorky little wave goodbye.)
"Wow," is his eloquent response.  The sun is setting, and the sea and sky are ablaze with colour.  He shifts up in the lounger to get a better view, and glances up at Cas' profile.
Dean has to bite his lip.  Cas is a picture of disgruntled misery in bed beside him, bundled in blankets with his face squashed adorably against the pillow.
Now, Dean sets down their glasses, and pokes and prods at Cas until he's lying on his back.  Cas offers an eye roll, but no resistance.  Dean settles down, leaning forward onto Cas, resting his head in the crook of Cas' neck.  It's how he'd woken up this morning in the beachfront cabin; it's how he's slept every night since Cas had been back from the Empty.
"Heh, yeah.  He was sneezing for hours."
"He couldn't do that, though, so instead he kept writing and rewriting. I need to fix the things he twisted. Amara's going to help me put things right. Then I'll let go of the Light - let it be in the world."
"It's not too late, Cas."
Dean has a moment to be astonished anew by the blue of them before Cas dips down to kiss him properly.  Cas' right hand reaches for Dean's left shoulder, where it lingers for a long moment before it moves up to cup his face, and Dean's left finds the skin at Cas' waist where his Hawaiian shirt had ridden up in the fall.  Like Dean's, the shirt was a wedding gift from Jack.  Dean's is patterned with palm fronds in purple, blue and pink, and Cas' is rainbow-coloured and emblazoned with hummingbirds (the closest thing to bees that Jack could find).  They're both wearing shorts, because, hey, they're on their honeymoon.
"I'd like a garden," had been Cas' admission.
Whether they thought the idea was beautifully sweet or completely cheesy, everyone attributed it to Cas.  It was, however, entirely Dean's design.  When Cas had asked why he'd chosen sunflowers, Dean had said, "you're my sunshine," before singing, grinning and slightly off-key, "and I want you to know that my feelings are true.  I really love you.  Ohhhh … you're my best friend."
Dean rests his left hand on Cas' chest.  Cas covers it with his right, before threading their fingers together.  His left hand sweeps up Dean's back and settles between his shoulder blades, hugging him closer.  Dean wriggles until he's perfectly comfortable, prompting another eye roll (that he can't see but can sense anyway).  He pulls their joined hands towards him and kisses Cas' knuckles.  Cas lifts them up to his lips and kisses Dean's fingers.  Dean dozes.
"But I never thought I'd ever live."
"I was thinking, you know, big windows to let the light in.  Room for Jack to live or visit or whatever he wants."
"... the only facet of my personality that they focus on … the single thing they go on and on about …"
Because making Cas happy?  Well, Dean would alter the fabric of the universe for that.
"You think Jack's gonna like it?"
"You're a very glittery," Cas begins, softly, "and very beautiful," one corner of his mouth lifts, and then he purses his lips together, trying to hold back the smile, "koctopus."
Their hands go still on the skin they've found, and for a while they just gaze into each others' eyes.  They're continuing a silent conversation that began in hell with a touch and on earth with a look.  Then, Cas leans over to grab the drinks, and they clink the glasses together before they drink.
"Dean. Of course that's what I want. I just never thought ..."
However, Dean also knows that Cas will be there to get him through it. Cas will remind him - as firmly as he'd rebuffed all of Dean's clown hiring attempts - that they're all here, and alive, and healing, and that they have all long since forgiven each other. Dean's always there to remind Cas of the same thing, after all.
"Wow," he agrees.  Cas answers Dean's slight tilt of his chin with a tender kiss to his lips before they snuggle in closer to watch the sunset.
He raises his eyes to Jack again, who is not making eye contact, but rather looking slightly to Dean's right. He feels Sam shift, squeeze his shoulder, then move away. He looks quizzically between Sam and Jack, until he follows the line of Jack's sight, turning to look over his shoulder.
Cas has only been gone for a few minutes, fetching fresh drinks, complete with brightly coloured umbrellas, from the beachside bar.  He'd placed them on the table beside Dean before bending down to kiss him.  Dean knows this, and also knows that maybe he's being just a little clingy.
"Oh.  Yeah, of course, if that's …"
"Do you think there actually might be an emergency clown callout number?"
"All those years fighting for free will, and now we finally have it … now we're really free … it's kinda terrifying, Cas."
Dean stills when he hears the distinctive flap and slap of an approaching ex-angel in flip-flops.  He feels a kiss pressed to his forehead, and smiles as a wave of warmth spreads through him.  It's a rush of love and affection and something else, too, which Dean realises is relief - the release of a breath he hadn't known he'd been holding, a knot of worry he wasn't aware of until it was washed away.
"Dean, we always have been."
"Wow," he can't help but say again.  Cas is gorgeous, haloed by the sunset's glow.
They were also both looking forward to hearing about Jack's weekend with Claire and the girls. On Friday, Claire had arrived in the Impala with Kaia, Alex and Patience to take Jack on a birthday road trip. Dean had insisted on near-constant text message updates ("Dean, it's good for him to spend time with kids his own age." "He's four, Cas.") so they'd seen the beach bonfire and the selfies at various landmarks (they may have covered a few more miles in a weekend than a car without a nephil passenger might usually), but they were still keen to hear about their adventures in person.
Cas looks down to see Dean, smiling, illuminated by the sky's rich reds and oranges and radiant with love and goodness.  He's seen galaxies burn in and out of being, but nothing will ever be as breathtakingly beautiful to him as Dean Winchester.
Dean's still staring up at the ceiling. Cas reaches out to brush a strand of hair from his husband's forehead, and places a kiss there. He cards his fingers through Dean's hair before gently turning Dean's face towards him until Dean is looking into his eyes.
Cas had nodded, giving Dean the reassurance he'd needed.  Dean and Cas hadn't actively hunted since Chuck's defeat, but they'd helped with research here and there.  Still, they hadn't actually discussed anything as final-sounding as retirement.
"Yeah, I really do."
Dean, lying on his back and looking up at the ceiling, continues to pout. Cas leans down to kiss him, because although Dean is infuriating, he's also adorable. Dean kisses back, because Cas is adorable, even though he's infuriating.
Dean realises that he is not only crying, but sobbing in a way that he's not sure he's ever done in front of anyone else before. He doesn't care. Cas is solid and warm and alive and in Dean's arms.
Dean had lifted their joined hands and gestured at the silver glinting in the sunlight.
That something turns out to be making a shelter for solitary bees out of bamboo canes.  Who, Dean wonders, is out there writing fanfiction about him and Cas building a "bee b&b"?
Cas' face is as tear-streaked as his own, his eyes red-rimmed and so, so blue.
He feels it now, black and burning, in the back of his throat.  So he holds on to his husband even tighter, reassuring himself that he's here and whole and human and alive.  He feels the rise and fall of his own breathing against Cas' chest and steadies it.  What's real?  We are.
They'd continued walking for a long while, spinning little tales of their possible plans.  Cas had suggested they open a charming B&B in Vermont, which had earned him a shove that sent him calf-deep into the water.  The ensuing brief, splashy skirmish had left them both helpless with laughter.
Dean rests in Cas' arms, remembering Mildred and her words of wisdom.  Now, more than ever, he wants to live a long and happy life.  Now, more than ever, he understands what he has to do.  He's going to follow his heart.
Sam and Dean hold their breath as slowly the background bustle of humanity replaces the stone dead silence left by Chuck.
Walking hand in hand with Cas, Dean's thoughts wander. Dean could kick his younger self for every time he'd called someone gay or a girl as a way of saying they were weak. Because all he can see in the people around him is strength. He grins again, giddy with the atmosphere of defiant joy. All around him is everything he'd spent his life fighting to protect: freedom, family, and love. Holding his husband's hand a little tighter, he's grateful that in the end he gets to have both: freedom and peace.
He smiles and raises a hand to wave. "I'll see you soon."
"You have me," Cas had said quietly.
"Aw, man."
It's selling cowboy hats in every configuration of colour imaginable, and Dean is practically jumping on the spot with excitement. Cas looks his husband up and down, slowly.
"Yeah.  Me too.  That sounds awesome, Cas."
"Dean, it's outrageous."  Cas looks irate.  Dean swallows.  Cas continues.
"Nevertheless, I am resigned to my fate.  And I have my revenge knowing that you are also stuck with me."
Cas had nodded or hummed his approval as Dean built their perfect house with words and the expressive movements of his left hand.  He'd gotten a little lost when Dean's plans for the kitchen became somewhat technical and incredibly detailed, but could only be endeared by his enthusiasm.
Cas closed his eyes and rested his chin on Dean’s head. “I will always be with you.”
“Cas,” he said, and, shit, his voice sounded rough. “Cas, I know you can’t hear me. I know you’re… you’re asleep. I hope it’s, I don’t know, tranquil or some shit. Look, I just need you to know that—that, well, I miss you. We all do. But, uh, I don’t know what would’ve happened if we talked about what you said, about how you felt, but I wish things were different, that I wasn’t so fucked up you didn’t think you could talk to me about it.”
“Jack’s away right now, trying to correct Chuck’s mistakes. He isn’t listening either,” Cas said.
Deirdre smiles, almost to herself, like she was playing out a private moment in her mind. “I know what you mean. Sometimes you meet someone new, and it just...clicks. It was like that with my partner too.”
, despite Cas having
Cas smiled to himself. “A bit more than that. As far as what happens next, however, I have no idea. He left rather quickly this morning.”
to know if Cas tasted like his smelled, and, Jesus fuck, he did. Dean kissed his way up Cas’s throat and felt his Adam’s apple purr beneath his tongue. He tasted so fucking
“They’re—they’re perfect. Fuck, Cas, you’re perfect.” Dean wiped at his eyes. “Shit, I don’t know why I’m crying.”
“What about this morning?” Charlie poked his ribs when he didn’t answer. “Well?”
Dean turns back to his drink.
“Do it.”
Dean pulled his knees to his chest, tucking his head between his knees. “You can’t just say shit like that, man.”
. An actual wing-having-full-of-grace angel. I’m just a guy.”
Cas slid his empty glass between his hands. “Is that what we are? We don’t have to be—”
Dean cleared his throat and looked at the table to avoid Sam’s eyes. “I know I—I loved him. He was the best friend I ever had; he was family. And, yeah, our relationship was a little different. There was something about him from the beginning. I’d never gotten that close to someone that fast before; trusted someone like that. He was a goddamn angel, so I thought maybe that’s what it was. Some kinda angelic attachment or whatever. But…”
“Deirdre.”
“My partner for a lot of years,” he continues. “Losing him was like losing...fuck. Like losing myself. I’m still lost.” He looks at Deirdre, her face swimming before him. “I feel so old, but, at the same time, feel too young to be…”
“You are exquisite,” Cas declared.
“I’m happy you like it.”
“Are you okay?”
Cas shoved Dean’s hand, but Dean’s other fist made contact with Cas’s cheek.
“Dean.”
in nothing for all of goddamn eternity!”
Cas slowly kissed his way down Dean’s chest and pecked at each nipple. How the fuck did Cas learn how to do that?
and He created the mountains and the sea and fire at the same time
Dean looked around and chuckled. “Dude, is this your room from the bunker?”
“And that
Sam sighed. “About Cas, about what happened. I think there’s something you’re not telling me—something big.”
“I won’t, I promise.” He took Charlie in his arms and kissed the top of her head. “Good to see you, nerd.”
“Shit, I’m sorry. You were very close?”
“Mmm, I can see that.”
Dean stepped closer to Cas so their shoulders touched. “No, you wouldn’t,” Dean said in a low voice.
Sam folded his hands on the table and took a deep breath. “Look, I’m not trying to make any assumptions or anything, only you know how you feel, but… Dean, come on, you two always had something different.”
“You okay now?” Sam asked.
In an instant, Cas was in front of him, eyes probing his actual soul. Gone was the gentle look from a moment ago, replaced with Cas’s stern smite-y face.
Cas smiled. “I am, Jack. I came here as soon as I could.”
“Jack!” Sam yelled. He looked at Cas with awe. “How?”
“And?”
He and Sam were still hunting, always hunting, but Dean felt more and more disconnected from that life. He didn’t feel obligated anymore to throw himself into the fray. He was looking forward to retirement, getting a real job, maybe having a life. A house. It was wild.
“But you’re an
when He created narcotics He was high
“I had to go,” Cas gasped.
“No…” John said.
“She didn’t—I told her—”
“You never cease to amaze me,” Cas said.
“Yes,” Cas said, his voice somehow rougher than usual, “I prepared you with my grace, I hope that is alright as we both seem somewhat impatient.”
“What could you have done?” Cas’s voice rose, matching Dean’s volume. “Blame yourself? Tell me you didn’t want what I wanted, make sure I was never,
“Sweetheart,” Dean wheezed, “you gotta stop. I wanna come with you inside me, and you’re gonna—”
. Dean hadn’t expected this level of confidence. Cas toed off his shoes and socks, then sipped out of his slacks and underwear. Dean absently palmed the front of his jeans. Cas was completely naked.
He wiped the tears that finally drained from his eyes. “I know, I know, I’m friggin’ special.” He huffed a laugh. “You changed me too, man. And what you told me, when you fucking
“What you said when you summoned the Empty…” Dean began. “You, uh, you meant it?”
Flowers finally opened inside him with every moment, look, smile, and general world-saving he shared with Dean. His time with Sam was important as well; Cas experienced true friendship in a very human way with the younger brother. They cared for each other while expecting little in return. He loved Sam, but it remained different with Dean. Cas’s Father was gone, but his relationship with Dean lent itself to that feeling of certainty and contentment he hadn’t felt since God was in Heaven. And yet… and yet, Dean wasn’t completely safe. He was volatile and raw, and their friendship always felt on the precipice of something new, be it a loss because their faith in each other wavered, or a gain if Dean might—somehow—feel the same for Cas.
Jack would be back from Jody's in the morning. Dean had taken advantage of Jack's absence and the space at the lakehouse to organise a few things for the party. Dean hadn't gone overboard or anything. There were a few balloons, and a little bunting. And some string lights. And a cotton candy machine, and a coconut shy, and, yes, all right, a bouncy castle. Okay, so it looked like an entire fairground had set up on the banks of the lake. Dean couldn't wait to see Jack's face when he saw it, and neither could Cas.
"I just need him to know."
"I was an angel, an instrument of God's word, and yet I defied his will and tore up his script.  And I did it - all of it - for you.  Our love altered the fabric of the universe, Dean.  And yet I am to be remembered above all else for my fondness for insects."
Dean chokes.
"Hell yeah," Dean had replied, and his talk of wildflowers and raised beds and vegetable patches and potting sheds ("which you're not getting me anywhere near, Cas, because those things are like Woodstock for spiders,") told him that Dean had given just as much thought to Cas' garden as he had to his kitchen.
They end up standing in a row, Eileen, Sam, Jack, Dean and Castiel, facing the road ahead with their arms around each other's shoulders.
Cas narrows his eyes further and tilts his head to the side.
Dean had squeezed back, and said softly, "yeah.  You have me, too, Cas."
It's still there, the ache and the taste of despair.  How many times had he lost Cas?  How many times had it wrecked him?  And how much worse had it been, that last time, when he'd finally understood the depth of his loss?  When he'd heard his own silent yearning spoken aloud in Cas' words?  When he'd been left with Cas' love, but not Cas?
"I swear, Jack, I didn't know. I couldn't imagine it. Hell, I couldn't imagine anyone ... let alone ..." Dean blinks away tears, swallows again. "I could never imagine he felt the same way."
Dean really should rest. Jack would be arriving with the whole Sioux Falls contingent, including Jody and Donna, plus Amara, and Sam and Eileen would be bringing several of Jack's hunter friends with them from the bunker. Adam and Michael would be there too, but at least they were technically only one mouth to feed. The birthday cake's baked and the various food stands (complete with veggie options) are good to go, but Dean wonders if he has time to make just one more pie.
"Thank you, Jack," Cas says, but Dean can only nod into Cas' shoulder. He should say more, he knows. He can't. He steadies himself, lifts out of the hug a little so he can turn and nod at Jack. Cas keeps his arms wrapped around Dean's waist.
"This is your shirt, Dean."
It's not the two flags that are padding the pockets of his jeans. One, he'd bought for Cas: it's striped in pale pink, pale blue and white. Earlier, he'd gone with Cas when he'd met up with some friends he'd met online (having managed to get past all the cats this time). The ex-angel had found that discussing their experiences of being trans had helped him feel happy in the body that had become his own. Dean could only feel immense gratitude for the way Cas' face had lit up afterwards when he'd talked about how he was creating himself, becoming himself, and embracing the human condition of change.
Cas' groan is lost to the noise of the crowd and the beat of the music, so no-one will ever know if it was one of protest or defeat. He does, in fact, end up wearing a black cowboy hat with a rainbow band, so if it was protest then it was highly ineffective. Dean's has a pink crown, purple band and blue brim, and he's carrying another black one with a band in the non-binary flag colours for Jack. Cas admits that Jack's going to love it.
Then they had walked on together, spilling all the little secret wants and wishes they'd hoarded in their hearts into that space between the land and the sea.  Dean had spoken about his hopes and dreams for Sam, too.
"I want to build us a house," Dean had admitted.  He'd gazed down at the sand, nervous of Cas' reaction.
"It's okay, Dean." Cas' voice is a fractured, trembling, still beautiful, thing. "You don't have to say anything. I heard you."
"I love you, Dean."
Cas does concede that the art and literature is surprisingly passionate.  Dean is excited, then, when Cas comes to him one day, nervous and shy, and says he wants to try something that he's read about in fanfiction.
And, huh, Dean had thought.  Cas is right.
"I'm holding his power, for now. He made all this, but he wanted to be a writer, not a father. I learned from my mother, and from Cas, and from you, that all he really needed to do was love his creation.
Dean looks around in awe. "You did it, Jack!"
Jack's smile fades and he opens his mouth to speak, but Dean cuts him off.
"I battled through hell to raise your soul.  I rebelled against the forces of heaven.  I … I made mistakes, but I always tried to do the right thing.  I became a father.  And yet the overwhelming theme … the only subject they care about …"
"Dean, do you know that fans of the Supernatural books write stories about us?"
"Try to get some rest, Dean. It's going to be a busy day tomorrow."
Dean runs soothing hands over his husband's arms, shoulders and back.  Cas melts into him.  Dean kisses the top of Cas' head and holds him closer.
Dean's opening his mouth to protest again, but Cas is shifting in the bed beside him, turning onto his side and propping himself up on his arm to gaze down at his husband.
"Yeah, Cas?"
"Yeah?  Okay, and space for anyone who wants to visit.  Somewhere not too far away from Lebanon or Sioux Falls.  Projector in the living room for movie nights.  Barbecue out back.  Ooh, and a deck."
"I never thought I'd get married.  Never even thought I'd live this long."
"Nice work, kid." Amara smiles before drawing him into a hug. "See you soon." She nods at Sam and Dean before vanishing.
He does sound a little sorry now, but his future laundry woes are forgotten when Cas presses another kiss to his pouting lips. They're forgotten again when something across the crowd catches Dean's eye.
The internet has far too many cats for Cas' taste.  One day he stumbles upon something he finds even more unsettling.
"C'mere, Cas."
"I believe they're also setting up a supply system for vampires and werewolves who want to live without killing, so they'll have easy access to blood or animal hearts."
"In that case … what do we do now?"
"Mmm?"
Dean continues to hold Cas' face; Cas' hand moves back down Dean's neck before gripping his right shoulder. Dean's laugh is half bark and half breath; they can't stop smiling and the tears won't stop falling. Cas is holding on as if he may never let go. Dean really doesn't want him to.
Dean's at Pride, and feeling a rising level of discomfort.
"You threw the bouquet at his face, Dean.  I'm pretty sure everyone knows that."
"Damn it, Cas.  You can't just say things like that."  There had not been any tears in Dean's eyes at this point.  Absolutely none.
It takes someone wolf-whistling for them to part, and then they're back to grinning and staring into each others' eyes, until Dean spots something on Cas' face. And something else. And something else. In fact, there's something all over Cas, and that something is gold glitter. It's on his face, his hands, his Zeppelin shirt, and even in his hair. Dean runs his fingers through the unruly curls - Cas has been wearing his hair longer lately - in an attempt to shake it out, but only deposits more glitter into Cas' locks.
And it's not the body glitter freckling his cheeks and his shoulders with gold, although his feelings might change by the time he tries to remove it tonight. He'd been gilded with it when he'd been dancing up a storm with a group of drag queens. They'd admired his eyeliner - a deep brown shot through with gold along his upper lashes - but winked and said it was "a little subtle for Pride". As soon as Dean had seen the tube of glitter, he'd yelled "hell yes!" and even managed to hold still long enough to be coated in the stuff before moving his body to the beat again. Although he's sure his feet will be aching later, so far his favourite cowboy boots are not the source of his discomfort.
It's not like Dean can blame them. Cas' muscular frame is wrapped in black jeans and a tight black t-shirt bearing the Led Zeppelin 1975 tour logo. The short sleeves show off the floral tattoos trailing down his left arm. Cas is wearing a rainbow-coloured enamel belt buckle and, because he's determined to be the death of Dean, black cowboy boots. Before they'd left, Dean hadn't been able to resist grabbing a black kohl pencil and smudging a little along Cas' upper and lower lashes. And, okay, maybe Cas' wide-eyed bewilderment every time he's flirted with is vaguely amusing. But when Dean is right here? Not cool.
Dean hopes that the gift of the trans pride flag will show Cas that Dean understands and loves him, and the same is true for the other flag, which he'd picked up for Jack. It's yellow, white, purple and black. Dean had had to do a little research when Jack had used the term non-binary - it's amazing how the world can move on while you're living in an underground bunker. He'd kept on researching, too, after he'd learned the basics. Maybe he was still figuring himself out. Maybe there was more to discover about himself, and wasn't that fantastic?
"Oooh," Dean exclaims as he drags Cas towards the stall he's spotted.
Cas looks at Dean with a smile that begins as wry, then shifts into astonished joy. "I guess we just make it up as we go."
"Yeah, and they've got a good thing going back at the bunker.  Training up new hunters, building up the network.  Eileen still likes getting out there and kicking ass, but Sam's becoming more like Bobby.  He's got everything under control, don't you think?"
Before their words could kick up a black cloud of painful memories, like their feet in the water stirring up silt, Dean had spoken a little louder.
"Dean, it's past midnight and the party's tomorrow. Unless there's some kind of emergency clown callout number, it's not happening. Just accept it."
"Koctopus?" Dean says, apologetically.
"And that they produce artwork?  A great deal of incredibly detailed artwork?"
"Now there's something else I need to do."
"What do we do now?" Dean ventures.
"Please, Jack." He pauses, swallows, then continues with eyes downcast. "When Cas summoned the Empty, he told me..." Dean looks up, makes eye contact with Jack. "He told me that he loved me."
"Eileen's fantastic.  Man, I really want her to be my sister-in-law.  Do you think Sam knows that?"
It's not the big, heart-shaped sticker slapped on his chest, which is striped in the colours of the bisexual pride flag in a way that's much less subtle than the flannel. Dean's always known that he wasn't only into chicks, but putting a name to it is new. Dean's had jobs and Dean's had roles, but having an identity had always seemed like a luxury well beyond Dean's means. Now he's not constantly running for his life, though, he has the breathing room to figure himself out. And he's good with this part of himself. More than good.
Cas can sense it too, this ink-black blot in their cloudless sky.  He chases it away with quick, ticklish kisses pressed to Dean's cheek, and jaw, and neck, and collarbone.  Dean laughs and shuffles over a little, manoeuvring Cas until he's lying on his side.  Although perhaps not designed for more than one muscular, six-foot-something man, the dark wood lounger is sturdy and wide and just fine for two lovers who had long ago abandoned the concept of personal space.
"Dean, I may have existed for millennia, but I didn't start living until I met you.  I was never supposed to want anything.  I was supposed to be an instrument of God's will.  I doubted.  I questioned.  But you made me want.  You made me feel.  You made me human.  And I am happier than I ever thought possible to be sharing this human life with you."
"Um … yeah.  Those fans have pretty vivid imaginations, huh?"
Cas had raised an eyebrow.
Cas shifts so he's lying on his back again, and lowers his hand to Dean's shoulder to pull him along. Dean rests his head on Cas' chest and wraps his arm around his waist, snuggling in to the human warmth of him. Slowly, Cas strokes his other hand up Dean's back, hugging him close.
"It's going to be wonderful," Cas whispers, and Dean knows he's talking about more than the party.
Dean snorts at the thought, which is somewhat unfortunate, given that his face is right next to Cas' ear. Cas flinches and turns his head around to fix him in a squinty glare.
The flight was a gift from Jack, too: a quick zap now that his nephilim grace had been restored alongside his human soul.  Dean was infinitely grateful that there had been no planes required.  He didn't face down heaven and hell and his own self loathing and God himself only to have his life snuffed out by a lousy bit of rusty metal, thank you very much.
And once the little bee house is secured in a sunny spot, protected from the rain and close to the wildflowers Cas loves to grow, Dean has to admit that it's kind of cute.  And seeing Cas smile brightens Dean's world like nothing else can.
Dean sighs. Cas kisses him again.
Only a few paces separate them. Caught in that same inescapable gravity that has always drawn them together, they step forward and clap their arms around each other.
Before them was a wondrous thing that they'd never thought they'd have: a future.  For all the giddy joy of endless possibilities, however, there was also the imperious horror of a stark, white page.
"That sounds wonderful, Dean."
"I love you," Dean says, when they eventually part, because he can, because he's come to feel the happiness of saying it, and because he doesn't want Cas to go a moment without knowing that he's loved.
"Heh. Me neither." Dean leans in to Cas' embrace again. "I guess we really are a couple of dumbasses."
"Hey, husband," Dean grins at Cas.
It wasn't technically a bouquet, but the arrangement of miniature sunflowers had served its purpose.  The entire barn had been decked with sunflowers.  After the ceremony, the large sunflower heads had been placed into brown paper bags printed with instructions on drying and planting the seeds, and given to the guests.  The less settled hunters were encouraged to plant them by the roadside wherever they happened to wander.
"Well, I always thought that my lifespan would be significantly longer," Cas had deadpanned.
A little while later, Cas gently kisses the top of Dean's head and murmurs, "Dean, look at the sky," into his hair.  Dean lifts his head, reluctantly, and rubs at his eyes with the back of his hand.  He looks up, and is stunned by what he sees.
Dean gently prizes the blankets from Cas' curled fingers, and coaxes him into a hug.  Cas addresses his plaintive complaints to the hollow of Dean's throat.
Dean becomes aware that Sam has moved closer, and has put an arm around him. Dean leans in to Sam's side and wipes the tears from his face.
It's not the fact that he's wearing eyeliner in public for the first time in his forty-two years. Hell, he'd been wanting to do that ever since he was a kid, dreaming of being a rock star. The covers of music magazines in gas station racks had been windows on a world free from the brutally narrow definition of what his Dad meant when he told him to "be a man". Gradually, though, he'd learned what is gloriously apparent today under the hot June sun: that there are as many ways of being a man as there are men.
Cas had basked in his memories - of that moment, of them playing the Queen song later in the Impala, of the barn full of vibrant yellow - before Dean's sigh had brought him back to the beach.
The angle is awkward.  Cas loses his balance, one flip-flop, and a small amount of dignity, and he topples over.  Luckily there's space for Cas' knees to land on either side of the leg of Dean's that's still on the lounger, and his hands bracket Dean's grinning face.  Dean keeps hugging, hauling Cas down on top of him.  He can feel as much as hear Cas chuckling, a sensation that intensifies as Dean flings his other leg up over Cas, trapping him.
"I mean, look, you're stuck with me now."
They had wrapped their arms around each other and swayed a little as they hugged, and then Cas had grinned wickedly and whirled Dean into the ballroom hold they'd practiced so diligently for their first dance.  Their steps had been a little less precise than they'd been at their wedding, hindered as they were by flip-flops, and sand, and the sloshing of shallow waves, but their bodies had moved together beautifully as they'd danced on the shoreline.
The delicious press of Cas' lips and the taste of sunscreen and fruit juice pulls him back into the moment.  Cas feels the silver band on Dean's hand pressed against his flesh, pinning him to the present.  What's real?  We are.  Side by side, with legs entwined, they bask in brilliant sunshine and blissful kisses.
"Oops," Dean says, "I kinda glitter bombed you there. It's all over your shirt, too. Sorry, Sunshine."
"I just want him to be happy, you know?"
The kiss only ends when it's interrupted, inevitably, by the sound of a moose clearing its throat. Dean should glare at his brother, but he can't break away from Cas' eyes, so blue and wide and earnest.
Dean's eyes fall closed; he feels Cas' arms surrounding him, pulling him impossibly closer. Dean releases the handful of trenchcoat he's clutching to splay his left hand flat between Cas' shoulder blades. Cas moves his right hand around Dean's waist and up Dean's chest; he lingers over Dean's heart, then continues up his neck until his fingers find the short hairs at the back of his head and his thumb rubs the stubble of Dean's jaw.
He doesn't sound terribly sorry.
"Yes, Dean." Jack smiles serenely.
"No, Dean. I'm sorry."
Dean's thoughts turn to Jack, Sam and Eileen back at the bunker, and to Claire, Kaia, Jody and everybody in Sioux Falls.  He's so proud of every one of them.  They'll all have to come out here soon for a family holiday, he decides.  Not just yet, though.
Dean splutters a little more.  Once he gets his breath back, he manages to look at Cas.
"Yeah?"
Cas had sighed, loudly and with a theatrical flourish.  "I suppose you're right," he'd said, as if it had only just occurred to him.
It's not the bright pink feather boa, either, which he'd acquired from the same source as the glitter, when he'd been sent off with a kiss to the cheek and the words "be bold, honey!" He'd expected the boa to tickle or irritate, but for some bizarre reason the sensation of feathers around his shoulders and the back of his neck feels incredibly comforting and reassuring. He feels warm and safe and oh. Oh.
“What we call ourselves.”
There’s a light.
“Got a mission to get to,” Castiel says.
“Ma’am I assure you I have no want for your silver, nor your virtue.”
“Well, then, I’ll leave you to it. Hope you’ll be in the mood for mutton, later.”
Over two weeks pass.
“Yeah, we got her.”
Castiel groans, dazed. Dean’s straddled him, and Castiel can’t see his gun anywhere. He thrashes about, trying to knock Dean free, but then Dean produces a small, silver dagger from his coat.
“Whatever you say, man,” Dean says. He shifts until his knee is pinning Castiel’s right arm, and he picks up Castiel’s left, holding the blade against his skin. He frowns, and Castiel winces as he makes a small cut. “Ain’t a ghoul, wraith, shifter…”
They don’t say anything, they just grin at each other, then down at Castiel before going in for the attack. One at his neck, one at each of his wrists. They bite down and the pain is intense, the smell of blood thick in the air. He struggles and grunts in pain, but there’s nothing he can do.
“Bullets too? You found the cellar?”
(Four months later)
“Yeah, well I can’t let you do that neither. Go home, Deputy.”
Their destination apparently is a large house toward the edge of town, just off the main drag. Dean walks in without knocking, which seems rude, and he grabs Castiel’s hand to pull him along inside. Castiel mourns the contact the instant he lets go.
“Far, yeah. You’re
He was so sure he would find them here. Leavenworth was the first time he’d heard “they passed through here a couple days ago” instead of “they passed through here a few weeks ago”.
“He came to you? Gave himself up?”
The lore also says vampires will eschew the sun unless absolutely necessary, as it causes significant pain. Sunlight is not known to kill them, however, and the best way to kill a vampire is to sever the head.
Castiel picks the journal back up and starts flipping through pages, whining with dismay when Dean yanks it out of his hand. “Get some shoes on, we’re going out.”
Castiel nods slowly. God help him, he believes Dean. “So it’s your… job?”
The old Winchester house is at the far edge of town, where there are fewer houses and more untamed meadows and fields. The house is off the main road, and the moment Castiel gets close enough to see it, his hopes of finding answers disappear. Evidently, “partially destroyed” was a severe understatement. It’s rubble, covered in dust and weeds. Charred bricks and wood, scraps of unrecognizable metal. Even the soil closest to the house seems barren. This is a bit confusing. No one of prominence lived here, it’s not in an important location, why was it so thoroughly destroyed? From what Castiel knows about the sixty-three raids, referred to as “The Lawrence Massacre” by locals, a home like this wouldn’t have been a target at all.
Castiel nods slowly. “I hate to be indelicate, but is there anything else you can tell me about the way your husband and the others died?”
Curious.
The third day Castiel is home, he packs some clothes, supplies, and his jar of light, then he gets Angel and leaves for Concordia.
A secret Jimmy promised to take to his grave, which Castiel supposes he did.
Most of all, though, Castiel simply likes that it makes him feel closer to his brother.
“Like magical jars of light, and fresh air in an unventilated cellar?”
“If you expect me to beg for my life, you’ll be disappointed,” Castiel growls.
Castiel looks from the apparition to Dean. “What in the world is this?”
“Is there such a thing as a
“Safer to hunt with me and Sammy,” Dean mutters. He seems like he’s closer, maybe Castiel is imagining it.
Tomorrow. Castiel will deal with it tomorrow. For now, he puts a heavy coat over the light jar, curls up on his bed, and thinks about ghosts and Dean Winchester until he falls asleep.
“Are they… animal attacks?” Castiel asks, hoping he sounds sympathetic rather than eager.
“Sorry, I think there was a rock,” Castiel mumbles.
“That’s disgusting.”
After half an hour Castiel returns to Naomi’s homestead, feeling no better, though at least worn enough to finally get to sleep. He opens the door to his room behind Naomi’s house, and he freezes.
Cas pulled back and searched Dean’s eyes. “What happened?” Cas asked in alarm. “Why are you here so soon? You shouldn't be.”
It looked like Sam wanted to say something more, but Dean hustled out of the kitchen to his bedroom. Usually, this was the time he’d smash something, but Dean didn’t have it in him. He was just so goddamn tired. So wrung out, so—ha!—empty. He sat on the edge of the bed, elbows on his knees.
Miracle whined, and Dean slid from the car to sit on the ground next to the dog. “I’m sorry, buddy,” Dean told him. “I just miss my friend. You guys would’ve loved each other; he was always into animals. He was the best.” He nuzzled his nose in Miracle’s fur. “The best.” His voice cracked.
“Human?”
“Fuck me for what?” Cas asked, boxing Dean’s ear. “For loving you? For rebelling for you? I’m
“More,” Dean whined.
Cas left. It was terrifying, standing on a cliff and not knowing what the fall would feel like, if he would land. But… Cas had wings. What if it worked? What if it was okay?
"Nothing," Cas covered quickly, ignoring Dean's suspicious glare. "But if you knew, why didn't you say anything?"
too. Dean would cart up load after load of Cas's favorite foods and they'd eat them together, Cas taking the lion's share. But Dean wasn't exactly a slacker, and between Thanksgiving and Christmas and now this, Cas noticed that Dean's chubby belly had gotten a little chubbier, that he wore his belt looser, that his belly button was visible through his tight t-shirts. And on Sunday night, if Dean had to pry open his jeans after their day-long (four day long, really) binge, and if his thick belly rolled over his fly, newly lined with a couple stretch marks, Cas only loved him more for it.
The next day, he got two sizes up in his usual brand of slacks — thirty-eights instead of his usual thirty-fours, just to be sure they’d fit, not because the thirty-sixes had been a little snug around his middle, definitely not. Dean felt a lot better once he could pull the waistband of his pants over his pudge again. And if they also hid the love handles he’d noticed growing at his sides, well, that was his business.
Then Dean seems to be physically thrown from the grave. Castiel drops his pack and moves closer. Something is standing next to Dean’s crumpled form, a man that Castiel is
Threats of hexes or not, he’s going to learn everything he can from the books in the Winchester cellar and try again.
“And I did it
was in your bed,” Castiel says.
Dean lifts Castiel with a grunt, and Castiel is horrified and amazed to realize that his legs and arms remain outstretched as though he were still on the floor.
“He was my twin.”
“It’s easier for dark witches, all they gotta do is channel demonic energy.” Dean stands up and starts pacing. Castiel sees that the long underwear do indeed have a flap on the back. “Me, I don’t have that to draw from. I had to do two portal spells, I had to heal your god damn dying ass, that’s a lot of magic to do in a day, I’m
