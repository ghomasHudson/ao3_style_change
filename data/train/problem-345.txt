“Oh don’t worry, there’s all sorts round here. Victor—”
“You won’t cock it up,” he said softly. “I won’t let you.”
“This is much better,” John whispered, before bending to kiss Sherlock again. This time, it wasn’t as fevered, or as vicious of a kiss. He kissed Sherlock slowly, his tongue dipping in a rhythm that felt like sex–at least, how Sherlock imagined sex would feel. His barely-there beard was scratching Sherlock’s face, but Sherlock loved it, he wanted
“Happy Christmas, Sherlock,” John murmured, feeling warm and completely content.
“If you want Sherlock Holmes to live, get in the car.” The voice was more stern this time.
John closed his eyes, turning his head slightly to the side, saying nothing. Of course, Chi had been right. He’d given up.
“I’m sorry, just a moment, sorry,” John stuttered, holding up his hands in a conciliatory gesture. “We’re with the police. Sort of.”
“What are you doing?” John blurted out, stopping short.
John bit back a retort, waiting for him to finish.
“Even though you didn’t come?”
Sherlock let the silence stretch out for a moment, then nodded.
“More of the same kind of three or four letter combinations, with numbers,” Sherlock said. “They almost look like…”
“It’s alright,” John said softly, reaching over to stroke Sherlock’s hair. “You don’t have to explain.”
“Er…” John cleared his throat. “Maybe the killer got rid of it wherever he murdered her?”
“A thousand?” John asked, aiming for glib.
Sherlock looked distraught and frustrated, and somehow even more beautiful than he’d ever seemed before—pale cheeks flushed, hair windblown from running. Watching him, John felt lightheaded, but more exhilarated than he’d felt in ages.
John glanced up and down the street, but there was no one in sight. He didn’t actually believe that Sherlock’s life was in danger, yet he couldn’t bring himself to take the chance.
Sherlock huffed out a laugh. “Maybe more.”
John watched him for a moment, trying to make sense of what Sherlock had been saying, and finally he realized: Sherlock had tried to take him on a
He went the long way to the shop, walking through the street fair where people were selling Christmas-y goods. There was even a group of carol singers dressed in Victorian garb, holding candles that glowed in the gathering dark. He walked through the crowd, the smell of hot cocoa wafting through the air, watching people bustling about, on the way to see their loved ones.
He leaned back against the door, sighing. The mistletoe shouldn’t make him so angry; it was a stupid tradition, anyway. Who said that you had to kiss someone just because they were standing underneath a plant?
“Can’t say I have.”
“You’re very loyal, very quickly.”
“Everything alright with the room?” John asked, as the doors slid closed.
“Shit,” he cursed under his breath. He stood quickly, rubbing his eyes as he strode back over to the bed. The compress had slid off Sherlock’s face in his sleep, and his black eye had bloomed spectacularly into deep purple. There were other dark splotches all over his cheekbones.
“Why did you call me, then?” Sherlock said in an affectedly bored voice.
John chewed at his bottom lip. “I fantasized about you about a thousand times, too.”
Sherlock glanced at him, a bit of flush coloring his cheeks. “You think so?”
John helped Sherlock up the stairs and to his room, shrugging him out of his shoes and coat. He found some alcohol in the kitchen cupboard and cleaned the lacerations on Sherlock’s face as best he could. One of Sherlock’s eyes was already so swollen that he could barely open it, so John created a cold compress using a flannel.
Sherlock fidgeted. “Should I...?”
Sherlock shook his head, his face going hot. He hadn’t actually planned on telling John about that.
“You’ve been drinking, you—”
Sherlock snorted in derision. “I told you, they think Carl died of natural causes and we have no actual proof to the contrary.”
They’d had this same argument over and over again, and John would never stop torturing himself over things he’d had no control over. Wanting to stop the words from leaving John’s mouth, and the emotion behind them, Sherlock leaned in to capture John’s mouth with his own.
“Ahhh,” Sherlock moaned, arching up into John.
“P-people d-do little else,” Sherlock said, his expression inscrutable.
Not wanting to press the issue while Sherlock was concussed, John dropped it. He helped Sherlock into the taxi, and he immediately rested his head against the glass of the window.
“Bastard,” John gasped, and Sherlock grinned even wider, clenching his cheeks together so that John had even more friction around his cock.
“As I said,” Sherlock said slowly, looking irritated, “do what you normally do during games.”
“Wow, I didn’t think you would actually come. If you don’t mind me asking, is that man behind you Dr. Watson?”
John stared at him in surprise for a moment, then moved back up to settle between Sherlock’s legs. “You mean… you planned this? Even the king sized bed?"
fine,” John said, putting a bit more venom behind his words than was really necessary. Sherlock simply raised his eyebrows again.
“If we have the trainers, we can prove—” Sherlock froze, his eyes focusing on a taxi about a block ahead of them.  “Of course!"
Once he came even with Sherlock, he bowed to his curiosity and asked, “How did you know all that about me?”
The tall man walked over to loom over John in a manner that was probably supposed to be intimidating.
She looked down at John, raising an eyebrow. “Who’re you?” she asked incredulously.
That left only one explanation.
“Gifts?” Molly said, holding up a bag.
Once he was completely inside, John stilled completely, and leaned down to suck at Sherlock’s neck. “This is what you wanted, isn’t it?” His voice had a hard edge to it, the kind it had when he was about to shag Sherlock into the mattress. Which was just fine with Sherlock.
Sherlock paused in his work, glancing up at John with a confused expression. “
“Bye-bye,” Sherlock said over his shoulder, pouring two glasses of the wine.
“Work, unfortunately,” John said, not even trying to correct her about their relationship. Sherlock never had, even in the early years. For what felt like the thousandth time, John couldn’t help wondering what that meant.
“No, it wasn’t a dream,” he whispered, and he leaned inward to capture Sherlock’s lips in a kiss.
Sherlock eventually opened his eyes, looking directly at John. His surroundings melted away, and it was as if the two of them were the only ones in the room, as if Sherlock were playing just for him. His eyes were mesmerizingly dark and stormy grey, and his pupils were wide in the dim light. His pale skin was ethereal, contrasting with the wine silk shirt, and his body shifted, moving lithely with the music.
“I’m right here,” John said, smoothing his hand over Sherlock’s forehead, pushing the sticky curls upward.
They circled around one of the pillars of the bridge toward a group of people who were standing around what had to be the body.
John must have fallen asleep, because he woke up with his head at an awkward angle against the headboard and dawn breaking in his window. He sat up, wincing and rubbing his neck, but he froze as he saw that Sherlock was lying on the bed next to him, fully clothed and over the covers. He was staring at the ceiling, his hands folded over his lap, as if he had no idea that it was abnormal behavior for two flatmates to lay in bed together. John frowned, about to say something, when he noticed a cup of steaming tea on his bedstand. John glanced over at Sherlock, who was still very carefully staring at the ceiling.
“Mr. Hatayama,” John said, trying to keep the crushing, albeit ridiculous, disappointment from entering his expression. “Please, please come in,” John said, standing back to let him in.
“I am,” John said, tucking his chin into his neck and smiling. “I just wanted to tell you that I kept my promise. I finished a thousand.”
“It’s not?”
Sherlock pushed off the ledge, walking closer to John.
He let his hips shift into it, fucking upward gently as Sherlock came down. It had been so long since he’d had another man doing this, he forgot how good it could be. It obviously wasn’t Sherlock’s first time, and John was already embarrassingly close to coming.
He slid his arms around Sherlock’s waist, and Sherlock tilted his head down until their lips met again.
The silence in the room was punctured only by the soft beeping of her heart rate monitor. The trees beyond the window started to sway back and forth in the darkness, as if a storm was coming. John blinked, looking at them. He had been in the hospital so long that he had forgotten whether it was day or night. He had no idea how long they stayed that way, not speaking, but it felt like a long time, suspended in time as his entire life had been for more than a year.
“It’s what you really want.”
Sherlock seemed not to notice, thoroughly engrossed by eating his hot dog.
John laughed, pretending to be good-natured. “Oh, definitely.”
“They’ll be here in three hours, you know,” John said.
He pressed their hips together, feeling Sherlock against him, but he was very aware that Rosie was in the crib next to them and though he didn’t want to stop, he couldn’t do—
The man watched him carefully. “It’s not a difficult deduction to make.”
Sherlock tried to pull his hand away. “If you don’t want–”
“Bed?” John raised an eyebrow. Sherlock nodded eagerly.
“Understatement.”
“Yes,
The next day, John went to a local paper store and bought several hundred sheets of origami paper.
“I’m sorry for all I put you through.” John’s tone was laced with a trace of sadness.
“Yes, but I could never afford this place.”
John burst into laughter, and he saw Sherlock’s mouth slide upward into what could almost be a grin, but it looked awkward, as if he were unused to the motion. They walked up to a Victorian flat which looked much too expensive for a student to afford. Sherlock fished in his pockets for his keys. “So was I right?”
He waited, looking at the line of Sherlock’s shoulders against the dark sky beyond the window, the fire crackling in the background.
John held him like he was a precious thing, and Sherlock felt himself falling apart at the same time that he was being put back together. They stayed like that for a long time, what felt like an endless, slow fuck, Sherlock’s favourite kind, even if it was torture. John brought him to the edge over and over again, pulling back just enough that he didn’t come, while fluttering kisses over his face and neck. John had always been a driving force in his life, and in bed he was no different.
“Here,” a familiar voice responded. John walked down the long room until he found Sherlock. He was wearing nitrile gloves and peering into a locker, which appeared to have once been completely taped off by the police.
Sherlock looked out over the water with his hands clasped behind him, and neither of them moved or spoke for several long seconds.
“It’s not too soon for that?” John asked.
Carl Powers, a third year from the UCL School of Laws, had been found dead in the pool three days earlier. The media had reported it as an accidental drowning, and there’d been no mention of foul play. Of course, everyone at the School of Laws had been talking about it.
“It’s just my father. He’s at the canteen.”
“I wasn’t keen on her or anything, you know,” John blurted out before he could stop himself. For some reason, it felt important to make that clear. “I just…she was a good person. She didn’t deserve this.”
John peeked out from under his arm. Sherlock’s eyes were closed, his limbs sprawled over the bed clothes gracefully. John let his gaze linger, because he could now, because he was allowed.
“I’m s-sorry,” Sherlock interrupted. It came out sounding half-choked.
“Even if she didn’t die of drowning, that doesn’t rule out suicide,” Lestrade said, apparently trying to get the conversation back on track.
John grunted, letting go of Sherlock’s length long enough to push his pants and trousers off the rest of the way, as Sherlock kicked off his pyjamas...and then they were fully naked together in bed for the first time.
Sherlock averted his eyes, looking embarrassed, but he nodded. “But then you came down tonight, wearing those jeans, and the shoes, and I started to hope again.”
“I didn’t think you were either, at first,” John said.
Sherlock let his head fall back, gasping, and John chuckled, continuing to tease the nipple, before moving on to the other one. He kissed down Sherlock’s chest to his stomach, pausing momentarily.
“Lo, how a rose e’er blooming,” Mrs. Hudson said.
But then John was moving off of him. Sherlock almost protested, but a stern look from John and he clicked his jaw shut again. He stopped when his head was level with Sherlock’s pants, which were straining to restrain his cock. “Okay, where were we the other day?”
“You have a lot of explaining to do,” John said gruffly.
Just as John thought he’d forgotten him, Sherlock’s curly head popped out over the ledge. “John, come on!” his head disappeared again, and John climbed the rest of the way as quickly as he could.
A wonderful turn of events, which, now, Sherlock had ruined. Sherlock gulped, turning his face away.
“Are you my new doctor?” she asked dubiously.
Instead, he spoke again, his hand still in Sherlock’s hair. “Can I ask you something? You don’t have to answer, if you don’t want to.”
“Bored?” John snorted. “I’m the farthest thing from being bored. I have so much to do I can’t sleep for more than a few hours a night—”
It was always the same when it rained. It was soothing in its inevitability, its predictability.
get a flatmate?” She looked back at John. “What, did he follow you home?” she cocked her head toward Sherlock.
John ached to pick her up and just breathe her in, but rule number one was never to wake a sleeping baby, and he knew he’d regret it.
“It’s still cold enough to give you hypothermia,” John called out, but it was too late; Sherlock had started to swim toward the cluster. John glanced back toward the far bridge where the crime scene was still ongoing, but they were far enough away that no one had seemed to notice that Sherlock Holmes was fully submerged in the Thames.
John didn’t hesitate. “Stay,” he said, eyes still closed. And Sherlock stayed.
“No,” Sherlock managed to say, finally, in between kisses.
John reached up to cup Sherlock’s cheek, and Sherlock’s eyes fluttered at the contact. “Alright?” he asked, still unsure.
“Sherlock,” John said in relief. “The murderer is my bloody Criminal Law professor. His name was Moriarty. He made me stay after lecture, and was dropping all these hints about the pool—he knows who I am. He knows we were there.”
,” people always said. He said it to people all the time as a doctor. But it simply didn’t delineate the violence of the act, the selfishness of someone taking their own life. Nor did it encapsulate the ravaged wasteland of being the one left behind.
“I think it’s because I can’t turn my brain off.”
“Yes, please,” Sherlock breathed into his ear.
“Now you’re going to get sick, too.”
Once they’d eaten breakfast and gotten dressed, was almost one in the afternoon. The “office” they were looking for, Sherlock informed him, was in a small shop near Park Street T stop, only a short walk from their hotel. They walked along the Common for a bit until they turned down a small street that connected two bigger streets. The crooked alleys that veered off in strange angles reminded him of London, which had also grown during the times before cities were laid out in brick patterns.
“There’s nothing left for me to wish for.”
“Do you want…” he cleared his throat.
John laughed, looking at her over Sherlock’s shoulder. “I’m getting your food, sweetheart. Your dads were just having a moment."
“Come along, John,” Sherlock called over his shoulder, striding forward as if he belonged there. John sighed in exasperation, jogging to catch up with him.
“You, I want. I want you,” he said breathlessly.
Sherlock’s hand moved infinitesimally, and he pressed the tips of his fingers John’s chest, the heat of them just barely seeping through the cotton of his vest.
John gulped.
Sherlock didn’t speak. After a moment, he turned toward John on the bed, their bodies so close that John could feel his warmth, but they weren’t quite touching.
“Promise?” she said.
John felt his heart leap in his throat as he looked up in surprise. This wasn’t Sherlock, he knew that; it was just some images captured on film. Yet for some reason, John couldn’t stop watching, wondering what was going to happen next.
He took out his violin and quickly tuned it, then simply let it rest against his neck as he looked out the window, plucking a few strings but not actually playing anything. John sighed and went back to his reading. Despite only having lived with him for a couple of weeks, he knew that nothing he did would snap Sherlock out of it right now.
Donovan looked daggers at Sherlock, clamped her mouth shut and stalked away.
“Apparently I do, because I just did.”
Sherlock had already turned back to his slide, which he now put under the microscope. “Mrs. Hudson, this is John Watson. He’s studying law at the university. He’ll be my new flatmate.”
“What ever is, with the two of us?” John reached up to cup his cheek, brushing his thumb over Sherlock’s lips. “But it’s worth it. All of it. All the pain, all the years apart…it’s worth it to me. I want to be with you too, so much. Today, tomorrow, fifty years from now. Because you’re the fucking love of my life, actually.”
This went on for a lifetime, but Sherlock still didn’t come.
John felt irrationally pissed off about it. It wasn’t as if he would be kissing anyone under said mistletoe, including the only person he wanted to kiss: the person who was currently sitting on the living room floor.
Her smile disappeared when she noticed Mycroft. “Mycroft. What are you doing here?”
Sherlock seemed to share the sentiment. He swung a leg over so that he could sit on John’s lap, wrapping his long limbs around him. And oh, that was
“Oh, yes I do,” Lestrade took her face in both hands and kissed her, to Mrs. Hudson’s delight. It wasn’t a quick kiss, either, especially when Lestrade dipped her.
Suddenly, Sherlock stood up.
“Rugby,” John said, smiling.
“Oh.” Sherlock looked almost relieved, turning back to his slide. “Which one?”
“Right, nothing at all, obviously,” John said, sitting on the bedside and reaching over to feel Sherlock’s forehead. It was clammy but feverish, and his hair was plastered to his forehead.
They kissed slowly, and John felt arousal spiking deep down, but he didn’t want to push Sherlock too far too fast. He took a few more sips from Sherlock’s mouth, then pulled back, still holding Sherlock close.
Sherlock turned to look at him, and John could have sworn that his pupils darkened just a bit as his eyes flicked down John’s mostly nude form. But just as quickly, he was back in his thinking pose.
“John,” Sherlock breathed into his mouth, like a whispered prayer.
“I said that’s
. Stop playing dumb.”
Chi’s father stood up straighter. “No, thank you, Doctor.”
John glanced over at Sherlock, who hadn’t acknowledged his presence, and his eyes caught on a small object hanging from the beam that separated the kitchen from the salon.
He collapsed backward onto the bed, and Sherlock stood up, licking his lips and wiping a bit of come off his mouth with the back of his hand.
“Yes, yes,” John said, sucking at his throat, starting to stroke him faster. Sherlock arched again, and hot come was spurting all over John’s hand as John stroked him through it.
“It holds some features of interest.”
When he reached the point in the park where that one bench stood, John paused for a moment. He had walked by it thousands of times, never acknowledging its significance, but for some reason, this time he paused.
“You did it for a reason,” John said, trying to get his thoughts back in track. “The mistletoe.”
“She died,” Chi said, her voice emotionless.
Sherlock opened the cabinets, frowning as he realized that there were no clean tea cups; most of them were currently on the table. John’s mouth twitched upward into a smile.
“Oh my god,” John said, threading his fingers through Sherlock’s hair.
“Go away.” Sherlock’s voice was raspy and low.
John clenched his fist. “For your information, I worked really, really hard to get into UCL. I’m not going to give it up now.”
Sherlock took his hand, and John helped him up, then pulled him into a hug. He fisted his hands into the back of Sherlock’s coat.
“Not to me.”
“I’d rather stay here.”
Sherlock took the opportunity to catch John’s earlobe between his teeth, worrying it a little, which went straight to John’s cock.
Sherlock bobbed a few times, twisting his hand a bit on the downstroke. He teased the head with his tongue, then took John's cock all the way down his throat until he almost choked, then bobbed some more.
“Your alcoholic sister’s failings shouldn’t dictate your entire life. Even your father would have agreed with that, drunkard though he was. Fulfilling your dead parent’s wishes is simple folly.”
“'Course,” he said, nodding. Once he had everything in place for landing, he lay back and closed his eyes, nursing his water. He could already feel the dehydration headache coming on.
“What else should we do today?” John closed his eyes, his voice already drowsy. “Maybe there’ll be a case. I could call Lestrade.”
“We should get up and shower,” John said drowsily.
Sherlock stopped, one knee on the bed, and John reached up with both hands to push his jacket off his shoulders. Sherlock shrugged out of it, letting John work on his buttons. John kissed down his chest as his skin was revealed, wonderingly, and Sherlock’s breath started to come quicker.
After the first few notes, John knew exactly what it was. He settled back into his chair, letting the sound of the lone violin wash over him. He felt at peace for the first time in a long time, a kind of peace that he had never thought he’d find after everything with Mary.
“Top marks.” Sherlock led him up the stairs to the first floor.
Sherlock pointed. “The hot dog man. Larry.”
Attempting deflection, John snorted. “Because you seem to have some kind of death wish.” It was supposed to be a reprimand, but his voice came out softer than he’d meant it to be.
“It’s the first day with the new Crim professor, the one who uses the Socratic method. You don’t want to be late.”
He stomped up to his room and lay on his bed to study more, but he couldn’t focus on the words. Sherlock’s voice kept floating through his head. The thing was, every single thing he’d said had been spot on. John had never fully admitted it to himself, but giving up medicine was one of his greatest regrets. It was like Sherlock had known exactly which buttons to push.
He peered into each of Sherlock’s eyes, trying to see if his pupils were normal. “I’m going to ask you some questions to see if you have a head injury. Who is the prime minister?”
As he turned the corner to his flat, he saw a figure in a long coat standing on his porch.
Now, John let his eyes wander a bit, down Sherlock’s torso to his narrow hips, then back up to the curling hair over Sherlock’s pale forehead. His lush lips that looked a bit raw from all the kissing the evening before, and his eyelids were fluttering slightly in his sleep. It was surreal to see Sherlock in such a vulnerable position in the light of day.
“Whatever happened to 'you and me against the rest of the world'”. Everyday John writes. Every godforsaken day he takes out his laptop and types what ever is on his overly intoxicated mind. “You promised.” Some days he is just one drink away from posting his entire internal monologue but he never does. His blog was for his and Sherlock's adventures, he doesn't want to ruin that. His creative space is reserved ready for when Sherlock returns.
“Psychosomatic.” He whispers to himself. If it's in his mind he can defeat it. Sherlock can defeat it when he comes back but that doesn't help him now.
He steps forward ever so slightly and places his hand atop the headstone.
And maybe it's the alcohol. A glass of scotch stuck permanently to his hand. It took him four days to reach for the booze. If nothing else then just to block out the voices. A simple breeze, that's all it takes for John's head to snap up in search of his detective. He just wanted a distraction.
A black car pulls up in front of him. Greg Lestrade climbs out of the front seat to hold the back door open for John.
With both hands he lifts the floorboard from its usual residing place and is able to witness the delights within.
He climbs up onto the edge and stands. His entire body shudders in the cold or perhaps out of fear.
“This is your last warning.” Lestrade yells, with handcuffs as John climbs in to the backseat. The door seals shut behind him. “I'm afraid we have no comment and we politely ask you to respect John's privacy through his time of grieving.” With those final words he climbs into the front seat and drives towards the cemetery.
The gravel is tough beneath his shoes but he enjoys the London silence.
“Mary Morstan.”
“Richard Brook, real or fake?”
It's been three days. Since... since the f-fall. John has yet to leave the flat. The walls haunt him, taunt him. But hope- hope breaks through all of that.
Two weeks and one day. His leg itches. The pain returns. It feels as if a bullet is attempting to claw its way out. His limp- psychosomatic. The bullet never resided within his leg. His shoulder was the victim but the agony is returning.
Three weeks exactly. Bartholomew's hospital. Today has been the worst of days. He'd found a newspaper clipping of the first case they had ever solved. What followed he isn't proud of.
“It's been a week. A week. Sherlock hasn't come back.” His fingers type slowly over the keyboard. His eyes are glassy, blurry and John is certain many factors have contributed to this.
“Mmm, and you watch telly? You know why I’m here.” A pained groan escapes his lips towards the end of his sentence. This is a technique designed to make him confront his problems and admit them aloud for the first time. “I'm here because...”
“Goodbye.”
“Yeah, listen: I-I’m not actually that angry, okay?”
The first days were the easiest.
“Sher...”
“Carry on like what? Being alone. Sherlock was all I had, my best friend, my only friend.” He snaps but unintentionally so. Mrs Hudson is but a victim in Sherlock's delicately crafted web of destruction but grief has got the better of John.
“Yes.” He mumbles through gritted teeth. Whatever happened to not “De mortuis nihil nisi bonum”? Whatever happened to “don't speak ill of the dead”?
“D'you want to hear me say it?” He can just about spit out the words.
“You need to move on.”
“Was it really suicide?” One of the vultures shouts over the noise. A microphone is thrust towards his mouth but he has no intention of answering the question. 'No it was not a suicide. Sherlock is not dead. He isn't dead.'
“I can’t go back to the flat again – not at the moment.” Something stirs within him. “I'm angry.” He can't be surrounded by Sherlock's stuff and their memories. He can't carry on living with his ghosts. He takes in a deep breath through his nose in an attempt not to break down.
Perhaps it's the lack of sleep. He has been plagued by insomnia. Every time he shuts his eyes, he is forced to watch Sherlock fall again. He tries to look for plot holes in his dreams- any way that Sherlock could have escaped- but he knows he's hanging on hopes.
He can still hear the violin. Bach, Mendelssohn, Sarasate. It doesn't matter. He can hear the faint screeching as the minims, crochets and quavers intertwine into something beyond beautiful. And when he composed...
He paces slowly, with tremors in his knees, towards the edge.
Much like a shadow of Sherlock's previous actions, John sits cross legged in the middle of the room. He ties a small piece of elasticated string he found within the floor around his arm. Sherlock, being the compulsive perfectionist he is, has labelled each and every syringe exactly. A seven percent solution of cocaine? Not today. The highest dosage of morphine readily available? Why of course.
“Into the mind of a sociopath.” Beneath the mattress? Too obvious. In the pocket of a spare coat? He has lots of coats but alas no. Too simple. John never proclaimed to be a genius, in fact for from it. He is but a simple minded, subservient man but now is his chance to declare a new found intelligence. If pain can do anything, it can motivate him to find the gold.
It is not at all out of place to find Sherlock's stash here. This is where he sits when he sets himself up on a high.
“Bloody specimens in my fridge. Imagine – keeping bodies where there’s food!”
The priest signals towards the head of the coffin, suspended above a six foot pit in the ground. Six feet deep seems unnecessary. He's hardly going to claw his way back out... and even if he does, at least he's alive.
Somedays he'd sit silently, for almost twenty four hours, in Sherlock's room as if being surrounded by his possession helped him to feel closer to the detective; but all it did was make him feel more and more lonely.
The thought alone raises him to his unsteady feet before lowering him to his knees atop the ground. He knows Sherlock better than pretty much anyone and he is certain his stash is somewhere close.
Two weeks. Mrs Hudson began to notice more and more that John wasn't coping. His brave face had failed. He barely ate, he barely slept, he barely got dressed. His diet consisted of a litre of scotch and two hours sleep a day.
The shattered carcass of a phone, tossed onto the ground, sits near his feet. He is frozen still. His body shakes. That phone, his note, all of it. He can't do this anymore.
“SHERLOCK,” his eyes snap open. His pants are thick and fast but steady as he realises. Sweat matts every square inch of his toughened skin. He can't carry on like this.
“Sherlock Holmes” written in a gold font across a black marble headstone. A headstone approximately two foot high- that's all he gets. Maybe its because they know. If he is dead, which John is sure he isn't, then of course he deserves better.
“Yeah.” She doesn't understand. Sh never had the connection with Sherlock that John did.
“John?” A hand is rested upon his shoulder. He looks up towards the priest. Ironic really. A man who believed religion to be the delusion of the small minded man (an evolutionary flaw designed to give humanity a supposed purpose), an atheist to say the least, having a religious ceremony to mark his 'passing'. Ludicrous.
The flat still smells like him. A strangely comforting aroma that burns thick in his nose. The scent of a man who had gone without a shower for days but still managed to present himself as clean. The faint smell of nicotine and tar despite his adamant protests he had given up. But most prominent of all are the voices, the sounds he hears in the middle of the night. His very own ghosts.
“What happened, John?” She stare across at him sympathetically. Everything she thought she'd fixed is back.
The pain dissipates almost immediately, leaving John up in the clouds. It's temporary. However, in the moment he forgets. He pictures this as the perfect permanent solution to a temporary problem. He'll stop when Sherlock comes home.
“You need to get it out.”
The taxi ride is solemn. Mrs Hudson sits at his side with a bunch of flowers in hand. Ella, John's therapist, told him to let it. She suggested going to Sherlock's grave and saying everything he left unsaid. She told him he would begin to accept if he did this.
“And you are...?” He looks up with a familiar half smirk that has been absent for so long.
Six months.
“My best friend ... Sherlock Holmes ...” He sniffs loudly through his tears. “...is dead.”
Every morning Mrs Hudson would set a cup of tea in a space beside John (wherever he would be) and at noon she'd return to find it stone cold and untouched.
His paces are small, timid and uncertain. He reaches his post and shrinks almost immediately beneath the weight of the eyes. He has a speech, but right now it doesn't seem enough. Sherlock Holmes deserves more. He has never felt so small; he has never felt so inadequate; and he has never felt so lonely.
“Why today?” Three weeks and three days: John broke. He finally gave in the Mrs Hudson's persistant pleas for him to visit a therapist.
“JOHN!”
“No comment.” John mutters but the syllables catch in his throat. He has barely spoken since that day. He was always afraid of what might come out.
On hands and knees he scrambles across the floor.
“I'd be lost without my blogger.” THEN WHY AREN'T YOU HERE NOW. John is lost without his arrogant, annoying dick of a consulting detective too. Their lives are part of one eternity. Without the other, John is incomplete. He is like the Earth without his sun. Drifting, with no centripetal force to to steady him; no heat to give him purpose. He has no friends, no job, nothing.
“Sometimes.” Of course she does. You don't need to be Sherlock to see that much.
“Keep your eyes fixed on me.” Static rings through the air. His head pounds. Brutal. Agony. “Please, will you do this for me?”
He despises himself for allowing what he did last night. He used to stand so high and mighty above Sherlock and declare drug taking an abomination. He used to suggest Sherlock's addiction to narcotics was a flaw in an otherwise prime specimen of humanity; but who would he be to criticise the detective now. He has stooped just as far, just as quickly. He doesn't deserve to criticise Sherlock any longer.
“Um...mmm” These words are hard. Everything he wants to say he has said before but in riddles. He has never been one to be upfront but now he must be, for his own sakes more than anybody elses. “You... you told me once that you weren't a hero. Ummm... there were times I didn't even think you were human,” a small chuckle escapes his lips. “but let me tell you this: you were the best man, and the most human... human being that I've ever known and no-one will ever convince me that you told me a lie, and so... There.” He breathes out heavily. A slight whimper escapes his lips. He gazes over his shoulder at Mrs Hudson but she appears to be looking the other way.
“Stand back or I'll have to hold you in contempt.” A small smile tugs at his lips, as if trying to reassure John.
He wakes up. The mist of whatever drug he laced into his bloodstream gone. The ache has returned but it isn't the most potent feeling within the doctor.
Sherlock wouldn't leave him. Couldn't leave him. It's just the two of them against the rest of the world after all.
“You turned me into something so much worse. You made me into this.” A sob catches in John's throat. “You made me something I never wanted to be- you!” He can't help it. All his anger comes out in that one moment but there isn't much. His emotions consist primarily of sorrow, melancholy and sheer loneliness. “Just come home.”
“Look, I find it difficult... I find it difficult, this sort of stuff.” He has to say something but the screwed up speech within his pocket isn't enough. For the great Sherlock Holmes it never could be. No amount of words can ever describe the impact the detective has had on John's life. “You were the best and wisest man...” He breathes in deeply. The words feel wrong within his mouth. He shouldn't be saying this. None of this. Sherlock is not dead. “that I have ever known. And I forgive you.” Of course he does. That is the most profound thing he can say in that moment. If Sherlock is alive, John is sure he'd be listening in. He has to known. He has to know it's okay.
“Do what?” Oh how he wishes he could return to that beautiful moment of ignorance. He never believed he'd actually do it.
Nothing can compare to the thrill of the chase. Guns firing in the near distance, could there be a sweeter sound? John thinks not.
He tries to stand but his leg gives way almost immediately. Sherlock seemed to be his antidote but he has decided to take a break. John is feeling the full and complete effects of his distance right about now.
His skin feels as though it is bubbling against his human carcass. Not even alcohol can dampen the pain.
With one hand he knocks lightly on the wood trying to find a hollowed out section in which one could hide all manner of things. Funny how an addict's mind works when denied the thing they crave most. With each tap the echo seems to increase ever so slightly. It is clear when John hits his mark. The dullness in the background of the knock has gone.
His fingers run softly down a crack in a floorboard. No other board possesses such a mark, if not for the dust you'd think the floor had just been laid. But the curiousity of that flawed plank of wood, intrigues him for just a while. The slit is small, so only a keen eye would take note but John's pain induced perception provides the perfect conditions for such a find.
“I was so alone, and I owe you so much.” He takes in a deep tearful breath. “Okay.” He starts to walk away but only reaches the foot of the grave before turning back. There is still too much left unsaid. “'No please, there's just on more thing, mate, one more thing: one more miracle Sherlock, for me. Don't... be...” His voice cracks. “... dead. Would you do...? Just for me, just stop it. Stop this.” He sighs lowering his head and just stands there- the broken empty shell of a soldier he has been for a long time. He allows himself to break even if just a little.
Undeterred, Donovan barreled forward. “Just you wait. One of these days, we are going to be standing around a body and Sherlock Holmes will be the one who put it there.”
Sherlock scowled at him, and John couldn’t look at him for another second, because he was sure that his own expression was giving him away. Needing to put some distance between them, John swung his legs out of bed and picked up the phone.
,” Sherlock’s plump lip turned downward in an exaggerated pout. “I just—”
before.”
“Hold still.” John moved half a step closer, reaching up to pick the fluff off Sherlock’s shirt. His fingers brushed the smooth skin on Sherlock’s throat as he did so, which sent a thrill down his spine.
The story of their lives had always been about emptiness. The empty space between their bodies, which John had wanted to close so many times, to just...give in,
Sherlock immediately grabbed his arm, pulling him over onto the rooftop. The momentum of it, however, made him lose his balance, and they both toppled forward. Sherlock landed with a soft grunt, and John was directly on top of him. Their faces were half an inch apart, and Sherlock’s wild eyes were looking directly into John’s.
“John,” Sherlock said, and John was already running up the aisles to detain the two men.
Sherlock nodded, and then John’s body was gone, but Sherlock barely had time to register the loss before John was back. John quickly divested himself of his sleeping shirt, and was now only in his boxers. He pushed Sherlock down onto his back, settling himself between Sherlock’s legs, and Sherlock heard the click of a bottle. Sherlock closed his eyes, arching his head backward.
Then, when Sherlock was sure he was going to combust if John didn’t actually touch his cock, John licked the pants directly over it. Sherlock swore, his hands now fisting into the sheets at his sides.
“And?” Mr. Hatayama said, his voice a bit wobbly.
“Need anything?” he asked, looking around the disaster that was once her kitchen. It appeared like she was cooking for an entire regiment, rather than the handful of people they actually called friends.
John laughed. “Not for a second.”
“Okay?” John panted into his ear.
I know, it's been ages since this updated. I'm planning on trying to update every couple of weeks from now on, though. Scout's honor.
John put his own coat on another hook and walked into the flat. It was homey, if messy, with two armchairs in front of an old-fashioned fireplace. There was a skull on the mantelpiece, next to a stack of letters had been skewered to the wood with a knife. Various medical and chemical tomes, as well as sheets of notes, were scattered everywhere. John wandered into the kitchen, where two different microscopes had been set up, and what appeared to be a couple of ongoing experiments.
Anderson threw him a disgusted look, as did a few of the other technicians.
Sherlock was already running toward the edge of the roof, and John followed, wondering what he’d gotten himself into.
“What was that all about, anyway?” John asked as they walked back towards the sunlight. He glanced around, but there were no taxis in sight. It wasn’t far to Sherlock’s flat, but he was dead weight and they would never make it on foot.
John paused. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
“John--”
“You’re so fucking gorgeous,” John breathed.
John cleared his throat again. “Will you show me how to make those?” John said, gesturing toward the sheets of paper. “I’ll help you.”
“You could still be a doctor, you know,” Sherlock called out after him.
“Please tuck in, then, everyone. Plates and cutlery are on the counter.”
“I told you I would help you--” he said, straightening up.
“Is this a…” he stopped, biting his lip.
“What the-” Larry started to ask, trying to pull back.
“Fucking crazy buggers,” the driver muttered.
“Take a seat then, Mr. Watson.”
John lowered his hand. “Of course, of course I’ll come,” John said, grabbing his coat and keys and shutting the door behind himself.
After a moment, he leaned back, resting his forehead against Sherlock’s. “I’m going to get something to clean us up, all right?”
Sherlock didn’t text him.
As he watched the car pull away, John’s immediate impulse was to call Sherlock and warn him. However, as he took out his phone and looked at the screen, he realized that he hadn’t actually gotten Sherlock’s number.
John flinched, turning around as Mycroft slid into view, holding a very expensive bottle of scotch.
Sherlock forced himself to turn and look at him.
Sherlock was silent for a long moment, and John thought he’d fallen asleep. “If your connection to her was that circumstantial, I doubt he targeted her because of you. The motive still eludes me, but I will do my best to bring her murderers to justice, John. Hers and Carl’s. I promise.”
Chi shook her head. “No, that’s not how it works, Doctor Watson. I have to fold all of my own cranes or my wish won’t be granted. You should do your own.”
“Flatmate? How did
The doorbell rang, and John felt his stomach drop out as he looked toward the front of the house.
,” John interrupted forcefully. “Do you want to kiss me?”
“Just take it, please.”
“Yeah, that’s it, god, you’re so beautiful,” John whispered, kissing down his throat.
“We want to look out for anything suspicious until then, but yes.” Sherlock was drumming his fingers against his thighs, obviously keyed up.
Sherlock glanced up briefly, then back down at the newspaper clipping he was holding. “Oh. It just sort of…happened.”
“Hey,” he said, lamely.
“I already know more about you than most of your acquaintances, as I believe I have already proven.” The side of Sherlock’s mouth quirked upward slightly. “Is there some other problem?”
“Sherlock, look at me,” John said sternly.
John hunched his shoulders. “Sorry,” he whispered.
John made a noise of surprise, and Sherlock realized what he had just done. He was about to pull back when John made another, more gutteral noise, and his hand slid back into Sherlock’s hair as he pushed Sherlock back against the door. He caressed Sherlock’s lips lightly with his own, flicking his tongue against them, until Sherlock felt his lips part involuntarily to accept him. John was pressed up against him completely, now, and Sherlock felt so lightheaded that it was if he had been deprived of oxygen, but he didn’t dare break away. He was kissing John Watson,
“There’s a book too, if you’re teaching young children how to do origami,” the clerk said, smiling, as she scanned all the packages. “We have teachers in here all the time. What level do you teach?”
The girl squinted at him, and John had a strange feeling that she could see right through him. It reminded him so forcibly of Sherlock that he had to look away.
The bartender brought his beer. “Cheers,” Mr. Hatayama said, taking a long drink.
“I know, I…” he trailed off, immobilized by choice.
“Good.” Looking pleased, Sherlock left the kettle to boil and strode down the hall towards a bedroom. “I’ll get you a jumper.”
John glanced at the clock. It was already 11 am, and they definitely needed to get up.
John paused for a moment, swallowing deeply.
“Very.” Sherlock lay down lengthwise on the couch, in his thinking pose, with his hands steepled under his chin.
“--to which I already know the answers, right,” John muttered. He took out the bottle of paracetamol and shook out a few pills. “Here, take these.”
“He didn’t go to his death in the end,
“The girl was so sick that she couldn’t go anywhere, so one day she started folding paper cranes.” She pointed up at the strings of cranes overhead. “There’s a legend that if you fold a thousand paper cranes, your wish will be granted. So she tried to fold a thousand, hoping that once she did, she would be cured.”
“I-I’m sorry, just…” John started to say, but Sherlock’s vulnerability stopped him. He couldn’t–he
“What about with, um. Other men?”
John did, kissing him hard and deep, thrusting upward over and over and over.
“Am I still dreaming?” His voice was raspy, but at least he wasn’t coughing anymore.
“You’re burning up,” John observed.
John thought. “Not just tonight, though, right?” John needed things to be clear between them, because there was no going back from this.
Sherlock eventually relaxed, his whole body trembling. John kissed both of his eyelids.
“The mistletoe. You put it up, right?” John prompted.
Sherlock surprised him with a sudden motion, swinging his leg over so that he could pull himself up onto John’s lap.
She breathed a few times, slowly, but John stayed still, waiting.
There was a long pause. When the man spoke again, it was in an even quieter voice than before. “If you were to continue your association with Sherlock Holmes, I would be happy to pay you a meaningful sum of money to…ease your way.”
“Come back to bed.” Sherlock’s voice was a low rumble. He started nuzzling the back of John’s neck, sending tingling sensations down John’s extremities.
--it was too much. John was suddenly extremely aware that the final crane was still in his pocket.
“She drank half an ounce less than this morning,” he said, frowning.
“What is that?”
“Okay.” John didn’t bother to push further; his buoyant mood was too high to be sunk by Sherlock’s taciturnity. He picked up the mystery novel he’d been reading and let himself settle into his chair, enjoying the warmth of the fire as the wind whistled outside.
Sherlock looked up at him, his eyes dark smudges, and his teeth chattering audibly. “John?”
He shut the door, and the cab driver muttered some obscenities again before driving off.
Sherlock’s eyes widened as his mouth clicked shut.
“Hmph,” Sherlock huffed, not looking at him.
John lowered his fist slowly, his anger just starting to dissipate. The fact that Sherlock was beneath him, solid, real, actually
"John," Sherlock said, his voice cracking slightly.
“I will give you a ride to a destination of your choosing.”
“I should think it’s rather obvious.” Sherlock put the bag in his pocket and went back to inspecting the locker.
“Well, this didn’t take long. What should we do until the game starts?”
“Okay?” Sherlock stopped, looking up at him through his eyelashes, eyes hooded, plush lips hovering just over his cock.
Sherlock arched up into him. “Oh,” he gasped.
“Fuck,” John breathed, arching into Sherlock. He hadn’t thought past the first part of this—well, of course he’d fantasized about this a thousand times, but he’d never known for sure if Sherlock would want that, want
“Don’t be coy,” Sherlock said. He nuzzled John’s cock through his pants, which was a sight John had seen in his dreams, but never thought he’d see in real life. “You know why I made you wear them the first time.”
He swallowed, his throat working a little.
“I… didn’t.”
“No,” he said bluntly.
“Sorry,” Lestrade said to Sherlock, who shrugged, appearing unruffled. Lestrade’s eyes fell on John. “Who’s this? I can’t really have more unauthorized people on the scene.”
“I’ll feed her,” Sherlock said, picking up her small bowl of oatmeal and walking over to take her out of the high chair.
John felt his eyebrows lift. That sounded exactly how a little girl would describe the atom bombs in World War II.
It had been a couple of months since he’d moved back into 221B. It was like coming home, but as the old saying went, ‘you can never go home again.’ He’d changed irreversibly–he and Sherlock
“Oh, John, good,” Sherlock said, nodding curtly. “I was looking for you. We’ve been summoned to a crime scene.”
“I don’t—”
John nodded. He reached into his pocket, pulling the crane out. Harry raised an eyebrow.
“You did say it,” Sherlock said, while John kissed down his throat.
.” John slid his hands around Sherlock’s waist, his head falling back against the headboard. “Do you want… the lube…”
On some level, he wished he’d prepared more for this moment. If he’d woken up that morning, knowing that this would be the day he would finally tell Sherlock how he felt, that he would finally rip his chest open and let him see his heart, maybe he would have had a glass of brandy or two to steel himself.
Still, that phrase running through his head was so utterly, uncharacteristically romantic. Sappy, even.
Sherlock took the blow hard, falling onto his back, and John knelt, grabbing him by the collar. He was about to sock him again, but for some reason he paused when he saw Sherlock’s expression of calm serenity.
“You being gone...I was untethered. I never expected to,” he made a nose of frustration. “I don’t get attached to people.” Sherlock’s gaze lowered, his eyelashes fanning over his cheeks.
Sherlock went to the front desk to check them in while John dealt with the bags, giving them to the bellboy. Keys in hand a few minutes later, Sherlock led him over to the elevators, once again seeming more… ebullient than usual.
“Well, I guess that’s it then,” John panted, but Sherlock simply backed up, then ran full stop toward the ledge.
“And you’re going to try and, what, stop them?” John hissed.
“John, wake up.” A hand shook his shoulder lightly. “John.”
John chuckled, handing him one of the metal bottles. “Live a little. One beer isn’t going to make it hard for you to catch… whatever it is you’re trying to see. Besides, it’s baseball. Beer is practically required.”
"Just tell me something first," John said, meeting Sherlock’s eyes.
“Well…yeah."
“Oh fuck, yes, god yes,” John gasped, starting to thrust again, chasing after his own release.
As searing blue eyes held his, John couldn’t control himself anymore, and he was coming and coming, still thrusting hard upward and crying out into Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock held him through it until John finally felt himself coming down from his orgasm.
Sherlock nodded, his heart pounding.
“That’s not what people normally say.”
He reached into the crib and brushed her round, soft cheek with the back of his fingers. She snuffled a little in her sleep but didn’t wake.
John trudged quietly up to their flat, his joints creaking a bit as he walked up the last few steps—when had he gotten so old?—and hung his coat on its hook.
“John,” Mr. Hatayama stood, catching his arm. “Please, just take it with you. It was the last thing she asked me to do. Please.” He picked up the crane and held it out to John. “She said to say… you promised.”
does.”
we bumped into each other,” the man said, pulling the collar of his long wool coat up against the winter wind.
John closed his eyes. “I lost someone,” he said, his throat dry. It was true, but it was desaturated language. “
“They’re your date shoes,” Sherlock said matter-of-factly. “And I was certain you weren’t trying to pull Mrs. Hudson.”
” He shook his head, looking displeased with himself, as he removed his dark blue scarf. “It’s always something.”
Sherlock shook his head. “If it was, I deleted it. Unnecessary.”
Sherlock sighed emphatically. “A case.”
“I–I don’t…” Sherlock stuttered, unable to finish his sentence because John took the opportunity to tease his nipple with his tongue.
“Cuddling?” John suggested.
John gave up, going over to the fridge to put away the food.
And then, Mary had taken the bullet instead. Mary had died instead. And if he was being honest with himself, he had been relieved, for a split second.
“Get. Over. Here,” John said, pointing in front of him.
Sherlock’s eyes snapped open, meeting John’s gaze. “Do it.”
. He still couldn’t say it. After berating Sherlock about it, he still couldn’t say
John settled in, working on a write-up of a minor case they had solved a couple of weeks before. After they took off and he’d made some headway, he glanced over at Sherlock, who appeared to be dozing. Since no one else was in their row, John let himself look his fill.
“Of course not,” John scoffed.
“It’s been a while since we felt like celebrating,” John said honestly.
With a great effort, John broke the gaze and stepped backward, his heart hammering in his chest. He picked up his bookbag from the floor. “I’d better get going,” he said, attempting to keep his tone light.
“Pet?” John repeated.
,” Sherlock said again, as if this were completely obvious. He turned his collar up against the drizzle that was starting to come down.
John picked up the cup and took a sip of the tea, which was fixed exactly how he liked it. A peace offering, if a meagre one. “Thanks,” he said.
“What do you want?” he asked, thumbing the head of Sherlock’s cock once before stroking him again.
“Yep.” John smacked his lips together on the last syllable.
Sherlock woke the next morning with the sound of rain against the windows. He lay there, watching the drops streak down for a few minutes, while he held a pillow close to him. It still smelled like John, which was proof that John had been in his bed. Not only that, but John wasn’t going anywhere, and John wanted to be with him. For all intents and purposes, he had never really had sex before, but John was alright with that. Sherlock contemplated these things for a few more minutes, and several things clicked into place all at once. He had to tell John, immediately, because John had to come back to bed.
For a few long moments, neither of them spoke, and Sherlock could practically hear the wheels turning as John considered that revelation. Sherlock was sure that at any moment John was going to leave the room–leave
Sherlock nearly collapsed, torn between bucking into John’s mouth and thrusting into his hand. He was overwhelmed by sensation, his entire body was shaking, he was crying out into the pillow.
John ran down the empty corridor, opening the door to the lecture hall and quickly turned around to close it quietly behind him.
John pulled his soiled jumper off, and tried to rinse the stain out as best he could. After he had pulled on the new jumper, he glanced at himself in the mirror. It was almost the same shade of blue as his eyes, and it was more luxurious than anything he had ever owned. He felt uncomfortable in it.
It was a full twenty minutes (and a very healthy buzz) before he could make himself press play.
“Yes.” Sherlock snapped the screen shut and kept scribbling on the pad.
“Get it yourself,” John snapped over his shoulder. He trudged back up to his room and closed the door, a bit more forcefully than was necessary, spilling some of his tea.
“Ah, we get to the bottom of this whole tirade. I had a good day at work, by the way, thanks for asking.” John dropped his messenger bag on a chair, irritation coursing through him.
“We can’t—Rosie,” John protested feebly.
Sherlock’s brow furrowed, his eyes glistening, and he stepped forward, backing John into the sink for a deeper, more passionate kiss.
John sniffled, and his even breathing stuttered. “Morning,” he rasped.
“Mmm,” John hummed. “You want to have sex with me, and you can orgasm alone. You just don’t know what you like.” He brushed kisses up Sherlock’s jawline. “...
“Oh, shut it,” John said cheerfully. Sherlock’s mouth quirked upward into a slight grin.
When they arrived at their destination, Sherlock jumped out of the cab—leaving John to pay— and pulled some nitrile gloves from his pocket. He handed a pair to John and pulled on his own as he strode forward, his coat billowing behind him. As they walked, John took in the scene in front of him. They were on the edge of a nondescript bridge on the banks of the Thames, and several Scotland Yard cars were parked with their lights flashing. A few cops in uniform and some people in forensics suits were standing about chatting.
Sherlock emerged from the bathroom just as John was finishing up with putting new sheets on the bed.
“Greg Lestrade,” the man said, shaking John’s hand as his eyes slid from John to Sherlock and back again. “I suppose you can observe. Maybe someday you’ll be a prosecutor, eh? Couldn’t hurt to have a friend in that office.” He clapped John on the back. “You play football at UCL, John?”
"I'm not either," John admitted.
“Happy Valentine’s,” Sherlock said, feeling himself flush slightly as he said the words. He could feel John smiling even though he couldn’t see it.
“W-what?” Sherlock gasped, feeling faint. Probably from the blood rushing from his brain to… other places.
1000 cranes
John was sitting in his chair, reading the paper, a cup of hot tea steaming next to him. When he saw Sherlock, his eyes immediately lit up a little and the corners of his mouth turned upward.
“Make sure… you finish the cranes. No matter what happens,” Chi said. “For Sherlock.”
Though a few of them grumbled or gave Sherlock death glares, they moved a bit to the side, and John was able to catch a glimpse of the woman. She was wearing a familiar-looking long pink rain coat, and was nearly on her side. Her face was slightly obscured by long tendrils of dark, wet hair, and a fine white froth laced her nose and mouth.
Sherlock felt himself flush even more deeply, but the fact that John hadn’t left him yet gave him courage. He nodded again.
John looked at the jumper, then up at Sherlock. A man had left clothes at Sherlock’s flat, but he wasn’t really his roommate.
John rolled his eyes, taking off his rain-drenched clothes as quickly as possible, leaving only his pants, and slid into the bed carefully. Sherlock didn’t move, his eyes widening slightly as if he hadn’t expected for John to actually get in bed with him.
Once Sherlock finally relaxed back into the bed, John lapped at his cock, swallowing the last of it, then crawled back up to the head of the bed and collapsed. Sherlock leaned over to kiss him vociferously, peppering kisses all over his face.
“Greg, Molly.” John smiled, shaking both their hands.
He gathered up his books and notes and started to leave. There was no hope for it; he would just have to finish studying in his room.
Mrs. Hudson sighed, moving over to pat Sherlock on the shoulder. “I’m so glad that you’re moving on, Sherlock. That boy wasn’t good for you.”
“Sherlock, is this a
Understanding dawned on Sherlock’s face. “No, not
On Friday nights, sometimes Mrs. Hudson would offer to watch Rosie, and John would order Chinese food. He brought it into the salon, poured a couple fingers of scotch and watched something mindless on the telly. Sherlock would inevitably end up watching with him, with his own glass, pointing out the inaccuracies of the movie and eating far more than he normally would. By the end of those evenings, John would nod off with his head on Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock would almost always fall asleep there as well, reveling secretly in the feeling of John's body next to his own. It was like they were dangling on the precipice of something, but neither of them wanted to fall off the edge.
He might have whimpered—or maybe it was Sherlock, he wasn’t entirely sure, but his fingers sunk into Sherlock’s hair, tugging his head to the side so that he could kiss him harder.
John slid his hands around Sherlock’s waist.
Sherlock snorted. “Did it seem like I didn’t enjoy myself?”
Sherlock walked closer until he was invading John’s personal space. Those strange eyes were almost luminescent now, and he looked at John in a way that made him flush again.
“Just—”
I don’t know, who the current King of England is
John shifted on his feet, feeling as if he were being flayed open by his gaze. “I… er… do you want breakfast? Tea?”
Sherlock just glanced down blearily at his hands and back up at John, as if he weren’t entirely sure what the objects were meant to be used for.
“God,” John said, trailing his fingers over one of Sherlock’s pectorals. “You have no idea, do you?”
“No, no. I just...I want to make sure. That this is what you want. Because…” he swallowed, trying to find the words, but it was like trying to catch a falling star. “I can’t go back from this. If we...I will want to be like this. I want. I want to be with you. Do you understand? Not just now.”
“I might not be very good at this,” Sherlock said, his eyes glinting in the low light. “It’s been quite a while.”
“Of course, of course,” Lestrade said, waving his hand. “I got approval from the D.I. Just this once.”
Sherlock leaned back a little, meeting his eyes. “Was that clear enough for you?”
The bigger man looked like he wanted to bash John's skull in, but the shorter one watched John for a moment before he said in a lazy drawl, “Seb, let’s go. I think we’ve made our point.”
“Wow,” he said, once he’d caught his breath a bit.
“We will be sitting in your section for the duration of the game,” Sherlock said, changing the subject. “Just do what you normally do.”
“Sherlock?” John reached over and started massaging Sherlock’s head with one hand. It was soothing, but it didn’t completely calm the anxiety that was fluttering through Sherlock’s chest.
Then John’s tongue was gone, his hand was gone, and John’s cock was sliding in between Sherlock’s legs, his torso on Sherlock’s back.
Apparently, John could see it in his eyes, because he pulled off.
“What the hell is going on?” the driver barked at John.
, he thought. How had he gone his entire life without knowing what it was like?
“Okay, okay, just checking. So it’s not an anatomical problem, then.”
“Ahh,” Sherlock breathed, arching backward. John thumbed the head of his cock, and Sherlock clung to his night shirt, trying to remember to breathe.
Sherlock smirked again, pushing John’s pants down to free his cock fully.
Standing here, though, listening to the rain fall on his umbrella, dichotomously reminded him of standing in front of a glossy black gravestone. A gravestone that, he now knew, had stood over an empty grave.
“No.” Sherlock looked surprised, as if that hadn’t even crossed his mind. “Not just tonight. I want everything
“Mmph.”
He rolled his eyes just as flight attendant brought the water. “Ta,” John said, smiling at her.
Sherlock was leaning forward slightly, his eyes closed and breathing ragged. John wasn’t even sure he’d heard him until he said, very quietly, “Serbia.”
, I meant…why?”
John blew air out in one long breath. “I’m not good at this stuff, but… I’m going to try.” He cleared his throat. Sherlock felt hope starting to fight against the anxiety, just a little.
it,” Sherlock said again, his voice barely above a whisper.
“Need me to help bring anything else from downstairs?” John asked.
“John, I--I’m--” Sherlock had stuttered, moving half a step back.
“Sit up a second,” Sherlock said, and John obeyed. Sherlock pulled his pants and trousers down enough that John’s cock sprung free. Sherlock paused, licking his lips again, and he met John’s gaze.
“An...enemy?” John raised an eyebrow.
Once John had put his sleeping clothes on, he looked at the bed again, feeling a bit uneasy.
“Problem?” Sherlock asked, paying the driver.
“Sherlock—” John started to say. Sherlock pressed his finger to John’s lips, a flash of mischief in his eyes, as he sank to a kneeling position on the ground. He smoothed his hands up John’s thighs, biting his lower lip, unabashedly eyeing John’s still-clothed cock.
John frowned, thinking. It all seemed so out of character for Mycroft, who rarely did something without expecting something in return.
“Possibly, or—” Sherlock stopped short. They had walked almost all the way to a bridge downstream from the crime scene, and he was looking at a cluster of logs stuck in place in the middle of the slow-moving murky water. “Given the timing of the tide at the time of death, and the rain yesterday, that must be it.”
John sighed, resigned. “I…er…okay. I guess.”
“There was once a girl who lived in Japan a long time ago. One day, something horrible came down from the sky. There was a brilliant flash of light, and in a single second many thousands of people were gone.”
John full-on laughed this time, his head ducking and his shoulders shaking with mirth.
John bit the side of his cheek. “I think I pretty much know everything you could possibly throw at me at this point, don’t you?”
As they were looking at the papers, two men, one in the tenth row and one in the fifteenth row, got up and started walking toward the exit, heads bent.
Sherlock froze completely, blinking at him. “W-what?”
“Oh for god’s sake.” Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Sherlock smoothed his fingertips over John’s hip, and John relaxed into the feeling.
him, in all the ways he wanted Sherlock.
“For all I care, we can go down to get the adoption papers today and make it official, but I think she already thinks of you as her other father,” he said.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, his voice so low that it was barely audible.
Sherlock was squinting at a piece of scratch paper. “EDR, 57. NVO, 104. ABT, 201.”
“Okay, then let’s begin.”
“And biscuits if you have them,” Sherlock called back, taking off his scarf and coat as he reached the entryway. He took the baggie with the swab out of his coat pocket.
John, everything you'll give me, today, tomorrow, fifty years from now.”
Sherlock held up the crime scene tape long enough that John was able to slip underneath it, and a young plainclothes officer walked over to them quickly, holding up a hand to halt their progress.
“Chiyo,” the girl said. “But I usually go by Chi.”
John gaped at him. He was dripping wet with hot coffee all over his jumper, and this posh-looking bloke was telling him to wait while he finished a
“Doctor Watson,” she said, turning her head slightly toward him. John quickly walked around so that he could stand in front of her.
He got up, walking out of the room, checking his watch. The paper store would still be open if he left now.
“The end,” John repeated hoarsely.
John was so lost in his own thoughts that he didn’t even notice at first when a sleek, black car pulled up beside him, moving slowly to keep pace with him. Feeling slightly uncomfortable, John walked a bit more quickly.
“And so far as I can tell, they don’t give a rat’s arse that they’re gone. We’re fine, Jim.”
John rolled his eyes, bringing her downstairs with him.
“Whoever gave you the impression that it would be mine?” Sherlock said, coming back into the room.
Sherlock’s lower lip wobbled. “I…”
Sherlock ripped off his coat and thrust it at John. “Wait here,” he said, kicking off his shoes and wading into the water.
Sherlock pressed his lips together, hesitating. That was odd; Sherlock never hesitated, never considered his words before saying them. He just
John slid his fingertips up Sherlock’s spine reassuringly. “What is it?”
Mr. Hatayama sighed. “Chi also said you’d say something like that.” He smiled a watery smile, looking at John over his wire-rimmed glasses. “She was wise beyond her years, as I’m sure you noticed.”
Chi looked up at him curiously, and her eyes emanated an intelligence that seemed beyond her years.
Sherlock looked up at him, his eyes glittering. “Do you know you do that out loud?” he asked. Their eyes met, and neither of them looked away, the moment seeming to stretch on endlessly. John’s heart was beating faster, and the wind whipping off the river couldn’t be the only reason why he shivered.
Sherlock frowned. “I do not
Sherlock had killed Magnussen, knowing full well what it would mean. Then he’d left on that plane knowing it would end in torture and death. And it had all been so that John could stay with Mary--the woman who had nearly killed him not six months before--just because he thought it was what John wanted.
John slowly caressed the skin of Sherlock’s neck with his lips, up to where his jawline met his ear, and then he nipped lightly at the skin, still palming Sherlock’s cock through his robe and pants. Then he turned to snog Sherlock full-on, his tongue teasing Sherlock’s mouth open slowly, tantalizingly. Sherlock’s eyes were still closed, but he lifted one hand up to reach around John’s neck, more for stability than anything else.
John stared at the crane, but he didn’t take it. Instead, he gulped down the rest of his whiskey.
The lock had already been picked, so John walked quickly down the hallway, glancing furtively around him as he went. He opened the door leading to the locker room and peeked in. There were no signs of life.
He sat back in his chair, watching Sherlock breathe--his chest rising and falling with a steady inevitability. He tried not to think about the scars, but it was like trying not to think about the elephant in the room.
Sherlock’s mouth twisted as he took his hands out of his pockets and rested them on the cool stone of the bridge balustrade, drumming his fingers a bit.
John’s eyes flicked downward, and Sherlock was suddenly extremely aware of John’s proximity. His heart started beating against his chest ferociously.
“Somehow, despite all odds, my wish came true.”
Sherlock knew every single thing about him, he always had. He had to know this too. So why hadn’t he ever acknowledged it, or even poked at it? His favorite pastime was to flay people open, show their greatest flaws.
Sherlock’s hesitation was like a physical presence. “But you said...you said you can’t take it…”
regret it.” John said it slowly, quietly, but with a full force of steel behind his tone.
,” John said sharply.
“Wait. Really?” the man on the screen said. “You’re taking my case?”
“By the closet,” he said.
“Yeah, she was going with him this semester, I think.”
Sherlock frowned. “Is that a problem?”
“During the fourth inning he went to the tenth row, then to the fifteenth row directly after, even though there were people in the intervening rows who wanted hot dogs. And during those rows he gets their change from his left pocket instead of his right, where he has been getting it from the rest of the time.”
The thing was...the thing was.
“So what was it?” Lestrade asked patiently.
“I know,” he whispered. As the words came out, he realized… that he did. He’d always known, in a way. He took a deep breath, feeling as if his whole life had been leading to this moment, his heart pounding.
John stared at the piece of paper in his hands. It was a particularly brilliant shade of blue, like the summer ocean under a sunny sky.
John cupped Sherlock’s cheek, and Sherlock closed his eyes as if savoring the feeling.
“Ignore all of that. It’s just the, er, the shock talking.” He slowly gets up and starts walking over towards the tape. His feet move automatically, as if he were magically drawn to the man on the other side.
“I should get going,” Sherlock says and places the empty mug in front of him.
“You think I’m a vicar with a bleeding face?”
“I’ll get her.”
“If it’s Lestrade, tell him I’m busy,” Sherlock shouts after her. He’s definitely not in the mood for a case or a pitying look from Greg. “And if it’s my brother, tell him to piss off,” he adds for good measure.
“Yes. I can’t wait for you to see mine,” John replies with a smirk. Sherlock doesn’t have the heart to tell him he already deduced it three weeks ago.
I head straight to the cemetery. The air has changed into a slight breeze, so I turn my coat collar up like Sherlock always does. He and his damn cheekbones. None of this would’ve happened if he weren’t so ignorant about other people’s feelings. And his own.
“Because there’s no need for forgiveness. God, look at us. We’re both such idiots!” John replies.
He steps back abruptly, making sure to be as quiet as possible. This is absolutely
“This one looks like a teddy bear,” Rosie said gesturing upwards with her tiny hand.
“Yeah, but I’ve made my peace with it. Honestly, once you move past the half-century mark nothing really scares you anymore,” Greg said chuckling.
At exactly five o’clock, the door rings. I open the door for Sherlock, who is wearing a black suit with a black shirt underneath and carrying a black leather bag in his hand.
He spends the rest of the train ride in silence, watching the landscape pass by. His mind feels numb, any memory too painful to provide a distraction. He can’t even escape to his mind palace, seeming as John already awaits him at the front door.
Yes. It was for the best. For both of their sakes and for Rosie’s.
When his phone buzzes, it’s already close to midnight.
John can’t help himself, he starts to giggle. Sherlock, quite surprisingly, joins him and together they laugh about the wild run across London they just shared.
“We need to find the monster, John!”
“I’m… I’m at home watching telly. What’s going on? You never call.”
“I’m sorry, should I come closer? I believe with old age comes bad vision,” Sherlock said and moved away from the doorframe and closer to John.
He pushes me down onto the sheets and crawls on top of me. His kisses wander from my mouth to my neck to my chest and keep going further down. Once he reaches my trousers, he stops. I tilt my head up and see the questioning expression on his face. I nod quickly and help him unbuckle my belt. Once my trousers are out of the way, Sherlock starts placing kisses down my cock.
“Sure,” he replies, placing the violin back in its case.
It had started about two months ago in June when Sherlock had received a telescope from one of their wealthier clients as a thank-you-for-saving-our-son’s-life gift. Although Sherlock had never been particularly interested in astronomy, John had convinced him to at least use the telescope once. They had been spending their Saturday evenings with piles of blankets and cushions on the rooftop ever since.
Sherlock enters the kitchen yawning. He’s still wearing his camel dressing gown. I hand him the mug and we sit down in our chairs.
His best friend arrived at his doorframe, leaned against it and, crossing his arms in front of his chest, nodded briefly. “There were no acceptable ones in your closet – so Rosie and I went shopping.”
it says. How strange. I decide to look him up on the internet. It might not be the worst idea to be at least partly prepared. I wonder what he does for a living, because he doesn’t appear to be a chemist or a doctor. The text has to be for someone who has the power to arrest people. Is he a policeman? He didn’t really seem like that, either. My internet search leads me to a website called
John slowly retrieves his hands from Sherlock before answering. “No, I’m sorry.”
“But I…”
He once heard word of a couple in Brighton who met in their late 70s, when their first spouses had already deceased. They found out because the man helped the woman out of the bus offering her his hand. Albeit being an inspiring love story, John refused to believe that the same would happen to him anytime soon. He started dating Mary, and they got along great. She made him laugh more than anyone and tried to understand the struggle of returning to civilian life after a period of war and danger. Gradually, they fell in love, not caring about the universe having different plans for their future. They only mentioned the fact that they’re non-persons once in their blossoming relationship, and never talked of it again.
I look at the watch and notice with disappointment that I need to get up for work in 5 minutes.
He states it matter-of-factly, probably not realising what the words do to John.
After Rosie’s breakfast we decide to leave for the park. It’s quite cold outside, but sunny, which is a nice replacement after all the rain in the last couple of days. Mrs. Hudson is visiting her sister, so she can’t come along. We walk to the park with Rosie in the stroller, and once we arrive Sherlock takes her directly to the swing. I watch them from the bench and smile every time Rosie giggles and pedals with her tiny feet. Sherlock pushes her and helps her down once she’s had enough. They play in the sand for a while and I join them. Even though it’s freezing outside, the sand is still ductile. Rosie and I build a sandcastle for Sherlock and bake sand cakes. When I can’t possibly bend my knees any longer, I return to the bench and watch Sherlock play with my daughter.
He walks in carefully, as if unsure whether he’s allowed to. His short blond-greyish hair forms a visual contrast to his black jacket and dark trousers, and he starts scanning the lab with his deep blue eyes. Sherlock doesn’t recall seeing him at Bart’s before, or anywhere else in London, for that matter. The man has something about him that Sherlock doesn’t think he’d forget.
I raise an eyebrow. “How could I talk him into that, exactly?”
“I didn’t see anything,” Sherlock says, emphasizing each syllable. His voice is colder than the crispy night air.
“This phone call – it’s, er ... it’s my note. It’s what people do, don’t they – leave a note?” Confusion but also a strange sense of familiarity. A note? What for? Sherlock, he never could understand people, perhaps it was because he had transcended them or perhaps it was his overbearing arrogance. But by now John has begun to feel just as clueless.
“There’s all the stuff, all the science equipment. I left it all in boxes. I don’t know what needs doing. I thought I’d take it to a school.“ Mrs hudson looks up at John expectantly but he has little reaction (other than a slight grimace) to her words. “Would you...?”
He lines the tip of the needle up with joint of his arm, ready to make an incision. He pushes the needle in and injects the high directly into his bloodstream with a sickening moan of delighted joy. His eyes roll back into his head with absolute and complete pleasure in that single moment.
“You're not okay.” She whispers one morning. John had fallen asleep with his scotch still in hand and now he is keeled over the toilet bowl with Mrs Hudson stood noticeably concerned in the doorway.
“Move on? I can't. He'll be back soon. Just you wait and see...”
He is itching but maybe his leg is just an excuse. He is itching for his next fix and suddenly he is propelled into his far less superior mind set of Sherlock. Sherlock craved a puzzle but John, John craves something far sweeter. He craves danger. The adrenaline. The blood pumping through his veins so loud he can hear his own heart beat... Bliss.
“How long were you going to keep that from me?”
“I bought it the other day at a shop.”
“What’s the date, John?”
“I was born in the late seventies, thank you very much.”
At that, Sherlock frowns at me. His eyes shine green in the candle light as he stares at me before answering. “Is that really what you think?”
Sherlock quickly ruffles his hands through his hair in order to get his thoughts straight. He glances back at the two men trying to catch up and can’t stop a grin from appearing on his face. How ridiculous. He continues down the steps and around the corner until he finally sees – an empty train station. A frustrated sigh escapes his lips when he hears John and Lestrade finally behind him.
“Yeah it would seem so,” I reply and return her smile. “I don’t take sugar in my coffee either.”
“Not a word.”
I hear a grunt from the living room. Sherlock is lying on the couch, in his thinking-position. He’s wearing a dressing gown over a shirt, one of the many things I’ve always found curious. Why wear a comfy dressing gown but keep the shirt underneath? He has his eyes closed and doesn’t open them when I enter.
Lestrade only stares at Sherlock and sighs.
“Is that so?” John feels the warmth in his chest slowly fading.
“It was lovely! I had a great time with my sister. But I’m glad to be back with little Rosie.”
“That your son has been at the inn for the last 24 hours? That your other son, I suppose illegitimate, wanted to kidnap Thomas and force you into changing your will? Or that it was our dear inn-keeper Mr. Hayes who actually did the kidnapping and murdered Mr. Heidegger?”
Inside, it’s colder than he expected, and it takes him a moment to adjust his vision. He can barely see Sherlock anymore, so he swims downward blindly. Once he reaches two white hands, he realises how pale Sherlock already is. He takes him by the arm and pushes them both upwards with all the force he can manage, desperately holding onto Sherlock. The water pushed aside from Sherlock’s body is turning an alarming shade of red. The way back up feels like an eternity, but finally he can see a shimmer of light from above. He pushes Sherlock through the little whole, hoping that he regains his consciousness sooner than later. From within the water, without any ground to support him, John can’t push Sherlock out of the way for him to exit, so all he can do is wait for Sherlock to do it on his own. Maybe he should have thought about this before jumping, but the prospect of dying wouldn’t have changed his actions either way.
John stared at it for a heartbeat before taking it. He could see the surprise on Sherlock’s face as well as the joy on Rosie’s and told himself that the latter was the reason for his action.
“Sherlock,” he shouted through the closed door, “is this a new one?!”
“John? I think Rosie is hungry.”
“We’ve had him in for questioning but he’s got an alibi. During the week, he’s always in Scotland and there he was when Jack Downing died. The man had no enemies. Honestly we all think it’s an accident; the mate couldn’t swim, it was dark, he was drunk and probably fell into the pond. I only asked you to confirm it so that we can convince the wife,” Lestrade continues.
“Are you still at Bart’s, then?” It’s the only thing that comes to my mind.
“You seem to have become a light-weight.”
She looks back at him worriedly. “Okay, what’s going on?”
Sherlock shot him a glance and John tried to shrug his shoulders apologetically without Rosie noticing, before crawling over towards them.
Sherlock leans forward slightly, studying John’s face for a while, making John self-conscious. “You don’t want to think of her right now, do you?”
“Shut up.”
“It’s Mary, please. You see, we both know that as his person, you’re meant to... spend time together. I know that being apart can cause distress and even sickness, and I don’t want to risk that happening to my husband. Therefore I think it’d be best if you two would see each other again. Maybe you’ll become friends – I’ve once heard of a similar case in Boston.”
He lets his back rest against the chair and listens to Sherlock telling him about the last time he was sick. He ends up staying the rest of the day, and only leaves after watching Sherlock sleep for half an hour.
“Oh come on, John. Don’t play stupid. It’s what you do all the time.”
Mary is off on a shopping spree with her girlfriends today, so John decided to spend the afternoon with Sherlock. After the evening in March where Sherlock accidentally bumped into him at the clinic, John has been helping Sherlock on most of his cases, even starting a blog about all the cases they solved together. Even though they both thought that the case of Irene Adler was solved two months ago, she appeared in Sherlock’s bed last Wednesday, wearing one of his dressing gowns. The sight bothered John more than he’d ever admit out loud.
“Do you think I’m blind, or dumb, or both? Do you think I missed the pining stares you threw Sherlock’s way whenever you thought he wasn’t looking? I know you, John, better than anyone. You fell in love with him long ago, it just took you a while to realise it. You and I are no different!”
“I think I’ll leave you boys alone,” she says and closes the door behind her.
Upon first glance, the carriage seems empty but Sherlock quickly discovers the batches of explosives under the seat cushions and the loose floor panel with the main bomb underneath. Apparently, Sherlock was wrong. The carriage isn’t merely filled with explosives, the whole compartment
“Well, good night, John.”
“Do you mind if I look around for a bit?” He grins one of his fake smiles and starts pacing the flat once our client gives a short nod. Mr. Simon and I stay seated on the couch, his eyes still teary. After a couple of minutes, Sherlock seems to have found what he was looking for, and he returns to the living room with gleaming eyes.
Sherlock was already halfway out of the door when he turned back. “John? We’ll figure it all out, as we always have.”
0.8%.
John slowly takes a deep breath; he can do this, he is a soldier after all. He dealt with things far worse than giant pets in Afghanistan and, frankly, in London, ever since meeting his madman. Cautiously, he walks towards the source of the sound, tightening his grip on the flashlight. He circulates a massive tree and finds himself amidst a couple of smaller bushes. From his current position, he can see a flash of lights going on and off in the distance. What the bloody hell is going on? Is this Morse code? John decides to retrieve his notebook and starts scribbling down the transcription just to be sure.
“Have you ever had anyone?” Irene asks.
“And then I told her I’d be staying in London this year; that I’d be spending the holidays with you, and you know what she did? She hung up on me!”
“You don’t actually think I’d walk around wearing a plastic ring for four weeks, do you? Besides, we still had the pay-check from Mr. Myles lying around.”
“What do you think?” I ask. Now he definitely understood. I smile contently.
Later that day, Sherlock and John share a comfortable silence while hiding in a bush close to the inn. After Sherlock and John had successfully climbed over the gate to look at the horse’s hooves, a suspicion arose inside of him. The hooves showed clear evidence of recent shoeing, but with old shoes and new nails. As Sherlock was just about to decide on how to take a hoof-print of the animal, Mr. Hayes arrived and demanded them to leave. Even though John assured Sherlock that that was a completely normal reaction, Sherlock still found his mere shouting irritating. They spent the rest of the day wandering around town to gather further information, without success.
“Phone her, meet her, or something.”
“There’s one thing I’d like to know, though. How did it feel?”
The interior of the flat is surprisingly luxurious. We sit down on a huge leather couch while Mr. Simon serves us tea.
“It’s okay if you don’t have anything for me, Sherlock. Really, it’s not that big a deal.” John takes Sherlock’s hand into his own.
“I don’t mind,” I say, but Sherlock is already focusing on the Science magazine in his lap.
“And frankly a bloody awful cabbie,” John replies.
“I heard you were abroad somewhere, getting shot at. What happened?” I can’t help but stare at him for a moment. What does he want me to say?
“Sorry, that was me.” He grins at Sherlock.
“Sherlock, is that...?”
“And what did Molly reply?”
“– Mary, you’re up!” he interrupts.
“I have no idea,” Sherlock admits.
“Yes, we should. I’ll give you a call when I’m in town. Bye, John!”
“Mmmm,” Sherlock hummed. “That it is. Good thing I put up the mistletoe, isn’t it?”
John swallowed, doing the math in his head. Chi might not have enough time to make them all, if the projected amount of time she had left on the chart was accurate.
“What’s wrong with you?” John took a couple of steps toward his bedside.
It took a good three hours for him to finish and post it. He made himself some tea and a sandwich, then went back to sit in his chair and read, enjoying the fresh air coming in through the window.
John’s heart fluttered in his chest. “You do?”
“I have something for you,” John whispered, licking into his mouth as he stroked Sherlock’s cock, tantalizingly slow.
Sherlock shrugged. “Semantics."
43 cranes
things.
Sherlock’s eyes, which were strangely luminous in the half light, were darting all over John’s face, and he knew that he was being scrutinized. “That’s why I relapsed, John. I couldn’t. I just couldn’t.
“I wouldn’t dream of it,” John said, keeping his face blank.
“Wait, so they’re going to kill more people?” John interrupted.
Fighting his impulse to simply cuss at Sherlock some more, John backed up as far as he could and made a running leap onto the other side. His foot landed right on the edge of the ledge, and he started slipping backward.
“Something to do with the letters and the numbers from the office,” Sherlock muttered.
He got up and strode through the ensuite door to the bathroom, grabbing his medical kit and walking back into Sherlock’s room.
“Sorry, it’s just… sodding hypocrites.”
Pressing his lips together, Sherlock glanced down at the body again, then over at the shoreline. “Pink,” he muttered. Without another word, he turned and walked out toward the water.
John rolled his eyes, but said nothing. They lay there for a few more minutes, listening to the sound of the rain outside.
“Please don’t stop,” Sherlock whispered against his lips, his hands fisting in John’s jumper.
“Thanks for the jumper, I’ll return it soon,” John called over his shoulder, trotting down the stairs and out the door before he could be waylaid any further.
“Yeah, right,” John said dryly, unbuttoning Sherlock’s sopping wet shirt and taking it off. Hesitating slightly, he reached to undo Sherlock’s trousers and pulled them down. Once Sherlock was only in his pants, John helped him into bed and under the covers.
Sherlock rolled his eyes again in the ‘
“John, I’m sorry, I… I can’t,” Sherlock panted, his eyes leaking, his whole body shaking.
The echoing footsteps faded away, and the door opened and closed once more. Then there was only silence.
John explained the basics of the game as the warm-ups concluded.
“Very well. Just don’t ruin the furniture. Or what’s left of it.” Neither of them moved as her footsteps faded away again.
, John thought. He nodded, just a small tilt of his head.
Mostly because he couldn’t think of an alternative other than running out the door, (which could mean that John might never talk to him again), Sherlock moved his arm from his eyes.
“Sherlock, are you okay?” John asked tentatively.
are of no consequence, so I delete them.”
“Of-of course it’s… I… you have no idea how long…” Sherlock stuttered.
“Silly?”
“I don’t think I can handle you inside me after last night, as much as I want to. It’s been a while and I’m a bit sore,” Sherlock said, continuing his ministrations. “But we can do... other things.”
“What?” he asked.
“John, John,
“John--” Sherlock started.
, Sherlock."
Sherlock waved a hand dismissively. “I get a special deal from the landlady. Next objection?”
“What?”
“Not like that,” Sherlock said, sipping from John’s lips again. “I just mean. I feel so much it’s like I can’t contain it. I…” he swallowed. “I’m not...used to this.”
John took the penlight out of his kit and held Sherlock’s eyelids back, one at a time, to flash the light into them. They were equal and reactive, though a bit more dilated and glassier than usual.
“Oh.” John said, unable to form more words than that.
“Yes,” Sherlock said. “Much later. After we’ve shagged two, maybe three more times.”
Sherlock pressed his lips together. “I...” he said, feeling himself falter slightly. “Um.”
John followed him down the walkway, wondering what he’d gotten himself into this time. As per usual, Sherlock had only explained the broad strokes of the case to him, leaving out the details, which was aggravating to say the least. Still, John was tingling with anticipation and excitement at the prospect of a case in a far-off country. He’d been to the states a few times, but never to New England.
When he glanced over at the living room, Sherlock was no longer on the sofa and the loo door was closed. John smirked, shaking his head. Sherlock might try to feign nonchalance, but he actually loved Christmas and being surrounded by the people who cared about him.
John looked up at him incredulously.
“Of course it is. Well, it was. They never found anything of consequence, because the most important item was already gone when they arrived.”
“Sod the tea.”
Wishing he could turn and run out the doors, John made his way over to a seat on the edge of the first row and quickly sat down.
“It’s snowing.” His voice was muffled into John’s neck.
John rolled his eyes. “Of course I did. I just didn’t think you wanted…”
The man continued to watch him for a long moment without saying anything. John raised his eyebrows expectantly.
Sherlock swallowed, his throat working. “Pulse, elevated. Pupils, dilated.”
“Thank you for the tea, Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock said placidly, not looking up from the microscope.
He looked up at the ceiling, at the hundreds of brightly colored cranes up above. He counted them one more time, even though he had already done it half a dozen times, just to be sure. There were nine hundred and ninety-nine.
Sherlock nodded, the ghost of a smile passing over his lips. “There's another possibility: chemical inhalation. See these skin irritations?”
John felt his forehead, but he still felt very warm. “I have some soup heating up in the kitchen, I’ll be right back.”
John bit his bottom lip, releasing it again. “Do you…” The question, unfinished, hung between them. It had been suspended in the air for the entire time they’d known each other, hovering like a glittering mirage on the horizon.
“No?” John chuckled, his hand still moving up Sherlock’s cock lazily.
“More,” Sherlock breathed. John obeyed, adding a finger, still bobbing up and down. He worked Sherlock’s hole long enough that he could press in three, and Sherlock moaned loudly. John didn’t stop sucking Sherlock’s cock as he pushed his fingers in and out in long strokes, brushing against Sherlock’s prostate. Sherlock was losing himself already, unable to speak, unable to tell John to stop.
“What’s it to you?”
John wheeled her to the curb as her father was bringing the car around.
“Did you mean it?” Sherlock asked, his voice so quiet that only John could hear.
John sighed, putting his tea down and sliding back down to rest his head on his pillow. “I accept your apology, Sherlock.”
“I’m not going to argue with you about this—”
“Drowning?” John asked tentatively.
John kissed him slowly, with purpose, skimming his hands up Sherlock’s back under his shirt, making him shiver. It was like he’d forgotten how to do this entirely; he couldn’t quite remember how to breathe through his nose, and he couldn’t stop kissing Sherlock long enough to inhale properly. He wanted more friction, more of Sherlock’s body pressed against him.
“Sh—Sher—” he tried to say, but Sherlock was doing some extremely clever things with his tongue and it was hard to get a coherent thought together.
“Alright,” the man said, sending whatever it was he’d been typing. He glanced up, and their eyes met briefly before sharp greyish-green irises flicked over John’s whole body as his lips quirked upward on one side into a smug-looking half-grin.
know about the drinking?”
John clamped down on that thought just as it crossed his mind, stuffed it into a tiny box, and exiled it to the far back of his mind.
“She might have had a pre-existing skin condition,” Anderson snapped.
John hesitated before he obeyed, then reached over to turn off the tap.
–” John was still standing in the doorway.
“You don’t seem very afraid,” the man said eventually.
“Ah.”
” John shrugged noncommittally, knowing that his attempt at deflection was feeble at best.
“You’re. You’re under the...”
“Mr. Hatayama, all due respect—” he began.
“I'm investigating," he said slowly, as if John were daft. "I want to be a consulting detective, solving crimes. I invented the job.”
the idiot? I wasn’t the one who got myself beaten up and now can’t even remember
“I deduced it."
John frowned. “What, was it your old flatmate’s or something?"
She stuck the spoon in her mouth, looking at them with wide blue eyes.
Sherlock started to play a more jaunty tune, and everyone refilled their glasses. Eventually, about an hour later, the evening was coming to a close.
“But—” the woman started to interrupt.
John frowned. “I was… I don’t know.”
“You let me… I…” He had punched Sherlock over and over again, wrestling him to the floor onto his back. He must have ripped these wounds open anew, and Sherlock hadn’t said anything.
John almost jumped at the voice, its tenor so fragile that he barely heard it.
Mrs. Hudson put her glass in the sink. “I’ll help clean up in the morning, dears.”
John’s stomach dropped out. He had suspected it, he’d known it, even, deep down--but he hadn’t really let himself fully grasp it. They hadn’t talked about that day, not really, because
Sherlock felt his orgasm cresting, and he tilted his hips up even more with John’s every movement, trying to get more of John, even though there was no more to be had.
Sherlock stopped pacing and looked at him incredulously, but within seconds his lips started curling upward into an answering smile.
to escape, I just, I thought maybe… I don’t know, I thought it might be… fun?”
“Ah, should have guessed it, it’s all in the shoulders,” Lestrade said.
.” He frowned. That wasn’t really what he’d meant to say.
John hesitated. It would be best for him to take off his clothes, too, and warm Sherlock with his body heat. They had already shared a bed, technically, but this felt like crossing some kind of line.
It felt as though he were becoming unspooled, like someone had started pulling the thread of his being and he was unraveling. Flashes, memories, paraded in front of him one by one.
After they’d realized they were pregnant, John had...well. He’d gotten a bit distracted. But then after a dance or two, he’d looked around, and in an instant he’d realized that Sherlock was no longer there. The look in Sherlock’s eyes had been one of such visceral pain, that he’d known deep down what Sherlock had gone off to do.
John panted, looking at him, and Sherlock grinned as he unzipped the trousers. His curly head dipped down as he nuzzled at the outline of John’s cock, and then kissed it open-mouthed, his breath hot even through the cotton pants.
“Is that a good idea?” John asked.
John burst into another fit of giggles, and as he looked up into those eyes that were so complex, and yet so achingly vulnerable, it felt like he’d found something he’d always been searching for, something dangerous and exciting and
He’d had the same one over and over again since he’d moved back into Baker Street. His subconscious carried him to a place where he could finally feel Sherlock’s naked body arching elegantly underneath him, his pale cheeks flushed as John thrust into him deeply. John always awoke from the dream alone in his bed, rock hard and with a deep sense of loss.
“Not even a little bit,” John said. “This means that we can try out that jacuzzi, too.”
He’d been more afraid of losing Sherlock in that moment than he had Mary. When he’d seen the barrel of a gun pointed at Sherlock...it was like seeing his worst fear realized for the third time.
Sherlock sniffed, and his head disappeared.
“What do you want, John?” Sherlock asked, voice soft.
When Sherlock finished the piece, the room was silent for a long moment.
“I have to get to another lecture—” John began to protest.
“Yeah,” John said, finally, his mouth feeling so dry he tried to swallow twice. “Yeah, I did. Don’t you… don’t you know?”
John dropped his hand to the comforter. “One?” His voice had reached a higher decibel than it ever had before.
“So?” John was getting tired of constantly feeling one step behind.
“Are you angry?” Sherlock gasped, lifting his hips up into John’s movements.
The back of his legs hit the bed, and he was forced to sit down, jolting them apart.
John snapped back to look at him. “
John raised his head to look into Sherlock’s eyes. After all this time, he was finally going to say it, for real.
The man caught up with him easily, probably due to his ridiculously long legs. “Ah yes, of course, first year law student, trying to get through briefing the cases for your Criminal Law class. You are on a full scholarship, but you need to keep your grades up to a certain level in order to keep it.”
He trudged down the street in the fading light, hands stuffed in his pockets and his shoulders hunched. Sherlock was obviously not interested in him, and he was pining away like some kind of an idiot. Try as he might, though, it seemed to be impossibly hard to forget about him.
“No, John,” Sherlock interrupted. “I’m just...I’ve never told you. I want to...I
John looked up in slight disbelief for a moment, then shook his head and started climbing up the ladder after him. By the time he’d made it halfway up, Sherlock was already disappearing over the ledge in a swish of his coat.
“Here,” Sherlock said, handing John one of the glasses.
Sherlock’s mouth twitched. “That’s it? Okay? I was hoping you’d at least favor me with an ‘adequate.’”
.” John’s gaze snapped up to meet the professor’s. She was looking at him above her horn-rimmed glasses, obviously piqued.
“That was just
As he brushed his teeth, John thought about Sherlock’s expression when he had asked whether anyone had ever told him that he snored, and couldn’t help wondering if that meant Sherlock had never slept next to someone before.
John sat at the bar, drinking his third glass of whiskey. He had gotten there early on purpose, because he needed to numb himself a bit. It wasn’t really working.
"But it wasn't found on the body, Lestrade?"
“Hmm,” John hummed, running his thumb along the slickness of Sherlock’s lower lip. “I was hoping to take you back to that hotel room and break in that bed properly.”
There was another long pause. Then Sherlock moved even closer, close enough that if John shifted, they’d be pressed together, chest to thigh.
“Did she know Carl?” Sherlock interrupted.
, as you so eloquently described him. Unfortunately, I was caught. I might have escaped relatively unscathed if I had not deduced that he and his friend have been shagging each other for the past two months. When I pointed it out, they were less than pleased. ”
“No,” she said thoughtfully, “It wasn’t me.”
“Don’t tell me what I do or don’t want to do.”
Sherlock cleared his throat. “Since you moved back in, things haven’t been.” He sighed, leaning his forearms against the stone and hanging his head slightly. “I feel like we haven’t gotten back to… the way we once were. I was hoping that if we went somewhere together, it might. We could,” Sherlock stuttered, much more inarticulate than usual.
John narrowed his eyes. “What are you talking about?”
Sherlock’s head fell back into the bed. “John,” he gasped. “John, I’m—”
Sherlock waved his hand in a dismissive gesture. “Take it. Its previous owner wants nothing to do with it—or me—as of last week. It’s yours.”
John told the cabbie the address, glancing nervously over at Sherlock again. “You still haven’t actually told me how you ended up in a dark alley, being beaten to a pulp by a meathead.”
John set the plates on the table, looking at Sherlock out of the corner of his eye. He was wearing a deep wine-red shirt and a black suit, and his hair was tousled in a way that John now knew was artfully done, not accidental. He looked beautiful. But then, he always did.
On that sunny day in June, though, John wished that he had had some luck to fall back on. He wondered if all the bad luck he’d accumulated over his entire lifetime had somehow culminated in this one tragedy, this one event. Now he couldn’t undo all the times he’d walked past black cats or under ladders. He could only stand at the grave, shaking, trying to keep his fist clenched so that it wouldn’t tremble.
“Tell that to the police,” Sherlock replies coldly and dials the number of the incompetent officer from the first day. He looks over to John who is still watching him.
“What are we even celebrating tonight?” John asked while unbuttoning his current shirt.
“Might be hungry.”
“I wouldn’t say close.”
I can’t hide my astonishment. Is that really so surprising to him? Doesn’t he remember what we’ve been through? Doesn’t he know how much I value him? Should I have mentioned it more in the past?
“So, gentlemen, where shall I drop you off?” the cab driver asks.
“We should talk about this,” I start.
“...John? I was just talking to him.”
But John slowly shakes his head, taking the ring out of the box and sliding it onto his ring finger without hesitance. The tension finally leaves Sherlock’s body.
John and Sherlock raised their heads simultaneously, but whilst Sherlock nodded in agreement, John shook his head vehemently.
“Daddy, didn’t I do a good job?”
John doesn’t have time to be confused right now – he’s already late for the date.
“Oh, what now? I’m in shock! Look, I’ve got a blanket. And I just caught you a serial killer... more or less.”
“No, no, no, Mr. Holmes, you’re not the one allowed to ask questions here. I’d say you should’ve brought your pet. What’s his name again? Dr. Watson, if I remember correctly from the papers. You and your person got yourselves a reputation.”
At home I make myself some dinner. I actually stopped ordering every evening like I used to do with Sherlock, it’s cheaper that way. I don’t see him again during the evening. After dinner, I keep pacing through the living room. I’ve had an idea a couple of weeks ago, but I wasn’t really sure whether to put it into action so far. Today seems like the perfect occasion to get started, though. I was sorting through some of my old boxes, the ones that I still hadn’t gone through after I moved out of Baker Street. In one of them, I found all of my old notes - some bills, some recipes from Mrs. Hudson when she told us we couldn’t eat Chinese for the rest of our lives, but mainly notes on Sherlock’s cases. I read through them and saw Sherlock as soon as I was finished. He looked at me a bit curiously but also expectantly, I can’t remember ever seeing this look on him when he was alive. I sorted through the notes and actually found a couple of interesting ones, ones that I could probably write up on the blog.
John can practically feel Sherlock furrowing his eyebrows. “You’re about to go on a date, you should at least wear a shirt.”
On the plus side, they – or rather Sherlock – finally solved the case. As usual, he was able to put the pieces together using his mind palace. Apparently Bob Franklyn, a scientist at Baskerville who participated in a secret military project called ‘The  HOUND Project’ some twenty years ago, used a drug to fill Henry’s heart with fear after killing his father. The project, in trying to create an anti-personnel weapon to use against American enemies, accidentally created a drug causing hallucinations, paranoia and frontal lobe damages, amongst other things. The experiment was dismissed, much to the displeasure of the enthusiastic Bob Franklyn, who decided to continue working on the drug on British grounds.
“But you don’t... do that.”
“I’m sorry, mate, no civilians today,” the officer says. His grey hair is sticking out in several directions and John figures that he’s probably got better things to do right now, but his voice is polite nonetheless.
“Murder, of course,” he states matter-of-factly. “Have you been following the news lately? There has been a string of ‘suicides’ in London, at least according to the police and the public. Even though Scotland Yard tried their best to shut their eyes from the truth, it has been clear to me from the start that they are dealing with homicides. With this one there was found a note, apparently, and that’s why we’re here. So, will you help me?”
John smiles at Sherlock and replies “I know,” before he turns around and leaves.
“Well, somebody has to,” Sherlock says, giving John a look of incomprehension.
They briefly stared into each other’s eyes and John tried to ask Sherlock for permission non-verbally, when Sherlock closed his eyes and lightly pressed his lips against John’s. The kiss was a soft, warm brush of lips and John felt like he was jumping out of an airplane, knowing that he would never hit the ground again.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, he clearly doesn’t want to talk about it. I should probably let it rest. It’s not like he owes me an explanation, or anything. I’ve been a shitty best friend lately, as a look into his eyes painfully reminds me.
