It was a relief that, no matter how much they could dirty or even damage their clothes and shoes at nights, whilst performing some tasks, the next night, when they transformed, everything was clean and intact, and their faces, hair, moustaches and beards were well-groomed again, or their faces were perfectly smooth, like Sherlock’s. With his experiments that could get messy at times, it was more than a little helpful. Not only hygienic procedures would have been problematic for a human, but they would’ve also been time-consuming. Sherlock decided to spare his mind from trying to solve something as illogical as this. This mystery couldn’t be solved, just like many other things that had happened to him throughout the years. He hated unsolved mysteries, but when magic was the answer to them, he preferred to stay away.
. How could Sherlock make him choose, even if the Prince ever developed similar feelings for him? No, Sherlock couldn’t make John abandon his life for him. He didn’t want John to end up regretting anything or feeling like he’d been used just to break the spell. At the same time, if he told him the truth, if he confessed that his, Sherlock’s, life depended on him now, John, honourable, caring, chivalrous John, would’ve felt obligated to save him and do whatever it took. There was also a small possibility the Prince would’ve been secretly disappointed in him for putting him into that kind of situation, because he would’ve had to abandon everything he had known, including his country, to be with someone who depended on him to the point they couldn’t live without him. It was very much like an emotional blackmail he just couldn’t stoop to. He knew he could use that tactics, even with John sometimes, without much guilt, but only when it came to something small and rather insignificant on a larger scale;
Deep inside, he kept waiting for Mycroft to at least visit him again, but his secret wish never came true. Mycroft had said good-bye. It felt wrong that someone as meddling as his brother would just leave Sherlock like that.
A couple of years later, when Sherlock was thirty-five, the flock welcomed new members. It was unexpected, since Moriarty hadn’t brought anyone new for quite a long time, and here he’d brought, not one, but three new humans turned into swans for his damned collection. Answering the perplexed looks of his elder prisoners, he said that the flock needed some young blood, as the majority of them would be middle-aged soon and some, technically, already were. ‘Not that there’s anything wrong about it’, he quickly assured.
He loved his girl. Just one glance at that sonogram before passing it to Sherlock had told the detective all he needed to know, not that he’d had any doubts before. In fact, the knowledge was the reason Sherlock had been so determined to convince John to come back to his wife, instead of letting his own jealousy and selfishness rule him. John deserved better.
When the anger was gone, there was just exhaustion left. He hoped nothing bad had happened to John. Other than that, it would’ve probably been for the best if his beloved friend lost interest and stopped visiting. Archie’s brown eyes followed him worriedly, and Sherlock knew he was being obvious.
People were superstitious; there were all sorts of rumours he could hear being discussed among the servants. But he didn’t believe in anything paranormal. There were different ways of watching someone: for example, via other people, who were your eyes and ears, or by using special devices, or by disguising yourself so well that people failed to notice you. Sherlock was paying attention to everything around him to find out what was wrong, but there was nothing helpful so far, no evidence that someone was watching him at all. He knew it was there, nonetheless. He didn’t believe in any ‘sixth sense’ either, especially given the fact that people had much more than five senses, and all of them were real; such as the sense of balance, the ability to feel low and high temperatures, the sensitivity to pain and so on (he couldn’t remember where he had learned those things). It was science, something you could prove; but, no, people chose to believe in some ridiculous concepts. There must have been some clue he had registered subconsciously that made him aware of being under someone’s observation. He felt uneasy and his own inability to solve the mystery was getting on his nerves.
With John, however, everything was better. One of the books the Prince had given him was on the recent history. It described many political events, which wasn’t something Sherlock usually found interesting, but he wanted to be informed, regardless. To his delight, the book described the ‘possible’ murder of a Spanish nobleman, which was something that had caused a lot of speculations, but, eventually, had been laid to rest, sometime after the man’s body had got the same treatment. Illness was proclaimed an official cause of death, but the described symptoms of the supposed illness and the way he had died, told Sherlock what poison had been used, and he had some ideas on where it could have been obtained by the man’s ‘loving and grieving’ son, returned from a journey a couple of months prior to his father’s death, according to the book that mentioned it briefly. There wasn’t enough data, but there were a few more small clues in the text that pointed in the direction of the murdered man’s son. He shared it with John, who lavishly praised him and, together, they wrote a letter with Sherlock’s detailed observations to a man, whom the book described as one of the investigators of that particular murder. From what little information Sherlock had, he’d come to a conclusion that that man was less stupid than his colleagues. Sherlock didn’t outright accuse the nobleman’s son, but he gave detailed instructions on what to look for to confirm his guilt (or disprove, which, in this case, was highly unlikely).
‘True. I can tell my preferable activities are not a secret for anybody’, he smiled at the woman again.
‘Hounds then…’ The silence that followed was awkward and the stranger was the first one to break it. ‘Do you live somewhere nearby?’
‘Is it too bold of me to hope that we can still be friends?’ he suddenly asked, turning his face back to Sherlock, his voice unwavering and steady, akin to his hands when he shot.
‘It must be overwhelming to have a mind as great as yours’. The Prince’s smile and praise made Sherlock’s breath hitch in his chest. His face and neck were getting warmer.
Through the multi-layered veil of haze and nothingness, he imagined hearing John’s voice. From an old, lingering memory, perhaps. His John… No, not his. Never his.
‘You’re wearing a crown’, the boy noted levelly. In truth, Sherlock had tried to get rid of it twice, just taking it off and leaving it on the altar (the second time he’d just discarded it in the forest, as an experiment), but, as soon as he had turned into a swan, the smaller phantom version of it was back on his head. The next night, as a human, he’d had that same coronet on his head again. He only disliked it because of the fact that Moriarty had given it to him, but he had to admit it looked good on him, and he had grown to treat it as nothing more than a fancy piece of jewellery. He also had to admit he was a bit vain, even though it didn’t make sense here.
He couldn’t help thinking that, if their situation was different, they could’ve had plenty of adventures together; it could’ve been an interesting life. The world out there had a lot of mysteries they would’ve been able to enjoy solving together. Sherlock would’ve tried his best to provide all the thrill and danger John, obviously, loved.
He huffed with impatience, waiting for the music to start playing, and his annoyance was gone the moment the first composition started to fill the room. Satisfied with the volume level, he proceeded to prepare the new dose of gear and administered it, whilst making himself comfortable on the sofa. Maybe this time he was finally going to see the Mind Palace version of John again. He felt himself smiling, almost becoming one with the soft piece of furniture, letting his body relax and letting the music in. Only his fingers were twitching faintly for a while, as some sort of muscle memory of performing the currently playing piece on the violin. There was a, rapidly slipping away, part of his mind that knew that he’d overdosed this time. He could still hear the music, but it was becoming more and more distant now, even though it felt like it was inside him, saturating his very being.
He tried to find any connection between all of them. Shouldn’t there be a reason Moriarty chose to abduct them for this bizarre collection of his? But there wasn’t any. They had been just some random young people. From what he had heard and deduced, he could conclude that most of them had very different backgrounds, even though they were all from the European continent. Some of them had been born to rather prosperous families, and, at first, Sherlock thought that that was what made them have something in common, but, very soon, he realised that there were also two common villagers from rather poor families and one young son of a street musician, who used to dance for next to nothing. There was a daughter of a tailor from Portugal; the family had been neither poor, nor rich.
When the Queen asked him whether he was getting ready to the ball and how it was going, he just shrugged absent-mindedly and replied that everything was being prepared without him anyway and there was no point or need for his participation. She seemed a little upset by his reaction, not his words, as she knew he could be quite bad-tempered at times, but by his mood in general. Bill was a little worried as well, but he knew well enough when John shouldn’t be bothered, even with good intentions.
It was obvious he was dying to ask plenty of questions that kept piling since the moment he’d met Sherlock, but John, being a perceptive person, had refrained from asking those questions before, as if he could feel Sherlock’s discomfort and him not being ready to talk about himself. He wondered if he was making a grave mistake by trusting a man he barely knew. Ridiculous. He was trying to console himself with the fact that he was doing it partly because it was best to tell the truth before the obviously curious man started snooping about. Sherlock could’ve pretended that, if he started acting like John had overstayed his welcome, it would’ve actually made him leave and never come back, but he could tell that John was a person who’d want to investigate after encountering so many odd things at once. He was trustworthy and had strong moral principles, as Sherlock had deduced earlier, but, even so, it was none of his concern and the swan didn’t have to share anything with him or anybody else for that matter. It was his own life and tragedy. Why would he let anybody into something so personal? And yet…
‘And why not, especially when there's so much to tell?' the woman sighed wistfully. 'I’m Mary’, she introduced herself after a pause, just as he was about to ask her name. It was nice that she wasn’t expecting him to know her name by learning everyone’s names and tittles
No, they weren’t held captive for some sort of ransom, which he, at first, had hoped for (his family would’ve undoubtedly paid to get him back and this nightmare would’ve been over), they were just a private collection of a sick man with magical powers. And, somehow, Sherlock knew that, for some reason, he was the main item of said collection.
‘John, I know you’re not at all enthusiastic about becoming King, but even you should admit that it’s time for you to settle down’, she started after a long pause. He opened his mouth to say something, but she interrupted him before he’d had a chance to: ‘No objections, young man. You boys only want to fight wars far away from home and fool about when you’re back, only to find another reason to go back to fighting or travelling. You’ve been helping me with our royal duties a lot, since you were a boy, but you’re forty-three now and I’m still a Regent. I’ve waited long enough, wanted you to have your adventures and everything you like so much. But the kingdom needs its King… and a new Queen. I’m surprised we’ve managed to keep things together for so long without a monarch, whose rule would never be questioned by anyone’.
That was it. He was going to take a brief look at that chapel and see what Mycroft wanted him to see, even though he was completely uninterested. And then he’d finally end this pointless existence. He was long overdue. He wouldn’t experiment with any plants, he wouldn’t risk getting himself severely injured, but not killed, by throwing himself down from the height. Hounds were the guaranteed way to die. It would be painful and terrifying, but he no longer cared. They would tear at his body, shaking and tousling it. That was how they killed. He had deduced it from the minuscule remains of the killed swan, – a
As anyone would expect, Sherlock was hiding under the roots, in his own time-tested hiding place that kept him dry. He could see the shivering cygnet from there and it just didn’t sit well with him. He ended up calling the boy, who hesitantly left his useless ‘shelter’ and clumsily, due to the wind, started moving towards the crowned swan, whom he could barely see from the outside, but certainly knew where he was. When the cygnet was at the roots and could peek inside the shelter, he looked at the adult swan questioningly. Without saying anything, Sherlock raised his wing in invitation for Archie to get underneath it and hide there. He wasn’t too young and small of a swanling, but there was enough room under an adult swan’s wing to shelter him. The cygnet shook some water off of himself before getting into the hideout and, just as wordlessly, made himself comfortable at Sherlock’s side before the older swan lowered the wing, hiding the boy snuggly underneath, so he was practically wrapped up by Sherlock’s body from all sides. The older swan felt the cygnet squirming slightly and curling up before relaxing into the warmth, his shivering abated soon enough, as he was getting dry and warm. Sherlock himself needed some time to get used to the contact before relaxing as well. The silent comfort worked both ways. It was good, for once, to have a kindred spirit so close and to let the sounds of rain lull him into slumber. Soon enough, they were both asleep.
Bill Murray, on the other hand, was John’s loyal companion during his time away. The redhead had been by John’s side in almost every military campaign the Prince had ever been a part of (sometimes pretending to be commoners, unbeknownst to the other soldiers). Many of those campaigns had also allowed John to use his knowledge of medicine, which had earned him a lot of respect, apart from him being an excellent bowman. Bill
‘Sherlock?’ He was brought back out of his thoughts by John’s voice. ‘You seemed so far away. Are you sure you’re feeling better now?’
Slowly and hesitantly, he turned to leave. A few times, he looked back, as he was walking away, in case Sherlock needed a convenient excuse to change his mind and forgive John, but the younger man never emerged from behind the tree.
Alas, there was a good chance the insane genius had run out of miracles. John, however, wasn’t about to give up on him.
Devastated, he returned to the lake. As soon as the others saw him, all their hopefulness was gone. He was grateful that, at least, nobody said or asked him anything. He knew he would’ve snapped. The atmosphere itself was depressing, and everyone was quiet and sombre.
He’d given Mary every excuse his deductive skills could provide. He hadn’t been lying, he’d just been voicing the truths selectively. He intentionally shut his eyes to certain things, such as some of Mary’s remarks that were, not quite openly, cruel and insensitive, whilst looking like innocent jokes to laugh off and dismiss. He couldn’t tell if her occasional passive-aggressive behaviour was deliberate or natural, and thus, wasn’t supposed to be taken personally, but rather had to be treated as her individual peculiarity instead. Some people would’ve seen those things as so-called red flags, but that just didn’t matter. Sherlock was hardly the nicest, most thoughtful person either; he could be cruel and brutally sarcastic, deliberately or otherwise, so he couldn’t blame her for the attitude she displayed now and then. She was capable of rousing interest in someone attracted to danger, but did not pose a threat to John, personally. And she was making John happy most of the time. John deserved to be happy. The complete absence of romantic relationships and interest in creating a family were in Sherlock’s nature, not John’s. If the doctor was no longer capable of fully trusting Mary (the main reason was her shooting Sherlock, rather than her past), it didn’t mean he didn’t want a family and a daughter, who was soon to be born.
He kept filling his friend’s lungs with air and compressing his chest in hopes to restart the heart, as he had been trained to, as he had done before; not always successfully, because things didn’t always depend on a doctor, regardless of how skilful and experienced they were.
‘All right’, the man agreed. Sherlock went slightly farther into the chapel, looking over his shoulder now and then, to be absolutely certain he wasn’t in any danger, despite his earlier deductions. At the same time, it wasn’t easy to stay alert, because there was something about the man that made Sherlock feel safe after their short talk alone. He stopped at the hearth that he’d made years back and had been using since then. Normally, everything he needed for making fire was prepared beforehand, and tonight wasn’t an exception. It was a habit he’d gradually developed throughout the years, and it was something he and Archie took care of most nights, shortly before their transformation back into swans.
'There were royals and those who accompanied them from Hungary, Russia, Spain, Naples and Poland...' In this particular order dancers usually perform in the ballet when the royal guests are presented to the Prince.
‘But why?’ John frowned a bit, genuinely surprised, as if Sherlock was made to be praised and admired and there was no other way. The dark-haired man felt his heart beating faster at that.
He was a little afraid to hope that his family would find and rescue him. There were other ‘swans’ from rich, very influential and powerful families, but nobody had come for them so far. One of the few youths was the only son of a powerful and respected French Marshal, but even that made no difference. Sherlock didn’t have enough evidence, but he believed that, at least, the majority of the abducted youngsters had been good looking or even beautiful. But, as they had been turned into swans, it no longer mattered anyway, so the theory didn't work.
Mycroft took off his embroidered velvet beret and held it close to his chest, still facing the lake. Sherlock was suddenly chilled to the bone by the gesture. What was that?! Was Mycroft mourning him? But he was alive! Sherlock slightly raised his wings helplessly. He then bit Mycroft’s calf, which earned him a glare, as Mycroft finally turned his face to him. The older man’s expression softened, though.
‘Our Prince John is a romantic’, Bill smiled with mock coquettishness. ‘He would prefer to marry for love’.
Apparently, those who had been waiting for them at the lake had heard those noises as well, and the arrived group was met with pale faces and wide eyes that looked them all over, counting them and looking for possible injuries. When everyone was finally calm and ready to listen, Francesca shared the information about their discovery, admitting the defeat, because this cursed part of the forest was impossible for them to leave in any form. Of course, everyone was disappointed, including Sherlock, but something deep inside him was relieved, due to the fact that Mycroft hadn’t abandoned him because he’d decided to get rid of him, but because he really couldn’t get Sherlock out of this place. It still hurt, but it did make difference, nonetheless.
No matter how clean he was, it didn’t make him any less of an addict. He could at least look the facts in the face and admit it to himself, in spite of never admitting it to anybody else. John had been taken from him. John was going to become increasingly more distant after the child’s birth. And what if they decided to make another one? What kind of life was that with no John and no Work? At least the Work the way it used to be before Sherlock’s two years away. It went without saying that him shooting Magnussen had made the Work next to impossible now, except for Moriarty's legacy in the form of a person or an organisation that wasn't in a hurry to make its move to give Sherlock something, anything to work with. Nothing would ever be the same again and nostalgia was a pointless indulgence. There was nothing to quieten his mind down either. He was left with nothing.
The cygnet had, apparently, heard the other swans talking, so he was aware that he’d probably turn into a human for a few hours when the night came. But nobody was sure it would work the same way for the newcomers. Sherlock decided he’d find out later anyway before flying away to his chapel, as he usually did, not long before the transformation.
Fortunately for him, after that everything went rather well; or at least as well as possible, considering the situation the Prince was not aware of. Concerned by Sherlock’s reaction to him being late, he seemed to have started coming to the chapel a little earlier than before, though it was hard to tell whether it was conscious or not.
‘Oh, these are just false contractions. Nothing unusual. They normally start coming and going weeks before the real thing’, the doctor explained. Sherlock didn’t want to know. He didn’t want to hear any of this. Mercifully, John promised to ring the next day and ended the call.
‘What’s going on here? Who are those people? And who are you?’ he asked without a pause, both quickly and somewhat delicately at the same time.
He knew something was up. It wasn’t often that the royal family travelled to their property this far away from home. They were on friendly terms with the duke of Bavaria, so their access was in no way problematic. In addition, the duchy had some income from the whole deal. John had seen some sketches and read about the place, among others, but he’d never once been here before in person. The small piece of land and the castle belonged to them, even though it was situated in a foreign country.
‘Well, you knew it was going to happen, sooner or later. At least, you’ve got two months of absolute freedom, so let’s take the best out of it, shall we?!’ Bill tried to cheer him up.
Even if John was interested in anything like that, he had life and duties he could not and would not abandon. Starting a new royal dynasty, having a normal royal family with heirs, ruling a country, fulfilling people’s hopes, especially the hopes of his entourage, people he cared about… There was a lot of work ahead of him. Choosing Sherlock, whom he hadn’t really known that long, would’ve meant leaving
‘No’, Sherlock interrupted again. ‘There’s no ailment either’. He was conducting another one of his experiments (or, possibly, pretended to be very busy with it, never even looking at his interlocutor the whole time) and was currently holding a vial with something that was probably some plant’s juice, but his hands were shaking slightly, so it seemed like he was about to spill some of it. John took his wrist in his hand and gently lowered his hand so that it lay on the altar, making him put the vial down.
‘Nice to meet you, Archie’, John nodded. The boy eyed the stranger a bit suspiciously, but, just as suspiciously, he eyed Sherlock as well. Perfect… He was supposed to be the adult one, but here he was, embarrassing himself in front of a thirteen years old child. Archie murmured something under his nose and awkwardly shifted from one foot to another. At least, the older swan wasn’t the only one with the normal communication problems. When the boy’s eyes located John’s crossbow at the wall nearby, however, he became curious about it and it assuaged his discomfort to some extent.
Sherlock made Archie aware that he needed some time to talk to their guest. He really hoped he wouldn’t have to deal with a look of betrayal or anything of that sort. He was exceptionally bad at dealing with hurt feelings. But the boy just shrugged and went away, probably to collect more wood for their fire, his eyes lingering on the crossbow again.
‘All right’, John nodded, obviously open for more information. Not even remotely a trusting or naïve person, he liked to be well-informed to form his own opinions.
‘My name is John. It’s nice to meet you.., despite the odd circumstances’, the man introduced himself politely. Of course, his name was John. There was no other name that would’ve fit him, Sherlock thought, surprising himself a bit.
Now that he’d met and befriended Sherlock, which was an adventure on its own, he was even less thrilled about the ball than he had been the day he’d learned about it. It just seemed particularly ill-timed at the moment.
The Saint John’s festivities were already beginning when they arrived. The locals seemed friendly. In fact, some thought that the presence of a royal person could bring the village a good fortune. The main bonfire was huge, food and drinks plentiful. The celebrations involved the regular old rituals to scare off evil spirits, protect children and livestock from harm and illness. There was music, people sang, danced and played games together. Many people wore woven wreaths, made of leaves and twigs. Some had them decorated with flowers and ribbons. Some of the women who wore such wreaths gave others bouquets of fragrant herbs. One of them, a rather good-looking one, with a pleasant smile, gave John a bouquet, tentatively flirting with him, perfectly aware that he was royalty, despite his laid-back attitude. Throughout the night, he spent quite some time dancing with her at the bonfire. Not even his leg was bothering him. He knew it was going to bother him in the morning, but he didn’t care at the moment. The woman (Gertrude, as she’d introduced herself) made him aware she was interested in more than just dancing. John decided they had to be discreet and, while many things could be forgiven at the summer solstice celebrations, he didn’t want her to get in trouble with the other villagers. It wouldn’t do if she became a victim of gossiping because of him, especially with her being a widow.
Pierre, as it turned out, had noted the time between their transformations and shared his observations with everyone else. According to his calculations, they had spent about four hours in their human forms during both nights. And this second time, they had turned into humans roughly at the exact time as the first time when Sherlock had entered the chapel. Sherlock expressed his praise that at least someone from the flock deigned to use his human mind, instead of showing preference to a bird brain. It earned him a few glares, but everyone was used to Sherlock not being the nicest or most tactful of people. Pierre ignored them all, wondering aloud if it would always be like this for them now. Sherlock, in turn, kept his musings to himself, wondering if he and others would’ve had more time as humans if he had entered that chapel sooner after the sunset, as Mycroft had told him to. Maybe that would’ve given him a few extra hours in the body he was born with… Oh, but it was too late for regrets and they were pointless now. He felt a bit exhausted, both because of the transformations and because of running away from the hounds earlier, so he decided to get some sleep, despite the fact that he could still hear a rather serious commotion and racket, coming from the monstrous creatures. He had to convince and assure himself that they weren’t as close as they sounded tonight; they were simply noisier.
Whilst performing rescue breaths, he was pressing his fingers against the pulse point on Sherlock’s neck to avoid interrupting the whole process by doing it at any other time. At first, there was nothing at all, but then he managed to find a very weak, irregular pulse that in no way indicated that the heartbeat had been restored. It was better than nothing, though. Something insignificant was always better than nothing at all in cases like this. He continued as before: two rescue breaths, thirty chest compressions, two rescue breaths, thirty chest compressions… On more than a few occasions, he’d had to play by ear and improvise when a patient’s life depended on him, but this particular process had to be performed strictly according to rules.
They insisted on showing him the latest sonogram of their unborn daughter. He had expected to find it interesting, to a certain degree, at least from a scientific point of view, but he didn’t. The image of a curled up foetus had made everything he secretly dreaded more inevitable and there was a feeling of finality about it, too. John was about to become less available, busier. Sherlock couldn’t not love the girl, as she was partially John; his DNA, his ‘flesh and blood’. He remembered reading that people were genetically more similar to their fathers, rather than mothers, something about using more DNA from their fathers. He must have deleted the details as irrelevant, so he had to find more information about it, as well as some sort of confirmation in reliable sources, if such a confirmation existed (why did it even matter so much?). Looking at the sonogram, all Sherlock could see was that John wasn’t going back to living in 221B.
‘As I’ve mentioned, my brother is a very influential person. If anything could be done, he would have done it a long time ago’. From time to time, Sherlock couldn’t help doubting it, but it was his petulant, abandoned part speaking, ignoring the facts. He
I decided to make some visual aids. Everything grey or brown you see on the pictures is a cygnet or a juvenile swan. Sherlock is, obviously, an Australian black swan in this story.
The first few days Sherlock barely moved; he slept a lot, his head tucked under his wing. Sometimes Francesca, Molly, Henry, but mostly Archie, brought him food. He barely ate though. Molly tried to engage him in some sort of conversation, mostly for her own sake, but Sherlock hardly ever replied. Archie was generally quiet. He kept squeezing himself in between Sherlock’s body and his good wing to rest there. The older swan didn’t mind.
Moriarty kept visiting on occasion. At times, he just liked to be there to taunt and tease Sherlock, at other times, he simply sat there at the lake just to get at everyone’s nerves. A couple of times he came with a fishing pole and spent a few hours fishing and relaxing. As always, the swans preferred to stay away from him, even though he rarely paid any attention to them. If anyone was in the centre of his attention, it was Sherlock. The ‘crowned’ swan was used to it, but still felt uncomfortable. Moriarty was unpredictable and no one knew what he could do the very next moment. On the other hand, after being torn away from his family and life, he wasn’t sure he really cared if Moriarty hurt him personally, since he had already ruined Sherlock’s life.
‘Will do’, Pierre nodded at his request. After that, he and Francesca took their leave politely, with John being just as nice to them before sitting back down, once they were gone.
‘Oi! Shut it!’ Lestrade scowled. ‘Anyway, it’s not the end of the world. Many kings and queens take lovers after getting married’.
The test tube was fixed at a slight angle, suspended by the apparatus on the front table. Professor Keller held the blue flame of the Bunsen burner beneath it for a few moments, liquefying the potassium chlorate, and then took a gummy candy in his tongs, dropping it into the test tube and tapping it along as it stuck to the sides. The moment the candy hit the clear, molten liquid, it exploded in a burst of brilliant, pink-tinged fire as the sugar met its noble death, white steam billowing away out the open end of the tube.
Sherlock nodded down at the floor, considering, and then flashed a glance to John through his lashes, seeking permission.
John Watson smiled, a fragile thing that seemed to expect to be broken, his hands lifting from the pockets of his navy suit as a swallowed bobbed down his throat. “Hey,” he breathed, a whisper Sherlock more read from his lips than heard, and he stepped forward, dismissing the porter with a nod.
“Mistress’s birth year,” Sherlock answered, brow crinkling as he lifted the phone to his face, eyes darting side-to-side over the messages he scrolled through his thumb. A long message rolled across the screen, inverted from John’s point of view, and Sherlock stopped, eyes widening as a crazed grin spread across his face. “This is it!” he exclaimed, pulling the screen so close, his eyes nearly crossed as he read it. “This is everything we need!”
“I don’t know,” Sherlock echoed, bemused by the vitriol in the reaction. “Like I said, he didn’t give any details.”
“Wait, what?” John spluttered, stopping and placing a hand on Sherlock’s arm to prompt him to do the same. “Devon? Is that- Is that what happened earlier? On the coach?”
to humor it, because, apparently, he was still human somewhere in there, and, damn it all, it was nice! It was nice to not be mocked and snickered at, to have someone take a seemingly genuine interest for once. And he was flirting and blushing and he was being an idiot, he really needed to stop this right now before it got out of hand.
Sherlock’s mouth fluttered open, surprised. He hadn’t expected to get even that much out of her; he usually had to come back several times before she’d get around to anything useful. “What about him?”
“So…why didn’t you say something?” John asked, utterly perplexed. “What could you possibly have been worried about?”
“I assume I don’t have to go through the rather tedious rhetoric of typical tours,” Sherlock muttered, waving his hand vaguely around the room.
John laughed, his blue eyes crinkling. “Never doubted you for a second,” he assured, and Devon grinned. “So who ya roomin’ with?”
“Good afternoon, gentlemen.” Irene stepped through the doorway wearing one of Mrs. Hudson’s robes tied tight around her waist, and seemingly nothing else, the usually modest pink wrap folded just so to dip dangerously low down her chest.
done until I know if they make it in time.” He smiled, taking Lestrade’s moment of stunned silence to push past him, heading directly for the stairs.
John’s voice circled around in his head, scolding him for snapping at Donovan, praising him for catching some small detail from a photograph of the suspect’s car, and he couldn’t block him out, no matter how many locks he put on the John door of his mind palace. It was as if John had permeated every room, every layer beyond repair. His laugh had latched onto the windows, his smile carpeted the stairs, and his scent had soaked into the walls, staining every new thought with a bitter ache.
going to believe this! You said it first, right?” Molly asked, pointing at him, phone already drawn to her ear. “I get 20 quid if you said it first.”
“One all-nighter too many?” he teased, and, though Sherlock smiled, the jest plucked at the chord of memory tied to Victor’s words, and he turned away, nodding at the suitcase to change the subject.
“Okay,” he breathed, uncertain what else there was to say, but it seemed to be a satisfactory response, as Mycroft nodded and turned away toward the window. “Um…Mycroft?” he murmured, twisting his fingers in front of him as he moved a little further into the room.
“Bury it where?” Sherlock mumbled, and John laughed, Mrs. Hudson giving the detective a small slap on the arm as she passed.
“Yeah, I was thinking medium too,” John mused, nodding down at the menu as he turned it back to himself. “What about sides? Chips are a given, of course, but what about the other one? I was thinking corn or peas.”
Victor sighed, his entire body wilting with relief. “Thank you,” he squeaked, nodding fervently. “Thank you, sir. I-I swear, I won’t-”
If you haven't read much of my stuff, I'm sorry about this. If you have, you already know I'm an asshole and did this to yourself anyway, so congrats on your masochism kink I guess??
John snapped the headgear on just as Lestrade leveled his pistol, firing a couple shots into the target ahead.
Sherlock sighed, shoulders slumping as he rolled his eyes, but did follow, though with slightly heavier footfalls than necessary.
He considered asking someone else to take the table from him to spare himself the frustration of watching the remainder of the meal eaten in tense silence before Sherlock inevitably left with one of the only people John would genuinely strangle with his bare hands, but decided against it, a true masochist at heart.
He could feel the control in John’s body, tendons twitching as movements were considered and arrested, the taste of hesitation heavy on his tender lips, as if Sherlock was a fragile, newly-mended thing that would break anew if not handled with care, but, though the former may have been true, the latter was severely misguided, the tip of his tongue tracing the curve of John’s lip to prove it.
“You’re cold,” he said instead, his tone coming out just slightly softer and more concerned than he’d intended.
“What, you’re just gonna leave?” Lestrade blurted, his arm waving out over the evidence on the table.
“So, it’s probably best if we pretend we’ve never even heard of him,” Greg presumed, and John nodded once more.
John drained the last of his scotch, stretching his arm to reach the bottle perched on top of the polished wooden bar cart he had wheeled over for the evening.
“Don’t push it,” John interjected, and Harry grinned, flashing Sherlock a wink as he turned to her. “But, to be honest,” the blond continued, a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth as he shrugged, “I wouldn’t be
John looked back out the window, eyes glancing toward a puddle on the ground, the water dancing with seemingly ceaseless rain. “It’s personal,” he said, a cryptic smile hooking at his lips, but, before Sherlock could question the absurdity, the remainder of their party arrived—both damp, but only one of them incensed over it.
“Right,” he clipped, looking up through his lashes as John chuckled. “Well, I’ll, er…talk to you later, then,” he stammered out, and John grinned, dipping a nod.
John closed his parted lips, his throat strangled with affection. “I knew you would be,” he tried to reassure, smiling frailly even as he choked. “I-I didn’t doubt you.”
“What?” Sherlock replied, waving a hand back at a cackling Harry. “She’s clearly not going to stop.”
“You might wanna just forfeit it to Kevin, though. Doesn’t look like he’s in the mood to take the sofa.” John nodded forward, his eyes shifting their gaze, and they followed it to find Kevin sulking as he leaned against the wall and glared at anyone who dared walk too close. “You’re taking the sofa,” he muttered, turning his head slightly up at Sherlock even as his eyes never left Kevin.
“You can beat me over the head with my chemistry textbook,” John finished, and then folded his hands in his lap, watching Sherlock expectantly.
Sherlock laughed, startling himself with the sudden burst, and John chuckled, the tension easing slightly between them. “Yeah,” Sherlock replied, nodding in the direction Irene had disappeared, “she’s…not one for nuance.”
much more difficult,” he said disparagingly, and Sherlock laughed, the blond chuckling along, and then, once again, they were just staring, smiles still lingering on their faces. John dropped his eyes first, teeth scraping over his lip as he looked down at the table, and then abruptly lifted his head, drawing in a breath. “Sherlock, I-”
“No,” he answered, unable to even be angry, he was so awed. “No, I didn’t.” Of course, it all made sense
“Not now, Ryan! I wouldn’t have done any of those things, Sherlock, any of them!” John was leaning forward off the sofa now, arms waving out over the coffee table as he gestured wildly at the wide-eyed brunette. “If I wanted safe, I would have run for the hills the
“Ah, right, Clark Kent. Glasses.” He waggled a finger in front of an eye, and John ducked his head to hide a smile. Good to know Lestrade went the super social drunk route rather than the angry one. “Well, come on, come in, grab a drink! Not you,” he added, sobering long enough to give Sherlock a firm look.
“We should go,” he murmured, forcing himself to step back, his hand trailing down Sherlock’s chest a ways before it separated completed, his fingers physically aching in dissent. “Before they come down here looking for us.”
“Wait!,” John beckoned, and Sherlock turned, curious at the urgency of it. John’s earnest expression eased somewhat, but he still looked nervous, his fingers twisting unnecessarily at the strap of his bag. “I-I think we got off on the wrong foot,” he said hesitantly, face pinching in a self-conscious grimace. “I didn’t mean to- Before, I- I shouldn’t’ve said what I did.”
“The list of things we have to watch,” John replied, tapping his fingers over the electronic keyboard.
“I dunno,” he answered, lifting his head, and John dutifully moved his arm, stretching it out for Sherlock to pillow his cheek on the bicep, “something I don’t know.”
“I understand cuts need to be made, gentlemen,” John said, his voice a saber’s edge, and Sherlock straightened up from where he’d been slumped against the wooden railing of the deserted public viewing area, “but surely there is something more trivial than public health that we can pull from.”
“You know what’s in Kent!” Sherlock shouted, pointing accusatorily, his arms then jerking wildly as he continued to rail. “John’s there, and I’m fairly sure he’s in trouble, and I have never asked you for anything in my
“How did you get a cab out here?” John repeated, waving his hand toward the blurry scenery. “Seems like you’d have to hire a car from a town like this.”
John shook his head, mouth twisting into a disdainful sneer as he scoffed. “No, he wasn’t,” he snarled, and the hairs on the back of Sherlock’s neck stood up at the icy venom contained in those three words.
Mike took a long drink, slowing his swallow and clearing his throat. “Your, er, lunch with Miss Jeanette,” he muttered, and the line of John’s shoulders tightened.
“I heard it all the time,” Moran continued, a note of bitterness cracking into his tone, and the hair on the back of Sherlock’s neck stood up, the tension in the room palpably rising. “Sherlock this, Sherlock that. You’d think you were the fucking second coming!” He laughed, but it was sharp, brittle, and, when his eyes fixed on Sherlock’s again, they held no mirth, nothing but hollow black pools gaping out of his tanned face. “I wouldn’t hold my breath on a resurrection, though.”
Taking that as an apology (when translated from Sherlockese, at least), John closed his mouth and returned to searching through the photographs, but still couldn’t find anything amiss. “Show me, then,” he said.
“Her bust?” he parroted, Sherlock forehead furrowing in an oblivious frown. “How do you know the size of her bust?”
Sherlock laughed again at that, and John smiled, still watching when the man’s grey eyes lifted back to his in the dimly lit car. They lingered there a moment, eyes locked together across the center console, and then simultaneously tore away, Sherlock coughing this time around. “Er, you have to…turn around,” he muttered, his finger whirling a gesture in the air. “To-To get to Baker Street.”
“Don’t bother.” His voice was dark as he glared into the man’s face, and he watched icy fire flash through grey-brown.
“So,” the blond chirped, ducking his head to avoid a particularly low crossbeam, “what’s your favorite color?”
“Yeah, well, that’s just Sherlock, isn’t it?” Mike chuckled. “You get used to it, or you get verbally hacked to bits.”
There was a knock at the door, a less shocking occurrence than normal being that it was the last day of term, the entire rugby team seeming to want to stop by before they left, and John moved toward it, throwing it open unthinkingly before he froze. “Harry?” he breathed.
John blinked, his manners putting his arm on autopilot as he shook Mrs. Hudson’s hand. “John,” he muttered, clearing his throat as he hitched up a smile, beating back his surprise. “Watson,” he added, and Mrs. Hudson, landlady and ballet instructor extraordinaire, chuckled, her eyes turning bright.
,” Victor sighed, as if Sherlock were the tiresome one, a tactic he could now see had worked far too many times, “that I broke up with him
John smiled to himself softly, staring down at the floor to cover it. This excursion was definitely looking up.
… Some memories are worth keeping,” he settled on, looking up at John through his lashes, “even if they hurt.”
Gently, such a slight pressure, John first thought it was merely a shift of the blankets, the toes of Sherlock’s sock-clad feet bent back to brush against John’s, a fitting barely-there touch to round off weeks of them.
Tremors vibrated through the floor around him from the struggle overhead, and there was nothing but an unintelligible roar of voices before an unmistakable one broke through, frantic and much closer than the others.
Lornes was bustling—or what Sherlock assumed was their version of it—with activity, people talking and laughing as they milled through the patterned brick courtyard and surrounding cobblestone streets. Carts and kiosks in various states of setup littered the square under a canopy of twinkle lights, bright ribbons and glittering garlands bursting from boxes or already wrapped around lampposts, with small bunches of what looked to be paper flowers tucked into every bare corner and crevice. The far end of the courtyard was overtaken by an ice rink, which was already open for business, a few couples and young families wobbling over the polished surface, and a gargantuan tree overlooked it all just beyond, a small army of people surrounding it on ladders as baubles as big as Sherlock’s head were hoisted up onto the boughs. The buildings were a mix of old and new, but a traditional style had been held to, brick and stone with wooden accents, Christmas bleeding from every windowsill and doorway with deep green wreaths and red poinsettias. There was snow piled up along the edges of the street, evidence of a recent storm, but none still lingering on the rooftops or window boxes, which was just as well, in Sherlock’s mind, or he would have been absolutely convinced he’d been tricked onto a film set.
“What does that even mean?” Sherlock interjected, wrenching his hand away. “Since when are mythological creatures synonyms for sexual orientations? And why am
“A hazard of the job and an oversight on my part,” John answered, lifting a hand to his chest in contrition.
“Pity,” Mycroft muttered, lifting a mushroom-topped crostini from the plate. “I do rather enjoy pointing out the seeds in everyone’s teeth.”
“Storage?” John echoed, frowning down at him. “I thought you moved straight into Victor’s from your last place.”
Sherlock did not reply, only took a deep breath, and, gradually, his heartbeat slowed where it shook against John’s own.
pacing myself,” he snipped, turning to face his brother, the button of his dark grey suit pulling a little more than he remembered. “I’ve only had three.”
“It’s 11 o’clock,” he muttered, but Irene only flicked her hand in unconcerned dismissal, turning away to leave them watching her walk away.
“Goodnight, Sherlock,” John replied, his tone downright gooey, but he couldn’t bring himself to be embarrassed when it only made Sherlock blush brighter, avoiding John’s gaze as he hastily closed the door and walked up the steps to 221B, head bowed as he fumbled with his keys. John lingered until he saw the door open, Sherlock stepping safely inside, and then shifted the car into drive, looking back up just in time to catch Sherlock turning around.
“Okay, that was a legitimate concern,” Sherlock countered with a firm nod. “I had all the symptoms.”
“Nothing, it’s just- Well, you know that spring arts celebration they do every year?” she began, and John nodded, having seen the flyers scattered around campus. “Well, Irene mentioned last night that Sherlock’s been practicing for it,” she explained, and John turned off the tap, looking up at her, intrigued. “She didn’t mention ballet specifically,” the girl amended, “but I don’t know what else it would be. And, when I got home, I checked the list of performances, and there is a ballet group from that studio.” She pointed across the street, John’s eyes following the line of her finger a moment before returning to her shrewd brown eyes. “I guess it’s where all the university dancers train.”
. So, no more fucking twinks in alleys, and definitely no more texting Sherlock unless he texted first. Only then would John respond. And he'd be cool, too, in his responses. Like it was nothing to him whether Sherlock opened up communication or not. It wasn't at all true and wouldn't stand up to even the most cursory of Sherlock's examinations, but it was what John had to hold onto, and dammit—he wasn't going to let it go.
It's not the type of place you grow to love. In many ways, how I feel about Sherlock matches how I felt about this land in my earliest memories of visiting my grandfather's farm. There was no

I took a deep breath and tried to explain. "I turned you down because I was focused on the case, I'd only just met you, it didn't seem prudent to begin an affair with my new flatmate, and as you can see—" I gestured towards the pile of toys and rope in the sitting room. "—my tastes are unusual." I paused and made sure I was holding his eyes. "
A week passes, and I grow irritated and snappish, and he becomes conciliatory and far too tolerant. Two weeks—I'm only home when he's at work, and try to leave the flat before he comes home. I go through my inbox, and answer every email, and if a client needs to be interviewed, I meet them at their home or a neutral location. When there's nothing else to do, I roam London to avoid him, welcoming the biting cold. I'm not sure who I'm punishing—myself or John.
"Can we?" Sherlock asked tentatively. He stood and walked to the middle of the sitting room, but came no closer to John. "Talk, that is? I know you're angry and—"
—it's John. He's slouched down in his chair with two fingers of his left hand supporting his cheek, his thumb cupping his chin, and there's a glass of scotch in his hand.

The closer the cab got to home, the deeper dread dug its claws into my gut. I was hot, then cold. In my gut, fear that John would reject me alternated with anger—anger at Oasis for calling my bluff, at Greg for bringing me to that damn crime scene, at Shelly Cleary for having the audacity to be murdered, and at John for making me fall in love with him.

. You—you're right about me probably ignoring you during cases. I ignore you already during cases, unless I need your help, so that's not—"
"I don't want you to think it means we're getting back together again," John said, and then turned his head away.
Sherlock's eyes widen almost imperceptibly and he seems to relax a fraction. "The night we met, were you—"
, not because Sherlock was embarrassed about being gay, but because he was embarrassed by people who acted silly in public. He liked men who enjoyed dancing in nightclubs and kissing in the shadows of buildings, who laughed at Sherlock’s jokes, watched him wide-eyed when he was brilliant, who didn’t take it personally when he was distracted by an experiment, who knew not to call or text him when he was working on a case, who knew not to show up uninvited either, but who were fine with Sherlock breaking into their own flat or house to use them as a sounding board. He liked men who were idealistic about love and didn’t hold grudges.
"I'll tell you all about it when I'm no longer desperate to get you naked," John said while finishing the job of unfastening Sherlock's trousers. He grabbed both trousers and pants and pulled them off while scooting backwards.
Sherlock peeled away from the kiss and hollered "Mrs. Hudson! John's going to take the upstairs bedroom after all!"
Darrow smiles sadly, and nods in resignation. He understands my predicament. His wife, Adie, is from Southern Australia. They met when Darrow traveled there to buy new stock for his herd from Adie's father. In her case, she moved from one sheep farm to another. Asking a detective to move to the desolate highlands where crime consists of the occasional public nuisance would be asking him to give up his life's work.
Almost ten minutes exactly go by before Sherlock opens the door. The movement catches John's eyes and he jerks his head in that direction. "Hey," he says, his genuine happiness to see Sherlock infusing his voice. "Come in and sit. We need to talk."
or threatened to leave Clara if she didn't let it alone. But Harry never actually followed through. After Harry ended up in the A&E for alcohol poisoning, nearly dying, Clara had made it clear if Harry started drinking again, she would leave. The day after Harry fell off the wagon, Clara was gone.
"Ah, yes, my name's Dr. John Watson," (using my title tends to make people more trusting), "I'm looking for Sherlock?"
It was after eight when the class broke up. Dr. Watson stood at the door and said goodbye to each person as they left. Everyone but Sherlock, Dr. Watson, and a woman who'd said she worked in hospice care. The woman followed Dr. Watson from the door to the dais at the front of the class, talking the whole time, while Dr. Watson nodded politely, but Sherlock felt Watson's eyes falling on him periodically. He pretended to be looking for his phone, digging through his coat pocket, and his trouser pockets and finally pulling it out of his inside jacket pocket where it'd been the whole time. He looked down, at a loss how to look busy with it and then saw there was a text message from Greg.

Audrey had released the belt on his dressing gown, and it fell to the ground in a billow of dark and heavy silk. As always, the light in Sherlock's room was dim. Audrey had toed off her shoes at some point and when she let down her hair, Sherlock found himself burying his face in her neck, breathing in the light perfume of her skin, a combination of lavender and lime soap. He bent down, cupped both hands behind her knees and slid his hands up her bare thighs, thumbs pressing in between her legs. Her skirt bunched around her waist as he went.
There's nothing in the loo that might act as a rectal wash. I'm still fully dressed, and John will be coming down the stairs any minute now. I start for the kitchen when I hear John's footsteps on the back stairs and leap to lock the door to the hallway. The turning of the Victorian-era tumbler on that end of the loo coincides with John's step from the staircase onto the hallway floor where his footsteps are muted by the runner, and the

By the time John had taken the leaflet, the pew he'd planned to sit in—the one furthest in the back—had filled up enough that he would have to step over people and sit in the middle. Not a good place to sit if one wanted to make a quick getaway. Nothing like tripping over people to draw attention to oneself. John's eyes scanned the church (

"I don't know," Sherlock snapped, then stood up, anxiety a weight in his stomach and a lump in his throat.
When Sherlock crouched down next to them, he discreetly pulled out a knife and cut the rope binding her ankle, but to cut the one around her wrist, he would have to bring the knife within her field of vision and he was unsure how she would react to it. Instead, he cut the rope where it was tied to the engine while she was distracted by Toby who was enthusiastically licking her hands and arms and face. She giggled, and when he put his finger on his lips in the universal gesture for
All he gets from Sherlock is a grunt, though he waits for a few seconds to see if Sherlock will say anything else. He doesn't. John rubs his hands together and, feeling awkward—not an unusual feeling around Sherlock—retreats quietly to his bedroom where he spends an embarrassing amount of time deciding what to wear during his stay.
John had arrived home around ten, after having spent an hour and a half walking, his limp pronounced and adding to the mixture of resentment and dread. He spent the next four hours trying to calm himself enough to sleep a little, knowing he had to work the next day and that there was no way to know when Sherlock would be home. But he'd just lain in bed, staring at the ceiling, forcing his eyes to close only to have them drift open without him realizing it.
John might not come at all. Or, he might come, but—disgusted at Sherlock's lack of personal hygiene—leave again immediately after. Or maybe he would come and stay, even though he was disgusted, feeling obligated to help Sherlock because they'd once been lovers.
after he'd last seen Sherlock, he finally got a text. Sherlock gave no indication that he'd read John's texts, or listened to John's at first angry, then worried, and finally desperate, pleading voice messages.

she cried when he found what he was looking for. He worked his tongue against her until she was dripping with his saliva and her own slick. His cock was achingly hard. It felt like he'd been fighting off an erection for twelve hours, and losing the battle. Now, here she was, so,

, all of which were complicated and confusing and would result in a shitstorm raining down on his head, and then Sherlock got overwhelmed and found it easier just to keep ignoring the problem.
When we got home, I could feel John's attention focused on me, but I pretended not to notice. I set myself up on the couch with both of our laptops and my phone in an attempt to look Very Busy. John stood in the kitchen doorway, uncertainty coloring his usual stillness until I barked, "Sit down! Your hovering is making it difficult to think."
John realized. He could smell it, then, smell her and him together, the smell of sex. He wanted to vomit.
"Sent them away," Sherlock muttered, focused on trying to stand. John reached for him as he staggered.

John, grinning madly, unable to stop even though it feels like his face is about to be stretched beyond endurance, looks at Sherlock who grins back. John grabs the back of Sherlock's head and, to the sound of laughter and another of Evelyn's wolf whistles, he gives Sherlock a proper kiss with tongue and all.

Sitting on the bus on the way to work, John's mind picked through the haze of fear that had gripped him for unbearable hours last night. At NSY, John had been sorting through files of unsolved murders whose victims matched the profiles of the killer Sherlock and Greg's team were after. Sherlock had been pacing back and forth in the huge basement room where officers and clerks could lay out large swaths of paperwork and sort through it for whatever purpose they might have to do so. Mostly it was used for the boring, meticulous work of the clerks, but it was also used for the same purpose John had been using it last night—to pull out all the paperwork involved in a murder case and lay it out to sort through it. There were a couple of 2.5m folding tables, a cabinet full of office supplies, copiers, and computers on mismatched desks. It had twenty foot ceilings with exposed ductwork and it was always very cold—John never could stand being down there without his jacket.
Sherlock's eyes immediately narrowed in calculation, then he opened them wide in faux innocence. "I don't know. I think it will take much more than a kiss."
The John Donne poem referenced in "In the Mid-Midwinter" is basically about death, darkness, etc. St. Lucy's Day is the shortest day of the year, that is, "the midnight of the year." It's about mourning the death of the beloved; the lover left behind might as well be dead, too. He certainly
John waited dutifully at the bottom of the stairs, staring up at the first landing, hearing nothing but silence. In itself, silence wasn't necessarily indicative of trouble—Sherlock could spend hours in his mind palace, absolutely still, the only sound that of his breathing. The silence still felt ominous to John. Maybe it was nerves.
season's shopping, and his intractable obsession with checked or plaid button-down shirts, which he often slips into his wardrobe underneath my watchful eye, generally when bulk-food shopping at Asda, like a lower-class moth drawn to a discount flame.
John can feel the tremor that goes through Sherlock's body. He lifts his head and presses his forehead against Sherlock's. "Sherlock, sweetheart, I promise. I promise I'm yours for as long as you'll have me."
Mrs. Hudson’s eyes lit with recognition, her face stretching in surprise. “I know that place! It’s right across from-”
“Here,” he said, trying to guide the pillow under John’s head one-handed, but the man sat up to take the water from him instead, and he temporarily abandoned the endeavor, sitting at John’s feet on the opposite end of the sofa.
When they did touch, John’s hand gently cradling his as he turned and twisted it in examination, Sherlock thought he might faint, the world seeming to tilt beneath him, threatening to knock him off the narrow bench. How long had it been since someone had touched him like this—soft, tender, unmarked with expectation? Sure, there had been Victor, and the odd faceless anyone at a party here and there, but it had never meant anything, never carried any weight beyond the urgent need of a moment both parties later pretended had never occurred. But John… John held him like something fragile, something he knew was cracked in several places already, and, the more Sherlock thought about it, the more he realized that was probably true.
! It was unholy, really, the soft gasps and broken moans and whimpers whispering between them as John traced his tongue over Sherlock’s mouth, paying special attention to the roof after it became clear Sherlock had a weakness for it, fingernails digging into the back of John’s neck in a way he almost hoped left a mark.
“I’ll catch you up in English, yeah?” John said, half over his shoulder, as he had already started walking away.
Seriously though, thank you to everyone who believed in me, pushed me, and supported me in the long and arduous journey to get back on the gargantuan horse that is this fic. This story means so much to me, as do all of you, and I'm so glad we're all back in it together.
“-something that is…’ and then they put in whatever it was, like a color or something.” John’s smile only seemed to grow at the disgust on Sherlock’s face. “So, if I said ‘I spy with my little eye something that is blue’, you would have to guess-”
“How is it different?” Sherlock asked, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees, a victorious glint in his eyes. “You told me that, if I didn’t want to tell you something, I could simply say it was none of your business rather than lie. I don’t want to answer your question, ergo I am implementing your established rules. I don’t see what about this situation would merit exemption.”
He wriggled against the mattress, the pretense of adjusting bringing him a few inches closer to John’s taut back, and he could hear the man breathing—wobbly exhales he was struggling to keep even. Sherlock drew in a breath at the ceiling, subtlety not going to get him anywhere fast, and then flipped onto his side, bringing his face within a foot of the back of John’s head.
“You know what I mean,” Mrs. Hudson interjected, rattling a finger down at him, and Sherlock fell silent, pouting at the ground as he twisted the toe of his shoe in the dirt. “It doesn’t do anybody any good being out in this weather, and you without your coat. I told you to bring it, I don’t know why no one ever-”
Sherlock looked up, about to say the dark aviators the man was wearing in indirect sunlight like some kind of C-list celebrity probably didn’t help with that, when he took them off, Sherlock’s jaw left hanging in the wind as he gaped.
Sherlock scoffed, but the smile held something much gentler than mocking. “I do remember primary school, John. Stop, drop, and roll.”
“Is it the virgin thing?” he blurted, and John blinked, stunned, his body reeling where he had frozen. “Should I have told you? I probably should have told you; you’ll be all worried now.”
“Sherlock?” John asked, his voice far away, and Sherlock swallowed, striding back the way he’d come. “Sherlock, where are you going?”
If anything, the brunette locked into place, eyes widening for a moment before they narrowed sharply, posture stiffening as his fingers curled.
!” “I don’t know what else you call a grown man muttering about the surface area of rice noodles.”—and another argument about what crêpe to get—“We got Nutella last time.” “So? It’s Nutella; you can never have enough Nutella.” “At least get bananas in it or something.” “And sully the chocolatey-hazelnut goodness!? I don’t even know who you
“Yeah,” he replied, and Sherlock felt at least marginally less foolish as John’s cheeks darkened too. “See ya.” He flashed a final smile, a gesture Sherlock fumblingly returned, and then focused back on yet another blended drink, Sherlock turning away to head out the door in a daze.
“How should I know?” she huffed, the image of her tossing her hands up in exasperation crystalline in Sherlock’s mind. “He wouldn’t tell me. Just wanted an audience for all his
“He’s not even red!” John railed, and Sherlock scowled, his eyes narrowing until the blond released a begrudging sigh, gaze dropping once again to the box in his hand. Tentatively, his eyes lifted. “Are you sure-”
For a moment, everyone froze, Victor and Dewey Decimal gaping at him while he couldn’t look away, and then they all moved at once, Sherlock backing out the door as the naked portion of the trio scrambled to cover up.
Interested in a new Sherlock/fandom convention in Minneapolis next summer? Mssmithlove and a glorious gang of geeks are working hard to bring one to life, so please take a hot two minutes to complete
John laughed lightly, shaking his head, and then they were caught just smiling at one another long after it ought to have gotten uncomfortable.
Sherlock had never told John any of this, of course, but the man seemed to have pieced it together, and was quick to text or call the second he was free of them.
John shrugged. “I’d seen him around the Yard. Talked to him once. Kinda gave me the creeps, to be honest.”
. “I have to meet her sometime,” he said, shrugging a shoulder, “and you’re already seeing her father for the Parliament meeting.” His smile sharpened at one edge as John’s lips flapped with breathless indignation. “And the queen thought it was a ‘
“Come with me,” he snapped, as if Sherlock had any choice, and he stayed pinned close to John’s back as they crossed the club.
As Kevin rambled, turning to point out some spot on the field, John chanced a glance toward the bench where Sherlock was talking to a rather animated Devon. The detective didn’t seem in any particular distress, however, his hands tucked into the pockets of his Consulting Coach jacket, shoulders soft and at ease as he nodded thoughtfully at whatever Devon was saying. As if sensing the glance, his eyes flicked over, catching John’s, and he blinked, a telepathic question in the tilt of his head.
Sherlock dropped his eyes to the ground, brow twitching as his brain struggled to connect the dots, but it was like herding shooting stars, the questions and possibilities rocketing around to ping across the inside of his already pained skull. He could hear his breathing beginning to pick up, the first hisses of hyperventilating whistling past his teeth, and promptly clamped his jaw shut, not wanting to give anyone any more reason to worry about him.
“Like hell you don’t!” John challenged, and Sherlock stopped halfway down the corridor, twisting back with eyes blazing.
John started, unaccustomed to Sherlock raising his voice, although the wild, desperate look in his eyes was equally disconcerting.
“Ha ha,” John replied tonelessly, and Irene grinned, moving away to fix the drink. “Just you tonight?” he asked, looking around for Craig, their other bartender who was sometimes called in to help during a rush.
“For a friend,” John echoed skeptically, eyebrows rising, and Sherlock closed his lips, suddenly aware of how foolish that sounded. John chuckled, turning back to his computer. “Well, tell your
John had been rather quiet ever since they had practiced their lines, and Sherlock may have thought it was some lingering dissatisfaction with the turkey paninis Mrs. Hudson had put together for lunch, but John had barely touched his, more pushing it around on his plate and tugging at the strings of cheese than actually eating.
“They are,” Mike insisted, stepping forward as Sherlock made to turn away, damned box still held between them. “The order came in this morning.”
“You’re serious,” John said tonelessly, staring at him like he could see clear through to his soul. “You really don’t believe me.”
Sherlock didn’t appear to have made the sound when John’s eyes found him, however, his face a brick wall.
,” he hissed, snapping the folder shut and looking up. “It was obvious Michael Parker killed Claire Jones to cover up the affair, the only question was how he managed to do it and be in his office at the time neighbors reported the shot. There was nothing in the bathroom to suggest any sort of mechanical rigging, so it must have been more subtle. The open window was, obviously, the key.”
While Sherlock had escaped Irene for a time, one never could hope to entirely evade her, even if they didn’t have a class with her later that day. Of course, Sherlock did, and, as Irene walked into the chemistry lab, eyes piercing as they locked onto where he stood by the window, he wondered if he might have been better to leave the running until after the final bell had rung.
“Anything I can get you while I’m out?” he tossed back over his shoulder, bracing a hand against the doorframe as he shoved his socked feet back into his shoes. “Milk? Toilet roll? A moral compass?”
“And we thought we’d take the train—save the hassle of the airport, you know—but if it didn’t take twice as long! If it’s not the weather, it’s the machinery, though I’d rather that sort of thing happen on the ground, if I could pick.” She looked around the group with a laugh, assuming their agreement. “We were so worried you weren’t going to make it, what with the weather delay and all.”
“I quite like that,” she mused, gaze drifting up toward the ceiling. “It certainly rings true for my late husband and I. I thought he was very posh, you see,” she said, wrinkling her nose at the memory. “He was next in line for the throne and of comparable age, so, naturally, I was in consideration for his queen. But, my god, I thought he was the most
“Yes, alright,” he snapped, finally freeing the elasticized cuff from John’s wrist, prying the tan hands away from the purple fabric of his shirt so he could stand up and toss the jacket atop John’s bed. “Now just-” He stopped, turning back to find John lying on his back, staring silently up at him with glazed eyes. “What?” he muttered.
- Give me that!” He snatched the ball out of its downward arch toward Sherlock’s waiting fingers, clenching it in his fist as he pulled it away.
“You know, I once had a case where a woman murdered her husband with fireworks,” Sherlock said, head bent low over a box he was loading several small canisters into. “She slipped a rigged one into the pile before sending him off to light them.”
back—I was counting on mum to help me—and there’d be no one to pick me up at the station anyway because she and
John’s face fell to horrified, prompting Sherlock into another fit of laughter. “No,” he said, eyes widening as they landed on the clock. “That’s- That clock is slow.”
The room must have been another dormitory at some point, but it had been thoroughly transformed into what could only be described as a laboratory. Shelves lined the walls, loaded with even more stacks of paper and a large assortment of rather unpleasant-looking things suspended in jars. Several tables lined the walls, scattered with books, beakers, phials, petri dishes, and all manner of scientific equipment. A microscope that probably cost more than his first semester’s tuition sat on the table to his right, next to an assortment of colorful petri dishes he made a mental note not to get too close to. On the table directly in front of him was a stainless steel microwave, looking oddly normal and out of place in the room he’d swear he’d just walked through a wormhole to get in. A hissing sound drew his attention, and he looked up to find a figure sitting at a metal table against the opposite wall, silhouetted against the light from the window in front of him.
Moran nodded, turning on his heels and flashing a glare at square-skull as he passed, and the man wisely took a step back. “Oh, sir?” he asked, twisting back, and the suited man halted, turning and tilting his head in eerily polite inquiry. “What should I do with the file?”
“You can see the castle from the city,” Greg said, smiling at Molly, who had practically crawled across the console to catch every last glimpse of the view, and she retreated back to her seat, chuckling nervously. “It’s actually a tradition that, when a couple gets engaged at the Christmas Eve ball, they light the lamp in the old castle bell tower to announce it to the townspeople. They used to take to the streets with candles and lanterns, but now they just turn on every light in the city.” He smiled out at the road ahead, Sherlock watching his eyes grow warm in the rearview mirror. “It’s really quite beautiful. But you’ll get to see it, I suppose,” he said, meeting Sherlock’s gaze in the mirror. “If we do our jobs right.”
“No,” he assured, but Sherlock didn’t appear to buy it, laughing gently as the familiar creaking sound appeared again.
“Irene,” he replied, Sherlock already seeming to lose focus, lashes lounging on his cheeks between blinks. “I’m gonna go check on her.”
“Hurry up, you lot!” Mrs. Watson called from downstairs, unknowingly breaking up the showdown, and Harry leaned back, drawing herself up to her full height that Sherlock was quickly catching up to as she looked down her nose at them.
“I don’t know!” Sherlock cried, quivering hand running through his hair, and John startled back. “I don’t know, I-”
“I beg your pardon!” John blurted in mock offense, raising a delicate hand to his chest. “I have impeccable taste in fashion! Don’t I, Mrs. Hudson?”
“Sorry,” John sputtered as Sherlock let out a small gasp, jerking his head away from John’s touch as he prodded a particularly tender spot. “It doesn’t feel too bad,” John murmured, brushing more softly this time. He pulled away, and Sherlock suffocated the flicker of disappointment in his chest. “Let me see your eyes.” John tapped his fingers under his chin, and Sherlock lifted his head, opening his mouth to snap out a scathing remark, but his closing throat smothered it as he realized just how close John was leaning into his face.
“Two steps to your right, three forward,” came a far-too-calm voice from across the room, and John followed the directionals, feeling rather like a live-action version of monopoly.
“I already told you,” Ethan snapped, the temper Sherlock knew flared beneath the surface making a brief appearance. “This guy, he’s a heavy hitter. And, with the dealers I took out,”—he smiled in satisfaction as John snarled—“there’s not much else standing in his way. He’ll be the only guy
He had insisted upon the spot by the window, and, when he tilted his desk just right, he could see the flower beds in the school courtyard, watching the bees flit from blossom to blossom as Mrs. Hudson prattled on about spelling tests he had yet to study for or have any difficulty with. There had been talk of moving him up a year, conversations he had glued himself to the air vents to hear while his parents talked in his father’s study below his room, but, in the end, they had decided against it, not wanting to give Sherlock’s classmates yet another reason to see him as different. He was already quite young for this year as it was, most of the other children already 8, but Sherlock hardly thought that mattered; he was never going to fit in regardless.
“You moving in with me,” John replied like those words weren’t impossible in that order, closing the distance between them again as he reached for Sherlock’s hand, but Sherlock slipped it free of his grip. “You can stay in Harry’s room for the rest of the week, and Mum can go over and get some of your stuff, and then, on Saturday-”
“Well…alright,” John said, still soft, but a little brighter, and Sherlock’s chest swelled with satisfaction.
“I will drop you,” he warned, lifting his brows at Irene’s protruding tongue, and then tucked her tight to his chest, looking over her body and picking a path back to the door. It took a little longer with another person draped over him, but they made it through unscathed, John lifting his chin to say as much and coming face-to-face with Sherlock’s smirk.
John felt a flush creeping up his neck, and he tried to fuse his spine with the headboard as he pulled away. “What are you-” He trailed off as Sherlock pulled out his mobile, already dialing a number as he pulled back from John, and John was definitely,
Sherlock smiled, twisting his head up to John’s face. “Well, that would be where we come in, now wouldn’t it?” he answered, and John grinned.
John folded back out onto the mattress, giggling and clicking his trainers together, completely counterproductive to Sherlock’s attempt to unlace them. “Crack my skull,” he parroted through a sigh, and Sherlock shook his head as he tugged off his shoes. “Wait, wait,” John whined as Sherlock went to walk away, bending to place John’s trainers underneath his bed. He sat up, more or less, wavering a bit before finding his balance. “I-I don’t want-” He tugged at the front of his jacket, flapping his arm backward in a disjointed attempt to remove the sleeve.
John beamed. “One order of blueberry waffles, coming up,” he said with a nod, brilliant azure flashing with amusement before he ducked back around the doorframe, his footsteps gradually fading away.
“You don’t…what?” John questioned, and Sherlock flinched, the creasing of his skin causing a fresh surge of pain through the bruise, a sharp reminder of the choice he didn’t have.
thinking about John undressing mere meters away, pulling white cotton over his chest and dragging it across his already tousled hair before-
“Nope!” Irene chirped, clenching the sides of her dress in her hands and spreading it wide. “I’m Clara”—she dipped a curtsy, dropping the dress as she straightened—“and this is my Nutcracker Prince, Sherlock.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes, but John didn’t blink, long seconds of staring passing before Sherlock gave in with a huff. “Take my peacoat.” He bobbed his head down the hall toward his room, John glancing at the door before looking back with a frown. “It doesn’t fit me,” he explained with a shrug. “Too short in the sleeves.”
thermal leggings.” She patted the top of her large suitcase for emphasis, and Sherlock laughed, shaking his head as he spotted his own luggage rumbling toward them.
“So, what program are you in?” John questioned, and Sherlock blinked his gaze back up to his eyes, mouth stalling open a moment as his vision swam across the truly unjust blue.
A small, greasy-haired man—couldn’t have been older than 25, John would guess—opened his mouth to retort when a tall man stepped between them.
“Great,” Sherlock said with a nod, not quite sure it would be, having not met the prince yet, but it seemed the only thing to say, and Mrs. Hudson smiled, twisting the key in the lock and pushing open the door to the room he would be making home for the next twenty-three days.
“Yeah, well,” John said softly as he turned back to the pitch, surprised at how easily something he’d never admitted before came out, “he left long before that.”
Sherlock nodded, tapping the tips of his trainers together as he carefully planned his next words. “And-And you?” he asked, flicking a glance up at John through his lashes. “How are you handling it?”
the risks again and again.” He paused, straightening his spine as a slow breath eased the set of his shoulders. “You can’t blame yourself for not making me leave,” he said softly, and Sherlock flinched his gaze away. “You never
Sherlock sneered, revealing his mouth to stick his tongue out at the boy’s smirk. “I’ll get a fire extinguisher.”
Sherlock blinked, befuddled by the sudden stillness, and then frowned, tilting his head as he brought John’s face into focus. “John?” he questioned, and the blond seemed to startle, jolting slightly as he tore his eyes back up to Sherlock’s.
John sighed, turning his head this way and that, wondering if he should go to sleep in lieu of something worthwhile to do, when a knock came to the door downstairs.
good. And Mum-” She paused, expression faltering as she looked down at their combined grip. “Well, Will’s not mean,” she continued, shrugging. “He’s an asshole, sure. Kept asking me if I was gonna bring my girlfriend around for a show”—she lifted a hand to halt John’s appalled protest—“but he’s not mean. To be honest,” she murmured, pulling her hands back to herself, brow furrowing with hesitation, “I think they might deserve each other.”
“Did you tell her!?” Sherlock raged, and John’s eyes stretched wide, his mouth shifting soundlessly as he scanned Sherlock’s face. “Did you!?”
,” Irene was raging when Sherlock tuned back into the conversation, Molly shaking her head in preemptive disapproval of whatever was about to happen, “you nearly cut your finger off making tea last month.”
“Er, no,” Sherlock muttered, his voice rough, and he cleared his throat before continuing. “Can I have a…one of those?” he said, pointing to the most attractive-looking drink of the trio.
“Strangled?” Sherlock asked, something like guilt settling in his stomach, but John didn’t have to know, and it was just a phone call.
Pulling the cigarette from his lips, he sighed the smoke up to the clouds, closing his eyes as he grated his scalp against the rough brick wall, the stone warmed slightly from a day’s worth of sun.
“Okay then,” he chirped, and Sherlock laughed, shaking his head in amusement as John ambled backward. “I’ll just go cancel that order,” he said, bobbing a thumb back over his shoulder.
“Gaze longingly out the window and sigh,” she snapped, and John rolled his eyes. “Honestly, it’s like watching a casting call for a Jane Austen adaptation. Every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, you turn into Elizabeth Bennet.”
“Hard to argue with that! Well, Donovan should be bringing him out in a few minutes,” he remarked, glancing over his shoulder to a large metal door across the room. “We can fill out all the paperwork over here,” he added, beckoning John to follow him, and John obliged, hovering tight to the inspector’s shoulder as they made their way to an empty desk. “So, you’ve really never met him?” Lestrade asked as he pulled open one of the drawers, riffling through several folders before plucking out a thin stapled packet. “Sherlock, I mean.”
“I know, I know!” Victor interjected, running a hand through his hair as he turned away, pacing a short distance before twisting back. “It doesn’t make any sense, but I- I dunno, I just- You make me
He collected himself quickly, however, and closed his lips, but he still looked decidedly unsettled. “John?” he asked.
“You cannot just ask him,” he said, waving a hand at Sherlock, his manicured brows pinching in a disapproving frown. “You have to build to it. Engage in some polite conversation. Ask him how he’s enjoying his stay at the palace.”
“Yes, I know, you’re gay!” Molly urged, perhaps a little too loudly, her cheeks darkening as she glanced around, but they’d only drawn a handful of curious stares. “I-I just meant,” she continued, leaning forward as she dropped her voice, “that I thought we were closer than acquaintances.”
“A coincidence?” Sherlock snarled, rounding on the sergeant, his hands rattling in fists at his sides. “A
“No,” he panted, shaking his head, and Sherlock was in trouble, so much trouble, trouble he’d forever thank his lucky stars he signed up for. “Not yet.”
“Yeah, well,” John chuckled, rubbing at his neck as he shuffled back a small distance, “it has been awhile I guess.”
“I want cash, Mycroft,” Mrs. Hudson said, pointing a stern finger down at the man. “None of that check nonsense. For all I know, it could bounce, and
John blinked at him, closing his mouth as he realized it was open. “Oh, well…alright then,” he mumbled, moving again as Sherlock continued walking. “Is she your girlfriend? Or ex-girlfriend?”
“So that would make you the clinical psychologist,” John said, and Irene blinked, looking wrong-footed for a moment before laughing, nodding in defeat. “I already know Mary is studying medicine”—he pointed at her and then steepled his fingers, tapping the point to his chin as he looked between Sherlock, Molly, and Greg—“and you said ‘they all,’ so I assume you weren’t included”—he dipped his fingers toward Greg, who nodded in confirmation—“so I’m going with…Molly for medicine undergrad.”
“Fit in?” Sherlock scoffed, snapping to his feet and striding to the window. “Perhaps it’s escaped your notice, but I’m a bit beyond help in the ‘fitting in’ department.”
Sherlock’s forehead furrowed as he looked to the ground. “I’m not sure yet. The flat next door, is the bathroom exactly like this one?”
His skin prickled as he glared at her, but he dropped his eyes furiously to his phone instead of retorting, ashamed to admit he didn’t know what he would have said anyway. More for something to do than actually caring—because he didn’t care whatsoever what John had to say now that it suited his busy schedule—he opened the text message.
“I knew you’d sent Sherlock the secret admirer note,” Molly explained exasperatedly, batting her scarf at him, “and, after he told me you’d seen him with the Pablo Neruda book, I thought- Well, I thought I’d just make it obvious.” She shrugged, looking desperately to Sherlock. “I didn’t think you’d suspect it was someone in the
John did, Sherlock growing gradually stiller as the story spun on. By the time he got to the part where Sherlock found him, the man’s fingers were parchment-white on the leather arms, and John was feeling supremely guilty. And he was about to make it worse. “Actually, there was something I- I thought of,” he said, and Dimmock’s eyes snapped back up from his pad.
He tilted his head. “Going for a one stop shop?” he said, and John bit his lip, dropping his face to his lap and trying not to take sides.
The man closed his notepad with a flick, smiling around at them all. “Alright! I’ll go grab those for you, and then we’ll see about getting you something to eat,” he said, and then turned, whistling to himself as he headed back toward the kitchen.
“I- Did I…say something, or-” John stammered, but Sherlock cut him off with a scrape of his chair as he stood, and John leaned back, blinking up at him with wide blue eyes that didn’t hold a fucking clue.
“Anything I can help you find?” he had asked, and Sherlock had been lost from the start, unfairly faced with possibly the only person who looked good in fluorescent lighting.
Mary made a sound of disgust, rolling her eyes to the ceiling as her tongue protruded past her teeth, and John laughed.
Irene smiled, dropping her chin, but there was nothing amused in her eyes. “You be careful too,” she urged, and he set his jaw, giving her a firm nod before continuing down to the foyer, weaving his way around to the kitchen.
“Wait,” he bade, and John paused, turning back as the brunette pulled something from his back pocket. “I- Mycroft insisted on having someone stay…with your mother,” he explained, flashing a steady look out through his lashes as John’s throat clamped shut. “She doesn’t know, of course, but, just for added security-” He tapered off, tapping at the screen a few times before passing the phone to John, expression uncertain as his eyes darted between the mobile and John’s face.
“I think you’d be great at that,” he said, instant and sincere, and he’d swear her cheeks darkened, if only for a moment. “Would you want to practice?”
Sherlock, predictably, left like the starting gun had just gone off at the Olympics, and John waited for Mary to finish packing her bag before following her to her Maths class again. It might have been becoming a tradition, and John decided he really wouldn’t mind that at all. Waving goodbye to her at the door, he headed back to his dormitory, assuming Sherlock would be there until music.
“He’s in his second semester,” Victor countered, and it was Sherlock’s turn to roll his eyes, though with slightly more cause.
“So, you’re in your last year?” she asked, green eyes bright and blinking rather more than necessary as they fixed on the man making her drink.
“I should probably stay nearby in case something goes awry, but you can go wherever you like,” he answered, not quite meeting John’s eyes.
have Shakespeare to butcher,” Sherlock snipped, closing the door behind them as they headed abreast down the corridor. “I’ve known the lines for weeks.”
“You could’ve told me,” she said softly, looking up through her dark lashes, but Sherlock looked at her fingers, lifting his hand to slide the cigarette out from beneath the delicate digits.
“Sherlock!” John interjected, laughing and thoroughly charmed. “It’s fine, really. This was amazing,” he assured, waving a hand at the now empty canisters in their wooden rack. “Best fireworks display ever.”
“But, if you were,” John barreled on, lifting a placating hand, and Sherlock folded his arms, glowering across at him, “you wouldn’t have to be.” He smiled softly, and Sherlock’s glare slowly faded, eyes dropping to his lap as he self-consciously twisted his fingers at the hem of his jeans. “I mean, yeah, I have friends at school,” John continued, scratching at the back of his neck as he shrugged, “but they’re not- I don’t- None of them are my
“Oh my god!” Irene exclaimed, two fingers pointing at him this time. “That’s right! You- It was some sport thing, wasn’t it?”
“His clothes,” Molly rebutted, jerking her head toward John, who was being extremely unhelpful, biting back a snort and ducking his head.
Desperately, Sherlock searched his face, hoping to find some hint of where to begin his excuses, and was stunned to see there was no need.
The game was brutal, and they were down by only a try as it ticked into the final minutes. They were in possession for another two tackles, but it was unlikely they would get another chance if they didn’t score now, and everyone knew it.
“Only if you say ‘Law’,” he agreed, and she laughed for him, shaking her head out at the room, chin held high.
Inevitably, the prince slammed his utensils down beside his plate with a snarl, rattling his head. “I don’t
“Wait, what?” Sherlock interrupted, something about John making propriety impossible. “I’m not leaving.”
Scanning the contents, he grabbed a bag of frozen peas and a dishcloth, wrapping the cold package in the towel before handing it down over the back of the chair. “Here,” he said, and Irene lowered the carton of samosas to her lap to take it from him.
Mrs. Watson tutted at him, ruffling a hand through his curls before returning to tucking in the corners of his bedsheets, something Sherlock had repeatedly touted the uselessness of, as he was just going to tear it all apart that night anyway, and never do it again, which made the whole teaching process equally pointless.
“Yeah, she’s here,” John answered, pointing behind him to a ridge some ways off. “Her and Harry. We were just about to go to Speedy’s.” The sun reappeared in his irises, his whole demeanor brightening around a grin. “Do you wanna come too?” he urged, and then turned his eager gaze out to the three of them. “We can all go! I already invited Sherlock, so-”
“What does it look like?” Sherlock snapped, gesturing to the spray of photographs surrounding him where he sat cross-legged on the floor.
“Mycroft, look!” he cried, rushing toward his brother, who quickly marked his page with the ribbon stitched into the binding of his book. Stopping in front of the chair, Sherlock pointed to the hat on his head, hoping his finger was roughly in line with the haphazard skull and crossbones drawn on in black marker. “It’s a pirate hat! John made it for me,” he explained, gingerly adjusting the newspaper over his curls. “He made one for him too, but his doesn’t have the skull because he wasn’t the captain.”
“What if you’re allergic to bees?” Sherlock was sitting on the corner of the bed, legs crossed beneath him, his body facing the window as he held his chin in his hands, eyes looking straight ahead.
Sherlock nodded, planning to stray only as far as the nearest source of caffeine, and then smirked, hoisting his bag up higher onto his shoulder. “It’s a date,” he chirped, flicking a two-finger salute to his forehead and spinning on a heel, the slack-jawed look on Molly’s face keeping him warm as he started into the wind toward a cafe he’d seen along the way.
Irene Adler appeared in the opening, wearing a black lace corset and garter belt that strapped to thigh-high stockings, leading down to high, black heels. Her dark hair was pinned up in soft curls, exposing the sharp structure of her face and piercing eyes, and making her skin look all the paler against the deep red of her lipstick, which pulled back over white teeth as she smiled. “Sherlock Holmes,” she crooned, blue eyes dancing as she leaned against the doorframe, scanning him. “New wardrobe?” Her eyebrows flicked teasingly, but the taunt faltered when she caught sight of John hovering at his shoulder. “Oh, and this must be your new pet,” she chirped with a saccharine smile. “The famous John Watson. A pleasure, truly,” she added with a nod, and Sherlock would swear he heard John’s jaw click, “although, I had thought you’d be taller.”
Sherlock huffed a small laugh, but did sit up, eyes shifting between the ties. “That one,” he said, pointing to the deep navy option, dappled with paler blue dots spaced in even rows across the fabric.
He turned to find Sherlock still focused on his phone, and thought he may have imagined hearing his voice entirely. “Sorry?” he asked, just to be safe.
“No, apparently you can’t!” John challenged, stomping a few steps forward before Sherlock could retreat to even the distance. “Sherlock, I like you,” he said, stern and even and not the slightest bit uncertain, and, though it was kind of absolutely everything he’d wanted to hear since John Watson had walked up to the front of the classroom two years ago and been forcibly introduced by the teacher, that was precisely why he didn’t believe it. “And this is not a prank, okay? It never was, I- I know it’s weird and kind of crazy and probably really hard to believe, but-”
floor,” Sherlock answered, not slowing his stride as John stopped in front of the machines, but he hadn’t expected Sherlock to wait.
“Yeah, er, see ya,” Sherlock muttered back, the door rattling closed a moment later, leaving the two of them alone in the now-silent café.
Taylor Jordan was being insufferable, flapping his finger in anyone’s face as spit flew with the blame from his mouth. “That was a terrible kick, Kendall!” he snapped after their latest play-the-ball, where Kendall Price had apparently not passed it back to him adequately.
her!?” he hissed at John, who shrugged with a guilty grimace, and Mrs. Watson laughed, shaking her head as she beckoned them with a wave of the towel.
Sherlock smiled, dropping his head back to his drink as he blushed, and, though he thought he heard John chuckle, the blond had disappeared once again when he looked up, only his striped sleeve visible as it shifted the mouse across the desk. Sherlock sipped at the tea as he went back to his work, smiling secretly to himself, and, though he didn’t normally take milk, he drained every drop.
“I was gonna put it back,” he said, tapping a hand to the garment when John gave him a curious look. “I just couldn’t find my jumper, and it was right there, and-”
“Mrs. Hudson remodeled before I moved in,” Sherlock explained, twisting at John’s fingers as he held their hands in front of his face, looking down at the contact points of their skin with still lingering disbelief.
John froze, his hands stilling where they were hidden in a drawer. “What was that?” he murmured in an almost painfully transparent attempt at nonchalance.
Sherlock might as well have skipped classes on Tuesday for all the good being there did him. He hadn’t even spent much time in any of them, excusing himself in just about every one to go to the bathroom, a euphemism for sneaking out back to smoke he didn’t think anyone was buying anymore, but he couldn’t be bothered, what was left of his pack already gone as he tried to burn away the anxiety fraying at his nerves.
“One week,” Sherlock confirmed, lifting a finger, and Greg grinned, clapping him on the shoulder while Mike simply smiled.
Sherlock didn’t move, staring at the sliver of John’s face he could see as he watched the man’s shoulders rise and fall with his breaths. “John?” he said softly after a long moment, and John froze a second before spinning sharply around, grabbing Sherlock by the wrist.
John frowned, looking down at her actor-earnest eyes, and then his attention was drawn away by a snort, and he snapped a glare to Sherlock, grey eyes glittering overtop of pale fingers he was using to muffle his chuckling.
“So, er,” he muttered, lifting a hand to rub at the back of his neck, “how do I get to Baker Street from here?”
John couldn’t pin down how he knew, no moment of epiphany in which anything untoward had happened, but, regardless, he did still
“There are things you don’t know!?” John said with mock disbelief, mouth stretching wide as his eyes popped, but he quickly broke into a smile as Sherlock sneered, jabbing him lightly in the ribs. John chuckled, shaking his head to the ceiling, and then shrugged, trying to primarily shift his right shoulder instead of the one Sherlock was attached to. “There isn’t much you don’t know,” he admitted, blinking up at the plaster as he racked his brain. “I’m afraid of snakes,” he offered, but Sherlock shook his head.
“Somewhat,” Sherlock replied, moving farther to one side of the sofa before John returned. “She likes- Hang on. IT WAS THE TURN-UPS ON HIS JEANS!”
John visibly tensed beside him, and Sherlock fought not to roll his eyes. Honestly, how could he possibly be worried? What was about to happen was so obvious, it was almost boring.
is.” He rattled his head as he looked away, lips still twitching as they pressed together. “You- You don’t know what
“A what?” Sherlock muttered, looking down at the invitation, and then turned his attention back to John as the blond chuckled.
“John!” Molly half-laughed, shaking her head at him. “It’s just a girl!” she said, throwing a hand up at the window. “Just someone watching him practice. He might not even
Jeanette nodded. “My maternal grandmother lived outside Barcelona. We would visit her often when I was a child, and I fell in love with the country and the people. And the weather,” she added with a gentle laugh. “She passed away when I was 16, and, so, when it came time to go away for school, I suppose I…wanted to be closer to those memories.”
He dropped his gaze, finding Sherlock’s hand as he threaded their fingers, and then bobbed his head up the street, tugging Sherlock a bit to get him moving again.
“Oh, drums, definitely,” the blond teased, serious expression breaking to a grin, and Sherlock smiled, twisting the bow self-consciously in his hand. “It was beautiful,” John said suddenly, and Sherlock snapped his eyes back up. The man smiled sheepishly, eyes flitting to the table below before braving Sherlock’s again. “What was it? What you were playing.”
Sherlock gingerly untapped his envelope from his desk, holding the paper evenly in front of him, careful not to bend it as he moved toward the door. He noticed John approach Mrs. Hudson’s desk, his own bulging envelope in hand as he requested a bag, and Sherlock was just cresting over the beginning of a downward spiral of panic when John glanced over his shoulder, eyes searching out his.
In the end, the decision was to choose everything, half the starters menu and the entire dessert menu being called down to the kitchen as John giggled in the background at Sherlock having to insist “Yes, all of them” more than once until he was silenced with a projectile pillow. Of course, the second Sherlock was off the phone, it hit him in the back of the head, but that was to be expected, he supposed.
“Chardonnay, gin and tonic, and vodka cran,” the bartender said, thumping the three drinks down in front of Sherlock as he spun around. “Last two will be right over,” he said with a parting customer-service smile before darting away.
“How thoughtful of you, Sherlock. Thank you for asking,” John interrupted, smiling brightly, and Sherlock scowled at him before going back to reading, but he did lower the book further to expose most of his face. “Biology, chemistry, and English literature,” John continued, watching Sherlock’s face carefully.
happened!?” he shouted, and Sherlock managed to suppress his wince, not wanting to close his eyes for even a second. “You and Erickson we’re supposed to be-” He stopped, shoulders lowering, and John blinked his eyes down to the floor, shaking his head.
“I’m 23!” Sherlock spluttered, glaring as John laughed, and then pulled his coffee toward him by the handle. “It’s a bit disconcerting,” he muttered, tipping the cup slightly toward him, “drinking something that’s
“John!” he spluttered, blushing at the octave of his voice, but the owner of the name only smiled benignly, apparently oblivious to his embarrassment. “What are you- It’s Tuesday.”
The phone clicked, their faces freezing on the screen for a moment, and then John was pulling the phone toward them, tapping and swiping at the screen with his left hand, the right still hanging off of Sherlock’s elbow.
Which is where John will find it after they graduate, unpacking the box labelled “bedroom” when they move into 221B Baker Street. He’ll insist it fell out when he was putting it up on a shelf in their closet, but Sherlock will know better, and stubbornly suggest he might need to move into the downstairs bedroom after all if his privacy is going to continue to be invaded.
“I have no idea,” he said, the heavy resignation in his tone clearly directed toward more than just Moriarty, and they all fell silent as Sherlock started back toward the kitchen, John feeling two sets of eyes boring into him as he watched the back of Sherlock’s retreating head. “Was there anything else?” he asked, flicking on the kettle before leaning over a book resting on the kitchen table, his forehead furrowed as if in deep concentration, but his eyes never moved.
“What do we even do?” he asked, peeling down the unused duvet. “Untuck all the corners or- OOF!” Something swatted him across the side of the head, and he staggered to the left, lifting a hand to his ear. Looking up, he saw John smirking at him, pillow in hand, and his mouth dropped open in affront, prompting a smirk from the blond. “Did you just-”
“Why not?” John asked, plucking the computer back up and placing it on his lap, staring down at the offending paragraphs.
“Well, I’m soaked,” John muttered as they entered, stretching his dripping arms out to his sides. “What time is it?”
Sherlock watched John, who was now looking out the window to his left, and thought frantically about how to respond. There were medieval torture methods he would prefer to watching grown men chase a ball, but John had invited him, and Sherlock had no idea what to do about it. Being completely clueless was not something he was accustomed to, but he simply had no data to inform him in this particular scenario. Was this something roommates did, go to one another’s sporting activities, even if they were only try-outs? Sherlock had never been much of an acquaintance to anyone, and especially not the type to offer moral support, but if John was asking that of him, if John was nervous, if Sherlock’s presence would help…
“So are you,” she replied, and there was no edge to her smile now, and John felt the knots in his stomach loosen as the barometric pressure seemed to drop around them. “Even if you’re terrible at Shakespeare,” she added with a cheeky tilt of her head.
“You’re right,” she’d agreed, always a bad sign. “You should stick your tongue in his mouth and find out.”
It had been about a week since the night that will live in infamy, and they had more or less settled back to normal, if not even better. Sure, John had been a bit distant those first couple days, but, with gargantuan effort, Sherlock had given him his space, squirreling himself away in his lab so he wouldn’t be tempted to push. It was there John had found him, rapping on the door with a bag of Haribo and a mumbled invitation to pick up where they’d left off in
“Not quite. You’ve got a 1:30. Sounds like an exploratory meeting, he was kinda squirrelly on the phone”—she wrinkled her nose, peeling the top sheet of a notepad off her desk—“but he asked for you personally.”
Sherlock huffed, rolling his eyes as he snatched the phone away from Irene’s pale digits, the girl grinning across at him in unrestrained glee as she lifted the burning cigarette to her lips.
“How do you know people do it?” Sherlock asked, pausing halfway through his address. “Couldn’t they just lie?”
He stood a moment longer, just to be contrary, and then sighed vehemently, stepping forward to grab his coat from the wardrobe.
“Don’t be absurd,” Sherlock scoffed, but the pink bleeding up from his collar belied the nonchalance. “Why would I care if you talked to Mycroft? Although, really, why would
“God!” John snarled, throwing the cab door shut before moving to meet Sherlock on the pavement. “I’ve never
Sherlock swept his eyes around the room again before returning his gaze to the window, watching the heavy snowflakes drift and swirl against the mountain backdrop. “Toto,” he sighed to the walls, “I’ve a feeling we’re not in Kansas anymore.”
hold still,” he stressed, each syllable deliberate, leaving no room for dissention, and a tingle shot up Sherlock’s neck at the cool confidence as his brain went disconcertingly quiet.
“Us?” Sherlock spluttered, and then hissed in pain as Irene yanked his chemistry textbook out from under him, his elbows hitting hard against the table.
John blinked out at the movie a moment, a crease forming between his brows as he double-checked with his brain that he’d heard that correctly, and then a broad grin bloomed across his face, and he quickly bit his lip to stifle it. “Okay,” he mumbled, and Sherlock huffed a faint laugh, leaning more heavily against him. They were quiet for a time, Sherlock shifting against him with every rise and fall of his chest, and then John frowned, tipping his head down as a thought occurred to him. “How did you know what it was?” he asked, and Sherlock shrugged, as if having expected the query.
Sherlock frowned between the beverage and her eyes. “What are you doing here?” he asked, taking the drink, though he did give it a wary sniff before imbibing.
