Cas slid off of Dean and stood up. He began to slowly undo the button and slid the zipper down. Dean could almost hear music playing as Cas decided to tease him a little while doing what Dean asked him too.
He walked over the man, still standing by the piano. Oh holy shit, was the first thing that ran through his mind as he look at the stranger for the first time. Dean could tell that the man’s dark hair had tried to be styled, but it still looked like too many fingers had been ran through it, and he had pools of endless blue eyes. He knew those eyes.
It all dawned on Dean at the name, “Sammy, the omega that went missing. He was a story that people used to tell. I didn’t even think he was real.”
In all honestly, Dean didn’t think he expected that answer. He wanted it, of course,but he never really thought that Cas would want that, would want him. Dean took the offered bottle and took one more swig before putting it on the table.
Sam was over the hills happy when Dean had brought Emmy home, and in all honestly has probably made as many bottles and changed as many diapers as Dean had. He doted on his niece, and would watch her after school when Dean had to work.
“It was never that. I was so messed up about the fact that you were an alpha. It frustrated me so much. How could I think that another alpha could be my mate. I fought with myself, to keep myself under control. Then you joined the team and I had to be around you. It was so hard. I watched you interact with the others and saw you laugh. Everything about you was perfect.”
Emmy was having so much fun playing. She loved the monkey bars. She played on them at home and when Nana and Daddy took her to the park, now she gets to play on them at school too. She was swinging to the next bar when she saw Miss Lisa talking to the man that she meet on her birthday. He said that she would see him again and he’s here. This is awesome. She moved to grab the next bar and missed. She was scared as she fell to the ground. She screamed out in pain as everyone ran toward her.
I'm not done, I'm no loser
Sam was what he was proud of. Dean might not have made it big, but Sammy was going to. He had gotten a full ride to Stanford and Dean made sure that his little brother had everything that he needed. Dean lived with Bobby until Lisa said she was pregnant three years ago and Dean stepped up, getting a home for him, Lisa and what he thought was their baby. He even married her before Ben was born.
"Lawrence, Kansas," Cas said.
“I, umm, I wanted to thank you for letting us stay and the clothes.” Cas smiled it was odd seeing Dean acting so shy, “Umm, are you going to bed?” Cas asked.
Castiel smiled up at Dean from his place close to Dean’s knees, without any other warning, other than the predatory smile, Cas leaned down and took all of Dean into his mouth. Cas sucked and licked causing Dean to squirm below. He loved it, loved this.
Cas smiled, “alright.” It took him only a few seconds to find the DVD before popping it into the xbox that sat beside the large tv. H le walked back over to the couch and turned on the controller to start the movie.
He jumped slightly and wrapped his arms tighter around Gracie, startled by seeing Dean’s face so close to his.
“Are you insane,” Dean could hear the venom in his voice, “what if she is an Omega? Do you know the last time an omega D'Angelo was born?”
“Don’t touch me,” Dean spat at Cas, “you did more than hurt me, Cas, you broke me. Do you know how hard a rejection is to deal with while you're pregnant. Nothing could make it better. I spent weeks in bed. I could barely move. It felt like something was trying to tear me apart. Care to guess how many times I almost miscarried. Why do you think she is so small? I moved to Bobby’s after that first week. He’s a doctor, helped explain a lot about me, about what was going on, and how it happened. Wanna know what the worst part is?”
Dean smiled, “I’m looking for Castiel Novak.”
“That it is. Well I’ll see you later Dean. Welcome back.”
We have had the time of our lives
We hold on tight
“I didn’t want Andrea anymore than she wanted me. You gave me no choice in it. In any of it. I love him and I know that confesses you, considering you have no idea what love is. But I’m done with you, Michael, I’m of age and an alpha, by law I’m free,” Cas’ eyes turned bright red as he growled out, “Now, leave.”
“The fire that you tried to burn me with, it made me who I am
Sam stood up and flung his arms around Dean’s neck, sobbing softly into the musty smelling leather jacket, soaking in the smell of Dean and John. “Love ya, Dean. Be good okay, Jerk,” Sam said pulling away and wiping the back of his jacket sleeve across his face.
“Wait,” Cas called to Dean, “ Do you remember what I told you that day?” Dean stopped with his hand on the door, about to open it, “ I said that I would always love you and I do. I told you that we would be together. I truly thought that we could, at least for a while, but I messed up. Michael called me while we were asleep, told me I needed to come home. He had something for me to do. I rushed home, because as you know Michael isn’t an alpha to mess with. When I got home he was waiting for me. The first thing he did was scent me and all he smelled was you. He knew what we had been doing, not the claim, but enough. He kicked my ass and then told me if I had anything else to do with you, he’d make you disappear, and he would, you know it. He told me it was time for me to be an alpha, not a bitch. I didn’t do it because I wanted to leave you, I did it to save you.”
They all walked out the door together, Dean and Cas said brief goodbyes to Sam before helping Emmy into the pink booster seat in the back seat of the impala.
“Cas,” Dean said quietly through the door, a small call. “Do you want me to leave?” his voice was still so quiet, just loud enough to get through the door.
But I'm so glad that I stayed true to who I am”
Dean leans down to cover Cas's body with his own, kissing him eagerly before rolling his hips and hitting Cas's sweet spot again, causing the smaller man to gasp and clench the sheets again. "Fuck, Dean… Fuck me…" He moans through Dean's thrusts.
Dean had never heard a voice so deep and gravely before. He knew that he had been caught; he might as well fess up, “Yeah, “ he called back in voice that he would have like to be much more in control. Dean stepped into the aisle and began to walk toward the man on the stage.
“I’m so sorry, Dad.” Dean’s watery eyes had began to leak. “It’s my fault. I took my eyes off the road. We could have died.”
Cas chuckled into to phone, “Calm down, the brown house on the corner of Main and East Park. But, you don’t have to rush over, I am ok.” He expressed each syllable hoping that she would get the point.
More students began to come into the locker room again, getting ready for the next class. They all laughed and talked and joked, having no idea what had just happened. The bell rang again sending the boys out of the room and into the gym.
He took a moment knowing that Dean wouldn't care. He was fangirling in his head a little. He was in Dean Winchester's black beauty. He was about to drive the one thing that everyone wanted a piece of in high school.
“Okay” was all Sam said. Honestly Sam didn't like the fact that Cas was here. Yeah he understood something tragic had happened to Cas. He knew that and he knew he was being sorta assish by not being more sympathetic for the omega but to Sam all he could see when he thought of Cas was, looking at nineteen year old Dean in the eyes and seeing a half dead alpha who was holding a screaming infant that her omega father didn't want. Sam couldn't fathom why anyone wouldn't want Emmy no matter how she got here, every inch of her is completely amazing.
“It's okay,” Cas said, “you’re not the first person I’ve played for.” There was confidence that Dean never heard in high school in those words. He was a different person and Dean could hear it in his voice.
“I’m afraid that my book selection is slim on kids books,” Cas said smiling back at Dean. “Look who’s awake Gracie,” Cas stood up with Gracie and walked over to Dean. “She got fussy about an hour ago but I found a bottle in her bag and so I  fed her.” Cas handed Gracie over to Dean, “I also called your mom and told her that you both feel asleep. She seemed pleased and said that you hadn't been sleeping well either.”
Dean didn’t smile as the last photo of Benny ficked on the screen. It was one of him in his ACUs, and American flag hanging behind him, that damn hat sitting on his head that made him look to good for any one person to look and in black bold print with his name, Benjamin “Benny” Lafitte, and the year he was born and died below it, 1987-2010. Dean pulled back out his flask held it up to the picture of Benny and down some more of the whisky.
She flipped the frying chicken and said, “He’s upstairs with Grace.”
Dean threw the last of his bags in the trunk of bobby’s old ‘71 Chevelle. He looked back at his family standing on the porch. John was standing behind Mary, whose eyes seemed to be watering, but Dean won't say anything about that. John had his arms wrapped tight around Mary, grounding her. Sam was sitting on the top step, not looking up at Dean or Bobby. Bobby was leaned against the passenger door waiting for Dean to say goodbye.
John sighed and flopped down in an open chair across from Bobby and his Omega, his Mary. He wasn’t sure what he was doing with Kate but she was young and full of life. She made him feel younger, more alive. He loved Mary. No matter what he will always love Mary but Kate made him feel special again and a beta can’t break an omega bond so he thought his secret would be ok but he was wrong.
So sorry about the wait guys. I have been stuck on this chapter and it's not finished but I felt like this was a good place to end it at so y'all didn't have to wait any longer. Thanks to everyone who has commented on or kudos this loves y'all.
“Not really,” Dean replied pulling Cas in closer.
He knew there was no way he could let go of Dean no matter what he did. Dean slid his arm around Cas and Cas decide he would stay here as long as he could. In Dean's arms he didn't need anything else. He felt safe in the man's arms. Perhaps a part of him knew that his mama was right that Dean would leave and he was trouble but Cas was going to ride this out as far as it would go.
“Pizza’s good with me, but you know me just whatever you want I can find something,” Dean looked back at Cas smiling as Cas gave him a weird look.
Dean nodded and walked out the room closing the door gently behind him. He couldn’t explain everything that was bouncing around in head. Cas hated him. Dean couldn’t blame him. He missed Cas, so much, during the first few months. He felt like he was dying, like there was a part of chest missing. So he did what he always did, he made himself forget. Until now.
“Burn, burn, burn
Dean looked around the room he was standing in, it was a homey little room, pictures of Cas and Gabe were spread around in a few places and he even saw one of Emmy, a sweet one of Emmy holding the bear that Cas had gotten her for her birthday. Dean walked over to the picture and rubbed a thumb over his little girl's face, “My sweet Emmy,” he whispered.
Hey guys. So some time has gone by most spent as it was described in the last chapter. I do hope y'all enjoy this. thanks for the kudos and comments. i wont give it up. love you guys.
It took Emmy some time before working up the courage to ask Cas. They were standing on the frozen aisle looking at ice cream, Emmy picked up the Minions dvd and studied the case for a moment, “Cassie, can I ask you something,” she asked softly, still looking at the case.
“Not a baby, Mom,” Dean groaned and hugged his mom back. “Love you too, I’ll be back soon.”
Dean groaned, adding, “Pants,” between pants of breaths, “lose ‘em.”
“Naw, man, I need to go home. Jess is coming over later today anyway, now that Cas is better.”
Are ending, but I'll always remember”
Dean wasn’t sure why Cas was letting him hold him but god it felt like heaven, holding his sweet omega safe in his arms, where he needs to be, where he should have always have been. Where he would have been if Dean had not have been so weak that day. If he had listen to the omega and left him. They wouldn’t have Emmy but he might have Cas. The weight of the omega in his arms felt like it should always be there. Dean removed his arms from Cas giving the omega the space he needed to back away from Dean. It was Dean’s turn to mumble a “Sorry,” before turning around and leaving the room beckoning Cas to follow him.
“Yes, Dean?” the teacher asked.
It was then that Naomi spoke up and said, “You can each miss one night after that twenty dollars will be taken from your allowance.”
Dean looked down at the small little bundle in his arms she was wrapped up tightly in a soft pink plaid blanket, that Dean didn’t remember buying. Her bright blue eyes were wide open and she was looking at Dean, like Cas did, like she was staring into his soul. Dean smiled at his Mary, “Yea, Mom, that’d be great.”
“I bet,” Cas laughed.
"Oh baby, you feel so good," Dean moans in Cas's ear before tugging on his earlobe causing Cas to shiver and moan beneath him. He has had both male and female partners before Cas but none of them ever felt as good as Cas. He thrust in and out at a speedy pace relishing in the moans and screams he can pull from the younger man's lips.
Bobby told Dean to lay on bed and wrapped two bands around his stomach, “This one,” he grunted, pointing to the blue band with the pink small monitor attached to it, “is to keep a check on her heart rate and the other is to monitor the contractions that you're having. That's why it hurts so bad, but we’re gonna stop them.”
“I’m gonna go wake up Cas.” Dean said turning away from Sam and walking toward the hallway.
To these memories
Hey guys. so sorry about the wait. Hope y'all like it. Please let me know how y'all feel. And just so y'all know. Y'all are the best. I never thought this would be so liked but 95 comments and 264 kudos later let me know different. I love hearing from y'all. And I try to make things realisticish but I also need to move things o.n so please enjoy.
Dean relaxed in the passenger seat. He would miss his life here, but he knew that this was best. He tried at school, but after the final rejection outside the lunchroom, he couldn’t do it anymore. He hoped that Crowley would show up, so he would have someone by his side, but at the end of the week there was still no sign of him. There was a rumor going around that he beat the shit out of cas and Michael, or Cas, got rid of him. Dean really didn’t want to believe that but he knew it was possible.
Cas pushed up from the floor and walked the few steps to the sink. He looked up at the mirror. His reflection almost looked strange. His eyes seemed brighter, hair less dull. His skin even seemed to glow a tad, not the lackluster pale he usually sees.
Dean almost went into labor three more times before he hit the 37 week. Each time worse than the time before. At 37 weeks and three days, something happened. Dean woke screaming in pain, blood covering his thighs, the bed sheets and covers were soaked. Benny had been staying in Dean’s bed since the the first time Dean had went into labor.
“She’s amazing. Is she yours?” Dean asked looking out the front window. He was feeling sick but he could make it until he got home. He had to, no way he was throwing up in front of Crowly or near this car.
“Shower, Dean,” Cas snapped back at Dean as he was pulling out boxers and a pair of loose grey sweats. “No offence but you stink.”
He turned right down a hallway just past the offices. The hallway was still lined with country flags. Each hanging the same length apart and high enough so that they didn't touch the floor. The elevator was in this hallway, the staff and faculty only elevator, but that didn't stop Dean, Benny and Ash from acting like crazy people in it or seeing if they could beat it down to the bottom floor. Ash even rewired it once so that you would go to the wrong floors. It was great, and it took the teacher's way too long to figure it out.
“When he was four and had started school. I went to college, mostly online. I got my degree in business, started working at the company and began to spend less time with Gabe and just left him to the nannies.”
Cas realized that he really liked, maybe even loved Dean in this car. It was about six months after he had moved down here and he and Dean had hit it off real well from the beginning. Cas knew it was because his omega like Dean’s alpha, but Cas ignored the omega’s call and became friends, then best friends with the snarky green eyed alpha. They had been out to the fair that day and Dean had won Cas a big ol’ bear. It was meant as a joke or well to Dean anyway but to Cas that bear meant a lot. They spent the whole day doing stupid shit around the fair.
“Why do you care?” Cas snapped, looking at Dean like he was his least favorite person on earth, “You didn’t care a lunch today, did you. No, just sat there while your bullies of a friends made half the lunchroom laugh at me.”
Dean spent most of the next two weeks in bed pretending to be sick. His shoulder was completely healed and unfortunately the only reminder of what he and Cas had done. He did manage to pull himself out of his room for Christmas and New Years pretending to be ok. He hadn’t heard from Cas since he left the house that day. Needless to say that Dean was heartbroken. Cas had left him, he knew that it would happen he just didn’t think it would be so permanent and done so quickly.
“She woke up a few minutes ago,” Mary said shaking the bottle and testing on her hand, “we can get her back to sleep why don’t you get a shower and go to sleep yourself. You don’t have to do this all on your own. We are here to help baby.” She handed the bottle to John and walked over to Dean. She kissed him on the forehead before shooing him upstairs to take a shower then back to bed.
Next he decides to call Michael, pulling up his number he pressed Michael’s name, listened to it ring and waited for him to answer. After a few rings Michael still hadn’t answered so Cas hung up and pulled up his messages. He scrolled down until he found Michaels name, tapped on it and sent him a message telling him that he was at home and about to go to sleep.
Dean walked over to the bunk beds, sitting the pie on the bedside table, he sat down on the edge of the bed. “What's wrong?” Dean asked.
John needed his rest. She needed to be rested for him. How important it was for her to take care of herself while they take care of him.
Cas whimpered and opened the front door before hurrying through it, he expected Dean to follow and jumped in surprise when the door slammed shut behind him. “Lock the door, Cas,” he heard Dean growl through the door, still channeling his alpha. Cas did as Dean said and slid down the door after it clicked.
He didn't know about most of them but Marshall had been in killed in Iraq also, so the town paid tribute to him, much like they had Benny. As for Ron, well Dean didn't think that anyone would forget what happened to that kid, turned out Ron was schizo, went off his meds, and he robbed one of the main banks in town, claiming that the manager had laser eyes.
Dean didn’t remember much of the night before other than the excruciating pain but when he woke back up his daughter was here along with John, Mary, Sam, Benny, Ash, Garth and Bobby. His sweet little Gracey was snuggled in her grandmother’s arms. John was looking down on her with a look of such pure adoration. Dean knew that the little girl already had the alpha wrapped around her little finger.
It was a simple quilt that his Grandma Deanna had made when his mom was smaller. It was green with silver patchwork woven into it. It was a large enough to cover a queen bed. It would be a little big to cover the couch but Dean grabbed it because he knew it was Cas’ favorite.
Dean was in school the next day, full of life, smiling and laughing. He was looking for Crowley wanted to thank him for his help, but he couldn’t find the short scottish kid. He grabbed a few books from his locker and headed to his homeroom class, arriving a little later than he usually did, so most of the desk were already taken. Cas was already in his desk, he looked like he had gotten the hell beat out him. Dean hoped Michael hadn’t done that, but he knew Michael wouldn’t leave visible marks, he never did.
Cas moved away from Dean and rolled over, so he was face to face with the green eyed beauty, “I’m sorry,” Cas said in low, rough voice. Dean was laying behind him, on his side, just looking at Cas, like he was the most precious thing in the world, and maybe to Dean, Cas really was.  Cas looked down at the nasty marred flesh at the top of Dean's collar. “I should not have done that.”
“Where’s Grace?” Cas asked.
Dean pulled into the driveway. Sammy sat beside him, up front, and John was stretched out along the back seat. Dean and Sam climbed out before they helped John out back of the driver’s side. They helped him inside and sat him down on the couch. Sam flopped down beside John, and Dean walked into the kitchen, “Where’s Cas?” he asked Mary after placing a kiss on her check.
Dean stepped forward, “Maybe you shouldn’t have tried to pimp out your son to begin with, you asshole.” Dean smiled as Michael frowned.
“Cas was right, Michael, it’s time for you to leave.” Dean reached over and grabbed Cas’ hand holding him in place.
After pulling a few more sheets of pink tissue paper she pulled out a porcelain tea seat. It was rather beautiful. The cups were lined with tiny pink roses, along with the lid of the tea pot and the rims of the plates. “Look Daddy look, a tea set, we can have tea parties. Do you think we can find him, so he can come to Daddy?”
“It’s Crowley, Ma’am. Dean’s not feeling good. He asked to go to the bathroom and he was gone for about ten minutes when Mr. Copeland asked me to go look for him. I found him in the restroom still puking his guts out. Think his sick, Miss Mary.”
Dean was trying to keep himself together but everything around him was driving him crazy. Cas smelled so good, so strong and sweet, and so close for the taking, but Dean had to remind himself that Cas wasn’t his to take.
Mary spent most of time at the hospital, either working or sitting with John.
“Your Lisa, right?” Cas asked the brunette. She had changed some since high school.
Dean walked over to the steps and sat down beside Cas, “What happened?”
Dean sat on the top step of  his back porch watching Emmy play on her swing set. Dean loved his daughter. She had been his pride and joy for five years. He couldn't imagine his life without her. “Daddy, watch,” she called out as she ran up the slide. She was beautiful. Her dirty blond hair blew around her face as she turned around to slide back down. Her blue eyes shined as she smiled and giggled. It was early on a Saturday afternoon. Just about time to start  up the grill. The guests would be over soon.
Emmy placed it down beside the bear and pulled out more paper. She emptied the rest of the paper out of the box and there were two more gifts and a card. A large baby doll in a white dress with pink and purple flowers on it, the card and a small rectangular box sat on top of the doll.
In the time of our lives”
The first few months at Bobby’s were anything but easy. Dean was sick a lot, Bobby said it was a mixture of losing both his Claimed Alpha and his Familia Alpha. He said that Dean would adjust would take a few months, or he could go back, Dean shut that idea down fast. So Dean dealt with the pain that was randomly tearing him apart.
Dean turned around to face Cas. He grasped the hem of Cas’ black shirt and pulled it over his head, “I love you too, Cassie,” Dean smiled before kissing the alpha. “Lay down,” he mumbled to Cas and gently shoved his shoulder. Cas did as Dean asked and situated until he was laying flat on his back.
“Sure,” Dean said smiling. Inside, he felt like screaming Dean knew that Cas didn’t want him here, no matter how much Dean wanted to make things better, he just didn’t know how. How could he make up for what he had taken, and he knew that the had taken everything from the young omega.
Dean let the quiet settle back in around him for a few minutes before the door was opened again. Cas walked back to where Dean was and stopped in front of him, “Ash looked very concerned when I told him you wanted your keys. Seriously thought he wasn't going to give them to me, but here you go.” Cas held out Dean’s keys, but he pulled them back when he noticed the small timers in Dean’s hand as he reached for them.
“Yeah, hold on. Sarah, can you watch my class for a minute?”
Cas looked up from his book as the old rusted car passed by. The car was going slower than it should have been. It took Cas a minute to realize that it was Bobby’s old clunker and that Dean was in the passenger seat. He waved slowly at Cas as they passed. Cas smiled and went back to his book.
Dean sat still for a few more moments before following Cas out the room. He finished the trek through the hall to the double doors that lead out to the gym. Dean walked over to the gym pausing only for a moment to look up at the sky, wishing for the thousandth time that night that Benny was walking in beside him.
“Then the alpha told him that it would be best if they left without telling anyone. Soon the alpha became strict, telling the omega what to do, where to go. Then it became, never go outside. He used the bond to control the omega. He was a different alpha by the time the omega was pregnant with their first child. He was 16 when their son was born. The omega thought that giving the alpha an alpha son would make him happy, hoped that it would bring back the alpha he loved. It didn’t.” Gabe, Dean figured anyway, flopped down beside him and sighed. It seemed that this was a hard story to remember, to tell especially to a stranger.
Dean sat in the stone bench in front of a marbled stone, “Hey mom,” he said quietly. “Emmy started school today. She’s in Lisa’s class but it was still horrible, well it was horrible for me. She held on and didn't want me to leave, anymore than I wanted to leave. But she was beautiful, she wore that pink dress you bought her. It fits so well now. Lisa helped with her hair, you know I was never really any good with that.”
Are ending
He thought about it alot. He thought about what Dean had done that day. He wanted to be over it. He wanted to push past that day and move on. He wanted to be there for Emmy and a part of him wanted to be there for Dean, a huge part of him. However, at times when he would be at Dean’s playing with Emmy and Dean would walk behind him and all he can think about is the fear and anger he felt that day. He had worked through a lot with Pam, his therapist, and he knew that nothing could change what Dean had done, but he also knew how much Dean was trying to make things ok.
Dean sighed, and then chuckled, “You could be one hundred percent my brother and I’d still fill this way. I’ve tried to hide it, to deny it but whatever is between us is something that I’m done fighting.”
And the fire you put me through turned me into gold
Dean sighed, “Do I know you?” he asked, already knowing the answer. The piano man knew Dean and from the sound of his voice was not a fan of his in high school, not that Dean could blame the man if he was one of Dean’s favorite victims.
“You hurt Cas, Dean, bad enough to leave him almost always scared. He jumps at the slightest touch. He spends all day locked in his room, if he isn’t in class. The smell of an alpha makes him cry. You damaged him. If you make him go back, he will resent you. He will hate everything: you, himself, and eventually the baby. Your child will grow up wondering what she did wrong. Why Cas doesn’t love her. One day you will break him beyond repair.”
“No way,” Cas said, sitting down with on the couch with Emmy, “Have you seen it yet?”
“I went after you when you left that night but I couldn't find you. I spent weeks working up the courage to tell you how I felt but by the time I did you were with Jo.
Cas's mother watched as her son drove away with Dean Winchester. Cas was 17. She could stop him but only for a few months and he would resent her the whole time. School was done so she let him make his own choices. She knew Dean would never stay with her son and she had tried to tell Cas over and over. But at 17, he thought he knew everything and Cas refused to listen, saying that Dean loved him and wouldn’t hurt him.
“He’s inside with your mama,” she told him, sitting down beside him. “You know how she loves that boy. Still swears he looks just like you. Today seems to be a good day, doesn’t it.”
Dean smiled as she laughed. It was the greatest sound in the world. She was getting so big almost five months old. She get baby food every other day and day is a baby food day.  Dean walked into the living. John handed Gracie to him, and Dean helped him up off the couch.
hey y'all so super short chapter here. I was kinda stuck on the convo part between the two and really wanted to post something before christmas.  I hope y'all like it. oh and just a little heads up next chapter is almost done and there a time jump. love you guys! merry christmas folks.
Dean didn’t say anything, hell he could barely remember lunch. He walked into the cafeteria in a haze. He had just walked in on Amara and her new guy.
“It’s ok,” Cas said laying a comforting hand on Dean's knee, “I forgave you both a long time ago.”
Cas smiled as he thought about what to dare Dean to do, “I dare you to run around the outside of the house in your boxers while singing Katy Perry’s Firework.”
Cas was still sleeping on the couch. Mary had told him that they would figure out  different arrangement after John got home.
"Thank you, son. What was that boys name?"
“It’s your family, isn’t it?” Dean asked looking at the black and white checkered floor.
She pulled John’s pillow to him and hugged it close. She felt utterly alone. The only comfort she has was knowing that he was wake.
Cas slowly breaths through the pain until it subsides to a dull ache and is replaced by the pleasure of Dean being inside him. He wants more he needs more. Now! "God, Dean, move! Do something." He voices filled with lust and desire.
“But I have things to do,” Dean snapped harshly at his father.
“I didn't know I was playing for anyone,” he said not moving from where he was standing by the piano.
“What?” Dean asked, “Yeah, thats me,” he was starting to wake up the rest of the way, “you mean Cas? Yeah, he’s mine,” he stumbled out.
Cas as he slowly pushes in. Dean stopped to let Cas get used to the burning feeling as Dean stretches him.
“I do,” John said, pushing himself up straight, “Gabriel.” The look on Michael’s face was murderous. “You liked your omega’s in high school. Did you think the entire town would forget about your love child with Lucifer. You sent him away when he was, what, fifteen, all because he had a little too much of Luci. You're pathetic.
Mary walked through the door sometime after nine. She didn't want to leave the hospital but the nurses persuaded her. They told her the same things that she has to tell people.
Cas watched Dean leave the room and picked up the syrup to pour over his pancakes. Dean was about to come back and they were gonna eat breakfast together and Cas had no idea what to say. All of this seemed like a dream, he felt like he was gonna wake up at any moment to an empty house that no longer smelled like apple pie and spiced leather.
When we were here
He walked over to impala and fired her up, pausing only a moment before pulling out of the motel parking lot, driving back the way they had came.
Cas didn’t answer Dean. He just sat there shaking and naked on the bathroom floor. “If you need me I’ll be down stairs.”
“It’s open,” an older female voice called out. Lisa opened the door and walked in followed by Cas and Emmy, who was now silently crying, “my lord child, what happened?” asked the nurse standing up and walking over to them. “Sit her on the bench.”
Mary left her husband standing in the kitchen and followed Bobby's instructions. After she gave Dean the medicine she went to the kitchen to put the soup back on the stove. John had left the room as Mary turned on the stove, so Mary headed upstairs in search of her youngest son. She found Sam asleep in Dean’s bed. The floor had been cleaned and Sam’s hair was still damp from a shower. The room still smelled slightly of vomit, so she went to the storage closet down the hall, grabbed a can of air freshener and sprayed slightly around the room. She walked out leaving the door cracked and went to check on her soup.
“How young you are, Dean Winchester,” Dean would have laughed under different circumstance and tell this prick that he had been through his own roughness, that made him grow up more than he should have, but, right now at this moment, he couldn’t have agreed more with the stranger. “I’m gonna tell you a story but first answer this question. What if Cassie doesn’t want to go with you? What then, will you make him, command him no matter how unhappy it will make him?” Dean laid his head back in his hands but didn’t answer.
“I’m sorry for how I’ve been. I’m sorry for turning my back on you and not standing up to my friends for you. I’ll do better” Dean shifted on the trampoline and climbed on top of Cas, “I’ll be better, if you let me,” Dean kisses Cas on the check, “If you still want me.” Dean kisses Cas on the other check.
Mary spoke first, “You truly are welcomed at the house, Cas. Dean agreed also. If you want, that is.”
He watched as Cas walked past their booth and slid in the one behind Dean, sitting sideways leaning back against the wall. Ellen brought Gracie back out and Jo walked right beside her mother, playing with the babies toes.	They were both smiling, giggling at the baby. “She is just the sweetest thing,” Ellen said handing Benny the baby, who passed her to Dean.
Cas stopped talking and silence hung between the two boys. It only lasted a moment before Cas spoke again, “About a week after you left, Sam told me that you had moved and you were ok, I was so relieved. You were out of his reach. I thought, stupidly, that I could rebel then. He showed me how wrong I was.” Cas pulled up his sleeves enough to see the jagged marks across both wrist, “He tried to make it look like suicide, when I told him I was leaving to find you and he’d never see me again. I woke up in the hospital a week later. I learned my lesson that day.”
But you didn't
“Come on, Sammy,” Dean laughed holding a long brown worm just inches above Sam’s lips. Sam pursed his lips tight and shook his head, not giving Dean any chance to shove the worm in his mouth. Sam knew he would too, given the chance so he refused to give him any. “It's just a little worm. Eat. It. Sammy,” again Sam just shook his head.
“Yes, sweetie, I’m okay now. Your daddy was a big help.” Cas bent over and scooped Emmy up into his arms, “I’m sorry I kept your daddy away for so long,”
Sam and Mary realise how sick Dean is. a secret is outed about John
Cas didn’t waste anytime after that, he slicked his cock up and slowly pushed into Dean trying to be gentle. Dean didn’t want gentle, he wanted to be full of his alpha. As Cas paused to give Dean a moment to adjust Dean pushed his ass against Cas swallowing him. “Fuck,” Cas growled, giving himself a moment to adjust to the warmth and tightness that surrounded him. “Oh my… so tight Dean, so fucking tight.”
A huge thanks to everyone who has comment of kudos this story. I never would have believed that it would get over a hundred comments. Thank you all so much.
“I have a friend who’s a nurse here,” Cas started, stepping closer to Dean, “She told me that you, Sam and your Dad were brought in. I needed to check on y’all.” He looked away from Dean back to the baby, who was crying in the alpha’s arms reaching out for Dean. “How’s John?” he asked looking back at Dean.
He groaned and rubbed his ass down against Dean. Cas wanted Dean to take him, to fill him up completely. It was a fullness that he yearned for, something only Dean could give him. It was magic when his lined up over Dean  grinding down again against, causing  Dean’s dick to slip between the wet cheeks of his ass. He rocked against Dean a few more times before he aimed just right and Dean slipped in. “Oh, fuck,” they both moaned as Dean sunk deeper into Cas’ tight heat.
Dean walked back into the room holding a glass of ice tea and a fork. He sat them down in front of Cas and moved behind his chair. Cas wasn't sure if he imagined the soft “eat” muttered next to his ear or the barest touch of lips on his temple but he did as Dean had said to and he ate.
The pain in his ass was only dulled by the pain in shoulder, “Fuck,” he mumbled as he turned around and headed back to his room to grab a shirt. After pulling on a shirt, he almost limped down the stairs and into the kitchen, where John and Sam were sitting at the table.
Lisa was thrilled to be teaching kindergarten this year and to have Emmy in her class. The first day started off kinda rough. Only a few kids had went to pre-k so it was a new experience for most. The kids were ready when it was finally time for recess and so was Lisa. She watched as they ran around playing. Emmy was just smiling playing on the slides. Lisa was looking around the playground when something, well someone, caught her attention. She wasn’t sure but she thought it was Cas, just watching the children play.
Cas pulled out his phone, dialed the number he had programed for the best pizza place around and ordered two pizzas, one all meat without italian sausage and a pepperoni, bacon, mushroom and onion, and some garlic bites, paying for with the card he had in his wallet.
Dean waved to his family and joined Bobby in the car. The car pulled away from the house and headed toward the interstate. “Slow down,” Dean said to Bobby a few blocks away from Dean’s house. He could see the iron gates. He just wanted one more look, before he left Cas behind him. He sighed as Bobby slowed down enough for Dean to take in the house and the boy sitting under a large oak close to the gates. Dean was to far to see if the bruises had faded any or not.
“Thanks,” Dean said tiredly. “We can watch t.v. or something ‘til Anna gets here.” Dean grabbed the remote of the coffee table and turned on the tv. “There’s bound to be something on this damn thing.” He flipped through the channels until he landed on Dr. Sexy, they were all reruns but it was one of Dean’s quilty pleasures, it used to drive Lisa insane, she would always accuse him of watching it to fantasize about him while they were having sex. He laid the remote down on the couch and stretched out as far as he could.
Considering their father was in surgery from the wreck both Sam and Dean seem to be in relatively good condition. Other that a long gash that ran from Dean hairline to between his eyebrows, that had to be stitched up, and a few cuts and scrapes on his arms, he seemed to be okay. To say Cas was relieved was an understatement.
Cas said nothing for moment, just kept looking at the wooden boards of the porch, “Thank you for allowing me to stay,” he said after a moment bringing his eyes up to look at Dean, “would you like to come in?” Cas wasn't sure why he asked again,standing at the door, an open invitation for anything to happen inside the empty house, but it felt like the right thing to do.
Cas shifted a pillow, and rolled over on his side, facing Dean. “I miss those nights. The nights where we were so carefree. Nothing seemed to be too important in those moments.”
“Okay, baby girl,” Dean moved beside Cas sitting as close as he could, they were touching from the waist down. Emmy sat in Cas’ lap with her feet thrown over Dean’s. Dean may have tossed an arm around Cas’ back and let it rest on his shoulder but hey Cas didn't say anything so Dean wasn't gonna say anything.
Crowley pulled into the driveway and helped Dean inside and up to his room, “Do you need me to get you anything?” he asked as Dean laid back on the bed.
Cas wanted to make things better, to begin to fix things between him and Dean but everytime he tried Dean shut him down. Dean wouldn’t let him near Gracie most of the time. They stayed in Dean’s room most of the time, stayed away from Cas.
Dean stood up from the couch and walked over to the door trying to keep his eyes away from Cas. He took the pizza from the delivery man, pressed play on the movie and made his way back to the couch. He almost dropped the pizzas when he looked up at Cas and saw him running his fingers over the scar, his scar, his claim, his mark. Dean sat the pizzas down on the coffee table, trying to cover his plunder.
“Yep,” Dean closed his eyes and the words just fell out as Cas backed out of the parking spot and left the school grounds. “I bought it for Lisa as a wedding present and now I’m alone in a house that I don’t want, surrounded by memories of a family that I can’t have anymore. I don’t even go upstairs anymore. Ben’s door hasn’t been opened in months. She took everything from me.”
John sat the poles and the box on the ground and closed the trunk. He looked up to see both boys standing on the porch leaning on the old railing that lined the porch, he hoped it was strong enough to hold the weight of them both. He smiled as he saw the boys laugh at something that he was to far away to hear and Sam shove at Dean.
“Gabe?” Dean was shocked to see him here. Emmy’s birthday had done past along with any holidays between January and August. Maybe he just randomly wanted to surprise Emmy.
Cas walked into Dean’s room. Gracie was still sleeping soundly, snuggled in a soft pink blanket. She grumbled when Cas shut the door behind him. Cas walked over to the bassinet, she was starting to whimpering. Cas picked her up gently and held her close.
Inside the house Dean and Cas could be heard everywhere. It wasn’t loud, just powerful. The words vibrated and echoed, well Dean’s words did. “You think I’m mad because of Gracie,” Dean exclaimed, “you stupid son of a bitch! I’m mad because of you, not because of her. I’m mad because you left me alone and confused and you didn't care while I was trying to hold myself together. Everything you did was like you were trying to break me. Every time you would flaunt one of your bitches in my face. I gave you everything, everything,” he exaggerated, balling his hand into fist desperately wanting to punch Cas in the face,  “and you made me feel like a cheap whore.”
“Thank you,” Cas leaned back against the wall of the gym.
“No, your not. You’re gorgeous,” Cas could feel his face heating up as Dean talked. “How are you feeling?” Dean asked as he peppered lighter kisses on his hair.
“Oh, umm, since around five, maybe.” Cas sat the syrup on the table and filled up both glasses with orange juice before placing it on the table as well. “We had fun didn’t we, sweetheart?” Cas looked down at Grace, smiling as she shoved her thumb in her mouth.
“Hey Cas,” Dean whispered, lightly grabbing his hand. “Cas,” he said a little louder,receiving no answer. All the machines were working so clearly Cas wasn’t dead, but why wasn't he waking up?
“Cause I'm not weak, I'm not broken I am bold
“You fixed me a plate?” Cas asked, sounding dumbfounded.
“Alright man, well thanks for staying with the munchkin for so long.”
“Did you really think that you could just walk away,” he asked placing a strong hand on Cas’ shoulder gripping it tight, “It’s not just about you. We were supposed to be your people. We had a place promised to us.”
“Yeah,” Dean said looking up at Cas, “I want you to come.” Cas was looking back at Dean. The room felt charged. It felt like it used to when Dean would look at Cas. Cas loved the way Dean made him feel. “The house seems different without you in it,” Dean admitted in a hushed voiced.
Mary passed out the menus and they were quiet for a few minutes until Ellen came over gushing over how cute Gracie was. She swiftly took the baby out of Dean’s arms planting kisses all her face. She just couldn’t get enough of the little girl. “I’ll bring her back, promise,” Ellen said smiling, walking away toward the kitchen with Gracie.
Dean gently rolls his hips Cas against, forcing Cas to feel his hardness against his own. A lustful moan escapes both men's lips.
Dean sighed before handing Gracie to Cas.
“Man, do I know that. She tried to force me into a suit for this thing.” The conversation with Ash was easy, it always was, even when he was on the other end of the country and Dean needed a friend after Benny died. Ash was really the only friend Dean had.
Cas sat up but ignored Dean’s question asking one of his own instead, “What in the dish?”
When he walked back into the room he wrinkled his nose at the smell. He understood what Cas had been speaking of, but it wasn't just Dean that stank. The entire room did.
Dean avoided the question. “C’mere,” he pulled Cas closer to him and wrapped his arms around the omega, “Can I tell you a secret?”
Mary and Sam set the table, while Dean pulled Grace’s highchair out of the corner of the dining and pushed it up to the table.
Dean was incredibly sore. Bobby had gave Dean some medicine for the pain, some good pain meds for now laced with codeine. Since Dean wasn’t a full omega he couldn't breastfeed Gracie. He didn’t realize until Mary had mentioned that it was time for her to eat that Dean realized that he would have to buy bottles and formal. He had some clothes and all for her but he hadn’t thought of how she was gonna eat.
Dean nodded understanding what Gabe was talking about. He had already taken so much from Cas, to much. He wouldn’t take anymore.
Dean and Sam left the room together, Sam went to his room, while Dean headed downstairs. John was standing at the coffee maker, “Hey Dad,” Dean called as he walked to the fridge. He grabbed the orange juice out and closed the door. He turned and looked at his dad, “I’m sorry, Dad, I know you're upset and disappointed in me but I didn’t think this could happened.”
Dean felt Cas nod again, “I fell in love with you that day. I know you probably couldn’t tell with the way I was with that beta. The ferris wheel, that whole ride all I wanted to do was to kiss you, that scared the shit out of me, but being next to you felt right.”
“The hobbit,” Dean said not questioning if it was up there or not. Dean knew it was his almost unhealthy want to have any movie that he thought he might enjoy.
“Why are you here?” Dean snapped skipping any greeting, just staring at Cas like he was trying to burn holes in him.
“Out of the ashes you buried me in
“Yeah, I got ‘em,” the teacher said as Lisa began to walk toward the fence.
“Yes ma’am,” he mumbled, starting to move off his bed. Mary got up to and walked out of the room. “Mom,” he called as she got to the door, “I didn’t want to lose him. I knew I had to but I wanted to have a piece of him, I guess. Didn’t think he’d drop me just like that though, after you know.”
But you didn't
“Umm… yeah,” Dean mumbled, looking back at the gravestone.
Bobby left the room and headed back down stairs, walking in on a rather heated hushed argument, “Don’t you dare,” Mary said harshly, walking away from the table, “you don’t get to compare me not telling you about Dean to you sleeping with someone else. You broke our vows, weakened the bond, all for what? What did you gain?”
“Yes, ma’am,” Cas was surprised that she had gone that easily on him and he guessed it was because she adored Dean, most people did, and she grew up with Mary.
He moaned when Cas rocked his jean clad crotch down against his own boxer covered erection. He gasped for breath when Cas’ lips moved from his lips to his throat, licking, kissing and gently sucking on his clavicle. He rocked his hips slowly, just barely touching Dean. Dean felt like he was dying.
Cas walked through the dining room and into the living room making up Dean’s mind for him.  Dean followed Cas through the house and into the living room, sitting down on the other end of the couch from Cas.
He was halfway through an episode of Dr. Sexy, M.D. when the doorbell rang. He was almost certain that it was his mom, so he jumped up and went to answer it. He walked in the doorway of the two half walls that separated the living room from the foyer.
“Not sure,” John said rooting around in one of the coolers before pulling a full apple pie wrapped in saran wrap.
"No," Cas said trying to keep his voice from breaking, "I want this. I want you. Please. Dean." Cas relaxes and Dean eases the digit out and back in a few times. Smiling as he hears Cas's moans for more. Pressure turning into pleasure, Cas adjusts to the sensation from the second digit being inserted fairly quickly. He starts rocking against Dean in anticipation. "oh, God" Cas cries out as Dean’s expert finger brush over his sweet spot. Dean slips in a third finger and strokes the spot again causing Cas to moan loudly.
A door squeaked open and a freshman male omega walked over to the sink. Dean looked up at the sound he knew the guy. Sammy. He had dark blonde hair and soft green eyes. He looked so innocent, other than the dark purple marks on his neck, that he unsuccessfully tried to pull his shirt over. He meet Dean’s eyes only for a moment in the mirror before ducking his head and leaving the room.
From the best of days
“Anything you for Sweetie,” Cas said getting up from the couch, putting a hand over his mouth to stifle a yawn.
"Okay, baby" Dean said, removing his fingers and gently rolls Cas over on his back. He slides up against him between his legs, aligning his erection with Cas's entrance. He leans over to kiss
“Ok but shh, the commercial is over.” Dean laid back against the couch and watched the rest of the episode.
“I’ll deal with that,” Michael said walking away from Castiel, who fled back to the safety of his room. He knew that he was meant to act like this big tough alpha but his father scared the hell out of him.
“Well,” Bobby began, “you have a few options. It’s still early, so there's about three diffrent things you can do, keep it, put it up for adoption or abortion.”
Cas didn't elaborate, just pushed himself off the bed and walked to the door, completely naked.
“Why would you want an omega’s mark?” Cas questioned.
In the moments where he could think straight, he felt himself falling for the man he had always hoped his beautiful green eyes alpha would be.
“Really,” she asked. Dean could hear the surprise in her voice. He usually doesn’t share with anyone. She leaned over and placed a hand on Dean’s forehead, jokingly, she said, “Are you a feeling ok. You don’t seem to be running a fever, but you are acting odd.”
Dean  listened as the surgeon explained that they had done everything they could. He told Mary that they had stopped the swelling and bleeding on his brain and the internal bleeding. John’s heart had stopped twice while they were working on him. He was in his own room and under sedation, would be until tomorrow, when the doctors would bring him out and see if he wakes up, hopefully he would.  He told them it would probably be best if they all went home and got some some rest. So they did. Dean told Cas to follow them to the house, that they needed to talk.
Lisa walked back in still on the phone, “Yeah, hold on,” she looked at the nurse.
“Blue,” She giggles, “like Cassie’s eyes.” Dean smiles at her.
He hated the way he felt for Cas, maybe that was why Dean pushed him away so hard. Looking at him like that though, Dean knew that there was no way possible that Dean could not be there for him right now.
Dean shuffled around on the top shelf of a random cabinet. He had found John's stash by complete accident and until now hadn’t got into it. Dean pulled out a bottle of Jack. He went back into the living and sat the bottle on the table between the two.
He pulled off Dean’s throbbing cock and began to suck at his balls, then moving back to his entrance. Cas swept his tongue across the puckered hole. He could feel Dean shiver below him, “You like that, baby boy?” Cas asked starting to suck at the hole, getting him all nice and wet before he slicked a finger in his mouth and gently pushed inside Dean.
So, instead of telling the classmates, that still looked at him like he hung the moon, that he was really just an almost thirty year old burnout, that had a house that was too big for just him, a wife that left him and took one of the best things to ever happen to him and worked at the same dead end job that he did when he was 17, he would deflect the question and bring up a football game or something he knew that they would all love to rehash. That was the only way he could think to talk to these people.
They had both started their senior year about two months ago. So far, other than fucking Amara, Dean’s year had been great. He had lead the football team to victory five out of the six games, including the homecoming game, 45 to 24. It was great. But not as great as the moment that he was named homecoming king and Amara was his queen.  It was amazing and then that night, yeah he wasn’t going into details of that night.
Cas woke up and reached over for Dean, the bed around him was empty and cold. Cas flipped on the light that was beside the bed, he looked around and saw no proof that Dean was even there. He tried to keep calm but felt the tears gathers behind his eyes.
Time has come for letting go
Dean pulled away a sad smile playing on his lips, “You presented,” was all he said. He moved over to his bed and sat down, placing his hands in his lap and looked down at the cream colored carpet, that covered his floor. Cas sat next to Dean wrapping his hand around Dean’s and bringing it to his lips. Dean looked so sad. “I’m gonna lose you,” he tried to keep his voice steady and the water out of his eyes, but at that moment, with a simple smell, he felt like he world was falling apart around him, and maybe it was.
“Hi,” Dean said after a moment. “Mom told me where you moved to,” he added after Cas didn't say anything, “I hope you don't mind.”
“You can sit up front with Daddy,” Emmy said sliding in the middle of the bench seat and buckling up. Cas followed Emmy’s instructions and opened the passenger's side door and slid into the car. He had almost forgot the beauty of the car, but Dean still kept her in perfect condition. He lovingly rubbed his hands over her dashboard before settling into the leather seats. He heard Dean chuckle  beside him, “I missed her,” he mumbled.
Mary walked in a few minutes later holding a small pink baby bottle half filled with formula. Mary sat down beside him on the bed and walked him through how to feed and burp Gracie. Dean was grinning down at his daughter as he was taking care of her. He might not have been awake to give her first bottle her change her first diaper but he’s awake now and he’s gonna do it all.
Cas may have felt his eyes watering, when Dean simply elbowed Gordon in the side and said, “Everyone wants me, dude.” Cas dropped his gaze to his desk and tried not to pay attention as the class erupted in laughter around him.
“Look at what Uncle Sammy got me yesterday,”  Emmy pulled Cas into the living room and held up a blue movie case with different fish on it.
“Sure,” he said grabbing a paper plate and a slice of supreme before heading up to Dean’s room. He lightly knocked on the door and pushed it open when no answer came. Dean was still curled in his blankets. Sam walked inside and stood beside his brother’s bed. “Hey Dean,” he said trying to walk him.
He got dressed and walked out of his room. Gracie’s door was cracked but no sound was coming from the door so he looked inside to see the baby asleep, a pink blanket laid over her. He walked over to Deans door next, it too was partly open. A smile pulled on his lips as he looked in to see Dean spread out, like a starfish, across the bed.
In the heat induced haze, Cas clung on to Dean like he would disappear at any moment.
Cas wasn't in the room anymore, but on the bed lay a pair of boxers and black sweats. Dean slipped on the clothes that Cas had laid out and walked down stairs.
Dean wasted no time sliding back to meet Benny as Benny wrapped his arms around Dean. The trembles stopped soon and Dean drifted off into a peaceful sleep. Something about Benny being there with Dean made everything feel ok again. Dean embraced that. The alpha helped sooth the omega.
“Yes, Sir,” Dean replied hugging his father, “Goodbye, Alpha,”
“‘Drea,” he called, trying to get the group’s attention off Dean. He smiled his almost happy smiled as she turned and walked toward him. He knew what the guys expected from him and what would be reported back to Michael. Cas and ‘Drea had talked about this, he would feel on her some she would look uncomfortable and eventually someone would complain to Ellen about and Jo would kick him out. Win win.
“Maybe,” Dean said smiling around a bite of pie.
Cas’ mother was an alpha. A mean, vicious woman that died when Cas was 10.
Dean is usually a very quiet person, but the man on stage must have the hearing of a bat. He turned toward where Dean was standing, pulled a hand up to shield his eyes from the spotlight and called out, “Is someone there?”
“You just don't learn do you, boy,” he sneered at Uriel, “I am stronger than you,” another fist hit Uriel’s face, “more powerful than you,” anther hit, “just all around better than you,” anther fist. Uriel was bleeding, pretty badly, “Think about what your actions just cost your family, I will go back to Micheal just to make sure something bad happens,” this was said low, close to Uriel’s face, “maybe Michael will even let me decide what happens.”
***Disclaimer: I do not own Dean or Cas or anyone else but Emmy, yeah she's mine.***
“Oh your awake baby,” she said rushing to him, still holding Gracey close to her. “She’s perfect,” she handed the baby, who instantly pulled her close to him.
“Yes, is this Mr. Dean Winchester?” a female voice on the other end asked.
Dean crawled over Cas and started kissing at his neck the worked his way down to the newly naked chest. He knew every spot to lick and suck at on his way down to the waist of Cas’s dark blue jeans, that sat perfectly on his slender hips. God, he was perfect. Dean slowly made his way down, kissing just inside the V that lined his hips, on both sides. He slowly popped the button and carefully pulled down the zipper, before slipping Cas’s snug pants down his hips and off his legs. He kissed his way back up Cas’s legs and swiftly pulled off his boxers.
“I release you,” Dean whispered in his ear, lips gently touching the shell of his ear. “My sweet Omega, I release all claim I have over you as your alpha.”
“And i've always been yours.” Cas pulled out of Dean's grip and led him into the living room.
“Cas,” Dean said his voice shifting into a lustful low growl, “Cas,” Dean took a deep breath, “mmm. Why do you smell like a bitch in heat?”
Thank you all for still being here and not giving up. it might take time but I will finish this.
"Yes, Dean. It's ok" Cas whispered.
Nothing was really said as they watched her sleep for a few minutes but Dean felt himself leaning into Cas’ side before he could really stop himself. Dean almost sighed as Cas wrapped his arms around him.
Just wanna thank everyone for the kudos and comments.
Both of the boys groaned, but said nothing. Since that night they have figured out a pattern. Cas never went to dinner on Tuesdays and Dean stays out most of Fridays, including dinner. It was two days that they didn’t have to spend that hour together.
Lisa got up and followed him over, “It’s hard to believe she is already five. You’ve done a really good job. I’m proud of you.” She kissed his cheek again and walked back inside to get Ben.
“It gonna be at least a day before I can get and that's the very best I can do. I need more time to finish up what I’m doing. He has everything he needs in a box in his room. Can you please help him without abusing him this time?”
“Mind Bobby, Dean. Call often, and by often,” John said, “I mean, everyday.”
“Well guys,” Becky started in a much too happy voice for what she was about to lead up to, “First, I would like to thank everyone that was able to make it tonight. It's been a long ten years and it's been so amazing to talk with old friends again. Unfortunately for some of those not here with us tonight, it was not by their choice,we have had six classmates leave us too soon: Scott Carey, Sophie Carlton, Marshall Hall, Benjamin Lafitte, Tessa Murphy and Ron Reznick.”
Cas walked the distance to Ellen’s diner. He thought alot on the way there, mostly about how he was broke and hungry and headed to the best diner in the state, while broke and hungry. What was wrong with him.
The sounds of young men filled the inclosed area, causing Castiel to whimper again. What if Dean pulled some of his alpha buddies in here next. Tears began to slip down his face again. “Shhh,” Dean whispered, “just be quite.” Castiel heard the order loud in clear even in the hushed tones. He nodded causing a new wave of pain explode from his neck. He covered his mouth with his head to keep from screaming in pain.
So a little super short chapter. It just came to me and I was working it out in my head then I said f it and grabbed my phone. So show it some love maybe.
“He’s doing good, Dean,” Gabe said answering the question Dean really wanted to ask. “And as for me,” Dean could almost hear him grinning, “I’m good too. You know how it is living up the single life. Women, booze and candy.”
Dean nodded and looked down to where Gracie had wrapped her hand around Cas’ finger. Nothing was said until a surgeon walked by and into the room. They both followed him into the room and waited to see what would be said about John.
“Yeah, Cas,” Dean said removing the tinfoil completely and handing Cas a fork. “You didn’t answer my question, do they pick on you often?”
“Wait,” Dean said, “in-intended to be?” he felt like he was gonna be sick. Cas had chosen someone already to mate, someone to claim. Someone that wasn’t Dean.
A low feral growl echoed in the room, causing Dean and Benny to turn to Cas. His eyes were glowing, a dangerous shade of red. He was fuming at the site in front of him. How dare this Alpha think he can be next to his family. Dean and the baby are his. Dean has his claim and Grace has his blood. They are his.
"Thank you, sir," Cas said as he opened the passenger door and slid into the seat.
Dean’s focus was purely on fucking Castiel into the wall. A few thrust later, his knot had swollen and caught, locked deep inside Castiel. Dean moaned into the omega’s neck and sunk his teeth into the perfect unmarked skin. He applied pressure until a coppery taste hit him tongue. He pulled back and ran his tongue over the fresh mark, cleaning it, almost lovingly.
I, I am golden
“I’ll help,”Dean said as Cas moved his lips from his ear to down his neck, sucking gently at his pulse point, “but you have to do as I say and we will not have sex. I can’t do that to you again.” Dean gently grasped Cas’ face, making him look into Dean’s eyes, “Can you do that, baby?” Dean leaned down and kissed Cas frimley, “Can you listen to me, Omega?”
"Names Bobby," The man said with a gruff voice.
I, I am golden”
“Yes,” Cas answered looking down at the space between them on the couch. He took another sip and passed the bottle to Dean.
Cas stopped he knew that voice, it haunted his dreams. God, he wanted to turn around. He needed to turn around. He had watched them every time Gabe came to see them. Dean was doing good and Emmy was getting so big and beautiful. He knew that if he turned around he would run back to Dean. To them. He wasn’t ready for that. Not yet. So he lowered his head, looking at his feet, and walked away.
“Sorry. It's just all so complicated. So much more than I even realised to begin with. It... god mama, what did I do?” Dean slid the collar of his shirt off his shoulder enough to show the scar.
“I’m gonna go put this in and I’ll be back soon,” Andrea walked off, smiling, to put in their order.
“Thanks,”Dean said walking away from the desk, toward the elevator.
Lisa started to repeat that to Dean but stopped short and handed the phone to Cas, smiling sweetly. “Umm hello,” he said unsurly into to phone.
“Alright,” she said typing something in, “He’s in room 209 in labor and delivery, on the second floor.”
“Come on,” Cas said standing up and motioning for Dean to follow him down the hall. He opened the door that he had been looking into when Dean had rung the doorbell. He walked in and Dean followed.
He reemerged from the room as Dean turned to enter it causing Cas to run face first into Dean's chest, “Sorry,” he whispered, as Dean wrapped both arms around him to steady. Cas couldn’t move. He couldn’t breath, the smell of Dean completely overwhelming him. Before he even realized he was moving, he leaned into Dean’s embrace, letting the Alpha hold him for a moment.
At fourteen weeks Dean got to see his baby, his sweet little angel. He could see her tapping her foot like she had her own music playing. She was all his. His sweet little Grace. Cas had always said that he loved the grace of everything around him, that it made him feel like more than he was. So maybe when he sees Grace, when he meets, well maybe if he meets her, he would feel worth everything to them.
"I'm sorry mama," He sighed into the glass of tea she had just placed in front of him, "thank you." He looked at the sandwich she sat down. Silence filled the room as Cas ate.
There is shifting in the sand
Cas knew that he handled everything wrong. He would give anything to change what was done, how he acted.
Cas smiled as he felt Dean’s arms tighten around his waist. He leaned back against Dean, who was spooned up right behind him. A soft press of lips landed in his hair, “I love you, Cas,” was barely whispered in the in the same place. Cas said nothing just sighed slightly. Then he remember, “I bit you,” he whimpered, “Oh my god, I bit you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Be careful, Dean,” Sam said as Dean reached the door.
Guess what, Yes I can”
They both saw dean at the same time. Cas blushed just enough to pink his cheeks and grace started reaching for dean. “You let me sleep, again,” Dean spoke softly, while he walked across the small room, over to  Cas and their baby.
Like a fire-breathing dragon, but I guess I took your crown
“I know no one here would ever ask me to leave but I also know that you don't want me here or around Gracie. I get that, I do but I would prefer to not be reminded of it every minute of the day.” Cas stopped talking and looked at Dean.
Cas answered first, “We are seventeen, Mom. We know no parties, no drugs, no booze and no girls.”
The man sang like he was singing for an audience instead of a empty room. Every word seemed to burn into Dean's chest and just sit there. There was a story behind this man.
“No,” Dean said barely above a whisper.
“I got this, Daddy” She said stubbornly, kicking her feet again.
"Cas pushed himself into a sitting position against the wall, he wrapped an arm around his stomach and tried to breath. It was hard, his breaths were shallow and painful. He laid his head back against the bathroom wall. He could feel the warm blood trickling down his face. He was light headed and the white walls seemed to be spinning, “Tisk, tisk, tisk,” Cas looked up and tried to focus on the blurry figure in front of him, “Daddy’s gonna be upset with you, aint he?” Cas knew the voice and scent, it was family, but he couldn’t think of who. “Come on, I’ll help you get home.”
Above him Cas was whimpering, “please, stop,” it was becoming a chant. But Dean wasn’t listening to the omega, he was focused on ripping Castiel blue jeans down. He popped the button off and completely fucked up the zipper. Once Castiel’s pants and boxers were around his ankles, Dean wanted a taste of the sweetness that was driving him mad. He licked a broad stripe over Castiel’s hole. Moaning, he stood back up and started yanking down his own pants and boxers. His member sprang free, rock hard and leaking.
This caught Dean’s attention and he raised his head looking at the shaggy headed alpha that previously had a magazine over his face, “What's it to you?” he snapped harshly. He didn’t like this alpha. He wasn’t sure why, but he figured it had something to do with the fact that the other alpha smelled a lot like Cas. His Cas. How dare this alpha think he could touch his omega. Well that was possessive and uncalled for, the more rational side of Dean’s brain commented.  “You’re the alpha that brought Cas in, aren’t you?”
Lunch was here and Dean was excited and nervous. He knew Cas loved kids but naturally it wasn’t something that they had ever talked about. He wasn’t sure how Cas was going to take the news. They were gonna be parents and Dean really didn’t want to do this alone.
The sat beside each other eating their food and letting the movie play. Dean looked down and saw Gracie asleep on the elephant. He tapped Cas on the arm directing his attention to their daughter asleep on the floor.
Cas was terrified. He had never been more scared in his life. This is why it was so important for him to hide what he was. As archaic as it sounds, the South is still a little farther behind on how omegas should be treated, especially male omegas. They were property, sold and bargained off to any alpha that wanted him, or raped and beaten, left to die alone at the bottom of a ditch, without a single person to do anything to stop it. He had read the horror stories that popped up throughout the South. He was gonna be one, now. He just knew it.
“Nope, on the ground”
“A couple of hours.” Cas said moving all the toys but the stuff elephant, “I started the hobbit from the beginning and were to the point where bilbo finds the ring, so we had been reading for a while.”
Emmy ripped all the pink paper off the brown box, “Daddy, open it! open it!” She thrusted to box at him. Cas had taped the lid down.
“Truth,” Cas said before drinking from the bottle.
Cas stood on the front porch of the Winchester house, waiting for Dean. He was still smiling but the coldness around him was causing his teeth to chatter. He looked around watching it snow for a moment before Dean opened the door, only wearing his plaid boxers. Cas took in the perfection that was in front of him, before, without saying a word, grabbed Dean’s hand and dragged him upstairs to his bedroom.
That never die”
“It’ll be here in a thirty minutes.” Cas said after he hung up his phone. They sat in silence for a moment, well they sat in mostly silence Gracie laid in the floor mostly chewing on the elephant  and babbling.
Castiel all but ran to the safety of room, he closed the solid oak door and slid down it to the floor. He hated this family, his family. He hated his father, mother and brothers. He only wanted Dean, but he couldn’t. He pushed the thoughts from his head and rose from the floor. He slipped out of his clothes and went into his bathroom, turning on the water in the large garden tub and letting it fill, before he slipped in the very warm water.
Dean and Cas walked out the door, and Dean slipped a bug repellent bracelet on both of Cas’s wrist and then his own on. He led Cas over to the trampoline. He had spent a good hour arranging the pillows and blankets on the black mat. “Climb on,” Dean said smiling at his brother.
Watch me take on my bright future
“I would have been there for you.” He lightly squeezed the omega’s hand, “We could have done this together. I’m sorry, so sorry.” Dean leaned over and place a soft kiss on the back of his hand. Sighing, he relaxed back in the chair. he thought about letting go of Cas’s hand but decided, perhaps unwisely, not to. he soon dozed back off, allowing the sweet smell of fresh apple pie surround him.
Cas didn't say anything to his father's words. Michael had been a ghost when Cas was little and only seemed to care at all about him after he presented. To hear his father talk about how much he loved his oldest son hurt, alot.
Dean smiled at his stepmother, “why don’t you take the rest of to work with you.”
“That song is the first single from my new album. You are the first person that usually doesn't hear my music early to hear it. I had thought about singing it tonight for everyone, but you and Benny were the ones it was really written for. Becky asked if I would sing tonight, and I'm going to, when she does the remembrance ceremony, but it’s not gonna be that song.” Cas was playing with the knee of his pants, dark simple blue jeans.
It was about noon when John pulled the impala up to the cabin. Not a lot was said on the ride out but then again it wasn't always easy for john to communicate with his boys. Sammy sat in the back seat, legs stretched out across the seat , nose buried so far in a mythology book that he got from bobby that he probably didn't even know the car was moving. Dean sat in front looking out the window, humming along to whatever rock song played out of baby’s speakers. It had been a long time since John had seen his so quiet and look so peaceful at the same time. He figured that Dean was probably thinking about Gracie that's usually what he thinking about when he gets that look on his face.
Gabe had given Dean his number, and vise versa, before Dean and Emmy had left the hospital. Gabe had told him that he wanted to know how his niece was doing and to give Cas time. That maybe later, Cas would come back. Those words had kept Dean sane and Emmy had kept him far away from the bottle, determined to be a better father than John ever was.
Emmy was quiet until they reached the movies and Dean picked up Minions. She knew that Cassie was special Daddy never looked at people the way he looked at Cassie and Cassie smelled like Daddy, he smelled like home. Cassie is family. she wasn’t sure how he was family but she knew that she never wanted to be without him again. “Daddy,” Emmy said getting Dean’s attention.
“A parent, I think,” Lisa said looking back at the fence, “I’ll be right back, keep an eye on my kids please,” she asked the teacher.
My friend, I'm gold
“You can,” Cas said kissing down Dean’s jaw and to his ear, pulling his earlobe gently in his mouth,  “you really can, Alpha,” Cas was breathing hard in Dean’s ear, “come on, baby, I know you messed up before but this isn’t that, this isn’t messing up. I love you, Dean, I’ve always loved you. I was always yours, even before the claim, I was always yours” Cas was rocking his hips up down, trying to get some friction. He felt like he was slowly losing his mind and if he didn’t get some relief soon he was gonna die. “It’s not like that this time,” he added, just wanting Dean to fuck him.
Cas had been at the house for a week, one tense, awkward week. Sam was the only one who seemed to enjoy Cas being there. With Sam it was much like old times, Sam and Cas would sit on the couch playing video games and talking about their studies for hours.
Cas couldn't stifle the moan that left his parted lips if he tried, as Dean's firm erection pressed against his bare backside.
“Is what true?”
“I know,” Castiel whimpered, holding his face, before turning away and walking home. With each block he passed, the houses got larger and farer apart, until he stopped at large iron gates with a D on both sides. Beside the gate was a little black box that contained a keypad used to open the gates. 3426456 was typed into the pad followed by 104756. The medal gates opened and he walked up the long driveway to the large red brick mansion.
What the fuck is that sound, is the first thing that run through Dean’s mind, as the annoying sound continued to violate his ears. He blindly reached over to his bedside table and patted on his alarm clock, pressing the snooze button. The sound continued. So he reached for his phone, trying not to knock it off the table. He picked it and stared at the screen. He didn’t recognize the number, so he silenced it and laid it back down. A moment later the phone peeps showing he has a missed call and a new voice mail. He groaned if it was important enough to leave a message he should probably check it. He was about to listen to the voicemail when the phone began to ring again. It’s the same number. This time Dean did answer the phone, “‘ello,” he grumbled.
Dean looked down at his hands, “I’ve always loved him, from the first day I saw him. I thought I was having some big gay freak out, but everything about him made me want to be with him. But in south Georgia, two male alphas doesn’t happen. The day I found out what he was,  I was thrilled. We could be together. He tried to make me leave, but all I could think of was if I left him someone would hurt him. I couldn’t let anyone hurt him. It never occurred to me that I was the one hurting him. The pain and guilt of what I did haunts me, everyday. I dropped out after he left because I couldn’t handle the school. It didn’t matter that I was a few weeks from graduation. He was gone, school no longer seemed important. He wasn’t there. I looked for him but I was almost relieved when I couldn’t find him. I knew I could never make up for what I did. I.. after what I did… so I did what I do best, I ignored it. I drowned myself in alcohol and work. I kept my distance from everyone, shut out my family and friends. He was gone, so nothing else mattered.” He was crying at the end of his rant.
He held his thumb over the name for a moment wondering if he really wanted to know what it said. So much had changed in the past few hours. He didn’t know what Dean would say now. He finally let his thumb hit the screen and read the simple words on the screen that made his day a million times better. ‘We’ll talk promise.’ only three words on a screen held so much promise for him. A promise of a future, maybe. He smiled at the phone and thought for a while about what to say back to him, after a few minutes of a debate he lamely settles on ‘thank you’ and hit sends.
Cas was sitting in the living room, when Dean walked over to the front door, he slipped on his boots and grabbed the impalas keys off the hook by the door. He looked over the counter to where Mary was starting to prep for dinner, “Me and Sammy’s gonna go get dad. He just called and said he was almost ready to leave. Know you're busy with dinner but Gracie is upstairs asleep didn't want to wake her up.”
“Yeah,” said the other teacher, “get her to the nurse.”
The bell rung and Dean pushed himself out of his desk and headed toward the door. He would talked Cas before lunch. He wasn’t exactly sure what he was gonna say but he had time to figure that out. He was quiet for the rest of the morning, but he was still all smiles. He had a few small talks with a few friends but nothing major.
Sam interrupted whatever she was gonna say next, “But Cas is family,” Sam was almost yelling. He seemed very upset by this. His glare turned to Dean. “You miss him, you idiot. I see it constantly. Why can’t you just admit it.”
“If it’s not my two best girls,” John said, meeting Mary before she made it to the kitchen, “I’ll hold her while you fix her bottle.”
“Hi,” the Doctor said, “I’m Doctor Brooks Hately,” he extended his hand in greeting toward Dean, then Cas, “She broke her arm right about here,” he motioned to spot on his arm indicating where, “we’re gonna put a cast on her and send y’all home with some pain medicine for her. She can miss school tomorrow, see how the pain medicine affects her. If the medicine makes her to tired or out of it to function call her regular doctor and see what they say.” He walks over to the bed and gently wakes Emmy up, “Hey sweetie, what color do you want your cast?” he asks when Emmy finally opens her eyes.
Dean returned to his room upstairs and if he cried himself back to sleep that night well no one had to know right.
Cas wasn’t sure how long he sat on the porch looking at the paper, or when the spot beside him became occupied. He jumped when he heard Dean's voice from beside him, “You’ve been out here for while.”
Naomi pulled over the desk chair in front of the bed and sat down, “I’ve gotta be at work in a few hours until about 6 in the morning. Are yall gonna be okay here by yourselfs?”
“‘M’one boy,” Bobby called again.
He didn't understand why this was happening to him again, it had been years since his suppressants had failed, since that day. He had been on them for years. They were the best on the market. They weren't supposed to fail. He felt his body temp rise as his boxer briefs became damp. He felt the need grow as he heard a low growl outside the door.
Hey Folks! another chapter in yay!!! so I hope y'all enjoy it.
“Something Michael set up, I don’t know the whole story.” She looked down to see the color drain from Dean’s face. “You didn’t know,” she stated looking back over at the alpha, who was looking at them now. She had a lot of looks on Cas’s face recently but not that one. She had seen it before when he would look over the table at Dean before he became an alpha, but to see that look from across a room. To see the longing on a teenage face like that hurt her. “I’ll tell him to leave,” she said about to turn to walk over there.
She's said the same lines a million times. She knew how right they were but that didn't stop her from crying her whole way home.
“Yes, sir,” Dean said in an almost automatic response.
“Yeah, I was thinking about it,” Dean moved before Cas could grasp the movement, muscular arms wrapped around Cas waist and pulled him close to Dean’s chest. Cas embraced the hug and buried his face right where he wanted to, in the crook of Dean’s neck, scenting him. He still smelled so sweet, so amazing. “Good night, Cas,” Dean whispered. Dean let go and Cas followed, dropping his arms back to his side.
They were all seated around the table, John had said the blessing and Mary was passing dishes around. It was quite and a touch awkward. Dean wasn’t sure what was the matter.
The nurse began typing on the keyboard, “What’s your name, sir?”
Dean pulls Cas's bottom lip between his teeth and bites gently on it.
The day went much like homeroom. First and second period was a sweet release. No Castiel.  Cas was in his third period and lunch but Dean was free of him during fourth. He had never been happier to leave school than he was that day.
So so sorry for how this chapter ended. I took every comment into consideration when trying to decide on what to do here and I want to thank everyone so much for telling me what you think. I hope y'all like this chapter and know that your words didn't not fall on deaf ears. no comments ever do. I love every comment and kudos I get, they make my day about a million times better. so thank you all!!!
“What?” Cas asked looking up from his phone.
"Cas is gone. He left with Dean this morning. I don't think he'll be back this time, baby. That boy is just gonna hurt him. It's only a matter of time before he hurts Cas and leaves him alone. He didn't take his phone. We have no way to find him." She said with tears rolling down her cheeks.
Dean looked down at his stomach. He’d never been one big on self image but the baby had done a number to his body. He had lost a large amount of weight and still looked unusually thin, “I’ll have the loaded bacon cheese with extra fries.” He flashed the omega his best smile and handed her the menu before looking back at Sam. He was trying not to pay Cas any attention but it was hard when every few minutes the alpha’s laughter echoed through the space.
Sam slowly woke up and jumped when he saw Dean standing there. A small smile graced his lips, “Feeling better?” Sam asked as he sat up.
“I’m sorry, baby girl,” John said weakly, his voice raw and crackly from underuse. “How are the boys?” he looked over at Dean and Sam. They looked ok and he was hopeful that they were.
Sam sat beside her, his face just a little swollen. His blue chair reclined out, eyes closed, face turned up toward the ceiling. Maybe he was asleep. Other than some ugly bruising in his face and his left wrist was wrapped in an ace bandage.
“Yea, well I claimed him.” Dean said hurriedly, “It a long story,” he added, seeing his brother was about to bombard him with questions. “I’ll tell you all of it, well most of it, later. The reason I brought it up is because he was pregnant and had the baby. He’s in Maine and I have to go up there. I am, by the claim, his alpha there’s a lot that the doctors can’t do without me being there. I need you to be good, stay out of trouble and take care of mom.”
Cas could hear Mary chuckling in the kitchen. Cas smiled at the scene around him. He was so wrapped up in it all that he barely heard Dean call his name, “Cas, “ Dean was looking at him impatiently, “can you help Mom with Grace, if she wakes up?”
here was a knock on his bedroom door, waking Dean from his slumber. “Dad brought pizza,” he heard Sammy say from the other side of the door. Dean didn’t want to move. He was warm, blankets wrapped tight around him, but he knew if he didn’t his dad would be up here. Dean reached over to find Cas, only to be greeted with an empty, cold bed. Of course Cas was gone. Why would he stay? He was now a fully fledge Alpha. Dean sighed and climbed off the bed. Wincing as he moved, fuck he was sore. He slowly pulled on a pair of old sweats and made his way, painfully, downstairs.
“Good point, Dad,” Sam said flopping down a few feet from the banks of the water. Dean followed, farther down and John settled somewhere in the middle. Soon they each had a line in water and were just waiting for a bite.
Dean looked unsure but followed Cas inside as he turned to lead them into the living room. “It's nice,” Dean said sitting down on the suede brown couch.
The stories we will write
"Don't… stop" Cas gasps through the pain. His hands gripping tight to the sheet as Dean pushes his shaft the rest of the way in, stopping when he is fully sheathed.
“I know.” she pulls away from Cas and told them all bye.
“Dean, it's like two in the morning. Why are we going outside?” Cas protested, but followed his brother to the door.
Cas handed her over when Dean stopped beside him, and flipped the pancake one more time to make sure it was done, before piling it on the plate already filled with a stack of pancakes. “Well,” cas began, “you said it yourself that you haven't been sleeping well.” He pulled two plates out of the cabinet along with two cups and two forks, and laid the out on the table, one in front of where Dean was sitting and the other across from him, “She woke up a few hours ago. I gave her a bottle and we started playing and before I knew it the sun was up and my stomach was growling.” He was moving back to the stove as he talked to grab the plate of pancakes. He set the plate on the table between them and walked to the fridge to get the syrup. “We have tea and orange juice, pick one.”
There are a lot of things that bothered her about Dean. He was impulsive and rowdy. She has seen him drunk off his ass hanging on to a different woman each time walking out of the Roadhouse. Then there's the age difference, Dean’s 25. Oh and let's not forget the strange hold he seemed to have Cas. Before Cas met Dean he was a good boy. He had good grades. He listened to his parents. He never snuck out. He was almost perfect. When he meet Dean a few months ago everything changed and fast. She could see Dean getting closer and closer to her baby boy and it scared her. He was trouble and she knew it was only a matter of time before Cas got into deep. Watching Cas leave with him, she was pretty sure that now he was in that deep.
“Come on, Cassie, don’t push me away,” Cas had to bit back a moan, as Dean’s hands began to wonder. His fingers carefully tracing Cas’s side.
“Some,” Dean replied, “Thank you.” he sat down beside at the end of the table with Mary on one side and John on the other.
“You tried so hard to break me down
You thought I was coal
“Calling your mother,” Crowley said finding the right number and pressing send. He waited for the Mary to answer the phone, placing a friendly hand on Dean’s knee, trying to comfort his friend.
“He was,” Mary said feeding Gracie a spoonful of mashed sweet potatoes, “He came into the kitchen before he left.” She turned to look at Dean; it was not a very nice look. “I told you to be nice to him.”
Dean slid off the little bit of bed that he was laying on, laid the book on Emmy’s dresser, turned the light off and left the door open. He would wake Cas up when Sam got here. Walking to the living room, he pulled out his phone and called Sam. He explained about Emmy falling and how Cas had been around all day. How he had seen Gabe this morning and that Gabe said they had moved back and finally how Cas was asleep in Emmys bed right now.
“We could eat and then get high,” Cas suggested. “It's been awhile since we’ve done that together.
“I’m glad that you want to see her. I want you to see her, she needs you.” Dean said smiling at Cas, “she talks about sometimes about the man at the door and how she wants you to come to tea.” he didn’t realize that he still had Cas’s face in his hands. It felt so natural, holding Cas. Dean sighed and dropped his hands back to his, “Sorry,” he mumbled, standing up and moving out of Cas’s space.
Dean smiled slightly before walking out of the room without acknowledging that he hadn’t  been able to sleep more that three or four hours a night since Cas left. “You could have woke me when she woke up, I didn’t mean to fall asleep like that.”
“Benny,” Dean said smiling ear to ear, “I knew it.”
God, it felt good being in the warm hallway again. This hallway was more crowded people hiding out from the cold as they got off the buses. Dean walked over to his locker, fiddled with the lock until it opened and shoved his bag inside.
“First, let’s take this off,” Dean said pulling Cas’ shirt up over his head. He tossed it on the floor and sat on his knees over Cas’ lean body. He hadn’t seen Cas like this before and, boy, was he drinking in the beautiful sight below him. Cas was beautiful, absolutely beautiful. He leaned down and stole a kiss.
“What,” Cas said his brain seeming to finally understand that he had still not greeted Dean, “no, no, of course not, come on in, please.”
“Cas was sick,” she gasped, pushing out of Dean’s arms and running over to Cas, who was standing, awkwardly, by the door. “Are you okay?”
“After I graduated, I came back home. I was here maybe a week when Luke showed up, holding a baby. They were both so unbelievably tiny but Luke said the baby was healthy, that he made sure that Gabe was good.”
“Umm, yeah, Dean,” Sam paused looking at Dean, “I usually don't go around scenting omega’s they tend to find it offencive and kinda creepy, maybe you should work on that.”
“We got to get going boy,” Bobby called from the car.
Cas slid over closer to Dean; Dean was warm pressed beside him. It was a nice, soothing warmness that lulled him into a sleepiness that was escaping him, while he was inside, laying on his bed.
Cas could tell that Dean was smiling. He didn’t smile often and Cas just wished that he could have been sober and that he thought through falling into his bed. “I’m not that drunk,” Dean ran his fingers up Cas’ side and laid them against his cheek. “I know what I’m doing. I only have a few beers with Ash, then walked home. I needed courage. I always need help to be honest with you.”
The nurse nodded. she knew Dean, had for a long time. She remembers the day that Mary, God rest her soul, called her and told her to come meet her new granddaughter. They walked back into the room to see Emmy still clinging to Cas, who was softly humming a tune.  Lisa smiled and took a quick picture. “Alright,” the nurse began rolling her stool in front of Cas, “let’s see your arm, Dear.” She lightly held Emmy’s right arm to examine it, “It looks broken, Lisa can you call Dean, while I call for an ambulance and clean up the cut.” Mosley rolled over to her desk and grabbed her phone to call for an ambulance.
Cas pushed those thoughts away and tried to listen to Lisa talking to Dean on her phone out in the hallway. He couldn’t hear all of it and it was sorta muffled but he did hear a few words. It sounded like she was just telling Dean about what happened.
“Yes, she is,” he opened the passenger side door, lowered Dean on the black leather seat and  closed the door behind him, before walking over the driver's side and climbing in.
Cas brought Emmy over to the car and helped her climb in the back seat. Dean leaned back and called to Cas through the open door, “you need a ride?” Cas just nodded.
“I’m in Georgia, so it’ll take about a day to get there. I’ll be there as soon as I can. I’ll have my phone, please, if anything happens call me.”
Cas smiled and Dean couldn't look away from the man beside him. Cas really had grown far  more beautiful than he was in high school. He had grown up, grown into his body and he carried himself with confidence as he stood and walked out of the drama room.
“Wow,” he whispered, “Its beautiful.”
Here is chapter 16 enjoy! let me know what you think. it might help get the next chapter out sooner. It'll be more Cas' experience than Dean's. This one is his.
As Dean stood there scenting the newly outed omega, Cas broke, “Please, Dean, stop,” He managed to  weakly out. He managed to place his hands on Dean’s chest and pushed at him. He tried to bring back the Alpha voice that he had been using but he sounded pathetic, causing Dean to chuckle.
Emmy reappeared with shoes on and holding a light coat. She looked said. “I need help,” she huffed holding up the jacked in her not broken arm.
I, I am golden, golden, golden”
A small smile slipped onto Dean’s lips, “Sure, Cas,” he said before turning off the car, opening the door and stepping out. He rushed to the passenger side and held out a hand to help Cas out of the car.
“Sure thing,” Dean said, pushing up from the bed, grabbing the dish and following Naomi out the door, leaving Cas sitting in the bed.
We say goodbye
Dean felt like they could see all of his insecurities and imperfections. Cas made Dean nervous. He had never dealt with anything like this. He had plenty of partners but none that ever made him feel like he wanted to do better, to be better. Dean leaned down and closed the distance between their lips. Cas moaned into the kiss as Dean licked his tongue across Cas's lip being for him to open then. Cas slipped his hand up Dean's shirt, amazed by the feel of skin on skin. Cas broke the kiss long enough to sit and pulled Dean up with him.
“Make sure he eats when he comes home,” Dean said to Mary.
“If this happens tonight, you can't freak out on me tomorrow,” Cas whispered, hoping he wasn't about to spoil whatever was happening.
Yeah, Dean thought, because last time he had been about two seconds from pushing Cas back on his bed and doing everything he had thought about since he was thirteen. “Can’t,” Dean sighed, “Coach does random drug tests and if I fell I’m off the team.” He saw Cas’ face fall a little, “but I do know where Dad keeps his good liquor.”
“Thanks,” Cas chuckled softly watching Dean for a few more seconds before returning to his food.
Dean stood with the plate and walked into the kitchen. Cas followed behind him. Dean sat the plate down and walked into the kitchen. Cas sat in the chair in front of the plate.
He decides to check the two messages from ‘Drea the first was asking if he wanted to hang out tomorrow and the next she says nevermind Ellen called her in so maybe later. He sent her a smiley emoji and said later. He leans over to the dark mahogany wood bedside table where his phone charger plugged up. After slipping the plug in, he took the towel off,  laid down and pulled the dark green blanket up around him. He ran his hands through his hair, feeling that it was still a little damp.  He still dropped his head on to the pillow, still smiling about today, thinking about his baby girl, his sweet Grace. They would be a family, no matter what Cas had to do to make it happen.
“Kinda like you didn’t as for that.” Dean pointed to the scar on neck. “Don't apologize for this. It's no more than I deserve. This isn’t even close to what I did to you. I will gladly bear your mark and I will wear it proudly because this,” he gently touched the mark on his neck, “I’ve wanted this for years.”
“I could drive you home,” Cas offered voice low and soft almost like he was talking to a wounded animal.
Dean was still in the hospital bed down in Bobby’s medical room, “Alright, baby, I’m gonna go fix a bottle and I’ll be back in a minute,” Mary said walking out of the room.
Cas stood, pulled his pants up and did his best to secure them in place. He didn’t look back at Dean once, as he opened the stall and walked, painfully, into the locker room. He glanced over to the wall where Dean took everything. He couldn’t cry anymore and his eyes were bloodshot and swollen. He walked out of the empty locker room and gym, thankful that today had been a track day.
“He’s really sick, Momma,” Sam said leaning against the counter. “He managed about four bites before throwing up on me and  the carpet, mostly the carpet. He’s in my room now, with the pot, and I’m gonna clean up his carpet in a minute but I’m worried about him.”
“I don’t know.” Sam answered walking to his room, across the hall from Dean and Cas’ room.
He had been looking at the building for an hour, just looking at it, debating on if he should go in or not. He needed to check on his mate, and everything in him still claimed Dean as his, no matter what deal Michael might have worked out with ‘Drea’s old man. Dean was always his. He took the first step toward the doors and stopped as the automatically slid opened. Dean wouldn’t want to see him. Dean’s family hadn’t spoke to him since John punched him before Dean left months ago.
“ I can move her to her crib if you want,” Cas said a small sort of longing in his voice.
“Go to your room,” Dean said trying to ignore the omega's scent. He has had dreams about this scent. It haunted him and now it's wrapped around him and he had to keep his shit together.
“Course it does,” Cas said stepping toward Dean, “I wanted to keep you safe from my family. That day, the day I sent you away at school, Crowley had just beat the shit out of me, a few days before, and I knew I deserved it but the night before that day, Michael wanted me to prove I could be an alpha of his standing. He took me to the pier and opened the truck. Crowley was tied up in it.” Cas walked over to the steps and sat down, “Wanna know what he wanted me to do?”
She headed to the kitchen to fix a her a bottle when she heard John’s voice whispering in the kitchen. she stopped on the stairs and listen. “-Told you I’m done. My family. My life’s here, Kate, I’m sorry but this isn’t new. Nothing's gonna change my mind. I love my Omega.” He stopped talking for a moment and Mary saw his shadow shift across the wall, “I’m sorry, Katie, nothing changes. Don’t call again.” Mary heard the flip of John’s ancient phone, he refused to get any new phone. She waited another moment before heading down the stairs with Gracie.
“You're sixteen, you can’t make it on your own.” Michael couldn’t believe the arrogance of Castiel.
I know I've probably said this before but I never thought that I would get so much support and love from this story. Y'all truly are the best. 136 comments and 328 kudos, that completely blows my mind. This is just for y'all. So enjoy!!
As the three boys left the room, Mary walked over to the chair beside John’s bed and sank into it, “I hope we are making the right choice here,” she said holding John's hand.
“Yeah, he gets that way sometimes. I can’t do much because of the whole intended to be thing, until it makes my customers uncomfortable too. That's usually when I get Jo to run him off ‘till Andrea’s shifts over.”
Cas looked up at Dean’s face, “I’ve loved you since we were ten and Michael pushed me down on the playground and even thought he was twice your size you still beat the fuck out of him for me.” Dean chuckled as Cas continued, “Do you remember what you told me, when you helped me up?”
He was almost most done when Mary walked in holding two pizza and some breadsticks, “Need any help,Mom?” Sam asked pushing away from the table and standing up. He rounded the table as Mary sat the pizzas down on the bar that separated the living room and kitchen and walked into the kitchen.
“Hi,” he said softly as Dean walked out of the doorway and stopped a few feet in front of him.
Cas was standing about twenty feet down the hall leaning against the lockers, laughing at something, with his arm thrown around April Kelly. Dean whimpered as a hand landed on his shoulder, “What's wrong, Squirrel? You look like someone stole your puppy,” came a thick scottish accent. Dean didn't take his eyes off of Cas, “Oh,” Crowley said following his line of sight, “I guess someone did steal your puppy.”
Dean sat Gracie in her high chair while Sam helped John get situated.
Dean walked into the living room and sat down in the rocker, softly humming ‘Hey Jude’. Emmy had a steady pace sucking from the bottle. Dean looked down into the face of his beautiful baby girl. He tried not to think about the memories the dream had stirred up but all he could see was Cas’s bright blue eyes and the fear that still sat in them. He could hear Cas saying, “Release me, please. Take her and release me, that’s why I wrote your name name down.”
“I’m gonna make him soup. Why don't you go ahead and fix you some pizza. If you want, I got Dean’s favorite, so maybe take him a peice see if he wants it.”
Dean’s heart melted a little at the sight. Cas holding their baby.
“Dad didn't let me tell him bye or anything, rode with me to the airport and watched as my plane took off.  I wasn't allowed to have any contact with anyone here other than my father.”
“Which part?” Cas asked his voice low and calm.
“I know,” Dean started, “but I want to. I can’t stay here. It’s to hard. He doesn’t want us, Daddy, and Bobby can help me. He knows what to do.” He walked to the steps and looked down at Sam, “Hey,” he said softly, “It’s gonna be ok. I’ll be back in a few months, with the baby.” He smiled down at his brother. Sammy would learn from this, he’ll learn from Dean’s mistake, not that he would ever call his baby a mistake. Now Sam will know what can happen and how not to let it happen. “I’ll miss you.”
“Alright, Mom,” Cas walked back to the living room to catch the tail end of Dean conversation with Mary over the phone, “Yeah, love you too.”
“What about you, Sam?” Dean asked, as they stood and Emmy ran off to find shoes.
Destined to deceive her.
Gracie opened her eyes back up and Dean laid her over his shoulder and batted her back to burp her. Her blues landed on Cas.
It was a fantastic sandwich or maybe Cas was just really hungry. He ate both sandwiches and drank a few glasses of water before he was burning up inside again and wriggling in his chair.
He hadn’t noticed when Dean walked up to him until he heard Maggie giggle and Uriel, the big annoying oaf, ask, “What the hell do you want, Winchester?” Uriel had never liked Dean. Michael would know that Dean was trying to talk to Cas before Dean left. He had to get rid of Dean.
And reaches for his arm
Dean did the only thing he could think of, “Cas!” he hollowed.
He had thought about it but in the end the uniforms changed his mind. He really hated uniforms, “It was long, stayed at home for most of it. And I thought about it some, but we all can’t pull off that uniform as well as you do,”
Much like in the drama room Cas’ fingers danced over the keys but there was other music being played also, on a CD. The pictures flowed effortlessly with Castiel's music. His voice was rougher and impossibly softer at the same time.
“Oh, baby,” Mary sighed pulling Dean into a tight embrace, “I understand a little better now, you feel abandoned. Your alpha disappeared. But why did you let him claim you? Was it a full claiming?” She asked shyly. Dean pulled out of his mother’s grip and placed his head in his hands, slowly he nodded. “Well,” Mary said placing a hand on Dean’s shaking knee, “I love you baby and I get that yall are too young to truly understand the consequences of this but you’ve still got to face the world no one but me you and cas know. Not a lot’s gonna change.  Get dressed, so we can leave.”
“A girl, she has his blue eyes.” the nurse said, she sounded like she was smiling.
After sharing their stories, the car was engulfed in silence again. Cas looked out the window watching the scenery blend together. It wasn't too long before they pulled into Lawrence. "I can get home from here," Cas said as Bobby pulled the car over to the shoulder, "Thank you sir." He said shaking the man's hand before he climbed out.
“Not any more, Mary,” Cas leaned over and kissed her cheek, “I’ll be back in a few hours.” Cas walked out of the kitchen and into the living room.
“Sure Pops, I just came down for something to drink anyway.” Dean got up and walked to the fridge, opening it and grabbing out a bottle of water. He walked back to the table and told the adults goodnight before heading back to Sam’s room.
There are times when he's playing with Emmy or washing up the dishes after supper that he could smell the shame and regret rolling off Dean. He can feel the strain in Dean's arms to keep his hold on Cas light when Cas hugs him. He can feel how almost every move is a well calculated and controlled. He knows that the alpha Dean is now wouldn’t do what the teenage alpha did.
Dean went back to his room and climbed in bed. He faded back to sleep very quick.
“She’s beautiful, Dean,” Jo said. Then she looked past Dean and saw Cas. Her expression changed. It went from warm and light to almost hateful and concerned she looked back at Dean and then at Cas.
Dean walked over to the changing table and began to change her. “What do you mean for me?” he asked as he changed Gracie.  He picked her up as he finished and redressed her. “Do you want to hold her?” Dean asked.
Dean didn't say a word as he watched the scene unfold before him. Cas was so good with Emmy. This is where he belonged, right here in this house, where Dean and Emmy could spend every day with him. This is what they needed, they needed him.
“Of course, sir, what can I do for you?” said a pretty brunette popping up from the floor, “dropped my pen, sorry.”
A phone call that changes lives.
Cas was trying to obey Dean, he really was, but every second he was losing his battle. He was moaning and whimpering. “Dean,” he moaned as Dean licked a stripe up his uncomfortably hard dick. That was when Cas lost any control he had. He wasn’t sure how it happened but he had managed to pull Dean up over him and into a breathtaking kiss. He gave Dean everything he had, putting it all in that kiss, before he shocked Dean by flipping them over. Cas now look down on Dean, his beautiful green eyes wide, there was a tiny red ring around what little green remained.
" He pulled open the large heavy wood door and walked inside. He stood at the threshold for a moment before heading to the stairs that led to the west wing. His wing. He made it up the first flight of stairs before he was shoved into the wall by a rough hand, “You smell like a Winchester, boy,” his father growled.
“Cas was sick, Tadpole, he need someone to help take care of him.” Dean tried to explain to her as he picked her up for a hug.
Cas hesitated but moved over beside Michael, sat down and asked again, “What do you want?”
Dean glanced at Cas before walking up the stairs to his room.
“I’ve got them. They have been moved from the ER the surgical floor, which in floor 3, follow this hallway,” she pointed to the left down a long brightly light hall, “elevators will be on the left. Go up and they open across from the waiting room.
He handed Cas the remote once it was over and Cas looked through the guide before pulling up the DVR and turning on Star Wars.
So I just want to add that this is AU and it might, well it probably will be, different then most A/B/O you might read. I really hope yall like it and if you do let me know. I love getting emails about the story. Thanks to those who have shown love.
Dean followed Sam into the kitchen, trying not to wince as he walked, “Thanks Sammy,” he sighed.
“Out of the ashes you buried me in
“Yes sir,” he gasped as a hand closed around his throat, “J-John… sir… p-punched me.” His father released his grip just enough for Cas to breath and tell him why he was that close to a Winchester again. “I was just walking by. He was outside and saw me. I’m sorry sir.”
“Do you remember what I told you when you had Dean and Sam that because both of you have such strong genes it was gonna complicate the boys some?” he asked as Mary got up from the table, to get a beer for Bobby and John and refill her coffee cup. “I told you when they were born they would be a bit different, but what it mainly comes down to it the alpha and omega in them are equals.”
Sam was a freshman now and Cas was in his senior year. Cas hated that school and most people in it, but at least at school he got 8 hours of tension free peace.
“It must have been nice. I had Anna, but she couldn’t help that much. I was alone in an overly religious family and everyday you and Benny made me ashamed of who I am.” Dean never really knew how much he had hurt the people he bullied in highschool, or how it affected them afterwards. “I made myself whoever I wanted to be to prove to everyone that I could. I’ve sang for the president and the queen of England. I’ve been on six tours, sold over seven million albums and I’ve won twelve awards.”
Cas smiled and raised his hand so she could reach him. She squealed and wrapped her hand around a finger. A small laugh escaped Cas’s lips when she squealed, Cas found himself falling head over heels for this little girl. He decided right then, with his daughter’s hand wrapped around his finger, that he was gonna fix this. He was gonna bring his family back together. The hell with Michael and any other alpha that stepped in his way. He would figure out how to be the alpha that Dean and Gracie needed.
Back in the living room, sitting in the couch Dean took another swig from the bottle and passed it to Cas, “Your turn,” said turning to face Cas, who was looking at him, “truth or dare?”
“X-Ray,” Cas said just barely looking up at Dean, “the doctor said that it looked broken but the x-ray will tell for sure. She’ll be back in few.” Cas dropped his eyes to the floor, “I’m so sorry Dean,” he whispered just barely loud enough for Dean to hear.
“Ok,” Cas breathed out a small sigh of relief. He couldn’t express how happy he was that Dean rejected that last idea. He had to suggest it but that didn’t mean he wanted it. He knew that he couldn’t have what he wanted; he wanted them both here with him all the time, “umm, you can take a pillow or a dirty shirt or something that smells like me.”
“And you don’t still love me?” Cas asked placing a small kiss on the side of his neck just below Dean’s ear. He felt Dean tense again but Dean didn’t pull away. Cas sighed into his neck and pressed his nose a little more into Dean’s neck, pulling him closer. He let Dean’s scent fill his nostrils. He was getting dizzy, drunk on Dean. It had been too long since he had had Dean in his arms, able to smell the thick leather and spice, breathing in again he could tell something had changed there was less smell and something different, apples, fresh and crisp. Grace.
“I have to go get the burgers on the grill, you wanna go inside and play with Uncle Gabe and Lisa and Ben and maybe Uncle Sam will let you ride on his back,”  he rose off the swing and Emmy followed.
But if it has to end
“Are the mate of Castiel Novak?”
Dean was unsure how long he had sat there, tuning out the world and focusing on the gravestone. He jumped to his feet as he heard a deep voice softly saying, “You’re wrong you know.” Dean was even more surprised to see who the voice belonged to.
“Are you okay?” Emmy asked looking up at Dean, her voice bringing Cas out of whatever fog he had been in.
Cas moved two to his plate also and looked back to Dean, “Umm, there's already butter on them, want syrup?”
“Who the hell do you think you are?” a second voice growled out echoing thru the hallway and penetrating the walls around Castiel. He could feel the power behind the words, the alpha scratching his way to surface. Cas knew when his father’s Alpha came out to play someone would get hurt.
Cas sighed he had to play this right, he was surrounded by family. Most of which were alphas and answered only to michael. shit, he hated this. He seemed to hate a lot of things now. “No,” Cas snapped, “How about you stop being a needy bitch and move on. I have,” he placed an arm around Maggie’s shoulders and pulled her closer to him. He could smell the sadness seeping out of Dean, “Fuck you,” he heard Dean mumble as he walked away. Uriel and Maggie seemed to think that this was the funniest thing they had seen in awhile. Their laughs could be heard echoing around the courtyard.
“You're not walking,” Dean growled, Alpha leaking out in his words. Cas bowed his head and started whimpering, “I’m sorry, god Cas, I'm so sorry.” Dean moved closer to Cas but stopped himself before he was to close. “I can’t control it sometimes, as you know, I’ll get Sam to drive you home. I can call him right now. You don’t have to stay around me any longer.”
“Sorry, Mar,” he began but Mary shut him up with a raised hand.
Cas pried the hand off his shoulder and had it twisted behind Uriel’s back before the older boy knew what happened, “What the fuck makes you think that even if I did take Michael’s place you would be anywhere near my operation,” his voice was sharp and menacing. He let go of Uriel’s arm, pushed him away and into a the brick wall on the outside of the building.
Nothing else was said, they were just there. Dean was leaned over the white hospital bed and John had both arms wrapped tightly around his oldest son.
“You need to eat,” Dean said, “I made sandwiches.”
“Uncover,” Bobby told him and helped him pull the blankets off him. Under the cover, his shirt was soaked to the skin with sweat, you could see the faint outline of his ribs. “Are you more comfortable with the heavy weight of the comforter on you then without it ?” Dean nodded. “I’m gonna push around on your stomach let me know if anything hurts.”Again Dean nodded.
Bobby was sitting at the kitchen table, nursing a warming beer, when John arrived a few hours later. Bobby was Mary’s uncle and doctor when she was pregnant with both Dean and Sam. He was the one person she knew that she could count on no matter what. He wanted to punch that smug looking bastard in his face when he strolled into the house, tossing his leather jacket on the back of the couch and his keys on the counter.
Then Cas got angry, “There's a criminal around my daughter,” not realizing what he had just told ‘Drea.
To say that Dean was starting to freak out was a bit of an understatement. He was starting to breath heavy and tears were streaming down his face. He knew that if he had her right now she would die. He knew she wasn't strong enough yet. “Dean,” Bobby voice rang through the panic attack brewing inside him, “Boy, I need you to calm down right now. Take deep breaths,” Bobby tried to sooth him, but the beta just couldn't calm the omega.
“Yes Ma’am, I will. Can you call the school to check us out?” he asked, looking down at Dean, smiling softly.
“Six months, Cassie, only six months.” They walked outside together, “Can I stay on the porch?” Dean asked looking around at the wrap around porch.
“They are ok. They were a little bangged up but nothing too bad." They both looked over at their boys, still not noticing that John had woken up.
Dean was 19, just turned 19, he knew he couldn’t have a family, but he does now. He has a family. He has an omega and a child. They have a kid together, surely that changes things now. It took Dean a moment but he finally said, “They are coming home with me. They’re mine. We will be together like we always should have been.”
Dean tried to tell Cas about the baby.
Upstairs Dean sat up straight, unsure of what had woken him until he looked over and noticed that Grace was gone. He rushed out of his room and down the stairs only to find her giggling at her grandfather, while Mary made a bottle.
"Hey baby," Dean said, sweetly, leaning over to kiss Cas. The kiss lasted a few second then Dean pulled away.
Dean laid there listening to the shallow breaths coming from the only person besides Sam that he'd ever really cared about, loved even. He knew he cared more about Cas then he did himself. He'd give the world to never have this night end. He wasn't good for Cas he saw that this afternoon when he'd robbed the store he saw the disappointment in those beautiful blue eyes. He would never forget that look.
The last kid that got picked on, on a regular schedule, was Cas- shit- what was his name Cas Milton. His name was something other than Cas but Dean couldn’t think of it. Cas was a joke at best. He was a seventeen year old that wore suits and trench coats to school. The kid was practically begging to be beat up. Benny started with him, but once Dean had seen the small, messy haired, blue eyed geek, he was sold.
"Castiel," Cas says shyly. They rode in silence for a while before Bobby reached over and turned on the radio, Cas listen to the song that purred out of the old speakers.
After he had laid Gracie in her bed he grabbed a throw off of his bed in the room across the hall. He walked back the living room to find that Dean had laid down all the way down on the couch. Cas smiled while throwing the blanket over him. He walked into the kitchen and decided to fix some lunch while Dean was asleep.
Dean moaned, feeling Cas spasm inside him again, as he claimed him. Dean felt something just for a moment something changed. He felt it, something shifted deep inside him. He felt a burning that wasn’t there before, it eased as Cas drew back. Blood was tinging his lips, Cas leaned down and kissed Dean.
Cas stayed hovering over Dean for a few seconds before falling on top of him and rolling to the bed. They both lay there not moving for a moment or two before Dean rolled on his side, facing Cas, and curled around him, head lying on his chest, listening and the fast beat slowed to a steady rhythm. They didn’t say anything, just laid there, cum quickly cooling in their boxers, both being too blissed out to care.
“Oh hey love,” she said as she turned around to look at him, “I didn’t hear anyone, thought you were upstairs. Have you been in to check on Dean since you've been home?”
“How about we stay on the shore, instead of the pier, not sure how sturdy it is.” Sam had just stepped on the pier, and froze as the boards croaked under his weight, as John said this, he quickly backed up and got off the boards.
“Are you coming also, Alpha?” Cas asked stepping closer to Dean as he closed the door.
Cas opened the door listening to it creak softly as he pushed it open, “Would you like to come in for a moment?” Cas asked trying to keep his voice even.
Hey guys. so sorry for the long wait. i know this chapter probably has has it flaws but if any of them are to bad just let me know. i want to thank all of you, those that have been with me through out this story and those that are just now reading it. the fact this story has done so well is amazing to me. i enjoy reading everything that yall have to say and the comments and kudos make my day. i promise that i will not give up on this story this next chapter hopefully wont take as long.  i love you all, my dearest readers.
And the fire you put me through turned me into gold
“You don’t have to go, Dean,” John said breaking the silence that had fallen over them since Dean had told them what he wanted to do. Mary agreed, nodding her head, as her husband spoke. Things were still somewhat tense between John and Mary, but above all else Mary loved her Alpha. They would work this out and Kate would fade away. She leaned into her alpha’s grasp.
Dean turned on the baby monitor, left the door cracked open and went back down stairs.
How is someone okay with a mark that they didn't ask for?
Dean walked over to the table with his sandwich on a plate and his drink. He ate and passed time playing on his phone. When his sandwich was finished and his glass empty, he went back to the kitchen and dumped them in the dishwasher.
“We say goodbye
I, I am golden, golden, gold
Dean, Sam, Mary, Benny and Gracie stopped by Ellen’s the next day for lunch. Dean had been promising to bring Gracie by and after spending the morning in the hospital, taking turns sitting beside an unconscious John, they all decided they needed some good food.
Cas walked into his room and ruffled through his drawers pulling out a soft worn shirt that he thought would fit Dean and a pair of sweats that were a little too big on him. He couldn't believe that Dean wanted to stay here, that they might actually have a chance at being together. He knew that their wouldn't be a third chance if he fucked up again.
It's hard to walk away
“Yeah, me either,” Dean said hanging up.
Her husband walked to her and wrapped his arms around her. "It's gonna be ok hon. Cas is a smart kid he'll figure it out sooner or later. Fate will show her cards eventually. Let's go in." She gets up and follows her husband inside.
“Good,” Ion patted his shoulder before parting ways and going to his own class.
"Boy, you won't get far." Cas heard his mother say before he closed the door.
It wasn't perfect, it was barely even ok, but there in that room with Gracie asleep in her crib and Cas’ arms wrapped snugly around him, Dean felt content. It was a kind of contentment that he hadn't felt in a long time.
Cas sank his teeth deep in Dean's neck before he really even realised what he had done. He tasted the metallic sting of Dean's blood leaking into his mouth. Cas came, with his body smashed tightly against Dean’s.
Cas smiled but didn’t take the baby. “I don’t know how,” Cas confessed.
He found Sam and Dean running around the yard, Dean chasing Sam yelling, “Eat it I dare ya.” John laughed as he sat down on the top step and just watched his boys for a while. Dean finally caught up with Sam and pinned him to the ground by sitting on him.
John grabbed the fishing gear and walked up to the porch, sitting them down by the steps, he walks into the cabin to take a look around. He coughed at the dust his heavy boots stirred up as he walked in. The floorboards squeaked under his weight as he walked around the small room to check everything out.
Dean paid extra detail to the pictures of Benny, seeing if Becky was able to get any others than the ones that Dean had sent her and she had. There were a few that Dean had never seen, which was weird because he was in a few of them.
“Oh,” Mary said, moving around Sam and grabbing the dish, “this is for you,” She handed the dish to Dean and gave him a hug, “love you, Dean.”
“No problem, Ma’am.” Crowley said before hanging up the phone and handing it back to Dean. “Seem’s like I’m taking you home. I’m gonna go get our stuff out of class and talk to Copeland. I’ll be back in a minute, ‘kay.” Dean nodded and tried to pull himself up but Crowley place a hand on his shoulder to stop him, “Stay,” he said standing up and looking back at Dean, “I’ll be back in a minute and I want you to still be sitting right there.”
Crowley, their English teacher, well professor as he liked to correct everyone, shushed the class with a loud whistle, “Shut up, you wankers,” the comment was meant for the whole class but it was Dean and Gordon he was looking at when he said it. Cas wasn’t sure how Crowley still had a job considering that he was constantly talking down to his students, calling them names and he clearly had his favorites. Cas was one of those favorites. The rest of the class went by without a hitch, well except for a random pop quiz. Cas was sure he aced it but from the complaints he heard as he was leaving the room, he wasn’t sure everyone else had.
Dean watched as high school and some college photos of the missing classmates flowed across the screen. Everyone looked so happy.
He passed the bathroom that was on the opposite wall than Dean’s room  and opened the door next to Dean’s. It was Gracie’s room. Cas knew that these room may never be used but he wanted them ready for his family in case they were ever needed. Gracie’s crib was placed against the wall in front of the door. It was a stormy grey high back victorian style crib. There was a matching dresser and changing table in the room also. He had plans for this room, his little princesses room. It was going to outstanding.
“What do you want, Michael?”
Cas was sitting on the couch. He looked uncomfortable and out of place. His back was straight and his hand folded tightly in his hands. He looked like a statue on the dark burgundy couch.
“No, Cas, I don’t think I will.” He took another deep breath still scenting Cas. “You smell so good Cas. mmmm,” he moaned, “I can take good care of you Cas. I can be the only Alpha you’ll ever want.”
Emmy whinned again, as Dean stopped humming. He smiled and stood up holding the bundle close to him before heading back upstairs to his, their, room.
hey everyone! heres another chapter hope y'all like let me know comments help me work faster!
“Even though I’m technically your brother,” Cas didn't like the subject, but he knew that it needed to be talked about, he wouldn't go through another freak out like the night they had gotten drunk.
Dean did as he was asked and climbed into bed beside Cas. Dean pulled Cas into his arms and it wasn’t long before they were both asleep.
Dean was showing real good by 20 weeks but that was also when the effects of not having his alpha started to affect him. It started slowly, nothing to bad just cramps and some sickness. Then it gradually got worse. Dean became more withdrawn, staying in the house or in his room all day.
Cas digs his nails into Dean's side with a frustrated groan.
Cas didn't know how to respond to that so he kept quiet, opening the passenger door for Dean to slid into the seat. He closed the door behind Dean and fished the car keys out of his pocket. He opened the driver's door and climbed behind the wheel.
