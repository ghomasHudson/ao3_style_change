“But everyone needs a reassuring and devoted friend like you.  Happy Birthday!” Steve and John concluded in unison.
“Maria said yes?”
Before they all realized it, the hour struck past ten, and tired and spent, the guests began to disperse while Sherlock, John, Steve, and Bucky met with Nick Fury and Mycroft Holmes outside, ready to have the limousine drive them to the airport to their destination.
“I’m still angry, you berk…” muttered the Army doctor, but his eyes were glistening and his voice had a faint sprinkling with relief as he gently caressed Sherlock’s face for a fleeting second.
“Aw, c’mon!” Deadpool whined as he was trying to fend off the numerous blows, “The Daily Mail’s paying me one million for these pics!  I’ll give you a cut –

“Noted and ignored.  Have a nice day, Mister Groot.”
The response was pretty much as could be expected.
“Oh come on - !” Sherlock objected, but John’s next words struck him dumb.
Sherlock and John simply shared a single, significant look before they acted instantly.
) it wasn’t so bad.
“I argued with everyone for hours, worried and eager to storm through the castle and rip it apart brick by brick myself if it meant getting you back safely.  It got so heated that I actually tried to punch Scrooge, and Wreck-It Ralph threatened to sit on me if I didn’t calm down.”
“Piss…off…” coughed Sherlock weakly.  Baymax just tilted his head in confusion.
” Coulson yelled, raising everyone’s alarm and causing an absolute fright as he, Anthea, Natasha Romanoff, Sam, and Maria Hill dashed after an odd mercenary, dressed in his black and red body suit.  In the background, Bruce Banner kept doing calming breathing exercises, doing his best to not Hulk out in the middle of the reception with Phillip Anderson’s encouragement.
“Such language!  I do wonder what your dear old
“Although the other Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy send their love and wish you a very wonderful birthday for you and your family, Kelley,” John added.
“You’re here to give the public appearance of Scotland Yard’s contribution with taking down the Hydra base and counteracting their terrorist activities in England with MI-6,” Fury intoned, “Since S.H.I.E.L.D and I need to work in the shadows, we can’t risk any light or exposure on our role in this.  In other words, you will bask in the glory of taking the credit for this Hydra scion in the press, and your only task is to stand in front of the camera, look pretty, and answer stupid questions and calm the dumbasses down while we take care of any lingering traces.”
“Oh who are you kidding, you pinhead?!  You’re not associated with MI-6 at all!  Quit making promises you can’t keep once your brother finds out about this!”
“I’ll go help Dawson and Basil…” sighed Hiro as he took off to help control Bronx.
Take one of Robin Hood’s broken arrows and shove the tip through the wolf’s eye socket and directly into the cerebral cortex and the suprachiasmatic nucleus…
chair, you venal pillock.”
“And we’re with you both until the end of the line…” John murmured as he rested his cheek against Bucky’s chest.
negotiations don’t involve death or disfigurement.  Actually, let me amend that: you could offer hysterical blindness as an option the instant you show you ugly mug in full to anyone with functional eyesight.”
Mycroft’s demeanor was impressively cold and unflappable as he replied, aloof, “I would rather double-check and confirm my suspicions with actual facts, not speculations, Sergeant Donovan.  Unlike what you did during the kidnapping of the Bruhl children several years ago…”

Baymax however continued, “Scan complete.  I sense both you and Sherlock are injured.  I also detect massive injuries to the Sheriff of Nottingham along with a lack of heartbeat.  Therefore, restructuring priority according to protocol based on the severity of trauma.”
To say things got worse would have been a gross understatement.
“I am neither deaf, dumb, nor blind.  That excuse will
reassuring.
“‘…and then I emptied out the container’.  Unquote,” finished Coulson.
Before Robin Hood could try to make a move, the Sheriff then brought his dagger to Sherlock’s neck, centimeters from slashing his throat.  Sherlock winced, but he managed to suppress the groan out of his mouth as he continued to blink.
Sherlock was holding a beautiful black Keyblade, composed of an extraordinary metal, unlike any other the detective had ever studied from past experiments or science texts.  Darker than obsidian yet pristine and flawless.  Under the sun, Sherlock’s Keyblade gleamed with a fine polish.  The blade was tall, thin and elegant with Victorian swirls and tendrils dancing along the lower edges.  And at the mouth of the Keyblade was a carved and flattened impression in the shape of a black honeybee, with wings and legs stretched out and complete with a large stinger and antenna.  The detail of the hairy legs, antennae, and the veins in the bee’s wings were breathtakingly exquisite.  The cross-guard of the weapon was a perfect outline of a hexagon, like a honeycomb, with the grip of the weapon wrapped in soft, dark velvet that gave a luxurious feeling against Sherlock’s callused palm.  And the rainguard of the Keyblade was a dark, polished disc of marble stamped with the image of a magnifying glass.  Hanging from the end of the Keyblade, attached to the black onyx pommel-stone, was a thin keychain.  At the end of the fine chain was a metal mold in the shape of a deerstalker hat against the outline of a metal heart.  Except oddly enough, the left side of the heart was filled with white.
Steve couldn’t finish the sentence as he shuddered in delight of the memories of Sherlock brushing his lips and tongue against each and every part of his body, murmuring huskily the anatomical body part in between licks.  Steve was already feeling hard again.
“Of course,” the dark-haired Nobody drawled out with a sadistic smile, cheshire and so coldly vicious, as he straightened out his tie while walking out of the shadows, “After all, it would be a shame for Sherlock and Doctor Watson to die before they witness my new look.  Because, baby…
Not the face, not the – actually, hold on a minute…”
break through it!”
“We’ll take this, thank you!” yelled Dawson and he and Basil successfully grabbed the medallion before it could fall and hurriedly slid down the adipose tissue bulging on his back before roughly landing on the grass and hightailing away from the Sheriff as quickly as the two mice could.
Various screams rang throughout the bastion as a good number of Prince John’s sentries were quickly blown away by a powerful and localized hurricane and besieged by pellets of hail, ice chunks larger than golf balls.
Bucky blinked before shirking backwards a bit in shame while Sherlock looked on in triumph.
Groot then waved his arm holding his rose before chirping, “I am Groot.
“Bloody hell, I don’t know!  Just keep firing!” yelled Lestrade as he reloaded his pistol, taking cover behind his BMW along with Sherlock.
going to cover this.
Then to everyone’s surprise at the end of their dance, Steve then reached out with one hand to offer to Sherlock.  A bit suspicious, Sherlock took it and had the good Captain America lead the Detective to the dance floor while Bucky did a bow and offered his hand to John Watson.
Lestrade would have broken down and cried for every tourist, Londoner, and officer he lost from this sudden attack if it could have helped.
“I guess the two really wanted to make sure that Moriarty stays dead this time…” offered Lestrade at last.
“Please.  Punching
to get you back Sherlock.”
” screamed Sherlock suddenly in excruciating agony, howling to the heavens, and breaking John out of reverie as the Rhino Heartless constricted his grip around Sherlock’s bruised chest even further.  The dark-haired detective arched back in pain before he went limp like a rag doll, panting and fresh blood now dribbling out of his mouth, sputtering weakly.
“If…if anything happened to Sherlock while we were held hostage…if Sherlock got hurt or died again trying to rescue me…”
Sherlock’s checks were now vermillion with a lethal touch of purple as he rumbled severely.
Bucky couldn’t help but sniff as his throat clogged up.
You blokes are famous, the most recognized Disney characters in history!”
Sherlock and Bucky both felt their stomachs drop as they audibly took in a breath simultaneously in distress.
Lestrade thought about it before he nodded.
Regardless, both of them were strained and ready to spring as the Sheriff of Nottingham stood there calmly, the obese wolf not even batting an eyebrow as he idly picked his clawed fingernails with a sharp dagger.
recognizable state,” mused Basil thoughtfully at his partner’s foolish command.
Both Steven and John had obviously just gone through a horrific beating before this next photo was taken.  Dazed and barely conscious, John and Steven were displaying bloody bruises and injuries across their faces.  Despite the likely concussions, both John and Steven were forced to raise their heads up in order to look at the camera by the mercenary Crossbones, yanking them both cruelly by the hair.  John was wincing in pain, one eyes swollen shut due to the blooming red all around his face and his nose was bleeding and dripping on his woolen jumper.  Steve was actually much, much worse (Brock Rumlow clearly took pleasure in satisfying his grudge).  One side of Steven’s face was smeared with blood, and Steve was biting down on the rag stuffed in his mouth in agony with gritted teeth, trying cope with the discomfort of his recent thrashing.  And to Bucky’s dread, Steven’s right arm was at an odd and horrific angle, with a bit of bone jabbing out the skin and flesh.
“Shut up…” Bucky gasped, his PTSD already making his breathing shallow, his heart beating madly against his ribcage like a jackhammer.  Bucky was starting to feel dizzy, vertigo threatening to make him vomit the plum he just previously ingested.
Mycroft knew the game well as he returned emotionlessly, “There are plans in place should that ever occur as well as additional safeguards for John Watson and Steven Rogers.  Along with the Avengers and their…associates, of course.”
“I’m actually more worried about the car Bucky is using to run down Sherlock…” John murmured, his mouth set in a thin line.
“I thought that would get your attention,” the Sheriff bragged as he then dug the edge of the dagger closer to Sherlock’s neck, biting into the man’s skin, “So, do we have a deal?”
Steve chuckled as he buried his nose against Sherlock’s neck, “Don’t worry, Sherlock.  There wasn’t any bleeding, and Bucky made sure to apply a lot of lube, so you’re good.  Right?”
Rope burns around the wrists, glazed and sluggish eye movement indicating a slight concussion from Crossbones punching John in the head, heavy breathing signifying irregular heart palpitations from whatever they used to drug him and Steven…
“Hey, what took you so long, Buck?” Steven joked shakily in between wheezes (showing a mouth full of blood and cracked teeth).
“Bastard,” John said without malice.
Sir Hiss was incapacitated and immobilized by that damned inventor boy in the robotic, purple suit…
“You’re still a punk,” Bucky whispered in Steve’s ear.
“Someone stole all our arrows!  We have nothing to shoot them with!”
a polyamorous wedding, right?” Tony Stark asked no one in particular as he sipped his brandy.
“Go play in traffic, you blood-sucking urinal.”
Sherlock, finally feeling some shame and remorse seep into his icy eyes, looked down, abashed.
” cried out Lestrade, helpless to do anything but watch.
arguments.  I daresay the group therapy sessions are actually working,” Mrs. Hudson replied with a straight face as she sipped her coffee.
Mycroft Holmes forced himself to watch on through the CCTV from his office.
Judging from the smile on Laura’s face, it seemed she would get a mother quicker than she expected.
"You don't seem very okay with this. Does it bother you?"
know you have a world outside of Baker Street."
Sherlock rubs the space between his eyes and tilts his head up so he doesn't have to look at him. He will stay until morning. No amount of morphine or whiskey will make him float away like his other problems. He's tried.
Uncle Greg follows behind Dr. Molly. He carries white flowers. Nana takes them from him and adds them to the growing pile on the table.
Now, he can blessedly forget it all. The gouges in his back, the baby, the night at the restaurant, the feeling of weightlessness when his feet left the roof, so many many things to forget. Do normal people have to forget this much?
Something is wrong with his eyes. They look too big for his long face. He touches the bow and his frown softens. He bends down and picks her up. Beebee is all bones, not like Daddy. Daddy is best at snuggles in his chair. She said so, and Daddy made her go sit with Beebee because she hurt his feelings.
Sherlock sits cross legged next to her. The ground is damp from the sprinklers. He plucks some weeds away and absentmindedly ties them into a chain, like he used to for Rosie. Though she always took her flower jewelry off because they attracted bees, and the little darling, no matter how many times Sherlock explained to her, could not let go of her fear of being stung.
Rosie keeps her hand on Grandma's skirt. She tries to stop her from hugging Mr. Mycroft. She might turn to stone. Grandma hugs him, and he winces and does not hug her back. He shakes Grandpa's hand. He does not look at Rosie.
"Bit mean springing it on you like that, I know." He rubs his neck sheepishly.
Up close, she could see who it was, but this face was a stranger's. It wasn't right. But why? Had her father been gone so long that she was forgetting what he looked like? Of course this stranger wasn't her father. Her daddy had blue eyes, and this man's was brown. His face was too long, nose too big.
Later that night, long after the lights have shut off, Sherlock lays as flat as he can on the cold linoleum floor. John raises an eyebrow from the edge of the mattress, looking down at him.
Sherlock uses the end of the spoon to levy up the loose tile and his fingers sneak in to grab the plastic baggie. He takes out the parchment with shaking hands. The white powder inside spills to the floor. He tosses the baggie in the sink.
Mr. Mycroft sits in the chair at his bedside. He doesn't look up from his phone.
"In a way," he says stiffly.
John watches him as he dials her number.
She folds her arms across her chest and slumps in her chair. She refuses to look at the food.
Daddy's eyes are in Heaven too, is what Nana said. Rosie drew a picture of him, but she got his wings wrong. So she keeps it folded up so no one can see what it looks like. She doesn't know how to write yet, so she asked Nana if she would write her letter to Daddy. Rosie signed it though. She knows how to write her name. Her letter and picture will be buried with him.
She looks up, tears leaking down her face. "Muh-my job. To be-be doctor. I'm s'posed to take care of you now." She gulps and ducks her head down into her hands again and weeps.
Suffice to say, not many patients here like him.
The knowledge settles over him like the orange blankets they give out at crime scenes. Her desertion does not surprise him, he has been abandoned plenty in the past.
"She won't starve."
Lestrade squeezes him like he will vanish if he lets go. Sherlock hugs him back, resting his chin on one broad shoulder, his arm around the other. Lestrade's breath hitches and he pulls away, wiping at his eyes.
Hands tighten around his biceps. His back is killing him, pressed into the cold, hard tile all night. He's getting too old for this. His head feels like he hit it on the toilet, pounding in time with his blood pressure.
Rosie's insides twist. "Oh...Okay."
Uncle Greg squeezes her tight and looks her right in the eye. "Honey, you are so pretty," he says. "But you are also so smart like your Beebee and so brave like your Daddy. And we need princesses like that."
She shades her eyes from the sun as she looks up at him.
"Hello Rosamund," he nods. "It's an honor to meet you."
Mycroft squeezes his shoulder, the closest to affection of which he was nearly capable. "Good. Because no one would love you if you were stupid."
Sherlock gulps and shuts his eyes, the darkness comforting for once. He has this. He curls into himself and presses his forehead on his knees. He still has time.
Rosie thinks about this. "Well, if Stella dies too, then I'll get to marry you."
Before he loses the chance, Sherlock suddenly pinches Lestrade's sleeve between his fingers. The DI turns, brow raised.
Her eyes are dry. "I haven't. I mean, I quit all-all
A low droning flies past his ear. A blur of yellow hovers over the flowers, passing over one to the next, the cycle of nature present before his eyes. He follows it through the garden, crouching on his hands and knees. At some point, Mrs. Wannop leaves him.
Sherlock's entire body locks up. There comes a point in one's life when a visible persona overtakes who they truly are. Sherlock is no longer certain of who he is. For so many years he understood that he needed no one and no one wanted him. That was the legacy of the last Holmes children. That was what made them Holmeses. There was that briefest of connections at Uni, twenty years ago, where he thought he could be -
against the wall.
"I shouldn't have - "
He ignores her. "Yes that's her."
to see through.
She swallows and curls her fingers into a fist. "No. I don't hate you," she says softly.
Grandpa is frowning. Beebee is sitting on a stone bench beneath a tree talking with a general. He looks like a soldier. Blue hat on the side of his head, and fancy gold shoulder hats. He has medals over his coat too. Rosie's daddy was a soldier. He fought the bad guys.
Sherlock feels something squeeze in his chest and turns to John. "You observe that?"
Rosie wakes up from a nightmare. Her pants are wet, the front of her nightgown soaked. And her leg aches.
Finally he says, "Rosamund would like to speak with you."
She looks at Sherlock for the first time, and something about the loneliness in her gaze resonates with him in such an intimate way that he sways in her direction, as if gravitated to her.
"I'm sorry - "
She just wants to go home.
Rosie peeks between the bars on the stairs that lead up to her and Daddy's room. This is where she and Nana play Spy, and they sneak up on Daddy and Beebee when they come home from the work.
She wipes her thumb on her jeans and her mouth twists in a snarl. "Losing a limb." She shakes her head. "It's not. You're going about your business, and you get a call saying a piece of the planet suddenly fell off into space. And it's gone forever."
Rosie, still in her pee stained nightgown, creeps to the mirror and opens her one good eye. She touches the eyepatch, and her reflection does the same, so she knows it is her in the mirror. The pink, wrinkled lines across her forehead and cheeks from where the window burst open. The fuzzy patches where her hair is still growing back after the surgery because her brain got too big.
So she
Sherlock climbs out, much more steady than he thought he would be. The tile is warm under his feet.
He feels his stomach twist and thinks hard before answering. Even then, the explanation is clumsy. "I had to go to hospital because I hurt myself on the inside."
What was that song Mummy sang?
They sit at a table in the visitor's area, two cups of earl grey tea breaching the space between them.
But then the sheer fucking
Sherlock doesn't give the attendant time to finish. He's halfway out the door, one boxing glove still on his hand, a familiar high pumping through him.
The circle is silent for a moment, then the moderator leans forward. "There's an emptiness there, isn't there. How did you fill it?"
He did his job. John had the perfect wedding. Husband and wife dance, and the bridesmaid goes home with a suitable man.
She meets him on a Wednesday during daytime television hours.
She wriggles down from Uncle Greg's arms and hobbles to her Beebee. He blinks and looks down at her, eyebrows making a squiggle and his mouth tightens. Rosie hugs his leg because that is as high as she can reach. She can reach her arms all the way around. Beebee is very tall, but also very skinny. Daddy says he's not as tall as he seems, but Rosie knows better because Daddy is very very tall and Beebee towers over him.
"That was... wow. I never... God, we're rubbish at this talking thing, aren't we? I'm so sorry I left. That I didn't come back to you when you came back for me. That I felt I had to stay with Mary.
"Mary just wasn't right for me. It was never going to work, even if she wasn't who she turned out to be. I thought I needed her, needed a relationship. I didn't want to be alone. Well, I guess I still do, but not like that. Not like her.
"I love you too. So much."
"You... Oh God. That's why you planned the wedding and all, wasn't it? You thought it would make me happy?"
As for Mary, she's... gone. I won't be talking much about it on here, just this much: There was a case, a man named Nathan Garrideb had come to Sherlock for help. He had been contacted by an American lawyer who claimed to have the same rare last name, telling him they needed to find someone else called Garrideb so that the three of them could share some heritage. Our client was over the moon about this at first and wanted Sherlock to help find the third Garrideb, but it turned out of course the American was in fact an impostor and a wanted criminal. He had hidden loot in the flat Nathan Garrideb moved into years later and was now trying to recover it. We went along with the American's plan to get Garrideb out of the flat and confronted him there. Well, that didn't go as planned. It went horribly wrong in fact. Mary got shot. That's all there is to say really. Now for the most recent things.
"It does, doesn't it? Just Rosie, you and me."
"No, please, let me finish. You know this sort of stuff is difficult for me, but I have to get this out now or else I'll implode. What's happened now - her working with Moriarty and all... Well, I had suspected as much for some time, and her faking her death made me sure. It was just too big of a coincidence that I should have married an ex assassin. It had to be planned.
Before she could start telling us her story, Greg, DI Hopkins and Sgt Donovan arrived to arrest her. They had followed her and seen her come up. But Sherlock got them to wait with taking her to the station so she could explain herself first.
"But, you can't be - How is this possible? You worked with him all along? How did I not notice? How?! And Moriarty. He shot himself in the head. I saw. He can't be alive."
"Can you come here for a second? There is something... "
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock had gone to the house with them. He found no traces of anyone having broken into the house or of the figure at the window Mortimer had described. But in the lamp that was on the table where the siblings had sat he had found traces of a strange red powder, which turned out to be "Devil's Foot" when he analyzed them later. Of course Sherlock had to burn some of the stuff even though he already knew what fatal effects it could have. He was lucky he only used an extremely small amount and Mrs Hudson and I got him out in time.
"That was very brave of you."
safe, you and Rosie."
"In love with you? I didn't admit it to myself for some time, but I'm fairly sure now it was our first case together, after I had realized you were the one who had shot the cabbie. I... I came so close to telling you so many times. When I stood on the rooftop. On that tarmac. But it wouldn't have been fair. I didn't know when - if we were going to see each other again. I thought you were going to be ok.
John, I know I've said it before, but if you need anything... Well, you know, I'm here.
"Yes, I guess we do have some things to talk about, don't we?"
"... Sergeant, we will have to call these two in for questioning tomorrow."
I have to admit there is a bit more to this story, but I can't write it up here yet because there are some people to protect. Maybe someday the whole story can be told.
Well if you must know, I am not. Did you really believe I could rely on purely theoretical experience on an aspect that important to human nature? I couldn't even do my job without it, it's an essential motive for most crimes. I only ever feel attracted to people I have a... connection with though. I - There was... someone. At uni. Victor. He was the only person who ever came close to a friend before I had you."
"I knew it. I knew there was more to that. He was going to let you die there, wasn't he? You thought you weren't going to come back, and Mycroft knew it too. That little shit. Thank god we managed to avert that in time."
"I - I'm... Aren't you and Rosie going back to your house at some point, I mean, eventually...?"
But just when Sherlock had figured out Mortimer had done it, the friend who had brought him to Sherlock came rushing in. Mortimer had been found dead, too. Of course, it turned out he had also died from poisoning by "Devil's Foot". At first I thought it might have been suicide out of guilt, but Sherlock didn't believe that. There were signs of someone exiting his room through a window. The link that was still missing was where Mortimer had gotten the root extract in the first place. He'd never been to Africa himself and the stuff was nearly impossible to get you hands on even in the darker parts of the internet. Sherlock's theory was that Mortimer's supplier was someone with a connection to his siblings who wasn't happy with what he had done, but that person was nowhere to be found and had left nearly no traces. So the case is closed now.
He giggles and something in his eyes makes Rosie's stomach tighten. They're too wide, glimmering, like underwater.
She threw that magazine at the wall and hit him three times with her hand before the nurses were able to lead her away. She nearly hit them too. She glared at him over her shoulder.
Once, she laughs out loud, and Sherlock feels goose flesh on his neck it is so haunting. He hasn't heard her laugh in ages. Her voice has haunted his memories, drugged and foggy as they were, by screaming that she hated him.
He leans into Jim as he strokes his hair. "It's not too late," he murmurs.
"I know."
After, he had requested permission to open an investigation with Lestrade. Murder, he hoped. Malicious intent upon him for some grievance he'd caused. It must have been. At least then, fault could be identified. But, as he'd been told many years ago, he could see through everything, except when there was
Rosie gulps and wipes her wrist across her eyes.
She is a terrible dancer, with poor judgement in men's personalities, but she talked to Sherlock. The first time to play coy. She was looking for a date. She came alone to the wedding, so she hoped the best man would be interested. A deep shame seeped under her confident spread of makeup and push up strapless bra.
Rosie puts one finger on her chin like she's seen Beebee do, and watches her uncle's eyes. Beebee taught her that whenever Uncle Greg lies, he tends to bite his cheek and look away from the right answer.
She knots her fingers together, squirming in place and looking at him from the corner of her eye.
She gives a thumbs up to Sherlock and nods to the acceptably hot man with the elephant tie he had pointed out earlier.
But no one asked Sherlock. He may have said it already. They don't listen to him though.
She manages to drift off, and wakes when she hears Dr. Molly. She keeps her eyes closed because it sounds like she and Mr. Mycroft are arguing.
It's so sudden and unexpected that she's not quite sure what's happened. A sharp smack to her right cheek, just under the eye patch. She blinks for a moment, her head snapped to the side. She raises her hand to touch the burning patch of skin.
The colors have bled into the sheets from her tears by the time she falls asleep.
Hot tears spill down his face. He buries his face into his knees and shudders.
"Well enough" to not to want to forget it all, to flush the poison down the loo.
She returns to her room and sits on the window seat. There is no moon out tonight. Sheets of rain pelt the glass. There is no nightlight, so she keeps the light on in the closet.
Nana looks around too, then she nods towards the hall to Beebee's room. His door is open, but the loo shut. She starts to slide her hand away from Nana so she can wait outside the door, but Nana doesn't let go. Rosie frowns and looks at her and tugs her hand back.
Sherlock uses the edge of the sink to heave himself up, but his arms give out, and there's a moment of weightlessness and heart stopping fear when he catches a flash of overcast sky, and suddenly he is on his back. His head lolls to his shoulder, cheek pressed against the cold tile. He can see under the door into the hall.
"I-" Her voice catches in her throat.
Equilibrium arrives with an old friend.
The door opens and Lestrade is there. Sherlock prepares himself to be reprimanded, to be told to 'man the hell up' and face the consequences. But instead, Lestrade looks at him with a gentle gaze, with no judgement, no anger, only the need for understanding.
"How was she?"
Sherlock closes his eyes. There are times when he still searches for excuses. He saw the articles, remembers what John said - the death threats. Hatred chips away at his insides more than Sherlock cares to admit. But that would mean those eyes would smile and that silky soft voice would laugh and laugh forever in the dark.
Mr. Mycroft is the first one to speak to a doctor.
"Yes you can!" She squeezes her eyes shut and tears leak down her cheeks. He must still be angry with her. "Beebee, I'm sorry what... what I said. I'm really sorry."
Grandpa shakes his head.
Suddenly, a hand clasps the back of his neck. He flinches, but he recognizes Mycroft's plain aftershave. He turns and he is in his childhood bathroom, old claw footed bathtub and green tile floor to ceiling. Mummy's blue flannels hung on brass hooks. He sits on the edge of the tub, knees bloody and uniform dirty. Mycroft kneels with his sleeves rolled to his elbows in front of him, hand on his shoulder, and presses the flannel to Sherlock's knee.
She twists her head around to try and grab her Beebee again but he is gone. She turns to Uncle Greg and wriggles. She can usually get put down if she squirms enough, but he's got a tight hold on her this time. If she was bigger, she could punch him and make him put her down. But hitting is bad.
Not her, but the world. The world that had been so cruel as to take John Watson from him. But he
Her Grandma and Grandpa are here. Grandma's eyes get watery when Rosie hugs her.
She nods and holds the phone up for Mr. Mycroft. He takes it and turns his back, dismissing her.
Living is harder, so Sherlock is learning. So the dead have taught him for many years. It is easy to find a corpse in an alleyway, easy for them to be dissected, to find out what happened to them in death. There are so
Sherlock rips the flower chain. "It's easier than you think." After all, how easy was it for him to choose the needle over a child.
The eyes shimmer and shadows swallow the face, and the hands dissolve around Sherlock. Light breaks through the darkness. Sherlock reaches up towards it. He just has to swim.
"I don't like it."
"Uncle Myc says that too. So now I'm not allowed to have accidents."
Dr. Molly has to leave though. Her eyes and nose are pink, and she does not look at Mr. Mycroft. She kisses Rosie. "Bye-bye love. I'll see you soon."
He talks about Rosie for the first time.
"It may have been an accident," the doctor says.
He flinches back and grabs his hair. His fingers curl into claws and he shakes. He half turns from her and folds into himself.
And she falls on the floor and covers her eyes and screams and screams until she is sure Daddy can hear her in Heaven.
"You'll always end up here, with me." He rises from his seat. The tea cup tumbles from his hand and it smashes onto the floor. He steps over its remains. "It's okay though. We can be broken together."
Beebee rubs her head dry with the towel. "Don't you worry about me, my bumblebee."
But he remembers. And if Rosie remembers, then so must he.
His throat feels far too tight. "That's far more than I deserve from you."
The crack widens considerably in his chest. He wonders for a moment if she is merely mimicking Lestrade, that Bee-Bee is still in her vocabulary somewhere. But then he realizes that this was inevitable. Children learn to correct themselves when disapproval is met by authority.
Sherlock does not want to look at the corpse. He instead directs his gaze ahead, where Mycroft sits in the church pews below them. This is wrong. He shouldn't be here.
Sherlock watches the needle leave his skin, he can feel it sliding out of the hole torn through him. He brushes his thumb over the dollop of blood. It looks too red over his pale skin.
The rest shuffle up to the box one by one, and leave in the order they come. In the end, Rosie and her family are left.
, and he supposes he is, compared to the boy in front of him. He, after all, can remember a time when Walkmans were still popular. Luis barely has memory of dialup.
She's looking somewhere in the middle of the floor with a deep frown. "Why'd I... I dunno. I wouldn't do it for shits now would I?" She straightens up. "I tell you what I'd do. You see that surfer girl who got her arm bit off? She went back to surfing. She's quite good. You can do lots of things one handed." She looks down at her hand. Her cuticles are bright red from where she's chewed them. She flexes her fingers. "It's just a hand. Doesn't make me laugh. It doesn't know me. It writes. It texts. Helps me speak. Helps me open doors. But that's what the other hand is for."
That he could have a few at the bar and take her home on his arm for a night cap, too drunk to understand that she wasn't who he really wanted. That he could be satisfied with anyone other than him. But, as Sherlock is reminded amidst the mass of moving bodies, he is not normal. Something he has known since he was a child.
John winces and gets to his feet again. "Kind of pathetic."
He blinks, bringing Mycroft into focus. "
"Just - go to bed," he says softly. "I don't want to see you the rest of the night."
Sherlock walks them to the door, where the receptionist nurse buzzes them through.
"Thank you Greg," Sherlock says.
Jim pats his hand. "You should've killed yourself when I gave you the chance."
"What favor?"
Mycroft has dressed down. No suit jacket, and his vest is unbuttoned. Big Brother is not so informal as John though. Mycroft has not taken off his shoes in Sherlock's presence since they were children. Although, Mycroft never really was a child. Sherlock is convinced Mummy and Daddy found him fully dressed in a miniature suit in the dusty attic rather than actually birthing him.
Sherlock stabs his finger at him, only to lose his balance when his elbow slips off his knee. He grabs hold of the armrests and waits for the room to stop swaying.
He blinks slowly, feeling his breathing even out. He presses his palms into the cold floor. He wants to sink through it into the water below. He can hear it lapping at his toes.
"The groomer?" Song blurts.
He looks at the curtains, a small smile forming. Anything and everything that he could with her and John. He adored being part of her world, watching her grow from infancy, to a rage on two legs that refused to go down for her nap, to when he and John first took her to daycare. He was the emergency contact, should John not be available.
“Careful, careful…” the official droned, placating and in a condescending manner, “Do you really value your Keyblade over your ‘friend’?  Your dear Sherlock took a pretty bad beating, so not sure how much longer he’ll last.  Oh wait, I shouldn’t be surprised.  What else should have I expected from a pair of
“Kelley, excuse me for a minute…” Steve said apologetically before he looked over and gave a stern look at both Sherlock and Bucky in the background.
For Sherlock saw red, his knuckles turning white as they clenched into fists.
“Sorry.  Maybe I should shave…” Steve apologized.
“I’m not crying.
Grabbing both the bombs used on the two hostages, Sherlock yelled on his earpiece communicator, “Yo-Yo, quickly!  We have only a few seconds!”
He wasn’t going to cry.  He wasn’t going to cry in front of everybody.
No one spoke, although Anderson’s eyes were sparkling with delight as he thought of how much of a tizzy this was going to bring towards the Empty Hearse Club’s next meeting.
Sherlock pouted.
“What in tarnation - ?!” gasped the Sheriff as screams, yells, and chaos of the immense bedlam rang throughout the castle of Prince John seconds after the lightning bolts rained down from the skies above.
“I am a doctor, Sergeant Barnes.  I
Steve took no offense as he chuckled before rested his chin on Sherlock’s messy hair and said, “What can I say? I always wanted to dance with my hero.”
So did Steve, laughing softly, and despite their harrowing kidnapping and torture, it was a pleasant sound, easing all their souls and their fatigue, reminding Bucky and Sherlock that they both would have eagerly walked barefoot through hellfire for days if it meant that Steven and John could live to see another.
Both John and Steve looked over their shoulders to see Bucky putting Sherlock in a headlock, with the Consulting Detective reaching for the nearest blunt object (which happened to be a stapler) as Bucky continued to strangle him.
Meanwhile, watching from a hidden corner away from the Courtyard, Prince John finished vomiting the contents of his stomach at the sight of Bronx killing his second-in-command before apprehensively wiping the bile from his mouth, terrified and out of his mind with anxiety.
“Like a dog with two dicks, Hydra Bicycle!” Sherlock snapped, one eye starting to swell as he used his legs as leverage to wrap Bucky in a triangle-choke jiu-jitsu move from behind.
Instantly, the Heartless began to shudder, quivering as if going through a stroke, its yellow eyes even more wild and glassy than before as the protection enchantments began to weaken and fragment…
“I would like to, but I can’t.  Oh bloody hell, the Chief’s now trying to take it out on Sherlock.”
Oblivious to how deep he was in, Sherlock just blithely derided, “Astounding, you required less than an hour to actually arrive to the logical conclusion.  Well done.  It appears your elementary-school lessons with Captain America are showing a dramatic improvement.  Now, be less of a nuisance and kindly slither back to 221C.  You’re in my light and I would like to finish this article –
he carried them out was the most asinine and pompous…
Avenger who has close associations with the now defunct S.H.I.E.L.D?  At least
Nope.
Only to carelessly slip of a patch of ice, spread evenly in his path on top of the soil and grass sod before he crashed face-first into the ground, wounding his nose as coins scattered from the open sack everywhere.
Murdering all the guardsmen he could find wasn’t bad at all, really.
Mrs. Turner didn’t look like she agreed, especially when a microscope went crashing through one of the windows and out onto the street below, nearly hitting a taxi in its trajectory.
Sherlock tossed his over his shoulder to the crowd of single ladies, and it was caught by Molly Hooper to her gleeful and excited bliss.  Quite a few of the men around the area such as Dr. Banner, Kraglin the ex-Ravager, and a few of John Watson’ army friends perked up at the opening of the dazzling and gentle specialist in her yellow bridesmaid gown.
“Oh goodie!  God really
“Aw shucks, Goofy’ll do just fine.  Pleased to meetcha,” laughed the famous dog as he lowered his metal shield (with the emblem of Mickey Mouse) and offered out a pleasant and affable hand out to Lestrade.
It was the rage and fury that made Bucky forget all his martial and fighting skills, the years of army hand-to-hand and Hydra conditioning, that made him rowdily swing over and over at Sherlock’s torso, arms, shoulder and face.  The red haze over his eyes darkened each time Sherlock returned a blow, and Sherlock’s attempt to knee his nether-regions was off enough to make him gasp in relief, yet close enough to make him sweat.
“Elementary, chaps.  You are both correct.  The strange objects that you see before you are called Keyblades,” spoke out a small, refined voice, muted and almost as if uttered by a toddler.
shall assist him,” Mrs. Holmes said steely, hands on her hips as she stared down.
Wrestling on the grass, Robin Hood easily stabbed his opponent in the eye with his only arrow, causing the Heartless to immediately back off in pain as it clutched its face.  Leaping to his feet, the fox then swung his bow like a billy club, making a satisfying crack as the wooden weapon smacked across the imp’s face.  As the monster sank to the ground, Robin aimed and fired the arrow directly into the throat of another Heartless, where the armor was the weakest.
“I knew I should I have just joined the Crusades!  It would have been a lot quieter!”
Both Steven and John had to physically restrain Sherlock from using his microscope to bash an unrepentant Bucky’s skull in.
“…what is ‘Disney’?”
“What the hell?!” cried out an unnamed Detective Sergeant as the explosion rocked the National Gallery, actually causing bits of marble and stone to go flying out.  Sherlock spotted the fleeting image of one of the Heartless combusting in a terrific detonation of flame, causing one of the pillars of the museum to crumble deafeningly.  Sherlock’s eyes widened as he narrowed down the possibilities of the exact type of explosive being used from the estimation of the decibel level of the ringing blast wave, the damage radius of the scorch marks and the resultant gap amid the museum’s wall, and extensive damage that could crack pietra serena stonework in such a manner…
Sherlock Holmes, despite his injuries and the dried blood crusting over one of his eyes, immediately blinked repeatedly in Morse Code for John as he raised his head ever so slightly.
“STOP!”
Hydra base in England to approach?” Sherlock drawled snidely as the military aircraft left the runway, with several soldiers jumping up and down from the sidelines, hopping mad at the theft.  Mycroft just glared disapprovingly while Anthea just typed away idly on her phone next to him.
“We are gathered here today – oh what the hell, let’s just skip to the important crap and get to the part where if anyone has any objections to whether or not these four men should not get hitched.  Because I assure you that if
“Pretty sure I left bite marks, you liar…” John pointed out.
The wedding ceremony was simple, in front of a controlled number of guests within the sun-kissed Goldney Hall, with Mrs. Wanda Holmes and Mrs. Martha Hudson as the matrons of honor (Mrs. Hudson cried with joy when Bucky and Steve asked if she could act on their behalf).
John’s Keyblade was a stark contrast.  It was pale as the freshest snow, as beautiful as unadulterated marble and purer than the cleanest silver, without a scuff mark or a speck of dirt throughout the armament.  The blade was actually in the form of a broadsword, complete with an impressive blade, fuller portions and a central ridge and point at the top.  Yet at the mouth of the sword was a carved figure of a hedgehog, complete with the spiky hide, pointed nose, and beady eyes, proudly displaying on one side of the sword blade.  The impression of the hedgehog had sparkling eyes that shone like diamonds, so lifelike and bright.  Ironically, the weapon had a real cross-guard like any sword, except that it was composed of white metal precast and shaped as two Sig Sauer pistols, with the handles joined at rain-guard (stamped with a marble disc with the image of another roaring lion’s head) and the mouths of the pistols pointing outwards.  The grip of the Keyblade was well-worn leather, brown, tanned, but it felt so good in John’s palm, as if it were made especially for him.  And hanging from the end of the Keyblade, miraculously, were John’s army dogs tags.  But also with the tags and the fine chain of white was a white metal heart, the same exact design as the one on Sherlock’s.  Except that the right side of the heart was filled with black crystal.
shall drive!”
Amazingly, Sherlock felt a bit of heat underneath his collar as he whispered softly, “Er, John?  Are you…a bit…not good?”
in the mouth was a public service, you cheekbone cunt,” drawled Bucky nastily from the background, and not surprisingly, this led to another sniping match.
Sam pieced it together as he asked, frowning, “Wait…you’re having Steve and Sherlock solve cold cases?  On their honeymoon?”
Sherlock’s forehead touched John’s as he murmured, “Never.  A thousand times over, I will never be bored for a single second in my life as long as you spend it with me.  Even if it meant beekeeping in Sussex, it would still be a grand adventure with you by my side.”
“I have an idea…” Sherlock whispered as he and Bucky peeked around the corner from their vantage point of the roof.
,” Steve ordered.
One could almost hear the Ironside Sirens playing forebodingly in the background…
After all, no one really wants to kill someone with Chic’s “Le Freak” gauchely playing the background.
” John yelled before he willed his Keyblade and tossed it directly at Robin.  The fox smoothly caught the magical Talisman before placing it into his bow and loading the Keyblade as he would any arrow.  Despite the Keyblade appearing inefficiently oversized and awkward, to Robin, it just felt right, as if it was a natural fit due to the magic surrounding it.
“And the armory is flooded!” called out another burly rhinoceros.
John couldn’t help it.  The flashbacks were too vivid, too powerful.  The explosions reminded him of the searing heat from the roadside bombs that temporarily deafened the hearing in his right ear, the windy sands making the air dusty and difficult to breathe as he crawled amid wreckage and ducked gunfire to tend to his fallen comrades, the bullet ripping through the flesh and bone of his shoulder like wet paper, fracturing his soul and mind and sending bouts of crippling pain throughout his body.
“Oh God!” gasped Lestrade as he spotted one lone figure, on his hands and knees in the middle of the diminishing city square, transfixed and frozen.
“Asshole!”
The Sheriff screamed and screamed and screamed bone-chillingly in a high-pitched tone of terror as he feebly tried to push the heavy beast off him, his punches and knife doing inconsequential damage to Bronx’s tough hide.
Even injured and beaten within an inch of his life, Steven Roger’s voice was strong, authoritative, and unyielding.  Bucky and Sherlock quietened down.
"Bye-bye love," he whispers.
Sherlock blinks slowly, the tears drying on his cheeks, and stares into the flames. He curls into himself. Mycroft is right. Redbeard ran off because he didn't like Sherlock. He wasn't his real friend. Everyone at school hated him. Even when he thought he could have John, he was still meant to be alone.
"I've told them not to..." Uncle Greg keeps his voice low. "Anything you don't feel like doing, you know."
A bloody present. Sherlock will have to investigate once he gets out. Find out exactly what present his brother had used to wheedle his way into her good books, something he swore he would never let happen.
to be alone. That was the difference.
Only stupid people wet the bed when they're four years old.
in my house. Around our girl no less."
you darling. I was... I was so
"What are you doing here?" he sighs at the ceiling. He can see dancing patterns in the stains from past cigarettes. He could use a cigarette now. His gaze falls on the space next to the hearth. His slipper should be there. It's so far away though.
Sherlock does not want to go home.
Surely this is nothing more than genetics. He is as different to Mycroft as the British are to the French.
he frantically reminds himself. He struggles agains the hands around his throat.
He wants her gone. He's going to send her away and then she won't have anyone. It's all her fault.
Her hair has mostly grown back from the surgery on her skull, but she's still thin, and there are shadows in her cheeks that don't belong.
He doesn't expect her to answer. The heavy weight in his stomach lifts when she does. He is still not comfortable on the phone, but they talk for twenty minutes. He has never been good at talking to her about her more mundane interests, but it is good nevertheless to hear her voice. They ignore the more pressing issues, leaving that to a face to face meeting, which she agrees to more enthusiastically than he feels is necessary. He would prefer to text her, but he knows that will not be received well, nor address the issues properly.
"Uncle Greg gave it to me."
A pale, bloodless hand launches out, spraying Sherlock with red and black and latches around his neck before he can scream. His terror ratchets up as it pulls him to his knees and he manages to gulp in a breath just as he sinks below the surface. Down, down, down into the dark and cold.
He won't look at her. "Rosie, come on."
"You stay down there," Macintyre says with a grimace. "Keep your fag face away from us."
The Watson wedding ends without a hitch. One nearly murder, but Sherlock counts that as a success. Months of planning, of denying the Work, and he was not going to ruin this, nor let anyone else interrupt John's "biggest and most important day."
She traces a line on her drawing and shakes her head. Her silence, while not a protest, is unnerving.
She still feels sorry that she said she hated Daddy. He took away her favorite toy because she made a big mess in the kitchen. He put her in time-out and she couldn't have screen time for several days. She told him she didn't mean that she hated him, and Daddy said he forgave her. Hating wasn't unforgivable.
Just like the stages of grief, life will have its ups and its lowest downs.
The door won't open any wider. Something heavy is blocking it. She can fit her hand through the opening, and the first thing she sees are his bare feet. On the floor. She throws her shoulder against it, pushing hard and she hears Beebee groan.
Not a sound in their home. Even the cars outside have stopped. The only sounds are her heavy breaths because her chest is shrinking. Beebee's mouth twists and he wipes his hand across it. His shoulders slump and he wraps his arms around his middle. He looks so small and lost, like how she feels.
It doesn't matter what he feels about this, doesn't she understand?
The attendant gives him a look and hands him the note.
He blinks. "Tomorrow?"
I hope you all liked it. Comments are always appreciated.
Sherlock's head is too heavy to keep up now. He lets it rest against Jim's shoulder. His eyes search wildly for Mycroft, but logic has fled. Only his heart remains, bared raw for the empty room. Always empty. No one, not even Mycroft is allowed to be present with this part of himself. Because this part is shameful, and never allowed to see the light of day. In the dark, it is the only comfort he has.
"I'm sorry too. But you can't come home. Not until I'm well."
He looks, but he doesn't see. "I do."
999. She needs to call an ambliance.
Grandma looks very very cross.
Grandpa lets her lead him over to the soldier man. She hugs Beebee's leg.
He locks the bathroom door, just in case.
"I'm not!"
He is back in 221B. Soft leather presses into his back, and Jim, with his blank, dark eyes, smiles warmly from John's chair. He holds a tea cup to his lips. the firelight flickers off his face.
Lestrade's brows furrow. He rubs the back of his neck uncomfortably, then gently squeezes Sherlock's wrist in return.
She shoves as hard as she can. Her hands slap useless against his legs. "I don't want Molly," she screams. She beats him with her fists.
Days turn to night.
I love writing from the point of view of a child. Hopefully done right, it conveys the confusion of a world they are just starting to navigate, especially when confronted with such complicated events.
"Oi, you all right there?"
"I know," he nods. "But he needs alone time right now."
"Don't you see John? I clearly wasn't meant to be a person. I am adapting to nature and becoming an organism dependent solely upon my vegetating mind."
he deduces. Not uncommon for children who have been removed from their guardians.
He is so quiet, Rosie thinks he has hung up. But then, a mumbled, "Maybe," rattles through.
Sherlock grins, which turns into a giggle. "The dog's - excuse me -" he snorts, and composes himself. "The dog's owner was a very wealthy old woman with stage three cancer. After she died, all the money would go to her dog. The groomer had worked for her for nearly twelve years, with all her show dogs, and didn't feel he was adequately compensated." He smiles at the memory, feeling the cracks widen. "That was her first, and last case."
"You... you can't just yet. You have to stay with Mycroft. I-I can't take care of you right now."
Rosie has trouble sneaking now because the pink cast on her leg makes too much noise. Even now she thumps, thumps, thumps down the stairs in an awkward rhythm. She keeps both hands on the railing so she won't fall. She falls a lot because she gets dizzy and her head hurts and she can't see very well, but she's getting better. She can make it down the stairs by herself now.
"Damn you. Both of you."
"No. You're lucky. You're so lucky. If you had killed him, I swear to god you wouldn't have walked out of here alive. I swear."
"John, are you asking me if I'm a virgin? Honestly? Why are you suddenly so concerned with my love life anyway?"
How do you say? Vatican Cameos."
"Nearly eleven. Well, I guess I have to..."
"Yes, her... Oh. Didn't she tell you why she held such a personal grudge against you even before she met you? Her brother, Sebastian. Valuable part of the organisation. We were...
"Thank you, John."
. Human. And thanks to you I could be that, because to you I already was. You're a marvel, John.
Originally I wanted Moriarty to still be alive and recreate the waterfall scene from TAB, but then I noticed I didn't want John having to face the (legal) consequences of killing either Moriarty or Mary.
"John - I..."
"Ah yes, he actually very much can. You're going to be very disappointed by the solution to that mystery, it's breathtakingly simple. But you'll see for yourself soon. As for me, I guess you let your emotions get the better of you. You trusted John's judgement. But enough with the chit chat now. John, do stop loitering and come out, or I'm going to shoot your precious little detective."
"Thank you, Sherlock. That sounds... wonderful."
"John? What... What about him? What are you implying?"
always
"James? Major Sholto? But, surely you don't mean...? When you say - you were... with him...? You always say you're not..."
... You need a shave, too."
"Oh my god, John, calm down. You're lucky she's
Thank you, Mrs H.
"Yeah. Yeah, me too. Because then
"Sherlock, he won't always be there. Do you really think you could be enough for a man like him? He doesn't love you. Not like you think you love him. Do you really think he could want someone like you? Sooner or later, he'll tire of you. Of your moods, of your genius. He can't appreciate it. He'll leave you, for another woman most likely. He doesn't deserve you. He doesn't understand you. How could he?
Sure, Sherlock! Just give me a call at my office.
"Sherlock dear, close your pretty little mouth. It's unbecoming. Have you never heard of bullet proof vests and bags of fake blood? And with a little money you can buy anything, even fake paramedics.
"But... But who's...?"
"John, I was high. That dream I had didn't prove anything."
"Of course."
"Sherlock, they... Oh my god, no. No. I didn't know. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Sherlock I never should have said..."
Why is my "Mary" German you ask? Because I'm still confused as to why they made a point of Sherlock saying she's not British and then never came back to it. Also because I'm German and because Rosamund can easily be turned into the German Rosamunde and also just basically because I can. What is David doing here you ask? Because I'm still bitter that they introduced him like that and then never did anything with him. Originally I had Mary say that she wasn't sure who the father was, but then again I really wanted her to be John's.
"Here. This E-mail just came in."
"You never told me...?"
"Of course that was you. Creative."
"It's alright, Sherlock - she didn't wake up. I think you can stop playing now. Thank you for taking care of her."
"Really? Family life? Not... boring?"
"Yes. Yes, Sherlock. Of course I do. You are..."
"Yes she is - I mean, yes, I did but..."
"Then you're not bloody going."
"Oh god
"... How long? I mean... how long have you felt - have you been...?"
"You know nothing, Moriarty."
"John, I am sorry. I can only repeat that. When... when Mary shot you, and I thought you might... If that's what it felt like for you, when you thought I was... I'm so sorry, John. I didn't know. I'm so sorry I had to put you through that. But it had to be done. I saw no other way. I had to protect you. Moriarty was going to have you killed."
You told me once you weren't a hero, but you are. To me, you are. I'm so grateful that I got lucky enough to find you. I owe you so much. Without you, I don't know what would have become of me.
close if you know what I mean. But unfortunately he got himself killed. It was your fault, happened when you were in Serbia. That Mary wanted to take care of your John herself was a bit of a personal vendetta. She thought of taking it out on Mycroft too, sort of eye for eye, but he was too useful to us and not quite as important to you as your precious little doctor.
"I slept with David. Before we got married, and afterwards too for a bit. When Sherlock told me I was pregnant, I had no idea who the actual father was. But be at ease. I got her tested, she's yours."
After Mrs Hudson and I had taken care of him (and aired his room), Sherlock explained that he had been experimenting with an extract of from the root of some African plant called "The Devil's Foot" (it has some fancy Latin name too as Sherlock would tell you) for a case. The stuff can be vaporised by heat so it dissolves into the atmosphere, and if you inhale that it's pretty toxic. It causes hallucinations at first and if you're subjected to it for too long or use too much of it, it's deadly.
didn't need
"... Ah, Greg - finally! Would you please take this lady with you? I think attempted murder in at least two cases will do for now, and I'm sure you'll find some more ugly stuff if you dig a bit deeper. And I imagine this man might have a pretty interesting statement to give."
"... Her brother?"
"Yeah. You know, I like my detectives clean shaven."
"Mycroft tried to... comfort me. But well, you know Mycroft. He told me about how "caring is not an advantage", and that if you get to attached to something - or someone - it will only break you. And I believed him. So I tried to not let that happen again. Started to value logic higher than emotions. It was easier that way. It worked, most of the time. I could detach and protect myself. From... feelings. But now - with you, I don't need that anymore. With you I don't have to do that. After all, hearts are made to be broken. It's ok. You made me..."
"Try me, darling."
"Yeah. I guess it didn't mean much.
"Twin brother...? But - It's never twins!"
"They're from Serbia. The last parts of his network. I got captured."
"As a reminder. Of how dangerous emotions can be if you're not careful. Miss Adler is certainly... fascinating. We're very similar. But listen, John. Romantic entanglement, while fulfilling for some people..."
"When I came back I was... I was looking forward to seeing you so much. It was what kept me going while I was away. But... you were so angry and - Mary was there and I... You clearly didn't need me anymore. You seemed happy. How could I do anything but support that? How could I compete with that? How could I even think of coming in between that? You chose
"You're not - Sherlock, why the hell not? That's just stupid!"
"Yeah. Yeah, ok. I can do that."
Thanks, Mike! We owe you one :)
"No, I... I don't know. I guess... She made you happy. Or at least I thought so. So I trusted her. That was enough. I wanted you to be happy, John. I needed you to be."
"Yes, but it's fine. We have time now."
"And then there was you and suddenly everything was... lighter. Easy. Fun. Calm. Between you, and working with you, I didn't need the drugs anymore. I had the real thing. You were like my own personal sun shining through the clouds in my mind. My one fixed point. And you actually
"Tell you what, John?"
"Yes, ambulance - of course. Let me just get my phone... John - John no, no stay with me, please, oh my god. No, John. NO. You have to stay awake. Please, if I mean anything to you... Please don't leave me. You can't leave me now. You simply can't. I won't allow it. I can't lose you! I gave up my life for you, twice. I came
Harry, that's amazing! I'm very happy for you! :)
"What the hell is going on here?!"
"Wow. How bloody dramatic. What was that even for?! ... What time is it?"
I could never hate you, Sherlock. You know that, you have to know that! But I guess that
Anyways, how's Mary? I heard you also had a little encounter not too long ago."
"You really thought I had forgiven you, didn't you? I could have never trusted you again. Ever. You shot my best friend. You knew what I was like when I lost him the first time, and you risked putting me through that again, just for your own sake. And you never even tried to be even slightly honest with me. Do you know I looked at that bloody USB stick? It's empty."
"Yes, but I didn't want it to be true. I ignored it. I'm sorry, John."
"Seriously? You believe that? No. Never. Not for that. Not for shooting you. Not when she knew exactly what losing you a second time - for real - would do to me. Not when she did it for completely selfish reasons.
"Of course that's not Moriarty, Sherlock. I took over his part long ago. Jim's dead. He shot himself in the head, you were there. How could he possibly have survived that? He always was so awfully dramatic, loved a good act. But not that time, that was for real. He wanted to proof a point, always wanted to be one step ahead of you. I told him he should take me with him to that bloody rooftop, I would have thought of another solution. But you killed him. And my brother. I just wanted to see you dance one last time before finally killing you for good."
She tugs on Nana's sleeve. "Where's Beebee?" she says.
Rosie knows down to the tips of her toes that she hates the color black.
She huffs and pushes the plate away. She knows she is being stupid for wanting him back, but maybe if she says it often enough, then he will come home, or they will give her what she wants. They will give him back. She doesn't know who they are. Whoever decided to take him away.
Feel. Sherlock looks down so she won't see his eyes roll. Always
He wonders who dressed her. A closer look and he spots a missed button at the back of her neck. Either an elderly nanny, or someone who couldn't bother to care about her appearance.
But she is a child. She was once
"My daddy has a gun. I got to hold it. You're not supposed to ever point it at
Sherlock remembers her little voice, hurt, on the other end, hushed because Mycroft was certainly breathing down her neck the entire time.
She tilts her head to the side and looks at him funny.
He grabs something off the table and Rosie doesn't see it leave his hand because she squeezes her eyes shut, but she hears it
Just like home, there are too many people here. So many blurring faces in a sea of black.
"Did the bad guys hurt you?" She points, but then she remembers that pointing is rude, so she puts her hand down.
She squints with her good eye. "You don't look poorly."
Rosamund has been to the cemetery before. It was during the day, when the ghosts were all asleep. She and Daddy walked down a path to a black stone under a tree. Daddy said her mummy had passed away when Rosamund was a little baby, and that she was in Heaven. Rosie knows that her mummy is under the black stone, but her eyes got put in the sky. Daddy laid flowers on the black stone and Rosie set a card next to the flowers. It was a piece of pink construction paper from her daycare on which she had drawn a rainbow and a smiling sun. It's what Heaven is supposed to look like.
, and move on. But then again, she is four and a half.
Grandpa takes Rosie's hand. "Let's give them some privacy shall we?"
He was given a way out, but he couldn't leave John behind to deal with the rest of Moriarty's mess. But now, with the world safe once more, only Sherlock keeps Jim alive, for these exact reasons, after years of trying to erase him.
Her daddy, with his short graying hair and his dark coat, was pushing away his cart with a carton of milk and eggs. As if he hadn't been gone a day.
Sometimes Mycroft makes out 'Redbeard' amongst the ramblings. Sherlock's glazed eyes follow something Mycroft cannot see. He sinks back into the wonderland that frees him from he torments around him. Mycroft holds him closer. It comforts him to think that Sherlock is happier there.
That's all you needed.
At the very back of the crowd, Mr. Mycroft and Beebee stand. Mr. Mycroft looks bored, but Beebee looks like he will crumble. He looks lost.
It was a special day, because it was normal. Beebee has never liked the shops, so Rosie always went with Daddy or Nana. She helped push the buggy until it got too heavy.
Sherlock nods, swallowing the lump in his throat.
"No," Sherlock croaks. "Not like you."
She looks him up and down, and frowns at the wrist with his hospital tag. She looks back up, not quite meeting his eyes.
"But I have a doctor now, who is teaching me not to be sad anymore."
"In the end it was the groomer."
The little gardener heaves on the stem of his arm, dissolving into belly gulping laughs when her strength perseveres and he flops to the floor, having successfully been uprooted.
Uncle Greg grips his shoulder. "You'll let me know if you need to leave, yeah?"
Mycroft, eyes still icy, smiles. "Are you stupid?"
Sherlock has tried to be a good friend. Friends are "there" when others need them. Like Molly was there for Sherlock when he needed her. Like John was there for Sherlock.
The doppleganger's hands dissolve in the water, along with the rest of it, and Sherlock stares wide eyed at the remains of red and black that float towards him.
The doppleganger tilts its head. "It's like flying," it says in a rough version of Sherlock's voice.
Why won't Daddy just walk in through that door and make everyone go home? They would play doctor and he would say she doesn't have to wear the cast no more. He would kiss her eye better and magic heal it. And they would sit down and play cluedo with Nana, and Rosie would win because she is the best at that game. And Beebee would smile again.
He laughs. "I would, but Stella'd have my head if she knew I had another lady in my life."
Beebee looks away and his shaking hand grabs the bottle from the floor. He sways a bit when he stands, like he's on a boat, and drags his feet as he walks down the hall. Maybe he is going to get the smelly cleaning spray. She hears the door slam. And the house is quiet once more. He doesn't come back.
"I won't be staying," he says. He holds out the rose.
Sherlock snorts. "Is the infallible Scotland Yard not fairing well in my absence?"
"I did promise," Lestrade says.
"When?"
Sherlock strokes the neck of the violin. "John does." He doesn't know why, but he feels proud that he can name at least someone, while Mycroft cannot. Of course Mycroft would not see that as an achievement.
John sniffs and shoves his hands into his pockets. "That's all well and clever, but do I have to go to another funeral? I mean I did go to that fake one. Where you abandoned me."
He gave a shout of surprise, which meant he was there. He was really there! She was hugging him, even after everyone tried to tell her that he was gone. It would take a giant to pry her away. She made sure to grip him tight so he couldn't escape her and Beebee. He would finally smile when he saw who Rosie had found. He would smile for real!
It is her way of saying that he is still welcome in her home. That he still has a home.
He raises an eyebrow and looks like she just spoke french to him. She wrings her fingers together, feeling the butterflies in her tummy. She doesn't know how to explain. He's going to think she's stupid.
"We're... texting from time to time, yes. Listen, John, she's not who I..."
"What are you talking about?"
Happy belated Birthday, Sherlock darling. Congratulations on solving this one! I hope you liked my little present. I'm a bit disappointed John didn't mention it, but I assume you found the message I left in Johanna Oldacre's hideout. Miss me? You'll hear from me soon.
"Just so you know, it wasn't exactly a piece of cake for me either. You saw the scars on my back, when I was in hospital."
Then Sherlock had the glorious idea to make a fire in that exact hallway. He had figured out from the cut of the house and the shape of the room that Miss Oldacre, who had planned the house herself, had built in some secret hideout and wanted to lure her out by setting off the smoke alarms. What we did was not only to set off the smoke alarms but also nearly the house on fire because no one had bothered to check where the fire extinguishers were first. But well, in the end a still very much alive Johanna Oldacre came out of a little room behind a wall panel and admitted that she wanted to frame Jane McFarlane for her murder.
"Ah yes, she does. She's brilliant. So lovely and loyal. And very clever. She's the one who knows how to actually implement the things I come up with. Her brother was quite good too, but nothing compared to her really."
"Glad I could surprise you for once."
"That's - Thank you, John. For telling me that. I really didn't - I had never... I couldn't jump to conclusions without data..."
"Yes exactly, see, it's going to be fine. Ugh, but I am starting to feel a bit dizzy now. Must have lost more blood than I thought. Would you mind calling an ambulance after all?"
"How does this work then? Do you at least - I don't know, a... night of passion every other month or so? If you're not... Why did you want to keep her phone then, hm?"
"But... No. You? It can't be you. How? You're dead - you got shot... All that blood. No. How are you alive? Why...?"
In other news, I'm a father now. I have a daughter. Her name is Rosamund Katherine and she is just... wonderful, beautiful. Of course it's also exhausting, but it's really worth it.
I KNEW my efforts were not in vain in the end! Very happy for you two!
"Gay? Well, no. I'm not. You do know there is such a thing as bisexuality though?"
what I had in mind.)
got to dance with Sherlock properly. We're definitely going to do that more often in the future.) Greg was Sherlock's best man and Mike Stamford was mine. (Sherlock even remembered Greg's first name when asking him, but then I suspect he's always known.) I believe both Mycroft and Harry are still a bit pissed that we didn't pick them, but I do think at least Greg made up for it with Mycroft afterwards. ;) (Here I go again, most likely about to get myself stabbed with an umbrella next time I see Mycroft.)
"Oh, that's good. That's great. That's - When were you going to tell me?"
"John, can I...?"
"I can't believe... How did I get this lucky?"
"Thank you... Thank you so much... You have no idea what she..."
Yes, you heard right. Sherlock and I got married. On January 29th (the day we met at St Bart's, we decided we're going to celebrate that as our anniversary) we went to have dinner at Angelo's and had somehow both decided to propose (it was just a tad awkward, we basically both went down on one knee at the same time and sort of ended up sitting on the floor kissing). We wanted to tie the knot as soon as possible, after all we've waited much too long already and had no more time to waste. Which is also the reason why Sherlock wanted to get married promptly on Valentine's day (he is a romantic, no matter what he says).
"Shhh John, Rosie's just fallen asleep - Shhh, hey Bee, it's ok, it's just Daddy."
me, and wanted to be around me. You were impressed with me. You took care of me. Cared for me as a person. To you I wasn't just a "freak". You thought I was
"No, god no! I wasn't... I was just thinking of what Mycroft said..."
"It's fine. You need the rest more than I do. Besides, I'm happy to do it."
"Yes, of course it was. Johanna Oldacre wanted to disappear. "Dear Jim, will you fix it for me?" Remember? I'm back in business. But it was much more fun this way, getting little Jane to come to you for help. And remember Mortimer Tregennis? The "Devil's Foot"? Brilliant, wasn't it? Oh, and that bomb that should have blown up the parliament? That was my big come back project. Shame you had to ruin it, it would have been spectacular."
But most importantly, Sherlock and I finally took the time to talk. About everything that's happened - and about us, our relationship. And well, what can I say. We should have done that ages ago. Just this much: We're incredibly happy :)
Oh, and I haven't told you about our wedding gift to ourselves. Sherlock was talking to Janine at the reception and she told him how she had bought that cottage in Sussex a while ago and lived there for about a week before she got terribly bored. She had moved back to London straight away and was still looking for someone to buy the cottage. And well, Sherlock and I took it. Complete with bee hives and all. We're not moving there yet, not for a few years. We both love London too much for that. But sometime in the future, maybe before Rosie starts school, we're definitely going. It's absolutely marvellous there, we went to look at it a few days after the wedding. And once we move there, I'm also getting Sherlock a dog. We can't have one in the flat, but I definitely need to get my husband a dog someday.
"I know right? It's ridiculous. Yet, here we are. Good. Now, if you'll excuse me I'll just..."
slow. Do keep up. I thought you'd have figured it out by now. A long time ago actually. I work for him. Or with him rather. I started out working as a sniper for the organisation, but I've been his second in command for ages. Do you remember that letter with the pink phone? You said it was a woman's handwriting. That was me. And I was at the pool of course, I'm his best markswoman. What a show that was."
Beebee gives a twirl again and sways before collapsing back into his chair. He grabs another glass bottle and raises it to the space in front of him.
"Hand me back to Mycroft now?"
Mycroft frowns and stands to his full height, miles and miles above Sherlock. He throws the flannel back into the sink and shakes his head. "What a stupid little boy."
He groans, like he's hurt. He needs help.
Every bad feeling is narrowed down to the adult in front of her. That he won't play pretend. That nothing is normal anymore. That the stupid driver ran through the light. But she can't hate the entire world right now, that just seems like too much for her. But her Beebee happens to be in the same room.
Beebee nods while looking at the floor. Rosie looks too to see if there is something there.
They turned the aisle to the cereals, and there he was. Her father, in the flesh, with his back turned to them. Maybe it was because they were doing something normal so he could come back. Suddenly the world felt right side up again. Rosie felt frozen and terrified and relieved all at once. She never thought it was possible to feel so many big things after so long of blankness.
She turns away from Mr. Mycroft. "Then can you come get me?" she whispers.
Of course Mycroft would think that. Every favor came to him wrapped up with an expensive price tag hanging off the bow. Right and wrong had no jurisdiction, only if one paid more and if it was important enough for him to intervene.
She tiptoes down the hall. Listening for him.
But the door remains shut, and thus he passes another night in Ward 12. His eyes are now tinged pink from sleepless nights rather than the pink of self medication.
"So what d'you think?"
John had altered his entire world into an unfamiliar territory where he forgot what it was like to be alone. His doctor had inserted himself into his life and memories, part of his beating heart.
The syringe clatters to the floor.
"There is no pudding." He gestures with his fork. "Eat your pasta."
"Visitor's - "
Song hands him a tissue. He presses it to his eyes and sits there shaking. Eventually he calms down enough to wipe his eyes and nose. He tucks the tissue into his pocket.
They keep their voices low so Rosie has to listen hard.
Sherlock drags his feet into the kitchen and glares at the back of Mycroft's thinning head poking up from John's chair. Premature balding set in at twenty five. It's a wonder he hasn't lost all his hair at this point.
Song leans forward slightly. "There's a difference between knowing someone is dead, and accepting it, and dealing with it in a healthy way. That is what this," she gestures vaguely between them, "is about. Helping you move forward to acceptance."
Then, a gentle voice, "Would you like to talk, Mr. Holmes?"
This was the exact reason why a wedding was a stupid ceremony. Best Man: origin/ Germany 16th century - Not only was it just another tradition to add to the plentiful that symbolizes society's obsession with celebrating love, but a man was almost murdered. That, in itself, should be plenty of reasons to never marry.
He picks her up when he stands, and this high, she should be able to look in the mirror above the mantel, but just like Daddy's chair, it was gone when she came home. She asked Beebee why, and he told her that it got broke. Beebee doesn't lie to her, but she knows there is something spicious about the mirror's disappearance, because the one in the loo is gone too. Spicious is the word that Uncle Greg uses when he's talking about something that seems out of the ordinary.
and John's forehead is covered in blood and Sherlock is falling. There is a moment of panic, and the air rushes out of him. He reaches out for John's hand, but he is gone when Sherlock hits the ground.
in descending into an apathetic stupor.
Through his blurring vision, Sherlock sees Mary Morstan swaying in front of the coffee table. He was quite certain he locked that door, and yet here she stands.
She didn't mean it.
Lots of people say goodbye to the black box. Grandma leads Rosie to the front and together they lay flowers on the headstone.
Sherlock, still retaining a semblance of gentlemancy in this luney house, walks with her to the exit when their hour is up. He takes advantage of the rare sunny day, and walks through the garden.
"That's... very smart of him to teach you that." He looks away from her.
"I told you - I TOLD you - what a danger night looks like!" Mr. Mycroft is almost yelling now. "You
Muffled coughing. He sounds sick.
Mummy's stone looks the same as it did before, maybe a a bit dirty from rain and leaves, but her name is still in bright gold letters.
Crime scenes were strictly off limits, but they played detective sometimes on his days off and he showed her how he solved a crime, censoring some of the more grisly ones. It was a game she adored, especially if she could solve a case with him.
Dr. Molly, in her black dress, carries a pot of something steamy and it smells good, but now this is getting out of hand. Why is Dr. Molly wearing black? Rosamund is truly starting to hate - H-A-T-E - the color black. Daddy always tells her that HATE is a big word. He says it is okay to have big emotions. He gets big emotions too. But Rosie has to think about them before she says something that she cannot take back. Someone might get their feelings hurt.
