“Easy there,” Brock holds one hand out in front of him. “I won’t hurt you.”
“Then why did you...he never said why you left.”
James nods his head slowly and Steve scoops him up in his arms and carries him over to where the rest of the family are situated. Tony glances up, smiling at his mate and then at his oldest son.
“Yes! God, Tony, I love you so much! I thought you were different. I thought you weren’t like…”
“What are you doing, Tones?” Rhodey asks, his voice soft and showing a hint of sadness.
Tony’s knot eventually softens and he carefully pulls out. He keeps himself pressed up against Steve, his arms wrapped around his mate. Steve turns until he’s facing Tony, and he smiles.
Hanging up the shield was Steve’s idea. The duration of his hiatus was unknown. Perhaps one day he’d go back to being Captain America, but for right now he was content with just being Steve and a full time father. He had missed so much of Morgan’s life and he couldn’t bear to miss another second.
This alpha at least has the sense to fight his urge and let Steve go. The water shuts off and a towel is thrown at the omega.
Bucky waves Steve off. “Don’t mention it. I love that little guy. And seriously, talk to Tony. Trust me on this one.”
The sound of laughter fills his ears the moment Peter steps into the kitchen, and he smiles at the scene of his Uncle Sam and Bucky lost in another banter. He leans against the entryway of the kitchen, watching them act like a couple of children. It was just like old times.
“I knew it.” Natasha smirks.
“They haven’t,” Steve says and brings the car seat over to the sofas, setting it down on the floor and sitting down in front of it. He scoots closer to the edge of his seat to adjust the blanket around his son, smiling softly when Peter stirs and yawns.
With furrowed brows Peter glances around, searching for the source. He expected another video to be playing, but when he finds the screen blank, he realizes the audio is from what sounds like a voicemail.
“We found the hostages. Any luck with those weapons?”
“Hey, Cap. Long time no see.”
“Is this…” Peter trails off, eyes going wide when he pulls out his suit. He smiles wildly and runs a hand over the red and blue fabric. “Wow this is…”
“I promise.”
“I’ll take over tonight.” Natasha volunteers just like Steve knew she would.
“You didn’t. Not really.”
“Well you’ve been promoted and now you get to keep my mate and son safe. Don’t screw up or you're fired.”
“You okay?” Steve asks, giving up on his own meal to check up on his son.
“It was an accident. I’m not going to punish you. I’m not him, Steve.”
“Did something happen?”
The oldest looks to be about five years of age. His dark hair is askew and his blue eyes full of fear. Beside him is another little boy, no more than three-years-old, with messy blond hair and blue eyes like the older pup. In the older boy’s arms is a smaller pup with golden hair.
“I’m sorry. My intention wasn’t to hurt you,” Tony says first.
I can't wait to post the next chapter. Tony finally learns more about that last mission ;)
“Why? It doesn’t affect him,” Peter grumbles and rises to his feet, taking a step away from his bed and running a hand through his hair. “This isn’t about him! It’s about me!”
Pepper nods. “Yes. Yes, I accept. It’s just...are you sure? This is your baby and-”
“I’ll walk you out,” Peter says and Tony follows, making sure to give Natasha a little wave on his way out. She doesn’t wave back.
“I’m not saying that,” Steve says, making sure his voice is calm. He doesn’t want to set Tony off. “I’m just saying maybe it’s time to get...different clothes. Something more comfortable.”
Steve sighs and he starts the car. They drive in silence the rest of the way home. Tony keeps his head toward the window and hands in his lap. One hand finds its way to his middle. The movement catches Steve’s attention and he glances in Tony’s direction, smiling softly at the scene.
Peter’s cries rise in volume.
That inner voice is quick to remind Tony that the Steve that came home from the hospital was a completely different person. Tony doesn’t listen. Steve was just tired, that was all. He went through so much to bring Morgan into the world, something Tony couldn’t relate to.
Their last day in their apartment is bittersweet. It’s almost unrecognizable with the array of piled boxes that litter the once put together space. They had made this place their home, but now they had a new home waiting for them. They’d build it from the ground up, just like they had done before.
Tony wants to talk about yesterday, but he holds off. The last thing he wants to do is push for a conversation Steve might not be willing to have at the moment.
Sergeant Barnes was currently back in DC under SHIELD's care. He had been abused for years under Hydra's control. Tony wasn’t sure what he thought about him, especially once he learned the truth about his parents and the affiliation Barnes had with them. It wasn’t until he learned of the brainwashing did he ease off. It wasn’t like Barnes could help what he did, but Tony was still wary.
“Hello?”
“Why are you snippy?”
“I need to move him. He can’t sleep here again,” she says. Peter has refused to sleep in his own bed; he won’t even step foot in his apartment. She doesn’t blame him.
After he’s done, Peter leans back against the wall of the stall and takes a moment to catch his breath. He runs his hands through his hair, not caring if he makes it messy.
The rest of the party goes smoothly. Steve does his best not to let his anxiety get in the way and ruin a special occasion. Just as he suspected, his son wakes up and starts moving after Steve helps himself to a slice of cake. Natasha is closest and gets to be the first-technically second- to feel the baby’s little pushes and kicks.
Peter giggles. “I guess it worked.”
And maybe one day Peter would get to meet his dad. Peter has asked a few times over the years about his other father, and initially Steve struggled to properly explain the situation. Eventually Peter got older and stopped asking. He knew the topic was difficult and confusing to understand.
Tony nods in agreement. Death did suck. It likes to lurk in the shadows, waiting for the right time to strike. Of course there was no such thing as the right time. Death will appear whether you’re ready for it or not. There’s barely any warning and if you’re lucky enough to get one, you beg and pray that you’re granted more time.
“You have my word.” Tony promises.
“It’s okay. Um...I wasn’t in heat but...I’m worried that maybe I could be…”
Rollins follows with the whimpering pup and gestures to the rest of their men. Steve doesn’t fight this time when hands are on him again and forces him to his feet. He complies just like he said he would.
“Pete can wait! The Spider-Man thing-”
Steve frowns but continues to sip the tea anyway. Tony hands him the vitamins and Steve takes them without a fight. Tony hides his pleased grin behind his coffee cup.
“Maybe,” Tony mumbles and brings the glass back up to his lips to take another small sip. “What about you?” He asks and Steve stares at him quizzically. “We were trying to get you pregnant. I don’t see you puking your guts out.”
“It’s not a problem. Wake me up every time he’s up if you have to. I want to help.”
“Alright!” Steve snaps, throwing the blankets off in frustration and sitting up. “Give her to me.”
“Yes! Feels so good!” Steve increases his pace until he’s bouncing in Tony’s lap, curses and moans spilling from his lip every time his prostate is stimulated. Steve whimpers and tugs his bottom lip between his teeth, eyes screwing shut from the intense pleasure coursing through his body. He never knew mating could feel like this.
“Hey, come here.” Steve lifts Harley into his arms and hugs him tightly. “You’re okay. He’s just playing.”
He missed everything about his old life. He missed his best friend; he missed the trouble they would get into. It was always Steve getting into the trouble, but it had been Bucky coming to his rescue. It had always been Bucky.
Peter ignores the question and pushes Ned down on his bed. “You’re gonna wanna sit for this one.”
Tony scoffs. “Right. Because keeping us trapped in those tiny rooms-”
Flash scoffs. “You mean with the scary bodyguard and even scarier Tony Stark? No thanks.”
“You’re always making it about you. Have you ever thought to find out how I’m feeling?”
Bruce smiles. “It’s your alpha side. You want to protect your mate and pup.”
“Yes! Yes, fuck, Tony!” Steve cries out when each thrust hits his prostate, and he writhes, fighting against the cuffs keeping him in place. The bed frame creaks in protest, threatening to give out.
Natasha smiles. “I figured. You’re his hero.”
“I never said-”
“Are you done?” Rhodey questions. “We can talk if you’re done. I’m not doing this with you, Tony. I’m tired of seeing you this way. All you ever do is beat yourself down.”
It wasn’t just the words he was saying, but just hearing him in general. Tony would never get to hear his voice live again.
But those words echo in his mind. No one cared about him. No one loved him.
“I’m afraid to answer it,” Peter replies. He takes a breath, hating how shaking it comes out. “What if he’s-”
“And a third.”
There should be a sense of excitement at the thought of getting to see his child for the first time, but Peter can’t seem to grasp any form of excitement over the doctor's appointment.
Steve nods his head honestly.
Steve doesn’t know if she really does. He didn’t know much about her but he knew that she didn’t have any pups of her own. Or maybe she did. Maybe she had her own children to take care of and help run Tony’s company. It would be a lot but she seemed like the type to do it, omega or not. This was a new world and here omega’s could be anything. She was proof of that.
He still didn’t know if he wanted to keep the baby or not. Right now he was leaning toward adoption and giving the baby to a good, loving home. He could never provide for the baby, not when he was a kid himself.
“Have you been here?” Peter asks as he rises to his feet and brushes the dirt from his jeans.
Steve pulls out and collapses beside Tony, panting heavily as he tries to regain his breathing. “How was that?” he asks, turning to Tony for approval. Tony can only give him a thumbs up in response. Steve chuckles and rolls over onto his side, propping his head up on one arm. “Feeling better?”
“Language. It’s something Papa used to say if any of us cursed. I don’t know if he...never mind. Yeah. Yeah I understand.”
Tony smiles and rises to his feet, opening his arms for Steve to pass him their son. Peter jerks once he’s moved, both parents holding their breath as they prepare for more crying. But Peter remains asleep, yawning once and curling up against Tony’s chest, enjoying the warmth he provides.
Steve nods his head and calls the number.
Tony gives a small shrug in response. “It’s my day off.”
“Try having a baby and get back to me.” Steve’s tone is bitter and tight. The last thing Tony intended was to anger him and start an argument.
This little family is going to get their happy ending. They deserve it after all of this. Thank you so much for reading! ❤️
“Shit. Can I talk to him?”
“I know. Why didn’t you tell us?”
Steve senses his son’s nervousness instantly. If he wouldn’t have discovered the truth than he would’ve just assumed that Peter was anxious about homework or a big test. But now he knows the nervous energy is because he doesn’t want anyone to know his secret. Steve can relate.
Tony jumps out of his seat and steps out of the room, closing the door behind him.
“It doesn’t matter,” Sam says. “Do you want to stay with Bucky and I or…”
“Talk to me,” Tony urges softly, “what’s going on in that pretty head of yours?”
Peter turns away when his eyes fill with tears. A sob builds in his chest and he tries his hardest to fight it. He can’t cry again. He’s supposed to be strong.
Jarvis has already allowed Happy entry and the beta is lingering around the foyer. Steve sniffs the air, finding that Happy’s scent is pleasant. Maybe they’d be able to share a few words.
The sound of footsteps reach his ears and Tony turns toward the noise, not surprised to find Natasha lingering behind him. She glances at him for a second before making her way toward the tiny kitchen and rummaging through the fridge.
Steve buys the test and smiles brightly at the two pink lines.
“Fine,” Steve repeats the same lie. “Excited, actually. Pete’s coming and...I’m a little nervous.”
“I hate you.”
Morgan is getting bigger and smarter every day. It’s a shame Steve isn’t there to see it all. Tony hates being separated, but he hates the separation Morgan has to deal with. Steve was the first person she met; his voice was the first voice she’d heard. It was the sound of his heartbeat that lulled her to sleep. She needed him more than anyone.
“Shit. That’s due!”
“Anyway, let me make it up to you. You must be freezing. Take my coat.” Tony slips off his coat and offers it to Steve. The omega is still hesitant to take the offering. Tony does the honors and slips it around Steve’s broad shoulders.
“Hey, Pep, I’m sorry. It’s been a little...I don’t want to say crazy but-”
“There you are.” Tony lifts his head when Steve enters the room. “You missed Pete spewing milk everywhere. Kid doesn’t appreciate anything I give him.”
Natasha hums and continues to coax the newborn into calmness. “Can I hold her? Maybe she’s tired of you.”
“Are you okay?” Steve carefully pulls Tony to his feet and the alpha nods.
“No,” Peter shakes his head. “You can be Captain America.”
“Like time travel? Awesome!”
“Of course. I have a son. Though I’m hoping he takes after you.”
That captures Steve’s attention. “Oh?”
Steve ignores the apology and climbs out of bed, dressing quickly and storming off toward the door.
“It is your tower…”
Steve sighs sadly and leaves to say goodbye to the pups.
“No need to thank me. I told you I’m here for you,” Natasha says rubbing his arm up and down.
“You okay?” Tony asks on the other end.
“Is it? Maybe it’s right. Maybe I can’t do this. Maybe I shouldn’t.”
Their last stop is the communal living area. It’s a place Peter’s visited before, but another visit wouldn’t hurt. It was most likely going to be a spot Peter was going to spend a lot of his time in down the road. This is where the team gathered; it was their family space. Peter was part of their family now.
There will be another time skip in the next chapter! Thank you so much for reading!
“Don’t.” Tony warns when Steve reaches out for him. “Leave me alone.”
Now he had even more added to his guilt.
Peter steps away and shoves the photo back into his pocket and watches as Flash gets in the car and drives off. He crosses his fingers and hopes he does see Flash later.
"If you won't accept that I'm concerned because I care, just...think of me as concerned because I'm a doctor," he said tiredly. “Not a medical doctor, but still.”
Wade squeezed him tight, grinning at Peter and pointing at Matt’s back where he couldn’t see. He was mouthing something. ‘OMG’ was Peter guess.
Oh, right. The tackle box. Tossing back his second cup of coffee, he left the mug there and peeked into the hall to make sure Bruce wasn’t on his way back yet.
That kind of reaction pretty much answered Clint’s question and he wasn’t sure what to do with that. Bruce liked HIM? The walking disaster that was Clint Barton was an acquired taste. Watching Bruce, he dimmed his smile and tried to look offended.
"Me? What d-does he w-want with me?" Cap asked.
“I could have just killed someone, Clint. I think I’m done with the bow and arrows for tonight,” he muttered.
"Y-you mean he didn't already torture you...?" Pepper looked at him scuffed up wearing only his pants dubiously.
He was pretty sure Thor could just make it stormy when it wasn't before, not change the weather to whatever he wanted. It was nicer to imagine a quick fix to the situation than to accept the truth, though—he and Cap were stranded on this sandbar until things calmed down.
“Are we there YET?” Clint howled, flopping out of view of the rear view mirror. “I’m so ready for tequila!”
Turning to Clint, Tony smiled and reached to pat his shoulder.
Stepping under Thor’s arm, the woman seemed very happy to go with him.
“Whoa, hey! Oh thank god! Somebody is still left in the world!” Wade chattered happily, capturing Clint in a big hug.
"Don't. You'll o-open stitches."
Matt shook his head.
“Get a name,” Cap whispered to Tony in passing. “Even if it’s just a normal name, maybe we can use Jarvis to narrow it down with what secret identities we DO know.”
"Take care of Tony—and DON'T let him plug back into the power." With that, she stepped out into the hallway. JARVIS in glove form went hovering after, and the door closed behind them with an ominous slam, leaving Tony and Steve with the Arc reactor for light.
Peter sipped his root beer to try and hide the look on his face. Sooo, Cap supposedly kept out of Tony's private life, but had also argued with him about it. If that didn't sound an 'I'm done, we're broken up for good,' Peter wasn't sure what did. Although, if Tony still saw all of those models, talk about being a cheater.
Frowning, Wade circled back to him, propping both hands on his hips.
“Loki?” Cap came charging back from the woods, shield glinting in the fire light.
"You should take a hot bath." Peter peeked around the edge of the kitchen door, trying to see who was talking.
Steve came over to Tony, kneeling next to him. He examined his chest, eyeing the wad of cords leading out of it.
"You were the one who said I had to stop moving around, but now you're taking me with you?" The blond grumbled, trying to act like he wasn't nervous from the storm outside. Though Thor hadn't seen through his disguise the first time, so it was very unlikely he would any time after that.
The police were cleaning up the mess that the Hulk had made and Spider-Man was relieved to not be bothered by Deadpool for once. Maybe he did go back to Detroit/Dallas?
“Captain, Stark!” Thor called, waving to them from the campfire ring. As they got closer, Steve realized that the campfire was lit and a messy-haired brunette was sitting beside it, bundled in a big blanket.
“That’d suck,” he told Bruce as he started on the backs of the other man’s arms. “Cap’s a better catch than Tony could dream of.”
Shaking himself from his thoughts, Clint sat up and gestured to the first aid kit.
Clint couldn’t point fingers. His backpack didn’t even have any food in it. He’d brought along a bunch of different arrowheads, a grappling hook, a hammock and a bunch of other stuff that he obviously wasn’t going to get a chance to use.
Matt stayed quiet, taking a very ominous sip from his coffee cup and frowning off into space.
"Yep, that's either the Hulk or Godzilla they're running from," Spider-Man told himself. He had a habit of talking to himself when he was in the suit, primarily because he worked alone so much that there really wasn't anybody else to talk to.
“Hey, hey,” Clint said. “We can’t strand them too far out. What if the storm rolls back in?”
Hawkeye was still staring at his double, this time frowning. He circled out away from the door, looking Clint up and down. The other blond just raised an eyebrow at him, a hand pressed to his bandaged side.
“That’s not…exactly the case. I’ll let him talk to you about it later,” he said, the amusement clear in his tone. It was rare to see the guy in this good of a mood, and kissing Clint was the reason. Way to make a guy feel warm and fuzzy.
Tony glanced quickly at Steve to see what he said to that.
Maybe he was just tired enough to be loopy, but Bruce actually placed a hand on Clint's shoulder in return, leaving their arms almost linked, and replied in a calming tone, "We're not going anywhere, Clint."
"We buy, then retreat to the stars!" He made a large sweeping motion to the building tops. "And I get to watch you put a wiener in your mouth." The merc snickered, poking Peter's cheek.
"We will," Thor said confidently. "Tell me, would he keep moving or stay if he transformed back to Banner?"
"I'm sure he knows. That's why he's hiding." Clint looked around for anything that might actually be a camera.
"WOOOO! I need a webby thingy, man!" Deadpool cheered as they swung, waving the two hotdogs above his head.
Focus and find Wade, he reminded himself, looking at the sea of faces. How many people was Loki camping with? It looked like a couple bus loads full.
"Your manners are appalling," he informed Clint, crossing his arms. "Is there something you forgot to confess to me before...?"
“Can we maybe focus on the bigger, greener problem, here?” Tony asked, looking irritated. “Matt’s just a normal human guy—and he trusts the Avengers as the good kind of super powered people! We’re responsible for his safety while he’s camping with us. Bruce, whatever’s going on with you, we’ve gotta work it out before anybody winds up dead. I’m not kidding around, here.”
Without further comment, Daredevil ducked out of the room and shut the door behind him. Cap paced to the door and then faced Tony again.
"Clint, your face is bleeding." Bruce pulled himself onto the rock quickly and turned to offer both hands down to Clint. "Here, come on."
Clint wiped his hair out of his face, too.
“We’re done with Bruce,” Cap said, giving Clint a hurt frown. “Let me look at your arm.”
"Not from inside the cell," Tony insisted.
One of those moody shadows happened to be hovering over the three of them at that moment, casting both Cap and Tony in ominous lighting.
“Real soon! Bye bye, smoochies!” Wade cooed, hanging up. As soon as the call ended, Peter got a short text from Wade with a kissy face and a…palm tree?
“Wow,” Tony heard Steve breath from behind him. He turned and found the captain looking over the couches curiously, cooler clutched to his chest. Stepping past him, Cap ducked into the kitchen and sat the cooler on the counter before he peeked in the fridge. There was a rustling sound, then Steve turned back to him and smiled, raising up a bunch of leafy greens in one hand. “It came with kale. Impressive.”
“…So I started wearing a cape!”
"I think it's rainbow sherbet," Bruce mused, looking at the ice-cream closely. The colorful ice-cream was sandwiched between two mint green cookies, which was funny, Bruce going for the green food. Had he done that on purpose?
"Wow, he actually found you," the billionaire said, chuckling. "C'mon in, you guys, make yourselves at home."
“As tempting an offer as that is, I don’t want to intrude.”
Mind-control? Brain washing? Stockholm syndrome?
Cap sighed.
Cap jumped up, hauling Tony to his feet.
Loki backed away from Bruce, eyes wide with fear. No, no. No monster while he was injured.
They had set up on a grassy ledge just above the lake, surrounded by fluffy trees and bushes. It provided a nice view of the lake and a bit of privacy, which made for a rather romantic sunset setting.
"I think that doof loves everybody. You too, Bruce. He loves you too," Loki told him adamantly. Thor was full of love and was far too willing to throw it at others, even Loki himself.
"Y-you really kissed the Hulk?" Bruce asked quietly, smiling despite himself. "No wonder he's embarrassed."
The blond nodded.
Bruce chuckled, shaking his head.
If they weren't, though, Peter had a plan.
"If you lock me in a cell, so help me god—I'm gonna shoot you when I get out,” Clint exclaimed loudly, pointing between the two of them.
"...Spider-Man's psychotic partner, Deadpool." Peter Parker only caught those last few words as he swung past the massive screen in front of the Daily Bugle.
"Yeah. You only get a few days a month to do what you want and I'm pretty sure sitting around in the pouring rain for sandwiches isn't it." He gestured back to the shop. "I'll just come back some other time." Clint sighed in defeat.
“I-I,” Wade stammered, wiping water from his hair as he calmed down, “I went out to check the kayaks to see if Thor was there, but he wasn’t. His hot girlfriend wasn’t, either. Bugs went to check the other cabin, so…” Seconds passed and then Wade held up a finger like he’d had a brilliant idea. “He must be in the other cabin!”
Bruce looked up at Cap uneasily, staying where he was sitting on the floor.
Looking a bit stunned, Cap leaned to examine the wound before turning his gaze to Wade’s face.
"Me?" The Clint in the black tee asked, suddenly not so eager. "Why not him?"
Deadpool loosened his grip.
Steve turned back to him, blue eyes catching the glow from the reactor.
"I wouldn't put it past Doom—or Loki," Hawkeye grumbled. "But my bet's on Doom. He really wants Thor for some reason, so maybe this is part of his plan. Get him off by himself, lock us in the mansion, and bam, thunder god buffet."
"What happened?" He tried to get up, but quickly decided against it. Turning to glance at Clint, he raised an eyebrow suspiciously. "D-did you have anything t-to do with this?"
Hugging around his neck with one arm, Tony tried not to be distracted by the gorgeous blond being pressed against him.
So, Bruce was in a bad mood. Wonderful.
“What?” Cap asked, not looking back this time. “Are we going the wrong way? I can see that big rock on the map from here. I figured we’d plant a flag there and then hit the sand bar next, since it’s so far out.”
“Oh excuse me! I think I’m a bit lost!”
Bruce was used to smart people. Someone he could have a conversation with about…smart things. There was no way Clint had a chance at being smart or APPEARING to be smart, so he’d have to use something else.
Steve watched it happen too, frowning against the wind and rain.
He and Tony had been close for so long, getting engaged right after they were going steady felt very natural. They’d only been together for a short month before he’d realized that he couldn’t imagine a future without Tony.
Bruce blinked a few times and just looked at him, trying to figure out how to respond. After a moment, he drew a deep breath and hurriedly shrugged out from under Loki's arm, climbing off of the couch and crossing the room to the briefcase. There he appeared to be rearranging the items inside; Loki couldn't really see what they were.
In a squish of magic, Loki vanished into thin air.
“You want me to, uh, get your back?” He offered, glancing hopefully at Bruce.
"I should ask you the same about whether you do whatever a 'donutstravaganza' is!"
“…I’m new to this truth thing, but I feel like I’m getting mixed signals here,” the tall man whispered, scratching his head.
“I…see,” Cap said with a nod to Bruce. “I guess he must have wanted to make Tony jealous, then. I’m sorry you were caught up in all that. Jealousy doesn’t seem like the best foundation for a relationship. Then again, what do I know,” he mumbled, frowning at the waves bubbling near their feet.
"Banner waits for YEARS—it doesn't make him ANGRY!"
“Peter?” A voice called from far off. Hurried footsteps followed and a moment later, Cap came charging around the trees. Steve hurried to help Peter up and started checking him over. “We’ve been looking for you for hours! Are you alright? What happened?”
"You sure? I don't want to come back to check on you and find you collapsed on the floor three feet from the bed," he said drolly.
"It was wrong to tie you up. I shouldn't have let him. Sorry.” Bruce didn’t turn to look at him.
“Well...whoops."
"Yeah, who else right?" Torch sped off toward the mansion, alarming passersby on the ground as he wavered down to the street and then up over the building tops. It was definitely on purpose. "Hey, I heard you were teaming up with Deadpool. I thought you guys were rivals or something?"
Tony gave Cap a glance. That had kind of been what he'd meant by giving Peter some credit, but he had to admit, the situation didn't look great if Wade really was Deadpool. 'Awful things' was putting it lightly about what people said about Deadpool. Great, if Wade really was the boyfriend like they'd suspected...
Steve turned back to him.
"Clint and Banner are right here," Tony commented, pointing at the two as they hurried past them. He was sure he'd gotten some confused looks in return, but whatever. Tony trailed after Cap as they reached the cabin and stepped inside. "Something's not right, here. He doesn't even look like a college guy, unless he's some sort of body builder."
Stepping very intentionally between Bruce and Tony, Cap actually looked nervous all of a sudden.
"Have you l-looked at th-that handkerchief yet?"
"Yeah, hi... Nice Spidey shorts," he said meaningfully. Did this guy know Peter was Spider-Man? If he did, that said a whole lot about how much the kid trusted him.
There went a little flicker of green in his eyes again. What, did straight people make him angry? Wait, was the Hulk gay? It had never occurred to Clint to think of him in a romantic context in the slightest…
"Huh. Must like blonds..." Clint quipped.
“I dunno, they just seem so married. They have breakfast together and chat about the news. And argue. A lot. Hey, let me get your back,” he said quickly, snagging the bottle and squirting a blob onto his palm.
"Easy, I'm just headin' home after a field trip." Peter held up his hands in a placating way.
"Yeah, we were getting sandwiches."
"Is...it possible that this is the r-real Clint?"
“Okay. Cap and Tony, got that. They’re like an old married couple. But Thor? Come on. I don’t think that’s statistically possible. Especially if you or Hulk are…into men.”
“Until Monday morning, then it’s back to work taking over the world,” Loki explained, sounding like the whole affair was a bother. Leaning to pat the chair next to him, he smiled. “Sit.”
"Woah. You're bleeding. Like, a lot."
Bruce kind of shrank down in his seat, but didn't shrug the arm off of his shoulders. He sighed and Loki felt him relax after a moment as he lifted his head from his palms.
“A white lie—I’m sorry,” Matt said, squeezing Peter’s hands. “Are you alright? Mr. Stark and Mr. Rogers said they’d been looking for you for hours. I’m so glad you know the Avengers.”
"Where the hell are we?" The archer sat up and squinted out the window.
The huge man leaned closer, sharp teeth exposed.
"Spider-Man's not down here," the merc growled off to one side to no one in particular. "She made this motion." He did a 'follow me' gesture with his arms. "That." He said, waggling a finger. "Is because you're stupid." Having finished the one sided conversation he was having, he came over to look down at Iron Man. "Hey pops—can I call you that?"
Tony glared back, opening his mouth to reply even though he had no idea how to put into words what he wanted to say. The lowest item on his worry list sprung to the top, though, as a dark shape shot by them in the water and BUMPED the bottom of the kayak.
The brunette only made the mistake of glancing back to find that hideous disguise two inches from his face once before setting his gaze straight ahead out the train door over the heads of the other passengers.
"Sorry," the real Clint muttered, reaching out to offer his double a hand up, which Loki ignored.
“Peter, if he’s someone you’re ashamed of, you need to consider why very carefully.” Tossing the stick he was holding into the fire, Steve leaned closer to put an arm over Peter’s shoulders to comfort him. “Why do you feel uncomfortable in public? Is he rude to service workers? Does he embarrass you?”
If Matt got any more pissed off, Peter was pretty sure the Spider Sense would start warning him to get clear of the flames. How could they have gone from dating to being this bitter in under a week?
Perhaps Loki had found the Hulk switch. He felt like throwing his head back and laughing, but that would give him away. Just a bit. "And," Loki held up his hand. "before you freak out, I wasn't going to 'try anything.'"
“Okay,” Steve told Peter, carefully lifting the gooey chocolate marshmallow sandwich over to the younger man. “This one’s for you.”
“It won’t really affect us much, but we’d better warn Peter next time we see him. He still does the whole secret identity thing,” Tony said to Steve.
“Here ya go. I thought you said you wanted to stay outside?” He added nervously. At least it hadn’t been Tony and at least Clint hadn’t LOOKED like he had been trying to sneak around.
"So, what? Did the other Hawkeye leave to give you two some privacy?" Tony quipped, still smirking.
"So, he got to...kiss you?" Loki summoned a flush to his cheeks, smiling that same warm smile that he’d seen on the real Hawkeye…ONCE. The man was typically full of complaints and frowns. Though Loki suspected they were mostly for show.
"There's more than one," Bruce informed the merc. "Which way did he go?"
Clint, Tony thought, was going to get yelled at for a lot of things all at once. Poor guy.
"How are we gonna eat hot dogs with our masks on, anyway?"
Bruce kept hold of one of his hands as he turned and started leading the way back toward the cabin.
Pepper's eyes widened a little as she undoubtedly jumped to some conclusions about Doctor Doom's preferences. Apparently they were pretty specific, because whatever had happened to Clint clearly hadn't happened to Cap.
"Yeah. And I had robot pneumonia," came the sarcastic reply as Hawkeye rolled his eyes, heading back across the room to hover by the door. The man was still shaking sick—he was just doing a good job of hiding it.
"T-that's true," he mumbled and handed the card back to Hawkeye. "Thank you, Clint." After a pause and a sip of water, he glanced at Loki and then to Bruce. "Have you f-figured out which is real?"
Had Tony died in his workshop? Maybe he’d starved to death, or slipped into a coma from lack of sleep. Hadn’t his arc reactor taken a hit a few fights ago? Whatever the case was, it was time for some kind of plan. Steve couldn't run off and leave the others—and he had doubts he could run at all with his lungs like this.
"Uh. Thanks."
"There it is!" He pointed excitedly at Stark tower before returning his arm around Spidey—only a little bit lower than before. He squeezed Peter, pressing his chin against the web-slinger's neck to speak in his ear. "I think they changed the name though."
Cap eyed the window, but remembered that Doom's castle sat on top of a cliff. Jumping out would probably be a really bad idea. He looked back to the door. What was taking Tony so long?
"What?" Bruce stopped and followed his gaze, looking at the metal detector with a slightly raised brow. "Oh, wow. I haven't seen one of those in years."
"I don't need to be in bed!" Clint growled, batting Thor away and completely ignoring poor Spider-Man. "How long has it been since you slept, Bruce?" He added, glaring at the sleepy looking scientist. "YOU should be in bed."
Tony was fully prepared to fake a dead sleep, but the little kiss made him feel too warm and fuzzy to ignore his fiance. Someday soon they’d be married and he’d get to wake up beside Steve, only on an actual bed. He had a feeling the five AM wake up time was just a Steve thing, though.
"Where did this new Hawkeye come from?" He asked Thor and Cap, still frowning. What was going on, here? Why copy Clint, of all people?
And the door popped open, and Bruce was following him.
If he couldn’t remember what he and Tony had been fighting about, maybe Tony couldn’t either.
"You, uh, you know who he is?"
"I only really follow a couple of shows. Most of the TV is garbage these days." It was almost like they were in their own little bubble. The vest was thick enough and big enough that it blocked out most of the noise from the rain outside. "We should watch Mega Future Weapons sometime. They had this one cool episode about high tech bows—they weren’t as awesome as mine, but it gave me some ideas for new arrowheads."
His hiking trip felt like some trippy dream, narrated by Deadpool’s endless stream of nonsense.
“Betcha he tosses a shark,” came the grumbling reply from the back.
"Are you sure Tony isn't your type? He's got dark hair, brown...well, sort of topaz amber-ish...eyes, you're paying attention to who he might be interested in, and he's WAY smarter than you," he pointed out.
“Were you awake earlier?” The archer asked, plucking his sandwich off of the couch.
Dr. Banner trudged past them with a beach towel rolled under one arm then, still fully dressed. Peter exchanged a glance with him and got the impression that he had somehow heard every word Peter was trying to say quietly. And he didn't look surprised. Oh, oh no. What if everybody already knew but Peter?
Peter glanced after him, raising an eyebrow.
Bruce only shook his head a little. Anybody would look puny beside the Hulk.
"Uh...can't you do the mouth swab thingy?"
Glancing at Tony, Cap instantly felt guilty.
"Hey...there goes Iron Man!" The armored hero had, indeed, just zoomed past above. His jet trail was still there, sort of.
"Any chance we could tunnel underneath it?"
“No, but he coulda waited until you were back in New York to meet the dads.”
"Hey, the rain stopped. Awesome." The waft of perfume was still strong. It still smelled vaguely familiar...
Bruce coughed at that—thankfully not choking on his pizza, although it might've looked like it—because he and the Hulk technically couldn't age or die. That made THEM soulless by some people's standards. Then again, the Hulk was some soulless, godless monster by a LOT of people's standards...
With Wade, it was hard to tell what he was going to do. Most of the time even he didn’t seem to know what his plan was.
"Then we can smash it again." The Hulk paused with a hand on the hood of the car, turning to look at him. He was actually holding still and talking.
Peter hesitantly reaches for the glasses. “They’re not going to blow up once I put them on, will they?”
There’s suddenly the urge to want to get to know him.
“No. Nope.”
One of the spare bedrooms didn’t offer much, but it beat leaving his son on the sofa in the lab. Tony still can’t help but envision transforming the space into something more along Peter’s taste. He was jumping too far ahead of himself. They still needed to learn a lot more about the other before Tony could ask him to move in.
Pepper nods and smiles softly at him. “Of course.”
“Tell me now before I seal the deal.”
With both his aunt and uncle distracted, Peter decides to go back to his room and tidy it up and sort through his belongings.
“Then you can’t be Captain America anymore.”
“It’s going to take a lot more than that to take me down,” Sam smiles. Beside him Bucky scoffs and shakes his head. Sam turns toward him and says, “You’d miss me if I was gone. You wouldn’t know how to move on.”
Tony is ready to protest, but then he allows Steve to pass the tiny infant to him. The moment his son is in his arms, tears threaten to fall. Tony fights them back.
It’s awkward to be out in public together. Usually, someone was noticing one of them and rushing over to get an autograph or picture. Tony was used to the attention he received whenever he went out, but Steve still struggled.
“I know,” Tony says, “I think everyone does.”
“I think you need to really think this through. If you need to talk then please talk to us. I can’t stress it enough.”
The growl that rips through Steve’s throat has the alpha cowering, a small whimper escaping his bloodied lips. Seeing the alpha scared was something Steve never imagined. The alpha was always boasting about his strength and the power he had. But now Steve was the strong one. He was the dominant one. He was the alpha.
“A dad? Wait, are you-wait, wait. Are you telling me what I think you’re telling me because it sounds like you’re telling me that you’re-”
Steve was finally happy.
Steve releases a sob. “Please? Tony, please don’t take her from me. Don’t take her from me.”
“Why? You told Peter-”
Steve lies down on the bed first, patting the spot beside him for Tony to join. “Come here.”
Peter nods and jumps to his feet. He rushes to grab his backpack. “I have a lot of homework so…”
This was supposed to be the last chapter but I’ll add one more short one just to show what happened after Steve left. A lot of you guessed correctly 😉
“It’s not your fault,” Peter murmurs. “I don’t blame you for...that.”
“Alph-ah!” Steve cries out when a finger enters him. He squeezes his eyes shut, doing everything he can to keep the tears from escaping. His back arches off the bed when that finger thrusts roughly inside him. “No! Please! Don’t!”
“Yeah. Yeah, fine. ‘M fine.” Tony’s words slur. He’s not fine. How much did he have to drink?
“Not pregnant,” Steve sighs. He folds his arms over his chest, closing in on himself. The tears are burning now but he doesn’t let them fall. He can’t cry again.
Sam sighs. There was no point in beating around the bush. “Nick has an assignment,” he confesses.
It should be crying. It should be moving. Something wasn’t right. And it was all Steve’s fault.
“Damn you, Rogers,” Tony growls in annoyance. “Why do you have to be so fucking stubborn?”
Tony isn’t in bed when Steve wakes. The omega furrows his brows in confusion when he wakes up to an empty bed and cold sheets. It was unusual to have the alpha absent. Ever since Tony created a bond between them, the alpha was always close by, ready to protect and comfort the omega. Steve enjoyed Tony’s gentle touch and security.
Talking with Steve was something Tony had anticipated for later, but of course he wasn’t that lucky. Steve had insisted he walk Tony back to his penthouse. His reason was to say goodbye to Peter, but Tony knew there was more to it.
Bruce, like always, is gentle. From day one he had always been a better doctor than the ones Steve had dealt with. But he still can’t help the uneasy feeling that flows through him. He had been assured that this pup was fine, but in the back of his mind, he fears the worst.
Steve sobs louder and clings tightly to Tony. All Tony can do is hold him and comfort him.
“Ned, please! We can talk about it later, okay?”
“I just...um...isn’t she a little...young?” Tony tries to save himself. The last thing he wanted to do was upset Steve after all of the progress he’s made.
“Push, Steve! You’re almost there!” Bucky encourages him, his voice growing excited.
“I’ll tell you once we get on the jet,” Tony says and he moves across the room to get to the closet. He can hear Steve get out of bed and follow him. Tony ignores him and grabs one of his carry on bags and begins stuffing it with clothes.
“I bet. I know Tony’s happy. All he talks about is you and the baby. When we talk anyway.”
Thank you for understanding!
“I don’t know! I-I tried to get rid of it today but then I panicked. I’m scared, Papa.”
“You can do this,” Tony whispers.
Tony is sitting in the middle of the room surrounded by crib parts and the packaging material from the box. He’s hard at work assembling the crib, too engrossed in his project to realize that Steve is watching him from the doorway.
“I’m afraid my mate is missing,” Alexander says.
“No reason. It does look good on you.”
“Sam?” Steve asks one he regains himself. “What the hell was that?”
“You’re good with kids, Buck. Maybe one day you and Sam-”
Maybe one day Tony wouldn’t have to juggle both. Steve would never ask his mate to step away from the company he’s worked so hard to build, but that didn’t mean he wouldn’t mind having Tony home more.
Peter quietly leads his dad away from the party and toward the elevators. He’s glad no one has bothered to rush after him and make him stay. He didn’t want to be at the party anymore. It was ruined.
The day Steve brought home the dog, Tony knew his world was about to be turned upside down. It wasn’t that he had a dislike toward dogs; with the right training, they could be tolerable. But the one Steve found on the streets of Brooklyn wasn’t going to be easy to tame.
But meeting their son was what they were looking forward to the most. For months they’ve been anticipating Peter’s arrival. It was at the point where Steve struggled to hide his excitement. He was finally getting the one thing he’s wanted for so long.
He talks about his old team, The Howling Commandos and the missions they went on. He talks about losing Bucky and his capture.
“Boss,” FRIDAY chimes in. “Mr. Parker has arrived.”
All the pups nod their heads.
Tony pulls away and sits up, his face glistening with the omega’s slick. He can’t help but lick his lips, moaning from the sweetness.
“It’s for you. He-”
?” Sam breaks out into another fit of giggles. The rest of the team join in.
The balloons were red and blue to represent Steve and Tony’s color. It sparks an idea in Tony’s mind and he packs it away for later. Their son was probably going to need a suit, and the blue and red colors would be the perfect combination.
Maybe his lucky streak would continue and Alpha would never find him. Maybe Steve would finally be free from his clutches and the nightmares only an alpha like him could bring. Tony promised freedom, safety, security. Tony promised a home. And Steve would just have to have faith in that.
Tony nods and scratches behind Dodger’s ear. “Two more weeks and things are gonna be different around here.”
“Then touch me.”
“I think you came at the right time. I was ready to...do something stupid.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hang out? Like going to movies? You’re 14, you can go alone.”
“What?”
“You ready for some breakfast?” Steve asks as he carries Peter down the stairs and toward the kitchen.
“I heard you on the phone. You need help and I can help! Please, Papa let me help.”
“Sorry it’s kind of empty. We were cleaning some stuff out,” Peter explains. He gestures to the couch. “You can sit down and stuff. I’ll be right back.”
“Oh.”
Tony eases Steve’s hand away and steps away to shed the rest of his clothing. Steve follows, quickly removing his own until it’s a messy pile near his feet. Tony takes his hand and leads him to the bed, gently pushing him back until Steve’s lying flat on his back. Tony joins and hovers over him, ducking his head down to connect their lips.
“In the world? Buck, he’s old enough now to be alone for a few hours. I trust him.”
It wasn’t surprising that bets were going around the compound. Natasha was convinced that the baby was a girl. Her reasoning was the excessive nausea and morning sickness. Tony called it bullshit and accused her of just wanting another girl on the team.
Tony shuts down the lab and leads his son back toward the elevator and up to the penthouse. Peter is looking at his phone, yawning some more as he scrolls through his messages.
“Wait...you want to? I thought your feet…”
Steve gives him one last smile, then he leaves the room and shuts the door behind him. Peter collapses back on his bed, exhaling heavily. He glances at the backpack he had been packing and shoves it off the bed, too drained to properly unpack his belongings.
But sometimes he wishes their roles were reversed. When they talked about having a baby, it was supposed to be Steve to get pregnant. His body was stronger and capable of carrying a baby compared to Tony’s body. Steve may be older in age but his body still resembled that of someone in their late 20s.
“Isn’t there a medical wing staffed with doctors?”
“Now why would I do that?” Steve grins and offers the ice cream to her. Natasha happily takes another spoonful before the rest is consumed.
Sam laughs harder from the memory. “I’m not even sorry.”
“No,” Tony says with a shake of his head and his eyes fall shut. “I just need a minute. I don’t think I’ve found myself on the bathroom floor like that since last year’s New Year’s Eve party. That was a fun night.” Tony grins at the memory.
Tony’s never scrambled so fast to grab the bottle from the nightstand. He returns with the bottle and pops the lid open, squirting a generous amount over his finger tips. Steve spreads his legs invitingly and takes his own cock in his hand, stroking himself as he watches Tony.
Steve huffs. “Tony, there isn’t. I need to be monitored-”
He huffs and glances down at his watch. He’s only been waiting ten minutes, but it seems like longer. He blames his anxiousness on the fact that he could be meeting his dad for the very first time. It was nerve wracking.
Steve sits down at the kitchen table, sipping the coffee he served himself and reading through the paper. Tony would always joke about him reading the paper when the news was available for Steve to read off the internet. Steve liked the internet and found it helpful, but there was something nostalgic about reading from the paper.
And now his babies were all grown up. They were five now and would be starting school. It was scary to let them out of his reach and into the world he’d promised to protect them from. He wasn’t ready to let them go yet.
“Locked in the bedroom. He’s been in there a majority of the day.”
“Okay. Maybe...maybe the serum helped. I mean it changed a lot of you.”
“Steve, I-” Tony tries to say, only for Steve to cut him off abruptly.
“Of course.” Tony leans down to kiss the top of Steve’s head. “I love you.”
“I don’t believe he’s dead,” Happy says. “He can’t be. I don’t believe it. Something’s wrong with all of this.”
Steve nods and takes a banana on his way out.
Steve sighs heavily and leans back on his heels. “Second thought...maybe you don’t need to walk. I’ll carry you.”
Steve knew his boyfriend was hiding something. Tony was good at keeping things to himself, but Steve knew the alpha well enough. It’s worrisome, and as much as Steve wants to question his mate about the shift in his behavior, he knows he needs to be cautious. Tony rarely opened up; it was still a struggle and the alpha was working hard to achieve the confidence to be more open.
“So much for cleaning this little guy up. He’s out.”
Fuck. Tony loved it when Steve started throwing out orders. That pesky voice is back, pointing out that Steve probably only considers this a quick fuck. Tony doesn’t want to listen, even though deep down he knows that’s exactly what this was.
“You could never. You’re tired, Steve and he’s already passed out. Just stay. Please?”
“Hmm.” Steve pretends to think it over, earning another dirty look. “I guess I could help you out. Oh wait I did. Remember when I said it was time to buy new clothes?”
“Oh shit. They don’t!”
Tony nods and glances down at his lap while he wrings his hands together. Natasha continues to sip her wine, probably feeling pretty pleased with herself. Tony wonders if she would’ve found more joy in beating him to a pulp. Or maybe she was leaving that for Bucky.
Steve mumbles out a response. “Yes?”
Steve misses Brooklyn. He misses the old, worn down apartment, because even though it didn’t have much to offer, it was still his home. It was the only place he had ever known. He can still smell his mother cooking dinner in the tiny kitchen, hearing her humming a tune from her homeland. He remembers her smile, the way it would light up every room she entered. God Steve missed her.
As if in que, the clouds turn a dark shade of gray and bolts of lightning flash across the sky. No one even bats an eye, the only one still uneasy about the sudden storm is the toddler in Natasha’s arms. She hugs him close, and assures him that everything was fine.
The expression on Steve’s face shifts from the mention of Peter. Nick is pleased. Deep down he knew that the famous Captain wouldn’t be gone forever. There would still need to be more tests run to make sure that Steve Rogers was still the man everyone knew him to be, but those would be conducted later. Right now Nick was relieved to find the Avenger alive again.
He’d still have to tell Ned at some point. Ned was his best friend and they always confided in each other. Peter needed to talk to someone. He couldn’t go to his parents because they would flip and probably throw him out. He already felt like a burden.
“P-please?”
“Yes you can. You’ve done way worse.”
Steve nods and lies back, scooting up on the bed until his head is resting on the pillows, and spreading his legs invitingly. Tony crawls over to him, situating himself between Steve’s spread legs and ducking his head down to capture his lips in a kiss. Steve moans softly, and wraps his arms around Tony’s neck, bringing him closer to deepen the kiss.
“It’ll be okay,” Tony assures. He has no problem reaching for Steve’s hand. He doesn’t grab it, just places his own over Steve’s. He wants to do more but he holds off. Lately, he’s already been too touchy. They were supposed to be broken up.
“Morning, Jarvis. Is my dad up?”
Steve gives Tony a kiss on the lips, then he’s leaving the apartment with Morgan. Tony waits until they’re gone and the door shuts before letting out a sad sigh.
“Night, Pete,” Tony says and leans down to kiss his son’s head. Peter smiles and cuddles with his favorite bear.
“I hurt him.”
Bucky inhales sharply. “You were supposed to be training him, not killing the poor kid.”
His hand falls to his middle. His pup was the only thing that mattered, to both him and Hydra. He may be their prized omega but the pup he carried was the real prize. They’d stop at nothing to get their perfect alpha.
“Steve, you’re going to be fine. Trust me. You’re going to fit in, and you’ll be a wonderful mother.”
Steve was locked away in the bedroom, refusing to come out no matter how hard Tony tried to coax him out. He only opened the door to accept food or any of the new clothes Tony had picked out. It was a little frustrating to say the least, but Tony understood that the omega needed space.
“Steve?” Tony crawls toward him. “Honey-”
“But Morgan-”
The alarm is blaring and an eerie red light flashes around him. Steve pushes through, wracking his brain for the exit. He’s been through these corridors a few times, but it’s his eidetic memory that aids him in his escape.
“You know I kinda blame you for this.”
“I know. I didn’t mean for it to go south. Just too many of them I guess. And I didn’t have you,” Steve points out.
“Wait have you ever met the president?”
“You were hungry, huh?.” At the sound of his mother’s voice, Peter’s eyes travel up until they’re connecting with blue ones. Steve smiles down at him. “Hi, there. You know how much I love you, right? You mean so much to me and I promise I’ll never let anyone hurt you.”
Hey! Sorry for the late updates. I just moved into my first apartment and it’s been a pain. I’m trying to find the time to update all my stories so bear with me! I appreciate your patience 😊
His first pregnancy had been unexpected and unwelcome. But then he got used to carrying new life and the joys it would bring. Hydra never let him have anything else. The pups he bore weren’t his, no matter how much he begged.
“It’s different with your children, Tony.”
“How’d it go?” Tony asks. He frowns when he takes in Steve’s battered state. “Jesus. What happened, Cap?”
“Where are we going?”
“Stop being so protective, James,” Natasha teases with a grin. Bucky only grumbles in response.
Tony gives Thor and Clint one last look before pushing past them and making his way toward the kitchen, thanking his lucky stars for Peter’s rescue.
“But I spilled the water and-and-”
“Why? I thought we were supposed to hang out and stuff.”
Sam smirks and leans in close to connect their lips. The distraction they desperately need is interrupted by a loud meow. Sam huffs in annoyance and glances down at the white cat that purrs and rubs against Bucky’s leg. Bucky smiles and scoops her up, cradling her like a baby and kissing her head.
He didn’t believe in spoiling his son with material things. He grew up with more stuff than he knew what to do with, and all he wanted was more kisses and hugs from his father. Spending time with his father and bonding was what Tony wished he had, and now that he had his own son, he was going to give all of his time to him. Material things didn’t last forever, but his love would.
“She’s going to kill you.”
“I got it,” Tony says before Steve can attend to their oldest son. He goes inside and takes James by the hand, leading him back upstairs.
Tony scoffs. “I’m getting fat. Look at this,” he gestures to his belly.
He registers the tears in his eyes and quickly looks away to hide them.
“Yeah?”
“Come on,” Tony gently pulls Steve to his feet, wincing in sympathy when Steve cries out. “I think you should let JARVIS scan you.”
Tony scoffs. “Prove it then.”
. Bruce reminds himself. But by the way the story has been told, it was starting to look like Tony Stark was indeed dead.
Bruce offers a small smile and nods his head. His smile falters and he turns to Tony, leaning in and saying something only meant for the alpha’s ears. Steve can’t help but frown.
“Harley fell and needed a band-aid.”
Yay they finally kissed! And confessed how they feel for each other. Now maybe it's time they mate properly.
“Aww,” Ned coos and points at the little gray blob. “It’s so cute and small! Can I name it?”
The shield starts to crumble, small particles of stone falling onto the ground. Peter grunts and pulls a little harder. He snaps out of it and releases his hold when he breaks the shield off. It falls to the ground.
All day Peter’s been on edge. He doesn’t want to think about Flash. Not anymore.
Tony smiles into the kiss. He gently pushes Steve back. “Your turn, sweetheart.”
Steve huffs out a laugh. “You’re one to judge. You cried last night because I wouldn’t get you Burger King at 3 A.M.”
“Shh. It’s okay. I want this to feel good for you. Does it?”
Tony sighs again. “It’s not what you think. Steve wanted to do something small and...yeah. Wait, are you calling to let me know you’re not coming or…”
Steve frowns. “But you’re tired too.”
“Not home,” Bucky grumbles.
“Sorry.” Ned winces from his mistake and he lowers his voice. “How do you expect to get through the rest of this year?”
Steve sighs. “I hate letting him down. You know once this baby gets here it’ll be harder for us to spend time together.”
“I’m sorry,” Peter whispers into the darkness. “I’m sorry. I should’ve…”
Tony walks Bruce back to the jet and waves goodbye. He watches as the jet leaves and eventually disappears into the clouds. There’s a giddy smile on his face when he goes back inside. All he can think about is Steve and their baby.
“I don’t know what to do,” Steve admits. “We still have to tell Peter and-and…”
“But they want me and our son and now...now they want you. I never wanted them to hurt you and now-” Steve pauses and slowly caresses his mate’s cheek, careful not to disturb the large bruise. “-they have. Look what they did to you.”
Steve frowns and continues to run his finger on the line, following the trail. “You know I’d be doing this if I could. I never wanted you to suffer. I was willing to do it all.”
“Tony?”
Steve nods. “Yeah. She’s not here, but they told me she’s okay.”
Steve brushes the pain off as false labor. He was at that stage and all the books mentioned it. They also mentioned that the pain wasn’t usually horrible and the contractions would be sporadic. Real labor contractions were supposed to have a pattern.
“I hate to show up like this, Mr. Stark, but I’m afraid I had no choice,” Alexander explains.
He gives himself one last look then shuts off the light and exits the bathroom. He finds Tony in the nursery dressing their son. Tony is already dressed, looking sharp and handsome in one of his suits. Steve suddenly feels underdressed, but before he can turn around and think about changing, Tony is pausing the peekaboo game with Peter to glance up at him.
Sam smiles and wraps an arm around his nephew’s shoulders, leading him toward their apartment.
Tony makes his way downstairs, and he’s immediately greeted by the scent of coffee and bacon. But it’s not the familiar aroma of breakfast that makes Tony stop in his tracks. The kitchen is decorated with balloons and streamers and laying on the kitchen island is a neatly wrapped present.
Peter giggles again and Steve smiles down at him, his heart bursting with joy just from the sound. The laughter was not only a sign that Peter was enjoying himself, but that he was happy. All Steve ever wanted for his children was to be happy. Their happiness and the happiness of his mate meant more to him than anything else.
“Like what?”
“Okay?”
Peter nods and switches to chewing the nail off his thumb. A knock on the door has him jumping in surprise and quickly rushing to answer it.
Jarvis doesn’t respond but the door to the lab opens and Tony quickly backs further away. Steve is cautious when he steps into the lab. A deep frown of concern is etched on his face.
Peter was tiny, defenseless; relying strictly on Steve and Steve alone to care for his every need. It was going to be up to Steve to make sure he was dressed, fed, bathed. It was Steve’s job to be there when Peter had a nightmare or fell down.
The sound of the front door captures Tony’s attention and he looks up, his smile widening at the sight of the person stepping through.
“I know, I know. But this is how I cope. I make jokes. Honestly, I’m terrified. I can’t have a kid. Look who I am.”
A warning growl escapes Tony’s throat. “You’re not badmouthing my kiddos, right?”
He wouldn’t be like Howard. He’d be better. He’d show Peter everyday just how much he loved him. It was difficult for him to show affection but for his own son it would come easy. Peter would always know how much he was loved and cared for.
“Daddy!”
“Of course.”
“I’m terrible? You named your cat Alpine!”
His question is answered when Happy quickly unbuckles himself and scrambles out of the car. The next contraction begins to build and Steve pushes along with it, crying out when his daughter’s head slides out to her brow.
When the nightmares did occur, they were never the same. The setting was always the most consistent; Steve would be in the base, locked away in his cell and begging for someone to help him. Sometimes he’d dream about Rumlow and Rollins, and the abuse they put him through. But mostly it had been Pierce haunting his dreams. Steve would always be reminded of the terrible things the alpha did.
Steve sighs. “No stress,” he repeats.
Tony growls from the omega’s begging. The alpha in him enjoys the pleading and wanton noises the omega produces. He feverishly kisses Steve again, his tongue slipping between Steve’s parted lips and mapping out his mouth, tasting him.
Steve nods, and this time a small smile forms over his face. “Yeah.”
“What’s with the special breakfast?” Tony has the audacity to ask. He should just be grateful that he had a big breakfast being made for him. Lately all he wanted to do was eat. And sleep. Definitely sleep.
“Hey.” Tony comes over the second a sob tears from Steve’s throat. He drops down to his knees in front of his mate and reaches for his hands. “Honey, you’re not a bad mom. You can never be one. He’s not even here yet and I can see how much you love and care for him.”
Now isn’t the time for confessions, but Steve’s been holding those feelings in since the night Tony suggested they break off their relationship.
“It’s okay.”
Tony has never seen Peter so nervous. He knew the kid could be a ball of nervous energy on occasion. Honestly, Peter was just a ball of energy in general. But Tony has never seen him like this. It makes him a bit nervous.
Steve chuckles and happily takes their youngest pup into his arms to feed him. Tony helps adjust Peter and soon he’s latching on and nursing.
Steve nods his head, tears still rolling down his face. “They’re all there. He...he never-” A choked sob cuts Steve off.
“Uncle Bucky said to go for your legs.”
His hair is sticky and matted down, but Steve can still recognize the light shade; the Stark genes didn’t come through this time around. But then his son is opening his eyes and they resemble his own.
Sarah replies with a grin, showing off the bit of teeth she did have.
“Yeah,” Steve says and unravels the wrap from his hands. He peers up at her, noticing the smile was gone. “What? Isn’t that the right thing to do?”
“What are you thinking?” Steve asks. He knows Tony too well; they both knew more about the other than anyone else ever could. “Talk to me.”
Steve quietly steps into the room, not wanting to wake him. He kneels down in front of Tony until he’s eye level with his belly. Tony stirs slightly when Steve reaches out to place both hands over the bump, then he’s relaxing again and snoring.
His hand is squeezed and Peter stares at his father again, another sob ripping free. The once sparkling eyes were losing their shine. Peter’s just thankful he gets to stare into them again, but he’s not ready to say goodbye yet.
“Did she wake up early?” Tony asks instead. The dark circles under Steve’s eyes have yet to fade, and it seems every day they’re getting more prominent.
“Sam-” Bucky tries to cut him off, but Sam shakes his head.
For months he went on believing that he could never have a baby. He had eventually learned to accept it, and maybe that’s why he disregarded the signs of the life growing inside of him. But now that life was cradled in his arms.
When it’s Steve’s turn to speak he finds himself shutting down. He peers up at the faces of the omegas who had already told their stories and the struggles they’re still facing. If they could do it then so could he. He could be strong.
“I’m sorry,” Steve apologizes and sits up. He runs a hand through his hair and lets out a deep breath. “I didn’t mean to interrupt you.”
“Why? What’s wrong with staying here? You know, in your home?”
Steve steals a glance in Sam’s direction and when he gets a smirk from his friend, he knows ignoring the question isn’t going to be enough. Steve turns to his right, only to find the exact same look on Bucky’s face. He was cornered.
“I promise. Can we start now?”
“He’s just a kid. He’s not your perfect alpha.”
It was easier said than done.
It’s not until Thor is there and the blue sky returns does the toddler grow excited over another family member.
“I just want to kiss you.” The smirk on Tony’s face has Steve second guessing that response, but at the same time he can’t bring himself to care. He wanted to kiss Tony too.
“I have my ways.”
Tony tries to bring Steve close, and this time he’s granted permission. He holds Steve tightly, letting him cry and get whatever pain he’s feeling out. Tony talks sweetly to him and trails a hand along Steve’s back.
The sound of voices fill the bathroom and Peter gasps softly in surprise. He recognizes them instantly, but only one voice makes his stomach twist into uncomfortable knots.
“Uh...last year. I’ve been thinking of going and Papa said he didn’t mind and...I just haven’t worn it because of you-know-who and-and-”
“Maybe,” Steve finally gives a response.
Tony chuckles and throws an arm around Bruce’s shoulder and leads him away. “This is me being nice. Unless you want to help out with the late night feedings?”
Sam wraps an arm around Bucky’s shoulder and pulls him in close, pressing a kiss to his temple. “We’ll be fine,” Sam assures his friends once he catches the broken expression on their faces.
“I’m okay. I’m just trying to get dinner ready and...I’m sorry.”
“Nothing. I guess I’m used to Harley taking all of your time.”
You guys! This is the last chapter 😭 Oh man has it been a roller coaster. I had been anxious when I first started writing this and now it has become one of my favorites. I’m really going to miss it 😔
Another boom echoes, the space filling with thick, gray smoke. All Steve can think about is his team and if they had gotten out before the second explosion.
“It was you!” Peter jumps up from the couch, away from his dad. Tears build in his eyes. “You...you blew up the base.”
“We’re having a baby,” Steve whispers. He trails a hand down to Tony’s flat stomach, resting his palm against the spot where their baby was growing.
He knew Natasha Romanoff already, but still struggled to fully trust her. Clint Barton had his moments and could be a real pain in the ass. Thor, The god of thunder was...well, Tony was still trying to figure that out. The last he knew Thor was just a mythical character. Bruce Banner appeared to be the only guy on the team that spoke Tony’s language, both figuratively and literally. They clicked instantly and Tony didn’t care about Bruce’s mean streak and his tendencies to smash things.
Natasha chuckles and offers him a hand. Peter eyes it, not fully trusting her to pull him up. She’d probably just flip him over again.
“You mean like the press?”
Being away from Steve doesn’t get easier. The days pass slowly, and though Tony has his daughter to keep him sane, it’s not enough. A piece was missing, and Tony wasn’t sure when that piece would be coming home.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Take as long as you need.”
The moment the story broke, Bruce had immediately tried reaching out to his friend, and when that didn’t work, he rushed to Stark tower. Tony never did say when he was coming back to New York, and for a second, Bruce had hoped he’d find his friend safe and sound back in his tower, his new family with him.
Peter giggles and lifts up the block he had put in his mouth, not caring that it had been slobbered on. “Bock!”
Steve’s flushes and he throws an arm over his face to hide his growing blush. Tony frowns and gently removes his arm, wanting to see his beautiful mate.
His son huffs again. “But why!”
Being pregnant sucked, and he still had months to go.
“Just because you’re incapable of hanging up your suit doesn’t mean I’m not. I care about this family; it comes first.”
“Tony, no.” Steve reaches out for the alpha and takes both of his hands. “Don’t say that.”
Steve lets out a sigh and tips his head back against the couch. “That went well.”
If only Flash could say the same about his living situation.
“Shit. Steve, I’m sorry. I was going to tell you about the test. I swear I was.”
Bruce automatically shrank away from Clint's hand, covering his face with one of his own.
Slapping on a smile, Peter waved at Wade, then immediately turned back to Clint.
Tony shot Steve a curious look, but shrugged a little and took the frisbee.
“Sure,” he said quietly, and scooted back over to where he’d been sitting before, hugging his knees up close to his chest again. “…Did you two really come out here without even a sleeping bag and choose to sleep on a rock?”
Gawking back at the brown haired man, Clint wasn’t sure what to do. He didn’t ever get to hear Bruce laugh, and he was pretty sure he’d only seen the man smile a grand total of ONCE—not counting the small smirks at irony.
Thor was silent for a moment, then said carefully, "I will relay this information to Iron Man. Wait a moment." The card flickered off.
There was a grumble of thunder overhead, and he cringed. Really?
Without comment or breaking his stride, Black Panther walked between them and snagged a burger plate before continuing off onto the beach again.
"Yeah, even I’m having second guesses," Hawkeye grumbled, making a beeline into the medical room. He carefully laid Loki down, arranging a pillow under his head with surprising care. "But you're way wimpier than me." It sounded more playful than anything, and Loki caught Hawkeye smiling at him. "But you know, I wouldn't have stabbed you if I knew you'd keep ripping it open!"
"No, but the world isn't ending--currently--so we're gonna relax and let all of the other heroes take care of the petty criminals for a few days. Just a few days, Cap, c'mon," Tony pleaded, glancing at him a few times. "You've barely stopped fighting long enough to see this timeline since you woke up in it! And it's not like we're going to outer space--again--or anything, so if some world-ending emergency comes up, Jarvis will tell me."
"Hey! You're the freak here, purple shorts! Now shut up or you'll attract the ghosts!” Deadpool shot back.
"I've watched a few documentaries, too," Tony replied dryly, paddling steadily as well. He wasn't afraid of sharks—they were just wild animals. "Says they usually bump first, then trying taking a bite."
“Good morning, Thor,” Cap said, heading over to greet the demigod with a smile. “Anything to report?”
"Hey. There you go," Hawkeye said as he gave Bruce a nervous smile. "Look at me, the Hulk whisperer."
“Whoa, that’s a load off!” Matt said with forced relief. “God, I was so worried! Well, that’s great news!” Standing up, he awkwardly sat his coffee aside (clearly making it as awkward as he could manage). “We should go find Wade and tell him. I’m sure he’ll be SO relieved. Wow.”
Pepper quickly shook her head.
"Wow."
Salsa, Clint thought hungrily, getting to his feet. It took a lot of effort and he was distracted by the idea of food. Why had he skipped breakfast?
Thor looked a bit confused about the course of the conversation.
Wade was making his way through camp, using Matt’s cane to poke his way through the crowd. Everyone seemed confused by him, but they jumped to move and let him through.
“Wade, can you grab those tongs?”
Clint leaned into Bruce’s hand ever so slightly, looking him over with those piercing blue eyes.
"That is the LAMEST excuse ever!" Deadpool groaned, getting up. "You sneak out all the time—" He paused to yell off to one side. "—Oh, yes he does!"
"Well, you've dealt with him more than me. Let's do this." She flew down to the front gate.
Bruce normally only got to be himself one day a month. Which was pretty annoying when Clint wanted to get to know the guy.
Waking up enough to adjust his makeshift pillow, which was the first aid kit, Clint rolled over and sighed. The Hulk was usually a lot more comfortable to sleep on.
"Ah...wh—huh?" Bruce stumbled over his words, looking at the blond in obvious surprise. He actually took a step back before holding up his hands, the scanner still in one, and quickly shaking his head. "I-it's not...like that. Really."
Abruptly, he noticed that Matt had been sitting there the whole damned time, staring into space.
"Oh yeah." The blond looked up at him. "Everybody thinks I'm a clone. Hey." He smoothed a hand through his hair too. "I think I told you that last night."
Bruce, who had looked up quickly when Clint fell back, blinked at the fish hook. Softly, he started to laugh. And kept laughing, wrapping an arm around his middle.
He could hear a brief scuffle behind him, followed by crashing.
Literally. It wasn't Steve who had just walked in, it was Daredevil, sans mask but wearing his red super hero suit. Tony squinted at him as the redhead turned and started to carefully sort through one of the bags of clothes in the corner.
More importantly, what the hell was he doing inside RIGHT after saying he wanted to stay outside? If Clint had actually tried moving the tackle box, he would've been caught red-handed!
“Hm? Oh, no, I think it’s better this way,” Tony said, glancing over at him. He smiled wistfully—a look Steve had been getting a lot lately when they were in public and had to pretend they weren’t together—and added, “We’ll have our hands full enough with these three right now.”
"Well, she seemed 'nice'," Tony said dryly, turning to Peter as well. The teen gave them both a look of disbelief.
"Doom seemed to make the original to drink, so I made mine the same way." Needles didn't do so well with Steve, anyway.
Tony hugged him back shakily, chuckling.
"Wha...what did I do?" Clint asked, surprised. "I didn't do anything to him!" He hopped out of the chair, making a beeline for the door. "How about a nice roast turkey?"
"Oh, you came back down from orbit," Tony commented, pulling a sharp turn and circling the Baxter building to take a closer look at the scene of the bombing from the day before. "That's nice, I was feeling lonely."
Matt had passed right through the living room and kitchen combo, making his way down the hallway to Cap’s room.
Peter peeled the wrapping off of his hotdog, which was dripping condiments. The ketchup looked like blood with chunks of pickle—bleh. He did his best to scrape it off onto the wrapper and eat the hotdog instead.
"Uh huh. Likewise buddy." Shirtless Clint went over and sat down by the other to nab a part of the blanket.
“Did you find it? Come on, I have a shit ton of arrows!” Hawkeye grumbled from nearby, crunching through the underbrush. “Bruce?”
"You're only human, okay?" Bruce told Loki quietly. "I-I'm not sure what Doom did to your skin, but one of the other Hawkeyes knows which arrows can still hurt you. Please don't be reckless. Let me take the hit, if somebody has to get hit. Arrows and bullets don’t permanently hurt me."
"Sure." Hawkeye looked around slowly, rubbing his neck. He spotted a small end table and went to check it for blankets.
“No. I know I’d hate to have everyone think we’re an item when we certainly aren’t,” he said tiredly, going back to the burgers.
“No shit,” Clint growled back.
Lightning flashed brilliantly above them, and for a split second Tony looked like a marble statue with his hands in Steve’s—pale and perfectly sculpted, the blue of the Arc reactor glowing so strongly that it countered the white light from above. The moment was gone as quickly as it came, though, and the air shook with the force of the thunder that followed.
"Trying to help you," Bruce corrected, now disinfecting the same needle he'd used before. "The pain pill I gave you before doesn't seem to be doing anything. I might be able to inject something, but it will have to be right by the wound."
Oh right. He hadn’t slept. Bruce had refused to sleep in the tent with Clint and Thor, instead taking his sleeping bag and going off alone into the bear infested forest.
“Yes, but usually you get patched up and then lay around at home eating junk food until the wound won’t reopen when you draw your bow,” Bruce replied, dabbing carefully at the bloody edges of the injury. His eyes were a softer color now, their true brown with just a thin ring of green around the edges. It was kind of eerie with how still he was sitting. “…Who says I’m part of the team, anyway?”
"Which way?" The driver asked in a low Italian accent.
The grumbly stream of consciousness thoughts drifted through Tony’s head until they reached the opposite shore. One step at a time. Step one, get Peter and the others back to camp.
"Cap, I work with reporters."
Scout for a spot where he could bury the box. Maybe even out in the water. There was a chance it would be unburied as the waves came and went, but maybe Clint could pike stones on top of it? Or just swim out really far.
“Wow, Thor’s really laying the stormy weather on thick,” he commented to Matt and Wade, raising both brows. “Maybe a little too thick. I can’t even see them anymore!”
Peter frowned and went back to the window. Opening it, he poked his head out and looked up toward the roof. The roof edge blocked his view and huge drops of rain landed into his eyes. Also blocking his view.
“Yes?”
"I love Thor," Loki stated, staring up at the ceiling. It had never occurred to Loki until that moment that Thor wasn’t stupid—Loki was just very smart. His stepbrother wasn’t a fool, at all. He was noble and blond and handsome.
Even at the top of a skyscraper, Hawkeye was more at ease when sitting on his big green friend’s shoulders than being beside him. It was convenient if they had to go leaping off of the building at a moment’s notice, too.
“Peter’s all about responsibility—you’d think he wouldn’t tell Wade unless he could trust him.” Tony frowned, at the conversation or at the distance Steve couldn’t tell. “You know, Cap, I’m surprised you of all people want to swim right after breakfast. Isn’t that supposed to be bad?”
"Well, you win," he declared, even though Clint hadn't actually shown his cards yet.
"...Sure."
Peter stared at him, blushing despite himself. Jeez, he was talking like Peter was going to MARRY Wade or something.
The sky flared brilliantly as purple lightning burst across it. The thunder was right on top of him--no delay between the two. It was deafening. There was an advantage, though--against the purple light and angry grey clouds, he saw Mjolnir shining bright silver in the distance.
The longer he held out not talking to Tony, the more lonely he felt. He never realized how much time he spent with Iron Man until they got into a spat and spent time apart.
“Nonono!” Peter whispered, webbing the pistol with a shot so that it couldn’t fire. It sort of webbed up Wade’s hand as well, but too bad. “I just heard Thor talking a minute ago, didn’t you?” What were the chances that the Avengers just happened to go camping in the same spot that he and Wade did? Were Cap and Tony so concerned with his safety that they maybe followed him here…? It didn’t make sense one way or another, the guys weren’t that overprotective back in the city.
Looking uneasy suddenly, Bruce actually leaned away a bit. His eyes flared brighter, though.
"He's probably talking about MJ's perfume you stole," Peter said drolly, shaking his head. "Listen, you guys be careful, okay? The Hulk's on the loose again, I guess. The news was talking about it."
"You just told me to rest, Thor. Which is it?" He hissed, letting go of the blond man's hand.
The archer waited for a response, bright blue eyes focused sharply on Bruce's every move. His hair was dripping again now that they weren't under cover, and it was hard not to take notice of how his shirt clung to his muscular arms.
Clint looked at him sideways, raising an eyebrow at him.
It was very strange NOT to wear a mask for a few days. Looking from face to face of all the people seated around the campfire, Cap felt strangely lonely.
"I wonder," Peter said sarcastically, shaking his head.
"Get. It. Now," Wolverine growled.
"No, I'm good." He gave Bruce a thumbs up.
Without hesitation, Thor picked him up, wrapping his cape around Steve.
Bruce blinked at him, not laughing at all in response. He wrapped an arm around Clint in return and rather clumsily rubbed his back. His hand was freezing cold.
The redhead nodded and hurried down the hallway.
"I'll be fine." Bruce sighed and combed his hair away from his face with his fingers. "Why did you run from the Hulk? You know he likes you."
Peter shielded his eyes from the rain, watching the waves dashing against the beach. One tiny cloud had been whipped into a roaring rain and thunder storm in a matter of maybe fifteen minutes. There was a wall of fog out across the water, completely obscuring the sandbar where Cap and Tony had last been seen. It was a good thing he’d actually seen them go ashore, or he would’ve been worried they were out on that choppy water.
“Lake monster?” Loki asked, glancing around the group. “There’s no lake monster.”
The archer looked down at the blanket and then at Bruce, surprised.
“…Why do you want to know?” He asked slowly.
"You guys don't know him," Peter said, looking after the other two like he wanted to follow them. Turning sad brown eyes on both Steve and Tony, he added seriously, "I know you've probably heard all sorts of awful things, but if you trust me at all, you'll believe me when I say Wade's NOT a bad guy. You really think I would trust a bad guy with my real name and risk my aunt and my friends?"
Doom huffed indignantly and sat up straight, looming like a tower over Clint. The blond could see his eyes smoldering green in the dark sockets of the mask now, and his hands seemed to be igniting themselves as well. It was a good thing he'd let go of Clint's face when he sat up.
“That sounds good to me. Here,” Cap stepped up and knelt down with his back to Tony. “Let me carry you. The steps up to the cabin are solid stone—if you slipped, you’d break your neck.”
“I’ll bet Clint would be good at this,” he remarked, tossing it idly in the air instead of throwing it. “He never seems to miss things, even when he’s just throwing something.”
There was a total lack of reply from the room he'd just exited. Before he could decide whether to teleport or not, though, a pair of enormous green hands stuck through the hole in the door, grabbed the sides, and wrenched it off of its hinges.
The blond stared at him, confused. "I was j-just..." He nodded to Tony's chest, continuing to stare at the brown eyed man. Was Tony dying or something? What if it was worse than he let on?
"I could kiss you."
The screen changed away from the pretty woman suddenly, showing the mansion gate. Tony was on the inside, leaning to kiss a black haired man on the outside. It was Loki!
“See? Way smarter.”
"You told me you know how to lure him here," Doom said, rather than answer his question. "Before I ask how, I will hear WHY you are betraying your comrade."
“I prefer FOOL,” Wade huffed, crossing his arms. “’Sides, MJ and Spidey aren’t together anymore.”
“Don’t like swimming,” Clint commented.
Peter looked around uneasily. Oh, no. Really? No way did Matt misplace both his glasses and his cane. Wade gone, both of those things also gone?
“Peter told me he’d be camping up here for the weekend with a friend.” Shifting his walking stick to the other hand, the man tipped his head curiously. “Tony and Steve…and Thor. I don’t suppose you’re Avengers?”
Hawkeye followed them, very confused.
"Hey, hey! You were jumping at Bruce!"
“I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it eight years and a half ago,” Peter quoted, glancing back at Cap. He quickly waved for Loki to go. “There’s more, read it, it’s good! It’s okay, Cap, he’s just leaving.”
Tony looked after him and shook his head.
"You wound me, my lady." Deadpool turned back to Tony. "If I get Captain Old Glory back for you, can I have your blessing?"
Stepping over, Tony shook Wade’s hand as well.
In the meantime, the fact that Loki didn’t know Peter Parker was Spider-Man hadn’t even occurred to Peter. He’d just jumped down out of a tree, he’d thought that was a dead giveaway.
"Can we n-not talk about that anymore? It's o-over." Steve coughed, turning back to Pepper. "We made it t-through. That's all...that's all that matters n-now." His throat was getting worse again. If he just kept quiet and didn't speak, it wouldn't hurt so bad. But keeping quiet wasn't something he was good at when people needed encouraging words. He gave Pepper a sad smile. "I'll be alright. Y-you should r-rest."
"I wouldn't mind a castle of my own someday," the blond said, sipping the water. "So, you still want Thor?"
“Could you tell Cap? I don’t wanna get the whole ‘endangering the team’ speech again.” Popping open another soda, Clint added it to both his and Tony’s drinks.
Scrambling back, Hawkeye pointed to Amora.
"I’m so sorry. I forgot." He carefully started twisting the wires out again, focusing. This was the worst weekend he'd had in awhile—but at least no one had died.
"...Well, one of you is a sneaky bastard," Tony said, popping up the mask and arching an eyebrow. "You're gonna hate me for this, but I've got to do the other tests later—and you two get locked up 'til I get back. No tracking bracelets, just locked up."
Kicking to the surface, Peter spat out water and looked around for Clint.
Cap sat back up a bit. He couldn't sleep. Not yet. Gazing across the room at Tony, he couldn’t help being concerned. The billionaire was being suspiciously nice. Maybe the virus was worse than he let on?
"You know those are supposed to be meatBALLS, right?"
“This article,” Tony flipped through the paper again, holding up an alarming picture toward Steve, “says that you and I are dating because you say my name a lot!”
“The power’s been on this whole time,” Peter clarified, giving him a hug and a pat on the back in return. Noticing how quiet it was in there, he tilted his head and frowned. “I think the rain just stopped, too!”
The vest was shortly over their heads—much to a certain scientist's disappointment. Clint held it over them, shivering.
The fire crackled and sent a stream of orange embers up into the warm night air as Dr. Banner put a few more pieces of wood on it. The scientist apparently liked fishing and camping, and had started the fire out of driftwood without much need for assistance.
Tony coughed and sank down onto his side on the table to curl up. Ugh, what a miserable day. Okay, he admitted it, hooking up to power the whole mansion off of his heart had been stupid—Cap was cured now, though, and that wouldn't have happened otherwise. Hopefully Cap came back sometime soon.
"Yes," he said quickly, before Clint could finish.
Wishing he could double check that story with Peter, Steve was relieved to see the campsite come into view around the trees.
Steve frowned.
"No thanks," Loki hissed, turning away to shoo Hawkeye with a hand. "Bruce's right here."
“Stop this foolishness!” Thor was, Tony realized in bemusement, addressing both Loki AND Steve. He had just swam in front of Steve and was frowning sternly at his stepbrother. “We are not here to fight, and if you are then you are outnumbered. Can we not coexist with an entire lake between us?”
"Ha." The green eyed man turned away again, crossing his arms. "Only if you plan to kill him—I wanted to reserve that pleasure for myself."
“Me? Yeah. This is…” Tony pauses for a moment and scans the room of familiar faces. His gaze stops on Steve. “Great. Best party ever.”
“For what? It’s normal to feel like this. At least, that’s what I’ve heard. Having a baby is scary.” Pepper’s voice is calm and soothing and it has Steve relaxing almost instantaneously. He turns around to face her, not caring about the tears and blotchy spots on his cheeks. “Oh, sweetie. It’s okay.”
He must be on the right floor.
“I couldn’t do this,” he says out loud, the words slipping without his permission. Steve peers up at him from where he’s been laboring. The bed had become his nest a week ago, another signal that Peter would be arriving soon. Tony wishes he had paid more attention to the signs. “Sorry,” Tony apologizes. “Talking to myself.”
“I don’t know.” Peter shrugs. “Maybe because deep down I know you care. You’re just scared. And that’s okay because I’m scared too.”
“Why?” Tony whispers, “why did it have to be you? It should’ve been me.”
One glance around the silent table has Peter wishing he could be thrown off the roof. No one has said a word since everyone sat down. His parents were having some sort of silent conversation between themselves, something Peter has witnessed before. It makes him roll his eyes and stab his chicken a little too harshly. He knows it wasn’t the poor chocken’s fault, but someone else has to suffer alongside him.
“What a waste of perfectly good cake,” Sam jokes.
He’s no longer standing in the lab of his dad’s tower, but instead he’s on the Quinjet. Peter glances around the space frantically, unable to believe that he’s really back on the jet. He’s quickly reminded that this was an illusion, just a fragment of his memory. All he had to do to end it was take the glasses off, but he can’t bring himself to do it. He yearns to see his papa again.
“We were supposed to be.”
He’s at least grateful that they don’t put the sack back over his head, and he’s able to examine the corridors he’s led down. It was almost impossible to guess just how big the base was, but judging by its mass size, it must have multiple access points. They would be heavily guarded, probably cameras on every corner too. Breaking out wasn’t going to be easy.
“I’m so close,” Steve warns.
“Of course he will. Just not the way you want him to. I bet he’s watching over that kid, and you and me and the rest of the team. He’s probably wondering why you’re acting so grumpy.”
