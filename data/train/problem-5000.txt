He pressed ‘Call’ on the only contact available and placed the old phone on top of the cushion next to his head.
The point is, they were friendly enough. So that’s why, when Tony saw him standing on the balcony at the Maria Stark foundation gala with that far-away look in his eyes, he decided to go and talk to him.
The elevator doors dinged open and Hill guided him through the corridors until she reached a closed door.
“That was basically the case with Bucky and I. I know, the variables were totally different and I made many mistakes, but knowing he was alive and I could save him? I would do anything to help him.” Steve said with a gentle tone.
It all started during one night when Steve had a rather bad nightmare. Tony found him covered in blankets shivering on the common-room's couch, even though it was like 82 degrees outside.
“I’m so sorry, Tony. I’ve never thought of the impact losing JARVIS had to have on you. I was too narrow minded at the time. I only knew how to blame you for Ultron, for Vision and didn’t even think what you lost in the process.”
After leaving him to deal with the situation caused by the Accords alone. Despite all of this, Tony still had loved him.
“Then I’m glad we’re on the same page.” Tony replied beaming, while pulling Steve in for another mind blowing kiss.
He looked around the room. It seemed like a bad replica of a 40s home. Poor guy probably would have hated it.
“Sometimes, yes. But not that often anymore. I have other things to be scared of at night now.” the other man replied. He knew he wasn’t playing fair, but he wanted to be honest with Steve.
Steve always did that. He made him see the rational side of every problem he faced. That, of course, didn’t mean he understood or accepted it, but it still helped.
The other man left a small gasp of surprise giving Tony the entrance to further explore his mouth. After a few moments the blond came to his senses and started kissing back. He pulled Tony closer by the waist and deepened the kiss granting a grown of satisfaction from his soulmate.
“I believe in fate. Ever since I was a child my ma would tell me stories about soulmates, while I was in my bed sick, instead of playing with the other kids. I grew up believing there’s eternal and all consuming love and with you, sweetheart, I finally felt it. It’s like we’re-“
Tony felt a little brave when he said “Well, you never know, maybe we’ll do that again someday. Better than any kind of therapy.” His good mood prevailed after all.
Even though his side still hurt from the gunshot, just listening to Tony’s excited voice, made him feel content.
As Steve spoke a thousand ideas ran through the genius’ mind, trying to contemplate all the feasible solutions.
He locked himself in the workshop for days ‘till Pepper came to his rescue. But even she couldn’t change his foul mood. Rhodey was away on duty, so he mostly was alone.
“I honestly don’t know.” He admitted but Tony didn’t care. He could feel tears threatening to spill from his eyes.
“Come on!” Tony shouted over the loud music while trying to lift his boyfriend from his sitting position by grabbing his arm. “I know it’s not your scene, but have some fun!”
They were silently riding the elevator before the agent finally said, “I have to warn you... I don’t know how stable Captain Rogers is at the moment. You have to understand, he’s lost too many people. He’s still grieving. It takes a lot to get used to a new era. But we called you ‘cause he insistently asked for you... probably because of your relation with Howard.”
Steve had removed the bullet at that point in time and was patching up the wounded skin with two stitches. He didn’t even really need them, as it would heal fast enough, but he wanted Tony to keep talking for as long as possible.
“And you still haven’t seen half of it. There are countless movies about space these days. Gravity, After, Interstellar, so many choices. Although to be honest, the alien ones don’t really appeal to me anymore. After, you know, seeing actual aliens.” the genius huffed out an awkward laugh.
Rhodey was the first one to make a toast to the newlyweds and didn’t omit to mention some of Tony’s memorable stories from MIT. All in all, it was a sweet speech filled with laughter and love. Tony stubbornly insisted that his tears were caused by his allergies.
The ceremony the next day went smoothly and weirdly enough the grooms didn’t even feel a tad anxious. They have never felt so sure about anything in their lives. Getting married felt like the most normal thing for them at that point.
At this point Steve was used to being called variations of Captain as Tony mocked him for being as virtuous as Captain America.
They stayed there until Steve stopped shivering, until they could feel the warmth of the morning sun.
They decided not to write their own vows. They didn’t want to get too sentimental or worry about saying the correct stuff. So, they thought it would be better to keep it classy. After all, what mattered was they had each other then and forever.
Tony’s brain needed a second to process that Steve had teased back. Steve, Captain America, Miss Congeniality had actually flirted.
Hi! The chapters from now and on are not beta’d (though I’d gladly accept anyone’s help). This chapter is dedicated to Erika who helped me with her superb French knowledge<3
He just didn’t want to be rejected by America’s hero, that’s all. During the whole ride his foot couldn’t stop shaking.
And of course, the kid explained to that doofus that the relative strength of nuclear force is 10^38, while the relative strength of gravitational force is only like one. And he knew nothing, nothing I repeat, about fusion and fission!”
“Well, there will always be bad guys out there, but you shouldn’t worry ‘cause there will also be good guys to fight them every time.” he replied.
At Steve’s voice Tony finally broke. He think he sobbed at that moment and if Yinsen heard, he was polite enough not to mention anything.
“Tony..” a drowsy voice could be heard from the end of the line. “Everything okay?” Steve continued softly. Tony had obviously woke him up, but he couldn’t even feel guilty about it.
He somehow needed to get his mind off the matter at hand, so he placed the knife down and dug out the flip phone out of his pant pocket.
He considered using Iron Man to go to SHIELD, but decided against it, as he didn’t want to overwhelm the poor man more. He signaled his AI to call Happy, who a few minutes later picked him up with his Audi. No one said he shouldn’t arrive in style after all.
He would have known if he was. It would be all over the news. Although, he didn’t have much time to check news reports while on the run-
He knew that Tony had designed the Captain’s floor in a way that would remind him of his past; it was warmer, homey with a wall full of old newspapers and photographs. Whereas the engineer’s apartment was more impersonal and practical. Steve knew for a fact that his bedroom looked brand-new every time he saw it. That was mostly due to the fact that Tony didn’t spend much time on his floor, mostly staying at his workshop or the communal floor.
“Tony..” he started placatingly. “I’m not in a gun fight right now, I don’t need a doctor and I’m mostly fine. I just have been shot.” he probably shouldn’t have said it that casually.
“The kid came to visit today.” The genius said without even greeting the other man, joy clear in his voice.
“Maybe I will, if you ask nicely.” he said smugly and knew that now Steve definitely blushed, if he hadn’t before already.
He explained, venom filling his words on the thought his father might be the reason his mum is dead.
On the way to SHIELD, he actually felt nervous. It’s not every day you meet your childhood celebrity crush.
He lied down on his make-shift cot and placed the battery next to him. He closed his eyes and tried to take a deep breath. He couldn’t; big part of his sternum had been removed to place the “life saving device”.
Tony laughed out loud and continued fixing the circuit board while happily chatting with one of his few friends.
At night, he laid on the bed of his childhood room, placed his hands behind his head and concentrated on one certain person he hadn’t talked to for far too long.
Steve did talk about the war, though not often. He would describe his adventures with his team without never mentioning their names or locations.
Tony looked ahead as well and they stayed there, silent once again. “You know, it’s hard for me to look at night sky the same way I did before.” he almost whispered.
His dreams that night consisted of him in his workshop back in Malibu talking to a man, whose face he could not see. He felt at home, not because he was in his house, but because that man somehow made him feel safe, secure.
After they prepared the meal, they had a peaceful lunch with his mother, Howard pleasantly gone to a business trip. In the afternoon, he and Maria played a little piano, which reminded him of when he was younger and more carefree.
Their first kiss as a married couple was chaste, but filled with so much love and bone deep happiness, Tony thought it was going to overwhelm his weak heart.
The blond really didn’t want to hang up. Getting the other man to talk so freely to him wasn’t an every day occurrence. But he had been running on 3 hours of sleep the last five days, which wasn’t healthy, even for a super soldier, so maybe he did need to get some rest.
He almost didn’t notice Bucky coming up next to him, but only almost, thanks to the super soldier serum.
Steve was positively beaming as he gently placed his hand on Tony’s chin so he could look directly into his eyes.
“I’ve been in love with you for longer than I remember. When I woke up... I panicked. I thought I was being set up, I was afraid... I was afraid that everything I spent with you was a dream. Or a delusion of sorts, a plan of Hydra. Then Captain Fury explained, showed me proof and I realized that I was at the era you were.
“Anything for you.” Steve said as he turned to look at Tony. He hadn’t realized how close the other man was sitting and now their faces were inches apart. Tony looked deep into his azure eyes and then his eyes wandered down to his lips. They were so close he could feel Steve's breath on his lips.
That was to be expected, of course, because Steve’s floor was too personalized. Filled with old photographs and reminders of his past. They wanted something to make
Tony knew he was from Brooklyn. Even if he hadn’t told him, the accent gave it away. But he’d never told the genius where he had been stationed. Maybe it was for the better. He probably didn’t want him to search information about his dead soulmate.
“Steve, daddy was angry at you, but he told me many, many stories about you. He said you were a good team.” Morgan said careful, trying not to hurt the big man again.
have watched them. Well, I made you watch them. But you said you enjoyed them!” he continued rambling happily.
“Nat isn’t going anywhere, you can finish it tomorrow.” he continued. “And you couldn’t have caught Clint on time. It wasn’t your fault Tony and you know it. He read the coordinates wrong and we are very lucky he’s still alive, but his fall wasn’t your fault.”
Reluctantly, he walked back to his bed. He had made a mess, sheets untucked, blanket thrown onto the floor, his pillow was drenched with tears.
A second later he added “Sam is calling my name from our camping site. Can I go or will you not be able to last a second without me?”
“Tony...” the Butler cut him off. “I’m not your father. You know I’m always more than willing to listen to your work progress, but you know what I’m asking about.”
“He really is. None of us would be here without him.” he said with a fond look on his face although his mind supplied him with flashbacks of that final battle.
“Anthony... look at me.” Jarvis said and Tony opened his eyes a couple of seconds later and looked at the man that was more family than his actual parents at that point.
As he was told, he bee-lined to the kitchen, opened the fridge and took a bottle of water. Meanwhile, he started brewing some coffee.
Tonight, though, was special, because the sky looked like it was on fire. One of the most enchanting sunsets Tony had ever seen in his life. It was a beautiful mix of yellows, blues, oranges and reds that made the view look like a painting. That’s why the genius walked straight to the railing when the elevator doors opened. He couldn’t take his eyes away from the sky. He even considered taking the iron man suit to get a closer look to that beauty.
He was gasping for air, but couldn’t get any. He felt like he was going to suffocate. His hands were trembling manically against his head and his pulse wouldn’t calm down. He didn’t even notice the hot tears streaming from his eyes.
Ten seconds later the door opened and Steve walked in to find the engineer sitting on a stool, staring blankly at a piece of machinery that looked like widow’s bites.
Most people enjoyed dancing. Some of them professionally, like Tony, who was taught ballroom-dancing from a young age, so that he could attend his parent’s galas. Others were like Thor, who would jump uncoordinatedly to the beat of the music, but enjoy himself nevertheless. But not Steve. Because Steve never danced.
The dance itself didn’t look professional, the inexperienced Captain stumbling on his husband’s feet and both of them failing to synchronize. But they danced until there was no more song playing, until all the guests had left and it was just the two of them under the stars looking into each other’s eyes like it was the only thing that mattered in the world.
Steve didn’t say anything, but Tony knew he was listening; he could feel his presence, that-weirdly enough- comforting coldness. It seemed like the other man was waiting for him to speak.
“That’s when I understood the meaning of soulmates. I got frozen in the ice for almost seventy years, Tony. Seventy years! And where did that bring me? Right to you. This can’t be a coincidence. There’s a reason I survived the ice, a reason they found me now and not in a hundred years.
“He’s a teenager, you know. So, he thought it would be better to continue school as a normal kid; at least
He felt like crying, but he didn’t have any tears left. Why was he even trying? He’d be dead within the week anyway, if his captors didn’t kill him before that.
Btw I’m pretty sure Steve has mentioned his beard before but I really can’t remember when soooo let’s pretend he hasn’t oops
The next morning Steve lied on his stomach in Tony’s king sized bed while the other man lazily wrote equations with his finger on his bare back. It was definitely too early for Tony, the first rays of sun coloring the room, but he couldn’t find it in himself to care. He finally felt content.
“Wasn’t thinking about running, no.” he chuckled. “Come on, follow me.” he said while moving towards the exit of the lab.
“I could tell JARVIS to order take-out.” Tony replied while getting up, already shifting to a happier demeanor.
He begged till he couldn’t feel anything from the other side of the bond. The connection was cut off.
“Which is...” he pushed on impatiently. He had so much many problems in his mind he didn’t need Captain Hook bugging him.
He was observing the other man with a fond look, while the Captain was doing a competition with Thor as to who will fit the most marshmallows in his mouth, after Clint’s request, of course.
Tony did follow Steve’s advice. First thing next morning he called Obadiah giving him permission to handle all the corporational bullshit while he did what he loved. How that turned out in the future is another matter.
“Me too, but I wouldn’t want to have it any other way.” his soon-to-be husband replied and even though Tony couldn’t see him, he knew he was smiling.
The elevator dinged and Tony walked in his workshop. He placed his plate and mug on the work table and sat on a stool.
Happy opened the car door for him and Tony threw him a small smile as he walked away from the car and into the SHIELD facility. A guard at the entrance asked for his ID and proceeded to point where Fury’s office supposedly was.
He looked at his reflection on the workshop walls and sighed. He would probably have to change from his greasy Iron Maiden t-shirt if he were to meet a national icon.
The elevator ride was quiet, a nervous energy very prominent in the confined space. When they reached Tony’s floor, the two men went straight for the couch and sat there silently looking at each other for a few moments.
“It’s normal for soulmates to fight sometimes. You’re both just human. But you should remember that there is a reason God mended your souls, a reason why you’re better off together than alone. You can stand up for yourself and fight if you feel like you have to, but at the end of the day you should remember that you’re a team. You should fight together against the problem, not against  each other.” The older man advised him.
This story has finally come to its end. I started posting a year ago, I lost my beta so I stopped, but couple of weeks ago I realized how much joy this story had brought me, so I had to post everything else. Thank you so much for following this journey and supporting my fic by leaving kudos and comments, yall really made my days better<3 Hope you enjoy the last chapter!
“Nooo” Morgan wailed, hitting Steve with her little hands for emphasis. “It wouldn’t be the same without you anymore. They need you like I want my Mommy and Happy and Uncle Rhodey. “
Talking to Steve became sort of a habit. Sometimes they wouldn’t happen to talk for a few weeks- it wasn’t really a choice- but having someone to talk to often enough was refreshing.
The Captain immediately stood up walking towards Tony as if he was enchanted. The genius guessed he was impressed by his uncanny resemblance to Howard.
This world may not need Steve Rogers as Captain America anymore, but Steve Rogers needs this new world he has come to love. The world has enough heroes at this point, he can finally rest and just be Steve, a guy from Brooklyn.
He looked beside him and saw a brunette, blue eyes, presumably in her thirties, with a sharp look in her face.
Tony huffed out a bitter laugh. “He definitely wasn’t, he... you would have hated him. He was... quite manipulative. It was hard for me to gather the courage to break up with him, but Steve helped me.”
Tony laughed, but followed the instruction.  “Hi Jarvis.” He said softly. The older man placed the knife he was holding on the cutting board and turned to hug Tony.
“I really am.” Steve answered truthfully. “Everything is perfect, Shellhead. Thank you, you didn’t have to go that far for me.”
Tony wore a black suit and a red tie with golden stripes. Steve picked a dark blue suit with a dark red bow tie for himself.
Tears collected in Tony’s eyes and a sob escaped his lips. “I.. I had to be there.” he stammered through his tears. “He-he was counting on me.”
His hair was a mess, his unkempt beard very prominent. At that moment, looking at his tear stained cheeks and red eyes, he realized he had been crying the whole time.
“I don’t want this to be an one time thing. I don’t want to pretend nothing happened. I’m so in love with you. I have been for quite some time now. I want to go on dates with you and wake up every morning next to you.” the blond continued.
“Maybe you’re right.” Tony admitted, rubbing a hand over his face. He looked over to Steve again. Now the competition was over and most of the guests were dancing on the dance floor. The Captain was sitting on the couch alone observing everyone with a joyful look. Tony wanted Steve to always look this happy.
“Are there more bad guys now?” the little girl inquired, her big doe eyes looking curiously at the older man.
“Everyone expects me to adjust in the 21st century like nothing happened. And I think I’m doing a good job with the Avengers helping me, with you by my side. It’s just... sometimes I miss how much easier everything used to be.”
“You know, when I saw her for the first time in this century, she told me she had moved on. She talked about her husband and her grandchildren. Told me it’s time for me to move on as well. If I go back to her now, I’m depriving another version of her of the future that she should have, and that’s not fair.”
Hello there! I’m sorry I took so long, but I’m really stressed these days. Again, disclaimer, I do have a bias towards Tony, so I am kinda supporting his side (at least when it comes to the whole secret thing).
He felt himself laughing to a joke his soulmate had said and even though he couldn’t see his expression, he knew he was smiling, too. The man in his dream, who he supposed was Steve, due to the voice, had dishwater blonde hair, broad soldiers and delicate long fingers. He wondered if his love actually fit to that description. Shame he’d never find out.
Tony always charmed the guests with his charisma and dancing skills. Nat would dance with Clint who always stepped on her foot and earned himself a death glare. Thor, whenever he was on earth, would chat amicably with the guests, feeling fascinated by the midgardians. Even Bruce would make small-talk with fellow scientists, enjoying himself in his own way.
“It’s not the same.” she repeated in a tiny trembling voice that broke Steve’s heart. He stroked her hair lightly as she took some deep breaths.
He didn’t even bother to move from his spot on the couch nor did he open his eyes. He fell asleep with his mind repeating Tony’s intelligent rambling. He may have not understood much, but the excitement painting the brunette’s voice was enough to set him to a gentle sleep.
“So..” he started with a mischievous glint on his blue eyes. Tony looked at him with a soft smile on his face. “So?” he prompted.
“If anything goes wrong, there is a guard by the corner.” She said warily and pointed her head to an agent not too far away.
When they reached their destination, he took a deep breath and closed his eyes for a second. When he had composed himself, he opened his eyes and slipped his sunglasses on.
“After the wormhole, I mean. I still have nightmares about it, you know? But who am I kidding, I still have nightmares about Afghanistan too, and it’s been quite some time. I know it’s stupid-“ Tony rumbled but Steve cut him off, “It really isn’t”.
Tony wasn’t sure he wanted to tell his long time friend but-Jarvis was the only one that called him today and he felt lonely.
He was convinced the Captain would be disappointed when he actually talked to Tony, as he would realize he doesn’t resemble his father that much after all.
“I’m afraid your access has been denied, Captain.” Steve got up from the spot he had been sitting on for the last 40 minutes, with his back against the lab’s glass wall.
Steve turned around and hugged him for a moment. How could I leave this man alone. I’m not the only one that went through this loss, we all did. He thought grimly.
Strange never saw Tony like this, always confined to the rules of silence that bind a classroom. Strange liked it, he liked it a lot. Tony was so bright, everything coming out of his mouth sounded like soft bells. Signaling something inside Strange. Strange tried to contribute to the conversation, but every time Tony fluttered his lashes at him Strange found it hard to breathe.
. He had been plaguing Tony’s dreams since New York. Thanos was what Tony looked over his shoulder for, the reason he built suit after suit after suit. Until he had his own personal army of suits just in case and here Stephen was talking about just taking the alien out as if it was nothing more than a pest problem. So confident and arrogant.
Which is why he was currently sparring with Natasha. She had been having trouble sleeping and wearing her out was the best way to put her to bed. Ever since she was a teen. Bucky often looked at Natasha in a maternal way. He had never thought about it often, being maternal. HYDRA did everything they could to remove his omega. Every gland, organ and hormone. Heat and pregnancy were unnecessary risks to their prized assassin.
Nick just rolled his eye and continued to navigate traffic. After several minutes of Carol knocking down Fury a couple pegs, she had read through the Avengers files. Interested in a task force on her own home planet. She did miss Earth. She had just gotten it back when she was forced to leave again. She wanted to be home again.
Strange had only left the sanitarium because Wong had finished up all the grounded coffee last night. And of course he didn’t have the money to pick some up from around the corner. Strange just rolled his eyes as Wong just shrugged. So he dressed like a normal person within modern society. His Cloak of Levitation had taken up shape shifting into whatever outerwear he could get away with to come along with Strange. Usually it took the form of a beanie, mittens, a scarf- today it had chosen a red tie.
She shook her head. “It’s not forever, Steve. I need time to answer questions I have for myself. To find a sense of peace with what I did.” She said softly. She opened her arms and Steve almost collapsed in her grasp.
He also noticed that Tony’s scent lingered pretty heavily on the wizard on the very rare occasion that he showed up with Jan to talk to Fury. Like today.
“This is a trap.” Strange’s voice said, and he sounded nervous. Very different from the indifference he carried in his voice. He was looking straight at the spaceships and the wormhole.
He stood and set his own glass on the porch ledge and went back into his kitchen, taking another glass out and pouring whiskey in. He made his way out to the porch again, holding the glass out as Carol Danvers stood on his porch. She gave him a grin and took the glass.
“What the hell was that?” Tony was the first to ask, his voice small and soft. He was still in the air, struggling a little to balance but it was enough to bring him closer to Jan and Stephen.
“So.” Carol said when half of her food was gone from her plate. She looked at Tony with a twinkle in her eyes. “Doc’s appointment today, huh?”
By the time Steve came back from throwing the rag in the hamper, Tony was a little more coherent. Tony made grabby hands, Steve smiled as he slide in next to Tony who buried his head against Steve’s bare chest.
. Waiting in bread lines, scrounging for medicine or food. It was a different kind of survival than the Avengers. He chooses to put himself in the line of fire. Surviving
“I don’t even know if the man wants kids, Jan. Or to be in a pack, let alone be the alpha of one! It’s a lot, plus-” Tony stopped himself. Jan raised an eyebrow as a signal for him to continue. “I don’t think I’ve really dealt and moved on from Steve. I do like Stephen. But I don’t want to drag him into whatever
Tony breathed in the Italian countryside. Miles and miles of tall grass with the cost barely in view in the horizon. The house was everything Tony wanted. It was more of a manor. The manor was two stories and was in the shape of a U. The courtyard was made of sun bleached bricks which eventually faded into the grass and the grounds that led into the gardens. It was old, and needed some work but Tony knew exactly what he wanted to do with his new sanctuary.
The omega quickly shoved those feelings down as deep as he could. There were bigger things to worry about, an alien invasion that has been haunting his dreams and a baby. He needed time to get used to not having his pack, to move to California and start the West Coast Avengers. It just was not a good time to explore a new romance, but that rationale alone pained Tony. Even if the wound from Steve and his pack was still intense and open, a part of his mind drifted to the What If’s. What if he had pursued Stephen in their school days, what if he tried now?
“Act as normal as possible while putting out feelers for the daughters.” Stephen said with conviction. The former doctor’s eyes looked down at Tony, a soft light in them. “Relax until we find a suitable lead.” The group looked around, eyes scanning the others for any better ideas against an overpowered mad space titan.
Jan sighed, emotionally preparing to argue with Natasha about Tony. “Look, Romanoff I’ve told Rogers plenty of times to f-” Jan stopped when Natasha held out her hand, in it was a red envelope.
“You destroyed the Chitauri fleet, single handedly.” Carol explained as she cocked her head. “That’s no easy feat, word traveled fast of Earth’s greatest defender. The great Merchant of Death.”
“It’s Doctor Strange.” Stephen corrected her. Jan slid off the stool she had sat on and shrugged her shoulder.
“They got me!” Tony yelled into his com, sounding out of breath. Under all of that Jan could tell that Tony was
She quickly entered her penthouse. She grabbed her suitcase and purse with her keys and wallet. She came back out and closed the door behind her. She turned to Steve  and looked him in the eyes.
“I don’t have my wallet.” Tony explained to the teen girl working the cash register. She gave him a sympathetic smile. Tony turned with his head hanging low in defeat before an arm pushed by Tony’s head with a card in it’s hand.
you, Tony.” Steve said in a hush voice, but it sounded deep and threatening. Tony’s spine tingled in excitement and Tony licked his lips in anticipation.
Tony got out of the car and looked at Pepper who’s eyes looked concerned. Pepper knew Tony too well, she was a wonderful alpha. Tony walked up to Pepper and smiled at her.
They walked a few blocks in silence before reaching an old looking building. They followed the wizard inside, looking around the brick stone building. It was old, ancient. It had the same energy they had all felt when the wizard had used the stone. It was in the wood, it was in the air how old the building was. The modern omegas felt so out of place, like they had walked back in time.  The alpha led them up the grand staircase, not really giving them time to look at the halls and artifacts trapped in glass boxes.
is there to talk about Steve? What?” Tony egged him on, his hands shaking. “You cheated on me, fucked behind my back. There’s no coming back from this, Steve. There isn’t. I deserve better.”
.” She snarled, taking a step closer to Steve whose nose was only inches away from her weaponized hand. Steve raised his hands in surrender.
“Cool. Should be fun, right Stephen?” Carol asked the wizard who looked a little startled. The wizard narrowed his eyes at Carol, who only smiled more at him. “It’s world’s colliding! That has to be exciting.”
Tony looked at Jan with raised eyebrows and pink on his cheeks. “And what? I forgot my wallet, he happened to be there and he paid for me. Wormhole opened and here we are.” Tony said, keeping it short.
Tony schooled his face to have less surprise written on it. Tony’s mind was racing with a million thoughts. Who were the aliens? What did they want? How many of the Avengers were deployed? Who the hell was Stephen Stephen? He wasn’t the aloof Alpha he was at boarding school. No, this Stephen was...wiser, older, more in control. This was an
“I hate you.”  She said as she sat her drink down and went to greet the god. “I hate your smug eyebrows too.”
“Tony!” The Wasp jerked forward, almost as if to jump in front of Iron Man but War Machine held her back. Carol felt dread fill her not knowing if she managed to save
Tony shook his head at those thoughts. They had chosen where their loyalty lies. There wasn’t much use giving it deeper thought.
So here Tony was, fighting alien spaceships with an ex-classmate who is now a wizard and a lady from space who lights up like the sun. The fight was going pretty okay, other than the targeted attack on him. But Stephen had stepped in, the alpha had protected
Jarvis took his disappointment for sadness, “You shouldn’t worry about that now, Tony. You have your whole life ahead of you. And I’m sure your soulmate does, too.”
Though, the reception afterwards was a completely different situation. It still had a classy tone, but everyone was loose from the abundance of alcohol and tasteful music. It took place in a prairie near the ceremony settings, where they exchanged their vows. The scenery was breath-taking. They had set big tents and filled the space they had cleared with tables and lanterns. The pale candle lights looked magical combined with the soft colors of the sunset.
Meanwhile Steve looked around the genius’s suite in wonder. It wasn’t the first time he’d been there, but it didn’t fail to amaze him every single time. Apart from the breathtaking view, as Tony’s floor was one of the highest in the building, the technology that decorated the apartment seemed surreal.
“Who cares” replied Tony and then promptly opened the door of the balcony and lead Steve to the back exit of the ballroom.
Without even looking up he managed to dodge the flying bottle that ended up broken on the office’s door.
Suddenly the music changed to a song from the 40s, Tony had made sure to include songs from all the decades in the mix, but especially from Steve’s time. It was the perfect timing to make a move.
“Everything’s okay, stop worrying, you mother hen.” he said jokingly and heard the blond huff in amusement.
He did tell Jarvis, though. He really had to talk to someone about it and since he didn’t have any actual friends at the boarding school, he thought his butler was his best choice. Jarvis was happy about him and even admitted that his wife, Ana, who had passed away a couple of years ago, was his soulmate.
Steve almost got up when suddenly his happy demeanor shifted and he forcefully pulled his arm back. “Tony..” he said with a stern look on his face.
He found joy on having someone actually willing to listen to him. Steve could cut the bond off any time he wanted, but he never did. The ‘so called connection’ could last from minutes to even a couple of hours or until one of them cut it off.
Tony felt like crying. He was too lucky to have Jarvis in his life. He, also, braced himself to ask a far more important question.
“Yeah everything’s fine.” Steve gritted through his teeth, the tweezers hitting a particularly sensitive spot.
“He’ll get better, don’t stress yourself about it.” she said as saw the defeated look on Tony’s face. “You know he doesn’t blame you for falling-“ she started.
He could feel his heart thrumming from excitement. Steve was one of his closest friends at that point and the prospect of meeting him felt like a dream.
And Bucky is back, which is a miracle by itself. A part of his past is still here, alive, he’s not alone. He knows, of course, that it isn’t the same Bucky he knew before, but he still has him.
Tony chuckled softly at his old-fashioned manners. “By all means.” he replied and Steve closed the distance between them.
“Look, it was a hard mission and everyone is tired. Natasha knows I got shot, but I told her the bullet was out. There’s no need to bother anyone right now. I’ve done worse things than remove a bullet.” Steve sighed, exhaustion clear in his voice.
“It’s-it’s not that bad. I mean, the-there were thousands of contestants and-“ he could feel his heart thumping in his chest.
So, it came to him as the most natural thing in the world, while he waited in the elevator, to take out the burner phone and call Steve.
Tony didn’t need to be told a second time before he ran to his bedroom upstairs. He closed the door and fell on his knees, his back against it.
“You know me so well.” he replied but his voice had a sort of gentleness to it. “Now, go get your beauty sleep.”
. I know what I’m asking, please Natasha.” Steve sobbed. Steve honestly didn’t know if he was referring to Tony or Bucky.  Natasha’s face remained neutral but she made no motion to move.
Normally, this would be pack responsibility. To take the pack omega into their nest and comfort them, they responded best with physical contact and familiar scents. Which seemed to work, while Tony was still emotional he wasn’t shaking, that was a positive sign.
of yours…” Tony started as he and Stephen ate breakfast together. Like they always did, Tony would always wake up to breakfast already made. Tony still didn’t understand how Stephen had managed to make healthy pregnancy food so god damn delicious. It was probably the cosmetic knowledge.
Steve felt tears form in his eyes. He had known Nat since he got out of the ice, she was the first friend he ever made out of the ice. She introduced him to Tony. She was always calm, collected, never snapped. Now, she was wild in the eyes. Tears on her cheeks as she kicked her legs in the air to get out of the omega’s hold. And this was his fault. Natasha broke because of him, the pack Alpha.
“The ships are mostly blocking the view, they’ve created a wall. I can’t see through it.” Carol gritted out as she zipped through the middle of the thickest cluster of the ships, causing any one of them to touch her to crash and burn.
, so is this puppy green-lit or what?” Jan asked. Fury shut the binder and pushed it back toward Jan. “I know you’ve been gunning for this, Fury. It's a win for the both of us.”
“Got something for me, Nick?” She asked, a little excitement in her voice. Carol had always been a little of an adrenaline junky. Nick shrugged his shoulders and sat in his chair and looked at her with challenge.
“He’s headed back to California, permanently.” Natasha said as she slipped into the common room of the Avengers compound in New York. The remnant of what was once her pack haunting her as it was just Steve and Bucky in the room. There was once a time where it was filled with more people and laughter. Natasha didn’t allow herself to feel loss, she didn’t
The Cloak had seemed to agree. It had been pulling against Strange, like it was trying to get to the omega. Strange simply just continued to follow and listen to the omega. He sat in a daze as Tony talked animatedly, gesturing with his hands and laughing at his own jokes.
Carol wanted to let the Wasp finish, she was enjoying this conversation. It felt nice, almost like having friends. Carol missed having friends, the deep vastness of space left little to do but survive. That was a deeper and more depressing thought that was fit more for a lonely night.
Bucky pulled Natasha off Steve by wrapping his arms around her waist and using all his super soldier strength. Natasha flailed and struggled against him,
Carol and Tony hadn’t spent too much time alone together. Carol had been the one mostly doing deep space searches. She would come back once a month for Fury’s report. Exploring deep space left little time to get to know one’s teammates. In the time that they did spend together, Tony had liked Carol very much.
“Wasp!” Tony yelled, diving down to catch his friend. Jan reached a hand out as she spun her way down, one wing fluttering as fast as it could to keep her in the air.
. Steve dismissed it, Steve had only seconds before the elevator made its way to its destination. “I’m not saying let’s go back, I’m saying let’s fix it. I’m devoted to you. Tony Stark. I’ll get down on my knees right here for you. Anything to keep you.”
Thank you for all the comments!! I really didn't think it would get such activity! I hope you guys enjoy :)
That’s not anyone’s fault, of course. But it was different. Steve thinks that’s why he fell into this
Being back in New York after the California countryside made Tony want to scrub his skin clean, the air here was terrible. But he was here to get his divorce and immediately return to his small paradise. It had only been three weeks since Tony left and he hadn’t spoken a single word to his ex pack, what was there to say? Pepper, Rhodey and Tony entered the elevator of Stark Tower and headed up to the conference floor.
Luckily, Strange was enough to keep Tony safe until they reached Tony’s dorm. Tony had silently led the way to his dorm. Tony unlocked the door and opened it, he went to walk in but turned to look at the alpha.
Steve didn’t have the time to process Jan’s stinger being pointed in his face before she moved it slightly to his left and fired off a shot right beside his ear. Steve flinched to his right only to see Jan point at him again.
As soon as Carol slowed her flying to a full stop a couple feet in front of the ship on the outside point of the cluster. The ships looked like a stereotypical flying saucer, which made Carol laugh inside. In all her years of space adventures, not one real alien race had ships that looked like Frisbee. Carol opened her mouth to introduce herself and this world, but the ship she was in front of dropped a blaster from their ship and fired a shot directly at Carol. No hesitation.
Before Tony could implore more about Christine, Carol came walking into the kitchen. Her eyes barely awake and her feet were sluggish. She had returned from her deep space scouting two days ago, she had been asleep until now. She wordlessly grabbed two plates full of Stephen's breakfast and sat down at the kitchen table with them.
Natasha’s wet eyes looked at Steve who just slumped forward, and Bucky was silent. Natasha took a deep breath in and held it. What was there to say? What were they thinking? Tony let out a sign, he was exhausted. He sat back down in his seat, welcoming Pepper’s hands over his and squeezing it.
When Tony Stark loves, he loves hard, he loves with his soul. It was something precious and Jan had been protecting Tony Stark’s since boarding school and she failed him.
The last time Tony saw Stephen Strange it was at the boarding school Tony’s parents had sent him to in his teens. Jan had tagged along with. Stephen Strange was in his last year at the school during his and Jan’s first year. He had a couple of math classes with Strange, they even chatted in class now and again. He had been one of the few nice people at the school. Always studying for something.
Just as back in boarding school, he had always enjoyed being in the presence of the alpha. He could keep up with Tony’s fast paced genius talk at three in the morning. He liked sitting outside in the mornings, right after he woke up and had a fresh cup of tea in his hand. Tony, Strange and whoever wanted to tag along with them would sit outside and talk. Enjoying the cool mornings, making sure Tony see’s
, Maria, you are allowed to wear other shoes.” Howard would grumble almost angry, but more concerned as he put on new band aids for her. Maria giggled and reached over and pinched Tony’s little cheek.
Now, Tony was no means jealous. You can’t get jealous of a woman who had a brief relationship with a man who
, isn’t it.” Tony hummed as he looked up at the house again. Tony turned back to the wizard who looked nervous. “Is everything okay?” Tony asked, immediately alerted. Was his pack in trouble?
Clint slowly rose up from his position and slumped against his black chair. “But Steve is crazy hot, and Tony is crazy sexy. This is so not fair! I haven’t got laid in, like, a month.” Clint grumbled. Both Natasha and Bucky laughed.
“Recon for what?” The Wasp asked, looking between War Machine and Carol. Floating around like a fairy.
“Someone who was after the tesseract.” Tony said, as if putting a puzzle together and was damn near close to finishing it.
A bit of doubt crept up in Tony, he had thought his pack would tell him and look where he is now. Tony shook it off, Jan was his oldest friend. They’d been terrorizing the elite class together since before they could walk. Plus, Jan was always telling Tony she didn't like Bucky. Tony had always found it odd, Bucky was nice to him and Jan, he was always just a little quiet. Tony knew now to always trust Jan’s instincts.
There's going to be more pack suffering I promise!! I really hope you guys are liking this fic! Thank you for all the comments!! I read them all, I never reply because I'm so shy and don't want to bother anyone :^)
Steve and Bucky had been sharing kisses in dark corners, Steve whispering in Bucky’s ear at night. Promising of asking Tony about a second omega. It was a rush for both of them, it was fun. Natasha was the first of the pack to catch them.
“I am.” She said, sticking to the facts. Steve tensed, unshed tears in his blue eyes. “Not forever.” She tried to comfort him, but the statement was still true.
Tony was looking straight into Steve’s blue eyes when Steve opened his eyes back up. The elevator dinged and Steve heard the doors slide open. Tony yanked his hands back and gave Steve a once over before slipping on his sunglasses.
“I can talk with Fury then.” Jan said, her face in the fridge as she put away the milk and eggs. “I’m sure he’ll jump at the chance to expand his hold.
“No, no, it’s okay. Your dad and I had a disagreement, but in the end it didn’t matter who was right and who was wrong. The only thing that really mattered was that we weren’t there for each other when it counted. Truth is I am better when he’s by my side, when he was-“ he said honestly.
“Mommy said he saved the universe, he’s a hero!” she added excitedly although more tears escaped her eyes.
“Are you hurt? What’s going on? Are you in a battlefield right now? Oh my god did you call me during a gun fight? How can I help? I can send you whichever medical specialist you need.” Tony started blabbing.
. He was a man with a magnet on his chest that played superhero in a metal suit marrying a super soldier who was more than 90 years old. If someone had told him any of that ten years prior he would have laughed in their face.
He was sitting at a table filled with vets, old war buddies, but when he caught Tony’s eye, the adoring look on his face was unmistakable. He kindly excused himself from his older company and walked towards his husband.
“Well then, see you tomorrow.” he said and ended the call after hearing  Steve hum softly in agreement.
They stayed like this for some time. Could have been minutes, could have been hours, they wouldn’t have been able to tell. They only knew that they felt contempt in each other’s arms, the first rays of sunlight painting their skin.
The friendship between the two men only grew stronger. Even the other team-members started noticing that things weren’t strictly friendly between them anymore.
Even when he was on the run, he had managed to take a small notebook with him and draw a little while the others were busy. Small sketches of his newly formed team, but also his other teammates, well, mostly Tony. He could continue his beloved hobby, maybe take up some classes.
“Well, you won’t believe it, but a pretty blond I know happens to be camping in the outskirts of Sirmione.” Tony admitted.
“And the Captain is a great guy, as far as I know, he can make you happy. I can see the way you look at him.” he continued.
Finding Bucky was never part of the plan. Steve went to therapy, accepted his omega was gone and had moved on with his life. He had met Tony and the world had color again. Tony was bright, nice and everything good in the world. Tony was the reason Steve woke and got up in the morning. Tony brought in the Avengers as a pack and it was perfect. Tony was everything.
Also I've been meaning to say that the title of this fic is named after a song and the chapter in quotations are lyrics. It's by Glass Animals, 100% recommend those mad lads.
“How do you feel about joining the Avengers Initiative?” He asked, it was only fitting. She was the beginning spark of this wild forest fire that was the Avengers Initiative. Carol looked at him, her eyes wide and eyebrows touching her hairline in shock and amazement. She let out a loud laugh and spilled her drink a little.
“Already sent to our legal team to look over.” Pepper said from her battle station behind her keyboard.
“I liked Strange, back at the academy. He was good to you.” Jan's said softly. “It’s why I agreed to keep his secrets. An alpha that didn’t take advantage of an omega in heat. We can trust him.”
I'M BACK AND I OFFICALLY HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I GOT IT YES BITHCES!!!!!!! CHOCOLATE VINILLA SWIRTH WITH COOKIE CRUNCH PLEASE !!!!!!!
.” Jan said with a wave of her hands. “You’re Tony Goddamn Stark! Completely revolutionized both the weapon industry and green energy by the time you were 22! You’re only 25! Sure, the bonding is an issue for now. But after Peanut is born?” Jan said with such gusto Tony was almost taken aback. He wished he had as much confidence as Jan had in him.
seem that the West Avengers were heading toward pack direction. Tony couldn’t deny the chemistry between all of them. They were comfortable with each other and it was so
“There’s nothing there Jan, even if there was-” Jan clapped her hands and squealed at the statement. “-
“Then we start shooting back.” Stephen said in that deep voice that Tony remembered from their school days. The same deep voice he found comfort in when his very first heat started.
“Sorry, Iron Man.” Jan said. Tony knew she wasn’t sorry at all. As Tony took off into the New York sky, so did Stephen. It wasn’t until Stephen was zipping around just as fast as Tony that the omega believed the cloak could make the alpha fly.
“Stark. Van Dyne.” A deep voice rumbled from behind them. Both omegas jumped and turned to see the alpha in blue robes, his feet not touching the ground as his red cape blew gently in the wind. He looked at them with a raised eyebrow.
Tony nodded in agreement. The alpha did take charge like it was as easy as breathing. He slipped in and out of the roll with such ease, and he knew when to pull back his control. Steve had a hard time letting go of control, it was one of the major roadblocks between Steve and Jan. It warmed Tony inside to see Jan and Stephen work so well together, it warmed him to see their friendship bloom. It was just like how he and Jan fantasize about when they were younger. To be in a pack together. It had been such a fight with Steve and Jan. But with Stephen, everything was so simple.
Bucky came home a couple hours later, after finally finishing his paperwork. He smelled fresh soup as soon as he opened the door. Bucky dropped his gym back on the floor, and walked deeper into the apartment. Steve was leaning against the black counter tops, eating a banana in black sweatpants. Bucky smiled and walked up to Steve and gave him a kiss on the cheek.
omg I hope you guys enjoy the chapter! This has been super fun to write thank you all for being so supportive <3 <3 <3
“I think the question is do you think we can convince him.” Tony countered, putting his hands in his pockets.
. Jan flung the door open with one hand and activated her widget with the other, holding it up and aiming right for Steve’s head without a single hesitation.
Strange wrapped a shoulder around Tony and gently walked him away from the class room and toward the omega dormitories. He held the omega tight against him, trying his hardest to remain in the friendship area of touch. Strange didn’t want Tony thinking he was going to help Tony through his heat, he just wanted the kid safe.
. Her energy brought life into Tony’s dark, still world. It was warm, familiar. It reminded Tony that this wasn’t the end, he had a life before Steve and he’ll have one after. Jan was a testament to that.
is the reaction Tony had hoped for when he saw his first positive pregnancy test. It was supposed to be exciting,
. Jan wasn’t stupid she knew what this meant. And if Natasha was calling her then that means they all knew. Jan noticed a tear on her phone screen as she kept staring at Rhodey’s text.
“And you know, between you and me-” Jan said as she brought her hoard back to the cutting board. “The West Avengers seem to be headed toward pack direction.”
He grabbed Natasha  who was holding onto the knife in Bucky’s back with her life, knowing the more Steve pulled her the more it would hurt Bucky. Bucky ran toward the wall and slammed the window into it. Natasha let out a should and let go of the knife. Bucky backed up as fast as he could when he felt Natasha let go of him.
Jan nodded, wrapping an arm around Tony's shoulder and led him downstairs. Rhodey and Pepper were at the kitchen island, where most of the sunlight seeped through in the house. Pepper was on the phone with his computer in front of her while Rhodey was looking through paperwork.
Tomorrow they would hunt down Strange and get answers out of him. Then they would address the aliens and Tony could finally go back to California and start
“We mustn't let the wolves see us bleed.” Was all she said, booping the end of Tony’s nose. It wasn’t until Steve came back with Bucky did Tony finally understand what his mother meant, what all her nuggets of wisdom meant.
Hope everyone is staying inside and stay safe, we're in this together!! Thank you all again <3 <3 <3 <3
. She was clapping rapidly and hopping from one foot to the other, not being able to still herself even for a second.
The trio was dressed to the nines, mostly to be intimidating. Jan had agreed, she had even fueled and hyped him up, having a hand in picking everything out with Tony. Tony wore very fitting, flared out slacks with a fitting black satin blouse that made a sharp v in the middle of his chest, a black suit, and a big black hat that one would see omega’s wear to funerals.
. Not the type of person to go head on against Thanos’s army. Not because he was omega but because despite his genius he seemed just like anybody else. Carol furrowed her eyebrows. This was just some kid, barely into his early twenties.
“Huh.” Carol said as he looked over Tony Stark’s page. She skimmed through it but read the small paragraph of the New York attack.
And of course Tony was everything Maria taught him to be. A wonderful host and an even better wife. Tony did everything
“Captain Marvel is correct.” Strange’s voice came through, he sounded the oldest of all of them. Carol held off her own offensive plans and waited. “I do not sense sentient life. These ships are empty.”
“Watch out, Strange. As soon as I figure out the sling ring, I’m coming for your job.” Jan teased, walking over to Tony and dropped into the empty seat next to him.
prior about it, the Stark's had finally picked a school to send their omega son to. Strange found it disgusting, really. People plotting to take advantage of a kid, wanting to squeeze out money and clout. Strange knew he himself would eventually end up networking and forcing friendships to climb up the medical world later, he had no illusions about that, but Strange did have limits. Strange was above swindling the trust of an omega kid. Stephan was a good alpha, with a backbone. So Strange didn’t pay much attention to any talk of Tony Stark, not even when Stark did finally arrive and the whole school would not shut up about it. Strange just never looked up from his books.
“Next time I shoot that omega of yours.” Jan said in a voice that once sounded like a friend Steve knew, but now they were strangers. Jan turned straight and walked away from Steve, not giving him a look back. They could raid her penthouse all they wanted, nothing there would lead them to Tony.
Natasha turned and pushed against Steve’s body to give her the momentum to jump and meet the Winter Soldier, who was running to Steve’s aid. Natasha wrapped her thighs around Bucky’s face and proceeded to stab Bucky in the back. Bucky let out a cry and that’s when Steve was pulled out of his shock.
“You and Bucky have a thing for my ass.” Tony commented. Steve chuckled, pulling Tony’s cheeks apart.
Only a second after staring Tony could see what looked like a portal tear open in the sky. Against the Earth’s blue sky was a hole that was black and twinkled with lights. Distant, foreign stars peaked through. Coming out of the hole was what looked like spaceships. Shaped like actual flying saucers.
But now with the progress of defeating Thanos’s, Stephen simply didn’t have the time for regular routine check ups. So he had been vetting potential doctors to help in the meantime and possible with Tony’s birth itself. Both Tony and Stephen had already meticulously planned Tony’s home birth. Tony had set aside a room just for anything medical related. The billionaire had spared no expense and Stephen had not been afraid to lead Tony in the best direction.
They had been tasked at keeping Fury in the loop of their plan, on the condition he told absolutely no one. The alpha had agreed and asked for monthly updates on the regular. The original Avengers had not been looped in. The West Coast Avengers figured they were already playing dangerously with the timeline as it is. The more they could keep people unaware the better.
“I will not only legally ruin you but I will hunt you down and blast your face off myself.” The threat jumped out of Pepper’s throat, soaked in venom. After that she simply sat in her chair and returned to her paperwork. It was a clear dismissal. One that surprisingly, Steve didn’t fight.
Hello! I am so sorry this took longer than usual! Things have been crazy at work, I'm an essential worker!! And school, everything went online and all my professors are super older so it's been a struggle. I hope you like the chapter!! I had fun writing it!
Tonight they were all going to bring blankets to the back deck and star gaze. Something he and Jan would do with Howard when they were children. Something Tony couldn’t wait to start with his own.
Tony thought as he stood in the doorway of his and Steve’s bedroom. This is what his mother meant, keep your breath, keep your poise,
Tony worked on something called BARF to help Bucky break out of the HYDRA brainwashing. It helped Bucky settle into the new timeline and everything had been going perfectly. Bucky worked himself into the pack without an issue. Natasha was happy to get her old mentor back and a ballet partner, Bucky even managed to spend time with Tony in his workshop.
Jan looked down at her diamond studded watch as Fury read the binder of a proposition for a new West Coast Avengers. Fury was taking his sweet time, at this rate Jan was going to miss their victory dinner after Tony gets his divorce papers.
The pep in Jan’s step slowed as Natasha stood right next to Fury’s door. She had a black duffle bag slug across her body and a red envelope in her hand. Jan slowly made her way toward the alpha. Natasha was one of the few alphas Jan actually liked and got along with. When things first unraveled Jan had a difficulty believing Natasha was complicit in any of it. It was obvious the alpha adored Tony. Maybe she had adored Bucky just a little more.
Tony’s heart began to race. A flutter formed in the omega, it was like there was a swarm of butterflies in his chest. Tony could feel the blood rush to his cheeks in anticipation for what, what did Tony anticipate? Or was he hoping for something from the alpha?
. He had really grown into his alphaness. His shoulders were broader and his body was so solid now, his voice had deepened and he knew how to handle himself. On the rare occasion Stephen had held Tony, the omega could tell Stephen knew how to handle an omega. It made something melt in Tony.
Steve didn’t stop for a while, just wanting to taste Tony now that he could. He tasted like salt and caramel, and Steve could not get enough of it. Tony let him, loving the tingles he felt every time Steve’s tongue made contact with his skin. After a while Tony pulled at Steve’s hair. Steve opened his eyes and lifted his head up. Tony pulled him into a soft kiss, a hand gently cupping Steve’s jaw. When they broke away, both Tony and Steve smiled. “I’m going to
” Tony’s words turned to mush as Steve added a second finger. Steve lifted his head so he could watch his fingers work in and out of Tony. Steve’s pointer finger and pinky moved Tony’s cheeks up and down, making his ass bounce as the two fingers between them dug out pleasure from Tony. Steve made a hungry
Tony shook the thoughts out of his head as he and Jan made their way out with books in their hands. Jan hailed them a cab and looked at him when they were seated in.
“Bet you thought about us every night, makin’ yourself come from thinking about me ‘n Buck fucking you. And you loving every second.”
Tony hummed at that. Stephen had been integrating himself well. The alpha was usually stand off and arrogant on the best of days, even back in their youth. But Tony had seen Stephen slowly soften up to the new pa-. To the new
Maria Stark was a woman who spent 12 hours a day in heels and never once took them off until she entered the bedroom for bed. Tony remembered all the band aids, blisters and blood on his mother's feet as he sat on her bed, looking in awe of her.
“Fuck!” Carol yelled as she kept giving her all to keep the ships back, trying to find where Tony was located in the cluster of ships that just kept coming, keeping her busy and hiding the omega.
“Congratulations, Janet Van Dyne. You are officially the co-captain of the new West Coast Avengers. “ Was all he said, even extending a hand out to shake. Jan smiled at him and jumped out of her seat, pulling on Fury’s extended hand and pulled him forward. She forced him into an over the desk hug. She let him go and smiled at him. Fury just swiveled his seat to sit at an angle, a hologram screen and keyboard coming alight.
Tony sat right next to Strange in the very back. And that’s how their small friendship started. Strange would insult his classmates under his breath whenever one of them asked a stupid question. And Tony would shoot him a look of amusement, trying not to get caught laughing by their professor.
“Is that why the ships came today?” Tony asked with a mouth full of dumplings. Carol’s demeanor changed from having fun to deadly serious as her eyes wandered to the omega.
is why. Jan ran into her room and dug a designer suitcase from her closet and threw it open. She packed quickly but nearly. She also packed things she would think would comfort Tony, like an MIT sweatshirt she stole from Tony and a couple bottles of wine. She zipped her suitcase up and threw on a long black peacoat jacket and some boots. As she finished gathering her keys and wallet there was a frantic knock on her door.
