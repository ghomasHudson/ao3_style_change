Her eyes went wide as she stared at Cas surrounded by Dean and Jack, and the nails protruding from Castiel’s slippers. Eileen felt no surprise at seeing Jack—they’d been introduced the weekend after Jack had been made flesh again, with Jack being dubbed a house guest and old friend of Cas’s who was staying at The Ddraig as he took a break from his college studies.
“I don’t know what happened, but I think he might have pronounced a word wrong when doing the thing with the wards?” Jack hypothesized just as they reached the ballroom.
“We’re out of Cap’n Crunch… again,” Dean lamented, eying the empty box on the kitchen counter with immense suspicion. He knew Cas thought that the cereal was like coating his tongue with noxious molecules, so Cas hadn’t eaten their last box. Staring toward Jack, who was eating a bowl of Wheaties and trying to look like he was enjoying it, Dean found that the younger man was blushing, up to the tips of his ears.
Dean found himself being chased by messages from Sam. There was no respite, even when the two of them were meant to be busy at their respective jobs. The planning session on the previous Saturday had only led to Sam running away with ideas and letting them multiply like rabbits. The only details Dean cared about was his own costume, what food he was going to prepare and getting everything together for easing the wards on the hotel—which involved him getting photos of all the guests and plus ones they expected. He was planning on printing out profile pics from Facebook, but Charlie didn’t have a Facebook and so he needed to get her to provide something for them to use.
If Dean didn’t have to handle another book after all of this, he could die happy—at least that’s how it felt after he closed up the tenth book he’d scanned that Friday evening. Dungeons and Dragons had been canceled because Dorothy had a bad cold and Charlie didn’t want anyone else catching it. Foolishly, Dean had supposed that making further headway on scanning Castiel’s library was a good idea. Further along, on a different row, Cas was helping him, scanning another section of books.
“You’re a dragon!” Dean yelled, launching himself out of his bed and hunting around for his boots. He realized, too late, he was partially undressed, his jeans from the day before gone. “You undressed me!” Dean pointed an accusing finger at Castiel, backing himself into the corner.
“I understand that you want to leave, but please understand, I didn’t know you would be able to see Jack or really sense him. Most people can’t,” Cas explained.
There was the click of more lube being pumped and then Dean felt the hot nudge of Cas’s blunt head pressing insistently at his hole. He held as still as he could and tried to relax as Cas eased himself inside of Dean, the weight of Cas’s length heavy and firm as it pressed inside deeper and deeper until Cas’s bottomed out.
“Mhmmm,” Dean nodded, during one final marking on the north wall of the room. “This here is the epicenter of the original spell that ended up trapping them both here. I got the final ingredient for what we think is a counter spell, earlier before I picked up mom and dad.”
had a piece on neurodivergent coffee professionals, which was eye opening, and was giving Dean ideas about the next time they needed to hire for The Bunker or decided to expand into a second franchise.
Eventually his feet brought him back to the sun lounge and everyone else. Dean took his spot on the couch and put his feet up, snuggling up to Cas when he and Sam finally appeared again, with drinks and snacks in tow.
“Good luck!” Charlie called after Dean as he caught sight of the first real wave of customers trooping towards The Bunker.
There, poking through what had been an okay pair of leather slippers, were a set of long curling nails.
Dean huffed out a breath and looked to the clock on the kitchen wall above the refrigerator. “Oh, would you look at the time. Some of us have to work early-”
Spinning round to look at Dean, Cas’s eyes grew wide and Dean saw how close he’d come up to Cas, but he didn’t take a step back. Cas gave Dean an awkward smile and an inquiring look.
“Guy’s got a strong grip,” Sam said in a surprised voice as they made their way over to what would be the main desk.
“Where is the damn place?” Bobby asked in an accusatory voice, as if Dean had been making up the directions from the get go.
Eventually, Ash, Charlie and Kevin went to decorate the main table in the dining room and Dean found himself working in one corner of the kitchen with just Cas.
Sam audibly gasped as they walked inside, the towering, elegant front hall and foyer, with its perfect everything clearly making Sam’s inner interior designer freak out. Dean smiled as he led Sam to the sunroom, where Dean had learned Cas liked to spend much of his time during the day. Knowing Cas was a dragon, it had finally made sense to Dean—
They chatted and moved from hot chocolate to whiskey eventually. At some point, Charlie and Jack left Dean and Cas alone in the kitchen—Charlie to go home to Dorothy, and Jack to the room they’d prepared for him, far enough away from Cas and Dean’s—and Dean decided his own whiskey wasn’t enough.
“I spoke with Jack today,” Cas said as he took a moment to stir the sauce. “He asked that we see if we can find a way to bring him back to life. Of course, I suspect the binding magic involved will also need to be undone if he was to leave the hotel as well.”
“Excellent! I’ll come round tomorrow so I can check what we need to plan for! Thanks, Cas. Look I need to go now, but tomorrow… so long as Dean meets me. Bye!” Sam hung up.
“How’s the new place?” Sam asked and took a swig from the oat milk flat white he’d ordered for himself. Garth had forced Dean to take a break, so he could go talk to his brother, which felt more like a betrayal than anything else. Like Dean wanted to be talking about his feelings and how he was doing with anyone—his therapist had been chasing him to make a new appointment as well, now that she was back from vacation.
“Right.” Intellectually, Dean knew this was the better course of action the day he’d had. But it didn’t make Castiel’s rationalizing any easier to accept.
and shook his head. “Some of us have scales and feathers. Like the dinosaurs. And human lore on dragons is, understandably, patchy at best.”
The two of them worked together to get the bath running, which was a small pool in size. It had high sides, three that weren’t against a wall and easily accessed, and the right amount of room for Cas to sit on an inbuilt seat. Finding some towels, Dean folded a blue one into a cushion for Cas to sit on, and then helped Cas to get into the bath before he started running the water. Cas had hiked up his shorts a little, to make sure the backs of them didn’t end up in water.
Cas gave Dean a sad smile. “The lady who used to do them for me, she passed away a year ago, old age. My nails aren’t normally as long or as hard as what you experienced.”
Settling against his pillows Dean looked to the time on his cell and saw it was close to nine. There was no way in hell he was going back to sleep. Pushing himself out of bed, he headed into his bathroom and took care of business before brushing his teeth and getting in the shower. As the water pummeled across his neck and shoulders, Dean relaxed into its heat and tried to figure out if Cas would be up for breakfast instead of brunch.
December meant no Dungeons and Dragons for Charlie and her players because of the increase in social obligations beyond their own little group. And so, on the second Friday of December, Charlie came to The Ddraig to help Cas and Dean bring Jack back to life. This was despite Cas issuing all sorts of warnings ahead of time that the magic could go badly wrong and that none of them were hugely experienced practitioners of magic. Charlie had promptly pointed out that Dean was at just as much risk and anyway: the spell needed three people to do the chanting.
“This is the library.” Cas walked to a bookcase in front of him, setting his beer down on a small table beside it. “I have books from all over the world here, in dozens of languages, including many ancient ones.”
But Dean was less worried about making the rent and more worried about his parents and little brother. His dad was showing no sign of wanting to slow down. Instead his dad had turned into a constant source of grief for his mother who was working extra hard to make sure John Winchester didn’t leave the house. He had lung issues thanks to his years in construction without wearing protective masks—he wasn’t 70, but emphysema was a pretty good reason to not get tangled up with COVID-19.
Dean frowned at that. “Hey, don’t you worry. Aaron and I have got this covered. You go lie down, take some aspirin or something, you hear me?”
“WHAT IS GOING ON?!” Sam screamed, on the verge of hyperventilating as he backed away to a wall, keeping everyone in view.
“Wait, what?” Sam asked as he stopped beside the breakfast bar, beer in hand. It was Thursday evening, burger night, the pans from Dean’s homemade burger and fries ensemble were waiting to be rinsed and loaded into the dishwasher.
It took a moment, but Sam’s eyes widened as realization and understanding finally came to him. “They’ll be able to leave?”
“I don’t believe it… and you just have to cut his nails? This makes like no sense in our capitalist world. None whatsoever. And his toenails make no sense in human biology at all. I hope you realize that. No human would have toenails like that.”
Dean called out an “okay” and stowed his cell away. He washed his hands and headed back out to help. Mrs Henderson was a regular customer whose autistic son Thomas would only sit quietly and calmly at The Bunker if Dean joined them. He picked up the drinks and cake that Garth had already arranged for them on a tray—an apple juice box for Thomas, large black coffee for Mrs Henderson, and a glass of water for Dean, plus chocolate brownies for Thomas and his mom—and headed on over to their usual corner spot.
Bobby frowned and then his eyes widened in surprise as if he was seeing his surroundings for the first time. “How the hell did I miss this place?”
, Dean thought as he headed on out of his rooms and went back down the hall to Castiel’s. As he walked, he went over the tips he’d picked up, including which direction to cut. He was going to get Cas to keep his feet in the bath, as it would make it easier to deal with the shrapnel of what they were about to undertake.
“Just, noting that workplace bachelor party shenanigans are not something you’re into. Need to be on top of stuff like that for when you eventually ask Eileen.”
Secondly, Dean had found ways of handling ghosts that were different to Jack. The ones who seemed like echoes of their deaths or spirits out for revenge. And he sometimes went out to exorcise them, including the presence at the apartment that had haunted him in what seemed like a different lifetime.
“Through here,” Dean said, half dragging the mattress before hefting it up again. He steered them towards what was meant to be the bedroom, which had the en-suite attached to it.
Cas was like jelly in Dean’s hands, as he spread the moisturizer and worked it into the skin of Cas’s left foot. Low little breathy moans kept coming from Cas and it made things incredibly awkward as Dean worked at Cas’s foot in his lap. But he followed through with what he promised, aching as he did, and finished by putting the new socks on Castiel’s feet—a piercing sky blue like Cas’s eyes.
Cas let out a long breath, blearily opening his eyes. “Touch my wing again,” Cas said in a husky voice dripping with want.
“You understand that until just recently I had no idea anything like you… anyone like Dean or Jack existed. Right? It’s a lot to get my head around and I want to make sure my brother is safe,” Sam replied.
The Djinn drag each hunter to another room, stringing them up in chains on their hands mechanically. Dean manages to regain a bit of consciousness and he struggles, but to no avail. The three of them swing minutely from side to side as the song fades out.
They- they kept talking about something... Winchesters. Casteel? I was kind of bleeding out on the ground at the time, can’t exactly say I was focused on it.
Some kind of long con? Become my friend, make me fall in love with you, then come out and say “haha, queer! It was all a joke”!
Glenn scurries off immediately, pausing at the door to look at Dean. Dean’s anger masks his gay panic, and he glares at Glenn.
“No!” Sam shouts, increasingly panicked. At this point, Dean resigns to being completely complacent in this ball of crazy until it dissipates. Sam closes his eyes and tilts his head up to the sky. “Dear Castiel, Dean’s being crazy, sorry this is the first time I’m talking to you after you’ve, y’know, died, but it’s important.”
“We haven’t yet had to explain to him homophobia or even love.” Cas sighs. “It’d be very difficult to-”
Dean and Glenn settle themselves on the couch, a little too close to be just bros. Dean, sleepy (or that’s his excuse), starts leaning closer to Glenn and eventually rests his head on Glenn’s shoulder.
“Well in heaven you’re also not supposed to be drinking away your problems. So spill, Winchester. What’s got you lookin’ like a pile of shit in my bar?” Ellen raises an eyebrow, and really,
at the same time. It’s hilariously slippery with how desperate they are and the tears running down their face, and it just brings a big smile to Dean’s face, making the kiss even
Velma is so smart! She solved another mystery, it turns out the whole thing was fake! It wasn’t a real ghost it was-
Look, uh, I texted Eileen. She’s back, making her way to the bunker as we speak. I’m gonna make a few more calls to Jody, the girls, probably Garth too. You, uh. You have fun playing Baby Mama on Jack.
You are three, Jack. That means you’re not going to participate in that kind of violence. Not now. Just like-
A foot jumps into frame, splashing in the pool of blood. The bottom half of this person continues to dance between the bodies.
"Stop!' Sam yelled, covering his ears. "Stop! I'm happy for you! I'm going to go bleach my brain out," he said, fleeing the kitchen. He had to tell Eileen this.
“Dean, I’m here, it’s okay.” Warm arms wrap around him, and who is he to refuse? Instinctively, he buries his nose into Cas’ neck and holds on weakly while Cas’ hands rub soothing circles on his back. When an undetermined amount of time passes, Dean sniffles, sobs tapering off.
Lucifer’s eyes and Queen Valeria’s tattoos glow. They stare into the distance smiling mischievously, then share a look with each other.
Jack nods numbly, clearly far more interested in the dog. He reaches his arms out and wiggles in Dean’s grip.
He forgot to account for the fact that Cas’ voice will make him spill secrets too. Ah, fuck. Looking back up at Cas, he sighs. “I’m nervous about tomorrow.” Cas tilts his head, waiting for Dean to elaborate. Mumbling, he says “the dinner, or whatever.” Thankfully, Cas seems to get it.
Whatever you’re here for this time, I won’t listen to another rejection. Or another fake reciprocation. I’ve said my peace to the real Dean. I won’t fall for this again.
And you didn’t think to ask him to expand on that? Or tell me, maybe research what the hell’s going on?
We were having another regular meeting when these three guys show up. They started grabbing everyone’s arms, and their faces lit up with these- these freaky blue tattoos.
Dean aggressively taps the hang up button on his phone and puts it in his pocket. He leans into the Dean Cave door frame -
Chuck’s body slowly turned into a conjoined twins amalgamation before oozing into two separate forms, Amara, and Chuck.
You can research better than dealing with emotions, which isn’t saying a lot. Go talk to him. Jack and Cas.
Well, it’s just like all the others, agents. Bloody, no clear motive other than their sick, twisted “fun,” and security footage showing their faces. We’ve identified the guy as, uh-
Several beats of silence passed, if you didn’t count Dean’s shaky breaths and hics. “He’s gone,” Dean whispered, afraid that if he said it too loud it’d be too much. But it already was, and Dean started up crying again, like a weakling.
Sam sets down a plate with eggs and bacon on the kitchen table. Jack climbs onto a chair and starts eating messily. It’s very Dean. Eileen looks at Sam questioningly, and signs (so Jack can’ hear):
Alright, fine. But be a little quieter please and thank you, the Empty shuts up anyone any louder than we are right now.
The doorbell rings. Dean’s heartbeat skyrockets, and Cas must sense it because he puts his hand directly over Dean’s heart. “You’ll be okay. You know that.” Cas reassures, and they make their way over to greet their guests.
DEAN’s still holding Jack, shushing his cries while Jack holds on to Dean’s jacket. That’s right, the bloody handprint jacket he still hasn’t taken off.
Look, whatever crap you guys got stowed, get over it, okay? Glenn, your husband’s missing. Can you tell us anything about that?
“Hey Dad!” Sam smiles, having beat Dean to the door. “Mom!” They meet each other in the middle for long, sweet hugs that they’ll probably never see again unless one of them finds another way to die in heaven.
Mary clears her throat. “So, Dean. Did you ever find yourself a lucky lady? I never heard much about your love life when I was alive,” awkward chuckle, “take two.”
“I was gonna, but I was too busy trying to convince you I wasn’t under a witch’s curse!” Dean says, defensively.
Dean shakes his head, looking down at the Map Table. He pulls the flask out of his jacket, drinks, then stalks away silently. Sam doesn’t push it, just sighs.
Everyone’s already seated in class, taking notes while the teacher - MRS HELLER - watches patiently from the front whiteboard. Then Dean enters, sauntering in unprepared, cocky, and with a give-em-hell attitude.
With Jack dead asleep, Dean sighs, looking at his sleeves. Jack’s hand is clutched onto the bloody handprint. Dean quickly looks away and tries to not think about it.
“I didn’t… try to.” Amara looked stunned. “The first time we were here, we had been separate and together at once. This is where that cage lied…”
"So what about the one night stand, Sammy?" Dean chuckled while Sam was still trying to figure out what the fuck was going on.
"I sent the Angels to Heaven and the Demons to Hell. Otherwise, we might've needed to fight them, and I don't think lover boy is up for that."
And really, who needs that last little seal of approval? Dean and Cas swoop in to each other in sync and do their best to kiss with tears of joy running down their face and quiet sobs working their way out of their throats. It’s a
I don’t get it. Three Djinn, all working together, ambushing a book club? It’s not really their style.
Slow zoom out on Young Dean’s lighter, already lit and flickering slowly. It’s almost silent in the graveyard, the only noise being the crackles of the flame.
Tell me something about... you! You guys never tell me anything about way before I was born. Tell me!
Jack doesn’t know the song, so he doesn’t notice the pronoun change. He just sits back, enjoys, and droopily closes his eyes. Dean didn’t notice either, a subconscious thing.
Sam started chanting, and oh, right. The goal was to seal away the Empty, not just get Cas back. The rift stitched itself back together, and faded away.
Jack grabs a wooden train from off the floor and swipes a blue transformer action figure, handing the train to Castiel. He smiles indulgently.
Agents Dirnt and Cool, we’re here to investigate the case of your missing daughter, Jenny. We just have a few questions for you.
Young Dean collapses to the ground and curls into a ball, hiccing and sobbing quietly. It’s silent except for the sounds of the flames and Dean’s breath hitching.
“Why didn’t you? Only on your deathbed do I get to hear- hear…” Dean trailed off, leaning into Cas’ hand, which still rested on his cheek. “We could’ve had it. The one thing you wanted.”
Castiel closes his eyes and contemplates, holding silently, lip trembling. Opening his eyes, he says -
“I- uh, Cas. Look, the one thing you want- and please tell me I’m not misinterpreting this- It’s, uh, I mean, not to be arrogant or anything. Is it- I-”
Dean shouts, shaking his head and leaning back down into the bed as more tears fall. He runs his hands over his head and through his hair.
Dean sighs. “What Cas is trying to say is that they used to be bags of dicks, lots died, the ones left are fine. Oh, and Cas was pretty much never one of the assholes,” Dean corrects.
Looking at his selection, Dean picked up a pair of bolt cutters that would need both his hands to operate but that he figured would be strong enough for the task at hand. Dean held the cutters up for Cas to see.
Dean was about to say something of it being a trick of the moonlight when a winged swooshing noise sounded and a wave of hot air brushed over Dean.
“I’m gonna try these first, okay?” Dean said louder than he would normally speak so as not to be muffled by the mask.
“Like I said on Saturday, I’ve got Bobby here with me to help move my things in. Gonna take two trips.”
“Say, I didn’t get you a moving in present. Is there anything I could get you?” Sam asked. “This is like an entire apartment, and then some, to fit out.”
“I don’t believe it,” he said after ten minutes of reading. He set the papers down and took a swig of beer. “There’s no way anyone would draw up a lease that is that good for a tenant. No way.”
Cock curving up towards his stomach and leaking, Dean wanted to come, but he wanted to do it on more than just Cas’s fingers.
“The place was haunted.” Dean gave an uneasy laugh. “Like, the place felt like it was crawling all over my skin and something horrible was going to happen, levels of haunted. There wasn’t even anyone there when I went inside.”
“Remind Aaron that Benny’s coming by with cakes not long before closing. One of you needs to make sure that the display case is ready for them. Oh! And it includes the new chocolate banana muffin recipe Benny’s trying out. Plus some more batwing cookies and spider mallow balls…” Garth took a breath. “I’m sorry Dean… I don’t know what’s gotten into me.”
“It’s Welsh, ‘ddraig’. It means dragon,” Eileen explained from just outside the doors. “For Irish Gaelic, it’s ‘dragan’, with an ‘a’ instead of an ‘o’ just before the end.”
One corner of the room, crowded behind a huge standing world globe was a rock that had a sword sticking out of it. That sword in the stone looked more out of place than the armor in the opposite corner.
“Dean! You’re finally home! Please come, it’s Cas,” Jack said, voice sounding several levels detached from the living.
As the kiss deepened, Cas’s hands became insistent in their exploration, every muscle had to be traced, every curve pursued and then as he trailed his hand down Dean’s front, Cas finally came to cup Dean’s aching length. Cas’s touch was curious as he brushed his hand down and then up Dean’s length, touch featherlight and teasing. Dean moaned into Cas’s mouth and chased the contact of Cas’s hand.
“Dean, what’s wrong?” Cas persisted. He reached out and placed a warm hand on Dean’s shoulder. Slowly the heat from Cas’s hand started to warm Dean, and he felt like he was being dragged out of an icy lake of confusion.
Setting the chai latte and banana bread aside, Dean knelt down and peered through the murky glass, past the bars that covered the inside. In what light there was filtering into the basement, he saw an outline of what looked like Garth, topless and straining against a set of thick iron manacles. Only his arms seemed thicker, and his fingers ended in wicked curling claws. Another growl and then a visible deep sniff, and whatever was in the basement turned and looked to Dean as he peered in through the window. Its pupils were pinpricks, irises a bright yellow, and its teeth looked like long sharp fingers of white enamel, ready to rip someone’s throat out.
“Okay, look, I’m just gonna move you a little so you can lean against here…” Dean gently pushed and dragged Cas so he was leaning against the cupboard doors of a nearby counter. “And I’m going to go and get my tools. I’ll be right back.”
Dean watched as if in slow motion as the cutters bit through the impossibly tough nail and sent a short rectangle of white pinging off of the side of the tub and rebounding several times before it settled somewhere in the bathroom. Looking around, Dean found the piece of nail near the tool bag and picked it up. He held it towards Cas.
, Dean thought as he watched Cas place freshly rolled pasta sheet on a lightly oiled counter top and then slice the pasta by hand, the blade of the bone handled knife snicking through the sheet with ease. Dean was in awe that Cas could cut the pasta so precisely without a mechanical noodle cutter. The lines were even and straight, leaving no pasta to waste. On the few occasions Dean had tried making his own noodles, he’d needed to use a cutter to help him cut the pasta.
“Look, could you all give Cas and me some space and leave,” Dean asked. “The sunroom is great at this time of day, even with the snow.”
Then Cas shifted them so their bodies were slotted together, Cas’s length pressed against Dean’s. He pulled Dean into his arms as Dean pulled Cas into his and they thrust and ground against each other, their dicks slipping in the water as they rutted, sliding and pressing. Breaking for air, Dean’s mouth found Cas’s shoulder and he bit down in the flesh there, sucking as he did. Cas returned the bite once Dean was done sucking, head bending over Dean’s shoulder and mouth working the skin there, making Dean tingle all over.
“He could see how much Cas cared about you,” Mary reassured. “You know that’s all we’ve ever wanted for you, right? For you to find the right someone for you. And if Cas is that someone, then he’s a very nice someone.” Smiling, Mary leaned over and kissed Dean on the cheek and stood back. “Now, how about we finish this house, hm?”
“I may be a dragon,” Cas stated, voice firm, “but I will not harm a hair on your brother’s head. How many times must I tell you this?”
Open ended, simple, perfectly innocent and as committal or non-committal as Garth wanted to make it. Dean’s eyes flicked to the broken number two pencil poking out between Garth’s fingers and Garth looked from Dean down to the dismembered pencil in his hand.
Even once Dean’s boxes of belongings were brought over to the hotel, things still looked vast and empty. Dean had driven the van that time, Bobby following in the Impala, and still almost getting lost. But they got there eventually.
“Okay, the choices are…” Sam paused for dramatic effect and then began to run down the movie night shortlist. “
Dean looked up from the floor, trying to keep his stomach under control and looked around the open plan space again. Sweat prickled on his back and he wondered just why he’d come to this place.
Approaching The Ddraig, Dean could tell the moment Cas cast the spell, because as Dean approached the street it was on, Sam gasped.
“That memory foam stuff any good?” Bobby asked casually, taking a moment to pull out a handkerchief and wipe at his forehead and the back of his neck before ramming his usual trucker cap back on his head. Bobby was going a bit gray, but his beard was still holding onto what chestnut it could. He straightened out his deep green plaid shirt over this old baseball tee and fixed Dean with a look. “Well?”
On the far side of the room was Cas on his bed, blinds closed, PC and webcam on and pointed at him. Cas was naked, tattoos nearly moving in the room’s low light, on his knees, bright red ball gag in his mouth, cock ring nestled behind his shaved balls, dick hard and veiny. His hand was pumping his dick with gusto. His face was a picture of sweet torture and Dean felt his mouth going dry as he backed out of the room.
“Yes,” Cas caught on, “we could add another ‘search query’ to the mix,” he said with air quotes and a smile. Dean looked at that smile and felt his stomach turning at the sheer beauty in front of him. It had been weeks since their kiss, and still Cas was keeping his distance. He wanted to reach out and touch Cas’s face, but he held back, because he didn’t want Cas to pull away. Even though he might not.
Shining the light around, he saw painters’ scaffolding towering up the sides of the walls, dust sheets and shuttered windows. There were no chandeliers here and the whole place looked like Cas had said: having work done on it and not up to code. Nothing weird, just cans of paint and what looked like stuff for mixing up plaster. For a moment, Dean wondered if Cas had had professionals in to deal with this, but had had them bail on him, as everything had a thin layer of dust. As he swept his light around the space, taking small steps in, he saw a trail through the dust, right down the middle of the dust sheets protecting the intricate floor beneath. He followed the trail deeper into the wing, shivering as he walked and tried to rationalize that one of the shutters might be pulled back and a window open.
By the time Dean was done for the day, leaving Aaron in charge of The Bunker (as Garth had gone off to his weekend thing), and heading back to Sam’s place, Dean was convinced that luck couldn’t deal him a haunting and an ax murderer in the same week. It just didn’t make sense for Cas to be anything but eccentric, and cute if Dean allowed himself to think about the searching blue eyes, crazy hair and strong jaw that Cas was gifted with. Cheeks warming a little, Dean got in the Impala and drove on home, refusing to think on what information may have been uncovered. Instead, he thought about whether they should order in pizza and how many beers were in the fridge—not that he could indulge too much. He would be opening up The Bunker tomorrow morning.
Eventually, some part of Dean’s actual brain kicked in and he broke eye contact with Cas, swallowing hard as he did.
The smell of crisp smoked bacon and coffee hit Dean’s nostrils as he trekked into the hotel kitchen and made for the counter where he and Cas normally ate breakfast. While Dean had been warring with himself and all that had happened, Cas had been busy cooking breakfast for both of them.
Cas, unlike their first meetings, stood from his seat and turned to greet them with a smile on his face. He’d also changed, and was now dressed more softly, in a pair of distracting washed out pale blue jeans, a baggy gray band t-shirt for The Strokes (which Dean would be having words about) and a pair of pool shoes.
“Thanks, but no thanks,” Dead said as he surveyed the dining room. Their party guests were busy getting down to the tunes being busted out by the DJ who Dean did not know, but appreciated the varied selection he was going for.
Clouds of nail dust smoked into the air, and Dean felt his biceps ache as he continued the motion, over and over. Moving slowly but surely from one nail to the next. Then, once most of the work was done, he added a buffing attachment to the end of the Dremel and smoothed away the little rough edges still there on Cas’s nails. One by one, until Cas’s nails were smooth and looked nothing like they had when Dean first met the man.
Instead of his tongue returning, Cas climbed off the bed, making Dean whine in the back of his throat. Cas shushed him as he moved around his nightstand and then returned with a bottle of lube. Pumping some of the cool, slick liquid onto his right index finger, Cas then knelt between Dean’s legs. He placed his left hand on Dean’s right hip and then started to press his lubed finger slowly inside of Dean.
“Cool. I’ll be back in a few hours then.” Dean headed out and pondered, just for a moment, what Cas had done for this insane toenails previously.
Dean couldn’t see a lie, so he just remained where he was, because he wanted to be that close to Castiel. “Cas…”
they needed to take. He drove the van down a familiar side street and pulled up at the gates he remembered stopping at during his initial visit to the hotel and to drop off the lease. The driveway beyond the gates was clear, the gates just needed unlocking.
Sam gave Dean a skeptical look, but didn’t push the line of questioning any further. Spending a moment staring into their respective drinks, Dean was slightly touched that Sam had found time in his busy schedule to come in and see Dean. He knew Sam cared about him, but Dean had spent enough of his life wondering if maybe he was getting in the way of everyone else’s—something he’d been working on with his therapist since Sam had persuaded him to see one.
“When I have some more furniture. Case in point.” Dean waved his hand over the now not so orange sideboard.
Dean and the creature built up height and then took a huge dive down towards the park near The Ddraig. Suddenly, Dean remembered why he hated flying as he screamed, the ground rushing up to meet them.
“Yes, every single one. But I still haven’t found anything that can help Jack and myself.” Cas sighed.
Dean frowned and cut off the hot water as he allowed cold to continue to fill the tub. Once the water was well over the curves of Cas’s nails, Dean stopped the flow and stood. Even with the addition of cold for those last few moments, the water was still far warmer than what Dean would personally enjoy if he were to have a bath.
“I am a dragon,” Cas announced like he was stating that the weather outside was cool and breezy today.
Sighing to himself, Dean went and found the open bread and put some toast on before fixing himself a cup of coffee. The domesticity of the whole situation was almost making him feel sick, but it was countered with how much he was enjoying being around Cas like this. Like they were two people who organized groceries and shopping together like a couple. That Jack was there to witness all of this almost embarrassed Dean, but he tried not to think about that too much.
“I’m not so sure about this,” Jack said as Dean, Cas and Charlie worked to set up a bathroom in one of the empty hotel rooms that was just within the boundaries of the east wing. The bath was where the real ritual would take place.
He kept chanting the memorized lines and then the lantern behind them went out. A wave of eerie blue light pulsed out from the center of the room, flying through the air and through Dean and Sam and outwards through the rest of the hotel and its grounds. And as quickly as it had started it was over and the lantern flickered back to life.
There were many things Cas loved about Dean: the summer green of his eyes framed by a heavy fan of lashes as Dean blinked sleepily into wakefulness every morning, the plush pair of lips –a perpetual invitation to sin especially alluring whenever Dean pouted, which was a pretty common occurrence since the young man seemed highly-attached to his childish mannerisms– always so soft as Cas bit into the flesh, coaxing needy moans from Dean’s throat, and his freckles, that map of constellations stretching all over Dean’s tanned supple skin.
He knew Dean needed his rest, but Castiel was only a man, and one who was in love at that. The stark-naked body of his lover was bound to have an effect on him. His cock, a mile ahead, was hard and weeping at the head. This was not about him though; it was about Dean’s ass. For Castiel, it always was.
Castiel was dazed, Dean’s scent filling his lungs and clogging his mind. He could feel himself harden under the desk, and never was he so grateful for the lower-body privacy teachers’ desks provided.
Dean shook his head and kissed Castiel on the lips. Despite being impaled in Dean, feeling his hole squeezing and relaxing, struggling to adjust, their light kiss felt significantly more intimate, tender and real. He wanted to believe it meant more, but it was better not to expect anything more than what he was given.
“Dean, baby. You cannot possibly be serious about going out like that” the conversation had taken place three weeks ago, before one of their Thursday night dates.
Dean was a sobbing mess, powerless under Castiel’s harsh pounding, pinned face-down and letting the Alpha ravish him. How many had seen him just like this, taken him like this?
That seemed to be enough encouragement for the moment, and soon Dean’s ass shadowed his face, coquettish pucker winking down at him and the boy’s knees planted on the mattress while he held on to the wooden headboard for support.
“I couldn’t stop myself, Cas. I feel so empty all the time, so I let those Alphas fuck me. Feels good for a little while, real good, but then I can’t go on. I can’t take their knots because -because they’re not you!”
“What about that little rumor of me fucking five alphas after the match we lost last week, hmm? Was my consolation gift. The perfect Omega cheerleader, they said.”
Castiel’s head, fifty feet underwater, was having trouble keeping up with Dean’s unexpected confession. All he knew was that Dean was upset and it was his fault, so he needed to fix it. He needed to make his Omega happy again. Needed to see that cocky smile curving up his lips, to hear contented sighs as he aided in creating those dirty sounds that drove Dean’s Omega feral.
Cranky, he’d almost skipped the start of his daily routine, but being a creature of habits, he reasoned it couldn’t do him any harm to pump some endorphins into his bloodstream.
They got inside the shower together, warm water splashing against the glass doors and washing away sweat, cum and the reek of sex that seemed to emanate from their pores. Cas motioned for Dean to turn around, and Dean twirled obediently, standing still –for the most part. He seemed all too eager to rub (accidentally) his soapy-wet ass against Castiel’s front– as Cas lathered him with a sugary-scented shower gel, all the way down his neck and back, over his chest, teasing pebbled nipples, below his arms, then his belly, his bloated little cock, the crevice of his ass.
Cas grinned. That gorgeous plump ass and tight little pucker had quite a day ahead of them, and Castiel would be having one hell of a night. He’d keep Dean aroused for oh so many hours before he granted the boy his release.
The Omega looked at him puzzled, and broke down with renewed tears running down his face and little hiccups that made his whole body tremble.
Pulling himself back from the memory, Cas recalled it was Saturday, which meant Dean didn’t have to get ready to go to the college campus. Instead he’d be sleeping in, exhausted after a busy week, but even more exhausted and fucked-out after last night's activities. Cas had fucked him long and hard, pistoning roughly into Dean's tight channel while he was practically bent in half, thighs shaking from a youthful flexibility put to the test.
Castiel fumed, and still he was entranced by the way his erection disappeared inside Dean, how easily he could dive right in, how well they fitted together.
That was such a nice dream, and Dean had done so well describing it while he was being rimmed within an inch of his life. Cas was so proud of his boy. He dug deeper into Dean’s hole with his digit, until he scarcely grazed it, that sweet spot that would have Dean seeing stars and emptying the heavy load trapped in his balls.
Castiel moaned and driven by some primal instinct, he made quick work of Dean’s belt and pants, until the boy had nothing but a pair of lacy panties to protect him from Castiel’s delirious Alpha. Next went Castiel’s own pants and boxers, till they were shoved past his knees.
The grip of Dean’s hole, locking them together, the soft tug lighting the erogenous zone that was their searing point of contact, it was maddening. Castiel did it again, more forcefully this time, and the tugging sensation was too much, the pull too intense for Dean, who, in no time, was painting the dark fabric of his t-shirt in white, and hugging Castiel tightly in his arms as he moaned out what sounded like a yes, his bow legs wrapped around the Alpha’s middle while his worn out hole spasmed, eager to be fed Alpha seed.
“Uh yeah. Magic’s not, like, a precise science or whatever.” Dean strolled over to the crystal he was meant to hold while burning the powdered cockatrice beak and a bunch of other ingredients in a bronze bowl.
Back in the kitchen Dean gave Sam a concerned smile. “Okay, so we’ll act mostly normal,” Dean’s eyes flicked towards the auction and he let go of the rolling pin to fist pump the air as he saw the message saying he’d successfully bid for the feathers. “Yes, normal.” Dean schooled his expression. “Would you close that for me?” He asked, pointing at the laptop.
Cas pulled back for a second, warm breath ghosting over the moistness of Dean’s pucker and it felt agonizing to be bereft of the insistent pressure of Cas’s tongue. “You like this, don’t you?”
“It’s near Fawick Park, like I told you.” Dean held up his hands. “If you can’t find it, it’s not my fault.”
Here, the rooms were even bigger and even more elegantly fitted, if that was at all possible. Then he found one room that was completely empty and Dean found himself walking inside. The bathroom was ensuite, the ceilings high and no chandelier dominated the space. He went to the room’s windows and looked out. The room was on the same side of the hotel as the old fountain and the pathway he’d walked along. A feeling told Dean that this would probably be his room, if he came to live at Castiel’s stunning hotel and took over care of the man’s feet. The space was bigger than most apartments, with several connected rooms together to form an entire suite. Dean had never had so much space to himself before. Reassuringly, there was a fire suppression system present, which made the former firefighter in Dean glad.
“Remind me to make your brother take a personal day the next time you move,” Bobby cursed as they finally reached the third floor. Taking a moment to catch their breath, Dean led them across the landing and down the hallway to his room. He was room 3-6 and had to wrestle the mattress as he unlocked the door. It was still taller than most doors in regular houses, but still nowhere near as tall as the doors on the first floor, so Dean and Bobby tilted the mattress to an angle to push it across the threshold.
Dean had streaming on Sam’s TV switched scenes and they were back with the crew that had stayed behind on the show’s pivotal space station. Sam’s typing paused for a moment and he swore gently under his breath before clicking somewhere else on the screen and starting to type some more. Dean had no idea what Sam’s latest email was about, but they were meant to be hanging out that Monday evening and instead Sam’s bottle of beer sat abandoned on the coffee table, droplets of condensation slowly running off as the bottle warmed. Sam had agreed to watching a few episodes of “DS9” and take part in their ritualistic picking apart of Star Trek episodes, but they were now two episodes in and Dean was wishing he’d banned Sam’s cell phone from hanging out with them so they could have watched in peace. It was the cell that had alerted him to the email and led to the laptop being brought in from Sam’s small home office.
Dean jumped as Cas knocked on his car window. It was dark now and Cas was wrapped up in a blue knitted sweater, something even in the light spilling from the hotel entrance, he was sure went well with Cas’s eyes.
They turned off the lights and were left with the flickering candles around the bathtub. Taking their positions, Jack ghosting his way into the water filled tub, Cas, Dean and Charlie started to chant in a language that Dean did not know. As the unusually shaped words flew over his tongue, Dean felt the temperature in the bathroom drop and then tried not to lose his cool as Jack was pulled under the water as if by an invisible force.
Dean didn’t feel that much like resting, so he picked up his cell and started looking for rental listings that were less likely to be haunted. But ten minutes in, his head started to hurt and he put his cell back down on the bedside table and picked up his tea instead.
“That too.” Dean stopped by the swing doors. “Hey, um… my brother, Sam, asked if he could come by and check out the place this weekend. Is that okay? Clearly not going to invite him over to talk with our resident ghost, but uh-”
“Right, yeah,” Dean said, motioning to Sam to follow him. They headed out of the sun lounge, Sam shaking his right hand out as they did.
“Dude,” Sam started and then Dean picked up on the lilt of Eileen’s voice as she talked with Cas near the doorway to the kitchen.
The sound of typing filled the workshop and Dean turned back to his sideboard project. Contemplating what grit level of sandpaper he was going to need for the wood once it was dry, Dean wanted to make sure everything was smooth and ready for staining. Just as he started looking at the selection Bobby had stashed in a drawer, Dean’s thoughts stopped as he looked back to Charlie. He stared at her until she stopped typing.
“But I couldn’t even warn you or anything. I couldn’t even get myself out of there!” Cas whined. “Now Eileen knows something is up.”
Sam swallowed, wild eyes not daring to look away, lest he become some kind of monster chow. Dean sighed and dragged a hand over his face, trying to figure out what the game plan was for this. Or if there even was a game plan.
And while there were several supernatural creatures in his life, Dean didn’t dive head on into it. Instead, he helped where he knew he could, and spent most of his days making Cas happy and helping him to discover parts of the world that he had never met before or had forgotten.
, which would also be awesome for Moodoor, but a place like that with huge grounds? And art deco decor? Maybe we could run like
Setting down his knife and fork, Cas pushed his now empty plate away and picked up his cup coffee between his hands. “So.”
Dean liked Thomas and Mrs Henderson—he’d only met Thomas’s father once—but their brief time together always stirred a little something inside Dean. Regret and sadness mostly—regret that his ex, Lisa, had not only pushed Dean away from her, but also away from her son Ben, who Dean had gotten along with well. Over the past year, Dean had wasted a lot of time trying to figure out what had gone wrong. While he still wasn’t sure, Dean had a feeling. His instinct told him it was to do with how he had never been able to live up to Lisa’s needs—someone who could be there, mind, body and soul, twenty-four-seven. But Dean couldn’t do that, not in his old job when one callout had gone terribly wrong.
“Because you asked so nicely,” Cas chuckled, “I’ll let you have your Christmas present.” He pulled his fingers out, leaving Dean achingly empty and then manhandled him onto his front and all fours.
They were a writhing mass of pleasure as Cas fucked into Dean, his thrusts timed and angled just right, hitting Dean’s sweet spot deep inside on most thrusts. The fullness he felt was perfect as his nerves lit up with Cas’s ministrations. Desperate to come, Dean pushed back until he leaned into Cas, coming to rest against Cas’s knees, forcing Cas to hold onto him as he thrust into Dean.
“Sure,” Dean said exasperated and sat down at the counter they had set up as a breakfast bar. Perched on a stool, Dean tried to figure out how he was meant to handle knowing that not only ghosts were real, but dragons too.
“The episodes where they go down to a planet when they didn’t intend to, and end up stuck on it and unable to really leave? Those are like the DS9 equivalents of the holodeck gone wild episodes from Next Gen.” Dean took a sip of beer. “It’s hilarious. If the characters knew anything, they’d ban holodecks and random planet side trips.” Scratching his left hand through his dark blond hair, Dean looked over at Sam who was glued to his laptop screen, busily typing away at an email—it was always emails. Dean had never known one person could get so many emails, but he swore that what Sam spent 90% of his waking hours doing was responding to them. How his brother also managed to have a steady girlfriend or shop for anything, including groceries (and mysteriously found time to look at Ikea furniture), Dean had yet to figure out. He’d certainly failed to make much of the summer which was now slipping away as September got up to speed.
Dean, still with his battery powered lantern, led the way through the hotel and out through the front main doors. Snow was drifting down lazily from the night sky, the moon a thin sliver above them. They walked down the main driveway and past the now snow filled fountain. Their breath misted in front of them, steaming up into the frigid night air.
The hairs on the back of his neck stood up and Dean watched in trepidation as the doors opened inwards. Through them, he could see a grand front foyer with pristine white tiles intersected by small black tiles turned to look like diamonds. High backed swooping cream lounge chairs were arranged in discrete groupings and a long chandelier hung from an elaborate ceiling fixture done in plaster, painted in black and with a series of diamond outlines, all just visible in the vastness of air above him. The walls were stylishly off-white, broken up by faux cuboid pillars with black detail. Dean wondered if he’d just walked into a shoot of an adaptation of
“I’m sure I can ice the house myself, why don’t you get started on the eggnog?” Dean said as he got the icing bag ready.
“Then you finally get to grow old and live your best life while doing it.” Dean smiled and wished he could pat Jack on the back.
“I’m sure you’ll find someone,” Sam said. “Speaking of,” he looked back to Dean, “how are things in-”
Dean stroked his fingers through Cas’s feathers, the cool silkiness soft on his skin and Cas rocked towards him, eyes blown and mouth open in a breathy gasp.
Pulling out his cell, Dean set up a timer and started it. “I’m going to unpack some of my things. You, just sit here and relax, okay, Cas, and I’ll be back before you know it.”
Cas looked away, lost in thought for a moment. “I believe they thought they could trap me and make off with my hoard. That is a guess. I didn’t really have much to go on when the spell rebounded on them and threw them from my home.”
Dean didn’t need to get anything for his costume, he’d finished working on that the weekend before, but the store was doing good business as last minute Halloween purchases were rung through the checkouts at alarming speed. Tailing behind Sam, Dean sent an email from his cell to Cas, with details of who the remaining guests were and links to their Facebook profiles. Cas was in charge of finishing the spell, Dean was in charge of making sure Sam didn’t kill his bank balance.
Dean found a staff staircase and headed on upstairs. Making his way onto the second floor, he came out on a hallway that had lower ceilings than the first floor, but were still quite high. Small chandeliers hung from the ceiling at regular intervals, brightening the off white walls and the black detailing. Doors lined the corridor, with large spaces between them, indicating large, spacious rooms. Dean wondered why so much of the building was kept like a hotel if it wasn’t really being used as a hotel anymore.
The wing slowly ended on what looked like a ballroom through a set of glass doors, a bar running down the right hand side of the room. Dean was reminded of
The break up with Lisa had been painful, but it was the work incident before that had left him raw and nearly broken. A call gone wrong every which way it could, during a night shift. Big family home. Arson. The family trapped inside. Two colleagues lost. Dean didn’t come back from that call. He’d be reliving it in his nightmares and waking hours for as long as he still drew breath—but Sam, therapy and the friends he’d made while working at The Bunker? They all helped to keep things under control. He’d found some balance, a center around which he could live and heal.
Cas carried Dean into the bedroom, mouth insistent as it kissed up and down Dean’s neck, sucking hungrily at the tender skin there. Dean was going to have hickeys after all this, but he couldn’t bring himself to care as he moaned and ground up against Cas’s torso. Between Dean’s cheeks, Cas’s cock slid, slicked by his pre-come, as Dean’s length rubbed against Cas’s stomach. They were a tangle of limbs and need as Cas landed them on the bed, pushing Dean up into the middle.
The sky was a calming azure, streaks of clouds dotted along it like the beep and pause of Morse code. What surprised Dean was that he didn’t feel scared, like he would if he was going to take a flight across the country. Instead he felt safe and protected by the creature between his legs, and when he leaned down during particular steep dives, lining up with the creature’s neck, he felt a comforting warmth that bled through him and made him think of long nights curled up on the couch, a thick blanket draped over himself and a lover—with a roaring fire in the fireplace and hot coco.
“So, last session, you managed to get past the prison guards, after spending an age getting ready. And you were trying to figure out if Ger the Wizard was worth breaking out after all, having overheard a conversation between the local justice and Sir Oddnuns, the knight who had captured Ger in the first place.” Charlie took a sip of soda. “You have until just before the cock crows to decide your final actions.”
When Fake Dean’s body falls to the ground, Castiel’s strings are cut loose. The Angel Blade drops limp from his hand and he kneels down next to the body.
Jack gets up and starts walking purposefully through the library. Sam follows, hesitant and concerned.
Now, a NEWS ANCHOR with a crooked shot of a TV, looking horrified, barely hidden by professionality.
“I’m… not?” Jack asked, tilting their head, and Dean smirked for a brief moment before remembering why that brought a smile to his face. He didn’t dare to think the name. Dean didn’t let those thoughts rise farther than the depths hidden and dimmed by the alcohol.
I don’t know. It’s frustrating. Ever since I came back, I just keep feeling this thing. But I don’t know what.
not engaged. Are you two in on some kind of joke I’m not?” Sam points hesitantly at Cas and Dean, squinting suspiciously. Then he looks at Cas. At Cas’ hand. At his ring finger.
Meg nods toward the handprint. Dean gives her a brief look, then stares resolutely at the darkness in front of them.
Well, I’m biased. But it is true that if any Angel were to hear out the speech he gave me, what ultimately pushed me to rebel... I think they’d share my opinion of him.
Castiel locks eyes helplessly for Dean, asking for any kind of way out of this. There isn’t one. Dean shakes his head, asking silently for Cas not to go along with her.
Sam arrives in heaven an undetermined amount of time later. Dean tried asking Cas about it but all he got was a sigh and “wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey.” Sure, Dean has never been more proud in his life for that Doctor Who reference, but he still has no fucking clue what the deal is. But it doesn’t really matter, because there’s no
Castiel jolts violently and tries to spring up into a full sitting position, but is held back. He snarls, then shakes his head and looks over to Dean.
Cas grunts a little at the impact, and slowly brings his arms up to hug back, softly. “Hello, Dean.”
Hey, the dude can sense longing as a prayer. I woke him up with a prayer. Maybe if I panic hard enough he’ll jump up into action again!
“Things are kinda making sense now,” Jo says contemplatively. She props up her elbow on the bar and rests her chin on her hand. “Yeah, I remember, Cas was so obsessed with you back then-”
Jack pulls out of the hug to wipe his nose on his sleeve. “I-I’m sorry. I just- you’ve never said that to me before.”
She snaps, and Castiel is freed from the bounds. He stands up to walk over to Dean (and Sam, still passed out). Tears stream down Dean’s face, where the duct tape is still worked over his mouth.
Dean tries to send a consoling look at Cas (aka heart eyes). It’s, well, “working” would be an overstatement and “failing miserably” would be a bit more accurate.
Dean looks back at Amara and nods. Then, with a camera angle shift, she’s gone. Dean breathes, readying for whatever’s next. He whistles to catch Sam’s attention and tosses him the keys.
Castiel disappears again in the same moment that Dean’s left there alone, while the scene around them morphs, changing to-
Sam’s waiting in the passenger’s seat when Dean gets in silently and makes a move to turn the ignition one and get driving. Sam puts a hand up, and Dean pauses, sighing and looking down. He knew this chick-flick moment was inevitable.
Where is it going? Do you know? Can you feel the thing I can? Wait, why can I feel it? That’s weird. Do you know why it’s back? I don’t think-
But Dean’s at peace, right? I mean, who dies and goes to heaven only to fall into a depressive episode? Not Dean, that’s for sure! No, no, Dean’s
If you finish that sentence with “it’s no big deal,” I’m going to kick your ass. I’m serious, Dean. That shit doesn’t fly now or then. I- I had no idea.
What Dean and Cas find out, though, is that there is way more to planning weddings than they thought. They forget that every detail is up to them, and it’s kind of weird hiring a caterer in heaven when no one needs money there, anyway. But they do, and do all the classic wedding stuff too. Other than dress shopping.
Eileen’s car drives (at a reasonable speed) down the highway, MIRACLES OUT OF NOWHERE - KANSAS playing softly in the background. Cause, Kansas. We watch as the car speeds by, following it’s tires with the camera.
Look Feebs, I already told the police my story and they told me I was crazy. Unless you’re gonna actually listen, I’d rather you get your asses off my property.
Miracle barks in response, and Dean grins at them and pats them some more before turning his attention to the TV. A beat passes when Jack looks at Dean, concerned. He opens his mouth, decides against it, then decides in favor of it.
Bad idea, Robert. He keeps running there, frantically looking behind him to check if anyone’s there.
At this point, Eileen starts to wake up, jolting and struggling in her cuffs before realizing it’s useless. She looks at Sam and Dean, checking to see if they’re okay, then decides to taunt the Djinn.
As they’re almost there, the goo stretches to try and reach them. It’s close, and it touches Castiel's shoulder, rips the trenchcoat, but Dean shoves Cas through the portal. He’s gone. Dean follows after him.
Sam looks up from his phone, and puts it in his pocket. He can hear crying noises from Castiel’s room, Dean’s shushing muffled as well.
Sam grins, then speed-walks (Sammy has a crush, that must be so embarrassing for you) through the library to-
A beat of silence. Eileen puts a hand on Sam’s shoulder to comfort him. Jack looks at Dean, bittersweet. He cares.
Sam’s face went briefly pale and then he recovered himself. Clearing his throat he said, “Right,” and ducked his face back into whatever photocopies he was busy highlighting the heck out of. Dean chuckled and headed into the kitchen, pronouncements on Castiel’s suitability paused for the time being.
“She better do, after giving us both a heart attack, because there’s no way I’m learning ancient Greek or Latin to help with this mess.” Dean hefted Charlie into his arms in a bridal carry and shifted her out of the library and in the direction of a small lounge close by.
brother got so bossy, and estimated it was somewhere between the first time Sam kissed a girl and making captain of his high school soccer team. Thinking more on it while Sam continued to panic on Dean’s behalf, Dean couldn’t decide if in fact there was a degree of causality there and that, in fact, Sam became bossy, which helped him become soccer team captain, which then helped him to kiss his girl, because “popularity” of some kind had happened.
“And I am thankful for Dean,” Cas said before closing the distance and pressing a light kiss to his lips.
Cas stood up and held up a wine glass filled with a crisp Sauvignon blanc. “Welcome everyone. Thank you for coming here today.”
Dazzled a little by the warmth in the look Cas gave him, Dean awkwardly returned the sentiment and then headed off back to his own rooms, still amazed by the sheer wealth of belongings he passed in Cas’s rooms. In contrast, Dean’s pale white walls and black lacquered floor boards had hardly anything to occupy them. It wasn’t that Dean was a minimalist by choice, it was just that over the years, aside from his record collection, he’d never had either time, money or (really) inclination at the same time to buy lots of things for himself. Even with clothes, he had limited items and a habit of only buying new jeans when they clearly had started to wear out beyond the needs of a quick patching job. And even his coffee journal came every quarter, so it wasn’t like he was swimming in issues of even that.
“Right? It’s bigger than any apartment I’ve ever seen.” Dean walked over to the windows and looked down at the fountain outside.
Garth nodded eagerly and hung his apron up on the peg it usually stayed on. “I’ll let you know if… if I can’t make it on Friday.”
Finishing up his own food, and now a little concerned, Dean headed back over to Cas’s door and knocked again. There was still no answer.
Dean stowed his cell and took a deep breath as he started the Impala and put it in drive. Pulling out, Dean declared to himself, “Ghosts, they’re not real. Hell, nothing like that is real. Nope. No Casper. Nope. Nope.”
“Seems so.” Dean sighed and looked towards the door as more customers approached. “Listen, I better get back to work. I’ll text you later.”
Dean’s brow creased in thought. The number of books sounded far more than what Dean had seen in Cas’s rooms earlier in the week. “There’s over a thousand books in your rooms?”
The gingerbread house was a foot high and the most ambitious creation Dean had ever made from baked goods. It had a chimney, windows, a door, even its own little footpath. He was in the process of adding the finishing touches and his mother kept hovering around him like he was about to make a fatal error any moment. It was frustrating, but he allowed it, because he hadn’t seen her in so long.
“Do you think we’ve got enough banana bread?” Garth asked, voice normal, no inflection like he was insinuating anything that said he knew Dean had been to his house on Wednesday.
, Dean thought as he headed back to the sunroom. Cas was still there. He had a list in his hand that Cas had slipped him earlier. It had a list of items that Cas had recommended and they lined up with that Dean had read.
Sun getting low, Dean drove over to Garth’s place after his shift ended. He had a skinny chai latte and slice of banana bread—Garth’s favorite menu items—in hand and he walked up the yard to Garth’s house, hoping that he wasn’t about to wake Garth from a nap. He resisted the urge to jump into a pile of raked leaves that Garth had left and got to the front door. Knocking with the hand holding the brown paper bag of banana bread, Dean listened for any reaction from indoors.
Dean didn’t realize he was doing it, but he placed himself between Charlie and the door out of the library, in case she decided to run like he had.
The four of them agreed it was fine and then slowly filtered out of Charlie’s place, heading out into the cool night air. Dean shivered a little and pulled his green jacket tighter around himself as he made his way to the Impala.
And still, squirreled away in one corner near a window was a little reading nook, with a high backed green leather chair, matching footstool and floor lamp that was definitely vintage.
Dean picked up the remote and paused the episode. “Hey, maybe we should start back at the start of the episode. I think you missed most of it.”
After some unknown amount of time that likely would have covered the length of an actual viewing of the apartment, Dean turned on his cell’s screen. He went looking for the ad he thought he’d been responding to. Dean tried several rental sites, but nothing came up. No worry—he had screen shots of the listing. Bringing that up from his gallery app, he looked at the pictures, saw that the price had been incredibly low for the kind of place it was. But then he looked closer at the outside shots and something stirred in his memory.
A traitorous voice in the back of his mind supplied as they went and fetched the rest of his furniture.
Dean looked around the shop, making sure no one remained who might overhear them. “Garth, I went by your place on Tuesday, after my shift.”
Dean turned to face Garth, empty tray in hand. “Well, there was no way anyone was getting up them in one piece after a good night out.” Dean waggled his eyebrows.
“And if you were to be the one to organize it, I don’t see why we can’t have a… shindig with yours and Dean’s closest friends.” Cas mouthed to Dean “it sounds fun”.
But if they were working so hard to bring Jack back and unbind both him and Cas from the hotel, Dean decided that it would be right if he were to at least get to know the ghost—the young man—before they tried to bring him back from the dead. All Jack had done to Dean, after all, was just say “hello”.
“It wouldn’t be as big as Dean’s trying to make out. Not like we need catering big. But what about if we have a potluck and people bring their own drinks? We could hire a DJ. Have like a prize for best costume. Just good friends. Set up in the dining room… what do you think?” Sam asked breathlessly.
He thought about the sharp strong lines that Cas had. The way his jaw would feel great rubbing against Dean’s neck or the soft skin of his chest and thighs. What those long fingers of Castiel’s would feel like on him and inside him. Dean moaned at such thoughts, though still quietly enough that someone walking in the hallway outside wouldn’t hear him. He thought of those fingers teasing him open as he tried not to lose himself too soon, being good for Cas and waiting, because Dean had an idea of what was between Cas’s legs, and being impaled on Cas? The idea of it was enough to send Dean over the edge as he shook and came all over himself, spurting and stroking until he was too sensitive to touch himself anymore.
Driving back to the hotel without having to help Bobby get there was easy as pie for Dean. He thought it strange as he pulled up at the parking space set aside for him within the hotel’s grounds. Still, it wasn’t the strangest thing that had happened to Dean recently and the streets around The Ddraig were all very similar and maybe the street signs weren’t as clear as they could be. Dean didn’t think for a moment about the fact that Bobby had a decent sense of direction and was the one who kept everyone on the right forest paths when they used to go out camping in the summer.
Sam was about to say something and then stopped, eyes focused on the bottom right of his laptop screen.
Dean thought as they started gearing up for the mid-morning wave of customers. Usually stay at home parents with little ones needing to get out of the house.
They shook hands and Dean felt a weight lifting from his shoulders. And in that second he realized that at some point, Sam would probably want to meet the guy, and Sam was far fussier than Bobby. Dean stood by while Cas and Bobby chatted a moment about the hotel and the superb condition it was in and then Bobby was all business again and determined to help Dean finish moving his stuff some time that century.
Cas muttered under his breath and leaned across the counter, holding his right hand out over the stack, palm down. Dean watched as Cas closed his eyes in concentration and then opened them again, pulling his hand away as he did. The pancakes were nice and warm again.
Asking if a place was ghost free was not exactly something Dean could just go out and do. Charlie just about believed him that he could see them and that they were real, but hardly anyone else in his life had ever shown such openness to the whole afterlife being kind of real and often full of ghosts. But as Dean tried to find some semblance of calm and the nerve to say that he was moving out and thanks and all to Cas, he wondered if maybe, the guy with impossible nails might be open to the idea of what he’d seen.
And then it punched Dean in the gut, as he tipped over and made a mess over his stomach and Cas’s hand and sheets. Behind him, Cas stuttered to a halt, hips shaking as he spilled into Dean. They cried each other’s names and eventually fell into a messy heap on Cas’s bed.
“Can you get some shoes and a jacket, I need to show you something,” Dean said, pulling his own down-filled jacket on.
“Great. Garth said Benny’s swinging by before closing.” Dean finished making up the latte he’d been making before Aaron’s arrival.
Cas grunted and nodded. Pulling up a face mack, Dean settled Cas’s left foot on his lap and looked across to him.
The kettle started to whistle and Dean took it off the stove top. He poured the water into a mug, peppermint teabag waiting and set Cas’s mug down. Dean went over to the coffee pot and poured himself a fresh cup and left it black. Taking the drinks over to the couch, Dean looked over to his desk again and shook his head at himself. He set the drinks down on the coffee table and settled against the couch cushions. Sons of Anarchy was still playing on the screen, but he didn’t recognize where the characters were.
The high ceiling of the dining room was here as well. The room was packed with bookshelves on the floor and along the walls, all the same dark lacquered wood of much of the hotel.
Dean had counted: three mummies (of varying accuracy), six werewolves (including Garth choosing to have a joke at himself and dressing up as one—no accuracy there), three fairies (Dean had no idea what fairies might look like), one Banshee (Eileen, who was bopping along to the bass she could feel thrumming through the room), five witches (which included Charlie), Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz (as portrayed by a cold-free Dorothy), two pumpkins (including Kevin), three ghosts (including Jo), one old school devil (that was Ash), two Frankenstein’s monsters, and finally Cas as an angel and Dean as a demon. Bobby had declined the invitation for the party and was, as far as Dean could tell from Jo, off having a scary movie marathon with Jo’s Mom, Ellen.
Searching the sunroom, kitchen, basement, library and Cas’s room, Dean couldn’t find Cas. Running out of places to look as he stood in the middle of the foyer by the front desk, he turned to the doors for the east wing. They were open by several fingers and Dean could already feel a sense of foreboding steal over him as he approached.
“I suppose when they suddenly get this long, you can’t exactly drive yourself anywhere,” Dean offered.
Dean turned to the source of the voice and faced a pair of open black lacquered, glass fronted doors, and headed in what appeared to be a sunroom of sorts. There was a cacophony of plants in the room, making the sunroom seem part jungle in some corners, all planted in varying types of ceramic and terracotta pots. He couldn’t see who had spoken to him and then looked towards a pair of open French doors and a man sat in a tall backed rattan chair, the dried strands again stained black. His back was to Dean, but Dean could see a tuft of messy black hair, and a vibrant crocheted blanket trailing from the man’s lap for over five foot from the chair.
It took some more calming words and a strong cup of sweetened tea to eventually persuade Charlie to believe that Cas was very much what he claimed to be and that he wouldn’t eat her. Then the questions about other supernatural beings came and Dean gave her the same talk that Cas had given him the other week. After the talk, she seemed calmer and more accepting of the impossibility of everything.
Aaron gave Dean a wink as he pulled on his apron, making Dean blush. The two of them didn’t work together often, and it was usually Aaron that worked the late afternoon to closing shift.
Sam closed his laptop lid and nodded in agreement. “You’re right. So, are you going to take the place?”
Dean had been a little surprised to see Sam come into The Bunker that Friday morning. But not entirely, he was three and a bit days deep into the weirdest living arrangement he’d ever been in and had so far glossed over his new living situation with Sam when he was inevitably called each night. How else was Sam meant to find out what was going on in Dean’s life, bar showing up at the hotel itself once Dean was done with work for the day?
“Don’t worry about heading off as normal,” Aaron said as he finished tying his apron. “Ron has said he’ll come in to work with me. He doesn’t have any classes this afternoon.”
That was the most Cas had said all day. Dean rolled his eyes and pushed back from his desk, locking his computer as he stood. He stretched, the loose jeans he was wearing threatening to slip from his hips, and walked over to the kitchen in their mainly open plan, loft apartment.
“Yes, though now that I look more closely, I see that your energies suggest an inclination for such things.” Cas straightened up. “I apologize for the fear that you must have experienced this night. It was not my intention for you to ever be placed in such a position. I understand if you wish to move out.”
Garth inhaled deeply through his nose and then rolled his eyes. “Fine, fine.” He changed the topic of conversation. “You okay running things over the weekend with Aaron?”
Evening was upon them and all Dean could do was think of each and every weird little thing he’d encountered over the years. Books moving around shelves at Cassie’s old place was one. His book collection on the shelf below Cassie’s had not been her sort of thing, but the books would somehow, when Dean wasn’t looking, manage to move themselves around. Falling off the shelves or being stacked up in weird ways on the shelves rather than having their spines facing out—and Cassie and Dean had been the only ones living in that house. They hadn’t tended to have friends over, preferring to go out.
“Mmm, good,” Dean murmured and sipped it slowly, blowing on it between sips. He decided that thinking was just a poor use of his time and decided to stop doing it and just try to relax.
Garth nodded sagely and then hurried over to the till as a horde of hungry looking Lamaze attendees descended on The Bunker from the yoga and pilates studio that was based across the road. And quickly, Dean was being swarmed with orders for caffeine-free hot beverages and slices of cake.
Dean set to work, turning on the faucet and setting the plug. He found the lavender bubble bath and poured a long dollop into the flowing water—it was a large bath, after all. He then kept his hand in the water, swirling the suds as they formed, and kept an eye on the water’s temperature as the bathtub slowly filled. The water got to a near scorchingly high temperature before Dean started to wonder if Cas could sense the temperature was so hot.
On the floor in his living room, not that it looked much like one yet, Dean sat with his arms around his legs and his head on his knees, back to the wall. He had opened his door to Cas, but had so far been unresponsive to anything else asked by his house mate.
Dean tried to breathe and not rub himself at the same time. He was still turned on and shocked, and quickly turning into an absolute mess. And he had no idea how Cas was doing.
Cas held out his right hand and Dean took it in his, carefully leaning over the side of the chair. They shook and then Dean headed on out, concerned slightly with how Cas might get around once he was gone.
Dean looked up at Sam, head going slightly upside down over the back of the couch. “Yes it is. Want me to heat it up?”
Dean knocked again, a little louder this time, fully intent on having the goodies for himself if Garth didn’t answer. Still nothing. There was no other sign of Garth, except for his beat-up Ford Ranchero Squire that was in the driveway. Deciding the loot was his for the taking, Dean started to head back to his waiting Impala and then he heard it.
Dean didn’t feel right giving back the tools he’d borrowed and found it easier to just buy Bobby new of what he’d taken. “Yeah, I did.”
by Pink Floyd side two all played through and he hadn’t gotten up to change the LP to another album or to flip it back to side one. He’d been there for over an hour, boots off, staring up at the white ceiling.
Instead of fully admitting anything to anyone, even his therapist, Dean persuaded Sam to ask their parents to come out to Sioux Falls, and convinced Cas that he wanted him to meet his parents. He’d be coming out, though Dean knew his mom had always suspected something. His dad? Dean wasn’t so sure. Dean was expecting some form of emotional pain over the holidays he just wasn’t sure what yet.
Several “whoops” erupted around the table and a smattering of claps. Dean was vaguely aware of Sam doing an embarrassed little brother groan. Once everyone had settled down, they got to eating. Dean couldn’t stop grinning the whole time.
“Dean, it is the middle of the night,” Cas pointed out in an unimpressed voice still groggy with sleep.
Setting down the cloth he was using to clean the counter, Dean gave Garth his attention, resisting the urge to cross his arms across his chest like he was trying to protect his organs. “Sure.”
“Woah, did you guys cut the hedgerow or something?” Sam asked as The Ddraig came into view from the side of the road.
Cas took several steps away from the wall, his shadow growing as he did. Behind him, his shadow contorted and grew into a hulking form. A long serpentine neck twisting and unfurling, feathers running down its sides, as a smooth tail also curled along in the shadows. A pair of immense wings unfurled, feathered silhouettes on the wall. The shadow snaked up the wall as tall as the ceiling, more than fifteen feet away from the floor.
“Where we at?” Dean asked, like he normally did when he was on the couch and Cas was watching one of his shows.
Jack’s pale form shimmered as he stood in front of Cas, the air in the ballroom that touch colder than the rest of the hotel. Dean stepped into the ballroom and both Jack and Cas turned to Dean.
Getting out from behind the counter, Dean went over to the front door and flipped the sign there from “closed” to “open”. Outside, the morning was just starting to really brighten with September sunshine. He went back behind the counter and checked on the industrial filter coffee pot they always kept going during open hours, for the “no time to make a fuss” drink crowd who just wanted caffeine—and given the chance to absorb intravenously, probably would.
Sam looked away for the briefest second, a cloud of regret on his face, before turning back. “If it’s too much, too soon, you don’t have to. I’m sure we can figure-”
Even after talking things through and reaching an understanding, it took over a week for Dean to feel comfortable around Garth again. Part of his discomfort was Garth not feeling like he could come to Dean about what had happened to him, but then Dean hadn’t even said anything about being a medium so it wasn’t like he was without fault. He wanted to tell Garth, he just wasn’t ready yet.
The lock in the front door turned and Dean set the tablet aside as he waited for Sam to find him in the living room. It was past nine, Dean had eaten hours ago and had left Sam’s food in the oven, ready to be heated up.
Dean’s high school experience, where he’d blazed a path for Sam before graduating (which Sam had distinctly not followed), had not only involved the odd joint on school grounds, but taking drama and subsequently getting a leading role for each major production. Wasn’t Dean’s fault if their old drama teacher had little to work with—few guys joined the club—and everyone saw how most of the straight girls in the class acted better when they were around Dean. As if it was some kind of audition to be his girlfriend, which it kind of felt like it was a lot of the time. And then the Fall of
“But that’s not possible. And why can’t you leave the hotel? Dean said you’re agoraphobic. You can leave if you get the right treatment,” Charlie said, voice getting a little higher.
“The realtor thinks we should be able to close this week. I’m pretty confident we can.” Mrs Henderson stirred sugar into her coffee. “I know it’s going to be tough moving there, and Thomas will take some time getting used to it. But it has the space he needs and it’s quieter. And the last time we checked it out, Thomas seemed to like the house.”
Cas smiled. “Okay, Dean. We’ll find a way to ensure your inebriation. We just need to find the right spell to pull down my own wards for a while.”
That stopped Dean in his tracks. Despite his conversation with Charlie that very morning, she had not mentioned anything about their Dungeons and Dragons group or messaged him about it. Dean had joined one with Charlie and her girlfriend, Dorothy, plus a small group of friends who had slowly become Dean’s friends, not long after Dean had come to Sioux Falls. They played every two weeks and next Friday would be their next session.
“Would you like coffee with your breakfast?” Cas asked, back to Dean as he finished plating up the bacon. There were two plates waiting with scrambled eggs on it. There was also a pile of cooked spinach and button mushrooms, and a plate stacked with cinnamon toast. More than Cas could surely eat all to himself—
“So, look, I’ve been thinking, you know what we haven’t done in like a million years? Halloween party. A big one. Costumes. Food. Booze. The works. Like when I was 17,” Sam rushed out. “You know, that big ass party we had when Mom and Dad went away to see Gram and Grandpa Campbell?”
Looking over to Cas, Dean felt a surge of affection as he watched Cas sign with Eileen and Sam, having a full conversation. But while Dean was happy for Cas to be making friends, he had kind of hoped that he might be able to get a dance with Cas.
“Jack? Oh, he had an unfortunate death here… it’s complicated, but for some reason never passed over.”
Setting the mattress against a wall, Bobby rolled his shoulders and stretched his back, things audibly clicking and popping as he did. He turned around on the spot, taking in the space.
“I could go for coffee,” Dean said as he waited for Cas to ask why he had come back into the hotel. Why his freak out seemed to be over or why Dean wasn’t somewhere else across the city.
Putting the latest scanned book onto the shelf for books he’d scanned, Dean felt his cell buzz in his pocket. He pulled it out and saw Sam was calling him. Dean was a little surprised to be getting a call from Sam so late, and hoped nothing had happened to him or Eileen.
“Pretty good. Though one student deleted the class’s entire file server on Monday, so that was fun. The good thing was that I had all their work backed up for them. The bad news? That didn’t include that lesson’s work. So, tomorrow, the first year AP class is going to be redoing Monday’s work.” Charlie sighed and started walking towards the tables. “But they’re good kids.”
Laying out on the gravel to get the keys, Dean fumbled under the car and finally hooked them before scrambling to his feet.
"Dude, you think I’m fucking stupid? You were friggin’ leering at my butt. Raw-dogging me in your mind, I bet. So whatever crap you’re saying it’s only because you wanna get in my pants."
“How about I prepare us some real breakfast, you big sap?” Dean asked, partly to deflect and partly because his stomach grumbled. “We can take Miracle for a walk when we’re done.”
With Cas’ help Dean lifted himself off his boyfriend and settled by his side, curling immediately and lying his head on Cas’ heaving chest. Castiel knew he looked a total mess, hair surely spiked in all directions, face flushed, eyes watery and lips bruised. It was worth it though.
Younger he might’ve been, but Dean did most of the cooking in the house, seeing as Castiel’s culinary skills were passable at best, and Dean, on the other hand, was all about treating himself with nice home-cooked meals. Obviously, he was well-fed.
"Excuse my staring and this may come off as a cheap excuse, but would you believe me if I said I was honestly mesmerized by your beauty?"
Castiel circled Dean’s waist in his arms and rested his forehead on Dean’s shoulder. He was trying not to give in, not to take Dean when the boy was giving him mixed signals, when he himself couldn’t think logically. The ancient chant of
Castiel licked his lips, a bad habit that only worsened their dryness. “May I ask, how come you’re so certain?”
Now, that Dean slept around was a well-known fact, and everyone who bedded him had nothing but praises for the boy. That or streaks of jealous possessiveness coursing through their veins, or both. But as much as Dean loved taking it up the ass (and, if rumors were true, he loved it to the point of being a total cockslut for it), not once did the Omega let any Alpha knot him, not even Cassie, an Alpha with whom he seemed particularly smitten.
The young man leaned down to ruffle the hair on his pet’s head, and said, “What say you, Miracle? Think we can trust him?”
“Tell you what. You keep the crop top, show off your perky little nipples, but change into a nice pair of jeans. How’s that?”
Castiel felt his dick grow chubby and his mouth start salivating. He’d always been an ass guy, appreciative of his partner’s curves, but never in his life had he been spellbound by it. He was reaching new lows, or maybe the man before him was truly a god.
Cas appreciated honesty and directness. He liked that Dean called him out, even if he was only partially correct. Yes, he wanted to fuck Dean, but he had also been physically unable to tear his gaze away. No, he was not lying just to get in Dean’s pants.
Before, Castiel thought the list of alphas who ate Dean out had to be shorter than those who fucked him. Most alphas were all about fucking after all, but now that he’d gotten a taste for himself, he wasn’t so certain.
He could feel Dean’s asshole leaking on his knot, every drop invigorating his Alpha and telling Castiel to push his cock deep inside that heat without any sort of preparation. Dean was squelching wet, so there was no need. More than anything, Castiel wanted to fuck the Omega so hard and so thoroughly the whole school heard Dean’s cries of pleasure. He wanted to split that tight, famished hole on his knot, inevitably claiming Dean’s knot-virginity and locking their bodies together, so the Omega would nurse Castiel’s balls empty.
Taking all this into account, Castiel had no clue how Dean did it, fuck his way through school, and not take a single knot, or get pregnant for that matter. From what he knew, the boy was not on the pill either. It was no wonder whatsoever that he reeked so deliciously.
Dean laughed, brash and spirited once again. He wiggled his ass, ever the tease and ducked to kiss Castiel on the lips.
Dean felt so good clamped around his cock, he was slippery and his scent was overpowering. Needing more, Castiel flipped Dean around and got up, pushing Dean’s chest flat on the desk. Standing up, with Dean extended before him like a feast, it was easier to surrender to his deranged Alpha, and the intense but unhurried fuck turned into a relentless pistoning of sharp hips pounding against Dean’s plump ass, propelling him forward with each thrust.
"Novak. Wanna earn some last minute extra credit?" his Philosophy teacher asked. Castiel basically acted as her TA. A title easy enough to claim when no one else wanted it, and one with more than a few perks too, included using the teacher’s break room anytime he wanted, as well as free access to the coffee-machine and the microwave. Thanks to that and his packed lunch, he could skip the cafeteria altogether. A Dean-free lunchtime was bliss.
Every person in Truman High who had eyes or a nose knew that Dean Winchester was the most mouth-watering, desirable and charming Omega to grace its corridors without putting up a show and simply being his genuine, likeable self.
How anyone could hold a grudge against Dean and deliberately cause him harm was beyond Castiel, his Alpha was seething, but it was simply a natural protective response, and years of stupid one-sided pining. Regardless, the present situation demonstrated that some lines were not to be crossed. If any vow should be regarded as holy, Castiel was sure it’d be marriage. Mating was pure, honest, and trespasses against the bond could hardly be forgiven, even if one of the perpetrators was the most appetizing Omega in the whole county.
Castiel lapped at the Dean’s outer rim, circling the zone and moving south down now and then, caressing Dean’s balls, and back right up, kittenish licks finally landing in the middle. The teasing little muscle refused to be breached at first as Dean made a noise above him. Castiel spit on the hole, fat glob of saliva making it twinkle like the star it was.
He started his morning prayer with a peck at the top of Dean’s crack and makes his way down, down, nuzzling like a damn dog sniffing at bitch in heat. It was an appropriate comparison, but not one he’d share with Dean, yet. His boyfriend still struggled to admit he was a bit of a slut.
And if being welcome to all meant that Dean spent fifteen minutes a week sitting with Thomas and his mom—so be it. Dean sipped his water as Mrs Henderson cut Thomas’s brownie into equal chunks. Once that had been done, she pushed the plate to Thomas and, without looking up from his train and with a brief pause, Thomas said “thank you” and took his first bite. Dean met Mrs Henderson’s eyes and smiled.
Dean looked to his left and then felt a presence immediately beside him, out of his field of vision. He spun round and held in a scream as his light picked up the ghostly form of a young man with sunken eyes and a curious look on his face.
Sam chuckled and put a hand through his hair. “Fine. I’ll pick out their Christmas present this year.”
“I haven’t been to a party since New Year’s Eve, 1979.” Cas crossed his arms over his chest. “And I think I deserve a party too.”
When Cas slammed the door to his rooms closed, Dean found himself thankful that they had had the foresight to put everyone else on different floors to the floor the two of them occupied. Cold fingers made hard work of removing clothes, but soon they were both naked and kissing and Cas was worked them towards his bedroom and the bed there.
Awkwardly and with sweat sticking his shirts to his back by this point, Dean and Bobby angled the mattress into the rear of the tan colored van. His bed frame, dismantled, was already in the van along with the few pieces of furniture he owned. He had a key ready in his back pocket for getting in and out of The Ddraig, its gates and the building, and his new rooms as needed. They’d take a second trip to come back and get the rest of his things.
“It’s spacious,” Dean said. Thursday night, Dean and Cas had agreed to have dinner at the same time and Dean had cooked up spaghetti and meatballs, which Cas had practically made sound like it was sex on a plate. They’d sat at different ends of a large dining table, nearly shouting to each other, but Cas’s response to the food had been obvious enough. They wouldn’t be having dinner together Friday night, as Dean would be heading over to Charlie’s for Dungeons and Dragons, but Cas had promised to cook something for Saturday. Dean had wondered how Cas was going to get ingredients for cooking and had then remembered that Cas seemed pretty adept at doing stuff online.
Charlie had caught him in the process of freaking out and had spent a moment feeling the non-seasonal icy chill that had gone down Dean’s spine. She hadn’t seen the man on the edge of the dock sinking to the watery depths below, but she had felt it. There was always something about Charlie, for as long as Dean had known her, that made him feel like he could talk to her about the truth and not be judged. So, he’d told her what he’d seen and felt. It wasn’t something that came up very often, that Dean saw and felt such things, but with her asking about the listing, Dean decided that maybe he could say something.
“Watch it, you idjit!” Bobby growled from the other end of the mattress he was shifting with Dean as they walked down the path to the sidewalk and the waiting van. Bobby was like a second father to Dean, had been ever since he’d moved to Sioux Falls. He’d been a distant figure to Sam and Dean as they grew up in Lawrence, but he was an old buddy of their father’s and they’d spent many a summer over at Bobby’s after they started to drive their parents mad. It wasn’t like the Winchesters could afford summer camp.
“Why didn’t you just get yourself new tools?” Sam frowned eyes focused entirely on Dean, making him feel like he was strapped to a chair, glaring light beaming down on him.
“Cheap tricks?” Cas’s voice bellowed as Charlie turned around. Dean blinked and suddenly it wasn’t Castiel the human in the room with them, it was Castiel the dragon.
“WOAH! WATCH IT!” Dean yelled. “YOU’LL BURN YOURSELF!” Dean slid off his stool and rushed over to Cas, ready to see badly blistering skin.
Sam looked up, fear and surprise mingling on his face. “Of course we won’t do anything until you find somewhere to move to-”
“Of course.” Charlie bounced on her feet like she had already had an oat milk latte with a double shot of espresso that morning, but that was just Charlie.
The whole shift passed like there was something invisible between Garth and Dean, and Garth was visibly puzzled by it. Each time he tried to start conversations with Dean, Dean struggled to remain his useful cheerful self. When there was a real lull in the afternoon, Dean knew Garth was going to try talking to him.
“Sure, Cas. Come on in,” Dean said, stepping to the side so that there would be enough room for Cas. He heard the rustling of a towel and then Cas pulled the shower door open and stepped inside.
“Hello, Dean!” Cas replied, voice surprisingly happy, considering he’d been stuck in the bathtub for over an hour by that point.
Jack had already tried to leave the hotel and failed to do so, but he was still looking on the bright side. “So, now we know for a hundred percent that one of the spells found worked. We just need to finish getting everything for the one binding me and Cas here, right?”
Going into autopilot, Dean drove the busy roads of Sioux Falls as the working day began to end, and allowed his mind to be completely blank. He drove to The Ddraig, finding it with no effort and parked up like he normally did. It wasn’t until he cut the engine that he remembered he hadn’t put a cassette on or the radio like he normally would.
The three Djinn roll their eyes, but comply. Djinn One and Two get up from their chairs, and Jack sits down patiently in one of them. Djinn Two starts tying him up while Jerry and Djinn One sigh and watch.
Before that can sink in too hard, Sam forcefully grabs Dean's shoulder to huddle up TFW in a circle facing away from Amara.
This is the first disappearance, her name was, uh, Jenny Brown. Thirteen years old, lived here with her sister, mother, and father.
Don’t Dean me, I’m pissed at you! You wanna go out with a speech like that and just- expect me to be fine? “Dean, you’re not a killer, oh but by the way, I’m going to die because of you!”
“I don’t know what I’m doing anymore, Cas,” he admits, like a sin to a pastor in confession. “I don’t know what I’m doing,” he pleads again, staring directly into those baby blues.
Cas’ lips quiver as he finishes, just as they did before he was taken by the Empty. It’s so much better to see him crying of happiness now, because now he’s not going to die. He’s not going to say his peace and leave, he’s going to
angels from the Empty. Apparently, too, that’s where the Old Death had been residing, and he’s invited too (On the one condition that Dean is allowed nowhere near the Scythe, and apologizes profusely with greasy food).
I hope you can- can hear me Cas. Castieell, pretty name Angel. Why’d you fall? Fell for me? Why me, I’m not that nice, I’m not even good...
Jack raises his hand and starts jumping up and down, waiting to be acknowledged. The three djinn slowly turn their heads to look at him. I mean, the audacity of this kid. Jerry’s a little amused, but the other two are just annoyed.
So frustration, and bridezillla Cas (and maybe a little feistiness came out in Dean, too), and flowers and food aside, they’re here.
Dean shakes it off, trying not to look into his eyes because he’s aware that if left to their own devices, they’ll make Dean spill every secret he’s ever known. Probably even the pink panty thing.
Dean washes his face off, staring at himself in the mirror. The camera closes in on his shoulder, the handprint barely hidden by his sleeve, but Dean tries to ignore it. Then the handprint starts to glow light red, burning.
Dean’s face immediately falls, looking guilty. His cocky attitude took a vacation. He starts to fidget with his necklace (the Samulet). He sits down on the desk next to Glenn.
They smile at each other and kiss again, this time taking longer. And oh- moment ruined. Dean shows up, holding Jack to his chest, and MIRACLE running by his feet. He wolf-whistles.
Dean’s just staring at Cas, disbelieving. Jack smiles and bear hugs (to the best of a 3-year-old’s ability) Dean and Cas. Cas stirs. Dean tenses and puts his hand on Cas’ shoulder, steadying him.
Lucifer stabs a demon blade into the demon’s hand, skewering it on the chair’s arm rests. It SCREAMS out, low and, well, demonic.
Dean came out of that room to grab a bottle of whiskey, then retreated to his own room. Sam heard hics, sobs, small whimpers coming from beyond that door. He was tempted to do the same, except… Jack needed him, and the world needed him. Eileen-
Sam raises his eyebrows. Dean stares him down, but ultimately gives in and throws his arms out to his sides.
No. But I have the option to be. You are not my keeper, Dean, no matter- my- my feel- no- no matter.
“I never thought my father would go this far.” Michael stared into oblivion, then took a deep breath, eyes glowing. His whole demeanor shifted, slouching a bit, not casually, but out of habit, and his weight shifted more to the left foot.
Me. I mean, out of all people... me. And it was enough for him to just say it. I-I didn’t have the time, I didn’t have the time to say it back. He died not knowing I-I...
Before anyone can say anything, she snaps her fingers again. ANGLE ON JACK as we see the world flash to-
Dean sipped coffee then set the mug down abnormally slowly. He blinked several times. "A girl?" Dean then looked down to the state of his bruises, "Ohh, yeah. Mhm and it was good," Dean waggled his eyebrows up and down.
he’s getting married to that man. Cas steps next to Dean and reaches out his hands, which he eagerly accepts, holding tightly, probably harmfully if it weren’t for the fact that they’re in Heaven.
Dean serves up the mediocre food for Jack on the cheap plates on the motel room table. He then hands some of the beer to Sam and Eileen, but drinks the rest. The research papers and laptops have been piled up on the side to give him room to eat.
Dean grabs a tall candle holder and works his way over to a section of stone labeled “HERE LIES PASTOR JOHN WILLIAMS.” He jams the candle holder into the side of it.
rules. So she rattles whatever she does off, and Dean’s pretty sure it’s sarcastic and sappy and hilarious from the equal amount of tears and laughter in the audience, but he just doesn’t care. Because standing in front of him is
We turn around and see MEG, the real Meg (well, the Demon at least) standing and doing her very own broadway show. She’s got her arms out dramatically, grinning.
Did you know AC/DC is slang for bisexual? It stands for Alternating Current slash Direct Current, meaning going both ways.
We were just wondering if anything was out of the ordinary the day of Jenny’s disappearance. Strange behavior, smells, little weird things that might clue us in on what happened?
And then if I convince him it is? Then what? I j-just, talk about my damn feelings? What the fuck? aND-
Cece nods, a little disbelieving. How could that have helped with a federal investigation? Sam gives Cece his signature guilty puppy-dog-eyed grimace.
Look, I want to give you time, okay? But there’s been time. It’s been almost a month and you only ever get out of the bunker to get liquor and children’s toys for Jack.
When Dean Winchester arrived in heaven, he found peace. Or something. That’s what he told everyone else, at least. Bobby asked, he said he loved the whole paradise shit. Loved driving endlessly searching for C-
I swear to god if you end that sentence with “it’s okay to be gay” I’m going to shove you down the next set of stairs I find.
Adam stopped pacing and Sam looked to Jack with hope in his eyes. Damn, it hurt to see his little brother hope, but in a bright way. Dean idly hoped Sam would get out of this mess, find a girl, settle down, while he swished the beer in his bottle ‘round and ‘round. “That could mean something.” Adam said, not really bringing Dean back to reality but reminding him that the option was there. “Let Michael-” inhale, glowing eyes.
I mean, I don’t get it. First hit in LA, second in New York, and now we’re here, what’s this town even called again?
No, I believe J- Megator is right. The only way to save the... train conductor... is for Megator to do- what was it?
As I was saying, we should find a way to scope out the area well enough to know what we’re going into. Valeria is powerful, and she has an Archangel on her side.
, “like you say. Second coming of God, technically, yeah. But they wanna both worship me and run for the ‘hills!’ I don’t know what to do.”
Robert turns a corner, scrambling like a mad man, but Pastor John is there, waiting. Robert slides to a stop and stares at Pastor John for a beat. Then he starts sprinting in the opposite direction.
Glenn smiles and leans back into Dean. A series of cuts to show time passes, and don’t tell Dean, but we can see him legitimately cuddling into Glenn.
Jack flips his phone 180 to show to Castiel and jumps up and down. Castiel smiles proudly, before seeing the content of the phone.
Turns out the church they dropped her off? Supposedly haunted by these two gay nuns. You think they killed her?
I might be able to get you out of here too. Might. Besides, whatever fucked up thing you had with Cas, you had something. Are you in?
Took you long enough! I’m pretty sure a Winchester had time to die and come back twice in as long as I’ve been here.
Dean shrugs, then catches Stacy’s eyes, giving her another wink. She smiles back, bites her lip briefly, then turns to her work.
Castiel then looks at Dean, staring at him sorrowfully. He leans in and caresses the side of Dean’s face, who leans into it. (Trust the Jacting Choices: Dean stares longingly into Cas’ eyes.)
I’m just saying, I took care of the ghosts and that was it. I’m not- not traumatized or some shit by Riverton. It was just-
The motel door is suddenly busted down, it clatters on the floor. We CUT back to see TFW’s reactions - now utterly serious (sorry to cut the fun off, guys), then slowly PAN UP from the door to Lucifer, standing menacingly in the doorway. Castiel shucks his Angel Blade out of his coat sleeve and Dean and Sam grab their guns.
Dean, carrying Jack, carrying Marvelous Marvin the Talking Teddy, Sam, and Eileen walk down the Bunker’s entrance stairs with their hunting bags. When they reach the bottom, Sam and Eileen put their duffles on the Map Table. Dean puts Jack down, who goes running for Miracle.
Dean goes over to try and free the youngest victim, a little boy that looks a little like Jack. Sam rushes to start freeing others and Eileen keeps her knife raised, surveying the area for if the Djinn attack.
persay considering we’re talking about like, whole lives here... Uh. Y’know, an announcement. About life. And love… lives.”
I was an asshole, then it was ok between us, I guess. He had a son around the same time he... left, and I raised him all the wrong ways.
Sam doesn’t say anything, just staring at Eileen lovingly. She looks at him back expectantly and oh - right. Sam’s supposed to be answering a question.
“Can it, dad, Cas is older than you, so you can’t use the age card. Anyway,” Dean claps his hands together mock joyfully. “Get out of my house!”
So this guy pulled me out of hell, literally, then we were kinda at odds for a year. When he turned to my side, I had my eyes on this girl. Then she forgot about me, then he made a mistake, and then another one, and after we dealt with that, we were stuck in the same place for a year.
“So, food’s ready. You guys can go ahead, sit down.” Dean leads them to the dining table like a good host and nods at the seats for encouragement. Him and Cas head to the kitchen briefly to grab everyone’s plates, then deliver them in front of the family. John sits at the head of the table with Mary next to him, and Eileen next to her. Sam ends up on the other head, with Dean next to him and
Dean breathes in deeply to work up the courage, then begins. “Cas. Castiel. I- You have been one sneaky bastard, just jumping into my life and making me care about you. Making me
The guest is cut off as they SCREAM. The blue tattooed hand reaches back and impales the guest’s neck with each finger. The hand is pulled back. The blood wipes off on a dress. The guest falls to the ground, creating a pool of blood, their dead eyes staring into the distance.
She had said it was only a formality. She could only give over the fruit to a spouse, and we needed the fruit. I will not regret this decision either.
Castiel comes back mid May, more than six months after... after. He says "Jack says I was needed here," smilling.
to break down another human being with your manipulative, abusive, and horribly stupid words. However, I have a deep love for your son, and he has found it in himself to forgive you.” John struggles but is immediately slammed back down.
“Him!” Dean buries his face in his hands to hide his embarrassment. “It’s a him, okay? I’m in love with
“Now that Amara and Chuck are fused, they’ll be harder to take down. But, we don’t really need to. We just need to stall them long enough to be able to banish them to the Empty.”
Dean gives himself a glare in the mirror, mouthing “it’s your fault,” while holding on to the handprint scar.
It’s a typical crappy motel room, with the ugly floral walls and stained carpet. There are already papers set about on the beds and tables, duffle bags and clothes sitting on the floor.
Dean takes the hint and grabs Cas by the shoulders and hoists him up. Cas blinks his eyes open, delirious.
Alliance or not, you’re bound to me. You owe me this, and if you do not give it, I’ll take his life. Choose.
“I’m afraid for your sanity, Dean. Clearly, by Sam’s superior judgement, you, being you, would never have the emotional availability to commit yourself to any one partner for eternity. Therefore, as you claim to be engaged, you are not yourself.”
“I know, kid,” Dean chuckles. “It’s an expression. Don’t you, like, know everything now that you’re capital G God?”
Castiel stands up slowly. The blood dries on him. Dean’s just gazing longingly and shocked at him and the scene around.
Mrs Brown sniffles pitifully and gets a half-hearted pat on the back from Mr Brown. A beat passes with Dean sizing the two up, then he holds up his head to gesture a “wait hold up.”
There was a full ass screaming match about who gets to give who away, and who is going to be given away. Naturally, Sam and Cas were the ones fighting over it. Sam wanted to give Dean away because
Why does dad have to send you on a hunt on your birthday Dean! We were gonna go to the arcade, it was gonna be so much fun! Won’t the ghosts be there tomorrow?
“You’re gonna drink me out of businesss, boy,” Ellen snarks, with that stupid real concern behind her eyes. Doesn’t matter.
