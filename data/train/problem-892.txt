This is in fact the first half of the chapter I am currently writing.  I was feeling a little guilty for the cliffhanger.  As a reader,  I find it is torture to wait for an update when a chapter ends in such dramatic fashion.  The idea came to me that the first part would work as a whole chapter and would shorten the waiting time for you.  My beta reader agreed and worked hard to have it done as quickly as possible.
"Tomorrow, surely, Lestrade will have found out where Beeks went."
"I want you to eat a little something before we go."
"Sherlock," John interrupts him softly, taking his hands into his own; they’re shaking.
"You know why it's my favourite jumper, right?  That's the one I was wearing the day we kissed for the first time."
Sherlock’s lips are wet and plump.  It takes all but one second before they part open, while the rest of his body relaxes.  A little.  An almost inaudible noise escapes Sherlock’s throat, a short whine, high-pitched and trembling.  John has to part his lips, then, because he needs to swallow it.  It’s his.  He’s responsible for that sound, and it’s going straight to his groin.
"I still think I am not fit to raise a child.  Our life is not one into which a child can be included. This isn't hesitation, it is just..."
"Try to figure it out while I'm gone," he replies playfully, winking.
Luckily, in the eight months they've been together, Sherlock's silence has been easier to break.  Physical intimacy seems to soothe him like nothing else, not even the violin.  Bringing Sherlock back from wherever he has retired to with a séance of cuddle on the couch or a slow, languid blowjob isn't exactly disagreeable.  It makes John wonder, sometimes, what sort of man Sherlock would be today if he hadn't starved himself from any form of affection for so long.
know.  When he appears in the waiting room of the A & E, Anthea following him like a shadow, John himself has been waiting for ten...no... almost twelve minutes.
This chapter is kind of sweet.  I hope you will enjoy it.
There is light ahead, and a brick wall.  McMasters will have to choose to turn left or right and this hesitation will more likely give John the opportunity to stop her.
"Not even one?"
"You were doing something good, not trying to render your life bearable by destroying yourself."
“John?”
"Home."
Louisa Holmes lifts a playful eyebrow at him.  "Of course, I have, dear, and many, many more."
"Is he?  Insomniac, I mean?"
Mycroft is leaning back against a tree, rubbing his hands together to generate some heat.  When they speak, their breath comes out in white vapour.
They can hear Mycroft’s voice from the kitchen.  He got on his phone as soon as they arrived.  Even though John cannot make out the words, he guesses Mycroft doesn’t have good news, and knowing him, it must be extremely annoying.  He’s used to getting what he wants, when he wants it, but it appears even the puppet master of the British government doesn’t have any power over the elements.  Huh.  Who would have thought?
John wraps his arm around Sherlock’s shoulders and caresses his belly with his free hand.  They stay in a peaceful, enjoyable silence, for several minutes.
Sherlock reaches the table, rubbing at his eyes, puts a hand on John's shoulders and bends over him.
"You guys are... I mean, you have..."
"It is just the beginning, Sherlock," John adds, playing with his hair.  "We'll always worry about her.  Even when she's seventeen and going off to college, probably way more by then."
Thank you all!
"What's the matter, Anderson, never seen a pregnant man before?" Sherlock snaps at him.
"No, John, we need to talk."
John nods, unable to explain himself. Trust Sherlock to have so high an opinion of his genius brain he really believes it is his idea that has John teary-eyed. He's literally beaming with self-satisfaction.
"Oh, I suppose I can spare five minutes," Sherlock says, speaking over Beeks again.  "If it is truly a pretty room."
; it reminds him of Christmas’s back home, of him and Harriet being forced to join the Christmas choir every year, always reluctantly, trying to get out of the obligation, although in the end, they enjoyed it very much.
Sherlock is so exasperated his eyeroll reaches epic proportions.  "I will not deduce the teacher out loud, even if I think I know better than him, or her.   The same goes with participants, as I have been informed by a certain someone that thinking they are a bunch of idiots does not allow me to state that very fact."
John sits beside him, their thighs touching.  A moment passes, swelled with awkwardness.  John has time to think that maybe Sherlock just isn’t ready to talk.  He might need time to process a handful of new facts and sensations.  But then, the detective clears his throat.
John snorts.
Sherlock's face is crumbling, as if he's going to start crying again.  John takes a deep breath and wraps an arm around his shoulder.  Sherlock immediately lets his head fall on that shoulder, his locks caressing John's cheek.
Outside, the thunder is louder than ever, shaking the ground beneath them. There is a series of lightning strikes, illuminating the inside of the cottage in a shade of electric blue.
about it, is another game entirely.
"I know," Sherlock nods.  "That is why I couldn't bring myself to destroy the real one.”
"And as of now?" Mycroft inquires once he is done.
The other choice would be to walk in and take the lead, stating the truth before Sherlock guesses it –it would save the both of them time and energy.  It is, clearly, the best way to go, but John find himself at loss of how to do it.  He finds it difficult to talk about his feelings, and it doesn't get better with years, or the regular therapy session.  Hell, at this point, even beer can't go down, and John is supposed to speak?  About feelings, using actual words?
"What are you talking about?"
Chapter 2
"You're staring," Sherlock murmurs, crossing his arms over his chest.
John shakes his hand, startled by warmness of the gesture.  Does he know anything at all about Mycroft Holmes, besides what he has learned to see through Sherlock's eyes?
Two minutes later, the nappy is tied up, all neat and equal.  Sherlock has the same expression he gets when he’s just made an especially clever deduction.
“Yes, I am.  It’s alright, Sherlock.  I’ve done this before, you know.”
The paint job will have to wait for tomorrow, but at least the room is empty and clean.  John proposes to go grab something at the Thai restaurant down the street, which Sherlock has been especially fond of for the past couple of months. A pregnancy craving?  John hasn’t dared bring it up, he just has the feeling Sherlock would be insulted enough to refuse eating there anymore.
“Aren’t you worried, John?”
::: :::
“It’s not something I made up from deducing my brother, Doctor.  It is a fact, that he has...” Mycroft shifts in his chair, looking uncomfortable.  “Feelings for you.”
"Gotta go, thanks for... well, thanks."
John gives himself a mental pat on the shoulder and slides his hand in his vest's pocket to grab hold of his gun.  Sherlock is perfectly immobile, staring to their left with the intensity of an eagle.  John breathes in deeply, feeling the adrenaline pumping in his veins.  He doesn't know what Sherlock has planned to do and it's ok.  That's how well they work together.  A sign from Sherlock will put John into action, whatever it is he needs to do.
Sighing, John lays his hands on Sherlock's hips and presses a kiss between his shoulder blades, resting his forehead there.
And then the pleasure overtakes him.  It's long, intense, a series of aftershocks that makes him fear they won't even stop.  Sherlock holds his penis still, his fingers coated in John's sperm.  He has a little satisfied smile, looking up at John.
"He texted me after you were attacked.  I'm glad he did, John."
So, yes, writing a labour and delivery scene is such an amazing opportunity to provide comfort, but it doesn't come without hurt.  Although, of course, mpreg is a fantasy, I am always pushed toward realistic medical details, because of my background.  I try to take labour and delivery scenes seriously, as though I would write about a woman giving birth.  So, most of the medical details in this fic are accurate, and if I took some liberties, it is mainly regarding the male aspect of Mpreg.  I am not a sadist, and I hope I did not scare any of you who wants to have kids :)  .  The details might be realistic, but Sherlock's labour is quite unique, in the sense that he doesn't have a lot of option to deal with the pain.  His emotional distress is, mainly, circumstantial.   Childbirth is an intense experience, and the wonder of writing it in a hurt/comfort setting is that the pain isn't useless, and leads to a wonderful consequence.  I guess, what I am saying is that I do not like my characters to suffer in vain, and I hope it isn't what transpired of it.
And well, what can John do except groan and obey, letting his dick take the lead.
"Oh I am sorry, Sherlock, if I haven't considered those deductions, which would have been difficult since you haven't told me anything!" John replies, lifting his arms in exasperation."I am working nonstop to make you as comfortable and happy as possible, yet you haven't even noticed all the cleaning I've been doing, and the grocery shopping and buying the bloody couch, when you know how much I hate shopping!  And all the while you get to be the world's only consulting detective and I'm not even your blogger anymore, I am your housekeeper for Christ’s sake!"
"Listen, Harry, it just... I wanted to, but somehow I always found myself postponing it.   It was wrong, I should have-"
“I um... need to sit,” Sherlock murmurs, his voice still low and scratchy.
John takes a long look at Sherlock.  "You do not usually get involved in the consequences of a case, on what solving it really means for the people implicated."
“You’re an idiot,” Sherlock points out.  “So, yes, I went to see my dear brother, and since my personal doctor has insisted that I should give up on hard drugs altogether I decided to get drunk.  Which wasn’t very clever of me.  I have a very low tolerance when it comes to alcohol.”
Sherlock sits abruptly and runs his fingers through his hair.  It is not his commanding tone, though, that has John up and dressing himself.  It's the look of pure terror he can read on his face.  Nevertheless...
"Oh, god, Sherlock, look at you, love, just... look.  Beautiful.  Perfect, lovely."
"You definitely proposed, though."
"Are you sick?" John wonders.
"I do own you and Lestrade my life," John whispers.
“Oh, Sherlock,” Mycroft shakes his head, expression fond as he’s reminded of the memory.  “You were so gullible.”
John was eager to check Sherlock’s dilatation, as soon as they were back.  Sherlock had been reluctant, and John can guess why.  He doesn’t want to know.  He’s scared that the labour is going too fast for help to arrive in time.  John gets it, god, does he, but it’s no use to be in denial.
After refusing to eat lunch and failing to drag John into an argument, Sherlock indulges himself to a long sulking session on the couch.
John might be gone for a little longer than anticipated.  He gets rid of Sherlock's urine samples and scientific material but finds himself distracted by what has just happened and what is to come. He saves the three positive pregnancy test, though.  Three very real, very
"What is wrong with it?" Sherlock snaps, grabbing the sheets to cover himself while he pushes John away with one foot.
John can't help himself, he bursts out laughing.  Sherlock stops mid-sentence, frowns, then throws him an outraged look and begins to protest.
At the hospital, Dr. Brown had told them they should have acted sooner when her initial recommendation hadn't worked.  Sherlock's state was serious enough that it could endanger his life and the baby's.  In his current state, he showed signs of a tear in the oesophagus and an inflammation of the gums, his electrolytes were unbalanced, he lacked iron and other vitamins -and, of course, there was the weight loss.  Two days later, Sherlock had started a drug therapy, a combination of two different medications that were safe for the baby.  He hadn't even protested, which John had feared he would, or required time to do his own research.  John knew he had been scared, even though he tried not to show it.  When you are in such a desperate state, it's difficult to keep up a façade.
"Yes, I know it is less effective because of the pregnancy.  Would you mind letting me complain still?" Sherlock says a bit harshly.  He then clears his throat as if to demonstrate to John he is serious about the issue.
"I am very bad at taking free time.  Gives me too much time to think, and not much to think of," Sherlock explains, the nervous edge to his voice still present.  "John, I... I don't know if I can get away from it.  The Work.  This is my dilemma.  It should be quite easy.  Exposing you to any sort of unnecessary danger is out of the question.  Therefore, ending my collaboration with New Scotland Yard and private clients is the way to go.  I have changed."
"Yes, but it does mean a lot to everyone else."
John finds Mrs Hudson getting ready to go out, as the workers are finishing Sherlock's laboratory today, and she doesn't want to be in the way.  It takes some time to find the air conditioner, but when they do, Mrs. Hudson offers it to them.  She's been careful to limit her visits lately, even though John and Sherlock haven't said anything.  It seems she understands how this particular period of their lives belongs only to them.  "You boys are nesting," she had said.  At the same time, John knows they can count on her whenever they need her, and he is glad the woman in her eighties will have the chance to meet their daughter and be a grandmother to her, since she had never had children of her own.
"Thank you, Mycroft."
“My head hurts, will you just shut up, you stupid git,” John goes for grumpy Doctor Watson, hoping to defuse the situation.
“Hum... I just lost the mucus plug, I think,” he says, looking up at John.
She's jumping him.  He cannot react, not fast enough, as they roll on the ground.  He needs to immobilise her, what the hell is happening why can't he seem to-
"Of course, it is not like you need my permission, part of me is yours now," Sherlock snarls, his voice still a murmur.
“It did allow me to speak to Mycroft, but I might have underestimated the quantity of wine I imbibed.  I was... not in control anymore and I might have said things I didn’t meant to say.  Mycroft, the insufferable block head, wasn’t of any use, since he tried to convince me that you were interested in me and that I should... act on my feelings.  It was surreal.”
He lifts his arm and presses his palm on the side of Sherlock's face, as softly as possible.  Sherlock leans into it, sighing.
Ah.  Yes.  Here goes.  First, there is the blush on the cheeks and shifty eyes, then Sherlock's agile hands unfastening the button of his trousers.  The button hangs down at the end of a couple of centimetres of thread, because it's been tugged at and forced in place for too long.
"Mmh." John's hand joins Sherlock's. On the small screen, the image is enlarged to show the head only.
"I’ve never lasted that long.  To tell you the truth I am quite pleased with myself."
"Of course you can't, you are a single mother," Sherlock says out of nowhere.
Yes, there is an "and".
John apologises and falls back in his chair, looking for his Scotch glass.
Sadly, the musical interlude lasts for all of five minutes. When Sherlock needs to stop for the third time to sneeze, he throws the violin on his chair in frustration and goes into his room, closing the door behind him, which is a sure sign he wants to be left alone. John is more than happy to comply.  He's sure Sherlock is tired enough to sleep if he sulks long enough.  John settles for a quiet afternoon of reading by the fire when he begins hears some shuffling noise in the bedroom.
"Yes, John?"
Sherlock shivers, like the word disgusts him.  John tries not to show the sudden burst of desire rising in him.  He shouldn’t be this aroused by the fact.  Sherlock trusts him enough to be frank and honest, open in a way he has never been before.  John doesn’t want it to seem like the reason he’s interested in him has anything to do with his virginity.  It’s more than a sexual thing, though; it’s knowing that he’s the first for everything.  It’s incredibly empowering, but it’s also unnerving.  What if John just can’t be that person to give Sherlock what he needs? What if, once he’s familiar with physical intimacy and sentiment, Sherlock realises that he could choose someone better, wiser, more good-looking?  It’s not like Sherlock would have problems regarding the choice of a partner.  On the contrary, he must have had to turn back advances on a pretty regular basis.
Sherlock swallows, his breath hitching.  John holds him tighter.  "It never leaves my thoughts, even though I try so hard to occupy my mind otherwise.  A part of my mind seems to have decided it was a good idea to dedicate itself to my fears, and the worst scenarios I can imagine swirl around one after the other.  There are so many things that can go wrong when a child is born, for the child as well as the father, and so many illnesses and birth defects that cannot be diagnosed in the womb.  It is driving me crazy, John.  I am used to managing my thoughts like a rider does a carriage driven by a wild horse, with firmness and a great amount of willpower.  My brain is so incredibly fast that if I do not hold the reins firmly, my thoughts escape to many different directions and it gets impossible to function."
“Hey,” John coaxes in a softly commanding tone.  “Hey, look at me.”
What he sees is Sherlock walking back to him, tiny snowflakes caught in his dark hair.  Smiling.  On his left, though, coming from the front of the house, someone is approaching, quickly.  A man, seemingly distressed, and angry.  The man sees Sherlock and begins to run.  Two police officers are following, one of them yelling.
Sherlock complies.  He eats slowly while John drives through the night.  They don't talk any more, but the silence between them is, for the first time in two weeks, comfortable.
Chapter 3
"Twelve minutes, challenge accepted."
Sherlock has a sarcastic smile, but the compliment gets to him nevertheless, the blush rising on his cheeks a sure indication.  "Not only are you biased, but you are also a very nice person.  I doubt you would tell me I look horrible even if it were the case."
John is sceptical.  On the first suggestion he makes, though, Sherlock snaps at him.  "John, I have no use of your senseless theories, though they usually provide me with a direction I immediately know
"You'll notice that my brother is a bit ... tipsy."
Sherlock snorts at that.  "Then, you are forgiven."
Sherlock sniffs.  "Yes, encouraged by Claire Green.  He is caught in her web and now doesn't have a personality of his own anymore.  He'd kill for her again without a second thought."
"According to most websites and a couple of books, all the necessary furniture for a nursery.  The crib, of course, and a chest of drawers.  A changing table -there is, of course, the option of combining the last two, some kind of hybrid."
John gives himself a mental pat on the back.
If you remember the warning for graphic birth in the tags of the fic, well, it starts now.  Those of you who read some of my other stories know that I like to go into great details to describe my labour and delivery scenes.  The warning stands for this chapter and the following two.  You've been warned.
"Oh, really?  Because I thought he was an idiot, compared to your magnificent fucking brain!  You've been saying it often enough until you were certain he believed it and NOW, DAMN IT!  God knows what state he is in!"
"Mycroft, you seem to be in a splendid shape," Sherlock greets his elder with an over-the-top false enthusiasm.
Sherlock's eyes open.  His expression changes from frustration to cautious interest.  "Go on," he says.
He finishes undressing himself and settles on the bed with a bottle of lube that seems to have materialised in his hands.  Looking as John undresses slowly, Sherlock blushes and closes his eyes.
As it turns out, the exercise does him some good.  Adrian is slow, and has a lot of arthritis, so John is the one doing most of the work, which he doesn't mind a bit.
::: :::
he thinks, except it’s Sherlock’s cold, logical voice in his own head.
"No."
However, John is only human.  He lets Sherlock get away with playing the violin for four hours in a row in the middle of the night, not even trying to play something, just having the chords wailing like mutant kittens from hell. Then, there is the state of the flat.  Whenever John comes back from work is to find more stuff laying around, Sherlock always gives the “experiment” excuse, mumbled under his breath while he acts like John is a piece of furniture.
"I found him," Mycroft replies, a little short of breath.
Delicately, John takes Sherlock's face between his hands and lifts it up, forcing him to look back.  Sherlock is chewing on his lower lip.  His chin is trembling.  His eyes are wet but his cheeks dry.  He seems to be fighting very hard to keep whatever control he still has.
It's been five days.
"Yes, love, you're getting close, aren't you?"
Hugs to all of you!
"I am as relieved as you two are," Amy points out.  "Given that you are into your thirty second week, Sherlock, every day that passes is giving your daughter better chances to have a birth with fewer complications."
Sherlock's father arrival in the kitchen puts a stop to his diatribe, which is good.  John isn't a believer, but he likes the idea of a soul, of something intangible, an essence of some sort.  Anyway, it is Christmas, philosophy and atheism can wait.
John takes the socks off his long, arched feet and begins massaging them.    Sherlock is completely shameless regarding how much he likes it.  John doesn't even wait for him to ask anymore.
"So, evidently, the first thing we need to do is find an androcologist.  I trust you have enough contact to direct us toward the most competent of them, although sadly, the choice isn't as wide as one could hope so, and we live in London, not some back country village away from the capital. I do believe, given my dearest brother's position and with your help, we will be able to find someone at least decent to care for me and the embryo's health.  The first appointment should at least include complete blood work, and..."
Then, he fires the gun.
Sherlock stops John from fetching his phone in his pocket.  "No, wait.  Maybe we can walk for a while?  The night is quite agreeable.
John, stressed by Sherlock’s sudden change of behaviour, has to bite his lips to stop himself from shutting Mycroft up.  It would be stupid.  He does need him.  He has the feeling Sherlock’s labour is once more picking up speed.
“We have three minutes before the next contraction, John,” Sherlock points out, trying to keep his voice from shaking.
"God yes."
, and I didn't know if he would pull through.  Let me tell you, you weren't exactly yourself.  I had to call Mycroft because I didn't know how to handle you, you bloody moron!"
When I write an AU,  my brain kind of forces me to stay as close to the original canon as possible, and with the revelation of Euros being Sherlock's sister,  I couldn't not trying to fit her in somehow, so I had the idea to make her Sherlock's twin whom died into the womb.  And now my brain can leave me alone.  :D
“No, no, no, I can’t, put me down, another contraction is starting,” Sherlock finally shouts, angry and exhausted.
"I have my ways."
"Whatever it was, I did not care about such meaningless statements about life still going on, and never understood why an oak tree would remind me of my dead dog."
"Oh, she's on the move again," he says, and the bump pushes against his navel.  It is followed by a series of waves, then it stops, as abruptly as it started.
"No, don't worry," Sherlock replies quickly, and John realises he has switched on full-panic mode instantly.  "It is nothing of the sort."
"Oh, there will be songs written about us, you daft git."
"It's because it is quite full," Sherlock explains. John notices he doesn’t talk down to her, but uses simpler words than usual.
"Shut up shut up shut up, keep your strength," Sherlock says frantically, and his face disappears for a moment.
"Hey, I...let's forget it, ok?" He pleads, taking Sherlock's hand.  "Forcing you to remember painful stuff is the last thing I want.  The hell with the money, pay for the baby stuff however you want to pay, alright?"
Sherlock looks at John, a quick glance that is unsure, shy.
"Did you plant the tree after he was buried?"
John bites his lips.  He doesn't want to say it out loud, it would feel like betraying Sherlock.  "Well... it's different, he is pregnant, and we..."
"I wouldn't worry about that, Sherlock.  Soon enough you'll be in the middle of uncovering an international spy network.  Or something similar."
Sherlock frowns, opens his mouth as if to protest, but loses the fight.  His breathing is already deepening.
Sherlock complies, deciding to sulk instead.  The worst thing in this situation is that John isn't certain the class will be as great as he tries to... well, yes, sell it. The program is composed of two-hours classes addressing an array of subjects. Future parents can choose to pick only the classes they are interested in, or to follow the full course. The classes are discussion-oriented, leaving space for the participants to express themselves and share their experience. Tonight's subject is about the management of pain during childbirth.  John's hope is that Sherlock will feel comforted, hearing the other participants speak of their fears, their doubts and uncertainties, all on different level, of course, but at its core, what Sherlock is going through emotionally is quite universal.
He punctuates each word by shoving the doll's head in John's chest, holding it by a leg.  John sees red, and grabs the head before he gets another shove.
“Oh, please, don’t tell me you hadn’t deduced that I was a bisexual.”
"I am sorry," John murmurs, his voice half-broken.  "We took a decision not to have children, and it is our decision.  It's our problem to deal with, alright?  And I swear to you Sherlock, I swear I'll be with you every step of the way and make things as easy as possible for you.  We'll get through this."
...well, lettuce.  Except of course, Sherlock isn't having a fit over lettuce.  Sherlock is upset because he's thirty-six weeks pregnant.  He's clumsy, has trouble sleeping, needs to visit the bathroom every couple of hours andhas a very difficult relationship with his digestive system.   Then there is the shortness of breath, and his brand new clothes already showing some strain over his ever-changing body.  John honestly thinks that if he were in Sherlock's place, he would spend his days crying in a foetal position.  So no, seeing Sherlock losing it over a vegetable isn't a reason formockery.  If you ask John, Sherlock deserves a bloody medal for not throwing fits all the time.
"Accountant."
- but it's a feat in itself to have Sherlock announcing his impending orgasm by saying something else than... well... his orgasm being impending.
John manages to catch the straw with his tongue.  Sherlock doesn't really help.
"Yes.  It is."
He can't; his throat is shut tight, his body so heavy it's almost impossible to move.
"John," Sherlock cries.  A warning.
Sherlock stares at him for two long seconds before nodding silently, as if he's just decided something.
John doesn't get the chance to answer, because at the same moment, Sherlock calls his name.  The way he says it has John's heart freezing in his chest.  Sherlock is scared, and hurt.
"I told you to drop it.  I know you like it, I noticed the second you  threw yourself at it.  You always make the same tiny noise when you get comfortable, from the back of your throat. It's not a sigh, or a groan, some kind of cross between the two."
John can’t help but smile at that.  “Because I wanted to do it ever since I saw you for the first time.”
"Yes.  I can admit now drugs were taking over.  I've always described myself as a user, not an addict, but it is such utter tosh.  I was definitely not in control anymore.  I would take a hit to get the control back, but it was worse.  Nothing worked anymore, being sober or high, the control was gone.  I huh... harmed myself, and others, I was at a point where I was obviously trying to end my life without admitting to myself I was suicidal."
John slides his phone into his pocket.  "None of your business."
e.  I... I know it is stupid, but I feel better when you speak.”
John obeys, and is sensitive enough not to mention it when, less than an hour later, Sherlock eats a whole plate of cinnamon swirls with his tea.  Oh, the upcoming weeks will be all kind of interesting, John thinks.  Sherlock is very careful about his physical appearance.   He states that it is all a question of perception: wearing tailored clothes influences people, who have a tendency to take him more seriously; having his hair done and always being clean shaven speaks of someone who is professional in every sphere of his life. So, yes, Sherlock has the perfect, flawless answer to explain an apparent vanity.  Everything for the sake of the Work.
"How do you...?"
"You're sure you're good to go?"
"I have no idea what you are talking about," Sherlock tries weakly, making huge, innocent round eyes.
A little side note : I have not yet seen the first episode of Sherlock season 4 and I don't know when I'll be able to watch it, which of course I'd prefer to be spoiler-free.  Also, and the last sentence of this note is a spoiler in itself, although it has appeared in all the pictures, clips and promo for season four.  So, it's a warning, what I am about to say contain a spoiler, if some of you want to skip it.
"Mycroft."
Sherlock takes a long, shuddering breath.  "You were right, I was being an arsehole.  You are not an idiot, John."
"Hum... Puppeteer isn't the correct term for Moriarty.  He was a predator.  Yes.  A spider tending a gigantic web and playing with the flies caught in it at his convenience.  He did not lead a luxurious life, wasn't looking for power, or fame.   The only desire Moriarty had was to spread chaos, death and misery.  Once the puppet show was over, all he had to do was to retreat in the darkness while other people paid for the crimes he was consulted for.  There would always be another representation, Moriarty made sure of it.  Why? Moriarty did all this because he liked it.  He was a psychopath with a genius mind, and boredom was slowly but surely killing him. Doing what he did not only made his brain work to its full potential but helped alleviate the apathy that was plaguing him.  Long story short, he did it for the simple pleasure of it.  Oh, Donovan, I see how eager you are to point out how much alike  Moriarty and I are.  Please let me help you with that.  As I'm referring myself to the only consultant detective in the world, he was the perfect antagonist, being the only consultant criminal in the world -well, as far as we know anyway, right?  He was a psychopath, and I a sociopath, and although the terms are meant to have different meaning, they are constantly muddled up, even amongst specialists, because of the very subtle differences between the two.  Moriarty's genius was the only reason he became interested in me in the first place, because he felt we were the same.  It is true that carrying the burden of a superior mind can isolate oneself when amongst ordinary people, and...  Where are you going?  It is quite rude to leave in the middle of discussion."
Other hiding place have electricity and wifi.  They are located in the heart of the city.  Hiding in plain sight.
."Ok.  Enough.  You aren't going anywhere."
"Six pounds," he says, picking up his coat.
Enjoy the chapter!
Little Star
"Oh, for fuck's sake," Sherlock says, and he's angry.  The pink-dressed nurse that is currently trying to put the damn mask back on John's face is yanked -not too gently- away and...
"Wait," Sherlock hisses, his face contorting in pain.
There is, like always before he comes, a divine second where Sherlock's body arches and he sobs a series of agonizing moans. John uses it to push his shaft as much as he can, just in time to have Sherlock's muscles clamp up.  He's coming, then, trapping John's cock in a series of strong contractions that wring his orgasm out of him, punching the breath out of his lungs.  John's body reacts so strongly it hurts, all of his muscles tightening, and his nerves on fire.  He has to concentrate to get his breathing back to normal and he is still a little dizzy when he opens his eyes, feeling endorphins starting their miraculous work.
"Yes," Amy admits, blushing lightly.
"What?  No, you're not.  I feel the same as you, Sherlock.  And it's okay to be a little overwhelmed.  You do not have to be ashamed of feelings things, you know."
It's nine in the morning and they have nowhere to be.  John relaxes.  He'll gladly nap with Sherlock for a while.
“Maybe...  John.  Another one, it’s only be a minute, what is happening...”
As soon as he starts pushing, the baby’s head becomes visible.  “Come on, keep going,” John instructs, once more circling the entry of the birth canal with an index, until he needs to stop because the head is breaching.  Sherlock is moaning, trembling, but keeps it up, and finally, finally... The head is coming out.  “A bit more, Sherlock, love, she’s almost here,” he says, preparing his gloved hand to grab the small head.
"Well, yes.  The morning sickness... it's been hard on him."
His legs are shaking.  John isn’t certain they would hold him up, if he wasn’t there to support him.
John realises he hasn't paid attention to him since he took control.  He grabs his hand and presses it.
It's fine.  It's
"Why the hell not?  Surely you will be able to prove you have changed."
“What?  Wh-“
It's a miserable sight, Sherlock wincing against the pain, wearing only a pair of boxer briefs and still sweating all over despite the four fans.  He expresses the wish to sleep it off, but Sherlock's sleep hasn't miraculously improved to the point he can nap on command, and he doesn't manage to have more than a vague tiring sensation.
"Listen to me," Sherlock goes on, his eyes fond and his tone sweet, so full of affection.  "These idiots won't leave us alone if they aren't satisfied with your physical and mental state.  Let them settle you into your room, then it will be my pleasure to kick them out."
"Sherlock?  Is something the matter?"
There is a loud pop as Sherlock falls backward, landing on his chair.
"What are you saying, then?"
"I have to say", she finally admits when John sits on her opposite, close to Sherlock, "that Jimmy is right about one thing.  There is a protocol to follow, doctor Watson, and I cannot afford to lose my job."
Or it's alternate version:
"Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whatever.  But I meant what I said.  I had no good reason to be upset.  You don't have to indulge me, you really can go back to your case."
John smiles and keeps caressing Sherlock's hair, observing him to ensure he isn't caught in another nightmare.  Sherlock is frowning, but ever so slightly, like he does when he is impatient, or maybe exasperated.  John would kiss him if he wasn't feeling like a slug.
Ten minutes later, John helps him into the bathtub filled to the brim, to which he added a generous quantity of the posh bath oil Sherlock likes so much.
Sitting down in the bath is a real challengewhen you've reached your third trimester and have a belly that's pointing forward like a vertical American football.  Sherlock is panting by the time he's done.As he’s used todoing by now, John kneels besides him to wash his back, then helps him lay back on the inflatable cushion
"What is it about dying and suffering that has changed?" John asks, eager to keep him talking.  It surely does him some good to get it out, and it might hold back a crying fit that could easily shift into a panic attack.
am having a baby," Sherlock says harshly. “Unless you want to climb here with me and have a probe shoved so far up your arse you feel like vomiting.”
Without waiting for the answer, Sherlock turns his back to Lestrade and walks up to the corridor at the end of the room.  When John asks anxiously if he needs help, he shakes his head.
Sorry again
And oh, let's not forget his snorting laughter that comes out like a squeak when he's watching telly, and the blush that crawls up his cheeks, then, although he's too proud to acknowledge the noise and decidedly ignores John's amused gaze.
As it turns out, things don't reach the point of no return.  On the tenth day of Sherlock's convalescence, he has a nightmare.
He must have been standing for at least ten minutes.  Sherlock is on his side, one arm draped across his belly, defining its shape.  The couch’s blanket is discarded on the floor, and a thin layer of sweat covers Sherlock’s pink face, making the fine hair at his temple frizz.  He has a long dark curl with golden highlights covering his left eye, and the rest of his hair is framing his face like a halo. It’s becoming too long, but not enough for a haircut that would facilitate their maintenance.  John is completely enamoured by the mess of curls that Sherlock keeps cursing about.
There are footsteps then, and a conversation. John cannot hear what both voices are saying, it's like he's underwater, and then, another familiar face appears to him, but not for long.  Lestrade.
"John.  Entertain me."
Sherlock doesn't say a word during the ride back home.  John doesn't press.  He might know what has been going on and needs to think about the best way to bring it up.
“John,” Mycroft calls from the doorway.
John snorts.  "We are... look at us, the Great Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson, fearless crime fighters, and at the end of the day we are newbies at this."
"Yes, you are!  You are.  You try to go on like we didn't have that nasty fight the other day, like it hasn't overwhelmed you to hear the baby's heart, enough for you to have a breakdown right in the middle of the street, and-"
"Well, I was bleeding out, I could hardly-"
"Is it about your closeted homophobia?  Because-"
A discreet throat clearing stops them just as their lips touch.  Sherlock rolls his eyes and looks at Mycroft, waiting politely while leaning on his umbrella.
A shower.  Showers since they first got together have changed. John remembers the first time he just jumped in while Sherlock was washing his hair with his expensive, peppermint-scented shampoo.  He remembers the unmanly squeak, the self-consciousness, and how it ended up with him leaning against the tile walls while Sherlock had given him his first blow job.
Ok. They'll never get through the list today if Sherlock explains the necessity of each item on it.
"It feels like coming down from a high," Sherlock had admitted once, and John had promised himself he would always help him make the transition as smoothly as possible.  There is still so much he doesn't know about Sherlock's life before they moved in together.  John knows Sherlock has personal demons that still torment him,   everyone does - things he can't talk about, things maybe John will never hear him speak of, but he respects that.  He knows too well how it is, trying to keep your past at bay.
John takes a deep breath.  His face is covered in sweat.  When did that happen?
John's nervousness is quick to replace his amazement, though.  He doesn't feel a bit content about the state of the flat, because it means their fight really has gotten to Sherlock.
It lasts four days.  John knows Sherlock is well aware of what he is doing, and tries his best to play along.  Still, it shows, as the days go by, how his forced immobility is getting to him.  His smile wears off, he gets lost in his head for long periods, eats without his newfound enthusiasm, sleeps less soundly.  It does not help that his back is constantly sore from lying down the best part of twenty-four hours. Also, his pregnancy is advanced enough that he begins to suffer from a number of uncomfortable symptoms, like gastric reflux and leg cramps, amongst other things.
“I’m not going to ask how. I supposed you have known for a while?”
"I know that, which is why I have no choice.  I need to be the one making the decision to stop, because you won't let me do it on my own, and I cannot stand the thought of losing you."
"I know, but as Mycroft always told me, caring is not an advantage.  Not for me.”
"Yes," Sherlock admits bluntly.  "Nevertheless, if you think we should wait until tomorrow, I will follow your lead."
He's going to cry.
“Hey you.  How are you holding up?”
"I will judge myself," Sherlock cuts him off harshly.  "We need to do what is best for our daughter; there is no other option for me."
"The pain you feel, it's because you haven't ejaculated in a while," John explains.  "That is the only reason I was asking.  Normally, it is not a problem, but with the swelling already present and the pressure of the baby on your internal organs, it's another matter entirely."
"Really?  I mean, good.  I was thinking the same thing."
“I... I’ve been with men before, but this... It’s
"Yes, love, do it, come for me," John coaxes, lowering his hands to solidify his grip on Sherlock's arse.
“Oh, did I say that out loud?”
Without answering, John gets Sherlock to follow him to the car, opens the door and helps him sit.  “What is the worst that could happen, Sherlock?”
Whether it is because of the nature of the case or Sherlock's state, what does it matter in the end?  John will have to resort to the role of shock-absorbing cushion.
"John, will you call a cab, we are done here," Sherlock turns toward him, and John, who is still confused by how fishy this whole conversation has been, jumps in surprise.
John is brought back to the present by Sherlock frowning at his brother, who’s presenting him with a plate of little pies.  Sherlock’s favourite.  Especially out season.
“I am still scared, of course, but it is neutralised by my discomfort.  It is more than that, though.”
Surely, John will learn soon enough what he's been thinking about.
, he thinks sometimes,
“The shoulders are out, stop now, you’re going to hurt yourself.”
"Gonna come," Sherlock declares, and the time when he couldn't use that kind of vocabulary seems long ago.
"Especially the cute stuff."
Sherlock presses both indexfingers against his temples.  He is shaking.
"Your stamina is impressive," John declares, following Sherlock to the bedroom.
Sherlock turns his head so he does not have to look at John directly.  He shoves both of his hands in his coat pockets, as if he needs to take a step back even while being pressed against John's side.
"Never gives you an instant of respite, that brilliant mind of yours," John says quietly, trying to imagine how it must feel.  When he has a busy shift at the surgery, he feels so damn tired coming back home, mentally tired, as if he's given his brain too many things to work on.  That mental tiredness times a hundred, or even a thousand, is it close to what Sherlock experiences on a daily basis?"
It hurts.  John knows Sherlock is upset enough to let the monster out, to be that mean, intolerable jerk staring at everyone like he's a damn god.  The monster who actually enjoys being called a freak, who laughs when he makes someone cry.  Of course, John knows.  He knows too well why Sherlock built this façade in the first place, how many times he was hurt, before deciding to be the one hurting others, flipping the table, becoming unattainable, a man made of ice with all hell's fires burning him inside.
He closes the door behind him, fighting a gush of wind, and then hangs his damp vest in the lobby’s closet. “Can’t say I blame them.”
"John... I... can't..." he breaks off the rhythm, keeping his eyes closed and shoving his head once more in the crook of John's neck.  His breath hitches several times, as if he's about to cry, and maybe he is.  His cock is rock hard. He must be so close to coming, and it seems to John as if he doesn't know how to just let it happen. Maybe he needs a little more stimulation, and encouragement.
"It suddenly came to me, John. It's not unusual to find traces of phosphorus in hair or on the skin.  When Molly and I analyzed the samples in search of poison, we neglected it because it isn't a lethal chemical.  But it occurred to me that it was everywhere, in quantities that could be questioned.   Thanks to my grandmother's passion for gardening, I remembered that phosphorus it is one of the main ingredients of most water-soluble plant fertilizer.  Now the gardening store has a small greenhouse within its walls.  Fertilizer is often distributed using some kind of spray system, similar to those you find in grocery stores to keep the vegetables fresh.  If our victim still had phosphorus in her hair more than six months after her death, even though it is quite volatile, she must have been exposed to it on a regular basis. So, not a customer, but a probable employee of Le Pouce Vert.  Tomorrow morning, we are meeting Lestrade at the Yard.  And I know the first place we're going to visit."
John doesn’t know how long they stay that way, but his back starts to feel strained, and his knees are shaking. With regret, he pushes himself up and takes a step back.  Sherlock lifts his head to look at him.  He seems calmer.
"I am not.  Stop harassing me."
"If you think you can feel anything different let me remind you the embryo is currently the size of a sesame seed," he states matter-of-factly.
"I... wonder... huh... John I am close..." Sherlock pants, closing his eyes and lowering his chin on his chest.
"We cannot...not after what happened.  What if this triggers new contractions? "
Oh!  John slides to the side of the bed and stands up, a bit wobbly on his feet.  He gives Sherlock a quick once over.  He’s wearing the clothes he had on yesterday evening, which means he must have slept through the night on the chaise-longue, or else he would have changed into his pyjamas.  He doesn’t appear to be in pain, holds himself straight, and his pallor hasn’t worsened.  He looks more scared than in pain.
Sherlock does.  He has wide, innocent eyes, this look he reserves for when he lays himself bare, figuratively, for John.  He cannot help but kiss his chapped lips.  It makes Sherlock shiver.
"That means we're doing it?" Sherlock mumbles into John's coat collar.
Without waiting for help, Sherlock manages to kneel on the sofa, with his arms crossed over the tall armrest.  John makes sure the sheet follows –if keeping his dignity is important to Sherlock, it is important to John too, let it be futile or not.  Sherlock is moaning softly, pressing his head hard into his shaking arms. John, knowing he does not want to be touched or spoken to, tries not to feel too helpless. It was so much easier in the beginning, when Sherlock was reaching for his touch and comfort.  Nevertheless, John needs to respect what Sherlock wants. At least, he’s allowing himself to voice his pain, not completely, John can tell just by hearing him breathe, but it’s a start.
"I can’t promise."
Sherlock scoffs, but he slowly retreats to his corner of the room.  “Your snoring is worsened by the drugs, and given that it’s already terrible, I doubt I will have the opportunity of falling asleep.”
“Right,” Sherlock agrees, eyes closed, nostrils dilated.  “There,” he exhales, his body starting to relax.  “It’s almost... almost over.”
"Is he gone into that castle of his?"
The tea is a little bitter, but John still enjoys it for what it is.  It is so rare Sherlock does this kind of thing for him -and it isn't a problem, it just makes those moment special.
The only thing contrasting with it is the fact that Sherlock wears scrubs and that he looks exhausted, his eyes swollen and reduced to slits, a long scratch on his cheek, his curls a mess of strands standing in every direction.  God, he looks. So…
"Yes."
Sherlock grins, grounding his hips so that his bottom rubs against John's quickly growing erection.
"That was the exact moment I knew I was fucked.  I was already addicted to you."
"I should have done it sooner," Mycroft says.  "I was... afraid, Sherlock.  You can blame me, I deserve it.  The only justification I have is that it was so hard back then.  Do you remember it all?  I am not sure.  You weren't lucid most of the time.  I was afraid you would put me, and our parents, through that hell again.  It wasn't easy getting the clearance bypassing the official channels.  I mean, when you threaten to blow up the British government, you tend to remain on their radars.  John is the one you should be thanking. He has a way of presenting things that makes it hard to argue. I am a coward, as you so often say, Sherlock.  It was as much out of fear than out of laziness I did not act sooner."
" Merry Christmas, Mrs. Holmes."
Normally, Sherlock and John wouldn’t even have changed their routine.  Mycroft wouldn’t have made the effort to announce the news himself –a text would have sufficed.  But this isn’t normal circumstances, and Sherlock had been quick to understand he couldn’t take any amount of risk.  He just couldn’t.  Even though the chances of Blair reaching them before he was caught were quite low –around twenty percent, according to Mycroft- there was no way Sherlock could defend himself, not while so heavily pregnant.  Not only couldn’t he fight: he couldn’t even get away quickly enough.  Mycroft had suggested the cottage in Sussex as the safest place for them.  Baker Street, for all its familiarity, is right in the centre of London, with a lot of movement, a lot of unfamiliar faces passing by each day; and with Sherlock unable to reach his homeless network or perform his routine checks (comprised of several techniques he keeps secret even from John), Blair could have gotten to them.  It wasn’t like Sherlock’s address was a secret, after all, which is the exact opposite of their cottage near Storrington, a location John hadn’t even disclosed in their blog.  The other advantage was the physical location of the cottage, on the point of a hill with the ocean at its back, there was only one way to the cottage, and the view from it was clear and extended.  Besides, with a village as small as Storrington, an unfamiliar face would immediately stick out.
His name is called, his chest is rubbed, one of his fingernails is pricked with a needle.  He knows.  They want him to react, they need to evaluate his awaken state.  John would very much like to answer, but he can't.  Somewhere between his brain ordering and his body responding, the communication is cut.  He knows he makes noises and blinks, it's the best he can do.
"Yes, it is," Sherlock agrees with the same soft voice.  "But by then they were... say... at loss of what to do with me.  A judge once told me he was scared of what I could do with... What did he say?  That sick, incredible mind I had been gifted with, when I would lose control for good."
Then, last night, John had gone to fetch the milk in the fridge and found himself face to face with a rotting human hand with large lesions from which were growing what seemed to be shoots of parsley or basil. It was a nightmarish version of that kid's toy, where grass grows like hair on head-shaped clump of soil.
Sherlock isn’t as oblivious as he seems to be, though.  As soon as they arrive at the flat, he suggests he goes to meet his brother alone –
"I'll keep you informed on my progress."
At first, John has no idea what it is about, because Sherlock is facing him, head bent forward.  Then, as he turns to drop his Belstaff on the closest piece of furniture, it appears that he got a haircut.  Of  course, Sherlock gets his hair cut on a regular basis - he has very precise standards when it comes to the length and the layers are cut in a way that is aesthetically pleasing and easier to arrange.  John has never made a secret of how much he likes Sherlock's ebony curls, the longer the better. He’s always secretly pleased when the regular, once every two months’ appointment gets postponed and he can enjoy those untameable, long locks.
He takes a step forward and puts his hand on Sherlock's shoulder, surprised to find it so tensed.  "Come on, now, you know that is not what I think. Hey, look at me, alright?"
"Oh, I could put the missing pieces together; asking without really asking. Angie only partially understands the concept of death.  She thought, since Alexandra was spending so much time taking care of her infant, she would be lonely without her.  Hence the doll.  The rocking chair was a bit farfetched, in the line of thinking Angie is capable of, so she must have seen it in the building, maybe on the side of the street, or in another room.  What was still a mystery was the Sussex Vampire.  Why would she have the idea of writing such a thing on the wall?"
John stretches his hand, fingers splayed, in front of Sherlock.  He smirks.  "Yes, but my hands are much more agile."
"Are you going somewhere?"
"What is it?"
"What?"
you to be happy."
"St Bart's. Molly texted me yesterday to ask for my help.  Something about a chemical component she cannot identify."
"Hurt?  Like what?  Where does it hurt?"
"... Coffee and then he looked at me in a very strange, very un-Lestrade way and took a sip himself.  He's heard me, I can tell, although he is clearly out of his depth trying to figure out how to react to the situation.  Which, well, besides congratulate me, what else could he possibly say or do?  And now, all of New Scotland Yard will know.  I am mad at myself, John, to feel so incredibly uncomfortable with the knowledge.  How am I responsible for Lestrade's awkwardness?  Surely there is nothing especially extraordinary in being with child - care for some water?"
"John," Sherlock whines, and his hands are not immobile anymore but running all over his own body in an erratic way, while his head shifts from left to right, his face red and sweating.  He doesn't know what to do with himself anymore, and god, does John loves him like this, would have him laid down like an offering all the time, waiting for him.
“I know.  You have been very good for my brother, John.  Do not think my parents and I aren’t grateful for your presence in his life.”
"Boring," he tells John.  "All that's left is a quite high number of small time crooks that have no idea who their allies and enemies are.  With Moriarty dead, they're going to be at each other's throats in no time.  If Lestrade's team is smart enough -which I highly doubt, but let's say they are- they can practically sit back and watch.  I've given them enough elements to go on and have no inclination to play the babysitter for a bunch of aspiring James Bonds.  And now, now please can we drop the subject.  I have a potential new case at hands and I need to rearrange my hard-drive."
“Of course.  No problem.  Don’t think about it now just concentrate on breathing.”
"Must have been created by one of the educators, because I've never heard of it."
Mycroft smiles, almost sincerely.  “He doesn’t.  He should have deduced it by now.  Sentiment.  My genius of a brother has been rendered stupid by love.”
Sherlock stares at him, his eyes a little too bright.  "John. You are always so kind to me, why do you let me get away with so many things? You asked a valid question. You deserve an answer."
"And what's our situation?"
pregnant for the ninth month."
“I know.”
If John were the narrator of his own life story, just like he is of Sherlock’s (part of his life, at least - there is so much more to tell than the work he does), now would be the time where he would stop the narrative to allow the reader to breathe.  It’s a very common strategy writers use: to begin a story right in the middle of the action, hoping to get the readers hooked as soon as possible.  Then, when the narrative allows it, the author takes a step back, exposes his characters, some of their back story, the meaning to their previous actions and the direction they’re heading toward.  It’s called exposition.  John, who does not, for a second, consider himself as a
Feeling a bit like an arse, John stretches his hand and lets it rest on Sherlock's belly, making him tense briefly in surprise as he comes back from inside his head - with regrets, if his expression is any indication.
Despite his exhaustion, John lift his hand to grab Sherlock's wrist and steady him, looking straight into his eyes while he drinks, trying to convey as much calm and comfort as possible without saying a word.  Sherlock bites his already bruised lower lip where the deep trace of his teeth tells of distressed waiting hours.  John wishes he could be steady enough for the both of them, but he's barely able to fight off sleep.
This startles John. His anger deflates quickly and he realises something.
Then, for the second time of the day, he acts completely out of character by kicking the already immobilized criminal in the ribs, almost hitting John in the process.
, John's lizard brain screams.
At some point, Sherlock let go of John's hand, and John is content to just observe all the emotions passing into Sherlock's eyes while he takes into account the transformation of the room.  He's happy, he's surprised, and deeply touched.
John thinks.
John nods.  Sort of.  His eyes close.  It feels good, to finally be able to welcome the oblivion of sleep.
"I am not on drugs!" Sherlock's voice is raising a notch, and he’s got that dangerous look in his eyes.
"Really?" Sherlock whispers when John has joined him.
"Obviously, the first option," Sherlock murmurs, frowning at John as if he's wondering who the hell he is.
"Can you help me with the glass of water?"
He's not drowsy, and hungover enough to have slept long.  Why is he awake anyway? He had the feeling someone had been calling for him.
"By the way, cleaning the flat was absolutely tedious, and I intend to never do it again.”
"Oh, go on, suggest away," John says, trying to control the hysterical laughter bubbling in his throat.  "Meanwhile, I'm going to have a nice heart attack because I just bloody jumped on the baby train.  I was so focused on the pregnancy I never stop to think, really think, we would go from two to three come June.  Jesus, Sherlock, we are having a baby."
"You okay?  Too intense?"
"I'm here John."
Of course.  Mycroft could probably get the Prime Minister on board if he thought it useful.
ly," Sherlock murmurs, right on point, as always.  If he knew, though, that his lisp comes back when he talks while sleeping, John has no doubt he would find a way to discipline himself even when unconscious.
Sherlock keeps his eyes shut tight.
"Are we keeping up with the plan?"
“I did.”
"You think?" John hands Sherlock a tissue, and he stares at it, clueless. "For your nose."
I think people can be incredibly generous and kind.  When I was part of the SPN fandom, if one of our own was going through a difficult situation, it wasn't long before someone would organize a fanfic auction or some other event, or pass the word to gather some money to help.
"Sharing, mostly.  It's always you and me against the world, you know, and we've treated the pregnancy so clinically.  I mean, even when we went shopping... we had our list and we were all about efficiency and... I mean, you picked all the newborns pyjamas while I was checking the list, and they are folded in the baby's room, ready to be used and I can't even name the colour of a single one."
"And... it is good, right?"
"So we wait?" Mycroft asks after a five second long staring contest.
“You need to relax, or it’ll hurt even more.”
"And you're telling me that your brain has only just now caught up with your body?  At seven months?"
They are not supposed to be the ones running after suspects anymore.  Sherlock had agreed to stay away from everything physically demanding or dangerous, and leave it to the Yard.  Lestrade is more and more suspicious of something going on but, even now as he is twenty-two weeks pregnant, Sherlock still refuses to speak of his predicament, mostly because he fears Lestrade won't ask for his help anymore afterward.
"I'll see what I can do," Mycroft adds, lowering his eyes.  "About the guardianship."
Mycroft had thought it would be good to bring them the news in person; more accurately, he had been commanded by their worried parents, who needed him to report back on how Sherlock really was.The reason they haven’t left yet is because of the weather wreaking havoc outside.  In the afternoon, the cold rain had turned to hail, accompanied by thunder and lightning strikes - some hailstones were as big as grapes.  John had been worried Sherlock would insist they leave immediately, especially since he had heard on the radio the motorway they needed to use to get back was a complete disaster because of water accumulation, and that the rush hour would be very difficult.
“...couldn’t be certain it would work.  I had to take certain facts into consideration, because if a basic physic equation could…”
"I am glad you came to understand him so well, John.  I really am."
John takes said hand and kisses it lightly.
Sherlock shrugs.  "It doesn't feel like a stomach flu."
"Stop the car!"
John tries.
"We wait," John agrees.
"Emotions are frustrating but they feel so damn good, wouldn't you say?" John makes his point and lies back on his side, closer to Sherlock, letting his hand land on his stomach where he rubs small circle with his thumb.
“Nothing is wrong, Sherlock.  Your cervix is softening nicely, and you are six centimetres dilated.”
"Oh Jesus, really?" He sighs.
Yes, it is. More than.
In the ACD novels and short stories, Sherlock Holmes never mention his parents, but once speaks of his grandmother, from which Mycroft and him have inherited the intelligence.   He says she is part of an old french family.  Her name isn't said anywhere, though.
Hurts.
"She is getting ready," John says, his hands remaining splayed on Sherlock's belly.  "Another few weeks and we'll have her with us.  Can you imagine?"
“Of course, he will also be impossible to live with –but that’s my problem.  Our daughter will adore him.”
"No need."
"I... I have relied on you to keep me safe," Sherlock says, lowering his eyes.  "Before.  I have been reckless."
"About four years ago I acquired a property in Sussex."
The Beeks family story doesn’t have a happy ending, but given the circumstances, and thanks to Sherlock, the outcome is the best anyone could have hoped for.
John kisses his forehead and lets go of him.
Sherlock sniffs nervously and turns his head away from John, but he already saw the tears swelling in his eyes.  He waits for Sherlock to continue.  This feels like they are both walking on a tight rope and the smallest gust of wind could unbalance them.  Instead of stating some empty reassurance, he takes a step closer, so that their legs and hips are brushing.  His heart is breaking, hearing Sherlock admit to things he had suspected for a long time.
It affects John more than he thought.  Luckily, he doesn't have the Afghanistan nightmare again, let it be altered or not.  He is, though, plagued by the strangest dreams.  Following baby cries into the darkness.  Finding himself looking for Sherlock who's disappeared, leaving a child behind.  Receiving a pregnant patient and having to deliver the baby on the floor of his office...
," John types without asking Sherlock.
"Mrs. Holmes," John feels the need to intervene.  "I can assure you, you have the wrong idea."
"You have what you want?" Sherlock asks over his music, and John jumps, gasping in surprise.
Another day passes.  Which is enough for John to have his own little meltdown right in front of Mycroft, who's had the sensitivity to stop at the flat in person to inform him of his progress, or in that case, absence of.  It's four in the afternoon.   And John is drunk.
John sees the consternation falling on Sherlock's face the second he notices the new settings of the large class room.  He prepares himself for a death glare that doesn't come.  Sherlock simply walks away, head held high, choosing the table at the back, like a rebellious teenager in a school class.
The haircut issue is at the end of these notes, but first:
He doesn't waste any time, jogging to the front door that's fallen on the side, using the light of his mobile to avoid doing something stupid like breaking a leg because he can't see where he is going.
Bloody Sherlock and his sense of drama.  John comes close to hitting one of his precious "ears around the city" who keeps silent and smiling two inches away from his face, if only to relieve some stress. He doesn't.  He figures it would be awkward, when he tries to reconcile with his lover, to admit he has lost a spy because of John's temper.
Sherlock snorts.  He takes a deep breath, lifts his head and closes his eyes.  He seems peaceful.  "Here's how it went.  After a judge ordered it, I was evaluated by a team of psychiatrists," he says very softly.  "There were different solutions brought forward, and trust me, becoming a pupil was by far the lesser evil.  In those cases, if a family member volunteer to take the responsibility, you escape the sinister perspective of being ward of the state, in which case a designed stranger practically take control over your life."

I want to wish happy hollidays to all of you who celebrate Christmas, and well... for the others, virtual hugs coming your way, just because.
He's walking back and forth on the pavement when John joins him.  His hands are shoved in his pocket, he's mumbling to himself.
"No, you wally, shut up," John can't help but smile at the way Sherlock needs their conversation to be a battle of wits sometimes, especially when he feels himself exposed, vulnerable.  John knows better than to give him satisfaction.  "What I mean is, from the get go, I knew we would do things the way we wanted.  Because you don't care about convention and taboos and social norms.  And it's not because you've never done this before, it's because you don't understand why people burden themselves with it."
John, as always, waits for Sherlock to fall asleep before himself.  Sherlock's sleep patterns are unpredictable, at best, and it is a normal occurrence for John to wake up in the middle of the night alone in bed.  Sometimes Sherlock is working with his microscope, sometimes he is reading, or thinking, so far away into his mind palace it sometimes takes a whole minute for John to get him back.  Other times, though, what's awaken Sherlock are nightmares he won't talk about, and John stays up with him until he has the feeling the worst of the dreams have evaporated and Sherlock is calm enough.
"You alright?"
“I could tell you it’s only normal, but you already know that, right?”
Sherlock turns reluctantly toward him, keeping his arms crossed over his chest.  He is staring at the floor with what seems to be great concentration.
In the end, though, John has to admit it’s a lot more fun than watching alone.
"Almost three hours."
"Does this mean... Have you done it with me?"
Sherlock looks at him sternly.  “Shut the door.  I am cold.”
Sherlock is now bright red.  "I know it doesn't make sense," he mumbles.  "But tell me, John, what am I supposed to do?  You think that when I told you I couldn't do it on my own, I was making an overly dramatic statement after a life-threatening situation? It is a fact.  I cannot raise a child on my own.  I can't.  I would've never even think of having a child if it weren't for you."
John sits himself on the chair, leaning back against Sherlock's coat hanging off it. The unique smell it exudes has John burning with the need to bring his lover back home, or -much better- go back in time to the moment of the fight and act differently.
"Why the hell are you texting my brother!" Sherlock asks, looking outraged.
"John, I am... hard," Sherlock tells him.  "Because of you.  It... never happened before."  A light press of his hips downward has John moaning from the delightful pressure on his cock.
John can be patient.  And determined.
The cool weather does its job, but a stupid argument during the evening meals ruins Sherlock's mood.  Lettuce, of all things, is what makes him angry.  He had planned to eat a salad for supper, because his stomach has been giving him hell and he wants to avoid meat, which tend to make it worse.  Except what was left of the iceberg lettuce had been thrown away that morning, by John -
"Well, the usual.  We should've told him, but Lestrade still thanks us for doing his job, and he needs us at New Scotland Yard tomorrow afternoon.  He has a police car waiting for us."
"Jesus, Sherlock, you're going to drive me mad," John mutters.  He takes a deep breath to remain calm.
"Got it."
John does, with complete clarity.  The betrayal and hurt he saw on Sherlock's face - those few seconds were essential in his understanding of the man.  Not a robot, nor a psychopath, high-functioning or else. A human being, just like him.
"I did that," he says.
Of course, he doesn't wait for John to voice his opinion.  He just starts walking, fast, bumping shoulders with at least two people in his determination to keep on going, straight ahead, in the opposite direction of Baker Street.  John closes his eyes and breathes slowly through his nose.  He never thought it would be easy, right?
"John, what is wrong?"
Sherlock Holmes doesn't get paint in his hair, doesn't spill a single drop.  Of course, John should have known.  Plus, he manages to still look somewhat distinguished while wearing an old university hoodie - mint green, which gives his eyes a mysterious, very sexy glow, accentuating their cat-like shape - and a pair of paternity jeans.  He rolls his eyes when John points out he could ruin them.  "Then I'll buy another pair," he points out as if it is so evident John is an idiot to mention it.  Ah, Sherlock and his complete disdain toward money, which can only be explained by the fact he’s never had to worry about it.  It is frustrating, especially for John, who's family was very modest and where each saved penny counted, but cannot be held against him.  He just doesn't know.
“Ok, alright, come on I got you,” John tells him, careful to use a calm, quiet voice, which he learned on the battlefield.  The calmer you are, the more likely your patient will calm down.  It’s a simple mimic technique.
"What?"
“You won’t have to.  Mycroft will help.  Trust me.”
I am so sorry for the delay.  I've never taken so long to write a story.  I write when I can, and if real life still gives me hell, I am determined to finish this story as it was planned.  Thank you all for your patience.  I never left a story unfinished and I promise this time it won't be different.  It is just more difficult to post on a regular basis.  A gigantic shout-out to my beta reader JJ, she's a saint, I swear, and I would be lost without her.
"Arsehole."
Enjoy!
"No, I don't think he is," John murmurs, his voice breaking over the incredible amount of relief flowing through him.  The alcohol he's been ingesting since noon seems to double its effects, as John's body melts into his chair.
"We should put the crib against this wall, so that it's only hit by light toward the middle of the afternoon."
The answer is distracted.  Sherlock is busy playing with the hem of his t-shirt, when he seems to come to a decision and lifts it until it bunches around his chest, revealing his flat stomach.
"He was very... hum... kind, keeping me up to date.  So.  Well, I'm glad you are ok, and I am glad I finally got to speak to your fiancé."
Using Sherlock's own weapons against him is always so satisfying.  Besides, John is glad to keep his thoughts to himself.  What would he say?
“It’s only a supposition, of course,” Amy had said with a malicious smile, “but something tells me this little one will be a handful.”
Sherlock nods, looking up at him.  "I know my mother told you about him."
"I swear it is!" Angie says, excitement making her spit with each word.
"Don't forget, we have another class next week."
"Nothing is without risk, Sherlock. "
An ambush.  He has ten minutes left to live. In the backseat are two young soldiers, Vicario and Jones.  Jones will die of a simple flesh wound, bleeding slowly to death while John lays unconscious besides him and the rescue team fails to get to them in time, caught in a sudden sand storm.  Vicario will survive, but she'll never walk again.
Sherlock notices him too, and the way he stops dead on his tracks tells John he has guessed correctly.
"What?"
"How long do you plan we stay there?"
"So, do you guys have a name yet?"
"Stop whining.  We're here to learn how to care for a newborn, what did you expect?"
(The only smile Sherlock allows himself is when he notices a small table filled with food, for an eventual break.  John can hear him whisper "Gingernut biscuits" as if he was saying the name of a lover.)
John can play dirty.  He loves to play dirty.
John rubs his very erect penis on the side of Sherlock's pelvis, and is glad to see him smile.
It is a new thing, and it is happening more and more often, moments where Sherlock is overwhelmed by mood swings, and it is clear he hates it.  Seeing him trying to cope is akin to watch an equilibrist on a rope caught in a sudden gush of wind.  As hard as he tries, Sherlock has little control over the hormonal outbursts and emotive peaks he experiences. That lack of control scares him, and being scared angers him, and then he explodes anyway, over a lost pen, or a missing clothing item, or...
"Hey, sorry for behaving like an idiot early."
"I think we've missed a lot."
Accomplishment
"Money, so bo-ring," Sherlock sing-sang, shutting John up.  "Now, sex."
"Good, because you didn't have control over it anyway," John agrees, sliding down the bath until he reaches Sherlock's feet.  "Massage?"
A pause...
Sherlock snorts, lifting his chin.  "Well, at least I'm not to be confused with hundreds of others."
Sherlock, too, is blushing –a vivid cherry red.
“Was not.  You were seven years older than me; what merit is there into tricking a three-year-old child into eating anchovies?”
"Well, Carl Grey is amongst those individuals who love money for the sake of it.  There is never enough."
“Sir!” A police officer yells at him, using the megaphone.  “Please remain at a safe distance.  We can’t assure your safety.”
It fascinates John.  What really gets to him, though, is how adamant Sherlock is to include him, every step of the way.  It is always vaguely frustrating, not being able to experience a pregnancy first hand, and knowing you will never truly understand what it is to have this new life taking root inside you.But as John feels truly and completely included in the experience, he doesn’t suffer much from it.
The Church is not only abandoned, but isolated one mile into a deep wooded area, and it is clear, by the less than smooth driving, that the road isn't maintained anymore.  The pale gibbous moon of a very dark night -it's barely two in the morning- shines over the Church's tower, painting an almost supernatural landscape.
"Do they know how long she's been there?"
"Of course," Sherlock agrees, and he's clueless, John can tell.
John takes Sherlock’s face between his hands.  “Look at it logically.  Right now, it’s no use to think about what could go wrong.  It won’t change anything.  I want you to concentrate on the here and now, block everything else. One contraction at a time.”
It isn't his belly that gets Sherlock the disapproving looks of a dozen bystanders when John catches him yelling at an old lady to move forward in the supermarket.  And he had the nerve to explain his behaviour as having been nervous. Apparently, the baby hiccupping had taken him off guard and kept distracting him.  John had really tried to keep a severe expression, but seeing how, while he scowled at Sherlock, his belly was shaken by regular tremors, he hadn't been able to repress his laughter.
It is easy to call Sherlock a child, given his impulsiveness, lack of manners, ignorance of most social codes and temper tantrums, which are impressive as they are usually due to a seemingly insignificant reason.  If John is persuaded a certain level of emotional immaturity can be held accountable, he knows Sherlock too well to limit his perception to that.  It would be a mistake to forget that he has a genius brain, a brilliant mind capable of accomplishments most people can only dream of.  Therefore, John is always irritated with people who refer to Sherlock as a child, but he isn't above acting accordingly when necessary.  The only difference is that he never allows himself to forget it is only one side of an incredibly complex shape.
The contraction is over.  Sherlock turns his head to look at John.  His eyes are still huge, and more scared than John has ever seen them, except maybe for that time John had been stabbed in the thigh.
"Please shut up," Sherlock cuts him off.  It's more of a plea, really.  He shows without shame how upset he is, his eyes wide and too bright, his lower lip trembling.
He turns his attention toward the writing on the wall, trying to figure out a clue, something, and not worrying about Sherlock too much.  After a few seconds, Lestrade joins him.
John nods, biting his lips.  "I told him he makes it difficult for me to love him," he admits, unable to sustain Mycroft's stare.
"Oh.  John!," Sherlock says, loud and with a disbelieving tone.
"Yes, Darling?"
“Sorry, love.  Sorry.  I don’t have a choice.  Mycroft, keep his legs bent.”
"Yes, don't stop, please, it...  Now, John.  Oh, John-"
“It could.  I don’t believe in romantic love that could last a lifetime. As a matter of fact, I don’t believe in love at all, only chemical reactions.  But I’ve been thinking, weighed the pros and cons, calculated the probabilities and imagined many different scenarios.  And I just cannot see a reality where you and my brother are estranged from each other.”
John nods and clears his throat before it locks, blinking to chase the stinging sensation in his eyes.  Louisa looks away and tries to dry her eyes without John noticing.
"Mycroft?" Sherlock asks, snapping his fingers in front of him.
John burst out laughing.
It changes once he's seated on the stretcher and the young male paramedic tries to wrap a blood pressure cuff around his arm.  Sherlock snaps, retrieving his arm violently.
"The point?  Oh my god, Sherlock, don't make this about me being upset you destroyed my jumper-"
"Yes, it is, but the pain?  Not so much.  Let me have a look."
What is the best time to announce this to Sherlock than when he's already half asleep?  John figures he will eventually remember the following day, but that his reaction will be less... definitive.
"To this point, I think the dental record would be your best chance," John adds, stretching his back.  "Given the advanced state of decay, it is impossible to date her death precisely without further analysis.  It could be anywhere between six months and a year."
When John brings Mycroft his tea, the older Holmes is in the middle of a discourse about the best way to handle the press.  Sherlock's reputation isn't so great that he would be recognized, at least by name, outside of London, but the tabloids have taken an interest in him, especially after the Moriarty case.  There is one paparazzi in particular who has started following him around.  He is the one who took the famous "Heated kiss shared in the back of a cabbie" picture, which made the rounds of the tabloids six months ago.  Sherlock had laughed the incident off, while John had had to manage the micro-scandal on his blog, finally posting an entry confirming their involvement and making clear that he wouldn't discuss it.  He had been surprised by how little Sherlock had cared, until he came to suspect his companion had actually been secretly pleased, which fits in the strange duality of his controlling personality as a detective and his more subdue, submissive one as John's lover.
"I think maybe, at the beginning, you didn't want Sherlock to be free from you. I'm not saying you didn't have good reasons," he objects, when Mycroft opens his mouth.  "I am not an idiot; I know you love your brother.  You were worried, and probably tired of looking out for him despite himself.  At least, when you became his guardian, you were also given legal tools to help you.  And it must have been reassuring.  The thing is, he's changed since then.  He's been doing a lot of good.  I think it might be time you let him go."
"Yeah..." John agrees, unable to resist brushing the curls covering Sherlock's forehead.  "Because we are disgustingly in love."
"Does it have to be human?"
Sherlock makes a non-committal noise.  He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath and begins to sit up.  John grabs his arm to help.  It's become an automatic reflex.  They both land with an "ouf!"
"Almost one year old."
"Sometimes I do project myself into the future, taking into account all the variables possible." Sherlock says, missing the fact that the question is one of those that does not need answers. Lovely.
She stretches a short, chubby hand toward Sherlock's belly.  To John's absolute surprise, he does not move.  If there is one thing Sherlock hates since his pregnancy has started showing is random people asking if they can touch his stomach (most of them being older women for some mysterious reason.)  He has trouble standing being touched by people normally, but now pregnant, his uneasiness has tripled.  He's insulted at least four different women, lecturing them about not going around asking randomly to touch strangers.  One cried, and John had to console her.
John would very much like to accelerate, but it would be unwise considering the weather.
"And I said you should rest, but here I am unable to shut up."
Sherlock is bent over him, a hand laid on his shoulder.  The darkness is misleading, John realises, seeing the pale light illuminating Sherlock’s face.  It’s morning, but a cloudy, rainy one. His watch indicates it’s ten minutes past seven.
"You simply say it is the most logical venue, right?  Getting married.  It is primarily for the baby's situation."
Sherlock's face is fading.  John thinks he hears a scream, but he falls back behind the veil.
It takes Sherlock a few seconds to think it through.  "I cannot say.  I cannot even pin point the moment it happened, but I suppose it comes with the pregnancy and the... uneasiness I feel toward my own body.  You are right.  I am acting like a prude.  It's just..."
"What if I cannot reach completion?" He whispers, closing his eyes.  "Because I do trust you, John, but the fear of hurting her refuses to disappear completely."
"Your brother is here," John tells Sherlock.
"Yeah."
Sherlock shakes his head vigorously, like a child would do.  It’s endearing.  Emotion swells in John’s chest, expanding.  It’s intense, almost painful, like he’ll never be able to fill his lungs again.  He takes Sherlock’s large hands, intertwining his fingers between the other man’s long, pale ones.  Even then, Sherlock’s eyes remain tight shut.
"Sherlock." John props himself on one elbow, his chin in the palm of his hand.  "You just literally admitted that the class got you to think about what you wanted."
"Oh, John," he rasps.  "It has been too long, oh, oh god, I love this s-s-so much, it's... yesss... Your tongue, please, use your tongue..."
"It is not a bad thing, Sherlock."
John nods, smiling to himself at what is, amongst normal people, a simple thing to know: how your close ones take their tea. But for Sherlock, it isn't normal, and it's actually endearing.
“I know. It is just wishful thinking, I guess.  Imagine the story we will tell our daughter about the day she was born.  All those events that lead us here, the tempest of the century trapping us... Every single element that had to be put in place so that I gave birth in that manner, with chaos all around, thunder, wind, hail, snow...  A landslide... “
Automatically, John stretches an arm to feel it for himself, but Sherlock grabs his wrist and gives him a severe look, murmuring between clenched teeth : "Don't you dare, she has just calmed down.  If you wake her up, I swear to god, John... Why are you smiling?"
Sherlock sighs dramatically,  “Ah, you lucky man.”
"Well, thank you, Sherlock."
Sherlock twists on his back so that he can look at John.  "It is still more advantageous in our so-called modern society, to be male, as you surely know.  Women are still the principal victims of crimes, as well as more vulnerable to abuse, every kind of abuse.  So..." Sherlock's cheeks heat up.  "I am... worried," he admits, low voice and embarrassed, shifting eyes.
a big deal.  If John gets too horny, he has a wank in the shower, end of the story.
"I can’t be certain you were actually in early labour, or if you just experienced Braxton-hicks contractions, but the important thing is everything seems to be back to normal."
Sherlock is breathing fast.  His face is pink, his lips red and wet.  John waits.  He has no idea what to do next.
John sits up in shock.  Against his stomach, Sherlock's belly has been crossed by a strong wave, followed by a series of upward pushes, and as he looks, its shape shifts again, as if, for a second, only the right side of Sherlock's stomach is indeed containing the baby.
"Stay calm, Doctor Watson, we're almost there," a female voice says straight into his ear.
"If we do have sex," Sherlock begins.  "And please note it is conditional -
upset!"  Sherlock yells, lifting both arms in the air.
“Was that okay?” John asks, stroking Sherlock’s face with both his thumbs, rubbing little circles on the heated skin.
"You're not selfish, Sherlock," John goes on, more seriously.  "The simple fact that you consider yourself selfish kind of disqualifies you. Selfish people don't know they are. They have a distorted way of thinking that excuses their behaviour."
Sherlock is loud, uncontrollable.  He doesn't just cry, he voices all the emotions that were trapped for too long inside of him; his moans are filled with rage and sorrow ending with wet, violent hiccups.  At first, John is too overwhelmed to speak, so he holds onto him for dear life, rocking him softly like one would do with a child.
John grabs a nipple between his teeth.  Sherlock hisses.  He doesn't push him away, though.  Encouraged, John pinches the other between his index finger and thumb, marvelling at the heat he feels, and how different their texture is now that Sherlock is so advanced in his pregnancy.
"You know it is normal, to have peculiar dreams during a pregnancy," John tells him, rubbing his shoulder affectionately.
About this new chapter : I am so sorry, but it ends on another cliffhanger.  I couldn't work my way around it.  I'll do my best to post the next chapter very soon so you guys won't have to wait for long.
, and also a
"Then we talk," he says in a decisive voice.
Sherlock sighs and rubs his gloved hands together.  "I should have told you beforehand I wasn't sure they would come."
"Oh."
Sherlock shakes his head.
He closes the door, and immediately, John feels calmer. The room is huge for a public hospital one, equipped with a couch and a small kitchenette.  Mycroft's doing, evidently.  It still seems like a room used for long term stay, and John hopes no one is mistaken, because he plans to be out as soon as he can move without reopening his wound.
Sherlock can't answer, though.  He most probably hasn't heard, too busy chasing his orgasm, pressing his cock against John's so hard it's bordering painful, his series of "oh’s" growing louder, harsher.
His eyes are quick to be darkened by doubt, and John answers by kissing him.  A quick, loud smack that resonates in the room.
Turns out, he doesn't have to.
"And I will succumb.  I am now eating my emotions and it's all your fault," he murmurs, a little smile forming on his lips.
"It's her playtime."
"I have changed a lot, John," he admits, looking sideways.
"Oh!" Sherlock cuts him off, sitting up abruptly.  "Poison!  That is unexpected..."
"If there is the smallest hint of danger we'll call Lestrade.  Besides, I do not think Camila Jones, or whatever her real name was, has suffered a violent death.  I am almost certain she hasn't been murdered at all, as a matter of fact."
John clears his throat.  "Yes.  We are."
Sherlock’s voice is as sweet as the morphine.  John doesn’t have the energy to wonder when the hell he did became a mind reader, or how he hadn’t noticed him in the room.  The beeping vital signs monitor he’s connected to slows down before it becomes silent, when the cardiac rhythm returns to normal.  John turns his head just in time to see Sherlock elegantly standing up from the chair he was occupying in a corner of the room, walking through the soft ray of light trailing from the corridor.  It makes his entry theatrical, with him as the lead of a Greek tragedy, silence and dignity personified.  Sometimes John thinks of Sherlock’s life is obeying its own rules, estranged from the rest of mankind, a life where theatrical entrances are possible, as well as dramatic exits, and earth-shattering revelations.
“Alright, go for it,” John instructs.
John isn't duped, but he's also on a mission.  It is still hard not to call Sherlock out on his bullshit when he adds, still smiling.  "Oh, and John.  Remember.  It's never twins."
“Sherlock, John?  Is everything alright?” Comes Mycroft’s voice.
That is what gets John out of his stupefaction.  He grabs Sherlock's elbow and shakes it none too gently, saying his name, then repeating it louder each time when he doesn't react.  It takes five for Sherlock to freeze on the spot and gasp.  His confused eyes open wide and he stares at John, a cry dying on his dry lips.
Louisa Holmes is a clever woman.  She gives John one quick look with her fascinating eyes (those Sherlock inherited, shape and colour) and seems to understand quite a lot, suddenly.
"Let's say we do start a relationship," John murmurs, getting out of his thoughts.  "Wouldn't I be like work for him, something he would become addicted to?"
John himself is drifting off, comfortable and spent, when he feels it, right under his palm.  A kick.  A discreet, soft kick, but it cannot be confused for anything else.  He smiles in the darkness, shoving his nose in the soft hair at the nape of Sherlock's head.  Waits for more.  He doesn't have to be patient because soon enough, he feels a wave going through the skin, and then a soft push.  Daddy's here, he thinks, indulging in the moment completely.  It is the first time John thinks of himself as a father.  So far, he's been so focused on Sherlock and his well-being, he neglected the fact that all of this is happening to him too.  He will be a father.  A weight settles on his heart, heavy with the knowledge of the new responsibility he's been burdened with.  Instead of feeling crushed, John has the wonderful sensation of being grounded, and gifted with the knowledge of a precious secret.
"That is simplifying but true enough," Sherlock answers, just as quietly.  "She's in there - I still have trouble believing it," he adds, looking down his belly where one of his hands is resting firmly.  "I know it is nonsense, I feel her move every day."
"I am not denying that," Sherlock protests, lifting both arms in the air.  "But growing up, I couldn't really get them to understand me, and it was easier to turn to Mycroft.  He is seven years my elder so of course I looked up to him, he "got" me, whereas I would get so frustrated when I tried to, say, explain to my father what a waste of time school was." Sherlock snorts at the memory.  "He thought I was just lazy.  Gosh, it was... Just. So. Boring.  Everything I was taught I already knew... Anyway... Now, things have changed.  See, I have collected data about a child's upbringing, and studies prove that young children sharing healthy relationships with adults other than their parents, especially in the immediate family, but not restricted to it, highly benefit from it.  Their social and intellectual development are way over the average."
"Oh.  She's moved again," Sherlock whispers, surprised.  "It's the fourth time in the past ten minutes."
Sherlock frowns at him, then sits down, very slowly.  "I am perfectly fine, John.  I'm not the one who's been attacked."
next move instead of the other way around.  When Lestrade and John had found him, he was starting to show signs of hypothermia and lack of oxygen.  The doctor part of John's brain had insisted on analysing the situation.  Another hour and they would have found Sherlock's body.
Sherlock turns toward him swiftly, looking fierce and outraged.
"Are you serious?  You will plead in Beeks' favour with Greg, I know that, trying to diminish his responsibility as much as you can.  And you've protected Angela from something that no one would hold her responsible for, and spared her from a traumatic series of police visits, and interrogations.  At least a couple of Scotland Yard's psychologists would want to evaluate her.  They would most probably involve social services and there is no saying if a man who disposed of the body of his wife with his intellectually disabled daughter would get to keep her at all.  And Sophie, too, would probably be taken away from him.  You saved that family, Sherlock."
There is a light sound, a polite throat clearing.  John gets out of his own head and sees Mycroft looking back at him, both eyebrows raised.  He is probably thinking about the tediousness of letting goldfish brains work at their own, deplorable rhythm.
"Well I suppose we all have our opinion."
Lestrade agrees, and finally lets Sherlock go, leaving him still unsure of what just happened, even redder than before, his hair sticking up to a side of his head, unsteady on his legs.
::: :::
.  John refuses to go there.  Sherlock’s change of attitude toward him most certainly has another explanation.  He had worried about John that night at the pool; he had been scared his secret, stupid plan to prove to Moriarty he had won the game would be the cause of John’s death.  He had also discovered that John cared for him. Anyone else would have realised this much sooner, but Sherlock’s lack of understanding about relationships –all kind of relationships- had prevented this realisation.  John cared about him, and he cared about John.  Maybe that’s all there is to it.  Sherlock trying to settle in the knowledge that he does have a friend, a close one that is.  Of course, that would mean that Sherlock never did before, which is upsetting, and sad, but not unrealistic.  His efforts to show John he does appreciate their friendship, if that is actually what is going on, are touching.  Sherlock really does hide himself under his disdain and genius because he doesn’t know how to react in contact with people.  If that’s what he is learning with John, it makes him proud.
John giggles into his stomach, can't help it, and Sherlock squirms.  He's ticklish.  Very.  John has more than once reduced him to a giggling mess, tears in his eyes, his face red, while he still tried to look annoyed.
Sherlock lifts his chin.  "I... might have," he admits, trying to repress a smile. "My god, my dear John, we are getting incredibly domestic."
"You were wondering how much weight I’ve put on.  The answer is six pounds."
"You tend to be a dick when you're upset."
The food is excellent, and the supper is surprisingly relaxed.  Who would have thought?  Mycroft’s conversation can be interesting, when he lets go of his cantankerous responsible big brother persona.  Or maybe it’s the wine, but John finds himself laughing out loud more than once.  Sherlock is quiet but this is nothing new.  He keeps eating, very slowly, small bites he chews several times each, observing Mycroft and John’s conversation with a mix of amusement and exasperation.
"Right before we left.  Oh my god Sherlock, stop crossing your eyes at me, since when have you become a prude?"
Sherlock nods but it takes long seconds before he moves himself off John's lap.  He's still avoiding his eyes.
"You huh... Yes?"
"You can laugh all you want, you weren't even in the dream," Sherlock protests.  "Where the hell were you, you are a bloody doctor!"
"Are you feeling ok?" He asks, looking down his mobile that just blipped.
“Ok,” he murmurs afterward, “ok, it is almost over... god, that one felt... different, and not in a good way.”
Sherlock doesn't protest before having downed half of the bottle.
"She's been dead for months-"
Mycroft allows himself a discreet snort. Sherlock doesn't answer, but John can practically feel his exasperated gaze burning a hole in the back of his head.
He does hear some noises from the living room.  Sherlock's violin.  He isn't playing, but he's about to play: the strange creaks mean he's tuning his strings.
"Sherlock?" John calls.
Sherlock takes a little more than ten minutes in the young woman's room.  When he joins them in the living room, John is struggling to keep the conversation going.  Luckily for him, Sherlock wastes no time.  He's filled with nervous energy, which means he has probably solved the case already.
Sherlock’s voice is reduced to a murmur.  He still can’t seem to look at John in the eyes.  “Despite the fact that you were put in a terrible position by a major failure in my deductions, you offered me to run when you would have stayed there and died.”
"Done what?"
"You are not dying.  Listen to me, Sherlock.  You need to let go.  Just let go."
"Harassing you?" John burst out laughing.  "Oh, you are precious, Sherlock.  Drop you damn phone, will ya?  This is the first time we're sleeping in your parent's house, it's Christmas, you are doing better.  Let's celebrate."
John can understand, to a certain level, comparing it to his own experience.  It appears he, too, feels the urge to prepare mentally, which is barely an extension of his constant need to take care of and protect Sherlock.  It says a lot about their co-dependency.
"Crackers," he says after another few minutes of uneasy silence.  "Especially when you wake up, which well... doesn't really matter since you basically don't sleep.  Crackers, lots of water, and of course, you should never work on an empty stomach.  It's always been wrong, but now it will worsen your symptoms."
Sherlock blinks once again at him, but it seems he can barely keep his eyes open.  "Oh," he whispers slowly. “Give me a couple of minutes to get myself together and I would very much like to reciprocate."
God, it feels amazing.  Sherlock
Hating Sherlock?  John feels a lot of things for the man : admiration, wonder, exasperation, desire, frustration, but most of all something fierce and intense like he has never felt before.  He can't deny anymore that it’s pretty close to love.  And it’s all fine.  Sorting those feelings out took a lot of energy out of John, knowing they would never be reciprocated, but he can deal with it if it means sharing Sherlock’s chaotic, violent, addictive way of life.
Sherlock’s face has tensed and his mouth has quirked into a little grimace.  If he knew he actually looks a little like Mycroft when he does that, it would probably set him off like a rocket.
“Mmm.  Although, to be honest, I am only pretending to work.   The... physical discomfort, it seems, makes me unable to think efficiently.”
"Especially for myself, John.  I can turn it off, of course, if I find myself in a delicate position.  Obviously, most of the time it doesn't work like that -the deduction will have been made before I realise I shouldn't have.  You think I really want to know you have masturbated in the shower when I see you eating breakfast afterwards?"  Count on Sherlock to find the most humiliating example, and then complaining like a bloody martyr.  "I've been perfecting my science for so long now that I'm not even conscious I am doing it.  The gears in my head, they can't be stopped that easily."
“I think you know.”
"Hey, it's alright, you know it's not your fault, the baby presses on your bladder and-"
“And what is the matter, actually?”
"Yes, well, you are still carrying my baby, and a madman, so I'm coming."
"Sherlock what?"
“We are getting you out of here.  Everything will be fine.  Now, let’s get you back to the car, alright?  You are cold, and wet, and in no state to stand in the rain.”
"It's..."
Whenever  Sherlock is so determined, it is impossible to make him change his mind.
"Sherlock, you're sick..." John protests, although he knows it's in vain.
"Caring for a new born.  Given that neither you, nor I, have ever been in the presence of a baby, let alone taken care of it, I deemed that class essential. I mean, just dressing them seems so bloody complicated.  Did you noticed how many poppers there are on some of the pyjamas we bought, only between the legs?... The other day, I hum..."  John clears his throat.  He hadn't planned to admit it, but now it is too late.  "I opened one, the green and yellow with the matching bib.  And then I tried to close it back.  The poppers are minuscule, I could barely work them, and my hands are smaller than yours!"
So, John stops fussing and opens the damn door.
"That is utter bullshit, Sherlock."
Sherlock, whose face is bright red - and oh look, with his ears bare, John can see how the blush has stretched to them, colouring the tip - and whose eyes cast a mix of anger and embarrassment, walks straight past him, and into their bedroom, his newly cut curls bouncing on the top of his head.  It breaks John's heart a little to see him so upset over something as mundane as a haircut.
, and wouldn't touch another drop of alcohol in her life?  Yeah, right.
"On my testicles," Sherlock says quickly, avoiding John's look.  "You told me yourself the swelling was normal at this stage," he adds.
"We should go.  They won't come."
“SHERLOCK.”  John doesn’t raise his voice; he just adds more authority to it.  This time, Sherlock freezes mid-sentence and turns to look at him, mouth slightly open.  His lips are trembling.
"Yes," John agrees curtly.  He's not in the mood for small talk, and the therapist must notice, because he packs his material and makes a quick exit.
to stop. He has no idea how long they've been on the bed together, but he knows the crying fit has the same violence, that it's not even close to abating. He finds his voice, finally.  He doesn't even know if the stream of reassuring nonsense that pours out of his mouth is getting to Sherlock, but he still goes on.  Telling him he's alright, that he's not alone, that John will never, ever leave him... He murmurs terms of endearments, repeats again and again how much he loves him.
Sherlock nips at the skin of his neck in retribution.  John giggles.  Yes. Very sensitive there.
"Cramp," Sherlock growls.
"You're an idiot" Sherlock grunts, annoyed.  He really does not like surprises, neither does he like receiving presents, mostly because it makes him so uneasy, as he tries to react accordingly to social norms and express his thankfulness.
And John thinks he isn't the only one realising how significant those moments Sherlock has decided to share with his mother are.
"John," Mycroft adds, throwing his glowing cigarette butt into the night.  "I am not one to judge you.  No one should.  Sherlock is a master when it comes to hurting other people's feelings.  Call it a defence mechanism, if you will."
"Alright.  Good.  Now listen to me.  I want you to try and follow my breathing rhythm, okay?  There, feel it.  I know you can do it, come on."
"How could've you?" John replies in a reassuring voice.
He helps him into the bed, settles the pillows and blankets to make sure Sherlock is as comfortable as he can, then turns the light off and slides under the sheets himself, stretching his arm to allow Sherlock to rest his head on his shoulder.  It is like a perfectly learned choreography by now.
"... which is why, after many hours of analysis, we have decided it is no longer needed.  Therefore, we have the pleasure to declare you free of your pupil status and..."
"What?" Sherlock frowns, ready, without a doubt, to explain to John a foetus cannot formulate a conscious thought, even less so try to communicate it.  Which, of course, John knows.
"Indeed," John murmurs, sliding his hands under Sherlock's rumpled t-shirt, running them against his smooth skin.  He does it, not only because he likes it, but also because he can feel Sherlock's ribs on a regular basis and evaluate any fluctuation in his weight.  With someone as thin as Sherlock, it doesn't take many pounds, lost or gained, to feel the difference in that area of the body.  Given how sensitive the subject of Sherlock's eating habits always is, better to leave him alone for the moment -or so he thinks.
That is the moment things go south.
"She deserved it."
Sherlock is staring wide in complete surprise.  His sweaty hair is stuck to his head, his lips swollen from having been bitten so much.  He has white circles around his eyes, the rest of his face is beet red, with tiny dots on his cheeks, where capillaries have burst.
Hearing "darling" from Sherlock, though, makes him second-guess his own self-proclaimed indifference on the matter because now there are tears on his cheeks -few, and producing them actually hurts, but John cannot help it.
Sherlock dresses in a swirl of dark fabric, then ties his scarf around his neck. He lifts an eyebrow at John.  "Well?"
The stairs leading to the flat float in front of his eyes.   John’s not drunk: he had Mycroft’s driver drop him to a pub ("
John tries to ask what is wrong, but cannot catch his breath. Sherlock frowns, his mouth shut tight.  His chest, though, trembles through his rumbling giggles, and he grabs John's arm.
"Well, admittedly, the crime scene was quite horrid."
"B.P. is 140/95, heart rate at 84, temperature of 38.1."
John slips into his dressing gown, observing Sherlock in the weak ray of light coming from the window.  Sherlock frowns a little, his lips twitching, but he is still deep under.  Good.  He really does need the rest. Besides, if Sherlock had any say in the matter, he wouldn't be asleep.  He's at a stage where his body has taken the reins.  John knows it should calm him down, and finally shut down the worried voice at the back of his mind, (is Sherlock ok, what if he's not, what if the baby is not, what if...), but all it does is remind him that Sherlock's body is so exhausted he has been momentarily cured of his insomnia.  And they are only on the fourteenth week of the pregnancy.  God.
He's out in a second.  John does not figure out what gave him away.
“It’s quite apparent.”
"What time'zit?"
"Then what is it?"
It’s not easy going back to the city.  They miscalculate the time and find themselves stuck in the evening rush hour.  It’s noisy and humid and John feels he’s choking, trapped in the car, surrounded by angry drivers under the austere crushing shadow of tall and dull concrete buildings.  So much concrete, everywhere.  The only thing that calms him is Sherlock’s reaction, which is the complete opposite of his own.  He is whistling behind the wheel, looking around, a satisfied expression on his face.  It is yet more proof that Sherlock had been ready to sacrifice his own happiness so that he could keep John safe.  The thought is sad, yes, but also comforting.  And John holds onto it to refrain from yelling at the other drivers or snapping at Sherlock, because whistling has always had a way of getting into John’s nerves, even when it comes out of the most pretty, luscious mouth he’s ever laid eyes on.
"Stop scolding me, we're not in primary school," Sherlock murmurs raggedly.  "It is. A. Bloody. plastic.  Doll."
John nods.  Sherlock looks like he's about to address the most pressing issue, John can tell by the way he's fidgeting.  The doctor in him wants to put Sherlock to bed and let him rest, but he can't.  They need to finish this.  Sherlock, especially, needs to express everything that's been going through his mind for the past five days.
"Yes," John smiles. "It could almost feel like a holiday.  I’m going to be a very boring partner, what with the strict rest and limited physical activity, but yes, it does sound good."
“Ok, alright, sorry.”
So.  Thank you.
“John,” Sherlock rasps, his lower lip shaking.  “I am very, very scared.”
"Ok," John answers, docile.
"The bell tower of an abandoned church in Epping Forest. I've already sent a car for you.  It should be there any minute now."
“How?”
John runs his fingers into Sherlock’s wild curls.  He wishes he could stay right there with him, and not worry about the rest.  Sadly, he can see Sherlock straightening his back and rising on his knees, and right on cue, Mycroft is back.  With regret, John kisses Sherlock once more and goes back to his spot at the other end of the chaise-longue.
John grabs sheets from the linen closet and enters the master bedroom.  It’s quite cold, but with the fire running downstairs, it should get warmer quickly if John leaves the door open.  How strange it is, he thinks, flipping down the heavy duvet to have a look at the sheets, to prepare Mycroft’s room.  Mycroft, who decided to drive down here by himself  -John had thought he and Anthea were physically unable to stay apart for too long- and who suggested he could stay the night, what with the bad weather outside and the wrapping of the suspect chase.  It will be surreal, John thinks, snorting, to see him tomorrow morning, what’s left of his hair messed up from sleep, half awake, his nose in his tea cup.  How can a man be such a walking, talking cliché of the quintessence of British poshness that it hurts your brain to see him cook spaghetti in rolled-up sleeves?
And he will remain Sherlock, after all.  He'll never be "normal," not by the common standard anyway.   Maybe John is just as abnormal, though.  He's certainly damaged.  As for how he deals with his own feelings, it isn't brilliant.  He's impulsive, although he can manage to keep it inside. Anger is the main source of those impulses and, most of the time, John doesn't even know why he is angry, although it might very well be related to his relationship with his father, who had a bad temper that often rendered him violent, with his words as well as his fists.
"Well, it is hardly a reason to be surprised, John.  You have always been my compass when it comes to emotions."
“Isn’t it always about Sherlock?”
) - is accepting Brown as his androcologist is a positive enough sign of his approval.
John is absently drawing small circles on Sherlock's stomach.  He likes how it quivers from the simplest touch.
"Ok."
He kisses Sherlock again, longer, using his tongue to explore the inside of his mouth, soft prods and licks that always get Sherlock worked up and moaning.  That he does, before breaking the kiss softly, a flicker of regret in his eyes dark with desire.
John calls Mycroft who comes back from the kitchen with his medical bag in hands.
After a second of hesitation, John sits next to him, close enough for their shoulders and hips to touch.  Sherlock tenses but doesn't move.
This chapter is Mycroft-heavy, and maybe you will find his behaviour unusual, but it is wanted that way.  For those of you who are interested, and have watched the fourth season of the show, I wrote some notes at the end of the chapter about Mycroft's character and how I personally view him.
"Oh my god, what was that?"
Sherlock's blushing face appears over the opened fridge door.  "Well.  I was hungry."
"I know, I can see," Sherlock cuts him off in a low voice.  He takes a hesitant step forward, pressing John's fingers with a death grip, and clears his throat.  "As I was saying, a simple thank you carries as much... As much huh..."
Sherlock nods.
"I do not wish to go into details. I already told you, my twenties were a difficult period for me.  Let's just say that, due to a series of events, I became well known by the police and judiciary system alike.  Then, I found myself in solitary and..."
It doesn't take long to solve the case.  Sherlock is even more exuberant than usual, even more brilliant.  The body stolen from the morgue -not Saint-Bart, luckily- is found on day five by a triumphant Sherlock. The artificial lake behind the victim's property is drained.  If Sherlock hadn't determined that the mud traces left behind was very specific to a certain London area, they would still be looking.
The elevator door opens on a quiet floor.  The nurse puts the mask back into place, staring at John severely, while the orderly pushes the gurney into the corridor.
"It's ok," he finally says.  "I'm ok, Harry, no need to come.  How is uncle Will?"
"Right now, just the feeling of something tickling the back of my throat, and a light pressure in my sinuses."
Sherlock.  His posh boy.
John knows what is happening.  He's seen it often in Afghanistan.  That moment where everything breaks.  Men don't cry. Soldiers even less. And when the horror becomes too much, when there is no more room inside to store away the pain, it spills out despite themselves.  Grown men don't know how to cry.  It's like watching the sorrow getting ripped from them. It's loud and ugly and painful.
He's thinking he got away with it and congratulating himself when all of sudden, Sherlock's body tenses and he moves away from John, fighting to sit up.
Sherlock huffs in exasperation and waits for John to hand the now screaming man to police officers.
"I don't give a shit.  Where are we going?" John snaps at him.
“Yes.  As a matter of fact, it is very empowering and even exhilarating.”
“I know there is a lot of fluid, John,” Sherlock pants, “but if you can add lubricant it wouldn’t hurt... I’ve got to push now.  Are you ready?
"So, I started with a low dosage but had to increase it quite high.  He's very, very relaxed," Amy shrugs.  "Don’t worry; a single use can’t hurt the baby, but Sherlock is..."
It seems that only a second has passed, and John is still on the ground, but Sherlock has finally began fighting.  For a moment, all John can see is the entangled limbs of the two men brawling a few feet away, Sherlock's coat swirling around them.  Chambers is groaning and mumbling while Sherlock, his voice calm -even when he is obviously short of breath- but managing to sound pissed and exasperated.  John can't help but admire the way he moves, managing to immobilise Chambers on his back, down on the pavement, by trapping his hands behind his back and putting a knee on his chest.  Sherlock's hair is a mess, he's panting, his scarf untangled, one of his coat's button hole ripped, and still, he looks elegant and graceful.  Almighty.
He loved her, and she kept saying the only time she ever felt safe was with him.  Then, she fell pregnant, and it seemed that, for a while, she was more relaxed, almost happy.  She agreed to go to all of her doctor's appointment and even took a prenatal class with Beeks.  She was excited to be a mother.  After the baby's birth, though, things took a turn for the worst.  She was transferring her fears to Sophie, and began to worry that if her father found her, what would happen to the baby?  Despite Stephen Beeks' promising he would protect them both, she refused to hire a nanny, or to go back to work, and left the house even less often.  She loved Sophie, but she expressed, on more than one occasion, regret at have given birth to her, to have condemned her to a life of fear.  Beeks knew she was mentally unstable, and he kept telling himself she needed professional help.
"Oh god, yes," John is shaking.  He's not sure he'll last long enough for Sherlock to actually help him, just the feel of those long, elegant fingers around his burning flesh is almost too much.
Ah.  Yes.  There is still the matter of that innocent-looking ninja/Olympic runner/murderer to catch.  John nods, almost glad something has stopped Sherlock, and then he's back to running, ignoring the pain and the blisters and his decidedly unhappy lungs.
“You are such a sycophantic sucker,” Sherlock spits, but his tone is almost affectionate.  “John,” he warns.  “It’s starting.”
"I cannot lose you.  Do not make me do this alone."
"I know," he finally whispers.  "I'm sorry."
"Ok," he says.
This time, a whole five minutes passes before another contraction starts.  Sherlock refuses to move from his spot.  The best John can do is slide a cushion under his knees.  He encourages him to rest while he can, caressing his hair –it’s always done wonders to calm him down.  Meanwhile, Mycroft is walking back and forth, taking to the bedroom everything John asked him to.  It would almost be funny to watch him half walking, half running, with none of the slow, lazy elegance he usually displays –John is too worried to laugh, though.  He’s anxious to get Sherlock settled in the bedroom and to evaluate his progression, which won’t happen until after the next contraction.  When it finally comes, John can immediately tell it is a bad one, by the way Sherlock clenches his teeth as tears of pain slide down his cheeks.  The quiet moans are stuck in his throat.  He’s working hard not to be too loud, which has him breathing way too superficially, and must be physically exhausting.
"What?"
"Hey, whoa, I am with you there.  Calm down," John tries.
Finally, one last thing.  The last part which I am currently writing contains a lot of fluff and happy moments, but I wanted to warn those of you that it also has Sherlock going through a quite serious baby-blues -nothing long-lasting, and it doesn't shift into a post-partum depression, but there is still some hurt ahead with, of course, the happy ending I always promise to my readers.  If some of you are sensitive to that issue, or are part of the mpreg amateurs who absolutely despise kidfics (not judging) you can simply end the story there.
Sherlock huffs.  “Oh, John, do not be ridiculous.  I was merely predicting the undoubtedly romanticised version of today’s event from your overly sentimental prose.  If we want to be down to earth and pragmatic... Sage’s birth is more of a consequence than anything else.  My body was submitted to stress for a few days, and I couldn’t rest properly.  It is enough to kick-start a labour, as you well know.”
"Yes?"
"Okay, okay, I get it.  I just... I don't know, I like it, I guess," John admits with a little bit of embarrassment.
"It was rather extraordinary," he agrees after a while.  "Thank you, John."
From that first impression – the desirable but untouchable Sherlock Holmes, who did not care for John except when he wanted to impress someone or to think out loud - it came as a surprise that they actually got used to each other and warmed up enough to become friends. With that came John’s realisation that he had been wrong about Sherlock - he’s no sociopath. So very far from  it.
"I can't... I cannot, Juh- John-"
Sherlock frowns.
John and Mycroft exchange a silent look.  It’s happening, Mycroft’s eyes say.  Yes, it is, John answers.
Why is his heart pounding so hard, then, and his palms sweaty, enough that his glass slips and he straightens his hold just in time?
Why can't he think?  What the hell is happening?  John's whole leg feels wet, and maybe it is only that, maybe he's lying in a puddle of dirty water... But then, what is that smell, that very familiar smell reminding him of his hospital shifts, or a makeshift tent in Afghanistan where he tries to do his work, save lives...
"No I didn't, now come on!"
John gets lost, for a little bit, as he bends until he can shove his nose in Sherlock's pubic hair, breathing in, and each intake of breath has his heavy cock twitching with anticipation.
"Oh.  Explains Sherlock's insomnia."
Sherlock knows John wants to ask about the dream.  It is clear he tries to buy a little time, first asking for a glass of water, than to dress in his pajamas -he doesn't like to be exposed at this stage of his pregnancy, and has spent most of the day in pants.  It's ten minutes before John settles back in bed next to him.
around midnight.
Sherlock seems to realize his mistake and takes a deep breath before taking a step toward John’s bed.  He points at the side of the mattress.  “Can I?”
“He was supposed to be cold and unattainable,” John says, whispering as well, without knowing why.  “A bloody magnificent marble statue.”
Good.  John is, himself, busy blushing so fast it is borderline painful.
"You keep your bloody eyes open, you hear me?" Sherlock spits, looking so damn angry, and that won't do, not at all.
"Won't you get bored, though?  With no case to work on?"
Harry sighs very softly.  "Yes, he did.  He seems to love you very much, Johnny.  I am happy for you."
It is cracking, this facade; has been progressively, over the last few months.  John can very well see in Mycroft’s eyes the quick flashes of affection, or worry, as Mycroft has witnessed Sherlock’s transformation from a too-thin man moving with grace and agility, to the slower, clumsier version of himself he has become, carrying an ever-growing belly in front of him.  When they are together, he will behave less disdainfully and complacently than usual, and will often let go when Sherlock’s bantering gets too personal, or cruel.  He just doesn’t answer, which takes Sherlock completely off guard, each time. With time, though, it seems he has processed the same observations as John and has decided he could deal with his brother’s less distant, more warm-hearted attitude.
"Remember," John points out when the taxi stops in front of the community centre.  "If you decide to spend the duration of the class in your mind palace, what we are doing is pointless."
"Yes, I'm just going to clean the kitchen a bit.  Don't worry, I'll be back in five."
"John."  (Jaaawn)
John tries to calm down.  He waits, eyes closed, letting his guard down.  Tries to remember the movie he saw last week, the one he enjoyed so much.  There was a cop and a-
Sherlock widens his legs.  The sheet falls down, but none of them care.  Amniotic liquid is dripping on the floor, almost as much as when his water first broke.
he thinks, turning the other man on his back to kiss him properly.
Mycroft
Sherlock nods, intertwining his fingers with John's.
It is quite surprising, seeing Mycroft going about in the kitchen like he belongs there.  He has dropped his tie, rolled up his shirt-sleeves and wears an apron John didn’t even know they had, a faded pink one with white, curvy letters stating that
John tries not to smile too much at Sherlock's praise.  He knows how sensitive he is to John playing the badass soldier when they are on a case; also, how he gets off on it.
disdainful at the same time.
"You are getting better," he says, bending toward Sherlock so that he can kiss him properly this time, on the mouth.
He turns the phone toward John so that he can have a clear view.
"Yes," Sherlock says patiently, rolling his eyes.
"If John is letting you have your way then I don't want to hear it.  How did Mycroft not see it this time?"
"Well, John, I am sure there is still a lot you ignore about what put Sherlock in that delicate position in the first place."
P.S.  I know I have some readers who, like me, really love the Mycroft character, and I hope you guys are happy about the place he has in the sixth part of my story.
John doesn't question how he knows what John is thinking.
"You have a baby," she says, tilting her head to look at him from under a strand of hair.
"Sherlock," John warns.
“Yes, that is also true.  Would it surprise you, Dr. Watson, if I were to tell you that Sherlock never had a romantic relationship, or a single sexual encounter?  The furthest he got was kissing a boy when he was fifteen.  He’s disciplined himself ever since to treat his body like transport and eliminate everything that could get in the way of his thought process.  Is it the real reason?  Well, it’s not my story to tell.  The fact remains.  At thirty-six years old, my brother is in love for the first time, and you are the object of his affection.”
John takes a deep breath.  There is a third option he hadn’t thought about, that doesn’t involve trying to lie –it doesn’t even involve talking.  And it’s so, so much better.
Sherlock stops playing but remains at the window, his back turned to John.
"We're talking about furniture and you make it sound like a genetic experiment."
"Hands where I can see them."
“Sherlock,” John cuts him off, using his Captain Watson voice although he doesn’t quite know why.  “I knew you would get us out of there.  I
::: :::
"Why are you so shocked? You knew quite accurately what we were doing here," he states, tilting his head at Sherlock.  “I imagine you hadn't considered that I would take such an interest in John's project, not enough to provide some improvements of my own.  You thought about a microscope, maybe a working table and a fresh coat of paint, but nothing of this scale."
Sherlock wipes his hand on John's jeans, where it joins his own release.  Then he collapses on John, careful to put much of his weight to the side of the couch as not to crush him.
After the "bath" comes time to dress the doll.  John takes a newborn size nappy and manipulates the doll's legs with caution, lifting its bum to slide the nappy underneath.
Sherlock stares at John –one of those piercing gazes that always feels like he’s digging into John’s mind and soul with a simple look, reading him, in and out.  Then, he nods slowly.  “Alright.”
Okay, he cannot stop himself this time.  He walks slowly along the hallway, at the end of which the bathroom door is half open.  Slowing down, John takes a couple of steps, just so he can at least have a peak.
"Sherlock, wishing to put people into shock isn't very nice," John replies playfully, pinching his left arse cheek.  Sherlock squeals, then blushes, then focuses on rubbing himself against John's crotch.
"Get rid of
"Of course you love our child, Sherlock, it shows."
Yes, the first three days of Sherlock's strict bed rest have John thinking it might just go on like that.  Maybe he had been over-thinking it.
He still doesn’t know what to say -and that is, if he is even able to say something.
John is too tired to question the abrupt change of subject.
"That is a poor response coming from you.  But seriously, Sherlock, in the end, it is just hair."
It's hard, keeping his composure because it's so scary, seeing Sherlock like this -it hurts.  Physically.  Mentally.
"Jesus, this is hell," Sherlock mumbles under his breath, wrapping his arms tighter around his legs.
"My leg is fine."
"But you don't understand... I..."
"As it is sometimes the case, I absorbed her in the womb."
"It was lovely.  Your parents are so excited."
, Sherlock shouts, and the frustration makes his voice tremble. For a second, it appears as if he's going to burst into tears.
And John does.  He keeps a slow rhythm, pushing as deep as he can before withdrawing, until his dick catches the rim of Sherlock's entrance, before pushing again.  Sherlock lays there, taking it, panting hoarsely, then begins to move his hips, meeting each trust with a high-pitched whine John is certain he doesn't realize he's making.  As for himself, he makes sure he keeps a soft, reassuring tone, and he praises Sherlock, lets himself go and says everything that goes through his head, pours his love onto him between harsh pants, too lost in pleasure to filter his thoughts.  When Sherlock's eyes widen and his inner muscles start contracting around John's dick, he takes the signal.
"Well... I learned from the best."
"We do," Sherlock agrees.  "That is why we are here, after all.  To...
“Done.”
"Mmh."
Sherlock observes John for a few seconds, then nods.
The drive to Sherlock's parents takes almost five hours.  It is the first time they have travelled there by car -which is hardly surprising, given that it is only their second visit.  They borrowed Mycroft's car and left shortly after nine that morning.  It's the twenty-fourth of December.  Although Sherlock declares Christmas is nothing but the stupid modern commercialisation of an otherwise very interesting pagan ritual, he doesn't really hate it.  Last year, he had put a lot of thought into John and Mrs. Hudson's gifts, and had composed a new melody for the event.
"My John," Sherlock hums low in his throat.  He's starting to relax.
Sherlock gives him an offended look.
"But... that is the problem, John, I..."
The three tests are lined up on the kitchen table, each urine sample used disposed the same way.  When John had wanted to protest about the questionable hygiene of it, Sherlock had lift a disbelieving eyebrow at him.  "Really?  You have no idea what this table has seen in the past year."
He then gives the address of the abandoned building and the floor where the body had been found.  "I did not kill her.  I know you have no reason to believe me, but I would've never hurt Alex."
"Yes, well, let her.  I do not wish to explain myself any further." Sherlock retorts.
"Because I am."
"Oh, Sherlock..."
"It is strange."
Sherlock rolls his eyes, and it's so normal, so him, that John is shaken by a nervous bout of laughter.
"We can now start the work on the nursery in your old room." Sherlock states, sitting up straight and sudden.  A project.  Sherlock will jump on anything that can distract him from boredom, and too much time to think about difficult stuff like love and concern.
"What is says.  It means you need to stay in bed, and I will allow short sitting periods, only half an hour at a time.  The only valid reasons you can leave bed are to eat and get cleaned up."
"It this alright?" He asks, although he already knows the answer.  Sherlock has lifted himself on his elbows to look, tilting his head so that his belly isn't in the way.  John had discovered, early on, that giving him head is the quickest way to get him to come.
"I also said 'ridiculous' and 'awful' at some point."
Very well.
"Sherlock."
John can hear the conversation, although he can't see Mycroft's face from where he stands.  Sherlock has seated himself in front of his brother and is observing him with the expression he has when he's a little out of his depth, trying to figure out something.
“Yes.”
The more he speaks, the more John feels like an idiot.  Oh, it's so easy to call Sherlock a drama queen and childish, but he's no better.  He snorts.  "My god, I need a little action.  Sorry, Sherlock.  Seriously.  I shouldn't have taken your phone.  It wasn't my most mature moment."
Sherlock's room isn't a private one, but part of an observation station that is separated into four glass cubicles, all accessible by a nurse station in the middle.  Luckily, only another cubicle is occupied and the curtains are drawn on the large glass panels.
Of course, Sherlock had done a personal investigation regarding Alexandra’s family, and had found that her father was now incapacitated, living in a nursing home.  He had assured Beek that no one was coming for his young daughter.  Alexandra would havean official funeral as soon as the body was released from the morgue.  Beeks was adamant on doing everything properly.
John nods, about to turn on his heels, but Amy holds him back.
Sherlock sleeps four hours in a row; he wakes up in a better mood than he has been in over the past couple of weeks.  He even tells John that much, which is, in itself, a small miracle.  Another long week passes without a case -even worse, there is a heatwave in London, not unusual that late in August.  Sherlock hates heat, it makes him snappy and impatient.  During the last one, he bought five fans -five!- and settled in the kitchen -less light, less heat- surrounded by them, like an improbable king wearing goggles and manipulating toxic substances.  Ah.  Good times.  Greg surely appreciated the picture.
"Ah, what a shame, Mycroft being apparently happy for us and respectful of our decision instead of being his usual self-satisfied prat."
"John," he murmurs between short intakes of breath, "demisexual... It huh... means I need to feel a deep, affective connection, to be physically attracted to someone... And you... oh god, god, John..."
“No, I can’t, let me... Don’t... John, it hurts too much, stop it!” Sherlock’s spite reminds John of the way he addresses Anderson, when his incompetence is slowing down a case.
"What I mean to say is that you should be happy now, the news is out.  Oh.  I didn't mean to sound resentful.  My apologies, I am quite tired.  I shouldn't point out Lestrade's lack of open-mindedness while we are both indebted to him, as there is no doubt his knowledge of the tourniquet method and unshakable calm during tonight's events are the reason you are here with me and not... not..."
insecure.  As for Anderson, you needn't worry.  I am regularly overcome with the violent desire to terminate his life, and so far, I have been capable of restraining myself.  If barely."
Beeks speaks.  It is peculiar, John thinks, how you can unravel the essence of a person's life in a ten-minute speech.  He met Alexandra Jez at the little gardening shop.  It had been love at first sight.  He knew her as Camila, and it was only when he had suggested they could regulate her situation that she admitted she was on the run.  She was the daughter of a Polish diplomat who was a psychopath that exerted complete control over her and her mother.  She had tried to run when she'd been a teenager, but he had successfully used his numerous connections to have her back.  There was no type of abuse - sexual, physical or psychological - she hadn't been submitted to.  And although she'd been in England for a year at that point, and her father, who had suffered a stroke a month before her second tentative to escape him, wasn't as capable as he used to, she was still living in fear, constantly.  Beeks had tried to help her at first, suggesting they could go to the embassy, explain her story to immigration.  She said if he continued to insist one morning he would wake up and she would be gone.  He also tried to get her to see a psychologist: her fear wasn't "normal" according to Beeks.  It was too much.  She was always watching her back, refused to do anything social, and only left the house to work, or when she was forced to.
"I know you did not kill her," Sherlock says calmly, still staring at the photographs.  "My companion," he points at John, "has a very imaginative mind, and it would be selfish of me to keep him from the interest of a tragic love story.  So please, proceed.  From the beginning."
Amy Brown begins with the good news.  By then, Sherlock is wide awake -an androcologic examination will do that to you- and mostly back to himself, if somewhat quieter than usual.  It's no real surprise that the uterus cervix remains unmoved at one centimetre, but John still feels a weight leaving him, as he lets out a trembling breath he did not know he was holding.  He helps Sherlock out of the stirrups and covers his legs quickly, understanding how uncomfortable and uneasy he must feel -hell, John can honestly admit he's glad he's not the one in that position.
"Legs.  Up.  If we can both fit on the couch back home, we can fit in this bed."
John waits until he’s finished his tour and is examining the decontamination shower to speak.  "I was the one insisting we had one of those.  I am not saying it will ever be used because you never make mistakes but..." He shrugs, and Sherlock's piercing gaze is a challenge; John must expect consequences if he dares tell Mycroft about that time John was in the shower and Sherlock crashed in, fully clothed, calling himself stupid while washing the chemicals spilled all over himself, ignoring John's presence.
Nevertheless,
", John knows better.  He had seen the softness of his expression.  It is like here, in contrast to London, Sherlock's brain has slowed down a little, adjusting to their environment.  So far, Lestrade hasn't text or call for help, but it doesn't even seem to bother him.  He seems content to go through -again- his thick folder where he keeps old, unsolved cases. He has also begun an experiment in the backyard.  John hadn't asked what it was, or why it needed to be outside. When it comes to Sherlock and experiments, it sometimes is wiser not to know.  There will be time for wondering what the strange smell is, or why all the plants are suddenly glowing in the dark.
The case’s nature has of course resonated deeply with Sherlock, and if he does appear to think about it often, he is in no way obsessed with it.  To some extent, John figures, the fear of a post-partum depression has just glued itself to the swirling maelstrom of Sherlock’s insecurities regarding the birth.  He is confident the case will fade away soon enough.
It’s another fight to get Sherlock on the sofa instead of kneeling in front of it.  John has to shout over his own cries, explaining he does not have a choice, he needs to check him.  Sherlock stops working against them, then, and they can lower him safely onto the sofa.  Mycroft’s face is deep red, he pants loudly through his nose and seems close to panic himself.  Sherlock is groaning from the effort of turning on his side, curling in on himself, groaning through the contraction.
John gapes another second.
John feels his forehead.  It is warm, but not overly so.  "We'll see. What are your symptoms?"
Sherlock tries to sit up abruptly, which he cannot do anymore.  After the third attempt, he settles to turn his back to John, curling on his side and pushing him back when he tries to touch him.
Sherlock nods again.  His face is half covered by an oxygen mask now, and John hates not being able to see him properly to assess his psychological state.  He has no choice, though: with Sherlock's sinuses being as clogged as they are, a nasal cannula wouldn't be effective.
Seemed funny back then.  Now, as it often happens when they are on a case that is supposed to be simple, things are going downhill, quickly.
Sherlock is looking back at him, still settled over Chambers.  The man is pleading in a low, panicked voice, asking for his glasses.  Sherlock shushes him without a single look.  He's too busy rolling his eyes.
John's voice becomes stronger, steadier. His fingers find their way into Sherlock's damp hair and he scratches at his scalp lightly, knowing how much he likes it.
"I am losing myself," Sherlock hisses.  "I can't control anything anymore.  I am not fit to care for myself, how can you do this to me?  Make me believe I am that formidable person, courageous, selfless; thinking -and convincing me- that I can actually do this, carry a child and then care for it.  The worst of it is that most of the time, it works.  I am so stupid, I feel good about myself, and I am actually looking forward to all that is to come.  And then, something like... the bloody heartbeat of a lentil has reality coming back to slap me in the face because I have. No idea.  What I'm doing.  And you -you, John, dear John, always so comforting and positive because you are enough of an idiot to think I am worth it, that I won't screw this up.  How dare you say you know what I am going through with your tiny, boring brain.”
“I think...I think I am ready, John,” Sherlock finally says –well, whispers.
“Not right now.  I’ve requested a military helicopter, a prototype that isn’t even officially part of our air force, it is a part of a secret-“
"Fair enough."
"Yeah, it is part of my plan, you know, to help you.  You did ask for my help, remember," John explains, feigning being close to sleep.
"But I am serious, John!  What else can I say about a couch, except that it seems to fill its purpose?"
