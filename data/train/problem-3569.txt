“You just what?” He grabs a can of beer from the bag on the table and takes a hearty pull, sputtering as he pulls the can from his mouth, he wipes the foam with the back of his, “let your father rot in the Empty? after everything he did for you?” It’s too warm, the drink, he finishes it anyway.
“Dean?” He feels Cas’ hand on his bicep, his voice sounds like he’s speaking to him from underwater. “Are you okay?”
He doesn’t go too far though, he keeps his hands on Dean’s shoulders, rubbing through the fabric of his shirt, small, reassuring circles. His skin burns. Cas lets out a breath, his whole body shaking with it. “Are you alright, Dean?” He asks, his voice vibrating slightly in the sweet summer breeze.
quick and fast but he still can’t quite breath, he grips at the back of Cas’ shirt like a lifeline, nails digging into the fabric, he can feel his skin underneath, if he could think properly he’d pull back knowing he’s probably hurting him but he isn’t so he doesn’t.
So he does. He tells him about Harry and the state of his body, he doesn’t have much, it’d be embarrassing how little he has if he was telling anyone but Cas. He tells him about the marks and the heart, how he’s suspecting magic.
Cas wants to kiss him too, wants to kiss every part of him but Dean doesn’t let up, keeps him pressed beneath him. He’s whispering things into his skin, things he can’t quite make out. His head is swimming with desires, with wants he’s too afraid to name but he doesn’t need to, this is more than enough. He finds his way back to Cas' mouth, and he lets out a sound that when they part to breathe Dean's eyes are dark and wanting. He reaches to pull him back down, to feel
He thinks about Cas, standing right in front of him, telling him that he’s made of love, that he loves, that he’s loved. He should’ve done something more, should have said something else, something other than “Don’t” but that’s all he could think, that’s all that bounced around the inside of his skull. Don’t as in
A lump forms at the base of Dean’s throat, and that’s just it isn’t it. Cas doesn’t want to stay, he has to, he doesn’t have a home outside the bunker, he never really had the bunker either which is mainly Dean’s own fault to his own chagrin. Cas has never stayed longer than he needed to, and when he wanted to, if he wanted to, he couldn’t.
He picks up the pie on the ground and tosses it in the garbage can next to him, then starts rubbing at the red stain on his jeans. He hasn’t been watching the man in the napkin line as he does this, doesn’t know he was in line for both napkins and for honey. Dean means to look away when he knows the man will be half-facing him but he doesn’t, and when the man turns, Dean can’t remember how to breathe.
“Yeah uh, just doing my due diligence, are you,” he scratches the back of his neck, “it’s alright that I’m here?”
He knows what it feels like to die, to feel your heart stop and sometimes it’s through a needle or a blade to the chest, and sometimes it’s watching your best friend tell you he loves you and then gets pulled to nothingness.
Cas rolls his eyes like he’s offended at Dean’s implication that a common witch could get the best of him as if it’s an impossible feat. “Fine.”
“Dean?” He tilts his head in question and Dean falls forward, collapses into Cas’ arms. He’s not crying but his chest is rising
Dean wasn’t expecting such an earnest response this early in the morning and feels his cheeks heat up. Cas’s eyes slightly widen like he didn’t know he was going to say it either but he doesn’t waver.
Cas turns toward him without even thinking about it, Dean knows this. He can see it in the wide, wild look in his eyes as he registers Dean almost beside him, and the way his plate vaults to the street, landing pie first. There’s a moment, just a small one, where he expects Cas’ to look at him and it doesn’t make his heart hammering in his chest, or his throat to dry out completely—that maybe it’s not Cas, just someone who looks like him.
He doesn’t tell Cas that he knows him, that he knows his sounds, the weight of him, the feeling of him. He’d be able to feel his presence in a stadium of people. He knows the sounds of Cas snoring, he’s heard them before, not often. Only one night sticks out for him, the night he met him at the Gas ’n’ Sip. Cas had curled up beside him on the crap mattress above the blankets, overcome with fatigue. Dean didn’t want to fall asleep, he watched Cas’ chest heave up and down with each breath, his face softens out as he fell deeper and deeper into sleep. It wasn’t until he started snoring, a soft, quiet expelling of breath that Dean had found himself falling asleep. It was the best sleep he had had in months at the time.
His fingers twitch beneath his thigh. He takes a sip of his coffee. He tries his best not to choke, he’d forgotten about the sugar packets. “I take it you knew him?” He sets his cup down.
“My daughter, Riley.” Okay, that makes sense, he doesn’t see how a girl like her would choose to work in a police station, and looking at her father, she probably didn’t.
“Cas, I…” He starts, sitting so close to Cas but not touching him,  “I needed to see you okay. I turned you out, man, when you needed me and I fucked everything up. I need you to know that I’m sorry and that I understand if you’re angry with me but there are things happening, things going on that I can’t tell you and that’s the
“Hey, hey.” Dean’s hands are warm on his cheeks as he tilts Cas’ head down to meet his own. The callouses on the tips of his fingers bring Cas back to the present, he feels the scratch of the sheets on his skin, the breeze from the open window. He blinks and a tear drips down his cheek, meeting Dean’s thumb. He lifts himself and pulls Cas down so their lips meet in a soft kiss, barely brushing, it’s nothing more than something to ground him, to remind him what’s real.
It bounces around the inside of his skull like a wasp locked in a mason jar being shaken around. He feels it looking for a way out, buzzing violently around; it doesn’t want to be forgotten about.
She's quiet for a minute, a contemplative silence in the loud and rowdy bar. He’d almost forgotten there were other people around. She picks at the skin of her thumb.
just don’t happen around here. Now, I’ll give you the files and I’ll give them information about Harry but that’s it.”
“‘M sorry, ‘bout today.” He mumbles from beneath his pillow. He can’t see Dean beside him, but he can feel him, the warmth he radiates, the way he smells after a shower-- coconut and lavender, he must’ve used Cas’ soaps. He pulls his head out from beneath his pillow to let the scent wash over him.
When they lived in the Bunker the lack of windows didn’t matter much to Cas when it came to the passing of time. He knew it was morning when Dean strolled into the bunker’s kitchen, face swollen with sleep, hair messily flattened out with the palm of his hand, his robe tied loosely around his waist. He’d pour himself a coffee, ask Cas if he wanted one and when Cas refused him, made him one anyway. Afternoons were spent predictably but rarely ever the same. There’d be case hunting, researching, grocery shopping, brotherly arguments. This was a life still under the thumb of God and his writings, there were rarely ever lulls in action or drama but they found moments. Shared meals, drives along the quiet and empty back Kansas roads. He measures out his days in Dean’s smiles, in the small touches he is granted and gifted back in return. In Sam’s laughter, in the quiet camaraderie, they’ve built together. They found a home, all three of them together no matter what was thrown at them.
His voice soaks in the very depths of Cas’ bones, into the soul he thinks he’s finally grown and lights up his entire body. He feels his chest tightening and knows what this feeling is more than most, his eyes are welling up, blurring the darkness before him. Dean shouldn’t be doing this, he’s nothing to pray to, nothing to pray for. But Dean says he needs him, that he wants him, that it’s terrifying and he chokes back a sob at how much he understands what he means. He can hear Dean’s words, hear the stutter of his voice, the hitches in his breath but he can’t
Because he does know and Cas hates that he knows because Cas had to tell him and then died in front of him. It never should have been like that, Dean shouldn’t know, but he does and it’s such a weight on him, on Dean, even on Jack that he’s like this, that he can’t see how wonderful he has it, that he makes his family have to take care of him when it’s supposed to be him taking care of them.
“Alright. Jesus Sam, I got it.” He doesn’t exactly know what Sam was saying but he pushes up off the bench and side steps over the lump of pie on the street towards the small table of napkins, forks, and toppings. There’s a small line when he gets there.
His bloodied knuckles sting as he wraps his fingers around Baby’s wheel. He eyes the clock above the radio, it clicks 11:30 just as he drives by a small little diner that every small town he’s ever been in has had. He can’t remember the last time he felt he dull ache of hunger, or even the cravings of something familiar to eat but he can feel himself fading, can hear Sam’s bitching in his ear, so, he turns around.
“This, is my friend Tyler, she doesn’t live in town, she’s staying with me for a few weeks while they fumigate her whole building, something about mites, or bugs, or whatever.” The woman, Tyler, looks down as she chuckles like Marnie said something funny. He smiles like he understands.
He squints at him like he said something wrong, “I ain’t his wife or nothing, just know him from around town but I’ve arrested him more than a couple of times. Nothing serious, just locked him up in tank until he sobered up.”
“How very chivalrous of you Dean.” Sam jokes, putting on the worst British accent he’s ever heard, then settles into something more uncomfortable, but sentimental all the same. “So you uh, you guys…” He gestures between them.
“I know it’s been hard for you, really hard and I know I’ve done nothing to help, hell, I’ve made it even worse for you. I just," Cas pulls himself up, kneeling like he knows Dean is doing too, his heart is racing again and he knows without a doubt, Dean can hear it too now.
One of the greatest gifts a life of freedom has given Cas is the never-ending and ever-constant gift of mornings. That is, in theory.
“Dean. I-I was content with our relationship as it was, I never needed you to love me back.” His voice is thick and deep with arousal contrasting with soft kisses he’s pressing along the line of Dean’s neck in a rabid fashion, like Dean might disappear from between his hands any second.
It’s an exhausting thing, carrying around a body, tending to its needs which he still can’t quite figure out. There’s something so fragile about being human he can’t stand it, but he knows not to say any of this outloud. Like he told Dean earlier that day, the intricacies of human emotion and thought are so vivid and complicated, he struggles. There are so many rules and rituals and silent understandings that Cas feels one odd stare away from self-imploding. He just wishes at least for right now (but not for the first time) that when he’s tired and hungry, and his hand is still dripping blood around the handkerchief Dean wrapped it in, that he had his grace back.
He nods, she offers him her hand. “The name’s George.” Her grip is tight and her fingers calloused, she definitely knows her way around a gun. She can probably tell that Dean does as well. It’s comforting.
again, but Dean turns over and flops back into the mattress, pulling Cas onto his chest and wrapping a hand around him. His hands are shaking as they roam around his back.
“I… I” He takes a breath, the lines of his face don’t smoothen out, his face remains tight and his brows furrowed. Dean’s stomach tightens.
Cas watches as Dean’s lip quirks up into a small smile, one he doesn't get to see very often, and then watches it quickly disappear. “Yeah, I guess so too.”
They were all so lucky, they didn’t have to wear their skin like a pair of clothes pulling around the edges to make themselves fit into older versions of themselves, they didn’t even know they had to.
There’s a commotion, Marnie looks shocked and upset and scrambles inside her apron for something, but Dean can’t tell what it is. Then, Cas is turning around and standing right in front of him, a bandaid wrapped around his thumb.
As that thought shoots its way to the surface his fingers tense, his stomach rolls and he shoves Cas again, this time away from him. Dean stumbles backwards catching the wall on the opposite side of the alley, he sinks down against the street and buries his head in his hands, his fingers digging into his hair. He’s mumbling, he can’t feel his body. He wants to look up and see Cas again but if he does he’s going to start crying or start yelling or he’s either going to hurt him or himself so he tightens his grip on his hands. Blood drips down his nose onto the asphalt below, he doesn’t shove his hand up to stop it, let it drip down his face, staining his skin, stain the street below him.
“Cas,” his voice shakes, it’s quieter than he’s used to, there’s something different, something familiar about the way he says his name but he can’t quite place it.
Dean clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth. “If you think of anything important about anything, give me a call.” He hands her over the fabricated FBI card with his number and tosses a few bills too many on the table for his meal.
So he doesn’t, he just pulls his head from in between his knees and lets it fall back against the bricks of the wall. He’s getting blood everywhere he can feel it sticky on his fingers, his palms, his shirt is thick with it, but when he looks down there’s nothing.
Cas isn’t happy about it judging by the look in his eyes which makes Dean even angrier. He wants to hit him, really hit him but he can’t because he knows it’ll actually hurt him.
Dean laughs, but it's dark, and malicious, he never knew laughter could be so unhappy. “Do what, Cas? See how I fucked everything up and how I can’t do anything about it?”
His voice is soft when he speaks, “How about we start with dinner? You can help me in the kitchen if you’d like.”
Dean goes about his usual morning routine; waking Jack, getting him dressed and ready for school. Cas is rarely awake for these moments and though he is barely even there, he can hear their laughter from across the hall in the kitchen, Jack begging for pancakes until Dean agrees (though Cas knows he was always going to make them anyway), he hears the clink of glasses and plates, the sizzling of the pan on the stove, they’re all far away, not just in another room, but like they’re being run through a filter.
“I don't..” He can feel Dean’s eyes are searching his face, looking for answers perhaps or just looking. Although he feels safe in the dark, feels bravery he has only ever felt in the light when he was light, he can never tell Dean what he means. To burden Dean with his feelings, his love would rip their relationship to pieces, it would change everything, it would change Dean. He deserves to know he is loved, but to be loved by him is something he doesn’t deserve, he doesn’t deserve the weight of it all, Cas can carry it all for as long as he lives, he doesn’t need it in return, he just needs this.
He raps his knuckles on the front desk in a rhythmic beat of the front desk of the Sheriff’s office. It’s currently empty,
“She was putting the moves on me yesterday, she’s a real pistol but I guess you’re more her type… You gonna call her?”
At other points in his life mornings were meaningless, the repetitive start of a new day. As an angel the passing of time flowed all around him, palpable, constant. It was perhaps the one constant thing in his existence other than God but even still, he never really paid attention to its passing at all until he met Dean.
Cas has always been kind of selfish when it comes to Dean and what comes out of his mouth next is possibly the most he’s been in a long time. “Then I’m not sleeping on the bed without you in it as well.”
Cas downs the chocolate milkshake rather quickly, Dean takes note of that, as well as the sprite, apple juice, and iced tea. He also takes note of the small wrinkle of disgust Cas got when he tried the root beer and lemonade.
And although he feels it like a knife inside him, slowly sinking past the blood and tissue of his heart, carving away at the bones that hold him together; there’s a quietness to it, he surmises, to finally knowing what it all boils down to. That people leave, that they’re always going to leave and that I love you is just as good as any goodbye that could ever be given.
There’s only so much a cheap, dry napkin can do. Most of the blood is gone, he doesn’t feel it trickling down his skin anymore but it’s still there, he can feel his skin sticky in the spring heat. They stand in silence, Cas wiping the blood from his skin all while his own nose trickles out its own stream. Dean tracks the blood running past his chin, painting his lips red. Unconsciously he licks his lips and Cas eyes track the movement, before flitting back up to Dean’s eyes.
Eventually, Dean would become time and time would become Dean. Cas found himself counting the hours and days by his presence and his activity.
“Hammond. Mitch Hammond.” He hasn’t looked away from Dean once. Is this a trying to assert dominance thing? It feels like a trying to assert dominance thing he wants to say. He doesn’t.
He grips Cas by the wrist, not surprised at the slightest when there is nothing but give from his body, and pulls him away from the crowd of people swarming the condiment table. He pushes him up against the closet wall away from prying eyes.
He hands Dean back his badge and stops just before the kitchen area beside a cubicle. He chats with the woman seated at her desk for a minute, then heads straight for the back. The two officers chatting idly by the fridge quickly side-step out of the way of the Sheriff who pays them no mind. A man who is used to crowds parting for him.
Dean fills up a large black mug about as much as he can without having to make another pot. He doesn’t know these people, plus, they’re cops, he’s not making them fucking coffee.
Sam drops down beside him, two small plates in his hands and hands one over to him. “This one is uh” he lifts it up, “peach. I think, yeah peach. And that one's strawberry.”
They sit in relative silence as they both enjoy their food. Cas keeps making these small happy chewing noises every time he takes a bite of something he likes and all Dean can do is just continue to shovel food into his own mouth so he doesn’t have to think of all the ways he can keep hearing those noises.
“FBI? What the hell’s a fed doing all the way down here?” He doesn’t wait for a response and takes the badge with him as he opens the hallway door and walks down the corridor, he doesn’t turn around to see if Dean is following him. Dean makes a face and hopes Riley isn’t looking over to see it.
It’s unnerving, being back to work. He hadn’t really thought about it when Sam called him with the case, or when he was going over the initial reports of Harry’s death himself. There has always been something looming over the next exit, a big bad that was sure to end the world until there wasn’t. Until now. It’s been almost four months since they stopped the end of the world so why does it feel like it still happened, why it still feels like there’s something dark festering, waiting for him. He barely remembers how to behave, how to
him and Marnie, and Dean catches her eyes and a chill runs through his entire body. When he blinks, she's turned back to her friends and Marnie's pushing herself up from the booth, “Sorry for bothering you, It’s nothing, I think I’m just overreacting.” She's back behind the front counter before Dean can even react. His card sits untouched on the table.
But it’s him. It’s not Jimmy, it’s Cas, his eyes are bright, he looks worried, a bit sad, maybe forlorn, and his skin is tanned and he looks so incredibly good and alive. Very alive.
Dean clears his throat, “Yeah.” He downs the rest of his coffee, his stomach suddenly too squeamish for anything else. “Anything strange going on before he disappeared? Was he acting differently? Anything you can think of.”
Dean furrows his brow, Cas’ smile doesn’t reach his eyes, his skin is tight around it like it’s forced. He isn’t looking at him now, well, he is, his blue eyes still as bright as he remembers to stare back at him but he’s not really looking, he’s somewhere else.
He wipes a sweaty palm over atop the mattress and takes a breath. It takes a second to remember where he is.
And what’s he supposed to do with that, how’s he supposed to swallow that down. “Cas-” He wraps an arm around Cas’ waist, “I love you so much, so much I don’t know what I’m supposed to do with it all, I want you to have it; I want to give it to you but I don’t know how.”
They sit in silence until both their plates are empty, Cas hasn’t touched his eggs, just poked at them until the yoke bled.
Dean hasn’t moved from where he stands by the couch. “You’re leaving? I mean— you can if you want I guess, I— yeah you can do whatever you want, I can’t stop you, I just. Sorry about the one bed man.” He isn’t looking at him and he’s fidgeting with his hands, which Cas knows is never a good sign.
He pulls Dean close, their foreheads touching, and whispers “I’ll have you, if you’ll have me.” And Dean has to close his eyes at the weight of it. He doesn’t know how familiar Cas is with wedding vows, so he doesn’t say a thing; keeps this for himself, locked away in the chamber of his heart.
“Uncomfortable around death?” She offers. She takes the glass and swings it around in her hand, the liquid sloshes back and forth but never tips out. The glass from Dean’s own pint clinks like ice against the glass.
The door creaks on its hinges from overuse, the floor sticks under his boots as he walks across it. It’s gritty and underlit, but he can make out the polaroid photos on the wall to his right over top the rows of booths. The posters, paraphernalia and neon signs over the rest of the walls, The bar itself is situated right in the middle of the large room, an oval like shape with bar stools situated around the whole of it.
It takes a minute, to remember how to breathe, to remember that he's here in a bar and not sitting on a dungeon floor with his words cutting divots into the length of his throat. He doesn’t know why he’s opening his mouth, maybe it’s because she’s a stranger in a small town he’ll forget about once he leaves, maybe it’s because he’s tired and she’s young and pretty and she understands.
“I know I’ve hurt you in the past, and I know there’s potential for me to hurt you in the future. Do you love me anyway?”
Her smile falls. He turns back to his food, poking at the eggs until the yolk runs. Marnie still stands above him.
He doesn’t sleep, or if he does it changes nothing. His body is heavy, his bones crack and ache, his skin is tightly pulled and easily bruised. He never realized just how heavy exhaustion can get but he feels now, has been feeling for months. Alongside everything, it digs its hooks into the meat of his shoulder and latches on. He can’t shake it no matter how much he tries, it’s becoming a part of him.
He’s about to slip out of the blankets, to leave before Dean can when Dean reaches out across the blanket and wraps his fingers around Cas’ hand underneath the blanket.
“We gotta figure out what you like, I doubt you were able to figure it all out the last time and this is a very important task in humanity. Besides, it’s not wasteful, we’re gonna finish them all, the cups here are fucking tiny.”
“Yeah, the file I asked for.” He bites back. He holds in a sigh. Exhaustion washes over him. It’s only 11 am.
She smiles again, so sweetly it makes his stomach turn, "No problem, I'll be right back." And with that, she's gone, and Dean's left alone.
Dean doesn’t say anything, not trusting himself not to start crying again, just fits his mouth to Cas’ again and hopes it conveys,
“I’m not an Angel.” He knows Dean didn't mean any harm by it, but it still digs into his skin, so fragile now, susceptible to all sorts of damage—Dean's words, too apparently.
The chill bites at his skin and pulls his arms across his chest as he crosses the parking lot. If his coat is barely enough to keep the cold out, Cas’ coat most likely does absolutely nothing for him in this weather.
He thinks about everything, about Cas in that room surrounded by a ring of fire, and how he looked sitting across from him dressed in white, trying to play Sorry. He thinks about finding him in Purgatory the first time He thinks about watching him walk out of the bunker and reconciling in Purgatory the second time. He thinks about how he's loved him through each one, how he’s loved him before they even happened, and will love him when they’ve shrunk to distant memories in his mind. He’s loved him since he met him, and he’ll love him until he kicks it, and even after.
He coughs, “Yeah, uh” and tries to reorient himself, he quickly scans the menu like he hasn’t been in a hundred diners like this one like he doesn’t know exactly what kind of drinks they offer and that all he wants is a cup of coffee. Beside him, Marnie lets out a small laugh with a raised eyebrow.
There’s a spot in their backyard, beside Cas’ garden, behind the two trees where their hammock lies, where Cas sits on the mornings where he can’t tell what’s real.
The dust settles. He feels his heart remember how to beat, it’s reason to pressed up against him like a lifeline.
The pie slips between his legs onto the bench and then onto the dry, cracked pavement of the street. His pants are caked in strawberry pie filling and Sam’s still yammering about something in his ear.
Sam scoffs, “Yeah, like I was leaving you alone after last time.” His tone is light and joking but they both know he’s anything but.
Behind him the door swings open and a small group of women barrel their way through the diner to the empty booth he saw them in yesterday. He sees the woman from yesterday too, leading them across the floor. How did he miss how friggin' pregnant she looked?
so badly, but he can’t bring himself to do it. How can he take what he wants when every time he’s ever
He plasters on a smile. "Course, Sherriff. I don't want there to be anything going on here as much as you do."
something he's beginning to notice is a regular thing, and leans forward, “It was, it was so strange. Harry, he’s usually a nice guy, never says anything too mean unless he’s
Baby’s engine hums softly as Sam pulls into the patch of rocky dirt squared off with ropes and pylons to allocate a parking lot, and shifts her into park.
“Cas…” He can barely hear his own voice over the sounds of his blood rushing in his ears. His heart hasn’t stopped hammering against his ribs since he first noticed Cas on the couch, Cas’ hands are sweaty. He’s sweating.
“The earth it keeps on spinning or however that line goes. People find comfort in that I think, the fact that it all continues on, people, life. I might too someday. Not today though.”
He wants to tend his wounds, he wants to stop the incessant hunger that rips its way though his body, he wants the fabric of his clothing to stop touching his skin in a way that makes him feel like his flesh is burning off and his hair to stay out of his face. He wants his grace back so he doesn’t
Jack will roll himself over the lumps under the covers that are his and Dean’s bodies, he’ll crawl up into the space between them, making room for himself as he and Dean blink themselves awake. He isn’t patient, he doesn’t wait long before whispering in their ears that he’s hungry, that he would like for them to wake up now because it’s the weekend, or it’s a field-trip day, or Sam and Eileen are coming over later today. It doesn’t matter really though, Jack finds little holidays in small matters such as these and imparts his joy and beauty of the day on both him and Dean in the early hours of the morning.
“Cas?” That stare terrifies him, sends his blood cold underneath his skin, his stomach tightens. He pulls at Cas’ hands hoping it pulls him back, he’s been that before, a tether to reality, he can do it again, he’ll do anything if it means Cas can sit next to him, be with him again, and again. That thought should terrify him,
“Fuck, Cas.” He groans. A trail of spit connects them, and Dean licks his lips to break it, trying to taste Cas on them. Yeah, they should stop before Dean fucking creams in his jeans, and by the sound of Cas' voice, he's not too far off from that conclusion either.
Dean will be awake to get Jack up and make him breakfast and get him to school before Cas has even flirted with the idea of consciousness.
But one look at Dean, standing in front of him, looking at him, he realizes (maybe for the first time) it’s still there, all of it. The stars, the galaxy, entire solar systems exist in the space between them.
“What?” Dean’s body tenses, Cas can see the tendons in his neck sticking out against the skin. His fingers are curling into his palms.
“You could probably just take that if you wanted, I don’t think they’re gonna miss it.” He whispers, knocking into Cas’ shoulder as he walks up to him.
He’s lying. Dean knows he’s lying, he’s seen it happen enough times over the last decade to know. He wants to push, to make Cas spill but from his reaction in the motel room to the obvious discomfort he’s feeling now, Dean can’t bring himself to try.
. When he looks up he finds himself struggling with where to look—either the red and kiss-swollen lips, where Dean’s blood and his blood are spread out, where blood drips from his own nose as well—or his eyes, the last time he saw were swimming in tears, the last time he saw they were saying good-bye, but now he looks at Dean, not in finality, but with something akin to hope, and even love; only slightly overpowered by the sheer uncertainty and disbelief painted all over the rest of his face.
Here he’ll make his way across the cold floor where Dean’s tools are littered until he comes up beside him. Dean is always so tense when he’s like this, his shoulders hunched, the lines of his face deep and unrelenting. They don’t loosen up altogether when he touches him, but he finds a softness in his eyes, in the way he lets him touch him. It’s a gentle touch, as not to startle him, a touch to let him know that Cas is still here with him.
When Cas slides the magazine back into its place on the rack and turns towards the door, Dean picks it back up and slides it into his own inner jacket pocket.
She drops a cup of water, with ice, on another coaster from her apron and places a pitcher beside it. "Looked like you might be needing a few glasses— rough night?"
“Yeah, yeah whatever. I know that, just be careful.” He agrees resolutely and pushes past him to get outside. He’s back for only a few fucking hours and he’s already bleeding.
They stay seated on the bench, Sam in the middle, Cas and Jack on the left, and Dean on the right, turned towards them. The metal armrest digs into the small of his back and his knee is aching from kneeling over to wipe Jack up, but sitting here with everyone he loves, everyone he loves
Those nights, when Cas has finished reading Jack a story and has tucked him in, when Dean’s making his way upstairs, clicking all the lights off as he goes, the only lights left on the lamps on both sides of Cas and Dean’s bed, Cas will meet Dean in the middle of the mattress and remind him how much Cas needs him, and how much he’s loved.
The door opens, he catches his head before he falls forward, and Cas stands in front of him, bathed in the yellow of the bathroom light. Water drips from his forehead, his cheeks. Dean wants to wipe them off with the sleeve of his shirt. Cas reaches out and holds onto Dean’s elbow, his hands are still wet.
Dean places his mug of coffee on the armrest and pulls out a small white notepad from his interior jacket. He pulls a pen from Hammond’s desk, ignoring his look of disbelief. “You know Harry well?”
Marnie sighs, “We got the fountain soda’s Sprite, Coke, Fruitopia, Root-beer, Fanta, and Iced-tea. Chocolate, strawberry, vanilla milkshakes. Chocolate, white, and strawberry milk, orange juice, apple juice, and lemonade. Plus ya’ know, water, tea, and coffee.”
“I couldn’t... I couldn't face you, Dean, not after what I said. I was… I believed you wouldn’t want to see me after what I did to you, after what I
He pulls into the first liquor store he drives past, he doesn’t remember going in or buying anything but when he pulls into the motel parking lot there’s a brown paper bag in the passenger seat.
He can still feel the blood oozing, it’s hot on his cooling skin. It trickles down his chest, slowly, like it has nowhere else to be like it’s also waiting for something; waiting for him to bleed out maybe, or for him to reach down and scoop it all into his hands, try to shove it back inside, try to re-patch and repair. He knows he can’t because he’ll only make a mess of it.
to want to but everything's so grey and muddled, it's all so muted. He'd hate to sound like an emo-ass teenager, but sometimes they're right, and right now, nothing
The bedroom chills him when he enters with nothing but a towel around his waist. Dean is sitting on the couch, the TV is on but he’s not watching it, his head in his hands, which sit atop his knees, deep in thought..
He picks up a stray piece of glass and rolls it around his uninjured hand, watching as the light reflects back against it. “He was my best friend, my only friend and he died, t-to save me. He, before he um. He told me, told me that he lo-," he tries, he does, to get it out, to make himself say it; but it's like his tongue doesn't recgonzie the words, his lips don't know how to form around them— he just can't. "And then he.” He’s shaking now, the table shakes under his arms, his thighs are jittering across the leather seats.
The silence is suffocating as Cas watches Dean pick and pull at the blankets below them, he doesn’t want Dean’s answer. He doesn’t want to hear about responsibility, about guilt, about family. They’ve done this for years. He’s so tired of it all. And yet, he needs it. He needs Dean’s voice in his ears, his careful touch, even his guilt and his shame and his hate; no matter what it is, good or bad, it’s for him, and selfishly, he takes it all.
“The keys to the car? I left my sleeping bag in there, I would like to retrieve it before I head back to— before I leave.” He stutters, another thing he finds himself doing recently, and frequently too. Before, his grace was almost like a buffer, to put it bluntly, allowing him to flow through his vessel, for language to move without fault. Now he finds himself tripping over his own tongue, heavy in his mouth.
no tw/cw this chapter just mentions of blood but nothing crazy just small amounts like bloody knuckles or a paper-cut.
“Wait-- Dean, just wait.” He pleads out into the darkness, he feels weak and pathetic and everything Dean most likely thinks of him as well but if he is honest to himself, he needs this, needs Dean in the same bed as him even if they aren’t touching, needs them to be in the same room, sharing the same air. This will all be gone in the morning when the sunlight streams through that broken blind, Dean will be awake and out of bed and Cas will be alone in this bed like it all never happened, then Dean will leave and Cas will have to remember what it means to be alone, though he’s been almost lonely this entire time.
Dean just stares at him, then blinks over at the bed. The blush is back and it’s crawling slowly up his neck. Cas is about to take it back, to blame the exhaustion or the blood loss but then Dean’s body relaxes.
these small and incandescent things. He wants the feeling of infinity back inside this vessel that’s taken him prisoner, he
He lets Sam take the Impala home, and they part ways in the parking lot, Sam citing he wants to get back before Eileen gets back from her hunt. Dean pulls him into a hug, hoping it not only conveys a thank you for putting up with him these last few months but a thank you for dragging him out of the house today. He's going to be paying him back for this one for quite some time.
Dean sits down beside him, coffee in hand, (he always has coffee for him in the mornings, that’s a way of loving, Cas thinks), he doesn’t crouch to avoid the dirt or mud patches if it’s rained, just sits right beside Cas, trying to get as close as possible because he knows that even if he won’t say it, having Dean beside him, breathing, living, looking back at him, is all he needs.
“Sheriff.” Dean holds out his hand, the Sheriff’s grip is calloused like his own and tight bordering on painful.
. He doesn’t have to thumb through old photos on his phone or pull out the couple he has stashed away in his wallet, carefully running his fingers over the creased photographs or blurry images. Three months is a long time to go without hearing someone breathe, or see their smile form and drop not just as something stagnant, something unmoving.
the swirly chair turned away, a dark liquid, coffee, drips off the edge of the desk and from below the computer keyboard that takes up most of the desk space. He looks at the door closed to the corridor to his right but sees no one. He hears the distant sounds of typing, of chattering coming from behind the door where he assumes the rest of the precinct is laid out. Behind the desk is an open door, behind which he hears shuffling and mumbled curses.
He always smells like coffee and old leather, and whatever he made Jack for breakfast. He’ll wrap an arm around his shoulder and pull him in closer, Dean will place a kiss on the top of his head-- he does that a lot, Cas loves it. Then, he’ll tell him it’s time to get up. Cas hates mornings, but he loves them too.
“Ol’ Nora ain’t too fond of this here place, blames these floorboards for Harry’s bountiful transgressions, if you’re understanding.” He is. George tells him how Harry wasn’t a bad guy per se, just made absolutely terrible choices. He isn’t sure if that’s a contradiction or not. He wonders if any of Harry’s girlfriends are here tonight.
But what could he have done when all the air from his lungs and all the warmth from his body had been pulled out from the hole in his chest. Carved open by Cas’ own hands, as he reached inside him and tugged, and pulled, and loosened every nerve and muscle he had spent his life hardening trying to get as his heart.
“I can’t..” He mumbles, looking at Dean almost incredulously, “You want to be with me?” He asks, eyes comically wide in such disbelief that it almost breaks his heart all over again.
Her appearance is like the flick of a switch, he feels it, the change from the inward gnawing at himself written plain on his face in the seclusion of the empty front office, to the placated smile and loose limbs that drape themselves over the top of the desk.
Dean drops a kiss at the hollow of his throat, “These things happen alright, and after everything we’ve been through we’re entitled to some bad days. We’ll deal with them like we always do: together and well,” he smiles against Cas’ chest, “the rest is just gravy.”
His chest tightens as Dean looks at him with pleading eyes, in no world, or time would he have ever imagined Dean would ask this of him. His grip crushes his fingers, turning the tips of his fingers white-- almost as if Dean would keep him here no matter what his answer was. It’s a welcoming thought. He can almost imagine Dean wanting to keep him in the way Cas wants to keep him.
Cas seemingly waits until Marnie's out of earshot until he speaks, coming back online. “Dean, why would you do that? That’s so wasteful.”
He’s not even sure what he’s waiting for exactly… maybe for the pounding on the dungeon door to quiet, (is it pounding? Is it coming from the door?) maybe for the voices to simmer into whispers (is it voices, or just one voice layered over itself, repeating the same words over and over and--)
Cas smiles “I splashed water on your face yes, and helped you brush your teeth before putting you into the bed.” Dean feels the heat rising in his cheeks as his face heats up. “I also wrapped up your hand, it was bleeding all over the bathroom floor.”
He swings on his heels to face the door. It’s always hard to leave him, but he knows it’s easier for Dean when he’s gone, and that’s what makes it possible: the fact that Dean will be better off without him. But before he can remember that he needs to use the door, that he can’t just disappear no matter how much he wants to, there’s a hand on his shoulder. Then, Dean is spinning him back around. “Jesus, Cas, just.” He grabs the bag from Cas’ hand and tosses it onto the mattress. “Shut up.”
He isn’t noticed as she drops the paper towels onto the keyboard, she looks at her mug like she doesn’t know why she’s still carrying it and sets it down. She’s mumbling under her breath, cleaning up her mess, her face comically scrunched up through her argument with herself.
His chest lurches, he feels all the blood drain from his face like someone stuck a needle in his cheek and just
Dean reaches between them, grasping Cas’ uninjured hand like a lifeline.“Can you just stay tonight? You can hate me all you want but just please, stay.” It’s almost like a prayer, the way Dean speaks to him sometimes.
He rubs his hands together trying desperately not to admit how much he’s looking forward to Cas’ first human meal in years. He nods again. He can do this right this time, make being human not fucking terrible. Cas isn’t gonna know what hit him, and he’ll stay because Dean’s going to make sure he does. “Okay great. I’m gonna…”
Marriage problems. If he’s still thinking magic, that’s definitely a source of motive. He should check out Nora as soon as he can, he meant to, earlier. He drove by her house on the way to the bar, not on purpose he kind of just, wound up idling outside. He didn’t even know he knew the address. The driveway and adjacent streets were lined with cars.
Outside the snow drifts along with air with the quiet push of the wind, it’s only snowing lightly, the roads will be dusted by the time leaves. He hopes no one drives by before he does though, he’s always loved the feeling of tearing up the freshly fallen snow with Baby’s tires. He watches people walk by the station. A mother and her children, a small group of teenagers. It’s so strange, he isn’t sure he’ll ever get used to it, watching people, interacting with them after everything that’s happened. They were gone. All of them and now they’re back without even knowing they had just one moment, ceased to exist. He’s waiting for that moment when it all comes back to him when it feels like he did
his skin, as everything happens outside him, not that he'd ever admitted to anything like that out loud, it's just hard. It's hard to shake himself out of shit like this. It's hard to want to.
Dean startles, “Uh, no. No, it’s okay.” He mumbles, and Cas smiles like he knew that already like he wasn't going to stop if Dean asked.
Her red hair is pulled back into a low ponytail, messily like she just tied it back to get it out of her face. There are loose strands framing her face but her head is tucked in the corner of her elbow, nestled on the tabletop.
Cas gives him a quizzical look, one that tells him how stupid he is without ever saying anything, then his eyebrows rise as he runs his tongue along the front of his teeth, slightly nodding. He turns towards the window, Dean can only see the shake of his body as he lets out a small chuckle, but he knows it’s anything but funny.
Once the blood is cleaned from his wound, Dean rips open the packet with his teeth with careful precision. He pours a bit on the cotton ball and begins carefully dabbing it on the cuts.
He gasps for breath, struggling to catch his breath. His chest aches and it’s not just the absence of his heart or his burning lungs. There’s something inside him, niggling his brain, telling him that once he catches his breath, once he stops breathing, he’ll be fine, he’ll forget and he won’t feel his chest caving in on itself. So he doesn’t because he can’t because now that it’s over, now that he’s gone there’s nothing left. He has nobody to burn for the second time, just this aching inside him that’s going to eat him from the inside and the flames slowly licking their way up his throat from where he kept them safely stoking, locked away, hidden.
“What the fuck Cas?” His skin is warm under his hands. He slams him harder against the wall. Cas sits pliant under his grip, doesn’t fight back or push Dean away, just lets him shove him around. He isn’t looking at him though, and that just makes the anger flare up even hotter.
Dean slides his hand around Cas’ elbow and pulls him back to where he left Sam. He can feel the heat of his skin on his palm and all Dean wants to do is slide his hand down his arm and interlock their fingers. He wants to hold Cas’ hand and walk down this busy street, and he wants to hold his hand while they walk up to Sam and all through whatever conversation they have. He
Marnie laughs, “It’s fine, everyone here is gonna be too drunk to care, and besides, most of them can’t shut up about Harry even when he was uh.” The woman squeezes her hand, “Well. What I’m trying to say is that if you ask them about Harry, they won’t mind.”
He remembers how Dean had laughed, slightly choked by the sobs wracking his throat, “It’s 6pm, Cas.”
“You hungry?” He asks once his breathing returns to normal and he pulls back from Cas’ embrace, quickly turning his head to wipe at the tears that had fallen before Cas can see. He watches as Cas fiddles with his body, trying to remember how to place them comfortably.
Dean hadn’t coped well with his losses and continues to fail at coping even as the months pass.  One day among the numerous days Dean had been alone he had too much to drink— something neither of them knew was possible— and Sam had found him unconscious on the floor of the library.
He remembers the first morning after the end when he woke up in a dark room and thought perhaps he hadn’t woken up at all. When he thought perhaps the warm touch of Dean’s hand on his shoulder and the smooth tenor of his voice was just another way of manipulation by the Empty.
After carefully folding his work uniform and placing them on top of the back of the toilet for him to change into tomorrow morning. He slips into Dean’s clothing. They’re just as soft as he thought they’d be. When he gets back into the room he finds Dean sitting on the bed, fiddling with his first-aid kit. Looking up, his mouth parts, his eyes roam over Cas’ body. He must look ridiculous, dressed in clothing that doesn’t belong to him, clothing that sits wide and loose on his frame.
He sighs and mutters to himself, “Doesn’t make any sense.” He leans back in his chair, looking defeated, “You can get the file from Riley back at the front desk. As for Harry, what are you looking to know?” Dean feels his body deflate with a tension he was unsure of until now, it’s always so much easier when the locals are at least open to their investigating.
“Hey little man—Woah, woah, sorry kid, let me clean you up first before you make more of a mess.” Jack pouts but doesn’t say a word while Dean takes the wet napkin that Cas pulls from the small bag beside Sam, and wipes down his face, his hands, and legs. He looks down further and sees the black and yellow crocs on his feet.
okay?” She gestures to the shattered glass at his feet and littered across the table. There’s a piece in Lila’s beer.
body, doing what it pleases even if he would much rather burrow himself under the cushions until Dean wakes him up. Most of the time this happens, he just blinks awake, no rhyme or reason, just because, but these mornings he knows it’s because he’s missing the warmth of Dean beside him and the soft and irregular breath of his snores against his pillow.
Dean nods. He drums his fingers on the bar top, not entirely sure what he should do. There was a time he would’ve felt more comfortable in a bar than anyplace else. He takes a breath and plasters on a smile, he can pretend, maybe. He’s not himself tonight, he can use that to his advantage.
“Yeah or something.” He’s still smiling but he can tell by the slight twitch of Cas’ brows that he doesn’t quite know what he means.
“Hey!” Dean turns around to the sound of Marnie’s voice, but she’s not looking over at him, she’s looking at Cas, who’s looking at Dean with an annoyed look on his face. Dean nudges him to look over towards the counter where Marnie is leaning over waving trying to get his attention.
it, it leaves him aching for the warmth of Dean’s soul reaching out for him in moments like these when Dean prays for him.
This is familiar though, pulling Cas into a hug after having thought he lost him for good. This is the only way they know how to do this. Cas never got that much practice any other way, and Dean’s heart constricts knowing that that’s his fault too.
It wasn’t until after, when Dean pulled him from the Empty, when Dean saved him, that he was told all Dean ever wanted and needed was for him to stay.
Of all the mornings where Dean wakes up first and Cas is still in bed, he has not done this. He tucks his face into the corner of his neck and plants big, wet, sloppy kisses all along the skin until he peeks an eye open and groans. He’ll throw Dean off, watch him bounce slightly on the mattress, then immediately curl into his side under the blanket.
“Alright, Mitch…” Mitch’s face darkens, right. This is going to be painful. “Sheriff Hammond. Agent Neil Perry, FBI.” He doesn’t usually go for the full name change, a last name is usually good enough but he can’t shake off the weight on his chest that makes it so he doesn’t want to be Dean Winchester, even if it’s only for a few hours at a time.
It lives here now, on the tip of his tongue, at the edge of his teeth, burrowed deep in the cave of his throat. Like a house on fire, he can feel the roof of his mouth folding in on itself, collapsing into a heap of skin and blood and bones like charred wood; suffocating him like smoke. He chokes on it as it billows its way past his lips, tears leaking from his eyes as it thickens, fills and darkens the room; he can’t see a thing, he’s blind with it. Like blood in the mouth he chokes on it, it fills his throat and lungs, he’s full of it, it’s suffocating him from the inside out and he can’t help but think:
wash over the bar, the poppy, disco beat covers up the hardened thumping of his heart against his chest as he tries his hardest to form a coherent thought.
“She never expected him to stay gone, he never even took his damn car. That’s why she filed the report in the first place, no one had seen the poor fucker.”
hate me.” He says like it's definitive, like Dean's self-worth should be reflected back on Cas' own opinion of him. Sure, being told to leave the bunker was one of the worst things he could have heard after becoming human, but he always knew there was a reason behind it— even if that reason was just Cas' uselessness. But, even then, when he found himself alone and without a home, he never hated Dean, just wished he understood him more.
Dean’s mind stutters to a halt. Questions. He knows he needs to ask him questions, knows what questions he should be asking, he’s asked them hundreds of times.
“Cas?” and like a moth, to a flame, Cas comes back to himself, he blinks and Dean is standing a lot closer than he remembers him standing. He looks down to where Dean is looking, both his right hand and left fingers and dripping in blood.
When he returns Cas is waiting patiently at the front door, flipping through a magazine, when he gets closer he sees that it’s a nature magazine, specifically about trees. He falters, if only for a second because it’s like he never left. Even though his heart hasn’t returned to it’s regular speed and he still feels only seconds from throwing up, and even though he remembers enough of the last three months to know it’s not true… a part of him holds onto it. A part of him needs to believe it even if it’s not true, otherwise, their reunion would have been fewer tears and touching and a lot more blood and screaming.
And maybe he doesn't remember, but that would be the best-case scenario, which in Dean's life, rarely ever happens. He remembers and he let Dean wipe pie from his face and Cas let him, and Cas let him touch his kid, and call him little man, and Cas let him tell him he loves him—
Cas rubs his clean fingers across the soft, worn fabric of the black t-shirt, there’s writing on it but it’s faded from age and wear, most likely a band Dean likes written across the front. The pants are red and checkered, he’s seen Dean in these quite a few times.
He nods, “I thought you didn’t feel the same, I thought I had ruined any chance at us keeping our relationship…”
She swings her legs over under the table and nods him over to the other side. “Listen, Perry. I don’t like cops and I don’t trust feds so the only reason you’re still sitting in my bar is because Harry was like a son to me alright?”
She startles back into the swirly chair but catches herself before she trips. “Just wait for a second will ya’, I’m a little busy.”
He never wears enough layers these mornings, he finds comfort in how the cold nips at his skin, at how it raises the small bumps on his arm that Dean calls goosebumps.
“I’m not so convinced the Empty won’t come back and swallow me whole any second, I don’t think I’ve ever been this happy before in my life— I never knew it could feel like this.”
"Also- when you get down to the morgue later today—the Doctor should be getting on with the autopsy—you'll see what a bunch of hooey your superiors are spoon feedin' 'ya. So it's a win-win here."
“You don’t have to-.” She blows air out of her nose in frustration, the red strands of hair that’ve escaped her ponytail move with the force. “Do that. I mean. Like, try to talk to me, like that. I’d prefer if you didn’t actually.” Her eyes are tired like George’s, like Joey’s, like his probably. He doesn’t remember his own reflection even though he knows he saw it this morning. There’s something else in the way that she looks, not in the way she looks at him, just something intrinsic in the way she carries herself, he can’t identify it.
He finds himself looking over at him more than necessary over the top of his menu, from his seat in the Impala, from beside him on the walk across the Diner’s parking lot. Just small glances. Cas hasn’t noticed, or if he did he didn’t say anything.
He tries not to let himself stare at the way Cas’ eyes dilate as he wipes the blood from his neck, pooling in the blood of his collarbones but it’s futile, too afraid to close his eyes in case Cas somehow manages to slip through his fingers one last time.
Other mornings though he’s able to pull the blanket that’s tucked too tightly against his body, off, and pull Jack in for a hug before he has to leave for school. He’ll smell like syrup and soap, and Cas will drop a kiss on the top of his head the way he likes and he’ll tell him he loves him more than anything in the world, and Jack will tell him the same.
“Agent Perry,” right, he’s not him tonight. He can do this. “Glad to see you came by.” One of her hands holds a pint of beer, the other is still holding the other woman’s hand. He looks around, no one’s looking, no one’s even said anything about it.
“Did you love him?” She asks as if it's just a small inquiry, like it's something easy to answer. She asks like what he felt, what he
He watches the hustle and bustle of the diner, the patrons digging into their meals, the movements of the waiters making their way from table to table. It's almost too much, the noise, the smells, the lights above him, but it's almost nice too if he tries his best to think of it like that. There's too much going on to get lost too much inside his own head. He doesn't usually do this alone, eating he means. There's always someone else around, be it in the Impala or in the Bunker's kitchen, or even in diner's just like this. He's not really sure how to orient himself. The booth feels too big, there's too much space it's almost suffocating. If there were someone here they'd talk about to case, about how fucking annoying the Sherriff is,
Some mornings he can’t even bring himself to look at Jack, to even touch him. Too worried he’ll fall apart under his touch, his bright eyes and soft skin will melt into the blackness beneath his fingertips. So, he keeps his distance and Dean tells Jack that “Dad’s just having a bad day today.” And Jack will nod and pretend to understand and it breaks his heart that he has to see him like this.
When he looks up and sees himself in the mirror, and for the first time in a while, he sees himself. Yeah, his hair is still a bit shaggy and his eye bags are like bruises, and his black eye still sticks out against the pale skin but his eyes; they’re not clouded, his reflection isn’t foggy or hazy. It’s clear, and he’s wearing a small smile. He finds himself reaching up and touching his mouth, the reflection shows him softly running his finger along the line of the smile.
And Cas is here and he’s letting Dean guide him through the street and he lets him kiss him and he lets him cry on his shoulder. He told him he’s here to stay and that he wants him if he can have him, but it’s still there, that fear, that voice at the back of his head telling him he shouldn't be this close to something so good, he shouldn't be touching something so beautiful and wonderful, he doesn't’ deserve this ending, he doesn’t deserve to hold Cas; and he certainly doesn’t deserve to carve himself a space in Cas’ life, to be a father to Cas’ kid after everything he’s done to him.
him, like when they were stuck in Purgatory and every night for months all Cas had in between running and fighting for his life in the dark, bloody night was Dean’s quiet pleas to please hear him, to know that Dean was looking for him, that he’d find him, that was sorry, and the even quieter there’s something I need to tell you, though years later and he’s still never told him, at least he doesn’t think he has.
Later that morning he and Dean will bump shoulders over the bathroom sink and trade minty kisses with their mouths filled with toothpaste, and they’ll get muddy while chasing Jack around the backyard, and Cas will tend his garden while Dean and Jack go looking for tadpoles in the lake.
“And now?” He asks, sliding his hands into the back pockets of Cas’ jeans. “How do you feel?” He asks, hoping Cas can’t hear the sincerity in it.
“This seat taken?” He isn’t sure why he decided he needs to talk to her, probably the fact that out of everyone here, Lila probably knew Harry the best, and that’s not something he can ignore when working a case, no matter how much he doesn’t want to watch her cry.
“If I hadn’t… If you didn’t have to leave... Would you have stayed?” His voice, shaking, laced with heat, with want.
“Huh?” Cas looks up from where he’s peeling back the band-aid from his skin, Dean has to stop himself from slapping his hands away from it, tell him to leave it alone.
The room is quiet save for their breaths, Dean’s beating heart and the blood rushing in his ears. His voice breaks as he speaks thought it’s barely above a whisper, said only for himself. Cas’ face is soft under his fingers, pliant but solid. He doesn’t think he’s blinked yet, but Cas hasn’t either. He’s looking at him like he’s always looked at him, he looks tired, there’s a crust of sleep in the corner of his eye, a drip of drool hanging on the side of his lip. Dean thinks he’s never looked better.
“I-.” His throat tightens, “Sorry. Fuck, Damn it. Are you okay?” It's the woman from the bar-- though this time her cold dark eyes don't throw a chill throughout his body, they just pull up a feeling he'd rather like to ignore for tonight
She doesn’t even blink at Cas just turns back towards Dean. “A coffee and a water? Got it.” She smiles and leaves. Dean blinks, “Wait.” She turns back around.
anything Dean, this isn’t about that, I know you’re hurting, I know how much pain it causes you to see a friend in trouble and thinking you’re the one who caused it or made it worse, or whatever it is that’s digging itself into your brain. I promise you, whatever the reason is or was that I couldn’t stay in the bunker, I understand.”
He nods and takes a sip of his now lukewarm beer. The woman across the bar hasn’t moved. “Who’s that?” George looks over to where he’s pointing. Her mouth turns up slightly.
Dean digs his fingers into Cas’ shoulder, “Yes now. Yes, always. No matter what, I’m always going to trust you. Cas, you’re my best friend...and I.. I need you okay? I just, I just can’t have you at the bunker right now. But, soon everything will be okay, it’ll be better and I’ll come down here and get you and we’ll get you all settled at home, because...it is.. It’s your home okay. You have a place there, at the bunker, with me. Just--”
“Yeah Cas, ‘course I am.” He doesn't know what this means exactly, where this leaves them but he wants, so he's going to try and let himself have.
He leans over the top of the desk, her glasses slip down the ridge of her nose, she doesn’t look any older than twenty. She doesn’t answer him. He takes a seat in the small sitting room beside the large front windows. He doesn't know how long he sits there, long enough for his ass to ache, long enough for him to pick all the freshly healed skin off his thumb. It doesn't bleed, but it stings like a bitch. He wipes the dead skin off his dress pants onto the floor.
the yellow foam showing beneath it. He rubs his finger along the tears and wrinkles of the leather. There’s an urge to poke at it but he has enough mind to know he hates the feeling of it on his skin.
Cas seems to take everything in, eyes flitting from table to table, to the kitchen in the back, to the waiters all running around. Dean wants to reach out and touch him, to soothe him, to let him know whatever’s going through his head is probably human and normal. But they’re out in the open right now, not behind the closed door of his motel room and this is something he can’t do.
His hand is still moving, still taking notes so, “Was there anything strange about the crime scene that I won’t find in any of the reports. Maybe someone smelt something strange, heard a strange noise, anything really?” Everything’s the same, it always is, he recites the questions like they’re seared into the back of his eyelids and waits for the lovely and well-thought-out answer he’s sure to receive.
He looks up at the bell that chimes as his still shaking hands push the door open. He makes sure to knock any residual snow off his shoes before walking through the door, the woman behind the counter sizes him up, an occupational hazard, (fictional occupational hazard?) but she smiles thankfully at him when she notices him looking back at her
He wakes and he makes his way downstairs and outside until he’s standing right outside the garage where Dean works hidden beneath Baby’s hood.
He closes the door behind him and shuts his eyes, letting out a shaky breath. He feels everything now, the ache in his knuckles, the tight pull of his back against the wood of the door.
There’s movement beside him, the truck door opening and closing, he assumes it’s Cas putting Jack in the back, then he’s back, like in the alleyway, he’s back and he’s touching Dean in a way to calm him down and he wants it to work, he doesn’t want to feel like this anymore, but he doesn't want Cas' reassuring touches, he doesn't deserve them.
When he looks up Cas is standing there, reciting his speech. It’s practiced, it’s deliberate, meant to cut right down to the bone, to flay the skin off his skeleton to lay him bare for only him to see, for him to know
Hammond nods, mouth full of yogurt. “Like nobody’s business. Ask anyone they’ll tell you the same.” He finishes skimming the file and places it on the other stack of files adjacent to him, significantly smaller than the other.
Marnie returns with about a dozen cups filled with multi-coloured liquids and carefully sets them down on the table. Dean orders a plate of waffles with a side of bacon and helps Cas decide on the breakfast special.
“Hey, I’m— thanks for the information 'bout Harry I-, I’m. I’m heading out. Give me a call if you think of anything.” He doesn’t know if he says it all clearly, or if he gets the words out at all. Did he even give her his number?
He can’t though, so he lets out a shaky sigh and nods, slowly letting his eyes open until all he sees is Dean, and the small smile making its way across his cheeks. “Hey, handsome.”
Lila’s words hook themselves deep into his skin, into already open wounds that he’s barely let heal. Is there something on his face? She said something about his eyes, is his suffering that obvious? He hadn’t meant it to be, he’s trying to... he’s trying to be better. right? That’s why he’s here in the first place.
It’s not until they’re inside Baby waiting for her to warm up when Cas speaks up again, “Marnie gave me a paper-cut trying to hand me a card with her number on it.” He picks at the fabric of the band-aid.
“Dean.” He reaffirms his grip on Cas’ hand as he begins to pull away, he doesn’t get to leave, not again but now he can, he can do whatever he wants now and at every given moment Cas has always left. Cas is here and he’s human and he’s alive and Dean should pull him tight against his chest and tell him he won’t let him go like last time, like every time.
He nods. He isn’t able to count each of Dean’s blinks now that he blinks himself. He’s closer than he has been in a while and yet he finds it hard to notice all the freckles he used to be able to count with his eyes closed. He can’t even bring himself to look at Dean long enough to try, the heaviness of his gaze weighs on him harder now.
“This is only my second case alone.” He doesn’t know why he says that, he doesn’t want Cas to know what he was like before, what Sam had to deal with. He shouldn’t have said anything now Cas is going to ask and he’s either going to have to lie or he’s going to have to nut up and be honest.
It’s still dark, he can’t quite see perfectly but the feeling of Dean’s lips on his own is unlike anything he’s ever felt in his entire existence. He thought he saw creation in the space between them, in the gentle way they held each other's gaze, in the soft touches Dean afforded to him; but here, pressing his lips against Dean's, he feels the heat of the Big Bang, there's something building inside him, something pressurized, and everything but him and Dean are collateral damage.
“I hate you for leaving me,” is the last thing he hears himself say before he meets the cool wet ceramic of the bathroom tile.
“Sam, you just gonna let him get pie all over himself? Give the man a napkin.” He complains, slipping out of Cas’ grip and taking the pie from Jack’s lap. For a second it looks like he’s going to cry, his face crumples, and he makes grabby hands for the plate now in Sam’s hand; but the waterworks never come,
Cas tenses and violently tears his hand from Dean’s. His shoulders are rigged, his body moves almost robotically as he pushes up and away from both Dean and the couch, stalking towards the bathroom. He doesn’t say anything else before the bathroom door is slammed shut, the walls vibrate with the force of it.
He doesn’t know how long he holds onto for but Cas doesn’t move to pull away either. He ducks his head into the space between Dean’s neck and his shoulder, his breath hot on his skin. Dean’s own breath is wet with tears, his chest heaves up and down as they both pull each other closer, there has to be a way to get closer.
“There’s a bunch of different ways to cook ‘em we can figure out if you like any when we—.” He stops himself. He can’t say
The blood pounds in his ears, he can feel it reverberating agains his skull. His chest and throat are tight, he’s light-headed, choking on his own breath. He reaches up over the bowl of the sink to turn knob, his hands shake violently, he can’t get a good grip on the plastic-covering, he just needs, he just needs to. He grasps at it, desperately, a rush of anger, of embarrassment floods his chest he’s barely able to close his hands into a fist before he turns and drives his fist into the wood panels of the wall. His eyes roll back into his head at the pain, his vision cuts white. He barely makes it the toilet in time before
Dean's body tenses up, he feels himself nod. His throat is suddenly all too dry for his conversation. He clears his throat and hopes his voice doesn't give away any of his obvious strain. He tightens his grip on the cloth. “For my case uh, was Harry acting strange before he went missing? George said him and the wife were having problems but anything really stand out to ‘ya?”
“So you're here because you missed me?” He asks, letting out a breath out of his nose in disbelief that quickly dies out at the serious look on Cas’ face.
Cas loves him and he still left and it hurt and he can admit that he didn’t know what to do or how to keep going after that night— but Cas is back and it hurts, a different kind of hurt, a hurt that he knows means
Dean finds himself comforted by her words as if he’s the grieving lover in the bar where they met instead of her, “To be honest I, I actually get that.” things continue to happen, they happen and they happen and nothing stops them, they keep happening.
“Hello, Dean. Good morning.” He had said, his voice was hoarse with sleep and misuse. Dean had looked so tired, his skin was pale, under eyes dark. There was a cut on his chin, marked red with a healing scab, he was as beautiful as the day he pulled him from hell, as beautiful as the day he left him. The freckles across his skin still marked out all of his favourite stars, his eyes wrought with tears and looking at him through wet lashes.
Now Dean is leaving and everything, everything is crumbling down around him. He thought he could make it work, he did make it work, it was
“Sorry for the outburst, I’m just. I’m tired. I think I want to have a shower, so excuse me.” There will be time for this conversation, but now isn't it. The stars are too bright and the heat too much to bare, he needs to remember that it isn't always like this, that when Dean goes, so does everything else.
Cas reaches up Dean's chest, past where he's closed his eyes, and runs his fingers through the short hair on Dean’s head, still slightly damp from his shower. “Would you have asked me to?”
It’s as if Cas is putting his everything into it for the same reason as Dean—as if they’re both worried this will be the only time they’ll be able to touch each other. He would give anything for that not to be the case, but it’s been months, and though Cas kisses back with a fervour to be reckoned with, he still can’t be sure of his intentions. And that’s just it isn’t it?
The door of the motel room shuts behind him. The click of the lock sliding into place echoes as the silence from the car ride carries over into the small shared space Dean’s brought them for the night.
“We tried we did, but... neither of you answered.” He takes a breath, god his head hurts. “I deserve it. All of it. This. I-we. I waited after. I didn’t deserve to have him back.” Is he making sense, he hopes he’s making sense.
He spent a decade of his life trying to be useful to Dean, spent a decade messing things up and making things worse, and now in their new life, he still can’t do it right. There’s a crack in his chassis but that’s not what this is, that crack brought him, love, it brought him Dean, this, this thing inside him, the Empty, it’s dark and brooding; it swallows him up whole sometimes. It’s ruining him.
He never really let himself imagine what it would be like to see Cas again after the first few failed attempts at a rescue. It’s all he had at first, imagining the Empty opening back up and Cas stepping out. He had run it over in his mind over and over and over as he poured over books for days without rest. He thought about what he might do, pull him close and hug him tight against his chest, some days when his anger won out against his grief he would imagine knocking Cas up against the closest wall as soon as he saw him and screaming at him, sometimes he thought about greeting him with a fist to the face. . But after the botched spells and summonings, the failed prayers, Dean buried all those thoughts pretty quickly. The idea of hope was just another weight on his chest, eating at him.
“Fuck, Cas. I can’t— I’m ruining this already, I can’t even fucking put our kid in his goddamn carseat without freaking the hell out.”
She must sense his anguish, "Lets go grab us a couple of fresh drinks, alright?" He thinks he says something in response, maybe he nods he isn't sure. All of a sudden it's like the bar is covered in a thin grey fog. He rubs his uninjured hand over his face, rubbing over his eyes but when he drops it back to his side, he still can't see clearly.
“Oh god, you’re bleeding.” She rushes up out of her seat, her own melancholy temporarily forgotten and takes his hand between her own. He wants to pull away, the contact is not something he has the stomach for nowadays but he grits his teeth through it. She’s right though, about the blood. A thick red line of blood drips down his left palm, the skin sliced through cleanly. It’s not deep, nothing he can’t handle but the blood is starting to get everywhere.
“You don’t deserve that man, you deserve something good, someone good. Someone who won’t do all that.”
Dean squints, “Riley or Nora?” He taps the pen against his chin, he’s using half of his remaining energy to stop himself from chewing the shit out of it.
It sticks to his skin, reminding him that even though he’s alive with his family, the Empty’s reach is always long enough. That even though he has everything he’s ever wanted, there’ll be days where he doesn’t think he has it all or days where he wants nothing more than to feel like the cold hard grasp of the Empty pulling him in. He doesn’t tell Dean about those days though, but he thinks he knows anyway.
They fall into a comfortable silence, looking at each other until Dean’s cheeks turn red from the heat of the blankets above them and Cas pulls them both out into the cooler air of their bedroom.
The words are heavy on his tongue, he doesn’t think he wants Dean to answer if he’s being honest but he was doing fine, he was figuring things out and Dean had to show up and remind him, to dredge everything back up right after he had just figured out how to live without him.
“I love you, Dean.” He whispers, not wanting to disturb the quiet peace they’ve just built up, but needing him to know, he needs to know even now. Cas can’t let him doubt for a second.
as he thinks he does. It's not that he doesn't care. He just, he can't even bring himself to try. He wants to, or maybe he just
