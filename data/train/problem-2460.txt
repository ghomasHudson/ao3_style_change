However, there is another reason that they frequent Angelo's, and it is also the reason that they are here tonight: the location is
Colleague. Friend. Best man. Partner?
"I think I might be concussed after all."
It was a good thing that John was already sitting down. Because if he hadn't been, then he might've fallen over, right about now.
Rosie. I
He had to fix this.
John, one step out the door and his sights already set on a long drive home, double-backed for one question more.
The detective whirls past them, a hurricane of cotton-cashmere blend as he bounds for the door. John doesn't have any idea what he's missed, but Donovan is jogging along after him, so he can only assume it's something they're all invited on. He hurries to his feet and after the procession, his skin already tingling with the excitement of the case.
Which was why John's anger hitched up another notch, when Oscar's answer was a slight twitch of another grin.
And he wants to prove that he can still have this. Voice or no, hurting or not, Sherlock wants--
He will remove Magnussen as a factor no matter what it takes, and it starts now.
If this goes the wrong way, if this even hints the slightest at a wrong turn, Sherlock will bolt like a startled gazelle and they can not stop him. They will not catch him.
Sherlock scoffs with his air alone. He draws a line across his throat again, turning his gaze away in disgust with himself; with this whole bloody charade.
"Approximately the quantity of the Thames." He sank gratefully into the proffered chair, his head dropped back into his hands. "Three, before I left the restaurant. After that-- file not found. I think it got dropped over a banister."
He thinks about that chart, a mile long in Sherlock's room and with months of pages still to be added.
had quite the night. Not even Sherlock couldn't require his helpermate to be bright-eyed and bushy-tailed after two straight all-nighters that culminated in a violent assault, kidnapping, and attempted murder.
The sofa in 221B is a very good sofa.
The kitchen is silent, save for the sound of Sherlock's chewing, Sherlock's pen scratching, and John's silverware.
He pictured small, soft shoulders, and long, shiny hair, a someone pretty and soft and curved and
John smiles at him, just the slightest warm, familiar crinkle. He moves forward to slot his fingers around Sherlock's, unfolding his fist, one by one. "There's nothing else here for you to do."
John is in such a dizzy rush to make it to the door, he doesn't even process what he hears going on behind him until he's a step outside, and it's almost too late.
Mycroft? That's not fair and you know it. He needs more time. You--"
Thinking things like that-- that he was a horrible person, had nothing left to live for, that the people he loved were really probably best off without him--
This kills John.
And what it boils down to is that John has barely got more than a nod or a shake of a head out of the man that he loves in over four months.
He hated this. He
It wasn't until his watch ticked to ten o'clock, the audacity of it burning a hole in John's stomach, that he gave in.
He smokes the cigarette down to ash, and grinds the stub beneath his foot.
Next time.
"John," Ella began again, her voice solemn. "I'm sure there are dozens upon dozens of reasons why Sherlock is an addict, and why he relapsed. The same is true for everyone. But, what it has to come down to, is that Sherlock made his choices. Mary did not take his autonomy from him. And you most certainly did not, either. You did not watch him use. You did not prepare the needle for him. You did not hold him down and forcibly inject it against his will." She paused to watch him closely, her words absolutely sincere and without a hint of doubt. "You know that Sherlock taking personal responsibility is very important, in him staying clean. Has he ever expressed that he blames you or Mary for his relapse?"
“Oh, John,” Sherlock breathed.
The warehouse was cold and damp and any natural light coming from the small windows near the ceiling lost its intensity by the time it reached the floor below. John was brusquely handled into an open space, his senses reduced because of the blindfold securely tied around his head. Luckily his arms were free, although his left one was in a massive grip no doubt by a large male. He knew he’d been taken somewhere near the river, for even though he had been stuffed inside a car boot, he’d learned from “experience” how to gauge and memorize directions when senses were hindered. Suddenly, an eerily familiar voice pierced the thick, pungent air around him.
John’s face was one of astonishment and confusion. “I—” he breathed, “I don’t understand.”
Mary spoke defeatedly, “I’m sorry, John. I’m so sorry … for everything.”
Suddenly, an ember popped loudly, startling John out of his reverie. As he glanced at his friend, he realized that Sherlock was still staring intently into the flames. John took another sip of his drink and set it down on a side table.
we’re talking about him,” Irene explained. Then Irene did something positively curious. “Oops, I think I dropped my contact,” she fretted as she put her hand to her eye and twisted in her chair dropping her gaze and scanning the floor area.
Sherlock looked at her puzzled.
John turned to make his way to his former bedroom, but then stopped and looked down the hallway at the closed door that separated Sherlock’s bedroom from the rest of the world. He suddenly found himself crossing the threshold and standing in the middle of it. The detective’s bedroom was the one place in the flat that was impeccably neat and John found himself wanting to consume everything in it. Somehow, even though he didn’t know where Sherlock was, standing in his bedroom made him feel closer to the man. However, exhaustion was taking over quickly, so he kicked off his shoes, lay down on the bed, pulled up the duvet and burrowed into one of the pillows, which smelled so wonderfully of Sherlock.
A few moments before, in a different part of London, in a large home, on a non-descript street, a very desperate man suddenly stopped his prowling to retrieve a text.
“Hellooooo, Dr. Watson,” James Moriarty cackled. “Such a pleasure to see you again.”
The younger man was taken aback. John was using his own deductive skills to get to the subtext that makes up most conversations. It caught Sherlock off-guard, which made John’s grin even wider.
Sherlock audibly gasped and his eyes (or at least the one that wasn’t swollen) went wide.
John’s heart began to beat a little faster. “Certain people?” he inquired. “Who?”
John let out a breath as he fought the lump in his throat that was making a repeat appearance.
As he remained captured in this unknown spell, Sherlock could feel his anxiousness rise. He wanted to tell John about his trip to his Mind Palace. He wanted John to know what he’d found. He wanted John to know what he had gone through and what he’d discovered about himself and about John. And, deep down he needed to hear the usual praise John bestowed upon him when he made a particularly brilliant deduction. But more importantly, and this was the true pinnacle of Sherlock’s enlightenment, he wanted to let John know how he felt. Not because it was best for Sherlock, but after all John had been through, Sherlock selflessly believed John deserved to know that he was loved. As he geared himself up to tell John, he realized the strangeness of it all. Sherlock had faced death and potential tragedy so many times in the past, and yet, he was finding that it took more courage and bravery in this moment to tell John his feelings than he’d ever had to garner in the past. Still, as he looked into his best friend’s eyes, Sherlock knew the three little words that conveyed the depth of his feelings … the three little words that John needed to hear.
“I believe the last time I saw you, you were at my trial … or one of them, anyway,” said Moriarty dismissively.
Sherlock held his breath.
Suddenly, a phantom-like hand clamped tightly around his wrist, jolting his body and halting the gravitational pull that was playing tug-of-war with it. Somehow his back had maneuvered toward the building, so he couldn’t see the person whose grip was tightening on his wrist like a metal handcuff. Suddenly his body was moving slightly upward, his arm feeling like it would detach from the shoulder socket at any moment. The movement continued and he found himself trying unsuccessfully to twist his hips so he could face the side of the building and perhaps grasp something with his left hand, thus aiding in his own rescue.
Sherlock gave the men a quick insincere smile, then grabbed John’s wrist and the pair retreated quickly, winding their way to the registration area. The threesome they left behind stood stock still with facial expressions so blank they’d make the Mona Lisa look emotional.
Until now, Sherlock hadn’t really been aware of the after-effects of what he had to deal with, or rather, who he had to deal with, in order to get up the stairwell and onto the roof to save John. Taking a blow to the face and a few punches to the ribs were nothing to speak of in his estimation. The adrenaline had kept the tightness and pain from manifesting themselves. However, as John now reached out to gently touch his cheek, Sherlock flinched and became acutely aware of how much his face ached.
The flat looks perfect. John's chair is still where he'd left it, that night he'd been carried off in an ambulance, impeding the path to the kitchen. The Union Jack pillow is back there, too, where it belongs. John's laptop is on the desk underneath random bits of paper and debris, turned on and halfway through proofreading a blog post, likely a perfunctory update that the hat detective is recovering well and a request to be left alone in these difficult times. His microscope is waiting in the kitchen, waiting with the acid solution Molly had dropped off at John's request, and his violin case has been dug out of the clutter to rest neatly against the wall.
"Sherlock!"
The game, it seemed, was back on.
"Milgram," he said. "Stanley Milgram. Stanley Milgram was a researcher at an American university in the sixties. Though the ethics of it have now been called into question, the validity of the results have not been, and- and you know I tend to test my theories with experiments, in which- Milgram is most famously known research into obedience to-"
"Sherlock," he says again, pointing his finger at the screen. "If you start touching my clothes, I will start touching yours. I will mismatch your posh trousers with my
"Come here," John says, "just--" and Sherlock all but collapses back into his arms. He's trembling still, too cold and pale and thin, but he takes long, unsteady breaths against John's neck, and for the first time he can feel Sherlock finally starting to calm down.
"All right," Sherlock said again. "Then... all right. If that is what you need."
Sherlock hands flutter even faster, all but overflowing with excitement. He's signing so fast John barely catches more than one or two words, and none of them build up enough to make a coherent picture.
He'd wound up abandoned halfway on the walk around the floor, thoroughly disgusted with himself and the world at large, and he hadn't been able to
John swallowed back his own scoff, looking away. And wasn't that part of the problem, then? Sherlock, while on such a cocktail of psychotropic drugs he was lucky he hadn't offed himself on a fucking stroke, had not only predicted exactly how and when Culverton Smith would attack him. He had predicted that John would abandon him there to let him do it. He had known John was going to leave him there and if it hadn't been for Mary's DVD, he wouldn't have come back. Ever.
John squeezed his stinging eyes shut. "I know. I know you don't, Sherlock. But..." He hesitated, gently rubbing his hand up and down his back again. "I don't know if you remember, but last night-- you said that you were... you said that you hated him. And that you'd still rather be with him than me."

He tends to be ignored.
It's so awkward and heartbreakingly dull, but he irons out schedules to the very last detail. He eats and sleeps and trims his nails so he can't scratch himself and Skype calls John once a day and what the hell more is he meant to do? He can't
And then, Lestrade texted him with a case.
John would say something so utterly stupid.
"So... what, then? You think I should--" His stomach knots, and can barely get the words out past the anger gathering in his throat. "--should,
Lestrade glanced up idly, barely even bothering to raise his head. His next grumble came out muffled. "You're so much more pleasant to be around when your handler is here. Where is he, again?"
"I also wanted to talk to you a little bit about Sherlock's plan," she said next.
Sherlock looks at John, an ex-army doctor that needs the chase, the battle, and to be important, having poured his heart out in an endlessly romantic, albeit mostly misguided speech, and he's feeling his hand tremor.
Sherlock's head jerked up again, all pretense at sleep discarded in an instant. He stared at John with his usual laser focus and with the man's such close proximity, John could tell that he'd all but stopped breathing.
Sherlock still won't look at him. He's unnaturally still about it, hands utterly motionless in his lap. John put two and two together a long time ago that it hurts him too much to fidget them the way he normally wants to.
and this is now. First it was the trouble of medication interactions, and John watching him like a hawk; then it was the niggling wariness that Mycroft was spying on him, and would see him slipping back into old habits and use that as an excuse to try and commit him. Then it was pride, that he is not so pathetic as to need the help, of course he's not, he doesn't need
It felt like his chest was caving in. It also felt like Oscar Wilson was in a very immediate danger of having his teeth knocked down his throat.
There's nothing else left.
John set his tea down, gently, wanting all things breakable and fragile out of his hands for this. He sat forward to meet Sherlock's eyes, his bright, bright blue eyes, even the one still ringed in fading red-yellow blood.
about what humanity has to offer. "I am not leaving until I get an answer."
It turns out that there is a limit, to how far he will go for John.
John's blind temper hitches up another notch.
John wondered if he might be able to call Mycroft back, and let him know that if Oscar Wilson showed up again, then he was just going to have to figure out how to get them another pardon for murder.
, but the genius himself hovers at the window as stock still as a statute.
" There's a rustling over the line, and then, "
"That doesn't exactly scream
Five of Sherlock's heartbeats count out the silence.
Greg frowned back in the mirror. "What, through three lanes of traffic?"
It takes a moment for John to see it, because Sherlock's still hunched over and scrawling away and refusing to look at either one of them. He sees Sherlock start on another line, then stop, hitching in a ragged breath that if John hadn't known any better would've been little more than a long inhale. He does it again, his shoulders hunched aggressively. The pen wavers in his grip, spilling a long line of blue torn across the page.
Then he spends the rest of the afternoon in conversation with Mycroft, in figuring out just what the hell they're going to do about Mary.
as if he was one wrong word away from just opening the door himself right in the middle of traffic. He'd been uncomfortable when talking about the assault, and he'd approaching upset when they'd turned to Mary. This? This was neither of those things. Sherlock wasn't distressed. This Sherlock was merely annoyed.
To his surprise, Sherlock shook his head, though he accepted the water without any grumbling. "Just nauseated.
The first time Sherlock opens his eyes, it barely counts.
But John looks at him, and he sees what's there underneath his frantic, building fury and terror.
Francis raises an eyebrow at him. Somehow, he remains distinctly more impressed by Sherlock's news than by Sherlock's reevaluation of said news, and does not seem inclined to take the time to think it over. "That's ten more words than this time last week, Scott. If you're unsatisfied with it, then you ought to try and use ten more." He pauses for a moment, almost as if he's waiting to see if Sherlock might try it right then, right there. "Have you tried what I asked you to, in the mornings?"
Sherlock opens his mouth, and Sherlock, like an idiot, says, "You."
That he is
Sherlock just got closer to finding his voice again today than John has managed to coax out of him for
"I knew he was using me," was what Sherlock said next.

"Have you... have you been
to install a lift made in this bloody century..."
John steps out of the elevator with takeaway in hand and takes a full three steps past Sherlock before finally reeling to a stop. He does a double take, staring back with wide eyes, and Sherlock only just barely has enough pride left to manage a raised hand back in answer.
Sherlock will never speak to him again. He already has not spoken to him in months.
"Donovan or I will text you what happens," Greg promises, his face strained with worry. "Come on, you lunatic,

The weeks they spend piecing Sherlock's body back together are the worst of John's life. There is no comparison, to what it feels like to know the person he loves more than anything in the world is hurt this badly, and there is
Sherlock shuffled back down into his most blatant sulk possible, and reverted to moping.
And then, something just gives.
Except the professor wasn't even looking at him.
He listened with his face still in the pillow, archiving and storing the words as John described in a long, tired monotone how he had ended up wearing a Semtex vest poolside. He'd already deduced the shape of the story on his own, and the small details were unnecessary seasonings that did nothing but confirm his own guesses.
For the third time in as many minutes, a long, very pointed, dead silence spread.
Sherlock reels to a stop, one foot already planted to pivot himself out the door.
Sherlock refuses, he flat out
"God help me," John agreed, and grinned.
"...well, I'm not sure how normal

Which was why he opened his mouth, and continued his pattern of
or perhaps John just really does know him that well, because John's smile crumples again, forlorn, like he's falling inward. But his hands around Sherlock's remains strong and he doesn't let go. "You don't believe me," he mutters, touching his face. His hands are cold but Sherlock's even colder, so somehow, it all balances out. "And I can't even blame you, after... but I promise I mean it, Sherlock. Do you have any idea how incredible you are?" He shakes his head again, as if it is one of life's great mysteries, his hand tracing over the side of his face and his hair, and for a moment he looks about to kiss him. "Do you have any idea how incredible you

Sherlock was right. John was bored. And maybe John wasn't about to start shooting the walls and asking for a nice murder, but... he wasn't exactly going to say no to one, either.
Mycroft murmurs.
and that was it, happily ever after, but that was just it. It wasn't going to happen. The fact that Sherlock was interested in men after all certainly did not mean he was interested in John.
Sherlock is spending the evening with Dr. Oscar Wilson, and how on earth he talked you into letting him."
They make it outside together, Sherlock staggering on long, trembling legs, like a nervous colt. He is in pain, with the wave of the panic attack's adrenaline now crashing, his blood sugar assuredly in the toilet, and as much as Sherlock clearly hates it and wants to pretend otherwise, he needs the help. They only somehow get down to the ground floor, and then outside after it.
"You're never busy at that insipid surgery." Sherlock stands, sweeping from his chair to kneel next to his violin instead. It's perfectly in tune, the bow with not a hair out of place, and he gives the strings a careful, familiar stroke. "Your musical literacy is also higher by an astounding amount."
John laughed again, beaming even brighter than before. "Yes, Sherlock, you do," he said, kissing the unbruised side of his forehead, then an unmatted clump of hair. "You
and he still can't speak. He is scared and all he needs to banish Mycroft out of the flat is one single word, and he still can't do it. "Rehab worked just fine for him before. He hates it at the time, and complains, but it's for his own good-- surely, you understand th--"
John securely planted both his hands on his shoulders to settle him back down into the bed, even hauling up the blanket for good measure. He looked amused rather than annoyed, but also absolutely no-nonsense about it, as if these were his orders and Sherlock was
about what Mary might've done to John is because he loves John. He needs him. John is as essential as air, is an anchor when lost at sea and is the hurricane when Sherlock is wilting and withering on land. He'd throw himself off a building for John. Obviously.
and he rasps in another breath, trying to nudge up against John's hand.
Sherlock tugs on his hand, reeling John back in. He hates it, but he has to wait, still. Wait for John to be looking at him, his eyes creased with concern and his the corner of his mouth tight the way it is when he wants to punch someone. Tight and worn and very kissable.
no. Not like this. No, he couldn't let his daughter around a using drug addict, but this wasn't fair; this wasn't Sherlock's fault. Or it was, but--
But John is okay, like this.
As horrible as that relationship had been, and as miserable as it had clearly made him, it was safe. It was safe because he knew how he'd be treated, and how it would hurt, and he knew he'd survive it because he'd survived it before.
They got back from the pool together, cold, wrapped in garish orange shock blankets, and silent, at well past one in the morning.
"Come on, it's okay." He's still gentling him, encouraging Sherlock ahead like he's a frightened animal. The hands around him are rock steady, guiding him step by step and ready to catch him if he still should fall. He's
"Right," Lestrade coughed again, clearing his throat. Sherlock wondered idly if he ought to offer a cough drop. "This is enough for now, I think. You'll need to sign your statements, both of you, but that can wait. Assuming this stays a Scotland Yard case, what with Sherlock over here trying to sell off classified information to a psychopath."
"I owe her my life," he started, suddenly raspy. "She would be here if not for me."
He kissed him again, just one more time, standing on the sidewalk with the door open and the cabbie watching them both. "Lovely," John said, smiling warmly against his mouth. He stepped back again, with one last fond squeeze of his hand. "I'll see you tomorrow, okay? To start really writing up the case."
, and that'll break the dam. Sherlock is absolutely sure of it. If he can just find a way to get one word out, to just do it
No. Sherlock shakes his head, his throat thick and his hands too heavy to sign. He had written the papers as explicitly clear as he could, because he had known where this would end. And this is not John's fault. This is not John's fault in any way.
Sherlock does not respond. He does not give any sign that he is in any way aware of John at all. He just presses back against his corner, panting in whines through clenched teeth, his blue eyes wet, blown wide, and staring at something that is not in this room.
John is already, clearly, shaping up for an argument. It's probably not a good thing for Sherlock to try and provoke a second one.
is it? Sherlock wants to call the entire thing off, let John march him home, and properly shag his brains out for the first time in a year.
They slate him down for head scans and neurology interviews next, scans to be evaluated by an increasingly overqualified panel of neurologists. John, if anyone's asking, is of the opinion that the head scans should've been the first step. It's not only spoken word. Sherlock can't
Sherlock fills up the space of the room as naturally as he always has, a spectacle that is larger than life. He bounces through the scene, his fingers fluttering to trace the gold trim of the walls, flipping out his pocket magnifier, prodding oh so gently at the remaining painting on the wall, and god, it's incredible.
He'd already tried the whole
"Found this bloke skulking around the crime scene," the officer is saying, "wouldn't say who--"
, opening his mouth, and talking?
Oscar wasn't the first time. And he hadn't been the last. Oscar was not the only relationship in his life to disintegrate because Sherlock hadn't been enough. Not good enough. Not
"You're..."
, and walked out on him and Rosie without a second thought, but hey, she hadn't tried to smack anyone around like his dad, so he should be glad for small miracles?
and what's John supposed to do? He's tense as a board and shaking, and he still can't speak if he doesn't want something or there's something that he needs, and he knows there's no way Sherlock is ready for what John wants to do. As much as John hates it, what Sherlock needs more than anything else right now is almost assuredly a moment alone.
when it mattered the most?
this was about him trying to apologise and make amends for hurting his best friend, but--
So what had Sherlock been saying yes to, exactly? Casual sex? Maybe when he'd been using? John swallowed again, now trying very hard not to think about a very differently clothed Sherlock, the hoodie and track pants figure he'd found half-asleep on a doss house's mattress with eyes so blue it should've been a crime, but this time with another nameless and faceless junkie in his arms.
He can't laugh, but it's an incredibly close thing. Sherlock shakes his head again and pushes up, his hands sliding up the strong curve of his back to again find John's face. Imbecile. John Watson is an imbecile.
"...Oscar."
"...Who was
"You've apologised. Numerous times. I don't need to hear it again." They sit again, because John makes him, and he still doesn't let him go. Now he seems almost hesitant, as if he's not sure he should say what comes next. "I think... I think I'm going to make a deduction."
He can not stand anything about this.
Mycroft raises an eyebrow. The smug look on his face is
It's not a good idea. It is, in fact, a horrible idea. Sherlock is not ready for a case. Sherlock still can't
"Sir," she stresses, "
It wasn't.
"Because I didn't have to, you tended to do it all on your own, you git." John gave his ear a gentle cuff and circled the table to join him, taking the glass of whiskey for himself. "You even interrupted my own wedding with a case, remember?"
" Sherlock snapped, voice still half-muffled into his knees, "you think she'll only measure up as second best? To yours truly, obviously."
with the great Sherlock Holmes? John had hit him. John had beaten him and told him it was his fault. John had been ready to leave him in that hospital for good and if that was the case, why the hell was he here now? Why was he
John just looks at him. He stands there and stares down at him, his eyes unreadable, and Sherlock settles himself in for what is going to be yet another tongue-lashing of a lifetime.
Don't do that!"
Ella tilted her head back, sharing with him a quietly amused look. "For any other patient that had been attacked by a serial killer, yes. And of course he didn't deserve what happened to him, and the blame only lies with Culverton Smith. But from everything you've said, it really sounds as if Sherlock intended to be attacked by that man. But John,
It is dull and tedious and boring and my head hurts and it has only been thirty-three minutes!"
"Shortcuts spell the way to failure, Sherlock," Mycroft says, when he has evidently decided the silence has gone on long enough. His words carry a distinctive and decisive air of finality, and he sets his tea down on the table with a faint
"Okay," he said.
going to kill him.
"Obviously."
"It's not a question of fault, John. It's--"
"Okay," he says.
he hadn't left it alone. He hadn't
"Look," he says. He takes a deep breath, and lifts his head up to meet his eyes. It's uncomfortable and awkward, but he has clearly spent a long time thinking this through, and has decided this is something that is Important. This is something he Has to Say. "I'm frustrated. And I feel useless. I'm not saying this to make you feel guilty, I'm saying it because it's true. It seems like nothing is getting better and I'm supposed to be doing something but I don't know what that is. I want to help, and I know you're trying, but it feels like you're... stalling. That we're getting nowhere. And that worries me. Because I know you're not happy like this, you can't possibly be, and--" He curses under his breath, suddenly aggravated. "Am I making sense? I'm not making sense, am I?"
It's an uncomfortable question, and one Sherlock doesn't particularly want to answer. It frames everything the wrong way, it paints it all as a selfless sacrifice, and it makes his skin crawl. What was he meant to do? Ruin the wedding, after he'd already ruined the proposal and the two years before it? For that matter, sit back and watch Moriarty burn the city to the ground? It doesn't make him an angel to cross swords with the devil.
Sherlock blinks again.
His room had spent a week as a bloody florist shop before John took to redirecting all such deliveries to the nurse's station. "Those files were
"I thought there wasn't going to be a next time."
"I have, you know. Had an interest."
This is a first step, and he's finally forcing himself to take it, because he is
agree to see this man again?! Sherlock must hate him!"
Several minutes passed, with nothing to break the silence but the occasional clink of his cup of tea, and the shuffle of papers between them as they searched for the figurative smoking gun.
"I know I said otherwise before, but... the only reason I was even with Mary was because of you. Most of the time I was with her, I could only think about how much I missed you. How sorry I was that you were dead. And then you came back, and- you were such a bloody
This was uncomfortable and sentimental and even more important than an apology for what he'd done to him in the morgue. "She didn't confer anything, and you don't owe her anything. Your life has value because you're you. If you're really insistent on paying her back then just fucking
They make a solid amount of progress on the case, and end up being bade to go home only when it's late enough John can tell all of Lestrade's team is begging for it. It's their Saturday, too, after all, and he can't ask them to all give it up for the sake of keeping Sherlock occupied.
“Actually, I’ve fixed the video chat function on your laptop, John. It should be all—”
John stared back, a measure of understanding briefly flashed over his features. He realized that Mary was being placed into some sort of witness protection program. Her identity and all of her dealings with Moriarty, John and the Holmes brothers would be deleted.
Sherlock stood in disbelief; his understanding of the situation gradually coming into focus. He had been outsmarted, outwitted and outplayed. He had been led down one path only to be diverted onto another. He had questioned his hearing and even his own sanity. And it was all done by an unassuming former army doctor, his flatmate, his best friend, who was standing before him now with a twinkle in his eyes and the most adorable smile on his face, and Sherlock felt as if he was melting.
“I’ve wanted to do that since the awards ceremony,” John said with a slight giggle and a smile. He reached up with his right hand and placed it on the nape of Sherlock’s neck, gently running his fingers through Sherlock’s curls. “I was also wondering if I might …
However, he knew if he didn’t attend the party, in his own flat, with his very merry flatmate, that John would be furious. But more than that, John would be disappointed. So, the detective did what he’d done numerous times in the past. He finished dressing, smoothed the lines of his shirt as he looked at himself in the mirror, and whispered, “Into battle.”
John grasped Sherlock tighter and the two of them stood holding each other for several moments, chests rising and falling in unison, eyes closed in the stillness of their home, in the temporary peacefulness that surrounded them. They were on the cusp of a new phase in their lives, facing the future as they always do nowadays … together. And for the first time in awhile, John’s thoughts weren’t tinged with sadness, but rather a spark of hope that maybe, just maybe, the best adventures were yet to come … for all three of them.
“He’s always like that. Probably deducing your life story in his head,” Irene murmured back. Then she leaned forward and waved her hand in front of Sherlock’s face, “Sherlock! Snap out of it! You’re being rude.”
But the look on the detective’s face told the story—stoic, except for his eyes, which contained an element of fright and vulnerability that John had never seen. Words. Moments before, John had silently wished for words of clarity, and suddenly he recalled a conversation that had taken place between Sherlock and him several years ago.
“I’m here to take you home,” she said.
So there he sat, tucked in his usual corner, books spread before him, typing away on his laptop and carefully turning pages, marking notes and savoring the ability to put his mind back on track. Only a handful of times did his mind wander, only slightly, to a certain muscular rugby player, and even then, something would catch his eye—a new fact online or a sentence in one of the books—and he would be back at it, following a lead.
“You have always been the most fascinating human being I’ve ever known, John,” Sherlock stated, almost resolutely. “You’re a mixture of protection and danger; peace and chaos. You’re a dichotomy. The greatest puzzle I’ve ever encountered. And the thing is, you don’t even realize it. Because it’s just who you are. And I lo—I love the whole person … you … I love you.”
As the detective made his way into the sitting room he observed that their flat was completely filled with slightly inebriated guests—family and friends—gorging themselves on delicious food and celebrating loudly with conversation and laughter. He was greeted by shouts of “It’s about time,” “Oh Sherlock, you decided to join us,” and the like.
Sherlock slowly whispered repeatedly with astonishment. Then, with sudden clarity, he looked at John and confessed, “
Silence from the other end of the call.
John strained to look up and saw a tuft of black curls protruding over the side of the roof. He garnered the rest of his strength and reached upward to grasp Sherlock’s wrist and arm. As he did so, his body swung back around to face the building and he was able to brace his feet on the bricks, spider-like, as his ascension continued. Finally, the overhanging ledge tapped John under his arms and he was able to leverage his weight as Sherlock grabbed his back and waist and scraped him over the edge, and they both fell into an ungraceful heap of blogger-detective.
“I—I thought—“ he scrabbled for a buyable explanation. “I thought there was a bug on his leg. I was going to remove it.”
They were both exhausted from the waves they’d been riding the past 72 hours, each valley a hellish descent, each peak a hope-filled respite. Moriarty was finally dead, John’s divorce was final and Sherlock and John had reunited and declared their love for one another. It was truly time for at least a kip after all they’d experienced. But nothing, not even their bodies’ craving for sleep, could stop them from wanting to explore what came next in this emotionally and mentally euphoric state in which they found themselves.
“I don’t want to wear one,” Sherlock responded anxiously, interrupting John yet again.
John stood there, staring at Mycroft, and suddenly felt extremely embarrassed for his toddler-like outburst.
Sherlock watched as John looked down bashfully and began to shift his weight back and forth between his shuffling feet. “And I was hoping … I mean if you’re available,” John stammered, “I- I know you don’t really like that sort of thing. But, um, I was thinking maybe you’d like to go … with … me?” The sentence turned from a statement to a question in a matter of seconds as John raised his face to look expectantly at his friend.
“Where did you go just now?” John asked.
Sherlock finally got his blinking under control, however, he was left to process the psychological and physiological occurrences within the last several moments, not to mention John’s misstep … or was it his own?
“For a case?” Mycroft interjected.
“I’ve arranged for you to meet with her tonight,” Mycroft instructed. “You’ll accompany me to a secure location. It’s best if you don’t know the exact area, which is why I must insist that you wear a blindfold. Although as you are no doubt a student of Sherlock Holmes, I assume you’ll figure out where we’re headed by using senses other than your sight.”
“It’s fine, Sherlock. I know Greg needed you on that case.”
Watson knew exactly what he was doing.
With a groan, Sherlock peeled off John and the doctor padded to the bathroom to clean himself. He then quickly returned with a wet, warm flannel and proceeded to lovingly clean his partner, who lay with one arm thrown over his eyes. With each wipe of the cloth, Sherlock let out an appreciative hum. Once John was satisfied, he threw the flannel somewhere in the vicinity of the discarded clothing and crawled under the sheets. Sherlock joined him and the two of them lay face to face on the pillows staring at each other.
“I love you,” John choked, as the confession left his lips.
The two men stared into one another’s red-rimmed eyes and what passed between them was deeper than any words that could have ever been spoken—forgiveness. Both of them asked for it and both of them gave it to the other. But more than that, each of them knew that from that moment forward, the past was in the past and there was total and mutual absolution--a cleansing that freed them both to live completely … and love fully.
Their hands continued slowly pumping as their lips brushed and they spoke into each other’s mouths.
Mary let out a giggle and ducked her head to hide the faint blush that was forming.
“But, she won’t
Sherlock blinked and looked at John.
“Sherlock?” John inquired.
He was jarred out of his thoughts by Sherlock sitting down across from him. The music apparently had stopped at some point and the violin had been set on the desk. In a rare moment of indulgence, Sherlock, too, took a sip of scotch, staring at the grate where a fire was radiating a good amount of heat and providing a soft glow to the sitting room. John looked from Sherlock to the fire.
Sherlock looked at her in disbelief. “But, you
John felt the weight of each of the 17 steps pulling down on him as he ascended to the hallway and stopped just outside the sitting room of 221B. Trembling, he reached out to turn the door handle, slowly. He feared what his own reaction would be upon entering, but, forever the soldier, John stiffened his jaw and carried on.
… Sherlock’s mind was in deduction mode as he lay sprawled on the sofa in the sitting room of 221B. Not too far from him, John was sitting comfortably in his own chair, silently reading something from the post. The corner of his mouth turning slightly upward and his eyes blinking slowly and softly. He then returned the pieces of stationary to the envelope,  tucked the entire parcel under some medical journals on the nearby desk, and went up to his bedroom to get ready for a pub night with Lestrade.
John was going to sacrifice his life was replaced by the truth of
Now that John’s jumper was removed, Sherlock’s hands were free to explore the front of John’s button-down. He wiped over the fabric, feeling John’s pectoral muscles, which still had some definition, despite the fact that John was a little less active than in his rugby days. He continued his exploration, sliding both hands down the sides of John’s rib cage, to which the older man squirmed a little. Sherlock then made his way back up to the small patch of skin revealing itself at the top of the shirt. Slowly, Sherlock’s hands began to work to undo the first button and John caught his breath, momentarily halting the kiss. John panted into Sherlock’s mouth, trying to manage his breathing as he grasped the detective’s waist tightly.
Sherlock began to thrust quickly and repeatedly, completely engorged now, on the edge of release.
“Are you sure?”
“Comfortable,” came the murmur.
Just then Sherlock opened the door, water droplets hanging precariously from his dark, curly mop. “I need to borrow your hair dryer,” he stated, as his sentence mingled with the end of John’s.
“You’ll have 10 minutes to say your farewells before I return to gather your signatures on the divorce documents,” Mycroft continued. “After that, you’ll be led back to the car and return to Baker Street to wait for further instruction.”
“But that doesn’t mean that he won’t be later,” she finished. “He and your brother had some business to attend to first.”
John couldn’t help but giggle at that, as he caressed Sherlock’s cheek and shared a smile with the man he loved.
“Well, … I’m not married anymore,” he blurted out, not really sure why he felt the need to proclaim it, but somehow finding relief that he did.
Sherlock’s brain was in overdrive as every swipe of John’s thumb on his hand was like an electric shock up his arm. He had been touched in gentle ways before; after all, there was Janine. But he’d never been touched like that by John. And that factor above all else made this new and exciting. Sherlock mentally vowed right then and there that even if it took the rest of his life, this was worth continued investigation.
John was just outside the door asking him to make up his mind from which restaurant they were going to order dinner.
Sherlock was so wrapped up in his mind palace that he didn’t even hear John say “good-bye” and leave the flat.
But before John could reach him, two large hands were clenching his arms in a bone-crushing grip, holding him back from a now-smirking consulting criminal.
people leave, I could …
John couldn’t take his eyes off Sherlock, and Sherlock’s reciprocating stare felt to John like it was penetrating his soul. John noticed that a small bruise was starting to form on the side of Sherlock’s face. No doubt a result of a shared deduction that hadn’t been appreciated. Both men tried to simultaneously read each other’s thoughts and attempted to send each other non-verbal signals. The problem was that under such stressful conditions and the blinding cover of sentiment, neither one could formulate a coherent thought.
“Ohhhh, I see then. So you don’t want John to know. Hmm. Perhap it involves him?” Mycroft continued haughtily, as if he had just discovered a treasure. “Keeping secrets, Sherlock? Tsk Tsk. I thought you two were past that.”
“John!”
“Where are they, Mycroft? I want to see them,” John gasped as he scrambled upright and planted himself next to the elder Holmes brother
“Breathing.”
“No, John,” he said quietly. “We’ve waited long enough.”
“Why didn’t you say something before?” Sherlock questioned.
Irene smirked, “Talked, huh?” as she held up her hands to do air quotes around the word “talked.” Sherlock mirrored her smirk.
want?” Sherlock asked not-quite-so-nonchalantly as he would have hoped.
A long stretch of heavy silence followed, then the detective's breath shuddered with a whispered reply.
“Who is it?” John asked, as his stomach sank a little.
“What … did … you … say?” Sherlock slowly asked, with every word taking precedence.
"Again ... it's highly probable."
"I'm not letting her major in chemistry though, even if she's set on it, because—"
“Are you ok?” John gasped.
Sherlock’s entire body clenched as he felt an adrenaline spike like he’d never felt before. He plunged forcefully into John causing his partner’s hips to convulse violently in response.
He looked up at John like a child waiting for a scolding.
“Sherlock, wait,” said John.
All the while, Sherlock sat with hands folded in his lap, like a small boy sitting obediently in a church pew, observing, cataloging and making mental notes of what was being played out before him. Sherlock’s eyes went wide as John looked up at the man he loved and eased the shirt off his own shoulders, allowing it to slide down his arms and rest on the mattress behind him. Sherlock could hardly breathe. His eyes scanned every pore, freckle and hair on John’s chest and it was the most stunning sight he had ever seen.
The younger man’s eyes slowly closed and John knew that not even the great Sherlock Holmes could fend off sleep any longer. John smiled softly and shifted closer to his best friend. Sherlock reached out and pulled their bodies tightly together; John’s rugged face pressed against Sherlock’s smooth chest and the detective’s sharp chin rested gently atop golden-grey strands. Their bodies lay interwoven; their souls connected as one. It was warm and right.
John stilled. Sherlock’s use of the plural noun echoed within his mind. In his sadness, John had forgotten that he was not going through this alone. There was another man, a parent, who shared his pain, and in fact, was probably processing through his own. John pulled back and searched his partner’s face, observing Sherlock’s slightly, red-rimmed eyes.
It wasn’t as if Sherlock didn’t know what to do; this was just … unexpected. Every time Sherlock had allowed his mind to imagine this moment, John was always “in charge.” He’d imagined John’s strong, firm body positioned perfectly above his, stroking into him as Sherlock writhed and bucked beneath John on the mattress … sofa … desk … kitchen table. … He just assumed that Captain Watson would naturally fall into taking command of the proceedings and Sherlock was quite fine with that arrangement.
Sherlock sprang from the sofa so fast even Mycroft’s unflappable assistant was startled. He quickly grabbed his coat and the pair made their way to the waiting car outside. After a 45-minute trek, during which time Sherlock’s mind raced with approximately 57 scenarios of how John and he were going to react when they saw each other again, the car stopped. But before Sherlock could exit, Anthea stopped him.
Sherlock nodded, never taking his eyes off of John’s.
“Yes, you are,” replied John, as his serious expression faltered into a chuckling grin. “Now what is it you really want to ask me, Sherlock?”
“I know,” John chuckled. “But if we stay this way, it won’t be long before we’re both
As Sherlock tried to will his heart to calm down, his brain to reboot and his mouth to make a sound, he was confused as to why he was having this physical reaction. He also realized that he still hadn’t said anything and John was looking at him with a hopeful look that was turning swiftly into something that resembled dejection.
“John’s not here right now,” she started.
” Then John smirked and cocked an eyebrow, “And perhaps later, after all of these
“He—He’s staring at me,” Mary leaned over and murmured to Irene, neither one of them taking their eyes off the man across from them.
Sherlock interrupted John’s speech as he grabbed his best friend’s face with both hands and looked directly and intently into his eyes. “So did you.”
Finally, Sherlock bent his head forward and turned to face John’s neck, returning the favor. However, he added his own twist, adding small bites that caused John to gasp “Oh, God, yes” and hold onto Sherlock even tighter. When the detective-turned-snogger was satisfied with the work he’d completed on his partner’s neck, his lips released their prey and the two men held still for a moment; faces touched cheek to cheek; quick, uneven, hot breaths blew past each other’s ears.
“You said ‘people’, plural,” John prodded, hoping that the conversation was turning in a direction that might open a door that he thought had been bolted shut. “Who else do you find stimulating?”
As their bodies began to settle and the haze began to clear, John’s mind replayed the moment when he could feel Sherlock washing through him. He felt marked, but not controlled. John knew that this amazing man wanted him … needed him … chose him … and loved him. He was Sherlock’s. And he always would be.

John was going to sacrifice his life. He could hear John’s warehouse confession replaying,

Sherlock stared at him, unblinking, a small crease forming between his brows.
John grabbed the lube from where it had been hastily placed on the duvet and placed a generous amount into Sherlock’s hand. He then squeezed some onto his own hand, discarded the tube and looked at Sherlock hungrily. John reached down with his lubed-up hand and began rubbing it slowly along and all over Sherlock’s cock. The younger man’s arousal became quickly apparent and he tilted his head back slightly to let John kiss and suck on his neck.
“Come for me, John!”
Two weeks after the hair dryer incident …
Then the former army doctor, and consummate healer, leaned forward. “And this,” he said, as he gently put his lips on Sherlock’s chest, and placed a small, intimate kiss right over his heart, “is for all the other scars.”
This only affirmed John’s plan and he pulled his hand upward, slowing the activity and eliciting another incoherent sound from Sherlock’s lips.
“She’s not ready, Sherlock.”
And because the car had come to a complete stop, as throngs of oblivious, mobile-swiping students ambled in front of it, and because he still had 10 minutes until the start of his next class, and because he was just plain bored out of his mind, Sherlock furrowed his brow and began a litany of deductions.
“No, it’s not okay!” John answered loudly. “I didn’t know. In all that time from when you came back until you got shot … I didn’t know! I blamed you, I—“
John was staring at his partner with concern. “Sherlock, what’s going on in that mind of yours? Tell me. Please?”
“Thank you,” he continued, “for your trust.”
Sherlock wasn’t prepared for that deduction and the type and amount of emotion that accompanied it. Suddenly, there needed to be space cleared in John’s room to store this information, but he couldn’t find any. Sherlock was holding onto something he knew was special, and at the same time frightening. He needed to put it down so he could look at it and study it … place it under a microscope … run it through several experiments and compare all the data.
* * * * *
Sherlock looked down at their hands. He was embarrassed that he had even had those crazy, insecure thoughts. “I thought maybe you had changed your mind.”
“Oh?” the elder Holmes drawled.
John watched as several emotions played out on Sherlock’s face, until one finally settled there that John recognized as trepidation. Sherlock fiddled with the glass that he held in his lap and John cocked his head, waiting patiently for his friend to finish processing his thoughts into words that a muggle like John would understand.
“She’s just so young. A child.”
“We most certainly are,” Moriarty hissed.
“I love you,” said Sherlock.
“No, no, that’s alright,” Irene answered. “Sherlock can help.”
Sherlock stopped abruptly and pulled back slightly, peering into John’s face as the older man writhed with the sudden loss of stroking. Sherlock’s eyes were jet black and unblinking. John forced himself not to smirk as he realized that one of the gears in Sherlock’s big, beautiful brain must have jumped off the track for a moment. Sherlock blinked and John knew he was back.
Turning off the taps, Sherlock stepped out of the shower and wrapped himself in his dressing gown, realizing that he wasn’t any closer to solving the “case.”
John’s body betrayed his relief as he sagged into the cushioned leather and swiped a hand over his face. “Thank, God,” he breathed. “Wait, why are you here? I mean why are you with me instead of Sherlock?” he questioned.
John turned to face him and replied, “I’m looking forward to it, mate.” Then, he turned and plopped down into his comfy chair.
Finally, Sherlock looked up and stared directly into John’s eyes. The determination the doctor saw there almost made him catch his breath.
John leaned forward and his lips ghosted over Sherlock’s. “Never. It’s just that when I give myself to you, I want to feel all of you inside me.”
“I see,” John replied somberly.
Not the family time.
“In a matter of speaking,” replied Sherlock.
“We don’t have to do anything right now, you know,” John continued. “We can just lie on the bed together or sleep, or—“
A dramatic pause then lingered until Sherlock gritted out, “I need a favor.”
“By the way John, Detective Inspector Lestrade sends his thanks for your help on the Corrigan case. Another case closed, another life saved, thanks to Doctor Watson.” Sherlock waved his hand absentmindedly. “Now, if you gentlemen will excuse us, we need to check in at the registration table.” He began to turn away but then got that familiar look in his eye and turned back around to face the three doctors. “Oh, and by the way,” he started with the GP, “Your staff knows about your drug addiction,” then looked at the vascular surgeon, “Maybe if you stopped betting on the ponies you wouldn’t have to file for bankruptcy,” and finally Sherlock faced the neurosurgeon, “If I were you, I’d put her on a leash … since she has a tendency to wander.”
Sherlock’s breathing was scattered at best as he allowed himself to take in the magnificent man before him. He worked the lube in his own hand so that it was coating his fingers then leaned down and placed the tip of his index finger at John’s entrance. He caressed the opening then pushed in to the first knuckle. John felt a slight burning and sucked in a breath but continued to look at Sherlock through heavy eyelids. Sherlock prodded one finger, then eventually two, then three, gently stretching John’s opening wider and wider. As his fingers continued to work on his lover, Sherlock couldn’t help himself and bent down to take a lick of John’s cock.
“Hi, Irene,” the woman said as she approached the table, and Irene offered her the chair right next to hers. Mary then turned to Sherlock and said, “And you are?”
Sherlock’s eyes raked down the arm to the person’s hand.
“I … Oh, Sherlock … I don’t want to--mmmm … do it like this.”
Meanwhile, Sherlock was making a valiant effort of employing his own technique to restore normal breathing as he continued freeing the button from its fabric cage. He then moved his fingers downward toward the next two buttons, making a gentle swipe with his thumb down John’s sternum in the process and causing a slight shudder in the doctor. Sherlock would stop if he felt John was truly in distress, but his partner’s breathing had evened out as he now leaned his forehead on Sherlock’s lips. His grip on Sherlock’s waist had eased a little prompting the younger man to continue his descent down the front of his partner’s shirt, unfastening each button with care as if they were made of crystal and could break with a single touch.
Sherlock hummed in agreement.
everything to John. And as he looked into Sherlock’s eyes, John knew the three little words that conveyed the depth of his feelings. … the three little words that Sherlock needed to hear.
However, as sometimes happens, one epiphany opens the door for others. The enlightenment of Sherlock Holmes continued. …
“John,” Sherlock gasped. “I can think of only one thing that would bore me right now.”
“I do that on occasion,” John quipped.
“Yes!” Sherlock suddenly blurted out, wanting to quash the fear he saw forming in John’s eyes. He cleared his throat, “I-I mean, yes, thank you,” Sherlock stated as calmly as he could. “I would be honored to accompany you.”
Sherlock was caught in a rush of emotion. John knew and understood. John knew the pain and scars of Sherlock’s past—the teasing, the bullying, the abuse. He knew Sherlock’s nightmarish descent into and resurrection from the infernal pit of drug addiction. He knew the isolation of his childhood and the loneliness of his adulthood. He knew the mental and emotional scars Sherlock had suffered in the last few years. John knew and understood it all because John knew and understood Sherlock.
John noticed Sherlock shift slightly in his seat and look away again toward the fire, and John joined him, their faces taking in the warmth and light. There were several moments of quiet, with just the soft hiss of flames accompanying the dancing shadows across the walls. Then suddenly, a soft whisper broke through.
Not even the odd things Sherlock and Rosie prepared for dinner.
“Surprise!” squealed Moriarty. “Your beloved-,“ he sang. “… and your wife,” he drawled.
And they both dove in for another passionate kiss.
“What’s that?” John slurred.
“And you had every right to feel that way,” answered the detective.
So, he allowed himself to steal moments like these, when he could look fondly upon his best friend, knowing that he (John) would spend the rest of his life trying to be a true and faithful friend to Sherlock and an able partner and blogger to the great Sherlock Holmes.
What was strange was that in all of this time, Sherlock didn’t seem … bored.
“And those shoulders!” Irene baited.
John pushed himself up to lean on his elbows. His demeanor had changed to one of uncertainty. “I was thinking …”
As Moriarty spoke, John could feel the man’s presence getting closer until it felt like he was being wrapped in a cloak of dread.
John felt as if he’d been hit by a bus. Those were not the words that he thought would come out of Sherlock’s mouth. John knew that he loved Sherlock but he hadn’t known if Sherlock felt the same. In fact, he had thought at one point there was a chance that Sherlock, although capable of sentiment, might be incapable of feeling actual love. John mentally admonished himself as he replayed the words in his head. Sherlock,
John chuckled and broke away, wiping his hand hastily on the duvet. He laid down on the bed and placed a pillow under himself, bent his knees and spread himself fully, looking lustfully at Sherlock.
John!”
As he soaked in the sight before him, Sherlock spoke timidly as if this incarnation would suddenly disappear.
… Sherlock’s inner dialogue continued as the cab crept along in rush hour traffic. It was the evening of the awards banquet at which John was being honored and Sherlock had been due to meet his flatmate at the hotel. The pair had agreed to meet up at the event at a designated time—John being required to attend the pre-banquet “meet-and-greet,” (of which Sherlock wanted no part of) and Sherlock being called in by Lestrade to consult on a burglary case-gone-awry, which registered as a five in Sherlock’s mind and wouldn’t take long. However, the case quickly escalated into an eight, and the detective found himself having to do a little extra leg-work at the crime scene, especially since his blogger hadn’t accompanied him. The fact that John wasn’t by his side had put Sherlock into a state of irritation right out of the gate, which culminated in an impressive display of extreme multi-tasking as he simultaneously rattled off deductions, insulted Lestrade and most of his team, texted John that he’d be “a bit” late and hailed a cab.
“How have you been?” John asked with sincerity.
As Sherlock sat in the cab mentally cursing every person who was driving a vehicle in London at the moment, he brushed a stray piece of lint off his trousers and took a moment to admire his attire. He was dressed in a dark suit with monochromatic steel grey shirt (and tie) because in John’s words
“I see,” Sherlock answered.
“It wasn’t my place,” John spoke softly and averted his eyes. “I didn’t feel like I had the right.”
John looked at Sherlock’s face, where a genuine, soft smile had taken form, and could feel his own amazement turn to fondness as his eyes took in the love of his life.
“I don’t much care,” John replied. “You pick the restaurant.” He then turned and walked back down the hallway to the sitting room leaving Sherlock staring at his backside—John’s perfectly fascinating backside with John’s perfectly-fitted trousers cupping John’s perfectly-muscled arse and his hips moving, no, swaying with every step.
“Well, we’re not married, but we do live together,” Sherlock answered innocently, totally unaware of the double meaning.
needed to return to the shower and take care of some business that had suddenly … crept up.
“Sherlock?” John sat up properly and grabbed both of Sherlock’s hands.
Two weeks after the banquet …
Sherlock softly pleaded, “Please forgive me for leaving you the way I did.”
John settled himself and the fingers on his arms loosened, but only slightly.
“I can understand why you may have come to the false hypothesis that I’d be bored over the last few weeks,” Sherlock began. “My past behavior did provide only a partial data set in which to work. That coupled with the knowledge you have that my brain has an innate tendency toward necessary stimulation could lead you to your present conclusion.”
Before John could counter, a familiar voice spoke up behind him.
But instead of all that, he was forced to simply hold it and experience it. It felt like fire engulfing him, then a tidal wave of joy crashing into him, followed by a moment of peace washing through him, then back into the fire again.
John regained his senses, “Wh- What?”
As he stepped inside and the water cascaded over him, Sherlock felt the symbolic cleansing of a past life. He wasn’t sure what the next few hours would bring, but he knew things would never go back … could never go back … to the way they were. And truthfully, … he didn’t want them to.
He smiled hesitantly at John, who was staring at him with astonishment and (dare Sherlock hope) … pride? Sherlock took this as his cue to continue. “So sorry I’m late. Traffic is nearly impossible at this time of day.”
It was John’s turn to blink a few times as he felt himself slipping into some sort of consulting detective TED talk. Leave it to Sherlock to provide a scientific explanation for an everyday observation.
All of a sudden Sherlock was knocked abruptly from his thoughts by Irene slugging his arm.
John took another sip from his glass, and watched Sherlock turn to look at the fire. The doctor couldn’t tell if the slight blush that had colored the detective’s cheeks was from John’s compliment, Sherlock’s drink, or the heat of the fire.
Sherlock remained still and silent. His head was now tilted toward the floor; his eyes darted back and forth. Even in the throes of despair, his mind feverishly tried to devise a plan.
“We’ll never see her.”
“Well, don’t touch him,” Irene ordered. “I think it’s going well up there.”
… Contrary to his own beliefs, Sherlock was having a very imaginative mental conversation with himself as he stood in the shower, leaning one hand against the wet tiles as the other one tugged at his water-laden curls. He was thankful for the hot water cascading over his lanky form, as it seemed to calm his nerves, which had been fine until about an hour ago. That’s when Sherlock had had a very lengthy and heated debate with a hearing specialist.
John’s mind was a vortex of thoughts and emotions. All of the initial happiness, then hurt, betrayal, grief and forgiveness he had shared with Mary were warring inside of him. He grabbed her hand and looked down at where their two hands held each other. He could feel her warmth and knew that whatever he said now would haunt him for the rest of his life as it either would feel like it hadn’t been enough or it had been too much. So John said nothing and instead looked at her with compassion and understanding and found the same expression mirrored in her face. They held each other’s hands for several minutes, exchanging smiles, Mary wiping moisture from the corners of her eyes now and then, but neither one saying a word. Finally, there was a light tap at the door and the pair turned to see Mycroft enter the room.
Besides, there were times when the relationship between Sherlock and himself still seemed so fragile. Even though the “Eurus situation” had taken place several years ago, John still felt that he and Sherlock were still getting their feet back under them. And since earning Sherlock’s forgiveness, John was determined never to do something to upset the delicate balance the two of them had built over these past few years.
Sherlock always knew John was noble; the soldier in him. He was protective; the doctor in him. He was loyal; the friend in him. But until that moment, he never realized how much John loved and cared about him.
Moriarty walked around the blindfolded doctor and John suddenly felt exposed and extremely vulnerable. If Moriarty meant to kill him, John wished he would just get it over with.
John was still looking intensely at his partner, which caused the detective’s brain to momentarily fog up, but then Sherlock leaned over and opened the drawer to his bedside table, pulling a condom and lube from it.
“And what would stop me from shooting you instead?” he blurted, then wished he hadn’t. For all of a sudden one of the hands holding his arm pulled away and he heard a click behind him as a cold, metal gun barrel hit his lower back. Two other thugs pointed their guns at Mary and Sherlock.
John squeezed Sherlock’s hands and replied with a steady, sure voice, “I trust
“Get up, love. I need to clean us.”
And suddenly … Sherlock didn’t want to delete any of it.
“Stop, Sherlock,” John pleaded. “I won’t last like this.”
“I don’t understand,” Sherlock tilted his head slightly bewildered.
The corner of John’s mouth quirked up a bit just thinking about it.
John was so caught up in the profound sadness of the moment that he didn’t hear the soft footsteps that made their way toward him. Suddenly, familiar arms were gently pulling him in, like a bee to a flower, and he found himself completely enveloped in a warm, loving embrace.
Sherlock, whose breathing had ceased at the mention of the young man’s name, made to turn his head when Mary reproached him.
“John,” Sherlock panted.
“Mmph,” his partner responded.
“Oh, God, Sherlock” John gasped. “You feel so good.”
“Oh, can I help?” Mary asked worriedly and began to rise from her chair.
“And, thank you,” Sherlock concluded as he placed his hand softly on John’s cheek, “for your love.”
Sherlock quickly turned around as Anthea opened the door and beckoned him with her index finger to follow her. He was led to a well-appointed study with rich, dark paneling and hundreds of dust-covered books. On the desk was an electronic device and monitor, on which a former army doctor’s movements were being tracked. Sherlock scanned the screen and let out a breath when he saw John enter the sitting room at Baker Street, then caught it again when John entered Sherlock’s bedroom. Unconsciously, Sherlock reached out and touched the monitor where John’s face was being broadcast. It’s a pose Sherlock would hold for another half an hour as he watched his best friend peacefully sleep.
Sherlock traps John's arm back against his chest, nodding around it.
he kisses him until Sherlock is breathless for the second time in as many minutes, and he feels John smile against his cheek and his fingers again curl in his hair. "I love you," John rasps to his ear, and Sherlock signs it back into his chest. He will always sign it back. It is an inescapable, incontrovertible fact of life that Sherlock Holmes loves John Watson.
He could tell Sherlock liked kissing, at least. He could feel it in how he moved under his hands, and the sounds he made, and the way he kissed back that he liked it. He wasn't just reciprocating because it was what he thought John wanted. This was something that made Sherlock happy.
"Have dinner..." John does stop for a moment there. He pulls back just far enough to blink at him, and then his face transforms into another grin. "Is that a euphemism? Really?
He'd gotten through that night and even gotten the better of Oscar at the end, he'd stood up on his own two feet and made a fool of him right there in front of everyone-- how could he think that he'd
"Anyone that I know?" he asked finally, and rather stupidly. What, did he think Sherlock and Lestrade had had a fling on the side? Sherlock had just said that he hadn't in a while.
John looked away again. He wasn't the world's biggest fan of hypotheticals like this-- it wasn't real, so what did it matter?-- but he could already see where Ella was going with this, and she'd already proven herself to be very, very good at what she did. So he swallowed his pride and he did it. He pictured the young, pretty doctor at the surgery, the one he might've been able to see himself with in another life. There was no interest there, now. She was smart, and pretty, and polite, and perfectly lovely. And there was no interest there at all.
going to kill you. Or me. God." He sinks back down into his chair, limp and exasperated, but at least he's stopped looking like he's going to force Sherlock away. "I gave you cold case files!"
Sherlock. Please believe me. I was scared and felt like I was failing you and didn't know what to do but I wanted someone else to fix it for me. I'm still scared because I don't know what to do to help you. But I know it's not this, Sherlock." He squeezes his eyes shut, feels the trembling of Sherlock's back beneath him and the wretched whines of breath. "I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Please believe me."
you posh bastard, and I still didn't- I am such an idiot. I am a blind, stupid idiot."
