Dean squinted briefly at his alarm, but couldn’t seem to find it in him to care. He came to rest his head against the door, his eyes already closing.
He was trying very hard to make his brother understand that if he could kill with a stare, he would do it right now. But Sam was only glaring at him as if Dean was the biggest moron living on the planet.
He didn’t think he could find the words, but he needed Cas to understand. He had been so close to losing everything.
Surprising even himself, Dean let out a small laugh. Unable to stop himself, he softly stroked Cas’ hair.
If God wasn’t such an asshole, he’d be praying to reach it on time. But since God was pretty much the reason all this shit show was happening, the only thought in Dean’s mind was the same that had been going off this entire hour.
Too late, he thought. Castiel stopped in front of him. He hadn’t looked away once, walking in the middle of the crowd of students without a single care in the world. His throat was dry, his tongue felt heavy in his mouth. He was stuck, drowning in his blue eyes. He had never realized that they were that blue.
Not that he thought that he deserved to be Castiel’s boyfriend more than her, heck, Castiel could choose to date whoever he wanted, he was his own person. Castiel didn’t even know who Dean was. That was probably the saddest part. Even Meg wasn’t aware of Dean’s existence, which was probably for the best. As much of a tough guy Dean prided himself of being, Meg could be really scary. He was sure that she could kick his ass if she ever wanted to. Another reason to admire Castiel from afar.
Dean waved at Charlie across the hallway, briefly smiling at her. He was feeling lonely, but he still didn’t feel like talking, even to his best friend. She smiled in return, her gaze drifting towards the end of the hallway. Instinctively, he looked in the same direction, only to meet a really distinct pair of blue eyes. It felt like the eyes were looking directly at his soul, and he shivered. That’s only when he realized that the owner of those eyes was getting closer. He could recognize who it was only with his eyes, but he examined the rest anyway, because he couldn’t believe it was true. Eyes, nose, lips, hair, stubble… All of it screamed Castiel, but still…
Slipping his other arm under Cas’ armpits, he held him close. Cas wrapped his free arm around his neck. Dean could feel Cas’ own tears against his skin.
They both stayed silent for a bit, as if neither of them could remember how to form words. The world seemed to have stopped, everything standing still, waiting.
He stumbled out of bed, standing up to go open the door. The covers went with him, wrapped around his torso.
Dean was blushing so hard, he could feel it. The hallway seemed too narrow suddenly, too hot, and looking at Castiel was too much. He was dreaming again, wasn’t he?
Cas had believed in him when no one else did. He had always been by his side, no matter how many times Dean had tried to push him away.
They arrived on time, probably thanks to the few speed limits that Dean ignored while trying to get away from his brother as soon as possible. Dean had run off towards the locker rooms immediately after having parked his car, and Sam had disappeared somewhere in the hallways to look for his friends.
He could feel his lips starting to shake, but still didn’t dare to move. The dark-haired boy smiled, stuffing his hands in his pockets. What was happening right now? How did he know who Dean was?
When the figure next to Castiel turned toward Dean, he started looking in front of him again, ignoring the feeling of jealousy spreading in his chest. Meg Masters. She was always glued to Castiel’s side, with an arm around his shoulders, or her head in his lap. Dean couldn’t understand why Castiel had chosen to date her. He was so good he didn’t even seem real, and she was the complete opposite… She didn’t even try to hide it, so Castiel had to know about everything. About the gun that she was carrying around at all times. About the way she acted around anyone who wasn’t Castiel. She was a dick, basically. Simply seeing her car around town pissed Dean off. She obviously didn’t deserve Castiel, yet she had the chance to be the person chosen by Castiel. She had his heart, his love, and to Dean, it wasn’t fair.
“We’d one hundred percent support you if you did. You wouldn’t have to leave like last time.” Sam’s still pissed at Dean for that whole debacle. Cas is their family, and he didn’t deserve to be treated so shittily.
Dean stood and rubbed the back of his neck. “Lost yet, Kevin?” he asked with only a small tremor in his voice.
Also, holy shit, there is so much healthy talking in this section. I wanted them to have better lives than the show gave them. Sorrynotsorry
And because Cas is calm, so is Dean. He grins soppily at Cas (and how does he not realize how ridiculously
One day, Dean answered the bunker door expecting another grizzled hunter needing a place to stay, only to find a teenaged girl on the steps. She looked a little familiar, with her long blonde hair and blue eyes, but Dean couldn’t place her until she asked for Castiel.
They’re lingering at the table with glasses of whiskey. Laughter hangs from their lips. Castiel looks up from his glass to see Dean gazing at him with a fond expression. His smile widens when Castiel’s eyes meet his, and he opens his mouth for a moment, but he doesn’t speak. He spins his whiskey glass around instead.
He was doing some laps, his eyes unconsciously drifting towards the benches where he immediately spotted a familiar face. Even from afar, he could tell that his hair was as wild as usual. On anybody else, it would look terrible, but Castiel somehow pulled it off, looking like a walking fantasy in his stupidly adorable oversized trench coat. Why he couldn’t get a coat that fitted him was a true mystery, but once again, it only made him look more charming.
Slowly getting Cas back into the room, he felt the edges of the portal running against his back, and finally it was done.
As he got to it, the portal was barely big enough for Dean to step through, but he couldn’t afford to stop now.
Dean remained silent, incapable to understand what Castiel was saying to him. He didn’t seem upset by it, still looking at Dean with so much intensity that it was no surprise that Dean was now glued to the spot.
Dean let out a sigh and opened his eyes. Sure enough, Castiel was the one lying next to him, looking down at him with a raised eyebrow. His right arm was wrapped around Dean’s waist, the hunter had an arm and a leg draped over him, and Dean’s head was resting in the space between the angel’s shoulder and neck.
At some point they had sunk to the ground again, unable to stand under their own power, unable to let the other go, laying in a tangle of limbs, clinging when they had to break apart to breathe.
Dean yanked him back down with a growl. “Oh no you don’t. You’re not leaving me here to deal with it alone!”
At the contact, Castiel's eyes moved back to his face for a moment, before he let out a breath, his body slumping.
Once Charlie was in sight of the small field they’d set up, she sent the notification to Kevin, who then started the summoning.
Castiel stopped singing as Dean’s head fell onto his shoulder and his breathing became deep and even. The shock that someone had actually
Dean didn’t know the language, but he closed his eyes and let Castiel’s voice wash over him, soothing him and calming his mind.
Dena sighed. “You assume too much.” He said bluntly, and Castiel gaped at him. “First you assume that you can’t have what you want, then you assume that Sam and I wouldn’t tear the universe apart to try and get you back. Then you assume I’d feel uncomfortable around you. Then you assume I don’t want you in my life. Seriously Cas, maybe you should stop assuming and let me speak for once.”
The angel looked to be on the verge of disappearing, his flight or fight instincts seeming to have kicked into overdrive.
Ellen looked over at the two brothers, spotting the way their shoulders sagged slightly, and gave a small sad smile. “You must be tired Sam. Dean, why don’t you take him home so you can get some rest.” She turned back to the others and started shooing them away. “Come on, we can catch up some more tomorrow, Sam isn’t going anywhere.”
Dean frowned as they stopped in a field. “Charlie, what exactly….” he trailed off as he realised his friend was no longer behind him. He spun around in confusion, just in time to see a translucent barrier snap into place a second after the sound of wing beats filled the air.
Dean snorted again. “Sam and I have depression.” He said bluntly. “We’re in Heaven, and we have fucking depression.”
“By the amount of flashes, probably about four or five.” Castiel replied, and Dean groaned, turning his face to hide in the angel’s shoulder.
Sometimes he went for a drive, just letting himself get lost in the road and the music. Sometimes he went to a grove he’d found one day and just sat, letting everything pour out of him before bottling it back up and going home.
Castiel looked away, but Dean could see the redness creeping up his cheeks. It was adorable, he thought, hiding a smile.
Suddenly, all of Dean’s emotions broke free. Surprisingly enough, anger and hurt were the most prominent ones.
“I don’t know what’s up with them!” Mary exclaimed after a few minutes of silence. “I knew Dean was in a strange way, but I was sure he’d be fine once Sam showed up!”
“If I let them.” A young voice came from behind them, and they all whirled around in shock to see Jack standing there, watching Sam and Dean sadly,
Mary and John blinked in confusion. “Well then get him here then.” Mary demanded, before turning and walking off. John followed her.
“I designed yours and Sam’s Heavens.” Castiel admitted. “I tweaked them, twisted them to try and give the both of you the Heaven you deserved. Seems I even failed at that.”
Dean didn’t call him out, and instead did the exact same thing, painting on a fake smile, cracking some cheesy joke, putting on his music a little too loud. They both knew the other could see through their facade, but they kept it up, knowing that if they broke now, it would take too long to put the pieces back together.
He had drinks with Bobby and told him about their lives and the people they met (“You better not have replaced me ya idjit.” “Never Bobby, never.”)
“You did Cas.” Dean replied gently, squeezing his friend’s hand again. Castiel’s eyes moved to his again. Deep inside them, the hunter could see something vulnerable. There was something in there that was cracked, broken, and Dean felt an overwhelming urge to do anything to fix that, to take away the pain. “Honestly, I think that was some of the most beautiful singing I’ve ever heard.” Dean thought back to the moment he opened the door and awe swept through him again. “It was...I don’t know how to describe it, it was just awesome.”
That was another thing - he had a home now. A home he made for himself, because he wanted to. A home he built from his memories and his dreams.
“But, I messed all that up didn’t I? I thought I’d make you uncomfortable. Why would you still want…..?” Castiel stuttered, seemingly unable to get his words out.
So he stayed. He lay down on the bed next to Dean, and let the man curl into him. He stayed by Dean’s side all night
They stood in silence for a few minutes, the tension between them steadily climbing, before finally a sigh broke through the quiet.
Cautiously, he continued forward, closer to their door, and it got louder. He moved slowly, keeping his breathing quiet and even, and eventually, it formed words.
“Yeah, well,” Jo replied, gazing at the same thing, “since when have the Winchesters paid attention to what was possible?”
They'd driven up to the town, interviewed the witnesses, looked over the dead bodies, checked out the crime scene - business as usual - and that's where things became strange.
For the first time during his story, Castiel met Dean’s eyes. “Music. Songs. Humans who found ways to weave such ordinary sounds into so many beautiful melodies.” Castiel’s eyes took on a far-away look, as though he was remembering them. “It reawoke my love for singing, but these songs were so much better than those in Heaven. I was scared to sing them, because I knew if I tried to, I’d ruin them. So I settled for listening. I listened and committed them all to memory, so I could play them over and over again in my head. I tried to figure out why they were so much better than Heaven’s songs, but I could never figure it out until recently.”
The thump caught the others’ attention, and they made their way over, following their gaze and spotting the two Winchesters.
Dean felt his body slump as he listened, the tiredness of the past days returning. As his mind slowed and calmed, his eyes became heavier, and his muscles relaxed. His head fell to the side, landing gently on something firm and soft, and he gave into sleep.
He even saw his Mum and Dad a few times, though that was a lot more awkward. Mary didn’t want to talk about hunting, John didn’t want to admit that he was wrong with how he raised his sons, and Dean didn’t want to admit that any stories he told would probably upset both of them. They ended up either talking about the far past, with his parents telling their childhood stories, or talking about here and now in Heaven. Dean didn’t spend much time with them. He had his found family, that was so much better than his blood family.
By the time their tears had dried, the sun had sunk low in the sky, and their muscles were starting to protest against their position. Slowly, they began to untangle themselves, stretching their muscles out and wincing as joints popped quietly.
For all intents and purposes, he should be happy right now. He should be at peace. He was in Heaven for fucks sake, driving down an open road in his Baby, with a case of permanently-cold beer and fresh cherry pie. His Baby was running as smooth as silk, the sky above was clear and bright, and Dean Winchester
It only got more complicated from there. The case was a winding road of monsters apparently working together, and old legends that tied buildings and places and people together in a massive spider web of deaths and disappearances.
Dean slowly walked towards him, stopping close enough that he could feel the heat coming from the angel’s body. He lifted one hand and wrapped it around the back of Castiel’s head, purposefully tilting it back.
Whatever Castiel was going to say next was lost as they took in the position the two of them were now in. Dean’s pull had unbalanced the angel, causing him to fall almost directly on top of the hunter, and they were now pressed flush together from the waist down, Castiel supporting his upper body on one elbow.
Castiel swallowed hard, screwing his eyes shut in pain. “Of course I couldn’t even do that.” He whispered, his face crumpling.
Dean was with Bobby when he suddenly felt the pull - the urge to get in his car and drive. His head snapped up in confusion, but Bobby smiled knowingly.
Dean hated himself even more when he saw the hurt he’d been carrying around slip into Sam’s features. But he hated the comfort he felt in that most of all. Hated that it eased the weight on him a little to see Sam sharing his burden.
Angrily, he jerked the wheel, sending his Baby flying around another corner, the beers rattling together in the back, refusing to acknowledge the tears blurring his sight, because Cas was back, Cas was alive, and apparently wanted nothing to do with them anymore.
A battle raged inside Castiel. On one hand, he knew that if Dean was conscious and in control, he never would have asked this, asked for Castiel to stay with him. In fact, he’d told the angel multiple times that waking up to find him there was creepy. But on the other hand, this was Dean, begging for him to stay. This was the man he loved asking for him to stay with him.
“Hello?” He asked, his voice low and icey. He spun around, and immediately met deep blue eyes filled with apprehension and fear. “Hello? Is that seriously all you can fucking say?” He laughed bitterly. “But then, obviously saying ‘hello’ is extremely hard for you to do, since it’s been what? A good few years since we last saw each other and not a single fucking word. Guess you’ve finally realised what everyone else has - that we’re not worth wasting your time on.”
Sam’s arrival was announced by his voice calling Cas’ name, broken in disbelief. Cas looked up at him and smiled, his face streaked with tears. He beckoned for Sam, and the younger hunter crashed into him and Dean, his own tears spilling over as the gap in their lives was filled again.
“Yeah, Cas.” Dean said slowly, wanting to try and hammer the fact through his skull. “How many times do we have to tell you - you’re part of our family. Surprise surprise, we want you in our Heaven.”
Dean knew that questioning him probably wouldn't help matters, but the curiosity was eating at him, so he opened his mouth and took the plunge.
Sam turned his head to smile at his brother. “Dean.” He said simply, and Dean’s breath caught. “Dean Castiel Winchester.”
Sam muttered something that could have been "food" or could have been "shoe" and disappeared down the corridor.
Tears were blurring Dean’s sight by this point, and at some point he’d sank to his knees. He wasn’t entirely sure when.
Dean’s grin fell, and Sam’s did the same a moment later as he saw. “If he is I haven’t seen him.” Dean admitted softly. He hesitated, but added the last bit, knowing Sam would find out eventually. “Haven’t seen Cas either.”
Dean felt a wave of red-hot rage towards the angels building in his chest, but he pushed it down and nodded. They could get back to that some other day.
“You see, if you’d actually given me time to respond.” Dean continued. “Then you’d have learnt that my silence was actually due to the shock of knowing that my feelings were reciprocated.”
Sometimes, when he came home after spending his day in the grove, he would sit at the table in his kitchen - copied from the one in the bunker - and just trace the carvings that marred the surface, selfishly wishing that he had his brother and his angel and his son here with him.
Dean laughed suddenly, forgetting that Sam wouldn’t know. “No, no, Sam. No, Heaven’s changed a lot since our last visit. When Jack took the reins he came up and fixed a few things up. Got rid of all the walls and separate Heavens and mixed everything together. Just one big Heaven now. Everyone together, everyone got their own small bit, but it’s all part of one.” Dean grinned at his brother. “Everyone’s probably waiting for you back at the Roadhouse. Bobby knows I’ve come to get you so he’s probably gathered everyone together.”
They stood for a few minutes, before Dean broke the silence. “How’s your life been Sammy?” He asked quietly, staring out at the river below them.
Then, he would get up, scold himself for thinking like that, and go out to the Roadhouse to chat with the other dead hunters - because even in Heaven, the Roadhouse was a hunters bar.
Then, as if pulled by a magnet, they crashed together forcefully, sweeping across each other with all the passion of decades of pining. Their hands closed into fists, tugging and pulling as if trying to merge their bodies into one. Lips parted, tongues entwined, breath was stolen. One of them gave a quiet moan, another whimpered softly, both noises swallowed into the kiss.
“Because I was afraid.” Castiel whispered. “Because the last thing I said to you…” He shook his head. “I didn’t want things to be awkward. I never expected an answer from you, and I didn’t want to force you into that situation. I know you don’t reciprocate my feelings, and that’s fine. I didn’t want an answer, I didn’t need an answer. So I thought I’d just stay away, make everything easier. That’s why I didn’t want to tell you that I was alive - because you’d feel obligated to give me a response and I didn’t want to disturb your peace when you finally had it.” Castiel sighed again, wrapping his arms around his stomach.
The young God looked around at them. “Sam, Dean and Cas are my parents.” He said firmly. “I want them to be happy.”
Castiel warily made his way towards Dean and sat down next to him. He no longer seemed to be on the verge of fleeing, but Dean could see that he wasn't calm.
Over the next few weeks (Months? Years? Time in Heaven was hard to measure) Dean visited many different people.
That didn’t help the feeling of eyes on his back, a familiar weighted stare seemingly cutting right into his soul.
Dean wanted to interrupt him, to back up Gabriel’s words, to hold Cas tightly and take all the pain from his face. Deep down, his opinion of Gabriel jumped up a notch. Obviously he wasn't a complete douchebag.
His footsteps gentle, he made his way towards where he could hear the voice coming from. Anticipation building in his chest, as well as a healthy dose of wariness (how did they get into the room?) Dean rounded the corner just as the song was finishing.
For a second nothing happened, and then the barrier wavered slightly before collapsing. When the particles faded, a single teenage boy stood there, biting his lip and glancing at the three men with barely hidden want.
Slowly, not daring to make a noise unless the singer heard him, Dean pushed the door to their room open. It swung inwards, the carpet luckily muffling the noise, and he slipped inside, placing the bag down silently.
Ellen, Jo and Bobby were leaning up against the bar when they spotted the two out of the window and sighed.
"My brothers and sisters would always complain or make fun of me when I did it. They'd tell me they couldn't concentrate because of the noise or that if I liked it so much I should go join the choir and how that might be an upgrade since I couldn't fight anyway, or that I should shut up because I was better not seen and not heard." The angel took a shaky breath. "At first I just brushed them off. I liked singing, so why should I stop? But it just continued and continued and more and more angels joined in. Eventually…I just…stopped. Realized that they must be right. I put more focus into my battle training, kept to myself, buried myself in jobs and training. At one point I stopped speaking altogether. Went mute."
"No. No, it's okay Cas, we just weren't expecting you." He held his hands out in a placating gesture. He slowly moved towards the angel, unknowingly slipping into the role he took when trying to calm victims of monsters. He sank down to sit on one of the beds and patted the cover next to him. "Sit down." He clarified when the Angel looked at him, confused.
, and that the way a person looks does not always determine falling in love … but if life would be better if–”
Her mouth made a surprised oh. “You guys know about that?” She rounded on the room with a glare. “Who told?”
“No, I am still connected to the Host and have full use of my abilities. I’m just frustrated,” Castiel says in half explanation. “No one said anything remotely helpful, and at the last home, a child screeched the entire time I was there.”
“I remember everything about you. I pulled you from Hell on September eighteenth, two thousand and eight. I attempted to talk to you at a gas station that same day. We met in human form in a barn outside of Pontiac, Illinois, on September twentieth.”
does he keep winking at him? Flirting, even low key, is not a good idea. But Cas smiles up at him happily, so he doesn’t beat himself up about it too much. “Not sure about the rainbow sparkles, though. Seems a little too ‘promise of God’ to me.” He bends to pick up the latest fallen feather and twists it in his fingers to make it shimmer.
In which Dean figures out what's wrong with Cas, wings are discussed, lots of domesticity happens, and bedsharing becomes a regular thing
“More like Purgatory, with all the lowkey torture I went through.” Dean turned to Cas. “Is Purgatory real?” Cas nodded. “Then yeah, it was like that. But I finally got my head out of my ass and kissed this nerd.”
Suuuuure. If only they were that lucky. Dean slumped low in his chair, put his hands over his face, and groaned. His heart beat far too fast, and he tried to keep his breathing even. It wasn’t working. “I hate you so fucking much.”
Cas furrowed his brow. “I think it stems from your own push to make this place a home and make me part of your and Sam’s family. Being a part of something is nice, and I want Claire to have that too. She deserves it.”
Dean waited for him to look up from his paperwork to continue. “There’s something I’ve been meaning to tell you for a while now.” He took a deep breath and rubbed his forehead. “Um, so, you know how the hunter lifestyle can be—all about being tough and manly and whatever, right?”
It was suddenly hard to breathe. The things Cas listed, they were the things Dean loved too. He and Sam (and their father) had been hunting together for so long, that he really didn’t question Sam staying on with him, when there was so much work to do. But a part of Dean still saw Sam eventually settling down with a family and having some sense of normalcy. And that made Dean feel alone, because he knew he was not destined for that life. He’d hunt until the day he died. And yeah, a part of him wanted the whole family thing too—he thought back fondly to Lisa and Ben—but truthfully, that life wasn’t for him. He needed the chase, the thrill of the hunt, the relief at saving another person from things that went bump in the night. But maybe, just maybe … he could have a little of both with Cas. At least a platonic version of it. But could he do that? Be with Cas while not really
There’s a quiet snore at the end of the syllable, and Dean grins. He presses his lips to Cas’s temple. It’s not quite a kiss. But it’s not
Dean concentrated on the last few bites of chili and waited for Cas to break the silence. If he was going to shoot down Dean’s ideas, he’d have to come up with his own.
“I’m just sayin’, talk things out with your angel before you go trying to break something he might not want broken.”
. He hasn’t been able to stop thinking about that all day. Does he want it? Of course he does. He’s a red-blooded guy who just happens to be addicted to a certain angel’s presence, but no one else has to know that. Except apparently Sam, who’s too smart for his own good, the little fucker. And now Dean’s wishing for some apocalyptic event so he can go back to avoiding the whole idea completely. Except they can’t have that, because they really, really need to figure out what’s wrong with Cas before something bad happens to him.
“Okay, good, we’re getting somewhere now.” Dean squeeze Cas’s hand. “So, staying on Earth. Do you want to travel? See the world and humanity?”
Dean shrugs. “It seems to be the only thing that relaxes him. I’m waiting for the motel to complain that they’re out of hot water. Dude was in there for an
“Got a minute?” Dean poked his head into Sam’s room a couple of days after Claire left, then came all the way in when his brother nodded.
“Maybe we can move this inside?” Dean suggested. “I just spent five-plus minutes on the cold concrete in only a t-shirt and jeans.” He rubbed his chilled arms.
, he cursed silently and shook his head. “That’s not what I meant. Just … it’s fine, whatever you need to do to quiet the bond. Stare at me all night, hold my hand, whatever. Just, don’t wait until you’re about to pass out to touch me, okay? I mean it. Do whatever the bond wants.” Not trusting himself to look at his friend again, he turned on his side away from Cas and burrowed under the covers. “Night, Cas,” he murmured, and though the angel said nothing, he put his hand on Dean’s arm for a few moments, and that was almost as good.
He had avoided spewing all of this to Dean, who doesn’t handle emotional overtures terribly well; Sam calls it a combination of toxic masculinity and internalized homophobia, and Castiel has to agree after he’s researched the terms. So he’d graciously accepted the room, taking it for the token of familial love it was.
, other than maybe Sam or Bobby, should have been able to approach him in his sleep without him realizing.
Charlie dragged Dean away to ‘show him something that he absolutely had to see, seriously it was awesome!’
Eventually they broke apart, pulling back the few inches needed to breathe. Neither could make themselves go any further. Their foreheads pressed together, their bodies stayed firmly entwined, and for a while they just breathed.
He went to the Roadhouse, where he was greeted by Ellen and Jo with hugs and tears and smacks when he tried to apologise for their deaths (“Boy, you better not be taking credit for our sacrifice! That was us and only us you hear me!”).
Charlie met his eyes through the barrier, smiling sadly. “I’m sorry Dean.” She whispered. “But we had no choice.” With that, she left.
"There were people in my garrison who didn't even know who I was. Once, I remember, we were training, and Gabriel popped over to see me. I was near the back, far away from everyone, but I heard him ask some of the others where I was. 'Hey, you know where I can find Castiel?'. They looked at him blankly. Asked 'who?'. I'd been training with these people for...well, I don't know how long exactly since time didn't exist then, but a long time, and they didn't even know who I was."
The two boys who stumbled into the motel, injured and groaning, were running on adrenaline, caffeine and quite a large helping of stubbornness.
The two of them froze in that position, staring at the other with wide eyes. Castiel nervously wet his lips, causing Dean’s eyes to flick down to them for a moment before meeting his eyes again.
“I love you, I love you, I love you.” Dean chanted mindlessly, his face buried into Castiel’s neck, and the angel whispered the same chant back to him, voice muffled by Dean’s hair.
Dean nodded. “Bobby let it slip when I first got here. Jack pulled Cas back to help him redesign Heaven almost as soon as he got the job.” He swallowed heavily, but carried on, his voice no more than a whisper. “Cas didn’t want us to know Sam. He never planned on us finding out that he was alive.”
“I didn’t start speaking again until I was assigned to a flight. I had to speak then, I didn't have a choice. It was required, in order to accept and give orders and work with the others in your flight. But I didn't speak outside of that. I stayed a loner, I stayed on my own. I didn’t approach anyone, and eventually, I developed a reputation for it. I was the friendless mute who thought they were better than everyone else. And because of that I isolated myself more. It was a cycle, a vicious one, and when the earth was created, I fled to it. And guess what I found down there.”
“Let’s go back home, yeah?” Dean said after a moment, looking around his small family and feeling true happiness bubble up inside him for the first time in a while.
The angel smiled wryly, one hand tapping lightly on his knee. “I almost wish it had stayed like that. Afterwards, it all started up again. They’d bully me, team up and pin anything bad that happened on me. If something went wrong, it was always my fault. They’d mock me, insult me, pick on me. I was their plaything, their punching bag.” He sighed softly, his hand pausing in its tapping to absently raise up and rub lightly at his upper arm. “Gabriel always told me that they were just jealous, and to ignore them. That they didn’t like me because I was different, because I was better.”
The three words that echoed in his head as Dean cruised along down the road, barely paying attention as he rounded a corner without even slowing down.
“And I’m sure I’ll love him when he arrives.” Dean replied, patting Sam on the shoulder gently. Sam nodded, breathing out and leaning into his hand a little.
He was almost to his door when he heard a sound. It was quiet, soft, so soft that at first he thought he was hallucinating. Nevertheless, it made him stop for a second, frowning.
“Depends.” Dean replied, closing his eyes again. He was warm and comfortable, and there was no chance that Sam hadn’t seen, so there was no point trying to hide the position they were in. “How many pictures has Sam taken?”
“I mean, I’d always kinda expected it ya know. You being an angel and all. Higher being aren’t you, why’d you give a damn about two broken humans who keep breaking the world? We cursed everyone we touched, either scared them off or ended up killing them, obviously you’d leave at some point, but the way you did? I mean seriously Castiel, that was a douche move. You could have at least told us that you were leaving. Had to find out third hand that you didn’t want anything to do with us. Could have at least told us yourself ya know.”
“Stupid.” He muttered to himself, pulling the car to the side of the road and hunching over, his hands pressing into his eyes. “Stupid. What did you expect? He’s a freaking angel, Winchester. And now he’s back in Heaven, he’s back in his home, with his family. Why the hell would he spare a thought for a broken human who can’t even survive three weeks without him babying you?” Furiously, he brushed his tears away and straightened up, taking a deep breath and letting it out. There were people here he needed to see. People he needed to apologise to for a start.
Castiel smiled at him. A proper, joyful smile. Some part of Dean marveled at the beauty of that smile.
At first, they'd thought it was a witch. Hex bags were found near all the crime scenes, and that would explain the locked doors and strange circumstances of the deaths. As far as they thought, it was a cut and dry situation.
Sam nodded fondly. “Yeah. He does. He’s heard stories about both of you since he could listen. I think it became his goal. To live a life that you could be proud of him for. To be worthy to carry your names. He’s a good kid. Brave, selfless, caring, determined. He’s a warrior, but with a heart of gold.”
“Well yeah, you’re missing a pretty vital component.” Dean told him, to which the angel’s head snapped upwards.
The sudden noises woke Sam up instantly, and he shot up with a gun in his hands, only to blink at the two men groaning and rubbing their heads.
It took almost two days of the brothers and Bobby working together to find out what they were up against, and another two days to track down them down and kill them all.
“Good.” Sam muttered, before pulling away and clapping a hand on Jack’s shoulder. The other two pulled away as well, though Dean’s arm remained wrapped around Castiel.
“I don’t know,” Dean said in exasperation. He was tired and starting to itch from the lack of contact. “Zap up whatever sounds comfortable.”
Dean sticks mostly to very light teasing, though, and only when Cas isn’t feeling terrible, which is pretty much only first thing in the morning, or when they accidentally find themselves cuddling (Dean shudders every time he thinks the word, he does
“Do you want to be human, Cas?” This isn’t the first time Sam has wondered about this. He’s seen longing in Cas’s eyes many times, and it’s hard to know what exactly he’s longing for (besides Dean, that is).
Cas’s shoulders slumped in relief. “Thank you. Yes.” With a wave of his hand and a tingle in Dean’s brain, the big desk disappeared and was replaced by the smaller one that had been in the bedroom.
“We’re three smart guys with lots of smart friends. If it’s not in a book, someone will be able to figure out the answer. And, if we don’t … it doesn’t seem to be affecting your grace or your angelhood, right? I mean, it’d suck if you’re uncomfortable for the rest of your life, but it’s better than losing your grace, isn’t it?”
With no bag of his own, Castiel goes straight to the library. After conferring with Sam, he picks a stack of books and settles at the table with them. A short time later, Dean sits down next to him with a cup of jasmine tea, which Castiel takes gratefully. Dean gives him a little wink, then opens the closest book. Castiel’s chest and face heat at the glance, and he buries himself in the book he’s meant to be reading to hide it.
For once though, even with the relief, that one small point of contact wasn’t enough. He wanted to bodily curl up into Cas’s comforting presence. He wanted to put his arms around him, bury his head in Cas’s neck, and breathe him in slowly. He wasn’t sure if that was the bond talking, or his own feelings, and he was too scared to do the soul searching it’d take to find the answer. He’d been pushing it away for so long now, it was almost automatic at that point. So he pushed it away again, though he allowed the one small touch to continue. He breathed easier when he could feel Cas’s warmth.
All this was to say, if Dean knew all of this about Cas, then Cas must be able to read exactly how Dean was feeling in return, which meant he didn’t
Dean laughs and bumps his shoulder. “Aww, Cas, do you need me to throw some beaded necklaces at you?” When Cas gives him a confused glance, he shakes his head. “Never mind. Plus,” he adds, more seriously and too quiet, “I think they’re great.”
Castiel fumbles, unsure whether to continue. “I- your help has been invaluable. I truly don’t think I would have made it through this without you. You- your lov- uh, thoughtful care is very much appreciated.”
“Damn it. Is the next phase of this bond mimicking each other’s language?” Dean ducked, twisted, and kicked his leg out, but Cas easily side-stepped the move.
Dean took a deep breath. “It’s been getting harder not to, lately. Harder not to kiss you, not to tell you, not to hold you. And I guess tonight I realized that my need for those things outweighed my fear. Plus, you were really hot fighting that ghoul-pire.”
“Last Halloween we realized the full extent of our sons feelings to each other as the eight hour incident Dean went home crying he ruined his friendship forever and Castiel came home crying that Dean didn’t love him and didn’t want him anymore they were both drunk which was rather funny but the next morning they made up but it all happened...”
They didn’t realize they were even moving until Deans back was against the opposite wall from the door and wardrobe.
The Men looked on slightly confused “What do you mean dear” John asked “Oh darlin you clearly see that Dean is in love With Castiel I think me and Naomi have known longer than our boys have realized their own feelings” Naomi nodded on in agreement.
They walked into the school hand in hand after winter break and everyone was exited and delighted for them. AS where their friends.
Mary continued “Castiel walked on Dean Kissing Michel at the college party they went to last Halloween”
Before Michel could say anything on the matter, they heard a loud crash and extremely loud yelps from Castiels room and this time they thought someone was hurt so the adults bounded up the stairs and could only laugh at the scene they saw before them.
This time Castiel placed hand on Deans feminine hips he had always had but denied and liked to hide and pulled him in to kiss him again This time much better. They didn’t Bump noses or teeth in fact Dean didn’t know why but he let all control go to Castiel and normally Dean was a Dominant guy.
They couldn’t help but laugh which abruptly stopped as the bedroom door sung open to reveal to the two teenagers a hoard of adults and children and to the Adults revealed a very destroyed bedroom, Books layed on the floor shoes scattered by the wardrobe and a picture frame lying on the floor and two very horny teens by the looks of it.
Life was good Dean and Cas fought like most friends but the longest they had ever gone without talking was 8 hours. Their mums timed it. Sam was only two years younger than them and already Dating for two years a hot little blond girl names Jess who was also on the Mathletes with Cas and in Deans lunchtime club of science.
Castiel let out a predatory Growl one Dean had never heard before, not when resiling not when people called Dean dumb no this was pure sexual driven lust that came out of Cas’s mouth.
Michel is blushing something he rarely does Naomi continued “Yesss I remember Castiel saying something about Michel having a hand somewhere it shouldn’t be”
The video showed the moment the boys' shirts where pulled off as well as the kisses Castiel pressed to deans freckled golden kissed shoulders no matter the season Dean was always tanned and freckly.
“Cas” Dean let out a breathy moan as he felt hands on him. This time he decided to try and flip Cas back against the wardrobe just to see his reaction Dean felt rather good being slightly submissive something he would never say out loud it worked but Castiel was feeling rather dominant in this moment so flipped Dean back around landing them against the door this time.
“Well our phone certainly has the proof!” Sam said with a slight blush brushing over his cheeks Gabriel also had the sam blush which was surprising cos GAbe was normally the cheeky one.
“I am extremely happy to see you” they stared into each other's eyes again before Castiel lunged back in capturing Deans lips as his own once more. And in between kissed Castiel let out breathy moans and words.
Dean got the hint as he wrapped his legs around Cas waist as Cas held him up by the wall and his hands-on Deans perky bum.
It was a Saturday night and Cas planned to take Hanna to the movies which always meant kissing in the dark cinema. But because it was Saturday Deans family was round at the Novak's to have Saturday night dinner.
“Huh I always thought Dean would be the more Dominant one” John said outload Chuck nodding silently their wives looked at them and laughed out loud. They didn’t notice but Michel was snickering at the mention of Dean being Dominant.
Ten minutes after The boys left for the Winchesters house a knock came from the door it was Hanna coming to pick up Castiel “Hello Mrs. Novak is Cassie here we have a date”
At this point they were both moaning into each other's mouth as they touched each other anywhere they could reach. Deans waist his hips his upper and lower back, and Castiels arms and neck and hair.
Soon realizing they needed to breath as they pulled away. Both looked at each other not stepping back from the other as they couldn’t pull themselves away. Lips swollen, breath ragged, pupils blown and wide hair wild making both look ravished.
They always spent their Friday and Wednesday nights together as well doing and helping each other with homework before heading off to where they both worked at the Roadhouse with their friends Jo Ash and Benny, benny worked in the kitchen and Ash and Castiel worked the tables and Dean and Jo worked behind the bar. Both helping with tables when it got busy and Ellen would take over the Bar.
“Cas Cas stop a minute” Cas stopped scared Dean had changed his mind he buried his head into Deans neck “Cas its nothing bad babe your making me feel so good. I just want to know if you're ok with this with us, this isn't like Michel I want a date not just a once hook up I've liked you for a long time now”
Naomi never liked Hanna much so simply said “why no dear he's over at the Winchesters with Dean I believe by now Castiel has Dean pinned to a wall and fucking him bye now dear have a goodnight” Naomi closed the door promptly and smiled to herself.
“what party incident? I know about the lack of talking but what actually happened” The group looked around the women's eyes landed on Michel and smiled like the devils they were.
“would you mind that dean I mean I trust you do not laugh at me” Dean couldn’t belive he was saying yes! Even if this was the only time he ever got to kiss Castiel for the rest of his life he would be insanely happy about it.
Dean really didn’t want Cas going on his date tonight, but it didn’t matter, because here they were in Castiel Bedroom looking through every shirt he owned.
“Yes oh Dean we are so happy you will officially join the family someday and not that gold-digging girl Hanna! We like you so much better”
three teenagers stood outside the door getting ready to put their recording phone around the door to video whatever was going on in there. And when they pulled the phone back through the door crack, they were slightly shocked at what they saw. And rushed down to show their parents.
He had enough and pulled away and said in his naturally gravelly voice “Dean let me lead, Please?” Dean nodded
Castiel started kissing him hard and dean kissed back with just as much fight. Before Castiel ran his tongue along Deans' lips before given them a slight nip with his teeth, Dean couldn’t help himself as he let out a small moan.
Castiel held up good on his promise and fucked Dean all night long with some Pizza breaks in between, The Winchesters had stayed in the spare bedrooms at the Novak residence that night not feeling willing to listen to sex noises from them all night long no matter how happy they were for them.
A picture fell this time. The Brothers and sister downstairs got fed up now and needed to know what was going on. The parents just stared after them knowing their kids would come back for a report only Michael and lucifer stayed with the adults as they were both more adult than teenager.
Sam butted in with “ Won't be much sleeping so don’t break your bed as well cos you're not using any of ours”
They spent literally every day together other than the three hours after School on Tuesdays and Thursdays as Dean had baseball practice those days and Cas had mathletes on Tuesday and cross-country practice on the Thursday. Which was fine because they met up straight after and went to get dinner at the Roadhouse. They Both wanted to follow in the steps of their father, even though Dean did have the secret idea that only Cas and his Mom knew about which was opening a bakery. Either way Cas would always be Deans Accountant whether it be at the garage or at a self-owned Bakery.
Dean could hardly bare his best friend being away from him on their weekly dinners as two family's meaning , Castiel and his older brothers Gabriel Michael and Lucifer and their younger sister Anna then Sammy, Deans younger brother along with Naomi and Chuck and Mary and John.
They fought for Dominance for a few minutes before Dean let in and let Castiels tongue explore his mouth, Dean continued to play with the back of Castiels head of hair which was secretly driving Cas mad as he found it extremely pleasurable. Dean nipped at him which made Cas moan this time.
It turned from slow and casual to a little faster, hand started to move ever so slightly up Deans waist and sides, Deans grip on Castiels arms loosened only for his hands to start rubbing up his arms.
Hot breaths where coming out between them whenever they parted only ever so slightly to change the position of their lips.
Dean felt the hands on his arse give a squeeze and he let out a moan “Cas Cas do that again please hmm” Dean threw his head back. Castiel took this as an opportunity to attack Deans neck with light biting and kissing and some heavy sucking Dean gave another whine.
When they got back into a kiss Castiels legs hit the bed and causing them both to topple onto it all was fine if two 230ibs boys hadn't just fallen hard onto an already squeaky bedframe but they did and as they collapsed so did the bed.
“Well show us the phone then you three what are they doing up there I though Castiel was getting ready for his date?” Asked Naomi “Yes poor Dean had been so worked up and snippy all day since Castiel told him he wouldn’t be here for the whole night”
“Because I can't let you go out with her when you should be home with me and kissing me. I would like to think you agree seeing as there is either a stick in your pants or I'd say you were happy to see me”
It came out as a question almost as if asking Dean if he should still go or if he should cancel. No That’s exactly what he meant Castiel can't hid his own feelings anymore and secretly Dean felt the exact same.
The men could only nod “Dad you're ok with this? That I'm with a man?” Dean asked in a timid voice he always tried to be as manly as he could for his dads sake his Dad strode towards him and engulfed him in a hug “i could never be more proud of you” Dean let a tear slip before looking at Sam “Sammy?”
That’s when Dean said the stupidest most idiotic thing he had ever said in his life and he wanted to slap himself for it “you could practice on me I've kissed people before” Dean thought he heard Cas mumble under his breath with bitterness  “OH don’t I know it” no it was clearly his imagination.
It also played the moment Castiel lifted Dean onto his hips before grinding the hard crotches together and kissing even though it looked like a rehearsed dance routine one they had done many times. Before it went further the men pressed stop on the video “Chuck” “John” Their wives moaned out at the interruption.
They quickly found their pants and shirts and packed a bag for Castiel to stay the rest of the weekend. They headed downstairs and where instantly greeted in a hug by their respected mothers and then the others mothers.
John just nodded he had no issue with his son being Gay or whatever he was, He would prefer to not know which way his son is Top or Bottom but hey oh well
Both their mums got on famously and so did their dads, which meant if Castiel and dean did date they would be overjoyed in fact they all had a bet placed on it.
But when they came back the next morning Novak's in tow they were greeted by the most domestic sight ever Dean cooking stacks and stacks of pancakes bacon and eggs and a healthy omelet for Sam while Castiel stood behind him coffee next to them with his arms wrapped around deans bare waist and torso humming hey Jude while they cooked Cas steeling bits of bacon every now and then and Dean slapping him with a spatula.
“Cas you look massive, Can I, Can I touch?” Castiel nodded, Dean Moved forward again pulling Castiels cock out of his briefs “Babe you big” Castie was busy attacking Deans neck and shoulders leaving Kisses and hickeys all the way down.
Castiel removed Deans plaid and shirt before throwing his off as well leaving them both in just Jeans, Castiels tongue danced around Deans mouth caressing it. Castiel tapped the underside of Deans sides hinting for him to jump.
“Honey Dean Bakes pies and cakes and tarts and everything else, he nurtures and adores Sam, He Cleans the house, he cooks cos Im useless in the kitchen, He mothers all his friends, just because he likes cars and science and baseball does not make Dean completely Masculine”
They cleared out quickly closing the door behind them “Plan of action we will talk to our family's im then taking us back to your house and we are going to fuck all night long then order pizza when we are done, OK?” Dean could only nod his head in excitement.
Dean loved running his hand threw Castiels naturally messed hair and Castiel loved feeling Deans hands on bare skin. Infact he wanted to feel some of Deans as he lifted the back of Deans t-shirt and slipped his hand under.
“Cas just wear the blue shirt it brings out your eyes” Castiel turned around two shirts in hand a White plain t shirt or a deep blue colored shirt that mad his black jeans and eyes pop and stand out “Oh and you look at my eyes often do you” Cas teased without knowing how much those words hit dean.
The men looked horrified and so did the children. “Ew mom” “gross mum” was heard from the remaining children before heading back inside.
Dean and Castiel had known each other since they were 5 years old and their Dads met through work. Deans dad was a mechanic and Cas’s dad was the accountant for Johns Garage. So, their Dads introduced them at a summer BBQ that the Winchesters hosts every year for their Street and by chance the Novak's lived three doors down from them.
“YA know I was so jealous of that last Halloween Michel having his hand down your pants feeling your cock” Dean blushed His legs still wrapped around Cas “He wasn’t feeling my Dick Cas he was fingering me open” Another growl came out of Cas “Only I'm aloud to touch you there now mine I want you forever your mine”
“Well I wish they wouldn’t challenge this one.” Ellen sighed again, shaking her head, and thumping the bar angrily.
Bobby smiled wryly. “Never. In fact, I’m pretty sure they take the word ‘impossible’ as a challenge.”
John shook his head, placing a hand on Mary’s shoulder. “I don’t get it either. They’ve always been fine with just each other, I don’t understand why they’re being like this.”
“I didn’t know it was possible to be depressed in Heaven.” Ellen murmured quietly, her eyes fixed on the two figures leaning on the car outside. Her gaze rested on their stances, their positioning, the space that always lingered around them.
The others stared at them in disbelief. After a few moments where the older Winchesters stared back blankly, Bobby slowly shook his head.
Dean dragged his feet in the other direction, towards their room, the go-bag over his shoulder seeming to get heavier with every step.
Slowly, he went to move Dean’s head to rest against the pillow, so he could lie down properly, but as soon as he shifted, the hunter’s face screwed up and he clung to the angel.
“I guess I took the wrong message from that. Instead of being proud of who I was and standing up to the others I tried to fit in. I looked at what they did and I tried to copy them. It still didn’t work though, and I gave up. Became numb to it, became used to it. I think some part of me started believing that there was something wrong with me, that I deserved to be treated like that. That everyone else was right and I was wrong.”
Excitement and joy flashed across Sam’s face, before a small amount of hope joined. “Is - is Jack here?”
Sam spotted his expression and gave him a soft smile. “Don’t worry.” He said quietly. “My son knew all about his Uncles and his brother. You’d think he would have gotten sick of the stories, but he never did. He loved hearing about you.”
Castiel bit his lip, a thoughtful expression coming over his face. Then, softly, as though he was scared that Dean would change his mind, he began to sing.
“I love you too.” Castiel breathed against his lips, and a second later they were kissing again, and one or both of them were crying, and it was everything Dean had ever dreamed of and more.
The melody pulled at him, weaving around him and lulling him into some sort of trance. The pain from his injuries faded away to the back of his mind. There was a sort of musical undertone to the voice, almost like a flute, but surely that wasn't possible?
They both had bad days, and Dean showed Sam his grove pretty early on. It became an open secret that if the brothers disappeared, that was probably where you’d find them.
Eileen didn’t try to argue when she appeared. She knew how much the brothers meant to each other, and knew how much Dean’s absence had impacted her husband. She just moved in with them, and provided a strong shoulder for the brothers to rely on.
“When humans sing, they put their heart and soul into the music.” The angel whispered, his eyes focused on Dean. “They show their true emotions, and that makes their music special and beautiful. In Heaven, they just repeat what they’re told to, there's no feeling to it. That’s why human music is so much more than Heaven’s. That’s why it's so beautiful.” The angel smiled again. “And, I wanted to try that. I can’t express emotion very well, I don’t understand it, but...music I can do. So I wanted to see if I could show emotion through singing instead, to see if I could get even a fraction of the beauty of that music I heard.”
“Our best friend?” Dean told him, an exasperated look on his face. When Castiel gave him a blank, expecting look, he groaned. “You, you idiot!” He yelled, reaching forward and shaking the angel.
“Dean.” Castiel said firmly, cutting him off. The angel sank down opposite him. “Dean, no. No, you don’t understand. That’s not - I don’t - ” he sighed in frustration. “I wanted to come to you.” He said bluntly, tugging at his hair in a very human move. “As soon as Jack pulled me out, I wanted to go to you.”
At this, he stopped and took a deep breath. Dean gently squeezed his hand where his still rested on top of it, shoving down the instinct inside him that told him to go and punch every angel who even
The Angel swung around, panic and slight fear in his eyes as they landed on Dean's incredulous face.
, sometimes a constant ache that had him strangely silent and distant. Sometimes, there were days where he couldn’t think of anything else, when he turned to remark something to Sam, when he held something up to show it to Cas, when he found something and just
.” Charlie told them, throwing her arms up. “Dean and Sam may have only had themselves when they were younger, but ever since Dean was pulled from Hell, they found another. They’ve had their third for years now, and they won’t be at peace until they have him again.”
The first thing that Dean noted when he woke up was the warmth. He was surrounded on all sides by warmth and comfort, something that didn’t often happen with their lifestyle. He was used to cheap motel beds and sometimes even waking up inside the Impala, which - although he loved his baby - wasn't exactly the most comfortable place to sleep.
“In which case,” Castiel started, a smirk starting to form on his lips. “I might leave now, stay away for a few weeks, until it all dies down…” He started to move, as though he was about to fly away.
A grin spread over Dean’s face, and he put his bottle down, throwing a salute at Bobby. Then, he walked purposefully over to his car, sliding into the driver's seat.
Jack gave a shuddering sigh and clung to his fathers desperately. Cas slipped into the tangle silently, burrowing under Dean’s arm and wrapping his son up, hiding him away from the world.
The humans nodded slowly, and Jack smiled. “Good.” He said happily. “You summon Cas then, and get Dean there. Afterwards, I’ll erect shields so that neither of them can run away.”
He played video games and watched films with Charlie, who squealed and pounced on him for a hug when she saw him, before pulling off and starting to hit his arm repeatedly, yelling about how stupid he was over her death before suddenly dragging him away for a binge session (“Heaven has the best signal reception, honestly, it’s incredible!”)
