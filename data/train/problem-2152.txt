car in sight. Not one mobile. Not one screen. Everything smells like horse and piss and fog. He closes his eyes, takes another fortifying deep breath, and then glances at the building from which he’s just exited.
Glancing sharply at Mike, whose countenance is as blandly congenial as always, John says, “Excuse me?”
“Have I been kidnapped and stowed away in a fucking museum?” John demands, just as the bedroom door swings open and a man breezes in. John isn’t sure whether he or the man is more startled by the other’s presence.
A black mood rapidly descends upon Sherlock, which only blackens further as he stands and quickly stalks around the flat, observing several key, alarming details—most notably that what should be his empty spare room has been suddenly furnished. He returns to the drawing room and takes a seat across from the woman, brows furrowed and fingers steepled under his chin.
Adler always thought it was her skin in which she was uncomfortable. But then Watson arrived, and she wondered: What if the problem were, in fact, instead the time?
Sherlock finds himself unable to muster sufficient interest in his guest to stand, so he remains on the floor.
Some days he reaches for the journal. He’ll open to a random page and tap his pen against it and feel the mounting frustration and despair as he comes to the same inescapable conclusion: What has he to write about? Nothing. Not like anything ever happens to him. He’ll lose an hour or four staring at the crisp white pages mocking him.
Everything about the woman is sharp and dangerous. Her eyes are unkind and her thighs against his sides are unyielding and her hand holding the penknife is steady. He’s fairly certain he could throw her off without undue injury to himself (and he’d be completely confident in his ability to do so if not for his bum leg). But, well, she’s also—
Sherlock goes on with his life and his work. He had managed to avoid having his picture taken by the press during the opera house affair, but his name is in the papers for weeks. His clientele does experience a notable upswing, thank you brother dear. Never enough work, though. Always too many stretches of nothing in between.
Though for the life of him he couldn’t say why, despite the immediate threat and the fact that he’s in a wholly unfamiliar bedroom, he finds himself calming. Perhaps it’s the relief of finally having a tangible enemy after months of having only his own mind to fight.
Detective Lestrade!—tips his hat at Sherlock with a, “Mr Holmes,” and then at John with a, “Mr Adler. I look forward to reading about this one.” And then he is on his way.
The scene around him is right out one of those documentaries of Victorian England that Harry liked to sigh over, like the backwards technology and morals were romantic. Gas lamps and horse-drawn carriages and every last man, woman, and child in period clothing. Not
, Holmes was a man smitten with life and knowledge and who loved using his passions to help people. He was
He looks up; the woman is studying him through the upstairs window. He doesn’t see the man, but he hears hurried footsteps.
When they’ve finally calmed, John takes a moment to take in the building in front of them. He reaches out and brushes his fingers over the raised building numbers. 221b. It's a museum now—or, well, will one day be, at any rate—because Sherlock Holmes had had enough of a following among historians to get the place preserved as a landmark. John only visited the once, as a boy. He'd wanted to sit in the armchair and imagine he was
That Irene Adler was not in fact killed, and Sherlock not only knew but is living with her. He would be utterly discredited. He would never work again.
sex talking, it is taking an inordinate amount of willpower to not simply say to hell with whatever is going on and make a valiant attempt to climb this man like a tree. The man who has probably kidnapped him, or at least helped to kidnap him, for reasons John can’t fathom. But it’s difficult to give that knowledge proper weight given the unexpected and sudden reignition of John’s libido.
. He barely cares about money. If 221b Baker Street ever stretches his finances over-far, he’ll seek out someone interested in a flat-share, or else, more likely, hold his nose and call upon Mycroft, for who would want to share a flat with him?
John keeps marching and the man keeps following, until they reach a railway bridge on Fleet Street near Ludgate Hill that John knows for a fact hasn’t existed for at least 20 years and it’s just
But as ever there are no answers, and he irritably waves his hand through the air, dispelling the words from his mind.
“That was—” John gaps when he can finally draw a breath, “Good lord, that was the craziest thing I’ve ever done.”
For a moment, John doesn't think she'll respond. Then: “This time suits me ill. From what I've heard, your time sounds...more accommodating.”
attempts to talk about his cases. But soon enough Sherlock’s name becomes known far and wide and he has more clients ringing the doorbell than with which he knows what to do, so he has no inclination to complain.
Sherlock smiles softly at the floor. Then he closes his eyes and raises his instrument and begins to play.
“Holmes!” the woman calls again, her fingers drumming an impatient beat against the bedpost. “For god’s sake, Holmes, if you don’t come here this instant I shall be forced to take drastic measures. Perhaps I’ll write Mycroft.”
In his old life, John would already be half in love. But John isn’t that person anymore, and his eyes dart between the ceiling and her face and absolutely no lower and he’s almost relieved she’s got his arms pinned because otherwise he honestly doesn’t know what he’d do with his hands.
“Oh, please,” Adler says dismissively. “Don't give yourself too much credit, Doctor. In fact, give yourself none until you’ve earned it. Did you take notes?” She attempts to push the clothing onto John, but Sherlock immediately intercepts her.
“Quite all right,” Sherlock answers. Perhaps not as sincerely as he’d intended, given how Stamford frowns. “I’d be better if you had anything of interest for me.”
When he hears the front door at the bottom of the stairs open, for a moment his heart leaps. But no, it will not be a client. Clients’ footsteps are uncertain or agitated or hurried or otherwise distinct. And clients rarely have keys to invite themselves in. It’s not Mrs Hudson (the footsteps are too heavy) or Inspector Lestrade (the footsteps are too light) or Mycroft (he probably doesn’t fit through the front door). The footsteps are measured as they ascend the seventeen stairs; confident. Pace as unhurried and confident as if the person were already home.
Later, after Adler has explained herself and Harry has failed to believe a word she says, Harry nevertheless lets her stay because “I could never resist a pretty face.”
John’s mouth had slowly dropped open during this relentless onslaught of observations. It takes too long to realise he’s lightheaded because he was holding his breath again.
Later he is returned to Baker Street, on his back on the drawing room floor and his violin loose under his chin. There is still assorted gore under his fingernails from his unsatisfying experiment.
When Adler asks John about the future, on a random Wednesday afternoon in September, it is the first and only time she takes an interest. John has never been able to fathom what motivates her. Still can't actually tell whether she and Sherlock enjoy each other's company, despite
John’s spiralling thoughts grind to a halt. He blinks once, twice. John lowers his arm and turns to the man, who appears expectant.
As he does, with no further regard for his presence, she takes the newspaper from the table beside her, shakes it open, settles herself further in the chair, and begins reading. He tracks her eyes and notes it is no ruse; she is genuinely focused on the paper. She pauses a moment to ring the bell for Mrs Hudson.
John's initial motivation to pursue his doctorate may have been based on the thought that if there are indeed men like Sherlock Holmes still around, and if he should ever have the good fortune to meet one, what they really need by their side is a man with a solid head on his shoulders who knows how to patch a wound as well as to create one. Not some useless, sarcastic, perpetually unimpressed bystander like Adler, who seemed to spend more time despairing of and disparaging Sherlock Holmes than being of any assistance.
“Possible, though I've yet to hear of it and I take it upon myself to keep abreast of such trends. Very useful knowledge. In addition, there is the fact that two weeks past I was written by a man named Gerhard Stone who professed to be an absolute wreck due to his younger brother, whom he suspected of being in some sort of society of questionable repute. He feared the society’s activities veered into the illegal, given his brother's guarded attitude whenever Mr Stone attempted to question him. After following his brother one afternoon and watching him appear, for all intents and purposes, to be begging on a street corner, Mr Stone seemed to fear more for whether his brother’s behaviour could tarnish his own reputation than whether his brother was in any danger, and frankly the case hadn’t intrigued me and I declined to take it. There had, however, been a single point of interest which stayed with me: Mr Stone had most distinctly noted his brother’s sudden penchant for ribbons of unusual colour.”
“A victory few have claimed,” Holmes acknowledges. “And, I assure you, one that no one has claimed twice. What do you want?”
. Just a thin dressing gown around her shoulders that does more to emphasise her nudity than conceal it. She is beautiful. Slender, with wide shoulders and strong thighs against his sides and her breasts bound tightly with cloth but unmistakably there and right above his nose. Her hair is cut short and gelled flat. She holds the penknife like a woman used to threatening men with severe bodily harm.
Most accounts say that such a lonely end was fitting and unsurprising for such an aloof man. Adler often characterised him as a machine—an unfeeling man who craved and loved nothing but his work.
“Since when do you care what anyone thinks of you?” the woman murmurs, but the man ignores her in favour of holding out his hand. “Sherlock Holmes, at your service.” John, also on reflex, shakes the man’s hand. John doesn’t know if it’s him or the man, bafflement or something else, that causes the handshake to linger a moment too long.
. Which is rubbish, as far as John's concerned; the stories have the exact correct amount of sentiment and Sherlock and Adler would admit the same if they weren't such arses. Adler stops writing her own stories; in fact stops accompanying Sherlock on his cases altogether, which would've made John sick with guilt if not for the fact that both she and Sherlock appear happier that way. Adler offered to take John's stories to her publisher, but John declines. These stories are for him—no, they're for Sherlock, whom he sometimes catches sitting cross-legged on the sitting room floor, the box in which John keeps his manuscripts in front of him, and sifts through the pages with a soft smile on his face.
The one part of John's time that Sherlock truly appears to detest is it's view on smoking and recreational drug use. On one memorable day, John systemically finds and throws away Sherlock's cigarettes and pipes and drugs and launches a campaign to convince him to stop those terrible habits and prevent him from replenishing his supplies. John doesn’t make much progress until the day after, when he's stalked by three frightening men in dark suits, who manage to catch him off guard and stuff him in the back of a hansom (not before he knocks one of them out cold, thanks much) and bring him to a large, cold manor and seat him before a large, cold man with thinning hair and a sour expression. John's mouth goes dry when he recognises him. Mycroft Holmes offers John a large sum of money to leave and never return (to which John replies, “No thanks”) and then an even larger sum of money to keep him abreast of Sherlock's every move (to which John replies, “Well, you can go right to hell.”). And when John refuses to budge, Mycroft summarily dismisses him and John is dragged back into a hansom and kicked out a few blocks from Baker Street. John would have a lot to say about Mycroft Holmes, except later that day he's suddenly got the Irregulars and Scotland Yard and Sherlock's own suppliers on his side in his effort to keep Sherlock clean. “Your brother's an interesting fellow,” is all he'll say when Sherlock asks.
“I have absolutely no idea,” Sherlock says. He smiles then, a wild, feral, blindingly joyful smile, and John cannot help the answering grin that stretches across his face even as Sherlock asks, “Do you want to find out?”
present forever from his mind—dismiss that as a mad, drawn-out fantasy world and this as the normal reality—except that certain differences keep creeping in, inescapable, and John cannot help but recognise and comment on them and then be momentarily thrown from this dream that is more lifelike than life.
“I can't—this is too—it can't be real,” John babbles, his breath hitching, overcome with shame at his own cowardice. “I couldn't face—and it's everything I've ever wanted and I don't
Though she would have never admitted it to Holmes, Adler always believed in the ghost of the Opera House. She may not have been one of those flighty fellows breathlessly gossiping about what the ghost had done the night before, but Adler had spent hours of every day in that house, had performed there for years, and trusts her eyes and ears and senses. There was a ghost in that house, she would swear to it.
John may have once been embarrassed about how much Sherlock Holmes meant to him, back when he was younger and stupider and didn’t know just how insignificant a thing like that rated when compared against all the ways the world can break a man down.
Some days he takes out the Sig Sauer. He’ll strip it down and clean it thoroughly and reassemble it with ease, his hands swift and sure with muscle memory while his mind drifts away. He'll think about his Hippocratic oath and how natural the gun feels in his hand. He'll lose a bit of time just considering the weight of the metal and comparing it to the weight in his mind. Thinking. But that always gets tucked back away, too. Sometimes with more reluctance than he’s willing to admit.
Adler comes and goes as she sees fit, but John stays, helping Sherlock to cases and writing copious notes that turn into narratives to which both Sherlock and Adler turn their noses up because they're too
“Ah. Are you secretly among her admirers, then? Or perhaps not so secretly at all?” At Mycroft's sour frown, Sherlock shakes his head. “No, brother, I beseech you to beseech someone else.”
“Oh, good!” she says, casually stepping over him and seating herself on the nearby settee. “You’re returned. I confess when Mrs Hudson said these spells of yours can last for days I thought her to be exaggerating.”
When John returns inside, his thoughts jumbled, Sherlock is standing by the window with his violin. An older woman is setting out a tray of tea. “That will be all, Mrs Hudson, thank you,” Sherlock says. The woman—Mrs Hudson!—smiles fondly at John, without seeming at all bothered or surprised by John's presence, and then takes her leave.
“I should sincerely hope so.” When Sherlock offers no further terms, she sets aside the paper and leans forwards, something calculated in her expression. “Well,” she says. “Now that that’s settled—I’m most curious about the resolution of this Musgrave Ritual.”
She raises an eyebrow, and once Sherlock’s instinctive alarm abates, her meaning abruptly crystallises.
Sometimes when Adler is not around, Sherlock will reread her latest story. They are...interesting. He cannot fault her attention to detail or focus on the puzzle at hand. However, Sherlock is most arrested by the Sherlock Holmes seen through Adler’s eyes.
—activities in the name of solving a case. Fourteen possible ends to that sentence present themselves immediately, and a moment’s further thought nearly doubles the number. Eliminating the matters Sherlock personally deems trivial but others might consider a scandal still leaves an unfortunate 10, of which eight the woman could’ve gained knowledge of via her apparently fast rapport with the thoroughly charmed Mrs Hudson. Four of these matters would see him imprisoned, and one would have Sherlock hanged by the neck so quickly that not even Mycroft could intervene in time; and round and sedentary his brother may be, near nothing in London travels faster than a message penned by that hand.
Adler may not have initially believed Doctor Watson to be from another time, but when the evidence piled up, she was ready to believe it.
? Follow Sherlock Holmes around like a lost puppy? He knows a bit about the period but hardly enough to get by.
And though John inwardly groans, maybe it’s for the best that the front door opens and Adler, with a huff, ushers them both inside while grumbling under her breath about idiots who would be lost without her.
The man has not even blinked at the woman’s nudity but he examines John with an intensity that makes John’s ears burn. Up to this point John had been fairly certain that he was not the naked person in this room, but even he is having doubts and actually glances down at himself to double check.
While Adler became a constant presence in his life, she sometimes disappears for weeks at a time—sometimes in a three-piece suit, other times in a flowery dress and wig. The latter seems an unreasonable risk to Sherlock, but she assured him, “You’re the only one who would notice, and you already know,” and has yet to be proven wrong.
“Why in heavens not? I would’ve said this is the greatest kindness you have ever seen fit to bestow upon me.”
His guest reaches his floor and walks towards Sherlock, steps muffled by the thick rug covered in cigarette ashes and various chemical residues despite Mrs Hudson’s heroic attempts at cleaning. He listlessly turns his head to examine his guest.
“And you travelled here from the future!” Sherlock wheezes, which just sets them both off again. They get surprisingly few stares, but if Sherlock's actual reputation is anywhere near as eccentric as it is in the books—and John is fairly certain, if anything, Adler
Certainly no one who both knows him well enough to know his preoccupation with Sherlock Holmes and would go to this trouble for—what? A laugh?
Sherlock will never understand what compelled her to transform one of his cases into a written narrative, nor what compelled the
“What the bloody hell is going on?” he manages, the words still sleep-rough. He swallows, feeling the press of the penknife against his jugular.
Sherlock, himself, is on his back on the floor, eyes closed, in loungewear and his dressing gown. He holds his Stradivarius in one hand, the instrument loose under his chin, and his bow in the other, now and then playing a string of notes as he replays his latest case in his mind and mourns the subsequent lack of the slightest matter of interest since.
“Not the most observant man, Inspector Lestrade,” Sherlock muses. “And yet, sadly, one of the best Scotland Yard has to offer.” John can only shake his head and following Sherlock back to 221b Baker Street, the both of them grinning at one another the whole way.
She tilts her head and studies him with an intensity and harsh intelligence that John does not care for in the slightest. Then apparently reaching a decision, she removes the penknife from his throat to tap against her own cheek, humming thoughtfully to herself. “You really haven’t any idea, do you?” she says. “What a curious morning.” With startling grace she swings off of him and stands, and John quickly scrambles upright himself, not liking her looking down at him. “Are you one of Holmes’, perchance?” She tilts her head towards the bedroom door and shouts, “Holmes!”
Holmes plays a few measures of a Wagner, transitions to a touch of Tchaikovsky, and then segues to one of his own unfinished compositions.
Later, Adler will discover that no stories of Holmes past her own were ever published and become preoccupied with finding Watson's manuscripts. Knowing she cannot truly move on until she has laid this matter to rest.
He just listens to the music. To its crispness and liveliness. The promise of adventure and excitement and happiness and everything John has ever wanted. His heartbeat calms, his shoulders lose their omnipresent tension, and he nearly smiles.
“I do wish you would reconsider,” Mycroft says, his generous bulk so firmly settled into his expensive armchair he may plan to never stand again. “She was the prima donna of the Imperial Opera. Widely beloved for her powerful voice, her charm and wit, and her beauty. The suddenness and violence of her untimely demise is no small matter.”
John turns onto another street and doesn’t spot a single seam in this absurd facade. Two more blocks, and he demands, “What’s your name?”
hero of yours. While we appear to be roughly of an age—though I'm likely a few years younger—and I flatter myself to think of myself as a competent detective even at a tender age, the odds of your having knowledge of my childhood exploits is near nonexistent and you specifically cited Adler’s stories, which have only been in publications for ten years. I hardly think childhood heroes are acquired by men in their twenties.” The man finally takes a breath, and John gasps in a breath, too, unaware he'd been holding it while the man talked, faster and faster. “Then, obviously, there is the matter of your watch.”
“On the contrary. I am quite enthralled,” the man says. “Just concerned my time is off. What time do you have, if I may ask?”
And then Sherlock will lightly touch John's shoulder or elbow or side to draw his attention, or hover over John as he attends to his patient, or sit besides John on the settee, feet on the cushion seat and his arms around his legs and his chin on his knees, and command, “Tell me how it is in your future,” and ask question after question, his focus on John unwavering.
But again John cuts him off. “Who arranged this, damn you both? Was it—was it...” But then John stops, because there is no end to that sentence.
“Can’t say that I do. And I’d say I wish I did, except that would mean wishing something awful on someone else, wouldn’t it?”
“If you’d been in any condition for a civilised conversation four days ago, there may have been a discussion.” She licks her finger and casually turns a page. “But you were not, and so there was not, and as the only person whose mind was capable of rational thought I made a decision on both our behalves. Besides, it would be far too much of a bother to move my affects at this point.”
When he's made his way back to the suffocating safety of his little flat, he eats a quick meal that’s dust in his mouth, washes up, and then opens his desk drawer and considers:
And as the years pass, and their uneasy companionship continues, and Sherlock feels a coldness seep into his bones even as his devotion to his work borders on the fanatical, Sherlock is never certain whether he sets out to emanate the man in the stories or whether Adler was able to see something about Sherlock before he saw it in himself.
“I have no doubt that what you say is true,” Sherlock says, settled much less indelibly in his own armchair across from his brother’s. Sherlock’s fingers tap restlessly against the arms. “None of it necessitates my services. I cannot see what of the matter necessitates
John takes a deep breath. He has often been told that he has something of a temper. He doesn’t like to think of himself as an angry bloke; he know for a fact he is an entirely even-tempered man who simply is far too often pushed beyond the limits of reason.
Mycroft takes a deep breath, his expression clearly smoothing through sheer force of will. One who does not know him would think he is moments from conceding. Sherlock is not such a person, and so he waits for Mycroft's next move. Mycroft studies the view outside his study window and allows the silence to drag far past the threshold of Sherlock's tolerance, and then he says, “You haven’t had a case in some time, I believe.” Sherlock’s fingers still, hearing every last word that Mycroft does not say about the burgeoning (and heretofore largely unsuccessful) career to which Sherlock has stubbornly dedicated himself. And then the fatal blow: “I worry, you know.”
Irving Adler was by most accounts a promiscuous scoundrel, but towards the late eighteen nineties he appeared to become taken with and faithful to a mysterious and unidentified blonde-haired woman. Is
, they seem to say. A hollow man who can’t fill up his own mind, let alone have enough left over to write down. He’ll return the journal, as blank as ever, and slam the drawer shut. He’ll think briefly about making an angry call to Ella, telling her that her advice is shite, but he won’t actually bother to. She’ll just be infinitely calm and reasonable and try to persuade him to make another appointment, and he’s had quite enough of that, thanks.
and it was the time in which he lived, the people around him, that forced him to ever act otherwise.
One hour later, Billy the Irregular shows up with the cane John had borrowed from Sherlock. John gives him one of the biscuits left by Mrs Hudson and makes him wash his hands.
“It does not matter what she promised you or you to her. You are under no obligation to stay,” Sherlock says.
He can feel the man hovering in the doorway behind him. There aren’t many photos of the real Sherlock Holmes around, but the bloke is a dead ringer. So, well done whoever-the-hell. John spent a not inconsiderable amount of his formative years considering those few photos of Sherlock Holmes. And he instinctively—absurdly—wants to hear the man out, just because his face is even better in real life and does funny things to John’s stomach. John wants to do a lot of other things to the man involving wine and a bed, but that part of John has been dead and silent for so long now that it damned well isn't getting the reins now. Especially since this man could be a murderer for all John knows.
An almost boyishly delighted grin slowly lights the man’s face. It turns his untouchable beauty into the sort of beauty that John’s fingers itch to touch. The argument being posed by his libido instantly increases in insistence (and appeal).
“Christ,” John says. “Did you rob an antique shop?” But he takes the cane all the same. It’s just as heavy as it looks. He manages a grudging, “Thanks, mate,” without bothering to overthink whether he should be sparing any pleasantries for his maybe-kidnappers who may intend to be his murderers, before turning around and trudging down the stairs.
The woman and man are staring at him now, the former like he’s a circus animal failing to do anything clever and her interest is rapidly waning and the latter like he’s already witnessing the best performance he’s ever seen.
John snorts and without thinking gives the other man a light shove. He quickly withdraws his hand and means to apologise, but Sherlock just appears delighted by John's unthinking familiarity.
When he was a lovesick fool doting on his latest girlfriend or boyfriend, when he was pissing about with the rugby lads, when he got that Dr before his name and knew he was going to make the world a better place.
. That would be just great, thanks.” When neither immediately answers, he continues, “Is this a joke, then? Is this supposed to be
Before John can react to that astonishing statement, she leaves (she never, in fact, returns). She believes him. She believes that John isn't from this time—if for no reason than that John doesn't have the imagination for anything else to be true. And, frankly, she's absolutely right.
The nights John manages to sleep, he dreams of gunfire, constant and deafening. He dreams of heat, oppressive and suffocating and so heavy it's a physical force pressing him into the ground. He dreams of sand, irritating and rough, of blood, and of biting, blinding pain. His heartbeat echoes in his ears. He can feel the metal barrel of his gun in his hand and smell death and violence in the air. He is so fucking tired. He’d give anything for just one night of peace—to escape the war for just one night.
But John can’t stop the flow of words, even though he's presumably talking over their attempts to answer him. “So—what? I wake up in the company of my childhood hero and I’m supposed to—what? Play along? Right, fine. Sure. I can do that. Lots I've always wanted to say to you both. Hey, Mr Definitely the Real Sherlock Holmes, here’s a thought: lay off the cocaine and morphine, you absolute
“Shouldn’t that be my warning to you? After all, I’ve already got the best of you once, if you’ll kindly recall.”
If it’s not a dream, and if it cannot possibly be real life, where does that leave him? He’s never felt so sober in his life and in his experience hallucinations are neither so logical nor so historically accurate. He could simply be going insane.
And so begins John's strange and wonder new life—a surreal whirlwind of thrilling or puzzling or intrigue-filled cases punctuated by quiet moments of achingly lovely domesticity, the likes of which John has never before known or experienced. Hadn't known
A heavy pause, then Sherlock clears his throat and says, “Such an arrangement would suit neither of our inclinations.” John is fascinated to see his ears have turned a little red.
The woman straddling his chest, her thighs pinning his arms securely to his side and her hand holding a penknife to his throat, clicks her tongue and shakes her head. “I would be still, darling, or you are liable to do yourself grave injury.”
But someone arranged all of this. Someone went to patently absurd lengths to dump him in a room perfectly suited for Victorian London with a man calling himself Sherlock Holmes and a woman calling herself Irving Adler. And if this isn’t just a joke in remarkably poor taste arranged by someone close to John, then—well.
They’re a few steps from the door when John can’t hold back anymore—he bursts out laughing, and the sound must set Sherlock off, who starts laughing just as deeply, and they’re both laughing and holding onto each other for support like a couple of drunken fools.
“Aren’t you curious,” the woman says. She smiles, sharper than the penknife. “If you hadn’t gathered, that is the precise question whose answer I am awaiting with baited breath from
John moves to inspect the pictures. The room itself and everything in it has a strange weight, a solidness to the construction that is foreign and yet somehow comforting. He strongly feels that everything he's looking at should be dim and buried in a solid inch of dust, but there’s sunlight through the window and—he runs a finger down the nearest frame—not a speck of dust to be found.
One day, during one of the loathsome times when he is without work, he decides to alleviate his boredom by repurposing a few corpses at Bart’s for an experiment he has been meaning to pursue. On his way to the morgue, he passes the chief of medicine, Michael Stamford, who asks, “Everything all right there, Holmes?”
Life is more perfect than John could've ever imagined possible, if he ignores the lingering dread undercutting every single moment that every day since he arrived has been too good to be true.
It is a pretty piece of blackmail. Sherlock would admire it if not for his deep distaste for blackmailers, having seen the destruction too often left in their wake. If he set his mind to it, he could ruin her first.
He doesn't know how long he sits there until there's a clatter and hurried steps and then Sherlock is there, kneeling before him, warm and close. He frames John's face with his long-fingered hands and presses their foreheads together. “Breathe, John,” he commands.
John crumbles and ends up being the dressing screen and emerges in a three-piece suit and a bowler hat. He can't remember the last time he felt so—formal. Even though it's what half the men on the street had been wearing. He tugs on the waistcoat and adjusts his shirtsleeves and feels—put together. Sharp. Actually quite all right. He thinks he could get used to this kind of clothing, especially when he emerges from the bedroom and Sherlock's eyes immediately darken at the first sight of him.
The war moves around him, with men and women in ragged camo continuing to shout and aim and fall. But they’re muted, the sounds muffled and the vibrant details rapidly washing out.
with barely a thought. The whole thing is insane, absolutely mad, and at the end of the chase they end up, Inspector Lestrade in tow, at a secret luxurious clubhouse hidden in the lower vault of a warehouse, where high society men routinely meet and compete with one another in different dangerous or strange activities, gambling on the outcome. Competing members wear ribbons, of course. And the most recent competition is, of course, to do with begging.
“Before you think me inexcusably rude, allow me to introduce myself, though I would venture that if you are here you are well aware of who I am,” the man says.
John stomps towards what appears to be the way to the front door but pauses at the top of the stairs. He huffs, his left hand clenching and unclenching, and turns back towards the lunatics, both of them still watching him. “Where in the hell is my cane?” he demands.
A society of beggars? Why does that sound familiar? John frowns and risks another glance back at the man, and then it suddenly clicks: “The amateur mendicant society,” John gasps.
His fingers spasm against the bridge wall and it’s two aborted attempts before he can bring his hand, trembling even more than usual, to gingerly press against the base of his skull.
of Victorian London around him and the press of people passing by, none of whom are paying them the slightest mind. As if this extraordinary place they are in and the extraordinary thing he has just witnessed are commonplace. “You,” he says, but then he doesn't know how to end that sentence. “That was,” he starts again, except again he doesn't have further than that planned. He rolls his shoulders and keeps looking around but then keeps returning his attention to the man waiting expectantly in front of him. A third attempt, and this one is right to the heart of the matter: “You're Sherlock Holmes.” The man's eyebrows raise. “This is—”
“Thank you for your assistance, good sir,” Irene Adler says, because it is unmistakeably her. She tips her wide-brimmed hat, turns on her heels, and is out of sight before Sherlock can gather himself to say a single word.
John Watson will always have Sherlock Holmes, and for as long as he wants him, Sherlock Holmes will always have John Watson in return. And if it doesn't matter
“Absolutely.” John shakes his head. And it's insane, everything about this is insane, but there's only so much proof a bloke can ignore. “You’re Sherlock Holmes.” He spreads his arms. “This is—my god, this is real. This is—You’re
It's the first time he's called John by his first name instead of Watson or Doctor, and the surprise more than anything is enough to shock John into gulping in a lungful of air. But the shaking and aches and terror persist. Sherlock has the prettiest eyes, John thinks, somewhat hysterically.
The nightmare fades and John is home. He knows it with more surety than he has ever known anything before. He is home, and for once he sleeps soundly, deeply—dreamlessly, but for the violin notes playing in the peripherals of his mind, an impenetrable shield against the shadows that might otherwise creep back in.
to have come up with the future you tell Holmes about. And you're not getting your information from someone else. So tell me how you did it.”
Adler emerges not long after in a floral dress with a high neck and flared skirt, as well as a long blonde wig. As she bustles around the room, gathering her things, she instructs, “Take lots of notes of everything you see and hear, even if you don't think it's important. If you forget something Holmes will have remembered it, but then I'll have to catch him in a talkative mood, and why torture us both? Keep Holmes busy but do try not to let him get too sure of himself. If his head gets any larger he won't fit through the front door. You may lodge in my room, if you'll be needing two rooms.” John hears a strangled noise and genuinely isn't sure whether it came from him or Sherlock. She continues as if she heard nothing, “But if upon my return my room is in any sort of disarray, any of my things missing, or my personal affects rummaged through, I'll flog you myself and quite enjoy doing so. When Billy or any of the other boys come by, you're to make sure they take their shoes off at the door and offer them a bite to eat. Make sure they wash their hands and faces before leaving—they're moan about it, but you ignore them and their wide eyes. They're brats, the lot of them. Any questions?”
John hadn't actually registered how closely they were standing until he is able to feel Sherlock still. “Is discretion no longer a virtue in the future?”
to publish the work, nor what compelled anymore to read it and—most confoundedly—clamour for more. Certainly Sherlock only ever gets glazed eyes whenever
John is—well, he’s obviously gone entirely round the bend. Because he chuckles too, and feels lighter than perhaps he's ever felt, and he is fairly certain that this is eighteen-ninety-something and he is standing next to
—he is, but sure enough there's a man precisely as Sherlock described. “Yeah, I see him. What about him?”
With Sherlock's obligation completed, he calls for a hansom to begin his journey home. He is settled and about to signal the driver to move when there's a knock on the window. He pulls aside the curtain and sees a woman in a veiled hat. She lifts the veil and Sherlock is faced with—
“Oh.” John tries to tamp down the immediate swell of disappointment. For Christ's sake, he may have just
Business had picked up since the opera house affair, true, but not nearly to the degree necessary to keep a mind like Sherlock’s sufficiently occupied. The resulting paycheque has kept him housed and fed, even allowed him to leave his disastrous flat on Montague Street. But the resulting calls for his services have been tiresome at best. Lords and dukes and sheikhs and other notables whose problems are petty and obvious. He does not have any interest in
The man has slicked-back midnight hair, a sharp nose and sharper cheekbones, and is dressed in loose lounge pants and a dressing gown tied tightly around his narrow waist. A violin dangles carelessly from one hand. He is an achingly classic beauty. While this could just be the fact that John's adrenalin is running high and it’s been so long that John doesn’t even
“I swear it. I swear to you. I am real, and so are you. And you know I do not tell untruths. I swear it, you understand. Breath in and out, John. Focus.” When his shaking has finally subsided, Sherlock repeats, “I swear it on my life,” and John—
John looks at the suit in his hands. And then to Sherlock, who is apparently too busy suddenly sulking to offer any help. “Why, exactly, am I doing this?”
John has really had enough of being ordered about by her, but, well, he has agreed to her arrangement. Which only entails his dearest fantasy coming true. There is that. So he does as she instructed but can't help but ask, more to himself than to her, “Why am I doing this?” as he opens the front door for her.
John, frankly, thinks that's bollocks. He's read the stories forwards and backwards, and if you ignore Adler's editorialising and focus on what Holmes actually
Within a day Sherlock conclusively proves the murderer to be one of the house’s regular patrons. The local police arrest the man, finding copious evidence at his residence, the day after.
,” John says. He has had enough of this and he is leaving before he can be either murdered or persuaded into doing something ridiculous. And if the man or woman attempt to stop him, well, that would be damned stupid of them. John may not be good for much these days but he can break every bone in a man’s body while naming them, thank you very much.
“...My apologies, Doctor,” Sherlock says, sounding so genuinely contrite that any irritation John may have felt vanishes and he gives Sherlock an encouraging smile. Clearly bolstered, Sherlock steps back and throws himself into an armchair, allowing John to face Adler, who uses the distraction to push the clothing on John. Which leaves John with an armful of clothing and no explanation.
Sherlock startles. He cannot fathom how she could have come by knowledge of that affair, and not knowing is never a feeling that sits easily within him. He vows to not allow it to become one to which he grows accustomed despite overexposure to this vexing woman.
John won’t give the man that satisfaction of asking just why a perfectly functioning watch is interesting. He just keeps his angry pace and tries to quell his rising panic as street after street passes and modern London—
“Because Irving Adler does not wear whatever nonsense you're currently wearing, and if you are to stay here and be my alibi, you must dress the part.” Adler pushes him towards her bedroom while explaining, “I have business out of the country that is preferably completed discreetly. At absolute best completed in complete secrecy. Though the why and how of your sudden appearance remains a mystery—one to which I believe not even you have an answer—I am not one to let a fortuitous advantage slip by. If you play the part of 'Irving Adler,' then no one need know or suspect me to have been out of the country. And even if you did not so clearly wish to stay, you even more clearly have no where else to go. Stay here until I return at the least, and more ideally, for as long as our arrangement remains advantageous to us both.”
“So people will talk,” she says. Sure enough, they get more than a few considering glances, particularly when they stop before the hansom and she leans forwards to kiss his cheek. Before pulling away, she hisses in his ear, “If you damage him in any way, I'll have you killed.” Then she pulls away with a wide smile plastered on her face and holds out her hand for him to help her into the hansom. He's too dazed by a sudden realisation to react to her threat (absurdly unnecessary threat that it was, he would
Sometimes Sherlock and John stand too close. Sometimes their eyes meet and lock for a moment too long and sometimes their touches linger. Sometimes John draws out his explanations when Sherlock's gaze seems fixed on his mouth, and sometimes John strongly suspects that Sherlock does the same when regaling John about one of his past cases—John himself is endlessly captivated by the cases only referenced in passing in Adler's books, or not mentioned at all. The only thing John truly hates about living in this time is that it is
“How long?” Sherlock asks, after they've followed Adler up the seventeen stairs. John hadn't counted them on his angry way out—and how can it only be hours ago that John was here for the first time when it feels like coming home?—and experiences a thrill at doing so now. Almost as large a thrill as he's getting from the very fact of Sherlock's very existence.
“Knock, knock!” Mrs Hudson calls cheerfully before coming into the room, a tray in her hands. “Oh, Mr Holmes! How good to see you are back with us. And Mr Adler, a good morning to you as well. Let me just set all this out.” As she busies herself setting out the tea and various assortment of breakfast foods—Holmes’ preferences but also some notable differences, likely the woman’s own requests—she chats away. “I really do think it is wonderful of you to have taken in a boarder. It will be good for you, having someone to talk to instead of that dreadful skull.”
been on his mind. And it really is quite a fascinating matter. And if she believes the way into Sherlock's good graces is through his work—well, she is not wrong. So Sherlock tells her, and she listens intently. She asks quite intelligent questions and makes insightful observations. Something inside him blossoms at her attention and sincere if grudging admiration. Something else inside him shrivels at the nature of her focus, of the feeling of being on the wrong side of a microscope, but he pushes that uncomfortable thought aside. Halfway through his account, she politely asks him to pause, briefly leaves, and returns with pen and paper with which to take notes.
Sherlocks stops his attempt to check the back of his head again with a hand around his wrist, his attention suddenly focused on a point somewhere past John.
John does his best to subtly glance over his shoulder, though, as has suddenly occurred to him, it’s difficult to see how John in his jeans and jumper and smartwatch in Victorian England wouldn't draw the eye. Not to mention Sherlock’s hand is still holding his wrist with his arm half-raised in the air. Though it could just be John who’s having difficulty dragging his attention away from that point of contact.
At his resentful silence, she continues, “The man following Sherlock Holmes is Irving Adler. No one need actually look at that man to know it is him. That is a simple fact. The only one who would notice is Sherlock Holmes himself, and he already knows. Trust me, Doctor, people see what they want to see.”
The man says, “You know the streets of London but you do not know what’s on them. You made deliberate decisions at each intersection, nodded to yourself at the street names, but grew unsure after turning on the street; you frowned, slowed, and your limp became more pronounced. You’re not seeing what you expect to see. Then your quick pace returned, only for this cycle to repeat at the next intersection. You could be familiar via a study of maps or a secondhand account, but if the former were true you would not have expectations of what’s on the street and if the latter surely the account would’ve better prepared you. Your street knowledge, coupled with your accent, mannerisms, appearance, and a few other key details, strongly suggest that you are either a native of London or have spent considerable time here. Your confusion, however, suggests that you have not been here recently. The next question would seem to be: When were you here last? Perhaps before your time overseas, perhaps not since childhood. You’re a man in his thirties, and it is not impossible that in thirty years London has changed enough to warrant your reaction. Not likely—a London in flux should be expected by a native, and advances in technology and changes in fashion are hardly isolated to one locale—but possible. There is other data to consider, however. Your curious comments about museums and antiques. Your strange clothing, while handsome, is not in fashion anywhere of which I am aware. Not to mention your clear familiarity with Adler and myself juxtaposed with your assertion I am a
, too real. John stumbles a bit on the uneven cobblestones and scrapes his palm steadying himself against the building. The pain is slight but unmistakable. Not a dream.
John isn’t in any capacity to entertain human interaction, had in fact only intended to run a few errands he could no longer put off before escaping back to the flat. But Mike is all inoffensive smiles and gentle but persistent nudges and before he can put a stop to it John finds himself sitting on a park bench beside the man, sipping an overpriced coffee he didn't want and can't really afford.
John should tell this man to go bugger himself, but reflex takes over again. “Half past nine,” he says.
From when he was a boy with skinned knees and a perpetually sunburned nose, forgetful drunkards for parents and an older sister already fast following their footsteps, to a harried student hurrying through the halls of St Bart’s under a pile of heavy, dense medical textbooks, to a weary captain barking orders under the Afghanistan sun right up until the pain hits and he’s spinning and can’t pinpoint when or how he went from standing to sprawled on the ground spitting sand and blood, or from there to the cold, sterile hospital room.
Mike snaps his fingers. “Sherlock Holmes. That was it, wasn’t it? 'The escapades of,' something like that?”
“Huh,” John says. Apparently losing patience with them, Adler shakes her head and pulls the curtain closed. Still looking at the window, John licks his lips again and says, “So. You and Adler, then. You really are...involved?”
Determined to escape this madness, John picks a direction and sets a fast, angry pace. He hasn’t even reached the end of the first street before the man has caught up with him and fallen into easy step besides him. John refuses to acknowledge him and feels his anger burn whiter with each step that passes during which the man apparently takes no issue with being ignored.
Following her conversation with Watson, she'd found Holmes, who took one look at her and must have seen a hundred pieces of data pointing towards the fact that she did not mean to return. Adler's throat had suddenly tightened, and she'd thought that if he said one word she would punch him in the jaw. But he had simply held out his hand for her to shake. Then she had gone to St Bart's, and next she knew...here she was.
and Sherlock Holmes was sitting across from him. But no one had been allowed to touch anything, let alone sit on the furniture, of course, and there were too many other visitors around to pretend it could've been just John and Sherlock. And the whole setup had just been an exhibit, really, since Sherlock Holmes had moved out well before his retirement and taken with him or else disposed of his personal affects, all of which were lost following his death. So it was all just guesses and replicas and framed passages of the books or newspaper clippings. This, though. This is what he'd imagined. No—
The first note he almost misses, the sound pure and striking and utterly incongruous. The second is louder and quickly followed by a rapid succession of notes.
Later, she'll present the published book to Harry, who cries but is smiling, too, and hugs Adler tight and says, “Thank you. He was just—gone. I was so scared he died alone,” and brushes her fingers across the title:
. If this is real, then—“That was brilliant,” he says, lightheaded for reasons nothing to do with his breathing. “Remarkable.”
Sherlock appears even more startled for a second, and then his face lights up in a smile. “Indeed,” he says, chuckling.
Adler can already tell she is going to adore the future. Thoroughly charmed, she nudges the bat away from her face, holds out her hand, and introduces herself, “Adler. And you, my dear?”
“I am loathe to disappoint you, my good, strange doctor, but the answer remains the same, I assure you.”
“Yeah, you can keep on waiting. I'll take an explanation, first, thanks,” John says. “Let's start with: Just how did I get here?”
Mrs Hudson finishes setting out their meal and with a fond sigh and a final fond look at the both of them, she bustles out. When Holmes has heard her reach the bottom of the stairs and close the door behind her to the downstairs hallways, Holmes turns on the woman and says, “Think very carefully about the game you are playing.”
“Oh, you've taken an interest, all right,” Adler says. “I somehow doubt it's in my comings and goings, however.”
and couldn’t mask her relief when lunch was over and they were both free to part ways. Not good old Mike Stamford, fat and happy and so good-natured and well-adjusted it set John’s teeth on edge. Most of his buddies from Afghanistan were still posted overseas or else didn’t make it home, and those that did were in no better shape than John. His parents have been dead since he was at university. He’d be hard pressed to even name a member of his extended family. The rugby lads, the girlfriends, the boyfriends, the fellow residents and doctors and nurses—they were from somebody else’s life.
Sherlock assures him again that there is no need for concern and brushes off Stamford's attempts to invite him for a meal. He continues on his way, but before he turns the corner Stamford calls, “You’re a good man, Holmes. I've always thought so.”
He hears the man’s sharp indrawn breath, but from a distance. John ignores him in favour of reassuring himself that all he feels is intact skin and hair—not...
Adler had long been ready to move on. Accompanying Holmes on cases had always just been a way to pass the time; to solidify her presence in his Baker Street, as Mycroft Holmes had asked of her, until she found a true purpose. She was not meant to be a stepping stone for someone else's. The arrangement suited them both, she believes, and the guilt of abandoning Holmes made the arrangement stretch for far longer than Adler had ever intended.
Even now, back home with nothing to show for it but a limp and an ache in his shoulder and a foul disposition, wallowing away his days and his money in his depressing little flat, there is a spark in John’s heart when he thinks of his lifelong companion.
Victorian London, and Christ almighty but John really really thinks it is,, then what John is pretty sure he’s about to do is incredibly—unbelievably—ill-advised. John is, however, absolutely sure it would be worth it. He leans closer, and Sherlock’s eyes widen—
The opera house manager swears it was Ms Adler’s brute of an ex-lover. Ms Adler's fellow contraltos blame one another. The conductor swears suicide. And to the man, every last opera staff member tells him, pale and breathless, that it was the opera house ghost, they swear it.
John fully faces Sherlock, who appears to be having difficult looking John in the eye—but once he does, they spend an absurdly long time staring at one another. John's heart rate picks up, and if this
“If I tell you, will you leave me be?” John asks. At her stiff nod, he quickly recounts everything he can recall from that last day. When he's finished, she smiles and says, completely sincere, “Thank you,” as if he's actually handed her an answer.
Sherlocks turns back towards him, surprised and unclear from where such a sentiment could’ve derived, but Stamford has himself already turned and begun walking away. The matter being ultimately inconsequential, Sherlock puts it from his mind and continues on his way.
She nibbles delicately at a biscuit and follows it with a calm sip of tea. She looks him in the eyes and says, simply, “I’ll tell.”
When Watson took over the role like he was born to it, it became only too clear how ill-suited to the role Adler had been.
Not Harry, who during their single awkward get together since his return gave him a stiff hug and pushed the smartwatch and her number on him with an order to
John still hesitates, standing firm despite her continued attempts to bodily pushes him towards the bedroom's dressing screen. She stops and sighs; leaning forward, she adds, soft and with clear reluctance, “I think Holmes would like it, very much, if you stayed awhile.”
They find Gerhard Stone’s younger brother, George Stone, who falls to his knees before Sherlock and the inspector and swears it was all just a bit of fun, no harm meant, and promises to disband the society if they will let them go without pressing any charges.
Sherlock joins John in studying Adler, who makes a face at them both. “Yes,” he says, his tone unreadable.
He shoves past the man, out of the bedroom and into a—drawing room, just as elaborately arranged as the other room. There are outdated scientific posters covering the walls and outdated reference books on the shelves. There’s a pipe rack, and an ivory box on the mantelpiece, and a bearskin hearthrug in front of the fireplace, and glass laboratory equipment holding liquids of various colour and consistency on every remaining available surface, and more candles and gas lighting. For Christ’s sake, he can see a
—and it's a helluva if—he has traveled back in time, is it permanent? How long will he be here? What is he going to
John says. “The amateur—it’s mentioned in Adler’s stories. The last one, in fact. But only in passing. No real details about the case. The amateur—”
“'Eventually' is not sufficient. Ms Adler counted some of the most powerful and influential individuals in the world among her most ardent admirers. I would consider it a personal favour if you popped over and wrapped this little matter up.”
“You know. The one you were always going on about. Reading at Bart’s whenever you had half a second to yourself. Some historical account, I think.”
John doesn’t remember when he started walking. He knows where to go even though he doesn’t know where he’s going. He barely notices when the sand under his heavy boots becomes pavement becomes cobblestone becomes hardwood flooring becomes soft rug under his suddenly bare feet. When the heavy heat becomes heavy fog becomes the warmth of a crackling fireplace. When the pain fades from his leg and his shoulder and his heart.
John turns from one to the other during their rapid back-and-forth, gaping. Then the man turns to him. “You’re not a client, are you?” he asks, before swiftly answering himself, “No, no. Of course you’re not. But you
Adler never outright details her motivations, and Sherlock speculates and deduces but never confirms. She starts with his case files, sifting through them and asking to hear the details, and Sherlock continues to regale her. To
John hasn’t half a clue what’s going on, so he holds tight to his anger because he’d rather that burn whiter and hotter than deal with the growing fear and humiliation creeping over him.
“Mendicant society,” Sherlock finishes, his gaze briefly flicking towards the man on the corner and then back. “
. But also: How magnificent. He keeps a newspaper clipping of Irene Adler's obituary among his case files, and he thinks: Well, that is that. He will not see her—or her like—again.
Some nights John can’t sleep and the old nightmares threaten to drag him back—and, like clockwork the violin serenade starts up, and John can take a deep breath and follow the music back home.
Seated in front of a prospective client or during a conversation with a Scotland Yard inspector or while questioning witnesses and suspects, John will unthinkingly mention an event that has yet to occur. When Sherlock brings John to someone in need to medical assistance—which happens with increasing frequency; in fact, John seems to acquire a roster of house patients before he's quite realised what is happening—John will reach for or yell for a medicine or piece of equipment yet to be invented. (He makes do—he didn't always have what he needed in Afghanistan, either, and if he damn well didn't let a man down then he damned well wouldn't do so now.) Sometimes they'll go for a walk or to the baths or to the opera and John will marvel at something amazing to him and clearly commonplace to Sherlock. Sometimes John struggles with having Mrs Hudson wait on him, or coming across servants and antiquated, backwards attitudes and mores. John has a mild heart attack when he realises that there are no James Bond movies—or any movies—or trash TV or mobile phones or cars or
“...You,” John blinks rapidly. He actually takes a step back. “You actually believe that I traveled here from the future?”
Eyes closed, in his mind’s eye he reads over her first story of him, the words as clear as if he were reading them on paper. His first true glance of himself through someone else's eyes. He finds himself returning to it, again and again.
John would be irritated or embarrassed, sure that Sherlock is mocking him, but the other man approaches him with nothing but honest curiosity and is always so genuinely delighted when John not only has an answer, but sometimes what amounts to an entire dissertation, that John is almost eager for the questions to begin.
But John doesn’t really register the question, too busy finally taking stock of the bizarre bedroom he’s found himself in. There are thick, heavy drapes around the windows and tied to the wooden bedposts, racks of old-fashioned wigs and dresses and suits taking up every spare inch of the room, and the walls are lined with pictures in elaborate frames that look like they belong in his grandparents’ photo albums. There’s a
“I don’t know how I got here,” John says quietly and then admits, like the cowardly thief he is, “But I don't want to go back.”
, though he perhaps attempted to tone down his obvious affection when his parents started demanding to know when he meant to grow out of his childish obsession. Lots of people admire historical figures, even relatively obscure ones, and know every little detail of their lives. It is and was a perfectly fine pastime. Except right at this moment it doesn't feel like a harmless pastime. It feels like the only thing John has
“I don’t want you to,” Sherlock answers, and then it's Sherlock's turn to crumble, his hands now shaking against John's face. “Please—John, I beg of you. Don't return. Stay here. You are the bravest and best man I know. I don't care where you're from. I don't care when. We'll continue as we are and when you're tired of this life we'll retire to this lovely little cottage I have in Sussex. I'll raise bees and you'll write books and we'll be quite content, I swear it. Please, John.”
, you enjoy the cases as much as Sherlock. And your titles are shite, try to have some creativity, huh? Oh! Here’s a good one: historians have written
That’s a violin, isn’t it? John isn’t a classical music type of guy, so he can’t place the song. “You’re so unsophisticated, Johnny,” Harry would laugh when John was ignorant about whatever high-brow topic he knew for a fact she’d only read up on the night before to impress Claire. Back when Harry was still trying to make it work. Back when she cared. It feels like a lifetime ago. The thought of Harry deep in the bottle stings less than usual, cushioned as he is by the steady rise and fall of the music.
Correctly interpreting his silence, she says, “You’ve been regaling the ceiling about it the past few days. But you never reached the end.”
“Since following you from Baker Street, he’s the third man I've seen with such a ribbon. Each man wore it in a different place, but the exact same ribbon. Same exact colour. In fact,” Sherlock’s eyes go distant in thought. “I’ve seen eleven such ribbons this month. Different men. Different streets. All beggars. All wearing a turquoise ribbon.”
John knows the man's official history, of course, or what little is known of it for such a notable man (John may be slightly biased as regards to the extent of Holmes' notoriety). Holmes was by all accounts a private man who kept few if any confidants outside of his biographer Adler, about whom even less is known. Holmes famously solved the murder of the man's sister, but anything more of the circumstances of their acquaintance is unclear. Contemporary accounts even disagree on whether Holmes and Adler were the closest of companions or the greatest of enemies (though do seem to agree that it was definitely one or the other, with nothing in between). His clients praised him and cursed him in equal measure but were almost universally reticent about disclosing the details of the affairs with which Holmes had assisted them, which made sense to John; no one had called upon Holmes because they were having a good day. Historians who specialise in the life of Holmes think it was by the influence of his brother Mycroft, himself a reclusive figure, that Holmes' personal life was kept out of the public eye and history, both. All of which meant that if Adler had not come along and written his stories, Sherlock Holmes may have not even been a footnote in history. Especially as, once Alder abruptly stopped writing in eighteen-ninety-seven, the only further account is that Holmes retired 10 years later to a little cottage in Sussex, where he lived in reclusion until his death in the late nineteen-twenties. No one knows what became of Adler.
“You continue to ask questions that I believe would make infinitely more sense coming from myself or Holmes,” the woman says.
When John was at his best, the world was always brighter for that extra presence in his life. And when John was at his lowest, lonely and contemplating the bottle and hating himself for it, well, he never felt truly alone.
The next several hours are a mad, adrenaline-filled blur up and down London. They trail after a man with a turquoise ribbon, end up
Thankfully, not longer after that John is finally able to extricate himself from this excruciatingly awkward conversation (though only John seems to have noticed that it was). As he's walking away, Mike calls after him, “Take care of yourself, John, eh?” Forcing a grimace from his face, John nods at Mike, stiff but as neutral as he can manage before continuing on, leaning heavily on his cane. Christ, but he thinks the leg is getting worse. Just what he needs.
He may worry, during the sleepless nights, when he’s staring at the ceiling and everything aches, that it’s not always going to be enough to fill the hollowness inside him.
“John? John Watson?” a vaguely familiar voice calls out one day, perhaps six months after John’s return; the days all blur together and it's not like he's got a schedule to mind. “It’s me. Stamford! Mike Stamford. From Bart's?”
“It matters to me,” she insists. “You must know something. What is the last thing you recall before coming here?”
“You know why he’s here? He’s not paid or anything. He likes it. He gets off on it. Weirder the crime, the more he gets off. And you know what? One day just showing up won’t be enough. One day we’ll be standing round a body and Sherlock Holmes will be the one who put it there.”
Martin was so worked up he didn’t hear the phone ring the first time around, or the second. By the time the third one started ringing, he paused outside the phone booth, then glanced up at the nearby security camera.
During his side quest to retrieve the gun from his former apartment, Martin’s phone rung from an unknown number several times before lighting up with texts from Sherlock. Martin knew eventually Mycroft would get to him, but figured he could maybe put off the conversation one more day. It was only written in the script this early on to introduce Mark’s character and build the tension anyway.
However, before Martin could even address those thoughts, the two were off to continue their investigation—the game was afoot.
“I’ve been thinking about your case lately, and I’ve come to some… unexpected leads,” said Sherlock. Sherlock’s deep baritone sent a wave of feelings through the side of him that was John, but Martin also felt a growing cold spot in his stomach. He didn’t know if the detective could really figure this out—after all, Sherlock was only human, and this was clearly some kind of supernatural experience—but any evidence proving that Martin was crazy, and not actually experiencing something otherworldly, was both welcome and terrifying.
“221B, Baker street,” Martin told the cabbie. Something inside him warmed at the address, something that felt right.
Without knocking on the door, Martin breezed in to find—just as in the show—Ben slapping a corpse with a belt. Only it wasn’t Ben, but rather the character he played on the show. Ben and Sherlock held themselves differently. Martin was sure he did the same to an extent, but really he wasn’t as physical an actor as Ben. It was something he greatly admired about his friend’s skills. As soon as he stopped to look at him Ben—er, Sherlock’s—face scrunched up as his eyes scanned Martin’s body.
The doctor whispered something to the nurse, who hastily exited the room looking frightened. The doctor cleared his throat awkwardly and sat on the end of Martin’s bed. He’s got a look on his face, one that is infuriatingly placating and worrisome at the same time. He also appeared a touch afraid.
As he walked toward the main road, Martin was fuming over the conversation with Sally. It all felt a bit ridiculous. From John’s point of view, she was right—they barely knew Sherlock. And from Martin’s point of view his anger was pointless because they’d rehearsed these scenes loads of times and he knew how everyone felt about Sherlock at this point. Furthermore, Ben and Sherlock were different people, even if they had the same face, and Martin’s affection for the other man seemed pretty unwarranted. For all Martin knew, in this alternate universe, Sherlock truly was a sociopath and didn’t care at all about anyone. Still, it all seemed so wrong that Donovan would say such things about Sherlock, his new friend.
“Um, asphyxiation, I think. From—no, that’s not it. Um, she didn’t have any drugs or alcohol. Oh wait! No, maybe drugs, yeah that’s it.”
“Hello,” replied Sherlock, non-plussed. Without Stamford to introduce him, Martin felt a little silly barging in like this. Furthermore, Sherlock wasn’t delivering the usual lines, the ones where he assumed John’s military service, and whatnot. Instead he was watching Martin with a puzzled look on his face. Martin cleared his throat.
When John didn’t respond, Martin let out a long sigh, only to realize, blinking, that Sherlock disappeared down the stairs. Just as in the first episode, when he finally made his way to the street, Martin was accosted by Donovan and Sherlock was gone.
He and Ben talked about this in length. Both agreed, particularly during season 1, that what happened between John and Sherlock truly was a love story. Maybe it wasn’t a sexual love story, but there was a coming together of two inevitable forces nonetheless, and they brought out the best in each other. Martin remembered this moment, in filming, and Ben said something along the lines of “This when he gets the first inkling that he’s into you. Everything before this moment John was a regular person, but now he’s something special because he’s the first one to see Sherlock the way he wants to be seen.”
“What do they usually say?” he asked. Sherlock finally looked up, a cocky little grin painting the side of his lips, very much Sherlock and not at all like Ben.
Martin could feel a headache coming on, but instead of rubbing his eyes or temples, he pinched the bridge of his nose, just like John would.
“I’ll explain everything in a moment, but let’s start with some questions. First of all, what is your legal name?”
John Watson,” said Martin. Ella wrote a note on her clipboard and in a way that was very unpolite, very Martin, not Watson, he rolled his eyes and scoffed “And don’t you bloody write ‘multiple personalities disorder’ or I will scream.”
“Piss off, you sound like my bloody therapist,” sniped Martin. He immediately softened, sagging down in defeat. “I’m sorry. It’s just… The gist of it is that we were. Coworkers. On a… film set. In a popular show called—bare with me—Sherlock. This was all before I met you that I thought this, I swear.” Martin dared to glance at Sherlock’s face, only to find the consulting detective somehow more intense, his pupils dilating just a smidge like they did in the show. How had Martin seen that? Were they that close together? With a blush, he scooted back, mentally chiding John for unintentionally moving them closer together.
Martin bit his lip. He’d sort of shot off the text without thinking. It seemed that Martin’s lack of filter mixed with John’s adrenaline-junkie habits made a bad combination when it came to tact. Plus, admittedly, both aspects of himself were flirts, whether they wanted to admit it or not.
“You know what it was, you’ve read the papers,” said Sherlock. Martin stood up, dusting his hands off in a way that was too posh for John Watson.
“That’s not what people usually say,” replied Sherlock. Martin knew the next two lines, but said it anyway.
John. It was sort of like those moments he and Ben got really into a scene, the kind the Martin lived for where he just got lost in the character, lost in that other world, when everything flowed and jived so well the cameras all but melted away and he
“Are all your theories about your rivals at work this ridiculous?” Martin’s tone was light, but he watched Donovan with outer contempt and impatience “Oh, and let me guess— Lestrade is a BDSM swinger in a polyamorous relationship with the prime minister and Anderson. Sherlock’s been in on the whole thing for years, but it’s all a conspiracy. Is that right?”
A pause that lasts too long. He’s got his eyes open finally and standing before him in an overweight doctor and a nurse with too much make up on. The hospital room was dingy, not what he expected of the hospitals near set.
“However, I currently have a string of suicides begging for my attention, so it seems you will have to wait, my dear Watson,” said Sherlock briskly as he stood. Before Martin could collect his whit’s, the taller man winked, sending Martin’s heart slamming in his chest.
“But doesn’t this world have just as much detail? Come on, John, you’ve told me so much about your military experience. Your family. Your life growing up.”
It was odd, but if Martin walked with enough sense of security, people didn’t seem to stop him. Sure, if someone asked him what he was doing, he could inform him of John Watson’s doctor position, but really Martin just needed to appeared assured as he headed down the hallways to his destination. This wasn’t hard—he was an actor after all. It took a while but eventually he hunted down the room he was looking for.
“Good”, his master purred. “You are so good. Now, let go of all control.” The mouth closed over his as if in a kiss, and then he felt his master's breath blown into him, as gentle and relentless as he had earlier pushed the plug inside him. He tried very hard not to struggle, to let himself be taken over, and was rewarded with an appreciative hum, and another breath from his master, and another, until it seemed that he was not breathing on his own, that there was nothing else but this, this rapture, this euphoria of losing himself completely.
Soothing touches brought him back to himself. The ropes, plug, chain and blindfold were gone, and he was lying on their bed, feeling clean, warm, and comfortably tired. Strong, capable hands were rubbing his back with lotion while the man above him murmured gently. He breathed in deeply and sighed in contentment.
“One more thing, pet”, he heard/felt his master murmur into his mouth. “Will you give me one more thing”, and a hand was laid into his bound hands. He squeezed it, yes, yes, anything his master was asking of him, he was willing, he wanted like he never wanted anything in his life before, yes.
Unseen hands were at his nipples now, slowly tweaking and rubbing and rolling them between two fingers, every sensation running through him like little sparks of electricity, pooling in his groin and making his cock grow and twitch in its cage. Suddenly, the nipples were pinched hard, and something clamped down on them, taking the sensation from pleasure to pain and back into a different kind of pleasure. He heard the jingling of a chain, and felt a heaviness that intensified the pleasure/pain.
He was blindfolded, arms tied securely behind his back, soft but strong ropes criss-crossing his body from his neck down to his legs, tied in loops and knots tight enough to press into his naked skin. He was kneeling on the floor, his legs spread open, his feet as securely fastened as his hands, a position just this side of uncomfortable. Reflexively he tried to move, but there was no give in the ropes, no loose knot. He was immobilised.
“... ah, yes, I thought so”, his master continued. “But I don't want you to come yet, pet, you're not going to come until I tell you to. Let me hear you, pet, tell me you understand me.”
He was so far gone that he almost did not feel his master's hand move away from the chain, caressing down over the ropes on his belly, coming to rest on his cock, wrapping around it and stroking it with a slow rhythm.
“If you could only see yourself, pet. Oh you are marvellous like this. You're almost there, aren't you, pet. Almost ready to come. I'm sure if I were to touch you here...” A warm hand wrapped itself loosely around his cock, without pressure or movement, just holding it dispassionately, and he sobbed once.
"Now", his master said as he bowed him forward again, the chain tugging his nipples down heavily, "let's start with the riding crop."
He groaned, he whimpered, he strained against his bonds and shouted wordlessly as the rhythm picked up and the heavy fullness in his cock and balls became almost unbearable. Everything he was feeling, the push and pull of the ropes, the pain on his back and chest, the delicious fullness of the plug in his arse, all of it was channelled into this rhythm, concentrated to that focus there, just there, just a little more, please, please, oh god please...
He was about to move, to make some sort of plea, when the riding crop again landed on his back, surprising him into stillness. "Patience, pet", he heard his master say with a slight hint of amusement. "You are not the one in control."
He felt something slip over his penis, the press of leather straps above, between and behind his balls, heard the soft click of the fastenings, and he shivered. He had never in his life felt so exposed before, and he surprised himself by loving it. He groaned softly.
"Shh, shh, you're doing so well. Look at you, so beautiful, pet. Mine to do with as I wish. Say it. Say you are mine."
“I'm waiting”, his master said, giving his cock a stroke and a quick squeeze, and he started babbling. “Haaaahyes, oh god, yes, please, please yes, please, please....” The hand released his cock and was laid over his mouth, silencing him.
But where was the crop? After the first stroke, nothing else had happened, and he was quivering with expectation. More. He wanted more.
“Yes”, he answered without hesitation, safe in the knowledge that this would end when he wanted it to. He was kissed again, and it felt like a reward.
His master was right, of course. There was absolutely nothing he could do - and suddenly, that felt right, it felt wonderful. He almost giggled as the riding crop painted another red line on his back, then another, and another, until the skin on his back was hot and raised in welts across the ropes that bound him and held him together, the weight hanging from his chest swaying in a constant rhythm, his lips swollen from where he had caught them between his teeth to keep from shouting. He had experienced worse pain before, but this was an intimate, personal pain, transformed by pleasure into something as yet unknown to him.
He didn't know what would happen to him or where this would take him, but he knew that he wanted this, needed this, more than he could say. There had been sleepless nights interrupted by nightmares, days of tension and helplessness, events sliding beyond his control. But here he was voluntarily giving control to someone else, someone he trusted with his life. He made himself relax and surrender to the other. His master. He nodded.
“Come for me, pet, come for me now”, his master commanded as he heard the fastenings snap open, releasing the pressure, and for an eternal moment he felt weightless, in free fall over an abyss, his whole being contracting to a pinpoint and then exploding outward, waves of ecstasy gripping him and throwing him into blinding darkness as he came and came with a silent shout.
"Yes", the other breathed out, and a velvet hand caressed his face, tipping it up. A soft, almost reverent kiss was placed on his lips. “You only have to say the word, pet, and this will stop. You know that, don't you?”
The touch of bare hands on the feverish skin of his back felt like ice. "You are doing very well, pet", his master murmured, and he was pleased. "I shall give you a reward for being so good. Bend forward a little more, please, pet", his master ordered, guiding his bound body down until his forehead rested on the floor. The hands were pinching and stroking his buttocks now, spreading them apart and running feather-light touches down over his anus and perineum. The slow caresses were an immense contrast to the whipping, making them almost torturous. Something soft and warm and slippery was pressed against his hole, pushing in with a gentle but relentless pressure. He gasped as the small butt plug was moved slowly in and out by excruciatingly tiny increments until his muscles were relaxed and the plug slid in. He shivered uncontrollably at the feeling, his cock thick and straining at its bonds, his whole body wanting to move but unable to, his mind awash with desire to shout, to run away, to demand more of this, all his impulses short-circuiting and drowning in the mix of pleasure and pain as the chain attached to his nipples swung again in time with the movements of the plug in and out of his arse. He could feel the sweat pool on his face and on the small of his back, and he was panting shallowly.
