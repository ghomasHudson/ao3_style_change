And he does. But Steve's not worried. In fact, considering how long Tony's been alone, it's comforting to know someone outside of the pack is as protective and loving towards the brunet as he himself is.
did all of that mean?
"What do you mean you're not going?" Steve's voice asks from behind him; and he's calm and collected buyt there's that lilt of frustration in his tone that's so undeniably Steve.
Tony pushes at his chest, eyebrows furrowed in frustration. What does that mean? Why would Steve wait for someone damaged like Tony, when he's gorgeous, young, and can kiss like
"Dammit, Tony." Steve says between clenched teeth, and he takes a deep breath to pull himself together, "You can't keep going out there without telling me anything. What if you get hurt out there? If I don't know where you are I can't get to you if something happens."
Clint just stares at him, calm and maybe a little bemused, "You're my family too, Stark."
What? After all that she said about Tony and damning him, she was just going to help Thanos get that much closer to taking over their universe?
But, back to this:
"You went out in that?" Steve demands, wrapping his hand loosely around Tony's forearm and tugging him in.
The blond's voice cracks as he asks the last question, and Tony is horrified as he takes in Steve's expression. Of course that's what Steve thinks. That as soon as Tony gets spooked out over something they don't have control over, that he'd equate Steve to the things he was running from. Tony didn't know better back then; but after everything they'd gone through
need you."
Steve releases a growl of approval as he cups the back of Tony's head and pulls him closer, and while he's sure that it's going to be rough, Steve is as gentle with him now as he had been while they were crying together.
"Angry blond on the loose!" Tony warns, and he just watches Clint's face contort into confusion.
He can’t help but imagine Tony’s voice in his head, full of disdain, muttering, “
"You can leave miss Maximoff to me," a voice quips from behind them, and they all turn to see Vision floating towards them. His android body isn't in good shape, Steve notes; and he wonders in horror what Wanda had done to him. The mind stone that was once attached to his head is missing, on top of the physical damage
"Why'd you leave all of that behind for me?" Tony asks, then, and Sam sobers up immediately.
Everyone knew it was too good to be true. With everything that happened, the idea of the Rogues (including Bucky) being welcomed into their old team compound was surreal at best. They were just waiting for the shoe to drop.
Abruptly, Tony decides he hasn't had nearly enough caffeine to even think about this conversation. He downs the contents of the mug, then reaches for the carafe for another mug. Oh god, Pepper was going to kill him. How was he supposed to explain all of this?
The Accords were nothing but a flickering memory drawn out by harsh rivalries, and had seemed to magically disappear one morning when Steve had been on his morning run. T'Challa had been quick and joyful as he told the former Avenger that they were all allowed to go home.
"You're a civilian and you painted a target on your back." Steve, no, Captain America tells him. His tone is short, clipped, and Tony hates that now that he knows who Steve is, he can't see anyone but Captain America.
And to everyone there, the idea
"Aren't you here because Obadiah called to threaten him?" Natasha asks now, and she has a hand on James's shoulder, her long fingernails curled into his shirt.
"So you'll just keep following me around until one of us dies?" Tony asks, scoffing as he turns his head away. Steve pulls his hand away like it's been burned.
"Can I help you?" Bucky asks, his eyebrows furrowed and his left arm twitching in a subconscious manner. After all, Tony did blast his arm off once.
It doesn't even take a second for the room to react. Tony is on his feet, the suit wrapping around him again as he lunges forward. Before he can get to her, though, Bucky has leapt across the table and wrapped his metal hand around her neck. He's not pressing hard enough to choke her, but his expression is angered beyond what they've seen from him since he'd been deprogrammed.
Tony's thankful to him for suggesting that; but his heart constricts with guilt as he shakes his head, "You were his friend and you're my mate. You're the one who can't be excused for attendance."
Steve exchanges a glance with Natasha, who only raises an eyebrow as if to ask if she should perceive the newcomer as a threat or not. Steve shakes his head just slightly and does as requested. James is the first of Tony's life that he's been given the honor of meeting -excluding Howard, since Tony's made his feelings of his father obvious-, and he wants them to be on at least civil terms. When he sits, James strolls over and pulls out the chair from the opposite end of the table; and while the table is too small for the entire group to sit down, they gather around anyway.
Just before he can step outside, Steve reaches out and grabs the sleeve of his shirt. A flicker of hope fills his chest; because if Steve stops him at least that means they can talk it out, right?
He finds himself grateful that no one else seems to be up; and after having a quick shower and tugging on a pair of clothes he had Pepper send over to the house for him when he originally made the plan to stop at the Virginia house, he makes his way to the kitchen and turns his coffee maker on.
While he's distracted by his surroundings, and the reminder of an old conversation he'd shared with Tony regarding retiring and settling down, his eyes fall upon the front of the log cabin, where the Iron Patriot armor sits like a lawn ornament. It's painted with the Red, White, and Blue that reminds him of his own colors; and in front of it sits his shield, planted firmly in the ground like a daunting reminder of what he lost.
An hour later, he is drunk and laying back on his couch, with sad memories of Christmases and Birthdays celebrated alone because his mom was unwell and his father just didn't want him around. The lights are off, aside from the twinkle of the lights coming from outside his window; and he feels alone in this big ol' tower remembering why he had left in the first place.
While he's expecting for Steve to stroll into the garage looking for him, it's actually Sam who ducks under the door into his workspace. He's lost track of time, much like he always does when his hands are moving, and Sam seems baffled and horrified. It's a given, considering Tony's managed to pry sheets of metal off of the walls; he works better by moving, and this house isn't equipped with his usual holographic workstations. The sun isn't up yet, so it can't be too late; and yet, Tony feels like a kid getting caught by their parents for staying up past curfew.
Tony throws his hands up in the air, "And we were supposed to work together to make contingencies, Steve. It would have required lawyers and time, but if you'd just listened to me back then, we could've made the Accords work for us, not the other way around."
"I was there for that." Sam says, and his voice is quiet but rushed. Tony turns to him in surprise, but the former army's head is bowed forward with his hands gripping firmly on his knees, "I was in the Pararescue team. I didn't know it was you until now, but we got the intel that a convoy was attacked and the only bodies there weren't moving. I've seen what those missles do, I know how dangerous they are."
about her?" Clint asks, groaning again as he fiddles absentmindedly with his quiver, "We could barely take her on as a group."
"You turned me into the villain here,
to live together, per se, but they're a newly wedded couple and that makes sense. They haven't had sex yet, and even from what Tony remembers, they haven't even had a kiss; but maybe that could change in time.
"Then at least I'll get to be near you. At least some of the hollowness in my heart will be filled." He doesn't mean for it to sound biting, but it does.
It's weird to think that he now knows home as a shabby little apartment in Brooklyn rather than his tower or the mansion he'd lost in Malibu, but to him, home is anywhere Steve is.
"Patch me in, J." He tells his AI, and JARVIS dutifully hacks into the Avengers' communication channel to speak to them directly, "Where am I dropping you, birdbrain?"
The music cuts off suddenly, and Tony's so surprised by it that he lifts his head and bumps his skull against the car's frame. Hissing, he pulls himself out from under the car to glare at his unwelcomed guest. It doesn't hurt enough to tell him he's got a cut, but it sure as hell does sting. When he sees Steve there, holding his food and smiling ever so gently, his anger fizzles out. How he'd forgotten the type of man Steve is is beyond him.
hi so it’s come to my attention that the story is heavily not cap-team friendly, and I just wanted to apologize about that. I’m not intentionally making it as such because I will always love the original MCU-verse Avengers team. they’re all dumb fucks but we love them despite it.
Except, it's not necessary, because when the helicopter gets close enough for whoever's in it to drop down, Tony breaks out into a wide grin at who sees through the window. A man as flambouyant as Tony Stark would only ever have friends as equally flamboyant -- and that's a fact.
Tony chuckles, but it's a labored one as he leans closer into Steve's touch, "When my chest was reconstructed, they put a metal plate in to keep my lungs from collapsing. Thor jostled it a little. I'll be alright; I just need a few minutes."
"I fucked up, Tony. After Ultron, I stopped trusting you. You were always a loose canon and it felt like even on the best days, I couldn't get a read on you. So I didn't tell you about your parents, and that's on me. I got us involved in a fight when we couldn't compromise. I'm the reason Rho-"
"I destroyed these." Tony mutters, and his heart thuds violently like something sharped is being jammed into it. His hands are shaking, and Tony hates how just a few minutes were able to take away from the good night/morning he was having. He looks back at Rhodey, and notes that while his best friend isn't shaking like he is, that the discomfort is still clear on his face, "How did you get these?"
"Excuse me. No." Sam continues, raising a finger and wagging it in Steve's direction and then Tony's, "I'm taking charge of this discussion. You two sit back and speak when it's your turn to do so."
Oh, god.
"I've noticed," Sam quips, and he leans back on the stool, his body finally seeming to relax, "but Steve's going to push. He needs that vulnerability. Your relationship isn't going to be easy."
"You don't know who I am?" Tony asks, incredulous.
Smirking, Tony dips back down and takes the tip of Steve's dick into his mouth. He works slowly, teasingly, savoring the taste of Steve in his mouth. He's not too fond of oral, usually; but Steve isn't overly salty and his musky scent is driving Tony wild.
Steve takes a second to think about it. It's a bad idea, of course it is. They've got a bad history, after all; but maybe Sam's got a point. Maybe they do need to talk things through before they can move forward. Everyone turns in Tony's direction to see what he thinks of the suggestion.
. He shifts again, carefully lifting Steve's arm and getting himself to his feet. As much as he'd like to snuggle with the alpha, it's the morning time and that means it's coffee time.
Coffee momentarily forgotten, Tony turns around and is met with a broad chest, covered in a thin grey tee-shirt that is nearly soaked through from sweat. He swallows hard, forcing his eyes all the way up to where he meets Steve's gaze.
"Don't think that's a good idea." He gets out, and he sees the blatant amusement on Steve's face. How in the world is any of this amusing?
And before he can register what he's doing, Tony spews out with, "We don't spend any time together. I know we're new to the marriage thing but I barely know you and you spend all your time with someone else. Steve if you don't want to be married to me just say so."
"In two days from now, Tony Stark will commit the first murder that will remove any remnance of the humanity left in him." Stephen tells him in response, his eyes flickering and his hands twitching.
"Dude just can't catch a break," Clint groans out, and considering his initial reluctance in having Tony join them, his reaction is unexpected.
He cuts himself off, lifting the shirt he's wearing enough for the jagged lines and circled scar on his chest to be shown. Steve's seen it once, of course, but the horror on his face as he hears the story is genuine. He's not the only one horrified, but for some reason, it's hard to look away when Steve's beautiful eyes look at him like that.
Tony pours himself another mug of coffee and downs that, too, before he raises his eyes to meet Bruce's. They're both scientists, so at least they can appreciate long hours working in a lab. As annoyed as he is, Steve watches on fondly. At least Tony isn't shutting everyone out, still.
Despite the growing need between them, Steve starts out slow and gentle. It takes Tony some time to adjust to his length inside of him, but when the hisses run out and are replaced by appreciative moans, Steve begins to move again. He's really just rocking into Tony, taking his time and making sure he's not too fast or too rough when Tony's still adjusting to the feeling of it. In retaliation, Tony rolls his hips forward, and it catches Steve by surprise. He moans, a low, primal type of moan, as he pulls himself back so that just his tip is inside Tony. Tony whines, like he doesn't want it to be over so soon, but then Steve slams into him, and Tony feels his vision going in and out. His jaw going slack and his head thrown back, Tony just focuses on the way Steve feels inside of him.
Tony moans without really wanting to, and he knows this is going against everything he's worked for. He can't submit, not to Steve, not
"You're allowing me to be close for the first time since you heard we were mates." Steve replies, sure and confident, and with so much adoration in his tone, "I wanted to be selfish and spend as much time as I could with you."
that Tony can't even hear his own thoughts. He forces his eyes shut, using his thumb and pointer finger to try and ease some of the tension out of them, and when his eyes open again, they find Steve's unwavering gaze. Those blue eyes are filled with what seems to be sorrow; whether the sorrow is for Tony or for the people that fell victim to the weapons he'd created, is another thing all together.
Tony shrugs in a half hearted manner, turning his head to glance at the house. It certainly seems a lot less daunting now that he's not staring at it alone, that's for sure. His gaze flickers over to Steve for the shortest moment, trying to remain composed although he knows how badly his body is craving the man.
"Tony?" Steve's voice calls out, and Tony turns his head to see Steve's head peeking out from beneath the garage door. He doesn't come in, but there's an expectancy in his gaze as he holds a hand out, "Come on, you need to get some sleep."
It's breakfast time. Clint is humming as he flips another pancake onto an awaiting tray. Sam is hovering nearby and staring rather intently at the pancakes like he's just waiting to devour an entire stack. Steve has just come in from his morning run, because he lived for schedules. Wanda was nursing a cup of tea and preparing another for Natasha, who had just walked in. Vision is sitting next to her, pretending to have some interest in the way of humans. Scott was on his phone, excitedly telling Cassie that he'd be able to see her in a few days. Bucky was sitting at the kitchen island, metal hand curled around a coffee mug that they all knew had once been Tony's.
"You two know each other?" Natasha asks, and her eyes lock onto Steve like she's asking if he understands what's going on better than she does.
finds the pack in the kitchen, with Bruce cooking up waffles and bacon with eggs and Tony sitting at the counter with nothing but a mug of coffee in his hands. Steve had already tried to encourage (force) him to eat, but Tony just angled his body so he wouldn't have to see the disappointed look Steve's wearing. As exaspertated as Steve is by his lack of self-care, the blond still manages a light guffaw. He doesn't push it much further for the moment, but Tony can tell he's not getting up from his seat until he's at least had
Steve doesn't bother to hide his amusement, not that Tony can see it. Despite his bravado and his mere stubbornness to admit that he's tired, Tony manages to fall asleep
Okay, that's probably a good point. At this rate, they really might have no other choice aside from choosing between Tony and Wanda. They all love Wanda, who they felt protective of because her life and family was stripped away like theirs were. But Tony? While they have mixed feelings about him, he
"I know that look. No, I'm not interested in taking him from you." Bucky says with the slightest shake of his head, reaching over and patting Tony on the shoulder with his metal arm, "When I saw how torn up he was about you and Malibu -- I knew. Even if soulmates are a work of fiction, you're the best man for him. You make him happier than anything in this decade."
Everyone seems to give up on breakfast and strolls into the next room where the television lay. A few of them have their plates in their hand, though; and Tony doesn't even seem to realize he's still clutching onto his empty mug. Clint is the one who picks up the remote and turns the television on. Everyone else is holding onto bated breaths much like Tony is. As soon as the news turns on, Tony feels his world turn upside down.
wow. we're at the ten chapter mark. i don't think i've had this much muse to get a story done in years. i've got a lot more ideas i'm working on; including a stripper au, mafia au and a robbers-vs-robbers au. unfortunately, i have no idea how long this story is going to be, so those will have to wait. anyway. i rectified the lack of rhodey. sometimes we just need a little bit of iron patriot to get through the day.
"You should eat first." Steve manages to grit out, but Tony doesn't look his way even once. He tries not to be hurt by it and wonders instead what thoughts could be running in the brunet's head.
Staring back into those blue orbs, Tony feels the rest of his will crumble. He's crying, too, not that he's aware of it himself. Steve is, however, and reaches up to thumb the stray tears away. Steve still treats him like he's the most precious thing in the world, and Tony hates that he's dragged the alpha into his pathetic life.
die, Tony."
"Fuck, Tony." Steve cries, and Tony makes a mental note to chide him about his language much like Captain America does when they're on the field.
"This seems as a cause for celebration!" Thor calls out, triumphantly, as he walks over and claps a hand against Tony's shoulder. Thor, who can never seem to tell how strong he is,  manages to knock Tony forward; and Tony falls forward onto the counter, knocking his chest into it.
Steve is quiet for a long beat as he regains his footing, then releases Tony so suddenly that the brunet stumbles on his feet.
(See the end of the chapter for
The team spaces itself out, everyone grabbing for whatever weapon they had on hand. Steve doesn't have any weapons; and while normally he didn't need his shield to fight a foe, Tony Stark had always been a cunning rival.
"You don't mean that, Tony." Sam tells him, shaking his head like he's in the midst of a bad dream. If he is, he's sharing it with Steve.
He manages to get high up enough that the blast radius would be contained; but he's still caught up in it, his body rattling around in the suit as he falls back down to the street.
"And now all of you defend him!" Wanda continues, horrified like they should've never even considered the idea of being on the same side as Tony Stark.
"There's breakfast, too." A voice calls out all of a sudden, and Tony's so startled by it that he lets go of his mug all together. A hand shoots out from behind him, catching the cup with such great reflexes that he's caught off guard.
"It's cold and you're a personal space heater." Tony quips back easily, and he holds his hand out as an invitation. He won't force the idea of it, but wants Steve to know it's okay to lean on him when he can't be on his own, "Come and keep me warm."
“And if I refuse to help that monster?” Wanda asks now, her eyes narrowed and her lips curled back into a snarl.
Tony waits for his reaction, heart thrumming violently in his chest.
The rest of the team had turned off comms after ten straight minutes of Iron Man and Captain America arguing about the best way to take care of the bots. Which, really, shouldn't be an issue because Iron Man is the most technologically savvy person on the team. Unfortunately, Captain America has control issues and Iron Man isn't much of a follower.
Steve seems to catch onto it just as quickly, and there's a spark of surprise that flickers in his gaze. He continues his soft praises as Tony blows him, and while Tony's jaw is getting sore from the positioning, he's proud of the way he's able to pleasure the blond. Just a few more strokes and-
Bruce's lips twitch ever so slightly, though Tony can't entirely tell if it's out of amusement or frustration. Bruce is a scientist, much like Tony, but his expertise lies in biological sciences and the study of gamma rays.
"That's illegal, Clint." Natasha responds over the rim of a mug of tea, but her gaze says she's strongly considering it as her eyes turn back to Tony.
"Are you going out there?" Tony asks, and Bucky shoots him a look as he passes Steve to the door.
"What is there to talk about?" Tony drawls on, and he has no interest in sitting back and letting anyone else tell him when to talk or why.
"When I woke up and you weren't there, I thought you were gone," Steve says, and his voice is so quiet and
from this guy, how the hell did he manage to meet him face to face at a diner of all places?
Which, thinking back, was probably the truth. The raft was waiting for anyone who didn’t want to sign, and Tony was still in charge of a company that could’ve gone down when he did. Still, how could Steve not feel betrayed by the genius’s inability to compromise?
"Turn on the news." He says without looking up; and he's still squinting at his phone like maybe there are words hidden between the spaces of the lettering.
Tony doesn't know much about the mate thing, but he knows how much it hurts when Steve talks to him like that, like he's just
The following morning -- okay, it's more like afternoon because everyone went to sleep pretty late; and in Tony's case, didn't have a moment
You're a minister?"
"Tony?" Steve asks, and while he's not making any move to get closer to him, he's not running off like Tony's half expecting him to. It's almost as though the man is an actual masochist.
"She isn't just a kid,
that." Steve retorts easily enough, and judging by the eye-roll he's being given, he knows just what face he's making as he says it.
"Obadiah gave me the rest of the week to send them the designs for another weapon," Tony sighs as he, too, stands up. He has the bottle of scotch gripped tightly in his hand; and he's really glad he's not as strong as Thor because he would never waste good liquor.
He's not alone, though. Sure, Tony's already seen Bucky, but he takes in the others in the room and everything suddenly clicks into place. Hawkeye's sitting there, with the Black Widow and Dr. Bruce Banner (the Hulk). Thor's there too, sitting on the actual coffee table with a poptart hanging out of his mouth. That left the Winter Soldier, who was obviously Bucky, now that Tony thought harder about it.
"I don't want to be someone that hurts you, Steve. You deserve better than that." He murmurs as his eyes flutter open, and his heart stutters at the look he's being given.
Everyone else turns to stare at Wanda, though Vision’s never seemed to have pulled his gaze away.
Wanda stops mid-air, her eyes slowly circling around her as she takes in her teammates. Her fingers are swirled with red, discolored air, and her eyes are gleaming. Tony, on the other hand, just floats back and settles onto the ground like he's waiting to see how everything pans out before he gets involved.
"Hey! Tony! You ain't eating?" Sam calls after him, and Tony only waves a hand in dismissal as he nears the exit.
He dozes off, thinking of love and family and why neither of them came easy.
Tony rolls his eyes, raising a hand in a light smack against Steve's shoulder, "Come on. You're always taking care of me. I'm a mess in the kitchen so this is all I can do, so let me."
"For you, sir, always." Is the AI's response. J is short for JARVIS, an artificial intelligence program he'd coded when he was younger to help him run Stark Industries. He takes over most of the primary functions when Tony's in the armor, and he's very aware that if he didn't have JARVIS, Iron Man would be nothing but a bug that an enemy could squish.
To see Bucky in his apartment without Steve as a buffer is a strange thing that catches Tony completely off guard.
And Tony knows that look
Steve does, in fact, manage to get to the door before Tony can shut it behind him, and using just his elbow, he barges into the room and slams it shut. He's panting from the exertion, and his entire frame shakes as he leans against the door, but Tony pays no heed to it. He just fumbles in the dark for a light switch. He's not entirely sure why they need light, but there's something he wants to confirm on Steve's expression that he needs the light for.
It works, obviously. Steve releases him onto the surface of the bed and crawls over him with Tony just watching with his jaw slacked.
"Huh." Tony says out loud; and considering his checkered past with his old man, he'd say that's an appropriate reaction.
It's giving him a lot to think about, that's for sure. Tony finishes the rest of his second mug of coffee, and only watches as Bucky rises to refill their mugs again.
"I won't force you to come back with me, Tony." Steve says, then, and it causes Tony's heart to snap even more if that's even possible. He doesn't even lift his head, just speaking into the collar of Tony's tee shirt, "I want you to come back because
They stop at what looks like a long dining table. There's no food in sight, though that's not really a concern for Steve right now. After all, who could eat after a morning like the one they've had?
lukewarm, and an old fashioned flip phone on the table sitting alongside a coiled up charging cord.
"I don't think we should put him through more of her hostility after what she's been doing to him." Sam answers, shaking his head as a hard look crosses his eyes. He won't take an argument on this, and he's probably thinking on Tony's behalf; and while he's spent the latter part of the day criticizing Tony and his previous decisions, Steve can't help but start to hope that just
"Steve." He cuts in, smooth and amused and he can hear the longing in his own tone. Steve can, too, with how his blue eyes dilate again.
As soon as she's back on the ground, Wanda turns back to Steve. For a moment, he's looking at that sweet naïve brunette that lost her brother after a series of bad choices. When the illusion fades, however, he's looking at a bitter, hollow young woman that can't seem to let her own past go and move forward.
His lips are still a little raw from the night before, but Tony doesn't mind the rough bites on them or the way their teeth knock against each other, and he sure as hell doesn't mind when Steve's tongue manages to swirl around his like he wants to taste every inch of Tony.
Tony stares at him, his expression bemused. Of course he wouldn't destroy a building he paid for and had built for his dysfunctional superhero family.
Growling, Steve hurries out of the bathroom; and Tony has just enough time to throw his sweats on and grab a shirt. He runs out of the room, in the direction of the kitchen. Steve's hot on his heels, but Tony knows he'll reach the kitchen first. Tony has the best incentive for moving: coffee.
"I don't want to lose you, Steve." Tony says finally, dropping his head and effectively, his gaze.
"I need more coffee to keep up with him." He tries to mutter under his breath, but he's clearly not as quiet as he thinks he is, because several of them are snickering along.
"Extremis. A serum that was modeled after the one used on Steve," she supplies, because of course she'd have the answers to questions everyone wants to ask, "It regrows limbs, but it was-"
The black and red Iron Man suit falls into a slump on the ground, his arms wrapped tightly around the older battle armor like just imagining letting go is painful.
"I don't know much about the fate thing and maybe I
"I left it in Wakanda to be guarded there where Wanda can't get to it." Vision answers, "I believe she had the intention of handing it over to Thanos himself."
"Tony?" Steve calls out as he steps closer, almost in a creeping fashion because there's no way of knowing how Tony will react.
"Tony!" Steve calls, and without even having to voice what he's planning, he holds his shield up. Although they had a lot of personal disagreements and couldn't get along too well off the field, they've always been able to fight well together.
It doesn't take Tony nearly as long to get there, unfortunately. He supposes it's because it's been years since the last time he's been with anyone, but it might just be because of how Steve manages to be everything Tony's ever wanted. Steve's grip is firm around his length, but it's not too rough that it causes pain, and his teeth against the mark he left causes something akin to posessiveness to build in his chest. He's moaning against Steve's shoulders, his own arms wrapped tightly around Steve's torso. He wonders, then, how it would feel to have Steve inside of him. On one hand, Steve was right that they had plenty of time to do more; but on the other hand, Tony wanted all of Steve, right then and there.
Tony looks up at him, trying to read his expressions, since Steve was always so expressive. There's clear anguish on his face, the glimmer of longing in his eyes, and yet he smiles. He turns back to his sandwich, cut neatly in half, and his own lips twitch upwards into a smile. He scoots down halfway on the bench, reaching to his side and patting the space beside him, "I can't eat all this on my own. Come join me."
More of Steve's touches on his skin, and more of Steve's love. Steve, however, doesn't seem to get the hint. He's still leisurely licking at the mark he's left, and he's nosing along the side of Tony's neck like he just can't get enough of Tony's scent mixed with his, and it's so loving and so teasing at the same time that it's starting to drive Tony crazy from desire.
Halfway there, Tony tells himself; and he gives Steve's wrist another tug. Steve abandons his self-imposed duty and turns fully in his direction, though his hands remain pressed against the counter.
"I'm a collector." Tony answers, and he climbs out of the car to avoid hearing whatever else Bucky has to say about them.
He can't think about it for too long, though, because James leans back in his chair and crosses his arms over his chest. He's an alpha, too, and one that won't just silently sit back and obey. Steve decides he likes that about him, even though he can't tell what the man's thinking about just yet.
." Sam snaps back, "She's a grown ass woman who put her vindication's ahead of a world she's sworn to protect. It doesn't matter what our personal feelings toward each other are. There should be no debate on this in general. We save the world. That's
"Hey, Steve." Tony grins, just a little forced, raising his good hand in a feeble attempt to wave.
It's a relief to know his life wasn't lost in the process, that's for sure. They can use all the help they can get.
They eat together in silence, judged by monks and surveyed by Stephen who had yet to have any sort of joy in having them there; but still, wasn’t this better than the alternative? Of being chased down by a man who they had fought together and against for years?
"Then it's a good thing we're here to help you in whatever capacity you need us to." Sam answers, and there's a wide grin on his face now as he pats Tony once on the shoulder and leaves the garage.
"I don't know about the rest of them, but my people were acrobatics in a small-town circus." Clint defends himself, two hands up in just the defensive manner. He seems to ignore the syrup on them, so the rest silently do the same.
Oh. Of course that's what it is.
"Please. Do not pretend you're doing this out of your feelings of friendship with him." the witch spits out, and Steve can already see the way Tony is tensing out of the corner of his eye, "Youre just here on behalf of the sorcerer who claims we need Stark to save the universe."
Steve responds into it easily, because there really isn't anything better to him than having Tony wrapped up in his arms where Steve knows he'll be safe. He doesn't know enough about science to help Tony build weapons, so he's useless there. He's still learning how to convince Tony to eat regularly and take breaks. He's still unsure of how to convince Tony that his pack is also Tony's pack, but that's something that can't be learned overnight no matter how much he wishes it to be so. But at the end of the day, when Tony is scared or frustrated with himself and can't seem to shake himself out of his thoughts, he knows he can count on Steve; even if he has to be coaxed into vulnerability.
"What are you doing here?" Asks Wanda, cautious and with a hatred that is barely concealed. There's the slightest flicker of red dancing on her finger tips, and while Steve wants to tell her to stand down because Tony isn't their enemy and has never been, he's not sure if he could believe it for himself.
"I want your mouth around me." Steve tells him. His dirty talk needs some work, but it's enough to shoot thrills down his spine to his own cock.
me. You kept going into danger and I had no ide-"
Just as Tony manages to draw his thumb against those astonishingly gorgeous lips, however, Steve's hand shoots up and latches tightly around his wrist. It's not to push him away like he thinks at first; but to keep it steady so Steve can pepper his knuckles with little kisses. They're silent at first, and Tony basks in the warmth and gentle affection that Steve is bathing him in.
"Alright, so let's get down to business." Tony starts off, knowing Rhodey's attempts of diversion and too tired to seriously play along.
"I needed to stop you, because otherwise, you'd have done something you know you wouldn't be able to live with." his eyes are blown open again, and he's trying to express how earnest he's feeling just with his eyes alone, "Even back then, you knew Bucky was innocent. Your emotions took hold of you and you
"If you're not going, I'm not going." Steve responds, and his jaw is set.
as leverage."
"Thank you again, friend Anthony, for sharing your home with us." Thor says, cheerful as ever, and he claps onto Tony's shoulder with a lot more force than necessary. It causes for Tony to knock his chest against the countertop. Thor doesn't even seem to notice that the wind was knocked out of him, just claiming the stool next to him and ignoring the dirty look Sam gives him for taking the seat he was obviously going for.
. Tony, you are mine." Steve tells him, and he's breathless, his entire body shaking like he's fighting himself at this very moment, "You are mine and I can't have you. I know you want me to leave you alone, but I've gone so long without you."
"That thing's about to blow." The Winter Soldier grunts, and he looks entirely like he's about to throw himself onto the alien to subdue the blast.
. Except -- he's a corpse. They thankfully chose not to display a graphic picture of him; and there's a headline underneath that says something along the lines of,
Tony puts the glass down, running his hand through his hair before he lifts his gaze. He hates how his past is now affecting all of their lives, but they have the right to know, seeing as they're always following him.
But when he steps up to the door to the apartment and fumbles with the keyring Steve had given him, the door swings open, and he's stuck staring at a concerned Steve right in the eye.
Tony swallows back the tears that are threatening to spill from his eyelids and reaches up to wrap his arms around Steve's back, pulling him down. His idea is just to pull Steve against his chest and sleep with the blond cradled to his chest, but Steve easily rolls them over so that Tony is on top.
"Sorry for cutting into your hang out time with Bucky." Tony responds; and he knows he sounds like a petulant child.
"Why do you ask?" Tony asks instead, his hand tightening around his clothes and his eyes darting past Steve and wondering if he can get there without Steve trying to pry into his injury.
He flies to Brooklyn instead of taking a car, since there's no point in putting this off any longer. He stops a safe distance away, ducks into an alley to fold the suit up again, and finishes the rest of the way on foot.
He really did think he'd get away with skipping out on his guests, but the moment he got back into garage, he was hit with the scent of honey and musk. He was hit by the rest of Steve's body, too, but he acknowledged the scent before the sturdy chest he slammed into. He pulls back instantly, out of instinct more than anything, and it's Steve's strong arms wrapping around him that keeps him off the floor.
Sam seems to have the ability to read his mind. Or maybe Tony's making things more obvious than he thinks he is.
"I have someone who came out here even though it's dangerous." Tony answers, and Captain America is so obviously taken aback by his words, "If my partner's gonna be walking into danger I might as well do my part to protect-"
at them?"
And then, the proverbial foot drops.
update : I know I make the characters pro-Wanda to a fault. the unfortunate reality of it is that the avengers always had a blind spot when it came to her. they all treated her like a child who needed guidance. and yeah sure maybe she did need it - but not at the cost of losing trust in each other. if it seems too easy, it’s because it is.
The silence is heavy, and there's a sense of mourning mixed in. Even without hearing it, they knew what kind of man Tony Stark was; but still, to have their fears confirmed isn't pleasant. It feels even worse for Steve; because his desire to protect Tony might not be enough for this.
"Steve's gonna give you that
"What are you saying, Tony?" Steve dares in a quiet tone, eyebrows furrowed and eyes gleaming with unshed tears.
annihilate your pack."
"It would feel a lot less weird if you were eating with me." Tony supplies as he finally sits down at the table, and his joints are groaning. He never realizes how tired his body is until he forces himself to take a break, and by Steve's chuckle, he makes it obvious.
Steve looks reluctant to do so, but holds it out anyway, and Tony automatically feels better the moment his armor is in his hands again.
He hates how he's telling them all of this so casually, over dinner. He hates that he barely knows them and hates even more that he expects someone to pity him.
Tony turns to stare at Sam, his expression crossed between confusion, amusement, and something else that can't entirely be read. It causes a little flicker of hope to rise in Steve's chest, though; because while Steve and Tony had gotten off to a rough start, there was no denying that Tony was indeed one of the best men to have ever existed.
Despite not knowing each other very long and having a rocky start to their relationship, Tony finds himself falling a little more in love with Steve than he originally anticipated.
The blond pulls back slowly, and his gaze is stern even though his eyes are wavering, "Even at the worst of our fights, I wouldn't want to hear that you were in trouble from the news. We're married, Tony. You should've told me. I should've been there with you."
Rhodey grumbles under his breath, then pushes the plates away from them to instead bring a piece of paper out of his pocket and unfold it onto the surface of the counter.
"Look at me, sweetheart." Steve's voice, soft but commanding, has him turning his head back as soon as he hears it. Steve reaches forward, bringing one hand to the back of Tony's neck to hold him there as he pulls out again and thrusts all the way back in. Tony gasps, and Steve lunges forward for another kiss, their tongues meeting in the air between them. It's messy and jerky and there's saliva everywhere, but Tony loves it regardless, because Steve doesn't stop moving the entire time, and all of his attention is on Tony.
"Do you want me to stop?" Tony asks, because if Steve says yes, he'll pull away without another attempt. But if Steve wants it, all he has to do is say yes.
Everything was good. The team, broken as it may be and mourning over the loss of cherished teammates they thought and hoped to fight alongside forever, was still fighting against all odds in any capacity they could.
" His tone is melancholic, longing, "
He mulls it over in his head with a quiet grunt, "When the hell did
"Tony, sweetheart." Steve murmurs into his ear, shifting so that they're looking each other in the eye once more. Steve's hand, however, continues its tantalizing touches across Tony's chest, "I don't want to go too fast for you. We've got time for the next step."
Whether they were answers they wanted to hear or not was up for debate.
He's so dazed he doesn't even notice Steve's left for at least a few minutes. By the time his wits return to him and he steps out of the bathroom, the booth Steve and his packmates had taken up were nearly cleared. He gets closer to it with his shoulders drooping in disappointment. It's shortlived disappointment, however, because there's a plate of food that's piping hot, a mog of fresh coffee that
"Lube?" Steve asks against his neck, and Tony feels the dazed smile that covers his expression.
"I've been sitting back and waiting because I'm still new to this team," Bucky grits out, "and she's been nothing but hostile towards Stark. There ain't no honor in how she's treating the dead."
Okay so maybe that made sense. Not much sense, granted, but it still made sense. Still, Tony feels his heart clenching at the words. How unfortunate was this guy that his marriage was to Tony of all people? Young, good looking, exceptionally earnest -- it has to be too good to be true.
"I'll come back and lock up after I take a look at your arms." Steve responds, and with that cheeky little grin on his face, Tony doesn't bother to bite back the roll of his eyes.
If Steve knew that he dreamt of space and car batteries plugged to his chest every night, he wouldn't think that at all. He'd probably run straight for the hills. That should be the reason he tells the blond, he thinks; but he only manages a whimper.
"I must've done something wrong if you've still got this much energy left." Steve says between his grit teeth, ducking his head so he can bite down on Tony's mark. It's not a playful type of nip. In fact, Tony hisses when he feels the sharpness of Steve's teeth.
"Steve?" He calls, his voice low and cautious.
"To be by his side," Steve answers, automatically. He didn't care about whether or not Tony would ever return his feelings or accept him as a mate. He just wanted to be by his mate; to fulfill a promise he made to Tony years ago.
Because he's just a man and his neck is very sensitive, Tony bucks his hips forward. Steve is smirking against his skin; and the next thing he knows, Steve is tugging his shirt from his collarbone, just enough to be able to reach the skin there. Tony gasps, hands coming to clutch onto Steve's shoulders as the blond nips at a small spot on his collarbone and swirls his tongue around the budding bruise.
Steve growls as he's pushed away, a purely primal
Steve looks wounded by his verbal diarrhea; and feeling like an utter coward, Tony pushes past him to the bathroom. Steve doesn't stop him this time, and Tony doesn't know if he should feel good about it or worry that he's already lost his husband.
It's 3 AM, and instead of sleeping, Tony lies awake and stares at the flip phone he's acquired in a mix of skepticism and longing. He hasn't talked to his best friends in years, and there was really no telling of how they'd react if he called them again so suddenly. He couldn't, and wouldn't, blame them if they never wanted to hear from him again, but he has so many questions that only they would be able to answer; and that's the truth. He thinks of Pepper; of her beautiful blonde hair, her unwavering faith and loyalty, and the many times where he couldn't sleep and she'd stay up to talk to him on the phone. He thinks of Rhodey, his unending kindness and good humor, as well as his surge of overprotectiveness. Honestly, it was surprising that Rhodey hadn't already dragged him back home.
He wonders if it's alright for him to feel a little proud and possessive over the fact that he did get Steve after all, but there was history between Steve and Bucky that Tony couldn't even begin to understand.
Tony wants to say no. That they don't need to talk, because what would they talk about? Captain America and Iron Man get along like water and oil.
Clint had been sharing some sort of memory regarding Natasha, but Tony hadn't been paying attention much. Instead, he finds himself looking around the dining room. The old pictures that had been there throughout his childhood are still there, and a picture of Maria on the far wall feels almost life-like in quality. His eyes roam over the fine strokes of the brush on the canvas. He finds himself missing that kind smile, even if it were rare of her to point it in his direction.
"You're injured." Captain notices, waving one uninterested gaze over his body and focusing on the leg with a metal panel that's definitely bent the wrong way.
Well. That answers that.
"Tony, I can't stop you from working all day or force you to sleep and take breaks more," Steve tells him, and there's a warm hand on his shoulder, feeling like an anchor, "but I'm going to need you to work with me on at least eating better."
He can't help the gasp that slips past his lips, because how could Tony even believe that? If they weren't friends, why did they stay up late at night together when each other had a nightmare? If they weren't friends, why did Tony allow him into his private workshop just to sit and draw as he worked? If they weren't friends -- if they weren't friends, why did his heart break for Tony when Pepper left him the first time?
And although he feels his heart clench because he knows this will change everything, he presses his foot onto the briefcase, and the Iron Man armor unfolds and surrounds him. It's a relief to be in his armor again, like coming home; but he can't revel in it.
"Coffee first, words later." Tony gripes, and he makes a beeline to the coffee machine. He grabs a mug and pours the caramel colored liquid into it; and they watch with silent stupification as he chugs the steaming liquid without hesitation.
He looks at the rest of his pack, bewildered. They look right back at him with the same expressions. Really, what
? All I have to do is kiss you and you'll leave me the fuck alone?" Tony is elated by the reveal and all his anger flies out of him as he leans forward with his lips puckered.
Everyone's expectant gaze turns back to Tony, because as much as they don't want to hear it, they need to.
we can do?" Steve asks, and he ignores the crack in his voice. They all do. There has to be something they can do to make sure they don't become Tony's weakness.
"What does that mean?" Steve questions, crouching down to get a closer look at Wanda's expression, "What did you
across the country for years.
"Then you can sit out here and when they get here, you tell them to come in." The metal armed man says now, and after giving the army man a clap on the shoulder, he bumps his shoulder against Tony's and makes his way up the stairs.
him to know that; but he has hope. Maybe this time, hope would be enough.
He only turns after he's gotten his clothes together, and Steve is leaning against the open doorframe with his hands hooked into his underarms like he's trying to keep himself still. Blue eyes sparkle with concern, lips overturned into a frown as he looks Tony over.
It's the first pack he's stumbled across in which Alphas and Betas mingle so freely; and while their personalities are varied, the love and loyalty they have for Steve makes Tony's heart flutter. It makes the situation that much more daunting, and Tony knows he's got no way around it on his own.
"I'll attack even before you manage to let go of that arrow, Barton," Tony warns, and it's incredible that he can feel Clint readying his bow without even looking in the archer's direction. Instead, he's looking at Bucky like the man's a puzzle he can't seem to figure out, "Its my understanding that I misjudged you back in Siberia. As such, I have no qualms with you. Get out of here now before it gets messy."
"You might want to tell him that." Pepper answers with a scoff, raising her hands to rest them on her hips, "He's been calling every day since your, frankly stupid, PR disaster. I mean, really, Tony. Did you
Unknowingly, his eyes shift to Steve, who's with Clint by the stove, his expression full of exasperation like Clint is being way too uncooperative. He didn't even have time to discuss with Steve about what their next steps were now that they were bonded, so was it fair to resume to what they had been doing?
Tony ignores him, moving to the dresser and opening one of the drawers of his side of it. He doesn't have many clothes here, seeing as he does still have the penthouse, but his body is aching for a hot shower and some painkillers.
"Not yet but..." Steve trails off, and the answer is clear even if the wording isn't. He'll just have to work through this somehow. There's no other chance.
"Fuck." Tony curses, and he presses his hand against his lips. His hand is trembling, and the rest of his body is shaking in earnest. He repeats the curse, turns on his heels, and flees the room like he's on fire.
"We're watching the Hobbit," Bruce supplies, his voice gentle but unsure like he can also read the discomfort on Tony, "Are you going to join us?"
Tony's silent for too long, his personality considered. Clint and Natasha hang back with Steve in wait, holding their breaths because their thoughts are mirroring his. Tony pushes both Natasha and Steve away, climbing unsteadily to his feet with the Iron Patriot still gripped tightly in his arms, and steps in the direction of the portal.
It's Wanda who breaks their stalemate; and with a flicker of her wrist, the Iron Patriot suit lifts off the ground and flies straight up above them. There's a lot of damage she can cause by dropping it from a high enough altitude; and just the fact that she'd use Rhodey's suit in such a way causes Steve's heart to stutter.
"Stark," Clint calls from behind them; and though Steve releases his hold of Tony and shifts just one step to the side, he refuses to move too far for Tony to reach again.
Now while he's new to the husbandry thing, he can't help the concern that fills him. Does that mean Steve actually had gotten hurt? Didn't that mean that he failed in his duty to make it safer for him?
, he wasn't planning to run away again. At least, not from him.
"Feels heavier than a briefcase." Captain tells him, short and to the point and is this really the man Tony married? "So if it's not a briefcase, what is it?"
From the slightly higher angle he's on now, he's being given a vantage point. Steve leans back as best he can, his back resting against the post of Tony's bed, and his hands dropping back down to Tony's waist in a much gentler touch. He's content at moving to Tony's pace, and the way their tongues explore without being rushed. When they pull back for air, Steve tilts his head back to rest it against the bedframe. He thinks this is where they'll stop, but Tony keeps pushing. He peppers kisses along Steve's jaw and shifts just enough to kiss down the blond's neck.
"Didn't you just destroy it?" Clint asks, his gaze wavering uncertainly.
Rhodey, having sat mostly silent for the duration of their little show, tilts his head just a little bit, "Huh. I think you've found your people, Tones."
So, he goes to Steve's apartment. It's probably half his at this point, but he's not sure where his relationship with Steve is standing. The blond can turn around and kick him to the curb at any moment, and Tony's just waiting for the shoe to drop.
"Like I said, I’m not mad; but you might be." Tony responds easily, and when their expressions convey how confused they are, his lips press into a firm line, "I got a call earlier today, from Obadiah. They want me to design another weapon. They're blackmailing me, actually, and using all of you as leverage."
"Come! Join us for dinner!" The burly blond man calls out, and Tony's taken aback by the childlike joy in his tone, "Steven! Anthony! Samuel has been regaling us with tales from his previous battles!"
Out of the two of them, Clint is the easiest to deal with. That's a fact.
want to be there. Not because Harold wants you, or because
"Talk to me, sweetheart." The words are gentle and Steve's tone is soft, but there's still that stern quality that Tony finds hard to resist.
? Would he really kill Pepper because of them? Because of what they did to him? Because a fight between them took his best friend's life away?
Tony heaves a sigh, placing his mug down on the counter. He turns around in Steve's arms, politely ignoring the fact that Steve's hips are pressing tightly against his and that the blond's hands are now resting just below his waist. There's the slightest darkening of Steve's eyes that he's just barely able to ignore.
He starts with a tentative lick of the head, and Steve inhales sharply, though he's forcing his hips still. Steve's cock is straining with the effort, precum dripping from the slit. Tony just laps it up, and he ignores the salty taste because it's Steve and it's something he never thought he could have. He swipes his tongue along the shaft, watching as it causes another drop of precum to form at the tip. Steve is moaning beneath him, but quietly and like he's unsure of what's happening, and Tony wants nothing more than to pleasure him. With that, he wraps his lips around the head, tucking his teeth behind them, and he finds himself moaning when Steve bucks into the heat of his mouth.
"Please don't get handsy. I'm a taken man." Tony quips half heartedly, groaning as he forces himself to sit up.
"You were sent to Afghanistan," supplies Wanda, and her features are soft and full of worry. He hates that he's cause someone so gentle even the slightest unhappiness.
this chapter is a lot shorter than previous ones. sorry. I’m just — brain shut down. but yeah I’m sorry for the lack of content. if it sucks — god I really hope it doesn’t suck.
And then he uses the knife to chop his pinky clean off his left hand. Steve gasps, horrified, and he's about to lunge forward because old habits die hard; but as they watch, the skin begins to regrow with a glow of orange light.
But sometimes, that's just the way it is. The Avengers were a team made up of strong personalities and solo fighters who were forced to put their differences aside at least to protect the people that couldn't fight for themselves. When they got their teamwork together and put their pride aside, there was no one in the universe with enough conviction to defeat them.
. Please, sweetheart. Have a little more faith in me."
Tony's on top of him, now, and he looks down to see Steve's eyes full of love and want. Steve has so much self control that it's baffling to him. He ducks his head, capturing Steve's lips in another searing kiss. Steve responds immediately, their tongues brushing against one another, the push and pull between them urging him forward. When he pulls back this time, it's so that he can shimmy down Steve's torso, and Steve watches silently, questions dancing in his gaze until Tony is tucked firmly between his parted legs.
"Tony." Steve calls out again, because he knows Tony well enough by now that the next words to come out of the genius's mouth were going to be meant to tear them down. Sure, he hasn't been hiding his emotions in regards to them; but there's no limit to the verbal arsenal Tony's got equipped.
If he really wants to get under the Captain's skin, he can question the man's leadership or make a quip about how they couldn't handle it without him; but all he can think of is Steve.
The only problem was - how? Tony hated Steve, and the rest of the Avengers. What could they possibly do to change his mind, and was there even the slimmest chance of being able to save him?
Obadiah asks, and his tone is condescending, and it does nothing to ease Tony's panic.
Because of him, because of
“Tony didn’t want us to be slaves.” Natasha bites out, but she’s entirely composed and looks a little disinterested in the conversation, “He wanted oversight on the Avengers. After Sokovia, it was bound to happen regardless of our feelings. Tony just wanted to get ahead of it because out of all of us, he’s got the most to lose.”
Bucky's sitting on his couch, drinking a beer that obviously came from the little fridge, seemingly lost in thought, and Tony looks around for Steve almost anxiously.
, and the
"I knew- I knew it was wrong to let you go off that day." Steve continues, the words seemingly tumbling from his lips and a surprising wetness dripping onto the side of Tony's neck. He knows it's not from Steve's lips the moment he feels it.
to yourself, Tony?"
Surprisingly, Tony laughs. It's bright, but sounds forced. He turns to watch as the monks carry Wanda's body out of the room, then reclaims his seat like nothing's happened.
"Hey, Stark." Natasha is speaking at a normal tone, but she may as well be shouting because the moment her lips move, everyone else falls silent, "What would it take to convince you to postpone for another day? I think I can speak for everyone when I say we really need to rest."
"So which will it be, Avengers?" Stephen asks, and he's oblivious to the team's inner turmoil if the shaking of his shoulders is any indication, "The witch who would rather condemn all of humanity than help the man who will save it? Or the man who is one day away from taking it apart himself?"
, of all people. Despite the very little care or respect they had for each other, Howard thought it was necessary to tell him it's his turn. He thinks about it for a second. Okay, yeah, it's his turn to run Stark Industries. It's what he was raised to do; but that's common knowledge. That's why he spent so much time studying engineering.
"Steve." Tony says, sighing as he tilts his head back, "I don't think I'll ever go back. You know that."
"Buck." His voice comes out in a croak, and his head drops into his hands as a deep, broken breath racks through his frame, "I fucked everything up."
Natasha distracts her using her batons; and while Wanda is powerful, Natasha is fast and more experienced. When Natasha leaves an opening, Steve throws his shield. It knocks into Wanda and Bucky catches it easily. He throws it back in Sam's direction, and their teamwork is effortless and efficient in backing Wanda into a corner.
Vision's nowhere to be seen or heard from, but they've got enough on their hands with just her.
"I was really hoping you'd forget about it."
, even.
The silence stretches on in an uncomfortable manner, and eyes flicker back and forth like no one’s sure of who’d be the first to fill it. In his mind, Steve knows it’s on him as the leader. He knows he should devise a plan on what they do to stop Tony before he manages to undo everything he’d done in the past with a decision that was so unlike him.
kill Tony, but at least they can keep an eye on her in the meantime. Scott follows them through without a second glance, rubbing at the back of his neck out of what was possibly shame.
"Tony?" Steve asks, his voice wavering and his arms reaching forward to him. He doesn't move forward, though, looking like he can't trust himself with Tony at all.
In the end, that seems to be enough to break down the rest of Steve's resolve. Tony's hips are bruised from when Steve reluctantly released his hands and curled his fingers into Tony's waist instead. Steve's spot is brighter now and is joined by another several that seem to paint the alpha's neck. The bed has a serious creak now; and it's not a surprise because no one's really used it since he was a kid. When they finish, Tony's thighs are quaking from exhaustion, and he's limping his way into the bathroom to clean off.
Tony can't really understand why the blond is angry about it, "I can't sit back and wait-"
"There's no weapon in there." He answers, and his jaw is working as he watches Bucky hand the briefcase over to Steve.
"Just what?" Steve asks, and when Tony doesn't meet his gaze, he hooks a finger under the brunet's chin and tips his head back.
His hand slips down towards their crotches, and he's not sure if Steve knows what he's attempting or not, but Tony manages to slip his hand under the waistband of Steve's sweatpants. He's not wearing underwear, and Tony bites back the smirk for until later. This is prime teasing material, after all. Steve only seems to snap himself out of his daze when Tony's slim, calloused fingers curl around the base of his cock, and the blond growls against Tony's skin, bucking into the touch. Tony sees that as a growl of approval, and he's pleased to know Steve wants him as much as Tony wants Steve.
have to be that much taller than him?
"I think... I'm going to go try that nap now." Tony decides, and the rest of them are surprised to hear it. Considering how adverse he is to sleeping, they figured they'd have to force him that way.
The stranger gestures vaguely to the dining table, then moves to sit at the head of it. If they were at the compound, that seat would belong to Steve; but here, there is no Avengers hierarchy. There's just a group of teammates running and hiding like cowards because they have no clue about what's going on.
The Winter Soldier and Captain America are the only other two, aside from himself, that hide their faces behind their masks. They seem to be using modulators for their voices just like himself, too. It's suspicious but at the same time, the three of them have secrets and that's all there is to it.
"Have you called Steve yet?" Pepper asks, and Tony blinks as he turns to stare at her in confusion.
"Steve." He pants out as he tries to pull away, and while the blond's hand stops momentarily to pay attention, he's still nipping at the mark.
"Let's start with introductions. My name is Doctor Stephen Strange, and I am the last line of defense for the spiritual world as we know it. I know who all of you are; and quite frankly, I'm not impressed." His gaze flickers over all of them, and indeed, his lips are curled into a grimace. Steve feels his heart plunging; because if that's the case, why help them?
"Didn't expect to see you here today." Hawkeye quips, and he aims and shoots another arrow even though he's dangling from the Iron Man's grip.
"What will it take to get you off my trail?" He tries again, his anger coiling in his frame and his fists shaking from within their confines.
Everything was good - until it wasn't.
Steve stills instantly, and that's enough of an answer for him.
"Where were we? Something about losing trust and Ultron?" Tony asks, and his suit retracts in his skin to show his face. His expression is blank and his body is poised like he's in a business meeting.
"The day I met you; when you got into that accident and your car hit the water," Steve begins, moistening his lips, "I thought I was too late. Your skin was turning blue, and your seatbelt wouldn't unfasten. I had to tear you out of the seat, Tony; and I didn't think I'd have enough time."
Suddenly, it's not a villain he's looking at, or a bitter rival or a man who forces himself to act nonchalant at the worst times. Instead, he sees someone who thinks he's failed the most important person to him and threw himself into his grief.
As if he had forgotten he was in the presence of company, Tony makes a noise of surprise and forces a smile onto his face, "Yeah. I think so. I -- hold on. I'm reading my texts."
He gathers his wallet and his cellphone, tugs his shoes on, and hurries out the bedroom door. He's not sure of what time it is, but the sun's peeking through the blinds at the window, and the apartment is so silent that the only thing he hears is the sound of his own heartbeat.
Tony's torn between wanting to feel sorry for the man and wanting to punch him.
to talk to Steve again.
to mourn? He wanted to cry. No, he actually didn't. But he wanted to feel
There's another wave of bile churning in his gut trying to climb its way out. No. Tony no longer considered them friends and had said so in that bunker in Siberia. Steve chose a side, and Tony chose another. As far as Tony Stark is concerned, the world would be better off without Steve and the Avengers he was no longer a part of.
And that's the truth. No one could protest that. Tony was brilliant and arrogant and always trying to one-up himself.
"There's a huge collection of DVDs in the entertainment room!" Clint shoots back with his eyes narrowed in irritation.
It's meant to be a joke, but he sees the way all four of them tense like they're not sure of his intentions. He bites back the roll of his eyes, as difficult as that is for him, and turns his attention to Steve. The blond is staring right back at him, eyes narrowed ever so slightly as if he's trying to assess him. Tony tries to keep his shoulders squared, really, but can tell his face is flushing from the attention. Curse that mate dynamic, really.
"There's no fixing us, is there?" Steve asks, the words coming out weak and frightened. He knows the answer, but hopes he's wrong.
Why did he think being around Steve would be a good idea? He knows he's the one to propose that they spend time together at least once a week, but he really hadn't expected for his body to react as strongly as it had. He also didn't expect the metal-armed man or how Steve reacted to
"You're fucking Captain America." Tony croaks out, and he really should've seen this coming earlier. Steve always went out when the Avengers were called out, and JARVIS never had any reading on his beautiful blond hair when Tony went looking for him.
"It was a reflex!" He calls out, and he drops the shield because he really should've known better than to pick it up again without the brunet's say-so.
The group disperses quickly, and Tony stares at their fading backs wondering if he can subtly leave before Steve can throw a punch.
It's another voice trying, now; and though deep down he knows it's Steve's, he just can't tear his ey-
Clint has his bow and arrows out, and he's shooting right at Tony with the very intention of taking him out, and it's no small feat that Tony is able to blast through the incoming arrow and blast Clint backwards against the wall. And then Natasha flings herself over the counter in his direction and -
JARVIS is quiet for a long beat, considering what he's supposed to say to Tony's claim; but Tony just grabs the briefcase that's been set aside for him to take and leaves the workshop. His leg hurts, but that can be taken care of when he gets home. Happy, his driver, pulls up in front of the building; and it's a very eccentric behavior that he'll admit to but he doesn't allow anyone to drive him when they're in a car together.
It doesn't mean he won't try, though.
"Put her down, Buck." Steve tells his best friend, and his jaw is clenched tight.
Everyone's there from both of their lives, including a man named Sam Wilson who's a hero that works mostly out of Washington, D.C.
"Uh. Yeah." Scott answers, the faintest of smiles pulling at the edge of his lips, "We were talking about Wanda and it didn't go too well."
The door opens in front of him, and Tony looks up at Bucky in mild surprise. He's waiting for the other brunet to throw a fist, but Bucky just stands aside and waves a hand inward, expecting Tony to walk into the apartment.
No. It really doesn't sound outlandish, not that he'd admit that to her. He frowns and tilts his head back to look up at his hotel room's ceiling. Losing a mate, even one you're not bonded to yet, can cause the deepest heartbreak. A lot of times, wolves that lose their mates go insane, and Tony can't imagine what that's like for anyone. He sure as hell doesn't like the idea of doing it to Steve.
He asks, raising a hand to let his finger graze over his swollen lower lip. He was still thinking about that kiss they shared. Just like he had thought, it would be impossible to forget Steve now that they've had a taste for each other. When there's no answer coming from her end of the call, Tony finds the determination to plow through,
"Come inside me, Steve."
That choice of wording seems to do the trick, and Steve nods to himself in determination. Instead of taking his hand and just walking together into the bedroom, he uses the offered hand as leverage and hooks his other arm under Tony's legs.
He gets back off the stool, lips pursed as he mentally outweighed his options. Would he really run away now, like a coward? He's sure the rest of his guests are happily unpacked inside the house, and his thoughts are confirmed when he ducks around the corner of the house and notices the second car parked out front. It hadn't been there when he had been out there earlier, that's for sure. He creeps closer to it, quietly exhaling in relief when he noted both cars were empty. The coast was clear, just as he was hoping.
Wanda had never been this spiteful in all the time she'd been part of the Avengers. Had she?
Everything was good. They returned to normal lives, laughing and training and enjoying each other's company like the Avengers were back and better than ever, but it was forced and unnatural.
Tony leans his head just enough to take a look at the blond, counting the long, beautiful lashes that caress his pale cheeks. His eyes are at half mass, lips quirked ever so slightly into a smile. They've been married for weeks, but moments like these are rare and they've yet to even have their first kiss. He knows it's not the norm for a married couple, and yet, he likes knowing they're not rushed into anything with each other.
He presses a kiss to the top of Tony's head, and Tony can hear the words that Steve isn't saying, the
They follow the arrogant man who had yet to tell them his name; because honestly, what position are they in that they can do about anything else?
"Stark." Natasha greets through thinly pressed lips, because she sees no reason to sit through an awkward silence. She's the most relaxed out of all of them, a trait that Tony's suddenly jealous of, "Is this where you're staying tonight?"
"And I appreciate that. I do, Steve." Bucky responds, calm and mature and Steve's decidedly taken aback by his friend's disposition, "But I think that right now, you need to let Stark know it was never about choosing me over him. Because if the roles were reversed, I would've felt the same way."
"Tony!" He calls out, but Tony might not even be listening to him because he just continues walking in the direction of the garage.
And even though he's not sure if they can provide the kind of help he needs to get the work done, Tony does find himself a little reassured. Sam's not the first of the pack he's met, but the man does know his way with words; and that's a fact.
"What do you know of alternate realities?" Stephen asks instead, and the change in subject is so extreme that everyone just stares at him and waits.
”So let’s get down to business.” Stephen decides, and Steve can’t help the way his body uncoils from the tension. At least this time he doesn’t have to pretend he’s braver or stronger than anyone else, “Tomorrow is the day Tony Stark abandons humanity, which means today might be the only way we can stop what’s to come.”
Steve's answer is instantaneous, and Tony can just imagine the scowl on his face.
And then he remembered Rhodey telling him about the designs Pepper had found on Obadiah's desk. They're usually very careful and it would've replaced the design before Obadiah knew it was gone; but there's still the chance that he knew regardless. Now that Howard was dead, all he had to do was take Tony out. His friends, too. He's not worried about Rhodey or Pepper; and even if he were, he'd get there before Obadiah could touch a hair on their heads.
Unfortunately, Tony's strengths don't include emotional vulnerability. As it is, just being around Steve makes his brain short circuit; and with all the questions between them and all the outside variables, it's hard for Tony to get his brain to stop focusing on all the things that can go wrong. Steve has to leave, though he seems reluctant to, so that he can eat dinner with his pack. Tony wants to ask him to stay, but his head is ducked as he fiddles with a wrench from his toolkit. Steve can't see his expression, so it's fair that he assumes he's being kicked out of the garage.
to me." Tony answers with a sigh, and he's aware of his shoulders dropping, "I'll give you some space. I have to go to Malibu for a while anyway to deal with SI projects."
"Fuck. Steve. You don't need a broken old man like me. You can have anyone." He grunts, and he almost manages to push his way out of Steve's grasp, but the tall blond pulls him closer and tightens his grip and Tony almost crumbles against him.
Steve glares at her, even knowing that she's only looking out for his best interests. Sleep can wait until Tony's beside him again. Steve's too wired and frustrated for even a wink of rest.
His first stop in New York is the tower, obviously. He knows he should at least call Steve and explain, or apologize; but he did say he wanted to give Steve space, and Steve never disagreed.
"There's a lot to be said, and you
how right this is. To be within Steve's arms, being held like he's the most important thing Steve's ever had in his life.
"Tony, there has to be another way." Bruce says in agreement, but his voice is softer than Steve's is, and there's a pleading look in his eye.
But then, Steve raises his hand and uses it to cover his face - his face that's covered in tears -, and Tony realizes that no, Steve doesn't actually know that they'll be okay. There's no way
There's a lot of information there, but the one thing that everyone picks up on immediately is the name Ultron.
"I'm not part of your team,
He's unsure of whom to call first. He definitely doesn't want to call his Howard. What more had to be said between them, anyway? Howard hadn't felt like family since he was an infant. The only other name in the phone is Steve. He can't call the blond, he tells himself. He's still so unsure of what they are and what they could be, and Tony's terrified about what having and being a mate entails.
Steve manages just the slightest quirk of his lips, leaning down just enough for his breath to ghost against Tony's earlobe, "If you've still got some energy left, I think I got something to help burn it out."
"I've seen it." Steve answers, and that rueful little grin is back as he finally leans away, "If it makes you feel any better about this, I had no idea of who you were when I met you last night."
"Tony's the one who figured it out." James supplies, lips curling into a grimace that Steve for one agrees with completely.
Tony turns his head anyway, focusing his attention on Bucky. The metal-armed man is staring at him impassively, his lips pressed into a thin line. His eyes seem to narrow onto Tony's neck, where Tony knows Steve's mark isn't covered like it maybe should be.
"Unstable? Yeah," Tony answers, and with a flicker of his eyes, the rest of the suit beings seeping out of his skin, "but I fixed it. Go ahead, Rogers. Ask me who I am out of the suit."
The first week together is awkward but manageable. Steve goes off to his super secret government job that Tony pretends he's not dying to learn more about. Tony works at his company and comes home late, pretending Pepper isn't as amused as she is.
Steve kisses him with intensity, his mouth open and willing and his tongue licking its way into Tony's mouth and searching. He's as desperate as Tony feels, and Tony answers his kiss with just as much eagerness and desperation. Tony's hands are the first to wander, feeling at the muscles that he realizes are
"You deserve it," Rhodey answers, smug as always; but just before the trio gets to them, he veers off in Bucky's direction. They kiss, though it's just a chaste touch of their lips. Tony feels like a fish with its jaw slack, "When did -"
The movie seems to stretch out longer than it should, and Tony can see some of the others starting to nod off. Bucky might actually be snoring, but Tony doesn't feel the need to check for himself to confirm on the thought of it. Really, he feels he should be a little guiltier about not being able to pay more attention to Steve when the alpa is spending more of his attention on the genius than the movie. Steve's just as anxious as he feels, or maybe it's because of how Tony's acting that he seems that way.
Steve has Clint on Tony watch; not that he's afraid Tony will run away again but because the very idea of Tony being alone again disturbs what little peace he's still holding onto, and the rest of them hole up in the kitchen to be prepared for whatever else is to come. Nobody's slept since Tony disappeared into the garage, waiting on the sidelines in case he needed their help; but Steve is anxious and unsettled.
When he gets to the fight, Hawkeye is falling from the side of a building. Iron Man swoops down, catching him by the back of his suit easily.
"You know that's not going to work." Tony mutters, and Steve's face falls considerably. For an alpha, he's surprisingly emotional, "But I'll make a compromise."
As if the future couldn't get any weirder.
The first thing he does when he gets to his private floor is grab a bottle of whiskey. His favorite kind, he thinks; a present from Howard when he graduated high school as a teenager. He never actually went to the graduation for his son. and while the rest of Tony's older classmates had proud family members cheering for him, Tony was alone. And yeah, maybe it was just that Howard was incapable of showing him love; but was he really at fault for not
Rhodey is silent for a long moment, which is good, because it allows Tony to pull into his head. Everyone else is quiet, too, trying so hard to act like they're not fully invested in the conversation, but Tony's not able to think about them. Obadiah knew of the damage that the Jericho had done; even more than Howard himself did. Sure, he didn't love Obadiah, and sure, he was threatening people that had nothing to do with them so that Tony would build him more weaponry -- but ... is Obadiah really the type of man that would steal his blueprints and sell them anyway when he knows the engineer's strong feelings opposing of it?
There's always been a chance of one of his enemies finding his true identity and coming for him; and while he's not afraid of dying, he is afraid of dragging Steve into his twisted reality. He fingers the bracelet sitting on his wrist, knowing that just a twist of it will encase his hand with the gauntlet of his Iron Man gauntlet. It's not much, but it'll be enough of a distraction if someone is, in fact, in their apartment.
The blond is quiet for a beat, then lowers his head in what might just be a nod, "I don't want you to feel like I'm just using you for your money, Tony. I know I don't have the money you do, but I can take care of the both of us."
Raising his head high, Tony turns heel and saunters into the mens room. Just a moment after he walks in, the door swings open behind him, and he's pulled roughly. His back collides with the door, but it's neither too rough or too gentle for him. He's still dizzy, though, and the gasp that flows out of him is swallowed along with any air that was in his lungs. Instead, everything's consumed by
His forehead is creased much like it was earlier, and Tony understands it's probably because he's still covered in oil; but it might be because his anxiety is showing on his body, clear as day.
"Is this a come on?" Tony asks, trying to go with a humored approach instead of denying it outright because he hasn't shown off his body since before Afghanistan.
Regardless of motive, it leaves one fact painfully obvious.
Tony doesn't know why he deflates at the tone of disappointment Steve is using on him, but he does anyway; but the disappointment is followed by an ache to make the blond proud. He never thought it was that easy to want to change the person he's always been, but for Steve, he wants to at least try.
?" Tony asks, mortified, horrified, terrified, petrified -- all the fied's, "Why the hell would you follow me for two fucking years? Don't you guys have -- lives?"
"Steve!" He calls, a little rougher this time and wincing at the pain shooting through his arm, "It's me. Tony. You're safe, honey."
And then he kind of convinces himself to save Tony because he wants to make it happen. One glance in Natasha's direction tells him she thinks the same.
Tony doesn't answer, just shifts forward until he's on the ground with the alpha. Steve watches, his jaw set and his eyes wavering with unshed tears. Tony wonders what it would take to reassure Steve that
His thoughts are cut off when his vision is cut off; and instead of looking at his best friend, Pepper is right in his face. Her face is red from frustration, which is understandable; and her hands are planted firmly on her hips as she peers up at him, "You need to go get dressed. We're going to be late!"
He puts the emphasis on 'our' because he wants so desperately for Tony to know that he
And in that very same second that he thinks so, Bucky snickers and says, "You're telling me."
Tony grits out, and though he knows what Obadiah's looking for, he needs it to be said
Tony swallows, hard. Steve could never find out he's Iron Man, if he's having nightmares like this.
The answering stare he receives from Tony could have wilted him. His jaw is trembling as he grinds it, his hands trembling even as he seems to be physically holding them still.
"I would deserve it." Steve answers with a shrug, and he watches again as Tony licks his lips. They're not particularly dry or chapped, but they may as well be with how insistently he's moistening them.
." And his voice is as cold as ice as he brings his hands together; but just before his hands meet and his plan is executed, orange light fills the room.
Steve nudges him from behind, but gently enough that he knows he isn't being forced to move. It's only then that he remembers the rest of the group. Tony's eyes roam over them. Natasha is here, of course, sitting beside Clint and eyeing Tony with interest. Clint himself is more interested in the chicken leg on his plate -- what's left of it, more like. Bucky and the other man are there too, though Bucky's intense gaze is something Tony pointedly ignores. Really, he needs a lot of alcohol to even engage with the man at this point. There are two others; a big burly man with blond hair and a cheerful disposition, and another woman with long brunette locks. The only thing he can really tell about her upon first glance is that she looks young.
Tony turns to look at him, but his gaze is far away as a longing smile twitches at the corners of his lips, "There's nothing that can be fixed, Steve. We were barely friends when we went into the Accords."
And this time, Tony doesn't bother hiding the roll of his eyes. No one else is around to see it, anyway,
, I just couldn't stomach it. I built a robot skeleton and a miniature arc reactor, and when I was
Oh. Okay. That makes sense. Still, the idea of Steve going out there when he's no match for an alien makes his stomach churn.
"What's on your mind, punk?" Bucky asks, one eyebrow raised as he crosses his arms over his chest and leans back against the counter.
"It happened, now all we can do is move forward." Steve replies, and he turns to his side, leaning his back against the counter and crossing his arms over his chest. Tony tries not to dwell on the image of those beautiful muscles flexing.
Tony's mom died when he was 17, right after he graduated from his bachelor's program at MIT. He was at home for the summer, with no plans of the future and just wasting away at celebrity parties he was invited to just because of who his father was. Howard and his mother, Maria, were busy that summer, too; invited to house parties, boat parties, movie premiers, and even the occasional gala. But all of a sudden, Maria got sick. It wasn't really all of a sudden, but Starks don't let the outside world see their vulnerabilities, and she died a very slow and painful death with Tony by her side and no Howard to be seen.
An eyebrow quirks at the words, but Tony remains silent. Feelings are rarely simple.
"Oh, wow," Bruce says with a low whistle, from where he's frozen at the end of the group, "This is such a great set up."
"Where'd - where'd he go?" Steve asks, and both former assassins ignore the wobble in his voice. He's extremely grateful for that.
weapons manufactoring company in the world.
Steve knows he's gaping, openly. It's easy to forget that Sam has a background in counseling, because they've always been on the same side and always provided a united front.
"Oh, right! I saw a sweet home theater set up last night when I was looking around!" Clint chirps out, like nothing else is as important, and like he's entitled to whatever he wants, "Let's make it a movie night tonight."
And really, he'd stay out of any fight that has the Avengers team nearby, just out of spite; but now he has a reason to get himself involved, and that reason is the earnest, kindhearted man that's out there in a fight he's got no business in.
wasn't something to be made light of.
"Why protect us and bring us home if you're so hell bent on killing us?" Scott demands, his voice going up an octave in an almost hysterical tone.
"Yes, sweetheart?" Steve asks, his voice soft and seductive and it nearly makes Tony forget what he was going to ask for.
still the man who was willing to throw his life away to save everyone else's. That had never changed from the first time they battled together.
Just for that moment, the world fades away and leaves just Steve and Tony staring at each other. It's such a fragile moment between them; covered with scars and damaged tissue that can't be repaired by words or actions or time. There's no telling what Tony will do in retaliation, either. If he really wanted to, Tony could kill Steve before the rest of the team had a second to react; and Steve would let him.
She turns to Tony again, and there's a little dangerous spark in her eye as she smirks, "You blame us for it; but in the end, James is dead because of you."
Tony doesn't hide his grimace, "They've got government affiliated packs, not to mention federal guards; also not to mention how they can destroy you fiscally."
"Tony, I don't want you to fear me."
"Stark. We're here." Bucky announces, and they're just in front of the tower.
Blinking, Tony looks around for a free seat at the table, but he really doesn't need to. There are two, one at the head of the table and one perpendicular to it. Tony kind of assumes where he's supposed to sit, but doesn't think too much about it. After all, Steve was the alpha of his pack.
"What did she do?" Sam asks now, eyebrows furrowed as he looks between them again.
"Tony, are you okay?" Bruce asks next, and Tony looks at him for a second, following it up by swallowing the entire glass of scotch in a single gulp.
There's snickering coming from the group even as Sam steps back and hauls Clint back over to them. It's a nice change of pace from how serious everyone was, including him, earlier in the day. The pack doesn't know much about his life prior to meeting him and what they were told from Howard; but they don't seem to hate him just yet from what they are seeing.
He reminds her, but he's fidgeting with the hem of his shirt the way he always had as a child.
"I got it." He answers, and he dips down to grab the alien, shooting straight up into the sky. It's a good thing he took care of the icing problem earlier on, huh?
The way he says it, with his lips curled back in disgust, causes Steve's heart to constrict. The way James talks about it makes it sound like there's more to the story.
Loving, bright Tony with his smart and cutting words and his many complex gadgets and his ability to make everyone feel welcome and warm or like they're being tossed into a lion's den when he can't find a redeeming quality in them. Tony was now treating him, and the rest of their team, with the kind of hatred even the worst of Iron Man's enemies hadn't received.
"So let me guess how much Howard's paying you to follow me." Tony says between grit teeth, standing at the foot of the booth where Steve and his packmates are sitting. There are stacks of empty plates on the table and one full plate remaining, and Tony can't understand why the thought of that bugs him.
"What do we do about her now?" Clint asks, and he's drawing an arrow in case she makes any sudden movements.
Sam hums as he stands up, collecting the mug that Tony somehow emptied without even realizing it, "Sometimes, I ask myself the same thing. Not about you, but Clint. Man makes a pig pen look clean. But I'll answer what you really mean to ask. You might not see it, but you ground Steve in a way I've never seen. You're
He's pulled from his musings as he hears the rumble of an engine. He glances down at his cell phone and raises an eyebrow. It must've been an hour since he got to the property, so why did it take them so long to arrive? Now that he knows they're always on his tail, he's come to expect them more often than not. If he was in traffic, they were a few cars behind. If it was a long stretch of a road, they were just within the scope of his rearview mirror. If he stopped to get coffee, their car would be parked a little distance away. He was annoyed, but also endeared by their efforts to stay close to him.
"What? Us getting married?" Steve is so calm and casual about it, but his ear tips are turning pink and his fingers are twitching as he holds the mug back out in Tony's direction, "Yeah. It happened."
"I wouldn't let you, even if you wanted to." Tony answers, and his grin is genuine as he pats Bucky's hand and stands up, "He makes me happier than anything in this decade, too."
What kind of captain would let a situation like this spiral so badly?
"They served a tour in Iraq together," Sam continues, and Tony feels that familiar churn of jealousy in his stomach. He knows he's got nothing to be jealous of, and yet, he is. Sam doesn't notice, or doesn't comment on it, and continues plowing through the story, "I can't tell you much out of confidentiality, but Bucky lost his arm and got discharged early, but Steve finished his tour. They're still haunted by it, even if they don't talk much about it."
When he looks around him at the room, he's almost mortified by the beige walls and hospital covers surrounding him. It almost feels like he's in a psych ward. Oh god. Is that what happened? Did Pepper finally get tired of his workshop binges and late nights and drop him off in a hospital?
Steve shoots him a glance that's full of bemusement, but his features soften as he lifts a hand and brings it to Tony's face. The brunet feels his heart skip a beat as he angles into the touch, and Steve carefully wipes a smudge of what's probably motor oil from his forehead. Tony finds he's baffled by Steve's penchance to take care of him.
"Here. Drink some of this tea." Wanda offers, and she's holding out a little cup that smells like perfume, "Bruce thinks your sleep deprivation is increasing your emotional distress, so I poured you some of my sleepytime tea."
"I don't want you." Wanda hisses to the group, and with another burst of power, she brings the ceiling down.
"You wanna talk about it, punk?" Bucky asks, and though it's not entirely forced, it comes out uneasily, like Bucky's not sure why he's the one who's comforting Steve.
"I had the house stocked a few days ago."
Tony's amused as he checks the message. Steve is sweet and charming but also sassy and petulant. It's a fun combination, he thinks.
Steve seems to be having an internal war of his own, "You won't even see me again. It won't be like today. I'll just watch from the distance to make sure you're okay."
It takes a long time for him to realize that Steve's talking to him, though his gentle voice is now replaced with the Captain's demanding tone instead.
Considering Steve's length, he believes that much is true. He doesn't say anything, though, just quietly marvels at the thickness of Steve's dick and wondering how it would taste. He angles himself closer, reaching out with a tentative swipe of his tongue to lick up a drop of precum that's leaking out of the tip. Steve hisses at the heat of his mouth, hips jerking instinctively.
When the sobs quiet down fully and the tears stop falling, Tony is suddenly aware of the situation. Steve, who barely knows him, is letting him cry against him and ruin his clothes with tears and snot. He's embarrassed by his own lack of control. He tries to pull back, to try and regain some of his dignity, but Steve has a grip around him that's so tight he almost feels like a boa constrictor.
Just like that, Tony snaps out of it. At least, he's able to pretend he has. He would be leaving in the morning as it is, there's no reason to get himself anxious about old memories.
"Does that mean you're giving me away at the wedding?" It's meant as a joke, and Rhodey scoffs his amusement, but several gazes snap in their direction at the insinuation.
He can't help the chuckle that passes his lips. He can just imagine the look on Steve's face, and it causes the jealousy that was there to be completely replaced by adoration.
"Yes. Anthony Stark." Tony confirms, and he registers the recognition flickering in Steve's eyes, "You might have seen my building?"
"Don't you dare act like you've had no part to play in it." Tony hisses back. It's the first time he's verbally responded to her negativity; and Steve wonders why she was possibly able to get under his skin in the first place.
"Yeah, well." Tony answers with a shake of his shoulders, and then he steps back and turns his repulsor boots back on, "I never had a reason to be sentimental until now."
The kiss provides as a distraction as one of Steve's fingers trace the rim of his hole, and when Steve plunges his tongue into Tony's mouth, a finger teases its way into Tony. It's not painful, but it's a foreign feeling, and Tony feels himself clench as his body tries to reject the finger. Steve soothes him with gentle kisses to his mark. His body does eventually adjust to the feeling of it, and when the second finger is added, Tony barely feels the difference. The third finger, he does feel, but it's only just a little wider than the two. He knows for a fact that Steve is thicker than the fingers in him, but the prep will help. The fingers curl within him, and his body jerks when Steve's knuckles brush against his prostrate. He cries out in pleasure, and Steve looks so smug as he continues brushing along Tony's prostate.
At that moment, Clint walks back into the kitchen, lips pressed together in a tight smile, "He's coming out."
Wait, Tony's strolling past him. Why's Tony strolling past him? He just literally tucked Tony into bed -- has it even been an hour since he left the room? Should he have stayed and curled up next to the brunet just in case something like this were going to happen? He gets Tony's desperation better now that James had explained some of his behavior, but to completely ignore his body? Steve would do anything to ease the ache from his chest.
Is all Steve replies with, and Tony scoffs as he ends the call.
"You're the only
"She has powers to manipulate the mind." Natasha answers for him, her tone quiet and possibly ashamed, "She showed me my past, one that I wasn't crazy about. Tony said something about what he was shown, too."
Steve casts a glance at the small cup in his hands, wondering if accepting a refill would be welcomed or judged. Strange doesn’t put on any airs about how he feels towards the team. If he didn’t want to take care of them, he wouldn’t. In that sense, he was a lot like Tony Stark.
"It's not like that, Steve." Tony says, flustered and rushed like he doesn't know what he's supposed to say, "Sam told me you were in the army once -- you and Bucky; and every time I think about weapons now, I can only imagine one of you getting hit by something
"Oh god. There's two of you." Bucky snorts, and he helps them cook and set the table, and Tony cleans up when Steve and Bucky move to the couch to bitch about whatever baseball team is playing that night.
"What do you want, Steve?" He asks, his voice low and husky, and his tongue still running teasing stripes along the blond's shaft.
Tossing his phone onto the bed, he grunts. Steve really doesn't make much sense to him. Tony believes in science and research, not following after his heart despite how much it can hurt. He's only human, after all -- wait, no he's not only human, he's also werewolf. Regardless, his brain is the only thing he will follow. Steve can follow him as much as his bulky heart requires. Tony can't pay more attention to that than he does to himself and his dreams.
from him, dread starts to pool in the depths of his gut.
When he pokes his head into Pepper's office, the redhead looks understandably shook. She understands the dangers of being Iron Man, but has never agreed with Tony's incessant need to put himself in danger. She's nearly choking him in a hug, and he holds her tight wirh murmured apologies pressed into her hair.
He freezes in the threshold of the room, and all the conversation that had been going on stills at once. Everyone's looking in their direction, and Tony feels overwhelmed in a way he hasn't in years.
"Hey, what about the garage door?" Tony asks, half to change the subject from the emotional vulnerability, and half because he doesn't want anyone driving off with his car.
Steve's hands, just lightly gripping at either side of his waist, tighten their hold. Tony can see the gears in his head turning and finds himself wondering what it is Steve is thinking about. It's not his business entirely, but he can't blame himself for being curious.
He takes a long moment to process what she's saying, though he's not entirely sure what to make of it. Okay, so did Steve know ahead of time that they were mates? Was he friends with Howard? Was Steve at Maria's funeral? What
A sharp inhale is heard over the line, and Tony's head drops even though no one's around to see it. It feels awful just to know he's doing this to someone else, especially someone like Steve. The blond breathes deeply, then releases a shallow, empty chuckle, "
"Why does it always come down to an explosion?" Tony asks, and it's a rhetoric question that sounds petulant in his own ears.
"Tony." Steve calls out, and everyone's attention turns to him now. They've had so many explosive conversations in the past and even without the Accords. There's no telling what Steve will say or how Tony will react.
"I still think we should go in there with the intention of saving both." Steve decides, and it's such a naïve way of thinking that Tony would really be mocking him for if they were on the same side; but they're Avengers and at the end of the day, even if they can't save everyone, they'd try their damned best to.
In the end, that's what causes the dam to break. The fact that Steve was so understanding and accepting of him despite his flaws and his tendency to run away. Despite how Steve had an entire pack and a former lover and all the world in his hands and
"You're my husband now, Tony." Steve tells him, gentle and full of affection as he presses another kiss onto Tony's bare knee, "I'll worry about you for the rest of my life. That's just what being married means."
However, when the stove is turned off and Bruce joins them at the long table in the kitchen to eat, the sound of helicopter blades has everyone freezing where they stood or sat. That includes Tony, who is silently wondering if maybe Obadiah was planning to try some stupid shit so early in the morning. Or afternoon. Whatever time of day it was.
Just as he's about to answer, Steve walks into the kitchen, looking all sorts of restless until his eyes fall onto Tony. He eyes Bucky in suspicion for the briefest moment, but his eyes return to Tony and there's so much
"You knew about that?" Steve asks, bewildered. That was a call sign he used while resuming Avengers-level operations overseas. No one was supposed to know who he was.
"Are you sure you're in the right mind?" Steve asks, and Tony moves back enough to see Steve's entire face. Of coursee Steve would stop to ask if Tony felt like he was being taken advantage of in this type of situation.
things can be mended.
"-ny?"
him. Not when he's looking at Tony with so much love that it practically encompasses the entire room.
And this is where the story gets harder to tell. He's sweating now, his lungs constricting just from the memories. He's never really told anyone outside of Howard and Obadiah what had happened there, and this is a group he barely knows.
Tony had gone through so much, and most of it on his own. Steve felt like nothing more than a failure of a mate to know his one and only was going through so much and there was so little he could do about it.
"Right. I went to Afghanistan, and when I was on my way from the demonstration to where I was staying on the base, the convoy I was in was attacked. They threw my own missles at us. The last thing I saw was my name on the side of it." He scoffs at the reminder of it, tilting his head back to look at the ceiling. If fate were a person, right now, he'd ask if they were amused, "I woke up in a cave. There was a hole in my chest and a small electromagnet in the cavity, powered by an actual fucking car battery, the fucking jackasses. It was meant to keep the shrapnel from getting to my heart, but I mean, really-"
Tony brushes past him, taking a seat at the edge of one of the bunk beds. Steve decides pointedly not to tell him it's Clint's bed. There's no telling how Tony would react to that.
Tony just gapes at him, his mouth dry as his heartbeat picks up. Steve had already told him he would die if Tony wasn't serious about it -well, maybe not in those exact words-, but hearing it from someone who clearly had some sort of love for the alpha was something different entirely.
Everyone turns to Tony in expectation, and the brunet has a haunted look on his face. He's a little pale, too, beads of sweat forming on his forehead despite the cool air surrounding them.
"I'm sure we can conjure up something for you," a voice quips from behind them. It's dry and arrogant and has Steve immediately thinking of Tony; but when he turns around, it sure as hell isn't Tony looking back at him. The man is roughly of the same age as the engineer, but there's a cloak on his back and he's walking with a sense of purpose.
"It won't be fair if the others have to camp out in the woods." The ex-army man mutters under his breath, like Tony's not supposed to hear, but Tony isn't stupid and they all know that.
He steps forward slowly, reaching out and wrapping his fingers around Steve's wrist and giving it a little tug. Steve places the bag of popcorn down and turns just his head, eyebrows raised in question.
"When did this team fall apart?" Sam asks, and his eyes are closed as he does, "You were all so strong and took on threats together; so you tell me. When did the Avengers stop trusting each other?"
Steve is silent for a moment, his lips curling into a bittersweet sort of smile. His head dips forward, forehead pressing against Tony's like he's trying so hard to get closer. His eyes are still open, and while their eyes are crossing ever so slightly as they gaze at each other, Steve's gaze is undeniably soft.
"Right! That brings me to the next topic." Tony claps his hands together in a false act of bravado, and he really doesn't know how they're going to react to what he says next, "I'm not entirely mad about this, by the way; because you didn't know the consequences that would come along with it, but uh -- you've been keeping in contact with Howard, haven't you?"
"You weren't here." Tony says, vehemently and with his shoulders dropping forward, "None of you were here. You left me a phone and a letter - like an afterthought. You left me alone."
They take care of the battle eventually, and everyone leaves with minimal injuries, but his mood is decidedly foul when he eventually pulls up to the apartment.
They'll be waiting, as a
Steve doesn't stop there. His tongue laps at the mark greedily his breath brushing against Tony's earlobe and causing the slighter to shudder against him. Tony might be whining, but he's never felt less control of his body as he does in that moment. He wants
Everything was good, until the glass windows cave in from a high-powered repulsor blast that comes from close range. There's not really much of a warning before it, either. Let it be known that when he really wants to be unnoticed, Tony can be deadlier than even the spy assassins he was once on the same team with.
"A kiss.
Steve scoffs in amusement and doesn't bother holding back the roll of his eyes, but he does what is requested of him and jogs back to where he'd flung it off to earlier. Tony's still waiting for him, one foot into the portal with his head turned back to watch with silent intent.
His face is red from the exertion, his body twitching in overstimulation, and Tony loves knowing
The entire time he's pulled along, Tony is protesting. His words fall onto deaf ears and he usually hates being ignored, but Steve still looks at him when he talks and squeezes his hand when he feels that Tony is getting more anxious. This is the first time Tony's stepped into the house since before his mother passed away, too, and that seems to make the entire situation much more difficult to bear. Especially when he walks into the dining room, and all the memories he's had of it are being replaced with new faces and new voices.
sorry for the short chapter. i'm adjusting to a new work schedule but i've been itching to write. hopefully the rest of the chapters will be much longer. we haven't really gone that much in depth with the wolf part, sorry. soon, though, if you don't mind the wait. let me know how frequently you'd like me to update in the comments, and feel free to let me know what you've thought of the chapter and if you have any critique or criticism to add. i hope you enjoyed the chapter!
And the praise continues. Tony whimpers against his lips, both loving and hating the power Steve has over his body. How Steve can sound so much in awe of someone like him when he's built like a greek statue is beyond his mental capability, but Steve's words are backed up with feverant touches and heated glances. The fingers return to his asshole, smearing lube around the rim to make it easier on the both of them, and Tony feels the excitement growing as he lifts his hips, wrapping his legs tightly around Steve's torso to help him find his way in.
have it.
"Yes, honey?" Tony asks, and Steve clears his throat as he comes over to where Tony's sitting on the bed. Tony swings his legs over and readies himself to get up, but his eyes bug out when he watches Steve drop down onto his knee and digs a little box out of his pocket.
And Steve can see it, the little unsure nod that Tony's about to give them; but it all goes to shit when Wanda comes flying over the roof in a blaze of red light.
Steve clamps a hand down on his shoulder similarly to how the Captain had earlier to his armor, but his fingers are shaking as he tugs Tony back. When Tony turns around, the blond isn't even looking at him, just pointing at a chair.
since they met? Was it really that easy for Tony to lose Steve's trust in him?
And then there's Scott. Scott uses a disk to make himself bigger or smaller, but he's not very... let's just say he's better for distractions than actual hand-to-hand. Steve manages to hold back his wince when Scott gets flicked away. Wanda doesn't even have to look in his direction for that one, just waves a hand and that's taken care of.
"Sorry. Not into the murderous type." Tony says, his voice smooth even through the metallic voice mod.
Tony smiles; that same hollow smile that he had on earlier, and raises both hands to Steve's face. He cups the blond's face much like the blond had done for him, and Steve doesn't even take notice of the blood that's being smeared across his skin.
"No, this is necessary. Just give me a second." Tony says with a palm out, like he's begging for a second to breathe. No one moves, and the silence is so
"Sweetheart, what's wrong?" Steve asks, and he lifts a cautious hand to place it over Tony's.
"Lift your hips." Tony tells him, and there's a dangerous glint in Steve's eyes as he realizes what Tony is attempting.
Wait, there's another sound. And the sweet, sweet smell of coffee hitting his nostrils. He pauses for a second, knowing he should leave before he's noticed, but the smell of coffee makes his stomach growl louder than necessary.
And then he's cut off by Tony curling his fingers into the shirt across his chest and pulling him close. Their first kiss isn't really much of a kiss; more like a clanking of teeth and a brush of awkwardly placed lips. Tony kisses him for a good few seconds, and Steve's eyes are blown open as he watches with crossed eyebrows. He's stock still, his heart in his throat and his gut tightening because this was only something he's imagined on a whim.
." He says between grit teeth.
"Judging by the look on your face, I'd say you didn't know they were part of the army." Sam surmises, and his face darkens a little bit. Steve is about ten years older than Tony is, so while Tony knows about the blond's childhood and friendship with Bucky, his career for the military had never actually come up.
Steve notices instantly, of course. It might be a mate thing, but it's more likely because of the way Tony draws into himself and shifts out of his arms. Steve doesn't reach out again when Tony leaves his arms, just stares at him with his eyebrows furrowed at Tony's behavior.
"Our glorious Captain has picked the best mate to be his!" Thor says, cheerful and bright and Tony realizes he's missed that childlike wonder.
Steve is looking at him with so much love in his eyes that it almost physically hurts. There's understanding mixed in, and fear, and loneliness. Tony finds that he wouldn't mind getting lost in those eyes.
Like before with Steve, it seems like a silent agreement has been made, and everyone just nods. There are lips twitching in amusement, but they're all trying so hard to keep straight faces that Tony thinks he'll just let this one slide. Just this one, though, and just this one time. From there, brunch seems to wind down. Everyone gets absorbed into their private conversations, and once in a while, someone would start a conversation with another group; but for the most part, it was just another day for the pack.
But the words are swallowed up by Steve's mouth, hot and inviting and unrelenting. There's the slightest tremble of Steve's lips where they're pressing against Tony, but the blond is aware of what he wants and he'll take it
"It's over, honey." Tony says, his voice low and calm as he runs his hand through Steve's damp hair.
"Just like old times, am I right?" Tony chuckles, but there's no amusement in his tone and his jaw is set, "Come at me, both of you. Let's finish what we started in Siberia. And don't hold back because, this time, I won't."
fated to be, I know what your rejection would do to him. It's selfish and unfair of me to ask you this, but if you're not serious about him, please don't string him along any further?"
Tony whips around to glare at him; and it's so different from the flat, cool looks he's been giving the blond, "
"I don't mean to rush this along, Tony, but it looks like there's something you haven't gotten to yet," Bruce quips up from his seat on the floor, and his face is a little green from nausea.
