John brows knitted together, striving to make sense of Sherlock’s behavior, and then he remembered.
John’s body shook, his hands tightening into fists, and he felt a sense of bitterness and unease. He wanted to snap at Mr. and Mrs. Holmes, knowing it was wrong, knowing how disrespectful of an omega he would be to do so, didn’t stop John from taking a threatening step towards his in-laws. John opened his mouth to begin his heated tirade of insults, this over entitled family needed to be reprimanded, they needed to understand that although John was an omega, he was not weak—he never had the opportunity to start his rant though.
“He consults with The New Scotland Yard in solving cases.” Mr. Holmes elucidated.
"Your scent..."
This, Sherlock heard. Turning his head to the red Ford to his left, he deduced the stranger. Eyes red and dilated, shifting, face pale, lips dry - alcoholic, who would rather have liquor than hydrate himself with water. He was built and tall, his scent strong. He smelled of campfire and moss, beyond his powerful musk. An alpha. The knuckles of the one visible hand gripping the steering wheel was scarred, proving this man's violence.
"He loves you. He's protected you nearly his whole life. He deserves to be loved. You need to realize you have every right to love him, alpha or not. He isn't your enemy... He's always been your angel."
~~~~~~~~~~~
John gritted through clenched teeth his wants and needs, knowing Sherlock wanted to hear it, and as long as he didn’t have to physically describe it as Sherlock
“Actually, do you know what? Ignore me.”
“Funny doesn’t suit you. I’d stick to ice.”
John paled.
“I wish I could do something. Give you back what we’ve lost. I’d give you my blood and tears if it would make you right somehow.”
John scanned the room one last time before leaving and heading downstairs, interested in exploring the yard. It was much bigger than he originally thought, there were so many flowers, and some he had never even seen or knew existed. John went into the maze, but he didn’t go too far for fear of losing himself in it, but still, a part of him wanted to go in further to find out if he had what it took to reach the end.
"I said you don't understand, and instead of letting me explain myself, you leave, assuming false things in regards to my capacity for sentiment. You're an educated man, you shouldn't just walk out on me, knowing nothing of how I feel!" Sherlock was hollering with rage and all John could think was that Mrs. Hudson would be coming up if Sherlock didn't stop now.
“A suspect wasn’t happy to be found out, tried to kill me. Really, the same old, then I incapacitated him and called Scotland Yard.” Sherlock drawled dryly, glaring at John’s hands that lay care to his arm.
His human side and omega side both felt this was wrong, and when Sherlock guided John’s left hand to wrap around his neck, giving up what little power he had left and allowing John to do whatever he wished, John broke completely.
"It looks so different." John whispered to himself more than to Sherlock, but the omega heard, and a part of him grew worried.
“So, what is this about?” Lestrade was curious.
“My wife seems to be spending a very long time at the office.” Their first client of the day told them.
“John!”
John discarded his wishes and so Sherlock was brought to his lowest point, his most desperate of points. He needed to woo John quickly, have him see just how important he was and so Sherlock had thrown everything at him, but nothing worked.
Sherlock wasn’t the best person to work with, especially after he’d left him at the crime scene with no idea where he was. John found his way back eventually, and swallowed back his anger, because Sherlock was just being oblivious. The case went on and John found himself getting caught up in it, learning the way Sherlock worked, and becoming all the more fascinated with his mind.
"Victor." John gasped.
“I… don’t want to pressure you. If you don’t want to…
, do I want to hear your voice. I love your voice." John choked back on a sob, tears springing to his eyes, knowing he would hurt them both with his request, but he needed to ask it.
John wanted a great many things, but he couldn’t seem to ask for what it was he desired. John wanted so much to share a bed with his husband, but couldn’t bring himself to ask. He’d done so many things wrong that it felt wrong of him to ask now. What if he was being pushy and asking for more than Sherlock felt comfortable giving?
“Knock it off.” John whispered tensely.
Sherlock didn’t move after that. John remained still, listening with eyes wide open in the darkness. He could hear the alpha breathing soft measured breaths, but he knew he wasn’t asleep, just lying in the silence much like himself. Maybe… Maybe he changed his mind. Maybe he wanted to...to give John a test run.
Shutting his eyes, John enjoyed the closeness that he’d deprived himself of for so long. Sherlock never rejected the scenting he’d enacted, never left their bed, never sought out Irene’s attentions, he’d remained faithful to him. John had foolishly allowed his fears and Sherlock’s reclusions to determine his actions, when he should have been taking in the subtlety of Sherlock’s feelings.
"Sherlock..." John choked, his heart bursting over with grief and longing.
John exhaled erratically, enjoying the coolness of the towel and hummed a ‘thank you’ before Mrs. Hudson was off again. She returned soon with another wet towel and used it to wipe away the sweat layering his face and neck. Every once in a while she’d feel at his pulse, reassuring herself his heart rate wasn’t in the danger zone. She then retrieved a cold glass of water with a straw and helped John drink two glasses before seating herself near his side, and watching over him as he drifted off to sleep.
"Yes, well, whatever our child is, they'll have a science kit."
No matter that John was trying hard to earn Sherlock’s love and effectively unsettling Sherlock, or that Sherlock was driving John up a wall touching him affectionately while naked; John and Sherlock dropped their efforts in the face of more serious matters.
“You’re an alpha.” John protested, utterly astonished and baffled.
“This is Sherlock. Sherlock dear, this is your future bond mate, John Watson.” Mrs. Holmes introduced, smiling happily.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Oh, I wouldn’t say that.”
“So you’re a consulting detective. What’s it like?”
“I'm never bored.” John responded calmly.
Clothing was bothersome, but talking was even more so. Talking could come later, when his need for copulation wasn’t so dire. He’d spent the first day of his heat alone, suffering through a heavy fog brought on by his fever. True, with Sherlock’s presence his fever broke enough so that he could recognize and comprehend, but only enough so that his omega’s need to be bred could take over and bring about mating.
It hurt to know Sherlock took the cigarette. It hurt to know that someone Sherlock only just met meant something to him that it was a danger night and that he was mourning. Mourning meant Sherlock felt… John thought he was the only one. Now, Sherlock’s heart held a place for The Woman and that… That would slowly destroy John.
.” Sherlock drawled slowly, inelegantly, pale eyes lowering to stare down at his own steaming cup, and twisted away from John.
"I dream about tasting you. I've never... tasted myself and I never care to but, I want to taste you."
“Brother?”
Sherlock spent a good hour pacing the floor of his home, deliberating his options and circumstances. Mycroft wouldn't take his home away from him. The gentleman was responsible for his trust funds and when their parents someday passed on, he'd handle Sherlock's inheritance. Sherlock's past drug abuse was the reason he'd lost control of his funds. But now that he was bonded to the alpha, that responsibility would soon be handed over to John Watson.
“Pardon?”
"I'm dying." Sherlock declared, and was immediately answered by a soft snort of hilarity - apparently John could care less about his perils.
“Too much, John.” Sherlock was close. Having taken suppressants for so long made this heat all the more intolerable and his body highly sensitive.
“Hm? Oh, that. The missile plans.” Moriarty took the offered memory stick and kissed it.
John glanced over to the shut fridge and realized that Sherlock's stomach could no longer tolerate the human remains. The sight of which made Sherlock sick. Sighing softly, the alpha made his way over to Sherlock with caution. Raising his hands out before him, John met Sherlock's gaze before leaning forward and wrapped his arms around the nauseous omega.
John felt his lashes dampen and he nodded his head in understanding.
John pressed himself down hard, weighing his rear against the hardness under him. Unintentional, it might have been, but regardless of his intentions he'd touched Sherlock's sensitive cock and sent the omega trembling with need.
"No." Sherlock shook his head, horrified.
John’s belly was flat and hard now, but in several months it would be so round, and John’s face would be pudgy, and he’d smell heavily of Sherlock and kin, and
Sherlock stilled in a moment of silence.
Sherlock turned away from John, staring off at the yard, as well as telling John to get on with it. John paused when Sherlock’s head remained upright, not giving, unyielding, never submitting to him even when offering him his neck.
Sherlock was waiting for the rejection, the refusal to be his husband and alpha in name only, but instead… John agreed. This therefore made the man a complete and absolute nutter. There was no other explanation… Well there was, but Sherlock highly doubted John could feel so much attraction for him that he’d damn himself in a loveless marriage. Sherlock wouldn’t even bond with him, not physically, and no alpha would dare commit to an omega that would refuse them. Certainly, not an alpha submissive, they mated once.
John was dressed in one of his best suits, not because he wanted to be, but because they wouldn't let him pass through the door without it. Mary wore one of her finest dresses, and John knew she wanted this to mean more than just two friends eating a meal together.
“We’ll take it. You do deliver?”
"J-John, really now." Sherlock gruffly admonished, a quaking hand moving to hesitantly rest against silk blond hair.
"Shut up." John demanded, though there was no malice in his words. In fact John was smiling from ear to ear.
John’s brows furrowed, trying to understand what Sherlock was telling him, but he just couldn’t follow the alpha’s train of thought.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
“What?” John balked at the soft command Sherlock made and found his own face heating up.
." The need in the alpha's voice was clear.
He knew it all. All that Mycroft kept from the public, even when Sherlock's and John's popularity was rising. Because Mycroft knew it hurt to know the truth of his status and would be beaten and destroyed if the public ever wound up finding out.
“Sorry.” Sherlock apologized and pulled back. “This way.”
“What do you mean by that?”
Who was he to Sherlock? Sure, legally he was Sherlock’s husband and mate, but… Sherlock introduced him as a colleague. Did that mean all he was to Sherlock… all he could ever be was an obligation, an incubator to carry litter after litter, birthing more Holmeses into the world? Right… By tradition he was just an omega, married and mated, but nothing more than the means of ensuring his alpha’s line continued.
“Please, give me pleasure. I’m horny for you.”
Sherlock could see the urgency and didn't dally, waddling over to the side of the bed. John knew how insecure Sherlock felt about the way he'd waddle from time to time, but -
All John could feel as he swallowed Sherlock’s hot come and jacked him off with fervor was more and more of Sherlock’s skin cocoon him. Sherlock’s legs cradled the sides of his head. Sherlock’s stomach and chest pressed smoothly over John’s forehead and upper back. He could scarcely breathe and it was scary, and it was exciting, and it was heartwarmingly tender, because even in the pleasure that John was giving, Sherlock wanted to hold John desperately.
John couldn’t stop the smile from reaching his own lips.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Sherlock.” John complained, even though he’d resigned himself to let Sherlock have his way with this, five was just too many.
“He promised Sherlock he’d come back.”
“You pain in the ass.”
John knew Mrs. Holmes was trying to be supportive, but her words acted like a slap in the face. They were too blunt.
Sherlock's eyes snapped open, his skin was on fire, mind swirling with a dizzying amount of thoughts. The most important of them all was,
“John?” Sherlock spoke a voiceless question hovering with the utterance of his name, and breaking the silence between them as he slowly pulled John away enough to meet his gaze.
“You’re a good sister Harry, when you’re not drunk.” John mused quietly.
John pursed his lips unsatisfied with the alpha’s request.
John's thrusts came, leaving no space to gather himself, his mind was becoming a chaotic place. No longer bringing him sense of ease or clarity. It was senseless. He was losing everything, but this. The feelings John was giving him.
"I'm sorry for that." Sherlock's remorse was clearly present in his eyes. "But you were never in danger of dying, our link was... is frayed, but it can't snap without one of us dying. I knew it would be hard for you, but Mycroft assured me he'd watch over you. I even mended the bond as best I could. Didn't you feel me?"
“You’re magnificent Sherlock, so bloody beautiful.” John admired, hands roving over Sherlock’s legs.
Mycroft paused in contemplation of this notion. No doubt knowing it would be difficult for an alpha to think of living in two homes, when alpha's usually had one large home to house their whole family, including their seconds.
Two puppies caught Sherlock's attention. They both shared a large glass box with five other puppies. One dog had a red nose, was a multi-colored puff ball, sprinkled in gray, black and brown, with large chunks of white. Its eyes were a shocking blue. The other puppy was a honey brown dog, with a black saddle back and floppy long ears, black nose with a long snout, and sad dough-brown eyes.
“Obviously.”
"Sherlock?" John's hand rose then and palmed his cheek as if they were lovers and that wasn't what Sherlock thought them to be. No. Most assuredly not lovers.
Smacking his hand across John's rear, observing the flesh redden, Sherlock felt a satisfaction he could only attain when smoking. Strike after strike across the muscular flesh made it grow deeper in shade. Too soon for his liking, Sherlock stopped his punishment, as it would be drawing the line from BDSM to pure abuse, since that deep redness was turning violet with bruising. Instead, regrettably Sherlock was made to lay a soft touch to the enflamed and throbbing flesh. Soothingly stroking John's tender buttocks. Still, defiantly Sherlock retrieved a narrow paddle from the bag and would give a medium intensity slap across John's ass before re-stroking it with care to ease the flare each smack brought on after.
Even now, John could never explain what had happened. John wandered further from the estate, not understanding where these thoughts came from and strolled through the gardens, losing himself further in his contemplations.
John was going to come, pre-come generously seeping out, descending down his length while some splotched Sherlock’s flat stomach. John wanted to feel Sherlock’s touch there, he wanted Sherlock to bring him off, feel the roughness of his large hand encircle his stout cock.
"Jo-" Sherlock keened, unable to get much more than that out as the alpha leaned heavily against him, pressing him further into his seat and devouring his mouth entirely.
"I'm going to give you a massage. It should help."
“Yes.” Mycroft answered simply.
"Isn't that nice." Sherlock patronized and John flinched away from the coldness of his mate.
“I cleared it a
” John gasped when he felt it.
“I couldn’t take it if Sherlock… if Sherlock still wants his past love.”
The horse made a soft noise, its head turning to take him in all the more and it shifted closer. Taking this as a good sign, John ran his hand down the length of the horse’s side and chuckled softly when the horse twisted around and now his nose was pressing into John’s hand, sniffing raucously.
for this, you coward?” David says and points at Aldridge as two men hold him back just barely. “Who was the commanding officer that night, huh? Who really fucked up that night,
“What do you mean?” David frowns.
The house shakes again and then again when John slams the doors behind him.
“Why did you just respond like that, Sherlock?” David asks.
(See the end of the chapter for
Mary scoffs nervously, shaking her head. Mrs. Norbury’s hand goes to her purse, pulling out a set of photographs. She hands them over to Mary, who doesn’t move, suspicious and careful.
Around 3 am, sounds of footsteps wake John. He looks up, disoriented in a room that isn’t his. A dark silhouette of one very specific detective is what he finds by the door. Sherlock stands there, hesitant.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hmm.”
There, he said it.
“I’ve gone back and forth between Canada and somewhere in the Nordics,” Sherlock says, crossing his legs. “Perhaps born in one place and raised in another.”
“Every time.”
“You’re off the case,” Edwin says, eyeing Sherlock. “Both of you. You are to cut off all ties with the Corporal and cease any surveillance immediately.”
Finally finding what he’s been looking for, he stops the video the moment David, bags in his hands, opens the front door. Walking silently into the kitchen he finds Alison is loading dishes into the washer, giving him the coldest of shoulders.
“Migraine,” Sherlock says. He’s slouched over the sink in the dark flat, swallowing two pills down with a glass of water. He’d ignored John as he stalked in through the kitchen door; the stairs in Baker Street have always been a dead giveaway of visitors, welcomed or otherwise.
“My husband is a jeweler. He took one look at that necklace and said we couldn’t just throw it out like the rest. It’s old and… it’s probably not worth much,” she shrugs. “The stones aren't real, either; they're colored rhinestones. But it was a custom order, by the looks of it ; someone put thought into it."
He looks at the CCTV photograph again, at the tall building and the blurry image of a man standing at the balcony.
“What else is there for me, John?” Sherlock says bitterly, coolly.
“Yeah?”
David stands, swaying and unstable, and heads towards the head of the table. He looks like he’s ready to leave.
His word cause Sherlock to close his eyes and clear his throat.
“Yes, very successful.” David nods, offering a plastic cup full of cheap, red wine. “But I’m just me now. And it’s just you and me here, so… relax. I promise I won’t bite.”
But Mary’s gone now. She’s been gone for a while. By all rights, he’d been given an out of the life he resented her for. He doesn’t have to live here, he remembers, and his mind buzzes with the realization. So why does he? It’s just him and Rosie now, partners in crime. They gravitate toward Sherlock like moths to a flame, but Sherlock's flame is much dimmer these days.

“Thank you, Mr. Holmes.” Jenkins says and turns to David. “Now, tell us about—”
“But you do… want us. Rosie and me. Now that it’s all said and done.”
The clinic is housed in a renovated one-storey building in Surrey. The design is modern and sleek, with plenty of glass and steel. It’s impressive, if somewhat cool and distant. Ella’s clinic is much more welcoming than this one.
-FIC RECS!-
“This isn’t about you, John.” Sherlock says, but there’s no malice in his voice.
“Not sure,” Lestrade shrugs. “Looks like… a guitar case, maybe?”
“What are you on about?”
, honest smile.
“Don’t be so hard on yourself. There’s no one to impress there, just us and your mates. Write what you feel, what you would have liked him to know, maybe. Or some memories. Memories are always good.”
“Mice,” Edwin says.
They arrive at Baker Street more than an hour later, Sherlock’s body humming with impatience. John looks up at the second floor window instinctively, finding the flat dark and vacant. Which makes sense, of course, since its tenant is grunting his way out of the car presently, but it seems to be a very fitting metaphor for their current condition.
“You were… emotionally compromised.”
“I came back, John. didn’t I?”
When he realizes what he’s looking at, his jaw drops.
“Operational information,” Mycroft clarifies. “I’m afraid I’m not at liberty to say more.”
“No.. sorry.” He shakes his head, his hand never leaving the small of Sherlock's back. “I was upset but I think I’m better now. So what else did Dr. Williams say?”
Their cruel reality has always been that John loves Sherlock so intensely, needs him so much - that on the rare occasion Sherlock did bare his heart John had never been able to stand it. He’d shut off, deflect in fear of being unable to handle it.
Sherlock frowns.
He’s deep in conversation with two other dads while cleaning Rosie’s hands of the mess she's been making. She pokes him on his thigh once, twice. “Daddy,” she says, but John is mid-sentence so he continues.
a drama queen. “Detective Inspector—”
"Jane from the surgery emailed you. Says she's worried," Sherlock says, and John exhales loudly. Jane likes to stick her nose where it doesn't belong. "Asks how Rosie's feeling, seeing as today's the third day off you've taken this week to take care of her."
“He made the rounds at first. Maiwand, Gershek, Nazwad. No notes of anything extraordinary happening in any of these locations.” Sherlock tilts his head. “Well, no more than usual. Then they were sent to Musa Qala, where they were placed under siege by the Taliban for fifty-five days.”
There are two rooms available besides Mrs. Holmes’: one is occupied by Mycroft and one is apparently destined for John, Rosie, and Sherlock.
“This is nice.” John says.
“Yes, yours,” Mycroft says, but is interrupted by Sherlock clearing his throat. “Sherlock wasn’t entirely sure about getting you involved in this, but I think your army experience can prove quite valuable.”
“Good night, John.” Sherlock says and turns to put his coat on.
After a while, John can’t hold it in, can’t help himself anymore.
Sherlock’s entire body shrinks in frustrated discontent. John squeezes his knee yet again and he searches for Sherlock’s eyes.
The woman peeks her head through the door (
“Hey.” He turns around to look at her, distracted. “Oi, what’s all this?”
might. Or worse still, if Sherlock ends up hurt or dying fighting to save a wife John has been cheating on... John would never be able to live with that knowledge. Literally.
Your comments are all I need 😊
“Trust is a very rare commodity in my circles, Sherlock.” Mycroft says. “But if you ask whether I think you were sent there on purpose then I'd say no, I don’t believe so.”
, John thinks.
Edwin turns back, his brows furrowed with surprise at their response.
” and “
“Didn't seem..” John clears his throat and stops, unsure how to proceed.
“Why won’t you tell me about your scars?”
John’s brows furrow.
“Of course it’s bloody terrifying.” John swallows, searching for the right words. “I’m expected to raise this little girl and… and make sure she’s happy and healthy and…” He trails off. “I mean, I’m quite confident about keeping her healthy, that I can do. Doctor.” He concedes. “But
“Yes.” Sherlock nods, the warmth from John’s hand traveling up his arm and dispersing, warming his wounded sternum.
“Anything in particular you’re looking for?” Edwin asks.
“I don’t know anything about that–” the reporter calls back.
“It’s not your place to teach me right and wrong, John. To... belittle me at every turn.”
Khoury’s face contorts in shock, his breath racing with fear.
“By what?”
“Does that surprise you?”
John is stumped by the sentiment and the fact that he has no idea how to respond to that. He turns to look at Sherlock, trying to read his facial expression.
“And it was fine this time, John,” Sherlock says. “It wasn’t like last time—”
Mycroft insists that most people recovering from a near-fatal injury would pay good money for a live-in doctor, but this is the wrong kind of version of that specific doctor. Betrayed, wounded, heartbroken John Watson is a simmering pressure pot. Agitated and bored, it’s been a daily battle for both of them to keep the apartment standing in the face of Sherlock’s own turbulent moods once he was able to leave his bed.
“Was he?” Lady Smallwood moves closer and looks at the notepad Khoury was given the previous day, the crayon sitting next to it.
“They showed me photos of him dead,” David says.
“I’m sure you remember I don’t use mass produced razor blades for shaving myself,” Sherlock says, pointing at what John only now notices is a pair of irritated, red cheeks. “My skin is too sensitive for store-bought blades of the kind Nadi used to cut himself.”
“Yeah.” John’s voice is flat and robotic. He’s shocked and dizzy from the news as his blood moves far too quickly from one area to another. “Yeah, got it. Thanks.”
are you.” John snipes unkindly as he leaves the room.
, to what end—that, Mary never asked.
“So?” she starts cheerily enough, “how was your weekend?”
“How so?”
“How...” John says. “How exactly am I supposed to take any of this with a grain of salt?”
“No. Christ, Sherlock—”
“That’s not all he said. That sentence didn’t end there.”
“Speaking.”
“What is it with you and stranglers—”
“So he’s—”
Forgot to add: no offense to social workers over Alison's words - they're the true heroes!
Sherlock nods. “It was… good.”
blog." Sherlock snipped.
“Or else,
“He seems alright to me. Maybe he just doesn’t want to see you or somethin’, on account of waving a gun in his flat and whatnot.”
“Something’s come up,” Sherlock offers. “Could be nothing. Most likely nothing.”
His journey to the Yard during rush hour turns out to be a fool's errand, one he regrets instantly. The 18-minute ride becomes a tortuous three-quarters of an hour—ample time to wallow in self-pity. As soon as the cab approaches the kerb Sherlock leaps out, gasping for air and a bit of much-needed privacy. It's enough to have one doctor physically prodding him on a good day, let alone another attempting to do the same with his emotions.
“My nose?” Sherlock raises an eyebrow and John nods, laughing still. “I suppose every piece of data counts, Watson.”
John smiles and squeezes an apology in. “I have difficulties expressing my feelings. It’s just... Hard.”
Jonathan Palmer’s memorial service is due to end in about 45 minutes. He needs to get to the pub before the group gets there, as Sherlock instructed him. Friday traffic is about to make that nearly impossible.
“As a couple?” David asks and John closes his eyes as anxiety takes over him.
It was hard to miss the prominent graffiti piece at the entrance to the camp—‘
“Why would I do that?”
He spends nearly every waking moment weighing his options.
“Can you believe this guy?” Rory shakes his head in delight, pointing at Sherlock as he crawls back under the sink.
“So, a book deal would bring us all the money we could possibly need,” he says.
Sherlock is currently in his Case Solved mode. He’s speaking quickly and detailing how he unlocked the mysteries of the vanishing limbs.
“I’m afraid I’m a bit under the weather today, Mrs. Hudson, Mr. Holmes,” Rory says from the kitchen, wiping his dirty hands on a used flannel. John steals a furtive glance from his chair by the window as he types up their most recent case; an unsolved one, about a guardsman that nearly died in John’s hands. “Would you be very upset if I came back some other day to finish the sealing on the windows?”
He encourages Rosie to turn in Sherlock’s general direction, his smile growing larger and larger with pride when she takes a brave, big step, and then another.
you—” Wide-eyed, Sherlock starts his scathing accusation when the door to the bolthole is flung open. The three of them jump in surprise at the interruption, but no one is more surprised than Mycroft.
He puts on a fake smile when he walks into the sitting room, looking around. Sherlock is usually a minimalist when it comes to packing, sticking to the bare essentials. Today the room is full of hiking equipment. Navigation devices, a thick coat, a compact tent.
“Ah,” John says, putting his hands in his pockets. “Then I guess we’re in the same boat.”
"Sherlock-" John started. "Of course I apologize. Of course, I assume you know. That you understand."
“Ezekiel, Sherlock? Really?”
David clears his throat, offering an apologetic smile. “I’ve had worse.”
John scans the room again, remembering waltzes and Rorys. He bites his lips. “So.”
“Oh.”
She nods and leaves her station, knocking softly on one of the doors before she enters. When she steps back out a man is following behind her, distracted by a pile of papers.
“What's that supposed to mean?” David asks. “You don't even care? Because I do.”
John leaves the house and heads towards the general direction of the Parashars’ home. He’s happy for the fresh air. The unexpectedly honest conversation with Mrs. Holmes left him thoughtful and bothered. There is so much to unpack in everything she’d just told him.
“Good. Text me the name of the charity you’d like me to donate to.”  James tells Sherlock.  “I’ll make sure it's done before Christmas Day.”
Sherlock clears his throat. "How about tea?"
“Do you need me to say it again until you’re sure? Because I will.”
?” he calls over his shoulder, satisfied when he sees a small flinch on her impeccably inscrutable face.
“Thank you.” Sherlock whispers. “For being here. I’m not as outnumbered as I usually am.”
"We'll bring her back, John. The GPS tracker is tremendously accurate and I know where she is at any given moment," he says, staring at the telly, unseeing. "No need to single-handedly bankroll every liquor establishment within London proper.”
“Besides,” Rory smiles, a charming, disarming,
“I— I’m not much for considering relocation before my morning tea.”
“If you leave now, Sherlock...” John’s voice is harsh, tinged with pain. “If you leave... I’m never coming back again.”
“But then I heard about your father and it didn’t make sense to go.”
The receptionist, Moira, greets him with an honest smile as he enters the practice. The freckled, mousy-haired woman’s brows dip when she realizes he's alone, sans-John (cat-ladies always favor John—must be those jumpers).
A personal note from yours truly: Spring of 2021 was one kick in the nuts  after another in real life and frankly, I'm exhausted and also going through a bit of a writers' burnout (I think, I never had one before). I'll be slowing down a bit my with my current WIPs - this one, as well as

“We need to speak to Gabriel Walker please.” Lestrade shows his badge.
He takes a scalding sip of his tea as he skims through the remainder of the entry. Divorced, no children. Has a Masters degree in Politics and International Relations from UCL; an outspoken advocate of comprehensive, cutting-edge reforms in police leadership and practices.
“Is there anything else you’d like to tell us?” Lestrade asks.
“Did you know Jamie well?”
“John.” Sherlock says and burrows further into their embrace.
David blinks for a beat, taking the information in. “Well then, people are idiots.”
“It’s alright, love,” he whispers in Rosie’s ear. It doesn’t work, though. Of course it doesn’t. Babies are stress barometers, and they don’t lie. The mood at the house is strained, and she has been picking up on it.
“Blimey,” Rory says, quickly shaking off his own general malaise, evidently still in the prime of
“Why do you have two phones?”
indeed ancient, John realizes. The photos are those of store visitors throughout the years, probably local village people taken by an amateur yet friendly photographer. John’s heart stops when he finds what he was hoping to find, up on the right end side of the wall.
Mycroft raises a brow.
“What do you mean?”
“Oh, God,” Mary whispers. She rifles through the pictures, realizing there are other photos, too. Not only Ajay’s, but scans of documents, proof of her old identities and whereabouts. “Where did you get these?”
, he doesn’t say.
“John-” Sherlock says in protest.
“Sorry?”
Sherlock brings the can to his mouth then he shakes his head and furrows his brows. “I.. can’t remember.”
“Major Sholto," the woman says. "If you don’t mind, I have a long ride back to London.”
If she’d noticed the pain in his eyes following the events of the other night in High Wycombe, she hasn’t acknowledged it. Not a raised eyebrow, not a knowing, judgemental sigh.
he thinks.
“Just… ” John scrubs his hand over his face, barely above a whisper. He looks straight ahead, unable to stand the sight of Sherlock right now. “How could you say that, Sherlock?”
John is now, officially, half-crying and half-laughing. “Of course he kissed you, Sherlock. Of course he did. How could anyone not? You’re Sherlock-Fucking-Holmes.”
“Because. What’s the point? My husband left me. My reputation is tarnished, whatever’s left of it. You probably think I’m guilty anyway. In all honesty, detective, I haven’t been myself recently. I just don’t… know.”
“What?” Sherlock frowns, shaking his head in confusion. Everything around John sounds drowned out, as though he has gone underwater and all he can think of is Sherlock’s breath mingling with his. And then he kisses him -
Hamish Alistaire Watson, the son of a Liverpudlian Naval Officer, stood taller than most men at the time—unlike his only son. Based on a flurry of details he’d had the chance to quickly read through, he assigns John’s shorter stature to a combination of a premature birth and a sickly first few years, dotted with bouts of childhood asthma. A combination Sherlock would
“Any prints? CCTV footage?”
John huffs. “Can’t forget her."
“I guess my point is…” John considers the words. “I can’t judge her. And I think now, after your father’s death… I think she’d like a second chance. Or at least the opportunity to try and win a second chance from you. A fresh start, you know.”
“So it’s my fault?” Sherlock whispers.
“No, of course.” John says quickly, relieved. “Yeah, we’d like to be there. Thank you for the invitation.”
John smiles before he speaks. “You’ve gone grey.”
“Oh—”
"So?"
Sherlock thought.
“Yes.”
John sighs. “Yes.”
Sherlock closes his eyes.
“I won’t,” he says finally, admitting defeat. “But I need you to promise me something.”
Sherlock, John, and Rosie established what one might call a careful routine. Dinners at Baker Street, eclectic weekends, long days at the surgery and the Yard. John’s heart skips a beat whenever he sees the other two together, their chemistry. There was a learning curve - mostly for Sherlock - but now they’re at ease together, seeking the other out in a room and exchanging adoring glances.
“Alright, so... what are you thinking?” John asks.
“Mary,” Sherlock says quietly, surprised.
“Ian. Ian Calpin,” John says, conjuring up the name Sherlock had assigned him. He’s not John Watson on this case, after all. He can’t be.
, Sherlock thinks, handing the man a handwritten note he’d scribbled in advance.
“I just wanted…” John sighs. “I just want a fresh start, you know?”
Sherlock blinks as David slams the door to the car, sending him one last threatening glare as he pulls away. “You stay away from me, do you hear me?”
“Having his headshots taken by a professional photographer, as we speak. Accompanied by Ms. Thøgersen, of course, who seems to have been upgraded to full time publicist and spokesperson,” Edwin says. “A man in my employ is there with them, under the guise of an assistant photographer.”
“I’m so sorry, John.”
How different the haunted house he once shared with Mary now seems. It's like seeing your childhood school and realizing it’s not as big, not as intimidating as you once thought it.
"We were an interested party," Saul explains. John can only imagine every bloody government in the world must have been, eager for the downfall of the man who held so dearly to their deepest secrets. “And it was done and over with as soon as he pulled that trigger.”
Despite John’s guilt, Sherlock knows him well enough to know that he needs the rush of adrenaline just as much as he does. He noticed John’s jaw tighten, suppressing excitement as he listened to Lestrade go on and on about the case details. His body tensing, soldier John was clearly aching for some misadventure; Doctor John was hesitant -  scanning and deducing Sherlock’s physical condition to determine whether there was any point in even considering leaving the house.
“Thank you,” he says, exchanging another uncomfortable look with Elin. She shows him the way, leading him in the direction of the photographer.
“We’re… not going to need it,” John says with a hesitant half-smile, shrugging into his jacket. “You could write a new one while I’m gone.”
“The first few shots are just for testing purposes,” the photographer says, nodding at his assistant. “Just checking the lighting—we won’t actually use them, so just be yourself.”
“Lay off it, sir.” A response comes from one of the men. “It’s been hard enough on him as it is.”
John knows he’s gone red, flushed from neck to cheeks. “It was Mary’s choice. She’s never been.”
“Christmas.”
John is floored when Sherlock burrows his head in his neck yet again, just like last night. Whether it’s in defiant expectation of his mother’s reaction or a childish attempt to disappear, John isn’t sure. Either way, it doesn’t matter. He squeezes Sherlock’s knee again in encouragement.
“I’m not like that.” James said coldly and nailed John to the ground with a long, warning stare before walking away. And that was that. It was never discussed again.
“Apparently, there’s the two of them running the group,” Lottie starts. “Maureen and Jackie, both retired by now.”
Sherlock tears the edges of the envelope, pulling out a thin bundle of stapled papers. He looks up at John with puzzled eyes after a quick scan of thefirst paragraph. “What’s—”
“Two?” John frowns. “The news only mentioned one.”
"Your life?!" John cried. "What about my life? I'm just as involved in this as you are. I get a say in this!" He moved closer to Sherlock, pointing a finger at him. "'Your life', ha! The life you've been so carelessly throwing away this past year, over and over again. Like it means nothing! It's like you want nothing more than to die, and I can't take it anymore, Sherlock, I can't!"
I know, I know. What kind of terrible person ends a story LIKE THAT? I apologize. My hope is that the fluffier parts of this story will leave you hopeful about this dou's future.
Lestrade looks at him as if he’s lost his mind.
Rachel Clarke (née Palmer) is nothing short of stunningly, horribly plain. Not John-plain; of course not, no one is so beautifully boring and plain as John is. She’s the exact opposite of one of a kind; so much so that he gets bored just following her around the stuffy indie bookshop/café travesty where she’d chosen to earn her keep. (
“How’s that tea coming, John?” He turns around swiftly, finding John staring unseeing at the kettle.
“Is this something you’ve been thinking about? Plan B?” John asks.
He winces with pain as the smoke from another cigarette burns his lips, watching the owner of the chippy from a vantage point that keeps him hidden in plain sight. Lucky, that. Ian stands, speaking amiably to a patron. One of the regulars, it would seem. Sherlock used to be a regular. Sometimes, after a particularly difficult case in the days before a wounded doctor stepped into Barts, or when the call of a seven percent solution would become too strong, he’d walk into the chippy with an enigmatic smile.
Sherlock looks away wordlessly.
“I’m going in dress,” he reminds her. “I’m all sorted.”
Aldridge sits two rows ahead of John, mumbling in agreement. So far, in the afternoon he’s spent following the man around, there has been a short, furtive visit by bus to Marlow, to Aldridge’sex-wife’s house where she lives with their children and her new husband, a visit to the chemist’s andanother short visit to a local AA meeting (after which Aldridge had downed two cans of beer). Now, here they are in the Veterans for Peace meeting.
Finally, a real smile.
“English?” she asks brusquely and they nod, shivering with fear. “You've got the money?”
. Sherlock wants to tell them.
“You were always the brave one, John. I rather hoped you’d be the one to take the first step when you were ready.”
“Sherlock—”
“Well, here I am. The real thing,” he says, taking a step closer. “Teach me.”
It’s a yellowing, shriveled copy of
“What?”
John thinks. He considers the multitudes of questions he has, the answers he needs, but best not to frighten the man now that he’s actually cooperating.
“Stand what?”
John huffs, shaking his head.
Sherlock nods reluctantly.
Thank for your patience! Here's a long-ish chapter in return :) April was a really terrible month for me in real life, but I'm finally back to the land of the living. I really appreciate the fact that you keep coming back to this story and I hope to go back to a more productive posting cadence.
“Peter.”
“He saved that man’s life,” John snipes.
Mr. Ambiguous.
“Alex, move away from him. I’ll explain everything.” Gabriel says.
“Do you know where?” Sherlock asks, but he knows the answer to that. David shakes his head ruefully, his eyes closing with pain.
Lestrade is, understandably, fuming. “Sherlock!”
Suddenly Sherlock's long and convoluted biography comes to John’s mind; all the things William faced as his father. Seeing Sherlock turn from a gentle, thriving child to a traumatized, hurting boy after Eurus and Victor. Teenage years couldn’t have been simple with Sherlock, he thinks. Then the drugs, rehab, life on the street. All that before John had even met him. Then his fall, knowing Sherlock’s somewhere on the run. Mary’s bullet, his drug relapse. Even the simple knowledge that Sherlock chases criminals every day should be terrifying enough for a parent in their right mind.
“Hi. Yeah. I’m so sorry, I won’t be able to make it.” He says, speaking loudly due background noises on James’ side of the call. It sounds like James is already in a restaurant, or maybe a pub. “Something came up.  A… family emergency, I’m afraid.”
“As I told you a few weeks ago at your surgery, John, Sherlock had a vital part in Corporal Stewart’s rescue, retrieval, and eventual homecoming,” Mycroft says. “Something I hadn’t told you when I met you was that after the rescue operation, Sherlock spent two months in solitary with the Corporal in a Gaza safehouse. It took us a long time to work out the details of a safe retrieval operation of the two of them.”
“Oh, that’s lovely.” She pats his hand lovingly.
“I think I need a bit more time.”
“The silence.”
“Indeed he is,” Mycroft smiles sourly, exchanging a worried look with Sherlock. “When is this joyous event supposed to take place?”
“Hmmm.” Sherlock smiles, realizing he’s onto something. “What did he have on you? Let’s see. Your oldest son. Died smuggling drugs into Syria. No. That’s not it.” Sherlock takes a deep breath. “You have a second family in Egypt, a wife you haven’t seen in years, and that’s why you tried to leave for Egypt—you have a small house somewhere near the border.”
“Right, of course, love. Dogs. Let’s go.”
He scowls, her words rousing him from forty-five minutes worth of staring at nothing out the window. “You wanted me to babyproof.”
“He provided yet another version of
He frowns when he remembers that only a few hours ago he was preoccupied with Sherlock's father's condition. Trauma bruises the mind, sometimes to a point of no return - William Holmes is another example of that. Who knows what James has been going through, what brought a man who swore to lonely seclusion to visit London and meet up with another man in a sleazy hotel.
Sherlock grabbed hold of the open door, signaling John to leave.
John is empty inside.
” John says, horrified. “I’m not suffering over some asshole cat just because Mary thought political assassination was a legitimate career path.”
“How do you explain that?”
“How?” John surveys the pages, confused.
“He said no one can see me. Said the back door should be easy to open.”
” John asks. “So that was a lie. He actually did tell you.”
“I wanted to come home, too.” David sniffs and looks around the room again, his form stiff. He stands and walks towards the photos hanging on the wall. “That’s all I could think about all these years. I used to hear your voice, you know.”
“Yes. Eight months old.” He smiles.
“Understood.”
He’d ignore Harry, mostly. Look back from under his lashes when the mood would strike him, chatting him up one time just for practice. There was nothing particularly interesting about him; he’d spared everyone’s well-being when he avoided mentioning the man’s inclination towards Japanese mermen sex dolls. He’d learned long ago that was the sort of information one should treasure for a special occasion.
“It was… nice,” John says, looking away. He clears his throat again when Sherlock doesn’t speak further. “My turn again, yeah?”
“I can see it, I always could. But all you’d ever let me do is just… watch. Watch you fall apart again and again. It’s like watching a car accident in a horrible loop, not being able to stop it from happening. Do you have any idea how terrible that feels?”
John knows what loneliness feels like. He knows what made his go away.
" John stops him, indignant, finally letting out the words he's been holding back for weeks. "She's left for her grand tour, free to be her old self again. She had passports, flight tickets, she was ready to leave on a moment’s notice. She doesn't
Sherlock shakes his head, defeated.
Gemma Dale is a 5’2’’ ball of energy. A soft-spoken ex-combat medic with red hair and intelligent gray eyes, she’s trained in Krav Maga and can pin men twice her size to the wall when needed. Mary has seen her do it during one of the more interesting days at the clinic and was not unimpressed.
“Ask and you shall receive, little brother,” Mycroft says, not unkindly, as he opens the door.
, John thinks,
“Or what?”
He’s sitting at the back of a common room in a hostel, wireless headphones in his ears. His hair is flat and disheveled and he’s wearing a thick white v-neck t-shirt. His cheeks are slightly pink, either from a warm shower or due to his body adjusting to the higher elevation levels. Probably both.
“I’m taking the job, and I’ll go wherever I damn well want to,” Mary says as she storms out of the kitchen. “You can choose to go on ignoring the truth for as long as you want, John, but don’t come crying to me when he breaks your heart again.”
John frowns again and looks at Sherlock, trying to read his expression. His face is unreadable.
“There was Moriarty, back then.” Sherlock explains. “He was always there in the background. I could sense it, I could sense that something was coming.”
John finally has the time and presence of mind to see Sherlock clearly; he’s disheveled, his eyes bloodshot from dehydration. It looks like he hasn’t shaved in days, and - he notices in surprise - he’s wearing his Belstaff.
Later that day John picks Rosie up from the nursery.
“Why’s that?”
“He was beaten to death, Rachel,” David blurts out quickly. “Right in front of my eyes. I held him in my arms as he was taking his last breaths.”
His heart goes out to Sherlock.
John is about to speak when they’re interrupted. Gabriel’s assistant is jogging towards them, looking hesitantly over her shoulder.
Sherlock shakes his head furiously, “No, not you, of course not. Our… codependency, I suppose. Not you as a… concept. Or as a friend. I think he means examining your prominence in my life.”
“Feel free to speak to each other even if I’m the one who asked a question. When you do, speak as naturally and normally as possible for the two of you. I need to get a good sense of your interactions.”
“Thank you, Mrs. Sutton,” the lawyer says, getting up. “We’ll stop here.”
“You suppose?”
“So Amit was your... boyfriend?”
John went willingly, happy for a change of scenery for Rosie (
is the key.” Sherlock points a confident finger at the empty spot. “The key to the truth about David’s time away. Whatever happened between 2013 and 2015 was significant enough to convince Sulman Abu Nazir to leave the relative safety of Afghanistan, POW included, and leave for Gaza—of all places.”
John is looking for his gun.
"Correct me if I’m wrong, Mr. Felig,” John says nervously, looking at his hands. “But you strike me as a man who rarely finds himself without… leverage."
“Yes. Your cryptographer friend was unable to help, no matter how much I threatened him.” Mycroft twists his nose in disapproval. “Quite a disappointment, considering the amount of time I had to spend in that place. His flat smelled of vinegar, it was most displeasing.”
“‘Hullo,” John says softly as walks through the threshold.
“I see. Is that the only reason why?”
He can’t blame her.
"What?" John turned to look at Sherlock behind him.
“Well, I suppose—”
“At this point, I recommend that you make arrangements for transferring William to a hospice. I can recommend a few - very good ones. Mr. Holmes,” She says and turns to look at Mycroft. ”You mentioned you prefer that he stays in hospital but I’m here to represent William’s interests. A hospice is a more soothing environment, both for patients and their families. The medical staff there are just as well trained as a hospital’s staff. So I’d urge you to reconsider.”
“Yes, I did. I was worried she'd slip under the radar. That she’ll show up in London, take Rosie away,” Sherlock says.
Sighing at the sight of a clearly empty street and no sign of Sherlock, he sits in his own chair, taking a big breath as he pulls his phone out. He calls Sherlock once again. The line is unreachable, just like it had been over the last few weeks. He settles back in the chair, preparing for an evening of
Be brave in the face of David's cross examination here - it's important to understand Sherlock's suspicions. The angst and drama continue immediately afterwards :)
Not one to lose face, Sherlock looks back with matched determination.
A thoroughly unperturbed John has driven away from the main road and down a smaller, bumpy lane heading towards the head of a great cliff. There are no visitors during this season. It’s a cold weekday afternoon with only crying seagulls gliding about.
“And finally, autopsy reports and CCTV of Captain Aldridge’s final hours,” Sherlock says, stuffing his hands in his pockets. “The man was drunk to the gills and had more coke in him than I ever did on my worst day. It was a cold night and he couldn’t seem to find his way to his bedsit. The footage shows him climbing into a trash bin. Rough sleepers do that sometimes, when they’re disoriented and desperate for a warm place to lay their heads. As he jumped into the bin, he slipped and hit his head on his way down. In his state of unconsciousness, he deteriorated over night and never woke up. The trash bin was picked up by city workers roughly 36 hours later, and that’s how his body ended up in the landfill.”
His eyes are fixed on a heavy, expensive pen, which he spins and turns in solemn consideration. “It’s
Talk about fucking leverage.
One has to be an incredibly good liar in order to disappear right in front of the world’s only consulting detective. Now, having read David’s army files, ones he wasn’t privy to before, some details finally fall into place.
“Oh,” he says unhelpfully again, his eyes fixating on the counter. “Well, that’s a fair question.”
“I’m not saying that’s the case here. I think it’s too soon to tell. But it’s something that crosses the minds of very few people and often explains difficulties in relationships and friendships that otherwise make every sense in the world.”
“We should interview him,” John says, sitting in what Sherlock now considers, with a twitch to his stomach, to be John’s chair. “Is David home yet?”
Sherlock swallows at the accusation.
Nodding slowly again, neither of them moves.
“A shave would do you good, brother,” Mycroft calls out in a condescending voice to the semi-open door. “Wouldn’t hurt to look presentable.”
“What about Irene? You fucked her, didn’t you?”
Currently, the women’s options are relatively limited: either hide inside a lorry crossing the channel, or huddle into a small boat to attempt to cross it in the treacherous December waters. With any luck, they’ll get through border control using the fake passports. It’s a brave endeavour these days, but it’s been known to work.
“And you know what? He’s right.” David continues, uninterrupted, as if John isn’t really there. “I’m not a hero. There’s nothing heroic about being captured. I used to lie in my cell every night, embarrassed. I bloody blew it. I let them take me, I didn’t fight hard enough. Something happened, something happened that made it possible for them to take me and not the others.”
Mycroft eases back in his chair, loosening his tie.
John has no time to check in with Sherlock or visit Baker Street once he's back from Austria.
Sherlock perks a brow, curious.
are the reason you are where you are right now.” Mycroft’s back straightens in anger. “You requested, and I agreed, to take on an unofficial post. That means you’ve also agreed to take orders and thereby obey them.”
I always found it strange that Moftiss had Mary call herself a secretary in T6T. She's a nurse, not a secretary, but I went along with it here for the sake of the story.
“Of course I did.” Sherlock smiles.
“Oh?”
“I sent one of our own to his launderette, hoping to get more information out of him. He was shot in the head, point-blank. His face was so disfigured they had to call in one of his mistresses to identify him by his scars,” Mycroft continues. “Apparently he’s been dead for quite a while when they found him.”
“I…” John starts, his heart dropping. “Yeah. You haven’t seen him?“
“Don’t fall for that, Lestrade.” Sherlock says. “I’m sure Gabriel is on his way to London already.”
“Probably more than all of us put together.” Sherlock responds quietly. He thinks for a long minute, his face crumpling.
Mycroft endlessly pesters him about Magnussen, and he only partially manages to ignore him. The Magnussen files lie orphaned, carelessly scattered around his room and standing out like a sore thumb. Good intentions ferment and sour like spoiled wine as a petty voice inside his head whispers things—horrible things he would like to hurl at John's face, at Mary's.
“I know about you two,” David says sourly. “You think I’m a bloody idiot?”
He’s missed this so, so much.
“Move the pillows,” John grunts. “And something for the pain.”
“She’s healthy, I gather. Functioning,” Mycroft continues, “and a bad sleeper, judging by the bags under her father’s eyes." The long, pregnant silence that fills the room leaves Mycroft with no choice but to forge on. “I don’t visit them, only receive occasional reports, of course.”
more observant than all of us. He always has been. The three of us pride ourselves in being all-seeing, smarter. We notice strands of hair on a suit, the patterns of dust. Not the important things, like he does. None of us noticed him fading away. What good are observational skills if you can’t observe
“Shut your bloody mouth,” John says, cupping Sherlock’s shoulder blade with his right hand, reaching for Sherlock’s hand with the other. “And dance.”
The dark spell of the initial confession breaks, and David turns to look between Sherlock and John.
John frowns and huffs, leaving the room shaking his head. “Gits.”
Not moving to leave the sofa
“Yes, I do, that’s why I keep you.” Mycroft sits on the edge of the bed. “Unfortunately that leaves us with very little to base an accusation on.”
“John!”
He was addicted to Sherlock. To his promise of exotic danger, to the rule breaking. To kicking at anything considered proper and acceptable in favor of chaos and uncertainty.
There’s a long, stretching moment before David speaks. “It’s a disaster.”
was the stand-in.”
If not today, he would’ve left some other time. He needed to go.
“Were you aware that your brother felt so strongly, Sherlock?” David asks and nods his head.
“What can I get you, sir?” The bartender asks.
“Oh, right.”
He’s sitting in a pub with Lestrade. Granted, that doesn’t widen any circles per se, but that’s the best he can muster right now. They meet up and discuss Christmas, Brexit, and Rosie. And Sherlock, of course. John thought he’d like to avoid that but Lestrade brings it up.
“Come on in, then.” She pulls him into her kitchen. “Have some tea, maybe he’ll be here soon. I can go to the shops later.”
Saul only hums in response, frowning.
Sherlock takes a big breath. “Listen, we can’t be seen here much longer. I just thought—”
He tells a story about a silly dog named Toby, a blue-eyed soldier named John. She doesn’t care.
“Sit down, please,” Edwin says. “Do you remember his name, Corporal?”
“I’d like to see Sholto’s belongings. More specifically, I need medication samples.” Sherlock says as he skims through the police reports. Lestrade nods and asks that access to the evidence room is arranged.
“Yeah?” John asks in relief. He’s been working on this speech for a while, so anxious about Sherlock’s response to it.
“Not yet. Now let me ask you again.” Sherlock is impatient. “Why did you divorce James Sholto?”
“Oh, of course.” John says. “That would be lovely.”
“When you’re... a religious man, and you live in despair for nine years, you might turn to whatever other religion there is to bring you comfort. And I needed comfort,” he says, looking straight into Sherlock’s own eyes accusingly. “Nobody knew I was there.
“That it wasn’t an accident we were tipped off about Stewart,” Sherlock whispers as he moves closer to his brother, “that we, that I, were meant to find him.”
“A lecture at the University of London,” Sherlock smirks. “Not Black-Mirror-interesting of course, but it
“I’m sorry,” he says, letting out a suffering exhale. “Fuck. All I’ve been doing since coming back is apologizing to you.”
He gapes at Sherlock, shaken by the mere idea of losing him like that sometimes in an unknown future.
“No, it’s Sholto.” Lestrade explains. “I… I don’t have all the information yet but he’s missing.”
“John.” Sherlock stares back in disbelief, looking at him as if he’s gone mad.
“They didn’t say.” He shrugs.
“Yes, ma’am.”
drunk and miserable.”
Dr. Williams had asked that the family gather to meet with her at 11:30 am, but Sherlock and John are the only ones in William’s room when they arrive. The man in the bed looks solemn and peaceful. They’ve barely settled in when there’s a knock on the door.
She’s surprisingly strong.
“David-”
“You’ve already packed, John.” Sherlock continues. “This is just the last stretch. I promise you, we’ll figure it all out once Mary feels safe again.”
“I saw the tapes of the first hours after your rescue in Gaza,” Mycroft says. “You appeared to have known that Palmer was dead when one of the operatives broke the news to you.”
“What have you been remembering?” John asks. “Anything good?”
“Those things will kill you,” John says to Sherlock’s back as cigarette smoke leaves the man’s mouth. He looks like a film noir character, watching the city spread below them in all its glory. John puts his hands in his pockets, looking around uncomfortably.
“Won’t it, though?” Sherlock grumbles, getting a chuckle out of John.
The next morning John meets Sherlock at the Yard. They both just signed their statements about a case they solved the previous week. Sherlock is bored with the bureaucracy while John texts with a colleague from the clinic.
, as though they’d both popped into existence that day at the lab.
“John?" she asks when he fails to acknowledge her.
John shakes his head, urging himself to speak. “I’m sure she would have had, though. Waited. If she’d even the tiniest hint that you’re still alive.” He says, finally finding his voice. He looks at David, but his words are not aimed at him. “I would have.”
he thinks.
“Oh,” John says. “For… Mary and me?”
“I imagined I might hear from you,” David says with a warm smile.
Who knows.
Sherlock frowns in surprise. “Of course not.”
“So about a year ago,” Jenkins clarifies and David nods.
Sherlock’s wearing his shy smile as he flips through pages, his body language open but hesitant. It’s as if he recognizes the homey environment he’d stepped into, unsure how to behave around this kind-hearted normalcy.
“I’ll say.”
“And buried him,” Sherlock nods.
“Listen, there’s something I haven’t told you about that,” She says hesitantly, shuffling her legs. “The Hanwell surgery is a free clinic. It’s run by Doctors without Borders, you know. For refugees, shelter seekers.”
“That’s as clear and open as I can get. Do you understand everything I just said?”
The question is met with a pregnant silence.
“What for?”
“It was alright.” Sherlock shrugs.
“Alright.” John turns his body to look at Sherlock when he doesn’t answer, moving closer. “For the sake of… no more regrets, I suppose. I’m going to ask you something, Sherlock, and... Don’t take it the wrong way when I do. And please be honest. I can take it, whatever it is. I just need to know.”
"Hm."
"There are unpaid bills here," John said, unimpressed, and Sherlock hummed in acknowledgment. "Should probably pay them."
Not that Sherlock’s life is very colorful these days. Those who live in glass houses, et cetera.
“Because it would have saved us a lot of heartache. A lot of pain.”
“I notice everything about you, Sherlock Holmes.”
Sherlock’s back straightens in mock disdain. “Are you hungry?”
John looks at Lestrade with thankful eyes. He’s happy for the distraction, for the excuse to pull Sherlock away from this madness so he can try and speak to him.
“Indeed,” he says far too delightfully, thrown by her accent; it’s American alright, New England, for sure—with dropped Rs and funny sounding mergers. Well practiced, first nature, but there’s an English undertone he finally catches when she speaks next:
Easiest job she’s ever done.
“Please Sherlock, my shoulder,” Mrs. Hudson is pleading, moving towards him and then adding, “She knows you, she knows your lovely voice. It might work. Just relax.”
“Plenty of people suffer from stage fright, Sherlock. It’s very common. I’m sure we can figure out how to make it easier for you.”
“What are your plans for today?” She asks John.
“An entire army base filled with intelligence officers is keeping an eye on him, Sherlock.”
Alexander stares at John, shocked.
He supposedly learns about this stunningly shocking fact from Sherlock in a short and light-hearted discussion during The Six Thatchers, while admitting he knew AGRA quite well back in the day.
At the time John wished Sherlock would pull his eyes away from his damn phone, take an active part in Rosie’s first days on Earth. John wanted to name the baby Catherine. Mary flat out refused.
John sharply holds a hand up, cutting him off. “Seriously, we’re not gonna talk about this?”
Sherlock stares at him for a long minute, his internal battle manifesting in his lips curling angrily. Finally, he nods, unsure but defiant.
“Well, excuse me for caring about your well being, Sherlock.”
“I’m not sure, I wasn’t there myself. I only gave permission for a short chat, no longer than a few minutes,” Edwin says. “We can ask for the recording to be processed and sent to us.”
This isn’t how this was supposed to go. Not at all. This isn’t the work he’d committed himself to when he took off on that plane nearly a year ago. His options are running thin; a breakthrough will have to be reached through John’s eager agreement to meet with the two most important players in the game: Captain Aldridge, and David himself.
John picks up his pace, wanting to be closer to Sherlock. He huddles next to him, absorbing his warmth. Their shoulders brush as they walk; they’re so close. John’s voice is low and Sherlock leans closer to listen.
It’s only later when he sits in the car, cursing the City and its rush hour traffic, that John thinks back on their exchange and realizes that he feels absolutely nothing.
, John. The ship guides you to your rightful location.”
—fuck—”
“I know you’re no—”
“We think it’s best he continues to lay low as Peter Knight for now, at least until his next assignment.”
. I already thanked her a million times since she posted it yesterday, but isn't it gorgeous?
It didn’t work.
“It’s unsafe, you know. For Rosie. We’re semi-famous, the address is on the website. People come and go. Some crazy things happened there in the past,” John says. “And Mycroft.”
“I’ll do it some other time!” Sherlock calls over his shoulder, rushing out.
“John.” Sherlock turns in his chair and squints, taking his headphones down. His eyes are red and tired; of course they would be, if he spends his days watching the video feed and reading on his phone in this poor lighting.
“In the parking lot, brother,” Mycroft says. “Imagine that.”
“We did, yeah,” John says, clearing his throat. “But it’s only been me and her the entire weekend and I think she’s sick of seeing my face—”
The room is so quiet that John can hear Sherlock swallow, can hear the man's mind whirring like a steam engine.
“And then what happened?”
Sherlock rushes inside, joining Billy next to the table. He huffs in annoyance when he sees that David is just about to hang up.
“Yes. But don’t worry about it.” John shakes his head. “I promised I’d wait, didn’t I? It’s just... seeing grey hair on you. Don’t take this the wrong way, Sherlock, but I hate that we’re wasting time. I love you. I want you here with me.”
“Why’s that?”
“Yes.”
He shakes his head at Sherlock’s raised eyebrow.
Filling the car to the brim and worrying if he’d overdone it, he secures Rosie’s booster seat and settles in for the ride. She’s silent and well behaved throughout and he sits back, his tense body finally relaxing.
What if the raid that led to David's rescue was nothing but a smoke-screen, so Abu Nazir could escape again?
“Jesus. Their bedroom, Sherlock?” John turns to question Sherlock and finds his face grim, his jaw tight.
The last few days have been good. They’ve been spending a lot of time together, solving cases from 221B, and eating plenty of take outs.
They jump at the sound of a ringing phone; it takes John a second to realize it’s his. Reluctantly, he removes it from his pocket, checking the caller ID. “It’s Mycroft,” he sighs, not for the first time scandalized by the elder Holmes’ horrendous timing.
John looks away, frustrated. Yes, he did. The man sitting in front of him knows more about Sherlock’s time away then he does. But then… John shakes his head. What would he have done if Sherlock was the one sitting here in front him, telling him about firing squads, dislocated shoulders, electric shocks?
But he wasn’t dead; there was no silence; only the steady rhythm of his stubborn, traitorous heart, a brutal proof of his own cursed survival.
Sherlock nods and allows himself to relax. They leave the market halls for a while, heading towards the high-street stores in hopes of finding everything on their list.
“He didn’t need to tell me,” John says, his blood nearly boiling. “I saw it on the news. We both did. He saved that man from years of torture and imprisonment. He did something this country has failed to do for years.”
“Then why are you sneaking in like a thief?” John asks, “Where’s your key?”
John gazed at him. Sherlock could tell he was about to break anyway, so he spared him.
“No, no one.”
John buries his head in his hands. Everything is always his fault, isn’t it?
“Let me do this, Al,” he says. “Please. I’ve taken so much from you. All these years, you… let me give something back. I need to feel… I need to feel useful again, love.”
“Sorry I didn’t get a chance to check in,” John says, oblivious to Sherlock's emotional whirlwind. “The day was a bloody train wreck.”
, he thinks bitterly. There was... pillow talk, which he wasn't able to hear very clearly. David awoke loudly twice from nightmares, but went back to sleep after that.
“We became nothing, John,” Sherlock says sternly. “I was doing my job.”
“That could have been anyone. Any British soldier anywhere in the world.”
“Corporal Stewart,” the man begins, “it is my pleasure to welcome you home on behalf of the Prime Minister and a grateful country." John moves closer to the screen hesitantly, searching helplessly.
), John nestles in and lets out a satisfied sigh at the warmth it provides.
undeserving of it. Neither he nor Mary deserve John, but if there’s one person in the world Sherlock trusts other than himself to keep John—
“Excellent,” another officer says. “Corporal, I’m Captain Jenkins and I’m the lead analyst in our Afghanistan section. I’d like to start with a few questions about the day of your capture. Were you briefed on possible breaches in your compound that day?”
“Don’t be. He asked for your opinion and you gave it.”
John rocks uncomfortably on the balls of his feet. “You dance?”
“How did you know?” Sherlock asks and John’s stomach twists and turns. He
It’s Sherlock.
“He was.” Sherlock nods with his heart in his throat, handing John the laptop. “But then three hours ago, she sent this.”
“Beautiful. Beautiful. Look at you. Yes.” John encourages him. He can feel the orgasm building, the rhythm turning erratic; one second Sherlock’s body is moving, the next he covers his eyes with the crook of his elbow as he comes, his entire body a dispersing shockwave.
“The full experience.” John smiles.
“How do you feel about that, Sherlock?” David asks.
Sherlock wondered.
Sherlock looks at him intently, his face twisting in sympathetic pain.
One has to wonder why she is so cheerful given that she’d just watched her intended sucker-punch a man twice in two hours, instead of asking her to marry him. Is this how normal people usually react?
“Are you still taking your antidepressants?” the doctor asks. “How’s your mood these days, generally?”
John’s standing behind the door to his flat, hiding like a coward. Molly had just come over to pick Rosie up for the night. He was collecting the last things for the overnight bag when they heard the knock on the door.
He's certain he wouldn’t have if it weren’t for Rosie.
He doesn’t need Mycroft’s permission. Sherlock is his own man, and he will not refuse John. He’s back now, his mission over and——
John is feeding Rosie on the sofa - doing a stand-up job of it, considering. She’s dozing in his arms, unaware of her father’s mental state. When she’s done, Sherlock wordlessly takes her from him.
takes
“Why aren’t you…?” Sherlock asks, turning his head from the laptop screen.
Sherlock doesn't respond. Instead, he removes both hands from his pockets and clenches them tightly behind his back.
, because what he thinks just happened couldn’t have really happened. “Yeah?”
“I have some work to catch up on,” she says. “Could you give Rosie her dinner?”
John lifts his chin, challenging, and then his eyes. A silence stretches between them, thick and ugly, and he wonders what she sees there. If she notices the storm inside him—and he’s sure she does—she doesn’t say.
“I did say that, yes,” John says. “And I meant it at the time. I tried, Lord knows I tried. But this… I can’t. I can’t Mary, I’m sorry.”
“I’m afraid I come bearing bad news, brother,” Mycroft returns four days later, and he slips into Sherlock’s small, metal-grey room, closing the door behind him.
Sherlock watches David staring into the distance. “But then all hell broke loose.”
Thomas (
John nods back, satisfied.
“Have you told Sherlock how you feel?” she asks. He’s struck by how simple that sounds, in theory.
No one speaks for a moment.
“John?”
“Fine. OK. But how long? When’s your flight back?”
Six weeks ago, Jim Moriarty had left them by a pool, confused and relieved.
“Good.” John nods. “I’m glad.”
John’s heart stops.
“He’s bluffing, John,” Sherlock says. “Every word coming out of his mouth, always, is a calculated lie. I’d have thought you’ve figured that out by now.”
Sherlock shakes his head. “John, please. You know me better than that.”
“Do what, talk? You’ve been ignoring me for days.”
He looked at him with big, pleading eyes. "I can't do this with her anymore, Sherlock. It's not working." He said quietly, shaking his head.
“Trust me, son, you don’t want to stay here for this.”
“Of course. We can talk on the way there!” Sherlock calls back, his mind already moving at a hundred miles per hour.
Sherlock lowers his eyes, hesitating. “The assumptions you made about Ajay… that they’re... I think you’re wrong. I saw murderous anger in his eyes; he wasn’t looking for long-lost love.”
“A whole month they’ve been rehearsing this,” Lestrade yells over the thumping of the music, taking a swig of his pint. John snickers at that.
“Turn around. Back to the hospital.” John calls urgently, aiming his words at the driver.
“Obtaining new skills. Tackling new challenges.”
John feels her eyes on them and looks at her, his stare defiant and tired. He looks away again.
“They were observing the compound, weren’t they? Spying.” Sherlock continues, deducing. “Knew all the ins and outs, the schedules, the comings and goings. They realized that if you and Jonathan were on duty together the compound was compromised. It was their best chance to try and raid it.”
He gathers his strength and leaves the kitchen, calling “Good night.” over his shoulder.
She’s grown. She’s laughing, engulfed by Sherlock. John probably took that photo. There are other photos. Rosie on a blanket on the floor of 221B. Rosie on John's lap in a restaurant.
Lestrade’s text simply reads: “What did he win?” Amused and confused by the question, John calls Lestrade and asks about the photo.
Deciding to err on the safe side, John takes his hand away.
“So you said. So why are you—” John hesitates. “What’s this about, really? What did I do?”
Sherlock looks at the contract again—the
“I need a word, Mycroft. Privately.”
“What?” John asks.
Nothing for it.
Sherlock’s head tilts in confusion. “Talk about what?”
