There shouldn’t have brought such a big rush of pleasure from Teal, Castiel watching as his daemon fluffed up his feathers further. He sighed, glaring at Dean. “You’re not helping.”
Mira did growl at that, feeling her hackles rise. “You know why that happened.”
“When angels take vessels they spread their true form between daemon and human. It allows for both of them to be protected while we’re in the vessel. I am the portion that was in Vera. It was the easiest way.”
Teal narrowed his eyes, going flat black, but he didn’t move away from the box. Castiel sighed and reached out to touch him, running his fingers through Teal’s feathers. “Unless I manage to find Larkin and somehow restore Mary to how she was, and you to life, he won’t forgive me. It’s possible that he’ll throw in allowing Lucifer to use me as a vessel, insisting on removing the Mark from him and briefly becoming God and all the subterfuge that entailed as well.”
Something was already missing from them, he couldn’t give it Mira too.
Cas watched all of this, Dean feeling the weight of the angel’s gaze on the two of them. It was almost a relief when the deep, searching stare stopped and Cas leaned forward. “It’s that bad already.” It wasn’t a question, although Dean nodded all the same. Cas just frowned. “There was that ghoul not too long ago.”
“Yes.”
The anger bubbled up, Dean curling his hands into fists before it fizzled out, leaving the emptiness behind. It was temporary, but he would take it. Anger was exhausting and he was just tired of it all.
He felt Teal shift on his shoulder, giving his daemon a sidelong look. Teal looked more like himself now that they weren’t dying. His feathers were sleek now, although not shining with iridescence out of respect. It was better than when it looked like the feathers were melting off of him.
He dropped his hand to the top of the mason jar, feeling a flash of guilt. Kelly was right, Cas had deserved better than what he had managed to dig up out of the cupboards at the house. But he had hoped that Cas would come back, or that the kid could do something about it. It was always meant to be temporary, just not like this.
She finally stopped in the middle of the street, swinging her head around to watch as he shuffled to a stop beside her, breathing heavily. Mira dropped her gaze to the side, not meeting his gaze until she huffed. “You’re slowing down.”
Miracle ducked their head, shifting on their feet before perking up. “Oh! Jack sent me to tell you that since they’re back, Sam wants to talk about what to do about Michael.”
Castiel didn’t listen, ignoring the thought and feeling of a sound that might have come from Teal or it might have come from him. He flexed his fingers again before gently cupping Dean’s cheek. He heard Dean suck in a quick, frightened breath, the rattle of it in him and the struggle to get it past the blood in his throat. Castiel tried to soothe it away, gentling his touch further even as he poured grace into Dean, chasing after the places knocked open and bleeding. He had rebuilt this body, he knew how to ease the pieces of it back into place, even that shoulder that refused to stay properly in place no matter how many times he healed Dean.
Castiel sighed and held out his arm, having to wait longer than it should have taken for Teal to realize what the request was for. They didn’t do this usually, Castiel didn’t have to worry about Teal falling behind because he was always with Mira. He hadn’t realized to the extent that he had become used to it until it was gone.
“Nick.”
That shouldn’t have felt like such a loss.
She pulled away, giving him a long look. “Teal?”
He turned, Mira brushing against his legs as she curled around him to stand on his other side. She was a little too close, but Dean didn’t care. He wanted her away from all of these people who couldn’t tell a daemon from an animal. Especially away from the Fake Cas who was now crouched down so he was uncomfortably close to Mira.
Dean reached over, taking care to lean around where Teal was standing so very close to him, to pat at her paw. “The spear.”
He pushed the thought away for later, focusing on where Mira was still curled tightly around Teal. She was nudging his side gently, probably still checking him over. A few loose feathers drifted down, but Castiel wasn’t too worried. The patches of feathers that had fallen out under the effects of the poison had grown back instantly, the rest must have just been loosened and ready to fall. That didn’t stop Mira from whining, nudging Teal more forcefully, even if the raven didn’t move at all. He just partially closed his eyes and sat there under the attention.
There was hope in her voice and in the way that Dean’s gaze snapped back over to him. Castiel held his gaze, preferring that to an answer.
Castiel frowned, shaking his head. “He deserved better.”
The wolf’s tail wagged twice, her mouth lolling open in a way that could have been alarming, but their soul was shining brightly. It was base gold and green, but quickly flashing through a myriad of colors.
“What-”
“Yes.” Teal gave Dean a quick look before relaxing into Miracle. “We saw.”
Looking away was muscle memory now, Dean dropping his gaze towards Mira. She hadn’t done the same, instead putting her forepaws on the van again. “If you’re grace and all of that, why don’t you burn our eyes out?”
Mira bared her teeth in a full snarl, the kind that wrinkled up her entire face and meant danger instead of a warning. “You got to touch him. This is all I get.”
That was expected. What was not was for Dean to storm over, Mira trotting at his heels.
That got him to pause, Mira feeling the tension along her back increasing in time with the way that Dean was clutching at her. “Nah, Cas. You’re the one with the job.”
Teal bobbed his head towards Sabine. “Yes, Nick. As soon as he said yes, his daemon was destroyed.”
He forced himself to let go of her fur, relieved when Mira remained close to him. She was shifting though, like she wanted to pace, or she wanted to cross the distance to Teal, since there was nothing for him to perch on between the van and them. Dean dropped his gaze down to Mira.
Dean let out his breath in a rush, taking a step back when the whole backlot spun around him. It was only when Mira was pressing up against his leg, bracing him up, that he was able to take a breath. Dean stared at the raven that was still half sprawled across his arms, some of the panic ebbing away at the bird righted itself.
“Fifteen. Got it.” Mira took a step back, shaking herself like she needed to reset. Dean knew the feeling, you would think six years would make him immune, but he kept getting sucked in.
The bed was only a few steps away, but her legs wobbled with everyone. She pinned her ears when Dean snorted, giving him a snarl with no bite to it. “I’d like to see you try and walk.”
“Dean?”
That seemed to be enough to break the tension. Cas might have been in the house, a seemingly impossible distance from his fake-daemon, and it was weird. But it could be shoved away into the rest of Cas and Teal’s weird angel shit, but it was workable.
He didn’t startle when Mira pushed her head under his arm, Dean draping his arm over her. She nosed into her side before straining to look over the table. “Why did he leave his daemon behind?”
“Later, after…” He paused, trying to contemplate what that would mean. It would be after they put Eileen and Ruairí together, after they talked to Michael, after they tried to find something that would stop God. After returning to Kelly, after deciding what to do to honor Jack.
Teal tilted his head to the side, confused by this. “That’s a rare condition.”
Teal stared at him, the feathers on the back of his neck settling slowly. Dean was anticipating a head tilt, but Teal stared at him straight on. Teal clacked his beak, Dean beginning to connect that with annoyance, like the way that Cas would huff.
She froze in place, automatically starting to crouch like she could hide in the shadows.
Fake Cas had the gall to be confused. “He likes you better.”
“Should it?”
Dean seemed to have realized what he had done, because he swallowed, staring at his hand. He made like he was going to lift his hand up before making a clear effort to set it down again. “Cas.”
“No.” Teal puffed his chest out. “We’re connected like you to Sabine, not like angel to inhabited daemon.”
Dean paused to look at it as Sam shut the door. “Dunno, might be able to do something with a sledgehammer.”
Castiel tensed briefly, looking for a threat that he knew was not there. He stopped himself from searching Teal for any further influence, because he knew that any conditioning that Naomi had done wouldn’t remain. That left just Teal, staring at him with more panic than he had ever seen or felt in the raven, and Dean and Mira trying to hide their soft noises of pain.
Teal just gave him a look that clearly said that he thought this was another strange human thing. He shifted it to Mira, like he expected her to back off as well.
His voice cracked in anger, horror, shock, a thousand small things that were flying back and forth between him and Mira until he couldn’t tell what was from who.
There was a desperate croak from somewhere over his shoulder, and then Dean was shaking, his knees nearly giving out. Castiel grabbed for him, steadying Dean up against him before looking back at their daemons.
Castiel was an ancient being, he had watched the development of single celled life forms with no mind to the passage of time. Falling hadn’t altered that much. But Dean Winchester always did.
“Teal is me.”
He expected her to lose her patience and shove him back, but she just tipped her head to the side. “Bobby’s down there. But it’s not Gisila.”
Mira huffed, rolling onto her stomach. “And we’re back to square one.”
That time it was tragic. But every other time was wonderous, orgasmic. And it was television, so it had to be exaggerated. But she knew what another touch felt like, the bone deep violation that came with it. So maybe it made sense that when it was wanted, accepted, that it would be euphoric. When it was
That got him to pause, Mira coming back to his side to bump up against his leg. Dean rested his fingers against her head. “You coming?”
Teal grumbled to himself, nudging at his wing before determining that it would hold. It wasn’t broken, it just felt out of joint. He folded it the best he could against himself before looking up at the door.
The sound startled him, because Mira rarely howled. It threw him back to Cold Oak, while he had clutched at Sam’s body and Mira had screamed into a howl when Sabine disappeared. To the hospital when Bobby died.
Sam looked confused. “But, he was here, but you weren’t.”
Dean glanced over at Teal, tensing as the raven dropped from the table, spreading his wings only enough to glide onto Mira’s shoulders. He was sure that it was just imagination or some of the pre-Mark desperate hunger that he watched the bare edge of Teal’s wing skim across his flannel. But it couldn’t have happened because he didn’t feel anything.
Teal clacked his beak, but the feathers didn’t settle. Castiel cocked his head, studying Teal.
“Then what’s wrong with Mira?”
They had never been trusted to rebuild a human before.
Mira paused, tipping her head back so he could see one golden eye, a similar gold to the color that her and Dean would flicker when he looked at their soul. She must have seen something in his expression or in the way that he was holding himself because she twisted to press her nose against his feathers. “I’ve got you Teal.”
“It’s not the best time to have a child.”
“That depends on them.”
Mira huffed in response, heaving herself partially upright to gently smooth down some of the feathers that she had messed up, but not all of them. Teal looked more like himself rumpled.
“Just,” Dean reached back to pat at her side. “Stop. There’s a rift, make sure it’s closed.”
He could see Mira’s hackles rising out of the corner of his eye, so he just shrugged, very purposefully relaxing. “Mira wanted to sunbathe.”
The only thing they could do was this, make Cas and Teal feel good now and hope that would be enough when they left.
Jack’s daemon had not been settled despite his physical appearance, so they had always been flickering through whatever form they took their fancy. But Miracle had most often chosen the form of a white, shaggy dog of no immediately recognizable breed.
He threw a glance over at the Impala, watching as Dean leaned against the car like it was the only thing holding him up, Mira braced against his leg.
She started on his back, using her nose to ruck up his feathers before smoothing them back down with her chin. Teal shuddered with the first run, rocking forward before slumping down.
Teal tipped his head to the side, Dean tensing when the raven didn’t answer. Thankfully, Cas didn’t keep him in suspense. “There have been others. Some even manage to remember their daemon’s name.”
“You do.” Teal reached out to nibble at the fur at the top of her muzzle.
“Aye, but how long have you been living for?” She didn’t give him the chance to answer, patting his cheek one more time before pulling away. “Take the advice. Make the first move because Dean Winchester won’t. He’s made of anger and stubbornness.”
Castiel glanced back at where Mira was strolling over, the corner of his mouth quirking up. “Well that makes two of us.”
She had watched Cas stop twice. Once as he had bled out against a building, the raven that Dean hadn’t named yet limp in his lap. The second had been when she had charged into an apartment, teeth bared and ready to pull Cas and Teal from whatever trouble they had gotten into only to watch that reaper stab Cas. Some part of her had expected the burst of light that had always come from angels. Cas hadn’t obliged, he had slipped away from them without much fanfare.
Dean made a strangled sound in the back of his throat, shaking his head. “Ok, so this is…” There was something about the crack in his voice, something that made Castiel want to slip off the hood of the car, but Dean was already backing away. “No, that’s…come on, man.”
Mira sat up abruptly, the shocked look on her face making him realize that he had said the last bit out loud. Dean cursed and grabbed at her scruff, wanting to ground himself again. Except she was shaking now, and that wasn’t helping him at all. And now he could feel Teal and Cas staring at them. At first it was worry and then they were tilting their hands in unison.
Dean glanced over, and then immediately regretted that he had. He had managed not to see much of the apocalypse world people because there were too many and being tired was a convenient excuse. Because looking at them was like looking in a funhouse mirror and getting vertigo at the same time.
“What-” Dean stared at him in shock, his mouth moving as he formed and reformed sentences. Castiel thought he saw some of his words being repeated.
Mira nudged his wing gently again, waiting for Teal’s gaze to drop back to her before shifting so she could lift her head over his back. “Like this.”
“The list is long and varied.” Castiel paused for a moment, closing his eyes. “And forgiven.”
That got another one of those harsh laughs, Dean shaking his head. He looked away, staring at their daemons. Castiel watched the two of them out of the corner of his eye, not that he thought that Mira would do anything. Teal was more than able to get himself out of trouble. As it was, Mira had her head on the hood, staring at the raven as Teal took cautious steps towards her.
Mira edged back with him before going to her belly and slinking back until she was in the center of the roof. She crouched there, her gaze darting from Dean to the edge of the roof. “How much do they know?”
Mira turned her head slightly, staring into the kitchenette. Everything was as they had left it, including the first aid kit just left open on the table it a fit of exhaustion. The shades had been drawn over the window, but they weren’t even. There was a bulge in them.
Teal tilted his head, so much like Cas that it brought a fresh wave of tears, these making him shake.
He reached out for her, purposefully falling short so he wouldn’t touch the ash. “Mira?”
Mira glared back at Teal before dropping down with a huff. She had to toss her head to get the curtain off of her head, watching it as it fell back onto Teal, hiding him again. Mira stared at the shape, only turning away when Dean’s chair creaked. She turned, intending to find a comfortable spot on the floor by him when Cas sat up with a groan.
Dean looked around, looking for the familiar shape in the shadows. Sabine was good at hiding, neither of them would have been allowed on any hunt if their daemons couldn’t, but in a world without daemons a maned wolf have been even more noticeable. He didn’t spot her, but she might have been lurking closer to Sam. He didn’t blame her after a year of being separated.
Teal hissed and mantled his wings, some of the feathers that had been damaged by the spear’s poison falling loose. Mira tracked them as they fell, her tail going stiff in her unease.
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Mira relaxing, the tension leaving the sides of her mouth and tail.
Dean closed his eyes, counting under his breath until it felt like the world was less tilted, less ready to slide out of place. It wasn’t much better, but he felt like he could move again.
Dean clutched Mira close for a moment more, almost glad when the emptiness coldness started to leak over from her again. That would make everything easier, at least for the moment.
Dean watched a woman hurry by with an armful of papers, his stomach turning alarmingly at the lack. It was wrong, like the whole world had been cut, but they were fine. Dean had firsthand experience with Sam and Sabine had returned severed from the cage. The Saminator with Sabine about as useful as a stuffed animal. But this was nothing like that. They were normal, but their souls were just internal, or something.
Cas without a daemon was something close to normal. He had prayed and Cas had appeared. Teal was bound to follow in a moment, whenever he was done with whatever heavenly business that had kept Cas away.
The substituted answer made him open his eyes, nodding over at Teal. “Yeah. That.”
world, and
It was a strange combination of instinct and habit that had him folding his wings around Dean. Dean couldn’t feel them, but he seemed to sense them because he relaxed against Castiel.
He heard more than saw Fate get caught, the goddess shrieking as she was pulled along. The sound lasted until the black ooze climbed over her, silencing her just before it hit Cas.
She might have murmured his name, because he moved like he was looking down at her. Mira just tugged him closer, breathing in the scent his feathers. He still smelled like ozone, like angel. Cas didn’t. She whined and turned her head so she was rubbing the side of it up and down Teal’s chest.
Castiel nodded, not that Dean saw. He was already sliding into the car and turning it on. Castiel heard the radio start up, a commercial for a local station at a reasonable volume, which meant that Mira hadn’t been messing with it, nor was she messing with it now. Instead, she had sunk out of sight into the seat. Teal clacked his beak at that, but there was nothing they could do but watch as the car pulled away and back onto the road.
“Destroy it all and fuck you, God.”
“It can wait a few hours.”
There had been the underlying assumption that the Righteous Man’s daemon might not be found, or whatever connection had been between the two of them had been irrevocably broken. But Castiel had found the Righteous Man, off the rack and torturing with the hellhound at his heels.
It was strange seeing Somerled like this after seeing him on Earth. Somerled had been a normal enough daemon, for all he was attached to a witch. But down in Hell and after death, he looked more like a hellhound, trailing smoke and sparks in his wake when he moved. It was strange. Then again, Castiel couldn’t imagine any demon managing to get their hands on Somerled long enough to change him fully into a hellhound, nor a demon torturing Rowena. She had probably taken over Hell before they knew what was happening.
“Well,” Rowena’s nails tapped against the stone, “count me in the search for the poor pup.”
Castiel tore his gaze away as Dean grabbed him by the shoulder and hauled him close. “So, all of that and you’re just going to fly off?”
He shuffled a little bit away from where Castiel was groaning and started to get up, stretching his wings. Castiel might be able to fill him in on the rest while things were still fuzzy. Teal frowned, lifting his wings up as high as they would go.
“They can’t find him, Sam is still warded.”
Dean chuckled, watching her tail wag in response. “High praise.”
“I bet you could fly just as far as I could throw Cas.”
Mira whined, craning her neck further back. Teal wanted to sway closer in the off chance that she would do something, but he kept himself still. “That’s why I think Lucifer didn’t come after me after we were banished. To him, there’s shame in having a daemon, it’s more human. Maybe he thinks I’ll just drop somewhere or come back to him if he asserts enough pressure on Castiel to keep him contained.”
“Creating a daemon that would burn out human eyes isn’t the point if we wanted to not draw attention. It’s like how you perceive the angel blades, or wings.”
Teal didn’t look like he quite believed them, his wings spreading slightly like he was about to take flight and check on it himself or mantle them. In the end, he did neither, settling them back with a suspicious look at the both of them. “That’s something for Gabriel, once he recovers.”
“No,” she held up a hand with a smile. “I’m invested now, if not for Mary or dear Jack’s sake, then for your sake.”
There was a strange rippling sound, like something was being ripped open and then water trickling out. Mira jerked around first at it, staring at the wall behind them. Dean was already turning while she was speaking.
“I could manage something.”
“Yes! Cas is all the way back at the house and you’re here.”
“You too, Cas.”
Davangere. Dublin. Dimitrovgrad. Darwin. Divo.
Dean glanced over at one walked by, making kissing noises at Mira. That was enough to get her to finish shoving through his legs, Mira crouching close to the ground. He could feel her shaking there, ready to sprint to the end of their bond to get away. And Dean would let her. He would let her run until he collapsed for the pain if it would get her away. She wouldn’t be alone, Sabine was lurking out among the trailers somewhere, hiding since someone had noticed her after they had tumbled through the window and screamed.
“No, but I seem to be the only one of the two of us who remembers all the dislocated shoulders we’ve had.” Mira narrowed her eyes. “Must be the concussions. They got your brain first.”
He swallowed the sensation back down, although Mira still bristled slightly with it. She braced herself better on the table, staring to lean towards Cas before she corrected herself.
“Cas,” Teal whispered, partially a reminder to move and partially a question. Teal should have known the answer to that at least, he could feel it as much as Castiel.
“It means daemon that aren’t normal, Cas.”
“There have been three babies born since their arrival.”
Her eyes widened, her mouth dropping open for a moment. Dean felt Mira tense, pressing down on her in the hopes that she wouldn’t growl. He needed her to be amiable, as dog-like as possible. Sometimes they were able to get by with a nod and a mutter about her being a malamute, but this was a different world. There might be a chance that the people here wouldn’t know a wolf on sight and know what it meant.
The moment he and Teal had broken into the room with the Silver Guillotine, with the hum of the anbaric just underneath Dean and Mira’s shouting. The awful realization of what they were about to do the them, and the holy, righteous anger that had burned through him and Teal.
He thought he heard a strangled sound from Dean, but he didn’t get the chance to linger over to too long because Rowena was leaning in too close, her voice dropping low. “Regret is a heavy burden, dear angel, not worth the taking. Take the advice of a wise witch.”
It took her a moment to come back, and even then Dean was sure that he felt the Mark pulse faster, the desperate need of it pounding loud in his ears until it was the only thing that he knew. He swallowed hard, clutching at Mira until the pain was enough to break through.
A pulse of grace was enough to heal them and the other small problems, but it left him exhausted. He couldn’t pull from Castiel, he hadn’t been able to since the Leviathan had taken them over. His flight and healing had taken a lot out of him.
Cas thought he was caring, loving, and good.
“Jesus.”
“Teal doesn’t like touch like this.” There wasn’t as much Teal to touch comparatively anyway, but that wasn’t the point.
“It means they’re staying right?”
Boudica chuckled, her tail lashing. “A challenge then.”
“Rowena…”
Dean recovered by the time that Mira was past, reaching out to pat her well beyond where Teal was perched. “Come on, Sam and Sabine probably want to get their nerd on. That leaves us to rustle up some grub before the two of them collapse from hunger.”
He leaned forward, Mira coming up to push between his legs at the same time. Castiel risked a glance down at her, almost wanting her to come forward. His gaze flicked back up to Dean, feeling Teal tighten his grip on his arm in reaction to the longing that they both felt. But the problem with longing was that it was mostly directionless, it was just a want towards something without specifics.
“In a manner of speaking. They’re being changed into something more familiar to you but not fully on this plane. I exist here all the time, therefore, I have to be able to be perceived and appear recognizable.” Teal turned his head to fix his gaze on Dean, his head tipping slightly like he was staring at the fist that Dean still had pressed against his side. The fixed angel stare was back, a stillness settling over the raven.
Castiel gave Dean and Mira one last look, trying not to stare too much at the absentminded stroke of Dean’s hand over her head and onto her neck before spreading his wings and taking flight.
Castiel blinked, turning the words over in his head and the tone of voice before things slipped back into place. That wasn’t something that was in his head alone, it was spoken.
“She is.” Mira lolled against him, still snickering. “Too bad the spell didn’t call for a cat.”
Mira ducked around his hand, Dean seeing the moment when she made her decision before she was taking off at a run. Dean cursed and took off after her. Sam and Fake Cas shouted at him, but he just gestured vaguely over his shoulder. Fake Cas didn’t have to worry about a daemon, and Sam could let Sabine wander as far as the two of them wanted. Dean didn’t want to feel the horrible pull of his daemon getting too far away, or else he really would throw up. Worse still was the idea that someone would think she was a dog and try to touch her.
She dropped her head to rest on her paws, struggling to keep her focus on the conversation instead of what she desperately wanted to do. “It’s fine. Dean won’t hurt him.”
“So,” Dean drew the word out a bit, “Cas’ wings aren’t all feathery?”
He didn’t get it, Cas squeezing his shoulder. Dean moved forward slightly under the pressure, his gaze darting from Cas to Teal. He couldn’t settle on one of them, and it felt important that he did.
The man and his hare daemon hadn’t seemed to be anything but honest, if not nervous. And now they were dead, the hare gone the moment that Wally had been stabbed. Everyone but Sam had missed that moment of departure, but the rest of them had been there when they had burned Wally’s body. Castiel was sure that the smoke clung to all of them, Wally staying with them until they washed the last of him away.
Dean took a deep breath and followed after, picking up his pace when he realized how far Mira was getting from him. She wasn’t at their limit, Mira never even got close to it, but it was too far and his fingers were already itching with the need to haul her close. He’d feel better if she was against his leg like she always was. Dean flexed his fingers, trying to chase away the strange emptiness as the followed them back into the bunker.
Dean stared at him, trying to wrap his head around the concept. He didn’t know how normal humans and daemons worked, not in depth. From everything that he had heard, it was still something that was being discussed and tested. It was the kind of thing that Sam was interested in. Dean didn’t need anything more than Mira at his side, solid and there.
“Mira’s got him.”
A jingle caught his attention, Dean jerking his attention back to the conversation as Sam pulled out the key that Balthazar had left with them. Cas was taking them from Sam, looking closely at them before glancing over at the two of them. His gaze dropped to where Mira was still crouched between Dean’s legs. Some expression crossed his face, something new, strange, and gone before Dean could make sense of it.
Dean slumped forward, pulling his knees up so he could brace his elbows against them as he broke. The first sob felt like a sharp knife in his chest, and the ones that followed took the same path, carving deeper and deeper until it ached to breathe as much as it did to hold his breath.
He pressed against the joint, feeling as it slipped slightly as he moved. From by his feet, Mira groaned and wiggled back onto her back to sun her stomach. Dean stepped towards her, ready to reach down and rub what was offered when he heard the scuff of a shoe behind him. He turned to look, relaxing when he saw Cas stepping out onto the roof.
Castiel huffed, well aware of the way that Teal was mantling at Mira. “Someone else could find her in that time.”
Dean didn’t get or hear the warning because Mira heard him practically whine out Cas’ name before he came, Mira’s leg twitching hard with the sensation.
This time, he did reach down and pluck the tuft of loose hair from her coat, taking the time to rub his beak against the edge of her shoulder. It didn’t get her relax, but it was something. It also gave him the time to think.
“Mira?” Teal hopped forward, taking one quick one back as the humans shifted. He spread his wings, flapping them like he was going to take flight, but his claws were firmly curled into the scratchy carpet.
Dean reached down to grab her tail, Teal watched as he just swung it gently, never in danger of pulling it. Mira let it happen, only lifting her lip a little. “Are you gonna wag my tail for me or do something about the door?”
“No, there are specific cases where that may be true, but the divide is more like 60-40 depending on birth rates.”
That Dean didn’t answer immediately made her heart pound in her chest.
Teal glared up at him, blue flickering in his eyes. It didn’t last, the raven hunkering down, looking haunted. “Watch the bees.”
Tomorrow they would drive back down to the bunker, because the case was done and Cas had a life here that wasn’t shaped for them. They had tried it once before with Lisa and Ben, but they were too broken for that, too dangerous and not meant for normal. It should have been obvious considering that she was a wolf. Sam and Sabine were waiting for them. And if they stayed it would be more of the same, the crawling sensation that they had to be doing something, the stares and whispers. People taking Cas aside to ask if he was ok and not being hurt.
Dean tensed under his hand, Castiel pausing too. When Dean didn’t relax, Castiel dropped his hand away. That seemed to be what Dean had been waiting for because he stepped away.
“Do you want to?”
He hadn’t touched Mira during the raising, and not really during the rebuilding. He had coaxed her out of the residue that had been left on Dean from her last stand, snarling and snapping at the hellhounds as they had been surrounded. The rest he had pulled out of the world itself, finding the scattered bit of her physical form on earth where they drifted and gathering them up into a shape of a wolf. He had shaped bone, muscle and ligament, skin and fur and set everything in motion again. Then he hadn’t cared beyond function, because the Righteous Man had needed his daemon. He hadn’t known what that want was.
“Yes.”
Boudica dipped her head before stepping away, drifting away into smoke and shadow as she returned to her demon. Castiel felt Teal start to move after her, curious by her appearance and disappearance. Castiel found himself intrigued too. A reclaimed hellhound was rare, especially when most demons couldn’t be bothered.
She leaned close, her gaze flicking over to where Dean was sitting. Castiel allowed himself a quick look out of the corner of his eye, not surprised to see Dean pretending to not be paying any attention to them. Mira was a little less successful. She was standing directly between where Sam and Sabine had disappeared and where the three of them were standing.
He slowed, searching for it. There was a perfect spot somewhere, it was just a matter of finding it.
Teal hopped once before taking to the air, but he didn’t fly away. Instead, he circled close, feeling Lucifer reaching for him over and over before he finally gave up and slipped into full control of the Castiel.
He swallowed, a human habit he found that he was picking up, before he carefully folded his wings back and away again. “The bees.”
“Busy.” Teal’s feathers flickered red and blue. “We’ll pass on the news of your ascension.”
Dean rubbed his hand over his face, ignoring the way it shook. It was better to focus on the ache of his knuckles and Mira ahead of him instead of everything else that was barely contained. Of all the things he had fucked up in his life, this was one of the few that he could
“About the Mark, no.” Dean drummed his fingers against the laptop, trying to ignore the way that they fell into the pattern of the throb of the Mark on his arm. “Hunts are looking good though.”
The pointed look his way was not needed, but Teal did it anyway. His daemon had a point, having something to pinpoint Kelly would be better than driving around and sending Teal off in a completely different direction after rumors. The bunker also meant a guarantee of safety, the warding would keep out angels, demons and most anything in between, and his grace was at a low ebb after the poison from the spear. And there was Dean, a persistent temptation.
Castiel squeezed his eyes closed, feeling things starting to pull back together from all the corners of the earth where he had spread himself. He fought against it, trying to push it back to the hives that he was watching across the world and into Teal where the daemon was perched on the top of the car. Even as he worked, he could hear his brother’s laughter and taste sulfur.
Mira dropped low, slinking past the foot of the bed and over towards the kitchenette and table. She flicked an ear over toward the sound of Dean’s chair creaking as he shifted.
Castiel flexed his hand, smiling as a bee climbed over it. He tipped his head, watching as the bee trundled to the end of a finger and took off, joining the others in their search.
Cas smiled at her before coming to stand just to the side. His gaze slid over them both before he turned his attention to the driveway to the bunker.
“Mira. Mira, please. We can’t. We need to-”
Mira shifted in Dean lap, an actual whine escaping her as she slipped down and caught herself on a bad paw. That had Teal whipping around, his voice dropping into a hiss. “
“No.” Dean shook his head. “No, you’re good. Just…” Dean cleared his throat, “don’t do that again.”
Dean curled his fingers into Mira’s fur one last time before stepping up to the van. He gave the raven a long look, finding himself looking for some sign of pain. He knew how to read Sabine and Gisila. Knowing what mood Adina had been in meant that he would be able to read his father’s mood faster.
Mira rested her chin against the van, peering at Teal from that angle. “So, you’re a shadow.”
It was strange seeing a familiar expression of displeasure on Teal’s face, even more so that a raven’s face wasn’t built like a human. And yet, the similarity was striking.
Teal dropped down, Mira reaching out to haul him close enough to press her nose into his feathers. She felt him jerk, but he didn’t try to break away, even though he could. He could have resisted her fumbling tug too, but he had moved for her. And that was nearly as heady as her and Dean’s shared pleasure.
“What?”
Castiel stroked a hand along the top of the box, looking up when he heard Rowena laugh. He met her gaze for a moment, seeing a flicker of understanding before she went back to baiting Dean, which he was grateful for. If he had to face Dean’s scorn or indifference while holding Jack’s remains he didn’t think he could remain detached. He might just give into the urge to break Dean’s jaw for once instead of allowing the annoyance to mellow.
“It is. But if I read another word I will stab something so, car it is.” Dean leaned in to stare down at the engine again. “Now move before you get knocked off.”
Dean planted his hand on the ground, forcing himself to his feet. He felt Mira knock up against his leg, curling around him before moving away. If that wasn’t a clear enough signal, the way Miracle whipped around to follow did. They flowed from a starling right into the fluffy white dog that Miracle preferred when they didn’t need to be flying around.
He reached back towards the wolf, his palm brushing over an ear before he found the top of her head. Dead sunk his fingers into her fur, hoping that it hid most of the shaking. The woman was too busy messing with the raven to pay attention, although her gaze dropped down to where Mira was by his side.
Rowena raised an eyebrow. “Don’t thank me. It’s a rare bit of sentiment, from one ally to another. Ruairí is my peace offering to keep angry Winchesters off of my back.”
Dean glanced over at Mira, just checking to see if she was still there. She was doing the same to him, her gazed fixed on him.
Mira took a few steps forward, shaking once again before giving him a miserable look. “I don’t think it’s all off.”
“I don’t have angel vision. I gotta see for myself.”
“Yes.”
He felt a spike of irritation, Castiel not needing to look over his shoulder to see Teal’s expression. The raven was probably glaring at him and, if he were closer, Teal would have been clacking his beak. He was probably doing it now, considering that Dean’s gaze darted over to them, which meant that Mira was reacting.
“And we’ll stop him, Dean.” Cas shrugged. “We’ve stopped everything else. The odds are in our favor in this.”
Mira shifted on the small bed on the floor. As always, the daemon bed that came with motel rooms were too damn small, too damn lumpy and too damn flat. The actual bed would be better, but Cas was there.
that. It wasn’t just the burning chill of an archangel curled around them, pressing them down until they couldn’t even scream. All of their old aches and pains were back, and the sun was shining down on them warm and bright.
Teal leaned forward to the point where he was nearly tumbling onto the bed, and wouldn’t that be interesting. Mira wagged her tail, ignoring the glance that Teal shot her way. “Something is wrong with Mira.”
It felt like his next breath caught, Dean having to swallow hard to work through it to get anything out. Because he had to know what this was, had to hear it said. “Why does this sound like a goodbye?”
Dean shuddered. He’d seen Sam’s summary of the world that the others had found themselves in, and there had been no Kelly input on that. But he’d seen her lists on “her” side of the map room. The two of them would have been thorough, probably too much so. “And they still went to do it?”
He was angry at –
While the other went to sleep
Once you set your mind on it
Dean must have dozed off because he didn’t remember how his head ended up between the car window and the headrest of the driver’s seat. He tried turning his head and instantly regretted the decision, as his neck gave off an unhealthy sounding
back, if possible –
The silence didn’t make it easier.
Somebody had sold their secret
It wasn’t perfect – the words were stumbling out of his mouth and he was nervous as hell, but Cas had given him an understanding smile. They didn’t talk about the confession itself. They didn’t talk about what it meant for them, for their relationship, but Dean felt like… he was getting there. Slowly, every day, a little closer. And it was the only thing Cas seemed to have endless patience for.
He gave Cas the picnic basket to carry and fetched some blankets and cushions from the trunk (it
Maybe he could ask Jack to help them? He wasn’t sure just exactly how “hands-off” Jack wanted to handle everything. Couldn’t hurt to try, though.
You think about life
. He was angry at himself for falling for Lucifer’s dirty phone prank, letting himself actually get his hopes up for a short moment; angry at himself for sitting on his ass the whole damn time and not even
Looking up again, Cas had opened his eyes and watched him under hooded lids.
Before Dean could restrain himself, he looked up at Cas – thank God, he was still wearing those boxer briefs. It didn’t stop Dean from letting his eyes wander for a moment, though, and he noticed that his dick was perking up with interest at the view.
And you are just a mere mortal
And oh, it was hell
He turned off the engine, rested his head against the steering wheel and stared down into his lap.
They never danced with each other
They stayed for a few more hours after, eating the rest of their provisions and drinking heated apple juice to warm up from the inside – when they had emptied that thermos as well, they decided it was time to go home. Dean had stopped feeling his feet some time ago already and he really needed to pee.
when Cas stretched over to the chair to grab a shirt. He was still getting used to the fact that Cas actually looked like any other human underneath his usual suit and trench coat combo – that there was so much skin Dean never had had the opportunity to appreciate before.
A love that was fueled by the desire of what they dreamed of so often
Right now, he was driving alone though, and the cassettes were not working. Even Baby’s noises seemed to be drowned out somewhat and all of it made Dean hella uncomfortable. He hated the silence. Hated being alone with his own thoughts. He couldn’t even take a quick sip of Jack to calm his nerves because he forgot his last bottle at the bunker.
So, what I’m asking you here is: Will you stay with me? Stay
Dean almost let out a barking laugh at that question. Of course he remembered the freaking mixtape.
“Cas, I-“ He started, and Cas watched him so intently that Dean struggled with the words for a moment. “I like being with you. What you said back then, before the Empty took you – it never left me. It gave me the grit to power through, to save you, to save whatever it is we had. You said you could never have me, told me that you-“
The words echoed through every corner of his mind as if it had only been moments since they were spoken. Dean could still see Cas standing in front of him, could see the expression of worry and happiness and fucking… fucking
was a big mistake, holy shit. Cas was half-hard.
Cas looked at him curiously for a moment, then nodded and disappeared to do as Dean asked.
But still could never reach
picnic,” Dean added and he could practically hear Cas’ subsequent head tilt.
That elicited a little moan from Cas, and the sound went straight into Dean’s lower belly. His hands slid down Cas’ sides, following the curve of his ass and to the front again where he rested the pads of his fingers against Cas’ hip bones. He felt Cas’ hips buck forward impatiently and when he broke their kiss for a moment and glanced down, Cas’ full erection was almost pressed against his own.
“So… This is a picnic?” Cas asked from where walked behind him.
“Yeah, what about it?”
,” he whispered.
He needed a few minutes to come down from the endorphin high, head pillowed on Cas’ left arm while his right-hand fingers ran over Dean’s clavicle and down his sternum. Dean lifted a heavy hand to cover his face – with the high of his orgasm fading, embarrassment began creeping into his mind. He couldn’t believe he had just let himself go like that.
Dean swallowed hard and closed his eyes.
,” he added, as he opened the door to get out of the car, leaving the comfortable heating behind.
Burning under its intensity
“Could be. But humans never do what we’re told. Just wait and see, it’s actually kinda fun.”
While Cas was drinking, Dean cut up the bread into thick slices and put some honey on each. When Cas noticed the honey in Dean’s hands, he made an honest-to-god gasping sound and Dean didn’t even have time to warn him about the honey dripping down from the slice before it was gone into Cas’ mouth. He hummed approvingly while chewing and gave Dean a very happy and confident grin with his mouth full. It was downright adorable.
Today was a special day. He had pondered long and hard about this, but he had decided, today was the day.
Dean rubbed his thumb against the side of his mouth. “Well, uh, just you and me. A small road trip, if you will.”
Cas’ voice.
“Not just any picnic. It’s a
They stopped at a gas station to empty their bladders and fill up the Impala’s tank. Just as Dean went inside to pay, he spotted a rack of hats and caps in the corner of the shop. A knit cap with yellow stripes and a big bobble that sat on top of the rack caught his eye, and with a smile on his face Dean took it with him to the checkout. Cas laughed when Dean showed him the cap, but he put it on his head and kept it there the whole drive home.
Now those feelings were back, a billion times stronger, and they were crushing him right where his heart should be. Dean wasn’t even sure if he still had one. Surely no human heart was made for the amount of pain, anger and despair he had gone through over the course of his life.
“It’s a surprise, actually. We’re going to drive for a while, so you can continue sleeping in the car, if you want.”
That they were star-crossed lovers
Dean tried very hard to dig in his lust-ridden brain for any knowledge on how to do this. He should probably do what he liked himself, right?
. It took a few minutes until he felt Cas’ hands warm up, but he didn’t want to let go yet.
Slowly, he started moving his fingers up and down, putting a little more pressure towards the tip – and Cas let out a moan that was so loud Dean was afraid even Sam would be able to hear it in his room. Cas’ brows were furrowed in concentration, eyes closed, as Dean continued stroking him, and his breath came out quicker and quicker.
Speaking of, Cas was already watching the picnic basket with hungry eyes, his stomach seemingly having finally woken up as well. But Dean handed out the coffee first, filling it into small metal cups he had packed for this occasion. Cas took his cup with a grateful smile on his face, eyes lit up when he took a small sip from the still steaming beverage.
to do research about the Empty, about finding any loophole or backdoor; angry at himself for not asking Jack if he could bring
“Yeah,” Dean nodded weakly. “And I know you’ve never planned on turning human again, that you’re a celestial creature made for a much, much bigger purpose – but you also told me that I changed you. That you learned to love the world because of, because of
Cas didn’t exactly know about this. Dean had dropped some hints at dinner last night that Cas shouldn’t make any plans for the day, but Cas still had his occasional troubles with subtextual communication. Becoming human had not really changed any of that – if anything, Cas just became more easily frustrated or angry with himself when it happened.
Of course Cas could have him. He already had Dean, for all he knew.
The bread was probably almost done baking by now - the air of the hallway leading down to the kitchen smelled like heaven. Dean put on the kitchen mitts again and carefully extracted the baked loaf from the oven, putting it down on a metal rack to cool down.
“Dean,” he spoke, and his voice was entirely serious now, “I have told you before, but I will tell you again now:
Dean was very aware that a car as old as this one wasn’t exactly a role model for ecological friendliness or noise protection. But the roaring of the engine, the shifting of sticks and turn signals, even the doors that never ceased to creak no matter how often he oiled them – all of these were the noises that grounded him, made him feel like he belonged. The road was his home, as was this car.
As though it reflects the shine of his very soul
(The answer was
Dean wiped his hands on the apron and pulled it off before setting off for Cas’ room.
High above the sky
He didn’t dare look at Cas at first, afraid of what he would see on his face. Afraid of what would show on his own. When he finally glanced to the side, Cas was watching him, occasionally glancing down on their joined hands. Dean felt a movement under his fingers – Cas had adjusted his position, so their hands now lay more comfortably against each other. Absent-mindedly and hyper-aware at the same time Dean started stroking Cas’ hand with his thumb,
It had been a little over a week since they defeated Chuck. A little over a week that Jack had absorbed Chuck’s powers, brought back the entire population with a single snap of his fingers and then went off to god-(Jack)-knows-where. A little over a week that Sam received word from Eileen – Dean would never forget the look of happiness and sheer relief on his brother’s face when he realized that Jack had brought her back, too. All of their friends, in fact.
Lost in thoughts and plans about research Dean got back into the Impala and started the engine. All of a sudden, the radio sprang to life, even though Dean clearly remembered turning it off earlier. The static noise gave way to a sort of squeaking sound, as if somebody played around with the frequencies or the radio signal. Dean tried turning it off – but nothing happened. Instead, the squeaking got louder and louder, until it was almost unbearable.
He still wasn’t able to even think of his name. Wasn’t able to process what the hell had happened that night. He had barely managed to tell Sam and Jack about the rough
“That sounds very good. I’ll be doing that as well.”
“Dean, I…” Cas hips bucked again, getting himself a little more fraction against Dean’s thigh this time, his gaze dark and heavy. “I want you to touch me.” There was a desperate edge in his voice and Dean had to swallow down hard before moving his hands towards Cas’ shaft, closing his fingers around it.
Didn’t help him to sleep at night, though.
The rush of adrenaline in his veins felt both breathtaking and intoxicating. Kissing Cas was like a heavy fog lifting around him for the first time, everything around him shining crystal clear in a new found sense of awareness. It felt like an epiphany, like being grounded on the earth while floating a few feet over it simultaneously. Every last space left in his brain was occupied with the sensation of Cas’ mouth against his, with the way their breaths mingled and the feeling of Cas’ cold tip of the nose pressed against his cheek.
. Dean’s gaze dipped down deeper for a moment, and
He felt his chest tighten, a very human reaction that he didn’t bother to stop. This wasn’t Jack, not really, and Miracle wasn’t there, but it was better than nothing.
Castiel intended to oversee the processes, because a good man had died today, a good hunter if what Mary had said about Wally was true. Castiel was inclined to believe that he was.
Mira leaned into his shoulder, her tail tucking just under his chin. Dean sputtered around it, finally just wrapping his hand around her tail loosely so it would stop getting his mouth. By the time it had it wrangled, Cas was giving him one of those looks that eased gently into fondness.
There wasn’t a breeze, so the windmill wasn’t turning. The whole meadow seemed to be frozen by the lack of wind, like it was holding its breath and waiting. Dean found himself waiting too, like something would happen just sitting in his car.
Thankfully, the raven took the chance to try and fly away again. The woman sputtered and turned away, stumbling as she tried to keep the bird in check. It was a brief reprieve, because Dean was sure that she would be back, and he wanted to be long gone by then.
He reached up to run the back of his hand along Teal’s wing as he turned back to Dean. “What about Sam and Mary?”
Dean grinned and dropped down to sit on the roof of the bunker. The concrete was warm underneath him, which was probably why Mira looked like she was trying to burrow into it herself. He really should have brought up a blanket so she didn’t scrape one side free of fur. He reached over to grab onto one of her paws, shaking it until she was playfully nipping towards his fingers.
“Comfortable?”
Dean licked his lips, casting his gaze to the ceiling. Thankfully, Mira answered for him. “Agathe is a girl, like Claire.”
“Cas.” He straightened automatically at the command, staring at Dean.
Castiel took a deep breath, clenching one hand into a fist. He remembered, it was something he tried not to think about because he could picture it all too clearly.
“Because you’re an angel, and you agreed to this.”
The Mark pulsed on his arm, reminding him of easier ways. He could simply kill them all, or allow himself to slip back to being a demon when all of that didn’t matter. Besides, Mira would have been able to haul them down to Hell with impunity. Crowley might have been annoyed, but there was very little he wouldn’t allow Dean to do.
Castiel swallowed. “I’ll try.”
Thankfully, Dean took the silence as an answer.
Dean’s fingers dug deep into the fur of her neck, pulling her close against his leg. Mira leaned in, pressing her face against his knee and thigh. She could feel Dean moving his fingers around the collar on her neck, doing the habitual check of the charms and sigils there. It finished with a tug, checking the fit and if anything was giving way, a last reassurance. And then, he started the process again.
It also gave him a look at Teal. His daemon had hopped down onto bumper, standing there as Mira nosed at him. A couple of feathers drifted lose, which made Mira look at them worriedly. But Teal had the same put upon expression, looking a moment from flying out and leaving him behind to deal with it.
Dean and Mira hadn’t noticed them just yet, so Castiel had a moment to just watch as they climbed up the short rise that led back to the road. Then Teal was pushing off from his knee and flying towards them.
Dean ruffled the top of her head as she went by, ignoring the playful snap at his hand. What was more telling was the amount of time that she spent pressed up against Dean before she sat imperiously by the passenger door. The worry was still there, bubbling and brewing on its way to an explosion. It would happen, Castiel knew Dean and Mira too well to think that it would disappear, but he could at least hold off the eruption by taking away some of the fuel.
There was a flutter of wings, Dean and Mira jumping back as Miracle appeared between Dean and Teal in the shape of a starling. The daemon darted over to Teal, knocking up against him. “Teal! They’re back!”
“Chained to our own comet.”
He curled his fingers towards his palm. “Teal.”
Castiel stared at them, concerned by how they had moved without their permission. It could be the exhaustion from Hell or from the rebuilding. He had singes to his grace that he hadn’t healed completely to save his efforts for the more important mission, but that wouldn’t explain their eagerness.
Teal adjusted his hold, more than happy to hang on. Mira’s fur was warm after spending so much time crouched on cold concrete. Beyond that, it felt like home, especially when Castiel was so far away on many levels.
He scratched Mira’s back, purposefully ignoring the way that it felt almost desperate. “Yeah?”
. Just…here, take him.”
“Teal,” Mira turned her head to look at him. “Did he hurt you?”
Dean didn’t seem to retain the same horror. He was frowning at Castiel, looking him up and down as his daemon continued to circle. “What broke it?”
Dean rapped on the hood of the car again, the tone of his voice giving away that this wasn’t even the second or third time he had called for him. “Cas.”
Dean fought against the urge to check the Mark under his hand. He was aware that the urge to kill was coming more often, but he hadn’t been keeping track of the time between them. Then again, he shouldn’t have been surprised that Cas had. He could probably tell the time in milliseconds from one breaking point to the next.
He twisted to look at Cas, rolling his eyes at the concern. “I’m fine.”
Castiel dutifully stripped out of his trenchcoat, surprised when Dean urged the suit jacket over his shoulders. Both were just tossed back in the direction of the Impala. , Castiel didn’t hear either of the daemons protest, but he wanted to check when Dean grabbed his chin, jerking his head until Castiel was facing forward again.
“Cas?” Teal burst from his side in a flurry of feathers. He made an aborted and jerky flight to the back of the chair where he perched, staring at the wall. Dean watched as the raven moved along the back of it, studying the wall like it would give up its secrets. “Mira? CAS?!”
That more than anything else got him moving forward, Dean shuffling on his knees to reach for her muzzle. He tried to draw it down, to clamp his fingers over it to smother the sound, but Mira kept leaning away.
He looked over at Cas, catching a glimpse of the angel looking over at him. It would be so easy to just hold that gaze and forget that Teal was moving, even though he could hear the scrape of Teal’s claws as he moved. He could even possibly ignore Mira, who he could feel creeping closer just like he could feel her emotions coiling tighter until they were twisting in his own stomach.
Then he was storming forward and reaching out like Teal wasn’t even on Castiel’s shoulder.
They would observe to see if their work was finished, and then they would contact the two of them to tell the Righteous Man of the glorious purpose of his mission.
The colors ran riot across the two of them, chasing back and forth as they lay in the sun. The Righteous Man kept moving his hand, scratching deep into the wolf’s fur. He kept repeating her name in a hoarse whisper, nuzzling his face into the top of hers.
