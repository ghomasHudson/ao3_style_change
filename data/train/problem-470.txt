— boring, impossible at precisely the moment it became compulsory — and to have John, who was more alert (had been awake for a long (uncertain) time, but had stayed in the disorderly, soon-to-be
Just as the teacher stopped and began to bark at one or the other of the duo, another teacher – a javelin thrower of a woman in a grey button-up with the same crest on the front as the man, carrying an oversized umbrella – interrupted him. A brief conference had the children tittering hopefully. The man nodded and, as the matriarch stomped away, blew his whistle. A few children cheered as they all followed off the grass.
He moved away and dried his own on a tea towel. (Him and Sherlock, forever: no sweet-and-awkward manoeuvring around the kitchen like, well, like couples did, at least in the early days of living together. No light hand on his stomach, the signal, claiming him, when they went out to parties and stood close. No dates at the cinema or the —)
‘’Nother pint, John? Sherlock?’ called Stamford’s wife, from closer to the bar. ‘I owe you one, don’t I.’
After several moments unspooled and slowly regathered them back to themselves, John breathed a sigh, nose skating against Sherlock’s jaw, and stood back. Somewhat expectedly, Sherlock was staring into the middle-distance, retreated into himself, as he did when he occasionally hit a threshold of new, especially emotional, data, and needed the space to work through it, classify and compartmentalize it, let it go, before he could return to the present.
‘Yes,’ trills Mycroft, in that same voice he used when Sherlock couldn’t pick up chemistry quick enough, or mixed up a word puzzle and spelled something incorrectly… ‘You always were so stupid. Such a disappointment.’
‘Get it,’ said John roughly, sounding drunk, ‘it’s probably Bradstreet or Lestrade at –’ he rolled to peer at his clock, ‘– half past ten at night.’
John ignored the hollow pang in his gut at this simple sentence and plastered his smile on his face. ‘He speaks some French, Latin, Greek, and, er, German as well.’ (He hoped his slight hiccup of laughter on that last feat wasn’t too obviously a joke.)
Sherlock didn’t move except to accept John’s mouth and touch, his stomach rising and falling around John’s fingers. When John waited for a more explicit invitation, Sherlock snorted in annoyance, though his voice was pitched so low John felt it sink into his bones. ‘If there were anything I didn’t want from you, John, you would know.’
As usual, Sherlock bolted almost before they had fully braked; as usual, John thumbed the requisite notes from his wallet, grunted some farewell, and followed. The door slammed shut, and he started. Watching the cab pull away, he had the sinking feeling that he had left something on the seat, or, a dreamier sensation, that he’d been missing something fundamental – his watch, perhaps, or his shirt – all day, and that Sherlock and Mr Ramani and the cabbie had all been too distracted or too kind to say anything.
‘See you later!’ Ovid chimed, and Baker, starting with shock (if the man made it home with his bird, his wallet, and his head on straight, John would be
Having deduced a great deal about the man from his writing style and chosen subject, the question remained: how could such a sleek cat as Baron Heinrich Gruener be exposed for the brutal criminal he was?
At which point he had arrived at the Second Hurdle: why bother. Sherlock was not naturally self-pitying. Nevertheless, particularly during and since his absence, he was forced to admit (even if just to himself) that he presented virtually
mind the cufflinks in the next ten seconds, or I’m sorting them whatever way I bloody well like,’ he retorted hoarsely, shoving his knee higher between Sherlock’s legs, to make his point. Sherlock’s almost imperceptible whine was perfect.
‘Ah!’ Mrs. Hudson cried suddenly, ‘my cinnamon buns!’ And she dashed off, no doubt – judging from the clatter a moment later of baking tins and her frustrated moan – to attempt to salvage another very ‘well-done’ baking foray.
Mycroft was poised there in the self-important patient way he did, but John didn’t fancy an edgy smirking/staring contest, so he decided to delegate a few tasks that Big Brother could handle for him.
‘It’s a good thing we weren’t doing this when you were wearing only a sheet around Buckingham Palace,’ John persisted, voice spring-tight, knowing Sherlock would focus in on this train of thought rather than allow his restless
‘Turned out,’ Molly continued, a knowing smile in her voice, ‘it was a birthmark. His wife had to identify it.’
‘Oh, don’t worry! It’ll be a help just to tell some of the others you might be there — give a little star-power to the team!’
Bad dreams of Mary, of drinking himself stupid in that awful bedsit, of Chinese pottery and girls kept in badly-lit backrooms being harmed in ways his psyche refused, self-protectively, to represent fully, bit at the edges of his sleep all night, chasing him, until he woke with a start Wednesday morning in a bed smelling of both of them, alone.
, not the nurse she had posed as, not a – not anything like the bundle of drives and codes that made up and had attracted her to John. (For christ’s sake, Mycroft was going to get an absolute EARFUL when they got out of this.)
Eventually Sherlock, almost crossly, growled, ‘Come on, kiss me, you want to and you’ve been wanting to for
(Sounded cliché, despite being completely true. But he deleted that too, lest Sherlock get all bent out of shape again over being called out for being a sexually-active adult.)
(The problem was, his deductive faculty insisted, that Gruener had built a near-seamless sham in his outward mask as ‘gentleman collector’, one which enabled him to drag Violet subtly under his power with pitiable excuses for his past. The Austrian had — Sherlock knew without having to hear confirmation from John — preyed upon Violet’s natural coldness, her vanity and privilege, her addictive nature, her isolation… Nor was he, Sherlock, unaware of the irony threaded through Violet’s story — how could he be, he was socially impaired, not stupid. And Gruener, dark, cunning, arrogant, provided the rest of the mirror image: it was as though Irene (not
There was no clear grammatical way to refute what John said whilst reasserting Sherlock’s statement, but nor was there any plausibility to blaming the thudding in his chest on his recent cardiac history.
‘She’s a PR consultant, of course she was lying,’ Sherlock reeled. ‘The question is, about whom, and
‘We’ll keep you informed,’ Sherlock told her, before turning towards his desk and beginning to type dramatically on his laptop.
socks,’ Sherlock amended. He emphasised the point by beginning, with toes dexterous in a way John was too knackered to think about much just now but swore inwardly to investigate tomorrow (today, whatever), to push them off without using his hands, scraping the sides of John’s ankles until it tickled too much to continue –
For today, John resettled into the present, where he was — somewhat improbably — perched, half-sitting half-lying, just over Sherlock’s bare arse, suddenly aware that they hadn’t discussed histories about this particular — or, come to think of it, any relevant specifics. (He knew, from snatched hints and blurted admissions, that Sherlock had indeed had sex before they’d taken up, which squared with John’s twin assumptions that, 1) Sherlock was fundamentally curious, particularly when it came to anything sensory; 2) Sherlock had been reckless as a young man, and not just about the cocaine.) But, if he knew one thing for certain about Sherlock, it was that his mind — entirely contrary to the face he showed the world — was very easily overwhelmed: with data, with sentiment, with sensation. And just to make things really helpful, such inundations usually came over Sherlock in unpredictable moments.
Soon they were both half-tangled together again, hips pressed together and mouths and hands and scattered fiery neurons just this side of buzzing-stinging-numb. He nudged his nose into Sherlock’s and licked his own lips.
Sherlock’s eyes were attempting to deduce the package now taunting him from the kitchen table, but he answered, ‘Yes.’
By the time he crawled off, Sherlock’s mouth was newly flushed, and John’s eyes had just about readjusted to the darkness.
of food on a base, at least you knew… He smirked at his own rosy-tinted glasses. No — things were just as liable to hold-ups over stupid human error there as here. There just tended to be more laughs over lunch. (Well, that, or iron-barred silences.)
, something worse than all the horrible things they’d been bandying back and forth these last few minutes…
John considered this, then went to the exterior window, followed by the floor-length glass barrier to the corridor, and the door, shutting all the blinds and closing them off, before hitting the light switch.
‘He didn’t see me at the opera,’ Sherlock pointed out. ‘And you know I can’t get the same amount of data sending you or, heaven forbid,
The knock on the door followed by the entry of one of the temps who handed him a patient intake form, ‘Mr. Summerson,’ then in a low, dramatically disgusted hiss, ‘
John — John is right here! He puts out a hand to find the hem of John’s coat like a rope for a drowning man — but isn’t there.
As usual, his body did precisely the opposite of what he craved: somnambulantly carrying him to the uncharacteristically regulation-tidy bed (he ground his teeth), throwing him down upon it so that his whole vision was taken up with Poe’s sunken, peculiar face. He too contemplated murder.
He pulled the car into gear again and followed the directions given them at the gate to one of the two forks in the path as it curved away from the house – no doubt to preserve the view and the grounds, as they backed up to the park (Gruener was, after all, entirely consumed by his efforts to present a beautiful, established, unassailable façade).
Just at that moment, thankfully, Sherlock re-joined the world of the waking, and the glaring question on Molly’s face subsided, like so many things, in the whirlwind of Sherlock’s presence.
‘Three weeks!’ Sherlock burst in, because good lord, was this Mycroft’s idea of an insulting practical joke? ‘My cases frequently take a matter of hours, Sir James, not the better part of a month. It’s not as though he’s difficult to find: his home address was listed in the Sunday Telegraph, for god’s sake! Whatever incompetent —’
Pete Watson lay in bed, face ashen apart from his yellow, sunken eyes, belly distended under John’s grandmother’s quilt. A nurse was seated beside him when John shook himself off the doorframe.
Miss Winter had usefully corroborated the information Sherlock had acquired from the homeless network: the ‘records’, or ‘accounts’, or ledger, or book (terms suggestive but none definitive) was indeed in hard-copy, a physical — and therefore eradicable — object. During his long rumination on the problem, he had determined that:
John laughed openly. ‘God, I feel so old, when people say stuff like that. I mean, it’s fine — as long as they know what they’re talking about, it’s none of my business. But I just keep thinking, my sister being gay was the biggest shock for the family in… I dunno, decades. And that was the only kind of “alternative lifestyle” anybody seemed to know about then, really. Definitely for my parents.’
‘That was a bit hasty,’ Bradstreet conceded, glance pointedly flicking sideways to Peterson before returning. ‘In all the palaver last night… But it’s a police matter, and, of course, even with the private licensing laws…’ He coughed slightly as if to clear his throat. ‘And, I might say, it’s open and shut. Motive and opportunity. Would hardly be worth it for you. We’ll find the jewel once we get it all out of him, mark my words.’
Eyes closed, Sherlock dug desperately through the dishevelled mess in his Mind Palace foyer, papers and mental images and soundbites from that day, all strewn about, sodden wet, as though a pipe had burst and torn through flooring and walls alike, mixing files and even furniture that were supposed to remain separate.
a complete surprise, so I just… I dunno. Tried to throw you off the scent.’ He scrutinised Sherlock again. 'I am pretty damn smart when I need to be.'
‘How I knew that one of Gruener’s lackeys by her smile.’ Then he added, eye still boring into the side of John’s skull, ‘Even had I not recognised her face, however, she went to the very useful smokescreen of wearing women’s perfume to catch me off-guard when she stabbed me.’
*Updates for the next two weeks will be suspended while the world, possibly, ends. Between Sunday's ep, next Friday's American end-of-days inauguration of evil, and my enormously important phd exam the Wednesday after that, I really cannot spend as much time as I love to do on getting the last few chapters into suitable shape for posting. But I swear, once we get past those few milestones, up the chapters shall go!*
Before he could stop himself, Sherlock had tidied away the ingredients and stealthily slipped up the stairs just as the hot water clunked off.
For a tense moment, Sherlock stood, awaiting John’s reaching fingers on his jacket, his lower back, his jaw: but when none of the usual touches came, he rapidly reassessed: ah. He took a step forward, then (when John smirked even more, settling into his stance leaning against the countertop) another. Hovering over John, he wondered if they had enough time for any of the three or four scenarios gliding like film strips across John’s glinting eyes.
At some point, Kate (whose name John had helpfully supplied) returned with their drinks, then scooted gamely into the bench, taking with her the irksome football fanatic, the nurse, and the technician, who all clustered into the 90* angle of the bench and made swift work of an asinine, prurient game involving other people in sight.
‘Very good parrot,’ approved John, giving him several seeds at once. ‘Ovid here seems to agree with me that the textbook lesson is a bit dry.’
The door downstairs clicked, sighed, thudded shut. Less than an hour since Sherlock had left the event. Reasonably frequent trains (operating with good service on all late-running lines); uninterrupted walk from the station homewards. Heralded by familiar sounds and calculations (the
: Possibly Gruener wore the records on/in his handkerchief, or even somehow on/in his skin, in such a way that it was imperceptible without a visual device or instrument? Again, his fine-wire spectacles or some sort of infra-red scanner came to mind…
Sherlock was watching him, still a bit crushed at the top of the landing. Quitting while one was ahead was only a successful strategy if one was planning to call things to a halt. Otherwise it didn’t quite count as ‘quitting’, only waiting before the action. Like the music at the beginning of the opera — an escalating race involving all the instruments bellowing at full volume, with occasional quieter solos. The whole orchestra, just going for it.
, John,’ Sherlock muttered, amused, but his hands were swiftly removing John’s shirt and belt and trousers,
‘Hello! Hello!’ Ovid replied cordially, bobbing up and down and shuffling along his wooden perch. ‘I love you.’
‘I never turn down a cuppa,’ he tried amiably, feeling the rougher edges of his accent come out in spite of himself. He watched her move about the kitchen, aware just how out of place he was among the sleek modern finishings and distinct lack of family photos, dirty dishes, or personal touches of any kind. Even her keys on the ring by the door glittered like something from an interiors magazine that people flipped through wistfully at the clinic. ‘Just milk for me. Ta.’
‘Take her out,’ Sherlock suggested. ‘And go on.’ (He was in no hurry to be alone with John, who was evidently trying to find a gentle way to confront Sherlock about the previous night’s turn of events; nor had he yet figured out how Ryder, who Catherine Cusack thought ‘too awkward and too dull’ to have stolen the jewel, had indeed done just that.)
She gushed with cool laughter at that. ‘And so I shouldn’t be surprised not to see a ring on your finger.’
He went, unhurried, through his evening routine (it felt much later, the drag of his eyelids protesting as though it was 4am and not quarter-to-midnight, not least for the muscle-memory of the post-case replacement of his gun from his jacket pocket to the bedside drawer).
Before he could quite prevent himself, he had buried his nose in the space between John’s ear and shoulder, squeezing himself into the unrealistic sliver at John’s side, squished on either side into the sofa or John’s neck. John shuffled obligingly, planting his outside foot on the carpet, wedging a warm arm to hold him (limited mobility (probably already losing circulation) notwithstanding) away from the sweat-adhesive leather, stroking
.) She smiled at him brightly, chin on one spindly hand, eyes even wider than Sherlock’s. She wasn’t trying to flirt with him, not with any real aim in mind, but she gave every impression of the kind of silver spoon young woman who flirted by default and took advantage of most people fawning at the attention.
to happen again, do you hear me, Sherlock?’) to Bill Murray, who, it transpired, proved the most helpful of the lot. Thus, Sherlock and John found themselves on a rocky outcropping, shrouded in fog, very nearly freezing, looking out over the variegated, somewhat frozen moor of the Isle of…  well, whichever Inner or Outer Hebridean one Bill lived on for half the year.
(Their whole evening, his hindbrain reminded him, had included the ridges of Sherlock’s fingerpads teasing behind his ear… –
‘I’m fine,’ he protested, even managing to make it sound light. ‘They’ve found me a spare roll-away bed: living in the lap of luxury here.’ But she clearly wasn’t about to budge without a better reason. He lowered his voice. ‘I just… I have to stay to make sure he doesn’t trick one of the interns into giving him the good stuff.’
Sherlock continued to circumnavigate the grounds while the chat continued inside, constructing a mental map of the blindspots of the CCTV, normalising his presence to the guard who was bored of keeping an eye on the supposedly equally bored driver of the Baron’s latest guests.
‘How do you — no, never mind that.’ John sat forward in his chair, daring Sherlock to stare back at him as he himself unravelled Sherlock’s words. ‘But “if she were” — hang on, she’s not reachable but your brother’s involved? What, did he need a nurse for a black-ops mission to Eastern Europe or something?’
John is, perhaps obviously, slightly misremembering the breathtaking 1917 Wallace Stevens poem, 'Gray Room' (
Sherlock searched his face for a moment, then seemed to collect himself. ‘Probably not. I should look into Gruener’s finances, and Mycroft will probably have sent me CCTV of where Gruener went after the performance.’
Well. In fact, she’d managed a fairly enormous one, hadn’t she? Perhaps, he went on inwardly, getting to his feet on the pretence of hunting for his wallet, it explained something towards John’s reluctance to spending much time with Molly lately. It was hard to put it out of his mind, especially now, with the margins of his thoughts taken up with dosages and listening for changes in Sherlock’s breathing. Not red alert, not by a long chalk, but nowhere near situation normal.
Through the ear-splitting din, with a thick, painful scrape of skin, hair, and gummy adhesive, Sherlock ruthlessly peeled away the towel and – John, unthinking, stepped forward to stop him, but he was too late, too shocked – Boone’s face with it.
He whirled on his heel, leaving John to stare angrily at the police officers for an extra second. ‘No hard feelings,’ Peterson chimed, with a malicious smile, and John was tempted to remind her that he too had a criminal record. Instead he shook his head and followed Sherlock out.
‘Of course, madam,’ said the boy-007, disappearing, and John really, really wished he could start this whole episode over, from the morning, or earlier, any way so he wouldn’t end up late and just about hating his sister while ogling the probably teenaged male
. Except Sherlock’s mood hadn’t radiated disappointment—his closed-off eyes and small, downturned mouth, even his tired shoulders and leaden step, pointed away from that scenario.
Except this year he’d have a date with said ‘particular person’, rather than with a bottle of bad scotch on his lino floor. A date, this time, who might actually prefer the homeless shelter to the warmer, swankier scene of the banquet, because he was mad and John was out of his mind with love for him.
‘Er,’ said John. When had he stopped listening to music during cases? He loved music, though his eclectic lack of pickiness had set Sherlock off more times than John liked to recall. Cooking, tidying, or just sitting around reading or blogging between cases, yeah, a bit of Thelonious Monk, Bowie, Adam and the Ants, (on a really nostalgic day) Bananarama, even once in a while — with the silver lining that it’d please Sherlock — some Beethoven. But the problem was, of course, that it so often
‘Molly, isn’t it?’ Mary went on blithely, evidently in no hurry. ‘I’m surprised to see you here as John’s beard. On top of… Seriously, John, did you really expect anyone to buy the moustache?’ The way her tone curved into familiarity when addressing him – Sherlock wanted to tear the sound to
Sitting at his desk, he found himself doodling on his prescription pad between patients, thinking about Sherlock’s slip — ‘soldier’ for ‘sailor’ — and whether, in fact, there might be an opportunity once this case was finished to dig out his uniform. He could easily imagine it: Sherlock’s eyes gone round as dishplates, John commanding him to splay across the bed and get himself ready with a ‘yes sir’ or else receive due punishment (the exact nature of which they’d have to agree upon, but John was, er, up for anything).
, Sherlock, you did. I don’t care about the semantics of it. You kept me in the dark, again. After you promised not
Sherlock loves him desperately — wants to reach him (the road, his un-shocked mind supplies: he must reach the road if he wants to be found) before the roll of the flood overhead swept him downriver, underwater, flooding his lungs, choked —
‘Mr. Holmes,’ Damery acknowledged gravely, in the unmistakable marble-mouthed rumble of most British peers over the age of 60. ‘And Dr. Watson. How do you do.’
‘. Meanwhile, when Gruener moved on to the quiz portion of their meeting, John chimed in gruffly with his (poorly disguised disgust-filled) answers to who had sold various (fictitious) works in ‘Dr Barton’ (that was, Molly’s) (fictitious) collection.
(Clothes were nonsensical attempts at self-fashioning intended to fool the minds of others, which was of course patently
He took the envelope and pocketed it wordlessly, then stood, fighting the surreal, ingrained urge to bow. Lady Morcar rose too, and followed him to the door.
‘I’d shut up if I were you,’ John’s steady tone warned, with more composure, ‘because if I’m honest, I am seriously tempted to let her shoot you.’
He admired her choice of words, but merely nodded. ‘Second, it’s not been in anything like his wallet, his diary, his… anything, any of the things they could get off him —’
With a shuffle of shoes on the carpet, Ryder stood, then, apparently deciding John wasn’t about to throttle him or throw him to the floor, practically ran out the door and was swallowed up by the rain.
And with that, and an involuntary (unconscious) sigh, John’s lopsided grin disappeared out of the flat.
‘I DON’T WORK FOR THE POLICE!’ Sherlock heard himself shout, voice reverberating on the glass and porcelain and tile of the kitchen,
‘That’s true,’ John went on, lowering his voice to an undertone, managing to keep the invitation on his face as Sherlock bent close over him. ‘Although. You were impressively patient with Colonel Toffeemouth earlier, even though his case ranks at about a two. That’s pushing “nice”, if you ask me. Best be careful.’
‘HA!’ she half-shrieked, and an older woman at the table next to them glared. No wonder their waiter had disappeared. ‘I texted! I phoned! Just because your cocky soldier ego wouldn’t let you ask for help doesn’t mean I didn’t offer! And
‘Stuff it, Johnny,’ she cut across, and her smile and eyes seemed to sparkled with jesting, but her jaw sawed back and forth with its false grin. ‘Just… For fuck’s sake, we haven’t even ordered.’
‘Apart from the massive hole in his chest,’ John snapped, index finger gesturing helpfully towards the very puncture.
He looked instead at her manicured hands, her bag-drawn eyes, her flashy clothing, what he could see of her knee, bouncing distractedly, reflected in the wall-sized, downward-angled Art Deco mirror behind her. (
(In his semi-lucid state, he’d aired theories for several (admittedly unappealing) scenarios to explain the as-yet still-tangled enigma of Gruener’s ‘book’. Perhaps he had a confidant (either a PA or, in an extreme case, Violet De Merville herself — who was party to the Baron’s episodes but willing, for one reason or another, to cover his tracks); or possibly Gruener was projecting or otherwise exposing his ‘book’ to light on a circumstantial basis, which left the problem of catching him in the act…
him even with this gap between them: tense; anticipatory. But Sherlock could not stop himself from correcting the vow. ‘I promise to try.’
He was disgusting and adorable and brilliant and John refused to notice any of it with more than an absent, ‘Is she?’ turning to the back pages of national news. Some rapper with a ‘Z’ at the end of his name had assaulted a woman at a club; people were sitting for record long times in A&E waiting rooms (he knew that too well, as well as what the article failed to mention about under-staffed surgeries and junior doctors’ salaries); politics was getting in the way of humanitarian aid workers reaching refugees; and more on bloody Brexit… All depressingly repetitive.
‘Thanks,’ John interrupted, backing off a step as if scalded and with the same force, switching off the lights that had reflexively come on when they’d made eye contact, ‘thanks a lot.’ He held out the stain-remover pen. ‘Sorry you, er — you lost your spot in the queue.’
But today, here was John, sitting and trying not to lash out at his patient from the niggling feeling that he
John’s eyes fluttered in gratitude, but he still (uncharacteristically) struggled to speak, looking now at his hands.
. In the dark, at this angle, he couldn’t quite make any one of them out. John knew, as he had know for a long time, that Sherlock had an armoire with a long mirror near his bed, but he’d only recently discovered that, from any given point on the bed, you couldn’t see yourself in it. It was also a surprising distance between where John was situated and the door, a gap which made him distinctly uncomfortable. (In his (old?) room upstairs, he’d made sure on the first day he’d moved in to have clear sight-lines and only a split-second’s divide between himself and a potential intruder. That evening, Sherlock had glanced at him all over, rolled his eyes smugly, and gone back to roasting plastic.) He wondered at what point it would be acceptable to bring up rearranging the furniture, and what that conversation would look like.
– he risked the miniscule sound of one metal (bronze) abrading metal (stainless steel) to grab what looked like a jewel-encrusted sword, complete with (hence it keeping company among Gruener’s things) pornographic illustrations dimly perceptible along the hilt –
The woman, in multi-coloured lycra leggings (thirty-one or -two, Iberian ancestry, avid social media user, regular runner but also today exercising away a hangover from a work-do with several closer-than-colleagues that she preferred not think about now, bisexual) had given them a wide and good-natured smile, and then looked to John, as everyone did.
Series 3 had more almost-Sherlock/John moments than I even believed. And so here they are, in my alternate reflecting pool of a universe, as they ought to have been.
In other words, John’s proposition was entirely consistent with their praxis. Nevertheless the tone in which he uttered it, the precise syntax… Something was slightly off. Health? No; family: no; work (cases, clinic, patients, medical… requirements [John wasn’t going away? Sherlock was relatively certain he would have committed that to memory by sulking, much though he would deny the label]: so, no.) Hm. That left only a few likely areas, namely…
(a marvel of secrecy he had not credited them with being able to maintain). It had ended in a flying manhunt down the Thames, culminating Sherlock commandeering a vessel, upon which two bearded sailors had, recognising him, asked, ‘Arren’ you Sherlough Holmes, the detective?’ To which he had, even with the adrenalin and beer rioting in his brain, had the elated wherewithal to reply, ‘No: the pirate.’ It had been, quite possibly, the best night of his life.)
After a moment, John bowed the crown of his head (Sherlock scrutinized the difference between the fair blond strands in the light at the top of his head versus the earthly brown (or so it appeared in the shadows on either side).) Then John exhaled again. ‘I think — I need you to promise.’
I grimaced uncomfortably. ‘No! Good God, Holmes, I said nothing of either passions or such excitement! It was you who —’
John did smile this time. (Primates and many mammals interpret the upturn of the mouth and particularly the baring of teeth as a sign of aggression, a warning signal, for precisely this sort of smile.)
‘Oh,’ Molly said, after something like a century of strained silence. ‘All right, well, that’s — I brought my nightie — sorry, yes, okay, never mind, that’s not important. Okay…’ She stood, scrambling now a little awkwardly, and John didn’t know if it was at the fact that she’d informed them that she slept in what a normal bloke might fantasize as a slinky sheer gown, or because she working out how to stuff the scarf-matching socks she’d worn into her ears to avoid the deafening sex that apparently rocked 221b seven times a night. (Hardly.) ‘Goodnight, then!’
When he dropped back beside John, the Baron’s fingers were shaking minutely mere inches away from his ruined, once-elegant upturned face. Another smell he would sooner never taste again: the scent-flavour of flayed, iron-drenched skin.
A familiar ripple of scepticism crossed Sherlock’s face, softened by an unfamiliar gentleness. ‘Unless I was going to stand
The light went off and a minute later he could just hear the pat of bare feet into the kitchen. So Day One of the Rest of His Life did, as it happened, include a woman. And Sherlock. Somehow, he wasn’t even surprised. Sighing, he shut his eyes and held on, indulging for the smallest moment in the floating, dreamy sensation that the world beyond what he could feel right here, right now, didn’t exist.
‘Always that damn ear-hat.’ He squinted, gingerly bringing the page right to the end of his nose. ‘Maybe it’s miniaturised newsprint that he shrinks down…’
In the kitchen, the fluorescent light shone harshly from beneath the cupboards so he didn’t bother to switch on the overhead. As he grabbed his army mug from the drying board, his hand grazed one of Sherlock’s test tubes, which for one heart-stopping second teetered on its head. His throat clogged. He forced himself to exhale through his nose until the kettle clicked off several minutes later.
He stopped, silent. His gaze snagged momentarily on John, who was rubbing his hands along his thighs in a completely distracting manner, before he got up and moved to the kitchen and took down three mugs. (Sherlock couldn’t

beguiled, as it were, due to the right combination of Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response and, of course, a willing mind.
. Nevertheless I confess to you, I,’ (Damery’s brow knitted, and he looked as though (had he been a man less in control of himself) he would have wrung his hands) ‘I fear our impending crisis is not to be prevented. In three weeks, a young woman’s future —‘
Sherlock’s eyes swept the room, floor to ceiling, before he nodded noncommittally. A faint pull of muscle tugged his lips, and John had to hold back a sigh of relief. He had it.
For all that he seemed like the fantasy-come-true of some middle-aged, sleepy woman from the Cotswolds, Captain John Watson, MD, was a protector, a rage-prone guard with little stomach for liars, cheaters, traitors, or fools. If ever Sherlock had doubted this, John had reminded him today.
. Maybe eventually they could discuss — or, realistically speaking, he could mull over and then wait to see how long it took for Sherlock to notice — whether he might want to cut back his hours. The cases brought in more money, anyway.
Mrs. Hudson laughed again and looked at John with indulgent disbelief, then back at Sherlock. ‘Your mother has a lot to answer for.’
, the difference on his fingers (or mouth, or eyelashes) of the pungent dripping mess that could coat your hand
So: it wasn’t that the little moments were unromantic. Little moments of comfort and affection were all too easy between them. Always had been. But this morning John hadn’t kissed Sherlock goodbye, hadn’t even thought about it until he was taking his jacket off at the surgery and spotted one of the nurses who occasionally flirted with him. He and Sherlock had been in some warped version of a relationship for years. He just wasn’t used to thinking of it like any other relationship he’d had.
(how he hated the drain of his body, the way it congealed the brainwork – but this bone-deep weariness felt worse than mere tiredness, felt colder, shivering like the come-down of a twisted, bottomless hit from which he dreaded to try to climb). (Mitigated, at least, by the scant pleasure of explaining the blatantly obvious as if his brother were an utter simpleton.) (The schedule for pain medications meant he was long overdue, but he would gladly suffer further if it meant John’s expression would soften and he would
6) No idea I went with the poorly-summarized film they're watching at the end. Seemed like something they would both put up with for at least five minutes. (For each other.)
John instantly came there, setting the pitcher down on his chair (he would likely sit on it later and then be annoyed with himself for forgetting) as he strode briskly forward, smile warping his face into a mash of emotions that was nearly ugly but was so, so dear that Sherlock wondered if people spoke of having their hearts broken with joy. Mind flooding with relief, his arms (pain be damned) tilted up to take hold of John’s elbows — they hadn’t kissed, hadn’t embraced, had barely
She pursed her lips into the sort of tight mousy line it often made when Sherlock was pressing her to do something.
‘It’s… it’s early days, Haz,’ he deferred. ‘But the second it’s wrapped up, I’ll send you my draft. First peek. Promise.’
‘There’re always two of us,’ John grins, eyes not leaving Sherlock’s, present like the weight of his head on the pillow next to him. ‘Don’t you read the blog?’
Something in the way she said it made him wonder if she really thought Sherlock was upset with her, if when John hadn’t been around to be the buffer Sherlock’d snapped at her for ‘thinking too loudly’ or for sharing an interesting piece of information with an acidic, ‘No, no,
In an instant they were both scrambling, a tangle of legs, as John was pressed back into his pillows, Sherlock ruthlessly tearing away his robe and shoving it to one side so he could run his palms maddeningly up John’s thighs to curl just above where his own knees were now straddling John’s hipbones, while John kissed and kissed and kissed him as deeply as he could possibly manage while he tried to pull Sherlock out of his clothes.
in order to get the important, the very very important information Greg was telling him through the cacophonous drowning of his dread.
He waited until the insurance bloke had left the room before considering it seriously. But… well, in Sherlock’s head (as best John could tell, anyway), disguises were part of the mysterious fun side of the casework. Sherlock hadn’t — John shifted in his seat — he hadn’t
Every so often, John chuckled at the screen, evidently settled in but still very much awake, already somehow engrossed in a programme he must have seen before.
As usual, no one could match the high bar set by a certain otherwise-occupied doctor/soldier who was probably being fleeced for cash by his sole, selfish sibling.
‘Yes, John, you know the type: blonde hair and kevlar body suit and a silencer even you would envy.’
,’ Sherlock fumed, making sure to whisk the belt of the (burgundy) dressing gown behind him as he strode over to the window and picked up his violin.
She smiled kindly at him, eyes crinkling in half-moons. ‘John, I may not be in my youth, dear, but I don’t plan on staying in bed because of every tiny cough or ache, or I’d never get out of it!’
With a begrudging sigh, John levelled his direct gaze at him. ‘What happened last night: more than a bit not good.’
‘Of course, Dr Watson,’ Mycroft placated, and he looked like he so often did: crooning with the impression of rolling his eyes just beneath the surface. Smarmy goliath.
‘Holmes,’ greeted Maureen, abandoning carelessly whatever they had been discussing; her companion similarly dropped her unfinished, almost certainly aimless thought to stare at him.
Once, just after Baskerville, Sherlock had almost involuntarily found himself standing in just the same spot, watching John thrash and hyperventilate and howl in his dreams. Paralysed, Sherlock had tried to recall what he had read since signing the lease on the subject of sleep disorder anxiety episodes, but had found himself unable to make the requisite motions from doorway to bedside. Pillows and sheets had been shoved at odd angles. The mattress had groaned slightly as John had dug his heels physically (and no doubt metaphorically) in. But still he had continued unconscious. Then suddenly, John’s mouth had formed a single articulate word, ‘
) days in the hospital had nearly rotted his brains until they dribbled like putrefied bile from his ears.
Sherlock piped up, though he retained his theatrical poise in his armchair. ‘Mr. Baker, as I’m sure John told you, we were unfortunate enough as to acquire and then send on your first bird to another home. But I hope this parrot – whom we have called Ovid, though of course, you are entitled to address him however you like – will be satisfactory? He knows most of the same phrases and seems, from our brief acquaintance, a quick study.’
At any other lunch, this might have been a lifeline, something to cling to. Because yeah, if he was honest with himself, he
In other news: sorry this chapter is nearly late. It's another one that's been mostly written in this form since the beginning. But I had jury service today (during which, among other stray thoughts, it occurred to me that Mycroft would consider it the HEIGHT of
John waited in the aisle of goods as Sherlock inspected first the pile of rags in a far corner basket, then the many-times stained floor, then finally the splatter (John’s jaw tensed at the sight) of copper-brown dots on and below the windowsill. The makeshift antechamber (John guessed, if the black binder on the horizontal crate constituted files and a desk, it was an ‘office’) seemed, to his eye, effectively empty.
Still wearing her teenagerish scarf, Molly bit her lip and visibly swallowed. ‘Right. Well. I suppose I’d better…’ She turned her gaze to the mountain of books and papers currently stacked on the partners’ desk. ‘Dive right in?’
on John’s face entered with him. As though at any given moment, he could feel the thrill of John’s confidence, his stability, like a reassuring hand at the small of his back, or a huff of a shared joke across a crime scene. Once, with Alec certainly, with Victor less consciously, the notion of a perpetual sensation of someone else’s hand touching him, prodding him, invading not only his physical but also (more importantly) his mental space, would have made him scream, shudder, shut down. Dive for cover (or cocaine). Now, like a revolution, like nearly everything John brought into his life, this inexplicable difference was simply a fact, not something to resolve or deconstruct, but simply acknowledge.
piss”?’ Sherlock demanded, because short of a doping scandal or an experiment on physiological response to various stimuli, the idiom was yet another turn of phrase that everyone used and yet no one bothered to wonder the meaning of.
Sherlock really didn’t make it easy, though. Didn’t relax, or let himself be at a disadvantage… well, pretty much ever. But today, at least, with the memory of Sherlock’s contented, slightly overwhelmed
He shook his head, frustrated, but it was damn obvious that he wasn’t going to convince her in one go. Gruener really had done a runner on her. ‘Just —’
, and you expected the police to simply throw up their hands in despair? Even I don’t believe the Yard are that witless.’
Pivoting into the room like a man whose knees were splinted into leg-length plaster casts, Baker regarded them both sheepishly. His wig-like ginger-blond hair was untidy in every direction, while his well-worn jacket sleeves were dappled with mends and almost transparent threadbare patches. He was about six foot tall but seemed, with his elbows and nose and feet and ears all protruding knobbily, at least eight, like a Punch puppet on stilts. He seemed as surprised to be standing in their living room as John wasn’t to remember he had run from someone as unintimidating as Sgt. Challa.
‘Yeah, I’m on it, Sherlock, give us a second, all right.’ He toed off his socks first, then, since his actual pyjamas were all upstairs, stole a pair of flannel tartan bottoms from the familiar stack of folded laundry on Sherlock’s dresser (more evidence of Mrs Hudson’s magic behind the scenes while they’d been gone), and curled up on his side of the bed. All the while, the prickle on the back of his neck and the still-lurking shadow informed that Sherlock, fully dressed, hadn’t left the room.
Standing by the shut door, he meant to say, ‘We can either talk about this now, or we can talk about it later, but we
‘No,’ John pointedly stated, in an undertone, putting a hand to the base of Sherlock’s neck and sliding up into the soft curls over his ear. ‘Our bedroom. Not upstairs. All right?’
He found himself pacing the laboratory of his Mind Palace while perambulating outwardly, reviewing chemical compounds for etchings – something Molly had mentioned stuck in his mind, engraver’s acid…
I'm also brainstorming and writing (in a roundabout way) for Pt. 3 of this series, but as this still has a few updates left, I have some time...
The taxi pulled to a halt outside 221 and Sherlock naturally leapt out. John tried not to get ahead of himself as he paid the cabbie. The case was very much on, and even in private he might not get the opportunity to discuss matters right off the bat. And he still had the niggling feeling that Sherlock was very literally putting as much space between them as possible.
Worse than the damn Cheshire cat, this man, the tilt of his obscene mouth. ‘Can you not “resolve” your own tension?’
A shortist chapter because John isn't as verbose as Sherlock. Attempts at sentiment and humour. Apologies.
‘I-it’s at my house! I – I gave it a laxative, to see what came out of it, and I even put a metal detector to it,’ (a metal detector,
,’ he thought to himself giddily: he was counting their relationship (their proper relationship) in weeks, not years, for god’s sake. But moments like this made just breathing feel like the culmination of aeons of evolution, of human achievement. This morning, waking to the up-close marvel of Sherlock’s eyelashes, the soft dark brown dusting across his upper lip and jaw, the steep crests of his bare freckle-dotted shoulders, all tending towards John — it uncoiled a knot that had been pressing on him for he didn’t even know how long, chaffing at his dreams and preventing him from ever really feeling off-duty from high danger alert.
‘Someone will be in touch with you, soon,’ he conceded, primly, so John knew to expect another of Mycroft’s aides-de-camp sometime around 11:59pm tomorrow night, handing him a file of horrific images he’d want to incinerate immediately.
‘Surely,’ he insisted, hoping to get back to the matter at hand, ’it would be preferable to take Gruener out sooner rather than later? You saw how Suze flinched when she thought you might try to hug her — her long sleeves and trousers: all clear signs of abuse, whether self-harm or simply scars from the brief affair with Gruener, it’s too early to say.’ (Almost certainly the latter.) ‘But wouldn’t it
Sherlock looked him up and down: calm, in precisely the way a John Watson staring at a gun barrel was calm.
,’ John stressed again, in his stoniest voice, because he was a bleeding heart, a knight errant, the soldier who had never come home from the war but who
He settled in, prepared to get a bit of sleep himself (had to get it in snatches here as much as in the desert: never knew what was coming over the next hill).
Sherlock blinked. His blinking function seemed to be the only thing operating; his mind had gone entirely blank.
After a moment, on a whim he couldn’t quite account for, Sherlock offered, ‘It was beautiful.’ (Ravel’s string quartet; molecular Borromean rings of perfect crystal.)
person he’d basically forgotten since Sherlock had come back. Another email he ought to send. Though, then again, he doubted (knowing the Major’s reclusive lifestyle, after everything that had happened) he’d be willing to come to London just for a pint and a catch-up.
‘Everything’s delicious, apparently,’ Harry offered loudly, and he started and remembered to pick up his menu. It was short, French, and expensive. He tried not to read it all at once, in grim expectation of the moment when they ran out of civil, neutral things to say, approximately four minutes from now. (An echo of Sherlock’s ridiculously sexy French accent resonated in him with a pang like a caffeine headache. He also, he realised dully, possibly had a caffeine headache: those two cups out of the tin of bulk Tetley’s they kept at the surgery was very clearly not going to get him through this day.)
‘Don’t be self-deprecating, you are not that obtuse. Your need for a certain amount of physical contact to reduce anxiety does
‘Alright?’ John asked, mostly because he wasn’t sure what else to say. Sherlock softly nodded. So John nodded, in echoing confirmation, then leaned in slightly, not giving Sherlock too much time to overthink himself, and brushed his lips. And then, when Sherlock didn’t flee, tried to say it all again with a second, deeper kiss.
‘I suppose I should be grateful to find you dressed. Once upon a time, discovering you plastered to your own sofa at’ (he paused, no doubt to squint at his insufferable pocket-watch with its faint tinkling) ‘ten in the morning would have meant I should expect to find a
He smiled again, a little more genuinely. It had been getting more attention, otherwise he’d have cut it back down to regulation length weeks ago. ‘Yeah, fine thanks. And you?’
John huffed a breath, then came round and sat down heavily, facing the shut grate beneath the mantle. His thumbs resumed chaffing away the seams on his armchair. The back of his jacket, like the back of his neck, was now dry.
’ Self-disgust and -recrimination was plain on his face but John wasn't ready yet to comfort him, to tell him it was fine, when it wasn't. ‘But I remembered it almost instantly.
’ (John understood what such ‘requests’ from well-connected people amounted to) ‘a result as soon as possible, so we have no time to lose.’ He was on his feet, tugging on his coat and circling the kitchen table as he deposited his mug (apparently coffee, considering the smell in the air) in the sink. ‘Horner’s at the station being questioned by Bradstreet, as if that were any use at all, and then I expect we’ll need to see the hotel ourselves, even if the police had trampled all over the scene as usual. Possibly a seven if the security at the hotel is remotely correlative to their per-night rates. Here,’ he added, thrusting a newspaper into John’s hands before grabbing his keys from the high-table and striding out.
A dab of gauze that brought away only two pinpricks of blood – only pulled, then, with surrounding skin very red and angry (he’d have to be extra watchful for infection and temperature), but nothing fully ripped. Not for lack of trying.
As he passed, he saw out of the corner of his vision – he couldn’t help but notice – Sherlock was no longer splayed out on the sofa. Smirking to himself, he made for the shower, refusing to let his eye drift to Sherlock’s open bedroom door.
After another moment, Sherlock caught his eye and said, almost urgently, ‘I had no idea you would be so affected. Even after…’
Sherlock looked appalled. ‘How you managed to get a book contract is a grim reflection on the present state of publishing…’
, at Sherlock’s left ear. He shifted (taking his steps as evenly as possible) to stand by the window.
Pitching himself to his feet with a grunt and the creak of his bones, John began sorting his clothes. ‘Well,’ he added aloud to no one, ‘same time next week?’
. That feeling of the lights coming on — that shiver of attraction, instantaneously sparked — vaguely visible in the woman’s eyes, inspired a reciprocal flare in his gut…
‘You first wife found your charms somewhat… diminished, eventually,’ Sherlock volleyed at Gruener’s back.
left to follow.’ She sighed, and he slid his befouled gloves off as he turned to look at her properly. So she knew who he was (
(He swallowed the razor-winged panic that rose in his chest, and pressed on.) 'There were the other people that did see her. They turned up dead, too. The student who'd met her that morning in the docks. And the officer investigating. Coincidences are not actually that common in murder investigations.' (Sherlock, no doubt, had some sort of maxim about coincidences that he would have flourished at this moment, but John had to make-do with paraphrase.)
After a minute or so of quiet ambient noise, syncing their respiration, Sherlock squirms ever so slightly.
(The nasty egg on Sherlock’s right parietal, on the other hand, was buried beneath his tangled mop of curls. John had checked it before getting up for his shower this morning, grateful at least that Sherlock slept soundly enough not to protest John’s probing fingers along his scalp. He doubted he’d be able to get away with it now, even under the guise of seduction.)
Another hour’s research yielded Gruener’s self-published reflection (all self-important lies) on the
‘I knew you’d be a chatterbox in bed,’ John joked, but then he kissed him firmly again, while his thumb dragged feather-light circles around the inside plane of Sherlock’s wrist, and Sherlock wanted to kiss him until he
‘Mr. Holmes, I act on behalf of one who wishes to save a young woman, a foolish young woman, whose only real crime has been that of granting her trust to a blackguard. You cannot imagine the grave consequences of your refusal.’
John was looking at him unguardedly, his mouth a small flat line, his eyebrows bowed upwards — almost sad. After a moment of staring at each other, John came back, leaned forward, gathering both of Sherlock’s hands flat to his own sternum before placing his other hand along Sherlock’s jaw. (John’s touch: always stable, sure, grounding.)
‘What is the matter, Holmes?’ I asked, innocently as I could, hoping thereby to avoid further grumbling.
, to the gods, fate and chance and genetics and whoever was in charge of criminally soft (and surprisingly ugly) striped duvet covers; to Sherlock, for coming back, for coming to bed when he almost certainly would rather be playing Russian roulette with a madman, for (it seemed) breaking all his old rules and letting John in.
Something in the pit of his abdomen pitched and heaved at the very idea, at the pointless sickening almost-emptiness, and he tangled himself further into John to escape it —
Could she do this, or couldn’t she? Would they have enough time — less than 24 hours — to prepare? Was she doing this just to please Sherlock? Most important of all, did she really understand what Sherlock — what they both — were asking of her?
with a notoriously-unsociable recovering-drug addict with a habit of setting things on fire (including, to name only the most recent, an eyestalk with the eyeball still attached).
The corridor was deserted, illuminated in faint bronze by the most elegant track-lighting money could buy, and Sherlock slipped between the recess in what had once, in a world that knew nothing of the chaos erupting in the hall, been a vestry. No cameras here – another security mistake.
He needed to think. The fingers of his left hand kept caressing the digits of his phone, as if itching to betray his decision not to ring Mrs St Clair himself, to tell her with brutal efficiency just why she had been crying and preparing to mourn for a man she loved and believed in. Finally, after a tenth or fifteenth turn at his window, his eye caught his well-worn trainers on the sill as the wind breathed a hint of rain over them. He stopped.
He only stepped back away from Sherlock’s mouth just in time — Sherlock whined, but John made sure not go too far away.
Since he only skimmed (alright, deleted) the monthly clinic newsletter, he had no idea what she was talking about, but he tried to make a noncommittal noise that allowed her assume whatever she liked.
Nonsense, it took far too long, and this was still new (so much sensory and conceptual data to input; infinite places he could consider as parts of John parts of him had reached, thus diminishing the quotient of parts-to-whole that remained stubbornly untouched), but Sherlock’s jaw ached so close to John’s now freed cock, redpurplepink (like bright visceral organs, open-heart surgery, raw oxygen-rich meat) and hard and scent-soaked of
), he considered Molly’s disguise again. The dress – a ribbed cerulean-and-black dress that wrapped not especially closely around her body, but cut in a V over her collar, a moderate exposure of skin in contradistinction to the slightly-extra-long sleeves that hugged vice-like from her elbows to her wrists – was complemented by translucent tights of the sort that, he was reliably informed, hinted to men familiar with the intimate workings of women’s hosiery of braces, garters, and so on.
They wouldn’t like it, but he was only about an hour ahead of his scheduled shift ending, so it would be possible to be — well, anywhere in London, really — in about half an hour.
‘You’ve gone to a great deal of personal trouble to see that a woman you don’t even know doesn’t end up reaping the harvest of her own mistakes?’ Sherlock pointed out.
‘How’s work?’ Harry asked shortly, in a tone full of accusation that he hadn’t asked first, since he’d been late, and was apparently meant to spend the rest of their time apologising in word and deed.
‘Romantic,’ Sherlock taunted snidely. (Bit difficult, it turned out, to be properly snide with the whole of his mouth bitten rosy and his hair a disaster.)
‘Jesus!’ John whispered angrily, into the inside of Sherlock’s hand which he found clapped across his mouth. Sherlock pulled him into the stylised recess in the wall near a totally useless curtain. John pushed away the hand – honestly, he wasn’t twelve – but tried to marshal his suddenly frenzied thoughts. They were standing very close together (which, had he not spent the last twelve hours at more than arm’s length from the man, would have been totally unremarkable given the long precedent for proximity) in view of the front desk. A prematurely balding, spotty, morose youngish man with a jaw like an orangutan was biting his nails. He was clearly pale by nature, but in the grey afternoon sunlight seemed almost sickly gaunt, jumping as a suitcase knocked the marble tile across the hall. After another moment (during which John was fleetingly distracted by the curl of hair at the very back of Sherlock’s exposed neck –
‘John?’ came Sherlock’s voice, and John saw with some surprise that he was holding the station door expectantly.
‘Take a taxi to the hotel. It looks like rain and I doubt Lady Morcar would appreciate you dripping on her carpet.’
‘I’m not an infant,’ Sherlock insisted, swinging into sitting, furious that even this was difficult (pain that refused to let him go, preferring instead to replicate slicing him open afresh from the inside until he longed to sink into a shuddering heap, except even that would hurt: stabbing was very swiftly sinking in his estimation of interestingness) —
Heavily, Sherlock’s eyes crinkled up at the corners, and John wanted to climb onto the bed and cradle all of Sherlock’s limbs carefully and gratefully against himself and
He clenched his hand to crush his frustration into a compact controllable ball. He didn’t want to have this out in a cab, or as he hurried along (he assumed they’d be hurrying, or what Sherlock imagined in his warped, distracted, case-driven mind was a normal pace) down a stuffy posh hotel corridor. No: they would be home,
As expected, Sherlock waved away the reference with a curt shake of his head. ‘“We” are not doing anything:
A light lift of breeze exposed a distant patch of grass that should have been dark, smooth, unbroken, still: a figure, then, not a guard, moving too fast, too stealthily,
His mind ran through the images he had stored from scanning Gruener’s volumes, overhearing snatches of conversations of Molly and John’s speculations that struck his subconscious as important enough to preserve for study.
Thankfully for all of them, a nurse — the stocky, dragonish woman, of the sort that still had five years before she could retire with a pension but was already counting the days — turned up with a tray and, looking sternly at Mycroft in his three-piece pinstripe suit, tutted.
and he struggled to locate any frame of reference for how bereft it had felt, even with John so close by, to be forcibly thrown back into the untouchable unspeakable vacant uncertain realm of the 800 days when he’d had nothing but a ghost of John conjured in his imagination, so much less perfect than reality. But he reached now and John, rather than sitting on the edge of the bed, used his stance to his advantage and hovered close to Sherlock with restless, bright eyes. Their fingers intertwined, in spite of the hideousness of tubes and monitors and cables.
This time John did meet his gaze, a heated smile of dangerous, banked warning across his face. ‘Sherlock, I don’t expect — ’
Yes – so it was as he suspected – they would need water (but of course in some cases – depending on the composition of the concentrate – different chemicals react differently to require water or, in other cases, emphatically
Though he no longer worried he might be sick, he tried to ignore the uncomfortable newly-woken sensation of hyperawareness of his limbs, of the ticking of his watch in the silent room, of his elevated core body temperature. He swallowed again and went downstairs without his phone. His hands felt paper-thin on the smooth banister.
— bloody politicians and underground peers of the state. Secrets from one end to the other. He could probably work it out in under an hour, but to do that he would have to give a damn. Gruener was a major criminal, no doubt in his mind, but Sherlock was done hunting shadows and only ever finding more.
John’s spine went rigid. He turned now to look down, past Sherlock’s dark gaze, nearly level from where he sat on the lid of the toilet, to his shirt still open – though at least tonight he’d at least lost the driver’s oversized jacket, baggy and all wrong – and skin exposed to the unheated air, like the night they’d rowed after the opera, but now the normal pasty white was flushed and pained and bruised and raw. He didn’t… He clamped down, hard, on as many thoughts clawing in his head as possible and tried to stay in control.
