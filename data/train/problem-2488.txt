“I can hear them.” For once, Dean’s mouth is uncovered. His voice is no longer his own, marred by the gravel of a lifelong chainsmoker, or a man who’s spent the last thirty-six years screaming.
Alastair trails around him, commenting ever-so-often on his technique, throwing out ways to draw out the torment.
He settles back on the floor slowly, feeling every cut pull tight and then relax. He’s human again. The Angel must have burned away all those parts of him that were becoming demonic when it touched him like that. Which means that Alastair was right, and it can destroy his soul. The Angel’s hands on his soul had been an agony that he’d never felt on the rack, and he no longer has his armor of inhumanity to survive it. Dean tucks himself into the far corner of the cell, and watches The Angel from behind his knees. Its rings hum through the air, and a thousand eyes stare back.
“I will begin with your guts, and work outwards. If you have any input on the construction of your digestive system, tell me now.”
“I wasn’t sure how you’d want me to restore it. For the first few days after you heard yourself speak, you still heard your voice on earth in your head. But now, the voice in your head, and that you’ve been using in this space, is the voice of the last body you inhabited in hell. I don’t know which version to give you.”
Thoughts of torture flash through Dean’s mind, of bodies brought back from death on the rack wrong as a new form of torment. He tries to avoid projecting his fear, but Castiel seems to read it anyway.
“What are you hiding back there?” Dean’s not sure what prompts him to ask, but the angel - Castiel - has seemed friendlier in the passing weeks. He’s accepted Dean’s questions without complaint, and the human head he keeps turned away from Dean has begun to gnaw at him.
Dean crosses his arms in front of his chest, and schools his face into what he hopes is a neutral, “Really? What am I thinking now, Brainiac?”
This new angel seems to defer to The Angel, which Dean finds strange. It bows to it before turning towards Dean, and from what little he can decipher of the bodiless body language of these creatures, The Angel offers no such respect in turn. In fact, The Angel remains perfectly still, a set of eyes trained on this new angel, a set on Dean, and a third set closed.
More than once he feels compelled to speak up, to try and initiate a conversation of some sort, but he has no idea what to say. Instead, he finds entertainment in the ever-shifting landscape of The Angel’s body. It has three heads. On its left is a raven, and on its right is a bull. Its final face, nestled between the two, is human, or so Dean thinks. The Angel refuses to turn that face towards him.
Dean does, somewhat reluctantly. Cas reaches three fingers in, taps the flesh at his lower jaw, and pulls them out. Dean’s tongue appears in their place. He sticks it out at Cas in retaliation.
“I do not mean in the way you are thinking.” He pauses, and Dean’s heart keeps jackrabbiting in his chest, “This body you wear now is nothing more than a vessel. Your true body remains on earth, ripped apart and decaying. It needs to be rebuilt before you can be restored to life.”
Cas runs a hand through Dean again, “I am connected to your soul. Since we are directly linked, you are still cognizant of my presence despite your soul’s separation from a body.”
“We have not moved. I have removed your soul from the shell it was animating, and you have lost all your senses.”
Dean is beginning to fade into blissful unconsciousness when the screams of The Angel shatter the walls enclosing him.
The bull looks down at him through its lashes, “Angels have no need for feelings. I have a duty to Heaven, and I intend to see it through, whether or not you approve. James Novak will be kept safe in my possession, and his family will be cared for. It is more than you can say of the people you save.”
Warnings for normal hell stuff, including semi-graphic descriptions of torture. Alastair misgenders Dean once, intentionally, and Cas misgenders Sam once unintentionally.
So it’s some God’s plan bullshit, which Castiel still follows to the letter, which pisses Dean off to no end. “Why not? It’s not like I’ll ever see you again after this.”
In all his years of hearing the angels’ language, it’s never become anything but incomprehensible to Dean. The frequency they communicate in is painful to listen to, and he can barely make out individual words among the many voices that compose an angel’s voice. But while he has no clue what The Angel is saying, he imagines it translates somewhere in the vicinity of “Fuck off”. It doesn’t close its wings until the other angel is gone, and they’re once again alone. Dean has retreated back to his corner of the cell, hands over his ears, and he can’t meet The Angel’s eyes.
Cas drums his fingers against Dean’s serratus muscles, “I understand the conflict. I have an idea, if you’ll allow me.”
“I admit, I have not been the one to observe you and your sister’s lives on earth. I am unable to monitor her now. However, the reports I have received over the years paint a very clear picture. She is better with you there.”
There's a mention of something happening differently in canon, all you need to know is Ava killed Sam in this canon, and not Jake.
Cas lords over the organs he’s created so far, and Dean feels the proximity down to his atoms, “Do you want a uterus?”
Nudity hadn’t bothered Dean for years, is the thing. When you’re tied to a rack, with nitric acid bubbling in your wounds, being bare is the least of your concerns. Nakedness had barely registered to him for years now, but here he was, pulling on a pair of loose fitting pants and feeling as exposed as the day he was born. He’s human again.
“I suppose it could be anywhere, but this,” three taps against the center of the scar, “is where I reached through to your soul.”
What Dean calls The Angel’s body is not really a body at all. It’s more a construct, composed of the same heatless flame that licked Dean’s wounds clean. It engulfs and is surrounded by a series of three ever-spinning rings, which somehow manage to avoid interfering with The Angel’s three pairs of wings. If Dean had ever bothered to research angels, he would recognize it as a seraph purely from these facts. A creature of fire, with a fondness for groups of three. But he didn’t, so he doesn’t.
“Well I’ll start there, then.” Something slides into being. Dean’s not sure he wants to know what it is.
“I wear the face of my vessel on my third head. It has recently changed to the face of James Novak, whose body I will be inhabiting when I leave this place and begin my duty on Earth, by your side.”
“Really? Because I’ve heard enough from religious nutjobs with real strong opinions about me and my sister, and I don’t care who you work for, I don’t want to hear it.”
Cas goes all soft again, but he stays silent. Dean turns away to pull on his clothes, as he has once again been laid bare. It’s not as bad this time though. It doesn’t hurt to move, and he can stand to look at himself.
Dean hears as well as feels Cas snap the bones of his fingers back to straight, and his curiosity gets the better of him. “Why are you having to change so much? Ain’t it all being built new?”
-Cas asks Dean if he wants to continue having a uterus, and about his genitalia, there's some discussion of Dean's chest in regards to his top surgery scars.
Dean would smile if he could, “Never thought I’d know what it felt like to have someone touching my bones.”
Dean stands and leans back against the wall, “So, how is this gonna work? You just snap your fingers and presto-chango I’m a real boy?”
“You are not like most humans. I’ve told you this before, but I don’t think you understand just how true that statement is. My true form is more than just jarring, to humans. It burns the eyes out of their skulls. If there was a single human present for miles, and I delivered you to the surface instead of to where you were buried, I could cause them irreparable damage.”
A moment stretches on, with the new angel watching Dean, Dean watching the new angel, and The Angel watching them both. New angel’s eyes dart over to The Angel and back. In an instant, a dozen of its wings fold back to reveal dozens of hands that reach through the bars of the prison and towards Dean. He flinches back, but one manages to get a fistful of his hair and pull. He’s dragged towards the bars to be scrutinized, both by the eyes coating its hands and those on its wings.
“The faces you are acquainted with are just as much my own as the one I hide from you. The time isn’t right for you to see it.”
Dean had been on the rack for thirty-two years when Alastair first heard it. He’d gotten off the rack for the first time almost two years prior, and had put himself right back on when they’d brought him the soul of a young girl. So it goes. Dean took apart the souls they provided him, and if he refused, he was strung up in their place.
Cas nods only his bull head. The raven has looked away. “I do. James Novak is a troubled man. He is disillusioned with his church, is on rocky footing with his wife, and is terrified of letting his daughter see him struggle. He has begun to lose faith in God, so he prays instead to his guardian angel. Those prayers have been rerouted to me ever since I was informed that I would be taking him as my next vessel.”
“Angels do not read minds, Dean. It was written on your face, in your body language. It is programmed into me to read your body as well as I speak the language of my angelic siblings.”
Hands slide over several parts of him, and Dean feels them shift and change. “Should I explain the risks of continuing these habits? Or can you infer from feeling how much I am having to fix?”
“I will be there, watching over you. I may not make my presence known, but you won’t be alone, Dean.” Cas takes Dean’s face in two of his hands, and tilts it up. His heads spin on his shoulders until his human head is facing Dean. “When you see me next, I will be in the body of my vessel. But I promise, until then, I will be watching. I will be keeping you safe to the best of my ability.”
The Angel only tries to enter his cell once. Dean watches as one of The Angel’s many hands grasps the door and gently pulls it open. All three pairs of wings are tucked behind it, but it is still unaccountably massive against the small door of the cell. Dean curls himself tighter, hides his face in his knees. He knows The Angel is going to hurt him, and he should be prepared to fight back, but he knows he’ll lose. His eyes squeeze shut, and he waits. He waits until he hears the door click shut behind it, until it’s just them enclosed in the cell together. He waits through its silence, and through the shuffle of its wings. He waits. When he opens his eyes, The Angel is guarding the door, looking for all the world like it had never moved.
of them sliding past each other. It’s been days or weeks since it tried to enter the cell, but he feels as though the silence has stretched for far longer.
He starts with small things, questions like “What are you?” (A seraph) and “Why are you guarding me?” (To keep you safe, Dean). He tries not to provoke Castiel, but his calm is endless.
Dean is about to give out when The Angel arrives. Alastair left him hours ago, knowing that today was the day the vanguard would break through their infernal defenses. But, even as he prepared to flee, he refused to cut Dean’s torment short. Dozens of cuts litter his body, intended to bleed just slow enough to string him along for days, but enough to make him too weak to fight back. It’s beautiful, in the clinical way that Dean has come to view his own torture. He knows exactly why Alastair has laid him out like this, the patterns of the veins he had nicked or severed to get the blood to flow just so. In his fear, however, Alastair had become sloppy, and in a few places the knife had gone too deep. If he tries, Dean can cut his time on the rack short.
For a moment, his liver feels like it’s on fire. “I watched as Sodom and Gomorrah fell, Dean Winchester. You have seen little to impress me.”
This part of Dean’s creation takes what feels like hours. It isn’t really painful, but the sensation of it is entirely unlike the experience of being touched externally. The worst part of it all is not being able to do anything other than feel. He cannot see what is being created, he cannot see Cas’ hands on him, and while he is grateful that he can’t hear the sound of his intestines shifting against themselves, he is morbidly curious at the same time. All there is is a faint awareness of Cas’ hands on him, building him up and shifting every part into place.
“When will I see it? You’re really going to come to earth and show me your face then? What’s so important that you can’t show me here?”
Cas reaches for him, gestures for Dean to meet his eyes. “This is not a decision made lightly. The body you had on earth was wonderfully made, and the bodies you were given here in hell were not.”
The Angel is fire and death enclosed in a series of spinning rings, and Dean’s very being recoils from it. Its presence burns at those parts of his soul that have become less than, and his ears bleed at its shrieking song. His heart pounds at the sight, but he’s fighting to keep his eyes open, refusing to be so vulnerable in front of such a creature. The Angel reaches for him, and he thrashes against his bindings, but to no avail. A hand reaches through the tattered visage of his body, and his soul sears at its touch. The holy fire composing The Angel’s body surrounds him, tongues of it licking at his wounds, and he can do nothing to fight it. He is cauterized from the inside out, as the corruption of his soul and the blood on his skin burns away, leaving him clean. His eyes drift shut, against the pain or the light he isn’t sure. They don’t reopen.
Dean starts talking more, after that. Castiel never fails to respond to him, which makes him think that maybe the silence was starting to grate at him as much as Dean. He’s become a ‘him’ in Dean’s head now too, which fits about as well as ‘it’ did, but it seems more polite. Not like Dean ever needs to refer to him in third person anyways.
The attention lasts for only a moment before The Angel snaps its wings open, shoving this new angel’s hands away from Dean and physically separating them. It’s the first time Dean’s heard The Angel scream since he’s been in this cell.
“I am sorry,” it says again, and its voice is nothing like the one in his head. It has the same quality of distortion as all the other angels, like it’s spoken through a halfway-broken intercom, but instead of a series of overlapping voices, The Angel’s voice sounds like it’s being spoken on the wings of thousands of angry hornets.
But a fire’s protection only stretches so far. There are beasts in the dark of a forest, and angels in the dark of the hallways of hell. Dean has finally ventured to the middle of his cell when another angel approaches. It’s a different sort of angel from his guardian, with a body made of countless wings instead of fire. It has four heads, kept at perfect ninety degree angles from each other. None face Dean as it approaches, a fact he’s grateful for when he sees its body turn. As it turns and bows to The Angel, all four of its heads stay gyroscopically stable, maintaining their constant vigilance over the north, south, east, and west. The wings that make up its body, however, are coated with dozens of eyes, all of which lock onto Dean as it approaches.
A knock on the door brought Gabriel from his laughter and he sighed pausing the TV and standing up to answer the door, looking through the little peep hole in the door, and his heart dropped but he opened the door, though kept the chain in place. "What do you want?"
When he got home he placed his keys down after locking the door pulling off his coat and mentally cursing the weather in New York. He placed his drink on the coffee table and grabbed the tv remote excited to continue watching Rick and Morty, he'd just started s3 after a friend recommended the show not even a week ago.
He waved awkwardly to the doorman and he chuckled letting Dean go out and into his car, "Interesting night boss?" He teased, noticing Dean's wrinkled suit and messy bed hair. Dean sighed, slouching into his seat, surprised by the lack of pain in his ass -probably due to Castiel's careful prep job "Not in the mood Arthur..so not in the mood." Ketch laughed but dropped the subject, "Can we stop and get some coffee please?- preferably laced with aspirin?"
"Might as well have." Dean said but it came out more mumbled since he had food in his mouth but lucky for Sam he was fluent in Dean-lish so he understood every word. "Did it not go well?"
Dean and Castiel meet for the first time and have a pretty interesting date. And Sam accepts some truths about himself.
Castiel was gay?- did he know when they were in highschool together?- did he know when they'd kissed?- was Dean his sexual awakening? Dean blinked stupidly but managed a quick recovery as not to give Castiel the wrong impression "Well it's their loss buddy."
but finally after a few months it all died down, not to say that it was all bad considering he got to be on the cover of Vouge under LGBTQ+ celebrities, getting very 'friendly' with two models of different sex which managed to do the trick as he was back to being America's top playboy athlete no matter who he fucked
About an hour in Dean separated from the group when he say pies on a stick he really couldn't help himself. Thanking the man at the stand he turned around and bumped into someone he immediately started to apologise when- "Cas?"
"Yeah Sammy shut up for a second" He said to his brother so he nod to the barista, quickly hiding his phone as she came round from the counter to take a photo with him
"I said shut up Sam- you don't know what the hell you're talking about" He sighed heavily "I know what your trying to do Sam but you don't get it Cas is my bestfriend- I tell him I have these feelings..the ones I've lied to him about for years- he won't want anything to do with me"
the moans were getting louder and Sam lifted a hand to wave as a non verbal bye to Dean which just made Dean roll his eyes and mutter something about 'horny ass teenagers'
Jo wanted some more details, so Dean gave in and explained how he had fist met Castiel properly, and then what had happened we he asked him out. “Now can we get to the clothes please Jo.”
Dean and Castiel walked to their room, Dean stripping off his shirt as he walked then his jeans once they reached the room before crawling into bed. Castiel removed his suit jacket, shirt and belt, hanging the jacket and belt where they belong. “I’m gonna get shower Dean, I smell pretty bad. It was so hot in the building, and I wasn’t allowed to take the jacket off.”
Somehow Dean had hoped that they could do this slowly, but it had been so long for them both that they were to desperate to go slowly. Mustering up all the strength he could, Dean dipped down slightly so he could hook his hands behind Castiel’s legs and hoisted him up. As he took a step away from the door Castiel wrapped his legs around Dean to keep himself up as he moved his lips until they met with Dean’s. They both kissed each other deeply, opening their mouths to allow tongues to explore. Castiel moaned loudly when Dean started to suck on his tongue before he was thrown back on the bed, bouncing a couple times before he settled, smiling like a kid on Christmas, face full of anticipation. Castiel wiggled around until he was lying comfortably with his head on the pillows, watching Dean as he slowly shrugged out of his jacket like he was putting on a show just for Castiel. Once his jacket was on the floor he started to unbutton his shirt, one button at a time, keeping eye contact with Castiel the entire time. Once his shirt was gone, joining his jacket on the floor, he just stood there, staring, until Castiel pushed himself up into a sitting position and beckoned to him with one finger.
“I know that.” Bela said timidly. She had been standing near by silently since she gave Crowley Castiel’s phone, not sure if she should help or get back to work.
That was the end of their conversation for the moment, as Castiel had gotten back up to continue the class. Dean continued to spend the rest of the lecture staring at Castiel, at one point he even found those piercing blue eyes staring straight into his own green eyes when Sam raised his hand to ask a question. When the class was finally over and everyone was packing up to leave, Dean heard his brother’s name called.
Dean groaned, trying his best to keep concentrating on the road. Luckily they were just down the road from the restaurant, and as Dean pulled the car to a stop he leant into Castiel and pressed his lips against Castiel’s in a hard kiss. It only lasted a few seconds, but that was long enough for Dean to have temporarily stunned Castiel, giving him a chance to get out of the car and walk around to open the door for his boyfriend, holding out his hand like a gentleman. Castiel smiled and accepted Dean’s offered hand, getting out of the car and shutting the door. Castiel wanted to keep holding Dean’s hand, but Dean wiggled his hand free and wound his arm tightly around Castiel’s waist instead as they walked into the restaurant.
“Yes. I used to volunteer in a birthing class. I can help you until Dean gets here.” Bela knelt down next to him on the floor and took his other hands, watching for cues of the next contraction and helping him to breath through it, breathing in time with him so he had something to focus on. In between the contractions he tried to catch his boss up on what he had gotten through for the day, but Crowley merely shrugged him off.
Castiel looked down at himself, he figured what he was wearing would make it pretty obvious what he had been doing at this hour, but Dean’s eyes hadn’t left his face. “I live in this dorm. I was just out for a late-night run, helps when work gets too stressful.” He explained.
“About 12 and a half weeks” Castiel said, smiling as he was unable to hide how happy he was that everyone was okay with the pregnancy.
Dean was shocked that Castiel had been able to push him from the door to the bed without him even noticing that he was moving. He was a lot quicker than Castiel though, and before the younger man could nudge Dean down onto the bed, Dean quickly spun them around and pushed Castiel down. He liked the sight he saw in front of him. Castiel landed spread eagled on Dean’s bed, and the sight made his erection grow even further until it was straining uncomfortably against his jeans. Not wanting to wait much longer, Dean stared into Castiel’s eyes to gauge his reaction as Dean slowly pulled his shirt off, followed by his jeans, giving his erection some more room, which relieved some of his uncomfortableness. Once he was left in just his underwear, Dean crawled onto his bed, crawling up Castiel’s body until he was straddling his hips.
“I bet that got annoying quickly.” She chuckled. “Still it’s better than him wanting the new baby gone.”
They made it all the way to the restaurant where they were having dinner, just chatting about their week, before Dean bought up Castiel for the first time since he had met him. “So, Castiel left early today. Seemed like he was in a hurry to.” He tried to sound casual, but he saw the small smirk that Sam sent his way.
“Good afternoon everyone. As you can probably tell, Professor Harris is away today, he isn’t well, so I will be taking this class for him. I will also be taking next weeks classes for him as well, as he will be out for the week, so the homework that was due today I won’t collect just yet. I will allow some more time so for anyone who wants to hand it in today if they have completed it, can do so after class, for everyone else, you will have until Tuesday to get it finished. Now before we start the lecture does anyone have any questions about the last class, or about any pending assignments or homework?”
“Just for being you, and for loving me.” Castiel let go then and walked back to the couch, sitting in his usual corner as Dean finished up the food and walked over to him with the two plates. They talked about their days, completely avoiding anymore talk of the pregnancy for now, as they ate, and when they were done they put on a random movie to watch. Castiel curled himself into Dean’s side, Dean wrapping one arm around him, his other hand placed on Castiel’s stomach. For Castiel it had been an exhausting day, and halfway through the movie he fell asleep. Dean considered just staying where he was and drifting off himself, but he figured it wouldn’t be the best way to sleep at all, so trying his best not to wake Castiel, Dean gently lifted him up from the couch and carried him to bed. Once he had Castiel comfortably laid down and covered with the blankets, Dean quickly went around the apartment tidying up from their meal, cleaning the mess of tissues in the bathroom and grabbing a quick shower himself, he was pretty dirty from his day at work, not that Castiel had minded all evening. Once he was satisfied that everything was cleaned enough, including himself, he went back into the bedroom in just his boxers and curled up next to Castiel, resting his head on his chest and drifted off to sleep himself. The last thought that went through Dean’s head before sleep took him was that he was going to be a father, and he fell asleep smiling.
“Dean?” Castiel asked, waiting for Dean to look up at him before he said anything else. “I love you.”
Dean just shook his head lightly. “Nah, don’t worry about it man. How are you doing in that area? Anyone caught your interest?” Dean asked, once again shifting the attention back to Sam, and this time Sam bushed. “Sammy, what aren’t you telling me?”
“Yesterday. I did a home test a few days ago, then made an appointment with the doctor. I didn’t want to say anything until I knew for sure, but I was too scared to go on my own, so Sam took me.” Castiel explained. He still refused to look at Dean, so he couldn’t see the emotions that were playing across Dean’s face.  “If you don’t want another kid I’d understand, we certainly hadn’t planned this, but I really want to keep it.”
“A boy Jack, you have a little brother.” Dean said, watching his eldest son’s face light up at the news.
“Umm, the day we found out for certain Cas was pregnant I think.” Dean answered casually. “He just wanted to stay in his own apartment for a bit longer.”
“Okay, breakfast time. I didn’t know what you might be able to stomach so I figured eggs seemed like a safe bet.” Dean said, untangling himself gently from Castiel’s arms and grabbing the plates of eggs to take to the table. They sat and ate breakfast, trying to determine for themselves how far along Castiel might be. Unfortunately they had a very active sex life, so it was almost impossible for them to pinpoint a date of conception.
Castile smiled and leaned in to press his lips hard against Dean’s, moving so he was straddling Dean and wrapping his arms around his neck. Although the position may be slightly sexual in nature, they had no intentions of having sex tonight. Castiel just needed to be close to Dean. When theirs lips parted Castiel looked deep into the green eyes that he loved so much, realizing he had actually never told Dean that he loved him. “I’m sorry I didn’t answer your calls. I didn’t mean to scare you.”
Dean made an expression of fake horror. “What? I can’t treat you right on our anniversary?” He asked, pretending to be insulted and making Castiel laugh.
Castiel said it with such conviction that there was no way anyone who heard it couldn’t not believe it. Dean crawled back up Castiel’s body to kiss him. “I love you to Cas. Don’t ever doubt that.”
“We got this Cas, the bag is ready with everything you need, lets just get you a dry pair of pants and a jacket and we will head to the hospital okay. Just stay there, I’ll get them for you.” Dean hurried into their bedroom and grabbed what he needed, the to go bag, a pair of pants and two jackets. It was cold outside so he would need one for himself as well as one for Castiel. Helping Castiel change his pants was more of an effort than it should have been, halfway through getting them off he was rocked with a large contraction that had him crying out in pain and gripping the couch so tight his knuckles turned white. Dean coached him through the pain, breathing with him the way he had been taught to in their birthing class, and then finished the job. Once he was changed and they both had their jackets on Dean grabbed his wallet and keys and helped Castiel to the car, holding his hand the entire drive to the hospital, counting two more contractions on the way if the small cry’s from Castiel along with the death grip on Dean’s hand were any indication.
“I normally sit in the second row, but since you’re not actually in this class maybe we should sit in the back just incase Professor Harris realizes you aren’t a student.”
Dean held up some shirts and Jo chose three for him to try, one red, one black, and one green. Dean went to the bathroom and changed into the pants, getting a thumbs up from Jo, then just stripped his shirt in his room to try the ones she had picked out for him. In the end Jo picked the green shirt, saying that it worked best with his skin tone and his eyes. Dean thanked her a lot for helping him, and noticing the time said he needed to go so he wouldn’t be late.
This caught Dean’s attention, and not just because it was so loud there was no way to ignore it, for two reasons. One: Castiel never swore except during sex, and Two: Castiel never screamed, even when fighting with Dean. Dean could be screaming at him, and he still wouldn’t scream back.
Roughly 2 minutes later Dean was about to get up and walk to the bathroom to see if Castiel was okay when he saw him walking back to their table. “Hey Cas, are you okay?” Dean asked, concern evident in every line of his face.
Castiel smiled brightly. “It is much easier to say, I prefer it as well. Castiel is an easy name for people to make fun of.”
“Cas?” Dean called after him, worried about the sudden change, but Castiel was already too far away. Dean thought about following but Ruby arrived with their drinks.
“I think the morning sickness doesn’t just hit Cas in the morning.” Michael said to the table, hoping his brother was okay.
They walked back to the car quickly, getting in and sitting right next to each other. Castiel was teasing Dean the whole drive by lightly trailing his fingers up and down Dean’s leg, starting at his knee and stopping midway up his thigh. When they made it home they stayed in the car, making out like teenagers for about 15 minutes. As soon as they had parked the car Castiel had pulled Dean onto the passenger side of the bench seat and maneuvered him till he was straddling Castiel before he crashed their lips together in a searing hot kiss. Dean was grinding down lightly on Castiel, feeling them both quite quickly growing hard in their pants, groaning at the feeling. Soon enough though Castiel pulled back as far as he could considering his position.
Everyone at the table laughed very loud at that. They all decided as it was a special occasion to order dessert, but before it arrived a waitress passed their table with another table’s main course and Castiel felt his stomach lurch. He jumped up and ran to the bathroom.
“Cas, look at me.” Dean said, squeezing his boyfriends’ hand reassuringly. Castiel reluctantly opened his eyes and looked at Dean. “You can do it.” Castiel shook his head and opened his mouth to speak, but Dean didn’t let him. “Yes you can. You can do this. You are the strong one of the two of us. If anyone can do this it’s you. Just one more push and this part will all be over.”
“Seriously!! Wow, little Cassie got himself a date. Nice work bro.” Gabriel said excitedly, punching his brother lightly on the arm.
“Here, I have some mints.” Dean said, holding one out to Castiel, who took it gratefully. It wasn’t like he had a toothbrush with him.
Castiel leaned back slightly, just enough to be able to look him in the eyes. “Really? You’re excited?” He asked.
“It looks like you are progressing quite well so far. I’m afraid you are only at a few centimeters though, so it will still be a few hours yet I think before it’s time to deliver this baby. I will check on you every half hour just to be sure, and if anything feels more painful than your current contractions or simply not right, press the call button and let us know.” Castiel nodded again as the doctor gave him this information. “I see here that you have chosen to have an epidural, I would just like to check that is still the case before we administer it?”
Dean looked at his watch and then up at his uncle/boss, unsure as to whether he was serious or just telling a joke. “Really? It’s only 2:30.”
As soon as Dean had settled, he lent down and whispered into Castiel’s ear. “I want you to fuck me.” Castiel moaned from hearing those words alone and quickly shifted them so that he was now the one straddling Dean’s hips. Castiel then lent down to capture Dean’s mouth in a searing kiss, biting Dean’s lower lip gently as he pulled back enough to move his lips to Dean’s neck once again. Placing his hands on Dean’s hips to keep his balance, Castiel ground down against Dean, his jean clad erection pushing against Dean’s. Dean moaned and leaned his head back to allow Castiel better access to his neck, the feeling of Castiel’s erection pushing against his stronger for him as he was only wearing a thin pair of boxers. After a minute of griding against each other, Castiel pulled back slightly, just enough to get his own shirt off without pulling too far away from Dean. As soon as his shirt was off, Dean grabbed his pants and started to fumble with the button and zipper, desperate to get the denim out of the way. Whilst he was doing that, Castiel somehow managed to get his head around Dean’s arms and latched onto one of Dean’s nipples. Castiel felt a surge of satisfaction in feeling the shiver that ran through Dean as soon as Castiel’s lips touched him, and the moan that he let out was obscene, his hands falling away from where they had pushed Castiel’s jeans to his thighs, one hand gripping the sheets below him, the other making its way into Castiel’s hair to hold him in place, his back arching to push into Castiel’s mouth. Dean’s moan as Castiel gently scrapped his teeth across his nipple was much louder than any noise Castiel himself had ever made in bed, and it was making Castiel harder. He felt proud that he was able to make Dean let out a sound like that. As Dean was still making satisfied sounds, Castiel didn’t want to pull away, but he had to. Dean let out a groan of annoyance and frustration as Castiel did pull back, but Castiel assured him it was just for a moment, as he quickly stood up and completely removed his jeans, then deciding to just strip his underwear off as well, pulling Dean’s off of him before he crawled back up the bed to settle over Dean again.
Dean tensed at hearing that the house was out of their budget, he and Castiel had talked on the way here and they both loved the house and wanted to buy it. “How much over budget?”
“There is really not much you can do. Thank you though.” Castiel said sincerely. He was very lucky to have a kind, considerate boss who strived to make sure his employees were always happy and comfortable at work. A thought occurred to him though. “Ohh, unless anyone here knows how to coach breathing.”
“That’s good. My niece was a little slower as well but now she has a better vocabulary than most of the kids in her class, so don’t worry. Jack will be just fine.”
“I was terrified you were going to leave me when I told you. I couldn’t bear it if you did that, so I was ignoring your calls as it meant I could still call you mine for just a little bit longer. I love you Dean.”
As Saturday drew closer Dean’s excitement turned into panic. He had no idea what to do for a date. For a long time now he hadn’t been the dating type, he was more the one-night stand type, but he wanted more than that here, at least he thought he did. By Thursday he still hadn’t come up with a good idea, and considered asking his uncle for help, but that was also going to be embarrassing. Instead he waited till he had gotten home from work and called Sam for help. At first all Sam did was laugh at Dean, but when he had calmed down enough to speak he suggested that Dean should just take him out for dinner and then maybe a movie afterwards. Dean felt less panicked after talking to Sam. He searched nice restaurants online to find a good place and called to make a reservation, deciding that he would see how dinner went before making definite plans for the movie. Perhaps Castiel would prefer to do something else.
“I think I must agree. I’m pretty tired myself.” Castiel agreed with Bobby, his head resting on Dean’s shoulder as though he was using the slightly taller man to keep himself up.
“10 years, can’t believe you two have made it this long.” Sam joked, it was plainly obvious to anyone who looked at the couple to see how much they loved each other. Even Cas laughed.
“Yeah.” Cas said and turned around to walk into the house, leaving the door open for Sam, before walking up the stairs. He had plastered a happy smile on his face before turning away from Sam. Sam sighed and followed.
“Well it’s getting late. Thanks for a great night guys but we should probably all start heading home.” Bobby said, wearing a rare smile as he watched his stepdaughter and nephew fight playfully together.
Everyone looked at the door as Jack walked out, a little jacket covering his shirt. He walked until he was standing in front of everyone then unzipped his jacket and took it off, letting them read the front of the shirt.
In the next second Dean found himself lying flat on the bed, Castiel draped over him as they made out, griding their erections together. Somehow Dean managed to get a hand between them, enough to pop the buttons on both their jeans and push the zippers down. With a bit of work, they managed to get their pants down far enough to kick them off without having to move or stop making out. Once they were just in their underwear the feeling of their griding was intensified. Wanting to get to the next part, Castiel moved off of Dean and took his underwear off while Dean stretched towards the nightstand and grabbed some lube out. When he leaned back Castiel grabbed his underwear and pulled them down Dean’s legs. Meanwhile Dean was rubbing some lube onto his fingers and once Castiel had moved back within reached, stretched one hand around to his entrance and teased it lightly with one finger
“You know, I should have noticed Cas was pregnant.” Ellen said casually as she handed Dean a few bowls of food to put in the fridge.
“Good. What are you doing here though? Shouldn’t you be at work?” Sam questioned, looking suspiciously at his brother.
“Alright, you need to sit down Castiel.” Crowley looked at the chair Castiel normally sat on at his desk and noticed it was wet from his waters breaking. “Perhaps against the wall here might be a better option.” Crowley helped lower Castiel to the ground, and asked Bela to grab Castiel’s phone from his desk and dial Dean Winchesters number. When the phone when ringing she passed the phone to Crowley who held it to his ear just as Dean answered.
Listening intently to the words, Dean moved his hand that was holding Castiel’s down to his waist and pulled him tight against him, Castiel’s other hand moving so that he had both of his looped around Dean’s neck, and they swayed in small circles together.
A minute later Castiel entered the kitchen to check that the brothers were okay and see if Dean was ready. “So there is dinner in the oven for you and the boys, it should be ready in about 10 minutes, make sure they boys are bathed and in bed by 9 please. And no sugar after dinner. Last time you allowed that no one got any sleep that night.” Dean rattled off as if on autopilot.
“Yeah. I talked to the bank about a loan, and once we find a house we want the deal will be sorted.” Dean said. “I’m not sure if you are happy or angry right now about me doing this without telling you. I just wanted it to be a surprise. Figured Jack would want some more space to play as he got older, so I’ve been looking for a place with a big backyard specifically.”
It wasn’t until the next morning that Dean first left Castiel’s side, going down the road to a bakery to get some pastries and coffee for them for breakfast. They ate their food together and then a nurse came in with Jack for another feed and the discharge papers, saying that they could sign them now, but it would still be a few hours before they could actually leave as a doctor needed to give Castiel a quick check up to make sure there were no complications from the birth, and a pediatrician had to do the same with Jack, she would come back to let them know when they could go. Within an hour Castiel had been checked and given the all clear to leave, but the pediatrician won’t make it to the hospital for another two hours, so Dean and Castiel are sitting on the hospital bed together, just staring down at their little boy in silence, when their families arrived to meet him. Dean would have stood up to introduce his son to them, but he is very comfortable where he is with Castiel sitting between his legs, leaning back into his chest, cradling Jack against his own chest. So he did the introduction from where he was.
“That’s true. Well we are studying together on Sunday so maybe I’ll ask her then.” Sam said, his words saying that maybe he wasn’t sure still, but his face said different. Dean could see the determined way his jaw was set when he finished his sentence. There was no doubt in Dean’s mind that Sam was resolved to asking Jessica out on Sunday.
The voice is mechanical, stemming from nowhere but his own head. Dean startles, and his hands fly away from his ears. He looks over at The Angel, in time to see several of its mouths open at once. In time, it settles on one and closes all the others.
a weird feeling, to feel your intestines come into being and slide into their correct configuration. Dean can’t look down at himself, but his awareness has shrunk down to only those parts of his body that are coming alive. His liver begins to form, and Cas pauses, and a tongue of fire licks over and inside it.
“You look like you care very much about what I am going to say next. I do not feel, Dean. I will care for my vessel as is my duty but I don’t have the capacity to ‘give a damn’ about him.”
“In regards to your… primary sexual characteristics. Your feelings regarding them are incredibly muddled, or I wouldn’t ask.”
Cas starts fussing with the radius of his left arm, which hadn’t properly healed after a greenstick fracture when he was 8 and had rebroken several times as a result, “You are being built new, but I cannot bring you into being perfect. I can only build you as you were, from the blueprints present in your soul. From that base, I can change those things I deem necessary to change, or I can feel that you want changed. Like your liver, or your pelvis.”
“Well… Damn, Cas, I don’t know.” If Dean had muscles he would squirm, “I ain’t given it much thought.”
“He does not have to understand. In the case of my vessel, especially. He prays for a reprieve from his life, asks constantly for a sign that God cares for him. He begs specifically for angelic intervention. I can provide him comfort, in being my vessel.”
“As you wish.” Cas reaches a hand towards Dean and brushes his hair away from his face. Dean feels himself tilt into the contact, and then everything is black.
What Dean calls The Angel’s wings aren’t wings in the traditional sense, but there is no other label he can use for them. They’re the light from a prism flashing on a windowpane, the refraction of sunlight on the surface of a CD. They’re an oil slick on asphalt, soap bubbles being pulled by the wind. They are beautiful and ever-changing, and Dean often has trouble taking his eyes off of them. The Angel has caught him at it, but if he’s going to be killed either way, Dean would rather die having looked his fill.
The bull frowns at him, “No. I will need to remove your soul from this construct, and rebuild your flesh and blood around it. It will be lengthy, and likely unpleasant.”
“You’re angry at me. You’re defensive of my vessel, even though you have never met him and likely never will. You think that I’m just as bad as your tormentors here. You’re thinking of the time your sister got possessed and you didn’t put the signs together in time. Now that I’ve said that, you’re thinking about how she prays every day. How if an angel wanted her, she’d say yes to them in a heartbeat.”
The angel ruffles its wings, and its bull head tips towards Dean. “It is nice to make your acquaintance, Dean Winchester.”
He looks down at his bloodied hand and sighs, “Well that ruined the mood,” before burying his knife in Dean’s skull.
Dean relaxes. Jake’s a soldier. He couldn’t save Sam’s life the first time, but he’ll be a good guardian while Dean’s not there.
Some body horror in the form of descriptions, as Dean is being built from the inside out.  Minor warning for discussion of trans bodies in regard to Dean's being rebuilt, hopefully nothing that should be upsetting. More detailed warning in the end notes if you're worried!
“You sounded like this.” Cas speaks in Dean’s voice, the voice he’d had before hell, and Dean cringes away from it. It sounds boyish, naive. In many ways, it doesn’t fit the man that he’s become.
There’s no way Dean is risking that, not after all the bodies he’d been put into by Alastair. “Don’t put me to sleep. I can take a little pain.”
It takes a minute for Dean to respond, and when he does it’s quiet. “Yeah, it’s. I think - I think I need more time.”
Dean’s thirty-ninth year in hell has just begun when he accepts Cas’ request to rebuild his body. He still feels some measure of terror when Cas enters his cell, but the gentle warmth of his presence soothes it away.
Castiel bristles, “I cannot just create a new body. I need your consent, or it will not bind properly with your soul. And your brother is fine.”
Castiel’s heads tilt to the side, and then back, “I apologize. Your sister is alive. Less than four months have passed on earth.”
The first strains of the Angelic Chorus begin to filter through the rings of Hell while Dean is on the rack, being skinned bit by bit.
At a certain point, Dean becomes used to the presence of The Angel. Its flame is bloody red and orange and white, and it burns behind his eyelids, but it’s warm. It’s safe. Dean is closed in a cell in one of the lower rings of hell, but the presence of a hearth gives it something resembling homeliness. And how fucked up is he that that makes sense. More than once in his childhood he was subjected to impromptu ‘camping trips’ with his father, and while they felt the farthest thing from home during the day, at night they’d make a fire and he could sit, resting under his father’s arm, and know he was protected.
Even Castiel cannot read the heartbreak on Dean’s face at his words. He lies back against the wall of his cell, and looks at the ceiling. “You really don’t feel, Cas?”
Sam laughed. “Well most of the class is listening to the professor talk and taking notes, but there is some discussion and questions, and halfway through he usually gives us a break for ten minutes as well. But mostly it is just listening to him talk yes.”
Using his strength Dean hooked his hands behind Castiel’s legs and hoisted him up. Moving quickly Dean walked them over to the bed as Castiel wrapped his legs around Dean to keep himself up, their lips meeting again. They both kissed each other deeply, opening their mouths to allow tongues to explore. Dean moaned loudly when Castiel started to suck on his tongue before threw Castiel back on the bed, watching him bounce a couple times before he settled. Castiel wiggled around until he was lying comfortably with his head on the pillows, watching Dean as he shrugged out of his shirt, keeping eye contact with Castiel the entire time. Once his shirt was gone Castiel pushed himself up into a sitting position and beckoned to Dean with one finger.
Dean just nodded, turning his gaze towards the door to watch the other students as a few more rushed in just before the class was supposed to start. One student in particular caught Dean’s eye. He was standing next to the door, on his phone, facing away from the room. From what Dean could see he was built nicely, lithe, although it was a little hard to tell properly from what he was wearing, which appeared to be a slightly too big for him suit. It almost looked as though he had perhaps borrowed the suit from someone else who was obviously bigger than him. As the guy was still on the phone, Dean turned back to Sam with a question about the class.
Dean noticed the way she specifically didn’t say him or her when asking her questions. Dean had been pretty open about his sexuality since he was in high school and realized he was bi-sexual, at least around his family anyway.
When Castiel had finished feeding Kevin Jack jumped off Dean and ran back to the bed, reaching his arms up to make his request clear without words. “Alright Jack, come here though.” Dean picked Jack up and placed him on the chair he had previously been sitting in and telling him to stay there. Dean then picked Kevin up from Castiel and gently placed him on Jack’s lap, squatting in front of the chair with his arms hovering to make sure Jack didn’t accidentally drop his brother. Ellen made sure she got a photo, then saying she wanted one of all four of them as well, so Dean sat behind Castiel on the bed, Jack sitting in front of Castiel and Kevin in Jack’s little arms. Ellen then proceeded to send both photos to Bobby, Jo, Sam, Gabriel and Michael. After another half an hour Castiel was getting tired again so Ellen said she would take Jack home with her so that Dean and Castiel could rest, and the called the nurse to take Kevin back to the nursery. Castiel quickly fell asleep, and Dean settled as comfortably as it was possible to in the chair falling asleep himself.
“Cas, can we maybe get up from the floor so we can talk about this? I’m pretty sure we will be more comfortable on the couch.” Dean suggested. Castiel nodded but made no movement to suggest that he was going to respond any further. Dean moved his arm so that it was braced under Castiel’s arms, in order to try and stand and pull him up with him. Castiel leaned heavily on Dean as Dean supported him through the bedroom and out into the living room where he carefully lowered Castiel to sit on the couch. “I’ll be right back.” Walking into the kitchen Dean grabbed a large glass and filled it with water. Castiel was going to get dehydrated if he kept crying the way he was. Back at the couch he handed Castiel the water before sitting next to him and draping his arm around his shoulders. Once Castiel had finished the glass he leaned his head down on Dean’s shoulder and snuggled into him, Dean tightening his arm again, moving it so his hand was placed on Castiel’s waist.
Dean and Castiel had been together for a little bit over a year now. Castiel had only graduated college a few months ago, when he moved into his current apartment. Upon graduating Dean had considered asking Castiel if he wanted to move in with him, after all he made a pretty good salary at the garage and had a place that was definitely big enough for two people, but at that time they had only been together about 8 months, and so he had been worried it had been too soon. Somehow through the shock, he was now regretting that decision.
Crowley heard Dean call out ‘Cas in labor, gotta go’ to someone else on his end of the line, while Crowley asked Castiel how far apart his contractions were.
“I’m sorry I didn’t say anything to you first, I just want the baby to have a piece of both of us in in his name.” Castiel explained.
“I’ll call him today and see, he might have tutoring though. Now that’s all worked out though, I am calling the doctor about you. Right now.” Dean kissed Castiel lightly and got up to get the doctors phone number, finding out he had a free appointment in an hour and booking it. They got Jack up from his nap as they were about to leave, making sure he had gotten as long a nap as possible, grabbing the bag that Dean had taken to daycare with him earlier as well, it was still packed with everything they might need. Castiel locked up behind them as Dean started to walk down the building stairs to the car and got Jack situated in his car seat.
Dean placed his free hand around Castiel’s and held them, squeezing slightly to try and calm him. “Forget about that part for a minute. Pretend you are in a place where you are ready to be a parent. Do you want to keep the baby?”
Jack nodded, so Dean turned and walked into the hospital, motioning to Ellen to follow and they went to the nursery together. Dean looked for the tag that said Novak-Winchester on it, which luckily for them was right next to the window they stood at. “There he is Jack.” Dean said, pointing to Kevin. “That’s your little brother.”
“Why didn’t you show us this house sooner?” Dean asked. “It was in the same area as the other two we saw today.”
“Gabe. What are you doing here?” Castiel asked as a man run over and wrapped his arms around Castiel, Castiel reluctantly hugging back after a moment and a squeeze from the smaller man.
“Yeah, sorry. Just smelt something and suddenly had to throw up.” Castiel said as he got up and went to rinse his mouth at the sink, also splashing some water onto his face to wash the slight sheen of sweat away.
As they drove to the fancy little Italian restaurant in town Dean couldn’t stop his hands from shaking, so he kept them both clamped tightly on the steering wheel, the ring box suddenly feeling like it weighed a ton in his pocket. As though Castiel knew exactly what Dean was feeling, which was possible, he had placed his hand on Dean’s knee and was soothingly rubbing little circles to try and calm him down.
Dean just grumbled slightly as he turned back to the mirror to continue his struggle, not even slightly surprised when Castiel was suddenly standing directly behind him, his hands snaking around Dean to knock his hands away from his still messed up tie to fix it himself.
Dean only had a second to prepare himself before Castiel gripped his hips so tight it was like his fingers had become a vice and started moving a whole lot faster and pounding into him, with every thrust still pushing against that perfect spot inside him. Castiel could tell from the look on Dean’s face, and the exceedingly loud noises spilling from his mouth, that he was starting to get close, his untouched cock leaking pre-cum all over his stomach, and he wanted to touch his cock, but just as he made contact Dean slapped his hand away. Castiel looked down at him a little confused about why he had done that.
“Yeah he’s fine. I think we might need to start trying to teach him about traffic and road safety though. Pretty sure I just had a heart attack.” Dean explained.
“Please excuse me Dean, I’ll be right back.” Castiel said, quickly getting up and heading towards the bathroom.
“Sam. I have been quite impressed with your work so far this semester. I was wondering if you were interested in potentially tutoring one or two students that are struggling a little bit with the class.”
“Okay Cas. Hey, how was the night?” Dean asked suddenly as if only just remembering that Castiel had been working all night.
“Is there anything I can do for you?” Dean asked when the contraction was done. He felt pretty helpless right now, it’s not like he could take Castiel’s pain away.
“We haven’t looked inside yet Dean.” Castiel rolled his eyes and smirked at Dean, some of his boyfriends favorite habits have rubbed off on him over the time they have been together.
“Cas, there is no way I am missing a single appointment. This is my baby too, I want to be there for everything. Good, I got Chinese.”
“What would you want to do?” Castiel already knew he wanted to find out this time. Waiting till the birth was a great surprise the first two times, but he felt like he wanted to know this time.
“I’ll text them. Got to let our brothers know anyway.” Dean put Jack down and made him promise not to run off before pulling his phone from his pocket.
“Dean?” Castiel asked, trying to get his attention as he was now standing right next to Dean. When Dean turned to look at him he leaned in and kissed him gently. “I love you Dean.”
He sat down next to Sam, "What happened?" Sam took a sip of his beer, saying nonchalantly "I broke up with Jess."
Then one recent night him and Sam were just hanging out like usual, Sam had just come back from a hard day at work and was not in the mood for Jess' usual crap and all he wanted was to be with Gabriel
"I'll yell at you however I like!- Dean is gone and it's your fault you made him leave because you couldn't just accept him- you're already a shitty father but this?- making your own son run away?- I hate you"
He used his thumb to open the penthouse door, letting the two of them in, he closed the door and Dean had to do a double take, "Damn." the place was bigger than his own apartment- granted he liked his space, it was perfect for him "Nice place."
Dean nodded, "I know I just don't care." He sighed, staring at the cigarette between his fingers, "Are you?- a virgin?"
Castiel refused to let himself blush, and he cleared his throat "Well..if you had stayed I was thinking we could see each other again. If I'm being really honest you were the most fun I've had in quite sometime and I like your company."
"I would of risked it, all the fame, all of it- 'cause he was the one person I truly loved more than myself." Castiel blinked, taken back by Dean's genuine honesty "I've never felt that way about anyone before" He admitted sadly, "I was always busy with work."
- this is the perfect time for you to ask Cas out- you always find reasons to not do it, but now there's nothing going on- you can't just avoid it forever"
"No you actually can’t because we’re already here" Cas pointed outside the window "We live like..five blocks apart"
Sam bitchfaced, "Just be nice, he's Gabriel's favourite brother and I really want him to like us alright?" Dean pulled off his shades "Let me get this straight, you've met Gabriel's parents and all his other siblings but you've never met his favourite?-you guys have been together eight years."
There was a medium beat of silence before Dean groaned from the floor "...We're still going on that date right?"
They'd only known each other for barley two days but the l word was already showing up in Castiel's brain. He loved the determination and hunger in Dean's eyes, especially when they touched, the last time they'd had sex Dean was like a blushing virgin because Castiel was the impatient one but oh have the tables had turned.
Dean rolled his eyes, he loved his friend but to hell with the blatant biphobia- it was so ten years ago
"I mean he's not here anymore" Sam said; he didn't understand why Dean would leave they all accepted him last night except for "Dad" Sam said coldly
But then Cas said 'not like this' and ever since then the gears had been turning in his head, "Cas, we're here"
But Lucifer had another agenda, his father had always wanted to leave the company to one of his children and Lucifer being the oldest he was sure the will stated he would inherit the multimillion dollar business but it went to his youngest brother instead and all he was given was a few million dollars like the rest of his siblings.
Dean scoffed out a hoarse laugh "Cas, now isn't the time" Cas blinked slowly, and his head fell to the side as he was losing consciousness
Dean pulled off his shirt and made a show of his defined abs and the tattoo on his right chest, making Benny give a soft roll of his eyes "Benny we've been over this," He sighed getting his pads on, "I'm not going to 'pick a side'- because I like both, I thought you understood that"
Dean cleared his throat "Well tomorrow is gonna be the day me and Cas met and I kinda wanna do something special for the both of us"
Dean took his hand pulling him forward "Hey- you don't get to be all judgy Mr raised me from perdition- last I remember you threatened to throw me back down there"
Castiel saw Dean's hand slow down an realized he must've been close, and he himself was on the verge so he pulled out until his cock head was threatening to slip from Dean's hole and then he rammed back in, he grinned at the way Dean screamed, both of his hands fisting into the soft sheets, he was clearly shocked at being forced to take all of Castiel in one hard thrust and when Cas looked at Dean's stomach it was being painted with ropes and ropes of come, Dean was just panting nonstop his hips jerking upwards every few seconds waiting for the pleasure to end. The sighed was so arousing that Castiel was coming as well, burying himself deep inside Dean before spilling into the condom.
Dean grimaced and turned around "How the hell did you find me?" Cas shrugged sitting with him "You come here to think"
Dean blushed "In my defence..I thought you were a demon" Cas nodded chuckling "Yeah that makes it better Dean"
Castiel shrugged his brows, "Well feel free to join me." Dean nodded lightly and sat onto the pool chair beside Castiel's, grabbing himself a beer and twisting off the cap taking a long sip, "Y'know your brother seems nice..him and Gabriel are quite the pair."
"I'll be quiet I promise, and it's not like we haven't snuck out before." It was true when you had parents like Castiel's who had to approve your friend list and  Dean didn't make the cut- not after he started causing fights and skipping school, so they started to get creative at around age thirteen.
Dean looked up at the angel who was staring down at him and realised that he was laying in Cas' chest "Sorry, did I wake you?" Cas asked quietly "You seemed to like it"
Dean wasn't even bothered that his brother was probably there to have a heart to heart with him, his eyes had just been opened to something he thought he'd pushed down years ago
Dean sighed, falling back into his corner "Fuck this is so awkward" He shook his head "I'm sorry my friends are dicks, but they seriously won't let us leave until we kiss"
Dean had his hands pinned flat on Castiel's chest as he bounced up and down on the cock inside him. His thighs and ass still ached from last nights fucking but he was already getting used to Castiel's size, he still had so many fantasies about all the things he could do with Castiel that involved a bed.
Dean immediately noticed that he had strayed from his usual choice of outfit and gone with a white button up, a black tie and a casual black jacket matched with black jeans. Dean liked it. Cas stood nervously but Dean walked up to him with confidence even though a part of him felt the same way "Hey Cas."
"C'mon humor me." Dean says and it's with that classic Winchester charm and flash of smile that makes Castiel fold, "I'm a doctor out in Seattle, I work as a surgeon, it's almost always the reason why I never have time for family, I'm always busy working, Lucifer says it's because I 'don't have a life'" He used finger quotes and Dean smiled, Castiel was still adorkable to this day, "A lot of my colleagues say that as well..maybe they're right."
Sam looked at him "Dean it means everything coming from you..more than it does from Dad or Mom, you're my big brother, all I've ever wanted was to be like you..I wanted to make you proud of me."
But his brother didn't stop "Why did he have to kiss me?" Was all he was mumbling as he headed for his bedroom, luckily Sam caught up with him and they found himself in Dean's bedroom
"Well I don't think they're working." Dean just flipped Gabriel off before going back to his food sighing long and heavy. "Dean, talk."
Cas on the other hand did not go as easy, he tried hard to explain how he really didn't want to be trapped in the closet with Dean being pressured to kiss - even going as far as to say he was claustrophobic which his brother assured everyone he was not, betraying his younger sibling
Castiel chuckled, looking sheepish "Yes..I believe we did skip that part." He turned his head, "Hello Dean."
Castiel seemed nice enough though. He was quiet and smarter than Dean but that was just a given most people were, he didn't care about school like Castiel did but he had to go to college and needed to be accepted to at least one school so if that meant studying on fucking weekends so be it.
"What Cas?- trust me, there is nothing you can say right now to change anything so I'm just gonna go, probably drink myself to sleep." He muttered the last bit under his breath, and headed for the door, thankful he had his shoes on. "One more thing." He stopped just as he pulled the handle down, "I really enjoyed tonight. In fact I've kind of been obsessing over you for weeks and..with the way everyone talked about you..I thought you'd be different." He pulled open the door "Bye Cas."
It was then Dean realised how familiar the scene was, it reminded him a whole lot of when he'd kissed Cas for the first and only time all the those years ago and he couldn't help but look at the other man's lips but he didn't dare move, and neither did Castiel they just looked at each other, until Castiel raised a questioning brow "Do you still drink?"
Castiel woke gasping slightly, he'd been surrounded by water..drowning in it, but then Dean was there pulling him up as his eyes shot open and he realised he was in a bed but still gasping for air..for
Castiel chuckled, "Of course they can." Gabriel smiled briefly, "How are you feeling?" He asked straightening out the bowtie "A little nervous..a lot excited"
Dean hadn't been manhandled like this in a long while and he was quickly remembering how much he missed it, being
Dean went back to pleasuring Castiel only this time it was all little faster and he managed to surprise Castiel with a third finger, sending him over the edge of an already spectacular orgasm.
He let his hands run freely through the softness of the feathers enjoying ever second of it, watching Cas moan under his touch, smiling each time Cas' wings quivered
It went silent and to Dean's surprise Castiel started to chuckle which made him do the same, laughing the place instantly felt lighter.
"Great-actually, he even have me some guy advice" Dean smiled, Cas tilted his head and shifted his glasses "Really?- who are you crushing on?"
Dean hesitated at first but nodded, "Yeah sure," He let Castiel light his smoke and they both layed silently on their respective pool chairs staring up at the sun.
Oh right his little brother was getting married, to Gabriel Novak they'd been inseparable since freshman year of highschool, now both twenty six they were about to start their lives together as a married couple. And Dean would never actually say this aloud but he was proud of his little brother, becoming the youngest junior partner in Manhattan and about to marry one of New York's finest chefs, Dean was happy for Sam.
up the call and stepping out of the room into the bathroom, taking a quick peak out the door to watch Castiel groan softly and shift rolling over into a different sleeping position before whispering "Hello?"
"Dean" Cas sat up a little and Dean handed him a glass of water "You're okay buddy you're okay" Dean assured him rubbing soft circles into his back
The door slammed and Cas entered, bags in hand- Sam looked up as well as Dean but only for a moment not wanting to stare or make eye contact with the angel
Castiel clenched his jaw slightly, Sam Winchester had been his friend for a long time -one of his only- at that and finding out that he was using Castiel's brother as a disposable sex object- he was pissed "I'm cancelling the date with his brother"
Dean shook his head "I'm not doing this Sammy I'm not opening that door because once I do...I just can't" He shrugged "That kiss didn't happen"
He cleared his throat "I like girls" Sam scoffed "Yeah no shit" He muttered earning himself a wack on the arm from his mom "But I also like boys" Dean's words were rushed but everyone caught them "I'm bisexual"
Dean grabbed his wallet, quickly shoving it into his pocket before following Charlie downstairs to where his brother and Gabriel were, probably waiting to wish Dean good luck "Oh god my eyes!" Dean screeched the second he saw them while Charlie just wolf whistled her approval.
beer out of his fridge but he ended up grabbing 3 more, he'd been having a pretty hard and confusing couple of months
Gabriel sighed as he shifted through Cas' kitchen, frowning at all the food in his brothers fridge, but hit the jackpot when he found the cupboard Cas previously mentioned he'd kept for Gabriel specifically
Cas nodded and to Dean's surprise he leaned down careful not to move his hips and kissed Dean trying to distract him from the intense pressure he must've been feeling. Castiel himself had bottomed once or twice and he remembered how much it hurt even with a dick that wasn't as big as his it still hurt and his partner had distracted him with soft kisses, trying to take the pain from his mind and help him relax. "You can move just..stay" Dean said and Cas immediately understood, rocking his hips and slowly thrusting his cock while kissing Dean. For a moment he couldn't believe that he had wanted to rush the sex with the man under him, because this was so much better.
The only good thing about the restaurant was that he and Castiel would be able to keep a low profile. The restaurant occupied very famous regulars and was known for respecting their guests privacy. Dean really didn't want word of him going on a date- especially with Castiel Novak of all people to be public just yet.
"You two know each other?" Gabriel said with a frown and Dean managed to nod, "We met in highschool twelve years ago." Dean's heart couldn't stop palpating, he was shocked to his core and he could tell by the look on Castiel's face he felt the exact same.
But he did have a pretty lengthy relationship with someone who wasn't in the spotlight, from what Sam had told him that break up was the one that turned Dean off to relationships, forcing him to focus more on his work only having quick flings every now and again
of felt" Dean sighed and he forced himself to look up "..Cas, I felt like I existed and everything..it just fell into place" He leaned back on the table "..I know I love you Cas, I've known for years- and you can hate me for it..but I'm telling you now..and hoping you'll forgive me for being a complete idiot"
"I'm not reading your mind Dean, I would never do that without your consent" Cas promised and Dean believed him "I'm sorry..I just, I care about what other people think"
Dean couldn't help laughing again "Okay well no fancy forks or knives, you just gotta dig in with your hands." He hesitated "I'm warning you, this will not be pretty." Then he dug into the juicy burger with no shame as he let out a heavy moan and Cas didn't know why but he felt jealous that he wasn't the the one to make Dean moan like that.
Cas stood up "I'm pathetic" He sighed "-You're not pathetic Cas, Dean's an idiot for not realising what you two have is beyond friendship" Sam said
Dean knocked on Sam and Gabriel's door with a sigh, bracing himself for that next few moments. His brother could be a real drama queen sometimes.
Dean knocked on Sam's door; it was finally time, he decided to deal with his confusing ass feelings for Cas but he knew he needed help to do it so who better than his own brother
"Damn right you didn't, and what about when you told Lucifer off for taking cheap shots at Gabriel all night when we first met him?"
Dean lit up and turned to face Cas expectantly, barley containing his excitement "I'd love to" Cas nodded at him, "Awesome" Dean kissed him on the cheek and grabbed Cas by the arm before he could say another word and he dragged him into the kitchen yelling to his mom something about making an extra pie for Cas when he stayed for dinner
Dean felt a little bad about that..he guessed Cas was right, he did kiss the other man as a joke..well at least at the time that's what he thought it was, "Right." Dean's gaze fell to the ground but he had to look at Castiel as he said what he was about to. "..Hey Cas are you happy?"
Sam shook his head, he wasn't even thinking about that "I promise I won't touch you." Gabriel opened the door more for Sam to come inside, hoping that he wasn't making a mistake.
"Sam, I look fine!" Dean heard Castiel exclaim from his bedroom "Okay,okay" Sam muttered and slipped out of the room meeting Dean's eyes "Uh Cas, your
Sam rolled his eyes, "Whatever Jerk." They headed outside through the back door and Dean led Castiel to the pool area, "I'll be right back." He said and came back with two beers, a pack of cigarettes and two towels, handing one beer to Castiel "Oh I don't drink."
be into him like that. "I'll keep that in mind angel." He said, silently handing one to Cas who accepted despite his previous comment.
"I've met him a few times, Sammy, talks my ear off about Gabriel- how great he is and whatever" He chuckled "The kid has a girlfriend and he doesn't talk nearly as much about her as he does Gabriel."
"I'm gay." Sam cut him off, "I'm gay and I am in love with you but I know that my saying that won't fix anything because you deserve better than me." He sighed "I broke up with Jess..I told her the truth and I wanted you to know it too." Tears streamed down his face, "I'm so sorry that I could never be myself around you..or Cas and Dean- I just wanted to be able to start over with all of you and be myself."
Cas dug a hand in his hair "Sorry Gabriel I guess I've just been a little distracted lately..my heads been all over the place."
"Okay- jeez," Sam backed down a bit "But was all that about?- are you guys..together or something?- it's cool if you are-"
Cas raised a brow, not knowing if he should be offended or not "And by that you mean?" Dean swallowed "You could probably get any guy you wanted..any
Castiel knew it was probably silly but he was excited to be getting into a cab again and Dean could tell which made him smile and giggle, and just like last time they held hands the entire ride to Castiel's place, "Wow." Dean marvelled the lobby of the building was fancy as hell, Castiel flushed as they got into the elevator up the the highest floor where Castiel stayed
Still Dean managed to go to sleep that night and he actually woke up early showering and everything, he was eager to get started on the day and enjoy it especially since on the following one his parents would be arriving and he was definitely dreading it.
to be children Cassie" He shot a glance at his brother who was comfortably laying on his bed, clad in black sweatpants and a grey t-shirt watching Orange is the new Black, "Are you going to help at all?- I mean this is your date"
"Nothing.." He kissed Castiel, "You still want me to..or are you good?" Castiel frowned "You're asking?" They came there to have sex it'd be pretty weird if they didn't have sex.
"Oh right!-this is my tall, smart and handsome fiance Sammy." Gabriel grinned proudly, obviously he didn't marry Sam for his looks but it sure did make people jealous "He's
eight and a half inch -he was guessing- cock that was standing at attention, staring right back at Dean, he was excited but visibly scared, he didn't want it to hurt more than he was used to, but Cas just kissed him softly as the man was well aware that the size of his..nether regions could scare his lovers, "As much as I want to fuck you into the mattress I'll be gentle with you, promise" Dean nodded and they moved further up the bed, Dean layed on his back as Cas got the condoms, -XXL probably- Dean remarked to himself and the lube, Dean spread his legs invitingly and Castiel smiles inwardly taking the small action as a sign of trust.
“Castiel make sure you let us all know how you’re doing after the baby is born and make sure you get some rest on your leave. And Congratulations both of you.” Crowley shook Dean’s hand as the elevator opened and Dean, Castiel and Bela all stepped in, hitting the button for the ground floor. Bela helped Dean get Castiel to the car and waved as he drove out of the parking lot before heading back into the office.
“I would have thought that was obvious considering we are in a movie theatre. I’m seeing a movie with some friends, what about you?” Gabriel asking, eyeing Dean suspiciously.
Dean was a little confused about Castiel needing it until it clicked in his head. “Hormones Cas?” He asked. Castiel just nodded., shifting his hips around until he got the right angle screaming when he did. Dean grabbed his hips to help him move easier, and also just to have some part of Castiel to hold onto. Castiel was starting to move quicker, desperate to reach his climax, but the long day and the late hour were clearly creeping up on him, and it looked as though he was starting to struggle to hold himself up.
“Not really, but I do know a sexy car when I see one.” Castiel winked and Dean was momentarily stunned. The trip to the restaurant was more comfortable than Dean had expected it to be, even though it was mostly in silence. It was a companionable silence. When they arrived at the restaurant Dean tentatively took Castiel’s hand as they walked from the car to inside, not sure if Castiel would welcome the contact or not, but Castiel simply slipped his fingers through Dean’s and squeezed slightly as though to reassure Dean that the contact was in fact welcome. As they sat down they started to talk about themselves, learning things about each other.
Dean wasn’t sure if Castiel had chosen the song because he liked it, or because he felt the words really meant something to him, but there were certain words that he really hoped were Castiel’s feelings. Leaning his head forward slightly, he kissed Castiel gently, slowly, hoping to convey some of his own love into it for Castiel to feel, whilst Castiel did the same thing.
“Yeah, every time we’ve seen you two together for the past month he’s been very touchy feely with you. More so than he normally is.”
“I wouldn’t dream of it.” Dean responded, slightly scared at the look he was getting from Gabriel, even though the man was a lot smaller than him.
Castiel tried not to let his surprise show, he always thought that Gabriel was just a dick for no reason but all his older brother wanted was for him to be loved "..and you think Dean might be the one to do that?"
"Oh, thanks." Dean loved his parents but he dreaded the whole 'you're thirty and we want grandkids' talk, Dean did not have time for that, all his past relationships had failed why would he want to try again just to get his heartbroken?
"Good." Dean gently pulled out and rolled off of Castiel's body, reaching over grab Castiel's clothes before he got too cold to handle, Castiel accepted the sweater and boxers and put them on as Dean did the same with his shirt and boxers.
"Well I'm sorry we all can't dress like children" Castiel retorted taking a dig at his brother, Gabriel snorted "We never
Dean shrugged, "What me and Lee had was ours, being open about it would've just ended our relationship sooner."
Dean rolled over to look at Cas, stilling rubbing his arm from when Cas smacked him "Did you really have to do that?" He questioned "I was just having a little fun"
Dean chuckled, blowing out the smoke between his lips and Castiel couldn't help but stare just a little at Dean's pink lips, giving him the sudden urge to kiss the lips that his eyes were stuck on but he wouldn't dream of it. Dean would
"Dean." Castiel was definitely staring, Dean was wearing very fitting dark blue jeans and a black shirt that said in the colors of the flag
date gay dudes." He said jokingly with a hint of serious but Sam shook his head "You shouldn't have to swear off gay guys because you dated one gay dude that had a problem with you being bi."
Dean laughed at that "Aww you're the older one huh?" Castiel's response was cut short when a waitress came up to them sporting a smile "-Dean!- you haven't been here in a while we were starting to get worried."
As they walked back to Dean's car he suggested they keep the night going but since his place was being freeloaded Castiel was happy to lend his and they drove to his apartment building. Castiel wasn't going to lie he felt weird when Dean said he was bisexual, it made him uncomfortable and a little less interested but Dean was nice and funny and extremely attractive and he wanted Castiel, so he let it slide.
"That's nice, my mom died when I was little and I'm pretty sure my dad was born without emotions" Castiel said sadly though he didn't show it "He only adopted five kids so that he could have heirs to the company- I don't even know why he gave it to me."
Dean rolled his eyes "Okay- why are you here?- far as I know no one's dead" Cas squinted at him "You're hurting"
"Dean I've never done this before, I don't have expectations- I'm sure that no matter what happens tonight will be special." He paused "..you know that I trust you."
Sam nodded and walked back inside leaving Dean and Cas alone again, "Is it okay if we finish the project tomorrow?" He asked Cas and the boy nodded standing up, "Yeah sure."
Cas was leaning in and before Dean knew it Cas was kissing him not hard but their lips were touching
Dean scoffed at Gabriel's suggestion, "Why?- I already know why Gabe, he thinks I'm not valid, he thinks that 'bisexual' means easy and that I can't love guys and girls separately- it sucks but it's just the truth."
Dean eyed him curiously, "Yeah I'm starting to get the feeling that you don't do a lot of stuff angel." Castiel glared at him, "Is that supposed to be an insult?"
Dean scoffed a laugh, hating how the tears were starting to spill as he paced, violently wiping at his face, "Yeah, intense that's one way to put it." He sniffed, "Dean you're crying."
Castiel left the office an hour early so he could prepare for his date with Dean, when he arrived he only had forty five minutes before he was supposed to meet Dean at the restaurant.
Castiel smile went at the use of his full name, Dean was getting serious, "You could have chose anyone but you chose me..I just want it to be good for you."
"Move with me- for college let's go to Los Angeles, with the way you've been studying you're pretty much
His hand fell to the curls on Castiel's head and he started to help the man to keep a good rhythm going one that already had Dean on the verge, he felt like he should be crying, Cas was doing everything and more for a guy Dean was pretty sure -up until fifteen minutes ago- was a complete virgin. Cas had his hand perfectly massaging Dean's balls and his throat was flexing around Dean's length- it took everything in Dean to hold back and savor what was easily the best blowjob of his life and he was doing fine, eyes kept shut as Castiel worked below him- until he felt Castiel's hand close in on his ass, spreading his cheek and searching for his hole, Dean's brows furrowed in confusion for a split second before Cas was sliding a single digit into Dean and
Dean looked into Cas' pleading eyes and he felt his embarrassment slip away "I'm..I'm not going to Cas, promise" He said "I really am sorry about out fight-"
Gabriel scoffed, obviously not believing a word "That excuse may have worked when we were in college but c'mon Sam you like something and it's not what Jess has" He sighed "You are my bestfriend and as much as I want to just forgive you I can't anymore, this is the third time since we met that you've done this to me..I deserve better than how you treat me"
"I have..I started pretty early though when I was sixteen, but there weren't many gay or bi dudes at my school so it was mostly girls."
Ouch that hurt "..Yeah, I get it, I'm just the person you screw with when you're pissed off and need to bang the gay out of your system"
"Yeah your brother Lucifer is a total dick." Dean retorted with out meaning to, sharing a look with Castiel who laughed, nodding "Yes he can be"
you" Castiel rolled his eyes; he did this quite often "It is very nice to meet you Sam, I would like to clean up-"
Dean sighed in defeat "Honestly?..no not really." He was actually being honest maybe once a year it'll come back to him but not often. "I mean it was just something that happened."
it was the inevitable question, Dean was sure Castiel wanted to go on about the weekend pretending that what happened between them didn't but deep down he knew it was bound to come up, "What night?" Dean decided to go with, choosing to act like he didn't know what Cas was talking about.
Cas stopped moving his head "Because they're jerks" He said "People like them tend to bully people like me"
Cas laughed "Next time you invite me to a party I'm saying no" Dean's lips quirked up "What?- is the thought of kissing me that bad?"
And with that he was gone, leaving Castiel on the couch alone and feeling guilty as hell. He couldn't
Dean chuckled "Remember that time I tried to get you laid?" He said changing subject Cas nodded "I thought it was my last day on earth" He sighed "Y'know...I thought..- I
They rocked perfectly in sync and the fast Dean got the deeper Castiel's nails dug into his back, Dean fucks into Castiel so good and he doesn't stop at all until Cas is crying out that he's about to come and then his thrusts start to speed up until he's buried deep and they're both cumming hard and Dean is just moving lazily to ride out the orgasm until he knew for sure he wasn't gonna come anymore and finally pulled out, but he stayed on top of Castiel's, their foreheads pressed together "How you feeling?"
Dean chewed the inside of his cheek "..Well we're friends but I don't want to mess anything up- I mean I know that he's gay trust me rainbow slinky's are straighter than him"
Dean didn't now why but he felt the urge to call his brother; Sammy was back in Lawrence finishing up his last year in high school they ever only see each other on holidays and even if they did talk on the phone often this felt different
"Dad I'm bisexual, I like girls yeah but I also think boys are pretty great too- I just like people- and trust me there's nothing you can do to me that I haven't already done to myself- call it a 'faze' try to force myself to like a girl when I'm actually interested in some cute guy"
He felt something in the back pocket of his pants and frowned, reaching to pull whatever it was from it. He brought it before his eyes and he smiled shortly, how could he have forgotten his most important accessory in his back pocket?
He felt a tug on his hand, pulling him out from his thoughts, "Uh?" Suddenly lips were crashing into his and Dean wasn't doing anything to stop them, he had his hands on Castiel's neck in record time deepening the kisses as Castiel began to push him back up against the kitchen counter, Dean moaned in surprise as Castiel was wasting no time, already pawing at Dean's pants eager to get them off. "Cas," Dean gasped out unintentionally as Castiel started to focus his attention on Dean's neck, being careful not to suck hickies to the skin.
Dean scoffed a chuckle "Sammy you are a saint if ever there was one, it's not like you would cheat on her, there isn't a bad bone in your body."
Gabriel couldn't help a chuckle "Sam you were like that before we had sex." Sam rolled his eyes lightly, "Well did you miss the part where I said I had a huge crush on you?-I got jealous all the time."
"What?- why areyou staring at me like that?" An awkward smile appeared on her face as she chuckled nervously.
Gordon nodded, "Any reason for your visit Mr Novak?" Lucifer sighed, long and devilish pouring himself a glass of whisky in the backseat "Oh, indeed, I'm here to steal a business away from my brother and if that doesn't work, well.." He took a sip, "I'm going to kill him."
"He came home drunk and when I tried to cut him off he made some..comments that I didn't appreciate so I decked him hard enough for him to see stars and shit escalated."
"Why was what they said so hurtful?" Gabriel asked softly, his curiosity getting the best of him, Dean sighed, "He was a soldier, I always knew that there was a chance he'd leave and never come back but he made me push those thoughts down and just enjoy our time together. I was twenty one when we'd met, I was younger and I fell fast and hard, and three years later my fears became reality."
Sam had to resist the urge to roll his eyes, he remembered that night like it was yesterday, Gabriel's entire family was very accepting of their queer kids but that didn't stop Lucifer for hating Gabriel for other reasons. He hit on Sam to make his brother jealous and kept making comments about how Gabriel had landed a guy like Sam when it'd should've been the other way around.
Dean blinked once at Charlie who was glaring every so slightly before turning to blink at the mirror..okay, maybe he was stalling and maybe the fitting dark blue pants, black shirt and short sleeved denim jacket did look..
It was empty aside from the hay on the ground and simple neat queen sized bed in the middle of the room that was lit by yellow fairy lights that had been strung up, even the bed had a little table next to it with two slender glasses and some red whine
"Generally pretty good, in the romance department not so much." He admitted "When my company took off I didn't really have time for relationships but whenever I let myself be in one it doesn't end well."
Dean flushed "Well um..I've kinda had a crush on you too but I didn't think you'd ever be interested" He admitted "You're like wayyy outta my league Cas"
Cas was already leaning in and the two were kissing until they didn't have it in 'em anymore, they ended up falling sound asleep on Cas' bed forgetting all of Dean's troubles
"Oh god you didn't go get some girl pregnant did you?" His mom asked and Dean chuckled a little "No nothing like that trust me"
The pain was quickly subsiding due to Dean taking his time and not rushing his prep. Castiel felt this was everything he'd been waiting for and more, Dean's dick was brushing against his prostate with every thrust and though Castiel kept his eyes closed he was seeing stars.
Sam looked his brother up and down "..You have feelings for him don't you- you wouldn't be so freaked if you didn't"
It had happened only once when Castiel had been seventeen, they were in the backseat their clothed erections grinding against one another they were too lost in the feeling of lips on lips to notice that they had been dry humping each other and seconds later both boys had come in their pants, panting against each other until the high came down.
Dean was moaning softly, not making any other sounds, his eyes fluttered closed and his hand guided Castiel's head up and down his dick and it's all so much..his first blowjob and god he was kicking himself- why hadn't he done this before?
and I know it doesn't make you happy" He smiled for real "I want you to find someone and I want you- for
His dad stood to look at him "You're not a fag Dean- I didn't raise you like one" Dean frowned "What?" He saw his brother shoot up out of the corner of his eyes "Dad"
The next day they woke tangled in the sheets, sunlight shining over them through the cracks in the barn
Sam ran back to his room and pulled out his phone, quickly calling Dean- he was surprised when his brother actually answered
Castiel didn't say a word only grabbing Dean by the blazer and dragging him upstairs he practically shoved Dean into his bedroom and flipped on the lights before turning back to the man he was about to
Dean scoffed out a laugh, "Life?" He sighed shrugging his shoulders as he took another sip of his beer, "I don't know maybe it's just stupid..it's been too long for me to still be hung up."
Dean groaned at the mirror "Charlie you don't get it this guy is super cute I need to stand out!" He knew he was being overdramatic but he'd had a crush on the guy for a while now and seeing him in almost every lecture he had did not make it go away which led his friends into forcing him to just ask Castiel out.
Sam took a deep breath "Okay then maybe you should ask him on a date" Dean frowned "Why would I do that?" He questioned and Sam just gave him a look
He chose to wait and even if friends at school thought it was weird actually wanting to wait Castiel ignored them not allowing himself to be made into feeling like his choice was strange- just because most teens at their school lost it at fifteeen didn't mean he had to as well.
"That was interesting" Cas said after the ride as Dean way overpaid the driver and gave him a wave as he drove away "I've never been in a cab before" Cas admitted, he'd grown up with a personal driver, never once needing a taxi, the experience both scared and excited Castiel so much that Dean noticed and took his hand during the ride, warming Castiel's heart.
Dean gasped, placing a hand over his chest in mock hurt "Wow, the angel has claws huh?" Cas just shrugged nonchalantly "..This so stupid" He said after a few moments
Sam felt, it was as if they were just kids again. He pulled Sam into a hug "It's gonna be okay Sammy."
Dean's eyes bugged slightly; that guy was in papers almost every week "The billionaire CEO?-you're friends with him?"
She gasped "I'm offended." Dean looked up at her "How could I ever convince you to forgive me?" He said batting his lashes for extra affect which she noticed "Playing dirty Winchester?- I'm even
I heard what he did when Sam first met him, Gabriel was beyond upset." He sighed, "To Lucifer everything is a competition." Castiel swam over to him "What about you Dean?- how has the last twelve years treated you?"
He looked up and saw Dean was swimming to the side of the pool leaving it to towel off, running a hand over his wet hair, sitting down on the soft concrete and laying back on his palms, watching as Castiel swam up to him joining him, to sit next to each other.
Finally Cas tore off the clothes around his arms and the two moved further up the bed, Dean layed on his back watching Cas kiss the tattoo on his chest before he slid down Dean's body, and unbuttoned his jeans pulling them off his legs
Dean gasped jokingly "I would never!" He said, turning around, his back facing Castiel "I am a gentleman."
"No- I don't want that, I'm just... frustrated, I've been eighteen for a month and they're still treating me like a prisoner, I just can't wait till graduation."
Cas banged at the door wanting the other teens to let then out but to no avail, he turned to Dean and glared slightly "'Meet my friends'- you said-
The drive was silent, Cas stared out the window the whole time so he didn't see Dean's eyes on him when they weren't on the road
Dean grumbled his response, and his feet rawred as he made his way to the kitchen opening the fridge and grabbing the left over pizza Sam and Charlie had ordered last night putting the slices on a plate and warming them up but not before taking a cold bite.
"Cain Omundson, huh?" Dean asks John, who responds by pursing his lips and nodding. "Who was the other guy?" He asks again, dealing a new round of cards.
"I'm retired." Dean says flatly, becoming increasingly aware of the easily accessible gun in the man's holster.
The lights in the theatre start to flash, indicating the play is about to start. The waiter arrives at their table with a bottle of unlabeled whiskey and four glasses. Castiel pours himself a glass, downing it immediately.  Dean looks to Castiel next to him, and notices his state in the dim lights of the theatre. He looks the same as earlier: damp, weak, and pale.
"Are you really so stupid?" Castiel asks the man, who had been trying to draw his own gun while Castiel was distracted.
They make their way to their balcony seats, which is a small, more private section of the balcony with four seats and a table in the middle. They sit down and Castiel beckons for a waiter.
He raises a little higher and sees a man on a horse, holding a shotgun. He nods at Benny and makes the first move. He fully stands up, gun drawn, to face the man who just saved him.
"Sam's told me all about you. It's nice to finally see you in person." She says with a beaming smile on her face.
A small object hits the window right in front of his face and Dean jolts back, hearing a burst of laughter from the street below. Dean opens the window and looks down to see Castiel in a long black trench coat, with a pile of rocks in his hand.
Dean makes his way across the street, dodging horse drawn carriages and a herd of cattle pushing its way through the streets, being controlled by several men on horses.
"Oh, Crowley. My apologies, I forgot you were still here. You may go now." Castiel says, making a 'shoo' motion at Crowley.
Several patrons have made their way to the poker table, one man even hands Dean a bill, asking for an autograph for his wife. Dean signs it anyways, even though it's in extremely bad taste. He's not a celebrity. He's just a guy that has to shoot shit sometimes, and he just happens to be pretty good at it. As he hands the signed bill back to the man, it's snatched by a much smaller, nastier looking man next to him.
"Be on your way, gentlemen." a voice pipes in from afar. "We don't want any trouble here." As the voice comes closer Dean realizes it's John Mills, and rolls his eyes subtly.
. Dean doesn't want to kill people. He's never wanted to kill people. In situations like this, however, there's really no other choice. It'd be pretty hard to try to talk down a bandit that's under orders to rob a business for some sick higher purpose. But Dean will try anyways.
Dean uncomfortably wakes up to the sound of train wheels screeching, scrunching his face as he looks out his window and sees familiar scenery for the first time in a long time. He turns his head to peer through the window across the aisle and sees a train station platform, and the city of Tombstone behind it.
"Whoa, calm down there." Castiel says, quickly standing up and extending a cautious hand. "Are we cross?" he asks, moving his jacket to display a gun in his holster.
"Come on, Dean. I want you to see Bobby." Sam says, patting him on the back as Dean picks up his bag.
He mostly zones out during the play, but he makes out a few parts of it. There's someone dressed as Satan, and some guy is selling his soul. There's a few nice dramatic instrumental pieces being played on the piano, and it's a well put together play, but Dean just can't stay focused on it. His thoughts are uncontrollably filled by the feeble dark-haired man sitting next to him. Dean feels like he should be shot.
echoes throughout the saloon. Dean knees him in the side, and he falls to the ground. Dean picks him up by his belt and the collar of his jacket, and drags him out the doors of the saloon, tossing him on the ground.
"Not a very kind first impression to make, Winchester." The man drawls, lowering his shotgun. "You can put that gun away, I'm not going to hurt you."
Dean hurriedly pulls a brown trench coat from his bag, which lay still unpacked on the floor. He throws on his boots, and hurriedly rushes down the small set of stairs.
"This is Jessica, my girlfriend." Sam says pointedly, as Jessica extends her hand to Dean, which he takes and shakes lightly.
"Do we have a problem?" Crowley says, raising out of his chair and inching closer to Dean's face. Dean can feel the man's breath on his face. He can smell it too.
Bobby nods. "Name's Crowley. Started working the table about two months ago, always drunk, shouts and screams at people. I can't run him off. Saved him for you."
"$500? Must be a damn good hand you have there, sir." Castiel says cockily, eyeing the pile of money in the middle of the table.
"Did you hear that Alfie?" he says, turning to the small, terrified-looking young man sitting to his left. "What a horrible thing to say."
"The Oriental, I bet. That little apartment?" Castiel pushes. Dean sighs again, defeated. "Ah, it is." Castiel smiles. "Good to know."
Sam, who is now a good 5 inches taller than his older brother, laughs into the hug before pulling away to look at Dean. His face is bruised, and there's a slightly healed gash at the top of his hairline.
As Dean finally approaches them, he makes sense of the man's facial features. He's tan, and has jet black hair. Dean suddenly realizes this man is no stranger. It's Castiel Novak.
"It's one of the only ways people have to make money around here. All people are interested in is liquor and gambling. These saloons are making money hand over fist- all of them except The Oriental. It's a mess over there." Sam explains.
The four walk into The Oriental, as Dean holds the door open for all of them. The place is pretty busy. There is another bartender behind the bar alongside Bobby, and most of the dining tables are occupied. Dean makes his way towards the poker table, as Castiel stops at the bar, coming back with two drinks. He hands one of the two to Dean as he gets settled behind the table. Dean nods in appreciation as he downs the shot, wincing as the liquid burns down his throat. Castiel hovers behind Dean, watching him deal cards.
Dean scoffs. Sam is about 6'4" with slicked back brown hair that reaches his shoulders, accompanied by prominent sideburns. He has pointy facial features and small eyes, which drastically contrast Dean's short hair, larger green eyes, pouty lips, and freckles. They don't look that similar. Especially to a stranger.
Jessica and Sam leave first, and Dean and Castiel follow. Dean keeps his eyes on the ground, unintentionally memorizing the pattern of the carpeting. They make their way to the exit doors, and Jessica turns around to face Dean and Castiel.
"This is serious, Winchester. They're killing people, stealing... it's bad. We need a sheriff. A good one. One we have now ain't worth shit, and I know you have experience in cleaning up a town." John sighs. "I'm asking you to step in."
"First of all, you're welcome for saving your pitiful lives. Second of all.." the man pauses. "My name is Castiel Novak. And I'm here
"Whiskey for the table, please." Castiel says once one arrives. "Jessica, what would you like?" He asks, raising his eyebrows at her.
"My name is John Mills. I'm the County Marshall here." He says, extending a hand to Dean, who purses his lips but shakes the man's hand anyways.
Castiel drops his cigarette out on the ground and flattens it with his foot. "Where are you staying, Dean?"  he asks.
"Shut the hell up," Dean says, failing to fight back a smile, "I'm not going with you. I'm going with Sam and Jess. You're just tagging along because God hates me."
"We've got a bit of the same problem here in Tombstone. Band of misfits running around here, they call themselves the Cowboys."
know your name, boy? I've heard endless stories about you. The killer, Dean Winchester. Fastest hand in the west."
"I see you've heard of me." Castiel says through a cocky smile, "Good. Then you really know I'm not going to hurt you." He says with a wink towards Dean.
Continuing their walk, Dean notices at least three buildings with "SALOON" signs, on just one street.
Ok so Cain and Alistair don't have last names on the show so I just used their actor's last names. Just wanted to add this note to avoid any confusion :)
Dean is jolted back into reality by the raising of the lights and the sudden round of applause. He follows suit, standing up and clapping his hands. He hears Sam whistle behind him, and guns are fired towards the ceiling once more.
Dean steps outside the saloon and eyes the town again, spotting Sam and Jessica standing outside a building across town. They look like they're talking to someone propped up against one of the columns of the building. Dean narrows his eyes as he walks down the steps of The Oriental, and Sam turns and spots him. He waves at Dean, gesturing him over. Dean makes his way over to them, and the person propped up against the building starts to become less of a blurry figure. Dean sees that it's a man wearing a white button up shirt and black pants. He has a brown leather holster strapped obviously across his torso, on top of a dark red vest.
"And you must be Castiel Novak." a much bigger man with a handlebar mustache pipes in, addressing Castiel, who's still hovering behind Dean.
Dean doesn't register whats happening until he realizes Castiel is looking to his right, to the side of the saloon. He turns to look and sees Crowley, with blood still on his mouth, carrying a shotgun pointed at him.
Castiel lowers the gun pointed at the bartender and pulls out a small brown sack, sliding all the money on the table into it. He backs towards the entrance of the saloon, keeping his gun raised, only stopping to add three stacks of bills to his sack from another card table by the door. He puts his remaining gun away, and raises a cigarette to his lips, lighting it with a match.
"Your guns don't scare me. Just take your money and get the hell out of here. I'm tired of listening to your whore mouth."
