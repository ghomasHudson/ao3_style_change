Dean sometimes even sucks his thumb, maybe not out in the open but definitely in his sleep. John has seen it on those nights that are becoming a little more frequent where he checks in on his boy after midnight.
Castiel blinks rapidly and swallows dryly, it's so fucking hard to focus in this environment. "I have a
Dean smiles up at her and they begin to chat among themselves. He's not
Castiel whispers in Dean's ear, "Where are your parents?" he asks, analyzing the people in the crowd.
"Do you want to go?" Castiel sits on the edge of the bed, Dean shakes his head. "I'll call Chuck, remember him? He can stop by and start an IV for you."
Dean shrugs, "It happens. You know what, I could go for ice cream-" he changes the subject because he really is hungry again. Castiel smiles. After they kiss and make up, they go to the kitchen to grab some ice cream to enjoy on the porch as the teen suggested they do. As the sun sets Dean sighs longingly from his rocking chair- "This doesn't beat the ocean-" he looks over at the older man.
Castiel's grateful Dean doesn't know about self harm, "Nothing, I would just carve words onto my legs sometimes."
John definitely wasn't home yet, the impala wasn't parked out front. He wasn't sure about Dean yet, though where else could he be. He pushes the boys bedroom door open and his heart sinks when the room is empty.
"Obviously-" he looks into blue eyes with such intensity and passion because it's all they can do where they are. "We can watch it when were too old to fuck-"
Cas-" he exhales harshly, "I wanna-" moans again, "I wanna-"
Meg excuses herself and Castiel comforts him, "Dean, you did amazing taking care of me. You forget that I'm under so much stress here at the hospital when I come into work-I eat right and I exercise, I didn't think I was having a heart attack." he rubs the boys back. "I'd actually be shocked if I ever had one."
"Where's John?"
"-when I'm ready, can I tell you everything?" he doesn't understand, "-everything that happened with him. I tried to tell you when he left but you didn't wanna hear it-"
Castiel says, "I'll be right back-" and goes to talk with that same boy that he smiled at last time.
"You and your ghost stories." Castiel pats him on the shoulder and heads for his room. He lays back in bed and he moans at he cold sheets under his hot skin, it was the best part of going to bed. He's not sleepy so he decides to check his phone again for weather updates and sees a text message from Dean. A smile forms on his lips- it was sent a few minutes ago.
He nods, "Mhm." and sits on the edge of Dean's bed.
Castiel looks into his eyes, "Already have-" there's a short pause. "I feel something close to it at least-" another pause, because they kiss. "My heart races every time I look at your face-"
John says, "Let's go home-" before guiding the only Winchester brother left standing on free land back to the impala.
Castiel keeps sucking him down until he's a broken mess because of him, only then does he kiss up his body to get to his lips. They shared such a passionate kiss that the two of them wanted to have sex but Dean was a little too spent and sensitive to even try for it. Castiel understood and just kept kissing him softly once they made their way from the couch to the bedroom.
"How does that make you feel?"
" Uhm-aghnn- " The boy's legs spread wide and he leaned back against the seat some more, eyes shut tight and neck exposed.
with his baby.
"You did not, stop it-" Castiel rolls his eyes and starts on yesterdays dishes that were still in the sink.
The larger man looks over his way, "Where's dinner?"
Dean thought of all the reasons why this may not be a good idea but he didn't really care at this moment.
"Mhm, thought you trusted me asshole-" regardless of the playful insult his stepfather remains serious about what he's been told. "I'm gonna take her to get a test tomorrow, just to be sure-"
Clealy the man wants to talk about
It dawns on him once again how easily frightened girls can be and does he really want to deal with this? When it's just the
Castiel walks away from the nurses station, shaking his head, because no-it's not a
Bobby looks down at him in wonder, "What the hell ya talking about? I love you-" his large hand lands on the teens shoulder. "Are ya blind son?" the teen doesn't react yet. "I love you like my boy, why do ya think this hurts me so darn bad?"
Castiel pulls up his jeans and fixes his shirt before going to the front door, leaving the teenager a mess on the floor. "Hello?" he calls out, opening the screen door and soon finding Bobby walking from around back of his property. "What are you doing here Bobby?" he gulps nervously.
"Mmm-" the teen hums, eyelashes fluttering against his cheeks and mumbles "Cas?" eventually and the man
but not back at home. That was a another story.
"You like cars?" he asks Kevin as they continue chatting over their refreshments- he still hasn't drank the kool aid and never will.
Castiel nods, he feels bad. "You were right, I never hurt you before."
"I remember you-" the teen says suddenly, briefly confusing the man. "I remember how good you were to me-" he exhales shakily. "In the beginning. Think I was ten or maybe eleven dad first brought you to the house-" breathy laugh. "You kinda scared me at first, I was like- who the hell is this guy-"
"You know going back to that house is no good." Bobby wraps an arm around him and they walk up the porch steps into the house. "How about I make ya some food-"
"Like an oil change?"
"We-"
Dean shakes his head, "I don't want drugs-"
Dean swallows, "She asked me about my dad."
Derek laughs, "Sorry about that-" and shakes Dean's hand once again in gratitude, sneakily slipping him a few bills without his uncles knowledge. "You in school?" he asks, arms crossed at his chest, completely focused on him.
What he wants is something that is beyond wrong, it's almost sick, and that's exactly how he feels. It's not the mixture of whiskey and soda swimming around in his empty stomach, it's because he made a perfectly good man a
and they all know who
Though he loved the man more than anything, it was really nice just being a normal teenager for once.
Dean wipes his eyes, "He said he loved me." Castiel pulls away in disgust and shock, "When he did-it. He said he loved me-"
Castiel swallowed dryly, looking down now at his hand palming the huge cock hidden behind black trousers. The words "God Dean." escaped his lips.
Either way Castiel was still feeling upset, he was so horny and so needy and no matter how many times he got fucked in the ass by John- it wouldn't fix that urge inside of him.
Castiel quickly feels his forehead with the back of his hand, "You're a little warm-" his eyes examine the boys face carefully.
Unfortunately, they sort of turn him on- Being
That makes him feel worse because he seems to be doing better now that they are taking a break, "Good for him-" he lies. Of course he's happy that Dean's out of the house with a friend but he can't help the pang of jealousy that stabs him in the heart.
Something wet is dribbling out of his ass too and the teen reaches down to touch, thinking it must be blood, but it's not blood.
While they're in town they stop by the market and pick up that cake for Castiel, Bobby has the lady in the bakery write a little message on the cake with blue frosting. Blue to match his eyes- Dean chose the color and Bobby assumed it was just his favorite color. That evening around six, they sit on Castiel's porch steps and wait for him- Dean's got the cake resting on his lap.
"You got it, Cas-" Dean smiles and gets to work, but not before the older man french kisses the living daylights out of him. He pushes the guy away eventually with the excuse of, "Bobby might see us you freak-"
"Dean-"
It took almost three hours before they arrived at their destination but they didn't mind for a second, the route was beautiful and the scenery was to die for. It was late summer but the trees were drying up and some were bare- ready for fall. Dean hopes they can come out here more often, growing up he's never gone on any family vacations or traveled anywhere. This is all new and he'd love to do it again, he's just dying for new family traditions of his own.
"Finally." Castiel pulls him through the door and shoves his tongue in the boys mouth, they're both moaning. "Fuck- need you-" Dean nods, already pulling off his shirt.
"What if it's-" Dean looks at Bobby.
It seems like John gets angrier and scarier the longer that they're
Castiel leans in to inhale his scent, nodding. "I can tell, you smell very clean-" there's a smile on his face. "I hated taking baths when I was little, I'm glad you enjoy them."
It wasn't until Dean started wearing his fathers necklace that Castiel stopped him on his way to school "What is this?"
with the boy who always bites his lip when anxious and it's so fucking cute.
"No!" Robin squeals, "You can't!"
" We can work something out...My name is Dean, But you should call me Mr.Winchester, Out of respect. "
Castiel does the same and sits in the bed next to him "Did you eat today?"
Eventually the rain seems to taper off so Castiel goes to check on the teen and give him that sandwich they didn't get around to eating earlier but when he makes it to the screen door- he sees that he's already walking up the road to his uncles without saying goodbye. Castiel really misses him and is wondering to himself how dare he ruin things over some woman. Even if that woman was Meg, and his best friend for many years.
“Have you been fucked before?” He kind of felt he was pushing his luck asking so many questions but he wanted to know more about his sexual life.
Castiel wipes the tear that falls from the corner of his eye.
Castiel wipes the sweat off his brow, "Get going, before Bobby comes over looking for you."
Dean gulps, "But it's gross."
When they get to the treeline Dean makes the comment, "And that bitch better not end up pregnant-" before they part ways.
because he really wanted to play video games. Castiel nods and suddenly pulls the boy close to him by the collar of his own jacket to kiss his flushed face gently. "Muahh-" the sound of lips on skin is soft but audible enough for them both to hear.
Dean smiles, "Awesome." They're leaving the hotel when he speaks up, "No breakfast?"
"What about me? did you like me at first?" his tears have now stopped.
lately.
The terrible thing wasn't only done to Tommy, it was done to his wife and his son. This may be the very thing that ends up destroying his perfect life, the one he was bored with for months. Now all he wants is for everything to go back to the way it was, before he became a monster.
Bobby says, "Robin's mom is droppin' em off-"
Sam cleared his throat, “He-”
"He hit me-" Castiel says softly, clutching to her for dear life.
John helps him up and it surprises the doctor once again because kindness from the man isn't something he witnesses all too often but maybe he was turning over a new leaf. Perhaps feeling guilty for putting him in this condition in the first place which would make more sense. "I'll be outside-" he says before closing the door.
His neck is being devoured like they didn't just come two seconds ago, "Cas-" he tries pushing the man away. "-stop. You're not making sense-" when he feels the hard cock brush up at against him he freaks out, he can't possibly get fucked again. He's got nothing left in him. "Hell no-" he shoves Castiel away roughly. "What's gotten into you?"
"Robin needs me." he grabs the keys to his uncles truck without asking before heading out. Bobby yells after him to drive safe. Once at the diner he walks in, the bell on the door jingles and she comes over. "Where's the fire?" he pulls her in for a friendly hug to keep up appearences.
Dean thinks it over and no, not really. Castiel isn't his
"Don't say things like that in here-" a smile is on his face.
“THAT’S NOT WHAT I MEANT!” He blushed, “Well...That too. Later on.”
But in all seriousness, does Dean really need to go to her house and make her fucking
"Here's your dinner." Castiel sets the brown paper bag containing his meal on the coffee table in front of him and the man grabs his wrist to keep him there. "What are you doing?"
Once they've checked in, things are awkward and silent as Castiel moves around the room unpacking the few things he brought for himself and for Dean. After all it was a short stay. He couldn't wait until morning so go buy that damn water heater to replace the old one and just go home.
Eventually Dean comes out of his room and goes to the kitchen, "Mom!" he whines, "I'm hungry-" and opens the fridge, he clearly thought the guy had left already. "-do we have any fruit roll ups-" he asks his mother.
Dean quickly picks up, "What?"
Castiel whimpers for the first time, he can't believe how vulnerable he feels. He's about to get fucked by Dean.
Castiel's breathing heavily above him, thrusting in and out of the tight heat slowly. "Give it a minute-"
Castiel nods seriously looking around before saying, "I get commissary tomorrow, I'll get you something." and kisses his forehead roughly. After a quick wink and an ass squeeze, he's off to head back inside since rec time was over.
Bobby says, "Jus' watch the darn movie boy-" but his tone wasn't angry, it was just
"Or something." Castiel walks to the same room, Dean follows behind. Once they're seated, Meg joins them in the room. "Meg and I believe you are experiencing some anxiety but they should be mild symptoms, your dizzy spells are what concern me." Dean looks at both of them, in their scrubs- under the fluorescent lights. It happens again, he swallows loudly like he forgot how to breathe and his eyes go wide, he grips the bed again. His shoulders hunch up like it's going to protect him.
John nods, not really caring. "So uh-"
"One-two-three. Now-"
Dean blinks furiously at the man driving the car,
"Be yourself." Castiel reassures him, the suns completely set by now and he sits on the sand- pulling the teen down with him. "I've dreamed of days like this-" he says before kissing him again. It's slow and tender- Dean whimpers into his mouth. It feels good. It feels
"I get it." Dean sighs, "Fuck Cas-" he shakes his head.
Dean doesn't intend on going next door like his uncle suggested, not saying he doesn't want to. Instead, he sits down at the table with a bag of chips and begins chowing down. It doesn't take very long before his uncle comes in smelling like wet dog, as usual. Surely he'll get the first shower since he worked the longest out of the two of them.
Castiel made pasta and a few slices of garlic bread since it was just them for the night. "Good?" he asks the boy, who nods happily. "Pasta is one of my favorite things to eat-"
"Stop that." Castiel leans back on the couch, his legs spreading apart and the hand rubbing him goes higher and higher before it starts groping him over his pajama pants. The soft material against his cock feels amazing. Probably because he wasn't wearing any underwear. "Stop-" he bites his lip to keep from making any noises that would peek his uncle's interest.
He looks up at the older man and shrugs because what else is he going to do. Castiel is weird and cares too much about him for some reason and it all feels weird right now.
Dean snorts, "You're not that hot-" blue eyes glare at him. "Just kiddin' old man-" and he's left alone in the bedroom for a considerable amount of time.
"Why would you say that?"
" So they preach, but don't practice huh Cas. " He was looking over to the passenger side, internally smitten with who was sitting next to him.
"Shut up-" Dean whispers. Castiel crosses his arms at his chest as he makes his way through out the shop, leaving Dean by the books. He's reading the labels on
Castiel sighs, "He had broth just now."
Ash shows up last and brings the fireworks, as instructed and paid for by Castiel. They still didn't really fancy each other but Castiel was doing this for Dean so he gave the kid some money to buy as many fireworks as he could get his hands on. It's been a few years since Dean has seen any from up close and tonight was the night that he would because he deserved to see the sky light up.
"Iron supplements but you need a prescription, you can't get it until I take you to your regular doctor-but we need to wait until this virus slows down. It's a respiratory virus and-you can barely breathe as it is." Dean looks at him and he can see the look of worry and pain in his face. "For now, take your vitamins."
Dean's hands start roaming his friends body, but he thinks it's Cas' body. Sam shudders, never having been touched like that and it surprises him when his neck is being kissed at. "Agh, Dean..." he whimpers. "What are you-"
as if being a virgin was a sin.
Most of all, it  means they would be a real
The shouting has both adults stomping outside- to find Dean running away from the home- to the shadow by the fence. "Dean!" they both scream after him, he keeps running and they go after him.
"John-" he breathes harshly into the darkness in the room when it was all over. "What the hell was that?"
Surprisingly the words hurt him deeply, "Okay dad." but he forces a smile anyway because he''ll always be his fathers good little
Dean sighs longingly, stabbing the ice in his now empty glass of soda with the straw. "Yea-" his voice is distracted.
They share a few more soft kisses before Castiel pulls away and he holds the teens limp hand in his, "Remind me to get you some lotion for these-" he kisses the dried knuckles that had cracked a little. The on and off again cold weather was doing some pretty harsh things to the teens skin, "Need you soft-"
Dean grins, "Hell yea!" and right now he doesn't care what it looks like but he gets up and hugs his step father with all he's got. "I can always visit my friends back home but-" he peels away from Castiel, "Friends are nice, but
The older man pulls his pajamas up and turns the sink on in order to splash some water on his face, then brushes his teeth. His eyes occasionally glance into the mirror, meeting Dean's tired gaze. Castiel spits into the sink and wipes his mouth with a dry towel before turning around and leaning against counter. "Well?" there's a pause. "If you're not going to do anything, I need the bathroom-"
"I understand, peer pressure is hard to get away from. What else?"
Who would have thought that Bobby fucking Singer was a teddy bear, a total softy on the inside. He sure as hell didn't, neither did Castiel but it was really nice to see the old guy be happy for once since Karen passed.
I've always been secretive and I hate that about myself. There's things I've had to do to put food on the table for my brother that he'll never know about. I stopped hustlin' pool in my late twenties. After that, I was earning my money a different way. All I can say is that I'm so grateful to Charlie, she hacked a debit card for me and it's been smooth sailing since. I was getting too old to still be earning money turning tricks. Sammy probably thought I was I getting laid all the time but I was just earning money that way. To tell you the truth, it's been years since I've had sex. He probably thinks I'm still the man whore I was when we were younger, but I'm not. I'm tired of meaningless sex. I want it with...
"What happened?" Castiel whispers when Dean peeks his head in.
"Listen to me-" his arms wrap around her once more because she's upset, "Tomorrow I'm gonna pick you up from work during lunch and we're gonna go get a test. Okay?" she nods sadly and he gives her a final hug before opening the passenger car door for her.
Castiel was beautiful.
"That's Jess-" he waves to the blonde. "-we agreed to get married when we grow up." he jokes, "I met her in my AP English class." The duo had every single class together, all but AP English. "Any girls in school you like?" Sam asks, they finished lunch a while ago and now they're just waiting until the bell rings.
"Dean. Please don't make this harder. I'm not John." he breathes in harshly, "I'm not going to hit you. I'm not going to m-molest you in any way. I promise."
Castiel feels guilty, he himself looks down at the shower where Dean spit. "I'm sorry."
After driving around aimlessly for almost an entire hour, the idea hits him to check the park. After all, it was just around the corner and one of his favorite places to play.
Dean leads the way into a shop called
The hour seemed to drag on for eternity but soon enough, it's over. When Castiel finds Dean in the crowd of church goers, he tells Bobby to wait by the exit while he grabs him so they can get going. He makes his way carefully as to not bump into anybody, with communion going on the church had been extra packed.
"You're so fucking cute baby-begging me like that-God." While he milks Dean, he presses soft kisses to his silky smooth thighs.
"Is that bad?" Dean asks, full of concern.
Castiel says, "Doing things-" he shakes his head- "Being places you weren't-"
"What, you have to come already?" Castiel teases him, pressing down even more firmly on his thrusts against the younger boys crotch. Dean shakes his head, willing his eyes open and looking up into his eyes, forcing himself to last a little longer. Castiel moves around so he can pull down Dean's pajama bottom and boxers, his smaller cock springing out of the material. "You have a beautiful cock, Dean." he admires it, moving down to give it a lick.
Blue eyes' shoulders move like he's laughing under the mask too, "Can I take this off?" he asks sounding like himself.
Bobby smiles, "Well isn't that awesome- but won't that be expensive?"
She takes back her arm and holds it again, "Somethings going on with you-" she studies him. "You're not sick, you're hiding something."
Castiel blushed, Dean looked like he loved the sound of his last name attached to Castiel's first. " Go on, They called your name. Cas Winchester. "
Dean nods, "Bye." slams the car door and walks side by side with his friend Sam. They're both smiling and laughing.
John quickly shoves him aside so he can wash his hands in the sink which he does his best not to take it personally but sometimes the guy treated him like he was just plain ugly. Castiel pulls up his jeans, buttoning them before pulling the older man close for a kiss which is rejected instantly. The look on his face has his eyes welling up with tears because getting denied a simple kiss after an unwanted orgasm is hard bare.
The Winchester duo keep Castiel company until late at night when both Castiel and Dean fall asleep, that's when John carries his tired boy through the hospitals darkened hallways and down to the parking lot where the impala was parked. Dean had been pretty fussy on the ride home after he'd woken up in a grumpy mood, which he quickly put a stop to by threatening to spank him in front of Castiel.
Castiel genuinely mumbles a sorry "Sorry-" but It's not his fault that he loves Dean Winchester so damn much that no matter how much of him he has, it's never enough. "You're just so attractive-" the words are said tightly as he stuffs the bottle back into their bag. "How about we order some drinks-" anything to distract himself from his lovers beauty.
" Thank you for today, Mr- "
"Yea-" he nods, "-that thing."
Castiel blinks- does he not understand what he just did? "Dean-" for a moment he feels like he might just have a heart attack as his chest tightens up in pain. "I have to go-" he almost slurs, leaving the teen alone in the shower. He walks quickly down the hall- racing to exit the home before he throws up. When he makes it outside he dry heaves over the wrap around porch- he's shaking- he's throwing up nothing but air. Dean was always a wild child- pushed his buttons both physically and emotionally. He'd say things that were way out there- to make him nuts but this, is a new level. What does he do?
"This was just a temporary gig-" he pulls her in for a hug since she had started crying almost instantly. "-don't be so dramatic, I'm still gonna come in all the time-" when she won't stop he says, "-if there's a day you really need my help, I'll come in."
it sounds like he might cry.
Castiel rubs the back of his neck, his other hand is in his jeans pocket. "We've established that you don't want me fucking you anymore-" he sighs, "Guess we can watch a movie." he doesn't wait for a response from the teen, he goes to the living room to go through Netflix. See if there's anything new.
there's way too much happiness and love in one room all of a sudden. His day at school had been crappy and coming home to
“He promised me the world.” He ground out. Tears falling.
Dean shakes his head, peeling himself away from the embrace and looks up into those blue eyes. "I'm never gonna be okay-"
Though his eyes are getting harder to keep open due to drowsiness, he still somehow manages to get the boy to his room and to his
"No other drugs?" Benny relaxes against his chair, arms crossed at his chest- clearly stuck between being Dean's buddy and being a police officer. "I want to help you but I need the truth."
"You don't miss home?"
Castiel almost choked during a blowjob, for the first time. Dean could tell that his come almost shot out the mans nose because the guy has his nose pinched at the bridge like it burned. Sort of like when soda goes up your nose by accident. "Sorry-" his voice is small, apologetic.
Castiel smiles, overcome with so much emotion and humors him. "I won't tell Sam anything, I promise-"
The teen drags his feet all the way to the car because he didn't want to go home yet and wanted to stay here longer so they can keep being a couple. The passenger side door opens for him, which he looks at hatefully.
Castiel searches his brain, and yes- Jo does resemble Mary in a way. "Hmm."
Once the teen seems to have calmed down, Castiel offers to hold him for a while and he eagerly accepts his affection. He lays back and Dean lays next to him on the bed, nuzzling his face into the older mans neck. He inhales deeply, loving the scent of his barely there cologne and presses a kiss to his skin. Then another, and another.
"That's friggin' cute-" Dean laughs, watching Bobby drive off down the dirt road- "-even at his age he's still gettin' some." When the truck is out of view Castiel surprises him by pulling him in close and giving him a kiss. "What was that for?"
"The way you looked at me-" Dean wipes his eyes. "-thought we were over."
Dean makes a face that looks like he was insulted, "I think I did good-" and wipes his hands on a rag before closing the hood of the pretty car. "Damn, this guy has a really nice car-" he sighs longingly once again. "I hope Cas get's me a ride this nice for my birthday-" he just has to say it again because Castiel really should get him a car this cool- after what he's done with a certain
Castiel’s eyes flew open, he was panting and sweating. Castiel hadn’t realized he fell asleep and decided to try Dean. He pressed the contact button for “Mr. Freckles” on his phone. It went to voicemail. He left a message, something he didn’t do before.
When Castiel opens the door, he looks delicious. His hair was damp from a recent shower, dripping over his forehead just the slightest bit and his button up shirt was hanging off his shoulders, unbuttoned to show off his bare chest. He pulls the teen into his home and whispering, "Hello, kitten." in the boys ear. "Play with me?" Dean nods sweetly, looking up at him innocently. "Fuck, you're cute baby-"
Donna told some funny stories, well, they weren't funny but she had a way of talking that just made them seem funny. Dean liked Donna instantly, she was a single mom to Claire and the towns best sheriff.
After an hour of reading on the couch, he puts on his running shoes and jogs down the road to see Dean. Bobby saw him from the window and waved him in. "What are ya doin' here so early-" he asks over his breakfast.
"C'mere Sammy-" Dean reaches for his friend and Sam gets closer, "It's okay." Sam tries to kiss Castiel who quickly shoves them both away so he can stand up.
"I don't forgive you." Castiel says, shivering.
(Prequel) Broken Little Soldier- https://archiveofourown.org/works/25776085/chapters/62603506
Before dropping Dean off at his uncles, Derek stops at a drive thru fast food place. The line at the drive thru was long but when it's their turn to order he asks, "What do you want?"
Dean nods, "So you're still gonna be an ass-"
The longer he lays awake in bed, the more pissed he becomes over losing precious sleep. It's not like he can jack off to kill some time because thoughts of his father are swimming in his mind, uninvited.
"Jo I'm sorry." he feels like he's getting a headache from the look she's giving him.
Castiel smiled again from where he sat. " They open early but we'll wait till more lights turn on inside. "
"It's okay baby." Castiel kisses his lower back, "How about a massage instead?" the teen nods in agreement so he begins to kiss his lower back lovingly a few times before using his hands to gently rub the tender muscles. Dean doesn't get much enjoyment, even the massage hurts but he tries to relax anyhow- eventually he rolls over onto his back, spreading his legs open. "What are you doing-"
Dean sits there, looking helpless. "I won't tell anyone."
"Ugh-please-" he whines, "More-talk to me like that-"
Being very clearly aware that he was indeed eavesdropping on their talk, he beckons the boy to come.
he gives him, it's not how one looks at a sibling. A sinister smile forms on his face because he
"My friend from work-" Castiel answers mindlessly, he was sitting up and reading a book.
After dropping Sam off at home, they head over to the hospital and Dean wasn't happy about it- he'd been in the backseat, staring daggers at him through the rear view mirror.
"Guess Santa forgot about me, maybe I should call him about it-" he chuckles and the boy simply glares at him. "You know Santa isn't real, don't you?"
"You can't break up with me, we aren't in a relationship." Dean knew his argument was weak but he was halfway psychotic so why not play this card. He set the glass of water on the edge of the tub.
"You excited to see your girlfriend?" Dean suddenly asks from where he sat in the backseat of Castiel's car.
"My boyfriend." Castiel says honestly and Dean can't believe he just said that.
Dean's head fell, " Well your hearing is A-OK. " He held a thumb's up sign and waited for the boy to pass him so he could roll his eye's without being caught.
"Thanks, sweetheart." Dean smiles at her.
His peers had heard about his petty theft, among other things that happened to get around the school. Everyone had labeled him
Castiel becomes overly excited, "Mmm, Yes-" his chest rising and falling heavily. "I'd have done anything, anything for you to just pay attention to me-"
He never liked lavender until Castiel gave him a bath once- using lavender bubbles. Before he used to think it smelled like dirty flowers but now, the aroma relaxes him. Mostly because it reminds him of
"I'm sorry-" Benny says uncomfortably. "-seems like he was watching you for a while."
"Come on- don't you miss this sweet ass?" Dean gets up and stretches his limbs obnoxiously, knowing full well that his step dad can see his ass.
"Kiss me-" Castiel whispers hoarsely and John does, in a way that has him moaning into his mouth like a desperate whore. "Fuck me, please- " he begs. "-please." the older man nods, man handling him onto the bed-on his stomach. John yanks his pants down to his ankles and Castiel lifts his ass in the air, beyond ready.
Castiel stretches out his sore back with a smile on his face, "I know-" and plants a kiss on top of the teens sweaty hair. "But I like when you're mean to me-"
"Cas, come on-" he begs softly from where he's now laying in bed, sounding completely sober. "I need you-"
It was time to get Dean some new clothes, like
"When everything calms down, my schedule will go back to four days a week." he smiles sadly, knowing it won't be anytime soon. "Eat something." he gives Dean one more quick kiss before getting out of bed to get ready for his day ahead. They both already know he won't be home early and that his promise will be broken.
Castiel sighs, "Baby-" he pulls him close, hugging him tightly against his own body. "I'm sorry she's not here-" he stands there patiently, running his fingers through Dean's hair that was starting to grow longer than he'd like. "Baby-" he sways them. "Are you okay?"
"Automotive Technology-" he responds, now rubbing the back of his head anxiously and Bobby goes back inside, telling them to do the same before the rain comes.
"Come back here!" Dean yells.
The man licks his lips before diving in again, softly using the tip of his tongue to pry apart the boys pretty lips. He opens instantly, allowing for the long tongue to enter his mouth and soon he's making all kinds of cute noises.
Dean's surprised when the older man suddenly appears out of nowhere after having vanished on the way to the yard, "Come on-" he says softly and Dean quickly follows him. They end up sitting down behind an air conditioning unit that was around the corner of the building. He didn't ask any questions because he's already come to realize that Castiel's got many connections in here.
they both think it.
Dean shivers because the older mans lips brush against his ear as he's asked the question. It has him biting his bottom lip, shaking his head. "No-" his response is breathy, almost coming out as a moan.
Castiel turns around, "Dean-" and licks his lip, looking down into green eyes. "-does this mean we're getting back together already?"
After a while he assumes Dean has fallen asleep because he's no longer crying and he hasn't moved either so he picks the teen up, carrying him all the way to the bed. He'd changed out the sheets and freshened up the room while Dean had been in the shower, otherwise they wouldn't have been able to use the bed to sleep on. As soon as they're in bed, under the covers- Dean rolls over to Castiel's side and uses his chest as a pillow, draping his leg over his body.
Dean actually huffs, completely astounded. "I thought I knew you, Bobby-" his face softens. "Never would'a thought- wait, what happened to him?"
that terrible and he's just too naive to actually see it.
Castiel doesn't want to embarrass him but the truth needs to be said. "You were ranting about wanting me to be your
"But I'm so friggin' horny-" Deans begins stroking himself right there in front of him. "So fucking horny-"
"Listen to me Dean, you're getting ahead of yourself here-" she hands him the last tissue in the box. "Castiel is healthy and he's still young, the nightmare you had was
"I think I'm dead-" he blows on the liquid, "I'm so exhausted-"
"Seems nice-" Bobby says, looking at the young trio standing by the doors. Giggling away to each other.
"So beautiful-" Castiel groans as he fucks into his love, hands possessively gripping the tender plump ass between his fingers.
Castiel had been in the hospital for roughly about a week before finally being released and John couldn't be happier to finally have him back home because the laundry was piling up in the hamper, as were the dishes in the sink.
"I gotta go-" he leans over and gives her a goodbye hug.
"Did you tell him?" Dean takes a bite of his sandwich. Castiel shakes his head.
Castiel is shocked when he sees Dean's at the kitchen table with one of his old medical textbooks.
"Aren't you sneaky-" Castiel pulls away completely to his side of the car. "Get the all clear and then I'll rent the cabin. Mind If I go in and get us something?" he asks, looking ahead at the coffee shop.
Dean almost looks frightened by the sudden change in his demeanor before pulling him down for a shy hug. "I'm fine-" and tries to lighten the mood with, "I just cant shit-" then laughs awkwardly.
Castiel looks over at him, "I always liked you- but I guess you reminded me of her. I knew she would be around your age."
"It's okay-" he whispers before kissing him gently, carefully. "I love you, that'll never change-"
"Don't worry." he kisses the teens light brown hair, "It's just so we can see how your levels are."
Castiel is halfway done with his food and drink, "Do you know what they do to people who don't want to eat, Dean?" he shakes his head, "A nurse sticks a thin tube in your nose-"
"I'm still-I don't know what to say." They keep walking- the waves splash their ankles softly.
Castiel gulps his coffee, "Did we really drink that much?" he asks Bobby.
"You have a crush on Cas?" he asks gently, when he doesn't get a response fast enough he pulls his friend closer. "Do you?"
"Hello, Mr. Novak-" the doctor sits down, "Taking the medication I prescribed you last time, for depression?"
Dean doesn't feel guilty because right now he's just pissed. He's angry at the world and he hates everything and everyone. "I told you to go Cas-" after he wipes his bloody knuckles on his shirt he says- "I'll get you some ice." and goes into the kitchen- wrapping a few ice cubes in a dish rag for his step dad. Now the guilt starts to hit him a little, but not much or he would apologize. Instead- he presses the poorly done ice pack to Castiel's nose and he winces in pain.
Bobby was already home by now and when he hears all the yelling from outside he approaches the screen door, "What the hell is goin' on?" Castiel's fuming so he doesn't answer.
Dean blushes in shame, "Sure." he hands her his hair net and exits the kitchen. Lisa always had a way of making him feel dumb and inferior. He's in the break room standing in front of his open locker, checking his phone. Nothing from Castiel yet so he dials him real quick with no answer. "Fuck-" he sighs, his eyes landing on his old pack of cigarettes that he now was hiding in his locker at work, it beats stuffing them in his sneakers that he kept under his bed. Bobby might find them. Dean takes one and goes out back to smoke.
John rolls his eyes, "I had some cash, alright-" and the man is setting his beer on the floor by his feet like he's preparing to fight his son if he pushes the subject.
"Thank you, you may sit."
Dean's still whining when Castiel sees a small taco stand- it looks more like an old shed than a taco stand. "What about tacos?" he pulls up to one of two parking spaces.
His voice is soft, shy almost as he says "I'm doin' Fine-" and looks up at her briefly before looking down at his hands again.
Jo shakes her head, "Don't."
"Shut up." Dean puts some gel in his hair and finishes with two sprays of Castiel's cologne. They share everything now that Dean's older. "How do I look?"
Bobby chuckles, "Don't I know it-" before wiggling his thick fingers at the other man in some sort of goodbye wave. "Have a good night."
Dean leans down, kissing him softly and when the older mans mouth opens their tongues meet in a deep french kiss. Their tongues swirl around each other, massaging and exploring with no need to take it further. They both want to, but kissing is enough. Dean and Castiel kiss until their lips are flushed and puffy, and their mouths are dry, pulling apart when they become thirsty.
Castiel places his strong arms at either side of Dean's head on the wall so he can't go anywhere, "You're so cute-" his voice is drenched in arousal. "Dean, Dean, Dean-" and practically hums the name fondly. "You ever get fucked in the ass?"
After they take a seat at the small table that was placed near the window, Castiel unpacks the happy meal he had purchased Dean. The meal is eaten slowly, almost shyly and in silence. It's strange because they've shared many meals by now but this was different because they weren't at the house. He finishes his burger first and then just watches the boy eat in even more awkward silence.
Reluctantly he follows the group and the girls follow closely behind him, still gushing. Dean's new friend hands him a slice of pizza and they talk among themselves, he's guessing this boy became his friend because he doesn't quite fit in with the others either but he can't complain. All the girls give him their phone numbers on napkins- the boys notice this and resent him even more.
"Hmm, any hot nurses at the hospital?" his step dad thinks for a moment before shaking his head. "Damn, how about Pamela?" the older man looks confused, he's never met her. "Shit- right you don't know her. She owns the record store in town-"
"Maybe if you just kissed her, I could forgive you but you had to friggin' fuck her! Cas, for fucks sake-" he groans in despair, "Your dick probably has female gunk all over it now- Ugh!" he kicks at an old tree stump with his boot in anger. "This is fuckin' bullshit-"
Dean was on a sleep over at Sam's house so he hadn't seem him that day. When John came home late as usual, he was beyond drunk, maybe on something too- he made the terrible mistake of trying to get something going because the next thing he knows is getting his lights punched out.
Kelly keeps on gossiping about what Tommy's parents have said to her, how he won't eat much these days or how he's having trouble getting up out of bed for school in the mornings.
That night John gets into his sons bed way after he'd gone to sleep. Dean almost hadn't felt the hand that had slipped into his pajamas and was now groping him roughly. He looks over his shoulder in sleepy confusion, "Dad-"
The older teen ends up dragging him to his room by the back collar of his flannel, "What the hell you doin' man-" his tone is kinda nervous. But Ash grabs a stack of playboys from his dresser drawer, tossing them on the bed to show them off. Even though he's got his own place, the guy was still a teenager and playboys were the currency, "Shit-"
"I can't swallow these, man."
Castiel swallows dryly, "That's great Dean, just what I like to hear." his tone is sarcastic- he does not want to know what the boy would do for a hundred dollar bill. "After church tomorrow, we'll make the drive."
"Oh shit-" Castiel quickly straightens up and pulls out carefully, "I'm so sorry baby, did I hurt you?"
"I'm not gonna last long-" Castiel says through gritted teeth-
"It didn't do nothing-" he says softly when he sits next to his friend at the dinner table.
They sit down at an empty computer when Castiel says, "You had to print something, right?" in a distracted tone while looking through the boys school papers.
All to soon the man stands up, "I better get to bed." and walks to his room.
"I hope nothing happens between you until you are eighteen-" she says cautiously, nervously. She hasn't dealt with a situation like this before, he can tell- she's going to keep quiet for his sake.
"Yes!" She throws her bear at him, "I was falling in love with you! and you-you!" she gets on her knees on the bed and starts punching and slapping at Dean's arm - it doesn't hurt at all and Dean lets her have at it. He deserves it. Dean eventually grabs her and wraps her in a hug, he kisses her cheek. "I hate you-" she says weakly.
He figured he'd call in again for the day, no way in hell he was leaving this boy alone. No way he was waking him up for school this morning, Dean needed to relax and so did he.
"Just follow me-" he says before sliding into his car and the teen sprints to the truck on the other side of the parking lot.
"Do you want to be best friends?" Jack blurts out, "I don't have one."
Castiel slowly removes his finger before flipping the teen onto his back and he's almost nervous, because he's really that gorgeous. "I do love you in these-" his fingers tug on the lace waistband of the panties, "But you knew that, didn't you-" his voice is questioning, but warm. Dean nods, eyes looking up at him innocently and wide. "You really love me, don't you-"
"Shit." he curses under his breath and his eyes meet the large cross that was on the wall of the church and he takes it back instantly. He keeps his eyes on the cross above him as he prays quietly. "Please don't take him away from me. I love him, I-I know it's probably not right of us but-" he shrugs."-I fell in love with him. Watch out for him today will ya-" he begs. "Uh-Amen." he shrugs again, before he gets up and walks out to the truck in the parking lot.
Castiel wraps his arms around him in an attempt to comfort and when Dean doesn't hug back he knows it's because he needs to hold onto the chair. "Take your time."
Castiel is angry as he blows the man and it shows that he's not interested in what he's doing because it's done lazily. Johns hips buckle which makes him gag and he pulls off, wiping his mouth, "I can't-" dark brown eyes stare down at him expectantly. "I can't do
“God no...I mean- yes but not now. I can’t. It kinda hurts.”
"I'll never forget your birthday." he wipes the corner of Dean's mouth with his thumb, "You have some frosting-" the boy looks up at him with this look-the look that makes Castiel melt and he stops-he forces himself to focus on the slice of cake in front of him. They both eat cake and pizza in silence for a long while, the TV is on- playing some romance movie that Dean's probably still too young for.
"Really now." Dean pressed his thumb to the boys hole, pressing and rubbing until it finally popped in. "You sorry yet?" he whispered into his ear.
"If anythin' happens to your car, Dean can fix it." Bobby plates the eggs, "He's good on the newer ones, I'm more of a classics guy-"
Dean can't hide the smile that appears across his face though when his uncle turns around, it disappears.
"I don't beat him." Castiel looks at him with so much anger, "Whatever we do- it's mutual." he knows it doesn't justify anything, they both do.
close.
they would be participating in when they arrived at their destination. He's a grown man and so is Dean, well
Castiel's large hands let go of his wrists, "That's it, go with it-" and now his hands focus on holding him wide open by the knees, holding them down against the mattress.
"I'm hungry-" he says quietly, which grabs the attention of the older man who hadn't noticed him walk in until just then. Castiel doesn't say anything, just moves away so the boy can do his thing. Dean looks at him every once in a while as he makes himself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on a single slice of bread. The guy looked drunk so he comments on it. "Are you drunk?"
Castiel already disliked this 'Dean' person. "Castiel is my name but I go by Jimmy sometimes...sometimes Castiel gets me bullied."
Castiel doesn't see Bobby or Dean the rest of the night and maybe that's a good thing. Early in the morning Dean comes into his room- "Hey."
Castiel nods, Bobby too.
"Agh-" Dean groans loudly, the hand on his back pushes down further and he cries out. "Agh-fuck-" Castiel thinks he's just enjoying himself but his back is starting to hurt once again. They hadn't had sex since before he'd injured himself so this was a surprise, "Ugh, Cas-" he moans in pain, "Stop-"
The following week after his confession regarding the abuse with his new boyfriend, Meg finds him sitting at his usual computer in the nurses station after their work schedules not lining up for a few days. Instantly she knew that something must be wrong when the doctor doesn't notice her presence the second she sits down beside him. Her mind quickly raced to dark places, thinking maybe John had done something else to her friend.
Red meant failure. He grew accustomed to seeing several red F's on his papers and quizzes that it didn't phaze him at all. By 9th grade, he had already given up on life.
"Sure, we making them on the grill?" Bobby nods. "Why don't you get that started and I'll get a pie baking in the oven-"
Dean's heart seems to stop in his chest, he doesn't say anything and just takes the napkin from her hand before going back to his friend. After handing Kevin the neatly folded napkin, his eyes dart over to the girl again.
"What are you doing?" Castiel asks.
Dean takes a seat on the bed, Castiel stands in front of him and starts listening for his heart beat with the stethoscope- it was cold and it made him flinch- "All normal-" he listens to his lungs next before it's wrapped around his neck again. "It's time for your injection, and your medication." Dean snorts because he thinks injection means something else, something dirty but Castiel actually pulls out a needle and prepares his vitamin shot.
"Hmm." Castiel thinks it over, well aware that he could abuse his power of this boy and do something cruel- get revenge but he decides against it, he loves him too much. "Just be loyal to be baby." he smiles warmly at his love. "Don't
Castiel's chest is rising and falling, Dean was clearly struggling to get the task done so he rolls onto his side and pulls him close. "Let me take care of you-" he whispers harshly, his hand trailing down the teens warm skin before one finger presses to that peachy pink hole. "It's okay-" forehead kiss, "You're safe with me-"
The nurse smiles warmly before leaning in closer. "He's a baby, give him some time to grow up a little-" another wink. "But when you do get married for real, please invite me. Okay?" she laughs softly. "I love weddings, it's been years since I've been to one-"
"Hey, bitch." Dean smiles, of course he has regained himself- the kid quickly recovers from his girly episodes. When Castiel gives him the flowers and apologizes, he laughs-"The fuck am I supposed to do with these-" though he ends up smelling the flowers behind Castiel's back and they later end up in a water pitcher at the kitchen table- they lied to Sam about it, saying it was to liven up the place.
In the coming days the couple don't speak much because either work or school didn't allow time for it. Of course they missed each other but they were both trying to let go of stuff in the mean time. Dean was trying to get over his guilt but it was easier said than done and Castiel was just trying to be patient and understanding because that's his
Dean tries again, "Do you think I'll get her pregnant the first try? I bet I'll get her pregnant real quick-"
He will always miss him and never stop loving the man with the red flannel shirt. His eyes were the only pair of eyes that could give him that annoyed stare yet have such tenderness behind them all at once. The boy admired Dean for all that he did for his little brother as well, giving his life away to caring for him.
Castiel waits until he's done with the story, not knowing what to expect or what he's getting at. "So I followed him outside, he said he didn't live too far from the diner so I thought it would be okay-" Castiel's stomach begins to hurt as he listens. "He said he lived just up ahead, passing the train tracks-" Dean swallows his tears this time. "When we got closer-he pushed me on the tracks-he pulled my jeans down and-and please don't make me say the rest."
"Right." Dean rolls over on his back, wincing as he does. "Just friggin' pick me up in the morning, this pain isn't goin' anywhere-"
He pushed the feeling aside and nodded at whatever Dean had been saying, something about Demon's and Black and Car's? Who know's.
"Okay daddy-" Alex smiles, taking the three hundred before leaving the room.
John asks, "You okay?" and his tone is one of concern because it never takes him this long to recover from sex.
Dean closed his eyes, nostrils flaring. "One...Two...Three-"
Castiel takes off his scrubs and throws them on the bed in some kind of adult tantrum, Dean would laugh if Castiel wasn't so scary in the rare times he got pissed off. "You're whats wrong with me." he grumbles.
He visibly relaxes, "Awesome-" and laughs. "Alright then, buddy. Cheers-" he lifts up his half empty mug of beer.
Castiel rolls him over so he's on his back, he knows he's going to have to change the bedding before they can sleep. "Did I hurt you?" he asks him, feeling a little guilty that he got so carried away.
John liked their
They probably should have thought more about the teens eating habits because missing a day or two a week of school was becoming normal as well, due to stomach issues. How could he not have them, when he was eating one large meal a day or snacking on random crap all day.
Castiel takes a few seconds to calm himself, his hand rubbing and grabbing at the plush ass on display just for him. The sudden light slap of leather against Dean's bare ass makes them both moan. "You okay?" he nods, looking over his shoulder innocently. "Fucking gorgeous-" another slap, still not hard enough to cause any real pain. "My kitten-" another slap.
He throws himself on the bed and he picks up his phone- a new message from Castiel. He opens it and instantly bites his lip, the guy had sent him a nude photo- his face cropped out of it- good idea. Dean undresses rather quickly and takes a nude photo of his body- his face cropped out. Almost instantly Castiel responds.
"Please baby-" Castiel rubs his large hand over Dean's growing bulge in his shorts. "I feel better-" he's ignored yet again so he gives up. For now at least.
Dean gives her a cocky smile and reaches across to push open the passenger side door open. She hops in and quickly pulls him in for a tight embrace, giving him chills because her hands felt ice cold on the back of his neck. Things are quiet in the truck,
Dean's eyes are focused nervously on the older mans blue eyes before opening his mouth and sucking the peanut butter off the mans salty finger. "Mmm-" he moans, it wasn't supposed to be sexual, he was just that hungry. Another finger full of the brown butter is in front of his face and he sucks it again, that's how the older man finger feeds him almost half the jar. "More-"
Castiel runs his hand down his face, "I need to go-" his eyes land on the teens naked body. "And you need to put some clothes on-"
is she? Does she have a
"Dean-" his own eyes begin to water but he pushes them back because Bobby can see his face.
The drive doesn't take long, maybe three hours and yet much fun was had in that three hour long car ride with Dean singing at the top of his lungs and Castiel just being happy to be spending the day with him. Nothing but the sand in their toes- Bobby didn't say anything about his nephew keeping his boots on the whole time, just his jacket. They park by the nice hotel that was within walking distance from the beach, even if they weren't exactly checking in but no one needed to know that.
"You did good, Dean. Don't think so much." he gets up and pats his fluffy hair before leaving the teen and his uncle alone for a while- as per Bobby's request. "where's he going?" he asks, watching Castiel's ass leave through the front door.
Castiel seems
Dean barges in through the door with a huff due to the extremely cold weather outside and his eyes widen in surprise momentarily as he takes in the view. The last time the house looked like this, the man fucking proposed to him. It scared the holy hell out of him the first time and hopes this isn't a repeat of the occasion.
"It doesn't look like they're going to be able to build a case against me." Dean sighs, "But I'm not out of the woods yet, since I'm a new doctor here- they're keeping an eye on me." after a moment he says, "They think it's one of my nurses' fault, she didn't fill out the chart before surgery so even if I had checked it-" he chews on food. "-nothing would have been there for me to go off of."
A few moments later Castiel exits the coffee shop and sprints up to the car, Dean watched his every move. Once inside the cool air conditioned car, he sighs. "Ready-" he asks, taking a sip of his iced coffee drink.
Any onlooker would think there was something inappropriate going on between the two young teens because they looked to be a little too
"Who owns this car?" his tone sounds curious and he is, he'd love to know who the vehicles owner is.
Castiel nods, "Can you come in or is Bobby waiting for you?"
Castiel shrugged, already heading towards the store. "It's never too early, besides the one from this store- "he gestures to Abercrombie & Fitch, "Is for teenagers. It's not that strong." They both walk in, instantly Dean is looking around, confessing he's never been in this store before. That Dad would call him queer for stepping in there.
"We're getting somewhere. You were abandoned by your mother and then your father- it created this fear inside of you that whenever Castiel leaves your side,  it makes you believe he won't be coming back." Dean nods, he'd known this deep down. "We can work on this in our next session-" she writes in her notebook and he knows their time is up.
"Yea, Bobby. Sure does." It does sound like fun, it feels like home with the only two people he cares most about. They spent the entire afternoon out back working on a clients car, just about everything needed replacing even the tires but Bobby had stacks and stacks of tires piled around the yard. "Cas got me this clunker, doesn't even work- too bad you can't help me fix it."
Right then his pocket beeps, a text from Dean.
"So this is where you go to school hmm-" he looks around at the school building and there was in fact, big kids everywhere. Dean gets out of the car and runs up to a taller boy who had been waiting for him, he's guessing that was Sam.
"Cas?" he opens the bedroom door to find him laying in bed, looking terrible and coughing uncontrollably. "Shit-" he steps closer,"-you're sick." and he doesn't know what to do, Castiel never gets sick.
"What matters is that we weren't drunk-"
"What do I gotta do?"
There's reddish hand prints molded onto his hips and he sort of likes them. It was a good fuck so the reminders are accepted.
Castiel swallows, "I was curious-" their noses rub against each other in an unintended eskimo kiss. "You certainly could've turned me-"
Castiel nods, "Sure-" their eyes linger on each other, still the teen tries hard not to look at his exposed upper body. "Forget something?" he taps on his cheek with his index finger. Dean licks his lips before giving the stubble covered cheek a quick kiss. "Good boy-" and it sounds like he said that to his dog. "Run along-" he gestures for him to go away.
Castiel sits on the edge of the bed, and smiles. Dean Winchester is almost eighteen years old, yet he still needs him and that makes him happy. "Where does it hurt?" Dean rubs all over his stomach so he can't tell so he takes matters into his own hands and begins to feel around his stomach for any painful areas. "Does it hurt here?" he presses right around where his appendix would be, Dean shakes his head. "How about here?" he presses where his gallbladder would be and Dean shakes his head again. "Maybe it's just gas-" Dean kicks him away playfully for saying that. "I'll be right back."
"I only stopped cause she started bleeding." Dean actually laughs, "Poor thing, she thought it was her period. I bet Ellen's never gave her the talk. I popped her cherry just like-"
"Shut up Cas." Dean sits down on the sand that still feels warm, and Castiel sits behind him- wrapping his arms around him in a loose embrace. "Love you." Dean leans back against the strong chest that holds him up. "Always." he adds.
Castiel gulps, "Are you serious?" but the teen winks at him before getting up and letting his uncle know that he's going to get in the shower before going to bed. He stands up almost a minute later and says, "Bobby, it seems that I won't be able to stay for that movie but thanks for inviting me-"
"Desk goes in here-" Dean gestures to his spare bedroom he used as an 'office'. "We can share my office." Castiel starts to unpack his things slowly, he feels sad to leave his sister Anna by herself, but he's so thrilled for this next chapter in his life. He's back in school, pursuing his dream of becoming a doctor. Lord knows he's got the grades and the brain for it. Dean insisted he not go back to work as a cashier, that he should focus all of his time on his true goals. "Let me take care of you." Dean kept saying, after much convincing, he accepted. After all, when he becomes a doctor he would be taking care of Dean when he needed his help.
Castiel shivered, "I'm scared."
"Cas-"
It was so out of the ordinary and so freaking random because the guy knows how much he doesn't like sports. If he was going to like anything at all, it was going to be something cool like wrestling. But fucking
with him or too him but that feeling lingers for a while.
Dean sighs from the sheer pleasure that's building within the lower half of his body, "Me too, Cas-" a soft moan. "I'm-" another moan. "So happy-" and it sounds like he tried to swallow some emotion there. "You're like the best thing that's ever happened to me-"
Dean hears a car door slamming shut right outside the front door, a quick peek through the window lets him know it's Castiel.
Dean pulls off his shirt and kicks off his jeans free from his ankles, "Done, sir." hes scared and horny at the same time.
"See you tonight Winchester." Brady ruffles up Dean's short brown hair and leaves, although he's a jerk he politely says goodbye to Castiel and Bobby on his way out. That night as promised, Brady shows up and he meets him down the road from Bobby's. The car was parked near the wooden fence by some trees so it wasn't visible in the darkness.
It's only six in the evening when Castiel leaves the house to go have dinner with his hospital friends and that of course included Meg Masters. John quickly began to despise her with a passion because she was getting in the way of his relationship with the doctor.
He stays hunched over the porch for a long time- not being sick, but thinking. The only thing that came out of him were a few tears. Dean didn't come to check on him- or ask for forgiveness for basically
For a second there it looked like maybe he was whispering in her ear because of the loud movie, as he moved- he noticed that he was kissing her ear.
"Dean-" he's so amazed by the sound of his voice, he had no idea. "- I never knew you could sing like that, why didn't you tell me?" Dean stays quiet and Castiel peels out of the parking lot and they head for some lunch. After a few minutes of silence he says, "I've heard you sing before and it was nothing like that." he chuckles, "Why would you sing horribly in front of me on purpose?"
John starts screaming about something, he can't quite make it out- but Dean crying in the doorway is something he can't stand. The boys father was standing way to close to him in his rage and his only concern was getting him out of the way. "Dean-" his eyes look over in the direction of the hallway that leads to his bedroom and he prays that he takes the hint.
Dean turns in his seat a little bit, now facing his step father. "I have an eating
"I regret what happened with-" Castiel closes his eyes and Dean kisses him right then. "You really still love me?"
Castiel covered his ears for the next hour as Dean cursed his name and kicked at things in his room. It eventually died down, he fell asleep for few hours before getting up and knowing what he had to do. In the morning he sits in the living room, waiting for Dean to wake up.
Castiel married her in the late 70's when everybody fucked and did drugs just for the hell of it. It's actually how they met, they locked eyes at some kind of hippie festival and fucked that very same night in his colorful van that was guaranteed to croak in the middle of the road someday soon.
Dean blushes, whimpering in his throat like a hungry puppy. "I-"
Castiel finds him at the nurses station, with a fellow nurse. A
"I came to give you your injection-" he comes in and sits on the bed.
"Kinda was-but I thought you loved me enough to not fuck him." when he looks up again he sees that
He opens the car door, "You waited for me-" and gets in. "-I told you I didn't want to go."
Dean giggles, "I wish- he shakes his head as if to say 'never mind'.
"Where's Cas at?" the bearded was on the screen was holding the phone way too close, clearly not knowing what the hell he was doing despite the ten minute tutorial.
"With Robin-" He lies.
Dean's face feels hot from those words "I am?"
Dean blows on his coffee, "Did you like it?"
He's a good man, but I still want both of ya to wait-" there's a look of disbelief from the teen, "Can ya do that for me?"
Bobby has been working his nephew all day today so that he could get thanksgiving dinner all set up and ready to go. The guest list was short this year, shorter than usual because they just wanted a quiet night in with just
"Sure Bobby, I'll help you." He agrees to the task without even knowing what it was. "I'll be up bright and early-"
Even though he doesn't know if they're still friends or not, he goes over to him. "We good?" their eyes meet and the taller boy shrugs. "Alright, then-" and he's about to take off but he's stopped.
cute-"
The hospital had been packed with children who had broken their arms or had some kind of stomach ache due to consuming way too many Hot Cheetos. It was like an epidemic. He must have given the same lecture to about ten kids all in one afternoon, practically begging every single one of them to stay away from the spicy chip unless they wanted to keep having gallbladder attacks in the middle of the night.
but he didn't come in, probably clueless about what's going on. The guy doesn't answer his phone for anything while he's working. Maybe that makes him a good doctor, but it makes him a shitty..
"I'm keeping these until I can trust you again." He opens the door for the doctor, "I'll take you to work and pick you up after-"
Two days later, Dean finally comes over to
They also somehow have a little boy by now too and he follows Dean everywhere which is just too adorable. His name was Jimmy because Dean had wanted to use Castiel's real name to carry on some sort of legacy or something. Besides, the name was pretty cute and Castiel promises to name their next after him.
Um...I remember you, yea.
As he makes his way up the road to Bobby's, he works on sending Castiel a quick text- letting him know he won't be there when he gets home. If he were to be honest with himself he would say that he was pissed that he had to work so much but on the other hand, he didn't want for anything. Since Castiel had come into his life he's always had more than enough food even if he wasn't present to cook it for him, he always had new-clean clothes to wear, the mortgage was always paid on time, as were the rest of the bills. The last few years- he always had comics book to read, video games, you name it he had it and it was all because of his step dad.
Dean was surprised by the interior of the home, it was well kept and nice, definitely nicer than the exterior had been. Although he was really curious about the condition of the house, he knew not to ask any more questions. Maybe his parents had died, leaving the house to him and the last thing he wanted to do was upset the guy.
Eventually, after a long busy day Benny and Dean had almost forgotten what had happened between them as they chatted up a storm over some hamburgers. The topic was classic cars and neither of them could resist testing each other to see who knew the most about cars. Benny had him beat by a mile. Dean punched his arm in defiance, “My dad passed down some mad car skills to me!”
"You see-" Dean shakes his head, "Unless it's a life of death situation, you don't really care about it- you treat everything so lightly, like it means nothing." Castiel stays silent, pensive. "You let everything roll off your back, Cas sometimes-" Castiel looks at him, "I feel like your job, your patients- are more important than
"Damn it- I told you to get decaf for me." Castiel gets up and with a handful of paper towels he cleans up the mess. "I had three."
underneath him, he pushes the older mans body off of himself so can stand up. He realizes it's all the
" I just wanna fuck Cas so get back here right now or else. " Dean stated. His fingers wrapped around himself.
That doesn't make things any easier and it doesn't wash away the rising guilt he's feeling. The rest of the drive to the teens school is done in silence, aside from the sound of the cars tires on the road.
He knocks on the bathroom door before walking inside, "We need to talk." opening the shower curtain. Dean's standing there, bubbles all over his body and his hair sticking up almost in a Mohawk.
"Tomorrow we shoot." Bobby finishes his milk, "Sorry I couldn't today, had to run into town. This woman I know-got something going with her. Well, her car ran outta gas in the middle of nowhere so I had to go save her."
Castiel picks up on a certain vibe, a vibe he was all too familiar with. Eventually as they eat dinner- without Dean- he notices a bruise on her wrist and his suspicions are confirmed that perhaps John Winchester was abusive towards his wife. That thought lingered in his mind for a while until John showed up, the guy smiled at them both and that thought was quickly forgotten.
Once the cookies are in the oven, baking, Dean keeps leaving the table where he was doing his homework to check on them. Every minute or so, he's getting up and pressing his nose into the ovens small window to have a peek inside and whines loudly when they still look like brown mush.
It's been months since she's been gone and he knows well enough to pretend that she doesn't exist because asking about
hours.
Dean laughs, "Kinda yea-" then admits, "-used to pin my little brother to the floor just like this so I could take his candy-" though he doesn't share more than that or he'd start crying right then and it was no place for tears.
He nods, "I get it Cas, I'm sorry for what I did." after a beat he asks "How did you stop?"
"You were still eating less than a boy your age should but yes, you were doing much better." he leans over to kiss his forehead before moving to clean up their mess, "I'm proud of you, anything you manage to eat successfully is a victory." Dean smiles, his cheeks turning pink. "Before we forget, take your damn vitamins." he hands him the bottle with a smirk on his face, "These will help, you'll feel better eventually."
Dean looks ahead as they walk, "Yea, me too-"
"What? You were the one talking about fucking-" Bobby opens the door to the room.
Dean nods, clearly slowing down on his chewing.
"I'm alive, Cas." Dean wraps his sleeved arms around himself. "Bring me anything good?" he looks at the empty grocery bags on the kitchen table.
Dean turns around to find the man wearing his glasses and looking down at a medical textbook in his hands. "Yea-" is all he mutters before he's left alone.
"Dean. Why?"
Dean pulls away, wiping away his tears with his small hands. "Promise?"
"Shut up-" he grits out, looking around casually. Castiel's hand reaches under the table and rubs the bulge in his pants. "-stop." his eyes close in pleasure, "I mean it-" his voice sounds weak. "Fuck-" he leans back against the cool booth, letting the man fondle his junk over his jeans.
As they get close to home Castiel parks up the road and pulls the teenager close for a deep lingering kiss that leaves him panting and hard in his jeans. "Mmm-" he mumbles against that sweet pink mouth. "You're beautiful baby." Dean looks down, blushing. "You make me crazy-" he kisses the boy once more. "-don't want anyone touching you like this but me." his large hand cups the boys hard on and rubs it through the thick denim.
Castiel is in Dean's bedroom simply
Dean smiles, "Sure-" and gets up because thins sounds like a date even if It's only movie night in the rec room. "Go on without me, I need to-" his eyes look at the toilet. The older man nods knowingly before leaving to give him some privacy.
"You didn't tell me to get any-" Castiel stands up and starts picking up the trash from the table.
"Suit yourself." It didn't worry him, he had been eating so well since he arrived that he had put on about five pounds. It looked good on him, one missed meal wouldn't kill him.
Dean looks at him, "Turn the light off, the fuck." And yet again, he looks like he just got woken up and its freaking Castiel out. Big time.
Castiel grows furious, "Great! I thought I told you not to lie to me-"
His blue eyes fixate on Dean's hard cock, it was just out there. "Well that doesn't hate me." he points to his dick. Dean rolls over in shame, hiding his face. "Yeah, you probably shouldn't roll over like that when you're naked unless you wanna get fucked." his tone is smug and it kinda turns him on.
"What-" the man smiles down at him. "Cat got your tongue?" his tone of voice is calm, deep and soothing.
"I'm sorry I forced myself on you." Castiel says.
Of course he wants Dean to grow up but it doesn't mean that it will be easy to let him do so. Castiel sighs longingly before closing the bedroom door behind him.
bag. "Let me-" his sentence goes unfinished before already lathering up his lovers body with the white substance.
Dean doesn't know why he's curious about this man, he doesn't even understand urges or desires yet and he's never touched himself before in his entire life. His best friend teased him for being a little too innocent.
Dean only turns it on louder, clearly not done with being a shit for the day. What's he gonna do, knock the door down? He knows Castiel is strong but he can't be
"That's enough for now. Okay." his voice breaking a bit, "We can discuss this more another day."
"What-what if he's marked me." Bobby and Castiel bark out a laugh, they have to cover their mouths so they don't laugh any more than that.
Dean worries his lip anxiously, "Yea, okay-" and steps inside the home- the screen door bumping painfully into his hip on the way in. Once inside the privacy of the kitchen, he lifts his shirt to see his midsection, noticing the bones on his body sticking out the slightest bit. Like they did
both..
Castiel swallows, catching his breath. "What was that-" he says finally. John shrugs, pulling out a cigarette from the nearly empty carton that was stashed away in his pants pocket. "I don't think I can drive-" he admits.
"Love you." Dean stays down there, pressing gentle kisses to the mans thigh. "Miss you-"
" Ok. " Castiel looked down. Shivering once.
"Mmmm-" Castiel bites his bottom lip, nodding. It's not long before he's coming everywhere, John had pulled off before then. "Fuck-" before he can regain his marbles, John is kissing him, shoving his tongue in his mouth and he moans into it. "Ugh-" the kiss is hot and it burns his face, the stubble on the older mans face was unrelenting.
"Guess his daddy made him that way-" Bobby says sadly. "M'sorry-" he holds out his beer can so they can
but maybe that's a little fucked up of them.
When he arrives at the Winchester house the front door quickly opens for him, "There you are-" John smiles down at him and Castiel leans into him, wrapping his arms around the mans body in a tight embrace. John gets flustered instantly, he wasn't used to being affectionate with another man. He's just happy Castiel is very attractive and easy on the eyes.
Dean sighs at the coolness in his chest and Castiel tucks him in for good this time before leaving his bedroom. He and John meet up in the hallway, "Didn't hear you come in-"
Castiel smiles warmly, "I Promise-" they hug again and for a long time. "I'll never
Dean had been sitting at the kitchen table with his homework stuff scattered in front of him and occasionally his green eyes would peek up at him every now and then. Although he didn't feel like talking about costumes right then, he couldn't resist his green eyes so Castiel calls him over.
"Yes?" Castiel answered his phone, it was only Ten in the morning and he was getting a call from Dean's school. This is never good. "I understand, I'll come get him." he sighs and begs to be let out early from his shift at the hospital and says he will make it up.
that leads to freedom.
Castiel closes the door with a chuckle because Kids are so unpredictable, you never know what's going to happen when they're around. When the boy emerges from the bathroom much later he feels his forehead once again to find that his temperature was completely normal again.
"Here's the quote-" the guy smiles, "He'll need to pay this before my guys start working-" and comes close enough to hand the teen a slip of yellow paper.
He opens the screen door for him to come through, "So I heard. Low this, low whatever. I'm dying right-" he says it sarcastically with an eye roll. When Castiel walks passed him- "Wait, you guys really think I'm dying?" he holds onto his arm.
"Dean." Castiel is at the table with a cup of coffee, looking  like he hadn't gone to bed at all. He
The rest of the day goes smoothly as it always did for Dean by Castiel's side. The teen is sitting up on his bunk waiting for Castiel to come in so they can get started on
Sam's studying him, "What?" Dean catches him, "Not like you haven't seen me half naked before, Sammy."
Eventually Castiel pulls away to ask him, "How's your stomach feeling?"
Dean eats his hash browns and eggs in silence, making a murder scene on his plate once again with the ketchup. He should probably mention that to the therapist. Whatever, it's not like he was some serial killer. Psychopath,
“Like that?” Dean grunted. “You make my dick so fucking hard.”
"Hang in there-" is all he says before giving him a kiss on the forehead, then getting into his car.
Castiel pulls up in front of the house, "Help me with the bags, Dean." and he does. Inside the home- Castiel's putting everything away on his own when Bobby comes into the kitchen to lend a hand. "Dean's mad about Gordon, yelled at some guy who looked at him the wrong way."
Castiel quickly devours all of the four buttered waffles and poorly made eggs. After gulping both his coffee and orange juice he sighs in enjoyment. Dean watched him the entire time, his mouth was almost open in shock but he knows how much Castiel can eat.
Although they both know that they really aren't
"Hey-" Castiel smiles at him and Dean runs down the hall.
Castiel blinks away the tears, not realizing when he had begun doing so. "Because you ran away!" his tone is loud, too loud. "You had me fucking worried!"
Dean whispers to her, "Can't find it-" Castiel assumes he means her bra.
Dean frowns after noticing how glossy his eyes suddenly looked and abandons his pancakes, leaving them to burn eventually. "What's wrong?" he comes close, hands on the mans face to look into his eyes for some kind of sign of pain or illness. "You okay?"
His face showed it, "I'm sorry, I'll stop."
Though it's proving to be impossible to get any rest with the teen groaning obnoxiously in the bathroom due to the amazing water pressure. Castiel lets him ramble on about it but eventually he has enough of it and stands up from the bed to knock on the bathroom door.
Those were the last worst Meg said before climbing into her car and Dean just watches her drive off down the dirt road until the car disappears. Once he can no longer see her vehicle, he goes inside to wait for Castiel to come home from work and he is by no means going to do any
"Boy, you better not think I'm stupid enough to believe any of what ya just said-" their eyes meet again and he knows he's busted. Bobby
Castiel swallows, not having an explanation for once. "Where you friggin' mad at me for something?" he shakes his head, "Then what, you never friggin' hurt me before Cas!" he pushes him.
for the next few days she leans in and kisses his cheek. "Dean Winchester, you saved my life today." He shrugs, blushing from the kiss his friend just gave him. "I'm serious, I haven't told my mom I started my period yet- she's been worried about me for years because I never started it and if she knew- she'd probably throw me a party-" She pokes him in the ribs, "-And invite you."
Dean's shivering in his post orgasm state and looking into his eyes, "Shit okay-"
After an hour of foreplay, hes halfway Inside when Dean groans - "Ugh, Cas. Stop." He struggles under him, "Stop! Get off me!" The sudden change scares him. He gets off him.
"Whats on your mind?"
"Dean, we need to talk."
Bobby stands up and pulls his nephew into a tight hug. When the teen sobs between apologies he has to put an end to it, "Shh-" his large hand rubs up and down his back to soothe him. "I ain't goin' to change ya-" he pulls away, "I just want ya to know that ya got more options than just Cas-"
Dean rushed over, almost tripping and let himself fall on the couch next to Castiel. "Well, hello to you too."
"You've always been so submissive-" the older man comments right before he dives in to lick his pink hole. "Mmm-"
"He's in here somewhere-"
Castiel knows the teen very well and knows the water works are coming, "Baby-" leans forward to press kisses on that sweet face. "Don't cry, everything's alright-" the teen nods, trying to not let his tears come out.
He was Thirteen now and getting kissed by a girl still didn't interest him one bit. He's more interested in his best friend Sam, it was his day and he wanted to go play after school- they had plans to go to the park as usual for an unfair game of basketball. It was unfair to Dean because he was a giant for still being Twelve- Sam was only a few months younger than him. They were more like
"Why? You find something?" Dean asks loudly out of fear.
he's done enough damage for one night.
Castiel chuckles softly, his hands rubbing the teens fully erect cock that was hidden behind denim. "Does this feel good?" he asks in his ear.
His uncle has the phone to his ear, waiting for his pastor Jim
"Really?" Castiel asks him, looking over at him.
"You didn't drink anything-" the man smiles before leaning down to press his lips against the teens softly and admits, "But I feel drunk too-" when he pulls away.
Castiel nods in agreement, ghosts generally don't scare him but the ghost of John Winchester sure as
Later on in the day Castiel was sitting at a table with his scary gang of friends during rec time. Dean abandons his only other friend,
but his uncle would have to do for now.
"That's kind of you-" he sighs, "But it's not on you to take care of everything yourself-" there's a pause. "You're eighteen but that doesn't mean you need to jump in and take on more responsibility than you're able to handle-"
"You better come in-" Bobby finally calls to them from behind the screen door, "We're gettin' a bad storm up here soon-" Castiel gets up as if to leave, "You're stayin' Cas, you don't have a basement."
Castiel slaps him on the arm playfully, "Don't be rude-" and tries not to laugh at the bluntness.
Castiel blinks,
When the day is over, he's sitting in his car thinking about what happened with the nineteen year old dancer. Before he knows it he finds himself in that very same strip club, asking the manager for Alex. Castiel knows he's being creepy but he can't help it- the guy was hot.
Dean smiles, "Four more weeks." slowly his smile fades. "Dad's been gone a long time...where do you think he is?"
"You got-" he covers his mouth to hide his laughter. "-ketchup on your shirt." Dean goes red in the face and starts wiping at it with napkins. "Here baby-" Castiel gets a napkin wet and starts rubbing it away and it comes off, luckily his shirt was black and it wasn't obvious. "It's okay baby, don't freak out." Dean's eyes are red like he wants to cry. "Baby, stop."
"I thought I wasn't going to see you again-" it was a little dramatic but she's used to her patients vanishing all of a sudden when therapy becomes too much to handle.
It's official, he's not going to be married this week.
The chores are completely forgotten for the rest of the afternoon and eventually Bobby comes home from being in town all day and he's probably wondering why there were still leaves scattered all over the place.
The teen doesn't want
"Dad didn't get me anything for school-" he blinks, pouting.
Dean shivers, his hands now tugging on his stepfathers belt. "Take these off-" he asks quietly, "I
By now he's already apologized to Robin and once she cooled off, she volunteered to be his fake girlfriend once more. It was one less thing he had to worry about.
is waiting for him in the dark.
"And that's how it's done-" Castiel pulls out carefully, Dean's asshole twitches around the girth as if not wanting to let go of it. "Give it a few more years, you'll be able to do the same." he smacks his ass gently.
"Hmm?" Dean blinks. "Somethin' wrong? Is it Bobby?"
Dean looks over his shoulder, eyes half open and he's moaning a string of
"We must have-" he looks at Dean's hands and for a moment they look dirty- before he blinks. They're clean. "Think I'm still drunk-" he chugs his coffee too.
Dean nods wearily, "Sorry." the adults share a look before they all hop into the truck. It's a quiet ride back and none of them mind. When Dean spends all day in the guest bedroom without so much as going to the kitchen for water- they worry.
"DEAN!" The boy screamed in terror. "You have a real mouth on you. You can't just ask me that. " He looked up into the green eyes.
Dean hears them laughing in the hallway a few minutes later. "Dad-" he calls out pretty loudly. John opens the door, peeking inside to see what his son could possibly want at this hour.  The man simply tells him to brush his fucking teeth and get to bed already.
"So how you feelin'-" John asks once Castiel has settled in completely. They're laying in bed relaxing after another long day.
"Gonna walk Cas to his car." Dean says once they're done with their meal, Bobby nods. Dean and Castiel walk through the screen door and down the porch steps. "I love you." Dean looks up at him with tears in his eyes. "You better call me-"
Bobby wishes he'd done something about it a long time ago, but hell, he'd been afraid of the man too. The best he could do was leave the door open for Dean if he ever needed a place to stay, or if he ever ran away. Secretly, it's what he wished for more than anything- he wanted Dean Winchester to run away from home and come find him. The teen would have been welcomed with open arms, it was never a question.
"So-" the man ends the kiss first, pulling away. "Going to bed?"
Brady leans against Cassie, "You owe me, Winchester." Dean licks his lips, "Your dad paid me for the parts but- you know that other thing you just can't seem to go without?" Dean sniffles as if on cue, "Yeah, that thing. It costs a lot of money-"
Dean shakes his head and mumbles, "Bet you don't know that sometimes I wanna get slapped and fucked with my hands tied behind my back-" which is instantly regretted, it just slipped out. His
Dean sighs, pushing his nearly full bowl away. "Cas slept over-" the man looks over his shoulder from where he stands in front of the stove. "Nothin' happened-" his uncle is still looking at him. "We made out a lil'-"
"Dean!" he calls out. Soon enough the teen appears from the hall away, annoyed that he was even beckoned. "We're playing bingo, sit down." Dean gives him a look of-
Dean nods, "Yea-" there's a short pause. "I'm sorry Robin can't stay away from me-"
Castiel inhales a nervous breath, "Those are butterflies, Dean-"
Dean is listening, searching his eyes for truth and it's found. "I'm still scared-" he swallows the knot in his throat. "I don't want things to change-"
"Hmm-" Castiel hums and brings over the sandwiches. "Eat up-" he says and takes a seat, joining the boy in his meal. "So-" he begins, "How did your first day of school go?"
good-" his eyes do a complete 180 eye roll in his head because his bunk mate thinks too highly of himself. "That guys got issues to come back to the guy that
Dean and Castiel had come to an understanding- he would be going over to Robin's every other day so she could help him with his school work. The catch is- Robin's mother has to come pick him up, he won't be allowed to take any of their cars and certainly go nowhere on his own. It's just the beginning of his punishment for breaking their trust- Castiel is thinking of how else to punish him, he's not very good at being strict but if he wants him to shape up then he's going to have to try.
"It seems like you get bored with me and you want to use threesomes as an excuse to be with someone else-" instantly he regrets saying all of that too. The look of hurt on Dean's face is too much to bare, knowing he caused it. "-sorry, I'm just jealous- I don't like sharing you." Dean stays quiet. "I just want us to just be us- no one else Dean, is that too much to ask you for?"
Castiel smiled, " We kid's go to Starbucks...These day's. "
His stomach growls once more and he has no other choice but to go find out why those damn sandwiches never got delivered to his room. The kitchen was empty, his eyes look around to find the soft amber glow of a fire outside the window that he quickly follows outside. Castiel was standing over the grill, plating a few hot dogs before looking up to met his gaze.
The bearded man blinks away the redness from his eyes, "Alright, son-" and that melts the teens heart a little bit.
Castiel chuckles, "Sorry about that, kind of a last minute thing-" the teen looks up at him warily, "Don't tell me you were scared-" before nuzzling into his chest again. "I'm sorry baby-"
Dean hesitates because the guy wants him to be his prison
move and it goes unrealized by the both of them, probably for the best.
The man smiles warmly and moves to plant a kiss on his forehead, "Of course I want my boyfriend to live with me-" and the teen nods, looking away because he feels all
Dean sits, "What if I sleep walk farther next time-"
Castiel was floored.
"I know, just- Fuck." Dean bites his lip, Castiel pushes his cock in a little further- he's now taking in three thick inches. "Ugh..."
Dean fucking
Derek smiles proudly, "Dental Hygienist-" and walks towards his car, opening the door. "But I'll be a dentist soon." he smiles once again, flashing his pearly whites. The guy really did have white ass teeth, Dean kind of thinks his two front teeth make him look like a bunny.
Dean reaches over to feel his forehead, "You're warm-"
"Please-" Castiel tries to stop her in her tracks. "Don't."
Castiel sits down next to her and fully intends on saying
Dean shuffles into the kitchen right then and yells, "I want waffles!"
Dean sat next to Castiel after his shower, not waking him and decided to keep watch for a while. His eyes go from watching his step dad sleep peacefully next to him- to the weather girl on the screen. He wouldn't admit it but the weather girl was hot, he leans back and enjoys watching her prance around the screen- pointing at the map of the county they were in. His gaze shifts down, he's got a boner popping up in his boxers. The floorboards rattle again and instantly the boner is gone.
Once Dean's tucked into bed yet again, he gives him some Motrin on a spoon and the boy makes a face as he chokes on it dramatically. "Oh please, it's not that bad-" he rolls his eyes, a smile on his face.
Soon the mismatched couple are arguing about everything and laying it all on the table for God and their neighbors to see if they so choose to come outside to see the scene that the two adults are causing.
"Well yea, if I wanna do that auto tech program I have to get better." Castiel listen's intently, "God-" Dean sighs dramatically, rubbing his hand on the back of his head. "What the hell happened to me. I was fine- I swear I was fine-I know I had my problems with food but I never-fuck."
He was alone in bed, “Ughhhh.”  Castiel groaned, getting up to find him and calling out “Dean?” once more. He walked down the hall in darkness as best he could in search of the man. Where is he…
Now he wonders what else has changed around his uncles house since he was five.
"One beer." Castiel nods and goes to the couch. Dean takes his stuff and goes to his bedroom.
Castiel laughs, "I've been right here, don't know much closer we can get." He did know, but he couldn't go that far. Of course he couldn't.
Castiel's eyes flicker down to the boys lips for a quick second before looking into his eyes again. "So, breakfast?"
Dean pouts while tears sting his eyes and makes grabby hands at his angry father who only walks out of the room without saying a single word. The quick departure only serves to upset him more in his very confused state and cries loudly because of it.
Dean stood outside the bathroom door ten minutes later with a glass of water, and a frown on his face. He felt like the biggest jerk on the planet for trying to manipulate Castiel into sucking his dick, only to make him puke his guts out afterwards. He made a mental note of Castiel's gag reflex.
"Let's get back to our room- fucking on the beach isn't as sexy as it seems." Castiel winks, "Too much sand." Dean blushes and they hold hands all the way back to their room. Once inside, Castiel shuts the door and locks it. Dean plops down on the large bed, on his stomach. He's tired from laying out in the sun most of the day- his eyes close when he feels Castiel pulling him to the foot of the bed by his ankles. It makes him whimper.
he's whimpering softly, biting his lip. After a few minutes of stroking himself, he knows he's getting close. He's feeling hot and he's been panting. Dean was so into what he was doing he completely forgot to plug in his headphones and didn't notice the video was quite loud.
hurt me-" he listens to the lies a while longer. "-you tried to hit him!" he shouts, accidentally waking the boy who was by his side on the sofa. "Sorry-" he whispers to the boy. "-I don't know anymore, you're scaring me." he admits and in a way he's trying to secretly break up with the guy. Though he doesn't want to leave Dean alone with this monster.
Benny smiled, “I like you too Dean, It’s been a pleasure having you here.”
For a while it did look like they were a happy little family of three. Dean completely forgot what happened the previous evening and Castiel almost did, at least he tried to forget because he didn't want to actually break up with the guy and move out, mostly because of his wonderful son.
Castiel smiles, he's not angry. "Charlie, Sam, Jack- oh and you wanted for us to fuck Pamela together."
Dean starts the shower before getting in, "You know I'm needy, that's all it was-" and begins to lather up his body. "Now get out, I need some privacy-" he flicks some of the suds his way and Castiel leaves the bathroom before he gets the chance to hit him in the eyes. Dean stays in the shower almost an hour, just thinking about everything that's happened recently. When he finally steps out, he towel dries his short hair and his eyes begin to admire his step fathers things on the bathroom counter.
Dean bites his lip awkwardly, walking over to the couch, stepping over Castiel's letgs in order to sit down somewhat next to him. "Nerd."
"Eggs, ya idiot-"
Dean reaches over to feel his forehead, it felt normal. "You're not sick, what's wrong?" there's obvious concern in his voice and he's talking to him like his uncle wasn't there and Bobby only observes their interaction as a by stander.
"That'll work." Alex takes his wallet and helps himself to the cash. "I really hope you come back-" he smiles, counting his money before leaving.
"What's wrong?" Castiel asks him, reaching over to kiss him on the lips now that it was dark enough in this parking lot and no one was walking by the car. "Tell me-"
"What's all this?" he looks through everything, pretending that it all didn't just come at the perfect time. His commissary was running low and he hadn't been eating all too well in the cafeteria. I mean, who wants to eat
Dean walks over to him and Castiel turns him around by his shoulders so he can see his ass again. The man groans, he gives a squeeze. To his surprise, he liked it. "Fucking gorgeous.." Castiel complements, giving him a gentle spank. Dean gasps. "Fucking love this, Dean-" Castiel's breathless, his large hands squeezing Dean's fleshy cheeks.
"How was that sweetheart?" he asks, and it sounds almost forced. Basically because it was. John gets up to go wash his hands in the kitchen almost instantly.
"Shut up before I shut you up." Bobby huffs, he was wringing his hands on his lap with all the nerves he was feeling. "Yea- I'm excited-" he finally says. They arrive back home in a few short hours and Bobby heads into town to see his
Castiel has to ask "You okay?" as he pulls off his uniform top so that he stands in only a white undershirt and khakis. The teen nods somberly and he goes to the sink to brush his teeth before going to bed. Quickly he manages to notice the love bite on his neck that he somehow missed earlier, "You little shit-" his tone is angry, making the teen sit up on his bunk.
Dean shrugs, "Goodnight kiss." he leans in closer, "C'mon." and proceeds to kiss the man when he nods his agreement.
He shrugs, "I guess I could-"
Bobby chuckles, "My nephew is in love with a man-" and the teen gives him a shy but sad smile. "Take these-" he leans over, handing the teen the two paper bags with their car items. "-and go wait for me out back, gonna teach ya how to put in a pair of spark plugs-"
"Yea." Dean smiles and gets out, he wasn't really offended by that comment he was just
"Fuck I'm sorry-" Dean holds onto him even tighter. "Sorry you stayed with that piece of shit-"
Dean blew out all of his candles after making a wish, surprisingly he didn't forget to this time around. This year was a big improvement to the last few years and can only hope for a bright future from here on out.
"What should I call you-" while thinking of a name, he takes a seat Indian style on the floor right in front of the box.
She leans back in her chair, her pen is ready to write.
It's so not thrilling to see the mechanic in place of that sweet face that belongs to his son. The relationship between them feels like it's fizzling out at warp speed, maybe because his attention is focused elsewhere. Like on sweet little Dean Winchester.
"Yea!" Dean laughs, "I wrote so much today my hand hurts-" he holds up his slightly chubby hand for Castiel to see, it makes him laugh. "But we did some coloring." he pulls out a math work sheet with shapes on it. "Look." he gives it to the older man.
Dean snorts, "So what-" he stands up and begins pacing, biting the skin on the edge of his thumb. "You gonna be with her then? Are you straight now? Is that what you're fuckin' tellin' me-"
Castiel holds him tighter, "I'll do my best to make you happy, baby."
By now, Ash thinks he knows Castiel very well. He knows that the guy likes books, loves coffee and has a nightly skincare routine because he's getting a little older
Maybe an hour or two later in the deep darkness of the bedroom Castiel is being rolled over onto his stomach and John is grinding up against his clothed bottom.
"Hey!" he calls. Dean turns around, walking back up. "Wasn't expecting you-"
Castiel Inhales shakily with a slight nod, not bothering to respond right now because he's loving on the teens neck right now. "Mmm-" he rumbles from deep within his chest instead and sucks a big fat hickie right there on the pale flesh for the whole world to see tomorrow.
"Your favorite color is-" Dean looks confused, "Beige?" Castiel laughs, nodding. "But beige is boring."
Castiel sips his beer, "He's been alright-"
The fact that he didn't break something climbing over the fence at the speed that he did was a miracle in itself. When he sees that his uncle was sitting out on the front porch with a soda in his hand, the nerves kick in. Because Bobby was waiting for him to come home and already knowing where he was the whole time, because where else would his nephew be?
"That's really sad."
Castiel rolls the condom on, "Where?" he looks around. Dean goes to the couch and he hesitates, shaking his head. "Not there-"
"I better get going. It's been a long day-" he stands suddenly because he needs some space, "I'll call tomorrow to check in-"
Before he comes, Castiel pulls out carefully and spills all over Dean's exposed back. "Fuck." he groans, once his orgasm has passed he slides the head of his cock back into Dean's hole.
"Say it baby." he reaches over to hold his hand.
"They're for us-" Castiel hides them in the nightstand. "-when we get back together." they're eyes meet and he can tell the teen doesn't buy it. "Who else would I have sex with? Meg isn't here for me to-"
Castiel frowns in concern, "Are you okay?" then takes a sip of his lovers drink in curiosity and coughs. "They put alcohol in yours by mistake-" but his love looks so happy and carefree that it has him laughing. "Baby, are you sure you're okay?" he says between fits of their combined laughter.
and tries not to get jealous until that boy kisses his cheek. He huffs a soft laugh, shaking his head. "Asshole-" and he's got to look away from them before he loses it again. Solitary wasn't worth it.
"Just like old times-"
It was proving to be fun, seeing each other like this. There was no drama or fighting, only good times.
Dean whimpers helplessly over the belt in his mouth for no reason except that it feels hot to pretend that he's actually gagged. "Hmm, hmm, hmm-" his whimper sounds so sweet and pure. "Agh-" the man removes the belt from his mouth, admiring the teeth marks and saliva that were left on it.
"Sorry about that-" there's movement on his end of the line. "Have a good day baby?" the word slips out, "Well, did you?"
Dean quickly stands, holding his hands up like she's the police.
"Took ya long enough." he mumbles, pulling bags and placing them in the car. "Tell me you went to the bathroom already-" they look at each other, "Don't wanna be stoppin' every five minutes cause one of ya has to pee. Let's go!"
Dean swore,
me ever again." his voice cracks, his cool facade now gone. "Please baby-"
"Damn it Cas!" Dean runs after him, he catches up in no time and beats the older man- he makes it to the front porch first. "I won!"
the one that has him quickly shutting up.
in his relationship with Dean. He's so desperate to move forward with his life and get to the next phase of it already but his boyfriend is so young and needs more time to get himself mentally and emotionally ready.
Dean doesn't respond to her apology, he just orders. "I want-" he makes a kissy face, while looking at the menu. "A double cheese burger and fries-" Robin nods, "-and a coke." she nods again, taking their orders and leaving them be.
Now that they're alone Dean can have his present. Castiel places a shopping bag next to his bowl of lucky charms one morning, "Surprise."
After hanging up his new shirts in the small closet and folding up all his new pants and putting them away in the dresser drawers he lets himself fall onto his bed.
"You two don't want to take some food home?" Castiel looks at them both.
Maybe Dean Winchester will end up loving him too, but that's unlikely. The boy is young, has his whole life ahead of him, there's no way he will waste it moping over some guy who made him his bitch in prison for two years. It's time to break it off, distance himself from the boy- at least for a while, keep him on his toes. Dean's not the only boy he's had under his thumb in here, there's been at least a handful of them.
Dean hiccups with an adorable smile on his face, "S'my birthday dude-" then frowns. "You haven't told me you loved me today-" the water works are coming because he's just that much of a light weight.
Dean gets into bed yet again alongside him, running his fingers through his wet hair. "Who died on the operating table?" he whispers the question.
"I probably would-" his hips keep buckling upwards on their own every now and then. "I would worship the ground you walked on, you're so bad-" his breath stutters. "I love it when you're bad-" and his large hands try to sneak their way underneath the teens shirt to feel some skin, but his hands are slapped away gently.
"I believe you-" Castiel's brows knit together in his own confusion, "I mean, I heard someone calling my name. Honestly I thought you were trying to pull a prank on me-until I saw someone in my house. At least I think I did-"
The teen quickly slips into the loose fitting shirt and boxers that had been laid out for him before crawling into bed next to Castiel. He sighs happily and snuggles into his back, spooning him.
"Seriously?" he resists the urge to laugh once again. "Well, I think there's a psychological reason behind all this. Maybe you're-"
Dean takes a minute to think about it, "No. I started it-" she asks how. "I always wanted hugs-" he hesitates, "-kisses- I wanted someone to love me." a tear rolls down his cheek. "-I wanted him to love me."
Eventually Castiel says, "Let's go brush our teeth, yeah?" after their bowls were empty. Dean nods and they go to the bathroom together, leaving the door wide open as they brush their teeth. Castiel yawns, then Dean yawns as well like it was contagious. "And you, you need to be in bed already-" He guides the tired boy to his room.
"We don't live together anymore, you don't see everything that happens with me-" Dean says sadly, looking up at him.
"Why is there like-" his eyes are looking at all the pink and blue boxes of pee sticks. "A million of these?"
Castiel breathed in, he stepped off the bed so he could drop his jeans and boxers. He turned around. All he heard was a single groan from Dean at the sight. He hadn't noticed when the man got behind him, "Bend over the bed for me." Castiel obeyed. His milky white fingers clutching at the sheets.
Dean takes his usual seat and quickly digs into the ham and cheese sandwich, his favorite. Castiel toasted the bread and put it in the microwave to have the cheese all gooey just the way he liked it. "Mm-mm-mm-" he sings, almost dancing in his seat. When he notices blue eyes on him, the happy dance ends abruptly like he was going to be in trouble for something
Suddenly he's aware again that Dean's still shirtless and sweaty.
Castiel lifts the covers to let him in bed, "So, three times today."
Dean trembles, "Think I'm finally hungry.." he smiles, "Like really hungry."
"Should I be-" the confidence to ask such a thing came from somewhere, "Is he your boyfriend?"
Dean's standing by the entrance to the church while he waits for his friend to show up. Eventually he sees the boy running up the church steps and he waves him down, not like anyone could miss Dean Winchester. The teen had a unique look to him, pretty but rough around the edges. They fist bump and go inside towards class together.
"Bye Honey." he kisses one of his fellow nurses, Meg, on the cheek. "I'll see you tomorrow." and off he goes, exiting the double doors of the hospital for what he hopes is an eventful evening with his new boyfriend.
Dean yells, "Wooo!" at his favorite girl when she gets on stage at midnight. Yes, they've been here that long.
Castiel's panting, hand on his chest- his heart was racing a mile a minute. "Thought I saw-" he exhales, his head hitting the pillow. "let's just get some sleep-"
Dean's body is stiff like it's his way of rejecting the embrace. "Is somethin' wrong with me-" the question sounds rigid, almost angry.
Castiel looks around briefly, "Like drugs?" there's a quiet pause between them. "If you're on drugs you won't feel much of anything-"
Castiel tries his best to blink the tears away but they manage to still roll down his cheeks. "Please don't do this-" be pleads with the boy in front of him. "Please-"
"Bobby, where the hell are you-" he hears his voice calling from out back, probably needed his help with a car. He pushes open the back screen door, no sign of his uncle. "Bobby?" he asks.
He didn't know if he should. This was too tempting. It wasn't until he heard " Take off your jacket. " that Dean snapped back to attention  and did as he was told. " And your shoes. " Castiel eyed him up and down, maybe he was the one who was more tempted to take thing's further.
"You're not understanding me, Cas-" his breathing stutters and wipes his damp eyes with the sleeve of his shirt. "I want you to be both-" now the guys confused. "I want you to be like, my dad and my boyfriend-"
Dean laughs, "His mom already came to pick him up, she needed his help with grocery shopping. She's a single mom so...you know."
a string of soft moans start coming from his mouth repeatedly. "Ugh
"Cause-" he kicks the door wide open and Castiel has to take a step back so it doesn't hit him. "-I can't even eat right."
"Still scared of me?"
- he'd give Dean a few hits of his joint whenever they saw each other. Both Bobby and Castiel simply thought Dean was going into town to see Robin at the diner but instead he had been meeting up with this new friend. Dean and Brady met at
"I miss this little baby hole so much-" the head of Castiel's cock presses against the hole, easing it's way in- "Did you miss my cock baby, hmm?" once the head pops in, the rest just follows and slides in fully until he's balls deep in the teenagers ass.
Castiel nods and looks as if he had just lost a simple game of poker or something. "My apologies-" he says regretfully before stepping out of the closet and leaving the door wide open behind him.
The boy sniffles, wiping his nose on the sleeve of his jacket. "I'm cold-" his voice is so
"Fine, Ma'm. Jo around? She hasn't answered my calls-" he's aware he's being a bit possessive but he can't help it. He feels all primal towards her now that he's been inside her.
"Yeah-" Castiel exhales heavily, licking his lips and gets the desire to do something he really shouldn't. "Can I kiss you?"
Thought tonight something goes wrong, that migraine he got doesn't go away even after a few aspirin. Worse yet, as the night goes on he's got the chills and shakes and it's not long before he's sneaking into Castiel's room to complain that he doesn't feel well. "Cas- wake up-" he shoves the sleeping man in his own bed. "Wake up damn it-"
"Yeah, that's how we met-" Castiel sighs over his cup of coffee- Bobby wouldn't let him drink any more than he had already. "-started some bar fight, ended up in the ER where I was working-I thought he was-" he pauses for a second. "-different."
Castiel's eyebrows shoot up in surprise at how long he's been married, "Well-" he laughs. "-I knew you were married, caught the ring on your finger right away."
Dean moans again, struggling against the handcuffs.
Castiel's brushing his teeth that morning in the bathroom when he notices something, a pair of Scooby Doo underwear in the trash. After rinsing his mouth out with water he goes to the boys room.
"Are you gonna be sick?" Castiel held his shoulders to steady him.
"He'd been erratic-nothing he said was makin' sense."
"Butter in the eggs-" Bobby smiles proudly.
Castiel smiles, "I'll take these-"
Dean waves him off, "We have extra, my uh-dad-bought the whole store." he stands and the stray puppy tries to follow him inside, "Stay here-" he enforces. When he comes back he hands the kid a grocery bag with a whole carton of eggs and a pack of toilet paper.
Dean fills the tub with warm water and slides in carefully after removing his oil stained clothing, groaning loudly until he's comfortable against the cold bathtub. "Aghh-" he sighs, the water splashes a bit every time he moves.
When they're back on the road Castiel says, "Claire's mother told me she had been adopted by a wonderful family, I'm not going to disrupt her entire life by finding her." Dean nods and they stay silent the whole ride back home.
It took him several minutes but he finally shuffles into the kitchen barefoot, "The fuck are you doing here-" Dean's blinking the sleepiness away from his eyes and scratching his stomach - he always does that when he's hungry.
he can't play with me for a month-" exhales loudly in frustration.
Castiel sits next to him on the bottom bunk, "Here baby-" and secretly shows him a cigarette before pocketing it. "Tomorrow in the yard, we'll go smoke-" then he taps his cheek.
It's mid November and not much has changed in the Winchester home. John is still sweet on occasion, though he's still rough around the edges more often than not.
Dean nods, shoving the last french fry into his mouth. "I know-don't worry, we're not doin' anything-" he lies again, Bobby sighs with relief. "So, can we go?" he asks impatiently.
"Ugghhh-" Castiel groans and he begins thrusting upwards on the teens ass coming down on him- Dean didn't even have to do any of the work. He must have yanked on the cuffs a little too hard because they broke off his wrists and instantly wraps his arms around the teen- rolling them over so now Dean's on his back.
Dean shivers, "Stop-" and licks his lips once their bodies make contact. "Oh God, stop-" he shakily pleads before dry lips press against his own in a soft kiss. "Cas-"
"I always miss you-" Dean admits, snuggling into the older mans chest. After a moment he confesses, "Cas-" Castiel nods, listening. "-do you think I have abandonment issues?"
Dean doesn't even look at him, he feels like he's about to die- he's never even been hung over before but if this is what it's like he's never getting drunk. "Not now Cas."
"Ugh-" Dean moans as he tries to ride Castiel's cock, it's somehow been freed by one or the other- Sam kisses his neck and shoulders while Dean eases down on the girth that is his step father. "So fucking big-"
Walking around the store carrying a basket, he was picking up apple's, testing their firmness and putting them back. He never got any apple's but kept doing that along with the avocado's, pear's and cucumber's. Dean Winchester was wearing casual clothing this time.
with his fathers friend because they always had fun together. Even if all they really did was watch bad movies while they scarfed down some food, it's still the most fun he's ever had with his own dad.
He plops down on the broken chair in front of his little desk that he's had since forever. He's about to open a comic when his closet door creaks. Dean turns to find a man dressed in all black- indeed wearing a ski mask and gloves. He notices a knife when he looks down at the guys hand and  almost doesn't believe it's Castiel, if it wasn't for those damn electric blue eyes he would have ran for it by now.
Dean pauses, looking up at the menu. Sam takes notice of how his hand travels up under his hoodie, he's touching his stomach, pursing his lips in a kissy face. "Hmm...what do I want-go ahead ma'm." he says at the lady behind him. Still thinking, "I don't know Sam, you order first." he hands his friend a five dollar bill so he can get his milkshake. Dean goes over to the tables and he sits down, still thinking and looking at the menu at the front. He's squinting.
"So, I'm just supposed to read your mind about the things you want!" he yells back and it hurts the teens ears. "Look, I'm sorry alright. I know I shouldn't yell at you." Dean shrugs, looking at the television screen. "Baby please-"
"What's wrong?" He's pressed up against the older man, Castiel's got him by the arms and he can't get away. "You don't miss me baby?" That words makes him melt right against him and soon enough they're french kissing again- their tongues rubbing against each other while they make out. It's only kissing but both of them are moaning as if they're having sex. Castiel pulls away because he's already rock hard and Dean knew, it had been poking his tummy for the last ten minutes. "Need you-" he breathes.
I really liked her."
When the party is over, they're walking out of the church when his eyes find Claire again in the midst of people. She was walking down the steps with a woman that clearly wasn't his ex, Amelia. Maybe this girl wasn't his daughter after all and it was probably the best outcome for this situation since he'd given up on that dream a long time ago.
If he sees Castiel, he will lose his shit. Maybe he'll cry, maybe he'll try to kick the guys ass. Luckily, there was no sign of him and he's able to eat his food in peace at the kitchen table. Bobby was out back working but didn't come in to bother him or ask for his help.
Dean puts down his half eaten sandwich, "Wanna go back to sleep-" he yawns.
it's a total 180 of emotions.
The boy quickly comes over and sits right beside him, they huddle in close. "You hate them too?" he asks the kid, looking over at the other boys in the class. The boy nods, "What's your name? Don't think you told me."
Castiel shivers- "Always."
Bobby clears his throat before Dean can respond, "You know- you two could always stay here with me. I could use the help-but if you need your space, there's a house for rent about a mile from here."
The teen grabs the book that was on the mans lap, flipping through the pages mindlessly. "Think reading all these books is gonna do somethin'-" then throws it across the bedroom. "You're a dweeb, Cas-" his voice is getting louder. "A fucking geek-" the mans chest is rising and falling heavily. "Bet ya never got laid in high school huh-"
"What kind of books?" he's curious because the boy isn't much for reading unless there's pictures.
In the middle of the game John got a call from the shop, asking him to come in for an hour just to finish up a car since the client insisted he needed the car done by the end of the day.
Dean finally looks up, "Thank you-" and steps closer to the man without any fear. "I'm grateful- you know, for everything."
"It's friggin' pink-" he states when Castiel walks in covered in sweat. Dean then he looks over and checks him out, "Hmm, I like it." Castiel smiles, pulling him in for a quick kiss. "Can we go now-" Dean mumbles, eye's half closed after the kiss. "-I'm tired."
Dean crouches down and rolls his uncle over, to find him blinking the drunk slumber from his eyes. "You scared us-" he says with a heavy sigh, hands trembling on the mans flannel covered shoulders. "The fuck you doin' drinking? Doctor said not to and you know it-"
"Good as new." he's crouching down low enough to meet the boys green eyes, Castiel looks into them for few seconds too long before standing up. If he stared into them any longer he might just get lost in those emerald gems and never be able to claw his way out.
The bearded man shrugs and takes a bite of his sandwich, "He called to check on you this mornin'-"
"One room-" Castiel rubs the back of his neck nervously. It's not like they know who he's with or who he's bringing into said room he's going to pay for. "-don't know how long I'll be here but I'll pay for the whole night." the manager nods, taking his debit card and swiping it before handing it back along with the keys to room number nine.
Brady steps away, hands in his pocket like they had just been goofing and talking cars. Dean straightens up his jacket before exiting the store with a whole lot of anger and shame weighing heavy in his stomach. He leaves the auto store without saying anything and Brady just gets back to work, Bobby seems to put the fear of God in him for some reason. It's something he's going to have to remember, just in case.
" his voice cracks. "You know I hate her-"
Now that he's almost done with his meal he continues the conversation, "I woke up feeling strange-" their eyes meet from across the table. "I had been hearing things all night and-" he's about to give more information but decides against it. "-just weird things have been happening. I don't really remember the past week."
He asks, "Are you feeling better?" and wraps an arm around the boys shoulder to keep his safe and warm.
Castiel stopped his car by Bobby's fence so Dean could go in after their day together- soon realizing the truck isn't parked out front. "He's not home-" Dean says, "I don't have a key-" Castiel shrugs and drives up to his place instead, Dean could wait for Bobby here. Any time they could spend together was welcomed. "Bobby didn't tell me he was goin' out."
"There's a reason why doctors don't treat their family members-" right then and there Dean leans forward and plants a kiss on his lips, it's so soft and sweet that he feels like he's going to melt right there on his bed. "Dean-" he sighs, his hand runs up and down the teens leg. "I love you so much-" Dean kisses him again, this time his tongue comes out to play inside of the older mans mouth and he enjoys every second. After a while he pulls away, "That's enough, don't want to get sick-"
Dean nods, still upset. "When?" and that makes Gabriel laugh. "What's so funny?"
Dean shakes his head, moving over to one side of the bed to make more room for the older man. "No, I like it-" Castiel opens the book and is about to begin reading when the boy says. "You have to get in-"
"No shit Sherlock-" Dean kicks at the screen door before plopping down the couch in the living room. "Now I gotta fuckin' wait for it to stop-" Castiel knew this was an excuse to stay because there was an umbrella in the kitchen closet he must have seen plenty of times by now and could easily take it with him.
new pet. "This time you get to keep him-" the words are spoken tenderly.
No fucking way, he can't get married today because his uncle could have a heart attack after what happened last time.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean scratches his nose, "You're welcome-" eyes looking over to the mess under the tree, "Did you get something for dad?"
"Dean that makes me so happy, you don't even know...There's nothing more than I'd like than for you and Sam to stay here."
Castiel groans, pulling the older man down until he falls on top of his body- wrapping his arms around his neck just to have something to hold onto. "Ugh- yes-"
Castiel nods and stands up straight, towering over the teen. "Yeah-" he looks away. "Was it the type of porn I watch upsetting to you or-"
"If you kissed her now, do you think you'd feel something?" Castiel asks, "The interest in girls comes on suddenly, you never know when it will happen."
Dean wipes his eyes on his uncles flannel, not that the man would mind because he's seen him in worse conditions that this. "I know-" their eyes meet. "Part of me wants to explore them, but Cas-"
Dean whines in his throat but nodding in agreement anyway because something was better than nothing. "What can we do-" their lips lightly brush against each other
Dean's cheek is pressing against harshly against the floor as he whimpers like an injured puppy. "Ugh-ugh-mm-" continues strings of adorable sounds escape his parted lips.
Castiel takes a seat at the table, not knowing if he and Dean were on good terms or not since they weren't exactly speaking every day. "Hello Dean-" his eyes are averted, keeping to himself because the teens uncle was standing by the stove, cooking.
The teen gets another surprise in the morning, Castiel actually sits down and has his breakfast with him.
Robin being the supportive friend she is says, "But whyyy-" and sits up on the bed. "I like him, he's so nice-" a moment passes. "And he's so cute, for an old guy-"
Dean grabs the magazine, cigarette between his dry lips and sucks. "Big tits-" and exhales as he sits down on the bed. "Mind if I borrow this one?"  he flips through the pages mindlessly, cigarette hanging loosely between his lips. "I kinda dig the Asian chicks-"
to be a good man which he clearly wasn't anymore the second he invited Tommy to come inside his home.
"I know-" Dean smiles sadly. "I'll do my best to get better-"
"Eggs are my favorite-" he smiles. "-I like them with ketchup."
Both men laugh, only Castiel responds. "Good for you-"
Castiel decides to play along just so that conflict won't arise, "I'm sorry I said a bad word, okay-" smiles warmly. "Come on, we should go home before it get's dark-" not budging one bit. "Dean, I
Dean laughs, "Call me next month, I'll bring you-" he looks at the shopping bag that lay on her lap. "More of those." She kisses his cheek again before exiting the truck and runs back inside the diner. He stays in the parking lot typing out a text for Castiel when Robin comes back with a milk shake in hand and a paper bag.
"Too sketchy." Dean murmurs, looking at the taco shed.
Dean smiles, looking up at him and takes the small treat. "Thanks-"
Suddenly Dean blurts out, "I have to pee-" and waddles down the hallway but not before pulling up the large shirt up completely before he's even made it to the bathroom. Him doing that allowed the man to see his bare little ass walk away adorably.
Dean nods, "Doesn't look it, but yea-" and goes inside the house with his uncle.
"Like you're walking through walls or somethin'-"
"Of course not- we'll talk later." Castiel looks over at Bobby who was now wiping his hands on a rag- indicating that he was finished working. "Fix your face- damn it." he says urgently before leaving him alone with his breakfast.
"Shh." Castiel whispers, "I'm fine baby. Just calling you before I go into work." after a pause he breathes into the phone, "I love you baby-"
It was a hidden talent he hoped would never see the light of day. "Yea, I can sing." he nods somberly, almost having a heart attack when he's informed that the choir boys meet up after Sunday class and practice where mass is being held.
There's a loud thump that came from Bobby's room and they hear him curse, "Balls!" They sit up on the couch like they weren't doing a thing. Because they weren't, they were just talking about doing something. Bobby suddenly appears from the darkened hallway, "Banged my darn toe, didn't know the power was out."
Dean's laying on the couch watching television, "Yea yea I'm here-" he rolls his eyes. Castiel slaps his feet playfully so he can make some room for him, "Aw you brought me pizza-" he opens the box and takes one of the bigger slices.
Dean's face goes pink instantly, "You know I'm needy in the morning-" and he gets up out of bed, pulling the shirt off his body, letting it drop on the floor so he can change into his own clothes. After looking at his cellphone he says, "Bobby didn't call me-" and pockets it.
"Hey!" Castiel smiles, waving her over even though he was extremely nervous and could feel that he was starting to sweat under his jacket. He stands up to pull out her chair so she could sit down.
Castiel nods, then asks "Are you sure you want to do this?" to make sure he really wants this to happen. Dean nods, Castiel reaches over to the nightstand to grab the small bottle of lube that's been there for so long. It's only been used once. He squeezes some into his hand and strokes his cock a few times, Dean looking at him stroking it, longingly. "Dean. Relax."
"I'll open it. Why don't you get the cookie sheet out, and some butter-" the boy makes quick work of doing as he's told. Castiel will never tire of this, "We grease the sheet with butter so the cookies don't stick-" he informs the boy while they work together in the dimly lit kitchen.
"Why don't you do the fucking?" he asks, completely serious. No hint of laughter or smiles.
The line is silent for a moment, "Not being able to fuck you is hard." he goes with that instead, if he says he misses him too much he might end up getting emotional because it was
"Should I just go then?"  Dean rolls over onto his side so he can go to sleep and that's his cue to leave. "Goodnight baby, I love you." he leans over and presses a kiss to the boys hair before he goes.
Dean's eyes blink rapidly at the sensation of a tongue licking into him, "Feels weird-" he then looks down, his cock was hard and laying heavily against his flat lower tummy.
"Dizzy-" he swallows, "Hard to breathe-" right then he reaches for his phone and calls Castiel- when he doesn't pick up he calls for an ambulance instead. Bobby tries to keep Dean calm for the entire half hour it takes them to reach the house- when the paramedics arrive he explains what happened. After Dean is loaded up in the back, he explains to the paramedics that he doesn't eat very much- they nodded and thanked him. Bobby wouldn't be allowed to ride in the ambulance with Dean, with everything going on with the virus- no one but the patient was allowed in the hospital.
The mechanic just nods with a soft
his love for this man is ever present even if it's quite messed up at times. He gives into the idea, "I'm not Dexter so don't expect things to ever get bloody between us-"
he loves so much.
Dean looks completely overwhelmed at the mall, they were in a specific store that sold outerwear and sporting goods. "Castiel-" he says, staying close to the older man as they walk through the store.
Castiel feels the boys forehead to see that it was indeed a little warm then tilts the boys chin up and asks him to open his mouth. Sure enough, his suspicion was correct. "Your tonsils are a little swollen-" he comments softly. "Come on, let's get you dressed and we'll get you checked out at the hospital-"
Castiel's eyes had been locked with Deans, and now they drifted down to the ass pressing against his crotch. "So fucking beautiful-" he's pressing chaste kisses on the teens lower back right before yanking down the panties low enough to expose those plush cheeks. "Mm-" and basically french kisses them, like he might just bite into them but never does.
Sam comes rushing to Dean, "What?" he's asking, his three toddlers of different ages following behind their big giant of a father.
Castiel feels guilty instantly, his hand is still rubbing up and down his back. "Soon, if you want to-" Dean nods, he does want to and he wants to forgive him too. "Go to sleep, I'll watch over you-"
Dean rubbed circles over Castiel’s knuckles as he held onto his hand, “Well the thing is, certain things have come up in my life and I no longer wish to have a relationship with you-”
Castiel nods, "I'm sorry for lying."
Dean stumbles down the porch steps and they walk next door as slow as possible because they don't want to say goodnight. "Wish I could just live here with you." he admits as they reach the wooden fence.
"Whose he?" he asks.
Bobby calls out, "What're ya talkin' about over there?"
His father says nothing, resuming his seat on the couch so Dean goes to the bathroom to get in a quick hot shower since he doesn't know when he'll be able to enjoy one again. After a hot shower and a quick jerk- because he doesn't know when he'll be able to do that again either- he's pulling on a sweatshirt and some sweatpants before joining his little brother on the bed they both had to share.
Dean nods because he really does want to go on the trip and hopes he'll be able to pull through it after today. After a few more awkward minutes of conversation about the trip, they leave and take their coffee drinks with them.
"Ugh- thank god, I'm gonna come-" Dean says urgently- Castiel nods and they both explode. The next time Dean opens his eyes it's morning- he didn't even remember falling asleep. "Morning-" Dean snuggles against Castiel's back- "I'm hungry."
"Wear a mask."
"Name one outfit."
Dean keeps his hands clasped together on his lap so that they don't tremble under the gaze of his therapist. That's where he is on this dreary Monday morning and he's feeling more nervous than usual as he sits on the familiar leather couch. It had been a few weeks since he's been in this room and the fact alone isn't helping, he seems to always forget how much being vulnerable sucks ass. Therapy makes him feel so..
"Your stepfather?" she sits up, interest peaked. "What happened in this dream?" her pen is now scribbling away on her notepad.
"How about a blow job?" he rolls the crying teen over, "Ever gotten one?" and he shakes his head, tears now subsiding.
Dean blinks away the sweat from his eyes, not responding- his eyes still looking over the dirt road where the trees are. "We outta take him to the hospital-" Castiel nods.
When they've got their food in front of them Bobby asks, "Therapy go well?"
"I'm gonna be an uncle!" Dean shrieks and quickly regains his manly composure. "Come here you son of a bitch-" Dean rushes over to Eileen and Sam, hugging them both at the same time. "I'm so fucking happy. Sammy, you did good." he says. Of course, he won't admit he cried then too. Everyone at the party saw it and this time he couldn't blame it on being drunk. It became known that Dean was a recovering alcoholic who attended a meeting or two every month, Castiel went him him for support.
"It's complicated."
This young man was light skinned, had a strange mix of blue green eyes and light brown hair. Like
Castiel looks ahead, swallowing the knot in his throat. "I was going to visit you-" and he says it like he's trying to comfort himself too by saying this. "I love you-" it's spoken so softly, he wasn't sure the boy had heard it but when he looks down he's met with a look of confusion.
After the market they head to a store that only carried Halloween costumes and decorations for this particular holiday. Dean had a blast looking at everything on display and Castiel had asked if he'd like to pick out his costume and he did want to, but the look on his fathers face had him rejecting the offer. Maybe they'd choose one together, just them two.
Castiel can't help but smile, "Go ahead, I'll be here-" he sets down the teens mug on the old wooden nightstand before taking his own coffee mug to the empty side of the bed. "I love you baby-" he brushes his fingers into his messy short hair.
Castiel kisses his lips once more, "You're so pretty-" and the teen blushes under him. "I want you-" they kiss softly. "-only you. I don't want anyone else."
"Dean-" Castiel turns his body so he can face the teenager a bit more, "-we were roommates back in college. We were all very wild back then-"
Dean shrugs again, playing with the bottom of his shirt. "Aren't they the same?"
Castiel chuckles softly, tears in his eyes. "You called me a monster-" the teen bites his lip anxiously for ever saying such a thing, "You were just a kid, didn't know any better. I did look like one after he was done with me-" he swallows, "That was the worst of it, beat me so bad I ended up in the hospital with a head injury-"
"Shh, I had to." he steps away now, fixing the teens jacket. "I'm sorry our relationship got so messy-" the confession is sudden, unexpected. "I never wanted things to turn out like this. I couldn't figure out how to be your guardian and boyfriend at the same time. I never thought-
Dean gives him a once over, "How gay can you get-" his eyes focus on the fanny pack that was around his step fathers waist. "Where the hell did you even get that thing-" he covers his mouth, following the man into the woods.
"Like how-" they look like they'd just seen the devil himself sitting across them-
"Go away." He turned away to hide his face.
outside?"
One night after work, the middle aged doctor is sitting up in bed while watching television in order to kill time. His eyes are threatening to close with how damn heavy they feel but he's got to stay up until Dean gets home.
Innocent little Jo gasps, holding Dean's face and kisses his red cheek. Dean turns his face and catches her lips before she can kiss his cheek again. "Hmm."
Castiel's in line again and his eyes occasionally glance over at the boy who was now playing on his brand new phone.
Dean walks into class, late again and everyone stares at him- regardless if he fits in or not. He's coming to realize that maybe he's just a freak because he's dressed just like the rest of the other boys in the room and he's still getting weird looks. He's wearing a brown polo shirt, khaki pants and his signature boots. He's thinking maybe that's why he's getting looks, the other guys were wearing dress shoes or loafers and the girls were wearing flats.
"I want popcorn." Sam says.
"You want to be a mechanic like your father then?" Castiel asks.
Regardless of the Thanksgiving holiday, John heads to the shop and it's not like Castiel minds. The day is spent preparing the food and getting everything ready for dinner, which is an easy task with the helping hands of Dean Winchester. The boy added the butter to the mashed potatoes and stirred them carefully as to not spill any. Many laughs and giggles were shared between the two throughout the day.
Bobby shakes his head, "Yer spoilin' the boy-"
Castiel shouted "Dean!" from where he was waiting by the front door of Bobby's. "Let's go!" as soon as the anxious teen emerges from the bathroom looking handsome as ever, it's time to get going or they'd be late. Dean purposely slept in as an attempt to hopefully avoid having to go through with this.
Dean's drying off in front of the mirror when he notices a few small red marks on his neck. "Damn it-" he curses, getting a closer look at them and hopes that when Castiel sees him, he'll assume that he was the one who gave him the love bites from when they had sex at the cabin.
Dean broke in tears too, shoulders heaving up and down but he had to remain somewhat in control for Castiel. "Cas-buddy...You're gonna have an amazing life I know it...You're gonna find someone nice and hopefully marry them and have some real cute kids-"
The boy drew a cross over his heart with his finger. "Promise."
"Hmm-" is his response, the conversation isn't awkward at all, it actually feels normal to talk like this. "I kinda dig brunettes too-" he admits, without specifying genders. "With blue eyes-" it's said so casually.
"Bobby no-" Dean complains. "I don't want him to go home-"
Castiel looks at the menu above them, "-think I may want some nachos too. John?" the mechanic nods, waving him off. After they've got their food, Castiel pays and leads the way, carefully guiding the eleven year old to a seat. Dean is on one side, John is on the other-leaving him in the middle. "Careful, they're hot." he warns.
"Yes please-" Dean beams brighter than the sun behind him. "-free candy."
"I can swallow just fine-" he gets down on his knees and takes out Castiel's already hardening cock. "You more than anyone, should know that-"
"Awesome!" both boys shriek. "I want nachos." Dean says.
Castiel whined, "Stop it."
Castiel swallows, "Maybe I'll give it to you when you don't piss me off." he pulls away from the teens grasp and resumes driving. Dean's stunned- he was turned down.
and he doesn't intend on telling Dean or taking these pills.
" Sir. " Castiel felt uncomfortable as he rung up the man's total, carefully placing the select item's in a plastic bag for him.
"You never responded to my text." Castiel tries to get in- "I missed you." but he's denied entry, "I wan't to shower with you, Dean." he tries to kiss his boy on the lips but that's also rejected. "Alright, what's going on? Are you rejecting me all over again?"
"Are you kidding?" Dean scoffs, "The guy was nuts."
Dean takes the cigarette from his friend and takes a drag, "No shit." he takes another drag, his eyes watching Jack closely.  He says "You're kinda innocent aren't you-" and it's not a question. He passes the cigarette back to him.
It's not about money or the guys past, or the fact that his boyfriend is a drunk- it's the fact that he's just not a good man. Castiel often daydreams about it, what if John had been just a
By the time Castiel is done in the shower he forgets all about what happened beforehand. Dean's now in the living room, sitting on the couch watching something on the television. "Missed you baby-" he takes a seat next to the teen and tries to kiss him but is rejected. "What?"
If Castiel moved in he would never go to sleep at a reasonable hour and he would never leave for work in the morning. Having this adorable young man in his home was much too tempting. Sexually.
Castiel sits down next to him, playing with his food. "I'm worried about you, Dean. Everything you told me, I can't-"
" You finished the whole thing. " Castiel smiled up at him as they were walking out of the coffee shop, his own drink still half finished and already cold in his grip. He tossed it in the trash real quick and turned back to the man.
Castiel grabs his keys in a rush because Dean is missing and his shitty father seems to give no fucks about it. How long had he been home from work and not noticed, over
"I don't want-"
What happened???? Come get me please.
After some back and forth on the subject, the teen wins the discussion and will be allowed to go to a strip club for his birthday. After all it's what his uncle had promised him a few months back.
“Some men are who they are, unable to change.”
John grabs the batman cup and uses it to rinse his sons clean hair, "You think I like gettin' calls from school tellin' me to give you a bath?" he huffs angrily as he squirts more bubble bath onto his hands so he can wash his sons body next- and he does it just as roughly, his nails basically scratching every inch of his skin to get it clean once again.
"You're cute-" Castiel smiles, letting himself into the car as well. "-you look happy to see me."
Dean yanks on his stepfathers arm to keep him from walking out the front door. "Cas, please-" his eyes are pleading. "Just give it to me-"
Dean grabs his phone in rage and begins to type the nastiest things to his step father. When he doesn't get a response right away his texts to the man grow more foul.
Again without realizing- he falls asleep as soon as his head hits the pillow. When he wakes up, he squints at the amount of sunlight in his room- he blinks and suddenly it's dark again. He looks at the clock and its almost seven but he can't tell if it's morning or night. Dean rolls out of bed and wanders through the house in search of life. He's feeling like he slept for days. For some reason he begins to think he's in some crazy alternate dimension or something until he hears the familiar laugh that belongs to Castiel- it's coming from outside. As soon as he opens the screen door he sees the two men sitting on lawn chairs by the fire.
Castiel picked up the box and gestured in a certain direction so the man would follow him where he was going.
"As in dry humping?"
His eating habits were more on the binge eating spectrum- he was eating and that was good,
Dean thinks about it a little more while bitting on his bottom lip anxiously. "N-no-" he says finally. "Let's do it-" they kiss once again and it gets a little heated. "I'm just scared-" the admission comes suddenly, surprising them both. "I don't wanna end up like my mom-"
Castiel nods, "Of course."
"Always-"
"Yea-" Dean replies softly, chewing on the straw of his milkshake- it wasn't even noon yet and he was indulging his sweet tooth. Why not, it's been a crappy few years for the Winchesters.
Dean smiles and means it because he likes Chuck more than Meg. At least Chuck doesn't ask personal questions. "Love me some fries." Dean mumbles, shoveling fry after fry into his mouth. "Hey, you know Cas right?"
If they're over, this means Dean's on his own from now on- no more snacks, no more gifts, no protection and certainly no more secret kisses in his bunk. The following few days, he takes on prison life on his own for the first time while his cell mate is in solitary and he's having no problems at all- most likely because everyone knows Castiel will be getting out eventually. If he finds a single scratch on his boy, there will be hell to pay- so everyone leaves him be, like he's a ghost in the wind.
"Yea whatever." Dean can't tear away his eyes from the man on the screen. He's handsome and all scruffy. "Shame you're not here-"
The class is uneventful, no one bothers to look at him and his new friend though the girls glance over his way once in a way and it has Dean saying, "If you like any one of these girls, I can get her for you-" he whispers.
"I cried all night-" Castiel admits. "-I felt like you don't love me." their eyes meet. "Do you love me?"
As Castiel drives he looks into the rear view mirror and sees that green eyes are watching him so he smiles. Dean smiles back before looking away, he was extremely content with the warm happy meal box that sat on his lap. Eventually he started munching on the fries after losing a bit of his shyness. When he drops them both off at their home he feels a pang of sadness as he watches John's son walk up the drive way to let himself inside the home.
"Where were you?"
The two adults ask Dean to say something.
Dean nods, "Okay-" and gets up slowly, clearly being dramatic because it was
They have Dean standing in the front- hands still cuffed behind his back and looking like an absolute mess. He was coming down from the coke he had done earlier that day. The only thing he was worried about was getting drug tested because he really didn't want to get locked up or worse, sent to rehab or something wacky like that. He's seen movies about kids who get sent to rehab, it's all about self love and acceptance and
"Your jacket-" Dean is about to take it off when Derek grips the jacket, by the collar. "Uh-" and he can't help but just look up at the guy- completely hypnotized.
Castiel carefully gets into bed, underneath the covers and sighs at warmth. He must have been asleep an hour before John is waking him up in the least pleasant way- rolling him over onto his stomach. "What are you-" his eyes open wide, "No-" John yanks his sweatpants and boxers down. "No!"
"What's wrong?"
"I'm gonna go see what's taking him so long-" Castiel rushes towards the cabin just as Bobby is coming out- with the rifle in hand and Dean's boots.
"It's a big load to handle everything on your own, Dean-" there's rustling under the blankets as they move slightly. "I'm here, you should've told me sooner-" his love begins giggling next to him, just a bit though. "What?"
Unknown
Castiel answers honestly, "Yes, I like girls." because he does like them. Or at least he used to like them,
Dean feels a little afraid of him, "Huh?" he pulls the sheet over his exposed lap as casually as he can. Castiel has often expressed that if they ever broke up for good, he'd always be there- that he would respect his wishes, whatever they may be, that if he ever chose to end things, he would respect it and
"Then what happened?"
Dean shrugs, "Her dad ran out on her, she's probably dying for a man to hold her and love her-"
Castiel is watching Dean quite often now too, bless his father for still being the town's drunk because it allows him to have one on one time with his sweet son. He suspects the mechanic is still doing drugs every now and then.
The man's eyes lip up like stars. " Oh man, You have no idea how much I do. I have book's on car's, Classic car's are my favorite. I Quite fancy my father's ride and I wouldn't mind getting my hand's on a Crown Vic sometime. "
Dean wouldn't dare punch a wall at Bobby's for fear his uncle might shoot him. He's got guns and he's not afraid to use them- Dean's blood so he may not
"Morning." Dean says,"I'm sorry...I just needed you-"
"Hurry up!" Dean's got his hands on his hips, waiting outside for his step father to exit the cabin so they can go on their walk. "We're losin' daylight!"
"You're cute." Castiel laughs, "I don't know why John doesn't spend more time with you-"
"Ah shit- fraid' not. Got too many cars to finish before the weekend."
It's not long before Dean begins to make little sleepy noises, like the cutest puppy ever. It makes Castiel smiles adoringly before planting a barely there kiss on the top of his head.
After clocking in he notices that it's pretty dead in there today and he doesn't mind one bit, he's tired and doesn't feel like working hard today. Robin wasn't in today, called in sick- female problems or something and he knew exactly what that meant. Today it was just him and Lisa. Every once in a while he would gaze over at the brunette and she would meet his gaze and smile, Dean smiled back.
His thoughts quickly go to Dean as he lathers up his hardening cock and lets it go completely because he really isn't going to pleasure himself with thoughts of a child in his mind. "Damn it, Dean-" his eyes begin to water, stinging his eyes or perhaps it was the shampoo still in his hair.
right?
"I'm gonna head home-" and of course, the man doesn't notice anything strange about his quick departure.
Castiel looks away briefly, his eyes suddenly burning and pries himself away from the embrace. "That was years ago, I'm fine-" there's hesitation. "I'm passed it-"
Dean finishes his sentence, "Hectic, I know." his tone is a sad one. Their eyes meet, "Is this what our life is gonna be like? You, always working and me, just-" his words die off mid sentence. "You know those holiday parties you go to every year? The ones at the hospital-" he nods, "How am I ever gonna be able to show my face there?"
"Dean-" the familiar gruff voice comes through the speaker. "Can you hear me? God I was hopin' to see you-"
"You're fine, be quiet-" John reassures him breathlessly, he was close and his movements were getting rougher. Now it was starting to really hurt Dean and he knew it because the boy began to cry loudly, so loud the that nothing couldn't muffle it. "Fuckkk-" he suddenly comes in his jeans and slowly gets up from the bed.
Once he's inside the well air conditioned vehicle he looks over at Castiel who rolls his eyes and peels away from Bobby's property. They know well enough not to kiss in front of that darn kitchen window. The car ride into town had been awkward just as he expected it to be but he was finally getting to spend some alone time with the man and that was enough- he didn't want to push his luck after what happened.
"What are we having?" Dean asks when the man opens the car door and let's himself inside.
Ash is quickly slipping into his denim jacket, "Fine by me, you mind? I gotta get goin'-" and wiggles his eyebrows because according to what he said earlier- tonight was the night he was going to try to get it on with that milf lady next door.
Dean looks spooked suddenly because the adult at his feet was crying, "Why are
Dean’s back pressed against the cool tile wall. Looking down at Castiel. Dean looked as if he was submitting to Castiel. When fingers rubbed at his nippes, he moaned. Head falling forward. He got down to his knees without realizing he was.
Bobby had shown up at the house earlier that day with
Castiel kisses the teen softly, his tongue meeting his every now and then. The horror movie on the television continues to play and it lights them up in the darkness. They're a few minutes into it before his large hands run underneath the teens shirt to feel his soft skin. They both had forgotten how pleasurable making out can be, regardless if sex followed or not.
Castiel nods, "We can talk about this tomorrow baby." he kisses his damp hair. "Go to sleep-" Dean nods, closing his eyes. The next day Castiel shocks Dean by calling in sick for the day.
Dean rolls his eyes and shouts, "Go!" then turns around to avoid watching the quick exchange. "Is he gone yet?" he asks quietly, peeking over his shoulder and catching the exchange anyway. "Bye Miracle!" he shouts, waving at the dog being escorted indoors by his new owner.
"You dog." Dean shakes his head, "Can't believe she let you get some with all this shit on your face-" he reaches over and gently tugs at the curly hairs of his beard.
When Castiel dropped Dean off at the house, his heart broke. He has been wanting to come back but he didn't know how. Does he just go in? he has a key but it just doesn't feel like home lately. All he and Dean do is argue and with the way that kid is, he'll start throwing punches. His reputation of being the school bully has gone around the town a few times- Dean Winchester charms the girls and fights the boys.
Dean smiles, "Yea, sure."
Dean looks up as well with his hands on his hips as if inspecting the completed task, "You know I hate Christmas, right?" the man wraps an arm around him, ignoring his comment. "But yea, looks pretty-"
They make it to the hotel safely, walking passed the girl at the front desk freaked Dean out- She wouldn't stop staring at them. "Whose he?" she asks, it's been a few short weeks and they haven't spoken aside from
"Dean, you can tell me."
Castiel nods before he goes to pick one out. Bobby had a large collection of books on the shelves in the living room, he's surprised he never really looked through them before.
Castiel comes silently on the other end, patiently waiting for him to calm down and give him some attention. After watching the teen lay back, chest heaving up and down in exhaustion he decides to ask, "Baby, you alright over there?-"
Dean grows silent, "No way-"
The drive home passes in a blur, his thoughts are with Dean and the things he had said only moments prior. By the time he's already showered and laying in bed for the night, his mind has jumped to the women in his book club.
"Yea-" Dean whines, his body tensing up, his ass going even higher than it was before until he lets himself fall down against the mattress and he begins grinding up against it- chasing his own orgasm. Castiel is so amazed by this that he pulls out, letting the boy do his own thing. "Ugh- ugh- mm- hmph-mm-" he begins to make the most delicious little whimpers and moans that Castiel starts to jack off, chasing a second orgasm while he enjoys the view.
