"That felt pretty good, actually," John remarks as he reaches the terrace. "Bloody things never do what I want."
He intended a real trek, then, not just a polite stroll through the Regent's Park around the corner. The paths would still be muddy from the rain; I would have to dress accordingly.
"This okay?" John asks.
"Not at all, Doctor Watson," Mycroft says with a tiny smile. "Please, come in. Mummy won't want to miss meeting you."
"Oh God, don't tell me you've got a new flat lined up for me as well," John joked.
"Good-bye," Father says pointedly, but he sounds amused.
"Because it's not safe," she says. Just like that, frank and without preamble; Tristram's a bit shocked. He thought the whole point of coming here to Switzerland was because it was safe, because no one knew where they were. Although Irene found them - Tristram's had his doubts for a while now as to whether it could truly have been a coincidence that she's here too - and the man that Father's meeting with found them as well. Unless Father found him? Either way, people know they're here. Maybe they should have stuck with being the Rathbones and the Browns after all.
He glanced over at the dog, who was lying on the sofa with his head on his paws, watching them with patient, liquid eyes. He perked up his ears and cracked his mouth open at the sign of attention from his master.
"We weren't close," Sherlock scoffed. "He was simply another member of staff. It doesn't matter." He waved a hand as if dismissing all of the past month. Had it only been a month? Even better. What was a month to the rest of his life? Nothing lasting only a month had ever impacted his life before. This was no different.
All of a sudden, Doctor Watson is standing next to her. Tristram didn't even see him get up. Doctor Watson wraps a hand around her upper arm and says, "Excuse us," to no one in particular, his voice as hard and steely as his grip on her arm. Tristram can see her flesh bulging on either side of his fingers from the pressure, and he thinks distantly that it must hurt.

"Gorgeous," he said, taking in the sight of Sherlock reclining against the headboard, the covers carelessly pooled around him.
Walking with Gladstone. Speedy's in an hour? -SH
Sherlock's face bloomed into a smile. "Always." Always. His partner.
John's breathing shifted. Muscles flickering into motion in his face. His mouth closing. A grimace. A sound in his throat. Swallowing. Attempting to, at least. Another grimace. Sherlock held his breath. He might settle again.
Sherlock leaned down until his face was millimetres away from John's and John was about to slip out of him entirely.
Doctor Watson goes into the living room. "And here's your key, by the way." He sets a key down on the desk next to Father.
"Oh, it's just a bit of wind," Mr Holmes said, trying to downplay the situation. "Feels like a lump that doesn't want to go down."
"I am not in need of a nursemaid, unlike you," Sherlock snarls.
Sherlock was the first to move. Rather than starting to undress John, though, he moved in close enough that their chests were brushing, put his hands on John's shoulders and let them slowly slide down his arms. John put his hands on Sherlock's hips and snugged him in more tightly. Sherlock brushed his nose, then his lips over John's cheek. John turned his face just enough to catch Sherlock's mouth, and then he kissed him as if there weren't going to be any tomorrow.
"Okay."
She really, really liked John's penis. It was nice and thick, a bit bigger around than a Twister ice lolly, but not too long, so she could get a good portion of it in her mouth without it being uncomfortable.
"I'll take care of it. You go into the bathroom and do whatever you need to do." John pivots him around and gives him a little push. "Wash, brush, flush," he says, pointing down the hall.
to come up with the anagram. (Put your name in and try it, it's fun!)
"All right," Doctor Watson says slowly, like he's trying to buy some time to figure out what Father's doing. "I wasn't going to be long." His body tenses, as if he's going to take a step forward, but he doesn't.
It wasn't a bomb, he reminds himself. They'd only wanted to scare Tristram, not kill him. The man who tied him up wanted him to tell his father to do something else with his life, meaning not to investigate crimes. Obviously his father's not about to stop working on cases. Tristram wonders if it's all somehow connected to the Moran his father mentioned this morning. But then it would also be connected to Emily's Aunt Claire, and her mother's murder.
"Where do you want it?" John asks as he enters Sherlock's room.
Sherlock breaks the silence: "That couch isn't going to do your shoulder any favours."
He frowns a little. "I know, but sometimes a story like this can remind you of something that is real and make you sad too."
Uncle Mycroft gives Father a triumphant look. Father scoffs. "It's healing."
"Hi Tris, Sherlock. Come in, sorry for the crush," Emily's father says good-naturedly, shuffling backwards to let them in. Emily smiles and waves at Tristram from behind him, although she is more subdued, less her usual effusive self.
As the train winds its way up the mountain - the zig-zags are called switchbacks, Father informs him - Tristram feels like they're once again crossing over into another world. The white of the snow literally sparkles, as if it's made of diamonds. In the distance, wisps of cloud curl around the peaks like one of Mrs Hudson's good silk scarves caught on a mammoth version of the chocolate in his pocket. Whereas yesterday's foggy, snow-covered mountaintop where they had the snowball fight and rode on toboggans was like a dream of fluff and clouds, this is a hard-focused, jagged place of magic and danger. The association is solidified in Tristram's mind when they come around one last curve and are confronted with a huge grey castle complete with silver turrets gleaming in the unfiltered sunlight. He half expects to see Quidditch rings rising from the field beside it, or robed figures floating over it on broomsticks.
"Mum," Molly growled.
"You'll let me know as soon as you hear something."
John's breath hitches and his lips part automatically. Sherlock closes the distance and John's eyes fall shut.
bedroom -- to fetch his wallet, calm as a mountain lake, and jogged downstairs.
He sort of half nods and half shakes his head. It's beginning to be a bit embarrassing now. He wills his body to work the way it's supposed to, but he still can't get more than a teaspoonful of air in at a time before his windpipe closes up. It's probably not really that bad, but it feels like it.
Emily's aunt clears her throat pointedly and says, "John..."
Tristram tries to concentrate, tries to do what Doctor Watson wants. No, his legs don't hurt particularly. Not like his back anyway. "I don't think so," he sniffles.
Message: Ha ha. Your turn yet? Send me a picture when you have it on.
Message: Never mind. Ear wax is good to go. See you tonight?
"Mycroft Holmes," Mycroft said, giving Moriarty an oily once-over. The pained half-smile on his face said that he found the man sadly lacking. "Head of Whitehall Studios," he added, nodding graciously to the audience. "We hadn't wanted to come out and make a big announcement like this. Children are so easily stage-struck, and reactions are so much more natural when people don't know they're being filmed. But in light of your rather cheap and disappointing display," he said with a disapproving shake of his head in Moriarty's direction, "I should like to confirm that we have in fact been recording this delightful little show from the start -" Mycroft extended his umbrella to point out several cameras that Sherlock had taken for surveillance cameras placed around the stage and the square. "-and now your performance as well," Mycroft continued, "which I doubt will make it into the final cut, but may find some other
"Why don't we just let them burp
They look out at the mountains again, and Tristram feels as if a great weight has been lifted from his heart. Father is happy, he's happy, they both have a special friend, and there's nothing here to spoil their holiday. Absolutely everything is right in the world.
John blinks a couple of times, his arms still raised to get cups down. Then he lowers them and goes the few steps into the living room to check on Emily. She appears to be sound asleep on the couch. John looks at the laptop on the table, then down the hall. He sighs a little and picks up the computer.
Just as she thought that, John glanced up at her. He was flushed red, his mouth hanging open a little and breathing hard, and she had a little stab of realization that this was what Sherlock wanted: John Watson, sharing his heart and his body, caught up in a complicated emotional and chemical process too intimate for words, but that he could never have due to a caprice of biology. What she was offering him was little more than a brief physical interaction with some of John's discarded cells, at most an ephemeral essence of experience transferred by some commutative theory of association. And that despite the fact that what connected John and Sherlock was much deeper and more profound than the gentle affection she and John shared. And yet here she was, holding sway over John's body - and maybe a small piece of his heart - while Sherlock sat alone in his room. Did John know? He must. Maybe this was the best he could do; the best they all could do.
"Yes, and it will be someone near by, near enough that missing by a couple of metres will be unfortunate but excusable. But who?" Tristram can hear the frustration in Father's voice. "This wasn't supposed to happen!"
It may be John's imagination, but it seems to him that she delivers the last line with a bit of a leer.
"You are amazing. And a very, very good father."
"All right then, there's nothing more to be done tonight. Come on, bedtime," John says. He squeezes Sherlock's shoulders one more time and lets go.
Tristram's heart is still racing, but he knows where he is now. The grey veil is their tent. They're in his room at home. And he can't find his phone because he didn't put it under his pillow last night. He left it on the desk to charge.
"Hey, Em, watch his hand," Doctor Watson warns her, still grinning.
Both men lean imperceptibly closer to each other, but before anything else can happen, Irene pipes up.
"Maybe. We might still have time to try something else." Sherlock tilts his head to look up at John. "He has something on you in there," he says soberly. "He showed me. Timestamped footage of you entering and leaving the building with the duffle the night Moran was shot. A witness who can place you at the shooting range the night before."
I became suddenly and pointedly aware of how close we were standing, the solid expanse of his chest mere inches from mine. For all that he gave the impression of having a narrow frame, it was an illusion caused by his height and the long, concealing mantles and cloaks he wore. He was in reality a powerful specimen, his musculature well developed and maintained in top form by the sparring matches in which he frequently participated.
"Daddy, can you hear me? It's Emily," she says gleefully.
She pulls the sheet back. She has a thoughtful, worried look on her face. "I don't think he should have gone out alone to find those killers."
They all go out to the door. Emily's aunt hands Tristram his jacket while Doctor Watson and Father are still talking.
"Talk?"
"You do know what that phrase means, don't you?" Doctor Watson says. "Revenge, Sherlock. Tit for tat, a life for a life."
John takes half a step toward Sherlock but stops before he touches him. He thrusts his fisted hands into his pockets. "Tomorrow. We can go home tomorrow and this whole thing will be over in no time."
Time: 15:45
"Sorry, what?" John asks. "How could Moran give himself away? He's dead."
"No!"
This is what a fondue fork looks like:
Tristram locks his elbow and tries to press his arm in, while Doctor Watson grasps him by his shoulder and hip and tilts him up so his left arm is squished underneath him. Doctor Watson sweeps his eyes up and down Tristram's body. "Looks good," he confirms. "Just some superficial scrapes." He braces Tristram by the hip and uses his other hand to brush something off Tristram's chest, then quickly slides his jumper underneath Tristram and lets him back down. The warmth of the jumper is a huge relief. But now there's blood smeared all over Doctor Watson's glove.
"Is my dad up yet?" Emily asks.
"Is it?" It was, of course it was. But was that bad? Should Sherlock not try to keep John near?
"Tell Mal and the boys I love them," he said. "You too, John." He reached one thin arm out from underneath the blanket to reach for John's arm. His grip was weak, barely able to hold on, but his eyes were clear and steady. Then he turned his face toward the floor and vomited thinly.
"Ha! Yeah, all right," Doctor Watson agrees. "Pretty clever." He gives Tristram's shoulder a gentle squeeze, being careful not to press on any of the bandages he just put on. Tristram glances at his father again, but he's still staring at his phone. "But how he does it..." Doctor Watson wonders.
"Do you trust them? With your daughter's life? Can you say with one hundred percent certainty that Moran's people didn't slip a ringer in?" Sherlock points up at the ceiling. His phone beeps and he looks down at it. "It's your call. I can't stay and argue it, I've got Tristram's signal." He turns and walks out the door.
Sherlock waited a few moments, catching his breath, his mind whirling, he couldn't think, all he knew was that he had to be sure, had to know what this was, philia or eros, the bracing embrace of warrior brethren or the reunion of two halves rejoined. He curled in, tilting his head to touch John's lips with his once more, slow, cautious, tantalising the sensitive flesh, and John still didn't move away. Responded, a tight, choked sound, hands clenching in the material of Sherlock's suit, leaning in, pressure on Sherlock's mouth, moulding his lips to fit Sherlock's, adjusting and re-aligning, discovery, relief, tenderness, the underlying question being answered enthusiastically, unequivocally. Another pause, both of them with chests heaving, eyes closed, overwhelmed by their physical and emotional reactions.
"Are we in danger?"
Tristram can only assume that the bad guys lost their trail and left John and Emily alone, because he hasn't heard anything more about John and Emily since, and he won't let himself think about it beyond that. They should be back in London by now, at their house, with Emily's aunts. That is all Tristram allows himself to think. Another thought sneaks in anyway: maybe they are at Tristram's flat, with his father. But if that's the case, then Tristram was woefully, horribly wrong, and it's entirely his fault that he's here and not with them.
Sherlock smiled. "I'd like that," he said, then closed the last few millimetres to kiss John lightly on the lips. "I'll make the reservations later."
"The point being, I can't actually afford this, just so you know," Doctor Watson mutters.
"What'd you get up to today?" John asked, leaning back against the sink. His arms crossed, still holding his half-full glass.
John flashed him a smile and licked his bottom lip as he turned away again. "You -" He cleared his throat. "I mean, you wrote the music and, and the parts and the words and everything." He nodded at the music.
"Don't fuck with me, Sherlock," John said. He was using that same beautiful, dangerous tone he had when warning Moriarty off.
"Maybe the two of you could come again sometime," Emily's father suggests. They are still holding hands.
"I'll do that," John said, and stood up. "Could do with a bit of stretching my legs."
"Stay."
"Mine, no doubt," Father says.
But the main reason he doesn't want to look is that all that glass, all that exposure, makes him anxious. He recognises that now, and he remembers what John said: that part of avoiding a panic attack is staying away from things that set it off. He does not want to have a panic attack here in the middle of the airport. Airports, strangers, and windows: all things that his brain has bad associations with. He managed it the last time they flew, just barely, and he's going to do even better this time by not looking at any of the windows.
"That doesn't sound good."
&&&&&&
Molly had left already (expected things to go better between him and John). The technicians were also long gone. Sherlock was alone. He fumbled past the paper in his pocket for the pack of cigarettes and lit one. Once he had it going, he took out John's note and angled it toward the light so he could read it.
"Oopsy-daisy," Sherlock sing-songs and tips her over the edge.
"Whyever not?" Mrs Holmes asked.
Message: I know but just to get an idea.
John gets a glint in his eye. "You could be just the man we need. How much do you know about the restaurant business?"
Sherlock wanted to be irritated at John's presumption that he thought he knew what was going on in Sherlock's head, but it happened he was right. Not that it was too much, exactly, but the fact was that Sherlock had stopped so that it wouldn't be. Then there was the fact that he'd said they had all night. John meant to stay. They'd barely started, and John was already saying he wasn't going to leave. Dizzy with the implication, Sherlock let his weight sink down and settle onto John. He knew he wasn't light by any means, despite his lean physique, but John didn't complain, just wrapped his arms around Sherlock's back and held him there.
Which all boiled down to this perhaps being the last time he and John might see each other.
- to follow that request. Listening in now would feel like betraying that trust. There's no concrete reason, though, no repercussions to be feared. Nothing that would convince practical-minded Emily.
Sherlock Holmes strode past the news agent (something about the euro; dull) and on into the park, where the groundskeeper (widowed, lost last night's bet on the football match; dull and dull) was unwittingly obliterating evidence of the crimes that had taken place the previous night (underage alcohol consumption, pickpocketing, public indecency; dull, dull, dull). He stopped at Speedy's for a cup of coffee - black, three sugars (the young woman behind the counter had a boyfriend from Liverpool and was reading philosophy in her third semester but considering taking a gap year in Italy: honestly, did no one have any imagination any more?) - and took exactly two sips for quality control before continuing to the school.
Doctor Watson's face crumples a little and he reaches out to take hold of Tristram's good hand. "Tris, you know, no matter what, your father loves you. You are the most important thing in his life. Nothing is going to change that. Nothing."
"No," John says immediately. "I'm... No," he repeats, as if the entire notion were ridiculous. "Does she mean me?" he asks anyway.
"You think they need to investigate something here?" She sounds eager, probably hoping to see a frozen foot or a chemical experiment in the kitchen.
The smile disappears and his father rattles the newspaper impatiently. "By the end of the week, if all goes well."
"Hi, Ems," Doctor Watson says, cradling the back of her head with one hand. "Did you have a good time?"
He was drunk. A little. More than a little? Enough. Sherlock should take him home. Wanted to take him home. Mycroft's car was outside. He'd done his part as Greg's best man. It wouldn't be the first time he left a wedding reception early. It would be the first time he left one happy. The first time he held John's hand in the dark back seat of a car. The first time he nudged John awake when they reached Baker Street by kissing him softly on the mouth and saying, "We're home."
The 'Friday Afternoon' that Tristram references is from Getting Better, when he and Emily were kidnapped.
The walls have some kind of shields or coats of arms carved into them. For some reason, it makes Tristram think of Durmstrang, the magical school of the far north in the Harry Potter stories. Incongruously, there are huge bells - as big as Tristram's body - standing randomly around on blocks of ice. Doctor Watson says those are cowbells, but Tristram has trouble picturing any cow wearing a bell that large. There are no windows, and Tristram thinks the whole place could do with an air-out, as there's a distinct locker-room smell.
Doctor Watson moves his fingers away. "Sorry, okay, how about your legs? Do they hurt?"
Tristram wasn't worried. Because Father apparently has Tristram's passport, and they're waiting for him anyway. Unless he loses it - he's fallen into bodies of water a couple of times and lost his wallet and keys to the sludge, so perhaps it's not such a bad plan to have a backup passport on the way.
John had left early that morning so he could go home and change. Sherlock wondered whether John would consider it precipitous if Sherlock suggested he simply move his things over to Sherlock's house. He couldn't have much, not more than a couple of suitcases and boxes. They could probably fit everything into a taxi. They could do it that afternoon. He'd said 'long-term relationship' (not directly in relation to Sherlock, true, but the subtext had been there). He didn't mind the blood and the mud (not much, anyway). And if Sherlock offered to charge him less than John's current flat cost, he'd really have no reason to refuse. Sherlock would have let him live there for free, of course, but he knew John wouldn't stand for that. He took out his mobile to look up John's landlord and send off an enquiry.
John would pity him now- poor, inexperienced Sherlock gets kissed, has an orgasm, and thinks it’s love- and then he would leave. They all left in the end.
“A nuisance? Annoying? Unbearable?”
Something tingly and deep and basal, something irrational and stupid. The detective bit his lips in momentary feelings of a thing closely resembling guilt. Elaborate. a) John highly disregarded listening to conversations he intended to keep private, because John valued privacy. As a best friend, the social norm dictated to respect the things your friend values. Refutation: Sherlock Holmes was not one to care about social norms and John Watson was aware of it. b) Unsettling strong emotional reaction to his friend's slight display of passion and dominance. Elaborate. Collection of data to be postponed to a later point in time. Sherlock pulled a little at his curls to get his train of thoughts back on the right track.
I'm. So. Sorry!!!!! It has been ages, but don't worry, I didn't abandon this fic, haha.
As John made his way to the door, Sherlock sprang into action. “John, wait-“He tried to grab the other man’s arm, but the doctor pushed past him forcefully. He pushed the door open, not even paying attention to the concerned-looking Lestrade in the hallway. The detective had precautious given Anderson and Donovan the rest of the evening off, so they were alone on the floor. Better keep those noisy cats away from the domestic clearly taking place in his office. John turned his head, to cast the distressed looking consulting detective another long look.
“Sherlock?”
Then again, it’s much more than that.
(which was a miracle in itself).
For some seconds, Sherlock’s heavy breathing and the ticking of the clock were the only sounds in the room. Greg subtly checked his watch. It was close to 11; almost 4 hours since John stormed off to Baker Street. Part of Greg was impressed by the doctor’s stubbornness. Another part of him wasn’t surprised. Sherlock’s fall would always remain a sore spot for his friend; and even though Greg did a great deal to help him in the first year after Sherlock’s death, they never talked about this dark period in John’s life. It sort of became the elephant in the room for everyone who had been involved. Sherlock was, as Greg guessed, oblivious to the damage his absence had done. He sighed. John stopped talking about it. Even though it might have been important to talk with Sherlock about it. Of-fucking-course he didn’t.
But the last evening had felt
a decent parent.)
He followed John with his eyes, when he sat down next to Graham again, a sickenly happy smile plastered on his stupid face. Sherlock felt like punching something. Jealously was a curious disease, but two could play this game, Sherlock thought, when he turned to the barkeeper and ordered the strongest shot with shaking fingers.
"Wake me if there's something wrong. Now-" He yawned, and Sherlock joined in. "Sleep".
There is a familiar sneer forming on Sherlock’s face; the one he usually wears when he’s completely puzzled by others and angry at himself for not understanding them. “I’m a genius, but that’s hardly the point.”
“Don’t ‘babe’ me,” the politician hissed, “I’m an influential man who could ruin your career by the snap of his finger! This is infuriating! Not only am I pressured- pressured, you hear!- to spend my weekend
“Who’s the lucky one?”
“I know that my nature is neither sociable, nor nice, nor anything anyone would remotely desire in a partner” John had to smile to himself at that, for the detective probably didn’t even realized that he was finally opening up about his emotions. It was as if a heavy burden was lifted off his heart.            “But I’m trying so hard”
family, deserved a shred of attention, too. Of course, he was being unfair here; Sherlock had made countless sacrifices for Rosie and himself and never once complained about it, but
Sherlock stared at him for a full minute. “Are you
Although he seemed eager to go to the bathroom seconds ago, John lingered a little bit longer- enjoying the domesticity and quiet after the adrenalin rush; enjoying touching his best friend’s shoulders in soothing circles, feeling the bones and warmth underneath the silky shirt; enjoying this new and intimate dynamics they found themselves in.
Sherlock must have sense the shift in the mood, because when the DI managed to shake the thoughts away, he was watching him intently, quietly analysing. The DI exhaled snakingly and rubbed his face.
was missing something here. But he didn’t understand what it was, didn’t understand what John’s motifs were and his complete lack of control over this situation frustrated him immensely. He was a deductive genius, it was his whole purpose in life to understand clues. To put together variables.
“Already?” he asked, overly-sweet tone slightly slurred. “I w’s having
“Such language in front of an innocent child.”
“Listen, I get it. Despite what the Netflix tagline might suggest, you don’t have to listen to anything we advise you. It’s your life and it’s about what makes you happy-“ here, he smiles at John brightly and John feels the irrational desire to blurt out that it feels like
'He looks at you like there’s no one else in the room,' John’s flush returns with a vengeance when he remembers Antoni’s words.
“I’m ordering Chinese. You’re eating” The doctor informed him good-naturedly on his way to the kitchen; ruffling through the wild mane of black curls when he passed. Sherlock’s face crumbled momentarily in an expression of pure delight, before he caught himself; overplaying his obvious reaction.
, in his own twisted way! John really didn't understand why he had gotten himself so worked up over the matter, but he did. He thought, in a fit of early morning passion, that some of Sherlock's reservation towards sentiment and some of his fears concerning his past would be healed if he shared a moment with Mycroft (as far as two emotionally frozen aristocratic assholes could share an emotional concept like "a moment"). The idea was, frankly speaking, insane. But John's gut kept demanding him to pick up his phone.
“You’re not observing. Clearly, you’re missing the clues. Your conclusion is wrong. If you take all the variables into account, the inevitable outcome-“
“I don’t care”
John stares at it a little bewildered.
How dare this person assume things about his sex life?!
John carefully draped the soft cover over both of them, before he instructed Sherlock to face the wall. Sherlock looked at his suspicious, but yelped with two strong army doctor arms wrapped tightly around his waist and drew him close to John's body heat.
John gave him a look over his shoulder. “You’re a genius, you know everything.”
help for
His mind felt pleasantly empty, when he pulled the detective gently down to his eye level and gave him a sweet peck on the lips. It was a small gesture, which spoke volumes.
John has the decency to be low-key embarrassed. The flat
The statement had caused something to shift, he could feel it fluttering in his chest, similar to the way he had felt the day before, yet so very different. The way his heart suddenly clenched made him feel…. Vulnerable? Young? He wasn’t used to register so many emotions, and those were heavy and huge and overwhelming. He found himself once again at a loss of what to do about them. But at least now, he wasn’t hyperventilating and throwing up all over the place.
Sherlock’s heart melted, and he beamed brightly. John laughed, because for once in his life everything was going so fucking perfect. Sherlock made everything perfect, so he grabbed him around the hips and lifted him up (earning a surprised squeak from the detective), to dance around in their still very glittery, and very
for John.
Before John can get a word in, they’re bullying their way into his living space in a big cluster, while he’s distracted by several bone-crushing hugs. Rosie- whom he had strapped against his chest out of convenience- blubbers happily at the intruders.
“You’ve been my partner for years, we just didn’t call ourselves that. I know you, Sherlock. There’s nothing you could possible do to change my mind”
John would listen, shaking his head fondly at the sheer dramatics of it all. Sherlock continued talking, even though Greg had joined John, asking him politely if he was free after this. John remembered that he promised himself to invent Greg out for a pint to thank him for his help when Sherlock had his breakdown, so he agreed happily.
“There are some highlights,” John jokes to deflate the empty feeling he gets in his chest when all the awful stuff that has happened in the last years catches up with him. Being shot and PTSD, loosing Sherlock and loosing Mary and somehow loosing himself along the way.
“Because I’m terrified, okay?” He huffed, a little surprised at his own outburst. “There. You got your answer.” He debated storming out of the room, for dramatic reasons, but the warmth of Sherlock’s embrace- which didn’t loosen one bit during their conversation- kept him rooted right where he was. He felt Sherlock’ heartbeat- erratic and fast, and
entertain in front of said army doctor) huffed a satisfied “Cheers”.
John, despite everything, fights a small smile. Their enthusiasm about everything is so…. Overwhelming. Yet it’s genuine enough that he’s already starting to like them. Sherlock would be a tougher nut to knack, though. He suppresses a shudder and vows himself to intervene should any of them want to interact with Sherlock alone. He wasn’t ready for that kind of damage control.
“Go ahead” His voice wasn’t even shaking (This shouldn’t feel so much like an achievement).
And John shouldn’t feel so bloody miserable about it. But as he tried to take the hand of a wailing, complaining toddler, who stomped with her feet and refused to walk more than two steps at a time, he felt bloody miserable about it. They were a team, God damn it, and he was once again left alone to deal with everything. The moments of self-doubt were rare, almost extinct since he entered his relationship with Sherlock, but when they occurred, they caught him off guard. Ever since his partner discovered the crack in his self-conscious, he methodically and considerately showed the doctor that there wasn’t one tiny inch of him that wasn’t worth being proud of – from the soft bit of stomach growing again, to his abilities as a father. But lately his partner wasn’t there to assure him (not that he needed assurance of anything, he was John Watson, thank you very much! A tiny bit of approval, that was all. Didn’t he praise Sherlock all the time? Wasn’t it naturally to wish for
But right now, it feels like it wouldn’t even matter. Tan knew it was there (because John told him, although spared him the less than pretty details) and yet he still told him that he found him physically attractive. Like the blotchy scar-tissue around his shoulder doesn’t define his sex appeal as a person.
“You don’t know half of it” John grinned, before making the decision to turn his phone off. Sherlock could deal a couple of minutes on his own.
“Does she now?” he mumbled, voice low and pleasant against John’s stomach. The doctor smirked (Sherlock could
Now that he located the source of the doctor’s negative emotions towards him, the next step should involve finding a suitable solution. Glad he actually found a reason, the detective added ‘apology’ on top of his imaginary list. He scribbled down ‘tea’ but crossed it out again, it was too plain, it wouldn’t do. John was genuinely upset. Not all the tea in the world could fix that. Same goes for ‘Buying milk’, although this one could at least be considered out of the ordinary. Before he could monitor it, ‘Hug’ was added to the list (Well, nothing wrong with that. Hugs were considered as a appropriate possibility to cheer up an upset companion. Shut up. I don’t want to hug John, shut up!) No, too much baggage with this one.
"Thank you, John"
on the genius. It must have shown on his face, for Sherlock’s gaze scanned him, nervously, a little …shy, before his eyes fell on John’s lips and stayed glued there.
“Hold ON a moment there” It wasn’t so much the suddenness of the exclamation, but rather the tone with which it was uttered that startled all the Yarders (Anderson, Donovan and Lestrade)in the room, as well as the world’s only consulting detective. John Watson - good-natured mate, gentle doctor, competent criminal catcher, extraordinary blogger, loving parent – had another side hidden within himself, a side which he chooses to keep hidden on a daily basis. This side had not much in common with the John Watson people knew, minus the name. No, this John was Captain Watson – a man who deserved great authority, a soldier who did not hesitate to kill, a man that could be frightening if he wasn’t met with the respect he deserved. Sherlock had heard the Captain’s voice before; it was proven one of John’s most useful skills when catching criminals. There was something about this voice which made it very hard to disobey. John addressed him with this voice on some dreadful moments in their lives; moments filled with violence and grief and death and frustration. This voice hurt Sherlock more than any of the few punches the doctor had given him. John had never used it on him again after they became a couple.
"Then wear my collar," was his solemn response.
Sherlock turned to glare at the second boy. "Alfie, who put you in charge of casting decisions?"
"You're not going to school," her father tells her.
By the time they leave, Tristram is yawning and Emily's leaning against her father, her head tilting to the side.
Doctor Watson waits a moment to see if Tristram has anything to add, but he doesn't, so he nods and smiles at him. "That's good. Those boys not giving you any more trouble?"
"Who was that?" Emily asks as soon as Doctor Watson sits down again.
'Usually' was a bit broad, speaking of their visits; they'd actually only been twice since the last Christmas: once in the summer for a combined birthday lunch for the two Holmes parents -- their birthdays were coincidentally just two weeks apart -- and then last month, when John had volunteered to help Mr Holmes clean the gutters. Sherlock's father took pride in having always done it himself rather than hiring a service, but Mrs Holmes had dropped hints to Mycroft about it not being sensible anymore for him to be climbing ladders at his age. Most likely she'd been hoping for her eldest to swoop in and arrange something behind Mr Holmes' back, presenting him with a fait accompli, but wind of the thing had found its way to John, who had promptly said he'd come help out one weekend. He'd managed to go about it in such a way that he did all the ladder-climbing, without Mr Holmes feeling that he wasn't the one in charge.
“What the fuck was that? Why the fuck did you run off again? Why, for the love of fucking GOD, can’t you stop throwing yourself in the position of almost getting killed?!”
It wasn’t even an evaluation of anything regarding his character. It was just an assumption about with whom he’d like to share his bed with.
He doesn’t really know why he said that, why he presumed that Sherlock should be interested in the attractiveness-level of his clothing, but the smirk he gets in reply is strangely rewarding and grounding at the same time.
All this time that he had been waiting for Sherlock to
John coaxed his friend in drinking a bit more, before he shoved him towards his bedroom door. "Try to get some sleep, alright?" (the lack of protest was one more indicator that Sherlock was utterly out of himself after the emotional outburst). He opened the door and pushed Sherlock gently towards his big bed. He leant against the doorframe and waited for Sherlock to settle, but the detective only turned his head in his direction and gave him a pleading look.
John feels like a right idiot for making this guy concerned, when all he does is trying to be nice to him and improve his life. He shouldn’t make this hard, it’s a fucking blessing as it is. The flat is not even near child-proof and he should be fucking worshipping the ground where this person walks on for lifting this weight off his shoulders.
“Hello, John”
And now, as he climbs into bed and buries himself deep in the covers, his back turned to Sherlock in an attempt to hide all of his sudden emotions from his friend’s deducting glance; now
“But at the very least, humor me. That guy is absolutely gorgeous and absolutely dangerous, which is- to quote Jonathan here- ‘like so hot’. And
“Speak of the devil and he is bound to appear!” Greg almost shouted, laughing. Sherlock came straight towards them, gaze never leaving John. To say the doctor was surprised was an understatement; but after all he should have known better than to switch off his phone. Sherlock Holmes never did anything half-assed, and if he set his mind on something, he’d do everything humanly possible to get it. John felt the urge to giggle, with the ridiculousness of it all.
. Save the heartbreak and the unbearable silence on Sherlock's part (John wanted to laugh at himself, for suddenly not wanting to shut that irritating, always deducing mouth. But he had missed the casual insults and observations about things only the genius seemed to see), of course. It felt even more than nice, if he was being honest. John found it fucking fantastic that Sherlock allowed him to take care of him. Every touch had been special and unique; an experience that most probably would remain a memory but nothing more.
Although he wasn’t really familiar with the protocol here, he was pretty sure that ‘clothed orgasm from kissing’ was ranking pretty low on the ‘attractive’ scale. He tried to hold on, he really did. He didn’t think John would be straightforward enough to gently trail his hand lower and lower over his hip and- It took him completely by surprise.
. And Sherlock mattered. John suddenly realized that it wasn’t at all the lack of initiation on his part that bothered him so much. He was scared of fucking it up. Sherlock was too damn important to him, he didn’t want to lose this man again in his lifetime, so naturally he was nervous about something that would alter their relationship so through fully. But it was alright…. Right? They both wanted this… right? John took ten quiet breaths, hand still on the doorknob.
"John, please." Mycroft glances toward the ceiling. "Unless you wish to hear the pitter-patter of tiny feet..."
"Your grandmother has servants?" Emily asks, slightly agog.
Tristram finally settles on, "He's nice," because it's bland and inoffensive and objectively true. Doctor Watson is nice to pretty much everyone.
'Not Chinese' turned out to be a quirky African-Middle Eastern fusion place that was woefully understaffed and had them crowded around a table that was clearly meant for just two people, but made up for it with the most divine lamb meatballs. John ordered their drinks, something Sarah had never heard of, but it was deceptively innocuous looking and had her feeling the effects after a glass and a half.
Tristram sneaks a look at Father and catches him glancing sideways at Tristram. They both smile sheepishly but hold still long enough for a quick inspection. Tristram stares at his father's pale irises, nearly colourless in the bright winter light reflecting off the snow. Is that really what Tristram's eyes look like? Not just the colour, but the intensity. The way they observe and absorb everything. The way they see all of Tristram's actions and intentions. The way they seem to bore right into and through him sometimes, burrowing into his brain and his heart. Is that what the woman - his mother - meant? Did she see that in Tristram's eyes too? Or did she just mean his eyes are the same indeterminate, cloudy grey as Father's?
John walked over, still holding the music. His smile remained tentative, as if he weren't sure whether to be pleased or not. Sherlock's fingers played nervously with the lighter in his pocket.
"You could have brought her along. In fact, I still think you should have stayed-"
"He's meeting someone," Irene says. "A private business meeting." She lets her long, graceful fingers linger on her neck and doesn't let her gaze waver from John's.
"You should go," Sherlock says in a low voice, without opening his eyes.
"No," Tristram's father answers with a glare. "I don't think I could stand to sit through Harry and Clara's inanities."
"What exactly do you think I've been doing to him?" she asks incredulously. "He's fine, John. My goodness, you'd think I was some kind of monster the way you're rattling on about it. I've made sure he eats his veg and is all tucked up in bed by eight-thirty every night. And I have one of the best hitwomen in the business watching him right now."
"No, and it's barely-" Sherlock caught sight of his watch. It was nearly nine o'clock. He really wasn't hungry, though. Getting wrapped up in a project tended to suppress his appetite. But he could see the strain and weariness on John's face and in his shoulders. A break would probably do him good. And Sherlock should give Gladstone his dinner, anyway.
John grinds to an abrupt halt and turns to check Sherlock's reaction, but he is fixated on Irene.
She stands up, grinning, and flings a handful of snow toward him. She wasn't able to form it into a proper ball, and it falls apart once it leaves her hand, landing far short of him in little clumps and flakes.
"Well, help me out here, Captain!" He rounds on John and stands in front of him, glaring down at him with something approaching desperation.
In Swiss German, there is a saying: FIGUGEGL (say 'fee-goo-gay-gull'), which stands for 'Fondü isch guet und git e gueti Luune' and means 'Fondue is good and makes you happy.'
Mrs Hudson is standing at the foot of the stairs, one hand on her chest and a woebegone look on her face. She reaches out to touch Tristram's cheek as the paramedics slow down to negotiate the front door. "You see to it you get better fast, young man," she tells him. "I'll be by to see you as soon as they have you settled in. You just tell your father or Doctor Watson what you need and I'll bring it. Oh, and Doctor Watson, do make sure to bring back that afghan," she adds, patting his arm. "It's my lucky one from the raffle."
Again, Sherlock answers without John needing to say anything: "Even someone like Magnussen may draw the line at involving children so directly. But indirectly? What do you think Mary would do if she found out you had cheated on her with one of her bridesmaids?"
"Either scenario three, four, or five then. Answer it." Sherlock steps in close and puts his head next to John's.
"Sir," Sergeant Wyzoczky said, the bemused curiosity clear in her tone. "What are they...?"
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
"That's what grown-ups do when they fancy each other and they're alone." Emily leans closer to Tristram, close enough that he can see her individual, light brown eyelashes. Tristram supposes that might be true, for most adults. But he also knows that his father does not fall into any of the categories involving 'most' people. Which is fine, but Emily doesn't know that, and it's a bit difficult to explain.
Father dumps everything back into the envelope. "Thank you," he says curtly and brushes past Uncle Mycroft to the door, which he holds pointedly open. "We'll be sure to send a postcard."
"You can pile everything up there," John says, indicating the sideboard next to the sink. "I'll wash up later. I just want to get this food put away." He sets about transferring the leftovers to plastic containers.
John's attitude softens. "Maybe I can help," he offers. "I mean, I don't know what threats you're looking at, but I do have tactical experience."
The unpleasant prickles from before have precipitated and solidified into a hard lump of unhappiness in Tristram's stomach. It's not so much that he'll miss Emily sleeping in his room or reading together at bedtime or having someone to eat with, but the knowledge that he's driven Doctor Watson even further away. Maybe he and Father won't even be friends now. Maybe he won't help with any more cases.
While it was true that a couple of the children had taken away scrapes from the incident with the Blackwood students, the rest of John's statement filled Sherlock with an inexplicable, quiet fury. "Don't be maudlin, John," he said tightly. "You're the one they like, not me."
"Fuck no. Just... don't touch anything else."
Tristram sits forward and touches his father on the shoulder. He has his mobile out and is texting something. "Father?"
"He is extraordinary," Mike acknowledged.
"Slightly ironic, this," John says, not quite able to look Sherlock in the eye. He levers himself up from his kneeling position and settles next to Sherlock on the edge of the bed.
"Do you want me to... Should I touch you?" She stepped closer, uncertain but determined.
Tristram doesn't understand most of that, but he does get the feeling that perhaps Father isn't as surprised by Tristram's report as he thought he might be. "Do you know who it was?" Tristram asks.
"Here. I didn't get you anything for Christmas either." John reached inside his coat and pulled out an envelope, which he held out to Sherlock.
Of course Sherlock didn't have any of the music with him. It was all back at his house. It seemed a waste of time to go there first, then to the school. There was no reason they couldn't look over the music at his house together. He could sit at the desk, and John could sit on the couch-- No, they both had to be able to see the score. John could sit at the desk, and Sherlock could stand behind him. Or they could both sit on the couch--
"Um... yes, actually. Quite desperately, in fact."
Sherlock frowns. "No, she isn't. Whatever gave you that idea?"
"I er..." John sucks in a breath suddenly. "...was interested," he finishes, not altogether convincingly.
Tristram wouldn't mind going to the toboggan run again, actually. He's not sure what else he can really do with his cast. But then he'd also thought he couldn't go tobogganing, and it turned out not to be a problem. Maybe they can put a plastic bag around his cast like they do when he bathes, and they could go to the waterpark he saw in the tourism magazine on the aeroplane. Some of the attractions there looked pretty fun.
The compulsive reaching for his mobile was just one of the many things he recognised as signs of a nascent addiction in his behaviour. His thoughts constantly returned to John, so much so that he caught himself imagining John beside him more than once. Nothing else could hold his interest; he abandoned the experiment with the cow eyeballs halfway through.
Breakfast was another surprise, and much easier to deal with, in that he simply ate it. The apology had almost thrown him, but John decided to play dumb, and as Sherlock didn't correct him, he figured he'd passed whatever test it was. And that was that.
Tristram had stared at the maroon booklet as she slipped it back into her purse once they were past the border checkpoint.
Sherlock kissed him back like there wasn't going to be a tomorrow.
Sherlock exhales and settles back against the seat. "He had a full set of those wizard books on the bookshelves behind his desk; hardcover, no less. I don't doubt he identified closely with the main antagonist, Tom Marvolo Riddle, a.k.a. 'I am Lord Voldemort'."
"Always room for improvement, of course."
Sherlock let John take over the song rehearsal. Quite frankly, the children did seem to catch on much more quickly with his words and the looser beat, and Sherlock was more than happy to withdraw to the corner and do some reading.
"Life is a series of disappointments. I doubt this is even the first one that any of them have experienced."
"No one is coming after you, Tristram. I promise."
"I thought the whole point of this was that we wouldn't have to go into hiding," John says with barely suppressed temper as Mycroft moves to his computer.
(See the end of the chapter for
Father crinkles his eyes. It's the special almost-smile that he only uses on Tristram. Not even Mrs Hudson has ever been on the receiving end of it. That Tristram's seen, anyway. "Next time," Father says, "try not to get shot."
"I trust you implicitly, Holmes. Simply tell me what I may do."
(See the end of the chapter for
"That was so cool!" Emily practically falls through the door, banging it open in her enthusiasm.
"John … John," Sherlock pleaded, not even knowing what he was asking for.
It was a caution to both Holmes and me of how tender emotions may be perverted, and I thought perhaps to see in it a clue to Holmes' reticence in the area where the emotional and the physical overlap. I do not believe he ever fell into the clutches of a monster the likes of Gruner: I have seen the glory of his unclothed form, and it does not bear the marks of any abuse other than that which he has inflicted on himself. But there are other kinds of cruelty that may leave scars of a different kind. Like their physical counterparts, they can never be removed, but they may be soothed and softened with a steady balm of kindness and tender attention. It is that which I strive to give my one true and honest friend, my life's companion, through the dedication of my body and my will to him, and his in turn to me.
Tristram lets his eyes wander over the other travellers. In addition to those standing in line for rail tickets, there are people meandering between the shops, some laden with two or three purses or backpacks slung across their bodies. Others are walking briskly, like they know where they're going, carrying briefcases or pulling tidy little suitcases on wheels. He doesn't see any security guards. There are also no windows down on this level.
"Rrowxertsohneh," Father's voice floats back to them, rolling the R and making an awful gagging sound in the middle.
Sherlock didn't realise he was still hanging back until all of the children were already inside and John paused at the automatic door.
"But how do you make it stop?"he asks. He can't help his voice coming out plaintive, verging on whinging.
"Do you even believe half the shit that comes out of your mouth? They are going to implicate me." He shoves his hands in his pockets and looks toward the windows, black now that night has fallen. "Fuck," he adds under his breath.
Once we were settled, each with a cup and a plate, and the usual comments made about the weather and the state of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway, the conversation came inevitably round to the purpose of his visit.
It takes Tristram a moment, but he figures that must be Uncle Mycroft, telling Father he hasn't sent anyone to watch them this time. That's good to know, because it means if he does see anything out of the ordinary, he'll know for sure it's something he needs to tell Father. Not that, it seems, anyone is expecting anything to happen. Father just said they were all safe. Mister Tonga must have been the only real danger, and he's in police custody back in England now. Tristram does wonder a bit what the cut-off body parts had to do with it all, but they weren't threatening in and of themselves in the end. So maybe that's all right now. It's certainly a relief to hear.
And then Irene stops too, and before Tristram can look to see why, there are arms around him, pulling at him, drawing him in, and a scratchy woollen coat that smells like stale cigarettes and cold air and formaldehyde is rubbing his nose and cheek. It's Father, Tristram knows it even before he hears his voice or gets a glimpse of the black curls that flip out over Father's ear just like Tristram's.
As the dishes and refills came and went, and there were no probing questions about his personal life or his past, uncomfortable detours into anything resembling relationship talk, or any attempts to initiate physical contact, Sherlock relaxed and found himself truly engaging with John in a way he had rarely, if ever, experienced. John didn't always agree with him, but he also didn't react with disgust or suggest that Sherlock was abnormal.
"The sole will be dry: the head waiter's cravat had a faint orange stain which--"
"Yes." Molly nodded enthusiastically.
"Sorry, could I?" John gestured at the pocket where Sherlock kept his phone.
"What about you, Tris? You have any concerns?" Doctor Watson asks him.
She makes an exaggerated shushing face as she keeps advancing.
And what was Lestrade up to? It was true Lestrade had mentioned a desire to that effect but Sherlock had never had any intention of accompanying him. He shook his head. "He's going. No need for me to be there. All they're doing is finalising the arrangements for the chapel and the reception."
John laughed incredulously. "No, Sherlock, Jesus, I thought that was all settled. This is our project, yours and mine. I'm not doing it without you. I would really, really like to have your input on this. Please."
"Three of the methods are virtually bloodless," Father informs him, as if affronted that Doctor Watson would have considered him so barbaric.
"You can ask him the next time you see him," his father says. "Honestly, I wouldn't hold out any great hope. In lieu of that, however, perhaps I can help you come up with an alternative power source."
"Damn you," I growled, by which I meant: more!
As Doctor Watson continues to put more bandages on his back, he hears a door open downstairs. It's Mrs Hudson's, though, not the outside door. Did his father actually go to track down the gunman? If so, Tristram would rather that Doctor Watson go help his father than stay here. Especially because Mrs Hudson is here now. Tristram can hear her, as from a distance, fussing and fluttering, but he doesn't quite register what she's saying. He expects he's closed his eyes again. It's too much effort to open them.
"Not him exactly... " Tristram qualifies his statement. "The light from his cigarette. It looked the same as-" He stops. He's not supposed to tell that he saw him in the stable. Although it won't really matter now, will it? It's not as if anything bad happened because he was sitting in there smoking rather than standing somewhere outside in the rain during his shift. Still, Tristram hedges and says, "The same as at Grandmother's. In the building across the street." He nods at the window overlooking the street.
Still, he sat back in his seat, reluctantly relinquishing his connection to Sherlock. It was probably good to take a moment. He caught Sherlock checking him warily. As if John might not be happy with the turn things had taken. The furthest thing from the truth. John grabbed Sherlock's hand and squeezed it firmly while planting one last quick, chaste kiss on the corner of his mouth. It was all more than fine.
"Sorry that took a bit longer," Doctor Watson says, but he's grinning in a sort of lopsided way and doesn't appear at all sorry. His hair is sticking up in back. From Father's fingers, Tristram realises. As if he's noticed where Tristram is looking, Doctor Watson smooths his hand over the back of his head. It takes a couple of passes before his hair goes down.
"And we can get out again. Break it off. No man's worth your family's life."
John cleared his throat. "I hope you weren't insulted before. During lunch, I mean, what Daisy said."
Sherlock stiffened at the suggestion; the answer went too deep, stirred up too many sins and failures.
This is set between chapters 22 and 23 and is based on prompts from Zain and JPerceval, who wanted to see Sherlock shopping for a not-Christmas present for John.
"No, this afternoon we're working with the Cuisenaire rods," Sherlock answered curtly. He sat down to drink his coffee, deliberately choosing a chair that wasn't near any other seats.
"Mycroft; what can he do?" Father scoffs.
&&&&&&
"No. I'm having a heart attack, aren't I?" Mr Holmes asked, sounding surprisingly calm.
Emily stops where she is in the middle of the room. She has on what looks like every item of clothing she brought with her, including her outerwear. Tristram can see her hat and a pair of socks sticking out of the pockets of her jacket. Her cheeks are red and her hairline is slightly damp already. Her face falls suddenly. "I don't have a helmet!" she all but wails.
"No, he had to get back to the ophthalmologist," Sherlock explained.
He was almost at the street on the far side of the square when he heard John call his name. He should keep going. It was petty, but John had ignored his texts all weekend and Sherlock wanted him to see how it felt. He probably just wanted to tell Sherlock something about the play, anyway, and Sherlock really didn't want to hear it. His traitorous feet, however, shuddered to a halt.
"Boys trying to be men," Aunt Clara says cryptically, coming over and putting an arm around both Tristram's and Emily's shoulders. "As thick as tree stumps and only about half as useful. Now come and help me pick out a DVD."
John, however, didn't seem fazed by Angelo's insinuation. In fact, he didn't react to it at all. Instead, he leaned forward with his elbows on the table and prompted, "So, the story?"
"No, I'm glad he did. You might have been lying under a bus somewhere, or kidnapped, or dangling by your ankle out the back window because you lost control during one of your bloody experiments!" John's voice had risen as he spoke until he was almost shouting at the end.
John made an appreciative sound as he took a bite of the salad. "This is good. What'd you put in? Some kind of nut?"
Sherlock saw there was nothing he could do to stop it, short of knocking John to the floor and making for a very different end to the evening.
John chuckles. "Not really a high bar there."
She quickly removed her clothes, letting them fall into a pile on the floor. Sherlock, on the other hand, laid each article of clothing neatly over a chair. His legs were even longer unclothed, and his bum even tighter. An unexpected jolt of desire zinged through her. He was creamy pale all over, not a hint of a tan line. When he was done, he turned toward her. His nipples were pink, in contrast to John's brown ones, and his penis was - not aroused. He looked to be of average size and uncircumcised.
Father used to read to him, when Tristram was little. Dorling Kindersley, David Macaulay, David M. Schwartz. But when Tristram figured out how to make the letters coalesce into meanings, they stopped. It was faster and easier to read for himself. He'd sometimes ask for help with a word here and there, but it would have felt silly for Father to do something for him that he was perfectly capable of doing himself. Just like he never asks his father to tie his shoes for him, or make him breakfast, or titrate his soil samples.
"We..." John repeats, as if probing for an explanation.
Emily begs him to show them the surprise, so he tells them to finish up their snack while he goes to get it. Tristram takes one more cracker, then rinses it down with the last of his milk and puts his dishes in the sink.
(See the end of the chapter for
John grinned and shook his head. "No, that's not- I'm just trying to understand. I... It's fascinating, from this end. But I have the feeling you're not always happy about it."
"You asked me something the other night, about John," Father says into the wind. His eyes are narrowed, perhaps against the sunlight reflecting off all the whiteness around them. It's so bright that Tristram's eyes are watering at the corners. Many of the other people on the terrace are wearing sunglasses. Tristram didn't think to pack any. He never would have figured he'd need sunglasses in winter.
"John..." Sherlock said, his voice reduced to barely a whisper. The anticipation was similar to the second time he'd injected a syringe full of cocaine solution into his arm. The first time he'd merely been curious; the second time he'd known what it would do.
"Why?" Sherlock demanded.
Sherlock is not most people.
"Just getting John settled," Mr Holmes said, unfrazzled. Then to John: "You'll find fresh towels in the bath."
John is all too familiar with that tone of voice. "Oh my God," he groans. "You have a plan, don't you. You and Mycroft. You've already been plotting your Byzantine little intrigues for us puppets to play out."
As they wait for someone to answer the door at Emily's aunts' house, Tristram suddenly wonders if this was such a good idea after all. The last time they were here, things went so poorly. He wishes he could think of something he can do to make sure no one gets angry. Maybe Emily will have an idea.
Mr Holmes pointed out a plaid, plastic-backed picnic blanket rolled up on top of an unused cooler. John dialed emergency services with one hand and tucked the blanket around Mr Holmes with the other.
&&&&&&
"Mrs Bowen's not a servant," Tristram says with a frown. "She just helps out. Like Mrs Hudson."
Grandmother laughs, which makes her appear charming and young. "Oh, John, really, it's nothing to spoil dinner over. I only meant-"
John stood up and stretched. "I'm for bed. Coming?"
John fought the unexpected lump that threatened to lodge in his throat. He put the cow back carefully, sniffed in the earthy aromas of sawdust and metal, had to clear his throat before speaking. "They're lovely," he said again. "You should keep at it."
Lestrade pulled a folder off his desk and read something out of it. "Yeah, army doctor, actually. Invalided out a couple of months ago. Mike Stamford put us in touch. Old classmate or something. Name's John Watson."
"No? It's got your M.O. written all over it." He nudges Sherlock with his shoulder. "Interrupt the date, insult the girlfriend, drag me off on the pretext of a case, and never stop to give me a clue what the hell is going on."
"So, any plans for today?" the man asks.
. His father didn't say anything negative when he found out Tristram was reading it; in fact, he seemed mildly interested. But Tristram knows that he generally looks down on non-factual narratives, especially those that centre on acts that defy the laws of physics, so he still feels slightly self-conscious about reading it when his father's around. He doesn't want Father to think he's wasting his time when he could be doing something more productive. Father never reads anything purely for fun, as far as Tristram knows. The only things he reads that aren't related to a current case are things he thinks might be useful on a future one. Who knows? Maybe Harry Potter will turn out to be useful some day.
"Looks good," he says.
But Watson was not up for japes that morning. "You're coming with me," he said sternly, taking my arm in his and steering me toward the entrance. "You haven't paid your respects once. Unless you've been without me?"
"They're just kissing!" Emily says, laughing a little. She turns the photo strip so she can admire it.
"Yeah, but he doesn't," John said, taking another sip.
The klaxon plays again and the same message blinks on the screen.
you, then you're not actually reading it, are you?" He smiles at her slyly. Tristram's pretty pleased with himself for coming up with this workaround.
"Nothing. Just haven't seen much of you this week."
"You're the ones who encouraged me to get involved," Doctor Watson hisses.
"What are you doing?" he asks, watching her half warily and half with excitement. Emily always has such good ideas.
"Not going to last that long," she admitted, a little breathless.
"Yeah, just needed to stretch." Doctor Watson rests his elbows on the headrest of his seat so he is facing Father. He is still smiling. He wets his lip and looks around, as if checking whether anyone is watching them. Before he can say anything, though, his phone must buzz, because he straightens up so he can take it out of his pocket. He unlocks it and reads whatever message he's received. He glances at Father and raises his eyebrows. Father is staring steadily at his phone, but there is colour in his cheeks.
"Okay. Anything else?" It looks like Doctor Watson's holding his breath.
Tristram relaxes back against the couch. He's relieved that Doctor Watson didn't find anything wrong with him. He must have thrown up all the bad stuff.
John's about to protest that he hasn't moved out, he has every intention of going back, but then Magnussen can't know that—or maybe he can. Maybe he knows better than John... or at least better than John wants to admit to himself. There's still the baby, though, and the fact that threatening Mary means threatening their child, whether he's living with her or not, but Sherlock's a step ahead of him there as well.
Their eyes met, both of them stock-still. Sherlock's arse was throbbing, every heartbeat echoed and amplified.
Doctor Watson recognises this too. "I'll sit in front," he says.
"Your grandmother's, apparently." He sounds like he's not entirely happy about it.
Thank you to my wonderful beta reader, ruth0007!
"No, Sherlock, seriously, you're not exactly making this any easier."
He grins and follows his father toward the building. He doesn't fail to notice, however, that Father left one person out of his enumeration of who wasn't in danger: himself.
"You're sure this is all right for you?" Sherlock asked.
"Usually, yeah, but I couldn't," John said. "I'll put her down upstairs and leave you the monitor."
"There are still two more songs, the duet for Mary and Joseph, and the last one with the scene in the stable," Sherlock reminded him. He found he didn't actually want John to leave yet. Or, perhaps, ever. That was bad. Having fun and enjoying this situation was one thing, but becoming dependent was something else altogether.
John exhales. "So, okay. It's..." He lifts his head and looks at Sherlock. "I haven't. I don't have anything against in in principle, but if neither of has experience... I like how things have been going. There's no rush, right? I - It's my fault for all that 'properly' rot, I'm sorry if I made you think-"
"This was never his project, John. It was ours."
"It sounds like the two of you had a productive afternoon anyway," John says with the glimmer of a smile. "And the good news is, I still have a job. The bad news is, it's time for bed. Both of you. Come on." John puts his hand under Sherlock's elbow, nudging him up off his chair. Sherlock stands.
Neither of them had mentioned that afternoon at Whitehall, or the police, or the bank account, or anything else that had happened, although Sherlock felt John's eyes on him a few times, the weight of unanswered questions behind them. Was he supposed to say something? Things were going well enough now. He didn't want to ruin it all again by bringing up past unpleasantness. If John wanted to know something, he should ask directly.
She smiles, seems genuinely pleased, but then why shouldn't she be? It's her idea.
"I - am bloody - fantastic," John said, a little shakily but trying to sound light-hearted. "You?"
"Can we go up to my room?" Emily asks, stealing a conspiratorial look at Tristram. Tristram's both relieved and disappointed. He doesn't like being caught in a room with uncomfortable adult conversations going on, but on the other hand he thinks there's less chance his father and Doctor Watson will get angry at each other if Tristram and Emily are in the room with them.
He jerked his thumb over his shoulder to indicate they should be going. Greg had left the city earlier to pick up his parents from the train station, and would be meeting them at the church. They'd begged the use of a car and driver from Mycroft. Recalling the favour from Helsinki. At least part of it. It would take several cars and drivers to balance out Helsinki.
for me, no, I'll just go have a chat with the nice criminals and goad them into blowing my brains out, and for good measure why don't I put my head right in the fucking middle of the rifle scope?'"
. Agreed to everything with no intention of following through.
“Brother, dear”.
"There we are" John smiled. Sherlock didn't look at him, but held his friend's hands just as tight as he had held the jumper seconds before. "C'mon" John managed to free one hand from the death-grip, but kept the other securely wrapped around Sherlock's cold palm. "Let's go home".
Lestrade ordered Donovan and Anderson to continue their work instead of standing and staring. Although they obliged, John could still hear a comment whispered under a breath; a comment about questionable methods of raising children between crime scenes and dangerous experiments. He tried in earnest to ignore it.
“They’re comfortable,” he defends himself weakly.
A byproduct of not caring for those around you was your trained indifference with regards to the feelings of others and the social appropriateness of one's behavior. Before John Sherlock didn't care, but now he did. He wanted John to like him, he wanted John to stay, to be praised by him. It was the only insecurity he allowed himself to openly display (without emotional breakdowns) when he openly searched for his only friend's approval.
“Excuse me for a second” he mumbled with his smooth baritone voice laced with fondness, while he rubbed his slightly wet eyes with the back of his hand. “There’s something I have to do”
"John" he whispered again, voice small and teary. He didn't recognize this inflection of weakness. He wasn't used to being this flawed.
When his friend had taken a few hesitate sips, John had mercy and opened his arms. "Come here?" With relief written all over his features, Sherlock hurried to the couch, right into John's embrace. John gasped, surprised by the fast impact of detective against his chest. Still, it was a very Sherlock thing to do. Sherlock didn’t do half-hearted, he put everything he had into every little task at hand. Hugs, apparently, fell under the same category. Sherlock not only accepting, but downright craving physical contact was something completely new to him too; although, John had to admit, he could get quite used to it. The tall man relaxed completely once he was curled against his friend's broad chest.
Remembering this, John finally speaks: “You’re daft.”
If John wasn’t going to comment on this, then he wouldn’t be, either. He was aware that they passed the line of platonic friendship at some point, but he didn’t really understand the realm they currently walked in. All he knew it was fragile, and big, and so very
I'm thinking about adding a bonus-chapter that is more smutty than my usual style, would you guys like to read something like that?
A choked-up sound pulled him out of his mind. John covered his face with his hands in an attempt to muffle his wet sobs. He was not really succeeding.
A little over four hours were far enough time to let Sherlock suffer. He actually felt quite sorry for ignoring him, but he couldn’t help himself. He knew Sherlock was safe, thanks to Mycroft and Greg, so it was good to have a little time to clear his own head. Although, if he was being honest, he only spent around 50% being irritated / working himself in a mood, and 50% missing Sherlock terribly. Not really a success, huh?
“Your coffee”
And when John stumbled out of the shower and Sherlock sat in his chair, clad only in a wine-red robe and loose pajama pants, the doctor took him by the hands and they danced, without any music; and laughed, without any reason; until they stumbled into the bedroom.
Sherlock just turned his head, studying both men with his quiet, deductive expression. When he finally spoke, his voice lacked its usual bite: “Thank you. For what John said”
John momentarily tightened his grip, before he eased out of the embrace altogether. He didn’t look at Sherlock, but he didn’t have to for the master of deduction to pick up the sense of shyness and vulnerability still surrounding his blogger. Another strong emotion washed over him. To protect John, to please John, to make him
. He couldn’t even help himself right now, he just wanted Sherlock to
Really nice.
“We still need to clean up this mess, though” He gave Sherlock a pointed look. “You could make yourself useful,
Sherlock was facing his naked toes and wiggled them sheepishly. The visible piece of his pale collarbone was tinted a light rosy. If John wouldn't know better, he'd say that Sherlock was embarrassed. But Sherlock was never embarrassed, right?
“I’m not mad anymore” he whispered, pushing his cheek against the nest of hair. “I’m sorry I ignored you”, he added, while rapidly blinking the gathering wetness in his eyes away. He would not become an emotional sod over a heartfelt apology; he would not!
They definitely have to discuss this crush-situation.
Of course, British sensibility keeps him from voicing any of those things. Instead he smiles a tight smile which he hopes comes off as polite.
I'm overwhelmed with the positive feedback this story received by the way. You guys are AMAZING; keep those comments and kudos and bookmarks coming <3
Greg, nothing more. He was far too gone at this point for actual help; his life was a fine mess and he had come to accept that.
“Easy, I was just making a little-“
‘God damn it, Watson! You chase down London’s murderers, but break apart over a fucking tempter tantrum?!’ Yes, apparently.
John just stares at him for a full minute. Rosie blows a small bubble of spit in her sleep. Somewhere, a clock is ticking. John just keeps staring at Sherlock. The detective clears his throat and looks away, clearly confused by the unreadable emotions on John’s face. While Sherlock’s emotional intelligence has improved drastically ever since they started taking care of Rosie, John knows he still struggles with acknowledging his own feelings and recognizing them in others.
He had deceived him, that he did, but was working, against everything John thought he knew about his friend, to re-gain John’s trust in such a thoughtful manner nobody had ever bothered with before. John had never been treated like this before. John had never been
“You’re happy that you’re with me.”
John could only stare, mouth going slack at the sight before him. Sherlock was coming.
It’s the first instance he ever addressed those feelings out loud and they lift off his chest like a burden that has been sitting on it for years. The moment he utters them he becomes strangely choked-up, like saying them adds a reality to them that hadn’t been there before.
After a while of this back and forth, John decided his single bed was becoming too small for two people sleeping in it on a regular basis, so instead of retiring to his own room after going through his bedtime routine, he went to Sherlock’s room. The first time, the detective was absolutely baffled, a remark possibly already on his lips, but something in John’s easy smile and the way he cuddled closer into Sherlock’s expensive sheets, stopped him.
bed, feigning indifference, while he was clearly buzzing with nervous energy. John allowed himself a small smile, when he dropped the dressing gown again to crawl under the covers instead. Sherlock made a nearly inaudible sound when the mattress dipped with the newly added weight when John laid down on his side of the bed, facing the detective. Even in the darkness, John could make out that the detective’s cheeks and neck held a rosy color. He was worrying his lower lip between his teeth. Thinking. Deducing.
But he was.
He had always thought about Sherlock from time to time, in a way considerably different than one would usually think about one’s best friend but it isn’t until the Fab 5 cheerfully forced their way into his life that these thoughts become more refined and prominent in his mind.
So it was about the Fall. Everything… every little thing had to be about the bloody fall. Sherlock had apologized. But Sherlock had also saved John. He did it all for the doctor, but he didn’t seem to get it! (That wasn’t true. Of course, he got it. There was scarcely a day where John didn’t show his partner how grateful he was for his sacrifices. But Sherlock was angry… John was angry at him and he didn’t do anything wrong!) Sherlock opened his mouth, but John wasn’t done yet.
When the first burst of excitement had subsided, John placed Sherlock gently upon the only clean stripe of their kitchen counter, and leand against him, face pressing lightly against his partner’s stomach. He breathed in the clean stench of
a look for that?). Sherlock, having regained some of his usual attitude, stared back at him challenging. John smirked at the expression in his detective’s face, usually reserved for really complicated puzzles. John sighed, more to himself, and mentally prepared himself for his next step.
to ask John today. There was a question that had been ghosting around his mind for the past two months, but he never had the nerve to ask it out loud. It was still a foreign concept to him to be anxious about speaking his mind, but damn, this was important. He had gathered up enough courage multiple times, but always chickened out in the last minute. The risk of John declining was… devastating to be honest. Sherlock honestly wasn’t sure how he would take a rejection. Still, he
John rather enjoyed the half a day off, picking Rosie up from Mrs. Hudson’s and taking her to the park; in high spirits as he was, indulging her every wish. Sherlock was nowhere to be found, unsurprisingly, but slipped into the hotel room quietly out of nowhere just in time for Rosie’s bedtime routine.
Once they arrived at Baker Street, Sherlock stayed true to his word, made a whole pot of Oolong, and turned their sofa into a blanket-nest. John was stuck with the intense emotions, when he returned from changing out of his sweated-through clothes and could do nothing more except for standing in front of the sofa and trying in earnest not be overwhelmed with the amount of affection directed towards him.
long time. “Don’t you?”
"I'll be right upstairs if you need anything" John assured him, before he turned around, in his mind already between his soft sheets (hell, this day had really exhausted him. He was getting old).
Without another word, the particular man was gone, coat billowing behind him dramatically. Greg suppressed an eyeroll. Always the dramatic, that Sherlock Holmes. He considered his next moves, while idly staying on the floor a little bit longer. Just as he was about to mentally prepare himself for some greasy takeaway and a lonely night in front of the telly, his phone made a noise. Unlocking it, he started to smile like an idiot at the messenger id.
He was working himself up about the different possibilities, unable to form a rational thought. He really wanted to get away, in order to return with a clearer vision about the situation they were in.
Luckily, he almost never needed to admit that he longed for Sherlock in
The second, third, and forth time Sherlock noticed went by similarly. The fifth time, however, he made a mistake. It was the fact that between the usual groans, an almost inaudible “Sherlock” joined the mix, and well, that was the final straw. John having terrible, crippling nightmares just a few metres away from him was one thing, but John having terrible, crippling nightmares
And suddenly, John felt very very bad. Sherlock wasn’t a man of emotions or affection, but he tried, for John’s sake. And now, he brought himself to initiate the most intimate contact they had shared (so far), not because he felt himself pressured under a social circumstance but because he
Sherlock stopped the pacing right in front of the detective. There was a wild look in his eyes, but Greg didn’t miss the spark of vulnerability underneath. Sherlock was clearly bothered more than he let on. And who would blame him? The man had zero experience when it came to relationships. And John was a good one, John was a keeper. Sherlock, apparently, was rather crap at keeping.
Sherlock, more than he had before, and the situation was both reliving and terrifying. He wished he could give something- anything- back. But nothing was enough. All he could do was to not bother his friend any more than he already did, with his pathetic neediness and pray that Sherlock would not stop caring for him. He
“Use your words, darling. Otherwise Daddy won’t know what’s bothering you and can’t help you”. Sherlock would know, tho. One glance, one fucking glance would be all Mr. Consulting-detective needed to understand the situation and solve Rosie’s turmoil. One fucking glance. Too bad he wasn’t
It’s hard to voice everything that’s whirling around in his mind right now; words don’t seem sufficient for the overflow of emotion that’s happening in his heart. And maybe it would be too soon. Maybe he should figure this out more.
had the potential to be so much more. To be something beautiful, something true, the only thing that mattered. Something to live for; because the only thing that mattered so much more than cases, and crimes, and deductions -Sherlock realized in that fraction of a second- was John Watson’s well-being. His happiness.
. Of course, it wasn’t that easy. They both knew it. But it was a start, a start they both needed, and a sweet promise of a future that didn’t look so lonely anymore. The old wound would still need some time to heal, but they weren’t in a rush. They had the rest of their lives, as far as Sherlock was concerned. Not, that he’d ever admit something so shockingly personal. At least, not right now.
He had stopped trying after Victor had left.
All the air in his lungs rushes out in a swift exhale and John feels light-headed again for the entirely wrong reasons. Maybe he’s about to fuck everything up. He rises from his sitting position and toys with the thought to escape from the hotel room never to return again.
Perhaps, it wasn’t that much of a deal as he made it out to be.
heard, this morning. Despite all the self-prepping about being accepting of his attraction to Sherlock, panic rises in John’s stomach.
“We’re almost home, Rosie. I’m not very pleased with your behaviour. Give me your hand, I’m having no more of this fuss”
“Just close your eyes” Sherlock shuffled a bit, that he was lying on his side, mindlessly slipped out of the soiled underwear and into his silky pajama bottoms (John looked the other way to give him some privacy. They weren’t quite at that point yet. Although it fueled some very
; that- after all those years and all those struggles, all those nightmares they have been through-
“What doesn’t make sense, then?” John snaps irritated. How dare Sherlock be so blasé about the whole thing?! It had been a big deal for John to admit it to himself and an even bigger deal to talk to Sherlock about it. And he just treated it like it was basically old news to him. He feels tempted to slip into a small temper tantrum, when he sees the look on Sherlock’s face.
That hurt.
Maybe had been a coward, excusing himself to the shower not even ten seconds after his lips left Sherlock’s surprisingly soft ones. It wasn’t really a kiss- a romantic and significant display of deep affection and a promise for more; it was more like a tentative question, a hopeful suggestion, nothing more.
The detective stopped sulking for a second when his thoughts wandered to the determining variable in yesterday’s disaster.
“I’m sure they’ll be fine” his voice was rough with a fond adoration for the genius next to him. Sherlock Holmes really was something else. Sherlock eyed his hands thoughtfully.

‘You wouldn’t, because you have a crush on Robert Downey Junior‘
Sherlock’s hand left his wrist and John swayed dangerously, leaning against the nearest wall, mumbling something about bruising to at least appear useful in any way. The information must have been enough, for Sherlock started firing a new wave of deductions, not even looking at John, who was no slumping against the wall, breathing heavily.
Maybe he shouldn’t presume so easily that he’s in love with Sherlock or that Sherlock might be…
"Drink" the John in question ordered without rigidity. Sherlock looked at him, insecurity still written all over his features. The doctor held his gaze persistent. He understood that Sherlock must be exhausted from feeling so many suppressed emotions and confused by most of them, but to figure this new situation out, the genius brain needed to be hydrated. Sherlock's hand flexed uncertain on his knee, jerking forward a bit as if he wanted to reach out for John, but was too embarrassed to do so. John understood that not only wanting but initiating physical contact was another completely new experience for the detective, but he was still more concerned about Sherlock's health. He nodded in the direction of the mug, and Sherlock huffed (a little more like himself), but nodded and reached for the tea.
“Doesn’t matter if you’re straight, gay, bi, or anything in between (Here, John starts to feel really bad for being so touchy about his sexuality with Bobby. Without a doubt, he must have told the other guys and he can’t help wondering if they secretly think less of him now) you’re not blind.”
, it will be great.” Greg took one hand off the wheel and reached behind John, to give his partner’s knee a gentle squeeze.
“C’mon.”
“It’s just … Sherlock, it’s somehow too much. I don’t know, and I don’t want to bother you, but… and Rosie’s been cranky all day and I just bloody know I’m a bad father, but it still hurts when the prove hits me right in the face and-“
The tea was cold, but closeness he could do. If his friend would allow him, that is.
During their drive to some unknown destination, Karamo engages John in light small talk about his time in the army, marriage, and parenthood. More self-conscious about the camera casually sitting at the dashboard, John gives truthful but slightly less emotional answers than he had when he and Antoni talked about Sherlock. It mostly boils down to the army being hard but his job as a doctor being worth it, marriage having been hard but worth the experience (he carefully emits the part where Mary shot Sherlock), and parenthood being hard, but Rosie making it all worth it.
“I could keep bees” he continued, cursing himself for rambling, but unable to stop the embarrassing stream of words to escape his lips. “You could write mystery novels”.
"Let me offer you a last piece of advice" He addressed the crying woman, who clung to her husband's frame like a drowning person would cling to a lifeguard. "A team of medics will arrive shortly-" the husband was about to rise his voice again, but John discreetly ignored him- "Get her tested. Let them help her. For her own sake. I'm terribly sorry"
John stopped breathing for a second.
“You’re clearly upset, John, do calm down”
“I. Don’t. Want. A. GODFORSAKEN. Coffee!” He started hissing, but worked himself into a full scream at the end.

The genius’ thoughts started whirling around yesterday’s attack, trying to find some logical connection between actually memories and panic-induced hallucinations.

He tried again. A fellow student this time- Victor Trevor. Handsome, likeable, quick-witted Victor Trevor. It must have been somewhat closer to love, then. And it ended, of course it did.                    “Look, Sherlock. You’re so… much. And yet you’re… just not enough. I’m sorry”
Sherlock nodded soberly, pressing the heels of his hands against his eyes tightly. “I’m messing everything up”
It was a big house, the kind of house the newly rich used to appear sophisticated, when in reality all of these houses somehow looked the same. Rosie almost skipped at his side when the doctor pushed the dark wooden door open. The first thing he saw was the mess in the living room, the second was a quite exhausted-looking Lestrade leaning against a hideously expensive looking painting, the final was curly head of the one and only Sherlock Holmes. He didn’t bother to look around any further, for all his attention was at an instant focused on his partner.
“See, there’s no need to dress like you’re eighty. You’re a man in his best years and

With every moment passing when his life was invaded and turned upside down, he felt his confidence in this mantra slip. Only just now he came to fully acknowledge, that Greg might have a massive point. He might need the help of the Fab 5 more than he initially anticipated.
"Harry. Just do it." The order comes out perhaps more forcefully than he intended, as he adds in a softer tone, "Please. Pack her a bag."
"That's not what I mean," John says pointedly.
"I know," John said, pulling back to try to see Sherlock's face. "But you have anyway. You really have." He knew what Sherlock meant: his body, the curious bond forged by sex. He felt it too. They were ready. He cupped Sherlock's jaw with one hand and caressed his cheek, ran his thumb across Sherlock's lips. Sherlock had already given him the gift of himself, of his bared soul. Of his trust. John wasn't trying to downplay the fact that he wanted to do this, not at all, but the fact that he was approaching it as lighthearted flirtation, when clearly it was something that meant a great deal to him, made John feel fiercely protective of him, and want to do it just right. Not in a rush on his way to work. On the other hand, would there ever be a perfect time? They were just as likely to be interrupted by a summons from Lestrade, or a drop-in client, or a bomb going off in the street outside, no matter how much time they set aside. And it was somehow fitting that it was here, in their flat, where their relationship had started, in what was now their bed, that they finally took this step.
Victor stopped short to give him a look of alarm. "Murder?"
Sherlock shrugged noncommitally. "Just wondering where you'd got to."
John wandered in and sat down on one of the child-sized desks. "Listen, about Molly..."
Doctor Watson opens the door. Emily is with him. Her hair is damp, and she's wearing a yellow striped t-shirt that hangs down to the middle of her thighs, with a pair of flowered leggings underneath. At first, Tristram thinks the t-shirt must be one of Doctor Watson's, but then he notices the cut of the neckline and realises it was probably her mother's. Tristram doesn't have anything of his mother's. There isn't even a picture. He's never wondered about that, but now he does. Did she not leave anything behind? Or did his father destroy everything? Not that he has any particular need for a memento of a woman he never knew. He's just curious.
When they switch to the second train, Emily shares out the sandwiches and the rest of the biscuits. Doctor Watson goes to the restaurant car - it turns out there is one - and comes back with drinks for them all, carefully balanced in a cardboard tray. There are little bottles of apple juice for Tristram and Emily. Tristram drinks some of his, but it's fizzy, which he wasn't expecting, so he puts the lid back on and sets it on the little tray by the window.
Irene smiles like she was just waiting for someone to say it. Her teeth are very white. Although perhaps it just looks that way because her lipstick is so very red. "It's meringue," she says. "I figured you have to eat something with meringue at least once while you're here."
"I knew you'd come back. Tris said you always do." Emily throws her head back to look up at Sherlock, grinning. "Where is he? Did you leave him at home?"
Something moans slightly next to him. Emily. He hears the antique joints of the field bed creak as she turns over. "Daddy?" she says in a sleepy voice.
Sherlock vaults over the railing. John clambers after him. When he drops to the ground, Sherlock is already halfway across the lawn. "Get the lights, John!" he yells over his shoulder.
"Didn't see the finger 'til after," Tristram says, mumbling into the duvet. The whole thing makes him feel sheepish, now. Father would certainly never have made that mistake.
"Found what you were looking for?" John asked.
"The hell they can't!" John speaks over him. "It'll be obvious to them by now that you weren't the one who pulled the trigger. You couldn't have, the shot came from outside. Add that together with both Tristram and Emily skipping school on Friday and me not showing up for my shifts at the hospital."
he's invited me along as well to make sure you go."
"No." Tristram's certain that wasn't a problem. Father has neither any respect for property nor any illusions about the appropriateness or lack thereof of rough play. "I think he just needed some air."
"No, I'm-" Sherlock was unsettled. Was he being asked out on a date of some sort? "Dr Watson, I-"
"Did you do that?" He doesn't sound angry. In fact, Tristram thinks he detects a smile in his eyes. He breathes out.
They kiss slowly, small unwitting sounds from both of their throats mingling and encouraging, pleading and confirming, circling them before being blown away by the wind.
"Yes, fine," Sherlock said, hastily sweeping the jars of mud aside. "Drink?"
Sherlock doesn't even need to think about that. The world without John Watson would not be right. Unthinkable. John Watson, Sherlock thinks, may quite literally keep the world on its axis. Sherlock's world, at any rate. He doesn't know how to say all that, but he hopes it comes through in his answer: "Yes."
"He's been doing that all day," she says, although that isn't really true. He was out all morning - working, granted - and then he spent a large chunk of the afternoon with Tristram and Emily at the microscope. And Tristram has the feeling that he hasn't really been occupied with anything important since dinner. He's just waiting for Doctor Watson to come back so he can go out and interview that witness, like he said. So there's really no reason for him not to read the book.
And so he lashed out with his best weapon: the truth. "Why," Sherlock spat, "because you thought I was trying to help you when I didn't remind you about your cane? Do you know why I did that? Because I wanted to prove you were mentally unstable! I went straight to Lestrade and used it as evidence against you."
"That," John said between gasps of laughter as they walked away from the concert hall, "was absolutely insane!"
Once alone - except for Gladstone, who had followed and now stood looking up at him, hopeful for kibble - Sherlock pressed his hands against the counter and tried to think. John. Here. He was here because he
John stands up as well. "She's still going to be groggy from the anaesthetic, I imagine."
"Why didn't Mycroft-" Sherlock begins, but John breaks in again.
They were finishing their coffee before Sherlock thought to check his watch again and found, to his surprise, that two and a half hours had passed.
"We can't hear what's going on out there with the water running," he says gently.
"I realised I'd rather be in here," John said. His voice was breathy: nervous (how long had he been lying awake, trying to talk himself into coming over?).
They both sit and watch Tristram for a while, not saying anything. He has a drip attached to his left hand. The other one is heavily bandaged. Bandages are also visible on his back, just above the cover that's pulled up around his shoulders.
This time, it was John who said, "I think you said something about a bed," low and breathy against Sherlock's navel.
In the meantime, he picked up his violin and fiddled with it, tuning it and plucking it until he felt settled enough to try an actual melody. He wasn't sure what he started with, but he ended up playing a piece that John had mentioned liking the last time he played it. It was slow and plaintive, not quite sad but perhaps a bit melancholy. Perhaps a bit the way he felt when John was out and he was here, alone, with his unwelcome thoughts and impossible dreams and all the awkwardness of being pimply and seventeen and knowing what he wanted but also knowing he could never have it.
"Um, Mr Holmes? Mr Watson?" Molly's voice broke in. "We're ready?"
John bangs his head back against the headrest. "Jesus Christ,
"I'll have to go with you anyway, John. Only next of kin can change the notification order."
A low whine from the back of his throat. Iron bands around John's ribs. John kept his hand moving, kept it moving, nothing fancy, just rapid, straightforward friction, until Sherlock's keening broke down into gasps and his body tensed, shuddered, and jerked, and all the tension drained out of him.
"Shh, sh, we're going to wake your parents," John said, trying to whisper through his giggles. He felt as if he should be about thirty years younger to deliver that line.
"You could send her alone with Mycroft..." Sherlock suggests. "With you out in the open, there would be no reason to go looking for her."
John straightened up, looking nonplussed. "Yeah, of course. You're going to be fantastic."
"Never theorise without all the facts," Sherlock muttered, trying to stop from doing exactly that.
Sherlock snorted in amusement.
Sherlock stacked the folders and tapped them sharply against the desk to straighten them. "It's fine," he said. He got up and picked up his suit jacket from the back of his chair. "If you want to bring her in, as I said I'll-"
"Mycroft Holmes. Not a coincidence, is it?"
She also asks about permission for the surgery on Tristram's hand (something else he doesn't want to think about right now). The papers are still on the table, unsigned. Father elbows her aside and scribbles his name down in a very put-upon way, then stalks back over to the chair beside Tristram's bed. She gives him an odd look, but gathers everything up and says the doctor will be in later in case Father has any questions. Tristram wishes Doctor Watson were still here. He rather thinks Father wishes the same thing, if perhaps for different reasons.
?" She points up the stairs, adding in a whisper, "I didn't dare go in after the way he snapped yesterday."
Finally he lifted his massive cockstand out of his drawers and, with a deep groan, spilled over my stomach, splashing out a white rain that seemed as hot as the wax had been on my overstimulated skin.
Sherlock mentally clenched his fist in victory. Aloud, he said solemnly, "Yes."
They sit and watch Emily pilot some kind of frog creature on a motorcycle around various race tracks littered with obstacles. Doctor Watson leaves his hand on Tristram's foot. After the third scenario, Tristram's actually becoming interested enough that he thinks he might want to give it a go. It does look pretty easy.
"No," Father says. Tristram squeezes his eyes shut in case they do something stupid like start tearing up. He's not a baby. He doesn't need his father to go with him. He knows Father is right: there's absolutely nothing he could do at the hospital. He'd just get in the way and insult the doctors and there would be a big fuss, and Tristram desperately wants him to come. Which is stupid, and not going to happen. He knows that.
"She knows you," Emily points out, adding unnecessarily, "She's pretty."
"Oh, come on, Sherlock!" John sounded honestly irritated. "Jesus, you'd think you want this to fail.
Sherlock sat back and held himself steady with one hand pressed against John's good shoulder and the other holding his genitals out of the way, his thighs rock-hard with the strain of kneeling only halfway upright. John started out slowly, both hands gripping Sherlock's hips hard enough that he was sure to leave marks. Sherlock gloated over the prospect.
"Then either I was very lucky, very tidy, or cleaned everything but the bath afterward."
"Yes," Emily answers frankly. She gets off the couch and goes over to plant herself in front of Father. "Do you have any severed feet?"
Honestly, it was great that the two of them had finally got themselves sorted, but a little professionality wasn't too much to ask. From his team at least; he didn't hold out much hope for Sherlock and John. Greg was happy for them. Really. They'd both been through so much. Sherlock's fake suicide. John's wife shooting him (and Jesus, if that hadn't been a shocker). Her death. Sherlock's relapse. That whole nasty episode with Culverton Smith. Greg had the feeling there had been some other stuff too, either during or after that investigation. Sherlock had been unavailable for consultations for several weeks after Smith's arrest, both he and John cagy over what exactly was going on.
"What are you here for then?" John asks. His voice is surprisingly steady and casual.
John was already waiting outside the restaurant when Sherlock arrived. His face broke into a wide smile when he saw Sherlock. He'd obviously showered and shaved within the last hour, and his teeth had been recently cleaned. There were many possible explanations - aside from the obvious - for his thorough hygiene, Sherlock told himself. He might have been to the gym earlier, or been moving to a new flat, or spilled something foul, or been vomited on. It was difficult, in the face of John's honest, open regard, to stick to his resolution not to respond with a ridiculous grin of his own.
"Okay," John said carefully, unwilling to jump to any sort of conclusion at that rather provocative opening. No, he was not even going to speculate.
"A bit." John sighed. "But I understand the sentiment behind it. Thank you. I actually had a similar idea. Sent out a few applications. Even had an interview last week." He handed the phone back to Sherlock.
"Hell if I know," John said gamely over his shoulder. "I'm just trying to make sure he doesn't do a swan dive while he does it."
Hash Browns
John sighed. "Sorry for making you come."
John's blue eyes softened and took on a darker hue. "Of course. Was going to anyway. I mean, I've practised."
"They do," Father says.
Tristram doesn't often travel by Tube; when he goes out with Mrs Hudson, they usually walk or take the bus, since most of the shops she frequents are local. And his father almost always travels by cab, at least when Tristram's with him. So the Underground, in its novelty, is exciting.
Doctor Watson stands there, still facing the door, for a few moments. When he turns around, the laughter's gone out of his face, although he doesn't look sad, exactly. More frustrated.
Emily rolls her eyes, but comes back. "I'm not leaving. I just want to see if he's coming yet."
Watson's mouth pressed closed, but he squared his shoulders and went over to the seat. Sherlock frowned when he saw the difficulty with which the man manoeuvred himself into the too-small chair. Watson's leg stuck out stiffly, and he had to turn to the side to keep it out of the way. Well, he could have said something if it was uncomfortable, Sherlock decided. He determined to ignore him and continue as usual.
"We're useless. Everyone knows we're useless," another child chimed in.
Tristram gives her a quick kiss and says, "Good night."
"Of course."
Sherlock spent the weekend composing the rest of the songs for the Nativity, walking miles upon miles with Gladstone, breaking into the email accounts of Whitehall employees, and teaching Gladstone to identify and locate various chemicals by smell. His activities led to some interesting discoveries, including the entrance to an abandoned Tube station, and a PA who was receiving kickbacks from a travel agency and a catering service for sending business their way. He was unable to get into his brother's account - Mycroft had it housed on his private server, rather than on Google as the bulk of the company's email accounts were.
When my nose, my lungs, my very being were saturated in his essence, he finally, finally lifted his head to cover my mouth with his. The taste of him was ambrosia, the scent in my nostrils from his most intimate places become liquid and sweet, and I eagerly lapped and sucked at his mouth, his neck, wherever I could reach. The scent gland at the base of his neck was swollen and hot, ripe for a bond, but even through the heady cloud of lust that had overcome me, I knew I must not bite. There were no well documented cases of alpha-alpha bites resulting in a true bond, and many that ended with lymphatic poisoning. There was too great a risk, and in any event it was not something I would do without leave.
"Is it all right..." he asked, solely to convince himself that he was committing to the action and not out of any sense that permission might be a good thing to gain.
"Oh God, it wasn't," John said faintly.
Doctor Watson pulls back to look at Father. "You can't know that!" he says incredulously. "I don't care how brilliant you are, you cannot have known what they would have done."
John turns his face down and away, but Tristram doesn't need to see his expression to know he's angry.
Sherlock slipped in amongst the crowd of parents and children - most in the maroon-and-gold school uniform - milling around the stalls that had been set up on the floor of the auditorium. Hand-dipped candles, etched glass baubles, straw angels, hand-knitted mufflers and tie-dyed scarves attested to the manual talents and creativity of the student body. Then there were more professionally produced wares, such as carved wooden crêches and fair-trade woollen ponchos and tasseled hats. And finally, the foodstuffs, ranging from homemade biscuits and fruitcakes to freeze-dried apples, candied ginger, and gourmet chocolates.
"The dog couldn't have called the fire department, or told me who set the fire!" Angelo said.
"Good. I mean, yeah, that's good. But um... What exactly did you say to him? Because I talked to him, too, and he seemed a bit confused."
"Is it a token that will gain us admittance?" I asked presently. I knew that some clubs distributed a ribbon, scarf, pin, or other small item as a sign of membership, although I had never before heard of nor seen a leather strap around the neck serve such a purpose. The question was posed with what I felt was exemplary calm as I lifted the piece to place it against the pale skin of his exposed throat, resting my wrists on his shoulders to steady them and conceal the shakiness that had inexplicably come over me.
She looks up at Father with a curious expression. "Did our time machine work?" she asks.
"Ooh, this one's nice. Feel." Molly rubbed the jumper against her cheek and offered it to John.
THE END
Time: 15:46
"Coincidences have been known to happen. Not everything's part of some huge conspiracy theory."
John's heart skipped a beat. "No?"
"Yes, but you've probably spent the past five years building up an immunity to iocane powder."
Sherlock reached for one of the bottles of water that stood on all of the tables. "Old school friend of Molly's. Neela something or other." He cracked open the bottle and drank straight from it.
"I already know the story."
(Mycroft himself had security cameras installed in every room of his own home, including the bathroom, although a wily assassin would find the shower area and toilet to be perfectly invisible lurks, should he or she somehow make it to the inner sanctum otherwise undetected. He wondered in an abstract sort of way whether he might have added additional blind spots, had there been any prospect of another body warming his sheets. Probably not.)
"Absolutely!" he says, full of enthusiasm. "Trust me, John. Switzerland is a neutral country. Safest place in the world. Nothing to worry about." Father pushes himself up off the couch and swirls around to face them. "Now I suggest you all go pack your things again. We can leave for the airport as soon as you're ready."
Sherlock picked up another slide, still not looking at John. "Mine's closer to the bathroom. Might be convenient."
He waits for a couple of minutes, motionless, to see if something else happens. It doesn't. It was probably just a trick of the eye, like a fata morgana or something. He wouldn't even think twice about it if it weren't for the person with the cigarette outside his window last night.
Finally, the wedding cake. A frothy, over-the-top, multi-tiered confection in white and silver. Sherlock couldn't help comparing it to John's. John and Mary's. He realised he never thought of it as John and Mary's wedding, only as John's. But without Mary, there would have been no wedding. None of the rest, either. Maybe not even this. Would John have settled into this thing with Sherlock, whatever it was, if it hadn't been for her? Would he have met someone else? Found happiness with her? Impossible to say. Unproductive to speculate. It didn't matter. John was back home now, after a long and arduous detour.
"Yes, it is," he agrees. He puts both hands on Emily's shoulders. "Say good-bye to Tris. You'll see him in school tomorrow."
"Where are you going?" Tristram asks, still whispering.
I glanced out the window. The sun was shining for the first time that morning following two solid weeks of heavy rains. Well, it was a small thing and seemed important to him. He asked for so little. Too little. As well, I was never good at withstanding a temptation when the object of my craving was dangled so tantalisingly before me.
"Come now, Sherlock." Mycroft spoke as if cajoling a young child. "How do you think John will feel if you continue hiding him from your family? He'll think you're ashamed of him."
Tristram is even quicker. He is off the couch in an instant, hurling himself at his father. He squeezes him around the waist with his one good arm and burrows his face into his coat. He doesn't care that hugging isn't something they do, and maybe it won't be again tomorrow, but it is right now. He doesn't know why, but he needs to. He's going to explode if he doesn't. It's worse than after Friday Afternoon.
"Dad?" Emily's voice is accompanied by a tentative knock on the door, followed by her face peeking in.
"You're doing great, Tris," Doctor Watson says. "Just a couple more metres." Tristram can hear he's trying to sound upbeat, but he doesn't manage it very well. For some reason, it brings to mind the story Doctor Watson told him earlier about Gents, and how Doctor Watson said he could never be unfeeling like that, how it always hurt him too when other people got hurt.
Father is not in a good mood. He's done nothing since they got in the car but stare out the window, clutching his gloves in his lap. He hasn't corrected the driver's route so much as once, despite the fact that even Tristram could have chosen less busy thoroughfares. If he didn't know better, he'd think Father didn't want to go on this trip after all. But it was Uncle Mycroft who didn't want them to go, and Father who insisted, so it must be something else.
John crouches in front of Tristram's chair and puts his fingers around Tristram's wrist to check his pulse. "Did he lose consciousness at any point?" The question's obviously meant for Irene, who's stood up now and is drifting away toward the window.
"It is." John heard the smile in Sherlock's voice. He lowered his hands and looked over at his friend. His truest one. His partner. His lover.
"We're going to the dockyard," Sherlock said, as if that explained everything.
He smiled faintly. "We will see. We have started off like this, and it has been successful thus far. Now ..." Here he lowered his hand, and his somber demeanor was replaced by something much more like his usual cavalier confidence. "Show me what booty you have returned with from your voyages."
"As for Holmes" -- and here I felt him tighten his elbow around mine, although his gaze remained steadfastly fixed on the monument before us -- "I wanted him, I think, to see that he has nothing to fear. That you are not a ghost that haunts my days or nights, but a dear and fond memory. When I leave this place and return to our home I do not take you with me."
First things first: she had to make her excuses to John. She took the bottle of contact lens solution out of her toiletry bag, unscrewed the top, and dumped the contents down the sink. In case he checked. Not that she thought he'd be suspicious, but this was Sherlock Holmes' colleague, best friend, and co-conspirator. He noticed almost as much as Sherlock did. She rinsed the sink thoroughly and was about to bend over to take a drink when she thought maybe Sherlock would like it better if her mouth still smelled and tasted like John. Oh, she hadn't even thought about whether she was going to kiss him. Somehow that seemed more intimate than intercourse. She supposed she would, if he wanted to. In for a penny.
So Sherlock waits. Holds the picture of John and his dead baby and waits, and wants. He's never been good at denying himself what he wants. He manages it for John.
"A figure in a children's story?" Sherlock surmised, then waved the notion away when John confirmed it. "Dull." Sherlock couldn't fathom why John would be comparing him to such a character. From the description, she sounded more like Mycroft, if you ignored the 'magic' bit and read 'stomach' for carpetbag. And he did always have an umbrella over his arm; Sherlock didn't doubt he took it on aeroplanes with him as well.
"Oh, no, absolutely," John agreed before Sherlock had even finished his sentence. He pushed his chair back so fast the legs skidded on the floor, then hesitated. "Did you want to finish your tea first?"
Sherlock shrugged and popped a couple of crackers in his mouth before answering. "I was able to get him off a drugs charge."
"All right, we're going to have a little warmup." John was standing up on the stage in the assembly hall, with the pupils arrayed on the floor below. He kept talking, something about how important it was to warm up one's mind and body both blah blah blah. Sherlock tuned it out.
John cleared his throat. "Five minutes, Sherlock." He wasn't at all sure Sherlock heard him.
"Of course." That... actually made quite a bit of sense. The stamina and ambition necessary to train as an orthopaedic surgeon coupled with the strong sense of morality and wanting to help people were characteristics that could lead to a career in law as well.
When they go back to the living room. Emily's there, setting up a video game on the console under the big television screen.
"And if I'd stayed with you, you would have refused to shoot as soon as you saw the situation. The plan, such as you knew it, was in actual fact unworkable. My way was the only way it could work."
"Haven't I just made it clear that there is no other choice?" Sherlock snaps.
Busy? -SH
He also doesn't know what to do with her statement that she's proud to be his mother. And why would she have to deserve it? As he understands the way the world works, a person doesn't have to do anything in particular to earn parenthood. It just kind of happens. He's apprehensive, though, about what she might be going to do to earn it, and what 'putting an end to this thing' will entail. It sounds very final.
Once they were both under the covers, John kissed him. It was much better and much worse than Sherlock had ever imagined it might be. Better because they were together in John's bed and John was warm and naked and his mouth was sweet and earthy and his hands were on Sherlock's skin. Worse because John was drunk and under the influence of a benzodiazepine derivative and didn't actually want him here at all.
The students were gathered around a man (ex-military, forty-ish, irregular sleep patterns) sitting at one of the tables. So this was the classroom assistant. So far, completely unremarkable. He was wiggling his fingers and appeared to be leading them in song. Sherlock started thinking of ways to make him leave of his own accord. Their enunciation was terrible and there was little resemblance to a melody, but it sounded like something about a child named Susie. Utter twaddle in any case. And the bell signalling the start of lessons had already rung.
Sherlock tapped on the Reply arrow and started his message.
When Sherlock arrived at school the next morning, the scene was even more chaotic than it had been the previous day. The children were flinging pieces of folded paper back and forth across the room at each other, and the noise level had to be heard to be believed. John, of course, was in the middle of it, giving as good as he was getting and looking like he was having the time of his life. As soon as he spotted Sherlock in the doorway, he took aim. Sherlock dodged, and the folded paper sailed harmlessly past his ear. Sherlock went into the hall to retrieve it. An aeroplane. He quashed the childish impulse to shoot it back.
"I've got him, I've got him!" Doctor Watson shouts at the same time. "Stay down!"
Sherlock shook his head in annoyance at himself. "No," answered firmly. "No, it's fine. I won't keep you."
That gave John pause. "All right, no," he said. His voice was tight and low. "I didn't know that. I wasn't actually thinking of that, either." His left fist clenched and unclenched. "I was thinking of the way you smiled at Ollie when he showed you his aeroplane, or how well-trained and -cared for your dog is, or the fact that you paid twenty pounds out of your own pocket beyond what Greg had given you, so that the kids would have the best tree on the lot. Or the way you listen to me, and watch me, like... like I'm interesting, like I'm not just an unemployable, nearly homeless, mental and physical wreck."
John waited for him, and when Sherlock was even with John, stepped into his path, leaned forward over the boxes they were both holding, and kissed him. "Our bedroom," he said, smiling, his face resting against Sherlock's.
The luggage man gives Tristram and Emily a knowing smile. "It is your papas' first time here?"
He can't quite see Doctor Watson's face from where he's lying on his stomach in the ambulance, but he can see his hands. They clench, then straighten out slowly, as if it's taking a concerted effort to relax them.
"So you're my son's lover," she says.
Sherlock scoffed, because really, if John was going to insist on his little position of moral superiority, he was at least going to have to own up to it. Plus, Sherlock couldn't shake the feeling that John had let him in for a reason, as if he were allowing Sherlock the chance to give him something: a password, a secret handshake, a thumb drive with an algorithm that would magically rewrite the past week. "You patently can," he retorted. "If I'm still allowed to walk freely on the school grounds then certainly no one's going to stop you. Unless you mean you don't have bus fare-"
In the bathroom, she did a cursory clean-up, just enough so nothing was dripping down her legs. She'd have to put something on to go down the hall to Sherlock's room. And of course all her clothes were back in the bedroom, and the hotel didn't provide dressing gowns, and- She had to stop and force herself to take a couple of deep, calming breaths. She thought it was quite possible she had more butterflies in her stomach now than she'd had the very first time she'd had sex.
Sarah would have been content to end the evening right there. If she hadn't made that arrangement with Sherlock... But she had, and after the insights she'd had tonight, she couldn't in good conscience leave him alone now. She was going to need to get up to go to the bathroom and clean up a bit anyway. She gave John one more kiss, and rolled off to the side. "Be right back."
"I've arranged a field trip this afternoon," John informed Sherlock when he entered the teachers' lounge on Thursday morning. John was looking particularly well: he was sporting a fresh haircut and a new jumper, obviously bought with the help of a woman. He'd also cut himself shaving, so he must have either been nervous or in a hurry, although not because he was running late from oversleeping. Possible distraction during his morning routine? It all added up to him having a girlfriend (a one-night stand wouldn't have helped him shop for a jumper) whom he'd spent the previous night with, but the underlying tension in his body spoke against that conclusion. That and the fact that John wasn't the type to play the field behind someone's back, and Sherlock was certain that the dinner, at least, had been a date. He comforted himself with that, as he found the idea of John having a girlfriend was not one he particularly wanted to dwell on.
Mycroft sighed in a put-upon way. "Someone should stay with Mummy."
"Well of course they did, who else are they going to call? And you should know by now I'm not one to judge. You go on and help him. He thinks better with you there, and afterwards you can go to a nice restaurant or have a night in. Just bring her down along with her PJ's and nappies and whatever she needs. Better bring that pop-up cot thingy too and I'll keep her with me overnight. She does sleep through the night by now, doesn't she?" All good deeds aside, Martha wasn't about to get up and prepare a bottle at 3 a.m. But she hadn't heard the baby crying at night for many months now, which was why she was prepared to offer in the first place.
Sherlock couldn't recall any particular excitement, unless John meant the normal chaos of the children gathering their things and leaving at the end of the day. John had gone out to help them, that was true. But then he'd come back in. And he'd forgotten about the cane much earlier. Gladstone was becoming restless, wondering whether he was allowed to sit or whether they were going to continue with their walk.
Emily gets up and leans against the side of the piano, where she can still see, and Uncle Mycroft slides onto the piano seat beside Tristram. Tristram knows he plays pretty well, but he's nervous about what Emily will think. Beethoven's
was John still sitting on the sofa?
"It doesn't matter what I say, I can't make you-"
"I'm not." Not about Emily, anyway. And not really about Doctor Watson, either. He wouldn't mind at all, in fact he'd think it was pretty cool to have Emily's father staying over, if the whole last-night-thing hadn't happened. And the beach. But maybe that's over now. Maybe Tristram walking in on them made them decide not to … do that anymore. It's an uncomfortable thought. Uncomfortable either way. Because if they stopped, and it's because of Tristram... Shouldn't he be happier if he's got his way?
"Enjoying the view at the moment."
He makes an annoyed sound, but unhooks the jacket. "If you installed a coat rack at an appropriate height, that wouldn't happen." At their flat, Tristram has his own row of hooks that he can easily reach.
"I don't know," Tristram repeats, suddenly frustrated with the whole topic. He doesn't want to talk about Irene or divorce or why any of them are here. He scowls down at his notebook and scrapes his pen against the paper so hard it rips the page.
Emily seems to be thinking along the same lines. "Well if they are, they have to get divorced now," she says, as if the whole thing is settled.
Without responding, Sherlock pushed his way back out through the children who were now crowding up to the windows to get a better look.
"Yeah, Sherlock." John's voice is thick now too.
The show began.
The toboggan run, it turns out, is pretty much like a roller coaster. There's a metal track built down the side of the mountain, zig-zagging back and forth, and two-seater sledges that sit on the track and run down it. There's no engine and no way to steer. The only control the rider has are the two handbrakes on either side of the sledge. The fog is thick enough that Tristram can't see the bottom of the track. Tristram is very excited to try it out, especially because Father is going to go with him.
Sherlock reached down to pull the covers back and found John already hard with clear fluid welling from the tip of his penis. The sight, and the knowledge that John had remained this hard - or been revived - untouched, merely from kissing and whatever emotions were playing out in his head right now, caused a fresh wave of desire and something akin to wonder to surge through him.
"I had a piece this morning on our way out and I feel fine," John assured him. "I'm just going to check your pulse, all right?" He slipped his fingers up under Mr Holmes' jaw. Fluttery and weak, his skin cool and clammy, and his muscle tone slack.
"All right, Tristram," Nisha says, turning her head so it's aligned with his. "I'm going to give you a little poke in your arm so we can get some medicine into you. Do you think you can hold really still, or should we let your dad's friend hold your hand?" She smiles while she says it, but it's clear he doesn't really have a choice. He's going to get poked either way. It's not that he minds needles. But usually when he wants some blood, he does the poking himself, or else Father does. He's not sure he trusts her not to make it hurt. Also, he remembers how it felt to shake Doctor Watson's hand. It was nice and warm and safe. He'd like to have that feeling again. But he doesn't want to look like a baby who needs coddling.
