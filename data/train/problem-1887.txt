“Yes! You and your constant denial forcing me to keep quiet when I’ve been full to bursting with this, this, this… emotion!”
“Could use a cuppa,” John mentioned to the ceiling, eyes closed.
John smiles against his forearm. Bless the bastard, he‘s letting John get away with his quite obvious freak out, even if he doesn’t know exactly what caused it.
The son shook his head in fear, begging Sherlock to quit while he was ahead.
“I mean, regardless, it’s kinda fucked up.” Bill turned with a scowl and John's heart sank to see it. He’d really thought they were friends. If Bill couldn’t handle John’s sexuality it would be hard to even remain roommates.
But...
They stared at each other.
So Sherlock turned the book towards him to show what he’d managed.
It’s by no means a comfortable wait, but neither is it a walk to the gallows. He’s still in that cocoon of stasis, where consequence means little to nothing. He’s just so bloody tired of straddling this line between one path and the other. So he’ll float here, above it all, until Sherlock decides for him, as always. He’ll trust in that. They’ll either travel together or John will leave Sherlock to travel his own path while he continues on with Mary.
In one smooth motion, he pulled Sherlock’s foreskin back and sank down onto his prick until the blunt end pushed against the back of his throat. No sound could be heard until he sucked hard on the way back up, which warranted a loud gasp from the recipient. John missed it because he’d closed his eyes, but he heard and felt Sherlock fall back down onto the table, taking a petri dish down with him as his arms splayed. John’s lips stretched into a smirk, but he let it go without comment.
John knows he must look ridiculous, that his hair is sticking up from static and he’s grinning like a loon, but he’s just so undeniably happy none of that matters. They fight over who’s unbuttoning whose shirt, which seems to take forever in John’s opinion but actually only probably takes a less than a minute.
“I didn’t mean to wake you if I did,” John went on to apologize as Sherlock blinked up at him.
"Might I have a word?" She asked sweetly.
"It's fine, Sherlock. Hardly a flesh wound. Burns like hell but I'll live." He let Sherlock fuss until he was assured John was right. "I'm a doctor, remember? And this isn't my first time being shot."
She smiles back, still nervous but more comfortable with herself in her welcome. "You probably don't remember me but I've never had a chance to say thank you for what you did for my mum and me and I just..." She toys with her bracelets and chews on her cheek. John takes the opportunity to puzzle out her story from his memory. A client, clearly, but he's having a hard time placing her. She's tall, taller than John, with dark skin and wide eyes. He'd place her age at around eighteen or nineteen, in sort of a punk phase, if her blue braids and nose ring are anything to go on.
Sherlock’s ankle was killing him, burning and tight, but he wasn’t going to get up, not if the flat burned around his ears.
The kid wrinkled his nose. “Can’t imagine you’re any good at that. Too romantic. I bet your work drips Keats and Wordsworth.” John smiled at that. “No, drop the poli-sci, go into pre-med. You listened to your inane girlfriend when she said you couldn’t do it. You shouldn’t have. Medicine would serve you well.” He gave a nod in decision.
“It would look bad on a housing application,” Sherlock mumbled. “Switching locations three times in one year.”
His grin turned sickly. Apparently the effects of the cough medicine hadn’t kicked in yet. Or perhaps he needed more.
By the fifth sighting, John is pretty much convinced the man is following him. Or, at the very least, somehow anticipating John’s route before he does, since he seems to always be where John is; either just arriving or just leaving. John can't help but become just a little bit more obsessed with each sighting. Yesterday, John had spotted him under a tree at a rest stop outside Flagstaff, clearly arguing with someone on a mobile, though he’d been too far away to make out the words. He'd simply watched as the man paced back and forth, hand waving in agitation, curls tugged on in frustration.
Sherlock looked them both over as one would bird shite on a newly washed vehicle.
John looked up and sure enough, Greg was pulling Sherlock along, as the man practically drug his heels the whole way. He set Sherlock down in his chair as forcefully as Mary had John. When Sherlock made to pop back up Greg pushed him back down again. He bent down to whisper in Sherlock's ear, smiled at John and Mary and then left them for his own table.
"Poetic? No, I don't think so... Maybe, um, the details were more
...and waited.
They walked hand and hand back to Laila’s dorm. He waved a hello to Gail, kissed Laila, with a promise to call tomorrow, and walked slowly back to Baker Street. He’d promised to think about everything Lalia had brought up during dinner, but he broke that promise, only thinking about putting one foot in front of the other until he hit his bed.
“Ah,” he casually responded. “I’m sure it’s fine.” He tried not to be obvious about studying it, but he was fascinated to see it under such close proximity. He’d only ever caught glimpses of it when John reached the stage of inebriation that he pulled his shirt off and started dancing. The clubs he frequented were usually too dark to make it out well and he’d always kept a strict distance between them on the dance floor.
"I don't care. For the love of god, just hurry up!" He threw his arse back at John like an award winning porn star and John honestly forgot what he was arguing about.
“The wrong dots,” John points out.
“That was quite the adventure back there. Thanks for letting me join.”
“I will not be condescended to by someone who clearly learned Arabic from a Palestinian,” Laila shot back, turning John’s bewildered shock up several notches.
“No good, I’ve been to Scotland. It’s shit.”
John looked sceptical, body still turned half away like he wanted to flee. “About what exactly?”
“Bollocks!” Sherlock shouted through the door. “Cough syrup is perfectly legal! I’ve put a lot of thought into this!”
John’s eye twitched. “You know I have no idea what that is but I’m sure it would have been lovely.” He patted Sherlock’s shin twice more and then stood up. “I’ll just, uh, go see if I can’t borrow some ice from Mrs. Hudson.”
"Sort of defeats the purpose if he doesn't tell anyone but you," Mrs. Hudson pointed out dryly.
John noted, belatedly, that Sherlock’s hand fit the entirety of the back of his head, as he held John, forehead to forehead. Sherlock let out a satisfied sigh, and then moved back against the chair.
John scowls incredulously at the door. “Really? You’re two feet from it. Just toss it by the door.”
Molly grimaced to find during their adventure at the bar she had lost track of Mary, who was now chatting excitedly with Sherlock.
He rolled away so Sherlock could sit up. He wasn’t sure if John could see his frown but he did his damnedest to broadcast it despite the near-perfect darkness.
“You were saying?”
He looked down at his incomplete rendition of the arterial spray from the Atwood triple murder and then up to John. “Doodling.”
Sherlock’s lip twitched in amusement but he didn’t let it blossom into a full smile. “John, where’s my laptop?”
“This wasn’t the part I thought you’d have a problem with," he answered back.
“John,” Sherlock turned back to his flatmate, “this is Victor Trevor. My…”
"Use your words, Love. What do you need?" He teased.
“With who?” He practically growled.
“Oh yeah?”
"Curious about what?" John asked.
“No! You obviously couldn’t care less about seeing me, you just wanted a pawn. It’s pathetic, that’s what it is. I can’t believe I actually thought you wanted to see me. Months with no word and suddenly, out of the blue, you decide to call? I’m an idiot.”
John laughed as he pressed another kiss to Sherlock’s mouth. He let John up after that, who carefully pulled the condom off and dropped it in the bin for him. Sherlock settled under the sheet while John meandered to the loo for a clean up. His mind was blissfully blank as he rested against the pillow, no thoughts of John abandoning him or what their future might hold. Just a pleasant warmth coursing under his skin and a lassitude in his limbs that made him feel wonderfully heavy.
Sherlock blinks at him again, saying nothing. John’s watches for some sign that he’s been heard.
“What does Afghanistan smell like?”
Sherlock immediately sat up, glaring down at John. “Don’t you dare!”
“Thank you,” he breathed softly. “You shouldn’t have made him mad, but, thank you.”
Sherlock's first instinct was to snap out a scathing observation about John's intelligence but he refrained,
Greg picked up quickly where Molly had been going with this. Jealousy sparked pain, causing more consumption of alcohol. Nicely done.
Had they gone to a pub after? John would have loved the chance to show off his dancing ability, so maybe he would have drug her to a club instead. Dancing with a woman wasn’t something Sherlock had seen John do, and knowing what constituted dancing in a gay bar probably wouldn’t fly in the kind of place Olivia would venture, Sherlock wasn’t able to fully visualize it.
With less thought than he would to make tea, John gets up, grabs the laptop, and walks the short distance to the sitting room.
The kid looked back, shy. “Really? You think so?”
John growled in satisfaction when the whimpers turned to shocked gasps and John braced himself for the inevitable aftermath, as hot flesh swelled and pulsed against his tongue. He was more than up for the challenge and he swore to swallow it all down when it came.
When John looks over, Sherlock is waiting expectantly, glancing at Greg like he was waiting on something specific.
He groaned and pulled Sherlock back against him as he went back to giving it his all. Sherlock's nails went back to scraping at the leather.
"What?" He asks, worried he's been unclear on some point, gotten something wrong.
? Picking out flowers and sodding serviettes with your future
"I'm here. Just enjoying the view." He slicked up his fingers and set the bottle aside.
Mycroft sat and pulled a cigarette from his breast pocket, which took a bit from Sherlock’s sails. “You’d just reached Acton when I was made aware.” He handed the cigarette over, putting his own to his lips, before materializing a lighter.
John pecked him on the lips. “Not at all, she seems perfect. Christ, she’s cooking breakfast! You’d have to push me out the door to get me to leave.” At that he rolled away toward the end of the bed.
paying them.” He gave a self-deprecating smile.
John rolled his eyes as Sherlock stood and walked to grab his lighter. When he returned, he placed the joint in his mouth, lit the end, puffed once, twice and then leaned over to hand it to John.
Greg looked down but all he could see was dark curls. "John?" Sherlock nodded. "I don't know," he admitted. "He probably thinks so."
decided it was a waste of time and then you called Greg a sycophant for suggesting it."
“Yeah, course,” he answered and moved to sit at the table.
“But the food-"
you get the body parts? I’ve never thought to ask.”
"Who?" Greg asked, confused.
“Yes,” he drawled in response, hand in the air for a taxi. John looked both hesitant and begrudgingly impressed by Sherlock’s London Magic when one appeared. “Still interested?”
“Hmm,” Sherlock hummed, seemingly interested in the
“Thanks,” John mumbled, one hand rubbing his injured fist absently.
"Sherlock," he warned. "Don't start."
John didn’t reply but his face conveyed a complex series of messages -
It seemed John didn’t have much of a choice. Something had happened during the course of their conversation. What, he didn’t know, but it had driven a wedge in their already uncomfortable morning.
“My hero,” John teases, trying valiantly not to lay it on too thick.
While Sherlock was busy panicking, the homophobe was busy working himself up to a strop. “You calling me a queer?” He yelled, voice breaking in his agitation. “I’ll slit your fucking throat, mate.”
David is; meaty you could say.” The kid nodded sagely. “She had finally pressured me into switching majors, just last week in fact.” He received a grin for that. “Poli-sci, right again. I was to be the next Prime Minister.”
He shifted forward again, sliding his hands under Sherlock’s thighs to heft them up and over his shoulders. Sherlock grunted at the maneuver but didn’t comment, just hooked his ankles and let John slip his hands underneath to grip his arse.
"Sure, I'll take two if you're cooking."
Sherlock seemed to think on this for a second before crying out in triumph. “Because they don’t exist! You
“I’m going to call for take-away. We’ll have dinner and then we can talk if you want. If not, that’s fine. I’ll give you time to figure it out your own way. But you should know,” he swallowed, feeling brave for the first time since he’d walked through the door after his hard day, “I’ll take you however I can get you. Whether that’s what we have now or something more, it’s all fine. Just know that I love you, as you are, all of you and if you’ll have me, we could make something very fine indeed. More than fine. At least I think so.” He cleared his throat after that monumental but simple speech and started to pull away.
“You’re not sorry at all, you lying bastard. You never are.”
John glanced back down at his phone and swore. He leapt up and dove for his coat, dodging around Sherlock for his shoes.
Eventually he rolled to a sitting position and leant up against the sofa, knees up, patiently waiting for Sherlock to come back. What the hell was he doing, anyway?
“Was that a bug!” John cried out, shooting himself from the sofa to get a closer look. He stooped to look at the tiny electronic pieces in awe, and the very idea that John was impressed sent Sherlock into a spiral of jealousy that had him up out of his chair in a flash.
John had heard the words enough, but hearing them spoken to another nearly undid him. He’d have to choose to believe they were so easy to say now because Sherlock had had a hell of a lot of practice.
He flipped the DVD in the air and caught it; for a long while he did this, until it became obvious that John, despite all evidence, had not actually found his boring date to be boring, and wouldn’t be coming home.
A tick appeared in Mary's eye brow. John knew that look and desperately wished she wasn't holding that Sig Sauer.
“About tonight? I think I want to move to Canada and start over as a sheep herder.”
He gave a start.
John leaned forward and rose up off of him and Sherlock calculated it down to forty-five seconds.
“Or what?” The breathless reply ruins any attempt at flippancy.
“Better?” John drawled as Sherlock took his first sip.
A petulant silence followed immediately by, "Just hurry up. I can think of a thousand other things I'd rather be doing than this."
He pointed at the skull. “That explains why you lured me up here.” When Sherlock raised an eyebrow John answered, “Serial killer.”
He sped his hand up, rolling his foreskin quickly over top of the head, over and over. He pictured Sherlock as he’d looked that first night, heaving and desperate. It wasn’t enough, visceral as the image was, because he’d tossed off to the memory a hundred times already. He needed something new. The feel of Sherlock's forearm pinning John against him as they thrashed. The very real possibility that Sherlock was at that moment tossing off to the same heated moment. John breathed out a steady stream of hot air through his nose as fire spread across his skin at the thought. Was it pulling Sherlock's hair? Was that what had set him off? Oh, he’d do it again in a heartbeat if allowed. John only wished he’d known then what kind of reaction it would garner, he’d have paid closer attention.
He wouldn't, he refused.
“Canvasing,” Sherlock bellowed back. “Something you normally learn at the academy.”
Sherlock nodded his agreement. “Yes, as I was saying, I didn't think you'd actually listen when I instructed you to stay away. It wasn't until the day you came to Baker Street that I realized the message had been misunderstood, not ignored, but by then it was too late anyway."
"Fucking idiot," Greg mumbled. "Well regardless we need to catch him soon."
“Christ, what - ”
John found all of this incredibly endearing instead of frustrating to the point of madness.
He couldn’t just move in, could he? What would that do to them, their friendship? John tried to imagine every scenario, from coming downstairs in the morning to find Sherlock hadn’t slept a wink the night before, to the constant struggle of forcing Sherlock to eat when he couldn’t get away with lying about it anymore, to sharing the loo. For fuck’s sake, Sherlock in the shower! Unacceptable! Except, there
“Whatever you want.” He settle in for his serenade, arms clutched around his knees.
John didn’t let the lie stand. He immediately dove for Sherlock, hand diving with precision into the huge, ridiculously deep pocket of his coat. Sherlock cried out in panic and clamped a hand around John's wrist in protest. A battle ensued, one the likes of which only people with siblings could recreate.
He jogged, not nearly as fast, toward the building. It wouldn’t do to storm the premises without first making sure it was clear of drug dealers, so he did a circle around first. It had likely been hours since anyone but the girl had been near, but better safe than sorry. Since no call of alarm had been raised he’d have to assume the kidnapper was long gone. He could see John’s torch beam through the frosted glass window, and then heard his muffled voice, soothing and authoritative. He allowed a smug smile to tug at his lips since there was no one around to see it. It was good to be right. Not that he’d doubted himself for a minute but…
What seemed like hours later, John responded.
“There are the usual classics but I wouldn’t want to give a
“That was… Christ.” John fell back against the opposite wall as he sucked in oxygen.
“It… was a clue?” John drawled, confused but working it out.
Do you think this has been any easier for me? Do you
Mrs. Hudson tittered behind her hand.
Greg makes a face, though John can't quite define it. "Huh, well, maybe you should. Could be, uh, enlightening."
“You know, sometimes it’s fucking annoying living in your shadow,” John growls.
Sherlock started at this bit of new information. His first instinct was to forbid such an endeavor but obviously he couldn’t do that. For several reasons, the most pressing being his irritatingly perceptive brother, who saw the flinch and read it anyway. John, thankfully, remained oblivious.
“Bon jour,” he tried, a bit sarcastically.
“I’m trying to be strong here, Sherlock. I told myself it was enough to get it off my chest…but you have to give me something. Don’t make me leave without knowing.”
What a peacock.
“Ants?” The man responded for the first time, perking up a bit. “Do you really think so, John? That would be lovely. Wouldn’t have to go outside to scoop them up. Been meaning to start that study of their foraging patterns, the way they communicate location to one another, that sort of thing.”
John blinked at him, sure he’d misunderstood. “You what?”
"But he hasn't taken a case in weeks," Greg concluded with a nod, making his point that something was wrong.
Sherlock frowned. “It is,” he entreated. “They primarily utilize echolocation, a far superior way of locating prey, but that doesn’t mean they don’t still see.”
“Now wait, I never said-"
“No, not even then.” He turned away and hobbled toward the tent flap. When he took the canvas from Scarlett she walked away immediately without looking back.
He waved that away. It wasn’t Laila’s responsibility, to handle Sherlock or dinner. The waiter swooped in and took their drink orders, leaving John feeling out of his depth when Laila suggested a bottle; the waiter looked at him and John had to shrug his agreement. As if he knew a Zinfandel from a hole in the ground.
“Mmm,” John hummed as he lit and inhaled the burning smoke. Tasted like shit but his chest was warm.
He allowed his eyes to open as he scanned possible ways he could have let this happen, why he hadn’t seen it coming. John’s lack of romantic and sexual partners in the last few months, and Sherlock had certainly checked, should have indicated a growing attraction between them. So why this sudden shift away? Had Sherlock been
He pulled away to speak, replacing his tongue with a petting thumb. “Are you ready to come?” He growled.
When Sherlock rises from the table and moves toward his bedroom, John has a brief, intense panic attack.
John smiled softly at their shoes but didn’t dignify that with a response.
Of course he wanted details. Sherlock tossed his head back against the sofa and huffed. “Something one of the PCs said to Lestrade after they thought I couldn’t hear.” John didn’t seem satisfied with that, so he went on. “You know, the usual, how can anyone stand to work with me, let alone have sex with me, et cetera.”
Of course John would run straight back to the club scene, of course he would. That was the obvious answer, wasn’t it? Sherlock pulled the phone away from his head and groaned mournfully, doubling over in agony.
Adrenaline courses through John’s bloodstream, but he forces himself not to act until he knows exactly what’s happening.
The whole time she talked, John just shook his head obstinately. “I can’t think that way. It’s too dangerous. If you’re wrong it’ll wreck what little bit of friendship we do have.”
“You’re not actually a doctor,” Sherlock pointed out above him as he flipped the lamp on beside them.
"Janine? Um," John licked his lips nervously, unsure why she was suddenly involved.
say, as the case may be- and he
"All right. But hurry up, would you, we've got people waiting." His quickly retreating steps caused both men to breathe out in relief.
John waits a beat before asking, "What?"
John watches from across the table as Mary frowns, not in displeasure but in slight confusion.
“Yes. You thought I was thinking about Laila when I was singing that damn song to you.”
“Give up?” Sherlock asked congenially.
“I can’t imagine that’s ever your motivation for anything,” he quipped, eyes scanning the darkness for movement.
“I should have used your cane as a kendo stick and knocked them all unconscious. Perhaps rendered a few of them unable to father children, hmm?”
She spoke softly, in that rhythmic Arabic she knew damn well John couldn’t understand. What the hell was she up to now? He moved forward again but she scowled and shook her head once, warning him away, as she waited for an answer from the other side.
“All right,” he agreed unnecessarily. “Let’s move on.” He brushed past John and slid out of the van gracefully. With one hand on the top of the door frame he turned and looked in after John. “Coming?”
Eventually John spoke up again. “Where
"I didn't find out until after," she whispered, accents switching again. "I was gone, sent away, didn't know it was for a reason until I got the news. Seb did to me what he tried to do to you," she waved the gun at Sherlock, "send you away from the battlefield. But it follows you, everywhere. It's always there, love, isn't it?"
“Well, let’s see. With absolutely no prompting on my part, you kissed me-”
John stared as Bernard stomped off, a look of disbelief writ across his face, one that quickly morphed into that blistering rage he’d held onto since their fight.
“Sherlock, a word,” Victor announced, slapping his napkin down onto the table. He stood and walked away, sure Sherlock would follow.
She had nothing to say to that either. So be it. John wasn't going to hash it out more than he had to.
“You’re high and you’re looking for sex with a possibly unwilling partner. It’s unconscionable.”
, he tells himself.
John froze, even though he hadn’t really been moving. He felt something snap inside his chest...and then something dark crawled out. He pictured red lips on Sherlock’s pale cheek, red nails raking those strong forearms, and John thought the black treacle in his chest might very well crawl out of his mouth.
(See the end of the chapter for
He takes a sip of coffee and stares her down. "Sure you don't want to hold out for Jonathan Creek?"
But even that old adage doesn't ring true. Because he
“Hmm, how about a toffee apple?” She grinned up at him. Wow, but she was good looking.
He smiled at her, glad it wasn’t
"Geoff-"
He’d just alluded to another semi-naked encounter at a later date. Apparently John hadn’t been sure of his continued welcome. Sherlock smiled back.
“Why are you looking at me like that?” John wants to back into the loo and close the door.
Sherlock stopped frowning when John climbed back into bed, though he sat back against the headboard instead of crawling back under the blanket. Sherlock sat up as well.
Without breaking eye contact, John slid down, half on the bed, half off, and happily watched as the recipient looked down in wonder.
“Yes! All right?” He snapped, raising his voice so the whole room could hear. “John Watson sucked a bunch of cocks, no, it wasn’t a hundred and fifty, and no, I’m not gay, vaginas are still lovely. Anymore questions?”
Sherlock slammed the door in her face. And then marched to the kitchen to slam the second door for good measure.
the idiot. Christ.”
“Possibly,” he allowed. “Know any of them?”
“Easy. Your mobile is in pieces on the corner, blood trail leading away from the starting trajectory, you dripped all the way onto the carriage. Unsanitary, Doctor.”
“Seriously, though. Do you see it now? How bloody desperate he is?”
“Did you really think you were going to get away with this?” He whispered, cigarette pack still clenched in his fist.
“Oh, I am.”
“Maybe,” Sherlock stopped and cleared his throat, tried again. “Perhaps just one glass. Would be a shame to waste such an expensive gift.”
John stared at his reflection in the mirror and wondered at himself. The outside hadn’t changed a bit. Bit pale maybe but, beside the alcohol consumption evident in his sallow complexion, one wouldn’t know John Watson had done the previously unheard of the night before.
Sherlock stomped his foot. "Before I knew I had a choice! You never said a word, in fact, you've done nothing but deny it since day one!"
Donovan noted when they started off and called out, “Oi, where you two off to?”
“You, an aggressive homophobe, wandering around the part of Soho notorious for its gay bars. Not a hard connection to make there. Sort of a cliché at this point, isn’t it?” He snorted, looking to see if John found the situation as funny as he did.
Sherlock reached into his jacket and pulled out what looked like several hundred note cards.
he’d latched onto the part where such an event could be used to his advantage because
"What?" He asks Sherlock when he turns back.
“You need to keep an eye on him at the very least. I’ve got business in New York to attend to this week, I can’t follow his every move.”
“Victor! Wait!” Sherlock cried out. John ducked further behind the pedestal when Victor stopped inches from his location. His heart pounded like mad as the man waited reluctantly for Sherlock to finish. “I’ll come with you, to your father’s estate. I won’t deduce a thing, I swear. I know you were worried, but-”
John smiled and they walked on.
“Didn’t want you to ruin your shirt,” John explained softly in the quiet of the room.
Right around the time John hit the last step and burst through the kitchen door, they had suddenly switched to what he guessed was Arabic.
“Go away,” he growled at the sun, drawing a pillow to shield his face.
Greg chuckled at that. “I mean, Christ, have you ever looked at him? He looks at you like you're the second coming. Has since day one."
Curls whipped as Sherlock turned quickly to bellow, “No! I’m furious you’ve wasted this much time!”
“I don’t know what I thought I was doing, coming here. You obviously haven’t forgiven me, not really.”
“Not in Greg’s car, you loon. Wait until we get home.”
He could still hear Charlie Tamwood, the gardener’s son, explain why no one would listen to six year old Sherlock’s deductions. He’d marched directly into his mother’s office and demanded to be called Sherlock from then on- never mind that there were no less than four English Kings, and a new prince, named William.
“You did say I helped.”
“Thought we were taking the tube?” He asked in what he hoped was a casual clip.
"Liar! You told me you liked him and thought about riding it out."
“Have you met Molly? She’s my lab partner in anatomy.”
“If by contemporary you mean the mid-seventies, then yeah.”
Molly had Mary and Sherlock both in her sights from her vantage point near the patio. By her count Sherlock was his fifth flute of champagne and John had only just finished his first. It was not working out, John was the one that needed to be convinced, the one who needed to get  more drunk.
John kisses his way back up to Sherlock’s lips. “What?” He asks between their lips meeting. He feels it then, there’s a wetness splashing down, mixing between their lips.
“I’m not licking the pancreas,” John slurred darkly.
“What?”
John barely suppresses the urge to roll his eyes, doing his best to follow behind without looking like a hedgehog rolling over a log. They both make it over the top of the wall as the first assailant makes it around the corner.
“I- I don’t know. I might have used them all in experiments.”
"Watch the sass too," Mary snapped with a point, "or you'll be next."
“You can. I never said it had to be correct, just read back what you remember.”
“You beautiful, brilliant bastard,” he said next and Sherlock sucked in a great lungful of air. His cock swelled, somehow even harder, and he tilted up, seeking friction.
“John, oh my-” Sherlock breathes deeply for an intense few seconds, “god, oh god,” he deep, rumbling voice cries out.
Sherlock snickered. “Note made. Marijuana turns John into a six year old.”
He waited until nearly noon before reluctantly dialing Mycroft.
“Good.” John nodded and then looked up in confusion. “Wait. What does your brother do?”
Her words echoed in his ear though. What
They ducked under the canvas flap and were immediately struck by the difference in décor from the plain outside of the tent. It was decadent, lush even, with large potted plants and draped velvet and silk. It was much warmer inside as well, with hot air from an electric heater in the corner blowing toward the tent flap. But the décor only arrested John’s attention for a moment.
He looked away from the ceiling to see Antoinette shuffle past Mrs. Hudson in the doorway, head down, shoulders high. His landlady gave him a disapproving glare but he just shrugged.
“Sorry, we can’t all be named John or Martha,” Sherlock spit, crossing his arms.
John snickered behind his wrist but looked away when Sherlock turned his scowl toward John.
John learns a few new things about Sherlock, some good, some bad, but finds regardless, he's in too deep to ever walk away.
John glanced away from the coffee table to catch Sherlock scowling at him. He scrunched his nose at that, as if
"Course I do. You didn't even need Sherlock and me to save you. Smart as a tack, hiding your mobile like you did." She waves John off with a chuckle. "You were much shorter then. What the hell has your mum been feeding you?" He teases.
recently promoted, thank you.”
“You’re an artist as well,” John announced, with what he hoped was a friendly smile toward Victor.
“Are you…" John stared at Bill in unrestrained bewilderment. "Are you mad because I
He rose to go but she grabbed his hand and stopped him.
Sherlock frowned. That nose scrunch that John adored appeared, signalling Sherlock’s confusion, meaning he’d not stop until John confessed to all. His heart gave a lurch but some part of John felt like it would loosen a knot that had formed in his stomach, one that had sat heavy ever since he’d lied at Angelo’s that first night. John felt secure in his standing with Sherlock now, he could confess all and not worry he’d be on the street with the next breath; that their friendship could withstand the confession.
“I’ll be fine in a minute. Please. Just… give me a minute.”
“Why are you the one manhandling? Why wouldn’t it be me shoving you around the flat?”
, take your queer shite and get it off the damn street,” the man repeated, fists mirroring John’s, clenching, ready.
"I think I'm actually being extremely sensitive and helpful, actually, and I'd like some credit, if you don't mind."
“Go away!” The reply came from his room.
The clear fondness on Sherlock’s face seemed to have the same effect on John and Mrs. Hudson both. She smiled down at him, placed a kiss in his curls, and  squeezed his shoulder.
Making tea is out of the question; he’ll only get sick again if he puts anything in his stomach. He decides to sit at the table anyway, just so he’s not pacing like a lunatic when Sherlock walks in.
“Do you wish to simply catch up on cell regeneration, or would you like ongoing lessons in how to retain information despite your learning disability?”
Even though the subject matter was in essence a boring, standard affair, the way Sherlock commanded the instrument, given his state, made John sit up and pay close attention. He nearly patted himself on the back for his quick thinking, daring Sherlock to play it correctly and not torture it, as was his usual M.O.
“I’m screaming into a pillow.”
prove it.”
“No. Get up,” he snarled aloud. “Get him back.”
Sherlock growled at him. "If you think I would ever just lie here like a rag doll while you-" He sucked in a surprised breath as John sank his teeth into the meat of his arse.  "Oh."
“I don’t think you are.”
“What is it, John? Should I be worried?” She spoke so softly, like a fragile bird in fear of being crushed.
"Mmm," he hummed vaguely. "Not much. Over heard one of the cooks say they had lady fingers in the van but turns out it's a type of pastry. Boring."
“How about Truth or Dare?”
Laila inhaled her wine the wrong way, and John had to pound on her back for a moment, until she coughed up the excess liquid.
They bowed their heads together and dinner was promptly forgotten.
"Sherlock is hardly himself today." Molly waved at the man in question. They turned to look at him, standing with one of Mary's bridesmaids.
“Where are you two off to?” Mrs. Hudson questioned from her doorway as they made for the front door.
"Find anything interesting?" She asked, mostly to pull his attention away from his own thoughts and into the present.
A splinter wedged further into John’s chest.
Without missing a beat John replied, “You seemed keen the night you begged me to suck you off.”
“How do you not have any bloody ice?” He called out when digging turned up no evidence of an ice tray.
“Obviously.” She tucked them back into her ears and grinned at him.  “Working like a charm so far.”
John couldn’t meet his eyes, so he glanced away, looking toward the banked fire. When his legs started to go numb from staying crouched for so long he moved up into the chair, still unable to look up from the fireplace.
“Than who the bloody hell is that?!” John exclaimed and pointed at the mystery woman.
Sherlock tries to look stern but his lips are too busy twitching. "Neither. Man's body found in Hyde Park, his leg caught in a bear trap. Nobody heard anything."
John, without hesitation, snatched Sherlock’s arm and slapped his hand against the bulge in his trousers, molding his fingers around its girth. Sherlock couldn’t remember being so thrilled, except perhaps the night John, with even less prompting, had swallowed his cock like Sallementro.
“Oi! Poofs! Take that shite inside, eh?”
“Seems like more of the same,” he answers with a shrug.  “Bit fanciful, but then, when aren’t you?”
The momentum of the car pulling away caused Sherlock to slide into John, who righted him with a steady hand to his shoulder.
He studied his quarry before proceeding. John had never made a study of the human penis, other than his own of course, but he had to admit, this one was quite something. Not quite as… impressive… as his own, but still…beautiful, actually.
“You don't like her either?" Greg guessed.
"You're hands are bigger," John mumbled absently into Sherlock's mouth, "you should be doing this."
Mary then.”
“You, in some ridiculous costume, seducing me in a dark pub somewhere.”
“I don’t believe you.”
“Ahh,” John breathed in stunned confusion. As quickly as he could, without being totally obvious, he gathered details about what he was seeing.
Sherlock growled at him in frustration. “Is it really so hard an idea to wrap your small brain around that somebody has the right to choose their sex despite the genitals assigned to them at birth? How did you feel growing up with people telling you to try steak and crab and bloody meat pies because they were good, you
“Tell me about the boyfriend,” he addressed the roommate, briefly looking away from the laptop.
He hadn’t gotten very far before he’d fallen to the floor in agony but he did remember the lamp had crashed to the floor with him and smashed quite nicely.
“Oh, for god’s sake, she’s in the toilets.” He waved toward the far end of the property.
"Oh, Christ," he called out when Sherlock started learning tricks. He'd applied John's head sensitivity when giving oral sex to their current activity and had risen up until his tightest muscles clamped John like a vise. He grinned like a fiend as John cursed him to perdition.
“What?” John groans warily.
It was so massive, in fact, that Sherlock felt as if he could feel every rigid vein pressed up against him, the flair of the corona, the pulse of his shaft - everything. They might as well not even be wearing trousers.
They looked at each other and shuffled nervously, none quite ready to vocalize what they were all thinking.
She nods. "But what about you? It's not too late-"
John’s eyebrows rose, and he turned, incredulously asking, “Excuse me?”
“-patently fabricated sex-hair. As if I wouldn’t have heard coitus going on practically above my head. This is absurd.”
“I thought we agreed not to go slowly," he growled. John grinned evilly, a fair warning to his frame of mind. “John, did we not just agree?”
Some sort of light ignites behind Sherlock’s eyes. He likes this idea, John can tell.
They quickly hopped out of the car and jogged over to where the other constables had gathered. Sherlock wedged himself in between two others and no one seemed to question his appearance. John hung back just behind as the constable in charge went over what had happened, where they believed his location to be. A police helicopter was already in the air, circling the area with its spotlight. John only just followed the train of the conversation, despite his best efforts, as his focus seemed to be on his conversation with Greg and the one before with Sherlock. Was he sexually repressed? Did it matter? It’s not like his and Sherlock’s sex life was going to suffer if he didn’t let Sherlock have his way with him up against the a filthy brick wall where anyone could happen by…But if it was something Sherlock wanted to do, something that turned him on, shouldn’t he at least try? Now that the cat was out of the bag, so to speak, he felt a little pressure in his chest ease up, like the fact that Greg knew made the idea of getting caught a little more palpable. Sherlock was right, he was repressed. He’d let plenty of his girlfriends talk him into fooling around in public before. Hell, he’d fingered Alisa, the last girl he’d slept with, on the tube the morning before they’d broken up. It was the thought of being caught with a bloke, the disgust he feared seeing in the eyes of anyone who might happen by, a fear that could be laid at the feet at Peter Browning’s father, that kept him from trying. Christ, Sherlock was bloody scary sometimes. But Greg’s words had lifted a fog, like he could take a deep breath and relax for the first time in weeks. He was in a relationship with the man he loved, who loved him back ferociously, and they were in a perfectly healthy sexual experimentation phase of the relationship, for Sherlock’s benefit he reminded himself. Not to say necking in public was acceptable, not to mention legal, but if that was something Sherlock wanted to try, he needn’t shy away at the idea in horror.  All he could hope was when the time came to inform Sherlock of his resolution he could actually go through with it.
Sherlock took the glass with hardly a second glance. His attention was on the kitchen staff, or seemed to be.
“All right.” John consented, bowing to Sherlock’s greater knowledge.
“You’re not really mad, are you? Cause I was at work. I mean, you knew I was at work. I’ve told you before about how Laila feels about phones out during open hours.”
“Let’s begin, shall we?” He leant forward and made a cancer cell for John to disassemble and recreate.
Mary set her napkin down with a snap and pointed. “There," she huffed, “Lestrade has him."
“Consulting detective, only one in the world. I invented the job.”
“John,” he started but stopped to move them down to the bench again, this time side by side, hands still clamped together. “Before you I was barely human and I didn’t care. After you, without you, I wasn’t human… and I did care. Very much.”
Greg snapped, "Enough you two. Christ, you're worse than children," and John nearly jumped out of his skin. He wrenched his hand away in shock and glared at his partner in silent retribution. Sherlock just smirked and cocked an eyebrow.
“Mmm,” Sherlock hummed, settling down further, willing to give it a shot. “Let’s see if it works.”
John frowned but handed it over.
"All right then. Keep the demands to a minimum." He rewarded Sherlock with a second finger, stretching the tight muscle as gently as he could.
. “Yes, technically. There is Mrs. Hudson, my jailer.”
Something had shifted in the silence, something John couldn’t see, because the next thing he heard, from startlingly near Sherlock’s seat, was Victor’s voice.
“C’mon, white boy, you can do better than that,” the big berk crooned.
“I suppose I thought they were implied.”
Back at the flat, John found Sherlock frozen at the kitchen table, eyes glued to his microscope with the rapt attention most men would give a striptease.
“God dammit! Sherlock! Agh!” John continued to swear and swing, hopping around the basement flat like a man on fire, until a lucky swing caught Sherlock in the stomach. He grunted, letting out a huff of air that inevitably turned into a laugh. By then he was unable to keep it in, nearly bent double, tears streaming down his face as John peeked curiously out from above the crook of his elbow. Once he caught sight of Sherlock’s hysterical laughter, noted the lack of killer bees, eyes taking in the paper, toothpick and empty crate, he quickly put it together. Despite knowing he was in trouble - John’s you’re-so-dead face making an appearance - Sherlock couldn’t stop laughing.
"No! Michael is great! That's his daughter there," she points to her friend, who waves when they look, "Bea. She's great too. Mum's gone back to school to be a nurse."
Oh, yes, that seemed simple enough, didn’t it?
“Sherlock,” John breathed, a hint of chastising. “Christ.”
John’s getting a kick out of this. Sherlock is clearly still not fully out of his own head yet, talking absently, still staring off into the kitchen.
“What?” Sherlock asked when John’s answer came directly out in a rush.
John hadn’t even thought to worry about Sherlock until the next morning, when he discovered Sherlock hadn’t come home at all. The flat was still empty, nothing in his room had been touched, no food or drink prepared (not that that was unusual). Perhaps he had caught back up with Victor and they were making up? The thought didn’t set right, for obvious reasons, but not just those. Victor had seemed adamant, justifiably angry at Sherlock, and though he could be quite persuasive, John didn’t think Sherlock would stoop to that after his plan had backfired. So where was he? If Sherlock was in any sort of danger, John would never forgive himself.
John gave a snort and a sort of friendly bump with his knee. “Just because I’m the short one doesn’t make me the side kick. Partners, remember? Fifty, fifty split. You can be the brains, I’ll be the muscle.”
When Sherlock started pushing him back down on the seat John couldn’t help but start laughing into his mouth. He backed up and looked down. At was dark but he could still make out the look of indignation his face.
“And you live alone?” He casually asked as his eyes darted to and fro.
“Wait, what?” He handed over her earrings when she reached for them. “Is that what you were doing?”
“If we even make it home.” He looked at his partner. “Did you forget that you killed a man?  And then I helped you desecrate his corpse?”
“You said murder,” John informed him, unnecessarily, once on the pavement.
“As I was saying,” he went on as they raced around the corner, “the architect used a flat Japanese style fence as opposed to-“
“Er,” John struggles to come up with something to say, which bit he should respond to first, and barely manages, “you’re on my bed.”
He gave a great sigh, dramatic, and, for the second time that week, spoke the dreaded, “See me after the lecture, John.”
“I have no proof,” Sherlock says but holds up a hand when Oliver looks to interrupt, “but I’m sure you can understand why she sought me out. She doesn’t exactly trust you, am I correct?”
“I don’t think you could get cold water if you tried,” Sherlock muses and then turns back to the loo to rinse his mouth.
“You were being coy? Really?” John didn’t sound convinced. In fact, he snorted derisively. “And I suppose the Wotsits and the John Grisham novels were your attempt to
“What was that?”
In surprise, John laughs again, a sharp, possibly insulting thing. He can’t help it. “Hotel California.”
“Hmm?”
Fury, both at Sherlock’s accusations and at his agreement that they’d wasted months of possible snogs and late night shags, had John clasping Sherlock’s wrists in his grasp, had him slamming them down onto the table and pinning them above Sherlock’s head as he crashed their lips together again. His tongue went exploring, welcomed warmly into Sherlock’s mouth; perhaps not expertly, but that hardly mattered to John. In fact, the evidence of Sherlock’s inexperience only seemed to fuel John’s lust. Proof that Sherlock wanted only John, it was a heady sensation.
“Damn, white boy,” Bernard breathlessly quipped, “respect.”
“Hmm, because I could praise both all night if you’d like. You’re simply too much, too bloody gorgeous, too bloody amazing, the things you see.” He licked up to Sherlock’s ear and whispered, “Part of me wants to force you onto your knees but another part thinks you might smite me for it.”
"Oh." Her hand went up to her lips but after she inspected Sherlock, calmly chatting with Janine, she tilted her head in confusion. "Well...why isn't he...hmm."
“Oh,” John chuckled despite himself. “You want me to rally some ex’s together to give testimony?” He shook his head and laughed again. “You’re ridiculous.”
John’s lips pursed. “Course, yeah.”
“Oh yes,” he quipped, “dull really. I assumed his place of employment wasn’t an accident. I believe if you look you’ll find several of the refinery’s employees are Russian immigrants. The position on the river makes for easy transportation of the ‘goods’, so to speak, and the shipping containers are excellent storage and hiding. Locating the suspect was merely knowing the best location for one to remain hidden from the shipping yard via the river access, coupled with the likelihood he would have access to a mobile for emergency extraction. Which container was determined by simply following the most used footpath from the back end of the shipping yard to the river. The hinges gave it away as well; too well oiled for one supposedly seldom used.   My only mistake was assuming there hadn’t been enough time to call for backup.” He looked at the accomplice, who was watching all through the back window of a squad car. “When he started shooting I made a snap decision and took out the first and least threatening member. His death was accidental.”
“Why else would a British detective turn up in America looking for the major player of a South American drug cartel? We have our own criminals, trust. I didn’t come here to topple your empire.”
Just the thought of John’s disappointment had Sherlock curling up on the floor near the tub. How would he continue to live like this? Aching, wanting, on the outside looking in…
(See the end of the chapter for
That remark earned Sherlock a bloody lip. His head snapped back, pain blooming bright, making the situation more real somehow.
Sherlock looked down at him, not in anger or sadness, but in contemplation. A niggle of worry skittered down his spine. His eyes perused John's frame until he couldn't take it anymore, he pushed past Sherlock and walked away. Or tried at least. He found his arm in Sherlock's grasp and pulled backwards until he was right back where he started.
All told, what should have been a supremely awkward situation hadn’t turned out that bad. Seemed he’d dodged another bullet today.
Sherlock hiccuped, frowned and then listed slightly to the left before answering. “Uneventful, I suppose.”
John blinked at that rapid subject change, but did his best not to visibly relax after avoiding the absolute fucking minefield that had been his conversation with Bill that morning.
John pulled off enough to mutter, “Wouldn’t want to keep the man from his business.” And then he went back to it, concentrating threefold on the tip to speed things along.
If the situation weren’t dire, Sherlock would never stoop so low, but desperate times and all that. He pulled his mobile and hit the speed dial.
“Yes,” Sherlock vehemently snaps, as if John should know better. John wants to ask if he was stung on the mouth, but he’s already explaining. “I was three, it was in Mummy’s wild flower garden - absurd thing, planting wild flowers and trying to tame them - but I loved it there, I spent hours there as a child. I was studying an Emperor Moth caterpillar-”
“In the sitting room, over a cup of tea.” Sherlock’s eyes glittered.
“I’m sorry,
“Just leave me enough, yeah?” He shouts when Sherlock stops whinging.
John comes back to the area where the body was hidden with the round of coffee he'd picked up from the cafe on the corner. He hands them out to Greg and Sally.
“You.” When Sherlock catches John’s blank stare he elaborates. “I’m not known for working with anyone, I assumed they would know that and dismiss you entirely. But when I took you with me, they likely assumed we were working together and searched your belongings. They would have found your British issue passport and connected the dots.”
“Wait.” Sherlock squinted. “Am
John started to ask, but another, more pressing question popped out. “What’s your name?”
“Are you- Did I-”
John chuckles. "No.
John scrunched his face up in frustration. “God damn you,” he growled. Sherlock gave him a ‘Well?’ look and John shoved him. “Go, before I sell
The sun was coming up by the time he finished, the traffic growing heavy with morning commuters, even on a Sunday. Sherlock put the last fanning touch to John’s eyelashes, wishing he’d thought to buy colored pencils or charcoals to highlight John’s gold and silver hair, before closing the pad and tossing it on the table.
“Because I was going to have you work a few of those musician’s fingers up my arse and then I was going to ride you until we were both bone dry.”
"I make no promises," Mary answered.
“What did you think?” He asks. A block of wood could have asked the same question with more feeling behind it.
, John mused. He could work with that.
“Oh, I’m going to enjoy this,” he muttered as he set his phone down to get dressed.
The rest of John’s what-if’s blended into a moan and he completely lost what was left of his mind, let alone his train of thought. The only thought left that survived the razing of his brain was, ‘Hell no, Sherlock Holmes does not get to be the one who seduces me.’ With that thought hanging on by a thread, he lunged, broken hand gripping Sherlock by his ridiculous coat collar to push him back, supine, onto the tube bench.
“Of course,” he agreed, though he really had no idea why John would assume so.
“I beg to differ,” Sherlock panted back, trying for stern and failing by a lot. He huffed at the ceiling, tried his very best to slow the heartbeat that had become his erection. “Just...give me a moment.”
Sherlock frowned as if the idea were absurd. John laughed along.
He glanced over to see Sherlock looking practically giddy compared to how he’d looked moment before. That might just be the weed kicking in though.
Even the sound of John frantically swishing with his mouth wash made Sherlock inordinately happy.
“All right,” John drawled, wary of unseen traps. “Any requests?”
"It's true!" Janine exclaimed. "They were in love."
“All right, imagine a scenario where you’ve done something I’ve specifically asked you not to and I’m so mad I use sex as a form of punishment. That’s the sort of sex they imagine we’re having.” The next was mumbled under his breath, “Why anyone in that office is concerned about what we’re doing in the privacy of our own flat, I have no idea.”
Sherlock blinked at John for a few seconds but then went back to his organ carving. “Your accent is atrocious.”
John studied Sherlock’s professional tutor mien, thinking of the grief he'd been giving these past few weeks, only to be offered civility now out of the blue.  “I’m not sure how I let you talk me into this,” he mumbled, unwilling to let Sherlock off the hook so easily.
“No more games, no more lies, no more manipulation. I’ll tell you everything.”
He receives an intelligible reply, muffled by his thick jumper.
“I’m his only friend, aren’t I?”
John rolls his head to glance over, surreptitiously watching the man’s thighs flex in the remaining light of the day.
Sherlock tossed the now lightly spotted alcohol pad in the cigarette bin and casually turned to listen, as if his heart wasn’t racing in terror. John could have been thinking about anything, but balance of probability stated it had to do with their previous conversation.
“What, oh?”
“I want to go home. I want John to finish rog-“
In a flash, he was up, his ankle still giving a token protest he easily ignored on his way down the hall. His laptop was located in the bedroom and, as he waited for it to load, he quickly donned his most impressive attire, a crisp black silk blend button down and his best bespoke slacks. He finished tying his most expensive John Lobb’s and rushed to log into John’s bank account, long since hacked.
He took a step forward to grab at Sherlock’s coat, but John was ready, throwing a wild left, catching the man directly in the chin, knocking him off guard. John quickly took advantage, putting him right up against the window of the building adjacent with a hand wrapped in his jacket.
“No, you don’t. You never have.” He lifted John’s chin with a finger, forcing him to meet his eyes. They were soft with affection, just as John was terrified they would be. “John Watson, making you jealous is very nearly one of my favourite things in the entire world. It ranks up on my list with ritualistic murder and tobacco ash.”
It seems to rouse Sherlock from his own musing, when he looks up and asks, “Do you really put that much thought into what my hair is doing while we’re running after criminals?”
He felt as if he’d been pulled from his own dimension into another one - a strange place without light, without heat, without reason. The place he occupied certainly didn’t play by the rules as Sherlock understood them.
“You said borrow. Do you intend to hand her a bag of lukewarm water when I’ve finished with it?”
her, in commiseration, but he didn’t think she’d appreciate the distinction.
“Army… things,” he answers, obviously a lie. John could roll over and die, he’s so embarrassed. So much for fooling the most observant man he’s ever met.
She studied him, looking for chinks in his armour. “They said you’d gone soft.”
I'm in the midst of a nervous breakdown over the last chapter tbh, so apologies if it takes a while to get to you fabulous people. I wanted it to be finished by now, but life and creative differences with the characters has gotten in the way lately. Sherlock seems to think it's okay to angst the shit out of this story and I'm doing my best to wrangle him... It's not going well. One thousand apologies, I'll have it to you as soon as I can.
“Certainly.”
Mary scowled. "Do not. I haven't killed anyone in months, I'm trying to savor it."
"Huh. Apparently that's the sound a sociopath makes when he cries," Greg informed her.
“How about you two?” Victor congenially asked, sipping his wine like a world class ponce.
“Oh, hello, John. Laila. Didn’t expect to see you here-”
“Oh yeah? And I’d like to take Jessica Alba out to dinner, but my dreams aren’t coming true anytime soon either.”
Sherlock blinked at him as if he'd been talking out of a second, much dumber head. "Is your self esteem really so bad you'd deny us both the pleasure simply to save yourself the imagined slight against you?"
It seemed counterintuitive. Granted, Sherlock’s understanding of sex was limited - practical application only having occurred in the last three months - but the term didn’t mesh with his understanding of coitus. He wasn’t a child; he knew the platitude “when two people loved each other very much…” was rubbish but honestly, what would make a person engage in sexual activity with someone they hated? There were plenty of people he hated. The postman, Anderson - less than before but still on a low simmer - several classmates from Uni; the thought of them in any sexual context nearly made him retch.
Sherlock took a breath, gathered his thoughts, and cautiously went on.
“Are you all right? You look sick.” He started walking further into the room but stopped when Sherlock backed up. He frowned even harder. “What is the matter with you?”
“Thank you,” Sherlock muttered when John passed him the mug with the STEM logo on it.
“Sherlock, you awake? I’ve got some tea and toast if you think you can hold it down.”
"The most intimate thing," he whispered, "and you don't want to with me."
Sally gives him a nod and takes her's away to the panda.
The mobster looks Sherlock up and down, skeptical. “What information?”
“Watson?” The nurse called out while John and Sherlock were busy talking over one another in their embarrassment. John glanced over in surprise, apparently having forgotten already where they were and why.
"It's not nothing, it's sexual repression. You shouldn't let it affect our relationship, John, it's unhealthy."
“Laila?” Bill’s voice questioned from his side of the room. It startled John, who hadn’t known his roommate was in residence.
“Yeah,” someone called out from near the billiards, “what are you doing tomorrow night?”
“I’m sorry, mate, but those are the rules. I can’t be liable for you dropping it on a fellow reveler.”
With a growl, John dove back down, ripping at the expensive shirt collar, laving at Sherlock’s collarbone with ferocious intent. Sherlock cried out, tilting his hips up at John, seeking and finding John just as hard and ready. They both keened at the contact, crashing together with ill-timed thrusts, like two first-time teenagers - randy and inexperienced. In Sherlock’s case that might be accurate but John had no excuse; nothing but his eagerness.
Bernard didn’t even turn, so Sherlock gripped him by the shoulder and forcibly turned him. He wasn’t the least bit fazed by the man’s height advantage, which compared with John’s lack thereof was nearly comical. Speaking of John, his face went from pleased to livid instantly.
Greg gave a two fingered salute and kept on walking.
John grunted at the noise but merely snuggled closer to the back of the sofa.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Really?” She seemed impressed, which might have been nice an hour ago, back when John was still on the pull. “Well why didn’t you say so? I’d like to see that actually.”
“It was obvious if you knew what you were looking for. I’m surprised you didn’t take his advice and keep quiet about what you discovered.”
“Hey, she’s
He shook his head and pouted as if he didn’t know what John was referring to.
“No,” Harry drawled. “Rami was the first official ‘I’m-kissing-a-boy’ kiss, but you kissed Jeremy Norway during Easter dinner at the Community Center when you were six. Remember? Mum started crying, ‘Oh, my son’s a poof’, and dad had to drag us all out to the car with everyone watching.”
But then he commands, “Shoot the tyres,” as they come to a stop.
“Amazing,” John breathed without thought.
“I don’t know,” she simpered.
Janine piped up from the corner. "Jim's lover too, don't forget that. Makes it all the more tragic."
“Hoo hoo,” Mrs. Hudson gave her customary greeting before knocking the door open with an elbow. She came bearing, of all things, a gift box of what looked like rather expensive scotch with accompanying crystal tumblers. “Ta da!” She exclaimed happily, holding out the gift.
John found himself flung aside as the bloke rolled from the bed. He yanked his hood over his head, pulled it snug, and then bolted past Mike to the party beyond.
.” Sherlock’s spine curved against his will, the leather under his grip nearly giving to the pressure from his nails, the curls against his forehead trembling with the exhalation of his gasps. John was speaking but Sherlock could have been under water as far as listening went - John's taunts taking second chair to a bloody great roar in his head.
“Hey, why don’t we lay the right way on the bed?” John suggested after a minute, and Sherlock nodded his agreement.
