“Someone else?” Castiel shifts against his seat. Maybe, there’s nothing going on here. Maybe, this really is just some place where people go to talk or screw or whatever, when they need something more than what they have. Maybe he shouldn’t be having this conversation. Maybe saying all this, is what he’s needed for so long. “We’ve both been with other—people. But we always find a way back to each other. Or I just always find my way back to him, I don’t know. But the things we do, I don’t know what they mean, if he knows what it means to me.”
“And who knows, maybe it will work out. Maybe you and me, we can go back to school, get normal jobs, pretend to be normal people, with a normal house, normal problems, something like that,” she laughs. “Whatever normal means for us, after all this.”
This close to Dean, Castiel knows that the strained control he once had, when he was an angel, the control he struggled for when Dean would lay beside him, when Dean would tell Castiel to touch him anywhere, everywhere, is gone.
“Does it really surprise you?” Castiel takes the bottle from Dean. He’s already had enough. Or, maybe, not enough, for what Castiel wants.
They could both die; both Dean and Jack, if I fuck this up. And then it would be just me, on an abandoned Earth. Chuck would get bored fast. Then I’d be dead too. And then Chuck could tear down this world and destroy it, and there would be nothing, no world for Eileen, to return to, even if I could bring her back.
Castiel looks down, away from Dean, but Dean forces his chin back up, and he bends, smashes Castiel’s mouth into his own. Standing in front of Castiel, Dean takes off his clothes, throws them down by Castiel’s feet, and, with the glow of the television dripping down his naked skin, he puts his head into his hands, tells Castiel to touch him, in any way, anywhere, he wants.
A security guard slumped in a chair, staring at his phone, believes whatever Crowley tells him. That he’s the CFO of some other bank, some other person who matters to Ethan Burke. That Sam is his assistant, or something. That he’s here to see some senior vice president.
“Cas, please,” Dean says. “Just do whatever you want to me. Just use me, one last time, before you let me down.”
The only light in the South Dakota night flickers from Bobby’s porch. In the darkness, Dean pulls at the buttons of Castiel’s shirt, pulls Castiel down into dying patches of grass and scattered, broken nails and screws. And he knows that Castiel could turn him to dust, that Castiel could end him, right here, right now, but that Castiel wants this, that Castiel is just as fucked up as he is.
“Yes. All of it. Even the corpse on her living room floor,” Castiel stops his eyes from meeting Dean’s. “Dr. something.”
“I’m fine.” Castiel clenches around the red-stained tissue in his hand, just above the swollen flesh from Ephraim’s grasp that scars Castiel, sends twinges of pain through him.
“That’s why we can’t let him keep going,” Sam says. “Because eventually we’ll never be able to stop him.” He lets his neck sink back into the throw pillows, he tries to drown out the sound of everything around him. He tries to swallow the feeling, in his mouth, in his brain, the feeling of need, of hunger for something he knows he should reject.
Castiel tries to ignore Lisa, moaning, whispering something about much she loves fucking Dean, something about how much she loves Dean. With his free hand, Castiel reaches up into his hair, pulling at his scalp, forcing his own hips against the curled-up fingers that he wants, needs, to be any part of Dean, as he soaks his pants, the bottom of his shirt, everything.
Dean steps back, watches Castiel as he complies. Castiel presses his body against Dean’s, until every part of him is touching every part of Dean. He runs his fingers up the side of Dean’s stomach, up to his ribs, up his chest, and into Dean’s mouth, holding Dean’s lips apart as he kisses him.
There are a hundred or a thousand or maybe a million different things I could have said, things I could have done. I could have told him that I’ve been his since the moment he gripped me tight and raised me from perdition, or whatever. That anything he wanted, he could have had. I could have held his body against mine, tried to pull him away from oblivion. I could have tried to fight the Empty and Death all at once.
“I don’t know. Nothing. I don’t need anything, Cas.” Dean’s fingers tangle with Castiel’s push his hand back onto the bed. “Just this.”
He sits up, puts his hands around my neck, and brings me back down onto the table next to him, our legs twisted around each other. And I need him to tell me everything is okay, and instead he just kisses me, his tongue wandering along the roof of my mouth.
“What else can I do?” Sam leans back against the wall. “It was supposed to be Jack, Jack was supposed to beat God. But you ruined it, Dean. You, you always ruin everything. From the night you showed up in my apartment, all those years ago, I never should have left Jess, I never should have gone with you.”
“What’s wrong with you?” Dean pushes Castiel back by his shoulders. “You disappear, we—I was worried. I was freaking out, because I didn’t know what happened, if you were alive. And you come back here, and tell me, you couldn’t—didn’t want to—respond to all the messages I left you. And you come back here and tell me you wanted to bring me a win—”
“I can’t,” Dean slips away from him to the other side of the room, sinking down into the bed. “Just fix me. Just make it all go away. Do something, Cas. This happened because of you.”
“Tell me you’ll stop asking me to stop, tell me you’ll trust me,” Castiel says, as Dean’s hand falls into his.
“It was just, nothing. It was cold and dark. Lonely, I guess,” she says, watching a group of teenagers ride by on bicycles. “Mostly I was afraid I wouldn’t see you again. But I think I always knew that you would save everyone.”
“I already fixed him. A long time ago. I guess now you can call this…unfixing?” Chuck says, pushing Castiel backward, enough to slip away from him.
“You said he was here.” Sam watches women, men, parking cars in the lot around them. Women, men, dressed in business-casual Hell, texting, carrying brown paper bags of whatever they could find in their refrigerators that might pass for an at-their-desk-while-working lunch. They walk with a slow-dread, in the morning sun that’s reflecting off the mirrors of glass that cover the building.
But tonight, it’s Satan, the Devil, Lucifer, whatever he wants to be called, who visits Sam. Who walks with him down this Mercedes Benz-and-oak tree lined street. Satan, who whispers, “You need me. We’re the same. You and me, it’s destiny, someday, you’ll be my vessel again.”
Castiel’s fingers move down Dean’s forehead, his cheek, and they spread Dean’s lips apart as a trail of light hangs in the air between them. Dean’s teeth and tongue are against Castiel’s fingertips and Dean slides his body back up, so that his face is against Castiel’s. Castiel heals himself with one hand, lets his other hand move away from Dean’s mouth, down Dean’s chin as Dean turns his head into Castiel’s touch.
But he’s here, in the middle of some too-rich suburb, and he’s half-high out of his mind on demon blood again, and, when he’s like this, it’s not Dean or Eileen who speak to him.
I fucked up. Because that’s what I do. It was my idea to come back here, to find Billie. It’s my fault Cas is gone.
And he’s finally all mine. Not Michael’s, not Alastair’s, not Amara’s, not Lisa’s. But maybe, really, he’s always been all mine. He tries to say something, but it’s unintelligible, his mouth still gagged, and I take his hands and hold him down. He’s tight and warm, and his legs are spread out underneath me. I run my tongue along the back of his neck, down to his spine, bringing myself up onto my knees as I move deeper within him.
I can feel myself getting faint, and I push him away, slide to the other side of the bed, and he just lays there, covered in blood, his chin, his neck, his chest. He moves his head backward and blood trickles up his upper lip and onto his nose.
Out here, miles away from streetlights and headlights, there are hundreds, thousands of stars scattered across the darkness. And Dean wonders, if somewhere beyond the constellations, if Castiel is in Heaven. Or if he’s in Hell, for always choosing the Winchesters over Heaven and over everything, for knowing Dean in ways angels were never supposed to know humans. Or if he’s somewhere else, somewhere even worse.
He rips out the pages, the Woman in White, the Wendigo, the exorcisms, and drops them into the flames, then he hands the book to Sam.
In the dark, there’s the sound of footsteps on the floor above them. The sound of someone moaning on the other side of the wall. And he tries to hear the angels, but there’s still only Dean, breathing, mumbling in his sleep. Dean, shifting in the bed, until the nape of his neck is against Castiel’s mouth. Dean, sleeping, shoving himself backward into Castiel’s hips.
Castiel tightens his grip, because Dean’s soul is his to raise from the dead, and he knows, deep inside himself, he’s doing this because he wants to.
“He could be anywhere by now.” Crowley looks back at the television. “And every time, every vessel, is just going to be someone bigger, someone more powerful.”
“I hope that’s a promise,” Crowley runs his fingers through Castiel’s hair, pulling Castiel’s head closer to him.
“No, I’m sorry.” She pulls the zipper on her bag closed, shoves it beside her. “I just—I have a kid at home and I need the money.”
“Not exactly - I’m just turning Sam into what he was always supposed to be,” Chuck rises from the floor. “And the rest of you, well, I’ve had enough. Your stories need to end.”
He holds the journal, John Winchester’s Journal, over the fire. His father’s directions, to him, to Sam, to pick up where he left off, the family business.
Jack nods, “I think I’m happy, for the first time, maybe ever. There isn’t this burden, hanging over me. Actually, there were so many burdens…killing God, your deal with the Empty….and now, all of that is over. But I’m also really scared, Cas. I don’t know how to be a three-year-old in the body of a twenty-year-old or whatever. What do I do, Cas? I don’t know how to be human, not really.”
“I don’t know, I don’t know anything. I don’t know what I did.” I roll my head along the Earth. “I’m sorry. I made a deal. The Empty told me Cas was becoming human. It wanted Jack’s grace, to let him go. I agreed. So I think Jack…I think Jack is human too.”
Castiel tells himself that this is no longer blasphemy, treason. And Dean can feel Castiel’s fingers inside of him, can feel Castiel spreading him open, can feel Castiel splitting him apart, filling him completely.
“Me too.” Castiel smiles, and Jack realizes it’s maybe the first time he’d seen him look anything but miserable, since he’d come back, from the Empty, since Dean had saved him.
“I like this world,” I sit up straight in my chair. “And I don’t want to destroy it, and I don’t want you to destroy it. I just want you to bring everyone back.”
“I don’t need an apology.” Dean pulls himself onto his back, and he runs his tongue from Castiel’s ear to Castiel’s throat to Castiel’s mouth. And, from against Castiel’s lips, Dean watches Castiel’s chest, as it moves up and down, as his breath strains to recover.
Castiel slides further from him, and Dean arches his neck back to look at him, just enough so that Castiel can see the dark circles under his eyes, the way his cheeks are drained and sallow. He parts his lips, and starts to say something, but drinks his beer instead. He wipes his mouth with the back of his hand, and slides his palm behind his head, and his fingers rest maybe an inch away from Castiel’s.
He stands only a few feet in front of me, arms stretched to his sides, the cuts on his palms healing, the bruises on his face fading. He reaches out and grabs my wrist, and he tells me that, if he can’t do this, if he can’t bring Cas back, he’s never coming back. If he can’t do this, he just wants to rot in the Empty, rot forever with Castiel. “No deals, no resurrection, promise me.”
I can never go back there, that place, where I slept for so long, where I dreamed of nothing but every regret I’ve ever had, every mistake I’ve ever made. Most of the time, I dreamed of him, of what I’d turned him into, of manipulating him into causing the Apocalypse, causing Lucifer to rise. Until Jack, or whatever his name is, woke everything up, made it loud, and every dead angel and every dead demon was wide awake, wide awake to relive their greatest miseries.
And Dean waits, for Castiel to say something, to say something that no one’s ever really meant when they’ve said it to him, but he just wraps his arm around Dean, pulls Dean against him, and succumbs to exhaustion.
“This doesn’t mean we’re okay,” Dean pulls at Castiel’s pants, until he can feel the bare skin of Castiel’s thighs against his own.
But Dean kisses him, runs his tongue along his chin and neck and throat, loosens his tie, unbuttons his shirt, presses their bodies together like they’ve done so many times before. Dean tells himself that, maybe, he shouldn’t care that Castiel is going to betray him. Because, maybe, Castiel is just like everyone else, who has used him, who has deceived him, who has left him.
“No, I never thought I’d survive this. And, honestly, I thought—if I did survive—something else would get me eventually. My bet was always on a vamp,” Dean stands up from the floor, leaning against the car.
“And what happens when you and Eileen figure it out, and you will, because you always do, and I’m still here, in this fucking bunker? What happens six months, a year from now, when you’ve been able to move on, and I’m sitting in this same spot, because all I know how to be is a hunter?” Dean kicks aside a wrench that’s lying by his foot.
And I wonder if I’ll ever be forgiven for this, like I’ve been forgiven for every other sin I’ve committed, brought back from death and nothingness. But this is different, and this definitely isn’t part of God’s story.
This is easy when Sam is around. When Sam is asleep in the passenger seat, and Dean can let his eyes drift up to the rear-view mirror, until his eyes meet Castiel’s in the back-seat reflection, in silent recognition of whatever they had just done in some motel bathroom. In quiet anticipation of what they would do, what they could do, hidden away in some of corner of wherever it was they were going. This is easy, when the only time they can spend alone is spent with their mouths and hands all over one another.
“Are you speaking from experience?” Castiel picks up one of the empty cans beside him. It’s crushed, twisted, tiny sharp holes breaking away the aluminum.
The headlights of a car driving down the street shine in through the window, over and across Dean’s face. “I can’t believe you struck out with a hooker.”
Sam turns his eyes to neighboring houses, distant across the property, their windows shining with the lights of televisions, computers, life. And, even with the demon blood rattling around in his brain and his body, the quiet of this world, broken only by the sound of car doors and passing airplanes, is something that Sam has wished for, so many times.
This isn’t what I wanted, all I wanted was to get the fuck out of the Empty, go back to Hell. I don’t care about God, or Chuck, or whatever I’m supposed to call him. I don’t care about this world, I don’t really care about anything, except maybe I care, more than I want to, more than I should, about Sam.
“I don’t know,” Castiel says. “To feel something other than empty. I rebelled, and God is—who knows where God is—and I want to feel something other than failure.”
Castiel lifts his head off the table. He had forgotten how it was, to need sleep, to need food. “Thanks.”
And Sam has almost told Dean, so many times, that he’s not okay, that he’s never been okay, not since they’d stopped the Apocalypse the first time, not since Castiel had dragged him from the cage, not since his soul had spent Hell-decades enduring everything Lucifer had to give. But he can’t, and he won’t, burden Dean with this because Dean doesn’t deserve it, and Dean has done enough. Because Dean raised him, and he didn’t raise him to be this.
“But maybe all that matters is that he came back. And maybe you don’t need a definition for him.” She glances down at her phone and stands up. “I have to go, my Mom’s with my kid. I told her I took the late shift at the hospital tonight. But cleaning bedpans and bloodstains doesn’t really pay the mortgage anymore. If you change your mind, and you need something, I’m here a couple of times a week.”
“Free will, maybe.” Dean mumbles, into Castiel’s chin. Dean kisses him again, running his hands up Castiel’s back, underneath his shirt. Castiel tries to hesitate, because he doesn’t know what he’s doing, not really, but he gives in anyway, lets Dean press his hips tightly into his own, lets Dean slide on top of him. He can still taste the beer in Dean’s mouth, and the fading scent of death that had permeated the Empty lingers on both their bodies.
So I lie on his bed, staring up at the ceiling, listening to the sound of his mouth against my flesh, the sound of a bedroom door slamming shut somewhere down the hall, the memories of the sounds of the Empty, the screaming, that’s been echoing in my head all day long.
“New York is like a day’s drive away, are you sure you want us gone that long?” Dean stands from the table, tightening the tie of his robe around him. A day. A day alone in the car with Castiel. A day to spend in awkward silence, a day to spend trying not to start a conversation about what they are, to each other, after years of this. A day for Dean to convince himself that Castiel feels the same way he does. A day for Castiel to tell Dean that he could never feel the same.
He stumbles through the hall and into the Bunker’s dungeon, shutting the door behind him, closing his eyes and pressing his head into the wall. He can see Eileen, lost, alone, in some other dimension, asking him to bring her back, before it’s too late, before she’s gone forever. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry, Eileen. I’m sorry, I don’t know what to do. Tell me what to do.”
In an empty field, somewhere maybe 10 miles outside of Lebanon, Kansas, I watch my brother lose his mind. My brother who raised me, who survived the abuse and torment of our father, for me. My brother, who stole for me, who would give up anything, who would give up his life, for me.
“Except you won’t stop whatever the fuck it is you’re doing.” Dean’s voice is damning, accusatory, but his hand finds Castiel’s on the bed, and his fingers run along Castiel’s, down Castiel’s palm, to Castiel’s wrist.
Castiel reads their text messages, the mundane ones from long ago, Lisa asking Dean to pick up size 2 diapers for the niece she was babysitting, asking Dean what he was making for dinner. The frantic ones, Lisa asking Dean if he was okay, asking Dean to respond as soon as some hunt was over. The ones where Lisa told Dean that she couldn’t expose Ben to this, Dean’s life, anymore. The ones where Dean tried to tell her he was sorry, for everything. The middle-of-the-night ones with shadowy pictures taken in mirrors, of body parts and skin, the ones with detailed descriptions of what Lisa would do to Dean, for Dean, when they were together again. The ones where Dean responded to her in ways, with words, identical to the ways and words Dean had once responded to Castiel. Identical to words Dean had once mumbled into Castiel’s mouth.
On this road, Castiel’s orders are clear. The righteous man must be stopped, before he gives in, before he spills blood in Hell. The first seal can never be broken. The Apocalypse can never be unleashed. Because God commanded this. God commanded that Castiel save Dean Winchester.
“I don’t know. I don’t know what to call him.” Dean says, because it doesn’t matter, here, with this woman who just wants to get him high and keep his secrets. “But I think he’ll never really understand, because even after—after we went through Hell together—he left me, alone, and I don’t think he came back because he wanted to.”
So I undo the button on her jeans with the tip of my knife, pull the zipper down slowly. She says something about thinking about me, while she was in the Empty, something about how she missed this.
And I tell myself, that I deserve to be here, because saving Dean and saving Jack, was so much more important than me. But here, in the middle of nothing, all of the things I wanted and all the things I couldn’t have, have been taken from me for eternity.
Instead, Castiel slides his hand down into his pants, letting the zipper fall open against his knuckles. And he wraps his hand around himself, still focused on Dean, and he pumps his wrist, slowly at first, and then at the same pace that Dean’s body moves against Lisa’s. He tightens his fingers, until it almost hurts, pretends he’s inside Dean, pretends that it’s his mouth moving down Dean’s neck.
“Fuck you, Cas. Fuck you for letting me leave you. Fuck you for leaving me. Fuck you for all of it,” Dean says, tilting Castiel’s chin towards his.
“Cas had me drain almost all of his grace….and he went there, right? And then I brought him back. So kill me. Well, I guess, almost kill me, if you can, but if you have to just kill me….that would be okay.” Jack looks over at Dean, who is silent now, his bleeding hands covering his face. “It’s my fault Cas is in the Empty. The Empty wanted me. Kill me. It will take me. I’ll bring him back.”
“I know. I’m not saying I’m going to let you kill me all the way,” I lean forward on the bed, until my mouth almost touches his. “But I’d let you take me right to the edge……and then bring me back.”
And now Sam is already 700 miles away and there’s nothing on the radio but static. “So, I guess it’s been years, since we did this, just you and me,” Dean says, under the shadow of a highway overpass. “Gone on a case together, I mean.”
I can almost hear Sam, begging, frantic for something to happen, but the next sound is deafening—of the rift between the Earth of the Empty, breaking open. There’s nothing but black, black sludge everywhere, in my eyes, in my mouth, dripping down my throat. It fills my lungs until I can barely breathe, until I open my eyes, back in my body, face down in the wet grass.
“This is really what you want to do, you and Dean?” Eileen shifts into park, the headlights of the Plymouth Valiant shining onto the crossroads in the fading sunlight.
And Dean remembers, what the angel, the drunk one he’d first met outside Pirate Pete’s Jolly Treats and last met in the North Cove Sheriff’s Office, said. “Castiel’s dead. All the way dead. Because of you.”
“You say that, Sam, but look at you. Did you think you’d still be doing this, so many years after you started? After your brother thinks you’re cured?” And Sam knows, none of this is real, that Lucifer isn’t really trailing behind him as he turns the corner. That none of this is real, but he’s afraid it will be his reality. “You know I’m right, Sam.”
Jack is hovering in the doorway. I can’t tell Sam, but every part of me wishes Jack would just vaporize, just like everyone else, forever. Because Cas’ deal, it was all about saving him. Because without Jack, Mom would still be here. Cas would still be here. Fuck
She spins his chair around until he’s facing her, and she kisses him, letting her hands fall to the collar of his shirt while she unbuttons it. She lets her own suit jacket fall to the floor as she sits down in his lap. She pulls up her own skirt, sliding her hips onto his. “You told Karen, right? That you want to be with me?”
Castiel pulls himself away from Dean, the dim white light from the soda machine casting shadows across his face. He can feel Dean’s anger, Dean’s rage, he can feel the things he felt every day, every time Dean prayed to him in Purgatory. He can feel Dean’s longing, longing for something Castiel doesn’t believe Dean could ever really want.
Once, Chuck cured me of the demon blood addiction, and of all the yellow-eyed-demon-child abilities. But now, I think he’s letting me relapse.
“Like maybe I’m almost ready,” he says. “This is different than last time. It took so long for me just to be able to pull demons, but now…I think, soon…”
This moment is usually when Dean wonders if he’ll make it out of this alive. If the hands running over his stomach, between his legs, are the hands of a monster, are the hands that will end him forever. This is the moment where Dean usually realizes that these are the hands of someone who he’ll never see again, someone he means nothing to. Someone who wouldn’t care if he dropped dead tomorrow.
“No. I want you right now, more than I’ve ever wanted anything ever.” Castiel’s mouth drops from Dean’s to his chin, to his chest, to his stomach, until Castiel’s knees are against the floor, until Castiel is pushing Dean’s jeans down to his ankles. He buries his face in Dean’s thighs, against the nearly sheer floral pattern that spreads across Dean’s hips. He’s still connected to Dean by the chain that Dean yanks on to make Castiel fall even closer against him.
“You don’t even know the things I’ve done, Dean, since the last time we had—the last time we did something like this.” Castiel tries not to focus on the way Dean’s moves his hand across his own body, down his stomach. “I don’t deserve to touch you, Dean. I don’t deserve anything.”
Castiel finds Dean in Bobby Singer’s guest room. The walls are gray and bare, and there’s nothing on the bed except a white pillow and a red plaid blanket that’s tangled around Dean’s feet. Dean drops a nearly-half-empty bottle of something onto the floor, and a puddle of amber-colored liquid streams from its glass mouth.
“There’s another way, there has to be, and we’ll figure it out, okay?” Dean tilts the bottle into his mouth.
“What if we don’t?” Castiel leans forward, places his hand over Dean’s, lets his fingers fall through Dean’s.
So he walks and walks for what might be minutes or what might be hours. He walks through overgrown grass, through twisted weeds, patches of yellow dandelions. He walks over broken branches, an empty gas container, and shattered glass.
Guilt, humiliation, wash over Dean, burn through him when he finally comes, on Castiel, on himself. He reaches for Castiel’s mouth with his own, but Castiel doesn’t respond, tilts his face away from Dean’s.
I pull his t-shirt over his head, dropping it down by our feet. His jeans are tangled around his ankles, and he looks away from me, up at the ceiling. “I can stop,” I tell him.
“I think, because it is,” Dean takes the box from him, glancing back at Jack, snoring in the backseat.
“So this is it?” Dean is still counting Sam’s heart beats, still wondering if this is all Chuck, still wondering if Chuck will be back to murder them all. “Cas is just human, and Sam and me—we’re normal? Hunters with nothing to hunt?”
Dean doesn’t believe, anything that Castiel is saying right now, doesn’t believe that he’s going to call off whatever insane plan he has to stop Lucifer’s child from entering this world. But he pushes Castiel up against the counter, lets his leg push itself up in between Castiel’s legs. “You’re lying, I know you’re lying. But before you do whatever you’re going to do, before you walk out of here again, I need you, because maybe this will be the last time I can have you.”
Dean pulls himself off the ground, grabs a handful of tissues and cleans the sweat and cum and   whatever off his stomach before he lays down on the bed. And, leaning back against his pillow, he looks down at Castiel, still spread out on the floor and says, “Stay here, stay with me. Don’t go back to your room, or go do whatever the fuck you do all night, okay? Just pretend to sleep here, with me.”
And this is Sam’s chance, to take on the Devil. To finally make Lucifer pay for all the things he had done to him in the cage. And he needs to do this alone, without dragging Dean into this fight, without Dean trying to sacrifice himself for Sam, for anyone. Dean, maybe, could have a normal life someday. Dean, maybe, could escape all this.
Castiel knows, this is all his fault. And he knows, that he should, but he can’t, leave Dean here like this, hurt, confused, reckless. He could heal Dean’s body, but it won’t stop him, from lying here, drinking himself half to death, it wouldn’t stop him from blaming, hating Castiel.
“No,” Dean says, because lying out here, in the dirt, against Castiel, is better than waking up from a million nightmares about Jo and Ellen, about the Apocalypse, better than waking up alone on Bobby Singer’s couch. “No. Just let me sleep.”
Castiel presses his head against the back of his seat, watches Dean’s fingers, turning the key in the ignition, scanning through radio stations, adjusting the volume.
“Do it Dean, and I’ll bring back Eileen, and Donna, and Jody, and Claire, and everybody else.  And if you don’t, all I need to do is snap my fingers – and they’ll be gone forever,” Chuck looks up toward the sky. It’s snowing harder now, and the wind rattles and howls through the trees behind them. Like the world is screaming, fading around them.
Sam had left Ruby, bleeding and maybe barely alive, on his bed. He can still hear her, from his room, a strained voice, telling him not to, that this is all God, God trying to save himself. But all Sam wants, right now, is to fix this the way Chuck wants—to erase Castiel from this story, to give Chuck the Cain and Abel fantasy that he’s wanted all along.
Dean Winchester’s face is pressed against the floor of his bedroom. It’s cold, there’s a pile of dirty jeans and underwear, an empty bottle of whiskey, and a crumbled pink tube of whatever sex-lubricant he found buried in the back of the drawer of his nightstand. The tips of his fingers scrape against the tiles as he tries to shield the top of his head from slamming into the dresser.
“I get it,” Dean says. Because he knows, maybe better than anyone, that sometimes, it’s easier to let what you want to say, what you need to say, go unspoken. Because the consequences of saying it might be worse than the burden of keeping silent.
Castiel turns his face up to the sky, up to the iridescent pillars of the Northern Lights, as he lets Dr. Matthew J. Taylor sink beneath the icy waters, as he lets the tattered remains of Dean’s life with Lisa float away. And Castiel prays, to anyone, to no one, to the green and blue and pink streams of color that dance across the stars, that he’s doing the right thing. Working with Crowley. Looking for Purgatory. Erasing every remnant of Dean from Lisa’s brain. Because that’s what Dean wanted. Because maybe that’s what Castiel wanted too.
Everything Castiel feels right now, the way he can barely breathe, the way he watches Dean’s chest move up and down, the confusion about what to do next, is human. He could leave right now, he’d have the entire world to himself, until Chuck finds him. He could take Dean’s hand into his, pull him up onto the bed, maybe ask to do things to him that he’d never even thought about doing to anyone.
Castiel presses his head against the tiled wall of the shower. He’s been in here maybe an hour, maybe longer. He’s hiding, from Sam, from Jack, but mostly from Dean. He hasn’t seen Dean since he’d left his bed early this morning. Castiel knows whatever happened last night was probably a mistake, and that whatever Dean said, he probably didn’t mean it, or at least didn’t mean it in the way Castiel wanted.
I throw the books onto the ground. I’m dizzy, exhausted, confused. I lean back, my mouth wrapped around the tip of the bottle. I drink until I think I’m almost dead, because maybe I deserve to be.
“Why didn’t you take that deal? Why would you choose me over your mother?” Castiel tilts his head in the fluorescent light of the kitchen.
“What are you?” Dean holds the knife at Castiel’s chest. “Are you a demon? Are you with Alastair? What are you going to do to me? Alastair and I, we had a deal. No more torture if I did this, if I became this.”
“You don’t need to take care of me, Dean,” Castiel says, leaning his head into the passenger side window.
“Of course. I want you. I only want you.” He tries to reach her mouth, he tries to kiss her all over again but she pulls back.
Dean shoves Castiel’s fingers off the sleeve of his jacket. “No. You didn’t. I spent a year, looking for you in Purgatory. Praying to you. I was going to save us both. And you—you decide you need to stay there. You decide you deserve to be there. You decide to let me think that I fucked up again, that I failed you. And all you can say is sorry, all you can do is tell me I can’t save everyone.”
Castiel holds the journal between his fingers and tears out pages covered in symbols and phone numbers, “This is for Heaven, and all the angels who were lost in every fall, in every apocalypse.” He passes it to Eileen.
Dean is still yanking at Castiel’s collar, and Castiel’s fingers are embedded in Dean’s arms, and Castiel pretends that, in whatever far away corner of Heaven or Hell that’s watching them, it looks like he tried to resist Dean Winchester, before he finds Dean’s mouth again, with his own. Before Castiel, half graceless and half drunk, lets Dean drop down in front of him, fingers dangling off Castiel’s as he tilts his head back. “Last night on Earth, right?”
Castiel turns his eyes up to Heaven. The clouds are moving over, low in the haze of the purple almost-midnight sky, and the first drops of rain fall down his throat. Before he rebelled, before he fell, he could hear the angels, he could hear Heaven’s constant mindless chatter. But now there’s nothing, except for a rumble of thunder miles away. He reaches down, to where Dean’s hand is resting on his stomach, and he slips his fingers between Dean’s.
“It can be arranged.” I’ve been reading the same spell book over and over, and I don’t know why, because there’s no spell to kill God. We had everything we needed, we had Jack, and now we have nothing. Because Dean decided it would be okay to sacrifice everything. He spent an hour tonight, telling me over and over that I would have done the same, for Eileen, and I spent an hour telling him that he was wrong, even though I know he’s not.
Castiel turns his eyes from the red brake lights of the Nissan Altima in front of them to Dean. “Why did you want to run from your father?”
He doesn’t respond. He kisses me while trying to slip away from me all at the same time, trying to deny what I want while he fumbles around with the button of his jeans. I can feel him, breathing into my mouth, and I can’t think of anything other than the way his fingertips are running along the top of my pants. I let him believe that he has some kind of control over me, even though I could make him do whatever I want, overpower him, use him, like all the other angels would.
“I wanted you to hurt me,” Castiel moves his fingers onto Dean’s shoulders, pushing him backward into the mud.
“Yeah, take him. Like I said, I need to keep trying—trying to find Lucifer. Or more innocent people are going to die.” Sam pulls his laptop back in front of him. “I’m sure Cas won’t mind.”
If Dean could put this into words, if Dean even begin to describe how this feels, he would say that Castiel’s grace makes his mind close to blank, makes him forget about the demons and the monsters, makes him forget about his dead kid who’s probably lost in Purgatory. It makes him feel complete. Castiel makes him feel complete. Castiel is maybe what he was missing, all the years he felt alone and lost, all the nights he thought about running away to nowhere.
Sam shoves me backward, back into the dirt, pulls at his hair. “We need to take out Chuck, we need to bring everyone back. Eileen. Donna. Charlie. We need them all back. And we aren’t going to do that with demon blood, we aren’t going to do this, we’re all dead. He’s going to kill us, all of us.”
And I can feel the Empty, pulling Jack’s grace from inside me, and I can feel myself, getting weaker, but I reach down, into the rift, and I pull Cas’ almost-dead-almost-human body from it. The black goop spits out Ruby, and it spits out Jack, and it makes its way up Sam’s legs, up his stomach. He’s still holding the glowing vial, with the rest of Jack’s grace, and I tell him to let go, to give the Empty what it wants.
I lift my body off hers and wipe the blood dripping down my chin with the back of my hand. Her hair is scattered across my pillow, and her legs are wrapped around me. I close my eyes, think of Eileen, somewhere, in some other world, but I can feel my control slipping away. I haven’t felt like this in so long, and the feeling of finally letting go after everything, after saving everyone and everything, so many damn times, this is what I deserve.
“Come on, Cas.” The stubble on Dean’s face brushes against Castiel’s throat. “I can’t talk about this. Not now.”
Dean can’t look at her. He had been ready to sacrifice her, to let Jack slaughter her. And then he had begged for her when he had nothing else, no hope.
The man in the torn sleeping bag coughs, raises his head from hands and slumps back down onto the sidewalk. Dean recognizes the look of exhaustion, of hunger, of hopelessness, because it’s a look Dean knows that he’s had a million times. Outside grocery stores at ten-years old, hoping that someone would pity him enough to donate something from their overflowing shopping cart, something that would be enough to feed Sam, and maybe himself. Because their father never left them with enough cash, when he was gone for days, for a week, on a hunt.
“You can do this, Sammy. You always do,” Dean says, and he knows the words coming out of his mouth are nothing but lies.
Castiel knows Dean knows the answer to his own question. He reaches into his coat and pulls out his angel blade, presses the handle into Dean’s palm. “Tonight may be the last time you can do this.”
The light from his phone makes him squint in the darkness as he scrolls through his search results. He can’t find anything, anything that’s right, anything right for Castiel. There’s an urn painted with a hummingbird hovering over purple orchids, one painted with a child’s hands freeing a butterfly over a field of grass, one with a cross floating in a sky of full of clouds. There are small ones, for infants, ones in the shape of dogs with angel wings. Heart-shaped charms meant to be stuffed with some piece of a dead family member and hung around someone’s neck.
He should have realized, though, that Dean would never leave him there, that Dean would save him. And lying in his bed, listening to Sam and Dean fight for maybe the fifteenth time since they’d gotten back to the Bunker, Castiel wishes that Dean would have just given up on him.
Castiel lifts himself from the bed, pulls Dean’s hand away from Dean’s body. “Don’t. I want to.” He buries his face, in between Dean’s legs, bending over Dean, bending over across the bed. Dean gasps for air, gasps for anything, as Castiel’s tongue touches him where he’s still raw, as Castiel takes him into his mouth.
Jesus Saves, claims the marquee sign of a movie theater, its letters rocked crooked by the explosion from the store down the street. But Jesus and God, they aren’t going to stop this Apocalypse. Humanity’s only chance, to survive, to stop Armageddon, is Sam and Dean, and maybe Castiel, if he could steal all his powers back, from the angels who had cut him off. If he could find the demon, the one who he’d thrown into the flames, and tear her open from the inside out. And Castiel knows he should condemn himself to Hell, for liking the way it felt to take her, cover her body in holy fire.
“You can’t save me. I don’t deserve to be saved. Not after this.” Dean drops to his knees, his hand falling into Castiel’s, as he tilts his face up, into the abyss. “I just needed to make it stop. Alastair, all of it.”
Castiel wipes his hand on his trench coat and runs his fingers along Dean’s chin and mouth. Dean rolls his head along Castiel’s shoulder, as Castiel wraps both his arms around him, burying his face against Dean’s. Castiel could let the rest of the world be lost, Raptured, and it wouldn’t matter, because Dean is his, for now.
Dean hasn’t slept, hasn’t eaten, has barely spoken to Sam, since they’d gotten back to the Bunker, without Mom, without Cas. Without whatever sanity Dean had left. He pulls his knees up to his chin, dropping another beer bottle off the bed, onto the floor. He can hear the glass roll across the other eight, maybe ten, maybe twenty, empty bottles that have collected beside him over the past two days. Or it might be three. He can’t even keep the days straight anymore. They all blend together, into one never-ending nightmare.
“Fuck you, Dean.” Castiel lets his fingers run along Dean’s cheeks, lets his mouth slowly, and fully consume Dean’s lips and chin and neck. “I have to go to work.”
It’s been months, maybe it’s even been a year, since he’s allowed himself anything, and now he can hear Crowley’s blood as it screams through his veins. “How are we even getting in there? We’re just going to walk in and ask to see the CEO of some big bank?”
“It should have been me ripped apart by those hellhounds. It should be me who’s dead,” Dean’s lips move against Castiel’s neck as he speaks.
Last night on Earth. And Castiel’s spending it by wasting Dean’s stolen money on trying to get himself hard enough to fuck someone who won’t remember him, anything about him, twenty minutes after he’s done, if he can even get that far. He can think of a thousand other things he would rather be doing. Maybe a hundred. Maybe only one.
This is how the dream, the nightmare, starts almost every night. It begins here, in the depths of some other place, some world that Dean has escaped. And then it fades into the voices, the faces, of the people he couldn’t help. The kids he couldn’t save from some hellbent ghost in Milwaukee when he was twenty. The women who had their throats ripped out by a vampire nest because he was too busy getting drunk, getting fucked. The father of three massacred by a demon that Dean couldn’t exorcise. They wait for him, in these never-ending hallucinations. They remind Dean that everything, is his fault. That their lives ended, because of him. That he’s no hero, no better than the things he hunts.
“Paid for what?” Castiel lets the can fall from his hand, and he doesn’t know if he wants to know the answer to his question, because he’s not really sure why he asked.
Castiel drives for hours, listening to nothing other than the sound of the Impala’s engine and the sound of Dean snoring against the passenger side window. In the middle of Ohio, Dean mutters incoherently. On the state line of Pennsylvania, at something like 1 in the morning, Dean opens his eyes, runs his fingers along Castiel’s thigh out of reflex or instinct, runs his fingers along Castiel to make sure he’s still there, and falls back to sleep.
He tells me something about everyone being gone. Everyone. Not just the people from Apocalypse World. Donna. He drove back here from Minnesota, because he called me maybe a hundred times and I didn’t answer, because he assumed that I was gone, dead, like everyone else. Then he asks, “Where’s Cas?”
She breaks away from him, after what feels like minutes, hours, and opens the door to the hallway filled with pink-hued lighting and the sounds of desperation and drunkenness. “It should. Come back when it does.”
And whatever was sacred, divine, about any of this, about the things they did in secret, has been replaced with the unholy feeling of two scarred and bruised and mortal bodies moving against one another, of clothes being pulled away from helpless human flesh, of Dean’s mouth and Dean’s fingers everywhere.
And he walks, until he’s in a park, a swing set casting its long shadow across a sandbox and a seesaw and a pair of aluminum seahorses mounted on steel springs. He lies down on a red-yellow-and-blue roundabout, or merry-go-round, or whatever it’s called, letting his feet drag along the ground until he’s slowly spinning, staring up into the dark sky that’s dotted with blurry stars.
“Was I happy? No not really.” Jack doesn’t know if he should admit any of this; things he’s never told anyone, things he’s never even really let himself think about. Because he never cared whether he was happy, because it didn’t matter, because he had only been on a mission to kill God. “It’s funny. When I had all this power, I was weak, vulnerable, because everyone thought that power was theirs to use. And now that my grace is gone, and I’m nothing but human, I’m more powerful than ever. Because no one can try to use me, because I have nothing to use and because I’m just like everyone else. And I feel like I finally have control over myself, and I can never hurt anyone again, I can never do…what I did to Mary…I can never do that again, and that’s all that matters to me.”
Jude 1:7, or something, some word of an absconded God, that Castiel can’t remember as he comes in Dean’s mouth.
The entrance to Ethan Burke’s office is two wooden doors, stained mahogany. It’s at the end of a long, winding hallway lined with paintings of boats floating on water, of flower-covered fields, and sunsets against skylines. Nothing is locked, and Sam pulls the doors apart.
Dean doesn’t answer Lisa, doesn’t say anything at all, as he lets himself fall onto the mattress next to her.
Dean runs his fingers along the cold metal of his gun in the pocket of his jacket, and he knows what he should do, but he knows he can’t do it, that he’ll never be able to do it. It was his job, to protect Sam, to save Sam from turning into this, and he failed, and he knows he needs to give in, give up.
“Yeah,” Dean says. “We’re done. We saved the world, for good. We won. I don’t know, what we do now. But we won.”
The bathroom door creaks open and Castiel can barely hear Dean’s voice over the shower running, “Cas, you’ve been in here all night. You good?”
But Dean knows that if he admits, to himself, to Castiel, why this is different, he’ll lose his mind. Because if Castiel doesn’t feel the same way as Dean, even now, even human, Dean can’t blame it on some kind of celestial incapacity, some kind of failure, to understand what this has always been about. It just means that Castiel doesn’t fucking love him back.
In the glass-panel windows that line the back of the house, Sam can see Crowley, doing whatever the fuck he thinks will help them find Lucifer. And Sam can’t stand the sight of him, can’t stand that, less than an hour ago, Sam’s mouth was pressed against Crowley’s skin, that Sam had let Crowley’s blood engulf him.
Dean looks across the wasteland of steel, back at Bobby’s house. Maybe, Sam or Bobby would come looking for him out here. Maybe he doesn’t care. His ears are still ringing from the sound of the explosion that ripped Jo and Ellen apart. And he just needs to make it quiet. He lifts the edge of the knife to Castiel’s neck, but he stops himself from doing what he’s done so many times before.
“Why? You don’t. Quit that shitty job with that shitty boss who used you, tricked you into watching her kid.” Dean runs his lips up the back of Castiel’s neck.
And when Crowley is gone, Castiel lays down in the grass and watches Heaven. He watches Heaven even as sprinklers rise from the ground and saturate his already wet clothes, spraying across his face and into his mouth. Droplets of water fall into his eyes, and he prays, prays to God to tell him what to do, prays to God to save him from what he’s about to do, prays to God to stop him from falling, prays to God to give him Dean Winchester back.
“He wanted this,” Sam runs the blade of a knife along the ground, scratching zig-zag lines into the cement. “Because he’d rather be with you than be in Heaven. Because if there’s anyone who can help someone be…human…it’s you, because you’re the best one that any of us know.”
Silence always follows. Silence, while Dean folds his hands around Castiel’s arms, keeping his body locked inside them. Silence, while Castiel’s lips move along Dean’s neck. And the silence is different than it used to be. This silence used to be confusing, filled with avoidance, doubt. But, now, it’s a silence filled with the sound of Dean’s body breaking away from Castiel’s, lying on the floor beside him, his eyes dropping to Castiel’s and staying there. A silence that one of them always waits for the other to break.
Dean leans back, against the dirt, into the mist, pushing his body down into Castiel’s hand, up into Castiel’s mouth. Every part of him feels like it’s part of Castiel, and Dean imagines that he’s not lying in the middle of Bobby Singer’s Salvage Yard, wasted on angel grace, trying to erase all the guilt, all the death, that’s usually screaming in his head. He lets himself imagine that to Castiel, all of this means something, something that Dean doesn’t think Castiel could ever understand.
The spell, with Jack’s blood, the spell that once resurrected Lucifer from the Empty, the one that was supposed to resurrect Cas, nothing happened, it didn’t do anything. You need the blood of someone connected to the angel, and Jack isn’t Cas’ blood, not really.
He pulls at the collar of his shirt, moving it down just enough for him to see the empty skin where his anti-possession tattoo had been. It had healed, disappeared, when Sam had done the angel spell. And now, there’s no reason for him to get a new one, no reason because all the demons are gone.
I pull at my hair. I pick up the chair that sits in the middle of the room and throw it into the wall. I scream out to the Empty, ask it to take me too. I stumble into the hallway, retracing the steps we’d taken to his death. My fingers move along the wall, along the scratches embedded from Billie’s scythe.
And Castiel convinces himself, that everything is fine, convinces himself to lay back on the mattress. To let his hand slide underneath the waist of his pants, lets his fingertips slide along himself, against the continuing sound of someone else’s sex, someone else’s fantasy.
“Then you’ll have Cas. And Jack. And Bobby. They’ll help you.  But I’m out.” Sam digs his fingers into the Earth.
Castiel’s eyes are lost on the never-ending wave of yellow taxis, the crowds of men and women and children passing by, men and women and children, staring down at their phones, staring away from one another. The sound of sirens, the sound of horns honking, is relentless. And Castiel remembers when this, this City, was something else. Before buildings that reach into clouds were built, before the streets were overflowing with life. When it was a newly-born world that felt like it would fall to the will of Heaven someday.
Chuck smiles and walks to the center of the room, picking up the chair that’s still lying knocked over on the floor and leaning his arms on it. “Remember when Sam got better? From the demon blood addiction, from all that psychic yellow-eyed-demon crap? That was all me. And, after Sam shot me, I took it all away. I let it all come back slowly. But not just that—Sam and I are still linked, even though our wounds are healed, and I’ve been feeding him, my memories, my power. Creating something—I don’t know—God-like, but I guess a little more demonic, a little more evil, right Sam?”
Dean brings his knees up, lets his hips grind into the air, against nothing, lets his eyes lock on Castiel’s as Castiel brings him to the brink of losing control. Dean groans, his teeth sinking  into his lip. He pulls Castiel closer to him, his fingers on Castiel’s chin and cheeks. He can feel himself on the edge, and Castiel holds him there, on the verge of insanity, ecstasy, or something. “Cas, let me come,” Dean whispers into Castiel’s mouth. “Please.”
“The sister of one of the women we saved tonight had a thing for him. He said they were going for coffee. He won’t be back.” Dean throws his jacket down onto the floor. “I told him to, you know, go for it. It’s been a long time for him. He doesn’t have something—something like us.”
“No it’s—okay.” Dean sits up against the back of the chair, lets his eyes search the faces of the people sitting at the tables around them, like any of them would care about what he’s about to say. “When it was just me and my Dad, hunting, sometimes he would blame me for Sam leaving. He would blame me for everything, actually. Hunts that went wrong. People he couldn’t save.”
“There is no one else, Dean,” Castiel rises, so close to Dean that he can feel Dean’s breath as he exhales, he can hear Dean’s heart, pounding in his chest. In the thousands of years that he’s been stationed on Earth there have been humans, humans that maybe Castiel wanted to know, differently. But he’s never felt this close to rebelling, this close to falling, this close to wanting something he didn’t think he could want.
So I just sit here, watching him maybe drink himself to death, rambling on about how we’re never going to survive this, his legs rubbing against mine under the table when he leans forward. He turns his eyes up to mine. “Cas?”
So he pushes Dean’s lips into his throat, the feeling of Dean’s mouth against him, sucking out his grace, sends waves of shock, longing through him. Dean pulls at the collar of Castiel’s coat, pushing it aside, his teeth brushing against Castiel’s skin as Castiel’s grace drips down into him. Castiel groans, into Dean’s forehead, and he lets him take more and more of him, until Castiel can feel himself on the edge of humanity.
This is far from the first time he’s lost his mind, but this is different. He’s on his knees, books of lore wide open, in a circle around him. Broken bowls and failed ingredients of seven or eight spells that didn’t work, that didn’t summon the Empty, covering his jeans and the ground in front of him. His hands are bloody, from the shattered glass of a bottle of something, and he leaves red handprints in the grass, that almost match the one that’s still on the shoulder of his jacket. He refused to change before we came here.
There’s a phrase, humans use sometimes, a phrase Castiel has heard during his times stationed on Earth.
Dean falls back into the cushion of the loveseat. It’s soft and clean and it wraps itself around his back. It reminds him that, all of his life, for as long as he can remember, he mostly sleeps, or tries to sleep, on the broken mattresses and the dirty sheets of forsaken motels. It reminds him that this life will never let him have a loveseat he can sink himself into, will never let him have anything but loss and confusion. It reminds him that this, this sprawling apartment with its glass windows overlooking all of the City, isn’t something that he can ever have.
But he spent all day dressed-up as an FBI agent at a morgue and behind the yellow-tape of some crime scene and at the house of the fifth so-called animal-attack victim this forsaken town has seen this week. And he spent all day, trying not to think about Dean finding him back here, Dean still covered in the sweat and blood of a slaughtered vampire nest, Dean still high on adrenaline and fear. All day, trying not to think about having Dean on these worn-out sheets that probably haven’t been washed since the last people who screwed themselves into unconsciousness in this $50-a-night room in some lost part of Upstate New York.
“You’re free. All of you.” Amara turns to Jack, whispers into his ear, and then she vanishes, and Ruby vanishes, and Dean puts his head into his hands, and falls forward over Sam.
He closes his eyes, pretends Castiel is closing his eyes, pretends Castiel is unconscious with sleep. And Dean pretends that, in the silence, he can finally say it.
Stepping over the glass of the burned-out frame of the building covered in the invisible carcasses of hellhounds, Castiel makes his way through piles of still-smoldering wood, piles of twisted nails, piles of paint cans with lids blown off. He makes his way to the remains, the ash and bone, of Ellen and Jo. And he knows he should bury them, or scatter their ashes, something other than leaving their seared corpses for the scavengers. But Dean is praying to him, praying for him, silencing every other thought in Castiel’s brain.
“Sounds the same as my father,” Castiel squints against the sunrise. “Except, I think my father fucks with everyone’s head in a way. And a lot of people still want his approval. Actually, a lot of people think they need his approval for everything.”
And Dean doesn’t know, doesn’t understand, why Castiel is standing here, saying that he needed to come back to him with a win, or why Castiel is trying to shove the cassette tape that they’d fucked to eight times in the back of the Impala in his face, and he pretends not to realize they’re on the edge of disaster. “Great. And I’d like a beer.”
Dean turns to Castiel, and, for the first time since Castiel got here, there’s nothing but a quiet stillness.
“I don’t think it’s going to help you against, you know, Chuck, or whatever he calls himself.” Ruby closes the laptop and rests her elbow on it.
The woman who had been selling whatever to whoever in the BMW slides down onto the pavement beside him. She drops her bag onto the ground in front of Dean, revealing twenty or thirty small bags of something, a wallet, and a Barbie doll with glitter-streaked blue hair. She looks up at him through crooked glasses. “Want some?” she kicks her bag with the tip of her sneaker.
“Yeah,” Castiel turns his eyes up toward the ceiling. There’s a clock hanging above the cracking doorway, its hands frozen at 11:05. Somewhere, in the past, the clock had watched over the family that lived here, a family with 2.5 kids and a white picket fence, and now its dead face stares down at Castiel, telling him, reminding him, it’s almost all over. He looks down at Dean, spread out by his feet, knees bent, shirt pulling away from his jeans. His hand slides up inside the leg of Castiel’s pants. Castiel turns his face back to the bourbon bottle. He reads the Government Warning three times before he says, “I guess, until recently, I never really understood why humans are always so willing to do anything, pay anything, just to be touched.”
And now he’s half asleep, lying in a bed that he’d never actually slept in, waiting for Dean to tell him to leave, waiting for Dean to tell him that he could never feel the same way. Waiting for him to tell him he was horrified, disgusted, or something like that.
“I won’t let you die, Cas,” Dean slips his fingers underneath Castiel’s. “I think I need this. I think I need you.”
“We won’t find a way, Dean. This is it. There was a way. But you needed Cas back, and now I need Eileen.” The parts of Sam’s brain, that knew this was all wrong, that knew Dean could never survive doing this, survive murdering Castiel, are all gone, and he doesn’t care, doesn’t care that Dean is about to fall apart.  All he wants is Castiel dead, Dean dead, all he wants is whatever Chuck wants.
“What did you tell me that time? That…I’m always the something that goes wrong?” Castiel puts his head down, letting the water pour across him. “I’m afraid it will be worse, like this. You should have left me in the Empty. That’s where my story was supposed to end.”
“I guess, though, you were right,” Sam throws the knife into a stack of discarded weapons. “At least, for you. Me…look at how quickly I let Chuck take over me. I was weak, I couldn’t fight it, and I’m sorry I never told you about what was happening to me.”
“Maybe,” he says, wrapping his hand around my throat, until my breath can barely escape my lungs, and he raises his other hand to my mouth. I can feel him, slowly pulling the life out of me, black smoke filling the air in between us. I can feel myself fading, leaving my body. I can’t speak, and he raises his hand higher, above my head, and I can’t see him through the thick haze that floats quietly out of my mouth.
We’ve run through this same dialogue four or five times in the hour and a half since Sam’s gone to sleep. I peel the label off an empty beer bottle, crumble it in my fingers, throw it into a glass and watch it sink down to the bottom. Anything to distract myself from him.
And Dean knows he can’t sit in this room another second, restraining himself from asking Castiel if he was the reason, if the things they’d done in the secrecy of empty warehouses and on forsaken roadsides were the reason, that Castiel believed he belonged somewhere, some place, adjacent to Hell.
“Whatever…whatever you want,” he says, and maybe that’s what he always says. Maybe he’s just always this complicit. Because he’s Dean Winchester; self-loathing, self-sacrificing, suicidal, alcoholic Dean Winchester. And maybe I really should stop.
Jack is sitting alone, on the rotted-out bark of a fallen tree, staring up at the blackening sky. He woke Cas up from the Empty once before, I tell him to do it again, but he says he doesn’t know how. He says Cas isn’t asleep. He says the Empty isn’t asleep, because he made it loud. Then he says, “Kill me.”
Dean reaches down, to just above where his body is joined with Castiel’s, and he wraps his hand around himself, moving his wrist in rhythm with Castiel grinding against him.
There was no chance now, without Jack’s powers, that they could bring down Chuck. It was only a matter of time until they were all dead, again.
“No,” Dean holds his hand out, balancing the gun on his fingers. “No. Never. We’ll find a way, Sam. Don’t do this. Fight him, fight Chuck.”
“I’m not used to it either, but I seem to end up like this—bleeding, a lot.” Castiel shifts his wrist, letting Dean wipe away smears of blood that leak from the gauze.
The onslaught of demons through a raging garden of flames is relentless. The arms of a hundred, a thousand, maimed souls reach for Castiel, shrieking for their own salvation. He can feel their eternal damnation in their touch.
“I went back to Missouri, to try to find Lucifer, or Death, or someone,” Castiel says. “But I didn’t find anyone. Except for the dead. Lucifer’s victims.”
And somewhere, Lucifer is free. Somewhere, Lucifer is pretending to be some poor bastard’s dead husband or wife or girlfriend or boyfriend, asking to be let in, to become one with his next vessel. But Dean doesn’t care, right now, about the world falling apart, because Castiel’s mouth is on his neck and his shoulder, because Castiel’s lips pull on his earlobe as he tells Dean that there’s nothing else in this world, in this universe, that’s ever made him feel like this.
Lucifer won today. Sam closes his eyes, blacking out the unknown ceiling above him, and tries not to think about the growing death toll, tries not to think about the growing wave of destruction and death. And he knows, Lucifer is out there, finding his next vessel, that Lucifer is out there, tearing apart the world.
Castiel parks Lisa’s car, backing its tires against the curb. Then he walks through the neighborhood, against the setting sunlight, along where the grass meets the blacktop, until he finds a Pontiac Grand Am, its black paint fading away, resting on the curb across from the darkened windows of a house with a red brick walkway.
And Dean wants Castiel, again, wants Castiel to make him come so fucking bad,, but Castiel is laying here, naked and human and empty and damaged. So Dean lets his own hand fall, fall past his waist, and he lets his fingers tighten around himself as Castiel exhales into him.
“Get over it, Sam, it was a long time ago.” I tell him, backing away from his body. “Anyway, it’s not like I was ever a big fan of God.”
Castiel knows he needs this, to prove that he’s faithful. To prove to the other angels that he’s not on the edge of defiance, rebellion.
Castiel lets himself fall forward, lets himself fall toward Dean until he can feel Dean’s breath against his chin. Once, in what already feels like some other lifetime, Dean was forbidden. Human, fragile. And Castiel used to draw some imaginary line between them. A wall built from fear and guilt and faith that he pretended prevented him from going too far. From finally having Dean, from letting Dean have him, from finally and ultimately betraying the God that abandoned and disregarded them both.
Because Dean can’t do anything, except fall into his mattress, holding the bag of gray dust against him, telling himself over and over that none of this is real. That there’s no way Castiel—Angel of the Lord Castiel—is just gone, is just nothing.
“I can give you what you want, Jimmy. What do you want?” Her voice is soft, almost hypnotic, behind the closed door, across the table. “I can give you anything. That’s what I’m here for.”
Castiel turns toward the row of decimated stores and signs, toward the stars and stripes that warn him against the betrayal of God, and toward Death and the Devil.
He moves forward, leaving the dark mist behind him, and he sees her, standing in a pile of ash and embers and bone.
He’s avoided everyone, especially Cas, all day. Last night, every part of him wanted more, wanted everything, but instead, he let Cas fall asleep human for the first time in years, against him. Dean had talked him through the nightmares, the ones that Cas could never have as an angel, but that seemed to rush into Cas’ brain all at once somewhere around 3 am.
“Maybe we can get lost, for awhile, after we take care of whatever this is.” Castiel can feel Dean’s chest against his fingertips, he can feel Dean breathing against his touch, and he lets himself pretend, for once, that this isn’t just something that exists in hidden, quiet places, that this isn’t something that ends when they’re lying on some bed covered in Dean’s sweat, covered in each other.
Dean sits up, and his eyes fall from Castiel’s mouth down to his neck, watching the way Castiel’s grace illuminates the space between them. And he wants to refuse this, he wants to banish Castiel back to wherever, but he needs to feel numb, he needs to sleep, he needs to stop the throbbing pain running through his skull.
“It was,” Castiel says. “But I’m not sure I’m the best one to go talk to people about relationships.”
Dean Winchester smells like whiskey and Purgatory. Half-asleep and half-drunk, he pours the rest of whatever is in his glass down his throat, knocking aside the empty bottles that litter the table in front of us. “Fuck God,” he says. “Fuck everything.” He drops his head down onto the splintered wood, dragging his fingers down his face.
He tells me, no one can know, about this, about us, about what we’re doing. That we’re doing it to destroy God. Save the universe. And then his eyes go black.
“I didn’t save the world,” Dean turns his face up to Castiel's. “I thought Sam was gone. I thought the world was gone. I only prayed to save you.”
Castiel slips his fingertips in between their bodies, lets his hands replace Dean’s, lets himself close his eyes and feel Dean’s skin, feel Dean’s everything, against him. And, in this corridor of some motel somewhere in Iowa, this—Castiel—is the only thing that makes sense to Dean.  The cold glass of the vending machine against him, Dean presses his forehead into Castiel’s. “Cas, I—”
And in the dark, over the silence of Heaven, Castiel decides that, someday, Dean Winchester will be the end of him.
Dean doesn’t answer, he just stares, his green eyes bloodshot. Inside, he’s furious, that Castiel can’t figure out the answers to his own questions, that he doesn’t know, that he hasn’t known all along. He’s furious that Castiel, the angel who gripped him tight and raised him from Perdition, fell, lost his grace, became human, all for someone like him. He’s furious that he doesn’t know what to say to Castiel, or how to say it, or whether he should say it at all. He wasn’t worth this. “What did you even mean?” he asks Castiel. “Your deal….you said you didn’t know what would make you happy. You said the one thing you want, is something you know you can never have? What the hell were you talking about?”
“No, I’m not God,” Amara says. “I can never be like him. I don’t know why he did this, why he did these things to all of you.”
Once, I led armies. Once, I pulled Dean Winchester’s soul from Hell. But then I fell, a hundred times I fell, and now there’s nothing left of me.
Ruby manages to sit up, in the center of Sam’s bed, pulling her clothes over her blood-streaked body. Disoriented, she makes her way to the doorway, and out in the hall. She calls to Sam, but he doesn’t answer, and she stands, in front of Dean’s room.  She wonders if she should just leave. She can find another way back to Hell. She doesn’t need Sam Winchester, or Dean Winchester, or Castiel, or their God problems. She’s supposed to be a villain in this story. Maybe. She doesn’t know anymore.
“Well, this never meant anything anyway, right?” Castiel’s tongue grazes along the inside of Dean’s lips. “So what would it change?”
There’s a clearing in front of him, and he stops. He could turn around now, before he has to face the burned-out corpses of his family, before he has to face God, alone and human and powerless.
Eileen brushes her arm into his. “You don’t. And this doesn’t mean it’s going to work out. But you and me, we’ve been hunters since we were kids, we don’t know anything else—and now, you’re telling me that everything, all those monsters, are just gone? So, I don’t really know what that means for me, or you. And I don’t know who we are anymore, if we aren’t hunters, but maybe we can figure that out together.”
“Sam and Dean will never give in to you, they aren’t going to give you what you want, ever. Not this Sam and Dean,” I stand up and try my best to loom over him, try to intimidate God.  “And not me.”
“Do it,” Dean reaches out to Sam, the gun hanging loosely from his hand. “Do it. Let Cas and Jack and Ruby go. Isn’t this all Chuck wants? One brother kills the other? This is all you need to do. And then you’ll be free from me.”
“You know, Sam Winchester. The boy with the demon blood. I fixed him once, made him…sane…cured his addiction. Stopped him from destroying everything. But not anymore.”  God raises his hand in front of my face and smiles. And for the first time today, I regret being powerless, defenseless….human.
The sound of the key card in the door tears through the room and Castiel pulls himself up to the edge of the bed, letting his hand fall away from his disheveled clothes. It’s only Dean, who walks through the door, only Dean who drops a duffel bag onto the floor, only Dean whose face and jeans are dotted with crimson splatter.  “Where’s Sam?” Castiel’s feet dig into the worn rug beneath him.
“Do you know Hayley Meyer, Ms. Gallagher?” Castiel asks, sliding his body away from Dean’s on the cushion when he realizes their legs are rubbing into one another.
Castiel lays back down, next to Dean, swallows, kisses Dean so that Dean can taste himself all over the inside of Castiel’s mouth, kisses Dean like no one has ever kissed him.
Castiel is kneeling in the white powder collecting on the grass. He looks up at Dean, resigned, hopeless, giving Dean permission to obey, succumb.
Castiel fucks him here because, here, the headboard of Dean’s bed doesn’t rattle against the wall. Here, there are no mattress springs to creak underneath them and echo throughout the room. Here, there are no sheets to stain. Here, Castiel’s hands slip onto Dean’s and hold him down on the ground. Here, the things Castiel whispers into Dean’s ear, are just the things they whisper to each other when one of them is inside the other, when their clothes are thrown halfway across the room and neither of them can remember how they wound up tangled together.
And he reminds himself again, reminds himself because he can never forget, “Castiel’s dead. All the way dead. Because of you.”
So he turns it all off. He cuts himself off from Heaven. Cuts himself off from Angel Radio, or whatever.
“You didn’t. But I understand why Dean, why he wanted me to kill Chuck. I understand everything now, I think. And I’m ready to just…start over, to be human, with my family, with you.”
Dean has never told anyone, but he’s done this before. There was some guy in a bar in Sioux Falls, whose face and name he can’t remember anymore. There was the time with Lee, when his father had found them, passed out, naked and drunk, on the floor of a hotel room. He’d invented some girl, said she’d spent the night with both of them and then left when her boyfriend called, but Dean knew his father never really believed his story. Then there were seven times with Benny, after Dean had rescued him from Purgatory, and every time ended with Dean face down on filthy motel room bedsheets, covered in his own blood after letting Benny nearly suck him dry.
“Too much humanity,” Ruby sits down beside me. “You know, me and Sam had a thing. It was pretty good.”
“Because that’s what God wanted. Or, because that’s what I was told God wanted.” Castiel tilts his head back, stares up at the ceiling, at splatters of brownish leak-marks seeping through the bumpy white paint. “But I don’t know if God even exists anymore.”
I cut into Ruby’s arm and press my mouth against her, sucking the blood out of her veins. She still tastes as good as when we used to do this, years ago, and she runs her hands up my back and through my hair. Only part of me wants to stop.
And I drop down to my knees, and I pray, I pray to Cas, and hope he can hear me, hope that angels can hear other angels here, hope that he still wants to answer my prayer. Cas, this is all my fault, there are things about me, that no one knows, that I pretend even I don’t know. There are things I feel, that I never thought he could understand. There are things I wanted, that I never thought he wanted.
If I give in, if I give it Jack’s grace, we have nothing. No way to defeat Chuck. No way to bring everyone back. No way to save the world.  But I’d have Cas. “I’ll do it….if you give Cas his grace back.”
Dean looks up at him, water from his hair drizzles onto Castiel’s legs, and says, “Cas, are you sure?”
Castiel turns, toward Dean, from across the bed. “I don’t want to talk about this. I don’t want to talk about angels or Heaven. I don’t want to talk about why I couldn’t stay with you and Sam.”
The suit Dean had worn to play FBI agent earlier today is still strewn on the bed, tie dangling off the mattress-edge onto the hardwood floor. He pushes the wrinkled pile to the ground, and he turns to Castiel, slides his fingers down the buttons of Castiel’s shirt. “Sorry about your date. Seems like it sucked.”
“God is dead,” Castiel pulls his face up to Dean’s, lets his lips linger on his. “God is dead, and you’re finally mine.”
Soap bubbles trickle down his body and pool together before drifting down the drain, washing away the Empty, washing away anything that was divine, celestial. Castiel can still remember the depths of Hell, remember pulling Dean’s tortured, broken soul back to Earth, and now Dean had saved him, scarred him, stripped him of his grace without even realizing.
“No one but Sam,” In the darkness, I kneel down next to Cas, pull him up towards me. His eyes open, barely and he opens his mouth, but he can’t seem to get any words out, and he drops his hand into mine. His fingers fall in between mine.
Castiel’s eyes meet Dean’s across the near darkness, and he takes the lace between his teeth, pulling the fabric down just enough for him to take Dean into his mouth. He lets his body jerk forward as Dean grasps the leather fastened around Castiel’s neck, and his fingers climb in between Dean’s legs and push their way inside his body.
“Yeah, I want it,” Dean says, standing at the edge of the fire. The way Jack positioned the branches, pointing up towards Heaven, it reminds him of every hunter’s funeral, everyone they’ve lost. It reminds him of everything he wants to forget now, everything he needs to let go.
He turns himself so that he’s facing Dean, and pulls him into the running water, soaking him, drenching his clothes. He pulls Dean’s t-shirt halfway up his stomach as he presses him into the wall, shoves his tongue past Dean’s lips. He holds Dean  against the cracked bathroom tiles, shoves his body up against Dean’s. Dean’s jeans, saturated with water, chafe against his bare skin.
But Dean tangles Castiel’s tie around his hand, pulling himself up just enough for his lips to almost graze against Castiel’s. Castiel’s eyes turn to Dean’s, and he wants to give in, but he pushes Dean away, back down onto the bed, but he falls forward, Dean still tugging on his tie.
I just say, “But I can’t do that,” and I drain his grace, Jack’s grace, the grace I’d just shoved down inside him, until the light in his eyes goes dark.
“You don’t.” I pull him up from the chair and he stumbles back, confused, tired. I tug on his shirt, bring his face closer to mine while backing him into the wall. I shouldn’t want this, I can’t possibly want this, he can’t possibly want this.
Castiel wraps his fingers around Dean’s wrist, forces the weapon out of Dean’s hand. “I was supposed to save you, stop you from doing what you’ve already done.”
What Castiel is going offer Dean, is something close to blasphemy. But he doesn’t care, and he doesn’t know why, but all that matters right now, is Dean, giving Dean what he wants, giving Dean peace. Castiel reaches into the pocket of his coat and pulls out the long, silver blade, reflecting dim glimmers of color across the room.
But, tonight, Castiel lets his eyelids open, just enough to see Dean, thrusting himself forward, the curve of his back highlighted in the darkness. Castiel knows, it should be him, beneath Dean, it should be him, fucking Dean, him, finally getting what he deserves.
“No. I mean, I don’t know.” He looms over me, blocking out the sky. My entire body aches, all of the angel grace gone, everything gone, except the feeling of Sam yanking me forward and Cas’ hand still loosely dangling in mine. “What if Ruby…can help?”
And something about this, the way Castiel’s mouth begs for his, the way Castiel’s tongue slides along his own, the way he knows that Castiel isn’t going to listen to his pleas, tastes like treason. But Dean pulls away just enough to mumble, “Yes.”
“I’m not going back to Heaven, Not right away anyway. I have a lot I need to fix here, and in a lot of other worlds, ones that Chuck destroyed,” she says. “And I’ll bring most of them back. But not everyone will be the same. Because you need to know peace, for once, Dean.”
“Sometimes, I don’t know the difference between this, and Sam and the demon blood,” Dean says, the blade the only thing separating his body from Castiel’s. “And sometimes I tell myself, I shouldn’t do this.”
Castiel traces the same steps he used to take when they did this. He runs his fingers along the buttons on his shirt, undoing them one by one, letting the material fall open across his chest. He drops the knife onto the bed, lays down beside Dean, tries not to think about the way Dean’s eyes move from his own eyes, down his lips, down the rest of his body.
And I’d finally told him, what I’d felt for so long, what I needed to say, what I think he needed to hear. And now I’m alone, and it’s too loud to sleep.
“Yeah, me too.” Dean lays down behind Castiel, pulls Castiel’s back into his chest. “But it was just a nightmare. It’s nothing.”
Dean pulls himself up, so that he’s directly across from Sam. “I came out here…to get out of there…to clear my head or whatever. I don’t want to talk about this. We’re all going to be dead soon anyway.”
And then he tells her everything, and he can tell how carefully she watches his lips as he speaks, reading every word, the things he can remember, and the things that Dean, and Cas, and Jack all told him. About the spell, how he used Chuck’s power and Amara’s power to make Dean into some kind of angel, that he sent him to the Empty to save Cas, that he brought him back, that Dean made some kind of deal with the Empty, Jack’s grace for Cas, for Ruby. About all the demon blood, about how he couldn’t control himself, about Ruby. About how Chuck had taken over him entirely, and that it was Dean who had summoned Amara, broken her free. About how, everything they hunted, everything they spent their lives fighting, is locked away now, far, far from Earth.
