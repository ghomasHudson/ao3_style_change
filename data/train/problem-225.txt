“My good boys,” she said, giggling. John play-growled and teasing-nipped; Sherlock got on all fours and
Days long gone and far away. Now he was an Australian citizen, thanks to his Sydney-born dad, and he lived in the Land Down Under, where turning his life upside down had been the absolutely best thing he’d ever done.
“Yes. I hope so. He needs. He needs.” Mycroft shuddered. Pressed his hand to his arm. “Something’s not right.” Then he looked up at John as though waking up at last. “I’m. Sorry. About Mary.”
And Culverton Smith held his hand over Sherlock’s nose and mouth and pinched before Sherlock could even take a breath.
Finally, the doctor pronounced that Sherlock was not in danger, but would have to stay a while longer for observation, as well as his interrupted treatment for dehydration and exhaustion.
During his sojourn in the nursery, Bart had absorbed the scents of baby powder and a little of Mary’s Clair de Lune and even a frisson of John’s aftershave, and the homeness of it sent Sherlock finally to sleep, with his mother singing to him on one side, John holding his hand on the other.
They moved again, side by side now, legs slotted together, hips rolling so that their pricks slid, trapped between their bodies and slick with need. Breathing in each other’s panting breaths, swallowing each other's soft keening cries. Fingers caressing skin, sliding through sweat-damp hair, lips tasting the salt on each other’s cheeks, and at last, and soon, Sherlock cried out as he came, his eyes pressed to John’s throat and then John came, forehead pressed to Sherlock’s cheek.
London gave them a sunny day; the sound of church bells carried lightly in the air, alongside the call of birds in the morning.
“I don’t want to marry you baby,” said Sally, all solemn. “Marriage is a patriarchal trap built to keep women as chattel.”
But – and Violet had once made Sally unexpectedly teary with this observation – Ford was much more like his mother. He, like Sally Donovan (once copper, now government agent), hunted slow and sleek like one of the great cats. Patient and precise, they moved carefully before taking what they want by the throat. Their prey might be different – Sally was after villains, Ford chased scientific discovery – but they had the same focus and similar methods.
“Is that why you came to look for the knife?” Sherlock challenged him. “Because you felt bad that my sister died and your family covered it up? How did you intend to go down? Oh. Oh of course. You didn’t.”
“Sherlock’s fine. He’s pulled this shit before.” He sounded less angry now, more panicked, and then enraged again, “Fuck off!”
They trammed it back to the city and found a place overlooking the Yarra to pour champagne and toast the happy couple, by now probably naked and honeymooning like rabbits among the detritus of Christmas decorations in every room, if their pashing behind the Christmas tree was anything to go by.
Sherlock kissed him, a little peck on the mouth, and hugged John with the arm across his back. “Hugging is known to be medically and psychologically beneficial. Little Watson agrees. Don’t you Watson?”
Sherlock was also most emphatically not worried, no no no. Nope. He was a detective. He was a professional. He was gathering
John, who’d often felt friendless and abandoned himself before Melbourne, smiled at him. “There they all were,” he agreed.
Ford wasn’t sure he could be any more in love with Violet, but he felt his heart make the effort and it was the easiest thing in the world. Violet always made everything easy.
John’s own eyes went sultry too, and he leaned up to kiss his darling, who tasted of champagne, pavlova, and come.
At first they couldn’t see their son. The flat was in a terrible state. Several boxes had been overturned, their contents spilled across the floor. Papers were strewn from one end of it to the other, over furniture and the carpet. Every available surface in chaos.
Her expression was quizzical, as though she couldn’t quite believe the civility of their exchanges these days.
Leandra found Harry in the old greenhouse, staring glumly at bags of blood and bone. Gaps in the framework, covered in clear plastic, indicated where glass panels had broken over the years. Inside, it still smelled of mulch and plant decay, though the last few months of tidying had cleaned up the benches and rows of cuttings very well.
“That doesn’t mean he’s well,” said Giles heavily. “He’s reminding me of Mycroft. After Euros died.”
They kissed, slow and sensuous. John slipped his arms around Sherlock’s waist. He plucked Sherlock’s shirt out of his waistband and rubbed his fingers along Sherlock’s ribs. One hand went up his smooth back.
“Hey, little flower,” said Harry. “Don’t cry. That’s it. Have a cuddle. Auntie Harry will change your nappy, and we’ll find that floppy bunny you like to chew on while your dad gets a bottle, eh? Eh little flower? Hmm?”
“Someone tried to burn me to death and frame me for murder, and I finally grew the fuck up. It was a long time coming, Johnnie. Now it’s your turn.”
“I don’t want to see you,” she said again. She turned her back on her neighbours, who were as ruined as the rest of them, and stumbled. Harry put an arm cautiously around Leandra, ready for rejection, but the older woman seemed grateful for the support.
Mrs Hudson, a voluminous bag in one hand, took John’s elbow; Sherlock took Mycroft’s, and Mycroft’s driver/bodyguard followed a few paces behind. The short distance to Regent’s Park still tired him, so they didn’t make it as far as the English Gardens, but they found a seat by the boating lake.
Mr Holmes found himself looking into the clear brown eyes of his eldest son in law. The shoemaker. Greg Lestrade, brought over by a quiet word from Dimitri Panopoulas.
“Nah, it’s good. I'm already covered in snot, and I’ve been shat on by babies before when I was little. John in a nappy was a terror. He was worse later when he could walk. He’d kick it off and go running around the house with a bare arse trying to climb all the furniture. I’m not sure he’s changed that much.” She said this just as they reached the flat.
'Here.' John picked up the empty box and held it against Sherlock's ear. Then he bent close, his breath warm and thrilling against Sherlock's skin. 'I told the box a secret,' he said, almost too soft to hear. 'Listen closely. The remnants might still be there.'
And just like that, John turned and ran, stumbling the few steps to Sherlock, not just falling but throwing himself at Sherlock, throwing his arms around him, “
up there. And when that bitch Kate or Emelia or the fuck framed me to murder people including my own prick of a dad, it was because I was so soaked all the time that it was easy to use me. I was scared I’d actually
John Watson-Holmes’s handshake was firm but not overbearing.  A good handshake.  “Call me Sherrinford.”
“I’ve just been earnestly told that kissing me is like being attacked by an unusually wet and aggressive tea towel.”
In the aftermath of the truth, new friendships are cemented; lovers reconnect; and a family grows toward a better future.
“It’s too late, Howie,” said John Garrideb, turning, ashen face streaked in tears, “They know. I told them everything.”
“Yeah. It’s not his head that’s the problem, exactly. But Mycroft doesn't know the first fucking thing about engaging Sherlock’s feelings. I'm a first class fuckup and even I know that much. ”
Pale alabaster, the stone over Richard’s grave was simply carved. The natural flaw running through it – a darker line, a crack like that which a sword had made in his thigh – was kinder than the flaws in the man had been. Sherlock’s hand trembled as he traced the line of the break with his fingertips; ran them across the edge of the cold stone.
Greg handed the glass and a clean silk handkerchief to Mycroft before taking on his own best man duties.
After the speeches, Phas and their part-timer Finn and his boyfriend Poe all worked like troopers at the counter.  Leia, Luke, Han and Chewie were all there, lending moral support.
This new incarnation (new reincarnation) was both familiar and strange. The detective and his chronicler yet brought justice to a troubled world; were lovers yet; but in a reality where pregnancy was the domain of biology other than sex - and were soon to be parents.
Harry prodded at the blankets curled around Sherlock’s feet with the tip of her boot. “You sleeping out here?”
Mycroft swung out the bed, fell to the floor as he reached for the wheelchair parked just out of reach, but John didn’t stay to help.
Mycroft’s mouth tilted up in a wry smile. “It will be rather good. Make sure you capture the moment to share on social media.”
Harry finished her cigarette, dropped the butt and stubbed it out with the toe of her shoe. She waited for the shakes to pass, and knew that the urge to drink wouldn’t.
“Yes. She’d lost her accent by the time Mycroft was born. She adored them, but she hated having to stay at home. She went back to work as soon as she could after they were born. She said. She always said. They would be happier with a happy mother that worked, than an unhappy one on tap at home.”
Harry handed over the whole pack of cigarettes. Mycroft shook out the contents, handed them back to Harry, and split the box open to make a flat surface. With a pen from his top pocket, Mycroft wrote a few lines in it and folded it up again.
“You grew up here?” John asked, standing outside the motor home, Rosie in his arms as he turned in a slow circle.
Sherlock saw it coming – in the tension in Howie’s shoulders, and the shift of his leg; in the darting of his desperate gaze and the uneven weight in the pocket of his coat, and how the coat bunched as his hand closed around the weapon.
“I believe it’s time for us to take the karaoke stand,” said Mycroft, rising and holding his hand out to Greg.
He handed her the cigarette and she pulled on it. “Fuck, that’s good.” She handed it back to him, and while he took another drag on it, she asked, “Has Captain Cutecheeks been by?”
“I don’t need a dog, I’ve got John,” said Sherlock absently, still cheerfully fussing the animal, who wagged his tail in appreciation.
The tall, lanky dude with a feral beard and hair to his butt grinned toothily at her. His work shirt was black stretch cotton, the name SOLO TRANSPORT stitched on the left breast in light blue with a tan coloured falcon motif underneath it.
Harry withdrew, grinning, laughing at herself and her soggy eyes as she drew her sleeve across them. Leandra gave her a tissue and she blew her nose.
Rosie cried and coughed and a bubble of mucus formed, grew and deflated before he could get to it. He wiped again and kissed her warm forehead.
“We didn’t know if we should sell it at the time,” said Giles, “So it’s been sitting there, costing us in taxes and doing precious little else, except as an agistment for the neighbour’s herd of Red Poll. Nice cows, Red Poll. Very calm. Tender, their owner says.”
Holding hands, delighted with each other and the world, Mr and Mr Watson-Holmes allowed their groomsmen to lead them back to the party.
Harry passed Rosie into Molly’s arms. She gathered up the Backup Baby Bag – there was one at Baker Street as well, containing spare nappies, a change of clothes, a baby sling, a blanket,  baby wipes and half a dozen little thing that her parents had tucked inside, ready against any sudden need.
Theresa was laughing with delight at how pink his ears were (she’d just said what nice eyes he had). She had a smudge of ice cream on her top lip (they’d been walking by the Seine and he’d remembered she liked a scoop of berry sorbet on top of a scoop of chocolate, in that precise order). She wore flat shoes, not because he was short but because heels made her feet hurt.
“She’s still your sister,” said Leandra softly. At Harry’s frown, she continued. “Eurus is my daughter. I am her mother. She’s dead, but she’s still with me. We still belong to each other, Eurus and I. Mary is gone, but she’s still your sister, just as much as John is your brother, if you want her to be.”
“She needn’t have died,” Mycroft cried out feverishly, crawling towards John Garrideb as Garrideb backed away in horror. “You should have come to me. I was
Giles stared at them a moment before he dropped his gaze. “Well. That's what your foolish old man thinks, anyway.”
“It’s hard to make out now,” said Sherlock, voice calm but carrying. “But a name was engraved on the handle. James Winter.”
“We are doing this,” said Sherlock. He stepped off the sofa, then while John budged up he wriggled to sit behind him and Rosie. They breathed together for a long while, watching Rosie being captivated by her own kicking feet. Loving each other, and their daughter, as hard as they knew how.
John’s vow was less floridly spoken. He was the kind of man to demonstrate more than say, and so he made coffee and made art and made love to express that love.
He remembered whispering into the pool of his own blood: “Beloved, oh my Khan, my prince. I will find thee.  I will pay whatever price is asked, and purge myself of hate, if fate will let me come to thee. I will find thee, my love, I will, I will, I will. Oh please, my starlit prince, my only joy, my hope, let me find thee.”
“Haven’t the foggiest.” Harry pulled out another cigarette, lit it, took a long drag, then passed this one to Mycroft as well. He took it and filled his lungs. “I don’t suppose you want the ra-ra talk from me, and I’m lousy at them anyway. Fuck that shit. Fuck that plastic leg. Fuck all the things, Mycroft. Tell you what though, I’m just about done with that peg leg of yours.”
“Congratulations darling. Your father and I are very proud of you. But you know, it’s never a good idea to have an affair with your colleague.”
Despite his clenched fists, Harry could see the tremor in his left hand. She hadn’t seen that since after he’d left the army hospital. It had vanished after John had moved into Baker Street with Sherlock. It had returned briefly after Sherlock had jumped from the rooftop. Pretended to jump.
Sherlock held his arm out behind him, surely uncomfortable with how it twisted his shoulder and spine. He flexed his fingers impatiently.
The child moved beneath their hands, in the vault of Richard’s small body, moving Khan to like tears. To distract from the rawness of his own heart, he asked his Richard, “Why do you weep, my prince?”
John’s fingers walked from Sherlock’s belly, over his sternum, up his throat to his lips. John’s thumb brushed firmly against Sherlock’s lower lip, before John bent to kiss him. As they kissed, John’s fingers slipped down over Sherlock’s throat again. He loosened Sherlock’s already loose tie, pulled it free, and then John flicked the tip of his tongue against Sherlock’s with every button he flicked open, from collar to hem, which he untucked with a slow drag, fingers against Sherlock’s belly.
'It's a daily present to myself to watch you deduce things. I love seeing your expression go from "what's this" to "elementary!" in 0.2 seconds.'
“I won’t feel it in at least one of them,” he asserted. The fit of the current prosthetic was excellent and he hadn’t been dancing in ages. “Besides, I should get into practice for the shag-hunting down the track.”
fucked off to the army but you came back. Not everyone goes, and maybe we don’t come back the same, but we’re here. Me and Molly and Rosie are fucking
Greg Lestrade has a secret. It’s such a secret secret, and so rarely and so randomly indulged, that he’s certain Sherlock hasn’t deduced it. He’s certain that even Mycroft doesn’t know, and usually, between those two brothers, they know everything. He’s even pretty sure they know the social niceties, though neither can ever be arsed to use them except as a tool or a weapon.
This was clearly the best game ever devised until… Rosie went quiet and still. She blinked a slow blink, then smiled a satisfied smile.
When Sherlock released the sheets so he could clasp John and pull him closer, John let him, and mouthed the now sodden silk more wantonly, then suddenly took Sherlock’s hands and pushed them up again. He grinned down at Sherlock and ground his hips down.
Molly’s voice preceded her into the room – “Sherlock, I got your text…” – but she fell silent as she entered. “Oh! Um.”
“Since when has love had anything to do with what we deserve? I should hope we all are loved beyond what we think we deserve. People are much harsher critics of themselves than any stranger could ever be. I think you deserve our love, Harry. You’re thoughtful and kind. Helpful and practical. It’s been wonderful having you around the house, and helping here. You make us laugh, and that’s never a gift to be taken lightly.  You have become a very dear friend to us, Harry, and we shall love you whether you think you deserve it or not.”
John and Sherlock had barely just arrived their hotel room for an exciting new case in Cambridge. A double murder to be exact --triple murder if you count the disappearance of a lab rat, as Sherlock pointed out. The victims were a chemistry student and med student girlfriend, killed in the former’s dorm room. Sherlock suspected an act of jealousy from one of their university colleagues. Mycroft suspected the replacement anatomy teacher. John did not know who to suspect.
. That was a first. But John ended up smiling. It actually was the sort of thing Sherlock would do, he loved getting John’s attention and would probably ache to see John cutting up a body. And that was weirdly sort of cute. He hoped nobody could see him blush.
“Now you’re being voluntarily obtuse John! Because of Sandra! Sandra needs to know we are her allies so we can get close to her and catch her!”
“Oh, Sherlock… No, no, no. You’ve been so brave. It’s over now, you’re here with me. That’s it let it out… Shhh…” John’s murmured into Sherlock’s ear as Sherlock was wrestling with his tears.
John let his words sink in, the effect on Sherlock’s expression made John’s heart melt. Sherlock gazed at John in wonder.
“John, you know we work better together. I need you to be there, you enhance my problem-solving skills by 35%, I can show you my Excel sheet outlining…”
John’s thumbs were stroking Sherlock’s cheeks, and jaw and neck before resting on into the sides of Sherlock’s face, his fingers entwined in dark curls.
Sherlock still hadn't figured out the whole case and was tired of having to maintain the facade of a relationship with John. That much was what John could gather. He did not understand the rest, and he loathed when Sherlock left him out of the loop.
“What if I don’t want to be safe? What if I joined you? You said so yourself, I enjoy Dangerous. Why did you keep it from me? Or did you want to be the Great Sherlock Holmes who does not need a faithful sidekick? ‘Alone protects me’ and all that shite?”
Unfortunately, Lestrade was around today. The strictest of his minders. John was strict with the drugs, but he had a soft spot for Sherlock’s antics, and was also ashamed of his behavior in the morgue. Mycroft might be strict with Sherlock, but he did not have the time to hang around babysitting and at least wasn’t dull. Mrs. Hudson sneaked herbal soothers in herself. Molly? Let me laugh.
John’s voice cracked at that last sentence. The tremor in his hand seemed to awaken from these kinds of emotionally fraught conversations.
“Has this body been autopsied? That does not follow regulations on full-body donation. How come?” John asked, keeping to a professional tone.
Sherlock smiled and took hold of John’s chair, leading him into his seat. John dazedly sat himself at the table.
“You mean – we…we will be sleeping in the… in the same bed?” Sherlock stuttered, “And… see each other first thing? When we wake up?”
Sherlock had dismissed her as preposterous, dim-witted like the rest of them. She did not even have the added excitement of being a criminal like John’s other therapist. How could he make himself better, if not for John? John was his conductor of light. Sherlock had died for him and would live for him. Sherlock had been prepared to go to see a pathetic therapist who did not even have a proper psychology degree if it meant saving his relationship with John. But when Ella had told him they could only make this work if he tried to focus on his own feelings, Sherlock had balked, left the room and did not return.
John was taken aback but then shook his head and chuckled, "I go through all that just so you could correct my geography? What happened to 'lost without my blogger'?”
John cleared the bleariness from his eyes and the soggy taste in his mouth. He hadn’t brushed his teeth.
He kissed John’s knuckles with a sincerity that took John’s breath away. John just nodded with a fond smile, feeling a tear push past his eyelashes. This was like a dream come true and John was enjoying every moment. The path to this point had been long, but had been worth. So, so worth it. He would never take anything for granted ever again. He would never want for more ever again, because he had everything he’d wanted. He felt luminously happy, blissful in a way he did not know was possible.
Sherlock stood still a few more seconds, before taking John’s hand. John could not help it, he enclosed both of Sherlock’s hands within his own. He then said what he knew Sherlock liked to hear.
So John was back from his social interaction of the day and had not spoken to Sherlock other than give a hi, preparing tea and drinking it in silence from his chair. Sherlock observed him in equal silence.
Their act had hindered their own investigation, which meant that Sherlock was not at the top of his game. As his brother Mycroft often said for no reason: he was getting sloppy. John did not know what it meant, but that made his worry for Sherlock intensify ten-fold. What was going on? Sherlock had to have a plan. Unfortunately he never let John in on those clever plans…
Culverton Smith, the most abject of criminals, confessed to his victims because he enjoyed the thrilling and liberating power of confessing. Maybe John was as just as low and disgusting as Culverton. Like the final fly Jesus saw as he died on the cross. John shivered at this. Comparing Sherlock to a religious figure he was confessing to felt in no way empowering to John though, so he must have retained some sort of moral spine. After all, Culverton had no remorseful regrets while John had many.
He knew of several things that made John happy or at least content. He vowed to contribute to John’s wellbeing. He now did the groceries for example. He was not always very skilled in his new pursuits (
What for some might seem like avoiding his responsibilities was actually the best and more responsible thing he could do in his situation. He had agreed with Ella to take a break from casework, try to return to a semblance of normality in order to work on his long list of issues. And he had to remind himself to be proud of his decision.
Sherlock called after him: “Don’t be an idiot! That was rather the point, you know! We need to sleep in the same room in order to catch the killer!”
“Then you can write it off in a clarification on your blog. It doesn’t mean anything and won’t affect our professional image,” Sherlock replied cooly, “Besides, I think the reverse can be true. The amount of readers, and therefore clients, might surge!”
The fantasies had started as fond smiles, maybe holding Sherlock’s hand…which was already pretty damning. But the fantasies had lately gotten more and more violent to the point of becoming nightmares. Violent beatings, hitting him right on his sinful mouth, twisting his arm back like a criminal, raw brutal in no way consensual sex… He was a terrible man. He was definitely going to hell for this. He hated himself for it.
Ok I couldn't resist having Sherlock helping a gay couple ! I'm sorry for making Cynthia and Maria have zero descriptions but i imagine Cynthia as the more soft-spoken and sensitive while Maria is more boisterous. You can imagine them how you'd like.
The sheet was soft and silky, which made John think of Sherlock’s dressing gown he was without a doubt slipping on behind that bathroom door. How could a uni bedroom have such pristine sheets? Why was the smell of Sherlock’s aftershave overwhelm him so? John groaned. Oh, of course Sherlock had brought his own sheets, the posh git. John rolled his eyes and fiddled with his outdated phone, pretending to do something useful.
But Sherlock had decided to sleep on. With his extremities laced with John’s. It was strangely comforting to touch another warm body in the cold. Of course he wished to be back in bed with Mary, where things were more wholesome and loving and less complicated. But sharing a bed with Sherlock was so soothing. And were he not about to get married he might have considered enjoying it… But Watsons were loyal. He should not even be thinking of the alternatives, of what ifs, lovely visions of how things could be. He was about to become the happiest man alive with Mary. And there was no “buts”. Of course he would.
“Sherlock, do come in! Your man is doing some great work!” Cynthia exclaimed over her shoulder at Sherlock.
Sherlock despised being monitored like a child due to his “drug habit” as Mycroft called it. Everyone he trusted (which wasn’t many people) were taking turns keeping him company and watching him while he sobered up.
“John I had to do what I did, Moriarty had snipers who would have shot you, Mrs Hudson and Lestrade, had I not died publicly as I did. As it kept you alive and safe, I cannot apologize for it. However, I’m sorry and deeply regret causing you grief,” Sherlock said with a penitent look away from John.
“The things I do for you, you daft berk,” John conceded with rolling eyes, shoving Sherlock’s shoulder playfully.
They reached the train platform just in time after being delayed by several rounds of kissing (thoroughly fascinating John!). They had a booth themselves.
“Cigarette burns. Sleep deprivation. Hit me with a crowbar and broke a few ribs,” Sherlock promptly replied.
John leant forward and pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s forehead. Sherlock blushed to his most handsome shade.
"Oh but Mary is interesting John, unlike your previous women. And besides, don't take it personally, I doubt I'd enjoy any kind of wedding celebration"
“When I said I was okay to pretend to be in a relationship with you, I meant sharing food at dinner and possibly holding hands, not sharing a bed with my flatmate!” John exclaimed, throwing his hands up in the air. He turned around, stomped into the bathroom, and slammed the door behind him.
“I want to, John. I want you to see,” Sherlock told him earnestly, “To see me,” Sherlock added in a whisper.
“Mrs Jones? Cynthia?” John addressed the student closest to his desk, “Could you check what that last text said? I think it’s rather important.”
The issues John and Sherlock face are far more complex and deeper rooted than I thought. I hope they make it out of this as better men, but I'm just writing as I go.
John had fallen asleep on the bed but had woken up due to a particularly loud boom of thunder. The television was on mute and the static electricity in the room had been the only noise until then.
So he had agreed to what they had said without thinking of the consequences. Great, one more opportunity to fuck this all up.
John grunted and stood up. Alright. Time to be a soldier. He felt as though he’d been sent on a suicide mission. He changed quickly into his pajamas and brushed his teeth. He checked himself in the mirror and tried to smooth out the crease of worry between his eyebrows. Finally he grabbed the door handle and stepped out into the bedroom. Sherlock was standing awkwardly by the door and swiftly fled to the loo once john was out. John decided it was better to wait for Sherlock to choose the side of the bed and sat down on the short edge.
“Your phone is your heart, you usually keep it hidden. Your phone is old and used. Mary doesn’t have access to the deepest parts of it. You are letting me see more than you are willing to show her. You should have been rattled to hear what I told you tonight, and any normal person would have waited until morning for this conversation. But as we know, you are addicted to danger. Your gaze is steady right now, even as your breathing is quicker,” Sherlock explained while taking his wrist, “And your pulse is elevated. You find this exciting. Your eyes –”
John hummed an affirmative. The light switch went off with a little click! and Sherlock shuffled around the covers. John stared at the ceiling, waiting. After a while John turned his head and realized the detective had fallen asleep.
“The anatomy teacher is involved, and she would either be an accomplice or an object of jealousy or she could even be the murderer herself. There are many options. Once you’re removed the impossible…”
John sat himself down in one of the armchairs, bowed his head. Took a deep breath. No doubt had he been to his therapist Ella Thomson this week and learnt some coping techniques.
“Sherlock! Hey…” John was waving a hand in front of Sherlock’s eyes, seemingly having tried to get his attention for a minute or more, “You okay?”
Sherlock was in danger, but John was also in danger. Both of them were with a killer. John decided he had to stay put as Sherlock was on his way to him. He would just need to be extra on guard.
Sherlock pulled out his laptop and plopped himself on the large bed to start researching the Nobel ceremony attendees. This case was interesting from the prestige behind the suspects. Everybody was there for a reason, be it wealth of power, wealth of intelligence or… wealth alone. Sometimes intelligence could translate to cleverness, sometimes not at all. Sherlock rolled his eyes. He really hoped they were clever.
sorry for the long hiatus, i basically graduated and have been working as a junior doctor. I'm volontarily unemeployed now to avoid covid so i took up writing again! I've been writing another more psychological fic, but it is good to come back to something slightly lighter :)
He looked very young in his sleep. Even younger than he was when they first met and during A Study in Pink. It seemed like all his worries and façade had faded away. John wished he could sleep that easy tonight.
Yes, this was only a temporary case, he would just have to play the part a little while longer...and sleep in the same bed as Sherlock. John lifted his head up and took a deep breath.
“Well it does stop me now, as I’m supposed to go on a dinner date with you this evening and have few dry-cleaned shirts left,” Sherlock said, flicking a speck of dust from his hoodie.
Hey I hope you liked this! I'm a bit disappointed I could not get deeper, I kind of triggered myself writing this.
“I should not have done that. You are worth more than this shit I gave you. I’m terribly, terribly sorry.” John said this in a subdued voice.
This had all gone very well, they had been welcomed at the university and Mary had allowed John to leave before the wedding preparations. There was just the slight problem of sleeping arrangements.
At the same time, Sherlock was not blameless. He’d made himself be dead for two years, probably laughing in John’s face. Laughing at how pathetic John was for being dull and ordinary. For grieving him like an actual human being.
Once Sherlock got himself under some control, he seemed to wake up to the fact to everything that had just happened and recoiled from John’s touch. He had put on his dressing gown he’d brought from home and was looking less vulnerable. John wanted to touch the scars, kiss them away, but he knew Sherlock would not welcome any touching in this state.
John and Sherlock laughed together and John threw his arm around Sherlock’s shoulders. They were holding each other in some sort of side-hug, with their bodies touching from shoulders to knees. It was amazing to be so close, the air between them was electric.
“I couldn’t – couldn’t… I had to be quiet… So quiet, John… Not a word… It hurt – so much… But they couldn’t touch you, I would never – never let them…” Sherlock said desperately labouring through his words.
“Yeah that would have been a shitty wedding if you told me that while I married someone else! I wouldn’t have been able to resist kissing you on the lips there in front of everyone at the reception,” John himself burst into a fit of giggles.
Sandra worked at the morgue part-time, which was where she met Alicia. Alicia and Sandra broke up for a squabble and George planting the idea of murder in her head. He was happy she was not pursuing a same-sex relationship anymore. She committed the murder by poisoning the ex and her boyfriend in the medical lab facility. It looked like an experiment gone wrong.
“You have a tracheotomy tube, right here on your left,” his teacher replied, pointing towards a platter with different tubes and syringes.
John looked rather grumpy in his puffy coat at the back of the cab. John had resisted any attempts of Sherlock to dress him up and had been incensed when he caught Sherlock looking up tailors online (he had deduced John’s measurements after all). Sherlock knew his Belstaff would blend in nicely with the minimalist Swedish fashion. John could be fashionable, in his own understated way, but lacked the sense of class that mingling with the elites would require. Undoubtably scientists were rarely known for their sense of fashion, but being invited to a prestigious award ceremony required a particular attention to appearance John would be uneasy with. Sherlock had bought the suit.
“O-kay… but why was it so important we kiss?” John’s cheek was burning from the contact. He felt slapped rather than kissed. He’d imagined kissing Sherlock in many scenarios and this was disappointing in comparison, but he’d have to accept this was the best he was going to get.
“Sherlock, let's take you home,” John spoke with a voice he meant to be no-nonsense, but ended up quite hesitant and weak.
Of course Sherlock understood what he’d meant and what John wanted to do to them. These faceless men who had done this, these bastards who had hurt Sherlock so badly he had decided to keep it from John.
This was like the good old times, where they could always count on post-case take-away and toes in the fridge. John couldn’t wait, post-case was when Sherlock was at his most mellow and everything seemed right in their little bubble.
Mycroft left the question without an answer. Mycroft knew that underneath the rage, John Watson had a sound mind and good heart. Comparisons to an alcoholic abusive father were not only far from the truth, they were also unhelpful in this situation.
Sherlock nibbled at some prawn crackers John had bought for him. The sight warmed John up a bit on the inside. He’d been so scared of losing Sherlock this evening.
“And since we are getting reimbursed for part of the course now that we have no teacher, we thought we should spend the money on something worthwhile,” added Maria with a grin.
“All right ladies and gentlemen, please calm down. I need to make some introductions first.” George made an exaggerated wink at the class. That earned him some laughs.
“I’d say it was most efficient. You will now be able to move back to Baker Street directly and without hesitation,” Sherlock concluded.
Sorry about the explicit nature of last chapter. This is not a rape recovery fic. I've had a similar talk about trauma with a friend lately and this was therapeutic for me. My intention was not to dismiss or cheapen the story of any survivor of rape or abuse. I just found it unfortunately very plausible given the insistence surrounding Sherlock's virginity on the show and Moriarty would definitely use his pressure points.
And his lips were were so plush, just like his deep voice. Would Sherlock notice if he softly pressed his own lips to his?
“George left. Sherlock and Maria comforted me as I was a bit shaken. But it gave me hope, that he protected us. That we were worth something and not alone. So I want to thank you Sherlock Holmes for your bravery,” Sherlock bowed his head, “And I also want to thank you John Watson. For being there for him. You’re the one who put such fire in his eyes. And that alone is an inspiration to continue to love the woman I love, despite the challenges the world throws at us.” Cynthia ended her story teary-eyed.
“She’s our anatomy teacher’s current girlfriend, and who is cheating on him with that woman by the bar.”
“But that is even better! It will be even more interesting to watch somebody with expertise demonstrate how it should be done!”
He suddenly felt a wave of anger towards Sherlock for…for corrupting him like this. For thwarting his resolve to be a good respectable man. The posh junkie would be the death of him someday. It was shameful, the thoughts that came to mind when he thought of Sherlock.
John snorted. He knew that was a distinctly not-good reaction, but he couldn’t help himself. Sherlock had decided to fake his suicide to have a glorious bit of fun playing puzzles with Moriarty’s web, leaving John to grieve and feel like an empty husk.
“You freak! What did you do to Sandra! Answer me!” shouted George. He had a knife in his hand, pointing it towards Sherlock.
“Oh god, I have to reach him! I’m sorry for all this, but I need to go now!” John shouted out, pulling on his coat.
It had gone 26 hours since John had stormed out the door of 221B, surely he had gone back to Mary’s to cool off and gone to work today.
The kiss was so simple yet so tender, John forgot how to breathe, how to think. When the kiss broke, Sherlock moved his lips in for another. And another. And another. And John moved in for one more. The years of longing would to the casual observer go unnoticed, but it was there, all-consuming, lighting a flame between them that could never be extinguished.
John groaned, his phone was in his jacket by his desk. He’d had to leave it behind when putting on his protective gear. Once the buzzing stopped his phone pinged. Sherlock never called, he texted. And nobody else ever contacted John. That meant Sherlock was in danger! John drew down his face mask.
“Sherlock is actually my boyfriend and he wrote that as code to tell me he wants to watch me in action. He will come bursting in here at any moment,” John blurted out. It was the most plausible thing his mind could supply.
Sherlock was making scrambled eggs for John. He wanted to surprise John this morning, after yesterday’s mistake. John had been through so much pain and Sherlock hoped to cheer him up. It was a stupid, idiotic thought, but he was desperate. John was right to be angry, he too was going insane at the way things were. The only difference is that John was angry at him, and Sherlock could never be angry at John. He knew he had let John down, but he was working hard to make up for it. Yesterday had been a massive slip-up, he should not have questioned John’s decisions he made together with his therapist. He just wished John had not inadvertently hurt himself by punching that wall.
“Please John, calm down. I did not want to compromise your engagement so I went to her first, she took it very calmly and said it might do you some good to take you on a case. She can handle the wedding preparations and knows you are neither gay nor interested in me in any shape or form,” Sherlock pleaded.
“Yes, well now with her gone and out of the way, we can focus on more important matters! We can go on cases again! Chase some criminals! Where is my blogger when I need him? I know you still have the Sig in your bedside drawer. Not very wise of you, considering a child was sleeping there mere days ago, but it just goes to show you like danger and need some excitement!”
John tried to scan the room looking for clues, like Sherlock taught him. He was shite at this, but damn if he didn’t try. Then he spotted the anatomy teacher sitting alone at a booth. He seemed angry. He probably had witnessed the glass shatter situation and concluded that blonde waitress and Sherlock were banging or something. Which was ridiculous, Sherlock was gay. Or at least for this case he was acting like he had a boyfriend. Who knew what Sherlock really was….
John then realized that meant Sherlock was willing to give up a case if John ruined it. That would not do. He had to get over himself. People had died. He could not permit more deaths. Without them there would be no justice for Sandra or her victims.
John tried to stay engaged but acting was proving rather difficult. Maria tried inviting him into the conversation by asking his medical opinion on something interesting, but John had to admit he wasn’t following which earned him a scoffing groan from Cynthia and an eyeroll from Sherlock.
Then he felt the pain shoot up his hand up towards his bad shoulder. It was like reaching the surface after plunging in icy cold water. Everything gradually sped up.
The voice in his head thundered. John was a much happier person before Everything. And Everything bad had happened because of Sherlock. He did not know how to fix this. John had not forgiven him. Maybe Sherlock was beyond forgiveness.
Sorry for the delay and short chapter, I had exams that I think I've failed, but oh well! Here is more of them pretending to be a couple for you guys :)
“John? John! John Look at me! Calm down, I did not mean any harm, I take it back if you want. You are right, I have no right to impose. I have made you some tea, sit down. Please?” He looked nervous, fiddling with his cuffs.
So this is how he came to decide to make breakfast in bed. He hoped John would enjoy it, even though breakfast was a rather pedestrian routine.
“Sherlock, did they do anything else besides whipping?” John knew this maybe was not the most pressing question as Sherlock was in so much pain already, but it was something he had to ask before they could go further.
Sherlock had stood up, with his hands clasped in front of him. He looked very young, and very out of place. His eyes looked unsure and he was biting his bottom lip.
Sherlock looked pleased, but still slightly unsure: “Thank you John. You know how invaluable you are to my work. You will need to meet George as your anatomy teacher, will that be okay? He might not take it well that you fought him.”
He opened his eyes. Sherlock’s eyes were mesmerizing, a sea of blue with a constellation of islands and lagoons. They looked sorrowful, but not –as John had feared—pitying.
The heavy doors swung shut behind him with a loud thud. Sherlock looked a mess, his hair in disarray, his breath quick. His coat flapped behind him as the doors closed.
“These past few years haven’t been easy on me -- but you know that of course. You jumped off the bloody hospital roof first off and left me to grieve for two years.
“I’m in my mid-twenties, you’re in your early thirties. The story is that I met you at the lab and you tutored me a bit during med school. I admired your knowledge and practical nature while you found my bright mind and quirks endearing. We are in love and do not care about ages. Now you’ve done your foundation years and are learning first aid and traumatology here.”
“All right, I’m just wondering just how public our marriage is going to be, seeing as we are so central and we are hardly anonymous anymore. What if my fake wedding to you gets leaked in the press? What then?”
John had gained several pounds, but this did not serve to make him look healthy, on the contrary he looked tired and weak. John had large bags under his eyes and had not slept in a while despite his comfortable bed and fiancée. Sherlock hoped it was not nightmares again.
Sherlock had of course run off and John ran out on the pavement but to no avail. It was pouring and John went back in the restaurant with damp hair, sending a text to Sherlock.
John was both irritated at the disturbance and feeling a wave of affection bloom in his chest. This man was going to kill him one day. Between dangerous cases, faking his death and his quirky lifestyle, Sherlock had turned his life around, both good and bad.
“A pleasure to meet you, Mister Watson, Sherlock has been talking about your medical expertise quite a bit,” the professor said.
“I was going to tell you now, you needn’t change your clothes as you’re not in lab today. You are playing an older medical student and do not usually wear suits anyway since you wear scrubs at the hospital,” Sherlock explained.
“If I help you with this, you must promise to apologize to my brother. He has not heard an apology from you for nearly beating him to death and is rightfully upset at that,” Mycroft’s said with a frown and tight lips, “Now who will be the lucky parents?”
John nodded. He knew Alicia had been a medical student and probably had consented to donate her body to science, however she had not consented to being murdered by her own teacher and her ex. They’d probably worked together on this. He wished Sherlock was there to do some deductions.
After a few moments of silence, John pulled Sherlock’s hand from it’s stop position to rest lightly with his own on the window ledge. Their fingers intertwined effortlessly.
Good thing Sherlock had not touched him, it was Lessons on PTSD 101 to not touch a soldier in the midst of a nightmare. But John very much craved his touch right now. For reassurance, for comfort. For belonging.
"Sherlock knew talking was not their best point, and John had performed admirably. It was brilliant. John was brilliant. He had restored order and peace in the universe."
“Erm—hello?” John replied, overwhelmed. Sherlock was still flitting and twirling in the kitchen making tea, as if performing some intricate dance where only he could hear the music.
Sherlock seemed to break out of his trance and took John’s hand into both of his and brought it to his lips. He started earnestly kissing John’s knuckles.
At breakfast, John and Sherlock sat opposite each other at a long cafeteria table. Sherlock blended right in with the students, hunched over in his hoodie. John felt very old suddenly surrounded by these youths.
Cynthia said she’d been telling him about meeting Maria for the first time, and the patient they had worked with together on that first meeting at work.
John just sat, fully clad, on the toilet seat. He crossed his arms and scrunched his eyes shut. What a nightmare. He pinched the bridge of his nose with his left hand.
He realized all he had done so far was give a list of grievances rather than actually apologize. Why was this so hard? Sherlock seemed to have put on his carefully neutral mask he wore when he did not want to reveal he had emotions too.
The body was wheeled into the anatomy theater. George went through the basics of keeping an airway open and the indications for the surgery.
John seemed to sense that Sherlock was feeling sorry for their fight because instead of snapping, he walked over to his chair and lowered his head. John clasped his hands in front of him and closed his eyes. He took a breath and started talking.
John was positive Sherlock wanted to gouge her eyes out, but Sherlock was smiling a smile that looked alarmingly sincere. Did Sherlock see something in her he did not? Cynthia got herself under control and went back to looking like competent doctor. The quick change from awkward fangirl to professional anesthesiologist was baffling.
John lay still as a ramrod next to Sherlock. How the hell would he fall asleep? After what felt like an eternity, Sherlock asked: “Should I turn the light off?”
They had both been through a lot and the distance between him and Sherlock sometimes felt impossible to cross, but John was proud that he had made a tentative first step in the right direction. He realized they were both staring at each other’s faces, so he coughed to clear his throat and walked toward the kitchen to make tea. Tea was always a good stand-in for normalcy in this flat.
Sherlock smiled that very rare smile that seemed reserved for John. John did not know how he was worthy of that honor of his special place in Sherlock Holmes’s life, but he thanked his lucky stars every day for it.
Sherlock had his mouth open in shock. This was the face John had privately nicknamed the “drama queen face” because it was precisely that. He turned on the overhead light. Sherlock took a few moments before composing himself and directing a piercing eye stare, mentally cataloguing John’s countenance.
Thankfully, Sherlock had thought to text John where he was. That was incredibly smart and brave of him, and John told him so. Sherlock replied with a non-committal grunt.
There was a moment of silence where Sherlock and John just stared at each other, breathless from the stream of deductions. Just when Sherlock looked about to get embarrassed for possibly hurting John's pride, John smiled.
He decided sleep was the best medicine for the heartache gnawing at his insides. As Sherlock said, he could do the acting in the morning. With all his willpower, he turned around and to reluctantly face away from Sherlock and towards the door. Yes, he would endure crunching his bad shoulder into the mattress if it meant saving his honor. That was the only thing he was good at these days, being a soldier. Even if that particular war that only existed in his head.
Then he shrugged, because a) Sherlock had been known to put much worse things in his mouth than baby mucus and b) when your little one couldn’t breathe (
John raised himself up on his knees briefly, so that he could pull Sherlock’s trousers down to his thighs. The white lingerie was cut high, showing off Sherlock’s lean thighs. The cloth bulged with Sherlock’s tightening balls, with the line of his thick erection.
“Shh, love.” John swept up Sherlock’s sorrow with his thumbs, his palms. He soft-kissed his prince. He drew his beloved close, and down, until they knelt on the sweet grass together.
“Well, of course I do. I’m talking to ghosts.” He closed his eyes. “Have you ever wondered whether the whole of the ocean floor is covered in oysters? They’re so prolific. What would stop them overrunning the world?”
“Bark orders as much as you like, Sherlock, I shan’t listen to a one unless you stand to deliver them over this pestilent rock that smashed our boat.”
“Come in.” John’s voice held a slightly strained pitch. Greg darted inside and closed the door behind him.
Inspired by conversations with Winklepicker, Atlin and A Secret Scribbler. Then Winklepicker said "what if he did take her current favourite unknowingly and then ran back with it right in the middle of an improtant case because Rosie is more important."
Sherlock snorted again, but he was grinning too, his shoulder pressed against John’s. John, laughing, raised Sherlock’s hand to kiss his knuckles, moustache brushing over the skin.
John fell asleep in a chair beside Sherlock’s bed, still holding his hand. Harry sent photos periodically throughout the night, whenever Rosie woke up but also several of her asleep in her cot by John's bed.
They were at fourteen kinds of kiss when a door banged open and Phillip distinctly heard his sister Wendy yelling,
Sherlock didn’t look up. “Not hungry, Hudders. Can’t spare the energy for digestion. If I don’t work this out… Did you hear that? Upstairs? No. Probably just Mary settling Little Watson down. Or. No. well, obviously not. Memory plays tricks. The bastard.”
Sherlock didn’t see a single one of them. He didn’t even see Greg, standing beside John in front of them all.
And he chose Sherlock: first, last, always. He chose Sherlock for his strength and grace; for his kindness and courage; for his intensity of love and generosity of soul; for Sherlock’s own choice to be a force for good in this suffering world.
A poppa on one side, a daddy on the other, Rosemund Watson-Holmes-Morstan drew awhile and it didn't take a poppa, a daddy, or a genius to see that her stick figure was wearing cape and crown, spindly wrists wrapped in bracelets, feet hiked up in high heels. And, though no parent wants their child to accept limits put on her by strangers with no right to grant privileges they themselves have taken away, neither did John want he or Sherlock denying their daughter the privilege to
Count the second: These two are not inclined toward enthusiasms so much as passions. Or not really passions so much as manias. This is to say that Sherlock and his daughter Rosie go absolutely bug-fuck for things they love.
Rosie Holmes-Watson has been…'enthusiastic'…about everything from footwear to flat worms and before you think her strange, recall that she's the daughter of a man who thinks a bowl of fresh intestines is a sweet gift, and also the daughter of the man who fell in love with that man the day he met him.
a_secret_scribbler, AtlinMerrick, Winklepicker and I haven't set it within any particular continuity or AU. It's just Daddy and Papa and Little Watson, an awful lot of baby-related fluids, and the occasional tantrum. Which is possibly even Rosie's.
Within was a folded square of cardboard from a cigarette packet – Harry’s brand. Sherlock unfolded it. He showed the short message, written in Mycroft’s hand, to John.
Two haunted men stir, wake to happy memory of a sunny day, a dog, a family. But she's still gone and they still grieve, and one or both of them may be losing their grip.
“The finest in all the seven seas,” John breathed and he leaned down to kiss him. He moved, with such sinuous grace, so that all of his limbs held his darling in his arms, and Sherlock flexed his powerful body to thrust them both further into the deeps, where they explored new ways to be everything to one another.
“I’m sorry,” he said. “I wasn’t. Fair. It wasn’t your fault. None of it was your fault.” He looked at the place where Mycroft’s lower leg used to be. “Don’t be stubborn about telling your doctors if the phantom pains continue. That’s your nerve endings not being able to tell the signals aren't going anywhere. There are drugs for that.”
Someone tried to make Mycroft leave. They only tried the once. Leandra, Giles and Greg ranged around his wheelchair, and not one of the four of them took their eyes off Sherlock and John.
And then there was the day that Rosie was screaming in her high chair, throwing mashed peach all over the floor, the table, her father, and herself,  and nothing could calm her down or make her desist.
On the third trope of Xmas my fanfic gave to me: canon Sherlock Holmes but John Watson runs a house of coffee...
A few years later, a little boy in love with everything Mars, Ford had learned her story. He pored over the images and sounds and streams of data she’d sent home to Earth, the eyes and ears and heart of the humans who followed her across an alien world.
“John, Sherlock’s in hospital, he needs you!” she’d blurted, and John had frozen and a look of terror had briefly flared in his eyes before fury took its place.
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John and lipped at his moustache, then tilted his head back so John could nuzzle his throat while John’s hands worked magic on his ever-hardening cock.
John the former angel, whose wings were lost, ran until his lungs burned. He hurtled up the mountain and burst onto the path leading to the ledge over the Falls in time to see Professor Moriarty overbalance from a blow and tilt – to see him reach out and snatch at Sherlock’s coat – to see him topple and to take Sherlock with him over the edge.
Harry heard Mycroft’s groaning ‘no’ and then heavy breathing and then nothing but a dozen light footsteps as the visitor left.
‘Same, same,’ said Sherlock, in a chin-up kind of tone. It made Molly laugh, reminding her that she and Sherlock had some things in common, still. Dead people humour, apparently.
So, you see. Sometimes John’s day is all about adrenalin and running around after his crazy mad man in a coat. Some days it’s all about fighting his daughter into her blue dress when she wants to wear the red one soaking in a bucket after the goose poo incident. And other days? Well, they’re all about the hair. And when he bemoans the fact that Sherlock, only a couple of years younger than him, hasn’t got one single grey hair on his head. Sherlock just leans over, buries his nose in John’s blonde and grey mop and mumbles “John, you’ve not got grey hairs, they’re just wisdom highlights.”
“I know so. Anyone who made you happy, he would have loved. You were like a brother to Bill. So that makes you my brother too, doesn’t it?”
“John…” Mycroft heard Sherlock’s dry throat, and wanted only to find the man who’d done that to his little brother and wring his neck until he was as red-faced, until he struggled for breath, until he stopped breathing at all…
Naturally, Sherlock – the drama queen, ignoring all the chaos – waved his hands and began demanding the foolish toy bear on his bedside cabinet. John, just as naturally going along with whatever lunatic nonsense Sherlock was carrying on with, snatched up the bear and threw it across the room to Lestrade – well, obviously, he wasn’t going to leave Sherlock’s side. Naturally.
But a case gainsays almost all other things, in the life of Sherlock Holmes and his John Watson, and thus they took themselves to that city of football and a dead king.
"I know it's only my subconscious mind in a dream. But. But it helps. To dream she said those things."
‘It has.’ Porthos placed a large, warm hand on Aramis’s bare chest. ‘I thought I was dreaming when the door opened.’
“John Watson. What can we say?” he said. “A man of impeccable style. A barista that other baristas strive and fail to emulate. A man of character, integrity, and expensive moustache wax.”
For a while they stood in contented seclusion, sharing the e-cigarette and listening to Rosie finish her tantrum while John and Sherlock sang to her. They could tell from her wild giggling that fathers, photographer, parents of the groom and best persons were all engaged in the task.
“Fickle little thing,” Molly laughed. She waggled her fingers at Rosie and tickled her tummy. Rosie cackled.
at this, including Sherlock. Same thing happens when she calls him papa. By the age of two she is also addressing him as Holmes. John Watson is of course daddy. And no matter how Sherlock tries—he's rather possessive of his endearment for his husband—Rosie still calls her daddy
“Yes.” Unequivocal, that, but then, “But… Mary brought us together. She was. She was the bridge. She made us
Tall, dark-haired. Hawkish nose and piercing grey eyes. Quite the handsomest man John had seen in a good long time. Most of the coffee shop’s customers in these lean days were a dull lot; either the old hands who had been coming since the long-past heyday; or lean young men who brought flasks of brandy to tip into their coffee and mutter about feckless schemes.
Mycroft is gazing at Greg’s face with a sense of wonder. It takes him a moment to reply. “No,” says Mycroft.
“I thought I’d take a walk to the village,” Sherlock said after the fourth boo-tickle. “Watson might enjoy the view, and I’d enjoy your company.”
Once in the house, tea was made and drunk. Rosie had calmed and been thoroughly checked by her fathers, proving she’d been no more than frightened by the sudden push to the ground, cradled as she had been between John and Harry.
He looked at Rosie, asleep in Harry’s arms. He carefully brushed toast crumbs from the soft little bee outfit Rosie wore. Organic cotton. Little golden bees all over it. Sherlock had bought it for her. Sherlock loved buying things for Rosie.
Sherlock’s strange books of almost two years ago were barely even a memory now. That concoction of fantasy and guilt, with a John and Mary and Sherlock who were hardly ever themselves, had been burned to ashes. They had this truth to teach to their daughter now. That her Daddy and her Papa had always been the very best of best friends. That they had both loved her Mama, who had loved them too, and the three of them had also been the very best of best friends. And when Mama died and had to leave, Rosie’s Daddy and her Papa had kept her mama’s love with them and became the best and most loving forever friends they knew how to be.
The day when a frightened nation showed their fear, their hope, their hearts, their thanks. As a soldier, John had never been thanked like this. Wouldn’t have wanted it. As a doctor who had fallen gravely ill while trying to help, he’d been modestly uncertain that he deserved it now.
John thought this was stupid. And dangerous. And stupid. That stupid man and his stupid ideas and his stupid lovely mouth and his stupid grey eyes looking at him like he was the most interesting thing he’d seen all night. Bloody stupid this was.
“That’s settled then,” said Sherlock. Sherlock bent to drop a kiss on John’s head, bent further to kiss Rosie’s head, and she grabbed him by the shirt, leaving pea-green fingerprints.
“You seem nice to me too, Caleb.” He let his gaze linger too. From gorgeous soft hair, to soft green eyes, to the pale column of throat and long, lean body to… well, surprisingly sturdy thighs.
‘This is very poor social distancing,’ said Mycroft mildly, but he was embracing Sherlock in return.
But there was something in that sharp blue gaze that did not speak of foppishness or fancy. Confidence was there, yes, and a surprising level of cool charisma.
She was tilted to one side and her camera tower was bent. Her solar arrays were scratched and pitted. One of her wheels was missing.
Harry clutched onto her brother and didn’t know what to say. She thought she was probably going to cry. She hated crying, especially where anyone could see. Then she thought, fuck it, and smooshed her face into his shoulder and sniffled. He patted her back. She smooshed harder, and then she laughed, pulling back with wet eyes.
“Oh, I’m all right. I don’t blame myself any more. But it’s so destructive, to hate yourself for things you didn’t do. It’s destructive even if you did them, to yourself, to the people who love you. So you read out an article not knowing the consequences. Perhaps next time you might be less impulsive. But your impulsiveness is part of why we care for you, you know. We all have moments when we wish we’d been more thoughtful or said something different.  We all have moments when, without even knowing how, we’ve said or done just the right thing. It’s all right. Be kinder to yourself.”
John was inside, changing Rosie. She lay on a mat on the narrow but sufficient double bed at the rear of the vehicle. She was cackle-giggling, kicking her bare legs in the air, while John tickled her tummy with a soft crocheted bunny.
Sherlock peeled back one end of the leather, showing it to be a case, the clip that had once held it closed rusted to nothing. He shook the object within it onto his palm.
“I’m okay,” Sherlock was saying hoarsely. “I took the needle out. Soon as the nurse was gone. A little dopey. I’m fine. I’m fine. He didn’t kill me.”
“That’s right, sweetheart,” laughed John.  Harry and Mycroft emerged to find John pointing at them. “Uncle My wants a fuddyguff.”
Sherlock gave John an amused grin, to which he replied with a raised eyebrow. “Come on then, let’s go see Uncle Greg and Uncle Mikey get wed. And don’t think I can’t see that clip in your hair Sherlock Holmes!”
Sherlock's fixations include studying cigarette ash, one hundred and fifty-two kinds at last count (now with tobacco from the Holy See, Malta, and Nauru). His wardrobe still houses the aftermath of Sherlock's blue scarf period, during which he bought thirty-eight scarves, every one in a subtly different shade of blue. And the less said in polite company about his ongoing fixation with flesh-eating beetles the better.
.”Mycroft stumbled again as he lurched towards John Garrideb, walking stick brandished, and he fell to his knees. The stick flew away into the grass beyond his reach and he struggled to rise, unable to get the prosthetic foot beneath him.
On the fourth trope of Xmas, my fanfic gave to me: two men fake dating and hiding from a wedding party.
Greg kissed Mycroft on the cheek, poured him another glass of champagne, then took his hand and kissed Mycroft’s fingers.
“They left that in Mrs H’s hands, and let’s just say that their passion for pavlova is something of an open secret that they think nobody else knows.”
Sherlock gently refolded and replaced the card in the tin, and placed the tin back where it belonged under the roots of the oak tree.
and Sherlock's delight in that preference, that there was always some sort of bee flip-flop in 221B the entire time Rosie was teething. That child chewed through more than three dozen pairs before John figured out that a great whacking hunk of hose pipe worked just as well and lasted a lot longer. Sherlock was crushed.
“Yeah, fuckit. I suppose I should give up smoking too, but then I’d lose the will to live completely. Speaking of which…”
“Mistakes.” He rooted through the papers for a photograph, peered at it and threw it aside. It was obvious he hadn’t shaved or washed in days; that he was living in this room, with a trail through the wreckage to the bathroom, but not the bedroom. Not upstairs, where John’s old room had become a spare room and temporary nursery for Rosie.
* Cataloging turbellaria, beginning of course with the parasitic but progressing to the marine flatworm, a passion about which she once spoke for three hours, never noticing John left the room six times to prepare dinner.
John turned, and Sherlock felt that inevitable yet still so surprising click of seeing that John looked at him with essentially the same smile, the same softness, that he gave to Rosie.
John entered the autopsy theatre with his fellow students. A lot of the doctor students were excited about this lesson as they wanted to hone their skills in cricothyrotomy, a life-saving emergency operation for extremely acute situations. This was why it was called the emergency airway puncture. Most students were doctors who worked in hospitals with access to more sophisticated equipment and medical competence. This was field work, which was why many very competent trauma doctors and surgeons had never performed this particular operation.
Sorry guys for not making it more Johnlock-y after such a long absence (more than a year!) but we need to get through this in order to get to the good stuff! Thank you for your support!
“Then Mr Sampler said something about how he doesn’t listen to someone who gets it up in the arse with a pathetic retired stump of a man and Sherlock told him he didn’t speak to anyone who fucks a girl 20 years younger than him. I’m guessing he meant Sandra? Anyway Mr Sampler then became furious and slapped him right in the face. Sherlock grabbed his hand, twisted it behind his back and hissed
His heart had already skipped a beat at dinner when Sherlock’s long fingers traced his own over the table at the canteen table over dinner. He did not wish to be carried away again. John was worried he would end up touching the detective while asleep and Sherlock would figure out --as he always does—that his relationship act was an actual desire on his part. Sherlock, who abhorred sentiment, would never look at him in the eye again. No, it was better he stayed to his side of the bed.
And his mind was not as reliable as it used to be, since his time away…He had not even seen Mary coming. He had done so much, endured so much for the safety and happiness of the man in front of him. John knew nothing of this and it was better it stayed that way. He’d been hurt, he’d been broken, he’d been tortured. He had killed. He had starved. He had even tortured his own torturers and enjoyed it at the time.
John savored the moment. Things were far from okay, but his friendship with Sherlock felt less like something irretrievable and more of something to strive for.
Both middle-aged women looked in awe at him, completely enraptured by his little speech. John was actually relieved to bask in their glow, it made his interminable wait for Sherlock more bearable. John had just made the incision when Sherlock arrived.
“How you manage to make such consistently perfect tea is beyond my intellectual capacity,” Sherlock abruptly said.
Everything hurt. He was aching for some morphine. That was enough to send him to rehab if he went back to Ella.
Sherlock found this new routine not much different to how his life was with John before the incident…Or rather before Everything. Before Culverton, before the Tarmac, before Mary’s death, before the Wedding…Before the Fall. The routine (black, two sugars) was the same, but that easy camaraderie was gone, lost. Not much had changed, yet everything had.
They laid his body among some empty bottles to look like he’d passed out drunk. They then scattered into the night.
That sentence was familiar. John felt his stomach churn, but Sherlock merely looked at John with questioning eyes as if to say “Not good?”. John shrugged it off and focused on Sherlock.
At least John had come back, Sherlock reminded himself. John was back with his warm oatmeal-coloured jumper and his comforting compact stance and his lovely scent of sandalwood and Earl grey tea. John had not forgotten him.
“Thanks to us yet another case is solved! Chinese? Italian didn’t go too well.” Sherlock said while quirking an eyebrow.
“You do not get to call him that!” John growled, “Sherlock he called you a freak, I will end him. I swear I will.”
“No, John. This is an apology for yesterday. I hope you can forgive me for making you angry. Besides John you know I don’t eat on cases,” Sherlock took a big bite of pancakes to prove his point.
The medical corps have different packs with equipment and John has a rudimentary one that includes a naso-pharyngeal tube (NPA) that you slip in the hole after the incision. Several TV shows like to make medics use empty ballpoint pens as the tube, but I don't think that is possible in real life.
Sherlock was taking ages in the shower. John had to turn on the small old tv to drown out the sounds of the water pouring down Sherlock’s body. God, that body! He tried to distract himself from his inappropriate thoughts by turning to a nature documentary about the life cycles of bees. Unfortunately, the closeups of pouring honey only reminded him of the lush shampoo running down Sherlock’s shoulders, his back, his hips, his legs… He ended up switching to a documentary about Victorian times, which was bleak and drab and hopefully unsexy. But even in the Romantic men of that time reminded him of Sherlock, with long limbs and soft pouts.
“I locked her in the morgue.” Sherlock pushed open the door from which Alicia’s body had been wheeled in to reveal Sandra gagged and tied up to a lab table.
Back to their dorm room, John demanded an explanation of what Sherlock had done in the courtyard before he came.
All the kudos and comments kept me going, even through a year long hiatus for med school. This was supposed to be a one-shot, which became 4 chapters, which became a 15k fic!
There was affection there in that smile, Sherlock saw, and it made his insides feel warm and soft like honey.
“I really appreciate your thanks, but I am merely doing my life’s work, which comprises of bringing criminals to justice and loving John Watson.”
John tackled George down with a well-placed punch to the nose and kick to his groin. But George was not brought down easily. George seized the scalpel from John’s hand and wildly slashed towards John. He cut John’s cheek. It started bleeding.
“John Watson, I cannot stress this enough. You may be able to get yourself out of caring for one child, but not for the other. The other being my brother Sherlock Holmes. He is a child in many ways to my dismay. He may not require a legal guardian, but he is in need of you as a partner. I will grant you your request, but you must promise to be gentle with him and be there for him.”
John could barely hear it, had he misheard? The softness in Sherlock’s voice made John’s heart skip a beat. John spun slowly around to find Sherlock eyes down, standing awkwardly with his hands fidgeting with the right sleeve of his dressing gown.
John felt a tremendous wave of despair and upset boiling through him. He did not make a sound, suffocating the sobs before they emerged. But he could not stop the tear forming out the corner of his eye. He felt it form, round and wet, pour down a streak on his cheek and drip a wet spot on his pillow. John’s last thoughts before he fell asleep were that at least Sherlock had not been awake to witness this moment of weakness.
"You thought of everything, you even put the hard pillow on the left side!" John exclaimed, trying to diffuse the tension.
“Can you tell us about what happened last time you performed this operation? You said you were on the field, what did you use then?” Dr Kelley enquired with a glow in her eyes.
The air needed to be cleared, despite the fact his heart ached for Sherlock. He did not know when Sherlock would be this open with his emotions again and had to grasp at this rare opportunity. The fact that they were supposed to leave Cambridge this evening made clear the urgency of resolving this now.
John finished his monologue with a little smile and a hint of pride. Sherlock knew talking was not their best point, and John had performed admirably. It was brilliant. John was brilliant. He had restored order and peace in the universe.
Sorry about keeping these two at odds! I'm naming the chapters after Nobel prize categories, so here is peace.
“Sherlock, we need to talk,” John declared, knowing full well how authoritative that sounded. He was not a captain and a doctor for nothing.
Sherlock was stacking up pancakes onto a plate. He nodded at John and said: “Good morning John! Breakfast is ready, strawberry jam is on the table.”
John was extremely irritated. And one of the reasons why he was irritated, irritated him even more, if that was possible.
John put on his double gloves and went to the head to remove the white cloth covering the head, he pulled it down to the neck.
Sherlock however seemed to enjoy it a great deal, and languidly stretched the way a feline would. Being so graceful so early in the morning should be considered a crime, John thought.
“John, what you are suggesting is preposterous! I expected more of you than this petty nonsense! We are trying to catch a killer by the most effective way possible! Are you suggesting we stop investigating?”
“NO!” John growled out, thumping his fist against the mantle where the skull rattled, “I will not be your experiment in human emotions! You’ve already DIED in front of me for your own amusement, I’m not playing your funny little games again!”
“Um… Sorry about the bed being a bit not good and all but I do need to use the loo,” Sherlock rushed on, “Let’s make this simple for both of us. Drop the act. Just forget about the implications turn off the lights and go to bed. We can do the pretending to be boyfriends again first thing tomorrow at breakfast.”
And then you told me to go back to Mary, you promised to keep her safe, she bloody died on me –  and you took a lot of drugs!” John had to stop to breathe a few times to keep himself from shouting.
A very interesting case, rated a seven on Sherlock’s seemingly random scale of interest. And this warranted travel to the crime scene and personally tracking the killer. Unfortunately, this meant acting as bait and signing up for a short term en-suite university dorm room. This required Sherlock to sign up to a short chemistry course at Cambridge through Mycroft’s financial help and connections, while John took a first aid course for medical professionals and acted as Sherlock’s boyfriend. This way they could request and share a university guest room without suspicion.
John felt the self-loathing creep up on him again but then remembered his last therapy session. They’d spoken about his truly lousy childhood and how to deal with the high expectations that he put on himself and others. He had to stop judging Sherlock and himself for being human.
“Sherlock, I wouldn’t do anything I didn’t want to do. That kiss over at the restaurant, that wasn’t a kiss of a sociopath, even a high-functioning one at that. You wanted this,” John remarked.
“I’m glad you asked Dr Kelley. I was in Afghanistan as an army medic in the RAMC. One of the soldiers had been blasted in the face and sustained a fracture in the mandible as well as injuries to his face. His airway was swollen. The army provides us with a cricothyroidotomy kit with a scalpel and an NPA tube. While I did not have a forceps or anything fancy, it was better than a ballpoint pen like in the movies,” John joked, sending a wink towards Cynthia and Maria.
John thanked the dishwasher and left the kitchen just as he saw George get up and walk through the back door. Christ! Sherlock was now out there with both suspects of a double murder!
John replied in assent, inexplicably feeling something was off. Sherlock was looking slightly surly. He realized belatedly that Sherlock meant he was going back to Mary and not to Baker Street. It did make sense but it felt horribly wrong. John decided what he had to do. He had to call Mary and explain.
“Well isn’t that lovely!” the teacher exclaimed, “I must be off, but I’m happy to meet you and I’m sure we will see each other in the anatomy theater!”
John decided the first stop would be the dorm. Sherlock was not there and everything was untouched. Sherlock had left without an umbrella, and that fact alone made John mad. He couldn’t have taken the train without the keys to 221B, and Sherlock’s pair of keys was lying on the night stand. Where could he have gone?
This is yet another angsty chapter with some hurt/comfort...Next one will be more fluffy by the end!
“Your phone is on the bedside table. It has otherwise been in your suitcase while in our dorm room. Mary hasn’t called or texted you since our case began and you haven’t texted her either,” Sherlock pointed out.
John checked the GPS on his phone and ran towards St John’s College. There was Sherlock, back turned against him, facing the water.
For now he was allowed to gaze at Sherlock all night long. If he wanted to. If he allowed himself to. If he did not lose all sense of self control. But he should not get used to it. He had to seize this moment and then let it go. And he could not bear to think of it.
“The current king of Sweden,” Sherlock replied as he scrolled past the picture of an old man in uniform.
“Haven’t we done enough talking already? It is late and I’m not crying anymore, see?” Sherlock pointed to his face with a fake cheerful smile, which was frankly quite terrifying.
Sherlock’s face seemed to shutter up into the cool, impassive wall Sherlock hid behind. John wanted to know more to better understand, wanted to argue. But he had to resign himself to the fact that Sherlock would not open up more tonight.
When John was done, he nearly collapsed into Sherlock’s arms from exhaustion and relief. Sherlock pressed several feathery kisses to John’s temples and into his hair, cupping John’s face as if he were made of something precious and delicate.
Ah. That frustration John was displaying could be rectified with a simple acknowledgement or rebuttal. But John could not possibly find out how badly Sherlock needed John around, the amount of sentiment Sherlock had reeked of was disgusting.
He had been unhappy to find out there was only one bed, which was ridiculous, of course as a newly married couple they would need to sleep in one bed. But apparently John had failed to account for all the details of their trip and had simply forgotten that sleeping arrangements would be different. Sherlock could not help but roll his eyes, shaking his head.
Sherlock relented once it was clear John wasn’t going to give a response. The whole purpose of this stupid deduction had been to clear the air from all the repressed tension, as he knew John liked playing that he was mad at Sherlock for blurting out honest observations, but as a result his plans had backfired and the clogged air between them seemed to have gotten worse.
John did not know what to make of this strange behavior from Sherlock since the case he had privately called The Lying Detective, or rather since he had come back from the dead. He wished he could deduce Sherlock the way Sherlock did. Apprehensive, he took in a breath and entered the living room.
John’s heart is pounding. His chest expanding. Yes, he is expanding into a roar of because he is so full of – of – where was this longing coming from? Had it always been there, held back by walls he had always berated Sherlock for erecting? But all thoughts are nearly driven from Joh’s mind because he hasn’t been this close to Sherlock in oh so long, so long… Had he ever been this close?
And Sherlock was lost in the frantic buzzing of his brain, trying to piece together his newest case.
It was in this split moment that these thoughts came back to John; it was in this moment John cursed himself for destroying one of the last of Sherlock’s possessions. For destroying the absurd meaning he found in that hard, glorified prism of plastic. Which he waited, frozen numb in horror, to hit the floor, and to shatter, fracture, splinter into a cacophony of flying shards. Like shrapnel. The thought floated into John’s blank mind (almost peacefully blank – could he stay like this? – but for the horror that pulsed and throbbed through his veins, horror who’s origin he did not know) and floated right back out.
John realizes that Sherlock is indeed not a hallucination, and takes action in front of a shocked Lestrade.
Oh, you can figure out what I mean. It doesn't take a deductionist (not that I'm not striving to become one...)
Sherlock caught John’s probing gaze and held it cupped within his own, lest he spill it once again upon the floor.
Thank you for making it this far! Again, I really can't believe I'm getting hits, kudos, and comments at all!
“You… you can…” John’s eyes focused on Lestrade’s face. Silver hair. Tan. Worry etched into the lines of his face.
And still, through a factor of chance, and the narrow view of a sadly mistaken and fixed mindset, John found endless and creative ways to continue believing that Sherlock, as substantial as he seemed, was merely a hallucination. And his Sherlock, brilliant, cold, sociopathic, knows-all Sherlock, had not a wriggling suspicion of the serious breach of understanding between the two men, unwisely passing off any strange behaviour as the aftermath of his return. It had, after all, been only a week or two.
It was just as he discards this notion, that yet again, realization shines into John Watson, yet again breaking over his head, sliding down his face, trickling through his hair, tracing rivers on his skin.
“Nice to see you, John,” Lestrade nodded towards the mute and statuesque John. Who swayed, shaking his head slowly, eyes flickering between the two seated figures in front of him.
John couldn’t see a thing behind the mask that Sherlock had erected between them, more of a brick wall than a mask. Solid. John’s gaze probed, tried to force an entry, but nothing, nothing but a blank facade devoid of anything, anything...
But the silence – or rather, the lack of a sharp crack of plastic against the floor – did stay with him.
Thank you for making it this far! Again, I really can't believe I'm getting hits, kudos, and comments at all!
Sherlock deadpanned, except for a twitch of his pink lips. Which John certainly did not notice. He deliberately locked eyes with Lestrade, who held his gaze, exasperated but defiant (and inwardly thinking, oh no). And Sherlock chose his words, carefully and slowly, deliberately showing how he had obviously taken so much time to craft his speech.
Because John’s brain had, quite conveniently, forgotten that Mycroft Holmes, of the 221B-door-knocker-straightening, had been by earlier that day. And no one had been by after.
“So.” Sherlock’s eyes seemed to be blinking of their own volition. John’s eyes couldn’t help but watch, transfixed, fixed avidly upon those fluttering, dark lashes that made such a dark contrast to Sherlock’s pale and angular face.
But Sherlock’s arm shot out seized John’s collar, drawing him back in with his fierce gaze fixated upon John’s as his other arm wraps firmly around John’s back. His now uncrossed leg sweeps around John, knocking out his knees so he falls into Sherlock’s lap as if it had all been rehearsed. And then they are both bursting, so full, the two intertwined, unified. John around Sherlock, Sherlock around John, fingers twined tightly through thick curls that John had so longed to wrap his fingers in, John pinned to Sherlock so fluidly, no space between their bodies.
The pain, that had been a constant, flitting shadow at his heels. Sometimes dispersing to a faint outline in the brilliant, dazzling light of a crisp fall day, but always back to menacing and looming around corners in his dreams, once the gloom of night snuck back into his flat.
And then those nights he had forgotten flowed back into his memory. Nights of countless pens and notebooks clattering and flapping to the floor, of books and scarves and notes, all thudding and fluttering and crunching to the floor. Where no tall, curly dark-haired figure stood. With those memories came, crashing onto his shoulders with the relentless and never-ending fury of waves upon a groundout shore, the moment of crushing realization that constantly came back to him each night.
Sherlock’s voice sent chills running through John, an electric pulse. His eyes swept over every detail of Sherlock laid before him, drinking, prying, lapping.
Shaking his head to clear whatever had been afflicting him, he was sure he heard the word “case” as he stepped into his flat. And for the second time in just a few weeks, John was frozen in blank shock that slammed into him, left him mentally reeling, an effigy of disbelief and realization dawning upon his confusion.
That voice, lucid and thick, honeyed, but darker and deeper than honey, like a rich brew of tea – or coffee? – with just a hint of texture.
Leave a comment! Feedback, suggestions, random facts, it's all appreciated! You guys warmed my heart so much, if you read this. I was shocked when I had people actually viewing my work, leaving comments and kudos. I honestly and truly didn't expect anything; too much experience with social media-like platforms where one posts their own works, it never lives up to your expectations.
Yes, it had been two years, two photograph-less years, because John could not bear to see, yet not truly, see him.
The silence that fell muffled the room, blanketing each inhabitant the way a thick and humid day presses down from above, oppressive and uncomfortable.
A loose stair creaked underfoot, and John had the absurd notion he heard a dark, rumbling voice reply.
Later, Sherlock knew he would step through the problem, safely striding through the rooms of his mind palace on the all-too-familiar route. But now – what was John thinking?
And John is aware of Lestrade shouting their names in the background, aware of the damp spots his shoes are leaving on the carpet, but his world is filled only with Sherlock’s face, and his bloody gorgeous eyes that are for once filled with surprise, and… emotion.
“John I—I can’t tell you more at present, but I think you should know that those two years were not easy on me either.”
