John moved round the table to Sherlock’s side. “Oh, I know a
"Your poetry book by Gabriel Peters," replied Sherlock.
John grinned at him, the soppy great sod. “Oh yeah, I’ve noticed…” he said, nodding slowly, and he ran his tongue lightly across his bottom lip.
"Sit down," John said, a little less angrily. Sherlock sat down, agreeably silent.
And, and, and....
"Is he not married? No Family? Any other relations?" John offered.
So, John found himself looking at Sherlock's back and his spine - instead of blood, and knife wounds - assessing its natural, graceful curve, the flat triangular wings of his shoulder blades, the smooth, toned muscles of his back and the mild protrusions of his vertebrae.  This was different because when he'd seen Sherlock undressed before, it had been a coincidence then that he'd seen Sherlock's unclothed body - this was him asking permission to look and Sherlock giving it. And to look properly, not just snatch a fleeting, embarrassed glance; to look as a professional, as a concerned friend. And then John realised suddenly, as he stood there looking,  that there was more - that this was different as well because he could also
Sherlock opened the microwave door cautiously and a puff of acrid white smoke belched delicately out. They both jerked backwards automatically. Then John launched himself at the kitchen window to open it, releasing a string of expletives as he did so, most of them aimed in Sherlock’s general direction, concerning the general inappropriateness of the hour to be conducting such experiments, the unpleasant fragrance, the reasoning, validity and, indeed, the necessity of conducting such experiments anyway and querying the real need for them to be performed in their kitchen at all. When he turned around from opening the window and saw exactly what Sherlock was retrieving gingerly from the microwave  - at arm’s length with the aid of the oven glove - he hit the roof.
for violin playing. Good fridge; enough capacity for multiple experiments...Well, I believe I'll take it, Mrs. Hudson!" I exclaim, turning to see her smiling face.
I look to my gray mirror, tilt my gray head, and wonder when all the gray will forever leave my eyes.
pass out on me!"
Just because she cleans up a bit doesn't mean she's Sherlock's housekeeper, yet she finds herself making tea for both him and John for the third day in a row. She doesn't mind as much as she lets on, but it gets exhausting making three cups instead of her one.
Glancing up at the D.I. as he swings the door open, I walk towards the stool he pulls out, leaning lightly against the mahogany counter. He nods at me, pulling off his black coat and laying it on his seat before sitting down. Before I can retrieve all of the drinks requested, Lestrade grips my wrist.
Sherlock lay in the bathroom like a dead thing. The bathtub was pressed along the length of his back, his elbows propped up on the lip of the tub. His legs were sprawled apart, feet vaguely encircling the loo. Dazedly, he pressed a new syringe into the most visible vein at the crook of his elbow, waiting for the pearls of blood to appear in the barrel before plunging the needle in completely.
John was still computing the news.
There were different kinds of love, he knew that. And he'd known her for such a short time. He'd wanted to offer her something in return for saving him. Because she had. And he really had been very fond of her. She was beautiful, clever, charming, funny. He had loved her. He had been grateful to her. She had genuinely made him laugh again.
“So…” said Greg and he raised his eyebrows.
you?” she asked coldly and suspiciously, without looking up at either of them.
And suddenly John felt like the time he had been hit in the chest by a piece of shrapnel in Helmand in Afghanistan, and he thanked God for the body armour which had saved him, but the force of the blast had still knocked him clean off his feet. This time though, it was like the ghost of the shrapnel hitting him, so it left only an emotional shockwave behind it in his chest, rather than a physical one, but it still practically knocked him clean off his feet.
thought Mycroft, instantly knowing exactly which kind of
“I don’t usually…” he began haltingly.
"Who's here then?” asked Agatha loudly from the other room, adding gratefully, “Oooo, thanks, Sigs!” as she was clearly being passed something. John could guess what it was from the sound of two glasses being enthusiastically clinked together immediately after she spoke.
Everything changed then, at that moment. And he was different too, after The Fall.
“Why couldn’t you use one of your glass things?” John barked back, outraged. “You've got enough bloody chemistry sets to—”
“Oh, ages ago,” replied Sherlock, finishing his text and putting his phone back onto the bedside table as he stood up. “Come on, John, I want tea,” he said abruptly. “Let’s go back downstairs,” and he walked towards the door.
And Sherlock laughed, really laughed, that deep throaty chuckle that John adored. “It certainly is…” he said, then added, “…and John, that was by
“Er, yeah,” he said remembering it. There had been something off about what the Major had told them. “Maybe that would be worth a look?” John continued. “What if he—” but then Lucia interrupted. She came and stood in the sitting room doorway and said, “We’re just about ready, everyone, would you like to sit down and we’ll bring dinner though?” She looked pointedly at Sherlock. “Get Mycroft off his bloody phone, darling,” she said. “Make him sit down.” That was some task, John thought.
Mycroft smiled.
“Sounds divine,” said Mycroft, amused by Gregory’s need to state his plans aloud. Greg liked hearing the amusement in Mycroft’s voice and his smile turned into a grin. “And then, after that,” he promised, “I’m gonna take you back to somewhere where you were last night…”
John was irrationally incensed. He gaped. "How the

Mycroft made a short detour to the hook on back of Greg’s bedroom door and lifted them off; the one Greg had worn earlier to go downstairs and a second, older one which was simple thick white towelling.
"What were you doing? I thought you were just going to talk to the restaurant manager," John asked, carefully checking the depth of the cut and Sherlock's ribs on either side of the wound.
John whispered urgently. It was both a question and a warning. As John uttered the word, Sherlock opened his eyes and caught John’s gaze. “Mmmmm,
wrote me one.”

"Years. For years." Sherlock replied, honestly, openly, holding John's gaze.
“Oh, obvious,” Sherlock replied, as if bored. “That page was very slightly bent back, the book practically opened to that poem by itself—” John knew this wasn't completely true but there was definitely a tendency there. “—And there were three biscuit crumbs in the crease of the page…” (

He was actually taking Sherlock
The creme brûlée tasted the best it had ever tasted. Even better after watching Gregory Lestrade lick some of it from a spoon right in front of him.
Greg smiled. He knew not to ask, really, but he wanted to get their conversational juices flowing. However, no sooner had the bartender made the drinks and served them, the maitre’d was back. “Your table is ready, gentlemen,” he said.
The greenness of the view out of the window drew him over immediately, and he put his overnight bag on the bed and went and looked out. The bedroom was at the back of the house and it looked out over the garden and the open countryside beyond. “Lovely view,” remarked John.
"A punctured lung which suddenly collapses," John continued. "It can happen from a needle injury that pierces the lung tissue, much less from a bloody Stanley knife. We're going. Come on." Sherlock was obviously convinced enough by that as he stopped arguing. As they left the carpark via the dank stairwell and re-entered the bright and normal world of the shopping centre, John said, "We'll get a cab. Put some pressure on it."
"For telling me."
"Guest bedroom?" prompted John, thinking that Sherlock looked like he did when some kind of massive deduction was taking place. He didn’t answer. “Where the guests sleep?” John asked with a grin.
Lucia ignored this, flicked open the box awkwardly one-handed and then shook it demandingly under his nose again, at which point he finally grabbed a cracker and shoved the box crossly away from his face and in Mycroft's general direction. Mycroft grudgingly took one too, and Lucia quickly went round the table, offering the box to everyone in turn, still holding the salad bowl, as Siger went around the table the other way and finished dishing up the scallops as if in a choreographed food/cracker-serving dance routine. Once everyone (and every place) had a complete plate of first course and a cracker in front of them, Siger and Lucia discarded the serving plate and bowl on the sideboard - in case anyone wanted second helpings - and took their seats too.
Next to him and very quietly, Sherlock leaned closer and muttered sarcastically in his ear, “Lucky you!” which made John smile.
John was trying to lift the thick wad of papers in the drawer to look underneath without getting them all out, but there were too many.
from you - yesterday mornin’, handwritten on some thick, posh paper. Someone delivered it -
Mycroft raised an eyebrow and turned his head to look coldly at Sherlock. The look could have felled a charging rhino.
“Jesus! D’
should like to open it. In private,” said Mycroft, slightly sternly.
Sherlock didn't ask what it was. He didn't need to. Of course, he already knew. He smiled and leaned closer, dipping his head. "I already knew," he said, and that would have been a smug comment, but for the fact that Sherlock had his mouth very close to John's left ear when he spoke, and the words as he said them were breathed into it rather than spoken out loud, in such an intimate way that it left John reeling.
Anne Cumberbatch, thank
"They're not all like this," said John, in its defence. "They're gradually phasing these older ones out, anyway." He didn't mind the older trains, they had character, like old houses.
“Let’s go to my room,” said John, beginning to turn, to lead the way. He immediately felt some resistance from Sherlock, so he looked back to see Sherlock standing still with a slight frown on his face. “Erm…I have the bigger bed…” he said.
That chaste kiss of joy on Sherlock's neck had started something in John, something inside him had lit up with a brilliant bright flame and suddenly John wanted more. John could hardly believe it all himself - but was this not the day for earth-shattering revelations? He might not be able to say it yet, but he could think it.
Where John begins to collect the pieces and examine them.
John swiftly dropped his hands flat to Sherlock's chest, then gripped his shirt in two fists and without hesitation turned him and walked them both fast backwards towards the crime scene wall. Whether Sherlock knew what John intended or whether he did not, he didn't protest or resist. He let John do it, his arms and hands still sliding loosely down John’s back and staring fixedly down at John with real hunger in his eyes. They moved together like it was one of the pre-arranged dance steps that Sherlock had taught him for his wedding waltz. John had no idea if Sherlock had ever done this before or had it done to him, but by God, he wanted to be the one to do it now.
Mycroft said nothing however, just did what he was doing, and then sat down at the table, but almost as soon as he’d done so, Agatha burst noisily in from the garden too. “The bloody
We only have them at Christmas (why? don't know? Blame the Victorians) but they usually spill over into the New Year too, because there are usually a few left in a big box of 12 after Christmas, and hey, they're fun, right?
in big letters. John smiled at this and opened the card. Inside, Sherlock had simply written
Over the first course, and during the brief wait between that and their main courses, they discussed so many obscure things that Mycroft was in turn intrigued, delighted, amused and surprised. Gregory was a superb dinner companion, he thought. He was entertaining, but thoughtful. He was sharp and intelligent, had plenty of opinions, but he was also a good listener and he asked Mycroft many things to get him to talk about himself. Mycroft, normally so reticent to discuss anything personal, had already warmed to Gregory’s gregarious manner during the Christmas drinks at Baker Street where they had finally met properly, but this evening he found himself not just warming but heating up; secretly hanging onto Gregory’s every word. ‘I haven't had an evening like this for an
Empty-handed, Greg stepped back over to Mycroft and Mycroft immediately reached out for his already open top button, sliding his long fingers into and down the neck of his shirt to the second button and opening it as he kissed him gently. Greg kissed Mycroft back as he moved his hands to undo Mycroft’s shirt buttons in return, but he kissed more fiercely, with growing ardour, and so between them they divested each other of their shirts, kissing each other all the while. Mycroft wished desperately too late that he’d spent more time on his running machine earlier that week, rather than researching new recipes on the internet to use up his last bit of black truffle oil, but Greg did not seem to notice his imperfections. His shirt unbuttoned, Greg slipped it from Mycroft’s shoulders and off, turning quickly to throw it one-handed to land on the chair between his wardrobe and his bed, on top of the pile of his own clothing. “Shall I close the curtain?” asked Greg, a little breathlessly, his hands running over Mycroft’s back and his shoulders, his mouth returning to Mycroft’s neck. They stood in clear view of anyone who happened to be looking out of their back window too.
But there was more.
They looked at each other, Mycroft’s mind whirling at a mile a minute. Then they came both instantly to the same crashingly obvious conclusion.
flirtation. He was warming up to those two particular facets of Gregory Lestrade’s personality nicely. “As am I, with you,” he said sincerely in reply. “And I agree. I wish we’d done it sooner too.”
different?
“Thank you,” Mycroft  mumbled, looking disgruntled. It seemed that Siger had been waiting almost in the doorway poised for everyone to sit down before he started bringing through part of the first course - which, Lucia announced as Siger came in bearing a huge covered serving dish - was scallops with a warm spinach and pomegranate salad. As Siger ceremoniously brought it into the room, Lucia added, gesturing to Siger’s serving dish, “Sigs has the scallops and I’ll just grab the spinach and pomegranate salad…” Siger immediately came around the table to dish up John’s plate first, and Lucia went back into the kitchen to get the salad.
he thought.
Lucia had been holding the fish carefully to cool it. “Sherlock?” asked John encouragingly, nodding at it, as Lucia held out the fish to her younger son.
Still Sherlock said nothing.
'Oh God, yes; oh, I do…And, oh my God, but I think he might want
Not for the first time this evening, Mycroft found himself rendered incapable of speech and he simply couldn’t provide a reply to that statement. Which didn’t matter though, of course, because Greg wasn’t expecting one anyway.
his lips and tongue warm and wet and delicate on his skin...
growled John through a wolf-like grin, insinuating himself between Sherlock’s long legs, yanking down his own underwear and jeans as one as he pinned Sherlock against the wall with his lower body.
replied Greg, awkwardly, picking up on Mycroft’s thought. “She’s…sort of a friend…she was just asking me about…” he paused. Mycroft lifted his eyebrows. “…Asking me about my evenin’!” Greg admitted, making Mycroft smile.
She smirked. “That’s what I was coming to tell you about,” she said, “Donnie Guttierez is downstairs, and he wants to make a confession…” and then she told him all about it.
“I rest my case,” murmured Sherlock quickly in John’s ear right before he went over - laughing - to help pull her up.
John and Agatha had almost got through the sitting room doorway by this time, but John still caught Sherlock’s brisk, no-nonsense reply.
As Mycroft took his coat off, he tried not to deduce but some things were impossible not to see. There were an assortment of other items of clothing on the coat rack, including an elderly and battered waxed Barbour jacket, which looked incredibly comfortable. Surely too big for Greg and very well worn, so must have belonged to a relation….vintage from the age of it, but not ancient, so…
He had to give Sherlock something to let him know how he felt, but he couldn’t, even then, say what he really,
But then, for her to up and tell him this morning that it was never going to work, and it was over between them anyway because she loved someone else who wanted her more. She was going back to her ex-husband, the man John had literally known nothing about, the man who had left
Sherlock looked around awkwardly at John over his left shoulder. John noted the wince as he moved. "What do you mean,
Greg was bending down to the freezer, searching for ice, just as Mycroft walked into the kitchen and so Mycroft was presented with a surprising and wonderful view of his rear. Not only that, but he had taken off his outer jacket and suit jacket and slung both carelessly over the back of a chair at the kitchen table. As he straightened up, ice cube tray in hand, Mycroft delighted at the sight of his back and broad shoulders encased in his crisp, light-coloured shirt. He turned around and grinned, disarming Mycroft completely. “You may ask,” he said, mock seriously. “It’s their 15-year-old Speyside single malt. It’s very good,” he held out the half-full ice cube tray. “Ice?’ he asked, lifting his eyebrows.
“But that's not true,” Sherlock observed, “You know I occasionally have done, in the past.”
Greg leaned back against his kitchen counter again, put his glass down and loosened his tie. He undid his top button but left the tie on. Mycroft thought his mouth might water. Just looking at him made Mycroft want to loosen his own tie. As a distraction, he swirled the last of the thick amber liquid gently in his glass and watched it circle lazily around.
he growled meaningfully, looking John straight in the eye. He said it very slowly and he used every bit of his face to say it.
“Clotted cream in the fridge,” Clarissa said loudly to Gabriella, and turned back to John and Sherlock. “So how do you all know each other? What’s the story here?” she asked, smiling encouragingly and perching on the arm of one of the empty armchairs. John looked at Sherlock.
“I—ah—I didn’t quite know how to….erm…politely refuse!” Mycroft confessed, glancing at him, relieved.
“Er, yeah! It was great,” said Greg, quickly finishing the dregs of his drink. “Thanks for the tip!” He turned to Mycroft. “So what are you having then?” he asked eagerly.
She was going to sign it all over to me and then you and your fucking
sending invisible sparks flying up John's arm and a shiver up John's back and the hairs on the nape of his neck rose up and now it was John's turn to gasp. He closed his mouth quickly and swallowed, and then opened it again to speak - without a clue of what he was going to say - but before he could even make a sound, Sherlock twisted quickly round on the chair, still holding John's forearm tightly, and he looked back and up over his shoulder at John and his gaze was like molten mercury. Hot and deadly and exhilarating.
Mycroft stood up and, without asking, began to take over the job of dishing up the scallops for Agatha and Sherlock without argument. He did, however, intone rather exasperatedly, “Haven’t we just experienced the joy of crackers only a few days ago?”
“Good evening to you, David,” replied Mycroft suavely, “and yes, please, but do give me a moment if you would, I’m just deliberating….” he scanned the optics behind the bar, considering.
Mycroft hesitated, he didn’t move. “I don’t know if I do, I rather like the sound of your full name,” he said. “I’m all for full names. Do you mind very much if I call you Gregory?”
John had tissues in his bedroom so the first part of the clean up was easy. He was glad to see Sherlock hadn't got anything on his expensive trousers. ‘Try explaining
“I’m gonna suck your gorgeous cock,” murmured Greg clearly, looking directly up at him.
Mycroft nodded briefly. “After being so amenable to such a public display across the table in the restaurant, one should certainly hope so,” he said seriously, but he was trying not to smile.
I hadn't know then that she meant family.
"Panic attack," he informs simply; I should've known. The symptoms were all present, but I was too worked up to see them. "You said something about a John? Who is that?"
"Oh, Sherlock..."
I want someone to kiss me like that.
They practically drag themselves out of bed as they saunter into the hallway, venturing towards the shower stalls. I rake a hand through my unkempt hair as the last of them file out of the room, Bill appearing in the doorway. I turn to the clock again.
Or when we were on a case that he exclaimed was an 8.5. He must've thought snogging me overexcitedly with bloody latex gloves was sexy.
"Oh, my God," is all I can bite out, and I hear her again. It's almost like she's compensating for her previous silence. Drowning the speaker with tears.
He was a difficult person.
It was a solitary existence. He felt like a lighthouse perched on a craggy hill, or an island nestled in some far corner of the world. It felt as if he was submerged in water, like everything was far away and unattainable.
"Just so you know, I might step on your toes a bit," John informs, waiting as Sherlock searches for a song in his endless playlist, some of them his own recorded compositions.
Sherlock obliged on both counts, undoing his buttons mainly with one hand and then dropping his ruined shirt carelessly to the floor, before turning to stand with his back to the window so John could see.
“You’re looking very slim and dashing, Mykie,” she said as she let go of him. “Is there a young lady?” He withdrew slightly to position himself a safe distance away and leant elegantly against the doorframe as soon as Lucia had come back through it.
John nearly fell over as he clasped his hand around Sherlock’s length just as Sherlock’s warm hand slipped down and gripped his own. Sherlock’s head tipped back instantly and he gasped.
Sherlock shifted slightly underneath John and this time, John suddenly found himself actually lying on his best friend, pinning him down with his body, pressing his weight against him in a way that he had never experienced before in all their escapades. Not to mention the addition of passionate snogging into the scenario, which was also new…and the whole thing was simply fucking
another of Sherlock's tricks and that he would somehow miraculously come back. Be
And Mycroft was done for.
John, still smiling, didn’t answer, assuming he meant in regards to John's career change as a consulting detective's assistant and personal physician.
Greg shrugged and smiled at the same time. “Go right ahead!” he said, somewhat bemused by the asking of permission. But Mycroft was more than happy with that answer. “I shall call you Gregory then,” he said. “And I’m quite happy here, for the moment, if you are?”
"Can you move your neck normally? You need to stand up to show me," John said.
Sherlock had Just been about to remind John what the day was, but suddenly right now was not the time. He sat up completely, facing John, and now interrupted
” she added, unnecessarily.
Sherlock stood still. "I'm not sitting in A&E for six hours to be seen by a teenager fresh out of medical school. I'm not going."
Now John’s posture changed like a panther about to strike. His eyes darkened as he stared coldly at Sherlock and the muscles in his jaw tightened as he gritted his teeth. "Can I just come in, please?” he said, abruptly, with some emotion that was suddenly so hard to control that the air around him vibrated with the force of containing it. Sherlock looked at him, properly. His hair and face were wet through with the light drizzling rain that was falling, as was his coat, and his shoes and one trouser hem were smeared with the silty mud from the edge of the pond in Regent's Park. He smelt of the cold air and the rain, and his eyes were bitter and sharp with anger and betrayal.
She certainly had. And the reason for it stood right in front of John, holding a cup that she had bought him with some freshly cooked human eyes in it, still gently smoking.
Sherlock. He
And yes, it was with a man, but all John could think was, ‘Well, if it can be this good, then maybe it’s about bloody time I found that out.’
he thought, incredulous, even while it was happening. And there was nothing gentle about it…Sherlock’s mouth on his; the heady, familiar scent of him, the feel of his hair, thick and silky in John's fingers and under his hand, the solid heavy warmth of his body pressed full against John's as John raked his fingers roughly from Sherlock's bare shoulder down his smooth back.
and the words moved closer together and turned gold as he thought about them.
John glanced at him, but he did seem to be showing all the signs of being sincere.
Greg said, afterwards, throwing himself back on the pillows to catch his breath as Mycroft got up for the bathroom. “I’m too old for this!” he continued, making Mycroft snort. “Forget the nutritious healthy breakfast I was gonna offer you. We need full-fat-lard-and-sugar calories to re-build our strength after that one…” he paused, realising what he’d just said carried a certain level of assumption, and then said hopefully, "Are you…were you plannin’ on staying’ for breakfast? Because just round the corner, there’s a nice shop - they do amazin’ doughnuts…?”
- but he wasn't sure what

all about John...
Now Sherlock looked straight at him. "I thought it was you screaming at first and I...I paused for a second. He...did
Only Sherlock would instantly memorise the list of the fish's responses and what they meant, thought John. He smiled even more widely at that, but he didn't look up. "That's me," he said, still looking down at the fish. He knew he would be passionate. The fish had always told him that he was. When he finally did look up, Sherlock was looking directly at him from across the table. John smiled at him wryly and raised both his eyebrows, but Sherlock just picked up his glass and drank, looking at John as he did it.

liked
Judi Dench!”
“Now who’s Secret Squirrel?” asked Sherlock, getting the caffetiere down from the cupboard, but he didn’t press for anything more. They had to have some secrets from each other.
Mycroft was just spreading more of the glorious thick cut marmalade on his second slice.
“Oh, you—you idiot! Sherlock, you nutcase!” John yelped affectionately through the laughter when he could finally speak. “You utter—you total, utter maniac!”
That induced a bout of raucous laughter from everyone in the kitchen, and John flicked a glance at Sherlock, who was now staring fixedly out of the window, gripping the arms of the chair, his book forgotten in his lap. John could see his toes were twitching in his shoes.
"Oh, very well," he grumbled and held out his flat palm for John to place the fish onto it. The fish was as grudging as Mycroft, and it fluttered slightly but then lay still. They all waited for a few seconds but it did not respond. From past experience, John already knew nothing more would happen. The fish would always react within seconds, and if it did not, then....your fortune must be read from the list.
have just got down by itself when the storm really got going anyway, as anyone could see where the cat's claws had left numerous fresh scratch marks going down the trunk directly above where the body had been found anyway, and then it transpired via a phone call to the officers searching the deceased man's home that; yes, there was a cat, and yes, it was at home, safe and sound, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.
They didn’t even get to the fridge. One thing led to another, and after a polite
Sherlock sat down smartly at the table and picked up the paper again. He turned straight to the obituary pages. “Good. You’re making tea. Love some,” he said smugly to Mycroft, not looking at him, scanning the columns as he spoke.
you doing, then?’ said John, “Because there’s clearly something Secret Squirrel going on at this table…”
When Mycroft had brought him back in the plane after Moriarty's broadcast, he was, at first, only glad again that he had not said the words that he had so wanted to say on the roof, the words that had been in his head and his heart on the terrace at Appledore, the words that had been in his mouth just moments before, on the runway. Having not said those words meant he was able to come back and carry on. If he had said them, he would not have been able to, he could not have done so. Not with Mary standing there, fecund and glowing and so full of the evidence of John's choice.
After a few hedonistic moments of fervent snogging and sliding, Greg decided the distribution of the oil was fairly even. Even enough for his purposes, anyway. “Lift up,” he breathed again. As Mycroft lifted his body from Greg’s, Greg shifted out from underneath him, turning onto his side to face Mycroft and pushing gently Mycroft back and off as he turned so Mycroft got the hint to do the same. Now they faced each other again, breathing hard, flushed and oiled up. “My sheets are never gonna recover from this…” said Greg cheerfully and he reached slowly down, diving the backs of his fingers down against Mycroft's stomach to take hold of his lover’s cock.
(See the end of the chapter for
Mycroft, who lived his life in complete control of everything, was losing it. How did ordinary people
note that I hand-wrote yesterday was to the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, asking him if he—” he stopped, aware that in his confusion he was babbling a bit about something that he should not be babbling about. “Look, do you still have the note?” he demanded instead, changing tack.
The Old Bailey is the Central Criminal Court of England and Wales, commonly referred to as the Old Bailey after the street on which it stands. It is the most famous courthouse in London, possibly in all of England. It's really old. (You see the inside of it in Sherlock's mind palace in The Sign of Three, actually!!) Quite why Sherlock has a hand-drawn map of its floor-plan in a drawer at home, I don't know.
Sherlock swept his hair back with both hands. “I just said I was going to tell you about it today,” he repeated, to clarify. He pointed a finger at the note in John’s hand. “That one was the first one I wrote. A...er...practice run, if you like. It turns out I’m not so good with Greg’s handwriting as I am with Mycroft’s. So, yes,
Whatever that meant. John shook his head, amused. Then he wished he hadn't. Jesus, that hurt.
Greg lifted his head from the pillow and kissed him lightly and repeatedly, growing more passionate and intense each time, and Mycroft returned the kisses, their ardour increasing. Mycroft moved closer and over Greg, and eventually his long limbs entangled Gregory possessively with no intention of letting go.
about John.
“Oh, lovely! Very useful for writing down all your secrets!" Agatha brayed at him, waving her glass.
Sherlock narrowed his eyebrows at her suspiciously, and then looked the other way, tossing the notepad onto the table with a disgusted flick of his wrist.
The cat - Persephone - came up on her back legs to butt her head repeatedly against John’s knee. John reached down to stroke her again. She wouldn’t leave him alone.

Mycroft, I don’t stand a bloody chance!” he moaned. Mycroft replied by pressing his own body reciprocally harder against Greg’s. And for each of them there was absolutely no doubt about the other’s delight. Mycroft had deduced (correctly, of course) that Gregory Lestrade was very auditorily focused. Well, incidental deductions like that one really couldn’t be helped. One was a Holmes, after all.
Then he clicked what Sherlock would have seen and realised instantly. An ancient bike plus relatively awkward and heavy art equipment to be transported all the way out here meant she must live very locally.
"Yes, well, there was that too," Sherlock replied honestly, sipping his tea.
the father. Not me. And…and he’s asked her to leave me and go and be with him again. And so…so… she's left!” He sat up, paused and then swallowed hard. He seemed less matter of fact with each word. More conversational. But suddenly his voice grew thicker again and more emotional. “She’s left me...to go and be...with him! And there's more...there's..." and then he stopped speaking and bent his head, resting his elbow on his knee and pinching the bridge of his nose with his eyes closed. He breathed in deeply, shakily, his face contorting.
John laughed. Then he leaned a hand on the table, looking down at the phone in Sherlock’s hand. “Sherlock, I think it’s taken a lot for Mycroft to send that!” he said thoughtfully. “Screenshot it if you really want to, but reply now and say something nice. Something encouraging.”
We are on the home stretch with this, honestly! The next chapter is almost completely done and then this little beauty will be an entirely finished fic! (I know, I can't believe it either!)
Why wouldn't that thought go away? John had brought him in some coffee, talked about some inanities and then gone out. Sherlock had drunk his coffee, trying to think, and then realised he needed to change his scenery and to get up, have a wash, put some clothes on and go and lie down on the sofa in the sitting room - which was his best thinking place - and think.
"Lilac or white?" he asked, pointing up at it as she held the gate open for them.
confirmed Greg, now passing him the doughnut box. “Did you want a special Valentine’s doughnut for first breakfast while I make us some toast?”
cups to fry
“Yeah, well, I’m not just a pretty face, you know,” said John casually, the glow in his chest not just due to the excellent scarf around his neck.
“Yes!
This conversation was all very high on the irritation scale. As well as already being really frustrated and pissed off, John could also now feel a tension headache starting up. However, Sherlock was oblivious to John’s irritation with him much of the time. So why should this occasion be any different?
Sherlock, however, lay still in their bed; half on his phone, half drinking the coffee John had just taken him and lazily answering him through the open door. Well, actually, John wasn’t moaning about the
“It makes me wonder what it would be like to—” he paused and then finished, “—to sleep together…” He had said it almost directly into Mycroft’s waiting ear.
Even when he was seeing it on his best friend's face for the very first time.
The truth was out at last. John had never experienced all these emotions at once. It was like being caught in an avalanche.
"Did you...just say 'thank you?' "John asked.
, oh God,
“Good evening, Gregory,” said Mycroft, not exactly smiling but just as awkwardly.
John went cold and then hot. Who was it from?
he said again delightedly. “Oh my God…” He lifted his head to look down at Mycroft again. “Come back up ‘ere…” he said. “I'm missin' you already…” The words made Mycroft’s heart sing.
yeah….” he growled harshly, pinning Sherlock hard against the wall again, his own eyes closed now, his rugged handsome face contorted with the strength of his orgasm, covering both their stomachs with more waves of fluid heat. Sherlock's hand swept up John's back again as he came and kept coming, making him shudder and moan against his friend. “Oh my God,
When Sherlock released his hand, John swept his fingers and then his thumb across the full curves of Sherlock's lips and on up along his jawline, to cup his hand around the back of Sherlock's skull and pull him back down to his mouth again to prove it.
John grinned in relief. “Oh, ok!” he said. Maybe Siger had been over-generous with the wine while stirring, he thought.
"I know," said John, immediately thinking, 'I'm very attached to
he had consciously admitted the truth to himself, and so now it really couldn't harp on about it subconsciously anymore. He had solved the problem of why he felt differently about John, and now that knowledge existed secretly in his mind.
John's heart went
It was quite warm in Gregory’s kitchen and Mycroft had a lot of layers on. He also knew he didn’t look his best when he got too hot. He passed Greg his empty glass and then said, to explain, “I think if you’ll excuse me, I must take my suit jacket off too. It’s rather warm in here.”
here.
she proclaimed. She took a big swig before waiting for any kind of response.
say it.
Mycroft’s heart had been jumping around in his chest quite a bit this evening but it jumped another impressive triple somersault at Greg’s words.  “Really?” he asked, his voice hesitant and surprised.
he’d said, lightly, as if on a whim... and yes,
“—They would have done, yes,” Sherlock countered, “but...they haven’t said a word to me yet. Not a peep out of either of them..." He studied his phone again for a minute.
he said easily, realising immediately what John had found and now sounding actually quite relieved. “That’s the note from Greg…I was going to tell you about it today - seeing as it’s—”
Once again, he realised that his body had known for a long time something that his conscious mind had refused to see. His kisses grew more ardent, and he pressed his body hard against Sherlock as Sherlock pressed back, his breathing as urgent and laboured as John’s. Even the sound of Sherlock breathing like that was arousing to John and John couldn't help himself. There were things he wanted to say.  He may have had trouble saying deep, intense emotional stuff, but he had no trouble talking dirty. “Oh, the things I’m going to do to you,” he whispered roughly between hot, fierce kisses. And Sherlock made a rumbling moan deep in his throat as answer. He swept his hands down John’s back and round the waistband of his jeans to John’s flies and began to undo them slightly roughly. “Get these off,” he said, the roughness of his touch matching the tone of his voice. John, surprisingly, found he liked this directness -
“Nah,” said Greg, “we’ll save that for another weekend…” then he suddenly he thought about it. “Ahh, that's if you’ve got nothin’ planned this mornin’?” he said cautiously. He suddenly realised that maybe he’d been rather presumptuous. Mycroft must be an extremely busy man, even on Sundays. “So…
Shinysherlock is very real and has an account on AO3. Thank you, thank you, Shinysherlock for the excellent prompt idea! Loved it. Just sorry it took me so long…! (I started it in December 2014, so six and more than a half - very nearly seven!!! - years; which may or may not be some sort of record for such a short piece of fan fiction?! You can let me know…!) 😬
he asked. “Bloody hell, what am I telling you about
like hearing you…
By the time they got back, Sherlock was really grumbling. "It really hurts now," he said, reaching round once again to rub the base of his neck under his coat collar. John put his key in the door and pushed the door open and stood to the side to allow Sherlock to go in first.
“Yes,
"Well. Things to do!” Sherlock declared in mock gaiety, and took this moment to whisk away off down the corridor in the opposite direction, leaving her standing there in his wake, discreetly brushing down her skirt.
Mycroft wondered helplessly, still rather incredulous. He hadn’t felt what he was feeling now since he was in his first term at university...and that
Greg gave a soft snort of laughter. “Don’t be. I’m about as vanilla as a four-year old’s ice-cream on Clacton beach,” he said softly. “But I really like you. And I’m pretty sure I’ve got this right and
Sherlock lifted his cup to his lips, basking in their shocked admiring silence and sipped his tea as if nothing amazing had just happened.
Sherlock!” Greg repeated again and then he spluttered a bit and exclaimed, “Christ! This was all your bloody brother’s doing, wasn't it?” He shook his head, bursting into a huge disbelieving grin - he was amused and he was shocked, and he simply couldn't believe it. But Mycroft was not at all amused.
‘Oh,’ thought Mycroft,
Mary, whom Sherlock had not anticipated. And so things had not gone to plan, not at all. Nothing had gone to plan.
How did you…?"
And so here they were. And John was sure - he had never been more sure about anything in his life - that this was
he thought on the back of that. And that was it. And what exactly had Sherlock just said to him?
Mycroft’s smile widened. “And why would that be?” he asked, seeing that something was coming.
The bloody internal voice was a smug and irritating wanker. ‘Yep. Just that,’ he thought firmly. And he whisked off the duvet and got up quickly to put an end to this stupid internal conversation. His head swam with a fiery burst of pain and he had to sit down again on his bed for a second.  He felt a bit nauseous and he raised his fingers gingerly to the sore spot on the back of his head. Bloody hell, it was so,
Mycroft smiled
Just then, Mrs. Holmes came back into the kitchen. In one hand she carried a large pale gold ceramic vase, which now contained John's bunch of red and green chrysanthemums, and in the other hand she bore a plate of home made mince pies and ginger biscuits. She placed them both down delicately side by side on the table. "There," she said. "Tuck in! You must be famished after that awful train journey, John! And what a bit of luck then that you managed to catch that earlier one, after all!” and she smiled and winked at John. If John didn't know her better, he might have been slightly taken aback by that very friendly wink, but as he knew her - and her younger son - well enough by now, he wasn't. He realised  that of course she had caught the brief exchange about the iron-turned-murder-weapon and the suspect's DNA, and seen Sherlock's reaction. More over, she had witnessed John's response to his reaction, and knew exactly what he was thinking about it all. That conspiratorial wink of hers meant that while she knew Sherlock's joyful and enthusiastic response to the confirmation that he had been right about a murder weapon's hiding place wasn't exactly
John shook his head. "Nothing to do with not having a case on at the moment, then?” He smiled into his cup.
Mycroft saw his opportunity for a bit of revenge and took it. “Mmmm. Well. Whatever could you be frightened of, Sherlock?” he asked innocently, raising his eyebrows. Maybe he was thinking about Sherlock barging in on him earlier, thought John, perceptively.
"It's one of my favourite poems, Sherlock," he said slowly. "In fact, I think it is my favourite. I read it a lot while I was away….I grew up near the sea and it…it reminded me so acutely of home.”
swear. I've never heard you say...words like that....the f-word. Not like you meant it.”
- to the front desk yesterday at about 10.20, 10.30…no one seemed to know who’d left it. My sergeant came in around 10.45 or 10.50 to get me…” he was frowning, trying to place the time, to give the evidence.
say that! You
Downstairs in the kitchen, Mycroft had taken his suit jacket off but was still in his waistcoat, his shirt sleeves rolled up neatly, beginning to make tea in a vast red teapot. John found this sight strangely amusing, he didn’t know why, but seeing Mycroft being all domesticated was…
John froze.
was a smoking station if he’d ever seen one.
This was ridiculous. He was getting nowhere.
“Really?” asked John, in the same serious tone, knowing what Sherlock was saying here with this and feeling his own heart almost skip a beat in response. He would have been unable to stop his grin of happiness spreading, even if he had cared to try. So he didn’t. He just smiled. “Well, I don’t think that’s a problem at all,” he said, “I definitely think I can help you there...but there is only one treatment for that, I’m afraid…”
This chapter is dedicated to StarsAndStitches for some of the excellent science ideas of the contents of Sherlock's bedroom...! It wouldn't have looked the same without the plastic molecules, the Escher print or the atlas of historical sea charts, Stars, honestly!!! ;)
“Oh, good - well, it seems you just have!” mumbled Sherlock, crossing his arms. He didn’t sound very happy about it.
“Mr. Lestrade, sir,” murmured the maitre’d, making Greg turn round in his seat and then hurriedly stand up. “Mr. Holmes has arrived,” he added, somewhat unnecessarily, and then he stepped back discretely. They both thanked him at the same time, and he left them for a moment to greet each other.
Why can’t you
"Heaven forbid! One could hardly forget the events of last New Year's Eve!" chimed in Mycroft, placing his fingertips rather delicately to his forehead and closing his eyes theatrically.
"Cable ties," replied Sherlock, tightly. "Needs must when the devil drives."
John returned his look, but with difficulty. “Only if you're directly quoting someone else. Like when I first met you and you said people normally tell you to piss off. Generally, you
Easy and tiresome, not exciting at all

swear. I didn't expect—it just sounded funny, that's all."
“Oh, marvellous, another one!" scoffed Sherlock, looking at it disdainfully. "A very small and annoying child could solve those moronic things!”
“Bloody
As Siger made his way to the door, the person on the doorstep grew impatient. The letterbox was noisily pushed open and the person on the outside of it leaned down and bellowed through the opening,
John became aware that he had missed a vital prompt to bring him into this little improvisation. "Hmmm?" he asked, raising his eyebrows in question.
Mycroft was surprised into an honest answer. “I...thank you, I am. Very well. I trust you...are...well, too?"
this?”
The footpath after they left the quay was just a well-worn path of hardened mud and scruffy grass, but it was dry and easy going underfoot. Just as well really, thought John, as neither of them had thought to wear the appropriate footwear for anything more trying. They rounded a curve in the path past some matured hedgerow, and then suddenly found they were walking high up on an old earthen sea-wall, directly alongside the estuary. It was breathtakingly beautiful. The tide was out and John stopped to look. The daylight here by the water was very clear somehow, with a slightly golden feel to it and the birds that were in flight looked like they were lit from below by the sun reflecting off the low water. Even the mudflats looked beautiful, like sleek grey seal-skin. They were pocked with the rune-like footprints of birds.
"Right away,
He bolts for the door, wrenching it open as he sees Anderson and Sally approaching. Gulping a little, he glances back into the room, seeing Sherlock and John still speaking into the phone at quite a close proximity.
"I said he'd be an ass, and he usually is, but he proved me wrong. He was
Because I should be proud. Because William, where ever he is, whoever he is, is beautiful, and I should be proud of him.
"I didn't think he had it in him to feel things that way," the sergeant murmurs, trying to fend off her red hot jealousy; why does the Freak get someone so devoted and loyal, and she can't even keep someone as easy as Anderson?
“About what?” said Sherlock.
21 February 14:18
She just stares at me for a moment before saying,"But he could've stopped at any moment, or not have driven while being drunk, or asked for help. There are many variables and factors to situations like this."
"Yes, '
I read over the cursive script again, smiling slightly as I finally fold up the paper and lift the tray of biscuits off the table beside my bed. I peel the plastic wrap away, breathing in deeply as I pinch one and wave it in front of my nose. It smells delicious, just as Mum's biscuits always do, but I still wish I had a color to go with the smell.
His hand pulls away, and I'm left with a sort of satisfying feeling as Mrs. Hudson approaches me with happy chirps of congratulations. The rest of the hall rejoices in their own way, and my brother makes his way over to his assistant, the one with the ever-changing name, who is standing by the dessert table, ready to cut the cake which Mycroft has been eyeing for quite a long time.
There may have been a time where he would have lied, but he couldn’t do it to Molly; not right now. Her expression was honest and open, hopeful for an answer equally as genuine.
Post-John Sherlock, the one in the here and now, felt so incredibly small and faraway. He feared saying anything more. He would rather avoid the altercation from yesterday than ever broach the subject again.
John blanched at him, paper thin. “You don’t have to pretend, Sherlock. What I did was inexcusable.”
For as much as John’s presence sent anxiety and uncertainty rippling through Sherlock’s body, there was also nowhere else Sherlock could imagine himself. Either John and Rosie remained or Sherlock would return to living alone. It would be agonizing and lonely, but no one would ever be able to replace John. He had become a permanent fixture in Baker Street.
"Ah...should I tell him to call you back?" Greg shifts slightly as he holds the phone in front of his face, gaze lingering on the curtains above the couch.
business!" I grate out, my face contorting in anger, although I feel a seed of fear blooming in my gut. When I had walked out of my house this morning, my marking had been displayed proudly, but I tug my sleeve down now as Carver and Derek try and see it.
—when he had become so tentative in his relationship with John that he couldn’t predict the answer on his own.
“Sherlock,” John said, sounding exasperated. “No one intends to throw up. You don’t need to explain yourself—just go take a shower.”
“Thank you,” he said, tucking the plastic bags in his inner coat pocket. “It’s been a pleasure as always.”
So much for any chance at anything above a one-sided friendship. She saw the way Sherlock kept looking down at John's lips, the way John's head was tilted up to meet his.
Before she even makes it to her door, the detective and doctor barge in. Sherlock takes the steps two at a time as Mrs. Hudson tries in vain to shout after him.
"Speaking of markings," she continues, finally turning towards me. I already know what she's going to say: how
"Overall, just don't mess with anything unless told otherwise." His brown eyes peer up at me, and it almost looks like he's understood everything I've said. His front paws leave my lap and he sits obediently on the floor, continuing to merely look at me.
I shake his hand off of me as I gesticulate to the door again. "You should be off now; the British government can't stay out of commission for too long." I stiffly clap his shoulder, and he gives me a look that screams,"
"Thanks, Mrs. Hudson. I'll be sure to get him to thank you," he replies, grinning as he nods at her before ascending the stairs.
"Good," is all he breathes before he and Lestrade are trotting down the stairs, Mycroft's posh shoes clacking on every step. I sigh as I twirl to see them through the window, his ominous black limo parallel with the curb.
, trying to pull the steering wheel from him...and then..." Ella's eyes are right on me, intently examining all of me. I feel stripped, and cornered, and the feeling is not good. My whole face prickles, almost overly sensitive to the air.
If I must.
“Would you like some tea, dear?” said Mrs. Hudson, placing a steadying hand on his forearm. Her hand inched just a bit too closely to the crook of his elbow, but he resisted the urge to shake himself from her grip.
“I’m sorry,” he said.
I feel sticky as I see Bill's head above me. I feel like waving, but moving my arm just isn't...appealing.
"Unfortunately, no," I mumble, my smile morphing into a thin frown.
—————
Pulling his coat over his shoulders, he flicked up the collar. He ran his hands through his hair, pushing the fringe away from his brow, behind his ears. He loosened the scarf around his neck, feeling constricted by the fabric, as if it had suddenly doubled in size like a compressed towel in contact with water.
“Because I know how you feel.”
But okay, occasionally and usually quite by accident, we'll get it right.
“Lestrade needs me,” Sherlock would say, flicking up the collar of his coat like he always used to.
Smiling fondly, she sets the mugs on two saucers and carries her own with her as she trots down the stairs; the pair should be home any minute.
"Yeah...welcome..." She breathes a little shallowly as she turns on her heel for the door. Her hand raises in a meek attempt at a wave as she hurriedly rushes a goodbye and scurries out of the room.
It was all fine.
It was quiet for a moment. “For what?” said John, fingers never ceasing. “I told you already, the couch is nothing to worry about, not like we don’t have our chairs. Hell, the floor is working just fine right now. And I already put your clothes in the washer, so it’s really no—“
"Your frankly obvious displays of uncomfortableness point to such a conclusion," he says, quietly wishing that the good doctor would just leave him here to start the process of conversation deletion. It would be easier that way, for both of them.
“I’m sorry,” he said again. It seemed an inadequate apology, but he thought of nothing more fitting.
Suddenly, I hear a noise, soft and faint, somewhere far off but right beside both my ears. It sounds sort of like a wind chime blowing gently in the afternoon breeze, like the one we have outside our house. At first, I want the noise as far away from my thoughts as possible, but it's difficult to delete a noise so close to your ears and so pertinent to your life.
"To put it plainly, I finally observed." Sherlock raises a suspicious eyebrow, circumspect in his inspection of John's form. "It started three months ago," he says, depositing a tea bag in both mugs as he starts the kettle. The detective notices a spasmodic twitch in his fingers as he goes to retrieve the sugar container.
"John
The following day, Sherlock left the flat before John had even woken up. With no destination in particular, and no company of which to speak, he wandered aimlessly for some time. He passed Speedy’s cafe, hooked around the corner at Angelo’s restaurant, made his way through Regent's Park; all the while, he glanced furtively down at his mobile, waiting for a text or call from John asking about his whereabouts. It’s what John would have done once, scared and surprised by Sherlock’s absence.
“I meant for inconveniencing you,” Sherlock said past the lump in his throat. “I’m sure the last thing you want to do is take care of me while I’m in such a state. I really wouldn’t blame you if you went to bed. I know you’ve had a long day at the clinic, surely you haven’t eaten yet and probably just want to get to it.” He grimaced as the fingers in his locks finally stilled, body tensing beneath John’s calloused hands.
. Wonder why." He shrugs his shoulders again, adjusting his glasses as he goes to the door to greet the still shocked young girl.
finding water that
“Molly’s,” John responded simply. “I asked her to babysit today. Because we were supposed to go to lunch, remember?”
Greg shakes his head slightly, sighing as he reaches for the device. "Here; I'll give it to him. I don't need you riling him up. He's already wound up enough as it is." He really needs to get Donovan and Anderson to take some sensitivity lessons, at least, because this whole 'Freak' thing is getting out of hand.
As I twist the door knob, I look down to my wrist, see William scratched into my arm, and I roll up my sleeve, for all to see.
"He's...interesting, praising my work where others have endlessly insulted me. His facial expression reminded me of one of Gladstone's," I explain, trailing my fingers over Skully's cranium. Gladstone cocks his head at me from his place by the fire.
“Better for me,” John said, leaning his chin in his free hand. “I’m getting a bit too old. One day I’m afraid I’ll faint on a case.”
Mycroft smirked in that self-possessed and smug way of his. “A wise man never tells,” he said, wagging his index finger.
speed for a delinquently generous price.
What I mean to say is I'm sorry.
The worst ever? Only one?
Sherlock could barely conceal his surprise. “Oh,” he said with interest. “Anything,” he said, sincerity bleeding into his voice. Anything for family, mused Sherlock. He had told John he was family, hadn’t he? So why did he seem more distant than when they’d first met, when they had been simple strangers, barely flat mates, and only tentatively friends?
“Sure you’re alright?” John said skeptically.
I smile; today is good.
Maybe he’d gone a bit overboard. He had run back to the den behind Loretta’s, desperately clawed money out of his envelope, and doled it into Klaas’s awaiting hands. After all, he had offered smack
I just sit on my gray bed, staring at my gray notebook, in my gray bedroom, looking at the gray window panes, then at the gray cement, and the gray puddles on it, formed by the gray droplets of rain that are falling from the gray sky.
I turn to Bill, him showing a small smile as he trails beside the stretcher. There's still a dull ache in my shoulder, and the pain sometimes sky rockets, but I'll survive.
"You know what?" I announce, pulling away from her. "Forget about the cuff. I'll just...I won't cover it up...," I admit, and my mum looks at me softly.
...name as proof.
I lean forward off my bed, stretching my arms as I glance between Bill and the rest of the soldiers.
Sherlock, several hours later, was still draped over the couch. Goosebumps were raised along his skin, cold and tingling flashes trailing over his entire body. He felt nauseous, like something was sloshing around in his stomach every time he tossed or turned. After several hours with no vomiting, he had finally eaten some of the saltines Mycroft had given him and managed to keep them down. He drank some water too, even felt a little better. After that, he had pushed the bowl beneath the end table in expectancy of John’s arrival.
I'm grateful for his silence, but I'm not so grateful for my lack of supplies. "I'll need to go out; ah, dull!" I quickly ascend and go to grab my coat, the dog trailing behind. "I need bowls, food, a collar, a leash, possibly a bed..."
“Molly,” he croaked.
"Nicknames," I say simply, giving my brother a withering look as I rise from my chair. "Now, brother, if you don't have anything useful for me, I will be forced to evict you from my flat."
Sherlock was a difficult person. He had heard it said in a variety of fashions, on a variety of occasions, from a variety of acquaintances. To hear that it wasn’t something he had done seemed like a lie in and of itself. After all, John was the only person who could tolerate him. Shouldn’t he be grateful John had stuck around so long? The beating had been well-deserved, hadn’t it? He didn’t think John unjustified—if anything, he was lucky that was the only time John had ever assaulted him.
Please.
“Oh, fuck,” he purred, bowing against the vanity. Goosebumps raised along the nape of his neck. Before he lost his balance, he bumped his legs into the old and cracked porcelain loo, then collapsed on it. Head in his hands, he pulled gently at his hair, moaning slightly with the cocaine thrumming through his veins.
"Well, I, um, should get to, ah, school," I murmur, and she nods her head with a melancholy look in her eyes as I continue,"I won't wear the cuff, but, um, can I wear long sleeves?"
It was quiet for several beats before John spoke again.
Something warm and fond bubbled up in Sherlock’s chest, made his heart feel featherlight. He couldn’t help the way he sank into John’s lap with a new sense of relief, the way he let his eyes open again and train on the television. “Did you mean what you said earlier?” He didn’t elaborate, too afraid to: instead he worried at the fabric of his pajama bottoms with restless fingers and pointedly looked anywhere but John’s face.
John pursed his lips, shifted his legs, then settled his hands in his lap. He fiddled with a loose spool of thread on the hem of his jumper.
"I-" My voice cracks slightly, and I clear my throat, noticing the rays of light against the carpeted floor. "I turned out to...to be the one that made him crash. We-we were fighting for the wheel, and I
“Why…?” Sherlock slurred, trembling fingers running over the book’s spine. He fell back onto the lip of the tub, whole body trembling from a mixture of exhaustion and euphoria. “How did you get this? This is confidential information.”
21 February
I'll save that for another day.
Yes, he’d had his fair share of relapses, but he hadn’t wanted a hit so dearly as he did now in a very long time. He wondered if the rush might be different now than it had been just a few months ago—when he’d used in the aftermath of Mary’s death. If, perhaps, his veins would remember the surge of pleasure, or if they might simply collapse at anymore stress; if the euphoria was as captivating as he remembered.
Then, I glance down to Carver's wrist, and I see an opportunity.
"You might not want to go in there...," he murmurs, fidgeting, pulling slightly at his collar. Anderson gives him a look as Donovan raises an eyebrow, but he merely pushes past them.
"Come on, Myc," Greg sighs, patting his hand gently; I want to fling myself onto the chair across the room at the affectionate gesture.
My chair scratches, shrill and loud against the tiled floor. I stare down at her, her soft eyes looking at me with so much despair. The only thing I can hear is the constant sound of blowing steam, billowing and rising from the kettle's spout. It's making me uneasy.
“I have to leave,” he said languidly, tightening the coat around himself. He was afraid, if left to come down from the cocaine high in the presence of smack, that his self control would ebb away. He
." First name; she's serious.
"...By the way you describe him," Lestrade starts, "maybe it'd be in my best interest that me and Mycroft don't actually meet..." His tone is joking as he smiles gently at me, taking another sip of his drink.
“Bored?” offered Sherlock.
“Of course,” Sherlock said. He didn’t voice his offense, that John’s insinuation stung him deeply. “I adore little Watson.”
Later apparently meant
He scrubbed a hand down his face, from temple to chin, sucking his teeth.
thing...?" I wave my hand awkwardly, not used to more personal discussions such as this one. Mrs. Hudson's look turns wistful, a small, genuine smile curling her lips.
"I know I am," I state simply. I think the answer should speak for itself, but she still looks perplexed. "Mum said he had been drinking more lately; with that knowledge, I could've asked him about it, helped him."
(See the end of the chapter for
John smiled. It hinted at the warmth John used to show whenever he praised Sherlock; how he looked at Sherlock like he was the Sun and said his name like a prayer. It felt like old times, for a moment. Rosie was fast asleep, tucked in her bed; Mary, with some regretfulness, was no longer present; John and he were both living back in Baker Street. It was almost as if the past several years had never happened. Sherlock could pretend that they had somehow been living together peacefully for years, that nothing had changed since they first met.
In an attempt to quiet his own damningly persistent desire, Sherlock tried to refuse even thinking about anything so much as to do with soulmates. Mycroft and his parents all knew him to be petulant and stubborn as a mule; if anyone could accomplish such an insurmountable task, it would be a ruddy-faced and unruly Sherlock with his arms akimbo and the concentration of a flamethrower. That was what he told himself.
In that moment, he wished he didn’t have a heart with John Watson’s name inscribed on it—wished he had never met John at all. Wished for his old life where he thought he couldn’t amount to anything greater than what he already was.
The revelation of his soulmate’s name rotted and festered in his head. Too many questions remained unanswered, even after countless hours of pursuing his father’s collection of books. He suddenly and unbiddenly longed for someone’s company, and quite begrudgingly Mycroft came to mind.
