“Hydra?” he asked, Scott shrugged
“Sniper, 11 o’clock, sniper” Bucky warned, making him snap out of it and he moved making Tony get lower
“our report said the entire royal family was executed”
“No, I don’t” Tony said confusion and concern laced his tone, he frowned.
“Hurry up, doc” he said and followed the younger man, Stark waited for him outside, his clothes were well worn but clean, the boots were sturdy, military approved, his hair was a bit on the long side curling on his nape and forehead, the styled goatee gave him a flare of elegance and glamour, but he didn’t look like the rich kid in the magazines, he looked like a man, a hard working one at that, his sharp eyes found his and he felt like he could read everything about him just with that gaze
“I assume you have some kind of plan to get us out of here?” Stark remarked tone softer, he nodded
“What are you talking about, were in the middle of surgery” one of the women said with a british accent she must be one of the nuns
“everybody up, on Cap, now” Bucky said one the com.
“This is command” Fury’s voice came
“Me too” Sam said with a grunt
“how strong?! He asked pulling away the binoculars and handing them to Buck for him to see.
“Star one, has made contact, they are under heavy fire, and request immediate air support” she explained in rushed words
“Copy” he said and moved, two men were carrying another to throw it at the pile, he threw the shield the edge landing in one man and then bouncing to hit the other, Buck shot them and just like that the team was moving, precise movements and secured aim, the soldier began to drop like flies, he focused on the soldiers, there were 2 rebels gaming upon a teenager, he shot at one and the other drop too Bruce gun smoking slightly, they walked behind a house, one soldier holding down a woman, while the other two stabbed a man, Bruce shot one, and he threw the shield to the other two, Buck finished them for him, they kept going methodically towards the village, the other teams going at it too; they rounded up a small cottage, screams filled his ears, Bruce tapped his left shoulder and continued, stopping by the entrance, his jaw clenched and the his eyes darkened, two fingers and the signal to go, he shot the standing soldier and Buck pulled away his gun and picked up the man raping a young woman, she was no more than 16, arm circling the neck and knife going to the groin, the man let out a grunt of surprise, Buck kept the knife firmly on the man’s groin and with a swift movement of the wrist cut it, hand firmly clamped over his mouth muffled the scream of pain, then with just a movement of the shoulder the man’s neck snapped; she cried and held her torn clothes to her body, blood on her tights and the ground, she crawled away from them, terror and anguish on her eyes.
“What about the others?” Stark yelled concern in his voice
“Is this impatience has anything to do with SI contract over SHIELD’s?” he asked making Tony stop and look at him in surprise, the silence that followed was answer enough “we’re taking these people to the Bravo pickup zone, need 3 helicopters to take them out” he demanded his captain voice leaving no room for arguments.
“Zippo first, red team right flank, this way, edge of the clearing, wait for my go; silent and quick” he signaled Nat, Thor nodded at the command ready for what was coming next “gold team on me” he ordered Buck and Bruce nodded “Blue team left side” Sam and Scott nodded and moved “Hawkeye, eyes on the package” he said and moved to his position
“New mission?” Buck asked
“I don't have signal!” Sam yelled no far from him, he cursed.
find me on
“Secure the doctor” he said to Buck, who grabbed the struggling Stark
“Launch!” he yelled, while Sam repeated the request, he turn to look at Sam who denied “grenade!” he yelled and threw the grenade Nat and Buck threw theirs too
“Is that right?” Sam asked the glint in his dark eyes indicated trouble, he smiled in thanks when he handed him a beer
“черт возьми 1, it was only a panther, I swear if I stop for another one I’m going to kill it, sacred or not” came Nat’s rant on the com, he sighed “I’m gonna cross over” Nat informed them, but the loud sound of a gun been shot made him flinch, then Nat went down, the stillness of Tony by his side made him froze as well.
“Rhodey!” Was Tony immediate answer then a explosion was inches from Tony's side, he fell painfully over a fallen tree, for a moment or two he stayed there stunned and trying to get some air on his lungs.
“negative on extraction and evac, in the pickup zone you requested Captain that is why I’m actually calling” came the voice of an angered Coulson, he frowned
“What is that supposed to mean?” Stark asked tone gone dangerously low and cold
“Stand by to peel!” he yelled again “Buck get them out of here, now!” Buck nodded and grabbed Tony
So this is the last chapter people! Thank you for reading and following it :)
“Tony, tell your people to pack their things, we’re leaving” Buck said to Tony who nodded and kept his eyes to the ground, the people moved and they returned their arms, he saw how T’Challa held Tony’s hand just for Tony to pull away.
“Widow take us to Kenya at first light, we still have a tail” he ignored Bruce’s teasing comment and talked to Nat on his com.
“Valkyrie, Marvel, ready to engage, white smoke hostile 20 yards” the order came through the phone, then he heard the planes and saw them.
“You will defend yourselves if you’re fired upon; otherwise do not engage” Fury confirmed.
“They are asleep?” Hope asked with a sweet smile, Scott nodded.
The sun was setting giving a respite from the heat, they haven’t stop, they were behind schedule by half a day already and stopping now was just plain old stupid, but he could see the people go slower and even his team was getting tired, of course no one said anything so he kept pushing to get going.
“Motherfucker!” Sam growled anger flaring on his dark eyes, the muffled sound of a baby made Buck move to the left “look at your work, you piece of shit” Sam moved the man and made him stare at the trembling girl, then with a practiced move he stabbed the man in the stomach, Sam stabbed the man again and left him to die on the ground.
“Natasha, goddess in the front, believes is a girl, I promised I named the baby after her, when she saved my life in a mission in Budapest” he explained, Stark nodded and smiled
“Get your people ready to go now” he said exasperated and let go of Tony's arm more roughly than he should provoking the man to stumble a few steps, M’Baku was quick to steady Tony with a firm arm on his waist.
“All right Captain Rogers I’m all yours” Stark said tone cold and clipped, it made him ground his teeth in annoyance
“It’s gunship, it’s here to protect us”
“how long we got?”
“Something on your mind, Captain” Stark’s voice made him snap of his thoughts, he denied. “I see, thank you for doing this, for helping them too” Stark said with a warm smile, he didn’t respond so Stark let it go and kept walking.
“as if that ever had stopped us, punk” Buck said making him smile
“who else?” he asked, he saw the hesitance in Tony’s eyes “who else Tony?” he growled
“Tony, sweetheart” he said making the young man to blink and his eyes focus on him, soft whiskey colored eyes found his blues, god he was beautiful.
“Take us there Nat, we have a tail” he said, she nodded and began to change the course to go to Kenya, they didn't stop not even when it was dark and a even more difficult to see where they were going but he trusted his team to take them to Kenya so he stubbornly marched ahead.
“they have my daughter, please”
“To much sugar and that monstrosity of a castle” Bucky said with a smirk we all nodded the thing was huge and now that the kids were gone the adults went for a few rounds on it.
“I remember.  You were shouting at each other.”  Jarvis sighed and shook his head.  “Of course at that time Sir was shouting at just about everyone, and all the time.  He took his mother’s death rather hard, I’m afraid.”
That kinda put the pin back in everyone’s grenade.  Even Barnes was thrown by the curveball, though he was probably relying on his sniperface to cover the fact.  Fury tilted his head to peer at the scribble, which Clint could just make out, along with the date and phone number, and ... “Christine Everhardt did several stories on Stark’s kid before he died, didn’t she?”  Clint recalled.  “I think she was playing up the whole Prodigal Son of the Merchant of Death angle.  Pissed Howard right the fuck off was what it did.”
He’d done it.  He’d fucking done it!  He had mastered the Full Extension Tea Challenge at fucking last!
“Besides,” Clint gusted a deep, deflating kind of sigh, and flung one arm across Natalia’s ribs to curl over James’ metal elbow.  “I figure Rogers is fine.  He’s just out looking for what anyone looks for when they’ve lost everything; he’s looking for some sign of home.”
“Gossip is for regulars, honey.  You haven’t even bought your boy there a drink yet.”
“Sonofabitch,”  Tony breathed, and for a moment, Pepper was more than a little alarmed herself, but then the smile broke like sunrise across his astonished expression.  “Son of a
There was another pause, then, “Erm.  Ten minutes.  Less, maybe.”
Tony's thumbs rubbed at Steve's temples, his fingers flexing and curling against his scalp in a pattern that was at once soothing, and confusingly arousing.  "It's just I."  Tony shook his head, huffed a laugh.  "With you... all your..."  he freed one hand to take in Steve, knee to crown in one fluttering gesture.  "Look, I know we've both got our secrets here, and it's not like either one of us is expecting a ring out of this deal, but I need... um."  he laughed again, rueful as he leaned close to press their foreheads together and murmur, "I'd like to know your name first."
Tony kept that thought, and the hysterical laughter that went with it to himself though.  Twenty questions wasn't nearly enough to scratch the surface of all the rest, either.
*** Tony ***
Huh.  Didn’t
“This last one is a larger unit though, insulated battery, memory chip, active response protocols.”  She tapped at the map grid hanging in the air, turning it for a better angle.  “It survived whatever he did to the rest of them just fine, and according to its onboard, it’s been sitting in the same place since about 8:20 Friday night.  They haven’t moved in twenty four hours.”
***Tony***
He traced them reverently between his own for a moment before he raised one hand to his face so he could kiss the palm.  Tony made a hungry noise, rolled toward him, and that was all the encouragement Steve needed to deepen the exploration.  Tony gasped when he tongued at the eye of his palm, groaned when he nibbled gently at the heel on his way to suckle the sweet, thin skin over his wrist.  The other hand threaded back into Steve’s hair, anchoring him to his task in a way he couldn’t help but find soothing.
There was a beat of silence, some loud public rustle filling up the air until Steve coughed once, and sighed.  “I didn’t think he’d give it to you.  My number.  Fella who answered the phone sounded like a real hard case.”
“Love note from one of your students?”  she asked with a smirk as she turned the square over and spotted the doodle scribbled just where a seal would go  -- three concentric circles shaded cleverly in pen-scratch, surrounding a star.  “Someone knows what you like.”
"You didn't have a message box-"
In which the past is lamented, and crimes are not brought to light.
“Don’t thank me yet.  There’ll still be questions and rumors.  Stane’s kid will probably keep digging, and,” here he cut a canny, searching glance Jarvis’ way, “Army CID might not have made a big deal of the staggeringly high amount of morphine in Stane’s blood samples, but a Stateside judge might feel differently.”
, not dead.  This will was supposed to be a clue, telling us to find him, in case Howard couldn’t.”
“Didn’t look,” he answered, more Brooklyn than Moscow in his accent tonight.  “Too late for a retrieval anyway.  Left shoe was sitting on the front counter, right next to the register.”
And with that, he keyed in the tap-code on his hidden touchpad, shifted his balance just so, and stood.  The chair shifted and flowed around him until it held him erect -- tall and straight, and standing on his own two sturdily-braced feet.  He took that first step up, thrilling as he always did at how smoothly his machine moved with him, the balance perfect, the servos whisper-quiet, the range of motion elegant and poised as he swung around on the wide step and found himself face to face with Steve Rogers' open mouthed, unabashed awe.
He was still musing on that, distracted and more than a little grateful for it, when Steve let the shop door swing shut behind them, and asked, "Do you want a hand?  With the chair, I mean," he added in answer to Tony's perplexed look.  "Hill grade's not that steep, but it is up the whole way back."
“Hey,” he snared Steve’s attention just as he yanked his jeans down, and for a moment, when Steve’s cock sprang free, Tony completely lost the plot, because Holy Chrome, but it had been a long time since he'd literally had his mouth water for a nice prick.
That had been the last time Tony had let anybody see him naked.
“Yasha, that’s not-“
what Steve wanted, and by damn he was going to have it.
There was cream cheese in the bag, so Clint put that on one of the bagels, buttered the other one, and grabbed the coffeepot and a mug for Rogers, more or less ignoring the impromptu interrogation being set up behind him.  Until he turned to go, and found Natasha directly behind him, hands braced on her hips, and eyes fiercely calculating.  “You stay on Rogers,” she warned.  “If this is just a distraction...”
“No,” James said, not sure whether he was protesting or agreeing, “I can share each of you with the other.  Rogers... if he wanted-” he did not say,
And those terms by God were gonna include one damned night of freedom per week, even if Steve had to throttle somebody to make it happen.
“You wouldn’t have to fight it at all, if you’d-”
And maybe that was why Steve -- the Steve who never quite stopped being tiny, hungry, and furious, found the lip to answer back to that silent, panicked voice,
"We can wait,"  Steve began, with soft eyes and wry lips.  "I know you said you don't do hook ups until you-" He cut himself off with a grunt when Tony yanked him forward, one knee pressing between Steve's own, so that the denim-trapped bulge of his erection rubbed hard against Tony's thigh.
“Then teach it to me,”  Rogers chinned up to the challenge without a moment’s hesitation.  “I’m a quick study.”
to use it!
"I..."  Steve blew out the breath like a plume of steam into the night.  "I want to.  I'm just not sure I
***Tony***
Steve caught Tony’s hand and brought it back to his lips for a kiss.  “Perfectly,” he said.  “You don’t need money anyhow.  Not with Captain America on Blue Velvet hanging over there to watch every single thing you do.”
Tony yanked his hand back, flexing his fingers out wide on the table for a moment.  "It's fine,"  he bit out as Steve began to stammer an apology.  "It's... Don't.  Just let me..."  He snagged his glass, mostly ice now, with tea and sweet milk clouding the dregs, and tipped it back to slurp some of the ice between his teeth.  The crunch of it fracturing as he chewed helped Tony bring his heart rate back down to sane levels again.
He chuckled, leaned his metal shoulder into the wall.
“Sisters!”  Tony gasped, chest heaving.  “To their!  Did ... did he still have the-“
Hill chuckled, as if the joke pained her, but nodded all the same.
thing Tony needed in his life right now was a public squabble with a jealous ex lover, or a current lover who would ghost out of his life rather than ending things cleanly when the time came.
"Um, excuse me," Tony said, wheeling his chair close and nodding at the whiskey and soda he'd left waiting for him on the high top, "Aren't you kinda late?"  Which, granted, was probably not the smoothest line of approach he might have taken, but sue him -- he was entitled a little slack on account of distraction.
"Well maybe Cap never met an order he wasn't ready to buck," Tony allowed, sliding his grip down the smooth leather of the sleeve until he could snag Steve's broad, square hand,  "But I'm getting a feel for Steve Rogers that tells me he might sometimes like to not have to be the one in command."
Behind him, Barnes shifted, a burring rustle of vinyl on kevlar.  Phil smiled and took out his wallet.  “Not this time.  How much for two?”
“I ... have no idea what that is,”  Steve answered, halfway between adorably bewildered and annoyed.  Then the unmistakable hollow crackle of a loudspeaker announcement echoed over the line, giving it away.
“Actually, you aren’t,” she mused, tilting her pretty head to the side, as if she meant to draw him, and was checking her perspective.  “The bounty’s out for information leading to the recovery of your corpse.  But I suspect that handing over a live and breathing Captain America will probably loosen SHIELD’s wallet quite a bit.”
In the meantime, may I draw your attention to this Official Sciencey Research that says that feedback comments make writers write faster...? (Points offscreen)
“No,” Steve protested, deflecting Tony’s attempt to fuck with his hair again.  “I mean I knew you better than that.”
“Barnes,”  Fury’s voice came down like a wall, though he didn’t ever once take his eye off Rogers.  “Your point’s taken.”  He squared his shoulders to the front again, and continued. “And so is yours, Cap.  It’s about time you and me laid some cards out on the table.  You wanna start with why you’re using Howard’s phone to set up dates with reporters?”
“Oh, don’t worry about that.  The Widow’s on her way,”  Clint said, and as though summoned by the power of her handle alone, Natasha appeared at the kitchen door with three operatives and an analyst behind her.  “She’ll take care of the interrogation, and you and me can take care of breakfast.”  Clint didn’t tell Rogers that breakfast was also going to be a debriefing, but from the knowing look in that blue eye, he figured he wouldn’t have to.
“Fuck you mean, how am I doing?” he half growled and half snapped, Buck was not impressed by the way he lifted a single brow
“what?”
“Tony, come on, wake up, please wake up” the sound of groans and pain filled screams meant shit to him at that moment he wanted to see those brown eyes again, he wanted to look at them and stare for as long as he lived “come on Tony please, wake up, Tony please!” he begged desperately, then a frown appeared in his slack face, he grinned Tony was waking up, he was going to be ok; the gasp of pain Tony let loose made his hearth flutter in concern and relief at the same time, he was alive he’ll live were his thoughts; the barely there flutter of eyelashes made him grin, Tony’s trembling hand moved to touch his own head, when fingertips touched what it appeared to be a bump he winced and blood run down his nose, he moved his hand to wipe it off and then Tony opened his eyes fully, glazed and un focused but alive.
“Brucie!” He said dislodging from Steve arms and embracing his medic bro
“sir”
“How come?”
“stop, stop!” Tony yelled fighting Bucky’s hold on him, but then Bucky showed him the small transmitter making Tony still he pressed harder on the woman shoulder
“who knows what this is?” he said showing the transmitter “I took this off Kalá’s dead body, Doctor Stark good friend” he snapped and looked at Tony, he recoiled away from his words but held his stare eyes still glazed with tears then he saw his arms, peeled skin, on forearms and elbows, blood and dirt on them; he did that didn't he? when he pushed him; but he barreled on
“Fine, doctor”
“May I assist?” Bruce asked, Stark moved his gaze of him and turned to Bruce
"Swe'th'art, uh? Tony groaned out, he blushed he hadn't notice the endearment slip from his lips, but he nodded at the daze man "k hel’ ‘e up" Tony blurred he nodded and helped him up, he held much of Tony weight while he fought nausea his eyes were fixed on Tony but Tony was looking beyond him just to froze and then lurch forward he tried to stop him but then he moved with him, Scott was holding his stomach, blood coated his hands and he looked pale, Tony got to him before he collapsed, carefully he made him lay in the ground.
“Bruce, I need morphine” Stark said, one of the women stood behind them, she had a little boy who she put on the helo earlier; Bruce nodded and gave it to him, Stark removed his hand from Bucky’s and injected her the sedative.
“Stay here” he said and moved to Nat’s position just to see rebels destroying a small village “Ant-man, bring me Stark” he said in the com, and moved away from the view, he grabbed Stark hand who looked at him with concern “we’re going to rest here, stay down in these trees, listen to my men, ok?” he asked the man, Stark nodded and looked at him with determination “go” he said letting go of the warm hand, he looked at Scott and nodded “Winter, Falcon, with me” he said in the com and moved again to Nat’s and Thor position, Buck and Sam were quick to catch up “What you got?” he asked when he was between Natasha and Thor.
“Secure”
“it’s ok, they’re gone” he said, Stark nodded and stood and soon everyone else, he stepped out of the leaves that were hiding them, Kamala in his arms and soundly asleep now, Stark smiled at the toddler and rearrange the child in his arms for her to be more comfortable, he turned away from the scene to look ahead to their path.
1for fuck sake.
“ok, enough of this we need a plan to gain some time” Buck said making him snap out of his head and nod, but his brain was fried he couldn't think of anything; god he felt at lost .
“Because my orders are very clear, evacuate the priest, you and the two nuns, now please, get packed and get ready to move” he said tone filled with annoyance
“No wait, you need to stop them, they’re going to the mission” Stark eyes firmly on his, concern and fear clearly on them, but he found himself trying to searching  the same vulnerability he saw before, but it wasn’t there
“lets get this people to safety, lets finish the job” Bruce declared
“Get down came the yell from Scott, he was to slow to comply, a bullet logged in his leg and made him fall, Tony fell first back painfully landing on the ground, he landed next to him, there was a wheeze a grunt and then a deep breath, Tony was awake, blood ran from his nose and ears, the gash on his temple caked with blood and dirt, his chest bloody from the shards, the adrenaline didn't let him feel the pain on his leg but he knew that he needed to do something about it he was quick to turn and cut a strip of cloth to form a tourniquet around his tight T’Challa, was quick to help him too, he heard Tony throwing up next to him, but then his hands were on him and pulling the knot of the tourniquet
“What the he…”
“Sir, rules of engagement?” Nat asked.
“Cap, we could go around them to the north” Bruce said contained anger in his voice, he looked at his team, there was anger there, impatience in their eyes, while Hydra destroyed homes and killed and raped innocent people. Two soldiers were pouring gasoline on a man, while another two held a woman to watch him burn, a soldier approached with a zippo on hand ready to set fire to the man, he clenched his jaw and the screams of the woman fueled him, he grabbed his gun and began to put the silencer, the others were quick to follow.
“I am, I gave myself a few days, Lang invited me to the party, I was ready to call you but Steve told me you were set in attending so I waited” Rhodey answered with a pat to his head and a fond smile that made him regress to his college years in MIT, he smiled at the man that stayed at his worst and smiled at his best. He pulled away when Carol appeared and held his platypus hand.
“What you wanna do?” Buck asked, he sighed
“Winter, round them up” he said to Buck, he nodded
“mmm” Stark answered, they walked a few more minutes, he believed the talk was over but Stark surprised him once more “I… Steve” he said voice tentative and worried, he turn to look at him stopping his stride, Stark stopped with him, his name on his lips made him elated, whiskey eyes found his blues and held them “I want to apologize to you and your team, I’ve been nothing but stubborn and not that trustworthy” he said making him frown at the admission “you probably already know this but anyway I think is better to leave it in the open in case you don't; you see when Nick called I explained the…”
“Yeah, but Pepper let me go early”
Bucky was right he knew the moment they left the mission that those people were dead, but how did he respond to Stark when he asked to stop the men? By downplaying his concern, by just waving away the life of almost 50 people, his gut churned making him sick and still Stark had the heart to thank him for doing his job; for saving his life and the child in his arms, for making the people safe and taking them to Kenya, for promising that his people were going to be taken care of; maybe it was the guilt that eat him away inside, but Stark again didn’t blame him, he knew that he just followed orders and that taking his people was not one of them, he was drowning in pain and despair and yet found words to release him of any blame or guilt
“He is sure” he growled in frustration, Stark glared at him but relented and let Bruce help stitch the man up, he walked towards him and towards the exit removing the clinic robe, the latex gloves and the mask, he was shorter and lean, olive skin and if he let himself look a beautiful ass
“what about you Sam?” he asked, Sam looked at him and then at T’Challa who averted his eyes away and wasn't that something he hadn't see coming.
“What the fuck you think he said?” he snapped
“Now you listen to me Nick” Tony said, his voice was deathly calm and cold, it made him shiver and for the pale look on Sam and now Bucky he wasn't the only one nervous but he was sure he was the only aroused by the display of power in the young doctor “either you put three helicopters in the pickup zone the Captain has mentioned or you can say goodbye to that ostentatious computer program you call firewall, Jarvis already made it his bitch so don’t make me make the call and spill every single little secret you have; my lovely Pepper and my brilliant well paid lawyers are more than ready to drop more than a hundred lawsuits on your desk for the stunts you have put me through, hell even the air force is ready when you give the say so because this are your men and if the answer is still a negative one I can guaranty that SHIELD will be dismantled in his totality and sell to the highest bidder, and you won't even be able to crawl under a rock when Pepper and I finish with you, because as you well know at the end of tomorrow SHIELD is mine to take; now I’ll put the nice Captain Rogers on and you can ask him at what time and place the pickup will be held, it’s as always a pleasure to speak to you Nick” Stark finished and handed him the phone, just as he took it, Stark was calling someone on his own phone, firing quick words for him to pick up, Pepper and Rhodey were a constant that he could follow and few thing about the legal team SI possessed.
“Cap, win’er, ‘Ony” she said pointing at them, Buck smiled
“Cap, I have rebels inbound on our path” Nat’s whisper came through the com making his hearth pound with adrenaline and something else, he rushed to Stark side and pulled him away from the others
“We were in a hospital, I was helping a woman give birth when Hydra came in, Nakia and Limbani” he began but stopped dressing his wound, eyes watery and his voice wavered “they, uhm; there were too many Hydra soldiers and the rebels began to shot everything that moved, they tried to stop them to protect me and the woman I was helping but they couldn’t, Hydra killed them, they were dear friends of mine”
“I see, Captain, as you were” Stark said standing up and walking away from him, he sighed again and passed his hand through his hair in annoyance with himself.
“I thought you already knew, but I didn’t trust you at the time” he said voice broken but unapologetic; he growled in anger.
“Not in front of the kids! Jesus!” Clint exclaimed, it was his turn to show his tongue to the blonde, Steve laughed making him shake too.
Tony loved Kamala since her sick mother set foot on the mission, he took care of her on his free time, that is why Kamala is so keen to him.
“Keep the packages safe and take them to Kenya” he confirmed making the others smile and comply with the new mission, he sighed and looked at Stark who was talking with the others, it took 10 minutes to put 7 children, 2 wounded and elderly and a very reluctant teenager on the helicopter, in her arms Kamala was crying and stretching her arms for Stark
“Stand down Tony, I’ll cover fire for winter, on my mark!” he yelled to Tony who was inches away from Bucky, Bucky nodded and got ready to run, he turned and situated his gun ready to fire “now!” he yelled, Buck was ready, he ran and they shot what ever it moved, Buck planted the bomb and ran back Thor handed the other to him
“Steve, what’s wrong?” Tony asked confused and concerned making him snap to the man who was still holding
“Intel reports elements not far from your sector, Captain; conducting search and destroy of a US military unit” came Coulson reply, he cursed internally
“Alright roll them in ASAP” he ordered
“Hi, sweetheart” Steve's baritone made him shiver
“For god sake, Stark, you’re a stupid, irresponsible, immature, spoiled brat! A kid playing with people lives, I wonder what it takes to earn your trust, god I should have let you in that damn camp for you to ro…”
This is from Rhodey point of view so hope you like it!!
“No!” Tony yelled and began to ran towards the woman
“Go” he said
“it's to dangerous to send air support!” Fury snapped, he was not impressed with the man, now he got why Tony send the man to fuck off, he glared.
“Colonel Rumlow!” she whimpered making Stark gasp and recoil from the words, he frowned
“who told you to do it!” he yelled
“Star one, over” Sam clipped voice made him turn with a frown “can you wait one sir?” Sam asked and handed him the phone mouthing Fury, he sighed and took it.
“Tony is fine, you can move now, go” Scott said making Stark to move along with the others, he followed the man with his eyes and turn to look at Sam and Buck that were now in front of him
“Is just a kid, he is just a fucking child” came Nat’s voice anger on her tone
“Thank you, Thor”
(See the end of the chapter for
(See the end of the chapter for
“This people are going to drop in this heat” Stark pleaded, ignoring his forceful outburst; he choose to ignore him and looked at Thor
“he was just protecting T’Challa and the princess” Scott sighed
The trail became harder steeps and hills, but they kept going, he was focused on taking this people to the coordinates he send Fury, but he wasn’t blind, all of them were dead tired and they just got slower and slower in the heat and the nagging thoughts of guilt didn't let him alone, Tony followed their rhythm but was clearly feeling the heat and humidity and it was getting worse as hours passed.
“Tony, Tony! They have a huge bouncy castle can I take Kam, promise I will take care of her” Pete said with a wide grin, Kamala firmly in his embrace, he nodded “oh hi Steve! Mr. Lang this party is awesome!” The teen said, the quick smile and retreat made him sigh this kid was high on sugar and it hadn't even been 15 minutes since they arrived
“Eyes on” Sam confirmed, the team knew what to do
“what it is it?”
“I” came Scott voice.
“Can’t do that, Doctor” he said trying to regain some composure, he was losing his temper quite quickly for his liking.
1you need to go, we don't know if they are following us, at least you'll be safe, we will see you in Kenya
“Hey, so where is the birthday girl?” He asked when they pulled apart, Peter and Kamala had already went to the food and the other kids, even if Peter was 14 now he wasn't going to say no to free pizza and ice cream, he sighed.
“they have my daughter”
“Danger close” Nat voice came though the com, everyone kept moving and when they arrived to a safer zone, they went on ground and stilled, Bucky kneeled beside him just inches away from Stark, Kamala kept fussing and whimpering, Buck turned and made a funny face, making Kamala quiet in surprise and Stark to smile, the rebels kept walking on the trail passing them, but Kamala, fussed and whimpered, making them all still and Stark to hold Kamala protectively, one of the rebels stopped and made others to mobilize in search for the sound, he cursed internally, his team was ready to take the rebels out, but he was not able to guaranty the safety of the other people not even Stark’s not in this circumstances, the rebels approached, getting closer and closer with every step, one of them got closer and closer to their location the end of the barrel of his riffle just millimeters away from Bucky’s right temple and inches away from Stark face; they stayed frozen not daring to move, the man was to close any sudden movement and he surely will see them; he got ready to shoot his finger moving slowly to the trigger, if the rebel gave another step he would bump right in to Bucky and shoot Stark instantly; but the man stopped and regroup with the others and continued to walk on the trail, he sighed and turn to look at Stark, he was holding Kamala tightly and the kid had already gone to sleep, he stood and went ahead a few steps, Buck touched Stark shoulder
“Ugh,” the bundle of blankets groaned, levering itself up so Clint could glare at both of them, tucking one hearing aid in as he huddled and scowled.  “It is way too early for these Russian Dramatics.  You,” and here, he pointed one callused finger at James, “Take it easy on Tasha.  She’s not used to having nice things.  And you,” the finger moved to target Natasha, “Quit acting like James is something we stole.  If he was gonna dump us for Rogers, he’d have done that months ago.”
“People smile after they’ve talked to you,” Steve chuckled after a moment.  “Real smiles, not put-on, performance smiles.  It’s in the eyes, the difference.  And you...” he reached out, stroked a curl of hair off Tony’s brow, and let his palm linger on the curve of his cheek.  “You have kind eyes.  And beautiful hands.  I noticed your hands first off.  They look like a musician’s hands, or a painter’s, from a distance.” Steve dropped his gaze and his caress both to the hand Tony had left curled in his lap, lifting it gently, turning it to the warming light from the windows.  “Still do up close, but the scars and calluses show just how hard you work with them.”
“Why didn’t he do that earlier?” Scott asked confused.
“uh” Nat replied sounding amused “kinda like that”
“the white doctor and the Black Panther” she whispered he repeated the name, what the hell was that? He turned to look at Tony worried and in anger, but Tony was still on Bucky’s arms now trembling “I’m no killer, please” she said
"How dare you!” he yelled making the whole room freeze, the silence was deafening, he was ready to laid it to that damn incompetent asshole.
“Tony!” He yelled the sting of a bullet on his shoulder made him tumble over Tony's body, T’Challa crawled towards him.
The language is Xhosa, the traducción is at the end.
“Winter, hawkeye, status” he demanded on the com
“I have visual, is a small unit” Clint said on the com “2 feet from your position 2 o’clock”
“Yes sir, I understand”
“Doc, you need to come now” Buck voice carried by the com, he kneeled and put the very still baby that was on his arms next to the trembling woman, he caressed her face and wiped away the splattered blood, tears falling freely from his clear eyes, he had to look away from the scene, Sam was quick to exit the cottage, Bruce came running and saw the woman on the ground, he kneeled at the other side of the woman and covered her with a blanket, through the window he could see Stark and the others, his eyes found his and went to him, concern clear in his whiskey eyes, he arrived and spared a glance at him and then at the scene just steps away from him, he kneeled beside Bucky, and held his hand, the choked sob he left out made him clench his fists.
“This is Eagle one, my ETA, your location five minutes” came the answer in the com
“Rumlow and Tony have history, the later kidnapped Tony for weapons, Tony refused of course, after weeks of torture and rape treats he escaped with a flamethrower, Rumlow was lucky to get there out alive, his face was half burned, so of course Rumlow wants revenge and weapons now that they might have vibranium” he explained Coulson was ready to murder someone and Hill was trying no to show it; Jarvis wasn't that far off from his calculations and now with the new report of the team they had a set location; he looked at Hill and then at Coulson.
“Rogers” Fury voice made him snap and pay attention to his director
“she’s staying” Thor replied, he sighed knowing that they will be killed, Stark returned and grabbed her in to a hug
“Yes, they’ll push forward” he agreed and looked ahead his eyes found Tony instantly a few meters ahead talking with Nat his Russian impeccable just as his Wakandan, Italian and English, a well educated and raised heir not a spoiled brat as he believed; Nat had a small lopsided grin, mirth in her eyes as Tony spoke, she looked happy and carefree, hell she looked the age she truly have a beautiful 28 year old and Tony was smiling widely speaking with rapid words and hand gestures, then she laughed hard, she put her hand on her lips muffling her laughter and Tony, he giggled making her laugh harder, he couldn't help the smile that appeared on his lips, move forward indeed.
“we’re gonna get there right boss?” Scott asked, making him smirk and nod
“Tony” he began not knowing what he was going to say.
“Roger that” Sam and Buck answered, the later walking away to gather the rest of the people
“Thank you Captain” Tony said and moved away from him and walked away, yes his word meant shit to him and if was honest he couldn't blame him.
“Ma’m, I don’t think you realize what is about to happen here, you’re a nun, are you one of the nuns?” he asked when he received no answer he looked at the other woman “are you a nun?” he asked
“this is 2300 hours” he said pointing to our location and the rebels and Hydra.
“And we’re takin’ all these people out?” the query and reproach clear in his voice
It was getting hard even for them the heat got even worse, the sun burned his neck and face, his tack gear felt like a second very heavy skin and the heavy weight of their guns made him want to stop, but Stark kept walking, pushing and helping his people to continue, sweat visibly in his forehead and neck, his arms trembled now and then with the weight of the child in his arms, but he refused to let her go
“why would he?” Buck snapped hands balled in fists.
“Celebrating so soon? So American of you” The voice of a man above them assault rifle pointed at them, made them all still; they were out of amo, they were sitting ducks right now, they all turned to look at the man, he was tall and jacked; black hair and half his face scarred, no it was burned, Rumlow he must be, the rage he felt in that instant was incomprehensible, for what he could see he must be over 40 almost 50, so when he tried to rape Tony he must have been 30 something 40 maybe, damn he was going to kill this guy.
“It calms her, Kamala is a badass and please just Tony” he said hoisting the girl in his arms, Scott smiled
“He is so damn cute Barton, he must take after the ms Barton, no?” He joked making the marksman show his tongue, he smiled at the man, then strong arms surrounded his shoulders in a back hug, the clean smell of forest and sea salt made him smile and relax in the embrace
“Falcon”
“You did a good thing today” he said with a watery smile
“That is why they're being followed? Because of the prince?” Hill asked concerned.
“you’ll be fine, Kamala, go with Shuri, I'll see you there ok, baby” he said with a watery smile, he fought the impulse to go and comfort the man
“What did Fury say?” Sam asked
“I didn’t knew a Stark could get his hands dirty” Scott said making the group laugh.
“Thor, Doc?”
“come on Tony, we need to go” he said offering his hand to help him up, Tony took it hesitantly, that small waver made him feel even less that trash, but by the life of him he couldn't let go; he turn to look at the others who were busy following his orders.
“yeah, what you got?” He asked
“The president just signed the rights of this mission to Colonel Rhodes and Agent Phil Coulson, you are out of this mission and that chair, so I advice you to vacate the position and premises, this fine gentleman will escort you to your quarters where you'll stay until the Security Council revise your case and decide what to do with you” Pepper said with rapid efficiency and fire behind that pleased smile, god Tony better buy her the damn moon if that was what it took to truly please her, he shivered at the thought of Pepper truly pissed at someone, they had been receiving hourly updates of Tony’s position and convoy but there has been a delay of 6 hours now and he was getting worried and by the small tremble of Peppers delicate hands she was too, Jarvis was quick to determinate the advance of the convoy but that was just wild conjectures; not that he doubts Jarvis for a second but 6 hours and HYDRA’s army on their heels was to much for him to be comfortable, Fury stood and left the control room, two armed navy seals followed him, he sighed and looked at Pepper.
“Cap” Sam said, he turn to look at him and just saw Buck run towards them a smirk clear on his face.
“That is not part of the mission, Captain, bring Stark alive and unharmed
“You know Captain; you have this face that screams kicked puppy in another new level, you ok?” Stark voiced made him snap of his thoughts, he nodded
“clear” Clint said and they nodded, he looked back and what he found made him clench his jaw and fist his hands, blood, trees askew and broken, body parts and bodies thrown haphazardly on the ground and no sight of Tony, he moved quick and began to run, the others no far behind, forming a strike line.
“Tony, and nope, but I have a godson Peter, who I spoil rotten dose that count?” he asked with a smile, Clint smirked but denied “you have kids?” Stark asked
“Roger that”
“Now now, were is my precious little doctor uh?” The man asked the lear and treat in his voice made him want to rip him to pieces, he wasn't going to even get closer to Tony to even see him, Rumlow pointed the gun at Nat the loud bang made them all still.
“Cap rules of engagement” Nat said
“come on lets go” Buck said to the others.
“take cover captain” Rhodes said
The camp was quiet in the early hours of the morning, the sun wasn’t up yet, when they got there, his team ready and alert to any indication of danger, a woman approached the lake they were currently waiting in, she kneeled and was about to fill a bucket, the swift movement to capture and silence her was precise and easy, she was trembling in his arms
“It wasn’t about saving your life” he said Stark eyes widened in surprise and hurt then just in mater of milliseconds the walls were up “it’s getting the job done, completing the mission, that’s all” he said, there was hurt and something else in there, something that he couldn’t place
“We got a problem, we got possible hostiles on our six, get them up, get them ready to move” he ordered, Buck nodded.
“All right doctor give me a minute” he managed to get out, Bucky and Sam now standing next to him
“Doesn’t matter, is a mission, so hurry and lets go, the sooner we go the sooner will be back” he said standing up and going to get prepared for the debrief he heard some groans in his way out but he paid no mind, at the end they were going to follow orders if it was important for them to go, they’ll go. He and his team has being waiting in the debrief room for at least 10 minutes when Fury finally arrived with Hill and Coulson.
“30 platoon strength, maybe more”
It wasn't easy be with the ex marine, not after getting back from Wakanda, he was getting updated with what he had missed in SI, Kamala adopting papers and the fallout of SHIELD and how they wanted Steve to be in the chair, and still go for missions but Steve had decline altogether and was in plans of opening his own diner along with Buck and Sam; so getting time to go on a proper date was a challenge but Steve had asked and he had say yes and they were happy now, still balancing their times and schedules; but he was happier than ever.
“Non posso crederci, sto parlando a un cazzo di muro, mi succede per non ascoltare Rhodey e mandare Fury a fotterlo 1” Stark half yelled half growled storming away from him letting him stunned for a few seconds, the roll of the words made him stir something in his core and goosebumps flared in all his body “you’re right Captain” the change in Stark tone made him turn and look at him, his head held high and his shoulders thrown back, eyes gleaming with rage and confidence, it made him want to take a step back “is not your problem, it is my responsibility, and I will not leave without my people!” he stated voice cold, terse it made him recoil internally by the strength behind those words.
“What’s our escape and evasion plan?” Buck asked next.
“Dr. Stark, could you come with me for a second, please?” he asked tone clipped, holding Tony arm and pulling him up and away from the two males “thank you, it’ll just take a second” he said looking at the two males, who just stared at him and looked at Tony in concern, he hold the sneer that wanted to come out, Jesus he was loosing it
“You ok, God please tell me no one is dead” Tony said kneeling and fretting over them.
find me on
“Winter, yes that is right Kamala” he said, Phil was smiling but when Kamala shifted and Tony winced the smile dropped from all of their faces
They managed to advance just a few miles shy of the border, they were so close but they stopped at Nat’s order to hold, the sky was cloudy making them take a respite from the blazing heat, the smell of rain filled his senses and the crunch of footsteps made him turn to the source of the noise, Tony was at his side eyes wide in concern and lower lip between his teeth, the wild staccato of his hearth wasn't related to Nat’s hold signal, he prayed for everyone who was listening that the proximity of Tony's body to his never faded, that he could be by his side for the rest of his life; the man beside him has clearly stolen his hearth and sanity with it; the small intake of breath that his mouth did when brown eyes landed on his made him choke, he hold it for the sake of silence and not his embarrassment if Tony noticed he didn't pointed out, he gulped nervous when Tony got closer to him, chest pressing on his shoulder the heat and the thumb thumb of Tony's hearth making him lose himself in the warmth and just forget everything around him, for just those blissful seconds they were alone, just Tony and him, his mind conjured images of how he wanted that pressure, that heat and intimacy.
“Copy that, let the others know” he said with a nod, she smirked and stood
“I count 13 so far” Nat said
“Steve” Tony answered dazed.
“Captain” Tony said making him turn to look at him, his eyes were still murky, Tony moved his hand away from his and his gut churned in agony and despair “I should have told you about T’Challa and Shuri, I’m truly sorry it was never my intention to put the team and you in danger, I thought that Nick had told you about them, when he called I explained the situation to him, why it was important for them to be protected” he said voice broken eyes downcast “God, if something happened to anyone, your team, this people that's on me; fuck you're right…”
They had to run, to the border there was no way they could hold them off, they were outnumbered, outgunned and they had to loose way more than the other side; they still had no answer from base and it was making him anxious, he has lost sight of Tony and that is making him distracted the graze of a bullet on his shoulder is proof of it, his team often reported of their status, the people they had been protecting was diminishing quickly but they kept retreating to the border, gun fire heavy on their backs, Bucky and Clint hadn't responded to their coms.
“Your staff should be frightened, you got any idea what those soldiers and rebels are going to do to you and those young women when they come here?” he snapped making Stark flinch and the women recoil in fear, but his eyes held his, challenge in them, he wasn’t going to go with him until he finished, he turned to Bruce “maybe you can help” he said, Bruce nodded
“Goddamn this fuckers!” Buck cursed
; I will not leave without the indigenous personal” the anger in Stark voice made him stop completely and look at the man in front of him, truly look at him, the presence he exuded was equal if not even more dangerous than Fury, and it wasn’t false bravado either it came from true strength and hardship, what this pretty kid know about hardships, of hard work, of saving lives of responsibility?, he’s just a clueless rich kid playing with daddy’s money he clenched his fist and growled his next words in the kids face.
“Yeah, I second that” Sam said making Buck nod
As hours passed the people were getting slower and even Stark mood was changing to animated and concerned to just plain tired, he sighed but kept going
“It’s my watch doctor”
“the fuck was that Steve?” Bruce growled at him eyes ablaze with barely contained anger.
“she is my friend!” he yelled eyes glazed with tears
“we need to rest, Steve, we can’t continue like this, and you know it” Tony said voice calm and soft, just a few steps from him, he closed his eyes and took a deep breath ready to send him away and ahead “just till morning, sleep, recharge and we’ll continue” Tony pleaded, he made the mistake to turn and look at the young man who look back at him, eyes wide hope and exhaustion clear on them, he looked up to see Buck listening, he arched and eyebrow in question, Buck nodded, they were all tired and it was really dark.
“I think were fucked any way we go” she said with a sigh “we back track, cross downstream, come up and go through the jungle and rip right into Kenya just through from the Tadjile Passage” she explained, he nodded at her plan.
“And they want Tony, ransom?” Coulson asked he denied
"Nope," Tony said with a firm headshake as he dug out his phone and unlocked it to engage the chair's Micro RT propulsor. "People being right up close behind my chair makes me cranky.  I'd rather you walk in front."
to answer the question of which side of a flogger Adonis (Neddy's nickname for him) preferred.  Mr. Thursday Night (Tony's nickname for him, and one he clung to ferociously so as not to accidentally call the man something that would out him for the enormous nerd he'd spent decades trying to pretend he'd never been,) had allowed the stamp, and had bought the whole place a round that night, but hadn't gone near the back stairs.
“And if I did ask you to do that, you’d feel bound to go along with me and make sure I didn’t touch anything dangerous too, wouldn’t you?”  Rogers’ voice held a deeply bitter note, but he still took up the plate and led the way across the lawn, as if he didn’t have a doubt in the world that Clint would fall in behind him.  Either that, or he was fed up enough to just kick his way into the garage and find the secret door to the underground workshop on his own.
Not what Daisy would’ve called a fair assessment, but she bit her lip and made like a hole in the air.  After all, it
From Ghostface -- Comin in hot.
a refreshing thing to find in the White Eagle?
“Like that?”  Steve asked once Tony let him speak.
old fight, she chose a newer one.
It was a heady rush of lust Tony weathered then, propped over Steve's thigh, tugging long, moist strokes along that beautiful cock when he wanted, so badly wanted to set his teeth to the curve of Steve's hip and bite down hard.  He knew, he just knew that Steve would rise to it, all shock and shivering wonder in his voice as the pain drove his pleasure higher, maybe high enough to break...
“Until they aren’t,”  Jarvis agreed, and both were silent for a long moment.
Ah hah.  “SHIELD’s wallet,” he asked, “or Hydra’s?”
“Stop,” she said, all teasing gone from her voice as she backed up and sighted the gun on his face.  He stopped, and noted with some interest that it took her several seconds to find that teasing grin or hers again.  “You might have gotten away with it, you know,” she said at length, “I might have just thought you were weird, coming in in Armani to buy tee shirts, jeans, and Chucks, but I wouldn’t have really remembered you.”
In which a call is made, a call is made, and a phone book is consulted.
he was.
she answered him as he’d spoken, only the ghosting light’s play over her hair making proof that she’d moved even enough to speak.
!  That tiara is so totally mine!”
No way in the world.
And oh look, there went the core muscles.  And his still slightly bruised thigh muscles.  And his belt-striped glutes. And some deeper muscles that had nothing whatsoever to do with climbing a rope, but a lot to do with really wanting to climb a stone cold hearted, cruel as ice and twice as lickable smartass, toppy jock right where he stood…
"Hey, no,"  Tony answered, his hold on Steve's hair gentling to a broad palm, a spread of fingers that steered him in close enough to kiss -- one whelming press of lip to lip, tongue to tongue, and then a rain of sweet, quick pecks across Steve's cheeks, his brow, his eyelids.  "No, you're good, you're so much better than good.  You're amazing at that, and I want more, I promise."
As always, thanks for the comments!  I know you don't have to, but I'm glad for those of you who take the time!
And Tony sat back at that, unsure of what he could say besides, “huh.”
It was then that Steve threw his shoe at her, clipping her hard across the temple as he flung himself backward in a roll.  The gun thudded once as she fell, but then he heard it skitter across the tar-paper and clack to a stop by the brick ledge.
Rogers sat back in the seat and folded his own hands over the desk. “I met someone this weekend who probably shouldn’t have survived what he did, and it got me thinking about all of us,” he waved a hand to take in more than just the four men in the workshop.  “If any of our people went missing, we’d be damned sure we had a body before we wrote them off.”
Cheers to all my along-the-road cheerleaders.  I value each of you beyond rubies, and if you'd like to come and hang out with my multishipping, multifanfom, semipolitical semiaesthetic semifashionista mongrel of a blog on
Daisy thought, trying not to wince.
Steve flexed his hand on the banister, felt the slightly grubby smirch of a hundred years' trailing hands stick and skid beneath his own.  He focused on the flex and thrust of Tony's ass and legs, and the smooth way the machine around him worked with his movement, as if he was wearing it like clothing, rather than it carrying him.   It was brilliant.  Tony was brilliant -- half an hour's conversation with the man was enough to work that out.  And the way he looked at Steve, as if
Behind him, Clint heard Barnes take a sharp breath, and a hesitant step toward the desk.  “Steve?” he asked, wary and worried.
Steve gave a shudder and a look of experienced horror when Tony mentioned the poultice, and cleared out of Tony’s way to let him get back into his mobile chair again.  But then he dropped back to the sofa once more, as if it was important to him that they be eye to sober eye for this one, and said.  “Can I... Can we do this again sometime?”
“You still have eighteen months to contest the will,” she protested, frustrated and angry, despite her intention not to be.  “I was at the reading, and it said explicitly that if Tony Stark showed up to contest within three years of Howard’s death, the entire estate would revert to-”
Steve did as she asked, mostly.  As his path took him by the streetside facade of the building, he hesitated, peering down.  “Huh...”
something Tony expected to hear from a man who owned at least 3 custom made suits, but Tony let that slide.
Steve laughed at that.  "Nothing so simple, I'm afraid.  More like I'm AWOL and keeping a look out in case I need to take off and lead the MP's away from you."
Then he hung up, steamed and frustrated and entirely too inclined toward feeling sorry for himself.  But no, just... no.  Tony Carbonell was a real name, and he'd given Steve a real number to reach him, and a man didn't bother with that if he wasn't open to at least an invitation.  Steve Rogers had fought his way past 5 different army doctors with their red 4F stamps, past Gilmore Hodge and Chester Phillips and two hundred USO shows to get what he wanted!  He wasn't about to let one nosy old secretary stop him going for it now.
"No, he signed up to fight a war,"  Tony countered bitingly, "Some dumbass Senator decided to
Steve shifted uncomfortably, but held his gaze when he looked up at last.  “I wouldn’t.  Not if you really didn’t want me to help, I promise.  It’s just that if a place like this had been here in New York when I was a kid, I’d have-”
"He lost
Instead, he took a deep breath, and pasted on a smile that felt like it was in the neighborhood of genuine.  "Well, I might've been raised by assholes in the wild," he admitted.  "And in periods of stress, I've been known to revert a bit.  Sometimes I even bite."
At which Tony clucked his tongue regretfully and said, "Performance issues.  Y'know, one in five men..."  Then he was laughing through the silencing kiss, and staggering along as Steve forcibly marched him away from the sofa and into the open door of the bedroom.  The walking chair manouvered elegantly, even backward, and if not for the solid framework around Tony's hips, and the soft whine of servos activating with each step, Steve might almost have forgotten it was there.  Almost.  It did offer really fantastic hand grip options, after all.
we were then.  I’d like to see him again.  I know,” he held up a hand, fending off Jarvis’ reply.  “I know he must’ve suffered like hell in captivity -- I’ve seen guys come home from that shit, and I know it’s hell and then some, and maybe he won’t wanna see anybody that reminds him of that, but... Will you tell him anyway?  Just tell him that I miss my friend, and I want to see him again?”
Clint sighed, slipped his phone into his tac suit pocket, and leaned back over the ledge.  “Hey Cap?” he called.
Not that he hadn't been invited.  Just about every week since he'd turned up, and usually more than once or twice a night, too.
Steve winced and glanced down, like he'd forgotten what was on his feet, then he cut that glance over Tony's hand, weighted with something tentative and shy, and goddammit, how was that even fair?  "Come on, Captain," Tony urged, leaning over to grab for the man's sleeve and tug.  "Prove you can follow orders, and get up here!"
“Where the hell did you get that car, and didn’t they have one in your size?”  Clint blurted, jamming his feet into flip flops as he hit the gate release.
It shouldn’t have been a revelation.  Tony had his own way of wrapping himself up in his genius like a suit of armor, and using it to buzz circles around anyone who wanted to get too close to the scars he'd rather the world didn't know about.  To blast holes in anybody who wouldn’t take the warning and back off.  He knew a thing or two about deflection, but... but there was something enormous about Steve doing it, some vast and secret thing Tony couldn’t, for  all his genius, get the shape of straight in his head.
“You’ll be on leave for her birthday?” Stark asked tone a bit off
“How you doing?” Buck asked, stare blank, he cringed inside, he hated when Buck called him out, he turned out the com from his end, just like Buck did before he asked, he glared but remained silent, yes stubborn was his third name, but Buck was as stubborn as he was if not even more, the glare that followed his every step made him twist his insides
“You know I…” Stark began but stopped and sighed, he turn to look at the man and Stark look up at him, the vulnerability he wanted to see before was there now, his eyes pools of sentiments laid bare for him to see, he stilled at the knowledge that Stark was beginning to open up to him, his gut clench with guilt “thank you, for saving my life” he said tone warm and open, he denied
3 months later…
“No!” T’Challa snapped when he tried to pull him up “No don’t touch him!” he yelled when he tried to pull M’Baku’s body away from T’Challa’s grasp
“hey!” he yelled making the woman look at him
“all right we’ll keep you advised if the situation changes” Coulson said and then hang up, he sighed and gave the phone to Sam
“what do you think?” he asked her
“Dr Stark, I’m Captain Steve Rogers with SHIELD, we’re here to take you and your people out of here” he said making Stark turn and look at him
“roger that”
“Roger that” he said to Nat and went to Scott who was looking at the tracking tablet “What you got?” he asked him
“All right” he said, moving to take out his guns and tactic gear, Tony helped him remove every layer with quick movements and in silence, Tony’s face was so close to his, that he could count his eyelashes and notice the freckles on his tan skin, if he just lean a few inches they would kiss, he stilled himself and prayed that the darkness covered his flaming skin, the way Tony removed his layers felt intimate, familiar, just right, as every piece that was left on the ground he felt freer, looser, he sighed when Tony touched his skin, his hands were warm and tender on his skin, every caress made him feel alive, his eyes never left Tony’s, the whiskey dark and gleaming with something, his blues were captivated by them, then Tony lowered his eyes and began to open the medical kit by his feet and began to work, he couldn’t stop staring it was entrancing the way he moved, the way he touched him, he wished , he knew more, to have more of this man.
“after what we did?” Clint asked next
“roger that”
He considered himself to be a patient man, it took to much to rile him in to blind anger, or annoyance yet here he was trying no to lose it when in presence of the most asshole to ever asshole and wasn’t that something Tony would say?, god he misses his very young brilliant best friend.
“We're behind schedule, come on” he said
“No, a small party came with me, they didn’t make it” he said
“Hawkeye” he said, Tony moved away from him, Clint shot her in the shoulder making her fall and scream in pain, he moved to get to the woman, Buck, Sam and Bruce running ahead of him
“It’s ok, not gonna hurt ya, ‘m here to help” Buck said voice going soft, knife kept away; kneeling in front of her and hands up, the trembling girl pulled away and clenched her torn clothes, Buck looked around and found a shirt nearby, he grabbed it and put it on the trembling girl “khu selekile, ukufihla1” Buck said, making the girl nod, Buck stood up and they moved away from the cottage, they entered another one just to find 3 men, stabbing a man, laughing about it, they shot them and kept going, just a few yards away from the main village was a large cottage 5 soldiers were making a dozen of people sing and dance for them, two bodies already on the ground, Buck shot two in consecutive order he shot one, Bruce another and Clint finished with the last one.
“God bless your path” the priest yelled
…He just stayed put a fixed point in the mission, deliver the rich kid to American soil, that’s it, complete the mission no questions asked and be damn who ever put himself in front of him trying to stop him…
“let’s go, Tony” Thor indicated, pulling him, he took Kamala from his arms who started to cry, Thor gave it to the young male that helped him before, then pulled Stark towards the chopper
“what?”
“you got it bad man” Bruce teased him
“Star one, this is Iron Patriot, star one respond” he said in the com and waited for a response, there was non “star one, this iron patriot, please respond” he asked again silence his gut churned “come on, comes on; star one this iron patriot please respond” he said to be met with silence, he was getting closer to the last point he could see smoke “come on god damn it, star one this is iron patriot, respond”
“We have at least another two hours, the explosives took half their troops” Buck reported as soon as he got closer to him, he nodded
“Cassie is enjoying the bouncy castle in the back yard, give me that, you shouldn't have you know” Scott said taking the big bag with the gift, he waved away his concerns and smiled, he followed the men and gave little Nathaniel a poke in his pudgy belly with made him gurgle and give him a toothless smile.
“What Steve, If Anthony had informed us about the prince and princess would anything have changed? Would we have helped them? Left them behind, kill them?” Thor tone left no other option but to answer the truth, and what was it exactly? He was ready to answer with a ‘I don't know’
“Cap, you’re going to want to come take a look at this” Nat’s tone of urgency made him stop Tony mid word with a hand gesture
“glad to see you still got it, but we got trouble” Scott said pointing to the tablet, he nodded and sat, his eyes glazed at the sudden dizziness “you all right?” Scott asked when his movement were still a bit slow and groggy, his body was resenting his choice of bed and treatment in this mission in other words he was dead tired and sore.
“The man was thanking you Steve, the answer to that is your welcome, not the bullshit you spit at his face” Buck reproached him
“let her bleed out” he snapped, Buck returned him the transmitter and he walked away, Tony walked shakily to her, Buck stayed with him and he stopped to listen
“I don’t know” he replied honestly, there was no motive for them to be followed, they haven’t cross path with the village they raided yet, so why? “but we’re going to find out” he said looking at Tony talk with the two males from before, smile wide and eyes bright, the two males looked at him fondly, his jealousy flaring in his gut yet again “good job, keep an eye on them” he said, standing up
3”Wakanda forever
“no, we would have tranq him and kidnapped him” Buck replied to Thor’s question before he could voice his thoughts on the matter, making Sam nod and sigh, he deflated and the anger he had vanish leaving him cold and shivering, the words he used and spat at Tony made him churn in shame and anger at himself.
“You all do, come on” Phil said helping them up, Tony helped him up
“heavy fire, no longer an option, we need to take them to Kenya” he said
“AC/DC, doctor?” Scott asked Stark when he walked beside him, Stark smiled and shrugged
“Saves him right”
“You fucking knew didn’t you?” he growled making Tony stop and stare at him, he held his eyes “you knew Tony will do anything in his power to help T’Challa and you fucking set him up with me because you knew that I would have completed this mission no mater what the cost! What is it for you Fury when Killmongrer killed the right heir to the throne?” he yelled there was silence on the line “you are even worse than Pierce and he is the fucking leader of Hydra!” he yelled “I’m taking this people to Kenya with or without you fucking help, and so help me god, I will see your fucking resignation on my bloody desk in the triskelion! Now I need the air support for this, make it happen!” he growled and hanged up, Tony stared at him stunned, he moved the few steps that distanced them, but Tony's eyes widen in fear and looked down and walked away from him, he clench his jaw in anger at himself his gut churned in shame, he did that he made Tony fear him and God if that didn't hurt and made him feel like punching himself in the face.
“Hawkeye, get eyes on”
“Fury will have a fit” Nat said besides him, he shrugged
“Think hard, damn it” he growled
“Tony!” he yelled looking at the bodies, his eyes landed on Tony behind a fallen tree and pressed under a bloody body, he moved to him, pulled away the body without a care and found an unconscious Tony, eyes closed and blood running from his head, he pull him toward his chest there was no resistant from the slack doctor.
He was nervous, the Langs had invited him to Cassie’s birthday party and he had bought her a Barbie set with a house and a convertible, the lady in the store said it was what every 7 year old would want, Kamala was smiling at him from Peter’s arms, the toddler was infatuated with her big brother, the Parkers were more than happy to let Peter babysit and stay with him for the summer break, he smiled and knocked in the door, a few seconds later the door open revealing Clint with a baby boy in his arms, the smile was blinding and made him lose some nerves.
“Shut it! I’m sick and tired of your bullshit Nicolas, bring someone that has more than a neuron to talk with, you are just waisting my fucking time and endangering the life of your team and my best friend!” he growled
“so much for diplomacy” Sam said looking at the phone, Fury was compromised that so much power can change people for sure.
“not sure yet, hold” she reported, he waited and looked at the people gathered and his team who were waiting for the word of what was it, five minutes passed in complete silence waiting “a panther leaped from a tree that’s what I saw, let’s keep moving” Nat said, he nodded and give the signal to continue, he was expecting a frown, a groan or something from the clearly tired doctor, but nothing came, instead he smiled to the child and carry her again, the child began to fuss, but Stark quickly began to hum something making the toddler lean in to hear better and settle peacefully in his arms.
“hey, hey!” he yelled grabbing Tony by the waist and pulling him to his chest, Tony struggled in his grasp, fear in his eyes
“mhm” Nat said with a smirk
“let’s go, now, come on, you’re first” he yelled grabbing his hand and pulling him toward the chopper
The village was gone, fire, blood and scattered bodies persistent on his view, the smell of cooper and rust lingered in the warm air, the stench of burned flesh and hair made him gag and just like that the rain began again, heavy and constant drops of cold water, it almost felt like the earth was mourning what just happened, he felt useless, lost and in rage the world raging of the violence of the coup and how people were treated in the jails, where in the outskirts the violence was even worse, how many nursing mothers stayed in that mission, how many children? There wasn’t anything that he wouldn’t give to turn back time and kill those men, to demand those damn choopers and take all those people to safety, Scott was holding the kid he saw earlier, bloody and unmoving, he looked away from the devastation of the face of a father holding a dead child, of a mother mourning her lost family of the lost and scared faces of the children that had nowhere else to go, he stilled himself and cleaned his tears away, this people deserved peace, safety and he was damn sure they will have it, he was going to take them to the border and to Kenya, resolution firmly in place he turn to look at his team , scattered looking for survivors and helping them to arm themselves.
That tore a groan out of Steve that Tony could feel in his balls, but then he sucked in a deep breath, swallowed hard, and met Tony’s eyes with a shakily determined stare.  “I’ll do my best.”
Things were different now though.  Laws were different.  There was no reason he had to do without and make do with wishing now.
“Other than that,” Tony went on as he began to work down the buttons of his shirt, “It only bothers me when I do parkour.”  Steve opened his mouth to ask what the heck parkour was, but Tony pressed a gentle finger over them first.  “So to answer the question you probably meant to be asking, yes, you may touch my legs.  It won’t hurt me.  In fact...” he lay back suddenly, used his elbows to hitch himself fully onto the bed, and then turned to regard Steve like a brazen, beautiful Odalisque.  “I strongly endorse the idea of you touching my legs, as well as whatever other parts of me as might strike your fancy.”
“I’m betting that list would start with Jarvis, and go on through just about everyone you know, Tony,” she answered.
Tonight, for reasons that surely made sense to the misfiring neurons somewhere in his lizard brain, Tony was letting the most perfect specimen of manhood he had ever laid eyes on take off his pants.  No, not letting -- Tony was asking him to do it.  Asking this beautiful, funny, sweetly snarky man to reveal all his damage to the light, to look his fill, to
And now the help had gotten all… complicated.
And after that, it was all a matter of hanging on for dear life while Steve Yes-Really-Named-After-Grandpa Rogers proceeded to pound Tony like he meant to drive him through to the ground floor.  It was staggering, it was terrifying, and Tony thrilled with every second of it, adrenaline and lust singing in his veins, making him feel more whole, more vibrantly alive than he’d felt for years.  Heart racing, lungs straining, every muscle, every nerve in his body focused on meeting that strength, pacing that speed, opening himself to the potent memory of how goddamned good it could feel to let someone give him this.  Steve was a relentless force of nature above, around, inside him, keening a high, tight whine in his throat as he fought to control himself with every potent stroke.
“Relax,”  Natasha sighed, and tossed the blankets over him.  “Nobody’s insulting his manhood.  They’re just nervous about SI.  Until they figure out the link between Stark’s son disappearing and Stane going AWOL in Afghanistan, the analysts are gonna be jumping at shadows over there.”
Tony moved slowly, careful as a cat picking its way across a cluttered table, but there was something in the act that seemed like permission, even an instruction to look his fill, and get it over with.  So that’s what Steve did.
The Bouncer, a great wall of a man with a curly ginger undercut, and a unicorn tattoo on his neck, took one look at them -- Phil in his fitted suit, Barnes in his tactical black, and smirked.  “Downstairs, I presume?”
“I’d like to see everything we have on the son,”  Rogers put in, standing when Fury did, and flipping the folder closed as well.  “If he got away from his kidnappers, I’ll need to know where he might have gone to heal up from whatever happened.”
That won him a glance, sharp and blue over one shoulder, the eyebrow above in a challenging arc.  “About damn time,” he said, drawing up to the garage and turning beside its keypad lock.  “Get us inside, and we’ll talk.”
“Have Klein get whatever you need, and work with Delta team for logistics,”  Fury threw back as he headed for the stairs, either not seeing, or else ignoring the glare Barnes whipped in his direction.
No one from Stark Industries got back to her.  Not until it was time for she and Victor as the remaining partners, to sign over ARC, its patents, its holdings, its equipment, and everything they’d built together to its new owners, and then take their consolation prize retirement packages, and go home.  She’d drunk for a week, locked herself in her apartment, and cried pretty much anytime she wasn’t asleep or raging at ghosts.  Ivan had drunk for a week, assaulted three Stark Industries shareholders, and gotten himself sent to jail for attempted murder.  And their shared dream of a clean-energy, saving-the-world, revolutionizing-medical-technology legacy had disappeared into the guts of Stark Industries, never to be seen again.
He turned the phone in answer, showed the bartender his favorite shot of Steve Rogers.  It had been one he’d taken himself, immortalizing the wonder and awe that had spread across the man’s face the first time he got a look at Times Square in all its neon glory.  It was a gorgeous shot, Rogers’ eyes wide as the sky, his lips up-tilted, slightly parted, neither gape, nor grin, but something of both.
