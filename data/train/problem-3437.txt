... He glared at the menacing tone of his little brother, when he asked, - "The usual way
His name in that voice, low and rumbling, makes Dean's head dizzy, just as it always has. Except this time, right now, finally, he doesn't need to push it down or fight it. He doesn't need to deny himself or his angel. There are also all those intriguing thoughts and fantasies about Cas’ wings that have been plaguing him since the talk with Jack...
The man laughs, watching his struggle, his voice thin and raspy like rustling paper. He doesn’t look much better, pale and gaunt, translucent skin sticking seemingly to his bones and Dean grimaces in disgust.
But Dean wouldn't let some ball of fur (who had grown like three times her size already) to stop him from having a good time, oh no.
"Cas..."
There’s less time spent travelling, and when he finally leaves his job, he can spend it all on putting finishing touches on the realisation of his dream.
That finally gets the angel moving, but they still end up tangling limbs and lips along the way, but as Dean is slightly calmer and clear-headed, he has the presence of mind to hurry.
Dean shifted, leaving a soft, chaste kiss on Cas' cheek instead. Nuzzling into him, hand weaving into his hair, ruffling it in a hopefully soothing gesture. As Cas slumped into the touch, Dean leaned to his ear.
in Cas' arms, all of them, right back to Dean.
Holding onto him when sharp fangs were buried into Cas' neck.
Without a thought about control, Dean was moving to meet his mate with every lick and bite. Pressing down, ravenous with lust, drunk on love.
"Scowl all you want, still not learning it any time soon."
"No tacos tonight, I hope?"
The bus doors closed just as the sleazy guy hummed, grinning wider.
It was good since Dean was pretty tired after a day in the kitchen, but on the other hand... He was bored.
Not like anybody could see him.
stories ever.
Very soon he comes upon another obviously planted occurrence, this time a beehive, exposed and practically dripping with honey, making Castiel's belly clench with hunger even more. He realizes he's salivating just from the sight of it only when he has to swallow. But the need feels foreign and he pushes it down again, smiling faintly at the bees going around their business lazily. Even if they also look hardly realistic, too calm with somebody of his size so close to their home and he notices a queen crossing his path very pointedly.
Cas smiles, a sheepish pleased quirk of his lips, that Dean can't help but kiss, deep and hungry. His own arousal is back at full force, thrumming in his blood with the echoes of Cas all around him.
, Cas. Who you are, your personality, not this body. I mean, sure, dude was good to look at, but you..."
Then Cas does open his eyes. It's hard to tell beneath the lights of the stage but there is something
Hiding his face in Cas' shoulder, allowing him to lead them in slow circles in something akin to a dance.
"Shall we, Dean?"
"Everything's fine, just got held up on the way. Nothing to worry about, I'll be there in a few."
It's still worth every second of lost sleep, of exhaustion, every dollar of his depleted accounts.
Until he can't even beg, only Cas’ name on bitten lips left, like a litany, like a prayer.
Clearly, Cas was in a joking mood. Along with lustful. And very, very focused on making Dean lose his mind right here, right now.
"Okay, okay... Hey, sweetheart, how about we move this to bed, hm?"
put this expression on his mate's face was a thousand times more painful than any wound.
Swallowed, licked his dry lips. He was never this nervous before.
He made sure to keep his voice even and calm, nearly a whisper, but not quite. Just a little louder, to get Cas' attention, and, hopefully, not let him completely panic.
And, even better, with more people watching Cas and enjoying his work, the stronger he gets.
He sobbed with the intensity of it and thrust deep, losing his last coherent thoughts in the whirlwind of pleasure and ardor.
Quivering, when Cas parted his asscheeks as though to get a better view. Leaving Dean completely open to his tongue and lips.
"What?!" - Dean turned to him, the movement probably making him lightheaded as he swayed, moaning miserably. - "No. No blowing up... Just. Catching a bad guy. Sorry to drag you into this..."
Meg was laughing her head off.
"Vasilissa..."
The bank approves his claim, and with the building being in such a sorry state, he even gets a pretty nice price.
He hates witches so much!
He placed it on the counter, crouching near Dean who had stopped puking at least. Though he still looked wrecked, so pale he was pretty much greenish, tears glistening in his eyes.
The words were out of his mouth before he realised he said them.
"Cas..."
Dean was shivering already, as Cas ground his ass right into his crotch. If his tactile sensations were correct those panties he wore were a thong. Leaving so much of the lush, soft skin to press right into Dean.
It’s as if he stepped into some very lifelike 3D video. Only better.
Cas sat on the bed to have a better access, concentrating on the magic and not the places he was touching. Mostly.
"do you mean girls and boys? Dean said it doesn't matter as long as you treat each other right."
"Yes?"
He finds a team to do it with too.
"Castiel."
"Dean, didn't you say one should never have sex in public unless all present gave their consent on watching?"
Soon another couple who just got to the resort joins them, both men and apparently close friends of Arin. István towers over them all--probably as tall as Sam--all muscles and tattoos on tanned skin that shows his northern heritage, along with bushy sandy beard. He looks menacing but he follows his companion like a puppy, fetching more chairs for them to sit close by and gently rubbing sunscreen onto his husband’s back, after introducing himself.
Dean practically jumps in surprise, but breathes out a relieved sigh,a smile already on his lips when he sees Castiel standing just a couple of steps away. Arin yells her greeting from where she and Lance are splashing in the water, but Castiel barely hears it. He’s too focused on Dean who recovers quickly, only for his eyes to get glued to Castiel. He can practically feel the greedy stare roving over his naked chest, and the angel stands just a little straighter at the attention, squaring his shoulders.
On the next day of his adventure, waking up alone in his bed, Dean fears it was all a dream.
Each shaky step he takes to the bathroom brings a giddy smile to his lips.
The important thing was that they came back to each other in the end.
realising, way too late as he always does, that fear and shame are not worth holding on to. Cas was worth it, but now he is gone. And all Dean is left with is the bleeding, aching hole in his chest and a sinking feeling of the pointlessness of it all.
And even if he did know better than to say this, with their luck, with their lives, with the tendency of their lives going to shit at a moments notice...
"No, Dean... Please. Remember the first two couples killed?"
playing in the lobby. He can’t understand a word, but the music flows with familiar rock riffs and voices of the singers are full of longing and desperation that only lovers know.
Dean feels it in every word, every note Cas sings though. Cas’ eyes are closed again but Dean knows if the angel would open them now they would see them alight with grace.
Dean doesn't realize he’s crying until there is the ephemeral feeling of feathers all around him. A smooth glide of tickling energy along his skin, hugging him closer in silent comfort.
"I'm sorry..." - Dean whispered in between licks over his skin, as if trying to catch the lingering aftertaste of blood on it.
He had to withdraw for a moment, though. To unbutton his own pants, yanking them down.
A few fevered words, so jumbled that Castiel has trouble telling them apart, and when he does, he can't hide a smile. There is a matching one on his human's face, lazy and happy, lips swollen from where he bit them. From where Castiel bit them, from when he kissed them again, drowning in it, in Dean's taste, his scent, the rushing of the blood in his ears.
But they weren't.
"Arin!" - Lance chastises her, offering apologies that Castiel barely hears. His eyes are on Dean's form surfacing from the lake, water splashing and dripping in a shimmering cascade from his hair and body.
Except Cas didn't stop, continuing the motion, stepping right into Alistair's space, twisting the broken hand, from which the gun had already fallen to the ground, useless.
He asks, turning to his left where angel stood just a moment ago, but he is already gone. Walking carefully along the side of the cliff, to be precise.
They still came to him in nightmares sometimes, again and again, the eternal loop of pain.
He was breathing with a visible effort, every inhale shaky and exhales coming out with an alarming rasp.
So that's how it comes to this.
Cas knew that voice.
Hoping, that Dean one day soon will not only entrust his body to him, but his deeper thoughts and concerns as well.
The soreness, deep and satisfying, edging on pain, but it is real.
"По-хорошему, говоришь... Приятно видеть, что я сделал правильный выбор."
And he knew exactly what he was doing. He may have been blushing, but there was no hesitation in his tone, only teasing insolence. Turning to lust as Dean retaliated, getting his hands right in the mess of the black hair and tugging.
It is very unsettling not to be driving. Even more so, when they are driving in Cas' car. Everything feels wrong to Dean: the sounds, the seats, the rhythm of the movement, even how the angel shifts the gears.
"What'cha you're studying?"
Dean shrunk back on instinct as the angel in his lap started practically vibrating with power, angry waves of his grace radiating around, barely restrained.
And again, each time returning just a little big bigger, to the point where Dean can hardly breathe on the push in, delirious and dizzy and still being fucked not just in his mouth, but in his ass too.
the case for a minute there. Or two.
Dean stopped, frozen like a deer in headlights, his hands slowly retreating from Cas' belt.
Marveling at the slick heat when he edged the pushed aside thong. Traced the base of his own cock, buried so deep in Cas still.
Dean abandons all pretense of keeping himself afloat himself soon after, wrapping his legs around Cas' waist, hooking his ankles and just rubbing off against him shamelessly. This time the moan is heard clearly, carrying over the surface of the lake with a wind. The lewd sound is edged with lust and frustration as the water provides just enough resistance that Dean's efforts go almost fully in vain.
Nibbling on his neck as Cas moaned, rubbing his cock into Dean's hip, the lace of the panties and the stockings sending delicious shivers all over.
Anything more than that would be a conflict of interest for the upcoming trial.
It takes two weeks of scouring public records for the owner, another week setting up the offer to the bank to buy it out.
Dean can't resist the happy laugh that bubbles out of him.
It's such a tiny speck of time in the grand scheme of things, just a trifle, really, but it feels unnaturally long still. It is also a waste, isas Castiel's thorough search of the surrounding forests that does not reveal anything suspicious. Only trees and barely discernible animal trails, birds singing, nature just going around it's business, uncaring for the angel's presence. It seems the monster must be living somewhere closer to the resort itself, or hidden so well, he is able to mask itself from the angel’s eyes. Neither possibility is a particularly appealing one, so Castiel decides to hurry back to Dean, all too aware of their tendency to find themselves in dangerous situations at the tiniest opportunity. Sometimes without any probability whatsoever.
"Gods... How could I ever..." - cold, trembling palm touched Cas' face, as the green eyes flickered with renewed energy. - "You are ace. I respect that, you know. But I can't help how I feel about you, and if I feed on you, my venom... I would never forgive myself if I force you into something you don't want."
"Well how about you get to it, huh?"
"Cas, what is that thing?"
Green eyes, so close to him, were getting swallowed by the black of the pupil.
Each compliment he paid to seemingly everyone... Except for Cas.
"Yes! It's his cat, he saved it, it’s never done anything like this..."
Because Cas is happy,
"You're so beautiful..." - Cas cracked his eyes open. Another push down, and he moaned, low and wicked. Thighs trembling with effort.
Even in the bunker they can't be left alone long enough, work and other responsibilities are always looming on the horizon. All Dean wants is to just get at least a few days alone with his angel.
And right on cue, the music quieted down and the voice of the DJ boomed around the hall.
Only to start crying again five minutes later. From the windowsill of his bedroom.
"Em... Are you going to just keep calling her a creature?"
"What in the living hell?!"
"Just this once, let me help you," - Cas returned to the bed, straddling Dean's hips in one graceful motion, his wings stretching, imposing and dark. He meant for his next words to sound commanding, but it came out heartbroken instead. - "Even if you don't want me."
When he doesn't respond quickly enough after the last orgasm, Cas simply magicks his tiredness away.
This was as much as he could do. As much as he allowed himself, in this intimate darkness, so close.
Dean measured him with a look. Cas stared right back. After half a minute of that staring game--Dean had the greenest eyes ever, Cas could swear--the agent relented, heaving a sigh.
"Yes, Dean, that is exactly what I said, how many times do you wish me to repeat it?"
"Well that'd be a refreshing change!"
While there is some black, most of Cas' wings are bright and radiant blue. They start off with soft gray-ish hues at the base, where they seem to just appear from Cas' human skin. The feathers there are small and smooth, so close together, fitting seamlessly, looking closer to fur. They are smooth and silky under his touch and almost hot with skin and flesh so close under them, coiled power reeling to be set free.
"Now, agent, how about you lower that gun and slide it right here. Slowly."
He stopped, thighs in those stockings so tight around Dean's hips. Trembling with an effort to not come, probably.
Each beat just sent agony through his veins as Dean's laughing face fell.
As they continue, he’s starting to worry Cas is planning to just kill him tonight with mind-blowing pleasure.
Whose almost victim released his grip, standing up... Only to tumble right back onto the ground.
"Meow!"
Even he was a little bit miffed by the isolated feeling inside the bus, the snow falling and falling, covering the machine with the soundproofing blanket.
Knowing exactly what it did to Dean. To see him like that.
So, Dean tries to kiss the angel to calm him down.
Another cramp, stronger than the last, coiled in his belly. Dean dropped his chin instinctively, trying to fold onto himself... Only to bump his forehead into Cas' jaw, as he was leaning down in concern.
Cas parroted back to Dean his own words.
Dean kneeled on the edge of the bed, reaching out, eager to touch.
"Alpha..." - whined Dean, writhing, pinned down by his mate.
True to that, several turns of the halls later, he noticed the tall figure of Sam who was talking with the man in the white coat.
Dean only huffs, not truly annoyed as his hips move subtly closer to his lover’s mouth. Castiel adores that flustered look all the more as he manages to make it hungrier, anticipating, the cap of the bottle of lube popping loudly. He squeezes a generous amount on his fingers right as Dean nods his assent, muscles beneath Castiel hands tensing. He drops yet another kiss, sucking a mark right below the waist, distracting a gasping Dean just enough for the first touch of the lubed fingers to come easier, with less pressure.
And quickly, as Cas, not giving Alistair even a moment to catch up, grabbed his arm into a hold, twisting it.
"Yes, Dean, please, keep it in your pants for at least one night, would you?! We have kids here!.." Sam, who was glaring at him more and more, gestures at Jack. The kid in question is happily chatting away with Arin about... the prevalence of hazelnuts in nougat over cashew and Dean is fairly certain he doesn't care what dirty thoughts he sends to his angel boyfriend.
Which for a God translated to prayers of the living, apparently.
muscles under his palms.
"It looks like you're fondling my balls, dude. And my ass," - the man's lips quirked, just a little. Cas dragged his eyes away from that face and glanced down, where his hands were indeed doing exactly that.
He got a lot of practice, with close interactions, an opportunity to observe and document all sorts of new facts and possible theories...
"Hey... hey, Cas."
The only upside? There was really nowhere to go. The station was the only shred of civilization for miles around, and in the blizzard, anybody stupid enough to try and make it on foot would likely freeze to death before reaching another.
"Yes, that would be helpful for when we go for a swim."
Probably said to all the other women too.
Blue balls were back. With vengeance.
He can't wait.
"Like an angel?!"
"Yeah, a big black cat. It followed us later on too, when we went to that overlook Vasilissa mentioned."
"You're enough, Dean. And you
By the time he’d stopped shrieking like a girl in a classic horror flick, the figure was fully out of the wall and had turned a pretty natural ‘human color’. Pale skin shone like a beacon in the dark room, a lonely ray of moonlight reflecting from unnaturally blue eyes.
But he just doesn’t know how to go about it. Dean never was good at this relationship stuff, and the thought of screwing something up with Cas? After he finally found the courage to go for it with him? It isn’t something that Dean can afford to risk. He is sighing his frustrations into a beer bottle in his Dean-cave, when Sam walks in, taking in the picture and the atmosphere pretty quick.
Dean kissed his angel with every bit of strength he had left before withdrawing slightly, breathing out in a rush.
in him grew for this man, not just adoration.
Despite his words, Cas bent over as another bout of giggles overcame him. He did keep his hands on Dean's wounds, though, as a soft, warm light flowed from them, relaying the healing energy.
"Are you sure you're good with leaving that... Timofey behind? Running the place? Won't he just start up something again?"
It’s just an off-hand comment, as he stands bored, waiting for the clerk to show up, but of course Cas being Cas and knowing every language on earth decides it is a perfect time to show off.
To turn him into the trembling wreck, to bring him to the brink in record time only to stop and keep him there.
It takes another long while to clean up a cabin. Castiel feels somewhat embarrassed by the destruction, but Dean only laughs, reassuring him that it was "totally worth it". He seems more relaxed overall, even as he stumbles over pieces of furniture. As if last night confirmed something, or felt just as meaningful as it did to Castiel, or both. He’s happy for the change nonetheless, hoping it will bring them closer. Not only in body but as an actual couple.
Pure and strong, it's tendrils practically reaching out to Cas, just as Dean soul was.
Practiced.
Which was apparently the reason he was
The biting sarcasm, the contempt.
By the time Dean catches up with the present, Castiel... Castiels? Both of them got him down to briefs, with Cas number one showering his belly and sides with soft kisses and Cas number two teasing his nipples.
Dean sees Cas deflate just a little beside him, shoulders drooping even though his face stays passive and curses his defensiveness silently.
A crazy, half-formed thought flickered through his mind and Dean trembled at the dark, positively wicked chuckle it got from Cas, who clearly managed to catch it.
He picked up immediately as he saw Benny's number on the screen, and Dean's heart sunk as his partner almost shouted at him.
And numerous reviews show that this resort is indeed very inclusive, with a zero tolerance policy for discrimination against the gender or even the number of partners you arrive with. But Dean's curiosity is truly piqued when he searches for recent local news and finds an alarming number of mysterious disappearances and deaths right in that very resort. Couples‘ disappearances.
That was the only explanation why in the months that followed Dean simply couldn't get Cas out of his head.
"What? Come on, Charlie, you didn't forget that we were going to that party together already, right?"
"Don't do anything stupid," - Dean looked straight at Cas. Who... smiled. Jesus, Dean would go grey at this rate. Where the hell was Benny?
Getting into his favorite thing after his job.
It is weirdly hard to leave this place, where he shared so many moments with Cas, just the two of them.
He really, really likes that he doesn't need to voice his response and can just say it all with a kiss that Cas eagerly responds to.
Dean tugged gently at the fistful of feathers, and the pure ecstasy ran through Cas, making him moan. Again. Even though he was spent and done, and just... done.
They couldn't be far, could they? And Cas was fine...
Cas was hardworking, and resilient, and nerdy, and just... perfect.
The source of his amazement and happiness lay right there, next to him, snoring quietly. A beautiful, achingly familiar face blissfully relaxed in sleep and free of all worries. Dean Winchester, The Righteous Man, The One Who Killed Death, and despite all the many,
But he is Dean Winchester, so of course he doesn't. And as he is clutching at his angel's back desperately, he is flying in the most horrible contraption to ever been made, including planes.
It sounds like an accusation somehow, but Dean's automatic protests die on his lips, when he finally has a presence of mind to actually look at Cas. He's almost blinded by all the naked skin suddenly right there for his perusal, but he's also not given much time for it. Cas presses forward, until Dean is plastered along the wall, cold tile under his back and Cas, hot, wet and glorious at his front. He gasps when he feels Cas' already hard cock drag along his thigh, and the angel takes that as the opportunity to claim his mouth in a dizzying kiss.
He yelps instead, his awkward flailing on the bed suddenly interrupted with a sharp pinprick of pain. He raises his hand, where right in the meat of his palm, sits a needle of all things.
Or puke.
Like right now, as a tall, disheveled man burst into the doors of the clinic, panting, growling, fangs and claws out--werewolf, Cas noted silently--and he was... carrying somebody.
Dean was laughing, a nervous, uncomfortable chuckle... Right before the song started and he just looked at Cas.
On their way out they decide to check the cave for further surprises, good or bad. But not before Dean changes into his own, proper clothes and grabs some boots as well, prudently provided by his angel. And while Cas is busy with some papers in another room--Dean still isn’t speaking Russian--the hunter carefully checks the place of the bony dude's demise. What he first thought were scorch marks, after a close inspection, ends up being an actual hole, filled with something like ashes.
"I have a partner on the bus. Not telling who can't have you sneaking glances and blowing our cover."
Which was nearly impossible. Still, he figured, it was better than freezing something off in the barely heated station or the motel where the walls looked like they'd go down any second.
The warmth of freckled skin.
So that is where he goes.
Dean couldn't wait for the sentence to be announced. And not just because he wanted to see justice served.
"Yes? No!" - he threw the blanket on the bed, where Lady napped. She didn't even move. - "Maybe?"
Benny complied instantly. Dean ran outside, pulling out the hidden gun from his ankle holster.
Looking as if he were carrying a scarf, not a bouncing up and down ten-year-old.
"Hey, Lady, come on! He's good! He helped me, don't!.."
How old was he, twelve?
Cas had always sat in the back. Motion sickness was a thing and he didn't find pills particularly helpful. So he made sure to buy a ticket in advance and request the seat at the very back. Additional bonus - he would probably be able to stretch his legs.
Yes, a hand, creeping up his knee and onto his thigh. Feeling him up. The scumbag chuckled, and just as Cas was ready to get up...
triple their profits.
It was a tiny oasis of warmth, carved into the wide expanse of snowy nothing.
Dean swears through another moan before yanking Castiel back up by the hair and sealing his mouth with a devouring kiss. It’s hurried and hungry, and when Dean grounds his hips down again, Castiel’s cock slides between his asscheeks, making them both groan.
The human flicks a weak shower stream at Castiel, practically giggling, happy with an open smile adoring his face, so the angel lets it slide for now. He
Enraptured, such beauty and grace above him, that man he loved so much getting lost in his own passion and pleasure.
"Not good. There was some weird infection in the blood, and since he hasn’t eaten anything for a while beforehand, he just doesn't have the strength to heal properly. He needs..."
It is hours later that Dean awakens, stirring and stretching as much as he can without disrupting their embrace too much, and Castiel smiles at that once again.
Playing a couple was a risky move, but he couldn't afford to make too big of a scene and risk the target getting off the bus. He also couldn't allow the scumbag getting handsy. They needed him moving. If they could only catch him crossing state lines...
the profits!"
wasn't the time.
from any medical assistance.
“Actually, chickens have prehistoric roots and are the closest living relative of the Tyrannosaurus Rex. Also, they can run up to 9 miles per hour. Now, can I get back to my story?"
He is so, so lucky that this amazing, strong, beautiful being chose him. Loves him. Keeps choosing him despite everything they've been through.
But just as Dean was tensing and getting ready for the blown cover, Benny continued.
"Alright... But you're staying right there. And holding him. Or I'll call the police," - Cas relented, still not walking closer and folding his arms across his chest.
It was that man by his side. Probably in his 50s, unkempt, scruffy and smiling at Cas a smile that looked like a shark's grin. Not to mention that endearment was absolutely inappropriate.
"Nah... I know you won't let me fall."
Cas wasn't wasting any time, removing Dean's boots, socks and jeans off before quickly doing the same with his own.
"Cas."
"That's weird."
Dean was still feeling queasy, but overall - much better. He hadn't thrown up either, even though it had been a close thing a couple of times.
Cas wished he never had an eidetic memory.
Fuck. He loved making Cas blush. And this close, pressed into each other, Dean could actually feel the heat radiating off those flaming cheeks. Adorable.
martial arts."
When they separate, Dean is breathless and giddy, still holding onto Cas, one hand on his jaw, another in his hair, and once again he is amazed that he is allowed this. But Cas only smiles, soft and content, resting his forehead against Dean's, palms sneaking under his shirt.
And now it came to this.
He notices some weird inscription and given their previous luck with cursed objects, shows it to Cas immediately.
He might have miscalculated when he figured that Cas would just move on when he dropped out of their conversation earlier.
Dean leans in closer, thinking of asking him to stop hiding, or maybe tease a little with something dirty whispered into his ear... But he gets distracted by the shimmer, slicker than before, somewhere between all the trembling beauty. It smells different too now--fresh mint turning deeper, tangy. It seems to come from that slick something that looks like oil, dripping a little from below the middle covers. And when Dean, intrigued, digs his fingers in there the scent bursts with bitter and rich tone of absinthe.
By all means, even if the scratches were deep (and boy, they were), they should have started mending already, with Dean's regeneration abilities.
"Well that's some shitty day on a beach!"
Because when he returned to work on Monday, with bags under his eyes, having not slept properly at all, all he could see was Dean’s absence.
Cas did find additional funding.
Dean was happy Cas had come just a little while ago, because now he could tease him as much as he wanted.
"Что?.."
"Cas!"
"I meant
"Well that cleared things up, for sure..."
Compared to their usual hunts, anyway.
"I like this one, Lance."
Cas would be fine.
Or the bitter tears he hated, just like he hated Dean, and Charlie, and that soft smile that was supposed to be only for him.
, because it feels so unreal he’s afraid he’s dreaming.
He couldn't really check, as Cas pinned his arms above his head and ordered not to move them.
The second he stepped out, it was hissing and scrambling after him, refusing to be left alone with anybody else.
important in that remark, something that nags at him, maybe something important to the case.
Cas was not blushing. He was not mumbling.
Dean was pretty sure he
"Dare what, beloved?"
Good thing, this time around, the doctor was right by his side. Ready to provide the necessary treatment. Even if he was giggling all the way through.
"Nah. Let's do it, angel. Time to get to work."
Dean actually made a point of getting up. Threw Lady out of the bedroom, before slamming the door shut.
Dean wanted to be there, to soothe all the fear and the trembling, but he couldn't.
, this is...
<<"And why exactly should I believe you? If Baba Yaga is your mistress all of this could be another trap.">>
A presence on the back of his mind, like a quiet murmur promising him that everything will be okay.
The colors and the lingerie, so delicate, so thin... All the more seductive on Cas' form, lithe and toned, that got Dean salivating on the worst day.
we dating?
So, three minutes later, here they were, almost there, but oh so far away.
Dean’s staring ahead steadfast.
"No, no... Please don't go... Dean..."
"Yeah, sure. As long as it doesn't kill us first."
"Damn, kid... Remind me not to get on your bad side," - Benny was the first to come to his senses.
He wants to see it all, to
, maybe because there doesn't seem to be any
An echo of Truth, of what he's sure is an echo of Cas’ True voice. It reverberates in Dean’s very bones, that echo. He shakes with it, the song and the love Cas has for him made almost physical.
The deep, hungry longing in his eyes, fogged over from pleasure and yet still demanding more.
And with that, the cat swings his tail before jumping down the rock only to turn into a human midway, magic shimmering around his body in a brief flash. Where the cat was now stands a young man dressed in all black, a simple tunic and pants, seemingly from some natural cloth, and barefoot. His black bangs are flopping over shining yellow eyes in a messy style, yet he looks way too tense for the casualness his appearance could suggest. The thin sheet of nervous sweat on his light skin only confirms it. He bows his head in greeting before speaking again.
And Cas seems to just take it in stride, laying down his fair share of touching too. His hands feel solid and warm, averting Dean's attention every time, commanding it. One time he finds himself drifting off while Cas just rubs his thigh up and down, over and over again, the rhythm constant and lulling him into a dreamy state of comfort.
Cas needed to be closer and his grace answered without any conscious effort on his part.
"You're an idiot... Such an idiot...
Totally the poisoning.
. Cas took another step back.
At least for a moment.
"I don't think so. In legends it is a weapon of warriors, heroes, often believed to make them invincible and unbeatable."
"Yeah, good idea... Wait,
"Nothing... I just...really like it when you say that."
He knows precisely which path he needs to take, but first he goes through Sam's messages.
"Hey, guys... I'm Dean. You've seen my guy already." He speaks in the mic, shaky.
... He indulged.
Dean laughs at the unsynchronised chorus booming through the entire lobby that had been commandeered for today's party.
He liked her, really.
"Dean!! You're okay!"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh gods! What happened?! Did someone attack you?! Where are they?!"
He chews Dean out for about a week for being "irresponsible" and "crazy" and "juvenile"... Still, he agrees to handle the legal side of things when Dean announces that either he gets Sammy’s help with this or he goes in without a lawyer at all.
Cas looked into Dean's aura, into the reflection of his soul, searching for the truth... He was almost blinded by the shifting brilliance of color.
Like his savior currently puking his guts out in the small toilet. On the bus. That had already left town and was on its way directly
Dean is finally happy.
"I'm sure you're... okay..." - Cas was saying.
"You come here often?"
"I take it, you didn't just want to cuddle in the water, hm? What's up, angel?"
face of his is dead serious, leaving Dean with no doubts at all. It’s a strange and unknown feeling, but he rather likes it and the weightlessness it leaves him with.
A teasing grin thrown over the coffee cup in the cafeteria.
"Well, the usual way!"
"But otherwise, it's not
Castiel keeps his eyes on Vasilisa as he talks and she steps further away, towards the tree, bending down to pet the still unmoving cat between his ears. The animal quietly purrs, leaning into the hand of its owner, and Castiel uses the moment to head for the beach once more. He waves at the woman, gesturing to the phone instead of a proper goodbye and she nods, shooing him away.
It almost distracts him from all the other sensations, but not for long.
Dean really wants to shed his clothes again and go for a swim, preferably naked and with a particular angel in tow, just to see how blue of his eyes would look against the waters of that lake. He's also pretty sure that Cas would allow this if he asked, which is why he doesn't. They do have work to do, people to save, monsters to fight. Skinny-dipping can wait a day or two. Probably. Maybe.
He bites down on another cheek, holding onto Dean's hips as he tries to retreat.
More kisses. Gentle. Cas relaxed with each a little bit more. Dean didn't seem to be freaked out... They could do this.
So all he does is relax as much as he can, focusing his hazy stare on what’s happening, reflected in the mirrored ceiling.
He was also not waiting eagerly the return of one handsome werewolf.
it, with every movement they made, the threads between them, that
"I love you too, Dean," - and he meant every word.
He finishes on a whisper, words still too big and clunky in his mouth. It's worth it to see that glow that is pure Cas light up in blue eyes again, his smile soft as tension melts away from his body. Cas lifts himself up on his elbows a bit, turning his head, and rewards Dean with the sweetest kiss, quick, but somehow lingering, satisfying in a way that not even the most passionate make out sessions can be.
Not that Dean was thinking about her. Or anybody. Except Cas, who was kissing him again, hungry, pressing into him so sweet... Before breaking the kiss. And stepping away.
His throat does not particularly want to cooperate at the moment, so Dean just nods and reaches for a kiss, almost missing Cas' lips in the near-darkness. He stifles a giggle, because Dean Winchester does not giggle under any circumstances.
In Dean's voice, in his pleas, in his kisses.
"Oh fine, come over here already, you!"
"I'm not a wolf, Dean. I like you, and I'm really happy that you think I'm worthy enough to be your mate... But I need time. Please."
A gust of wind rakes over them both and Dean moans again, quiet and pained, writhing on Castiel’s hands and tongue, right at the verge of the overstimulation. His freckled skin painted with goosebumps and white streaks of his own cum.
Dean's phone buzzed. Cas' number.
Cas' voice had a strange, hushed quality, making Dean shift in alarm.
If Dean was a betting man, he'd bet that Cas was trying to find the perfect wording and kept getting distracted by his own thoughts. Much like Dean was distracted by his own.
"Exactly like an angel. Honestly, sometimes I'm sure I can see his wings and halo."
"Let him go. He’s got nothing to do with this."
At that, the angel wants to laugh with relief but it would probably get him punched. So he decides on a kiss instead as those tend to consistently bring Dean in a good mood. It's certainly distracting enough. Starting gentle, the kiss turns desperate quickly, some deeper drive guiding Dean and the soft touches are now nibbling bites and hurried breathes that scream the need for more.
"Heya, angel, is there some mojo here? Some... I don't know, hospitality charms maybe?"
“And just the same, one of them was so eager to prove his big top macho energy where the other simply had it."
“By the way, how did you find me? You said that the whole resort was chock full with anti-detection wards or something…”
Dean also remembered how not long after that shot Cas was marking him up with his cum, coming all over his face and chest. How sweet he tasted.
"Of course... Please."
They weren't outside for long.
"I love you, Cas."
Both.
"Would you look at that. Beauty and brains. I'm a lucky man today, it seems."
In the meantime, the current has brought them almost all the way back to the shore and it only takes a minute to stir the human to it. They walk backwards across the narrow beach, not breaking the kisses or the frantic groping.
His poor overloaded body only wants to stop, but it keeps going and it’s perfect.
The wings.
"Mmm? Nah, I'm good. Do you need me to like stand up, or..?"
Cas throws him a weak smile before turning back to Jack and Sam.
"Okay, okay. I'll go here. Circle around, make sure they're not somewhere on the road already."
That worry flew right out of his head along with all other thoughts except
"Technically, we are still alone. This..." - Cas traced the jaw of his doppelganger with his fingertips, giving Dean pretty wicked whiplash from the thoughts trying to catch up with the events. - "Is me also. You seem to like it when there are more people around than just you and me, but I didn't want to share you today."
"И?... Где она?"
Dean was breathing faster too.
"The students in my school didn't like me liking boys. So, I started learning self-defense. It turned out I like boys
"We're not...
It didn't take them three days of... heated discussions, one might say, to end up in the nearest supply closet.
"No. Just Castiel."
It didn't really matter, as long as Cas could hold Dean.
"It says here you're proficient in... Three types of martial arts?" - the lawyer shuffled through his papers demonstratively.
The thin metal under his hands snaps with little pressure. The screech skeleton guy makes after that is anything but little. Dean’s only half aware of Cas' wings covering him, protecting from a blinding wave of light that comes later. The monster dissolving and incinerating, until there is nothing left but scorch marks on the walls and the floor.
Before they ever had a chance to talk...
<<"Damn you! Useless human! Answer me!!">>
"I love you, Cas. My mate..." - there was reverence and awe in Dean's voice. - "My perfect mate."
He liked to just come here recently. It was still run down and quiet, as always, but now he can acutely feel something different.
Famous last words, weren't they.
He tries to breathe, to focus on Cas, on his face in his mind, smiling, laughing, moaning in delight. It is the last image before he succumbs to the darkness of unconsciousness that this time feels less like sleep, and more like a coma.
Quite literally and absolutely impossiblly, yet still happening.
The human draws a sigh of relief, while Jack and Sam are muttering excitedly something about the inner workings of such charms between themselves.
And again.
That was the word.
Just like green eyes and infectious laugh and...
"Hi there! I see you've met Arin, who's still having trouble remembering to ask for permission before hugging people..."
His scream shook the windows. Cas winced, before laughing, a giddy, breathless, shining smile over the bitten lip making Dean... Simply making him. Whole.
Never before had he dropped to his knees faster than in that moment.
And he had clearly missed him
But still, it wasn't enough, it never was.
"Dude. Seriously. Isbuska?! What the hell is that??"
His hand, however, never leaves Dean's, squeezing it tight and solid, his thumb rubbing in soothing circles. It helps, keeping Dean just above the surface of panic, keeping him smiling, standing, and not running for his life and sanity. But he is still immensely grateful when Cas finally leads him away from the desk, after the clerk gives up the keys to their cabin with honestly an excessive amount of directions and pamphlets.
"Yup. All day, all night, baby!"
"Well, my omega? Wasn't there something you wanted to do?"
It just slid in his ass, and Dean felt Cas' wrist with dazed half-unbelieving wonder, lost and nearly sobbing at the fullness, but still arching to draw him deeper.
, but I just can't remember quite yet. We'll work on it. Keep your eyes open and don't get killed, okay?"
What a nice thought it is, Castiel can't and doesn't want to hide his smile. He has a reason to smile. He has a reason to be happy. Sappy even.
He smirks, Cas rolls his eyes fondly, and hand in hand, they are off.
"Yes, Dean, do not worry. You won't get lost with me."
Curiously, the creature, which was very cuddly and affectionate with Dean, had barely tolerated the touches of his guests. And only then while Dean was in it's line of sight.
Cas is right, of course, but right this second all Dean cares about is chasing down Cas' smell with his lips and his tongue. He wants to distil it and make it his new cologne, take it with him everywhere, smell it in his dreams, slather himself with it in the waking hours. Instead he kisses and licks, and presses into the embrace, taking every last moment he can squeeze out.
The photo had been taken on the morning of one of them.
"I said that so Gordon would get a fucking hint and leave Charlie alone," - Dean parried.
So he thumps down his frantic heart and watches the Cas’ reunion with Jack. It’s much easier not to hate Jack quite so much after he, however accidentally, returned his angel to life. And maybe that relieved, happy smile Cas shines with when he’s hugging Jack, maybe that makes it worth it to go a little easier on the kid. (Especially when he goes for the winning strike and sends them right to cowboy central for a case.)
Dean chases his lips as Castiel withdraws, frowning, trying and failing to haul him closer for another kiss.
He kept going, falling deeper and deeper into the glittering kaleidoscope of Dean's soul, all around, twining with his own. He could
Because even though Cas didn't go all the way, that Dean respected.
Secondly, Cas, eyes blazing and blade drawn, comes in, eyes immediately drawn to Dean. A tiny relieved smile crosses his features before settling back to a wrathful scowl. Both look equally hot to Dean.
By all counts, it should hurt like hell, but with Cas it’s never a problem unless he wants it that way.
"Metch’-Kladenetc. It is... A sword."
That way there was a seat with a backpack between Cas and the creep who was pretty much burning holes into them with his eyes at this point. Still, it felt much safer that way and Cas nodded gratefully, settling in the slightly warm seat.
"Он самый. Он твоего паренька держит, дальше в горах, пока Бабка с тобой тут развлекается по пути."
It was always him.
"Welcome home."
It was hard to tell with the panties in the way, but if the flush spreading all over Cas' neck and the tips of his ears was to be believed, he was close.
He looked like he'd do it too.
And there were those eyes, staring him down. He noticed he and Castiel were probably around the same height. Perfect for kisses.
The familiar only meows again, angry almost and rubs his furry little body on the stone, the etching on it changing briefly in response.
There, etched into his flesh is the proof that he's not crazy or delusional.
Though he needed to focus, not stare again, now at the prettiest eyes he had ever seen.
He could see the driver though, half-buried in the engine, with the hood of the bus propped up.
It was the next day, and he was back, clothed this time, though. And clearly wanting to get back to his more... natural state.
"I was hoping to avoid this conversation. Oh well... I'm not exactly... aware, how I like it better," - Cas looked up, but the second Dean caught his eyes, he looked away. - "I've never had sex before."
His patients were... colorful, to say the least.
But instead of answering, Cas... froze. Groaning miserably, as Dean tore himself away to see his face, to see what was wrong...
Dean fell asleep to Cas' mumbling about how "that could not have happened..." in his ear and Benny regaling the calming kid with his "sniper on top of the White House" tale.
Cas hoists his bag on the shoulder and offers Dean his hand.
No matter what he did, the heart-wrenching, needy meows continued right outside his window.
"Hey, I'm with the police, please, play along," - it probably looked like a kiss as the man whispered quickly into his ear.
Sam really should have known better. He should have but he was worried for his brother and his friend, so he just had to check in on them when the whole place started shaking again.
As Benny clapped him on the shoulder, Dean was looking around for Cas. He was present too, as this was the final hearing...
Cas only smirks, suddenly playful, a gleam of challenge in his eyes.
Cas whined, displeased.
Cas didn't need to be told twice.
But now,
Where Dean thought that Cas was all thin and elegant as his fingers, there were actually a wall of clearly trained muscles behind his back. A very warm, cozy wall, that was cuddling him.
It turns out, Castiel was right about the tree and Dean was right about the cat. They are both parts of a Slavic legend which connect to a number of others. Sam writes that it's impossible to know which particular monster of all mentioned might inhabit the resort. But Castiel can tell just from the magic used and the gut feeling he's learned to trust, that at the very least one of them is Baba Yaga. Or, probably, Vasilisa, as she called herself... yet all of this setup is not her usual m.o. so there must be something more going on...
“I don’t want to screw this up,” Dean finally grits out, forcing Sam to lean closer to hear, his face showing only a careful and attentive facade. The one that he uses on traumatised witnesses usually, to gently weasel all the info out of them.
Dean, who time and time again vehemently refused to drink from Cas no matter how many times he offered. No matter that Cas' healing would have easily covered any blood loss in seconds. No matter that Cas wanted it, wanted to be there for the person he loved.
The lower feathers, long and wide, are much darker. Dean can barely discern the hues, glistening and shimmering, swirls of black with more purple, and the deepest dark blue, like starless nights, except there are stars right there, with more white at the ends.
"It's really not."
He did, but that endearment... Tender, possessive, teasing, all rolled into two little words that made Dean so happy every time he heard them he was ready to float.
He could hear people fussing over him, and he felt hot coffee on his shoes, but it's all just background noise.
There were a couple of blankets over them, along with some warm clothes from Cas' backpack. Dean begged for some dinner, but was resolutely denied at the premise that nothing in the station was nowhere even close to food suitable for his upset stomach.
As he was listing down symptoms, Dean's face scrunched up in confusion. Frankly, it was almost adorable.
He lined himself up, his grace reaching out, lubing up his throbbing length, preparing Dean for what's to come.
"Her."
"Cloud Nine Resort will deliver you and your partner to a better place right on this Earth! Inclusive, remote, with attentive staff and various activities available for your enjoyment, we are located at the stunning Lake of the Clouds, Michigan. Come and rest in our little slice of Heaven."
Warmth, which quickly turned to blazing heat.
Benny also totally made fun of him for getting a "pillow" too, along with the blanket. Meaning Cas, of course.
"No! She's not... She's just a cat! A fussy, cuddly ball of fur! Who's..."
There was still a whole hour till the end of his shift, yet the bar was nearly deserted--that calm before the night rush that felt eternal some days.
But here they are, in a dirty alley in the backwoods of nowhere and Cas is stepping out of the phone booth, as Sam’s still getting out of the car. But Dean doesn’t care for his brother right now, his whole being attuned to Cas.
pressed into Cas' ass right now. Because that would get really awkward really fast.
Hell, he even offered himself, multiple times, in case Cas was partial to being "on top" or whatever. He was human. Mostly. Dean thought he was at least.
It was torture.
"О, ну не кривись так, миленький, недолго тебе мучиться ещё."
With a sigh, he soaked the handkerchief in the sink, bending down to swipe the cold cloth over Dean's forehead. And his temples, washing away the sweat and cooling him down a bit. A gentle swipe across the eyes, which closed promptly, cheeks and finally the bright pink lips.
The warm, soft ones he greeted him with in the mornings.
"Are you Dean's partner? The angel?" - the doctor's tone was all business. Clearly, the situation was serious, if he looked so grim. Cas swore silently for the hundredth time since the call, nodding quickly.
"What's the word?"
No sex until they got to know each other better.
"Of course. I'm sorry, Dean."
There was a pause in which Cas started typing something a few times, but didn't send anything.
<< "I wouldn't say
He doesn't avert his eyes from Cas, just looking, looking and looking at those blue eyes. The melody and his angel's gruff voice wash over him in a hushed room. Some people even raise their hands with lighters and flashlights on their phones, swaying with the rhythm.
Dean does plan to make a lot of jokes about that one, but firstly, he just has to hear that part.
"Cas! Here, little bro! And so sorry, miss, that's the boyfriend."
He also now knew the name of his patient. Dean.
A panting breath in his ear.
<<"But you can deal with that yourself, you're a big boy. What really matters is to find The Death of Koshey.">>
Dean opts to focus on the papers in hand, noting one with an ad for an upcoming event in two weeks; on the last day of their intended stay, the local version of a talent show. The theme is apparently "The Words of Love" and even though Dean feels nauseous just reading it, it also somehow tugs at him somewhere deep. Because Cas deserves somebody who can shower him with praise and all the sappy, romantic, chick flick bullshit he can possibly handle, and Dean is... Dean is not that person.
But it’s exactly what he wants.
One, with the creep changing seats it was that much trickier to keep an eye on him.
Castiel watches him, keeping up with steady thrusts of his fingers, adoring the pleasure stricken face of his beloved.
With a sigh, Dean stuck it to the board and got on with actually doing his job. For which he was paid for. Cooking, that is, not sending naughty texts to his alpha. Sadly.
Faking a smile was pretty easy with just how... beautiful the stranger was. He plopped on the other side of Cas, one arm still around his shoulders, comfortable, as though they really did it all the time.
Up and down, gradual, an almost lazy push and pull.
"Well that's helpful..."
After that, time flew.
He was still not expecting that.
They have to separate later on.
"Но это не важно сейчас. Я служу Бабе Яге уже столько лет, сколько себя помню, и мне это порядком поднадоело. Ты, по крайней мере, выглядишь достаточно сильным, чтобы избавиться от неё с концами, так что я тебе помогу, если согласишься отпустить меня после."
He squirmed in his seat, the messages brought up in but a couple of clicks.
"Yes. I speak all the human languages."
Making Dean face him.
It can burn for all he cares.
"I'm an angel, you ass," - the familiar infectious laugh.
Forget the blue balls, it was Cas' cuteness that would kill Dean in the end.
They drink coffee from freshly reconstructed cups, even though Cas is far more focused on Dean's throat as he swallows. He traces the curve of Dean’s neck with his gaze, and counts all the scars along his exposed chest and freckles on his shoulders, forgetting to actually drink the coffee.
He could remember each and every time those hands touched him.
Dean feels stupid just saying the words, but Cas only hums thoughtfully, pausing as he unpacks to cast an intent gaze around the space. His eyes flash for a brief moment, a little glimpse of his grace, manifested to be seen, and suddenly the charms and the hunt are the last things on Dean's mind. It only intensifies when Cas finishes his inspection of the walls and stops his eyes on Dean, head tilted in curiosity.
"She looks like a cat. She
"How're you feeling, sweetheart?"
Dean.
It's barely sundown, the sky is just starting to turn orange on the horizon on the edge of the evergreen trees, but people seem to be rather in a hurry to get out. Arin hurries Lance too, breaking up their conversation with Dean, polite, but firm. They wave goodbye, before disappearing onto one of the paths to the cabins, Dean making note of residents not being so keen to stay out in the dark.
Its not like he even wanted the compliments.
Dean laughs as Cas grumbles, the couple giggling with them too, ignorant of the true joke. They all settle near a bar, Dean immediately snagging two perfectly cold beers. They talk, with Dean carefully manoeuvering the conversation around the general atmosphere around the resort and the most recent deaths, but he finds himself constantly drifting closer to Cas. Their knees are always touching, they sit so close, and Dean keeps finding himself somehow returning his hands to Cas, distractedly smoothing fingers down his arm, or clapping his thigh or shoulder, or just intertwining their fingers... And he can't stop, can't remember how to stop himself from it, how he did it before.
So he nods and allows Cas to finally get him to bed, cuddling there as close as he can, hiding his face and all the worries on angel’s chest.
Cool, slender hand touched his forehead. Damn, that was way too nice for the situation they were in. Benny would make fun of him for months over this.
"You're gorgeous, beloved."
"Yes, Dean, you totally didn't miss him at all... It doesn’t show."
But in this moment, shaking in his boyfriend arms, he wouldn't want to be anywhere else but here.
That saves him the trouble of looking for Dean, at least, so Castiel complies, heading for the cabin first for a change of clothing. He digs the aforementioned article of clothing from his bag, considering what else he might need to take with him.
Though he was,
Not the right thing to do, but when did had they ever done the right thing?
With a cat, still hissing, under his arm.
He dubbed it his Big Lucky Charm and thanked the faceless figure every time he left that tiny bit more satisfied at the end of the night.
Dean is drifting in a relaxed, hazy sleepiness for what feels like hours, slipping in and out of consciousness. He’s warm, sated and he is nestled into something soft, so waking up doesn't really seem like much a priority.
"I can see that... I'm sorry, again, they always get like that after a few too many drinks. I am Lance, nice to meet you...?"
Castiel cradles the sleeping human in his arms, frankly unable to quite believe in this strange and miraculous reality he has found himself in.
Cas had an eidetic memory.
So, a year after the meeting, and six months from the start of their company, the old, dank two storey ruin of a house is now a slick and modern building, seven storeys high, comfortable and full of light and people.
As Dean talked, Cas had been busy.
"I love you, Cas," - he would get to keep those words too.
Castiel watches the clouds boil and roll with a wind, but truly he is looking past them, to the heavens that are as uncaring as they are distant. A place he once called home, that he lost, that he abandoned after trying so hard to save, and now... The yearning melancholy still stays with him, that nostalgic feeling humans probably feel for their childhood homes and memories.
Cas didn't have anything else to say.
"What'cha reading there, pretty boy?"
Cas looked up again, where the "cat", hearing her owner talk, purred loudly, climbing onto his chest and rubbing it's small head all over his face.
Dutifully, Dean took the pills and one sip. Made a disgusted face at both.
The smile on Cas' face turns into predatory grin and Dean knows right then he’s in for a private celebration later on.
And that’s what Cas did,
"For not asking you," - he finally lifted his head, green eyes returned to their human-like appearance, clear and calmer than Cas had ever seen them. - "That was dumb. Also... damn, we wasted so much time while we could have done...
, this idiot will use his actual words and explain all the crazy things he's been doing lately."
"He's been through a lot. I don't mind."
Two crazy, delightful years, filled with them butting heads (and other parts of the anatomy) together only to keep coming back to each other. All the better for it.
However cozy this was, though, he needed to get up at least partially. He needed to see the creep, who was camped out close to the middle of the bus on one of the freed-up spots.
The dude just wouldn't take a hint.
He ended up late for work.
Cas was practically bouncing off the walls as he followed his brother, Gabriel, who was probably with Sam when he got the call. At times like this Cas was really glad both he and Gabe and Sam and Dean were brothers. It was annoying at times, but in that moment he trusted Gabe not to ask stupid questions and simply lead him to Dean.
Cas had an eidetic memory.
Some treated him well, others would barely spare a word, some literally spat on him as soon as he finished patching them up.
It was glorious, turning to overwhelming too soon, but Castiel simply keeps going and going.
Wide and attentive.
Castiel should've known it was too good to be true, to not be a trap of some kind. He should've known.
And it's not like the ones around Dean's dick and balls disappear either. Oh no.
And all the while, he’s filled further and further.
Charlie. Of course, he had to come, to check on her boyfriend probably, but before Cas could snipe at her too, Dean was talking, urgent and determined.
It's little more than a whisper but Dean shakes, fingers scraping on the tree, a flush creeping up all the way along to his neck. So Castiel continues, gentle touches and gentle words, the previous frenzy gone, washed away by a wave of tenderness.
Firstly, he discovers the door, one that is so close in color to the walls Dean hasn’t actually noticed it before. He does now as it is thrown off its hinges and out of the doorframe entirely. Flying and landing with a neat little thud right in the face of the bony creeper.
He was that far gone.
When the stranger regained consciousness that is.
<<"Hello, Timofey. Not to be rude, but how about we skip the games and you'll just tell me where Dean is, before it gets ugly?">>
Those last ones made it so hard to not just... topple Cas onto the nearest suitable surface and claim him. To kiss each and every inch of his body, to make him shout Dean's name...
"Go on... touch yourself, Dean... I want to see you come, want to see you come undone as I fuck you."
Castiel approaches carefully but the cat just stares at him, silent and calm, magical fire roaring behind him.
This day sucked. This assignment sucked. Those tacos sucked major balls. Probably literally, with how Dean's stomach was still trying to tie itself in knots even with whatever pills Castiel had given him.
"How do you like it? Come on. Want to make you mine. Want to make you feel so good you'll never think of anybody else..."
Black clashed with green, pupils blown with desire and sclera as one bottomless void of hunger.
To purge from his memory every time Dean had ever touched him, every smile and every kiss...
Speaking of healing, he really had to move his hands.
It is still unknown how exactly this monster looks for couples, what the connection is, so they go their separate ways for a few hours.
That sounded logical. Cas was an adult--Dean had actually asked about that at some point. He could take care of himself. So he let him go, even though Dean stubbornly tracked his crinkled trenchcoat all the way to the bathroom doors with his eyes.
Dean's face was flushed with anger and shouting, his posture threatening, a finger pointing right at Cas' face.
The arm was right back around his shoulder, and this time he was tugged closer...
So he simply burrows closer into the hot-n-cold embrace of his lover and slips into a restful and easy sleep, for once not filled with nightmares, but only shimmering blue lights and the phantom scents of mint and absinthe.
"Anything. Anything for you, sweetheart," - was the passionate answer, slipping from blooded lips with a slight lisp because of the fangs, so weirdly adorable.
Cas catches his eyes and that beautiful, familiar,
Nervous. Confused. Cas was lucky the man didn't try to attack him right away. Cas was lucky, period.
"Yes. Their records, diaries, the deed for the resort as well."
"Do you have any idea what'cha doing to me, Cas?"
"I'm a healer. You were poisoned. I apologise for the... ahem, position, but I heal with my hands. So we’re stuck for a moment."
"Anyway, we can't really grab him yet... Only watch. Honestly, with your help. Well. It'd be great, but I'd rather not. I am not putting you, the civilian, in danger."
And then Cas is back.
It got a lot easier when they finally settled on a place and moved in together.
He seems to settle on trying to bullshit his way out, finally meeting Cas' eyes, daring, his breath a little more shallow, barely noticeable to anyone else, but Castiel notices.
"Somehow, I don't think it wants to..."
"Don't you have somewhere to be?"
“You two should talk. Really talk. Tell him what you just told me. Listen to what he has to say too.  And maybe… Go somewhere where you could be alone for a bit? Until you settle it all.”
And with a gleeful laugh Dean is gone from his arms, taking off towards the forest with impressive speed considering he's still barefoot. Castiel is itching to catch him, his wings practically vibrating with readiness, but this would not be the best place to showcase his abilities, not knowing who's watching. They've been plenty reckless already.
The second they are outside in relative solitude once again, Dean is enveloped in a tight hug. The silent comfort makes him bury his face in Cas' shoulder, for once free of the accursed coat, covered only in a light parka over a t-shirt.
The path, that was only slightly bending before, suddenly takes a sharp 90 degree turn, and when he turns that corner, there is no more path but a small clearing with a... wall of fire blocking it right in the middle. It's silent and the blazes are bright green, clearly magical, the heat coming off of it can be felt even several paces away.
Dean shrugs and does just that, with cat's yellow eyes watching them all the while, frankly creeping him out more and more. But eventually Cas is satisfied with the number and angle of the pictures and they move on, leaving the tree and the cat behind. Except, Dean could swear he heard the cat mumbling something
The conversation was effectively stopped by the tall werewolf who--
He whispers it right into the kiss, allowing himself just one more, or maybe two, before turning and burying his face right into the invisible wing on his right. His whole face erupts in tingles, as if from a low-level electric current, but he just nuzzles in experimentally, listening to Cas' whine. It's a good sound and he wants to hear more, so he goes with the first thing to pop into his mind. He nibbles on it, teeth gentle but determined, right through the feathers to the flesh that must hold them. Lightning erupts on his tongue, just as Cas practically falls into him, suddenly shaky and keening loudly.
"Is that even a question?"
"That's... ah..." - he stumbles, almost falling over himself. Every line of the song and the intensity of Cas so close to him, it feels to Dean like a serenade. He almost forgets that they are actually working, they’re in a public space. Dean's heart races and shivers run down his arms and back, up his neck.
Yup, Benny was gonna laugh his ass off.
Lights above them flickered madly before blowing out with a flash.
"Sorry, dude! All booked up! We," - she winked at Dean who returned the gesture. - "..have plans already!"
More so, he is right here in his arms, smiling, lips and cheeks both pink. The bluest eyes looking up at him in amazement and relief. Strong arms resting securely on his back. And through it all, Dean is far too happy to care about the chick flick moment, for the stunned silence of his brother - he has his angel and that is all he needs.
He was falling deeper still, as the strong arms caught him right as he stepped through the doors and dragged him to the closest wall.
He maneuvers Cas onto the bed, until he's on his stomach, hugging the pillow and squirming impatiently. So, Dean straddles those fidgeting hips, smirking at the gasp that elicits. His smile softens when he meets the annoyed gaze of very blue and very human--for now--eyes and smooths his palms down Cas' back, feeling the muscles shift underneath.
"Oh... How can I tell the difference?"
Sadly, the realisation came way too late.
"How is he?!"
"Well I don't know,
Dean doesn't care, all he wants is to keep kissing his angel and Cas doesn't mind it either.
Sucking.
Because
Only a fucked out, dopey smile on his puffed lips when he reached out to kiss his mate.
To wait until Dean is calmer, almost back to himself, almost used to the fullness and the pressure, and the angles.
Which was cradling Cas' face in his palm, drawing him close. Until he could feel his skipping breaths on his lips. He was tempted. So tempted.
Cas almost lost control again when he finally went into the room and actually saw his boyfriend.
He is still breathless when he reaches Castiel though, but it has nothing to do with swimming.
It was from last weekend, when they locked themselves away for two days straight, spending it mostly in bed.
With expert fingers joining the exploring tongue, fucking him hard and deep. He'd be worried about drowning Cas in his slick given how ridiculously turned on he felt, his body begging for something bigger than fingers, but he had no coherent thoughts left.
"Но с этим сам справишься, чай не маленький. Что важнее, это найти смерть Кощееву."
Nothing alarming in cat screams from behind the door and sounds of scratching as if she was peeling off the wood over there.
It takes Dean a moment to stop an ugly snorting laughter at seeing that monstrosity.
He doesn't even turn as he yells it, already diving into the lake and Miguel whistles, breaking the silence only for everybody else to erupt in another bout of laughter.
"What?! Cas!.. This... But you've said..." - This hurt.
As the humans were the only ones most of the supernaturals didn't feel defensive with when at their weakest, ill or injured.
"Do you remember how they looked? I didn't pay much attention at first, but... They seemed to exhibit a rather clear resemblance in their appearance to the traditional divide in female and male stereotypes."
Dean's grip on his lapels ruining his jacket, no doubt.
It takes quite a while for them to actually get out of bed after that.
Jack, Jack, always on the quest for new human knowledge and a better understanding. Unexpectedly, the one who answers is Cas.
As he leaned down, glaring at the creep by the window before wrapping his arms around Cas' neck.
look like a dangerous element here, and his client - just an innocent victim.
The second the song is finished Cas practically flies onto the stage. Dean has half a moment to step away from the mic stand before he is enveloped in a crushing hug of angel's hands and wings. His startled moan is swallowed in an enthusiastic kiss. Dean is just so goddamn happy, he can't bring himself to care about anything else. He kisses his angel, with abandon, with all the passion, and need, and longing he hid for so long and it's
Sentencing Dean to think about anything
"It is very hard to do sometimes, as human emotions are tangled together by their nature. But generally, if you see a person and desire to perform some sexual act with them - that would be sexual attraction. A romantic one is..." - Cas pauses, turning to Dean in a moment of silence when he contemplates something. "Romantic attraction is when, unrelated to sexual, you still wish to spend your time with them. To be closer, to know them as deeply as you can. To care and cherish, to wake up with that person every morning, to see their face and be happy simply because they are there, alive, whole. And with you. It is a joy knowing that person is in the world at all, no matter how far away or close they are. It is when you see them, your breath quickens and every part of you quivers because in that moment you are seeing the source of your happiness."
Dean smiles and obliges. It's not really a hardship, but a privilege.
After some shuffle to get off the chaise without anybody or anything falling and a relocation of a bottle to the nearby table, they step into the warm water together. It reeks of chlorine, so the first thing Castiel does is bury his nose in Dean's neck, trying to stave it off. With a couple of lazy laps they stop at the center of the pool, far enough away from everybody else so as not to be listened upon.
"Dean!" - grabbing his backpack, Cas stepped to the door... Finding it unlocked. - "I'm coming in, baby."
"What? No!"
like a cat!"
time with you is special. It doesn’t matter where we do it or how. What does matter is that it’s with you; us, both, doing something we both enjoy. It's more than enough."
For there isn't a minute of rest, not a moment of reprieve.
"That's... not what it looks like?"
Dean promised himself, he'd find the owner or a new house for the creature soon.
"С чего я должен тебе верить? Если Яга - твоя госпожа, это всё может быть очередной ловушкой."
"Tell anybody, and I'll bury you," - he said to Cas before he left.
A moment of silence falls inside the car. The steady rumble of the engine and the whirring of wheels on the road are the only sounds for quite a while.
Finally, everybody was on board, the doors closed and the bus was off to their actual destination. Which lay at least 5 hours away, and that was if the roads stayed clear.
He must've thought that hard enough for Cas to pick up and as they step to their table, he stumbles, groaning under his breath.
And while their friends nod approvingly, Sam bores his calculating and slightly surprised look at Dean, who just shrugs. He might not be perfect, but he definitely won't give the kid the same struggles he was suffering with and spout some homophobic bullshit. He’s heard it enough in his life. In his own head too.
It'd hurt, the words were like glass in his mouth, but the pain in his heart was stronger.
How can he be enough for this amazing creature?
The crinkling lines around his eyes when he laughed.
Cas was too distracted with Dean's taste to stop.
Bitter and sweet, and so,
Behind him, Cas chuckled, low and dangerous, as if he’d heard his thoughts, and maybe he had, because those damned fingers went straight for it this time, pressing, massaging in torturously good circles, and all Dean could do was moan and thrust against them, wanting even more.
Just like he always did before kissing him goodbye, after the nights they shared...
He had to be, he had to be just here...
"Like this."
The long, messy, hungry ones, Dean stole in the precious moments of their private time. When Cas melted into his arms.
well... Jack."
"Well... Screw it. It's the douche that was harassing you. Can't give you any details, but let's just say he's far from a nice guy."
The bathroom on the bus had been frozen solid from the night before and was judged unusable.
"Charlie...? Dude, it was you who broke up with me!"
"Ha?..." - she looked in between them. Then she lit up with understanding and... smiled. She dared to smile, while Cas was... - "LARPing and the game night."
Where Dean was worried about Cas, who just pushed them aside, lining up Dean's cock...
Kissing Cas is an enticing enough thought for Dean to finally crack one eye open, focusing on the vague figure looming over him...
He lies in bed, refusing to move or fully wake up... A random twitch of his leg breaks the moment and he feels it.
But across all the celebration, he still glances at Dean. And Dean can't do anything but smile at the kid, saluting with his beer bottle. Because whatever he calls himself, whoever he loves or doesn’t, as long as he is good and treats them right - he is totally fine exactly as he is.
Before leaning down, lips coming up against the pulse point, the blood rushing in those veins hypnotising him with its sweet cadence.
The eager pushes of Dean's hips meeting his thrusts wouldn't let him.
They point the Impala into the proper lane, Dean falling quiet and pensive.
"Oh, we're just peachy, it's Dean here who was all sad and mopey without you!"
Always bringing Cas sweets Charlie.
<<"Is he bothering you?">>
It was useful in his job, but as Charlie’s face twisted in the uncomfortable grimace, even Cas could see that it wasn't working for his interpersonal relationship.
Dean nods along, still fascinated by the sword. That is, until they walk to the exit, having scoured all of the rooms in the little cave and end up on the verge of a near vertical cliff.
"Не тронь дитятко, Богатырь, и я тебе в некоторое время пригожусь."
“Well, let’s start with what you want to do, then?”
But even though it wasn't it is all he has at the moment. When Castiel turns from the new path back to the stone, it’s already disappeared along with the familiar, leaving Castiel with only one way - forward.
Dean returned his tie in a week.
in love.
To just let him go, like that, without a fight or a final argument suddenly didn't look like such a good idea.
He groans, persisting still, while the angel peppers his neck and shoulders with claiming bites, leaving mark after mark, relishing each beautiful bruise that draw those panting whines out of Dean's throat. Castiel traces Dean’s clavicle with his tongue and then dives just a little bit lower to suck on a nipple, worrying a hardened peak with his teeth and lips.
The cabin is... nice. There is little doubt about it. It looks and feels just that - nice.
"Hello, Dean."
"Really, boys, you have a room for all that. Even if you're very pretty to look at."
At least until he lifted his head and saw Dean again.
And now he here was, with Charlie on his arm and that same rapier in another.
And then vibrations and thrusts start again, and again, until he is begging for mercy.
A shadow of touch.
He got only a devious chuckle in response before teeth closed around his mating mark in a hard bite.
"Then you shouldn't have ended up here in the first place! Idiot..."
"Shit."
"If I went to Home Depot to buy this item the sign would say 'beach chaise.'"
"Well then. What are you waiting for?"
That gets him giggles and some wiggles too, and finally a look, only a glance from beneath fluttering eyelashes. But that is enough it bring a smile to Castiel lips, and enough to deliver a teasing bite to the left ass cheek of the man before him.
Cas wanted to talk to the stranger, who was still hugging him, but the creep was so close... And very much listening to them, glaring at the newcomer with an avid hatred.
But he's so spent already, breathless and powerless, propped up only by Cas' dick and steady palms that have moved to his hips. He wants to actually get fucked, he’s dreamed about it for too long to give up now, but...just as he’s resigned himself to his useless human body, the God--and yeah, Dean’s really gotta remember that it's an actual God fucking him--murmurs in some strange, harsh language and it's like a bomb goes off inside Dean's veins.
He was still buried in Dean when he opened his eyes, though.
That something stayed on his mind over the morning tea.
Dean liked the taste of Cas' release on his tongue.
mine."
Cas was...
He almost draws the blade on her, ready to defend himself from the attack, but instead the lioness... speaks.
When it becomes clear that Dean isn't going to make them, Castiel takes the last steps forward himself. It rings true for more than just this moment, but unlike so many times in their life before, Dean doesn't resist. He goes into his hands easily, returning the embrace instantly, and his lips are soft under the kiss.
There Dean smiled for him, and kissed him, humming happily at his touch.
Just like their overall position.
Good. Bad. Fascinating. Boring.
What really worried Dean, was that the bus moved slower and slower.
They were almost there.
"What?! Cas, you didn't say we won't be... alone..."
“Oh gods, where the hell are you touching my cat! No wonder she runs away from you!" Dean was joking, actually. But as he made an affronted face, just... hinting on a protective posture, standing between Sam and the cat. The cat practically burst with purring, quickly climbing up Dean's body, clinging to his clothes with its tiny claws before it could lay across his shoulders. And look at Sam and laughing Eileen as if she were a queen, and they - the ground under her feet...paws...whatever!
It was truth he couldn't break the contact, not just yet. His magic was tactile in nature, so to heal all the wounds, he had to...
"It is a hunt, and it's not going
"You won't."
Being teased by Cas writhing over him.
And now they were embracing someone else.
The stockings were smooth under his palm, and coarser texture of lace on the thigh, keeping it in place.
The lace, blue and black, still all there.
"Господи... Слушай, единственная причина почему она до сих пор не вычислила кто вы такие и не убила твоего паренька - это я. Я убедил её, что твоя аура такая странная, потому что ты просто ведьмак, который забрался, куда не просили. Бабка почти ослепла на старости лет, но это не значит, что её стоит недооценивать."
He tugged at Dean's ear. Knowing precisely what that did to Dean.
With that smile he meets Dean's eyes when he finally opens them, bleary and blinking slowly. He balks, just a twinge, meeting his gaze and groans.
He was quick to answer. Quick enough. Not his fault that Sam decided to sneak up on him while he was stocking up on... blankets.
They stand on a narrow cliff, free of greens, guarded by a low flimsy railing that does nothing to hide the startling beauty behind it. The sundown is in its prime, and all the sky, so vast and close from up here is painted with a blinding kaleidoscope of orange, yellow, purple and blues. The lake below just adds to the brilliancy. Its shiny surface reflecting the spectacle from above, but there it mixes with deep greens of the forest, the contrast stark and alluring. Hues and colors shift and change minutely, Dean's eye barely able to catch up and he breathes out awed and unthinking.
Her energy felt alien, strange, like a too hard drink that he suddenly downed in one go... But it also warmed him up from inside the same too. Where was exhaustion, now was magic burning bright and strong again. The chimera purred a short, weird sound, licked his cheek and jumped back to her owner's hands.
"That wasn't what?!" - Dean wasn't fighting his grip anymore. He wasn't fighting at all. He was thinking, and for the first time ever not paying any attention to the little crowd they assembled.
"How can I help?" - green eyes snapped towards him, suddenly aware and curious.
Too beautiful for Dean to hold back any longer, moaning Cas' name with his own release that shook him to the bone.
"I know! Why would he even... I offered so many times..."
And he can see it, right as it happens, his belly distending from the sheer amount of cum Cas keeps pumping into him.
It had a perfect voice too, in addition to everything else - low and gruff, rolling over Dean, making him shiver with something very different from fear.
"Well, I do. And... I want you close."
"Out," - gritted out Cas, his voice edging on another growl, crimson eyes never leaving his mate.
He sighs and moves on, meeting Cas in the living room, where he just unearthed Dean's lonely sock from under the couch. It’s green and Dean knows exactly how it ended up there.
Everybody laughs, and their new acquaintances show them the food courts. Before that, Cas tugs at his wrist gently, a questioning look of concern, and Dean simply kisses him. It’s sweet and tender, a mutual assurance that they are alright. They will be.
She is swift, if slightly uncoordinated, and almost manages to trap Dean in a hug, but another person stops her just in time with a firm grip on the tanned shoulder.
For so many years he was Dean's obsession, unspoken, denied, buried right along with pain and unwanted memories. Except, he was always wanted, too much even, too strongly for Dean to acknowledge to himself, let alone to anybody else. He spent so much time running from it, and now that he doesn't have to, he can't help himself but always think about it.
And as always, Dean comforts him, ever the protector. Ready to put someone else's happiness before his own. Castiel wants to make sure he never has to again, wants to allow him plenty of opportunities to be selfish, but right now, he just hugs him tightly.
They exchanged a quick texts while hunkering down for the night, establishing shifts to watch the creep.
"Cease your crying, citizen! You have nothing to fear while I'm here!"
Cas glanced at the cat again, noticing something else strange...
And in between repelled alien invasions and secret bunkers that Benny loved so much, he somehow pieced together the not so happy story of the girl. And that she was bored and sad. And didn't have anything to do. Her mother was tired and broke...
A very, very nice bomb; energizing, healing, leaving the human still breathless but still no longer ready for one more round… More like three.
Dean's brain short-circuited for a second there.
Dean loved hearing Cas talk. About anything - the medicine, his studies, all those weird convoluted terms Dean had zero idea about... But the way Cas' eyes lit up, the passion in his voice, it was mesmerising.
Sam's affronted yelling quiets down when István engages him in some talk about running routines and rabbit food, or something.
Still.
"Another five would be nice, because why in the hell the fucking house would have. Chicken, Legs?!!"
"Ha. Well, I like you already, Cas. Welcome to the family! I'll be taking this idiot off your hands for now," - Sam chimed in.
And growling at everybody who tried to stop him.
Because those tentacles are fucking amazing. And amazing at fucking too.
And Cas just took it, not stopping, but encouraging, his evening scruff highlighting every caress with its tingly slide.
Lady was fast enough to scramble away as Dean shot up, grabbing Cas' face in his hands.
The room burst with colors and the light, as Cas' back burst with half ethereal, shiny and new spectral wings.
"Hello, Dean."
"I love you, Dean."
This was familiar...
That was the best way to make sure Cas would be okay.
He was... generous sometimes. Very.
No plot, all smut over here. Feel free to skip if it's not your cup of tea. :3
"Like what?"
"That's... impossible. Chimeras are extinct!"
"Yeah, okay... I'm just... Not that good at talking about my feelings, okay? As you might have noticed."
With a face that showed his eternal suffering, he looked up at the ceiling. Took a breath. And only then did he turned to Dean.
Cas even closed his jacket back and was cuddling into Dean far closer, trying to stay warm too.
And he took her around the bus sitting on his shoulders.
"Да чтоб тебя! Бесполезный человечишка! Отвечай же!!"
It meant he remembered every moment they spent together.
more similar tentacles creeping around him.
"Yes, Dean did. He emphasized that it is very important to be safe, use protection and always ask for partners consent. Also..."
Holstering his weapon, pulling out handcuffs to put them on the whimpering fucker.
He had work in... Four hours, the clock showed.
Telling the most
"Just look at you... So pretty..."
He deserved it, for interrupting that delicious, excellent kiss he just shared with Cas.
Still, no matter how much he wanted to, he simply couldn't focus properly. Couldn't make his lips work.
“Do you think… She…” his voice breaks, but with another deep breath Dean fights the tears away and finishes. At long last voicing the worry that has been eating away at him for weeks now. “Do you think she would approve? Of us? Mom?”
"Not throwing up. So. Awesome," - when he smirked, Castiel only nodded, totally serious.
"Shouldn't we be working?"
"Yes. And how did you figured it's a she?"
It takes them a little while to actually get up from the bed.
In the rear view mirror, Dean can see as Jack's eyes go big with wonder and he shifts closer to the edge of his seat. Palms on his knees, rapt with attention, as if he were a kid getting ready for a bedtime story. And Cas seems to be inclined to provide.
The room erupts in cheers and applause, Arin at Dean’s side whistles her lungs out, deafening him for a moment with the volume. Dean's eyes, however, are glued to the stage.
happens. I just need to check in with the driver. Okay?"
So... casually, as if it was a habit.
"Yes."
"Can you... Make them visible? You know, without my eyes burning out. That'd probably put a damper on the mood."
There was blood and a hissing cat, and Dean, yelping with pain and yelling at said cat every expletive he knew.
Right into Charlie's arms who peeked from the corner, concern all over her cute face...
. Slow enough, so that Alistair took his focus off of Cas, clearly not seeing him as a threat...
He whispers his secrets in the angel’s ear, burrowing deeper into his neck.
Impatient as Dean was, swearing and begging, and promising that he's good, and Cas can just do it, that he wants it, wants
The pool is packed though, seemingly every current guest of the resort hiding from the rain or just enjoying the heated water.
He's ready to thank her for the warning but in a blink of an eye they're both gone, like they were never there with only trees and the high grass swaying lightly in the breeze.
hurt. He was so happy, because clearly, Cas was accepting. One second before, and now he was... not? What the hell?
it was so...
"Okay, come on, have some mercy. My girl asked for the cocktail. Make her a Blue Hawaii then, and whatever beer you have for me."
"You're... okay?" - it was the taller werewolf who asked. Dean was busy staring angrily at Lady.
Dean was mumbling. Still purring, the sound mingling with the words, distorting them a bit. Distracting Cas, who gasped at suddenly being flipped over. Now he was laying on top of Dean, who was still smiling brilliantly.
Dean's guest was in the shower when he decided to get up, finally.
"Hm... Alright. That doesn't... exactly means no. Unless he said no. Did he say no? How did you approach him?"
"Wait, wait, wait, so Vasilisa wasn't the Baba Yaga?!"
And then he’s painted by the white drops, all over his face and chest, mingling with his own cum on his stomach.
A pair of culprits would explain all the inconsistencies, especially the reek of magic from one of the bodies among all the couples that was absent from the others. So the Familiar most likely wasn't lying... Plus Koshey was one of the possibilities Sam had mentioned as well, so the angel was inclined to believe at least that, if not the rather confusing motivation of said monsters.
"Beloved."
Who gave up on sitting upright fifteen minutes in and went down. Settling his head on Dean's lap. And then he opened his book and started reading. Just like that.
"I am glad, Dean."
That is until he was punched right in the face by his brother, shaking him out of the trance.
Dean's eyes however were drawn to a totally different part of sudden apparition’s anatomy. His (it was a male shaped apparition at least) dick was... just... huge.
Slow enough for Alistair to get frustrated. Slow enough for Benny to sneak from the other side of the alley, still too far away to do anything, but
It was when Dean got maybe about a third of it in, swallowing hungrily around it, unable to stop his own noises that he heard Cas moan for the first time. It was laced with an undercurrent of something else, a growl or a purr, something not human and ridiculously hot, making Dean quiver and squirm in his seat, wishing for nothing more than to have that dick in his ass, splitting him open. He whined and struggled, but Cas' hand in his hair was unrelenting as he pulled him off.
Yet, there are people around--watching them like some kind of fascinating reality show, no less--so instead of doing what they all expect, what Dean is probably expecting... He instead extends his right wing. It's unseen and unheard, barely even in this dimension right now, but Dean feels it as the angel drags the feathers up his foot, from the ankle and up, rubbing right along his inner thigh.
It was getting harder with every second that Cas searched blindly for Dean's lips, begging for a kiss.
The nephilim’s eyes light up for a moment with gold and he smiles, elated, before shaking himself out of it and bouncing yet again.
And then the tender moment is burst with laughter once again. "I guess that would make Dean my... stepmother? Stepfather? Hm."
The kind where he can undress under the watchful and very attentive eye of his favorite human, seeing his breath quicken when he hurries to toss his own clothes off just as fast.
And dead-center of it all, the familiar cat is sitting on the already familiar stone that now bears only one message.
Something that’s a part of something more, something bigger and better than him.
He might've not learned much of actual medicine yet, but he knew enough to do at least the basic exam.
It is perfect.
"You okay there, Cas?"
Finally able to slide his palms over the stockings and the lace.
Dean really doesn't like feeling useless however, so he tries to at least stand. Maybe he can distract the thing long enough for Cas to stab it where it hurts...
"Like?"
"Can I blow you?" - the words slipped from Dean’s lips before he could even think them over properly. The tightening grip on his wrists, that Castiel--or at least that's what he’d called himself anyway--didn't release, and the brightening glow of his eyes told him it wasn't that unwelcome a suggestion.
This time it was a rush of stifled laughter. Including some from the jury. And even though the defense tried and tried to milk something out of him... Dean already knew that Cas just probably saved everybody from that psycho once again.
The main lobby is drowned in darkness, interrupted only by the twinkling lights reflecting off the disco ball. It’s been redecorated for the occasion, little tables with cosy lamps for couples and little groups, the bar working overtime to keep up with the crowd the evening attracted. Seems like every guest and even some newly arrived people wish to partake, if not in the show, than at least in the festivities and see the entertainment for themselves.
It isn’t the words, or the touch--all intensely pleasurable, of course--so much as the
"Sorry, couldn't get on at the South, work got crazy. I've missed you."
The word stuck in Cas’ head for the day.
"Why did you eat them then?" - Cas asked, more to himself rather than actually expecting an answer.
Just as the singer sang about assholes in love, Dean nodded, accepting his hand.
"Really, Cas? That's what you're leading with?"
Which is how Dean was now making those exact amends. By going with the compromise and holding off the mating before they could date and get to know each other better. Because "wolves just know that a mate is perfect" was not a convincing enough argument.
Cas shook the strange thoughts away, focusing on the wounds that he had to get clean before the actual healing.
“I’m… I am. Happy. With you.”
With whispered praises and purring growls in his ears, Dean’s still considering whether to safeword out.
They are clinging to Dean so tightly, stroking ever so slightly up and down his arms. He drops a light kiss to invisible feathery limb, feeling it shake and shaking with it, the tingles turning to fire and yearning.
They are fine and together and as Dean drives, eventually flooding the Impala with familiar classic tunes from the old cassette player, he finds himself in some strange state that's been popping up more and more lately.
Maybe he needs to pay less attention to that because Cas growls, so quietly only Dean can hear and pushes their clasped hands higher on Dean's thigh, right into his steadily growing erection.
"What are you even supposed to be?"
A single "that" was said with such awe and enthusiasm, that Cas laughed, snuggling to his boyfriend to kiss him.
"Well, I say you'll live. Mind showing me your badge?"
It was just there, in between one breath and the next, and Dean was moaning encouragement in his ear.
They’d met in college on the Cinematography course Dean randomly picked up between chasing his Masters in Advertisement. They found an easy friendship and fairly satisfying, no-strings-attached sex in each other and had never really separated since then. It’s also a huge plus right now that Benny is a talented operator bored to death with his current job on the local TV network.
"Damn, baby... I'm gonna leave more often if you keep meeting me like that."
He opened his eyes, the green so beautifully illuminated by the morning sun, and smiled.
"Radar?.. I do not have a radar. Sam, should I have one?"
Dean can see Cas standing near his head, watching intently as his tentacle dick fucks Dean's mouth. Tracing the edge of his stretched lips with his fingertips, his grin wild.
Castiel, at least.
"Dean! Please..."
The barman took one look at him and gave him a bottle of water.
Castiel wants to make him forget to breathe entirely so he shifts closer, capturing wet lips with his own. They exchange slow, deliberate kisses as they bob on the surface with occasional sweeps of their legs to keep afloat.
"And here you are, like this. Waiting for me, so fucking pretty... So sexy, and all for me. Perfect. Would keep you in bed 24/7 if I could. Just fucking into that tight ass. Would let you ride me all you want..."
"Nope. No more tacos for me. Not without you around."
To hell with Dean's reluctance, it was no time to be picky, and even if he didn't want Cas that way, he had to drink from him anyway. Cas simply would not let him suffer. Not when he could help.
<<"Go straight - both be dead.">>
Bright against the fair skin, pink splotches of blush blooming on Cas' cheekbones. And then he bit his lower lip.
"How can you call it a beach
"Any suggestions for a walk?"
Cas lost his breath and his jaw when Dean looked back, a light blush at his pretty freckled cheeks, and that smile still there.
Craving it, the touch, the pain, the bursting pangs of pleasure radiating from the fangs sinking deep.
Good thing his apron was covering up any... eagerness he might have felt after his "talk" with Cas.
Where he used to find comfort in the routine of his days, just passing by, one by one, now he found... that he was missing something.
Dean is quite frankly startled and a little bit disturbed at the woman--the clerk from before--that managed to sneak up on them both, it seems. Even if they were quite... distracted.
A laugh that was smothered by a hungry kiss.
"I'd be honored... and happy... to call someone like that my mate. Someone like
Dean's phone is in his hands, though, so he has to guess. There are still a few stragglers, others like him running from the rain and every one of them seem to flock to the building with the pool. It seems reasonable to at least check there before going back to the cabin and lo and behold, Dean is right there, washing mud off his feet in one of the open standing showers on the side.
<<"In any case, you know there’s an offer and are free to refuse. You can do with it as you will, but maybe at least hear me out?">>
Releasing their venom, forcing a helpless moan out of Cas.
"Good boy," - it was just a common phrase. Just something to calm him down. But Dean could feel the shiver that went through Cas with it all through his own body. There was no hiding a sharp intake of breath either.
was the limit and he keened as a sudden orgasm tore through him, stars in his eyes and toe-curlingly good, without his dick being touched once and a strangled cry of Cas' names on his swollen lips.
"We don't have to do it that way if you're uncomfortable, Dean. I told you, it does not matter to me if we are... public. Knowing that you are mine is more than enough."
Adjusting his position slightly and stretching as much as he could without jostling Cas, Dean listened to his body. He wasn't cold - big plus there, he was hungry though, slightly numb in places, but overall pretty good. He even managed to feel fairly rested, despite the uncomfortable seat and the headache-inducing pillow in the form of Cas' backpack.
The second before the creeper's sword is buried in Dean's chest however, his angel is already there. Flying over the cursed bed to kick the weapon out of skeletal hands and then they are once again trading blows in an ever increasing tempo.
It was huge!
Their souls breathed in unison, as they drifted off to sleep.
<<"What?..">>
"The mech-what?"
Rising up, from that place deep inside his being where his magic originated.
Cas steps on it tentatively, a mic in the tight grip of his hand but he doesn't lift his eyes until he sets it in the stand.
But he did, and the expression in Dean's eye as though Cas hit him, echoed in bittersweet pain inside him.
"Nah, he's... alright, I guess, for a cat. Cas checked him. And if he does start something? Well, we can always return and gank him then."
Dean scoffs. His arms still around Charlie's shoulders and she leaned into him.
Turning on his heel, taking a step to the side, leaving the immediate range of the possible shot.
That is until Castiel dives down, under his cock, the undiluted scent of
"Cas..."
"And no, Jack, she did not go evil. She met Timofey, a prisoner, just like her. They bonded, became friends and eventually even fell in love. And they devised a plan to get out and be free together."
Meg had just laughed at him, waving his concerns off with "you looked like you were having fun, didn't want to interrupt". He had not had any fun.
"Izbushka, though..." - Dean grumbles finally under his breath and Cas' eye rolls so hard it almost heard.
That hope flared brighter as Cas' eyes flew open wide, shocked. But not with disgust, as Dean feared. Cas was blushing. Dropping his hands and ruffling his hair, and blushing further.
Simply floating in the gentle ocean of the sinfully delightful afterglow.
Moving in general feels almost painful, a numbing weakness spreading through his muscles with every breath. It is most certainly something magical and very, very nasty.
He freaked out even more, when wooden fingers locked onto his wrist from that wall he kept fucking against. And then, following those fingers, came the rest of a body.
"Well.. Thank you, Dean."
Timofey snorts, the annoyed frown on his face morphing into something almost hateful. He is not a fan of the Koshey, that much is obvious even without the followed insults.
He most definitely does not need it and Dean knows that, but Castiel can't turn down the excited look on his human's face, and obediently turns, exposing his back. There are warm palms on it right away, spreading the cool gel evenly, from his shoulders and down in practically a massage. Castiel hums contentedly, closing his eyes and simply enjoying the sun on his face and Dean's touches. There are chuckles and even some snorts around them.
"Son of a bitch! What the hell, I thought you had him!"
With half an eye on the fidgeting creep to the side, Dean sunk to one knee, careful not to sink down completely. The floor was wet with melted snow and he had enough dirt on him from the bathroom already.
He feels the slick and the cum slipping out of him with each slow thrust, but it hardly makes it easier.
"Yeah, all chicks, what that has to do with anything?"
Cas made sure to get up and take a step back to his backpack before actually asking that. He was far from being as naive as he looked. People lied all the time. Pretty people probably did it even more.
He can feel it all.
He laughs and Cas kisses him again, short little touches, and in between Cas whispers his name as if it is a prayer, a plea, a vow. It makes Dean's insides flutter and he can't find it in himself to care, he just presses in closer. They fall on the bed, right next to half-unpacked bag, Cas' breath hitching up, blue eyes laughing and sparkling, just on the verge of a glow.
But it's inevitable, Cas managed to explain at least that much. Despite Dean being able to summon him that one time, Cas was still too weak to appear consistently. He needed sustenance.
Soon, he can spend however much time he wants in his human form, the area of his influence expanding more and more.
He was grumbling, but the frigid rain and wind gave the chills even to him when he opened the window.
A chipper voice rings out way too close and way too loud for Dean's liking. He's already so close to kissing Cas senseless, to drinking those enticing words from his lips, Ukrainian or whatever they could be. And Cas actually has the gall to smirk, clearly translating Dean’s emotions as easily as he did the song. He turns to a young woman waiting patiently behind a counter, beaming with an amused smile.
Thankfully, Jack is more than happy to look up restoring spells for them without asking too many questions, though they're both sure they'll get plenty of teasing for it later on from Sam. Or maybe not, if Castiel manages to drop sufficient detail that he’d be too embarrassed to. It's really just a bonus that Dean will undoubtedly turn that adorable shade of pink if he hears it.
? WE'RE AT A POOL CAS."
The thought rushes over him in a wave of possessive desire and he growls with it, scooping up the human by his thighs until he clings, afraid of falling, but Castiel would never let him. Not when he gets to hold him like this, impossibly intimate, open, and opening up. Lowering him on Castiel’s aching cock, as careful as he can with a roaring fire of want raging in his veins.
He was already intrigued. He’d never actually seen a werewolf before, mostly on account that their regeneration and natural immunity to diseases made them nearly unkillable and very rarely in need of a healer’s attention.
Dean whined, the pain of his mate echoing in his chest, the guilt and despair making his almost nauseas... He opened his arms, the instinctual need to provide comfort, and he didn't evade the right hook to his face.
That warranted another mark, at least. Mirroring the first one, but on the other side.
Cas puts in every line. Even though he's more speaking than singing, the audience is entranced right along with Dean.
It was hard to keep his fangs at bay, especially with Cas so clearly enjoying himself. Trembling and moaning with every bite Dean left on his skin.
He just wanted to sleep.
The creep flings him back into bed at that, a frustrated growl revealing a row of sharp looking teeth.
The beauty around them is indeed even more impressive from up high. And the silent, now steady glide of the mortar allows Dean an unobstructed view to the valley and the lake; to the mountains hugging it, to the rolling waves of evergreen trees, swaying gently in the breeze.
Over the next few months their team and the audience only grow.
Dean wasn't appreciative of his brother doubting his ability to court a mate. Not. At. All.
“It’s okay, Dean… I’ve got you. I won’t let you fall. Ever. Do you want to look? It is a rather good view here.”
Knew and loved how Dean would always just go slack and completely pliant, only able to moan his pleasure with eyes rolled into his head.
A partner.
The bathroom was empty. The stalls were empty, he wasn't either in men's or women's... He wasn't in the diner either.
It's luck that Dean has his eyes closed, riding the waves of please and heat, when it hits him.
"Are you okay?"
They have over a dozen different scenes set up now, proper equipment for filming and editing, even quarters for employees if they need temporary lodgings or just a couple of days rest after the more intense shoots.
His angel holds him through it, wings falling back to glide against Dean’s sides, and there is instead a calloused palm, wringing every drop of Dean's pleasure out of him with quick sharp strokes. His moans get swallowed in a kiss, which is sloppy and disjointed and somehow even better for it. He can feel Cas' control slipping in the hungry movements of his lips and he wants to see it shutter completely.
But, inevitably, there is nothing left to pack.
With the shimmering and warm being by his side, keeping him afloat and promising him the world and beyond.
"The weather is nice!" - parrots Arin, still giggling. "And he was totally moping without you, by the way! You should have seen him, all worried and antsy, and he practically ran when you called. That's some codependency if I've ever seen it."
