“We can stay up, until Rosie falls back to sleep. You can show me some movies I’ve never seen if you want.”
“Yeah, Sherlock, we can make it a third time, and a fourth time, we can kiss as many times as we want.”
The second time, they were in the living room, Rosie was demolishing her stuffed bee while watching the television. Sherlock was sat on the couch while John fixed them breakfast. John’s specialty was eggs with beans on toast. Sometimes, he would sneak a few slices of ham from Mrs. Hudson while she was away and then cook it for their meal. Sherlock never much cared for breakfast, but with John, he would gladly sit and share a meal. He looked into the kitchen to see his lover standing over the stove humming some tune in his head. Sherlock smirked at how adorable he found the man to be at times. Rosie was tugging at his pant leg, he looked down and saw the blue-eyed baby smiling up at him with her fist in her mouth.
John stepped inside the house. Mycroft shut the door behind him. While they walked down the hall, John pressed gentle kisses into Kylie’s hair. This wasn’t her scent. He changed her shampoo. He set her down on the couch in the living room and took his seat next to her. Mycroft sat in the armchair adjacent to the two. He watched as Kylie crawled back into John’s lap and took her seat there. John rested his chin on top of her head. Mycroft couldn’t help but notice how John looked so…relieved was the word. A part of Mycroft felt bad for doing this to John and Kylie, but John wasn’t well. He needed to take care of himself before he could take care of Kylie. It’s what Sherlock would have wanted, he was sure.
I turned my head a bit, so I could inhale the scent of your hair, of the products you put in it. You shifted a bit. You liked it. Before I was even knew what I was doing, I was kissing your curls, and gently caressing them. I nuzzled my face into them and loved every moment of it. That’s when I felt your finger twirling about in my chest hair, you weren’t sleeping after all. I removed myself from your tresses and tried to get a good look at your face. You were awake now, eyes opened and everything. I whispered your name, it sounded foreign, coming out of my mouth. I felt like I’ve never said it before, at least, not in the soft tone I used. You stopped messing with the hairs on my chest and then laid your hand flat on top of them. You sat up and turned to face me. You looked so vulnerable in the moonlight, Sherlock, like something that shouldn’t be touched or else it would break. You looked gorgeous.
Harry’s brown eyes widened. She was doing that thing we did when we were kids, she would act like something was more important than what it really was and try to focus all of your attention on that.
I should have known that you were going to be so paranoid about it. If you didn’t know enough about something, you worried yourself with every little detail on the subject. I wish you didn’t scare yourself with all of that nonsense, Sherlock. Negativity, piled on top of more negativity, it’s just pointless. Or maybe, I shouldn’t be the one to tell you that would be a bit hypocritical I suppose.
At that, both picked up speed, John slapping Sherlock’s ass with each thrust, and Sherlock gasping into John’s shoulder, leaving wounds from his fingernails and scratch marks along his back. Sherlock’s screams grew higher and their bodies became sweaty from the friction of their skin. John could feel Sherlock’s stomach tighten and he knew that Sherlock was coming.
‘Sherlock, it’s getting close to lunch time.’ I said loudly to get your attention, if I haven’t already caught it by the pounding in the steps and Kylie’s gurgles here and there. ‘What do you want to eat?’ I was planning on ordering takeaway because there was no way Kylie was going to let me cook anything that afternoon. You didn’t respond to me the first time, and you weren’t in the kitchen or the living area, so you had to be in the bedroom. I reiterated my question again, and then I heard your voice, it was weaker and it sounded strained. I rushed to our bedroom to find you laying on our bed moaning.
"John Watson, meet....John Watson. Sherlock Holmes, meet...well...the other you is downstairs with a concussion."
“We chatted a bit on the phone, talked about her new job and whatnot. She’s stepping up in the business world, I’m proud of her. She asked me out for a cuppa a few days ago, I declined. I didn’t want her to see me like this, I wanted her to see me as the Harry she fell in love with all those years ago. I think I’m ready to see her now, I want to see her, and I miss her.”
“Marriage is the union of husbands in heart, body and mind. It is intended for their mutual joy – and for the help and comfort given on another in prosperity and adversity. But more importantly – it is a means through which a stable and loving environment may be attained.”
John looked a bit disappointed, but one look at Sherlock’s gorgeous face and he moved in to kiss him again.
I brought your hand up to my lips and rested them on it. I rubbed your hand with the pad of my thumb.
“Good, now, I’ll be behind you lot, don’t turn to face me when you hear my voice, just stay like that.”
Sherlock shut his eyes and turned away, he would have moved his whole body if John wasn’t holding onto his arm. It wasn’t firm, and he could have easily shrugged him off, but John didn’t comment on it.
Sherlock set his phone down and rubbed Rosie’s back as she slept. He felt his phone vibrate and picked it up immediately.
“No, go to work. I’m sorry if I’ve been getting you into trouble, I’ve been doing that a lot, haven’t I?”
It took you some minutes to actually attempt to form any words. I was still kneeling, holding onto the half-empty pill bottle as if my life depended on it.
"Our friend here needs rest and you two are standing here yapping away like women having their afternoon tea. Don't you think this can wait until tomorrow morning?"
The three men gaped at each other. The Doctor walked over to John and waved a hand in his face. He wasn't surprised that John wasn't responding to it. He then repeated the gesture to Watson and then Holmes, to no avail. Eventually, he thought it best that he just let them handle the situation as they saw fit. Hopefully nothing bad comes of this.
"I believe that I am still clever, Doctor. Using the past-tense implies that I was once at an earlier stage in time, but am now not."
They arrived at the park some minutes later. John and Kylie made their way over to the jungle gym. Surprisingly, there were almost no children playing. At most there were four or five kids playing a game that they no doubt created with their imagination. John gave them twenty minutes before their moms, who clearly came together, would tell them to wrap it up. He didn't have to look far to see the familiar face grinning madly at him and waving him over. He put a false smile on his face and walked over to her. He couldn't believe it, she looked exactly the same from when he saw her all those months ago. The last time he remembered seeing her was at Sherlock's funeral, her lips quivered the whole service, and he could barely see her face behind the handkerchief she used. She cried for the both of them that day. He admitted that her smile was a nice change from the face she wore then. Maybe this wouldn't be so bad.
The smile on my face could not be contained. You would have never said these things to me on an ordinary day, if you did, it wouldn’t be this straight-forward. Then, I wished that you hadn’t said all of those wonderful words to me, and that I wished that I said something remotely close to yours. All I said was ‘Holmes-Watson.’ You grinned at the correction and then you let me hold you, proper that time. I never let you go that night, nope, I wouldn’t dare. I didn’t want you to go anywhere.
‘…You weren’t quite the same after that day,’ Mycroft continued. ‘You stopped playing the yard, and you even stopped seeking me out for company.’
Sherlock wiped away his tears and nodded furiously, chuckling with a smile so wide his eyes were nearly closed. He placed his hands in John’s and kept nodding.
“My dear Watson, I completely understand from where you are coming from, and I agree with you whole-heartedly. I won’t lie to you there will always be that underlying pain that is resentment inside of my very core, and I don’t think that it will go anywhere. But I can live and I can live with you knowing that somewhere in the vast darkness that is time and space that there are two men, who will slumber in the same bed, who will touch each other in a way we don’t dare to touch one another, who will share a relationship that those who are of a man and a woman and not have any regrets and live in shame, two men who will be married and bask in all that is domestic bliss. I can rejoice that those two men go by the names Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, are the same men who share all those privileges that a wife and husband should. While there is little joy in my life, Watson, I shall find the joy in that, just as you are.”
The Doctor looked at everybody's astonished faces and clasped his hands together, his smile was slowly fading.
‘I need to tell you now, before you tell me to shut up, or change the subject entirely that I love you. From the moment you walked through that door at Bart’s, I knew that you would change my life. I wasn’t sure for the better or worse, but I was willing to see which, and I think it’s safe to say that you changed me for the better.’
John swished the warm liquid in his mouth before he swallowed it. He saw Sherlock's eyes lingering over the matching tuxedos that they were going to wear for their wedding tomorrow morning, and then he thought about Sherlock's change in attitude. Ah, he put it together. Sherlock just has a case of pre-wedding nerves, it's understandable. He set the cup down on the nightstand and then shuffled closer to Sherlock, wrapping his arms around the small waist and resting his chin on Sherlock's shoulder.
“Well they went with that Doctor fellow, yes? I’m sure they’ll be back. If they’re anything like us then they are more than capable of fighting off any trouble, should they run into it.”
John saw the tear slide down Sherlock’s cheek. He couldn’t believe what he was seeing and yet he hated it. He hated for being the cause of the tears.
….Anyway, like everyone else, she dashed right over to the infant, who was snuggled in my arms. She cooed at first, and then fawned a bit, until she got it all out her system and was ready to talk to me. The brother she hasn’t seen for years.
He heard Sherlock saying all of those things, and he can still see his husband giving that warm smile as he says it. John wipes at the tears that have managed to fall and sniffs to try and stop anymore from falling. He could still hear Sherlock’s voice, ringing throughout his head and his eyes were now glazed over.
‘Very good, I’ll give you a ring later on today to discuss things further, I have two other patients that need seeing to.’ He didn’t even give me a chance to say anything. He turned around and walked out of the room. I gave you a pat on the back and you rose back up like a vampire rising from its coffin. I tried to make some light out of the situation; I’m not really good at that so I apologize if I made things worse. You just got diagnosed with cancer, Sherlock, I don’t know if anyone can be easily swayed with a joke or two. You gave me a glare; you were upset; of course you were.
She was lenient with us on the first night, which was good. But then she got comfortable and decided that every other hour she would wake us with her wails of attention or hunger or something else. You pretended that you couldn’t hear her, so it was always me rushing to save the day, or what little sleep we had left. I spent so many days going to work exhausted, that I forgot that I was at work for a while. Thankfully, my boss understood, and she even took the time out of her busy schedule to reminisce with me the days when she was a new parent. I didn’t care much, obviously, but she was my boss and we needed the money now more than ever, so I sat there with the fakest smile I could muster, and listened to her drone on and on and on.
Holmes was about to move his chair closer to Sherlock's until he found a small chip in the back of his chair.
"I want to believe you, Doctor, I do, but you don't know how bad he can get with addiction. He just can't handle it."
I had just taken a bite of my biscuit when he asked me, so I had to swallow first. When I opened my mouth to tell him, one of the officers signaled for everyone to grab their gifts. I rolled my eyes at once again being interrupted, but Greg grabbed me by the arm and ushered me over to the circle in the middle of the office. When the exchanges took place, l handed my present over to Greg, who opened it with a grin on his face. All I got him was a new flask because Sherlock nicked his one time out of spite and I am not sure where it is now, or if it is even safe to be used anymore. He slapped me on the arm and immediately went over to the drinks to fill it.
He let the tear fall from his cheek as he breathed out the chorus. God how true every word is. He loved Sherlock more than he loved himself sometimes. Since the moment they met, since the first time he met the madman whipping the corpse, he knew that there would never be anyone else for him.
'...Tomorrow...' You breathed. Mycroft was frozen for a good minute before he found the words and actions. Which were very few, I might add.
He turned back around to speak to Sherlock, but he was gone. John's smile wavered again at his disappearance. Why was he being teased like this? He was having a good night, and then he saw Sherlock again, but Sherlock was gone. Gone. Of course he was, John thought to himself, Sherlock isn't here. He was never one to believe in ghosts, or anything paranormal, but what if Sherlock was...
"I...I wanted to follow The Doctor....John wanted to tag along. I tried to tell him to stay back, but he's a stubborn fool. We...we...we never made it any farther than the front door before we were attacked."
He heard the rope snap as the blood started flowing through his wrists again. They made his hands feel funny but he ignored the feeling. He looked down at his wrists, definitely rope burned. He bent down to untie his ankles that were numb as well from lack of blood and let the rope fall to the floor. He stood up but had to catch his balance on the chair as his legs were not prepared for the sudden movement. He stopped himself from falling on the floor thankfully. When he regained his balance, he dusted off his coat and his pants and swiftly made his way to Sherlock's chair. Kneeling down to get Sherlock's binds off, he started whispering in his ear.
He started to pull the covers back, despite Sherlock being on top of them. The bed wasn’t spacious, but there was enough room for two. Sherlock crawled under the covers first and John joined him. John was the big spoon that night. Sherlock turned off the lamp and then rolled over to be embraced by John. He felt a light kiss to his forehead, and John’s grip around him tightened.
I remember going into work for a few minutes, I had to stop off to get something, and I brought Kylie with me because I figured she could use the fresh air. I got what I needed fairly quickly, some papers and whatnot, along with a new pair of socks in one of the stores I was walking past. Part of me was glad that you weren’t there, Sherlock. You would’ve made all the women who hit on me cry. It was upsetting me when I told them I was married to you, they all automatically assumed that I was gay because I was married to you; I know it took me a long time to come to terms with it, but bisexuality is a thing as well. And besides, even if I was gay, I would still be the happiest man in the world to be married to you. They all walked off, pissed because they couldn’t reel in their catch of the day, and I left the store to get back to you.
John was bit thrown off by the sudden mood change, but Sherlock stayed the same. Well, he would be used to the Doctor's personality if he's traveled with him before, wouldn't he? But still, John was still keeping a wary eye on him, he seemed like a good guy, but how much can a person change in a matter of years? He knows how much he changed since the war. Sherlock looked over at John.
"That there is Sherlock Holmes, the great detective. He has the greatest mind man has ever seen, if not man, then Scotland Yard. He is a consulting detective, the only one in the world."
Hey guys! I'm sorry this update took so long! I've been pretty busy with school, but I should start updating pretty regularly again. Thanks so much for your patience!
You looked so tired in that chair, Sherlock. Your hand was firmly grasping mine, but your eyes were closed and your head was tilting back. You were taking your midday nap, the nurses saw you sleeping, and then they saw me and left you alone. Your naps were frequent, and at that point, it was a part of your daily schedule. You woke up, ate something at my behest, watched some telly with me, work on the case that Greg drops off, kip, and then wake up at least two hours later and begin the cycle anew. I was almost tempted to wake you up, but you were tired and you needed rest and so I let you nap. The area we were in was quite possibly the quietest room in the hospital, understandably so. What would people say to one another? There was a lot of suffering in that room, Sherlock, but it was silent. And people who suffered in silence were the ones who hurt the most. Your session was three hours long, I couldn't help but feel bad for some of the poor sods there. Who knows they would be sat in those chairs? The amount of chemotherapy a person had to get depended on the severity of their illness. Luckily, yours wasn't too bad. At least, not yet it wasn't. I woke you up, you didn't wake until the fifth nudge or so. You looked so worn, Sherlock, and I knew that the medicine wasn't helping either. I wasted no time in getting you out of there.
Watson’s smile seemed to beam even more. John knew that it was because Holmes was actually being compliant for a change; he felt the same way whenever Sherlock agreed with him. Turning back to Sherlock and John, Watson said, “Now then, you two should go and clean up a bit, you are not suitable company for the outdoors with your clothes all disheveled. Have you nothing to change in?”
"How does Kylie deal with it? With Sherlock's passing, I mean. She was so little when it happened, I doubt that she even remembers him at all."
John passed Rosie off to him and got the ice-cream from the freezer and two spoons. When they got settled on the couch, Sherlock took a spoonful of the ice-cream and sighed when the chocolate hit his tastebuds. John chuckled and took his own helping of the dessert. It was a few minutes into the movie when Sherlock said, “I’m…not ready to talk about it…but it’s pleasant to know that I have someone to talk to.”
"I thought that you could use a good laugh right now and now I'm starting to think that I was...wrong."
‘I’m sorry Harry, it’s just Sherlock isn’t helping with the baby, he hasn’t even held her yet, he won’t feed her…’
“That is…part of it. You know, we didn’t have to eat here. If there’s too many people we can leave.”
“Don’t be a stranger, I know you both aren’t one for keeping in touch, but it was nice to you see you again. Baker Street’s a bit lonely without you two tearing the flat apart upstairs.”
I remember going into our room to check in on Kylie who was sleeping. I don't know where you were, love. You might have been in the shower, I can't recall. She looked so peaceful in her crib, Sherlock. I wish you could've taken more time out to spend with her. She loves you so much.
“She says that she is our landlady and not our housekeeper, but landladies don’t buy groceries for their tenants, or take care of them when they’re ill.”
He took a seat next to the boy who was wiping away his tears with his sleeve; his mother was going to have a fit when she sees the stains. He won't even tell her why they were there, but he knew that she knew. She's always known, and that's why they got him Redbeard.
John had the spoon his mouth when Sherlock said that. He swallowed the ice-cream and grabbed Sherlock’s hand.
“I sat and watched you get married, because you were so happy. You didn’t see how hard it was me because I didn’t let you. I picked out decorations and clothes, for a wedding that wasn’t mine. I got fitted for a tuxedo that wasn’t for a groom.”
John wasn't ready for this. Was he even giving the right reaction? He was talking to himself! This man in front of him was...it was him! Albeit they have slightly different personalities and look a bit different. But it was still him, and the other man was a different version of his injured fiance! They acted more similarly than he did with...Watson, he'll stick to Watson. Somewhere in his mind he wished that he never stepped foot into that TARDIS, or whatever it was called.
Sherlock's face went from anger to sorrow. John clumsily made his way back over to his dwindling collection of bottles filled with various types of whiskey and tried to pour himself another glass. Sherlock was shouting his name, but he wasn't responding.
John grinned and he moved to Sherlock’s lips again and Sherlock couldn’t help but wriggle in pleasure. When he finally found the strength to push him off, Sherlock said, “John, listen to me. We’re not at our house.”
Sherlock laughed and took another sip. He found himself staring at John for a while, long enough for John to notice.
Normally, I would have been able to handle your remarks and comments, but since your attitude has been a bit miffy, I was not as tolerant of your replies.
She scribbled it down on her paper and then turned her attention to us. She had a satisfied smirk on her face.
Maybe he could call them right now, his boss wouldn’t care, and it wasn’t like there were patients lining up to see him today. Was Sherlock’s phone even on? Was Rosie snapping pictures on it again by accident? He made one of those his lockscreen when Sherlock wasn’t looking. The picture showed Rosie’s wide eyes from the flash, and Sherlock moving to take the phone away. He was adorable.
I gave your hand a tug again, and that got you moving. You were facing the taxi now; you refused to look anywhere else, more specifically me. You looked like you were trying to stop thinking, to stop imagining all the possibilities, but you couldn’t. You just couldn’t switch it off. The cab ride was silent; the only talking that you and I did was in our heads. You gripped my hand for dear life. When we got to the hospital, and got you settled, you still didn’t let go of my hand. You were laying in the cot now, eyes fixated on me like you would never see me again if I left the room. I gave your cheek soft strokes and told you over and over again that you were going to be just fine, and that everything will be okay. The anesthesiologist came in and informed the both of us that you were going to be administered drugs now.  It wasn’t long before they took effect. You were getting sleepy, the grip on my hand was loosening, and your speech was becoming slurred.
I graced your neck with soft kisses and you did that purring noise that you always make whenever I grazed over your sensitive areas, your neck is long and graceful, Sherlock, I couldn’t help but spend my time drooling over it, over you.
"Holmes and I were discussing your whereabouts upstairs when Holmes remarked that he heard a noise, but I heard nothing. We thought that it was you lot returning from your outing but we were wrong, as you can see."
John never felt so much anger as he did in that moment. This angel was beginning to be the least of his problems at the moment.
We both shared a short laugh. You always had a way of doing that. Of making me smile no matter how much I didn’t want to.
“But it’s okay now, I have my John back, we’re…we’re happy, he makes me happy, and hopefully I do the same for him. This is what we both need now.”
Sherlock sat up and grabbed the two glasses filled half-way with wine. The bottle was nearly empty. Once they both had one, their arms entwined as they drank. Once their glasses held only one sip, John took them both and set them back down.
And quietly, without making eye contact with John, he said, "Because there's one behind you as well..."
The longer I waited up for you, the guiltier I felt. I shouldn’t have snapped at you like that, love, but I was tired of your attitude. I didn’t want you reverting back to your old ways, your old, lonely ways. In hindsight, you were probably delaying the end of the case because you knew I was mad at you and you wanted to give me time to cool off. That was thoughtful of you, thank you. You gave me time to piece together what I was going to say to you, actually. Yes, believe it or not, I wanted it to go a certain way. I would wait for you to get home, and then after some time, I would ask you, kindly, what your issue was and why you wouldn’t tell me. I was ready to give out physical comfort as well if you needed it. Sometimes, that was all you needed, Sherlock.
Figures you would get mad at me for asking if you were alright because you doubled over in pain in mid-chase. I was being irrational, right? Thankfully they were caught, and the other group as well. Lestrade looked on proudly as the people who have been evading their inevitable arrests were finally going to be locked up, and if I know him well enough, they were going to have a pretty hard time getting bail. You were supposed to be proud too, but you weren't, I thought it was because of me that you looked disappointed, that you didn't get to them first, I didn't want to ask. I watched you, Sherlock, I saw that you weren't even paying attention to the arrest. You were upset about what happened in the alleyway, I knew that much, but it wasn't because of me. It was because you were mad at yourself.
He found his article of interest and began reading, all the while peeking at Holmes to see if he came to yet. There were times where he found himself staring at Holmes and not being able to look away. It’s only when he saw Holmes’s eyes flicker that he would turn his gaze to the bolded letters printed on the newspaper and act like that is what he has been doing. He wondered what it was like having Sherlock for himself, to hold his hand, to give him the light kisses on his cheek or lips whenever he felt like it, to hold him close. Sherlock and John are probably doing the same thing downstairs, good for them. Sure he was a bit envious that they were able to do such things without the disapproval among their peers, or without the fear of their lives and freedom. How he longed for a society where everybody was accepted for who they were and who they wanted to love, but he won’t be around when it happens. At least somewhere out there, in the vast complexity of space and time, there was at least one version of them, one out of who knows how many, that got that chance.
‘I won’t be gone long, with the way the case is set up; I don’t think it’ll last for more than a few hours.’
“Kylie…uh, Kylie wrote this for you. She asked if I could take her with me today, to come down here. I told her that this was just between daddy and I. She’s, uh, she’s a good girl, Sherlock. She follows instructions well, she’s the star pupil of her class, and she’s just a beautiful thing really. She…she turned five a month ago. She’s just turned five and already learning how to read and write. She told me to give this letter to you and I…I’ll read it.”
“Mike introduced him to me; I just kind of passively greeted him and didn’t spend too much time on him. I think I just wanted him to leave more than anything, if he didn’t agree to be my flatmate of course, which I expected him to decline. He was at the flat; I took that as a good sign. But he complained about my mess when we got upstairs, but I didn’t hear a no. I thought that he was going to leave for sure after we solved that case together. It’s on John’s blog.”
"What's the matter? Turned into a statue too? We have to save Sherlock and Holmes; you don't understand how dangerous Moriarty is."
One day, John came home from work with a bouquet of flowers. Sherlock watched with tired eyes the way his lover was so gentle with the flowers, and how he walked over to Sherlock with a warm smile on his face.
“So, let me say this now. John Watson, I think you’re the most amazing, and bravest man that one could ever hope to meet and how lucky I am to have met you.”
When he went into the kitchen, he found Sherlock testing the milk. He saw John approach with her and handed him the bottle.
Sherlock rubbed at his eyes and nodded. John didn’t want him to blame himself. Sherlock never blamed him when he was like this, not even when they barely knew each other. He helped his love off the couch and walked him into the bedroom. Sherlock sunk to the bed while John took his time removing his work clothes. He climbed in the bed in nothing but a t-shirt and his underwear. He turned the light off and felt the familiar tickling of Sherlock’s curls under his nose, and his breath against his neck.
I told you that it was me, that I was there. You held your hand out, it was shaking a bit, I grabbed it and took a seat in the chair that was set next to your bed.
“I only want to hear you say three words, John.” John nearly wept himself at how small and shaky Sherlock’s voice was. He was beautiful when he cried.
John huffed and dropped the conversation. He couldn't ignore the feeling of Mycroft's eyes on him. The driver turned and as he drove down the street, the houses got bigger and fancier, this was the neighborhood that John knew he would never be able to live in. He wondered how many of the houses belonged to people who needed the rooms. If there's anything John learned being with Sherlock, is that you could have all the money in the world, but still be the loneliest man on the planet. He wondered how Mycroft did it, being alone for so long with nothing but money to keep him company.
Whatever John wanted to say to him was forgotten. He sat with his phone to his ear, listening to the monotonous baritone of his voice. Ruminating on the fact that Sherlock said he napped with Rosie. Sherlock never naps. At least, not when he’s happy.
I tried to tell you that you could talk to me, that you needn’t keep anything from me. But because you spent so long on your own and guarding yourself from the world around you, you decided to suffer in silence. I didn’t want that, Sherlock; you didn’t have to do that any longer. You didn’t answer me, instead you rubbed my wrist with the pad of your thumb and placed your soft lips on my own, it was only for a minute, a brief minute, but I always find myself aching for more.
“I’m so glad you think that divulging rather embarrassing stories about me is a good way to pass the time.”
Sherlock asked that with the tone of a youth who has just found their first true love. John continued.
'I want the towel, John...so I can get out.' Your eyes danced over to the towel again and I grabbed it and opened it up. I held your hand and supported you as you got up and then you wrapped the towel around your waist. I pulled the plug so that the water could drain and then helped you as you stepped over the edge of the tub to get out. It was then I noticed how thin you really were. Your wrist, it was sharp and that was all kinds of not good because that meant that I could feel your bone. You were always a skinny person, Sherlock, but that was the limit. I made a mental note to myself to make sure you ate when you woke up from your kip. But until then, I needed to get you to the bed. You sat yourself on the bed and then moved the covers so that you could lay down. I started to stroke your hair, but that didn't lift your spirits at all.
“Time to eat, love.” John’s smile made Sherlock dizzy. How could such a mouth show this much emotion?
It seemed like ages before John heard the shushing and hushes of the people in the crowd, and saw the remaining attendees standing up taking their seats. This was the moment he was waiting for, the moment they were all waiting for. Sherlock was coming. This was really happening. Trying his best to give the most arousing and excited stance and push away his worries and doubts, he stood up straight, like a soldier awaiting their captain’s orders. Though he was his own captain now, and his orders for Sherlock are his vows. The elderly woman took her spot at the organ and assumed the pose that she has no doubt had to sit in for years. She looked decrepit, and could keel over and die any minute. Hopefully, she could hang on, there’s no need to turn a wedding into a funeral, or a case, if Sherlock were to speak on the subject.
"Alright, alright, alright!" The Doctor shouted. He was just as scared and angry as John and Watson were. Watson was doing the best at concealing his emotion for the moment.
John’s breath hitched in his throat, and he could hear his heart pounding against his chest. To have Sherlock say that to him, him of all people! It was an honor that no army medal could compare.
John was glad for the large coat, it provided him sufficient cover to hide the growing blush on his cheeks. God he missed this.
Sherlock only graced him with yet another treasured smile, and resumed playing with the oblivious infant. John poured the tea into the mugs and whispered, “Please don’t take my sunshine away…”
The first time I've noticed it was when we came back to the flat. I brought Kylie with us this time. You stared at her during the session and you smiled to yourself as she laid on my chest and stared at the needle sticking out of your arm. As usual, I would set Kylie in her crib and then help you get ready for your afternoon kip. You fell asleep almost instantly, and that didn't rouse any suspicion in me. It was after the fact, when I was nearing sleep in my chair that I heard your moans coming from the room. Immediately my mind went back to the first time you shouted for me like that and in no time, I was up and in our room. You were hunched over the side of the bed throwing up. There was no food in it, it was just liquid and bile. The floor was ruined with your vomit, but that wasn't at the forefront of my mind. You were in pain and I needed to stop it. I was at your side on the bed and I rubbed your back as you dry heaved over the side. I couldn't find any bins near me and I didn't want you to be alone. I was resigned to clean up your sick. You moaned and you dry-heaved, and then you got sick again, and then you called me. I kissed your curls and I took your dressing gown off as you crawled over to the side of the bed. You were sweaty, and your curls were sticking to your forehead, and your skin was paler than I've ever seen. Your eyes were red-rimmed, your mouth was stained with the vomit. You looked so awful, Sherlock. My Sherlock...
'Oh, I'm sure he'll see to that. He wouldn't be my John if he didn't confine me to our bed.' You joked. I've always loved hearing you call me your John because I was your John, and it'll always remain that way. The doctor smiled at the both of us. I think he was proud of our relationship, I don't know.
People like Sherlock, the geniuses that’ve been outcasted, exploited, ignored. Used until he’s no longer useful and then treated as if he’s less than a human. He kissed him again, his screams have stopped and now he’s only crying softly onto his chest, his hands clutching at John as if he too were a figment of his imagination only created to torture him.
Speaking of, I think I hear him back from the shops, I should go help them now. I actually missed him while he was out! Maybe I'll get back to this, or maybe not.
“Mine is weak, John won’t let me have a full-fledged chemistry set, but that doesn’t stop me from keeping a few tubes and beakers around, for cases, that is.”
“The day I went back to work. I wanted it to be a surprise for you and that being said, I needed a proper excuse with you deducing me and finding out my true intentions.”
I kissed you, and then I left you to get dressed. I spent a good hour or so sitting in my armchair. It wasn’t as comfortable as I always thought it was. Nothing was comfortable anymore.
He said something sarcastic; I’ve learned that it runs in the family. I forget what he said because it was in one ear and out the other, but it was something like, ‘Good evening, John.’  Pardon my awful attempt at his voice. I asked him what wanted and told him that it wasn’t the time for his game of hide-and-seek. I stood up and looked around to see if he had some his agents there waiting to kidnap me. He wasn’t going to take me that easily, I was going to put up a fight that time, a real one. I wasn’t going to let him drag me away while you were still being operated on, and he probably knew about the procedure too.
“As I was saying,” Moriarty interrupted, “The door swung open to reveal things that I could never hope to think of in my mind. So much technology, things that are not even close to being thought of here! I’m sure you hear this a lot, Doctor, but it is bigger on the inside.”
“Would you like some tea? I bought some whilst grocery shopping and I’m eager to find out what it tastes like.”
You told me to sit with you on the bed, and I obliged. You held the both of my hands and for a long time, we just stared into each other’s eyes. I let out a tired and defeated smile, and you returned it.
The morning after, the living room was oddly quiet. The television was playing Rosie’s favorite show, she was sat in front of her tower of blocks and watched with wide, curious eyes. Sherlock was huddled on the sofa, his face lacked the usual horror when watching the Teletubbies. John frowned. He was staring at his love while tucking his shirt in. Sherlock’s face was somber, the corners of his mouth sagged, his eyes looked heavy and colored with the dark rings underneath. He hated to see Sherlock so defeated, so tired.
I gently rose out of the armchair, with Kylie safely nestled against my chest, and treaded on light feet over to the table, at this point, you were asleep, Sherlock, or at least, you wanted me to think you were asleep. Maybe you were acting like that because that was the only way you could tell me that there was something wrong with you and that you wanted me to help. I don’t know, maybe I was reading too much into it, but you could be a cryptic one at times.
‘I’m going to give you back to papa now, you’ll forgive me Kylie, but holding you isn’t bringing me the happiness that I thought it would. In fact, it’s making me feel quite the opposite.’
John’s heart sank. Oh no, what did she do? Did she knock over a whole shelf of cereal boxes? Did she break all the baby food jars? Did she get him banned from yet another store with her infant antics? What did she do? Rosie laughed and kept playing. “Well, I’m glad you find this so humorous.”
“Give her tummy a little massage, and feed her some mashed prunes or something. But be patient, love, don’t need her exploding.”
‘I know what that means, John. We’re not getting any younger, and I remember you telling me that you always wanted children. With both of us being the same sex, we won’t be able to conceive one together, so I thought that you would consider---‘
"I seem rather silly, don't I? Talking to myself, to you, if you're even really there." He had a hint of anger in his voice, but after the next sip, he started to calm down. His tone grew softer as he spoke.
Sherlock crossed his arms. “So, are we going to pretend this didn’t happen? That I didn’t scream the whole house awake?”
It was at that moment that Sherlock held John’s face and came all over his stomach, in hot, white spurts of semen. John let out a scream as he emptied himself inside of Sherlock’s body, feeling the come seep out of Sherlock and back onto his wet penis. The two men sat like that, riding the waves of their unified climax together, nose to nose, mouth to mouth, smiling, drunk with arousal. Here and there they pressed kisses onto the other’s lips, and whispered more sweet nothings.
“If you think that was something to see, then you should come to the reception, drunk and overly-excited people are the best source of entertainment at social functions such as this.”
Sherlock's voice. It was Sherlock's voice talking to him. He brought his trembling hand up to his forehead. Not now, he thought, don't do this to me now.
"But Holmes, why are you so happy about this? Doesn't this go against every logical thing in which you stand for?"
He looked like he lost his nerve, so he turned to walk away. I couldn’t just leave it at that, I think that’s the most sentimental that Sherlock’s ever been with somebody, and we’ve only lived together for a few months, by Sherlockian standards I am still pretty much a stranger.
Sherlock's gaping mouth soon curled into a smile and he rushed past John and out into the living room. John followed suit and found his husband-to-be throwing on his coat haphazardly, and carelessly draping his scarf around his throat. He was shimmering in excitement and has yet to tell John anything.
That was the voice that told John "You cannot dodge this no matter how hard you try." He took a deep breath and then another swig and set the cup down on the table next to his chair. After a beat, he said, "I still have the gun."
"Yes! If this gentleman next to us is correct and not some random loon who should be thrown into the local asylum, you are a version of my dear friend Dr. Watson from another, parallel reality of our own, right?"
‘So what does this mean, Sherlock?’ The doctor in me knew, but did I want to believe it? No, absolutely not.
Maybe he should respond to the comments. There are only five, and he doesn't have to reply in paragraphs. No, no, he knows that he won't do it. It'll be like a chore to him; he won't get around to doing it until he feels that it's absolutely necessary.
And now he was back. The stairway looked better, brighter and newer than when he moved in all those years ago. They stopped in the hallway for a moment. Sherlock crouched down, examining the new wallpaper as if it had secrets etched into it. John leaned against the wall and watched Sherlock, admiring the view of his rather gorgeous backside, and thinking just what the hell was Sherlock staring at!
“Waiting for your surgery to finish was pure agony, Sherlock. Maybe it wasn’t as long as I thought it to be; maybe it was because I was worried about you. You weren’t supposed to eat or drink anything that day but even before that, you weren’t too keen on having the standard three meals a day. My hands were clenched together and my leg couldn’t stop shaking. People passed by me and gave me short stares before they went about their day. I didn’t care what they thought about me. I was beginning to see why doctors don’t care for their loved ones, it clouds the head and they get sentimental. I wished I was in there helping them operate, or holding your hand even though you were passed out from the meds. The sounds of the machines, the chattering of the patients, nurses, doctors, and the bright lights that illuminated the whole building were driving me up the wall, Sherlock. I felt like you when you were bored, but I wasn’t as extreme as you.
“But Doctor, you can easily go and have a quick glimpse at alien life a billion years from now, you can go and incite a war that never happened if you wished it, or you can go and have a nice shag with Robin Hood if you really wanted to,” Sherlock pointed out to The Doctor, “You don’t necessarily need us to do all of this.”
‘How was the case?’ I asked you, even though, some part of me deep down knew that the case was a lie. You were bored that day, Sherlock, but you weren’t that bored.
'Please, John. I need you to make love to me if I'm still your Sherlock, and if you still loved me and if you can still find me remotely attractive anymore...'
Sherlock grabbed John's hands and his smile disappeared briefly and was replaced with a softness that John rarely saw in Sherlock.
Holmes knew that he wasn't literally speaking to him, but he also knew that Sherlock could hear him. Maybe talking about John could help speed the process a bit.
‘How’re you feeling, Sherlock? You’re not looking too hot.’ I asked you. I was speaking lower than usual because I wanted to enjoy the quiet, it wasn’t every day we got to sit like this, with no distractions, no interruptions, never mind the fact that we were inside of a cab.
They settled in under the covers, and John closed his eyes letting the warmth from his bedmate lull him to sleep. It would have been the fastest he’s ever fallen asleep until he heard Sherlock’s small voice whisper, “John?”
Moriarty spun them around and then began walking the opposite way, leaving John shouting Sherlock's name as if that could change the blunder that they were in. Pretty soon, Sherlock, Holmes, and Moriarty were out of their view.
"He pretty much said exactly what I told you. If Sherlock does wake up with a headache, he'll give Sherlock some morphine to stop it but I'm hoping it doesn't come to that."
I peppered kisses all over your hair. I was so relieved to have you come home, to finally have you under my care. I was your doctor, you knew this.
He responded with a nod and watched as John marched out of the room. He picked up where John left off, he started rubbing Sherlock's back  and tried to place him in a more comfortable position.
It just struck John that Watson would have no clue about who James Bond was, or what a movie even is. He just shook his hand and waved it at Watson.
I shrug and then tell you that I would enjoy working there more. We would both laugh, and then continue with what we were doing. I felt good with where we were you know with the surgery being a success and Kylie joining the family. I had everyone where I wanted them to be.
You looked lost for a moment, but you snapped back into reality and slid your shoes on and grabbed your coat and scarf off of the rack. You turned to face me.
“Let’s get out of here, I think we’re more than clean.” He moved to shut the water off. Sherlock looked confused and stepped out with him. John took the towel and dried himself off and Sherlock too. Sherlock went to put his clothes on but John shook his head.
Sherlock’s cheeks tinged red and his hand settled back on his lap. It wasn’t easy to make him bashful, but John always found it lightened his mood to see Sherlock care enough to become shy.
Not hearing a response, Holmes rose out of his chair and slowly made his way over to the open door. He nearly fell over Watson’s body. He immediately bent down and began to check his friend frantically, finding the dart lodged in his neck.
And then the sound of his feet making contact with the old wooden stairs. Holmes rose from his chair with a heavy feeling in his chest, and stumbled into his room. He locked his door and then made his way to a loose floorboard behind the bed. Inside there was a box, a tiny black box. He sat on his bed Indian –style and opened it. There it was, his trusty friend. The small bottle of cocaine he had, as well as the syringe used to administer it into Holmes’s body. He filled the syringe carefully and waited until Watson’s steps halted to apply it to himself.
She took a seat at the table and opened up the banana resting in the nearly empty fruit bowl. John took a few more sips before continuing the conversation.
Ella never had many patients, mostly because they got better. John was one of the patients that couldn't get enough apparently. He was one of the "needier" ones. As long as he was giving her money, she wouldn't stop treating him. A part of him thinks that she feels bad for him, and she knows that he can't pay the real bill she gives out. John rolled his eyes. He should try looking for a job. Mycroft sends him money, but that's the only reason why he knows that the only Holmes brother is still alive. John can't believe he was considering giving him a call.
“This flat being destroyed means that everything we made together is destroyed! It won’t ever be the same again. I’ve loved you for so long and I’ve wanted you for so long and now that I have you, I’m terrified that it won’t matter once the flat’s fixed, because you won’t come back and I have
The man's head lifted up so that he was staring at the mantelpiece. How he could see in such darkness, they didn't know. His nose was sharp and long, it could cut you if he decided to turn fast enough. His hands were now folded behind his back, revealing his slight hump from years of slouching. It was hardly recognizable.
‘…Sherlock….Sherlock has cancer….Pancreatic cancer….’ I said it as quickly as my mouth allowed me to. At first I thought that maybe no one understood me because I said it too fast. No one reacted, or at least outwardly. You were curious too, love; I saw how you watched the three of them with those analytical eyes of yours. For a moment, everything was silent, even Kylie seemed to feel the tension in the room!
He tries to avoid eye contact with her, but he can see out the corner of his eye, she's giving him a look. She's judging him no doubt. He wants to tell her something, to say that she had no right to do that. He was being paranoid, quite possibly. She faced Kylie again and he saw her smile. He wanted to go home. He would say that he was sorry for being an arse and that he hopes that he can see her again. Nothing happens. He just sits there and allows his focus to blur as he forgets to blink. He can the little blob that is Kylie, but his eyes are watery now.
“You’re just hungry, aren’t you?” Her sniffle only confirmed it. He took her to the kitchen to look for the formula. When he found it, he set her down in her highchair to fix her bottle. Rosie didn’t find her new placement agreeable and screamed even louder than before. Sherlock sighed and put the bottle down to get her back in his arms. He kissed her head and tried to shush her before she woke John up. He thought he succeeded, but he heard John’s feet and him saying, “I’m here Rosie…I’m…Rosie?”
John told himself he wasn’t going to push Sherlock. He meant every word when he told Sherlock to set the pace. He was glad that Sherlock understood.
“Well the oil is not going to work for a few hours, and she seems calm now. I can try to get a bit of the shopping done if you would like. But still, order takeaway tonight.”
‘Well I don’t know how else to tell you this, but…’ He trailed off. I felt my body becoming heavy, everything was going slower. Being a doctor and having to deliver the same news to other people myself, but for your sake, I was holding out, I was trying to think on the positive side for once, just this once.
‘What’s the matter? You haven’t been like yourself lately.’ I would tell you every time you looked particularly dazed. You would respond to my touch, that was good, but you would never give me a clear answer. Your hand would lie on my wrist and you would give me a small smile to reassure me.
‘Don’t you think I’ve tried? Talking to Sherlock Holmes is like talking to a wall at times.’ Is what I said to her.
John can’t remember the last time he had been so happy to just stay in his home with Rosie. He was resting his back on the arm of the sofa watching Sherlock play peekaboo with Rosie on the floor. She was just as infatuated with him as he was. Sherlock was simply that wonderful. Did he know this? Sure, he had his moments of being particularly nasty, but so does everybody. But that’s because everyone else made him feel like that it was the only way to live. Sherlock didn’t allow himself to be this soft with anybody besides himself and Mrs. Hudson, sometimes.
“Since you walked into the living area, naturally. I am not blind, Watson. Even when lost into the folds of my mind, my ability of sight still remains.”
“And Watson hasn’t confiscated it yet? John took mine, he and Mrs. Hudson agreed that it isn’t “safe” and it could contaminate the food around it as well. I beg to differ, but you know they always have to be on the safe side.”
John thought about that for a moment and then gave a smile. That made his night, Sherlock knew. He set the cup down and sauntered past John.
I pretended that I wasn’t watching you mouse around in your drawer, and made my way to Kylie’s crib. I set her down gently, and the mobile shook a bit, causing you to close your drawer abruptly and spin around as if there was someone breaking into your house. At the sight of me, you relaxed, but the familiar look of tension was still in your eyes. What was it that you were so frightened of me seeing, I thought. I found myself a bit down that you would go so far as to hide something to this extent from me. I’m not saying that we were to be open with everything in our lives, but we should at least feel comfortable enough with the other knowing something.
"This may not be the best time, but you might want to cut back on acting like you're together," The Doctor said.
He specifically said to see "her" instead of "them". He doesn't know if he'll be able to face Mycroft, not until he stops seeing Sherlock in his older brother's face. She seemed satisfied and nodded.
You were in the room, I remember now because your hair was mussed up and your eyes were squinted and you looked perfectly human, Sherlock. You looked around and saw them sitting there, Molly bouncing Kylie gently on her knee, Mrs. Hudson’s eyes darting around the room looking for something to clean, and Greg looking exhausted as usual, but he tried to stay alert because he knew that something was wrong. I looked up at you and you were staring at them with such intensity. Molly flashed a glance at you and gave you her warm smile before focusing back on Kylie. You took a step back; you knew what was going on, because I warned you a few days back. I told you that they had to know now, before the surgery or before you get worse and you weren’t happy about it, but it had to be done.
Mrs. Hudson came to the flat this time, Kylie was still asleep and John didn't want to wake her so he phoned Mrs. Hudson, and under the condition that John pay for her cab, she came. John didn't pay for the taxi because he was using it himself. He told Mrs. Hudson to keep his whereabouts a secret from Kylie because he didn't want to worry her. Of course, his ex-landlady understood him completely and told him to go ahead. She kissed his cheek and gave him one of those smiles that she was so fond of during his stay at 221B. He could barely return the small one he gave.
The weeks flew by, and then turned into months, still no word from the agency. Even I was beginning to think that our hopes of becoming parents were starting to look slim, but I had to keep the morale high, or else you would start sulking around the house again. Just when I was starting to lose all faith in becoming a father, my phone rang. You were out on a case, so you weren’t around to hear the good news. They found somebody, a teen from the way she sounded, typical, a young woman who made the wrong choices and ended up the result of their misbehaving. I could relate because I was a rebellious teen, and I know for a fact that you were, Sherlock. The only thing that separated us from the poor girl was that we weren’t female, of course.
“John…” Sherlock bucked at the sensation and John felt his own erection jabbing him in the stomach. He smirked and released his nipples, as his hands trailed slowly down to around his waist. Without warning, he hitched Sherlock up onto his lap and moaned deeply into his lover’s chest when he felt Sherlock’s nails dig into his back. He gasped, “Oh, John!” and John removed his hands, this wasn’t planned, but they needed lube. Sherlock, in his pleasure-filled haze pointed towards his pocket.
Sherlock’s skin was pale, but he looked like a porcelain doll that was greatly cared for by the owner, even if there are a few flaws. Sherlock’s lips were taut, and his face was gaunt, making his cheekbones all the more apparent. Holmes was done with his facial features and moved on to his hands. Hands can tell a lot about a person.
“You’re a bad man, Sherlock.” John shook his head as he exited the clinic. They both waved to the receptionist and walked away. Sherlock wore a smug face.
"Yes Doctor, I am. And I'm going to give this to him and we're going to enjoy the morning alone, do you understand me?"
That unsettled everyone in the room. You shuffled around in your seat and Molly broke eye contact with Kylie to look at the both of us, even Mrs. Hudson looked like she was paying attention. I heard you breathe out my name and I felt a small part of me die when I heard it. You didn’t want to be reminded of it, but as long as your illness existed, so did the problems.
“I know John, I love you too, from the moment you introduced yourself at Bart’s I knew. Thank you for finding me worth your time, and for loving me.”
"Tired..." Came the slurred response. John really wished that they were back in their time. The time of cars and proper hospitals.
The crowd found this exciting and humorous, their laughter carried on a few moments after Greg was done with his joke. When they quieted down, Lestrade took a swig of his ale that he asked for specially.
From Young Sherlock's facial expression, he knew that he was right. But he didn't need to see his face, he already knew because he lived it.
My sentence died off there. I knew the stakes. Cancer is not a friend to anyone. I knew what came with cancer, but I could not bring myself to say it, not to your face, not out loud. Hell, I can barely say it now. I could feel your eyes on me, Sherlock. I couldn't stop there and then walk out of the room in mid-rant, I had to say something, I had to make you see that that was the right choice.
"I am conflicted you see; it brings me pride, along with a sense of smugness, whenever I hear that someone takes interest in my work and considers coming to me when they are out of their depth, but it also irritates me. Watson has the bad habit of romanticizing my cases, as well as my actions. How he loves his embellishments."
Our conversation should have ended there. But not that night, I wrapped my arms around your waist and shuffled closer, pressing my nose into your boney back. You didn’t try to move away, which is how I knew you wanted this.
He was being pushed out of the room. He caught one last glance at Mycroft, who was now holding Kylie's hand and staring at John with a hidden sadness in his eyes. This couldn't be happening, he was asleep, surely, he was still sleeping off the alcohol. While he screamed her name, all he could do was tell himself to wake up in his head.
"Well I'm here to celebrate the day of your birth, Sherlock. And because it's your birthday, I'm going to allow you one location of your choice on the TARDIS!"
John rubbed the back of his neck. He wanted to tell him, that they were getting married soon, but how would he react to that? Did John even want to know? He decided to keep that to himself, just until he found a better way to tell him.
Dear god above, what a perfect thing it was. Plump, firm, it made John salivate just thinking about it. He wanted to do more with Sherlock last night, but the poor man had never had sex before and he didn’t want to scare him from the act altogether. That was the thing with Sherlock, you couldn’t rush things, it all had to be slow, it had to progress in stages.
“Yeah, I forgot why I was sitting in the park, but I did and it was hard to get comfortable because of my limp…you know.”
‘We can try to remove the cancer cells since it isn’t too serious yet,’ the doctor droned. I never did get his name, and I didn’t want it. ‘However, that would require surgery, if you are willing to do it, that is.’
John looked over at Molly, who wasn't even looking at him anymore. He could see her eyes following Kylie around, she probably forgot that they were sitting there, watching her. Molly uttered a short laugh, John could see the tears in her eyes. He didn't want her to cry, not right now. When you're trying not to break down yourself, watching somebody else cry doesn't help your case. He thought that maybe he should comfort her, be the good person. He can't even will himself to move a limb.
“That’s right, Geoff, George, Graham, I even remember one time where Sherlock literally typed in Giraffe on the nametags for the seats.”
Mrs. Hudson's eyes flickered up to John's face. He wasn't in the mood for talking, he hardly was anymore. He looked distracted even. She stopped her retell of dinner time and changed the subject. "Well now, have you got everything, Kylie?"
Your smile faded at the question. You looked like you didn’t want to answer it, but because I asked, you had to.
John turned the faucet off and then dried his hands. He walked over to the hallway and looked down to see if Kylie was behaving herself. He laughed as he heard her little groans of impatience.
"He'll make you laugh and smile on days you feel like giving up and crying, he'll compliment you when everyone else insults you and makes you feel awful about yourself. He'll listen when you're being ignored. He'll love you, when no one else will."
The only thing close to sounding like an objection was Mrs. Hudson’s muffled sobs at the sight of her “boys” finally getting married. Mycroft’s lip trembled, and Harry gave a defeated sigh at the comment. Not hearing anybody’s disagreement to their marriage, the vicar continued on.
He shuddered as each wave of his climax hit him. He was so new to this, it warmed John’s heart. John kissed Sherlock as he came, there were tears running down the man’s face. “You did so well, I’m so proud of you. I love you.” He whispered as Sherlock’s moans turned into whimpers. They both fell back on the bed, Sherlock got up to clean himself and John’s hand off. Once they were clean and dry, they cuddled.
He looked down and saw Sherlock’s long fingers wrapped delicately around his smaller hand. Sherlock was lying on his side, Rosie in between the two men, babbling away with Sherlock occasionally responding.
He stopped and then took his seat again, he didn't care if Sherlock was listening to him at this point. He had enough liquor in his system to talk about things he normally wouldn't, even if it was aloud to himself. He took a sip and then pressed the rim of the glass to his lips. It was cold, and it was uncomfortable, but John kept it there.
‘Mister Holmes, I’m sure you know the reason for me calling you back here.’ The doctor said with a raised eyebrow. He expected you to know the answer.
"Sherlock is more important, John, focus on him, I promise, I'll tell you tomorrow morning, that is, if you don't find out first."
“That’s too bad. Now that I think about it, this doesn’t sound like much of an alternate universe if we’re exactly alike, minus the physical differences and time period. Your Holmes’s hair is very…”
Sherlock had to ask him to move back. Perhaps Mrs. Hudson was right and he missed it just as much as Sherlock did.
John stared at him for a long time before he actually did anything. He didn't want to fight, he wanted to kiss him. He didn't want to do this. He wants Sherlock back. He doesn't want Sherlock to leave, but he doesn't want to hear anybody tell him how to cope. What did they know? Molly wasn't married, and Greg and his wife weren't happy. He wasn't even going to mention Mrs. Hudson's marriage.
I got you upset, but that wasn’t my intention.  But you let out a huff and then ran a hand through your fine curls that I have spent many nights tangling my fingers in.
The Doctor gave a smug smile and tossed his sonic in the air as he caught it before it hit the ground.
John smiles, but it's a smile filled with bitter pain. Greg stops smiling and awkwardly takes another sip of his drink. Almost gone now. John looks over at the bartender and raises his empty glass. The bartender gives a wry smile.
John grinned and pecked his cheek. “I wanted to have a proper date with you. I feel badly that our closest time to a date was when we watched movies together.”
Sherlock was sniffling heavily, John thought he was bordering the edge of an anxiety attack. He lifted the covers off himself and whimpered, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to wake her, John…”
So Janine sold him the cottage she lived in? She used the money she made from the media to buy it then. John remembered reading it, he remembered being very upset and even a bit jealous. Sherlock told him all those years ago that he wasn’t into women; he should’ve known those tabloids weren’t true. It took him some weeks to get over those bold letters; he even stopped reading the paper for a few days. But John couldn’t believe it, Sherlock was gone. But he could still get to him. He had to.
“Alright, Holmes, was it? You’ve piqued my curiosity now. Tell me, what else do we share? Besides landladies and scientific inquiries, that is.”
“Holmes, I understand that you hold yourself above feelings unlike every other human, but nothing stirred inside of you when you were given the good news?”
He flew to his dresser and pulled out his post-it notes, with his brand new Sharpie. He pulled the cap off and begun to scribble furiously on the small yellow paper.
"...And then you broke down again about a week later. This time it was when you were in the bath. You could move by yourself, Sherlock, but you would eventually need somebody to help you around the house and that somebody was me. You needed a bath, you didn't bathe for several days, and I wanted you to take care of yourself or else you would get worse, but you weren't having any of it. I helped you off the bed and let you support yourself on me as we walked to the bathroom. I told you that I prepared your bath already and you shrugged. When we got to the bathroom, I let you stand as I started to take off your clothes. You batted me away with your hand.
Sherlock’s brows furrowed, “But I liked the movie nights, not to mention that recently they almost always end with us having…”
'You understand that if we’re going to be bringing a baby into this flat, you are going to either stop experimenting, or find somewhere else to do it that isn’t here.'
Sherlock stayed silent, his smugness gone. John had laughter in his voice as he continued, “Sherlock you, forgot about her having castor oil and she shat all over the place in the shop, didn’t she?”
There was dead silence again. I felt your lips press against my scar, as I went shirtless that night, and then you moved to my lips. I thought we were going to shag, but you pulled away and then rolled over to turn off the light.
John felt a jolt of electricity course through him as he felt Sherlock’s soft hand clasp his own. The soft rumbling of his laugh excited him and caused him to laugh too.
"It's alright, Sherlock. I think Kylie is smart enough to know that he isn't real, and neither is Lady or Tramp."
“Yeah but I have a later shift, it’s my payment for staying home again. Why, do you want me to stay home again? I can call and have my hours switched back to my old ones. It’s only for a day, at least.”
“Mrs. Hudson!” Sherlock cut off, “It’s early and you’ve no doubt had a late night, why don’t you go back to Baker Street, we’ll pay for your cab.”
“I’m going to have a shower, Sherlock.” He spoke lowly so he wouldn’t wake the baby. Sherlock watched as he disappeared into their room before going to Rosie’s to set her down. The shower already started, and Sherlock was quick to grab a change of clothes and walk into the bathroom. John sighed loudly, he must have just stepped in. Sherlock shed his clothes, he was meaning to do that after Rosie threw up on him. He looked down at himself, stark naked. He took a deep breath and stepped into the shower. John turned around, hair already lathered with shampoo, body soaking wet.
Sherlock sighs softly and paws at his face. John looks at his own body. He was naked, but his sheet covered his lower regions. He looked up at the ceiling and smiled. He had never felt that intimate with anyone, sorry Mary. That was more than sex, it was more than lust. They made love last night. It was wonderful and everything John thought it would be. Sherlock’s moans, his whimpers, the way his face looked when he finally came. It was too beautiful for words. John looked back over at the brunet, and rested a hand on his back. His skin was so soft, he worried that if he held him too tight he would bruise. And that
"You didn't look like you were in a good way, and then I saw your clothes, so I know that you really aren't in a good way. What's wrong?"
I couldn’t tell you how…how unsettling this was. You were so hell-bent on thinking that the surgery wasn’t going to work.
What came after their bath was a hazy recollection of kisses that tasted like wine, interrupted by the giggles that escaped the tipsy men. Then it gave way to clothes being shed, limbs being tangled, and John telling himself that he never wanted to be without Sherlock again as he listened to his love’s moans and watched his face flush from pure ecstasy as he rode him slowly, gently, and told him how beautiful he was as they both came together.
“Because, we’re getting married soon, or in the future, or in another universe, whatever, and we want to enjoy domesticity, John does more than me, but that’s beside the point. I’m sure you know that after a wedding ceremony comes the sex holiday, er, I mean honeymoon, yes?”
Sherlock looked like he had more questions, but he relented at the sight of John’s pleading face, reminding him so much of a puppy. He smiled softly and nodded.
John, on the other hand, walked hand in hand with Kylie and listened to her as she told him about school.
It seemed like hours before Holmes said anything. Watson looked at the clock and saw that it was only eight o’ five. So he’s been like this for a good hour and some minutes. Watson was done with the paper at this point, he was only reading it over again because he didn’t want Holmes to think that he was watching him the whole time, which admittedly, he was doing. Watson reached for his tea again which was cold, but there was only a sip left in it, the same can’t be said for Holmes’s cup. When he was done mentally scolding the full cup, he heard Holmes’s deep voice say, “Good morning to you too, Watson.”
“It appears that I have grown quite…. accustomed to your presence in the flat and I would find it suitable if you were to stay.” He said that bit quietly and I couldn’t help but smile in his face. He started to twiddle his thumbs, and didn’t look me in the eye as he started talking.
Sherlock smiled and rose off his bed and sat with John on his. He wrapped his arms around John’s neck.
Everybody forgot their anger once I said that. They all shot looks at each other, and Mrs. Hudson muttered ‘Oh dear’ underneath her breath. Molly started to toy with Kylie’s clothes, fixing her shirt or her hair, minor things like that. Greg was facing down, it was like he couldn’t bear to look me in the eye after what I said. I told you Sherlock, they were going to be heartbroken either way.
"Pardon me, I apologize for running into your friend but you see I am in quite the rush to escape from my pursuer and my surroundings are the least of my concern."
He hasn't seen Greg in some time. Does Greg even know what Kylie looks like now? He barely saw her when she was a baby because, well, John didn't have the luxury of parading his baby around like new parents usually do because he was tending to his terminally ill husband around the clock. Molly hasn't seen her since the funeral. She would fawn all over Kylie as soon as she laid eyes on her. Maybe it wasn't for John to decide. With a sigh, he turned towards his room and called Kylie's name. In no time, she came running out of the room and right into her papa's arms. He smiled and kissed her head, and then her cheek. God he loved her so much.
I had to take you to hospital. If I wanted you alive and with me, I needed to take you there so that you could get the proper care and treatment, the chemo alone wasn't doing enough for you. You protested so much, Sherlock, you shouted at me and told me that you would rather die than go back to hospital. I knew that you were lying, you were trying to dissuade me from taking you and you used every trick in the book. I think that you forgot that I knew you, and I knew when you were scared but deflected it with anger. I didn't stop your shouting, I didn't think about Kylie being frightened by your volume, I let you scream until your voice went hoarse.
He stood up and put his hands in his gown. His shoulders were sagged, and my ruffling of his hair made him look like a petulant child.
But it was when you thought no one was watching, Sherlock. You would go to our room and if Kylie was in there, you’d stare into the crib and give her a smile. Not the fake smiles you were so prone to giving, but an actual, genuine, affectionate smile. This puzzled me, love, because you would never move to actually make contact with her, you loved her, but it was distant love. I provided the hugs and coddles for the both of us, nevermind Mrs. Hudson’s constant cooing.
John got up to fix their cups and Sherlock was left to think about John calling him that word so many times in one day.
"My full name is John Watson, but you can call me Watson, Dr. Watson if you want to keep it formal."
Mrs. Hudson placed a hand atop Kylie's head and gave it a few strokes. "I wasn't sure how late you were going to be, so I made her dinner already. I had a bit of Sheperd's Pie left from the day before, and she complained about being hungry so I figured why not?"
Moriarty turned away from the fire and started walking over to them. His face was haggard and cruel. His mouth had deep lines engraved on the sides. He frowns a lot. His smile was teasing the two as he held a hand to cup his ear.
"Papa!" She screamed as she threw her arms around his legs. He smiled and ran his fingers through her hair.
‘Nothing’s wrong, John.’ You told me. I’m sorry, Sherlock, but I had reason to be skeptical. You had so much going on.
“We don’t have that long anyway! I’m coming up on sixty and you’re sixty-five, even if we went through with this, it wouldn’t work out. Believe me there is nothing I want more than to spend the rest of my life with you, but how much of our life is left?”
They didn’t know how long they were in the tub, Rosie, exhausted from her time in the park with Sherlock, didn’t cry, signaling their time bathing. Every so often, John would stop washing Sherlock’s hair, and would kiss him and tell him how beautiful he was. He will never get over how gorgeous Sherlock looked when he blushed.
“…All of our friends were in our flat that day. Greg, Molly, Mrs. Hudson, all of them. All sat on the couch, with Molly and Mrs. Hudson taking turns with Kylie. Mycroft, he didn’t show up until later, remember? All cold and mysterious, but when he found about your cancer, I saw the tenderness in his eyes. He cares for you, Sherlock, and I know you cared about him but you two were never good with affection, and there’s a lot of bad blood as well. I shouldn’t speak about your relationship, hell; it’s probably healthier than mine and Harry’s, albeit it’s not the conventional sibling love. I wonder what Mycroft is up to now, he didn’t handle the news so well, and I haven’t seen him since…
John let out a defeated sigh. It felt like an eternity before he said anything else. He hated himself for even asking Mycroft out of all people but he had no one else.
He shook his head and made his way to Sherlock’s room, prepping himself for the sight and the reaction from his boyfriend. He paused in front of the smaller stairway, and had the brief urge to go up to his room and see what became of it. The glow of Sherlock’s phone screen interrupted any coming action.
'You have made your point clear, John. I need to go the hospital, this I can not evade anymore. However, I can stop anybody that I don't want coming to see me, and I will. I do not anybody else, save for you, to see me as I deteriorate in the hospital bed. Let me have this much, at least.'
“…I remember the morning after the appointment; I woke up and found you staring at me. Your eyes were honed in right on mine. To some people, it would have been awkward, but for me, you know I loved every bit of it. I have to admit, it’s not something I expected to wake up to, but it was pleasant. I whispered a good morning to you, and you gave me something resembling a smile. I accepted it; it wasn’t like I could see it when your face was half-buried in the pillow now could I? I waited for you to say something, maybe reply to me, but you didn’t even move to speak. I left you alone, you probably weren’t in the mood to talk, and I didn’t blame you.
They both whipped their right hand around to find that they were both pointing a revolver at each other. They tried to hide their face from Moriarty but they both saw the look in each others’ eyes. . Their fingers were being forced by an unknown power to the triggers, no matter how much they fought it. It was inevitable.
“I’m terribly sorry, your obsession is misplaced, go and seek out another genius for your sadistic sport.”
All Holmes could really remember from Watson’s lecture was that fruit flies started taking an interest to the fruit, and that Watson almost ate one, something like that. But even though Watson was angry at him and damn near spitting hot coals, he still retained that special air of dignity and refinement that was more known in nobles and people among the wealthier bunch, which Watson was not, despite him being a doctor. Holmes couldn’t help but drown out his rage-filled speech, to admire him further. He just stepped out of the bath, so the heat from the water, as well as the scented soap still lingered on him. He smelled of Cedar and Sage, it wafted off of him and travelled directly to Holmes’s keen nostrils and invaded them. He still had a bit of stubble from when he shaved, the faint fragrance of aftershave mixed in with his soap. His eyes were burning, very likely with anger, but he wasn’t mad at Holmes, just at the experiment. Watson was still in his bathrobe that was opened slightly as he fussed around, giving a peek at his slightly curled chest hair. His hair was still wet, as he washed his hair no doubt. Holmes was lost as he noticed every minor detail on Watson’s body.
It was just like any other day on Baker Street. Mrs. Hudson was downstairs cleaning and baking all at the same time, you were lounging around the house drowning in your own sea of boredom, as there were no cases for you to solve, not like Lestrade would have given you that many anyway. Kylie was priority then. I expected her, I had been expecting her for weeks, but she never showed up, she was either busy, or she managed to relapse. But this time was different; she was finally going to show up. No doubt you wondered why I was bouncing about the house like an eager puppy, or maybe you already knew and decided to let me have my moment. If that’s the case, then thank you, Sherlock. She walked into the flat, she looked different then I remembered. Older, sure, that’s what time does to people. She also looked cleaner, healthier, or maybe I wanted to think that she looked like that. She cut her hair, it used to be down to her back, but when she visited it was no further than her shoulders. She had bags under her eyes that the makeup couldn’t even conceal, and all in all, she looked so different. It made me sad, I think, to see her like that. Like a porcelain doll that was too valuable for anyone’s possession, cracked and chipped from the years it spent withering away from lack of love, and self-destruction.
Sherlock was rubbing Rosie’s back as he looked up at John with a puzzled expression. “I thought we were having a Bond night?”
John heard enough of Sherlock’s self-deprecation. He was an idiot, a complete idiot for letting this man think that he of all people became boring and unloved. “Sherlock.”
‘I understand completely and I’m very glad that you think that we would make suitable parents for your child.’ I told her with the straightest face I could muster. She blushed.
They fell asleep like that, embraced and inhaling the scent of the other. The last thing that John remembered thinking was that he didn’t want Sherlock to leave.
Wasn’t that what he wanted? He wanted to be with Sherlock, he wanted Kylie to be gone so that she could live a happier life. He wanted her back. No, he
John retrieved his coat and put it on shortly before getting pulled out of the flat and down the stairs into the street. John's hand was eventually released, but he watched as Sherlock's smile returned as he neared the mystery man in front of the blue box. Sherlock walked up to the Doctor and stopped. The Doctor smiled.
John laughed, “I guess she did. Now come on, let’s pick something for us to watch. Have you ever seen The Hobbit?”
“…You remember, don’t you? You remember our reactions when we heard the news? When the doctor walked into the room, with his face shoved in his clipboard and you and me, we just stared at each other and tried to reassure the other that everything was okay. That you were going to be fine. He started talking to us, but more so you since it was your appointment.
The Doctor didn’t want them to see that he was hurt at their rejection. Sure there have been others who’ve chosen the safe way out, unlike his other companions, and decided not to join him on his escapades. He was proud of them, in a way, they knew that while the tantalizing thought of time travel sat in their minds, they still found a way to fight it and live their pedestrian lives. Still, there was that dull aching in his chest at their words. They were trying to be nice about it, but what they were trying to say was, “We cannot stay with you Doctor, you are dangerous.”
“You’re my honeybunch sugarplum, pumpy-umpy-umpkin, you’re my sweetie pie. You’re my cuppycake gumdrop snoogums boogums you’re…”
'John!' I heard you shout again, you failed to see me standing in the doorway yet again because you were preoccupied with the towel. I walked over to you and grabbed your hands.
“I should have known that you weren’t of this era, not even the dirtiest rascal in Holmes’s irregulars has that much hair.”
“The next time I saw you with him, you were in that shock blanket, and you hated every minute of it. You tried describing the shooter to me, but then you stopped, and you looked over at that stranger I met earlier, and you two just stared at each other for a long time. Next thing I know you guys are walking away side by side chatting away as if you’ve been together for ages.”
He saw Sherlock's blush out the corner of his eye and smiled. As soon as they turned the corner, Sherlock was knocked down by man who was clearly running at a very fast pace.
Your odd behavior seemed to me a regular occurrence now, since it’s been going on for weeks now. I gave up in trying to get you to hold Kylie, no matter how much her bright blue eyes sparkled whenever she looked at you, I stopped asking you what the problem was, and I’m so sorry for that, Sherlock. I tried to move past it and act like everything was okay, because it bloody fucking wasn’t. You were in trouble, you needed help, and I just gave up on you. What a shitty, shitty husband I am.
“What more is there to say? He loves me, and I love him. I’m just glad that everything turned out the way it did. We’ve spent so long just trying to admit our feelings for each other. I’ve spent all my time denying that we felt for each other in that way, or that we were even a couple, but now, it’s the other way around, funny how that works. Of course, I always thought that he couldn’t feel things that way, since he always proclaimed himself a sociopath, I made the mistake in believing it.”
“You know, Sherlock. What you’ve said to me that day. About all the things you loved about me. At first, I thought you were taking the piss, or trying to make me feel like something I wasn’t. But I don’t know if you realize it, but, when you’re being sincere there’s this…this glint in your eyes and your face it softens and becomes what I now know as the real you.”
It was awkward, the initial conversation. There was so much to talk about, but not one of us knew how to get it out. We were standing there, staring at each other with all the emotions pooling at our eyes, but not wanting to actually show them because that wasn’t who we were.
"They also told us that it's not good to have a close bond with your patient, but I've broken that rule a long time ago."
The crowd made their coos and other noises that showed that their entertainment with their love. But now was the last and final part of the ceremony, the part that makes all of this worthwhile. They were going to put on the rings. Greg pulled them out of his pocket and handed them to the vicar, they didn’t have any children to be the ring bearer.
“John, I am not your patient,” Sherlock spat, “I know what you are to me, and I want you to treat me like the lover you claim me to be.”
Her eyes glanced back at you but then they returned to my own and her smile was warm. She extended her hand out and I gladly took it.
‘Where are you, exactly, Mycroft?’ I asked. He must have liked Batman when he was younger; he acts like him at times.
I held my breath as we entered the room. There Susanne was, she was absolutely exhausted, I wasn't sure if she was even awake. I wanted to take care of Susanne, that was the doctor in me, but the other part of me wanted to see my baby. Kylie Holmes-Watson. I heard the soft sounds of whimpering and immediately turned to face the source.
Sherlock didn’t seem to take a sip of his at all. He set his down next to him and then steepled his hands under his chin.
“Sherlock. You know, before I met you, I…I told myself every day that I didn’t like men. I only loved women because that’s who men were supposed to love. My father, the bastard, when he found out that Harry had a girlfriend, he all but disowned her. My mum…she tried to protect us, but my dad was a terrifying man when he drank. Whenever he hurt Harriet, spewed hate towards her, I was telling myself to never let him see that I liked men too. I like both men and women. For years…” John’s breath hitched as the tears pooled in his eyes, “For years, every time I saw a bloke I liked, I told myself that I wasn’t gay, that I didn’t like men and the...hatred I felt for myself was unbearable.
We joked, and we got a piece of what we once were, even for a short moment, we were like how we used to be and then as the moment sunk in we both realized how much we missed it, didn't we Sherlock? After that, we didn't talk, we didn't even look at each other. You closed your eyes and in time, I knew that you fell asleep. Good, you needed the rest. I needed it too. I slipped out of the bed and managed to make my way down the stairs to Mrs. Hudson's flat, to see our Kylie. She got so big, Sherlock. She grew so much, her eyes, so big and so blue, they were so perfect to me. She's so perfect, Sherlock. She smiled at the sight of me and I picked her up. I was always cautious whilst holding her, she was such a small and fragile thing, I think I was always afraid of breaking her somehow, like she was a doll. I felt guilty for leaving her like this, for teasing her the way I was. I would hold her, pass her off to Mrs. Hudson or Molly and then walk away to tend to you. Sometimes I found myself wondering if we could even raise Kylie at the moment if we made a mistake of adopting her, but then I look into her bright eyes and watch as her chubby cheeks spread as she smiles and then I know that I...that we made the right choice in keeping her. In loving her.
I don’t know if he told you that, Sherlock. But he did, he sat there with me for the next two hours waiting for your operation to be done. We didn’t say much to each other. Mycroft inquired about Kylie and I told him that she was doing fine. He nodded and made some comment about stopping off to see her one day, and you, if he had the time. The conversation ended there.
He almost gave away their relationship again. Maybe next time he won’t cover it up, Watson deserves to know. But for now, he wanted to hear Watson’s response to his answer.
"Should I...should I get a job? I know your uncle Mycroft gives us money but...I won't if you don't want me to."
“And the next thing I know, Holmes is sulking around the flat with a singed eyebrow! He still won’t tell me to this day, at most I get a ‘simply an experiment gone wrong, Watson.’”
