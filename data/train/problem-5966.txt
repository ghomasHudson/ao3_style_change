“I’ve realized I have to be thankful for the time I had with her, even if it was short, and even if I miss it now. Because I had it, and that has to be enough.” His sad smile grows wider, pulling at his cheeks in a way that looks a little painful, but there’s something so unbearably fond in his expression that Tony finds himself unable to look away. “I knew I couldn’t have her forever, given the very nature of our lifespans – but now, even the smaller moments are things I cherish deeply. Because I did love her, and if I don’t have good memories to keep me going forward with my battles, I would have nothing.”
How could he explain it to her? The mixed feelings he has about Tony? Something that is not quite friendship, but it’s also not rivalry, and it is not trust but it
It’s impulsive, the same way it was with Pepper years ago, when the urge simply boils over and his body acts faster than his brain could decide it’s a
“It’s the only way we can do this.” He says, brows furrowed, eyes apologetic; But his words stand firm.
Natasha leaves her seat at the back and comes to the panel with them, and as soon as she does, she sees the red flare of Wanda’s powers sparking over the buildings, the sounds of concrete crumbling and glass shattering – and the figures standing before their friends, the faces of the enemy, of the threat they don’t yet know, and soon will wish they
Now that the floodgates are open, let's hit Steve right where it hurts; and let's see what exactly does it take to turn this man from the person he was when he left that bunker, to the person he became when the war came around, once again knocking at his door, demanding to be let through.
I would like to invite you all to stay tuned for the next part of this series, which is the next big thing I am in desperate need for: A Post Infinity War fix-it. Yep, it's gonna be canon compliant. Yep, I know a way to fix that. So, if you trusted me on this one, trust me in the next one as well. If you think you saw how good I am at filling in the blanks in this fic, darling, you have no idea about what comes next. After that ending in IW, I have no mercy left inside me. Let Marvel try their hand at ignoring their plot holes and discardable devices - and I will give you the most realistic story that I can possibly produce, use whatever the hell I can get my hands on as a tool, and maybe, just maybe, fix
It’s— It’s a little hurtful, actually, even though Steve guesses that it’s partially true. It’s the implication that Natasha had thought they would get over their differences on their own and they had
It doesn’t surprise Jarvis that Tony doesn’t know who he is anymore – if Howard hadn’t planned to show Tony to Jarvis, there was no reason to input any data about him in Tony’s systems at all. He knows this. He understands.
Vision watches him put some distance between them, a look that can almost be described as uneasy on his face, when Wanda steps a little closer and puts her hand on his arm, leaning forward so she can whisper something right by his ear. Her voice is so low and so soft not even Steve can hear what she says, even with his enhanced hearing.
He works on it until he gets stumped. Then, he sets it aside for a while, and then starts with Cap’s.
“My most accurate translation suggests he was reading a section on the units that form what humans perceive as reality. The language is dated, which makes translation difficult, but I believe the accurate modern term would be
“It kinda looks like a date, Tony.” She says, referring to the stupid photos on the stupid article she says she saw this morning.
“Yeah. Alright.” Barton agrees, just as calm and determined, as if he’s made his peace with his choice. And what he chose was to
“Years, if you’re lucky.” Nebula says with no tact at all, all hard facts and steel will, her hands balling into fists, shaking in her lap. “And no. You shouldn’t.”
Natasha makes a thoughtful pause, and when she speaks, her voice is softer, kinder, almost a little embarrassed. None of her anger is there anymore. “Are you asking me as a teammate or as a friend?”
How could he not think the worst. How could he not. He had hoped so desperately, so quietly, every hour after the snap of Thanos’ fingers a burning pit of aching pleas and prayers dying inside his body even before they could reach his tongue, a naïve hope for the best that would lead nowhere; And shame seizing his heart in face of Rhodes’ immensurable grief, his visible and tangible agony over the unknown fate of his best friend, of his
“You know where the medical kit is?” Nebula asks, and as Tony gapes a little, U makes a chirp of agreement, high and excited, and Nebula nods at him. “Bring it to me.”
Natasha gives him a smirk, but it’s weak and demure, much more grief than amusement, but Steve will take it. She’s here. She wants to help. Steve would never push her away.
Because even when Tony has nothing else, he has his nightmares, he has his demons, he has the voice at the back of his head, the one who still sounds like
They try everything. Everything short of taking him outside and asking for help from an actual technician – because they can’t. Tony has to remain hidden. And as a consequence of that, when they finally run out of ideas, all they can do is wait, and pray for the best, because there is no one else they can turn to for help, outside their house.
“Deal.” Steve laughs as Natasha huffs, giving him a genuine smile, before picking up her knife again and going back to polishing it. Somehow, that makes him feel happy. It makes him feel normal. So it’s completely genuine and instinctual when he calls her one last time and says:
They are not good at this, at opening up. They have been taught how to fight back – never how to surrender.
When he hears Nebula approaching him again, he has calmed down enough that the sweat on his skin feels cold again, not infernally hot as it did before. He can feel the air reaching his lungs again, even if the smell is still stifling. He raises his head slowly, because it feels like it weighs a ton and he can’t move it right with his achy neck; And Nebula stares back at him with sad, mournful eyes, her whole face pinched in sorrow.
Natasha does, sometimes. Not always, and Steve has the incredibly distressing memories of their fights over these last few years to prove it, but she
In a split second, Rogers’ gaze steers away from Tony’s own, locking somewhere over his shoulder, and his brows do a complicated movement, raising and pinching low almost at the same time, giving him a constipated expression, sour and displeased. Tony turns, confused, and finds Carter and Ross approach in a haste, jogging towards the Jet, breathless and in disarray, and just like that, the moment is lost.
“He’s Captain America.” Tony shrugs, and leaves, and he pretends he can’t hear Clint screaming at his back,
“Alright.” Steve agrees, grateful, truly grateful, but needing this conversation to be over. He needs to think for a while.
Rogers stares at him, face neutral, his eyes giving nothing away beyond his needle-sharp focus, patiently waiting as Tony racks his brain for the words. Tony can’t find any. The snapping of seatbelts clicking together never ceases, menial background noise to a moment so tense that it shouldn’t even be able to hold in such a high-pressure situation like this – and they stand there for a moment suspended in time, a tentative moment where neither wants to be the one to break the silence and dare to cause damage their unexpected truce, and Tony feels fearful, cowardly, like he’s on the cusp of surrendering something that he shouldn’t, not to Rogers, not to anyone.
From the way Nebula immediately reaches for him, the jolt he thinks he gives is not only on his mind, but shakes his entire body, like a sharp shock bursting inside him. He almost asks her to repeat it, because
Maybe this is their common ground. Such a high cost to pay to finally reach it, a price that’s not worth it, a disaster so great that it drains away any elation he could have felt in this moment; A common ground achieved not by finally reaching a complete, unconditional agreement, but a defeat, a necessity of yielding in sake of survival, of finally,
In a small, quiet moment, when they all just stand there with stiff backs and closed fists, biting lips and clicking tongues, Tony has… He has a – It’s weird.
to see him getting closer, to know there’s someone Tony is deeply in sync with arriving to join them in the battlefield, so Tony will be able to feel a little less
Tony takes in a deep breath, steeling himself for this conversation, the intensity of their gazes striking him with the same heat the repulsors of the armor produce. “The Gauntlet took them away. Nothing says it couldn’t bring them back.”
the confusion too great to be kept at bay, even by the overwhelming feelings stirring inside his chest – because
After that outburst, Natasha paces around a little, taking in deep breaths to calm herself down, and Steve watches her walk a wobbly line to the edge of the rooftop with his heart heavy, wanting to follow her so they can be side by side again, but feeling himself nearly rooted in place, his entire body unwilling to move, marble and stone instead of flesh.
Even with Sam’s help, even after Bucky’s face had been recognized by some bystanders during their fight on the highway and his name was being mentioned all over the news, Steve spent almost two entire years without seeing Bucky anywhere.
She helps him wrap new bandages across his torso, once they have cleaned the blood and fixed a torn stitching. Nebula also checks his knees because of his fall, prodding at them gently, and the hiss Tony gives is sharp and pained despite her careful touch, the skin bruised and tender; But nothing seems broken or dislocated. Just sore, like all the rest of him. Just another bruise. Just another cut. Just another wound.
hang up, they don’t want to, but there is a rising of sound on Pepper’s side of the line and she sounds like someone is speaking close to her, trying to gather attention. Tony can hear the movement as Pepper pulls her phone away to give a reply to someone, something about
“Steve?” Natasha asks, immediately on high alert, her hand automatically dropping to her pocket where she has a small switchblade hidden.
“Why did you do it?” Natasha asks after long minutes of silence, both of them still staring at the city, for so long that all the lights are now blurring into one single image, one giant flash of brightness, that somehow still looks so dim from the top of this cold roof. “Why didn’t you tell him?”
Tony, like he’s seeing much more than Tony can imagine, and after a tense, breathless beat, Wong closes his eyes and gives a heavy nod, the gesture almost ritualistic with how sincere it is; a deep gratitude and transparent honesty echoing in the space between them with a force way too strong for such an innocent, placid movement.
“I just—” He shrugs, sinking his teeth in his lip just out of awkwardness. “Didn’t think I’d find anyone here.”
“That was fucked up, man. Really fucked up.” Sam comments in a breathy tone, trying not to make it sounds like an accusation. He doesn’t quite succeed, but it sounds unjudgmental enough. Enough not to make Steve completely shut himself off in his defensiveness. Enough to keep him still, even though he desperately feels the need to be alone.
Nebula checks his commands and the weird, jumbled map the screen presents them, and tells him it’s good enough for now and lets the ship be. The journey will take a while, she says.
“I hope he did, or else he’s gonna have a lot of explaining to do.” She mutters, gruff and annoyed, brows pinched in displeasure.
Tony had almost forgotten how it feels to slip into the role of the tenth man, to be the one who will disagree or hesitate almost instinctively to any decision made too-promptly, to be the devil’s advocate. Tony is the one who argues, he’s the one who can look at a situation from multiple angles and find any openings they might’ve missed, he’s the voice of contradiction—
Tony has to be ready to act alone, always. He has to be ready to throw himself onto the wire because no one will do it for him.
And suddenly, Tony has the vivid imagery of Nebula barking orders at an intimidated, cowering team of surgeons, all of them struggling to hold their scalpels and other tools with steady hands, fear making them quake under Nebula’s dark glare. It’s fucking
It looks… exactly like it was before. Her eyes scan the walls, the cabinets, the old love seat in the corner, the old mahogany desk Howard got as a gift from his grandfather so many years ago - and for a second, she kind of wonders if her husband has finally lost his mind. She was under the impression she would do it first, honestly, after the lost Anthony. The thought is a bit jarring, just until she slips back into that numb state that she can’t seem to shake off, physically shutting off all her emotions under a thick layer of
The thing about time is not so much that it heals the wound - is that it gives you time to treat it. It gives you the chance to look at it not as an ending, but as a possible new start. But you got to give the fog of pain a chance to clear - otherwise, it's not enough. You need time to let yourself learn from it. And there is no time here. That's what all comes down to. They have no time.
Sam freezes, looking like Natasha has just stricken him right across the face, and he turns to her horrified. “What?”
“What, you don’t think I know how it feels to lose someone on the field? I do, man, you know I do. It feels like
Wanda is making something in the kitchen when he decides to take a chance. He approaches silently, unwilling to disrupt this fragile, paper-thin peace they have settled between them in this silent apartment, knowing Wanda can see him stepping closer even though her head is tilted down while she chops onions on the cutting board.
They find the others in a tense, suffocating quiet, a strained stillness, shoulders hunched in defensiveness and aggression, the all too familiar stench of animosity clouding the room the same way the darkness swallows the world outside.
Tony had seen her drive a ship straight into Thanos’ head, to charge against him with electric batons and a raging scream, asking for her sister and bloodthirsty for revenge. Tony knows in his heart, in the very core of himself, that out of all of them, Nebula has been the one who has suffered by Thanos’ hands the longest – and she
“My readings also detect a massive decline in the total surface area of forests and vegetation. I am unable to calculate the percentage, but the visuals present evidence. I can form a projection to further clarify the results of the analysis.”
be there as soon as Tony called him back. He would come running. Steve wouldn’t hesitate in the least at the smallest chance of being welcomed back
Rhodey waits for a few seconds, it seems, but then, goes back to sighing, this time harsh and forceful, before he brings his head up and pushes out his chest, all traces of exhaustion successfully hidden in less than a few seconds, as he straightens his spine and assumes the posture he always does before duty, sharp professionalism honed to perfection after years of his service.
by himself, someone else must have given him the Scepter. Tony had always assumed he had taken it from the Chitauri. But if Thanos had been in control of the Chitauri this entire time,
She then proceeds to give a quick explanation about who Scott is and what has been the general opinion of the judgment panel over his case, which Steve would’ve liked to hear more about it, but the woman is tripping over her words and speaking in a rush, because a man – who Steve doesn’t recognize, but it is not Ross, because he stands behind the one who comes forward to the crowd and faces the first wave of cameras and microphones that are shoved into his face –, after a brief pause, announces, his voice hoarse and tired, but deep and imposing, bringing down the gavel that will seal Scott’s fate from now on.
“You were the one who wanted to talk.” Steve growls lowly, turning off the projection with an angry gesture. “I have nothing to say.”
Barton doesn’t argue, which is thankfully more civil than Tony would have hoped before, especially when it came to defending Wanda, but he does say, “You didn’t seem to mind fighting next to her when Thanos came. Or Ultron.”
Because she loves him. Loves him too much to make him quit. Loves him too much to be blind to who he is, to what he needs to do, and what it means to him.
“Honey, please.” He begs, his body pushing forward against Nebula’s hands, unconsciously, trying to reach closer so Pepper can feel him, even though it’s futile. “I still need to look for whoever is left. I can’t do that from anywhere else. I need FRIDAY to help me.”
“Like that was the craziest thing I’ve ever done in a fight.” Natasha raises one eyebrow at him, cockily, before stopping and shaking her head mournfully. “Trust is difficult for people like me, Steve. For people like us.”
, knocking each other over and screaming at the top of their lungs, and gunshots keep coming and coming, Tony doesn’t know where from, or where to, all he can see is the crowd panicking and moving and losing control, doing
“How much more important can it be?” Tony asks, not to be contrary, but feeling a little annoyed at the reminder of that absolute mess that was 2015 – Tony didn’t
His husband is big, but he is not threatening – he is… a source of protection. He is intimidating, but in an oddly transfixing way, as powerful men often are. Antonio’s fingers twist on the pelt beneath him, the thick, soft hairs pleasant and satisfying to grasp, the perfect brace as his breath escapes in a fleeting gasp at the rush of want that crashes in his body suddenly, by the sight of the Captain kneeling before him on the furs, coming closer, but he is not deterred – he removes his furs too, adding them to the pile where they lay, as eager to get undressed as his husband. Perhaps he shouldn’t. It’s desperate, unbecoming, even.
It felt… way too real. I wasn’t ready for that.” Clint exhales harshly, rubbing his forehead for a moment before turning back to Steve, a determined look in his eyes. “I don’t want to be an asshole, ok? I’m not trying to. I think she’s a good kid and I want to help her. But when that happened… Steve, I can’t pretend this isn’t some serious shit. I guess I didn’t know, or I was just… I didn’t think it was
But before he can get a single word out to inquire about it, a rustle of movement catches at the corner of his eye, from far away, over Bruce’s shoulder, and Tony turns his head instinctively, totally forgetting himself, the automatic response to stiffen up and prepare himself for an attack too raw and real for him to stop it, and everything that happens after that is just a blur.
When suddenly, a bright spark of red and orange snaps into existence right in front of Tony, scaring him into almost toppling over when he scrambles to get away from the table, his fight or flight instinct activating a visceral response and sending his heartbeat into skyrocketing speeds when the spark gets stronger and stronger, and it starts to move in a circular motion, big and wide, before Tony realizes what it
She wasn’t interested in him, not really. Steve knew. But he also knew he was hopeless at interacting with people, getting too attached or not at all, swinging in a continuous pendulum of two extremes that never let him settle down into a normal life.
And Pepper knows it. Peter never was to Pepper what he was to Tony, he knows, because they hardly knew each other. By the time the kid came around, Pepper had very efficiently removed herself from Tony’s Avenging business very much on purpose. Even if Pete was a nice kid – most of what Pepper knew of him came from Tony’s stories, nothing more. But she knew enough. More importantly, she knew
Someone makes an awkward sound, and then, it’s Rocket’s voice that says, “Not like we had time to prepare—”
him, but never let it sting, bringing him peace offering and comfort in the form of something as simple as this.
to know. He’s worried, because he… he held back, in Siberia, but he knows that even when he does, Steve is much stronger than the average man. For God’s sake, Steve once stopped a
He knows that Tony is staring over his shoulder. He hasn’t turned back, but he can see it in Tony’s face.
It takes a lot for Jarvis not rise to the bait. He swallows around nothing, trying to regain even a little bit of his composure back, and places a very careful mask in his face to disguise his suddenly overwhelming emotions.
But that line of thought lasts only for a moment. Looking closer, he sees that the corridor is not empty – there is a small area up there decorated with sofas and tables, like a small lounge, where he imagines people can sit and watch the sunset from inside the palace if they wish to. Right now, Sam is sitting in one of those chairs. He’s admiring the garden – probably because he can’t help it, because of how beautiful it is –, but every once in a while, his eyes flicker in Steve’s direction, and then wander around as if they’re trying to find something.
Tony will never be able to dream again. Never again, he knows. He will die like this, wide-awake, his nightmares following him around just like
“Okay. No responding to calls.” Barton affirms, crossing his arms in a thoughtful, if only slightly defensive stance. “Then what do we do when a call comes in?”
for Steve’s comfort at this moment. “Do you want me to come back later or are we talking about this now?”
Nebula lets him out of the hold of her arms, her expression sour and offended, borderline enraged, and growls at him, “You think I’m
Next chapter, we'll start to go deeper and deeper into MCU's inconsistencies and start picking them apart. The true beginning of the plot. As much as I love writing about characters' inner workings and relationships, this train has to leave the station eventually, right? There is so much plot to this fic, you don't even know. I'm very excited to show you what I have planned.
“Thor—” Bruce starts, but Thor doesn’t give him the chance to speak before interrupting, forcing his voice clearer and louder, pretending they can’t see the way his eyes glimmer with unshed tears.
“Sam—” Steve tries to answer but finds himself lacking all the words he could use to try and make this a little less awful. He has no words. He has no explanation.
He wants to give Natasha some space, so they both can think. They both can decide what to do. That’s why he’s almost never in the rooms anymore. For the sake of Natasha’s worries, he makes sure he remembers to eat, even if sometimes he east a bit too late. It is no amend at all, but it does quiet the anguish in Steve’s chest a little bit. Even if she might be angry, even if she hates him now – she worried before, and Steve knew why she was worried. So he eats.
, and they were just hiding there – and the regular law enforcement couldn’t have taken down that fortress like we did, not without massive casualties. But if Sokovia didn’t allow us to intervene, they would have to send hundreds of soldiers there to fight, and get hurt, when we could finish the whole thing in an hour.”
“The Mark L armor seems to have considerable resistance to the direct attack of the Infinity Stones, according to the footage, which includes it in the category of viable options, even if it’s base components are not artificially produced.”
He blasts a repulsor towards the ground in desperation, loud and sudden, the impact against the soil exploding rock and dirt in a shocking, sharp sound. The crowd reacts viciously, shouting in fear and surprise, and the turmoil aggravates even worse, as people shuffle and push around to run away from the blast, even though they’re still trapped on the other side of the fence, scared that Tony might aim his next shot at them.
Time to face the music, my friends. Because this is where we take all logic and throw it out the window, and we expose Steve's motivations for what they really are. I'm not going easy on him. I'm going to hit him where he's fragile because it's high time someone did it, and did it right, giving him no chance to escape by bringing to the game a overpowered villain or a convenient cliffhanger. No more. Cards on the table, Steve Rogers - Here is the transparency you so ardently wished for.
He’d gone downstairs to talk to her, after he left the workshop. He couldn’t have done anything else. He had a strong, nearly unstoppable urge of seeing her, of hearing her, not through the phone, so he’d know that she was okay, and she’d know he was okay. He had needed her to know he was still here for her, even if they had… separated, in a way. But not really. It was not really a separation – Tony didn’t want it to be. And he didn’t think she wanted it to be either. He needed to remind her, and himself, maybe, that they were still okay, as
Steve gulps, keeping his lips very carefully closed, so he won’t give away anything that might try and dare to slip out of his lips. He wonders if it makes any difference. He wonders if Wanda can see through him all the same.
“He was your best friend.” Shuri counters. “Are you the same person you were seventy years ago, Captain? Are you even the same person you were before you became a fugitive?”
, damn it, is that so hard to remember? – while it’s still attached to him. It makes him nervous, it

curling deep inside his belly. “I mean, we could fight, but it took us a very long time to actually talk. Do you remember? We’ve barely spoken before you joined SHIELD, after the New York attack. That was five months after the battle – and we were already putting our lives at each other’s hands.”
, the symbolism of it too raw and too underserved – he allows himself to feel it, to feel so grateful about something in the middle of such despair, even if for just a little while.
Steve cuts himself off right there. This is ridiculous. He shouldn’t be thinking about this. This is not about the Raft. This is about Bucky, about them, and it’s time he puts this behind him.
“You repaid the favor quite nicely, mister” Tony flirts back, before he can think twice about it, feeling inexplicably amused by the sudden turn in Steve’s behavior – awkward, but still flirty? That’s…
Pepper’s next move is to pull Tony forward, slowly this time, and impatiently push him in the direction of the sofas.
Arnim Zola behaved well, the files reported. Willing to cooperate, obliging, and – dare they say? – trustworthy. An amazing change for a man who once stood by the side of the infamous Red Skull.
“What is going to happen to him?” Wanda asks, her voice quiet and insecure, sitting so still she hasn’t even touched the food yet. “If they find him guilty? Will they put him back in the Raft?”
Like Thor said, seven PhDs. Tony may have some too, but he’s not arrogant about it – unless to those who deserve it. Bruce doesn’t. Bruce’s intelligence and straightforwardness are just refreshing and amazing to watch, and even though the subject is something that makes him uncomfortable—
“Not without alerting people who might be watching.” The man says begrudgingly, suddenly feeling enough at ease to pull up a chair to himself. Jarvis’ hand never leaves the gun. “And we don’t want to show them our hand just yet. We don’t have the resources we need.”
Tony waits, and waits, waits for what it feels like an eternity, bullets ricocheting off his armor as easy as anything, but he’s adrenaline is running so high that he’s panicking and he can’t stop it.
to reply – and that, he swears, is the only reason why he doesn’t completely quit when Thor, in a soft, almost too innocent voice, says:
Wormholes could – and if they bend Space so strongly, they also bend Time. Maybe enough to bend it backward, even.”
He has been gentle, he has been kind. They do not understand each other, not yet – they don’t speak each other’s languages, but the Captain’s voice is always low and unthreatening, and Antonio finds himself oddly transfixed when he talks. He did not scream, and he did not growl, as rumors he had heard so often in the South said; This man is no beast. Not in the sense he had been made to believe, at least.
Natasha interjects, her voice a little surer, but still wrapped around a sad, muted wave, rough around the edges, choking tears down with hard, inescapable facts. “We were able to gather food and bring people to shelter, but these are all temporary measures. There’s no use bringing them to shelters that have no light and no heating, and the world gets colder every day. The food will eventually run out, too.”
They’ll be fine. It’s not so bad outside that they can’t handle themselves. And they have to do it now, while it’s still not dark.
He won’t ask. He’s not sure if he can. The last time he’d seen her, they fought without pulling punches, and parted ways unsure where their relationship stood. He doesn’t know if she’s here as a friend, or a foe. “What are you doing here?”
“What sort of samples you’ll need, Doctor Banner?” Tony asks, a little more confidently, turning to Bruce with a renewed sense of hope for possibilities.
“Look, can we all just admit what no one wants to talk about?” He opens his arms, palms up, encompassing all of them in a gesture that doesn’t feel at all welcoming or solidary, only incredibly shameful. “This is not only about the Accords.”
“And what about the people who aren’t there?” Thor reminds him. “What about the people in planets all over the universe, who are dying as Earth is, and have no Avengers to protect them?”
“You were right.” Bruce frowns, tightly, his mouth twisted in ugly, mournful expression, defeat etched in his face – unaware of the storm that screams inside Tony’s chest. “It was his best chance against us.”
Tony feels a reassuring hand on his shoulder, and he’s surprised to see it’s Natasha, not Rhodey, when he looks over to see, and he forces out a tight smile at her to affirm that he’s okay, even though he can feel his hands start to tremble, the stress and the anxiety finally wearing him down.
“And how do you wanna do that?” Tony insists, raising his brows in a very exaggerated manner, oozing forcefulness. “If you don’t want to scare them off?”
“Come here.” She says and – and her arms are around him, gentle and warm, loving, protecting, and Tony doesn’t deserve it but he melts into the embrace anyway, he crumbles and falls, the shaky foundation of the walls around his heart tumbling down so fast they crash and burn inside, and he quakes, and shivers, and wails.
And ‘count on’ is a very, very frail concept, because what exactly does that mean, when they were the ones that so quickly turned their backs against him when he tried to show them they were doing something
Also related to Part 1, I should also let you know there is going to be a very long discussion about Wanda somewhere down this road. It is heavily influenced by AoU, after all. So if we have any Wanda stans in the house, I assure you now that my intention is not to make a open hunting season on Wanda, but you might be bothered by some parts of this discussion. Some of it is not gonna be flattering. This is me letting you know in advance, so don’t say I didn’t warn you.
“He hasn’t been staying here for a few weeks now.” She informs him, as she walks him outside, with two of the Dora following them a few meters behind, relaxed, but observing. “I though he would like some space for himself, so he’s staying in a village a few miles away. But no one else has permission to go there, so we sent the General to bring him here. You can wait by the garden if you’d like. He says he finds it relaxing.”
, because Tony absolutely does not intend to use any spells in any form to do what he has to do here. Thor might, but Tony for sure won’t. And if Wong tells him not to, Tony is pretty sure Thor won’t either. So
And it doesn’t get easier to hear it from someone else’s mouth other than his own thoughts. Good to know.
“Here.” Rogers says, immediately, taking a quick look around. “It has power, water, and it’s big enough to house a lot of people.”
gives them all the information he didn’t before, and their eyes light up in realization; Then, curiosity, but they both hold back their questions and wait for him to proceed. When he doesn’t, a second later, they decide to do it for him.
So Tony trusts her, and taps his chest twice, his fingers pushing the case into his chest, and he feels a little jolt of electricity as the markers beneath his skin activate in a cascade of transmissions, like his neurons, and from his chest, the nanites cover his body in a wave, following the lines of his frame, and – Tony isn’t
The armor envelops him quickly, but the fumbling with the belts slows him down. Thor pushes away his own belts and grabs onto Stormbreaker much quicker, following Rogers over the open gate and also dropping quickly to the garden below, without thinking twice, and it pisses Tony off even more how easy it is for the others to fall into Rogers pace so eagerly and thoughtlessly. The rest of them start to move too, some quickly, some not so quickly, stunned by the unexpected action, but they all finish gearing up and start preparing themselves to fall into position, as Tony finally manages to get himself free and runs towards the open exit, ready to jump.
it won’t mess with Time like that in small doses. If Thor is right, and there are passages they can access through smaller doses of energy and without the risk of opening a
Rogers nods, but he looks like he has just bitten a lemon. “Then our priority is to keep the crowd calm and try to make them cooperate.”
“Okay.” Tony exhales, touching the tabletop with his fingertips in a purely dramatic gesture, something of a flourish like would do in a presentation, a pose that reminds him in his muscles of his performance on board meetings and public presentations for the press. “Back to business. There’s one thing we didn’t do that I think we should.”
they’re theorizing since all this started. He doesn’t really know what to think – he can understand why Thor believes it, and it’s hard not to be convinced by his earnestness, but at the same time, Tony has
And he tried not to think too hard if she still hated him beneath all that or not. He didn’t think so, but what would he know. But probably not. They had somehow settled into a distant but professional relationship, and that had been okay for them.
“It’s okay, I’m okay.” Pepper assures, distractedly. “It’s just— There’s a lot of people here, Tony, and there’s a woman that needs my help.”
But it can’t be. There is no way she could have seen. His wound was not so high, and Tony’s chest, despite all that happened in the fight, came out only bruised, not cut or exposed—
” Nebula repeats, slightly annoyed. “They knew I hadn’t killed you, and I requested help. They knew I wanted to save you.”
“Had to save the wizard.” Tony says, which is not a proper explanation at all, but he hopes he can escape the inquisition if he makes himself look tired enough that Rhodey will go easy on him.
Tony resists the childish impulse to shake his head, as if that would help him clear his thoughts any better, even when his thoughts will scatter all over the place anyway.
Whenever he thinks about the Raft, Steve’s thoughts immediately go to Wanda. It’s obvious why. The memory of her small frame being swallowed by the straight-jacket, the collar around her neck, like she as an animal; the way her body trembled with fear and exhaustion. Her eyes looked
?” Rocket insists. “Maybe it’s not that tough. Maybe it doesn’t matter what they’re made of, only matters what they can do. We just have to go out there and find some more of this special alien material. It might not even be hard to find! Ronan had a staff that could hold the Power Stone! So whatever it was made of, the Kree probably have more!”
But the words just won’t come out of his lips, that are dry and chapped, his mouth still tasting like a damned graveyard – and what does it matter? It doesn’t. It just doesn’t. It doesn’t matter how Nebula got these clothes. All that matters is that Tony is now awake, Nebula is still with him, and they can make a run for it. That’s all that should matter.
“Are you sure about this?” Rogers asks, his eyes so damned intense it hurts to look at him. “It might be dangerous.”
But who can he really fool, after that frankly embarrassing display of absolute rage right the night before?
the people out there!” Pepper points at the door, irritably. “We should be planning to expand the area of IntelliCrops, planning how to turn the city into a sustainable power source—"
“So he was trying to kill you.” Sam concludes, adjusting his stance to make himself seem wider, voice sounding angry.
It’s awkward, just like the rest of them. Tony wonders what sort of story they have there. He wonders if Nebula would ever tell him.
, lightning cracking and forming out of nowhere to run through his skin like waves going up and down his body
“It was killing her. Slowly.” Thor admits, his voice straining painfully. “Malekith removed it from her before it could happen, but I don’t know what we could have done if he hadn’t.”
“Don’t try me, Tony.” Rhodey threatens, not meaning it even a little bit, and Tony can’t do anything but smile against his skin. “You know I’ll do it.”

The thing spins, faster and faster, creating an enormous glowing circle in the air before them – and with the loud, sharp sounds of it slicing through nothing, that so ominous sound of
“Sounds easy, doesn’t it?” Natasha laughs humorlessly, not even looking at him. She’s staring at the horizon, lost in thought, and when she crosses her arms this time it’s not to make herself look imposing; but for protection, as if she’s hugging herself because she knows
For the first time, Natasha turns her head a little, only enough so she can stare at him out of the corner or her eye for a long, uncomfortable second, before she gives a curt nod and says, harshly, “Good.”
This morning, Pepper decided she wants to fight. No – Not fight, it’s not a fight, but she wants to put on the suit and go out there with them, she wants to help, in whatever way she can. And Tony understood.
“To be honest, that usually wouldn’t impress me much, because you could say I’m a genius myself – but I’m… all out of options here.”
But Lang seems like an okay guy. A pile of nerves, yes, but he’s smart. Tony has seen his resume – academic and criminal records both, and it’s quite impressive. Not to mention the whole Ant-Man thing, which is just
Tony ducks his head down, hasting forward when they finally reach the med bay, and he pretends not to see Bruce following him with anxious strides and anticipatory stares as he punches in the entrance code, because his throat is closing up with words that are too big to fit his mouth, too heavy, too
He steps closer to it without thinking. Like a siren song, the suit drives him closer and closer, and he follows its spell, hypnotized, feeling something close to nostalgia blooming in his chest, taking over him like a storm would sweep away a shore.
“But I checked.” Scott just keeps talking, completely unaware of how deeply he has disturbed Steve. “No civilian casualties, no interaction with the public, no religious, political or ideological motivations. No conflict with German forces either, so there’s no explanation they can give to make these charges hold up to argument; so that’s a plus, I guess. The rest they can charge me with? I can negotiate. So far, the list includes: destruction of an airport – not good, but I can work with it -, escaping prison – that one is a
And no one knew. No one was looking. All it all became fucked up and SHIELD broke and— Do you have any idea how many people were compromised because of that?”
How many times have they done this? How many times, since the first time Tony could find the strength to utter the words and admit there was something wrong with him, with his head, and he couldn’t find a way to let it go or let it out? Not unless he was creating more, arming himself more, nearly to the teeth?

Maybe it’s the paranoia, but Howard doesn’t trust Obie with this. Not that he trusts anyone else either, but Obie in particular he can’t disclose this project to; because Obie is ambitious, but his ambitions are not always clear. Howard knows it. An ambitious man is a dangerous man, he knows it very well, and this is far too important to simply corrupt with a single poorly made choice. He’s not wary enough to make the man an enemy, but he’s not naïve enough to ignore it either. So, no information for Obie. Maybe a little more attention to security measures even, just to make sure no one else can figure out what exactly Howard’s been working on these last few months.
Lang stutters, smile turning into a confused, almost ashamed expression, “I helped Cap with… uh, a… thing? Not sure how to call it now, it’s actually kind of embarrassing—”
, and the body is still here, on the street. No one has come for him. For a freaking kid. Probably – Probably, whoever was in the car with him vanished, and the car crashed, and the kid was launched off the seat into the pavement. Or maybe he didn’t die then, but he climbed out of the car, confused and scared,
–, although he hesitates a bit, pondering over what words would be more sensible to ask more on the subject, but then—
“Why now?” He asks; Not accusatory, not enraged, not even pleading. Maybe, morbidly, a little curious. Because he can’t help but feel like he missed something. He must have – a chance, a choice, something on the way that could have prevented this. Maybe it’s too late – maybe, he has to keep thinking maybe, because the hard, cold truth is too much to bear right now –, but he’d like to know, he thinks. It’d hurt, but he’d like to know.
” Tony blurts, struggling with his belts and scrambling to get off the seat, pressing into the nanite case with such vigor he almost hurts his fingers. “
We're gonna get a little nerdy in the next one, folks. I hope you like that, because I'll probably have way too much fun with it! Let's hope I don't completely lose control over my word count again.
His comm is ringing. It’s on top of the table, and Steve has to get up and reach for it with his trembling fingers, and the feel of the cold hardwood floor beneath his feet is enough to make him shiver, from head to toe.
He hated crying, hated it, hated what it did to his body, the feeling of trembling for no damn reason, hands unsteady and shaky, eyes burning, the hitching of sobs.
Tony’s mouth opens without his command, a jolt of instinct he can’t suppress fast enough to avoid the movement altogether, but no words actually make past his lips; His breath catches, throat closing in like he’s swallowed a bee, uncertainty clawing at him like gashes of knives, shame burning hot at his nape.
the rush of it, the possibilities that can come out of this if he can make it work, and if his objectives have shifted since the beginning of this project, at least, his motivation has not. It has only grown. And he will see it to the end, god dammit, he’s going to
“Not any more than I was yesterday.” Tony assures her softly. “But we can fix that. If Bruce comes down to the bay with me?”
The pain echoes in him in a paradoxical, nonsensical beat, aching fresh and bleeding, the wound tearing open anew just like every other time, like a gap between his ribs where a knife just keeps puncturing over and over again, relentless. Straight into his heart, vulnerable, past all skin, muscle, metal and bone. Nothing left there to protect him to the onslaught of hurt. But at the same time, it’s old, and weary, and scarred – and Tony feels
He could never forget what Tony looked like, but in this moment, Steve feels like he’s seeing him for the first time in his life. This is what it feels like – to come
“He wouldn’t have come without the soul stone.” Nebula comments, as her eyes go unfocused for a moment. “He came for Gamora first.”
But he’s trying. He really is. Steve has never talked to Sam about it, but he knew Sam was in the VA when they first met, and Steve had done some research about it. It’s not like they had something similar in the forties— a place where soldiers could be vulnerable without fear, without feeling shame, openly and sincerely, not only behind closed doors and in hushed tones –, and learning about it had been interesting. Learning about
“Alright, this is painful to watch.” Rhodey intervenes, loudly and suddenly, and Tony’s head snaps up fast enough that he catches the others doing the exact same thing, stunned into silence at the face of the forceful authority in his voice. “Here’s how things should go. We’re gonna leave calls and rescue to the agents – I’ll organize a plan of action that’s gonna hold up at least a little longer without us, and we’re gonna focus
Wanda gives him a pleased, sheepish smirk, tilting her head to the side contentedly. “It could work.”

“Ok.” Jarvis sighs, a bit exasperated, squaring his shoulders and pushing out his chest to adjust his posture, trying to take the deepest breath he can take. “Very well. You have a deal, Deputy Chief.”
Before Tony can make any sense of what Rocket’s saying, Nebula’s voice, muffled by her distance, comes on, and she says nonchalantly:
. The dread that creeps up behind him and swallows him whole is shivering, dark and ugly, making his fingers twitchy and brow sweaty, and he has to consciously calm himself down or else he will lock up and won’t be able to move.
amount of advantage. At any point where he feels like he’s losing, he’s gonna activate it and destroy our plans, before we even get the chance to kick his ass.”
Wong doesn’t look very pleased by the idea, but he nods, knowing he has no choice. “You have to be careful.” He warns, very serious, pointing to the books in Barton’s hands. “The warnings come after the spells.”
Steve can see that. Her present is difficult, and her past is even worse, conditioning her to a life of masks and suspicious glances, of taking nothing at face-value and doubting
How many other things have passed him by and he didn’t notice? How many other secrets were buried between them, a graveyard of unspoken words, laid before them as a proof of their fragile bonds? He didn’t even know. So many graves filled with the confessions his teammates never felt the need to share with him, hiding under layers of dirt and grief to keep themselves disguised, trying not to stir too much so they won’t be seen. Hiding in plain sight, under watery eyes and choked up jokes. Steve has been digging graves for his own secrets for so long, so effectively, that he completely lost the notion of how
Nebula commands him in a low voice, holding by his shoulders and leaning down to look at his eyes, drilling the order into his mind with her unrelenting stare.
he’d said, and he could still taste the resignation and the worry in his tongue, going down his throat as he swallowed them back down, hating the feeling of being pushed back into a corner.
“Tony, I’m not…” Bruce stutters, sounding ashamed. “I’m not the best person to deal with this kind of things. You know that.”
” Bruce explains. “If it keeps going up at the rate that it is right now, we might only have sunlight for a couple of hours each day, and the exposure might even decrease over time.”

and Maria will never forgive him for it -, and every time she remembers, she cries. She sometimes cradles the board against her breast, the way she used to do with her baby, and sings a lullaby to a memory. A memory of warmth on her arms and soft sobs during the night, of mischievous laughter e broad smiles.
Thunder roars above them suddenly, loud and angry, and if Tony were religious in any way, he might have believed something in the skies was actually trying to warn them something. Maybe that there really is some judgment happening here, maybe that – maybe their chaos reaches so far and wide the universe itself can feel it, and its weeping, its crying because it also doesn’t know how to deal with it, how to cope with how beyond any sort of salvation they are.
He doesn’t know what the true answer to this is. He just doesn’t. He thought he did, but now he’s not sure, because what good did acting like this do?
“You know, I thought he was being petty.” Sam comments in an offhandedly manner, confusing Steve for a second. “Stark. When I realized you gave him a phone so he could reach you, and then, an
He remembers it very clearly, because Steve had never lived anything like that before. Not being stared down by someone who clearly wants to beat him up, no; But being so shaken himself to the point losing control, to let his ego blind him so completely that he had been ready to goad a supposed
He used to be better than this, didn’t he? He used to have more faith in humanity, he used to drive himself forward with the idea that the world is
The problem is that Steve can’t seem to have a single alone interaction with Tony that doesn’t result in bruising, and he’d really like that to stop. He wants to spend time with Tony, he wants to genuinely meet Tony, and talk to him, and learn about him. He’s more than the Academy’s first recruit – he’s their teammate and their
But the thing is— Now, he doesn’t have to think about it. Before this day, he might have. He might have pushed it to the back of his head as he did with everything he deemed not urgent, not a priority, and conveniently forgotten about it until he was completely alone and had nothing to distract him from the fear of the unknown that would eventually swallow him whole. He would have fought it back as hard as he could, for as long as he could, if he’d have his way.
it, so I’m asking what kind of armor it is.” Rhodey insists, considering Tony with a reproachful glare, like the exasperated, demanding older brother he is. “Where is it?”
Steve holds them back at the last minute, biting his tongue to keep them inside. He bites almost too hard, and he can taste the copper that floods his mouth when his teeth cut his right cheek.
“She did.” Barton says. “Once. Being on the run was tough on her. On all of us, but it got to her pretty bad. They were singling her out all the time.”
Thankfully, Thor breathes in deep and seems to back away a little, retreating into a less intimidating posture. “Not that I know of. But I haven’t heard from Valkyrie since their escape, so I don’t know.”
what happens, and Steve feels the resistance in movement only a millisecond before Tony yelps loudly in pain, and drops his drink on the floor with a loud shattering sound.
For Thanos’ fault, or the ashes fault, or Steve’s own fault – he doesn’t even know, but there are so many reasons why Tony could refuse to see him and Steve can’t handle it. Not now, not after he has lost so much. Not after thinking he’d lost Tony only to find out he didn’t. He would never deny Tony his right of telling Steve to leave – not now, at least. Not anymore. He knows better. If Tony tells him to leave, he will, even if he has to do it alone, and leave the others to stay at the Compound while he finds some other place to stay while he… While he figures out how he’s supposed to act next. He would, if Tony asked him to.
with his question, also associating this information with a tale of a fight Thor shared with them years ago, before Ultron, before it all fell apart.

“I’m okay.” Cap rasps hoarsely, sounding very much like he’s struggling, not convincing at all in his attempt to make it come off as comforting. “They’re shooting at me, not at the crowd. I got cover.”
shocked when Rogers just fucking slams his fist on the button to open the cabin door, the Jet’s hydraulic system hissing and wringing, a gust of cold wind slamming in their faces like a punch, and the reflex of pushing away and closing their eyes is too strong to stop, making it impossible for them to react fast enough.
, at all, much less without his hammer or any other kind of magical weapon. Seeing him like that, standing like a glowing beacon in the dark, exuding power and danger, with his mismatched eyes bright and inhuman, Tony is in awe, and also a little freaked out.
Sam, standing directly behind Steve, is the one who asks the question Steve can’t find in himself the strength to utter:
No family. It wasn’t because he didn’t want to, not that he would ever say it out loud, but – Family was a thing Tony thought about. It was. And one of those things he thought about was…
It’s not like Steve hadn’t respected Tony, because he did. He respects Tony’s intellect, his drive, his strength, he admires Tony in the same intensity he is sometimes aggravated by him, by his all over the place thoughts, his recklessness, his
But Maria never moves forward with him. The air is still heavy inside the mansion, carrying pain and loss to every nook and cranny, black smoke choking up lungs, stinging at the back of eyes, consuming everything like a living being. He hates it.
Tony almost blurts out, and stops himself at the last second by biting the tip of his tongue forcefully.
what all of that means. He can take a wild guess and make some assumptions, of course, but— he hadn’t considered this before. He never thought about the Avengers as a government-endorsed group, just as a rapid-response team, and as most of their PR was handled by Tony and the group he hired from SI, he had never considered how

Nebula holds his gaze and dares to raise her head higher, why Rocket straightens his spine and squares his shoulders, despite having just bared themselves to each other despite discomfort or fear? So they can all understand, so they can all exist in this same tiny pocket of time where they all came from so far away to be together for one single goal?
The way Pepper stops and waits for him to continue says a lot about how far they’ve come in this relationship. Years ago, she would have interrupted him. She had, before. Her distress would be far closer to her skin, much easier to set off, the mounting concern for hers and Tony’s safety unfamiliar and unclear though the first couple of years, making every disagreement like it was the end of the world itself. But now it isn’t. It helps, he knows, that they’ve had more talks about this than perhaps about anything else, except for Stark Industries-related subjects. It helps, that they’re older, that they don’t have some misconceptions about each other anymore, and that this… has just become one thing they are both aware is a part of their lives now. Has been, since Tony claimed the suit in front of the public. Maybe even before then.
There’s nothing broken in the Compound. The walls are up, the furniture arranged nicely and neatly, everything as it should be.
This is that innocent, insecure kind of feeling, the one that makes people’s heart ache for the very first time in their lives and leaves a mark that never fades. They are so different, so awkward, but they feel like they understand each other in their confusion, in their fears and insecurities, and being side by side makes them seem… softer. Vulnerable. Unafraid of being

fall again, after his talk with Natasha. After this afternoon alone, with only his despairing thoughts as company. He wonders if T’Challa can see those kind of details through the projection of the communicator, and he sincerely hopes not. “I’m sorry, I meant to call you earlier.”
Steve shakes his head. “No, she didn’t. Tony helped us stop Bruce in Johannesburg. He wasn’t at the site where Wanda got to us.”
“The odds of any mission can be improved if people work together.” Thor says, with a tiny, emotional smile quirking up the corner of his lips, and that sounds like it’s coming from an awfully personal place, something Thor is saying from the heart, more than just a mere motivational speech. “We’d have a better chance.”
“If they won’t listen to us, maybe they’ll listen to the President.” Cap reasons, even though he doesn’t sound very sure about it either.
“It’s obviously not the same material.” He thinks out loud, scratching his chin just so he can have something to do with his hand. “So we’ll need to find something similar to replace it.”
Soon, everyone will realize they can’t keep the Avengers shackled. They can’t hold them back with stacks of paper. When they are needed, when the world needs them to be there, they will be, and this fight can come to an end.
In any other moment, Tony would split himself in half, in however many pieces he needed, to help everyone that cried his name in plea, but he

, but he’s still here, trying to cheer him up. It doesn’t make him feel a whole lot better, but it does spark something softer inside him, something other than the rancid, ugly emotions aroused by his doubts and his regrets, something that seem a little bit like hope. Not for Captain America, and the legal mess he left behind – But for Steve Rogers, the boy from Brooklyn, the stubborn punk who’s always picking up a fight, and so desperately wants to do the right thing.
Now he has proof that it can be achieved, he feels invincible. This is merely a test-drive. He’ll still do as he planned, of course, because the problem - the initial problem - hasn’t changed. He can’t forget that. The mansion is still empty, it’s hallways still stifling and cold, and this is what he’s going to do to fix it. Then, he can move on.
This man is right. Jarvis can’t possibly know what happened without peeking inside. He will have to go to the source.
, every step and turn, every sting of pain inside his cheek where he would bite himself to keep the anger from climbing up his throat and coming out as a furious roar, a cry of anguish and fury every time the world around him tilted a bit more, losing all rhyme and sense, until he felt he could just slip over the edge and lose himself completely.
“But he was working through the internet and the systems just like JARVIS did, right?” Natasha asks. “Invading National Security databases, getting information on us? He got that like JARVIS would have, it wasn’t the Stone.”
Natasha tilts her head to the side, her eyes soft, a little sad. “I would never make you choose between us and your family.”
They haven’t really talked. Much. Or in any situation where they’re not both half mad with anxiety and pressure. And there Tony was, soaking into the comfort of his fiancé and patiently waiting for his best friend to arrive, while Nebula had been standing nearby watching,
Tony beats himself up for it the entire flight home. Not a second to breathe. It consumes him as soon as he steps out of the White House and he feels the cold wind hit his face with the same blunt impact of a baseball bat, freezing bite against his hot, sweaty skin, air so dry his throat scratches and heaves when he makes the mistake of gasping in too large of a breath; the silence in the Square is not a relief, it’s oppressing, the light drizzle of rain that still falls from the pitch-black sky is needle-thin, with barely any weight to it, almost like a kiss, but the
“Wanna bet how high?” Tony insists, grinning. “If you get it right, I don’t buy it. If I do, I buy it.”
“But it was sitting right on top of his chest.” Steve grumbles, unconsciously bringing a hand to his own hair, holding tight to the strands, not quite pulling yet but
Tony throws one last look at Rogers, feeling on edge that Rogers just stares back, like he’s trying to make Tony understand something that Tony just can’t read, because he can’t read Rogers’ fucking mind and he has no idea what kind of game he’s trying to play here.
“You won’t hurt anybody, Wanda.” He tries, one last time, hoping the desperation in his voice will be enough to cut through the gigantic shield Wanda has raised around herself.
“Didn’t your mother never tell you not to touch other people’s things?” a voice says behind him where he’s typing a set of codes he gathered from Mr. Stark’s notes, breaking through another security device implemented to SHIELD’s digital archives.
And Tony knows why. Because he ran the math, and the numbers do not lie – if pressured, Tony would shut down. And despite his worry, JARVIS needed Tony to continue working.
It’s too fucking late for that. “We destroyed New York, Sokovia, and everywhere else. Nigeria was an accident— an accident I should have prevented. I wasn’t quick enough. She shouldn’t pay for that. It was my mistake.”
He doesn’t. As he feels like he’s out of his depth, all the talent to dazzle and convince and enchant gone with the years away from the unpleasant fake niceties of the high society, and his natural penchant to read people and analyze them I completely wasted on a person like Wong, who seems to have trained all his life to be the perfect imitation of a statue. That’s the kind of stoicism Tony would expect of trained spies, like Natasha and Barton, not a guy wearing eastern-looking robes in the middle of a secret magical society in the middle of New York.
He wants to pick up the goddamned phone and call, and apologize, and try to explain himself to Tony with excuses he has no right to give. He wants to,
“Maw’s ship might have the coordinates, but the system must be working for me to be able to access it, and the ship is destroyed. So we need to access your armor using the ship’s tracking and follow the path back to where you came from.”
“I thought SHIELD had been destroyed years ago?” Rhodey asks, only a hint of an accusation in his voice.
“If I should be there even when they tell me they don’t want me to. Sometimes you should. But sometimes you shouldn’t. There are some things kids should learn on their own. And as much as I love that kid, she’s not a
, cuts deep and thin, aiming to the core, because they all what to refute it, want to be able to offer comfort words or to stand their ground and refuse the sorrow and hopelessness to drag them down, but they can’t. They are all so exhausted. They have survived the end of the world, an what for? What good did it do, to be lucky enough to dodge the bullet? There’s no real way to feel grateful for still being alive when you know so many people are gone,  and it doesn’t matter if some of your loved ones survived – they can be relieved for each other, but not for themselves.
Pepper makes a low hum, thoughtful. “They are surprisingly obedient.” She says, and there’s even a small, shy smile at the corner of her mouth, some mirth dancing in her eyes. “Wasn’t expecting that. It was alright.”
“Thank you, Vision.” Sam exhales, sounding almost out of breath, and he falls back down in the couch, rubbing his hands against his face in desperate relief. “Please… Do me a favor?” he gives a soft sniff, clearing his throat before saying, quietly:
To think Bucky would feel better just by telling him so would be the same thing as expecting Tony Stark to back down just because Steve bared his teeth. He should’ve known better. He should’ve known he was being
“If I help you escape and you die, Stark…” Nebula growls a threat, closing in over Tony threateningly, her face very close to his.
, slides his gaze to Tony’s the way a rusty hinge would work, stuttering every inch of the way, like it’s resisting the very movement its meant to do.
Tony blinks rapidly when faced with the darkness inside her eyes, the constellations lost in them flashing before him in a second, and he stops, just as Pepper stops as well, and they both struggle to regain air fast, both too eager to speak, too despaired to let silence grow again and deceive them with the idea the other is gone.
Was it that, or the fact that they never solved it? Maybe. Probably. It had been so bad, they were all so out of it— Thor had nearly
He reflexively gulps down on nothing, feeling that phantom sensation of blood between his gums once again, rubbing his palms together and leaning forward again, jittery all of a sudden, like a new rush of a drug entering his system. His leg starts to feel itchy again, and he can’t help but bounce it a little bit to take the edge off.
It occurs to him, when he thinks about it, that Natasha has never seen the two of them together. Not properly. She has seen Steve fight him, she watched Steve be arrested for him, Steve leaving for him, Steve and Bucky running away when she helped them by stopping T’Challa. But in the end, that was all she saw: snippets and pieces of a bond only shown in the light of violence, often when Bucky is running from something, as Steve is running with him.
—” Thor fumbles a little, almost ungracefully, but shoulders on, gesturing vaguely to the mockup beside Tony. “But I saw it. In the shape of a nebula.”
It’s not like Tony can’t see the logic in it, because he can. Even if Tony doesn’t always choose the most logical path, it’s not like can’t
“He also wasn’t evil.” Natasha replies. “Every other time we encountered someone who was under the influence of the Mind Stone they tried to kill us. You, Loki, Wanda, Ultron. Vision is the only one who didn’t – and he was the one carrying the Stone the longest. If all the others attacked us, why didn’t he?”
“So wait a while.” Clint suggests. “Keep doing what you’re doing. Help people when you can. Just… Just remember to give it some thought, alright? They might not be so bad, someday. I know you pretty much hate the entire thing on principle, but sometimes we gotta agree to some stupid accord so we can do our job, you know? It’s not about the politics. It’s about the people.”
“Clint.” Steve greets, and Natasha and Sam come forward and stop right by his shoulders, one in each side, forming a protective barrier around Clint’s projection in Steve’s hand.
is, Tony descends into nearly full panic, eyes wide and heart hammering inside his bruised ribcage; But even when he tries to raise his hands and grasp the hands again, his body doesn’t even respond enough to make him drop the edges of the blanket between his numb fingers, and his movement is so awkward it actually makes him tilt, losing balance, and he doesn’t have the strength to push himself back into position again.
” Shuri asks, slapping her hands on her hips indignantly. “What are you going to do? Wear that old thing to battle?” She points back to somewhere behind him, and he turns around and—
But would it matter for the others? Maybe. Who knows. Maybe they’d judge him for some of his choices.
Nothing too serious. They couldn’t do much, being in such a large group. They didn’t even have proper gear, making due with civilian clothes as they could, trying to blend in as much as possible. But now that there’s only three of them, Steve is sure they will get bolder, go deeper, act with more purpose – because he couldn’t make Wanda, who was still fragile, and Clint and Scott, who Steve still regrets to have brought to the fight, taking them away from their families, and get them back into conflict -, and it makes a strange kind of buzzing tingle beneath his bones, knowing he will go back to the fight, knowing he won’t be forced to stay still much longer.
Without any more prompting, the screen shows up from the center projector and overlaps the others, and a video starts playing, obviously taken from FRIDAY’s personal records, a footage exhibiting the inside of the compound, the conference lounge right next to the workshop.
“Wong… Thank you.” Rogers says, before any of them can react in any other way, and Tony dares to steal a look at him, curious to see if Rogers has realized the same thing Tony has, and this is his way of ensuring Wong realizes how much this means to them, after his irritable display a few moments ago by the entrance.
They climb up into the Jet and dodge Tony without thinking twice, barely acknowledging him with quick nods before they sit themselves next to Rogers and Natasha in the command chairs, as if nothing unusual is going on. Tony watches them with a strange sort of helplessness, weirded out by their presence in such a delicate matter; When he can’t help but feel that they’re…
You have no barriers left. Everything you had holding yourself together, it crumbles down along the rest of your world, turning into a pile of broken pieces at your feet.
“Wait, hold on.” Sam steps into Steve’s line of sight, looking back and forth between them with his eyes as wide as saucers. “You
look in Steve’s face registers in his brain, and he’s standing up, holding his hands in the air as a tamer would as he approaches an animal.
He catches up to them outside, behind the building, where they’re talking standing in the middle of a small parking lot. Steve suddenly realizes how
“Not exactly, but I was the only survivor on board. Banner survived because Heimdall sent him away. I do not know what Thanos would have done to him had he stayed.” Thor shakes his head. “He wanted me to witness his destruction, but I do not know why. He killed Loki for attempting to attack him, but he did not kill me when I promised him the same fate.”
“We tried.” Pepper cries, brokenhearted. “We tried. I just – I don’t think I can do this anymore, Tony.”
to know. Tony needs some secure ground to land on in al this mess, he needs them to be prepared to hold on tight to each other, or as tight as they
attached, to Peter. How could he not. The kid is – he was so great, so full of ideas and talent, and so strong-willed and just…
Tony is a mechanic, he builds things, he fixes things. But this, even to him, seems to be beyond repair.
Home is fragile, still. They are always breaking things down and putting things up again. Over and over.
So we can’t get this wrong a second time. Because if I hadn’t gone alone, Thanos wouldn’t have caught me. And he wouldn’t have been able to use me to make Gamora talk.”
Tony will carry the entire damned burned by himself if he has to, if that means that no one else suffers the consequences anymore.
The silence falls upon them with the weight of the entire world. The others watch them both, their gazes flickering between Barton and Tony like a tennis match, all their breaths held. The almost-warmth that had existed before their arrival, it’s
Thor’s earnest, honest stare is unyielding, depths of secrets so alien Tony can not even hope to unravel just by looking, a burning flame of hope and trust still living bright inside him despite all the tragedy that seems to follow him – them – like stains that refuse to be washed away. Blood and blood and blood, and yet, Thor’s faith is still as sharp and alive as he is, thriving where Tony honestly didn’t think it would ever be possible to do. Tony doesn’t know how to deal with this kind of hope. A few days ago, he would have welcomed it, like he welcomed Thor’s rage and desire for revenge, to pull the others into Tony’s outrageous plan to take back what Thanos has stolen from them—
“Thanos was expecting to have the Time and Mind Stones already when he got to Titan – that’s what he sent his minions for.” He proceed, with all the familiarity of a businessman, a no-nonsense, no leeway speech that now comes almost as second nature to him, forged on decades of performance and need to make himself taller among giants. He hates using it, but he’ll do it, if he
“What do we do?” Sam asks, already preparing to land the Quinjet in whatever place he can find, his fingers moving over the panels to quickly they almost become a blur.
He wants to be here forever. He wants the world to disappear, just for a while, just so he can lay here next to her and let her take whatever comfort she can take from him, from having a warm, solid body laying next to her own, to have her hand held, to have someone else in the room to remind herself that she is not alone. Sometimes that helps. Tony can count in one hand the number of times he has ever seen her this vulnerable, to melt in his arms not out of affection but of fear, and he hates that he has one more to add to the list. And now, they no longer have the luxury of a pause to breathe or the soothing voice of a therapist to help her unravel the irrational things her brain might be telling her after experiencing a traumatic event, which Tone knew she’d done, despite the fact he never did.
Steve sits across from him, fork in hand, decided to share the meal it seems – and Tony remembers last night, when both of them shared the last slice of the key lime pie the diner had for sale, leaning over the counter to be closer, like teenagers in love sharing sips from a milkshake, talking about
Tony doesn’t know how to respond. It feels like this is eerily similar to all their previous arguments about this, but
“You were safe.” Nebula says, misinterpreting his sudden tense posture and raised shoulders as concern; And her words are not a comfort, but it’s
once again. “A few casualties. Argentina took a little time to allow the Avengers entrance in the country, but it went well. Minimal property damage, even.”
“Thanos is delusional.” Nebula says, with her words laced in venom. “Ever since he predicted Titan’s fall, he thinks he’s had a revelation, and that’s some sort of
“I heard we were supposed to come in!” Lang explains himself, looking at the camera directly with a pleading gaze, as if he knows they are watching it. “Weren’t we? I thought we were! I saw the message Cap sent! I’m sorry I tried to destroy your ship! I was trying to help!”
“Compliance with the Sokovia Accords is one of the requirements for permission to act in international grounds— or for non-American citizens. In case of domestic action, Mr. Lang is only restricted to American laws, as is every other American person currently acting as a superhero inside the United States territory.”
He used to take it in stride. Maybe. For a short while. Besides the incident with the scepter, Steve and Tony had worked well figuring out how to deal with the Chitauri, and Steve has to admit that when Tony told him to call the shots, a weird thrill of
Natasha’s eyes widen a little, surprised, and she takes a glance to the TV so she can see for herself what Steve is talking about. When she does – when she
Sam looks at him confused, and only when the meaning of his own words dawns on him he makes an irritated face at Clint, flinging a fry in his direction, which Natasha catches so easily it never even gets close to hitting Clint. Sam huffs, annoyed, and Natasha eats the fry whole while looking him straight in the eye, her face completely blank. There is no trace of amusement in her eyes, only careful, cold consideration.
The relief ends almost immediately. It ends in gunshots and blood and grief, bleeding out on the floor, as all wars do, and Steve is coldly reminded that his service is not over yet. It’s actually just begun. And he has no time to sit idly by, trying to hear his heart beat steadily when so many others are racing with fear. No matter if it’s the first time it beats like this. No matter if this is all new to him as well.
No one answers his question. They all throw cautious glances at one another, as if they are too afraid – or maybe, they are wondering if he has finally lost his mind.
“You want honesty?” Tony asks them, voice rough and snappy, raw, the words clawing his throat in resistance all the way up from his lungs, but he forces them out anyway.
provides no clarification, but the names that follow do. FRIDAY immediately puts up two profiles, both of them with miniatures Tony instantly recognizes as SHIELD’s threat reports, both with a glaring red skull with tentacles beside their pictures, indicating their association with HYDRA. The name Johann Schmidt brings him no surprise – everyone knows who Captain America’s biggest enemy is,
“What is it?” Tony gets up, suddenly despairing, but hesitating to go forward. He sees Nebula pull out a baton, but Rocket and Pepper stop her, extending their arms in front of her to keep her still.
the Gauntlet, that’s the thing.” Rhodey reminds him. “We’re gonna have our own. So we just need the Stones.”
No!” The raccoon yells, pulling his own fur in distress, pacing around aimlessly, deliriously, his voice drunk with sorrow. “
But it’s a lie, and he knows it shows. No, not a lie, Steve trusts Wanda, but he doesn’t like being left in the dark when things can affect the team dynamics. It’s probably not fair to compare the two, but he can’t help but remember Clint, who never told them he had a family until he had no other choice, or Tony—
“Yes, it has.” Visions answers equally polite. “I am glad you are all in good health, Captain. I am sorry if I frightened you today with my presence. I assure it was not my intention to make you feel unsafe.”
He heaves, fast and broken, the air never quite reaching his lungs, his brain desperate for oxygen and going hazy all too fast, shutting down everything; Full of white noise and fear and hopelessness, of sadness and guilt and shame and pain, and Tony can’t stop
They have to put the Quinjet on the ground, because there’s nowhere else that’s safe enough. It’s terribly difficult, to find a free space large enough for the size of the jet, between the abandoned cars, the pieces of concrete that seem to have been catapulted from the explosion into the streets and buildings nearby,
“We can’t physically go everywhere they need us. It’s just impossible.” He admits, even before Bruce can make the argument. “I know. The world is too big and we have don’t have enough people. We would never be able to save everyone. We do need to fix whatever is going on with the planet – but we can’t let people waiting. So, until we figure out what to do, rescuing the survivors is our priority.”
Nebula completely ignores him, pulling him up by his bicep and sitting him down on the bench behind the pilot’s chair, to then pull out a bunch of cables from under the control panel and bring them all closer to Tony, as if she’s planning to plug him in like a damn USB cord or something, impatient.
much like a kid would – it was natural, the protectiveness and care Tony developed for him, much like he had for DUM-E, despite the little twerp’s flaws. JARVIS had been the dream, too, the dream of taking technology farther than it ever had been. Maybe Jarvis, the human Jarvis, the man with all the answers and no nonsense from Tony’s memories, would have hated the idea of being transformed into a disembodied voice – it sounded like something he would say. But Tony’s need had been too big.
“It’s two for the price of one, so what.” Tony insists, not ready to let this bone go just yet. He feels like this might actually be a line of logic that’s important to pursue.
“Honey. Hey.” He whispers, shaking her hand minutely, as much he can without moving it from its position on her lap. “Did you sleep?”
“Is he ok?” Steve suddenly asks, startling Vision with the intensity of his question. “I noticed he’s using the Arc Reactor again. We saw it in the news this morning.”
“I suppose you are calling to talk to Sergeant Barnes?” He asks then, sounding purposefully innocent. “I apologize, he is not here at the moment. I will give you the key to a secure line, from which you can contact him directly. You are not allowed on the grounds where he is residing, but that doesn’t mean you can’t contact him.”
Steve… Steve can’t accept that very well. He knows it’s illogical, and he tells himself to stop it, because he has no right of feeling offended if Natasha has doubted him in any way when he told her Bucky is innocent. But it’s just a defensive reaction. After hearing over and over that his best friend is a murderer and a monster, being doubted by a
If Vision’s feelings somehow echoed JARVIS, and they seemed like they did, at least a little, maybe he’d gotten upset when Tony simply left the team and reduced their contact in the first few months after his…
She was everything Tony liked to have around, but he shouldn’t, but Tony had never been really good at keeping danger at a safe distance.
, and that’s all that matters! That is the bottom line! There is no argument to be made here, they are
He had always tried so hard. He had always thought he had been doing all he could to save all the innocents he could. When had he started to be ok with
As they board the Quinjet, Tony slips back on his glasses, sighing in a small sensation of relief when FRIDAY’s voice echoes in his ear, proper, determined and familiar, and he resists the urge to rub at his chest, especially when Nebula is watching him like a hawk all the way to the boarding site.
He grits his teeth, pain aching all the way up to his temples from the force he applies to his own jaw as he does it, but he stands still and makes sure is tone is very polite when he answers. “Of course.”
“Are you ready to pick up your suit?” She asks him, but she’s hauling him in the direction of her lab before he can say anything, still too out of it to answer quickly enough. “My brother did tell me not to get too crazy with it, but I don’t listen to him, and I made you a great armor that is twice as light and three times stronger. Similar to the Black Panther suit. I took some liberties with the design, of course, because the whole red and blue color scheme was just terrible, but I can change it if you prefer another color. I heard you were an artist when you were younger. You probably have some preferences for color combinations and things like that. We can work something out.”
to help!? How long would it take? How many people would die if they stood by and waited for a green light every time an attack occurred, when all this time, the exact reason why they exist is because they
Steve makes a brief pause, and even before he can properly think about it, he answers, “Not really.”
and Tony’s only, a realm of creation Tony once wished Bruce could have shared with him, a place where he could bring to life things that would help the Avengers keep the world safe.
Every time he ponders about it, he remembers Ms. Carter’s warning. He remembers the story of what followed Captain America’s sacrifice, about the soldiers Johann Schmidt left behind when he vanished, and their attempts to finish what HYDRA had started. HYDRA hadn’t died when the Red Skull disappeared because there was always someone willing to take command of those who are left alive and free, he knows it well, because ideals are much harder to destroy than individuals, and HYDRA had once its claws so deep into those men that not even the alleged death of their leader would stop them.
