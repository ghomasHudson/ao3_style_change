The Bakerstreet wasn't ripped to shreds. Really nothing more than some really gorgeous lights playing off the shields.
"Of course," shouted Sherlock. He tapped his com. "Hunter, in the historical records. What building at White Sands was the center of the American research into developing Augumented humans?"
While Mummy… Chin always felt like a poor third to if either Victor or William had lived. She knew her existence kept her parents sniping from dissolving into open warfare, small as their forces were.
"Hold still, Doctor." There was a whir. He couldn't feel the wound closing, but he supposed he'd lost a lot of blood. The auto suture wouldn't do anything for nerve damage. Blood loss. It would just close the wounds.
The next morning, she woke up to find that he'd used all of Sarabeth's blowing tubes – she hadn't been too happy about that at first – and used the kiln to melt the candlestick down and make a primitive still, which… alcohol was a wonderful preservative. Disinfectant. Flammable. There were so many uses Mollyhoo literally cried when she saw it. He'd even made a several farming implements from what was left.
Some of the Augments on the ship were certain that adolescents couldn't go into heat and used exclamation points to prove their point. Others had all sorts of stories of friends of friends. Khatri wanted to know if they'd be having this discussion if the captain had become an adolescent. There was quickly deleted post that the captain was a teenager based on his behavior. Owen made a rambly post about how the worst part of pseudoheat had been the horniness, which was just like Owen and ridiculous. Everyone piled on him for reinforcing negative stereotypes about omegas. Khatri tried to defend Owen, but was crushed by a tide of exclamations and emoji's.
Understanding blossoming on his face. If the other omegas were going to be stupid, at least John could have a way to remain safe.
Their father was dead. He closed his eyes, but it didn't help. Donovan pulled Harry to her feet. She didn't resist as Security surrounded her.
Which was when another child crawled out from under the table. "I already climbed the chandelier." They looked to be only a year or so older than the other children. They had a much more pronounced case of heterochromia iridum with one blue eye and one brown. They were wearing a filmy sort of silk dress in shades of blue with white gloves. Completely not the sort of thing a child could play in at all.
John's power wasn’t about his height. It was in the way he walked. Legs slightly parted. One of Mr. Garak's bespoke suits as perfect as a suit of armor. A power suit. Powerful.
John wriggled in the bed. "Read me a story. I want to hear the story of the naughty Sugar Baby whose Sugar Daddy neglected him." John had written it a few years ago after Sherlock had forgotten him while researching some sort of vampire bubbles.
He had thought he'd made it. That Connor would grow up safe. Protected by people who wouldn't take advantage of him.
"Harry, calm down," said John. He'd never seen her so worked up. Not even when she'd flung her gender ring at him with its mask for tragedy.
He could not resist kissing the omega's cheek, when that delightful being whispered, "I hope I did get all of that." Flushing. Hoping that he had not overstepped the implications of the collar that he'd replaced around his neck. Was rewarded with a wide open smile from what surely must be his master.
"She turned biological specimens with the genetic signature of Brittanic Augments into ash. There's no way to prove that that biological material were first generation Augments and not simply some convenient corpses. There's no way for us to do a genetic match after that long."
The discussion quickly dissolved into an utterly tedious dissection of the word neutral and what it could possibly mean and what a Romulan might be, which was only broken up by Connor interjecting with introductions and deciding that since they had named the lift party, they should name everyone on the bridge. The names betrayed a certain theme.
"Liar!" Eva looked at Freddy. "Make her go away. I want Mommy!" She burst into tears and ran into Freddy's room. Presumably into the little fort they kept replicated for her there for when she stayed over.
John shouted Sherlock's name. Just his name. His spine bending backwards as he came. When he'd stopped and his breathing calmed, Sherlock lowered John into the vat used for heating water. In this case, the temperature lowered to a human comfortable degree. John whispered to the coms, his eyes closed, floating. "That was fan-fucking-tastic, but," he opened his eyes, "probably not the best use of our time."
He knew what John had gone to sickbay to do. Of course, he knew. He was Sherlock. He also didn't know. There was an entire spectrum of information that John had kept from him. Nothing like the Breen were Humans, but… possibly something Sherlock should know about.
Watson rushed into the room looking disturbed and not at all rumpled with the activities of love. "Trelane was in the Arboretum wanting to talk about his love life or lack thereof."
She wanted to shout that it wasn't irrational, but as she now knew that idea had been based on a Normal society preconception about Augments that she'd need to work on inspecting in her own reactions. If she hadn't been convinced of its truth, she'd have figured out that John was acting out of character and been able to help him. She put down the tray of plants. "No."
Still, it was lovely to talk science again with someone who'd gone to a university rather than people who'd learned everything they knew from her, and were now were trying to reinvent what she didn't have any background in.
Fortunately, Stonn appeared willing to listen to this reasoning. "That is logical, but we must do something. Sestre and Connor could be in danger."
Sherlock laughed and laughed. It was Sherlock's birthday. A swelling knot and a flower strewn meadow.
John left them. He was too tired and foggy for this. Soo-Lin was there. She cared about Billy. He went to the shuttle bay and got in 221B. Stowed his case in the storage compartment. Sat in a seat and drifted, as the others got in. As the shuttle took off.
But Sherlock was the one who wanted to play with her and make a snowman. So he was her Anna. She had to save him from Victor.
Sh'Alaack frowned, "But you're being moved to Tranquility base near Terra. Sol System planetary defense. I thought that was because you are a single parent to a young child."
Chin said mildly, "In exchange for a ten year lease of the mining and refinery operations, the Breen are willing to completely replace the old air filtration system with a more efficient one and I have been authorized to offer to replace your antiquated nuclear power system for a modern fusion system for an option to renew for an additional ten years."
John tried to follow. He wasn't sure how he bollocks up following a little girl and the only Breen in armor in a crowd, but he managed it. He did manage to backtrack to Sherlock's com badge. His Sherlock came out the gymnasium where his younger self was playing and listened to his explanation with a wry expression. "I am familiar with your deficiencies in discretely following targets." He kissed John's cheek. "You have other fine qualities."
"Perhaps, that's why you were so gaunt," said Sholto. "Were you one of the colonists on Taurus IV? Terrible when that fungus blighted all the crops and not a single replicator on the colony. I was an ensign assigned to the base. Watched it disintegrate before my eyes into chaos. People starving. Rioting. Until Kodos 'the Executioner', our base Commander decided that the way to solve the problem was to use an anti-matter disintegrator to kill four thousand people, so that there would be enough food for those that remained. He told them that they were going to be cryo-frozen. Led them into the chamber and killed them."
"Excellent, very good, John," said Sherlock in a bright tone that couldn't have been more designed to set John's teeth more on edge if Sherlock had tried. At John's look, Sherlock frowned. "You said you want respect. I'm showing my respect."
He headed for Sherlock's quarters. The door opened at his chime, but Sherlock wasn't in the living area. "Sherlock?" He went into the bedroom and stopped.
"Sir, I… I don't… I've never," Sherlock curled his neck as if he hadn't kept asking for this. John's genius. John's precious boy for the afternoon.
Alignment, said, "We should trust in fate. After all, we didn't create the one we were looking for and even if we hadn't looked for them, they would have existed.
The second Ferengi said, "Cousin, are you trying to kill me. I'm not going over to the Profit's Aspiration now that we've taken this nice clean ship."
The day the Bakerstreet went into dry dock at the Lunar base, Hudson organized a celebration in the cargo bay.
"Ummm… about that," said Lucy. "John, do you want to stay with me and Eva while we're," she waved at them, "like this."
John looked at ancient gramps carefully. "I was invited by the head of Genetics at the Beta Aurigae University to share genetic information for a study I'm conducting on a rare phenotypic trait for juvenile heat."
Within days of boarding, they were deployed at the battle of Camu V. Taking heavy fire from the Dominion ships, who apparently didn't understand the whole don't fire on hospitals thing, while maneuvering the ship to pick up escape pods, transporters made for individual transport not bulk. John wondered what could Starfleet be thinking sending so many outclassed ships?
Woke up a few hours later to blearily look at the rest of who he'd saved. Most of them were just kids. Seventeen. Eighteen. Twenty years old tops.
John had no idea how an omnipotent energy life form approached emotional relationships. "Well, sometimes it takes a long time to figure out you're meant to be with someone. It took Sherlock and me longer than most to figure we're a good fit, but… um… and you may want to talk to Lucy or Eva about this, but uh… the idea that there's one person in all the galaxy for someone is kind of restrictive. There could be many beings that you could do well with."
John, his conductor of light, kissed him. If Sherlock were not utterly spent, far preferred the adult version of his wonderful husband, who would soon be himself again, and was genuinely curious about what was going on, he might have stayed there kissing him.
"I fucked you." John growled. Grin fierce. Thrusting up suddenly, the swell of his knot stopping just short of entering Sherlock, who spread his legs wider. Pulled up only to sink down again. Taking more. More. More.  Sherlock never wanted this to stop. His lungs struggling, mind shorting in white flashes, as John's knot breached inside. Stretching him further. He hazily thought that he was in heat. His first heat. All he could do was move faster. Push harder for more.
Not-Sherlock dropped it to the floor and cupped John's face in his hands. He licked at the blood on his face. Delicately. Sweetly. With a sort of awestruck expression. "Was this your plan all along? To draw Victorious out of his palace. Get him away from his guards. Give our children everything we dreamed of? Was this why you left?"
It was such a strange echo of that night so long ago, that John just stared as the figure took on three Ferengi and several seedy looking Klingons. John laughed and joined in the melee. No one died this time.
"Lucky to have you as a parent," said John. Staunchly. Firmly. He didn't ask about transfers. He liked the idea of his children playing with Melas and Owen's kids.
John had gone off to the Magdalene's to straighten himself out, but getting some peace in the family had played a part too.
Mollyhoo was too young to be one of the original Augments. A child perhaps. She could also be one of the Augments that the Breen kept kidnapping. Too complicated a question for the moment. "Where are we?" yelled John to be heard over the sound of the rain.
"Which means?" asked John, because that was all the situation needed. For Sherlock to have gotten into trouble as well.
What if Ferengi and Orions and Normals went from trying to grab the occasional omega to grabbing every Augment to grind up their bones? Their blood. The bits in between. Because that's how it would go. Nasty bit by bit. Even if those bits didn't do a bit of medical good.
"Oh, ho," said Culverton. "Someone's been making some changes to your program since last I was onboard ship. Well, technically the last time was a bit of a flyby. When I was a resident then."
Hobb said, "We," he glanced at Chin and the three armored Breen standing silently behind her, "tried that, but…"
But the presence of a time portal indicated it was more likely someone had been sent back in time to create the Breen race with the creation of a temple to commemorate whoever that had been. Although, that ran into issues of paradox if the Breen literally arranged their own development as a species, and raised the question of parallel realities versus an actual change in the timeline.
"Ta," said John who did have a pretty good grasp on his Greek monsters thanks to his dad, who'd loved reading the original gruesome Greek myths to John and Harry when they'd been tots.
Veema blushed. Bright red. Brilliant red. "I…" Veema cleared their throat, "I thought I'd be better at this. But standing in your presence is overwhelming."
"You bred me. I know it. I felt it." Sherlock briefly scowled at John. "You never told me what it felt like when the ovum are released." His smile broke through the clouds again. "It was amazing. I did my best to record the sensation. It was all so different."
Really only Mummy and her fathers could answer that question. They wouldn't. They'd never answered a single question that she'd asked. Ranted. Raved. Pontificated. Panegyrics. But never an answer to why or what or how.
Damar said, "I was afraid of this. I warned you that Cardassia does not have the economic might of the Federation. A mere four months, they are already out producing us. This disparity will only increase. Out recruiting us. Cardassia could never have recovered from a loss like the Seventh Fleet. If we are to hold onto our gains, we need to declare a truce. Focus on destroying the mines blocking the route to the Gamma Quadrant."
"You don't know," said Wiglaf, "But how don't you know? You're from the 21st Century and everything."
If he hadn't known that his every gene had been architected and examined before he'd been gestated in a uterine replicator, he'd have thought that he was missing a key component in his V1RL87 gene, which should have allowed him to detect from John's pheromones that this was a pseudoheat and not a juvenile heat, which in turn would have circumvented a desire to rut with John.
But as crew who'd known him as Lieutenant and Doctor Watson left and were replaced by those who knew him as the captain's husband, John Watson, the ship's doctor, in that order, he could see a trend that he didn't like.
He kissed the alpha's hand. "I still think we're married. Because you're brilliant and beautiful, and anyone would be lucky to have you." He hoped they were married.
John loved to cook, and yet since their marriage, every night they'd eaten a quick replicated meal before hurriedly flipping on the privacy shield, stripping out of their clothes and falling into each other's arms.
John leaned back in the shell, which was well lined with a spongy sort of substance. He let his legs fall apart. "What could I do to please a god?"
After that, Connor was released to transport home with Connor to Grandfather's home by the lake, which for the first time to Billy seemed very isolated rather than soothing. But then he'd never had a chance to see much of nature before what with the war and then living on a spaceship.
Bihr put her hands on his shoulders without hesitation. "I am sure that you do yourself a disservice. It is good to meet you." She rested her forehead against his in greeting. Because she needed to ground herself. Even if that ground was sand.
Hunter said, "Probably made sense while we were at war with the Cardassians. Although, given the majority of the Federation bases are just listening posts and supply depots, they are kind of stretching things."
Distantly, John could see that Billy was terrified. John's hand felt infinitely far away as he laid it on Billy's shoulder. "It'll be fine." He didn't know that. It probably wouldn't be. How could anything be fine ever again? He should say something. "Don't worry. This is not the twenty-first century."
"Yes, I can help with that." Chin snapped her fingers and pointed at the next room. Her strike squad, their expressions hidden by their armor, certainly unable due to her position to remonstrate her for her egregious breach in protocol for removing her helmet, followed the reluctant Connor into the next chamber.
Pavan snorted. "There was a brief war over whether we should intervene in fate, and free the Khans, which I will remind everyone," multiple Breen scowled, "We were absolutely correct to do."
"News about John. Attack on Camus. Attack here," said Sherlock wanting to move. To shift this body away from Moriarty's fingers combing through his hair. Not his hair. Wilke's hair. He managed to shift his foot. A centimeter. Not far at all. Twist it into a painful angle.
"Fuck off. Can't you tell he doesn't want you?" said John, feeling goatish and angry and who the fuck did this curly haired fuck think he was touching John's Sherlock. John cupped his hand around Sherlock's to remind him that he belonged to John. That he was John's to fuck and breed. He bent down and whispered that into Sherlock's ear. Sherlock sighed. Leaned into his hand. His robe thing doing little to hide his pretty little arousal. To hind the unfolding scent of an omega going into heat.
Alexis shuddered. Apollo couldn't be the Greek god of the sun. They knew that. They also knew that they shouldn't be behaving this way within minutes of meeting someone. Anyone. A god. Swept up and sweeping away all good sense.
Vesha said, "Let's name this one Marymor." He smiled sheepishly. "I knew a Marymor once. She was hot."
"Not fifteen," said Hudson swinging her legs over the side of another biobed as if this were fun. An adventure. Her legs were long enough to reach the floor. "Definitely not fifteen." She cupped her own breasts. Again and gave them a little fluff. "They were just so pert at this age. And I can do this again." She lifted a leg up next to her head. Again.
A mistake in identity he blamed on his current body's inferior brain. Second Father was not Sherlock's age and there were several significant differences. Eye color. Curve of the mouth more like First Father's. Several things clicked into place. Soo-Lin Yao. Chin Singh. Singh. Noonien Singh.
Dionysus lightly touched Sherlock's bared shoulder. John wished he could stand on both sides of Sherlock, but he was sticking to the half-naked side.
On the day they would have been due, John took Sherlock down to the observation deck at the bottom of the Bakerstreet. They sat over the clear view port and looked down into infinite space. For once, it wasn't a comfort. For all he held John and they made slow love over a reminder of just how small and insignificant they really were.
Billy nodded. "Hudson's been showing me how to use ordinary items to…" his expression darkened, "defend myself."
Unless, of course, John didn't go back to their cabin. Instead, his husband dropped by sickbay, to drop a kiss on the marks he'd made long ago on John's neck. Just a little scent marking. A little standing very close behind John while he stood next to a biobed. Rubbing his still very interested cock against John's arse. John's wet cunt fluttering and his cock giving a little jump to semi and then completely hard. Which would be when his brilliant husband, who loved him very much, turned on the privacy shield and they made love to each other while John whispered what the monitors said about their bodies. While his husband watched the way lines and waves of their thoughts moved as they came.
John slid slick skin against skin, as he and Sherlock as they made love in the cave with the warm spring. Warm after they dropped hot rocks in it. But Sherlock wanted to be clean. The last hunt had been… messy and unsuccessful. More mud and slide than success, and Sherlock liked to be clean. Clever and clean. Words. John wanted to give Sherlock so many words. So hot rocks and the burning soap that made John's nose itch and hands sliding over skin and washing Sherlock's hair and making love. Their voices echoing on the rocks.
He found himself wondering why he had been so surprised that Harry had transitioned. After all, it was the orientation she'd been born with. Nothing odd with realizing that she'd made a mistake born out of her feeling of alienation at the stresses John's behavior had put on their family.
Behind them, the Atavachron popped and showered sparks. Trelane shrugged. "It was an antique and in all fairness I'm the reason it didn't do that while you were travelling through it. He grinned. "Subtlety is my middle name."
Grandfather had acted like a hundred wasn't a lot of people, but it was. Especially when they were all watching him. At first he figured it was like back on the Bakerstreet. If someone new had joined in, but not really.
"Fine," said John with a narrow eyed look. Who had to be able to scent Sherlock. Had to spell Sherlock's arousal.
She made herself say, even though she didn't want to, "Even if I'm stuck reading about our ancestors being tortured in WWIII, I want to know."
It also meant massive numbers of promotions and reshuffling to put experienced officers in command of all those shiny new Ensigns. Starfleet Command had tapped the merchant marine. Raided planetary defense corps. Lestrade flipped through his list of commanders and found he had one captain, whose last command had been a search and rescue craft. In all fairness, the Constitution class ship she'd be commanding had been pulled from the Academy training vessels.
Worst yet that Sherlock had to go to his own quarters from time to time to make it appear as if someone was staying in them. A muttered suggestion from Bashir.
Something wasn't quite right. John stood there staring at the monitor when it hit him. "Wait, for someone so worried about the Breen interfering in the colony, Killander didn't care at all about what's going on down on the planet."
The captain struck a particularly hard blow into the stone and the pickaxe snapped. He looked at the broken pieces. "It would be a bad idea."
Sherlock was about say that this was the closest Garak was getting to his inseam when Garak said, "May we expect another visit from your brother?"
"I was just… would you be interested in… seeing you like this, now that I can think, makes me speculate about what our progeny might look like. Be like. Hostages to fate, but interesting."
"Does anyone know if someone has turned those events into a play?" asked Mum. Everyone looked at her. "It would be exceptionally dramatic. A colony in chaos. The seduction of hard choices. Karaidian would be simply fantastic in that role." She dabbed her lips. "If I didn't take the role of Kodos for myself." She put down her napkin. "Commander Holmes, I'm sure we'll have plenty of time to talk over the next week. But I should make sure they're alright." By which John knew she meant that she was going to check if the events on Taurus IV had been turned into a play, and if not work on her own version. Mum was incorrigible.
This was what became of her sweet poet when their world fell apart. Of course, Khel and Shroleb would leave for the good of the child. Except, she didn't know them. She didn't know the other version of herself.
Still that night, she read the bedtime story to her children. It was Thil's night to pick. So inevitably, he picked Aidalas the Constant. There was a certain warm comfort in a story of revenge and honor sent by a woman with whom Bihr had made a separate peace.
"If you kill him, I'll destroy the power for the facility," said Sherlock through the com. "You could kidnap a hundred Controllers and they couldn't help you."
Two identical people were sitting on chairs in the center of the room. They both drew in a breath as she entered and stood up.
What he was doing was quite probably a mistake. Possibly a waste of time. Coitus with John in this scenario would only lead to the idea that this was some form of life. It was not. The increasingly bizarre notes left by the previous consciousness over time in the manual made that clear.
He'd invited Elim a time or two on a few of Mummy's less important ventures. Not that Mummy approved, but Mummy approved of so little. At least now that Chin had taken up with Billy, some of the pressure was off of Mycroft. As to why Sherlock was free to be pressureless once he escaped the family home so to speak, Mummy had shared the reason long ago when Mycroft had been just fourteen.
Billy whispered back, "She can help us." Connor's expression didn't change. "She helped with the Horta."
"Now," said the Captain, and from the depths of the blue sky, lasers raked the heavens. Blasting the temple where they'd lately lain in love.
Then he played Leider. Suppressed a reaction as John worked Sherlock's cock into his mouth while Sherlock played.
The Tamarian Ambassador bowed. "When the red ice cutter of Thasillar rounds Mount Fear." He smiled gently. "The fatted calf is prepared. The feast of Teleros continues long into the night."
"And what if a vessel answers the signal that these birds of garbage cannot deal with?" asked Nom. "These ships are held together by rust and Klingon vomit."
Mycroft said, "It is quite simply not possible. I'm much more interested in the attempt by a Starfleet officer to create an incident with my clients."
John ignored his dad. He had to. He walked towards Sh'Alaack. "Bihr, you're injured. You should be in bed."
Sherlock was standing by the chalkboard in the Hogwarts potion's classroom. His back was to the door as he wrote something from Jabir. Because Sherlock hadn't read a popular children's series, but he'd read all the medieval alchemists. Sherlock's deep voice did lovely things to John's flesh around the toys. "Mr. Watson. Late a…" pausing as John's own scent reached him. He cleared his throat. "Again."
Lethe's pheromones roiled out of the shuttlepod. Thick and oily in the air. Slightly burnt like caramelized apples left too long in the oven. But then again, John wasn't the target of her scent. Behind him, Sherlock shuddered and shifted to move close to John. Breathing deeply against his neck. While Sh'Alaack recoiled three steps back.
Sherlock nuzzled John's neck. Suddenly, sitting up "Oh! Your school was the source of the pornographic plugin that you used on the holodeck."
"I haven't… let's see what you're worrying about." Billy logged on to the Augment channel and scrolled through strings of comments. It seemed John and Ms. Hudson had been turned into teenagers along with Lucy.
"Fine, you keep talking about me. Explain why you kept sneaking off at all hours of the night. Why should saw you leaving the theater with some bloke. The time she saw you snogging a stranger while dressed as the pirate queen of Orion in some bar," said John, who'd wanted to take Harry's side. Had taken Harry's side. Until Clara showed him the picture of Harry with some random Human. Laid into him as a proxy for laying into Harry.
Sherlock grinned. "Now that I know what happened, I can fix this. We even have plants to test with."
As a tier three secure site, every change had to go through documented change control. Architectural review on proposed designs through at least two review boards.
"But he decided to send our ancestors back," started Terellhoo, before they were drowned out by the shouting crowd.
John followed his gaze and coughed a laugh at the Priapus, whose member was erect and towered over its head. "And what exactly do think these people worship?"
In a comparison with his own genetics, Sherlock's SNPs showed a significant number of variations in some really interesting places.
John rubbed the numb spot on his left leg and reminded himself that by now they should have arrived on Beta Aurigae. The planetary authorities would contact the Bakerstreet.
Sherlock's body – Sherlock – let out a long shuddering breath. He lifted his hand and moved his fingers. "It would seem that I am."
Sherlock was holding the black leather collar that he liked to wear when being the Emperor's favorite concubine.
Karidian Watson's records in the Federation census were useless. There were nine thousand, eight hundred, and forty six Karidian Watsons. Three hundred and ten of whom were alpha Augments. Ninety-four of which had no pictures or details on file. The spouse of Elise Watson, father of Harry Watson and John Watson, had had minimal records on file until he began his life on stage, which was not atypical for individuals from some of the more back to nature colony worlds.
For a few minutes, John could forget. Laugh. As it turned out it was both Billy and Soo-Lin's first experience with live theater. Eva could hardly take her eyes of the stage. Sestre gasped when the humble shepherd beset by bandits transformed into a dinosaur. Connor clapped when the dinosaur became a star.
He kept repeating it until a very irritated voice said, "Quiet." A tray shivered into shape by the door. There were four cups full of blue liquid and what looked like red jello. "Drink the medicine. Eat the nutrient mix. Stay hydrated."
Finney vaguely patted a wall. "Never could have made it here without your help, Twig. Been some sixty years since I could make a climb like that."
Sh'Alaack said, "I will contact you through the communicator when my place is secure at the palace." Neither of them said that she might be found out almost immediately. Neither of them said anything about Ishros and Lestrade's doppelgangers or speculated on their own. There were a lot of things they weren't saying
"I… I don't know." They looked over and Connor was looking at them. "Not right now. Maybe… not right now."
"Ah, yes." She breathed out. "I wanted to tell you before. When I found out where you were after the Borg invasion. But Mummy made me swear not to reveal who I was." She rolled her eyes. "Mycroft suggested it might be useful if I kept a clandestine eye on you."
"That's not when it happened." She looked at him sharply. "It was before then. We were still kids. You stopped talking about acting together. Didn't want to go on stage at all. Started talking about going to Starfleet. Becoming a doctor. It was all you could talk about." She shook her head. "I spent three months sitting in a circle with other murderers trying to figure out when we stopped being close. Processing that even if it felt like you didn't want to be around me that wasn't what happened." She rubbed her chest. She looked thin. Like she hadn't been eating enough. There was a grainy quality to her skin that John didn't like. She waggled her fingers. "There was finger painting."
Still, it did give her a chance to look up just what the fuck had happened to Andor. To the Federation. To Earth.
Ferengi sniffed again and gestrured with the disrupter. They came to an open panel that led into a Jeffries tube. The Ferengi grabbed John by the wrist. Even as short as the man was, he outmassed John by forty-five to fifty liters at least. He said, "Do not think to attempt to escape. My cousin is waiting above us." John sighed and climbed up the ladder inside the tube. At the top, there was another Ferengi, equally snaggle toothed. Between them, they took John to the children's classroom. There was a force shield in front of the door. A Ferengi was on guard there, watching a profit-novella. "Another child!" He sniffed, "Another omega. This ship is full of treasures. Someone will want to buy it. Truly Rule 75 is correct. Home is where the heart is, but the stars are made of latinum."
Bihr said, "I'm a servitor in the palace. Long story. I have access to a replicator and am working on a way home."
"I… I… I… you left me alone! You don't… you don't care!" This last word came out as a wail. John didn't know what had come over him. Despair clung to his blood like a liquid tar. It weighed down his feet and arms. He could hardly move.
John reached out and took Sherlock's hand. He didn't let it go until they were in the landing bay and both of them needed their hands figure out the lock and get them out of there.
From across the cavern came the rhythmic sound of Captain Holmes' pickaxe piercing the stone. Breaking it apart. She'd known he was strong. Tireless, but until they'd come here, she'd had no true sense of what that meant.
Understanding that his parent's definition of love had made no place for such a thing, and how wonderful that John had provided the metaphor. The idea. The light.
Bihr had heard many things about Eshess over the years. Her beauty. Her brilliant mind. Her adventuring spirit. She looked at the ghost of her lovers' lost love and said, "It's a pleasure to meet you."
John hated Victorious. Always had, even after all he'd done for them. But then, John was possessive of Sherlock's love. Indulgent with their children, after all they were theirs. He was short-tempered with his father's grief. But Victorious, he loathed.
For a moment, John's brain fritzed. He wanted to launch himself at his alpha, but there was a scenario. The play must… go on or something. "Sorry, Professor." Ever more aware of the stimulators lodged inside him. John sat down at the only empty chair.
"No," Trelane put a heavy level of scorn in that no. Jupiter's gravity levels of scorn. "They're the ones who told me to get out of the Continuum for a bit and leave them alone. They suggested I come talk to you."
Getting a sample of Sherlock's semen wasn't exactly difficult under the circumstances, but certainly necessary if John was going to understand what was going on.
"Because she's attractive," said Harry, "I could say that that's more than I can say for John, but," she waved at herself, feeling good to finally have her silver ring back, "obviously, we're stunning."
As Sherlock concluded, the crowd leapt to its feet, John at the front clapping furiously. A wave of sound. Adoration. He bathed in auditory stimuli that slowly shifted into a party in a crowded club.
Sherlock very lightly, he had enormous control given the fragility of some of items he was expected to service in this room, brushed a pseudopod over John's cheek. "Shall I stop?"
"We can carve and paint messages into the rocks. Something simple. The star positions of when we landed and the star positions now. The image of the Atavachron and the Bakerstreet. If the Bakerstreet tracks our shuttle, if the art survives, if the people who built the temple include a reference to it in one of the other buildings, if the crew the Bakerstreet see the art, then they can easily extrapolate when to open the portal and bring us back. We'll just need to be sure to include some fertility figures to ensure that it gets displayed."
"Then we'll praise the gods," said John, moving his hand to lightly glide along Sherlock's slender neck.
Looking down into those eyes as he pushed inside. Saw the way they slightly widened. Knew his own expression wasn't far from different. Amazed. John's body slick and hot around him. Cock. Cunt. Fuck. Sherlock said the words that John's tight squeeze and quickening breath and sweat and scent told him that John wanted to hear.
Actually, there were any number of things that were not quite to Starfleet code on the Bakerstreet, but all minor infractions. Especially now that Sherlock and John were safely married, if going through a bit of a period of adjustment following their honeymoon period.
Mollyhoo stepped over a log. "What they didn't tell you in that temple of yours?" She shook her head. "The tribunal that presided over my 'trial' wouldn't shut up about how Sarpeidon the Great, glorious leader of the Fenisal race, was sending us back through the Atavachron to the dawn of time to the doom of my pestilential vermin race. You know, basic Fenisal prejudice with an extra bit of crazy because Sarpeidon's well… not exactly well hinged."
John hoped he'd keep talking until one of them could get closer to one of the panels that were still lying on the floor. Ginger and Brown were a bit busy trying to get the ship turned around.
Connor said, "I want to stay with my Mum." He laced his hand in Billy's. He stood up. He'd gotten so much taller in the last year. Losing his baby fat. Her heart ached for him. His expression was far older than it should have to be. "I don't want to be separated from him."
Not that Billy hadn't felt a stab of fear every time Connor was out of sight. Reliving the day that Colonel Green's men had broken down the door to their windowless attic room above that old department store.
Sherlock explored the cave system, but thankfully didn't dive into the underground river that rushed through one of the lower levels. Pushed himself harder and harder. Returning with food for their stores. On one occasion dragging a fully grown fruit tree, which might survive being ripped up and replanted. Maybe. Lucy wasn't with them, thankfully.
Martha said, "I'm not going to press charges. You thought you had a reason to mutiny. Considering events, it's questionable who was correct."
"Yeah, that’s my family," said John. Suddenly certain, absolutely certain that his mother was going to know everything the moment she walked on the ship. He hadn't precisely told his parents that he was involved with Sherlock. His commanding officer.
"I am very happy in my job," said Lethe softly. "It fulfills me to be the best me I can be." There was no animation to her expression. Nothing to indicate joy or happiness.
"Quiet!" Hahn rubbed his face. "LaForge, show the projections Admiralty again. Even shifting all civilian shipyards to Starfleet production, we're looking at,"
"Fifty of your Earth years," said figure with yellow piping along the edges of the armored plates. Other figures were green or blue. No figure’s colors were repeated.
John engaged in a discussion about the relative merits of various root vegetables when making rue with Sisko. As Sherlock recalled, they'd had a variation on this conversation before.
Harry let Mum mother her before the authorities came to take her away. Not before arranging for a children's version of the Count of Monte Cristo to be beamed to Sh'Alaack's children on the Bakerstreet.
Sarabeth sighed. "Mollyhoo is a bit old fashioned. Fundamentalist family. Not as bad as Jovas, but John, you're right. We should ask both of you."
"Course," Fisher nodded his head pedantically, "You may notice a slight static on the materialization. There's an ion storm incoming, which will require us to boost the transmission."
"That does seem to be the first question I get asked since coming to the future," said Billy. "Except from Soo Lin. She just assumed it was. Course… according to what Mum heard from her mum, it was more complicated than that." He sank back into the cushions of the couch. "Grandmother thought if she got close to him, she'd be safe. Protected from all the chaos going on. While mum, my Grandfather would carry her around on his shoulders and tell everyone she was his little princess. First five years of her life were spent in a castle next to a lake in the mountains. She had a room just for her toys in a tower. Rest, didn't quite work out that way."
"Here," she said. "Just as glad not to have been stunned again. But I am just an elderly old woman with a child." Billy thrashed on a bunk next to John. Hudson said, "Billy calm down. Connor is on the bunk with me. He's fine."
Their daily lives were action adventures. Leaning against the back wall of a transporter room, having almost died because some living rock aliens on Excalbia setup a battle between good and evil for them to fight in. Sure John got to punch a simulacrum of Colonel Green, but they got the simulacrums of Surak and Abraham Lincoln killed. But looking at Sherlock with his shirt torn and his face smudged, it was incredibly hard not to reach out for him. For John at least.
He transported the plant. She was able to confirm that it was an adult plant. His smile at her was brilliant. "I'll tell the others." He practically bounced from the room.
Sherlock wasn't entirely pleased with this level of information. There were too many unknowns and suppositions based on old grievances.
"I want a story, Daddy," said John, pulling Sherlock's hand back to his chin. Up to his lips. He stole a little kiss.
John was distracted by Yao's loud admission that she'd never seen live theater, which was quickly followed by Billy admitting the same. Yao could not possibly had known his objective, but with John thus focused on an energetic discussion of the merits of the theater experience, Sherlock accepted the invitation.
In the last few years, Mollyhoo had been too miserable during the winter, unable to think for more than a few days at a time. Now she had free time with the food stores full of supplies.
There was no reason for creepy fucking guards to be on the landing pad in the colony. No reason. They were supposed to be up in the guard area at the top of the dome. They certainly weren't supposed to be turning their backs on the smiling colonists. At any point, one of the cons could have grabbed a weapon.
The eleventh time, Sherlock woke determined to convince his parents to let him go. To find John. Apologize for abandoning their children in the past, and do something about it.
If he got angry when during a diplomatic mission, Sherlock practically glued himself to John's side and he could see the ambassador's attaches snickering at them, it was because he'd been in more tight situations than all of them combined. To have not one but three separate people ask him when he and Sherlock were planning on kids, and what Starbase he'd settle on when they did. As if his sole purpose in life was to spit out a child or two. End of adventure.
"Which is not necessarily related to what we're discussing," said Sisko. "It's a slippery slope when we begin to question every citizen's right to privacy in the interests of the public good. Especially when society always finds a way to target," his smile was fierce, "vulnerable populations first."
The green Breen removed their helmet. Another Human omega. Also a Human with short cropped black hair and blue eyes. "Yes. They were our ancestors. We are like you." They bowed, hands pressed together. "I am Pavan of the 5th Alignment, and this is Veema of the 1st," they waved at the other Breen, who were slowly taking off their helmets. "These are the representatives of all the alignments.
Mollyhoo gasped. "What! I didn't think the Confederation would… well, I'm going to focus on the idea that we didn't kill ourselves off as a species or there wouldn't be a temple." Mollyhoo stopped in the middle of the trail. "But if you weren't prepared, the time dilation will make you revert to a sort of… aggressive…savage." Toby rubbed against her as if to say, rain is bad, when she shook her head. "You know what… we'll figure it out." Mollyhoo sighed. "And you're science people. I have omegas with science backgrounds to talk to and I'm going to lose that. I mean yeah, it's worse for you, and you may try and kill us, but while I love my Sarabeth, she wouldn't know a pathogen from a reagent. This is just depressing. Not to mention nuclear winter. Yikes."
The rucksack that he'd filled with tools that morning lay mocking him on the ground. He twisted to kick it across the plaza.
His resistance was – as the Borg might say – futile. In as much as it took the form of stretching himself with this or that toy that was conveniently in his bed stand. In that it took the form of stroking John's chest until his breathing shifted to indicate that first sleep had ended.
"Doctor Culverton, I have access to the entire Starfleet medical database and my own experience since being activated. Mr. Wilkes' symptoms are consistent with celebium poisoning. You yourself said the other personnel from your expedition died of celebrium exposure."
"Daddy, I wish you'd retrogene us," said blue eyed blond, looking so much like Harry and John at that age that it hurt. "I don't like the suppressors, but I don't want to… Juvenile Heat sucks arse."
Keened, as Sherlock began to move. Stroking gently. Both their breaths coming faster and faster. John could feel Sherlock's knot swelling at just the edge of sphincter muscles. Pressing against, but not pushed inside. Was dimly glad of it as it expanded. Sherlock came inside of him. Held him. His arms around John. Their hearts thundering.
Telling himself over and over that the universe had given him a sign it was past time to visit his sister.
"Ms. Hudson got word that her niece was going to be on Beta Aurigae," said Billy. "Although, I wasn't sure if she made that up so she could come with me."
"We must answer the distress call," said Donovan. "The science team on Ligos VII said that they needed immediate evacuation."
"No," Sholto's grim smile grew even more rictus strange. "He escaped justice by killing himself in the anti-matter disintegrator. Of course, that leaves no trace." He leaned forward, "and all his records were scrambled from Memory Alpha in a freak accident."
"That's a little simplistic, but sure. Like Toby," said Mollyhoo. She tossed the creature's liver in the air. Toby snatched it and went to eat it in a corner.
But while the stores of dried meat and fruit, wild grains, and root vegetables increased in the refrigeration room, as the leaves turned brilliant yellow and red, and began to fall from the trees, the future didn't come.
John stepped out of the narrow door and into a cobbled street. There was a silk lined litter waiting outside with four massive holographic slaves in rich attire. Sherlock was tossed into it with John, who was not going to break character and help Sherlock. Then again, given the way Sherlock was bravely glowering at him, it was in character for John to trace a finger along his soft cheek, earning himself a shocked look. "You are quite beautiful. The more so now that I truly see you in Helios' light."
For John's last birthday, after John had dance-flirted with the jet set at Area 51 in 1970s New York in a fairly ridiculous baby doll white lace dress, Sherlock had taken him over his knee and spanked him once for every year of his life before fucking his bright red arse on a balcony. It had been fantastic. So, John was determined that Sherlock wasn't going to know what hit him. If Sherlock wanted cloud soft worship. Affirmation on adoration. Then John was more than happy to make that happen.
Donovan sighed, completely unphased by the thought of Internal Affairs or Section 31. "The crew have been assigned fucking shore leave. Such the fuck as it is on a rock like Janus. I'd have sent you a fucking list if I'd realize you'd give a fuck."
Sherlock stepped forward. Not coincidentally moving between Sholto and John. "I'm not sure why. Your tone and body language clearly indicate that you don't enjoy live theater. The regulation layout of this shuttle bay. Everything in its prescribed place. The way you wear your hair. Your formal uniform on a remote base on a small planet. They all speak to a man who likes to be in control of his situation. That must be why you initiated relationships with your students when you were teaching at the academy. That put you in a position of power and control."
"Oh," said Wiglaf. He chewed on his steak. "I thought maybe you were sitting here to check up on us. Because I'm a distant descendant of Grendel. To see if I'm good enough to go to the um… ass," he smiled softly, "class. Maybe spend more than a few afternoons in the Gold Zone at um… many times Great Grandfather Grendel's. The asinine asses said that I'm not Augment enough to go there. They live in the Gold Zone with their parents. I'm only allowed in the Green Zone with the Augments who decided to stay and have kids here, or sometimes I volunteer in Red Zone to show the ones who don't want to be here what they're missing, which requires special permission. Not everyone can go there." Fenrir groaned and rolled her eyes.. "Not the Purple by the port." He trailed off. A compressed bag with all its air released.
The rumbly feeling in Connor's belly didn't go away. If anything, as he burrowed against his mummy, it got worse.
"Interesting." Victor spun the pen-knife over and over. "You aren't him. It's such an outlandish idea, it didn't even occur to me. But you have markers on your middle and index finger consistent with someone consistently holding a hypospray. If William weren't in such a state over his pet, he'd have noticed before now himself." He spread his left hand. "What of it. You are in a John shape, which is what I require."
She watched him chisel at the rock. A brilliant Human reduced to something a machine could do far more easily. If it wouldn't have provided them with weapons. She wanted to ask him what his plan was, but the drone monitoring them from across the cavern had yet to succumb to electrical failure from vendarite dust. She could wait. After long moments, she was surprised to hear him say, "You're worried about your children."
"I… don't know." Billy could almost hear Hudson telling him that he should always review all the information about the layout of a location before going there. He'd run the scenarios, but he hadn't applied the knowledge. But there was still time.
Sherlock blinked. Exposed. Fragile. Vulnerable. Bare. John moved to fill the bare spot, an arm sliding around his waist. Firm. His ever fixed point. His body blazing with warmth through the wool. Smelling wonderfully of John and grape seed oil.
John had not gone through pseudo heat. He was going through pseudo heat. Thinking about his alluringly sultry scent would not solve the essential problem that John had regressed in age.
"Not at all. I thought…when you didn't know me immediately that I had…" Chin trailed off into a useless silence.
Still they reached a holding area. There were dozens of roughly dressed beings of a dozen races pushing equally ragged looking folks in restraints toward Breen scattered throughout the room. "Here we must part," said the daimon. "And thank you for allowing me to doubly profit from the venture."
Culverton said, with a wrinkle of his nose, "Delete the last ten minutes of memory. In fact, delete the program. He was annoying anyway."
Chin didn't ask why the fact that William had lived had been kept a secret from her. It could have any number of reasons.
Better than John, who groaned where he was lying on another biobed, pushing his rear into the cushions beneath him. It looked like his pseudoheat was hitting him a lot worse than Lucy's. She had no idea what she smelled like, but his scent reminded Lucy of standing under the pergola at Grammy's in March. Rioting with purple wisteria and star jasmine, vines dripping flowers on all sides. An overwhelming scent of sultry fragrance with just a touch of aromatic compost over the wisteria roots, and wood rot from that one stump grammy liked to use as a bench.
There were toasts. Sherlock hardly tasted the champagne. He was too busy looking at John, who was looking at him. He was John's husband. He belonged with John.
Sherlock watched John take the tablet. There was a roar in Sherlock's ears. A thunder at the windows to the mind palace.
"Not so much," said not-Lestrade. He gave John a long droll look, so much like the actual Lestrade that John almost could believe it was him. "Not that the Secret Police couldn't break any of us like a twig. But given where Sh'Alaack is going, we're moving our operations in case her identity isn't as solid as Ishros thinks."
Mollyhoo smiled awkwardly. "The children born that first year have… it's more complicated to figure out whose related to who than you might think."
It was annoying. Generally Hudson wasn't so self focused. Not when people around her were this close to giving into panic. "Do you have any idea what could have caused this?" Lucy felt desperate. Even the plants that she'd been holding had regressed to seedlings.
Connor nodded firmly. The world as he knew it taking shape. "Because Captain Holmes is going to make them regret taking us."
He struggled to help his mate get his knot inside him. To delightfully push against John's very, very good spot. Sending him through rounds of release.
She smiled at him. "We're all prodigals, John. The reason I told you so many stories about the Lady of the Flowers was to give you something to aspire to. To dream about." She held up her left hand. "The Lady of the Flowers. A wonderful name. Something that grew two generations after," she held up her right hand, "the Khans and their followers, who themselves were the result of experiments. I talked to Billy about his grandfather, who named himself Beowulf and took a Normal as a lover. Who was created by scientists who themselves were the products of untold generations of war. Beowulf didn't see himself as Grendel. Grendel's mother. Yet, he followed a flag that waged war that led to war. So many failures in imagination. Too few flowers." She shook her head and smiled sadly. "I think it's easy to be a saint in paradise, but it's also true that none of the victims were mine."
They beamed up to the cheery blue of Transporter Room Cloud and John had never been happier to see a place. They went to their quarters where John cooked a meal a good sight more comforting than algae cakes.
"There is always the first mother and their twin. His success shows we were right not to interfere."
The rest of the crew appeared to be startled as he walked briskly through the corridors in an item known as a speedo, but a significant number were disgruntled that it was not their day in the pool. Possibly a holographic pool as the Bakerstreet had a gym, but for the obvious reason of occasional loss of gravity, no standing bodies of water for the purpose of exercise.
Sarabeth kissed her and said, "Baby, don't borrow. We've got enough to worry about now." She put her hand on Mollyhoo's belly. "Plenty to worry about."
Sherlock nodded wearily. Tears leaking down his cheeks. He staggered towards Victor, who tried to crawl away. "No, it's not real. Yellowbeard, the Ice Queen has a spell on you." The twist and snap of his neck was real enough. The sound made her wince. It made her lose her grip on Sherlock's mind.
Finally, Sherlock said, "Let's go to the Transporter Room Cloud." John watched him return to his own age. He didn't even need shots to return to his preferred gender. The transporter took care of all that.
"That's right," said Papa Ishros. "Uzaveh and our ancestors blessed us when we boarded the Bakerstreet and so we had the four of you."
Sherlock's gasped, as he hadn't asked for the bath. Then with a surly toss of his inky waves of hair, he said, "They already cleaned me out for your pleasure," another toss, "sir."
Of course, Mummy reached for them. Of course. Tinker with their own children. Create a Euros. Craft Sherlock. Tinker with Mycroft's own genome. Attempt to reverse what damage the Breen had done to themselves long ago. Sacrifice what they were expected to sacrifice. All in attempt to capture what was trailed in front of them.
John's mum, ever a saint, took John by the arm. "Let's be off to the theater. It takes me longer and longer to put on my makeup every year."
"And are you ever going to tell Mummy who your parents are? Tell us anything about you?" asked Connor. "Why are you in Breen armor? Where would you get Breen ships? I've been studying them in school and they're a nasty race. They don't help anyone. Why would they help you?"
Sherlock said, "But they're operating inefficiently. If I modify the…ah." He stopped talking about warp cores when John opened his flies and gave him a blow job, and started talking about what John could do with his teeth and tongue, and then stopped talking after John deep throated him.
John reached across him to the trays on the tiled table. He fed Sherlock tiny delicacies. All of them something that Sherlock hadn't managed to hide that he'd enjoyed in the past, but reformatted to look like something else. Between every bite, John stole kisses. Tasting Sherlock's mouth. Nipping his chin. Biting his long neck as Sherlock whimpered, whispering to Sherlock, "I love pleasing you. Perhaps I'll purchase you. Own you. Keep you for my personal delight and spend my every day delighting the wonder that you are." One handed, he teased the labia beneath Sherlock's cock, while supporting himself over Sherlock with the other.
Monster. Another echo of Colonel Green. But Green was dead. Whoever Killander was, he was not Green.
What he sent Tadpole was more of a dirty drawing that had Tadpole gasping and looking at him in surprise.
"Nothing much to look at. Mutt. Genes from three of the old Khanates. Attractive enough, but getting too old to breed."
Marriage was a partnership. It was John and Sherlock binding themselves together in a serious way. Not able to just walk away.
"I would like to observe the dawn of the Andorian civilization," said Erickson bristling. She glared at Sherlock. "You know, the subject of my grant proposal. The reason we're here."
"You have been very quiet," said Sestre looking at Connor seriously. "Is it because of the abrupt nature of our field trip?"
Supersmart let go of the railing. Crouched down and grabbing the thing's feet. Lifting with seemingly impossible speed. He threw the creature at the monitor, which cracked at the blow.
"Don't see him down here. Don't see him ever coming down here what with me finding a Breen agent mucking around the refinery." The man wiped at the sweat with one hand. "He's done for."
"You'd better," said Donovan. "I don't much like the idea of being alone here with Commander Freak."
John took a careful step forward, when Hunter said, "Captain, the ion propulsion ship is stopping next to us."
They walked through ruined city in silence. Sh'Alaack was waiting with an impatient Doctor Erickson. "Captain, I was able to raise the Bakerstreet a few minutes after you left."
"I am not avoiding you," said Sherlock. "I'm working on a solution to this problem." Sherlock glaring at the metal. "Perhaps another metallurgical analysis." More than anything, he wished it had been him who had regressed to an earlier age. That it was him straddling John's lap in the evenings. Being held through his tears. Being smaller and more fragile than John for once. Not entirely fragile admittedly, as he'd still be him, and even at John's present age, Sherlock had been stronger than the majority of the adult Augment population on Earth.
Sherlock might not have swept him into an embrace in front of everyone, bending his face into his neck, pressed frantic kisses over John's face, while saying, "Missed you. Missed you. Missed you. Lost without you. I've been so lonely. Why did you go? I know why. You were angry with me. Stupid question. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. But you're here now. Never going to let you go." More velvet octopus squeeze. "I'll take such good care of you. How could you leave me? You knew how much I needed you."
Sherlock ignored him. "We would like to visit the Breen home world, the cave of the ancestors, while the first cave painters were active within the cave."
An unfamiliar voice said, "This is Rear Admiral Bennet. Captain Killander, in my office, in ten minutes."
Father Meiying felt that all these alignments should bow to their true superiority. Chin wondered sometimes if Father Meiying thought she was still running her Khanate in North America on Earth. Certainly, that came up often enough over meals.
Dad glanced at Mum, and at her nod, said, "I'll take her back to our quarters." He guided Harry out of the room.
It wasn't as if John had the clearance to get genetics samples from wherever it was that Khan Brittanus and the other Eugenics Era Augments were being held in cold storage.
John looked at the Andorians awkwardly. Hardly even sure what to say. With memories came the knowledge of everything that had happened. Everything he'd have to deal with.
John shook as Harry squeezed his shoulder and whispered, "I'm sorry." Harry was crying as he plucked the communicator from John's chest and put it on his own.
It was delicious at midnight. Each taste a delight on Sherlock's tongue. Chewed with his teeth. Swallowed down his throat. Fueled him while he fed kisses between John's lips.
Mollyhoo darted over to the knife on the ground. She looked around the cave to where the last few omegas to still be expressing an active estrus cycle were moving restlessly. This round triggered based on the alpha pheromones in the chamber and aroused by the fight, but not ready to make a move. She ran the stone knife across the flame and sliced Ayaba's arm, repeated the steps with Fasha while Ayaba was still protesting. Mollyhoo said, "It's important before one of you, and only one of you, has sex with Sherlock," and they both quieted.
John felt something soft and twisty at his heart at the thought. He stroked Sherlock's hair. "Sherlock make babies with you. Yes."
Except, he knew somewhere in the bar, Sherlock was probably watching him. He was wanted. But this couldn't possibly be fair to Sherlock.
As to condoms, if John managed to have such a thing while being captured on a planet that had developed a parallel Roman civilization where the inhabitants made them compete in gladiatorial games, until the day John's suppressors wore off, suffice to say the condoms didn't survive. He had an idea why when he experimented with more samples. Aggressive sperm attaching to the synthetic layers and burrowing against it until it burst.
Sherlock gave her a sharp look, because if they were allowing an adult alpha out of the pit with the plan to take it into the nest, they were possibly too stupid to live.
Hudson called up the mission specs on the monitor. John clutched his coffee and tried to sit as if he and Sherlock hadn't finished having sex fifteen minutes before the briefing.
Namely, the more sex John had with Sherlock, the more reproductively successful John was, by a certain definition of the term, successful.
"What do you care?" She drew herself up to their jointly average height, but in presence she was full on Medea. "Last thing we had in common was when we were in Mum's womb. Even then we were splitting. You're sinister and I'm right. I came out first and then after that, everything has always been about you."
John said, "I'll head down with you. I need to go to sickbay. See what Moriarty did to Julian, and start checking on the crew."
She suffered through listening to John talk about helping Lethe and the others. She wanted him to only focus on her and her pain. But that ship had left space port long ago.
"I'm not paying you for honor. I'm paying your for muscle," said the daimon. "Ah, I have it. Nom you watch the children, while the Klingons I'm paying to do as I say take the omega over to Profit's Aspiration and the Andorian to the planet."
Bihr did not want to say that their captain was clearly in the grip of some sort of mating frenzy and had one thought on his mind and it was not related to spatial anomalies and their effect on soft tissue. She was aware that this was something of a sore spot for Lucy, who believed that Doctor Watson should stay well away from the captain.
John snorted, because that was just typical. While Brittanus wouldn't be solving any problems other than decomposition, the Khans had quite spectacularly resolved the Breen's central problem by out sourcing the solution to Earth's Augments and then just as spectacularly failed to admit what that solution meant.
She thought about contacting Sestre or Connor to give her ideas, but really she didn't need anymore ideas. Her dad was fine. He was fine.
Sarabeth and Mollyhoo sat down next to them dangling bare legs into the water. Mollyhoo sighed as she sat down. Looked everywhere but at them. She and Sarabeth didn't say anything for a long time, so John ignored them. Kissing Sherlock was more interesting.
John, who Sherlock had… who was… so very… clearly his reproductive system… the number John had told Sherlock was… that number of young couldn't possibly survive, but he had a new appreciation for Mummy's contempt for the scientists who had created them. Wished all the more that he had been the one whose age had been regressed. That perhaps if they discussed it, perhaps John, if it had been Sherlock, but it hadn't.
Until that moment, she had been certain she was experiencing pseudo-pregnancy symptoms. Obviously, John didn't mean actual magic and she wished she'd thought to ask John and Sherlock for more information about Sherlock's biology before they'd gone into a limited level of verbal acuity. Then again, "Magic cock," was certainly evocative.
John didn't give him a chance to say more about how it felt. Peppered kisses and praise on Sherlock as he moved. Was rewarded by legs wrapping around his hips. Then curling up along his chest. Then wrapped around his neck.
He watched a sandstorm swallow the town. A wall of sand consuming everything for kilometers. Nothing to see but whirls of sand at the window. It was irrational to feel trapped. The windows were excellent.
"You mean people don't like being kidnapped and turned into baby donors you mean," said Connor hotly. "Having their ability to choose where they want to live taken from them. Being told who to mix their genes with in a machine."
Redbeard screamed. The feradon took the time to roar a response, which was its mistake. Redbeard snapped off its right tusk and killed it with it. A single stab to the heart and it was dead.
Although, the number was John's contribution. A genetic pre-disposition for high order magnitude pregnancies and a Normal Human average immune system, supplemented by magical healing cock.
"Ooooh, that means Amazing Sparkles here is a thief," said Prince Sparkles. "While I am definitely the Captain. Sitting in this couch is comfortably familiar."
Really, it was only the fact that Sherlock was distracted by thoughts of John, of all that they'd discussed, of what John was going to go do, that he perhaps when John was himself again they might discuss the possibility of perhaps intentionally reproducing, that as he emerged from the Jeffries tube onto the bridge, a Ferengi fired a blast that had Sherlock falling to the floor, unconscious.
Even as they turned options and possibilities over in their mind. There were too many options. Possibilities. Too random to ensure. Seeing as it would require three rival tigers to lay down together in harmony. Khans. Tigers. Yet with the three of them, with a version of their child returned to them, they might accomplish much.
He was incapable to resist nuzzling the golden god's delicious neck above pale teeth marks from some form of attack or ritual. The omega asked, "What are you doing?"
Sherlock had a harder time of it. After yet another omega looked at Sherlock with incredulity and then checked with John to see if what Sherlock was saying was correct, Sarabeth said, "Oh, for fuck's sake. It's 5019," rolled her eyes at Mollyhoo's snort, "you know what I mean. Those kinds of outdated ideas should be retired with the buggy whip." Which had more than a few muttering they wished they were advanced enough to have buggy whips. Sarabeth tried again. "There were plenty of alphas in my artists collective."
John moved closer to Sherlock, not entirely because of Sherlock's intoxicatingly sultry vanilla and honey scent. "Well?"
"Sir," said the holographic pimp bowing ridiculously low, "what an honor to have you in my humble establishment." He waved up at paintings over a row of small cubicles. "These indicate the specialties of each of my slaves." The paintings depicted two and three figures involved in variations of fellatio, intercural, vaginal, and anal. The teens below each sign smiled at John eagerly. They looked completely uninteresting to John, while Sherlock shone like a fair nymph. Seriously, beyond being beautiful, the brilliance of the way Sherlock had lit the scene deserved an award.
His breathe caught and he did as commanded. He reached up, gripping the slats of the headboard over his head. Tilted up his hips in a hopeful invitation. Which was accepted.
She didn't mean to do what she did next. She seared the crumbling bits. She seared them all away. Sherlock fell to the ground, shuddering, twitching, but at least he wasn't screaming any more.
His son looking at him earnest and so very vulnerable. Fragile. The echoes of the day Colonel Green's men came and took him from Billy, screaming were still ringing in Billy's ears.
Sherlock nodded absently as Hudson read the news at the morning briefing. Any gaps in reports were there for a reason. Commendations would require fewer classified missions.
"As if traveling in a dekyon storm could cause quantum fractures of that size!" said a Breen in white piped armor. "The energy alone…"
A genome-wide association study (GWAS) is when researchers look at aggregated data (not 1 person, lots of people) and drill down on the correlation between # with a certain set of SNPs who confirm they do or don't have a trait (phenotype).
"If I'd killed him before, this wouldn't be happening." Tears streamed down Sh'Alaack's face. "The ambassador would be alive. What's my purpose for surviving if not to prevent this?"
"I am… as you say… up with doing what must be done," said Sh'Alaack about as convincingly as her son Shor had been when he claimed that he hadn't been messing around with the gravity in the cargo bay when he came in with a broken arm, but John pretended to be convinced.
Grandfather's heartbeat was steady. His smile calm, but there was something off. "In due time, the Augments here will be given the option to be released. Our current plan has not reaped the increase in our population as we'd hoped." He looked at Connor. "When you do start school, you'll be meeting the children of those accepted a life here. As well as children of first generation Augments." His eyebrows quirked. "Four of them ranging from eight to seventeen." He tilted his head. "All the children the first generation of the 23rd Alignment has had in the last twenty years."
The holographic students were already there. They looked at John sympathetically. It was part of the scenario that the potions professor always picked on the plucky boy from Gryffindor, because Professor Holmes was resisting his desire for the boy from Gryffindor and this was the day when the master decided that he'd secretly claim what he wanted with magic.
Sherlock had been hoping that he was going to impale the alpha with it, but to Sherlock's disgust, he lowered the pole into the pit and called out. "Come on, Marymor. Come on out of there."
He weighed the cost of a wasted few hours search versus his longing. The benefit and cost if he directed John to one of the rooms where Sherlock had limbs of a sort.
"Marry me." Sherlock wasn't sure who had said the words at first, but it would seem that it was him. Then all the reasons this was an incredibly logical thing to do rushed out. "You could remain on the Bakerstreet. As a Captain, they made me captain of the Bakerstreet, I should have said that before, but I have discretion over the assignment of inactive status personnel to fulfill vital roles. Medicine is a vital role. You're a trained Starfleet doctor. You're valuable. You don't have to marry me. I could just appoint you as the ship's doctor, but you should. It's not uncommon for ship's captains to be married to the ship's doctor provided there isn't an issue with chain of command." Sherlock had been doing research. He didn't want to look away to gather it up from his memory palace.
They ignored each other in the quiet gym. Until Hunter ran in, drenched in sweat and wearing jogging clothes, with Julian, who for some reason had altered his program to look as if he too had working sweat ducts.
John tried to glare at Sherlock, because at the moment, he couldn't help but think that this was Sherlock and his magic fucking cock's fault, because fair was something he didn't feel he needed to be when being invaded. "It wouldn't. If it were just one."
Sherlock sprawled back in his seat. Feeling reckless with so much to lose. Attack. Attack. Attack. "You've caught me. I am Khan Brittanus. My diabolically evil plan was to join Starfleet, spend years at research facilities focusing on exobiology, write reports on how to defeat the Borg, have my work ignored, be consigned to teaching, go on my own recognizance to stop the Borg from assimilating Earth, and be given the command of a hastily built exploratory vessel. How horrible my plans to seek out new life and new civilizations have been foiled by an intelligence agency with poor record keeping."
"We solved a case that had Section 31 accusing an entire segment of Federation citizens based on their genetics. I've already contacted Sisko," was the constable's reply.
Inside the villa were some equally interesting wall murals. Goat legged satyrs with immense cocks fucking dryads still half merged with their trees. Zeus in the form of a swan getting it on with a delighted looking Leda. A manticore buggering a yowling sphinx and the like.
"You should listen to Julian," said Hudson. "There were extensive studies done by Colonel Green's scientists during WWIII on the effects of pheromones and hormones on Augment adolescents, as well as other things."
"Yeah, and Hudson just flew up on a Breen shuttle wearing Breen armor." Donovan frowned. "Seems she thinks we should have a party down on Bencia to celebrate everyone saving themselves."
But she'd needed to see where Harry Watson would be sent once her treatment was complete. She'd needed to feel the air around her antennae and see the facility for herself.
The entire crew knew what was going on. Hadn't made too much of a fuss about a captain who commanded from their quarters. It wasn't as if survey missions required much commanding. Thankfully there were no more dramatic grabby hands in space.
"Oh, but they're so sexy," said Moriarty and received a thwap from Mama G in response. "Oh, Mama, spank me."
Growing up, John's mum and dad had never done more simple design work for various plays. He sighed, thinking of his dad. Years later, the pain was more of a dull ache than a sharp wound. He wondered if he regressed, if that too would be part of him that he lost.
Martha wasn't quite ready to consider herself "ex" and "had been." She wasn't ready to consider forty years of her life over. Wiped away merely because she was over the optimal age her superiors had considered viable.
He could hear the other omegas. They didn't know he could hear them. They talked about what they'd need to do if John died.
She was the mother of an eleven year old, who she may possibly have falsified records so Starfleet thought she'd been born and rapidly aged in one of anomalies they'd encountered over the years. A child did not belong on a warship. Therefore Lucy could not be reassigned on a warship.
John said, "The other John didn't do an end run. He saw it through each time. Which overall were far fewer times than I have gone through. A lot fewer times. Although, it's likely that even his productivity at getting," he cleared his throat, "pregnant will taper off quite soon. While except for the one time in the," he cleared his throat again, "in the Breen past, I haven't gone to term. I've looked at my med scans. Really looked at them. After that time, there was considerable genetic transfer and then another pregnancy that um… I stopped at five weeks, which is um… the last time there was successful implantation."
"I know the lines of code and their comments, but I don't have access to the thinking behind why certain decisions were made. As it stands so many people had a role in making me, changing my code over the years," he shrugged, "it would be impossible to say at this point."
The replicators in the play room were down with the rest of the lockdown. So there was no way to replicate a spanner or any other device to get them out. For whatever reason, the Ferengi didn't realize that at least half the toys in the play room had fully functioning computers in them. Also, there were the toys John had arrived with. The dildos and cock sheath were surprisingly useful given they had internal sources of power and receivers for the transmitter in the wand, which according to Hudson was the real prize.
Supersmart examined Moriarty's face looking for a further clues, when something entirely unexpected happened. Mama G clocked Moriarty in the back of the head hard with the flute club. Hard enough to make a loud thud. Moriarty's head briefly glowed orange and shivered. His entire body melted and shifted until instead of facing the instruments, he was now facing Mama G. "You really shouldn't have done that."
Sherlock went to where John was. John laughed and took him in his arms. He wrapped his own arms around John. Whispered, "Love you. Love you. Love you." He wanted to say what was important while he still had the words.
"I think it's amusing that the organization responsible for intelligence gathering did not notice something that occurred years ago."
No surprise. Sherlock had been going non-stop at the Exo-Genetics conference on Andor for the last week. He'd wanted to drag John to every panel, and join Sherlock visiting various cutting edge research facilities solving the mysteries of science, but as John had had to remind his great git several times, John had his own career and interests.
Sherlock grinned because this had been a fairly perfect birthday, but really all it had lacked was this. Sherlock threw on his silk himation and ran for the bridge. Past crew heading to their stations, John close behind him in his tunic.
Sherlock looked around quickly. The scent of the dead alphas was strong. There needed to be less dead alpha in their cave. Sherlock picked up the ankles of both. Sherlock carried the bodies out of the cave, dragged them up the valley, and threw them over the wall at the top of the valley as a warning.
His mum sighed. "Sweetheart, your father joined a travelling theater troop that encountered hundreds of thousands of people over decades. Put his face on advertisements plastered on hundreds of worlds. If he wanted to hide, he could have swept floors in some remote colony where no one goes. When we met, I thought he was running from something painful, but now knowing, I wonder what if he wanted to caught. I don't know what friend helped him on the Enterprise, but what if they wanted to absolve that life out of pity and all he wanted was to be called to account. Heavy is the head that wears the crown. What if I had simply asked him while we were on the Bakerstreeet? After that Andorian woman was injured?" Her left hand, the one that always reached for Dad's curled around her tea cup. "Would he be sitting next to me now? Playwright, write that."
John wasn't sure he was up to this. To whatever he'd find. He took those emotions and buried them. Soldiered up and kept on. Crawled and climbed his way to the highest point in the ice canyon and into a valley that was achingly familiar beyond.
At times it had seemed like the entire weight of the Breen Confederacy had been narrowed to a point working to help his son. Researchers. Doctors. Laboratories.
As he sat in the Admiralty briefing, it was more than a bit worrying that the third years would be following them in six months. Although, Recruitment's plan to drop the bar for entry into the Academy and offering one year officer training to anyone with an advanced degree made a certain sense.
Killander glared around the room. "We need the Breen pried out of Federation space. Every one of our colony's in Federation hands. That's why I made sure we only interfered with non-critical systems." His hands were wrapped around the cup with the stars. The gentlemen did so love the cup with the stars. Although, really as long as they took any cup other than the one with the lilies it was all fine.
He looked at the rings on his left hand. They were both gold engraved with the image of a sort of masked face. One was laughing comically. The other ring showed a sorrowful tragic face. He hoped that didn't mean there was some sort of tragedy in his past. To distract himself and for yet another excuse to touch the alpha, still looking dazedly at him, he examined the alpha's ring. There was a sort of helix engraved around the top.
"Follow you, Master," he laid one hand on John's left knee, rubbing his thumb along the inside of John's leg. "Because I belong to you." He moved between John's legs.
"But the way you reacted to the news about your father. What he'd done." Sherlock looked genuinely confused. His normal people confuse me look, which John did find adorable when it crossed Sherlock's face. So he couldn't resist kissing Sherlock.
He sighed. Anytime a joke had to be explained, it was a dead joke. Unless Sestre was there and somehow that made it triple funny.
Too late, because while they had been blowing up the artificial intelligence, forces from the Dominion-Cardassian alliance seized control of DS9.
She sprinted between towering blue cliffs. Clawed her way up sheer green ice walls when the way twisted in on itself and into the howling winds. Dropped back down into the sheltered canyons when a way opened up again.
As soon as Sherlock started speaking, John sat up. He leaned forward. His blond hair falling charmingly forward. At Sherlock's first pause for breath, John clearly whispered, "Amazing." All around him, the murmur of the crowd was of full of excitement and approbation.
While he was away, Harry grew out her hair. Put on a silver ring. Threw the gold one at John when he announced he wasn't joining the theater company. That his dream of joining Starfleet and becoming a doctor was real.
What was important was an intruder was talking with his voice in his body. "It's good of you to gather here. To stand in the solidarity of grief with me, your captain, Sherlock Holmes. My husband was a fine man. Handsome if you're into that sort of thing."
Supersmart ripped the railing off the banister, and jumped at Moriarty with it aimed like a spear. While John rolled for the panel. The thing absorbed the wooden railing and rippled when John slammed the broadside of a panel against its flank. Mama G jabbed with the flute-club to the same effect.
John pulled his pack back on and stood up. Over a decade in and he was finally going to meet Sherlock's parents. Hopefully not before they sliced him up to see how he ticked. "I should mention that it was only temporary and had a hundred percent side effect that anyone exposed will explode if it's not reversed. But it does mean that my brain is," he waved his hand at his head, "a little squirrely against psychics."
When he got up, he saw the orange sky of Ligos VII through a fissure straight above. Donovan, Cho, and Washington came around the corner. Donovan said, "The explosion didn't disrupt the force shield by the entrance."
"I don't know what you're talking about," said Mollyhoo, "But if you came through a temple, I have to ask, were you prepared before they sent you back? I don't mean… hey they gave you a chat, but did they give you a shot of the Cromatium to offset the effects of the time dilation from going through the portal. I mean, I could have done without the doctor who prepared me going about how I was going to be gang raped by the alphas trying and failing to breed me. As if we were feral cats to be released spayed, but not neutered." She took a left turn down a path that led up a narrow ravine. "I need to know if you were prepared. Time dilation affects adrenal and testosterone production, and builds plaque in the temporal lobe and the neural connections with the amygdala.
"What kind of ship is that?" asked Eva. She had looked up the statistics on the Cortez when Dad had been assigned there.
It took Lucy a moment to process that he meant Hunter. She'd seen Julian and Hunter jogging together and at social functions. It was a small ship. Eventually everyone was in everyone's space, and she knew theoretically that they were together, but she hadn't really thought about it much. "I'm sure she is. I'm sure all of them are. After all, they have Sherlock with them."
The boarding party had been led by Humans in Section 31 Starfleet uniforms. His own phaser had fallen from nerveless fingers as a blast took him from the side. A familiar voice had said, "Careful, we need to question them."
"I... my parents hollowed a space on the larger moon. Under the Mare of Acquisition. Built a sort of palace using holographic emitters." John remembered Sherlock's Mind Palace and had to wonder if it was a replica of where Sherlock had grown up. "That's where my first memories begin. I always thought it was because they thought something was wrong with me. After our encounter with Euros, the brain damage we discovered appeared to confirm that there was. That they were always pushing me, always training me because they wanted to fix me. I discovered," he looked down his lashes covering eyes that looked as green as a troubled sea, swallowed, "Mummy knew. They pushed and pushed because they wanted me to come back. Unlike Mycroft. The first one."
"Stop that," said Julian. "We need to keep the body that you are in healthy and to do that we need to treat your celebrium poisoning."
Sherlock did not want his pace slowed down by a centenarian determined to defeat a dead man, but when he expressed this, Finney said, "I been there near a hundred years. There's nothing I don't know about getting in and out of that place. If you're depending on what Starfleet knows," he spat on the floor, "may as well just shoot yourself with your phaser right now."
Hmm... possibly this counts as tentacle porn. Not that Sherlock has tentacles, but industrial machinery is used for purposes that were not their original intention.
She climbed up into the gallery where the best preserved cave paintings were. The rest of the year, the entire site was protected by a force field. This was the only day when Breen were allowed into the cave. The only time in a Breen's life when they came to this place. As far as Chin was concerned, the Breen were a little too obsessed with genealogy.
Killander smiled coldly. "There's nothing the JAG office will be able to do." He glared at John. "You've haven't been ordered to come with us."
"We are storing many of you disgusting creatures. My cousin thinks you can be of use, but I say you are a waste of resources."
Other times, of course, John couldn't take another moment of slow stroking, pretending to be asleep. In those cases, he rolled over. Inhaled his husband's mouth with his own. While scrabbling one handed for the lube in the head board. Sometimes his husband helped by rolling over to present his plump arse, which his clever husband had already helpfully stretched with a vaginal or anal plug. John would pull the red or blue or green thing out. Slicked himself up and slid right into nicely loosened flesh. Listened to his husband yell his name while John made love to his hot, slick, tight body. Until John found the right angle. Then his husband was incapable of speech. Groaning his release. Sometimes John came inside him. Sometimes he pulled out and came on his back. Either way, he got a cotton cloth from the replicator and lovingly cleaned his husband off.
Sherlock hated to say what he said next. "I can contact my brother about your situation. There is… that is there may be… somewhere you can go."
Acheron blinked at her. Air howled through the pipe system over her head. Sounding almost like a distant animal's howl. Which given it wasn't logged as an air duct made the hair on the back of her neck prickle.
"Although your mother and your siblings have grown unfamiliar to you through lack of proximity, this will give you an opportunity to become known to them."
Sisko leaned forward. "Sites containing hazardous materials, such as the contents of cryo chambers, are required to be audited for safety at least annually. When was the last audit?"
Sherlock said in as low a voice as he could manage, "Please, Master, I've been so very good." Turned his hips to face John. Sliding the silk away. "Please, Master. May I be fucked by your… cock?" Moved his arms over his head, loving the feeling of the silk. "I'm all for you."
Sh'Alaack said, "Thank you for agreeing to monitor the new crew's activities." Which fair, maybe he should have led with that. Tue, Khatri and Lui as science personnel weren't in Engineering, but they did at least have a fair understanding of how the ship worked.
But he wouldn't. John just wanted to be fucked by his husband and he wouldn't. He was nearly thirty years old for Christ's sake! It wasn’t fair!
After all, Sherlock's first memory was being told he had murdered his sister, Chin Singh, and killed his brother Victorious. That he'd been put in cryo for five years for his crimes.
He peed blood once or twice. He knew Sherlock could scent it. But there was nothing they could do, but make love. Heal what they could. Wait.
"Mum, you've seen me since I got my diploma." An awkward hell visit just after Harry's breakup with Clara with Harry sending increasingly angry barbs John's way. She couldn't seem to let go that he'd been the twin with problems in their teens, and now things were reversing. It was hardly his fault that she was torpedoing her relationships, and if she wanted more than the theater, that was up to her.
"You seem…" Donovan shook her head, "Fuck it. Let's get these arseholes out of here." She and Soo-Lin herded the miners out of the chamber.
Not-Lestrade led him back out of the cave system and into the equally underground complex of an Andorian city.
She reached out and picked up a picture of John's parents at one side of his desk. He'd taken down so many pictures in his quarters, but he'd hardly been in his office since everything that had happened had happened.
Grendel smiled kindly. "They want nothing with you, my child. Only I long to know what became of my children. To know my grandchild. No," he shifted his gaze to John with familiar blue eyes, must be where mum's family got them from, "having identified one John Watson based on it would seem a very specific genetic template, which has me wondering why they were looking for it, the other alignments wish him to remain." He shrugged. "No matter. I am not privy to the plans of Khans. But under the circumstances, perhaps it's for the best if you make a daring escape on my fastest ship." There was a crinkle to his smile that John did not want to find charming. "You will, of course, be kidnapping me to achieve this." He reached over to a table and pulled out a small device, which he tossed to John. "Please use this rather than the disrupter you're clutching.
She tried to decide what it meant that he was using a middle name as his given name. What did the choice of the patronymic Holmes mean? What did his choice of a life in Starfleet signify? What did any of it mean?
Since Connor's juvenile heat syndrome had burst into sudden bloom a few weeks after they'd arrived, Billy's life had revolved around caring for Connor.
The door opened on a room decorated in soothing blues and greens. John didn't see Harry. "Um… how does this work? Is there a special room where I talk with Harry?"
He looked back at her. "Yeah, I have. What grandfather is doing, what they're all doing is wrong. I don't know if I can convince them of that, but I certainly can't do it from the Bakerstreet, and I have to do something. But what about Connor's treatment? What if John finds something out?"
"Except," Chin sighed, "that. Now that you know, you need to stay. But any Augments that are brought here are being returned to their families. We free the Augment Inferior from the shackles of a society that doesn't trust them. Arrests them without provocation. Holds them back."
"I had piano lessons as a kid, but," he hastened to add, "I was terrible. I'm also terrible on the clarinet." He wouldn't go into that every time he'd put the clarinet in his mouth as a teen, he'd been unable to think about anything but other things between his lips, which had resulted in more wanking than practice.
Euros looked at the Augment very seriously and said, "I want to finish hearing the story." Then rather ominously. "No one else is wearing armor."
"As I said, it's in all our best interests if he's returned to the prince," said Owen. "You were assigned inferior reclamation duty after… your fall from grace. Stay off the ketry and find the Prince's pet before he has the Executioner fire up the anti-matter chambers for all of us."
After the first dozen jubilant kisses, Donovan had suggested that they get a room, which since Sherlock had a ready room right there, they'd retreated to it.
"Then for my pleasure, you'll bathe again," said John, who was more than happy to take off both the toga and tunic, and sink into a raised metal tub heated by a small wood burning oven. It overlooked both the foam flecked sea below and, of course, the smoking volcano.
"But it's not fair to him. He's not in love with me. He certainly doesn't care…" he unlocked the cage of his thoughts a little. "He doesn't love me in the same way I love him."
But when she found herself looking at a duplicate of Shroleb, Sh'Alaack's bondmate, short of shooting him, there was no way to stop him from saying, "I know where the prince's pet is. An old acquaintance came to get him yesterday. If I tell you where they are, will you let us go?" He was holding a thin little girl. Could be his. Might not be. Scanner indicated the kid was a shen, and should be apprehended to take to the palace. Course, as Legless had told her on day one, her only priority was rounding up omegas.
Pavan said, "My Alignment," the was emphasized as they looked around the room, "believes that Sarpeidon," they spat on the floor, "succeeded in causing a temporal distortion, but not on the planetary level." They brought up a map. There were two location pinpointed. "These cave paintings were drawn in cave systems fifty miles apart."
It was catching, Lucy was feeling pretty subdued too. She hadn't seen her daughter in weeks while she'd been on Marilac, and now that she was back, she still wasn't able to be her mother.
"Oh," said Mollyhoo. "That's very clever." She went on to explain in words that John was losing something about how the water in the air could change the temperature of the area around it.
Alexis waited for Apollo to return inside the temple. He appeared in a flash. "My love, I have admonished Dionysus to keep their revels down so as not to disturb our rest."
"And 218. Sometimes what you get free costs entirely too much." The first Ferengi turned the force field off and shoved John in the room. "You can help watch the younger ones."
John licked and sucked simply focusing on the tube of meat in his mouth. Just a tube of meat. Until he had it right how he wanted it. Engorged with blood. He slid forward slightly. Bobbying his head. Raising his hands to rake them along Victor's thighs. Taking advantage of the motions to slip his fingers inside his collar, which was the moment of truth, but Victor didn't react. Apparently, even the most observant of people didn't notice everything while being fellated. He slid the laser onto his index finger. The operational control was fairly simply. An L-shaped switch. He felt it rather than saw it turn on. A faint heat on the tip of his finger.
Sherlock slowly slid John out of his clothes. Peeling them off as if removing an old skin that John didn't need. As if John were infinitely fragile. He was less careful about his own disrobing.
The environment shifted again. They were in a hotel room. Sherlock was sitting on the edge of a bed half dressed. John was pulling a silk handkerchief out of his breast pocket. "Have you ever gone to a hotel room with a stranger?"
John wasn't entirely certain that bringing a phaser – even if only a type 1 phaser – was at all within the rules, which was why he'd replicated trousers with a hidden pocket on the small of his back. He pulled it out and waved it. "I'm surprised you couldn't deduce it was there."
She felt like she was losing an arm. A leg. A love. With the transfer off the Bakerstreet even if they survived the war, there was zero to no chance she'd ever get back on board.
The omega licked their lips. "Yeah." Dragged their hot blue eyes over his body. He felt every moment of the gaze. That golden seraphim said, "Maybe we should… kiss. See if it feels familiar."
Dax said, "Relax, old man. It's not historically accurate. The point is to have fun. And," she glanced at Sherlock, "compare descriptions of the various plays we did. I got to help two lovers who didn't know how to tell each other that they loved each other and just needed a little push."
Bihr knelt down next to Shrilaas. "My heart, the Dominion do not respect civilian targets. You don't want me to worry about you while I'm building ships do you?"
They spent a tedious hour while Erickson and his team went back in time on Andor, while Sh'Alaack recorded the history flickering in the center of the Guardian's time portal.
"The Prophets," John had never heard Benjamin call them anything other than wormhole entities, "ensured that my biological mother and father would meet, and that I would be born. That I would be their Emissary. To the point of a Prophet taking over the mind and body of an innocent woman. That Prophet pretended that she was falling in love with my father, married him, waited until a year after I was born, then they released her. She must have been terrified and confused as to what had happened." Benjamin sighed. John sighed with him. "It's difficult not to want to assume responsibility." He turned his cup in his hands. "For things neither of us had any control over."
Sherlock's eyes snapped open. Aware that he'd already failed, but since John was laughing, his failure was not apparently cause for John to leave.
Maybe it had been when they'd sent away spit to get their DNA results from a dodgy clinic on the moon.
"Then why did you come in?" asked Sherlock sharply, before saying, "Ah, you have not been able to find Moriarty."
John raised his glass. "My parents raised me in the theater, and I know who created plays." Dionysus filled in more and more as John continued speaking. Filling in completely as John dashed a little wine on the ground. "To Dionysus, who created the first plays and in whose honor each play is held." Around them, he saw some of the others dashing wine to the ground.
Billy didn't let his hand dart up to the communications device. He didn't betray that it was there. He worried as they were transported, but the Klingons didn't pay any attention to it when they were beamed over to the Klingon bird of prey. Didn't look at it when they were shoved into a holding cell.
Sherlock breathing rate increased. Harshened. He cleared his throat. "So, very hot. The kind of heat with only one cure." The naughty Sugar Baby curled up inside the mass interphasic transomater. He said, 'Daddy, I'm sick. Please, Daddy, I need a little prick of medicine,' and he rubbed his little sugar bum all over the inside of that machine."
"He's ready," said Sherlock, pushing the device on his chest off. He took that he could do even that to be a sign that that this body's health was increasing.
John eyed the rags in a neat pile on the table. While clothing was occasionally useful for concealing weapons, he found no need for them now. Clothing would only interfere with the only course left to him.
When they docked at Starbase 305, Sherlock pulled the box out from under their bed. He held it out to John and said, "Take it." He glared at the wood surface. "This is your promise you're coming back."
And wasn't that a delight learning that his ex had been tapped to run the Second Fleet's MASH units, but given the options it did make a certain amount of sense.
The long silence that followed was broken by a chirp from a communication device. Grendel listened into it. He pursed his lips. "I have a somewhat tangential question," said Grendel. His expression was thoughtful. "John, why were you on the shuttle? I have heard Princess Chin speak at length about her hope that Billy would arrive as he'd promised. But there was no mention that you would be coming as well."
"We're on a ship that is about to be in a lot of trouble when Sherlock finds it," said John succinctly.
"So, what are you trying to tell me? Ask me?" As with most conversations with Trelane, John was feeling exhausted and he'd just gotten up. Really he should have just stayed in bed.
"Milady," said a computerized voice from within the armor. "Of course, the omega can finish the story. But perhaps in a more comfortable location."
He played it in sickbay while John calculated the amount of immune suppressant shot to give him given his biology.
Supersmart abandoned the conversation to attempt to open the door to what the schematics IDed as the Captain's Ready Room.
While others, must trade upon their appearances to make their way. Sherlock's role. A dewy slip of eye candy on John's arm wearing absurdly high heels as they swept into the party. That he had the holodeck smooth his face to make him appear ten years younger was a delicious conceit. He towered over John and it didn't matter.
The pimp in his flamboyant stripped green toga said, "An unconvincing liar. As I was saying, the boy is new, both to slavery and his new trade. He has yet to be… broken to a specialty." The pimp wiped sweat from beneath his thin strands of hair. "Normally, I wouldn't have put him out, but overwhelmed by the honor that comes of your visit, I wanted to give you every choice."
Billy made a small noise that sounded a bit like a kettle getting ready to blow. What squeaked out was, "More secrets."
The crewman didn't have any weapons, but he did have a belt. John tied him up with it and jammed a sock in his mouth while he was at it. Between them, they shoved him in the toilet and closed the door. It wouldn't hold anyone for more than a moment, but sometimes that was all it took.
John groaned. "Ugh don't remind me. He kept pinging me a few years ago." They talked about people they knew. They got to know each other a bit.
Mama G said, "Connor, that kind of language calls for a timeout I think. Let's go to the ready room." Connor grumbled, but followed Mama G, who soon returned holding the flute-club over one shoulder. "Now stay in there, Connor."
"These could work, sir, but…" he turned the tablet to one side, "I'm going to need engineers familiar with the design." He tilted the tablet the other way. "I think some of this is implying non-Euclidean math for this engine upgrade."
Sherlock's com went off. John's voice wailed out of it. "Sh…Sh…Sher…Sherlock! I…" and cut off. Sherlock immediately ran out of the room.
Connor couldn't help it. He laughed. It was just so ridiculous to get so focused on such distant relationships when was important was how people were. Eva wasn't more his friend than Sestre just because she was an Augment. Wiglaf wasn't closer to him than Thil or Shor. Thil had even sent him a template for a grappling hook that their Aunt Harry had sent them, who technically speaking wasn't anyone's aunt.
The only thing that had kept Sherlock going at all was the thought that maybe, just perhaps John was headed to the Guardian of Forever. That this was the moment he'd known, hoped, fondly imagined many times. Not under these circumstances. Never these. He hadn't sent a ship to find out. Searched everywhere else for the negation.
Found out that Sh'Alaack had returned with her family, but decided that there were some conversations that could wait.
John said, "Harry! She'd not your sister. Those memories are a construct. Something Adams put in your head."
. He remembered who he was. He understood that his sister had been killed and that it was Euros' fault. Euros and Sherlock's.
They appeared to come to life as she came into the space. Humming and whirring. A mild echo of the howls that echoed throughout the spaces above her. Around them, the wavering red lights rippled. "There are wave emissions that are…" her antennae twitched, "interfering with my readings."
“You stated, and as I answered, Commander Holmes has the clearly defined right as stated in the Sixth Amendment to the Federation Constitution to legal counsel, which currently would be Odo and myself. He has the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation. Which is having something to do with the disappearance of Khan Brittanus and his followers from Starfleet custody.”
Chin listened curiously wondering how Hobb would chose to characterize the Federation's basic capacity problem. Even seven years after the Borg attack on Earth, it was evident to anyone who studied the patterns that the Federation had prioritized, understandably enough, getting Starfleet capacity up over refitting aging colonies that no longer had a true purpose given that much of their production could be replaced with replicators. There were some minerals that still had be mined, but nothing on this world.
"You should. Only thing good I did in my life was Jame." He patted the device with the side of a foot. "And I suppose this."
John didn't so much fall unconscious from the stun that hit him as fell into a sort of dazed slump. He felt himself picked up as if it was happening through layers of thirty layers of cotton. He was eventually dumped on a sort of lounging bed. Wherever he was, it was a pleasure craft. He sank into the cushions. Velvet plush under his fingers. Rich colors rioting in front of his blinking eyes. Scents of leather and ambergris twisting on beams of light from the latticed lanterns. A rising headache.
It would seem that the godling was most pleased to rock the giant clam shell with the force of their motion grappling, moving, driving against each other. Cocks moving slickly between thighs. But John supposed that's what the humpbacked whales that came to steady the shell were for. As Sherlock knotted inside him, he felt the tingle that meant that his godling was healing John of all his ills with his magic cock, which had John giggling through his release.
"I saw," said Lucy. Martha really didn't want to have to leave Lucy alone with the children, but really, Lucy did not have experience infiltrating enemy bases, and Martha did. It was as simple as that.
Sherlock said, "I've traced her route back through the cameras. I have it. Level 75, room 101. It's one of the candidate rooms. But you'll be going in dark. I have no cameras in that room. We need that teaching device."
By which time, Sh'Alaack's bondmates with glares for her, arrived to sweep Sh'Alaack and the children away.
She kept calling even as she flung visions at Victor. Even as she threw a rock at him to get him off of Sherlock. Kept the sound of the feradon's approach out of Victor's mind as Sherlock pushed her behind him to face Victor.
Sherlock suffered being once more turned into a beast of burden and muttered commentary on the smoothness of his running. They arrived in the small village that was under the center of the Baskerville dome. The houses were entirely silent. Finney directed him to his quarters. Sliding down from Sherlock's back to prop a solid looking chair against the front door before hobbling up to a second floor bedroom where he picked up an enigmatic looking device.
"I…" John looked up at the African masks on the walls. A framed image of Martin Luther King walking over a bridge at the head of a crowd next to a first edition of
"My grandfather invented the neural enhancer. Marvelously effective, but limited to where its gentle wave lengths can reach. The more powerful the wave, the greater the effect. Without the full unit, all the smaller units can do is give impressions. Not a full treatment. Still if I hadn't come here, I wouldn't have found it. Experienced how effective it is. Developed a more mobile design. Perhaps I can demonstrate it to you later."
She rolled her eyes at him. "Fuck you! It worked." He shook his head and they picked their way through the fallen figures. The shuttlepod opened its door. Wide and welcoming.
John replicated a flannel to wipe the sweat from his forehead at the sudden flash of heat. The lights were too bright. He went to his quarters to see if Sherlock would show up like he'd used to do and fuck him through the mattress, but he didn't.
Sherlock pushed back slightly in his chair and got that little huff that said he was preparing to speak even while John was talking. The words came out rapidly. "That is a separate chart. I am not talking about our sexual relationship, which is excellent…" Sherlock cut himself off, with a shimmy in his chair, "I am talking about public displays of affection. I would like to be touched in an affectionate manner before others more often."
"Stun, please," said Amazing Sparkles. "There could be another explanation, and death is hard to take back, I think."
She went outside and it was a lovely day. A day that she wanted to be sharing with Sarabeth. She felt awkward. Wrong footed. Wanted a solution for… everything.
Garak pushed Sherlock's legs apart. "I'm sure she did. I have many satisfied customers." He measured the inside length of Sherlock's leg. "You have a nice long inseam. It'll be a pleasure to make you a suit or perhaps something less formal for lounging around in."
Trois Primus said in a small voice. "Grandmother Brittanus did a very good job retrofitting the original virus that gave the Breen their reproductive troubles."
"I can only speak to what information I've been programmed with. I was created to mimic an existing person and yet I was given constraints. Even with curiosity enabled, I have limits. I would not wish to become those scientists so full of arrogance. But it also takes arrogance to think you can crack the nature of the universe." Julian looked down at his hands. His smile was wry. "But you do happen to reside on a ship whose captain is the most curious Human I've ever met, who also happens to be an expert in exo-biology, and with whom you have already partnered on significant research. You'll be able to partner with John on the genome-wise-association-study he's planning. Perhaps ask for Captain Holmes' help understanding Augment sexuality."
"I see why they wanted our crew." Martha did not pick up the crystals. "That's vendarite. It's immensely useful as a conductor."
"Come on," said Lucy, "The events are starting." As she explained it, the theater experience was a night at a speakeasy. They could follow various actors. Observe various events. Solve mysteries." She looked over at Sherlock, who sniffed.
He tied the rope around a large rock, but he wouldn't be using is on the way down. He gouged quick hand holds with his hands in the ice and made the last thirty feet as a simple drop.
"You have to think about it," said Lucy, her brow wrinkling. "Why? He's in love with you. You're in love with him. It'll stick it to the Normals trying to push you out of Starfleet. You'll go on having adventures on the Bakerstreet."
And because this is my least favorite kind of argument (Wait, I have to prove something didn't happen. Ugh.), I have kindly given the problem to Sherlock.
"Yes," said Sherlock. "Unless you have reason to believe there is some other consciousness operating this facility."
Unaware of his thoughts, Mollyhoo laughed. "Sherlock, you really are strong, which is wonderful. We could use a little muscle. Not that it'll help when we're in season, but other times. That would be good. Oh, let's see. The cave system. We found has this gallery of stalactites and stalagmites full of salt crystals. So, we have salt. No other seasonings, but we have salt." She rubbed Toby's head. "And someone will get some yummy liver. Oh, yes you will. Sarabeth, she's my special someone, thinks we could use the bones to make tools. Awls. Needles, which," she glanced at their soaking wet clothes, "let me tell you take good care of that fabric, because it's the last you'll wear not made out of rodent skins or felt from Toby's fur." She waved at her own body, which was clothed in a tube of felt. She did a little dance. "We have a big beautiful hide to skin. I sort of know how to skin an animal."
It really wasn't good that neither Lurin nor Nom were among the clustered Ferengi, but now they were committed.
John nodded happily. He was feeling a bit fuzzy after downing a China Clipper followed by a Missionary's Downfall, and couldn't quite remember what his earlier resolution had been.
John forged on. "Even if your immune system doesn't attack them, your body may repair the microchimeric transfer of genetic material from the blastocysts to your body. If that happens, your body will not be able to provide them with nourishment."
"Of course," said Barrymore. "There's not much to the site. We oversee the perimeter and access into and out of the facility."
"It's still possible I could be reassigned to the Bakerstreet," said Sherlock. Certainly given the trajectory of his career, if his commission was reupped, assignment to a ship with a ten year lifespan would make sense. However, other eventualities were also possible. "If I am transferred to a different command, I'll make a place for you onboard. As a ship or base commander, I'd have," he glanced at Hudson, "a certain level of discretion about bringing on personnel for needed roles."
"He wouldn't be," said Chin with a level of disgust that was all the confirmation that John needed for a very unlikely idea.
"John, your timing leaves something to be desired." Sherlock didn't let go of John. He said, "Door, lock. Command sequence 489790."
Sex with Sherlock had gone from something that could get John cashiered out of Starfleet for breaking regulations to something that could turn Sherlock into something for experimentation. Endlessly harvested for what he could give. Because Section 31 was real. Because the Obsidian Order and the Tal Shiar and any number of other organizations were real.
Vesha was spattered in blood. Large purple bruises bloomed on his face and bare body. His eye closing up. The others were washing him off with water warmed over the fire. Vesha kept saying, "Sorry. I didn't mean to open the door. It was just there's so many of us and I didn't think Sherlock would ever… and I needed it. I…"
He had eyes. He had hands. He was able to cobble a simple transmitter in one of the filtration labs, but the range and power were limited. Still, if John came close enough, Sherlock might regain his voice.
